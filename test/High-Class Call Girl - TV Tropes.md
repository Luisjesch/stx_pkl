She has the beauty to get your attention... and the talent and charm to keep it.

_"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?"_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Her time is valuable; an hour with her will set you back a few hundred dollars (or whatever the local equivalent is). She’s fashionable; she wears silk stockings and looks good in a court wig and robes. She’s cultured; she speaks several languages, knows her claret from her Beaujolais, and can carry on a conversation with anyone from the flower vendor to the Queen.

She's not a barrister or a solicitor (though she could just be putting herself through school and might be arguing cases in a few years yet). In simplest terms, she's a prostitute, but that label fails to capture the full breadth of her occupation.

The High-Class Call Girl—also known as an escort or "courtesan" if you're feeling fancy—occupies the highest tier of her profession, which is usually safer, pays more, and is seen as more respectable than working in a brothel or on the street. On-screen, it allows for attractive actresses to do plenty of fanservice, while not dealing with the truly unsavory aspects of prostitution. She moves through elite circles and appears at fancy events. Her clientele will mostly be men (and sometimes women) in the upper echelons of society (expect at least one of them to be a politician, particularly one who is always publicly touting his good old fashioned Family Values). The nature of this clientele may also lead to them becoming involved in a Hookers and Blow situation.

Historically, a High-Class Call Girl was refined, well-educated, and genuinely smart, giving her more agency than most women of her time. In modern settings, she has even more financial freedom to control her situation, choose her customers, and engage in Unproblematic Prostitution. She might not officially sell her body at all, she might merely sell her time and company, and whether sex happens during that time is up to her. Often an Ethical Slut; also likely to be a Hooker with a Heart of Gold, or to become a Miss Kitty when she's older.

Compare and contrast Dominatrix and Silk Hiding Steel. Compare Gold Digger. If they limit themselves to one client, they are The Mistress. She may be a Shady Lady of the Night.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Anita in _D.Gray-Man_, could qualify as both this and Miss Kitty. She runs the biggest and most fancy brothel in China, so it is probably the most expensive that only the upper-classed men could afford. When dressed up and running her brothel, she wears very elegant clothing and a fancy headdress. She seems to get nothing but respect from people and has her own ship, with a crew who respects and obeys her every word; thus, she also has a knowledge of sailing. She meets the Exorcists in China but speaks Japanese, which is good since only 1 person in the group of 4 speaks Chinese. Her lover, Cross Marian, who has a good share of other lovers himself, says that she was a strong and good woman, after finding out she's been killed. She also has a big burly female bodyguard named Mahoja who also works as a bouncer for her brothel, most likely to make sure the men won't abuse her or any of the other women, as it's been said Anita has no tolerance for mean people. So, if you're going to be with her or anywhere near her or her brothel, you'd better be well-mannered. She's a prostitute, but she has standards and will NOT have patience if you break them.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_ - Principal Daimon financed her revenge scheme by being a hostess in a seedy bar.
-   Nokaze in _Jin_ is the most famous courtesan in 1860s Edo. The time-traveling title character gets the special deluxe treatment from her.
-   Nayotake Shimizu from _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ was a prostitute in such high demand that she could charge over a million yen for a single night of service. She eventually ended up getting pregnant with the child of one of her clients (who had fallen hopelessly in love with her), leading to the birth of Kaguya Shinomiya, the series' main character.
-   The Wano arc of _One Piece_ introduces "Komurasaki" (real name Kozuki Hiyori), who is an _oiran_, the highest rank a courtesan in Wano can hold, and considered the most beautiful woman in the nation.

She also uses her role to get close to Shogun Orochi (the man who murdered her parents), who is deeply enamored with her, to gain information to help the alliance.
-   In the _jousei_ manga _Oiran Chirashi_, the Naïve Everygirl Haru becomes a Fish out of Temporal Water as she falls into the Yoshiwara of pre-Meiji times. She's taken in by the cynical regent of a high-class brothel and, to survive in such a Crapsaccharine World, she accepts to re-invent herself as Ayame, one of her "girls".
-   Yumi Komagata from _Rurouni Kenshin_ was an _oiran_ (a high-class courtesan). Also, despite not being a bad person, she was _far_ more cynical and emotionally broken than the standard thanks to some extreme dick moves on the part of The Government. The prequel _Master of Flame_ is dedicated to Yumi and shows how her pre-Shishio life was, mentions how she became a call girl, and shows how she and Shishio met in the luxurious brothel she worked for.
-   Gender-Inverted Trope: Souma from _Sakura Gari_ will let anyone sleep with him as long as there is something for him to gain from them in return. One of the detectives even remarks on it, saying that even back when they were investigating his stepmother's suicide, he had the eyes of a prostitute.
-   In an episode of _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_, Itoshki briefly overcomes his pessimism and resolves to become The Hedonist. This includes hiring a high-class prostitute.
-   Another Gender-Inverted Trope: Sakuya Ookuchi, the male lead from _Sensual Phrase_. Prior to the events<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in his early teenage years, aside from working as a bar singer, Sakuya also used to work as a male escort at _just 12_ years old due to have a tall-large figure (thanks to his Caucasian-American ancestry) and look older than his actual age.
-   We meet two in _Wicked City_. They're both demon women sent to act as Honey Traps, and one of them actually becomes a major antagonist since she doubles as a Dark Action Girl.
-   What Suzu's former mistress Riyo used to be in _The Twelve Kingdoms_.
-   Yugiri from _Zombie Land Saga_ was a legendary oiran when she was alive during the Meiji Restoration (while in the present day, she's a zombie who's been revived to be part of an idol group). Episode 2 shows that she's very good at playing the shamisen, which is just one of many skills oiran were expected to learn. In Episode 10, she also reveals that she had training as a Geisha.

    Arts 

-   _Olympia_: Subverted. The nude woman is a prostitute, not a high-class girl. Instead, it's the person she is modeling for who is high class. In other words, her client, who is so rich that he has even assigned Olympia a servant. Additionally, the name "Olympia" is a French slang term for prostitute.

    Comic Books 

-   One volume of _The Boys_ has a superhero party called Herogasm, where the majority of the country's heroes gather and have wild sex with each other and the high-class call girls there. At one point, The Homelander attempts to use one of these girls to distract his uber-competent Magnificent Bastard boss from Vought American.

-   A one-shot _Punisher_ story had Frank using one of these as an accomplice to get close to some corrupt politicians/corporate goons in order to...well, do what he does best.
-   Played with in a _Red Ears_ comic. A john visits a dignified woman's lavish apartment, who is soon revealed to the reader to be a prostitute. Looking around the place while she changes into a nightgown, he realizes that she's very cultured, intelligent, and rich. She just chose to be a hooker because she _likes_ it.
-   _Sin City_: While it's not outright stated, the girls of Old Town are implied to have a wide range of prices. One story explains that you can see limos parked alongside old pickup trucks in Old Town. Gail, the madame, carries herself in such a way as to imply that she is quite pricey. Not to mention nobody ever stiffs them - well, those who try don't live to regret it.
-   Katchoo was one during her years in LA in the history of _Strangers in Paradise_. She looks back on this time with nostalgic fondness and love, but also with horror, disgust, and revulsion. It was during this time that she met Emma, the first person to actually be _nice_ to her except for Francine, and the woman who took her off the street, gave her a place to live, and whom Katchoo eventually fell in love and escaped with, but Emma is also the one who introduced her to the world of prostitution and, more importantly (and traumatically), Darcy Parker, whose psychotic tendencies and obsessions drove Katchoo to drink, abuse drugs and suffer from crippling emotional issues for years.
    
    **Emma:** Nervous? Well, don't be. You'll do fine. Act shy but interested. They love that. And don't fidget... they hate it if you're nervous. Aw, c'mon, honey... it's not like it's gonna kill you!

-   _Battle of the Bulge_: General Kohler sends a ridiculously attractive "courtesan first class" to Col. Hessler's room. Hessler, being a no-nonsense hardass, sends the call girl on her way. In point of fact, the point when he sends her packing is the moment she mentions his wife confirming his suspicion she knew full well that he was married and is implying that he has a reputation for cheating on his wife, which he _very much doesn't and won't do._
-   Severine in _Belle de Jour_ is a young woman who spends her midweek afternoons as a high-class prostitute, while her husband is at work.

-   _Catch Me If You Can_. Frank meets one in a hotel, enjoys a night of sex, and then not only gives her a fake check but scams her into giving him $400 change for the fake check. He recognizes her as a model, so it's not quite clear if she's a full-time prostitute or if she was just tempted by his rich guy persona.
-   _Dangerous Beauty_ is a bio-pic of Veronica Franco, who was a Real Life Venetian courtesan, or high-class prostitute. At one point in the movie, she — _\[ahem\]_ — "persuades" the king of France to lend Venice the warships needed for war with the Turks. In Real Life, she did have a liaison with King Henri III, but it probably wasn't of quite that much diplomatic importance.

-   Halfway through _The Menu_, we learn that beautiful, intelligent, and charming Margot is a sex worker, hired by Tyler to be his dinner date. Given that her two confirmed clients in the movie (Tyler and Richard) are both extremely wealthy, we can assume she isn't cheap.

-   _A Score to Settle_: After getting out of prison, Frankie gets involved with Simone; a high-class call girl who charges $1000 an hour.
-   "Shanghai Lily" in _Shanghai Express_ (Marlene Dietrich) is a hooker and obviously a very expensive one, traveling in the first-class car of the train, and wearing a series of very ornate dresses. She has a travelling companion Hui Fei, who similarly appears to be expensive; a scene shows them playing records in their cabin, which by the standards of the Great Depression was to show them as extravagant (most people couldn't afford recorded music).
-   _Spears_ has a minor character Ashaki, who's implied to be expensive - given that Jeff knows her, and he's not the type to pick up a Street Walker. She's hired to help them catch an enemy by seducing him in a nightclub.

They are very strict about their clients, only catering to people in high positions, and it's invite only by somebody who's already a member. While she's quickly hired as a new girl because of her beauty, Cindy has some difficulty fitting into the role, so the madame has to quietly coach her on what sort of things these clients like and don't like. Eventually, she becomes rather good at it.
-   _The World of Suzie Wong_ downplays it, since Suzie does have to pick clients up at a bar, but considers herself higher class than streetwalkers. She also makes enough to briefly support Robert financially. She also has an Unlimited Wardrobe of fancy cheongsams.

    Literature 

-   Mona Sofia from Federico Andajhazi's _The Anatomist_ is the most beautiful, cynical, and expensive prostitute in the whole Venetian Republic. A whole chapter of the book is dedicated to the _extremely_ squicky (and not exactly believable) circumstances behind her success. She meets an anvilicious and tragically ironic end, due to contracting syphilis.
    -   Also Ines de Torquemada, after being emotionally broken. She doesn't end up much better.
-   Kestel Falke in _The Ascendant Kingdoms Saga_ has a backstory as a highly sought-after courtesan in the royal court of Donderath. This was actually a cover for her _real_ job as a hired spy and assassin; she ends up in the Penal Colony of Velant after being caught at the latter.
-   _Beware of Chicken_: This is essentially Guan Chyou's role in the Azure Jade Trading Company; she's both intelligent and attractive, and is assigned to highly valued clients to provide for _any_ and all needs that they may have — business-related or otherwise. When she starts flirting with Jin, who's happily married, he quickly shuts her down and requests different services, but doesn't realize it's actually part of her job; he assumes it was more of an impromptu order to seduce a client. When business partners assume that Chyou is in fact sleeping with Jin, she allows and even encourages the assumption, for her own protection. Jin's reputation and influence mean that no one will dare to push any boundaries with her if they think she's taken.
-   _The Change Room_: Shar is a well-paid, very beautiful sex worker who does this for money to get her degree in therapy at the university. At one point Shar even mentally calls herself this.

Partway through the story, she enters a Marriage of Convenience with a gay and dying aristocrat and is able to retire, although she still discreetly sleeps around a lot for fun.
-   The most famous high-class courtesan in all of literature is probably Marguerite Gautier, the tragic heroine of _La dame aux camélias_ (better known in English-speaking countries as _Camille_), by Alexandre Dumas _fils_. She was inspired by the famed Parisian courtesan Marie Duplessis, with whom Dumas _fils_ had a brief love affair (and whose other lovers included Franz Liszt) before she died at age 23.
-   Haruki Murakami wrote _Dance Dance Dance_ which had a network of these.
    -   _Kafka on the Shore_ describes one, a philosophy major, on the job.
-   Chandramukhi from _Devdas_ was this and in fact the richest and most popular of all the prostitutes, at least until she gave up her "profession" to marry the eponymous Devdas, who is always dogged by his feelings for his childhood friend Paro (who has been married off to someone else).

-   The Danielle Steel novel _The Duchess_ has the title character, the heroine, actually running a brothel full of these.
-   Anyone trained by the Bene Gesserit in _Dune_, as they learn certain, ah, marital arts alongside many other things. Case in point, Lady Jessica, a concubine for a powerful and influential Duke who helps out a lot in managing his household. The whole operation is a cover for the BG's secret breeding program.
-   Servilia in the _Emperor_ books ensures that her brothels are staffed entirely by girls like this. She herself also qualifies and is so successful that she can influence the senate.
-   The temple prostitute Shamhat from _The Epic of Gilgamesh_. Temple prostitution was part of the duties of some priests and priestesses of that time and place, and thus it was seen as a sacred and respectable act.
-   La Señora from _Eva Luna_ has several of these girls working for her in her brothel. They're described rather sympathetically: they're pretty, and rather kind girls who dote on Eva and just _happen_ to be atop of the local sex industry.
    -   Also, Tránsito Soto from _The House of the Spirits_. She doesn't really start as such, though: by the time she's in her 30s/40s, however, she has become this thanks to hard work, growing into her looks _and_ showing off lots of smarts and charisma.
-   Francesca in _The Heirs of Alexandria_. Goes on to become an imperial advisor and The Mistress.

-   Luphera from _The Iron Teeth_ web serial. Blacknail wanders into her room, while she happens to be naked. She's an incredibly beautiful and sensual woman. Her room is also luxurious, tasteful, and filled with a flowery aphrodisiac scent.

The protagonist, Phedre no Delaunay, is an extremely high-priced prostitute, who, besides her innate craving for pain, is a trained spy, speaks thirteen languages, and is quite generally regarded as the best in the business by man and woman alike. She also becomes active in court politics as a confidante of the Queen and earns a noble title, making her high-class in every respect.
-   _The Lost Diary of Don Juan_: Alma is a former student of the titular libertine and the most famed courtesan in Sevilla. Highly intelligent and often dressed to the nines, she openly mingles with the most prominent members of society and understands Don Juan’s true personality in a way few others do.
-   Lightly implied to be Lady Meserole's former (?) profession in the Discworld novel _Night Watch_: she asks if Vimes thinks she's an "old seamstress" ("seamstress" being an Unusual Euphemism for "prostitute") and he says, "Actually I was thinking bespoke tailoring." She also goes by "Madam" and there's some uncertainty about whether it's a job title or more of an honorific.
-   _Portrait in Sepia_: In her prime, Amanda Lowell is a beautiful Scottish actress in San Francisco. Money is not enough for her services; charm and good manners are also necessary. She literally collects notches in her bedpost, one for every lover. Feliciano Rodriguez de la Cruz has a dalliance with her. Paulina del Valle (his wife) finds out and is furious about him embarrassing her like that.
-   _The Reynard Cycle_: _Defender of the Crown_ features Precieuse, who is a temple prostitute and companion to the King. Even his mother approves.

-   The James Patterson novel _Sail_.
-   Prostitution is considered a sacred profession by the Summer Islanders of _A Song of Ice and Fire_, being practiced even by the nobility. Chataya, a Summer Islander, runs a high-class brothel in King's Landing that caters to nobles and wealthy clients.
    -   Another example is provided by the courtesans of Braavos, who are famed throughout Essos and Westeros and who enjoy a practically revered status. Whilst all of them enjoy high status, each owning their own river barge and servants to crew it, one of them, the Nightingale, is so revered that the bravos that wander the street, looking to duel and show off their swordsmanship, will challenge anyone who does not agree that she is the most beautiful woman in the world.
-   In Robert B. Parker's _Spenser_ series, recurring character Patricia Utley runs a whole enterprise of this sort. She takes very, _very_ good care of her girls.

-   The story "The Whore of Mensa" in Woody Allen's book _Without Feathers_ features a call-girl agency where the girls discuss high literature with the customers (and do nothing else).
-   _Whateley Universe_: 'Abby Carfax' is a Boston Brahmin debutante turned call girl who keeps a string of wealthy clientele; she is careful to make sure that no money changes hands, just 'gifts' in the form of things such as expensive jewelry, rent payments for her expensive hotel room, etc. Too bad for her clients that it's all fake: she is actually Alex O'Brien, AKA Vamp, an intersexed teenage Super Villain who uses her Charm Person powers to convince them they had sex when they really hadn't.
-   Fortunato in _Wild Cards_ runs an agency of these, and makes it very clear that the extra air of class means that they are _not_ whores. He prefers to call them "geishas" in deference to his Japanese mother (which is a little iffy, historically speaking, but whatever).
-   Discussed in _The Wise Man's Fear_: Denna rescues a runaway girl forced to play prostitute to make ends meet from a violent client, then has a long talk with her about how if she doesn't want to return home she can at least make herself one of these. The glamor only goes so far, though: Denna compares a High-Class Call Girl to a normal prostitute by comparing a lord's well-kept horse to a shabby, run-down steed - including the part where at the end of the day they both get ridden.
-   One of the ten women who make up the composite personality of Penric's demon in the _World of the Five Gods_ series is Mira, a courtesan. When Penric is on the run, penniless, and hiding out in a bordello, she helps him to take on her persona - so convincingly that he has to go through with an assignation for real after a patron takes too much of a shine to Mira. His disguise holds up, and the money bankrolls his escape.

By the end of the season, it is taken over as headquarters for Rosetti's mobsters and it quickly devolves into a low-class establishment that the mobsters are more familiar with. Gillian was not a prostitute herself before this, but in season four she becomes a low-class one in order to support her heroin habit.
-   _Buffyverse_: Darla was implied to have been one when alive, as she was "a whore" (in her words) but also "a woman of some property" according to the Master, and had some servants whom she dismissed from her deathbed when the Master showed up.
-   In _Community_ episode The Politics Of Human Sexuality Pierce's girlfriend Doreen is an escort. Curiously (considering this is Pierce we're discussing), he _doesn't_ have to pay for a date with her. At least initially.
-   _The Confessions of Frannie Langton_: Frannie worked as one for a while at the School House brothel with Sal, wearing beautiful dresses and her quarters being very nice. It's also unclear if she even has sex with any johns, as those seen only want to be flogged by her. She's still quite miserable since she'd only gone there due to being forcibly separated from her girlfriend Marguerite, whom she misses deeply.
-   The Contessa ran an entire house of these in _Copper_.
-   Leanne Battersby briefly works as a call girl in _Coronation Street_.

-   In _Death in Paradise_, Victim of the Week Carlton Paris is a male version who caters to the wealthy and powerful women of the island: his home is filled with expensive clothes and artwork, and he extensively researches his clients' interests so he can hold up his end of a conversation. Being a noted Pretty Boy doesn't hurt either. His classiness was what got him killed; he realised a painting at the local art gallery was a forgery while researching before a date with an art-loving woman, and was shot by the gallery owner to stop him from telling anyone.
-   _Desperate Housewives_: In season 1, Maisy Gibbons is a housewife who runs a side business as a prostitute for various married men in Fairview. Bree's husband Rex Van de Kamp uses Maisy's services to engage in BDSM activities he's too ashamed to tell Bree about. Bree ends up finding out about Rex's visits to Maisy when he has a heart attack during one of them and is hospitalized. Later on, Maisy is investigated and arrested for solicitation and cuts a plea deal with the district attorney to give up a list of all her clients, refusing Bree's request to take Rex's name off said list as a way of retaliating against her for snubbing Maisy when her husband Harold got laid off from his job a year earlier.
    
    **Mary Alice Young:** _\[narrating\]_ To understand Maisy Gibbons, you first need to know how she spent her afternoons. Her mornings were spent running errands for her husband. Her evenings were spent washing dishes and helping with homework. But her afternoons, well, they were spent in the company of men. Frustrated. Misunderstood. Lonely men. Willing to pay money to feel a little less lonely. And Maisy Gibbons was willing to help them.
    
-   The women (and men) of _Dollhouse_ are this, and much, much more. Since they're actually "blank slate" bodies with personalities downloaded into them meeting the clients' exact requirements, the Dollhouse caters exclusively to the super-rich. Prostitution is pretty common, but hardly the limit of what they're capable of being. In the pilot, Echo is sent out to act the part of a _hostage negotiator_.

-   Companions in _Firefly_. They are seen as high-class citizens, and Inara gets bizarre looks when she steps outside the ship on backwater planets. Contrast that to the unlicensed brothel in the episode "Heart of Gold"; the workers there are seen as trash.
    -   When the crew gets interned by an Alliance Cruiser, the officer interrogating them is rather surprised to find a preacher and a Companion on board, implying that Companions have at least equal social standing to that of the clergy. At one point, Inara uses her status as a Companion to browbeat a country sheriff into letting Mal and Zoe out of jail. It's also mentioned or implied several times that Mal originally allowed Inara to rent one of his shuttles because she would give his "enterprise" an air of class and sophistication and that her presence would ensure that his ship could land even in "respectable" ports.

-   Ted _believed_ that the date Barney got him for an award ceremony was one in _How I Met Your Mother_. The series of Accidental Innuendos didn't help. She actually _was_ a paralegal.

-   Sam's not-girlfriend Laurie from the first season of _The West Wing_ (yes, the one played by Lisa Edelstein) is probably the highest class of high-class call girls, being that she provides her service for some of **THE** most powerful men in the country.

    Music 

-   In the music video for Michael Jackson's "Who Is It?", Jackson finds a calling card carelessly misplaced by his girlfriend. The card appears expensive and has the name "Alex" inscribed on it. Consequently, Jackson suspects her of cheating and has his trusted attendant investigate her. The woman is actually, unbeknownst to him, secretly working as a high-end call girl, and Alex was one of the pseudonyms she used. When she realizes that the card is missing, she apparently quits sex work and goes to Jackson's mansion, ready to confess everything and start anew. Unfortunately, before she could get there, Jackson was told everything about her and decided to abandon the place (and her) for good. The final part of the video shows the girl going back to her "establishment," being smacked for leaving, and returning to the life of a high-end hooker, now trapped in this role for good.

After making several fortunes, she retired to her estate in Sweden, where she raises her granddaughter and laments about how "modern" women lack the skill, discretion, and passion for sex that her generation displayed.

-   Giulietta in _The Tales of Hoffmann_ is another operatic courtesan, much less noble and tragic than Violetta.

    Web Animation

    Webcomics 

-   Nyarai and the Cyclone Crushers from _Furry Fight Chronicles_ work as hostesses in Club Nighthawk when not fighting as Combagals. As seen in Chapter 6, it is a _very_ bad idea to try anything on them as they are strong enough that they don't need bodyguards.
-   Debacle in the _Insecticomics_ is a well-respected actor and cultural icon, mainly due to her Debbie Does Daebola series. No one seems to have a problem with this, besides the local network executive (whose problem is mostly because she has no idea what the porn is about even after seeing it).
