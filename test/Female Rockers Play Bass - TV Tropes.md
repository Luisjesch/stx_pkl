_"Our songs are unique, but let's face it: without a mysterious-looking girl in our rhythm section, we have zero hope of any real exposure."_

— _The Hard Times_, "All-Male Band Just Waiting to Meet the Right Girl Bassist"

In the popular imagination, the bass guitar is the feminine rock band instrument. Odds are, if there's an "alternative", rocker chick character, she'll play the bass. And since rock bands can have at most one female member, she'll be the bassist.

This goes hand in hand with other musician stereotypes. Since drummers stereotypically require strength and physicality and the lead guitarist gets all the girls, men gravitate to those roles, leaving the less-competitive bass player positions open for women to gain a foothold. It also often goes along with Nobody Loves the Bassist: the position is typically seen as the "least essential" member of a band, so being a girl is often seen as the female bassist's main contribution. Compounding this with the phallic imagery associated with guitars — including bass guitars — her job is to add sex appeal or otherwise pander to the audience.

There are, however, other reasons the bass can be seen as the feminine instrument. As the rhythm and core of the sound, the bass can be considered The Heart among the instruments, lending itself to female musicians who might be more willing to play a support role.

This stereotype can be considered tokenizing, with the implication that female bassists aren't "real musicians". However, some of the most famous real-life examples, like Suzi Quatro, Tina Weymouth, Kim Deal or Kim Gordon, were Lead Bassists and defined their bands' sounds. More broadly, female bassists can be seen as trailblazers in the male-dominated rock genre and inspiration to generations of female musicians.

Compare Male Band, Female Singer and Five-Man Band, which put the Token Girl in a different role. **Remember that Aversions are not notable and Real Life examples cannot be Played With.**

Formerly known as the Suzi Quatro Principle.

-   Argentinean rock band Las Pelotas has bassist and back-vocalist Gabriela Martínez, the only female member of the group.

-   Throughout various lineup changes, Smashing Pumpkins have always had a female bassist, who was the only female member prior to the 2000s reunion. D'Arcy Wretzky, their original bassist, gets hit with the Nobody Loves the Bassist aspect the most — fans commonly speculate that Billy Corgan only chose her for her looks, and he ended up re-recording a lot of her parts on later albums. Melissa Auf Der Mar, being well regarded as a musician in her own right, didn't get this accusation as much. Corgan's short-lived side project Zwan also had a female bassist in Paz Lenchantin.

She was the only woman in both bands— although she did have female company as backing vocalists on tour with Talking Heads— and her funk-influenced basslines were seen as an essential core of the band's material.

    Fictional Examples 

Anime and Manga

-   In _FLCL_, Haruko is a sexually aggressive rocker chick whose Weapon (and instrument) of choice is a bass guitar. In one episode she gives Naota, a preteen boy whose burgeoning _male_ sexuality is the focus of the story, the ability to use similar instrument-based attacks, and he gets a 6-string electric guitar (specifically, a Flying V).
-   _My Hero Academia_: Kyoka Jiro, the most 'alternative' of the Class 1-A girls (she's a snarky and aloof rocker with short hair, in contrast to the other girls who are preppier or straightforwardly feminine) and is the class's most preeminent musician; during the School Festival, she spearheads their school festival with her Beautiful Singing Voice and skill at the bass guitar.
-   _Macross 7_: among the Fire Bomber band, Mylene is the girliest of the group, and her role is the bassist and secondary vocalist. Ironically, the other woman in the band, Veffidas, is the drummer.

Fan Works

-   A.A. Pessimal's take on the Discworld sees young witch Rebecka Smith-Rhodes drawn to music. Her first instructor, wanting a partner and supporting musician for her Minstrel act, teaches Bekki to pick out simple repetitive themes on the lower bass strings of guitars and mandolins, which she can then build her lead instrumentation around. After returning to Ankh-Morpork, her _this-man-is-not-my-boyfriend-OK?_, a musician, shows her how to do the same on an upright bass. Finally her musician and inventive-genius little sister devises the first true bass guitar on the Disc. And gives it to Bekki. Who realises. In the band of Life, she is fated to be the bass player.
-   Luz Clawthorne has skills in playing guitar and upon finding and using an Acoustic Bass she accidentally brings to life, she falls into this category.

Film

-   In _Wayne's World_, Cassandra (pictured atop this page) is the bassist and only woman in her band. While her sex appeal (schwing!) is a big part of why people are interested in the band, she's also the frontman and vocalist and genuinely serious about her music. The sequel reveals that she's the only one in the band with any talent.
-   _American Satan_ features Lily, the bassist and sole female member of the main character's band The Relentless. The members even hesitate to allow her to join the band out of fear that a woman with her good looks would be a distraction to them.
-   In _School of Rock,_ Katie, the bassist, is the only female in the band who plays an instrument, while the other girls are backup singers or take behind-the-scenes positions. Justified, as she was a cellist and as Dewey points out; the bass guitar really isn't that different from a cello.
-   In _Metal Lords_, Emily is brought to fit in the rhythm section of the Rock Trio, through with an erudite version of the bass, namely the electric cello.

Live-Action TV

-   In _Community_, Vaughn's band, which has the classic five-person rock band composition of lead singer, guitarist, bassist, drummer, and keyboardist, has a female bassist as the only girl. She doesn't get any lines and is in the periphery of most shots.
-   _Hospital Playlist_: Song-hwa is the only woman in the main cast of five doctor friends, who have their own band and who play rock songs to unwind from the pressures of hospital work. Naturally, she is the bassist. (And occasionally lead singer, at her own insistence despite being terrible.)
-   _How I Met Your Mother_:
    -   Early in the series when Ted describes his ideal woman, one of the qualities she has is "plays the bass." Many seasons later, we meet the mother and she does, in fact, play the bass in a band and is the only female member, where she's pushed around by the lead singer (and complete Jerkass) Derek, despite her having seniority.
    -   During the series there is a Girl of the Week named Stacey Gusar who is the bass player in a reggae band. While the makeup of her band is unknown, what is known is that she spends the entirety of the episode being subject to the manipulations of Ted and Barney regarding a bet.
-   In the first season of _Drake & Josh,_ the bassist for Drake's band was also the sole female member.

-   Referenced in the song "She Plays Bass" by beabadoobee (a female _guitarist_), which is about being inspired by and seeking to emulate a female bassist in an older band.

-   In _Night in the Woods_, Mae was the bassist in her friend Gregg's (songwriter and lead guitarist) band along with Casey (drums) and Angus (vocals), playing the trope straight originally. After returning from college, she's found that Casey's disappeared, and the role of Drummer and Bassist has been taken over by he former best friend Bea's computer. Accordingly, when she rejoins she's rusty and doesn't know most of the songs (represented to the player by a minigame they have little chance of succeeding at first time), which corresponds to the way her friend group's moved on in her absence (even though she's still been missed).

Web Animation

-   _Homestar Runner_:
    -   The short "Record Store Day b/w B-est of B-sides" includes a montage of cover art from the (fictional) low-fi Alternative Rock band Sloshy.

    -   Lampshaded in the _Strong Bad Email_ "Best Thing" during "Limozeen: But They're in Space!" when Teeg Dougland tells the band that an alternative metal group is currently at the top of the charts.
