There has to be an easier way to hang with your friends...

_"Did you forget how physics works?"_

Contrary to what Hollywood would have you think, saving someone from falling is not as easy as grabbing them when they're already falling. Even if they're smaller and lighter than you, odds are their momentum will pull you down with them, or at least seriously injure your arm.

It should be noted that catching someone while standing on the ground doesn't count, only catching someone from an elevated position that _should_ result in you being injured and/or pulled down with them.

Justified if the catcher has Super-Strength or a similar ability, or possibly if Cartoon Physics applies.

Often overlaps with Take My Hand!, Artistic License – Physics, and/or Artistic License – Biology.

Sister Trope to Not the Fall That Kills You…, which focuses on the falling person.

Compare Catch a Falling Star, in which the catcher also is moving, and Giant Robot Hands Save Lives, where the catcher's size tends to make the catch more plausible.

-   _Brynhildr in the Darkness_: Played With. Ryota falls from a water tower while trying to save Hatsuna in the process. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  He's saved by Kotori who uses her powers to switch places with people. He discovers after landing that her powers come with the side effect of cancelling all inertia when switching with someone while in midair.
-   _A Certain Scientific Railgun_: The first episode of the anime's second season sees a terrorist toss a hostage from a helicopter as a means of trying to distract Mikoto Misaka, who'd been using her electromagnetism to anchor the helicopter and prevent it from escaping. Fortunately, Ruiko Saten was on the fire escape and caught the flung hostage before she could fall. And when the added weight started to prove to be more than she could handle, she and the hostage were teleported to the roof by Kuroko Shirai leaning out the window.
-   Shirley from _Code Geass_ learns that Lelouch is Zero and thinks Suzaku is his accomplice. Driven by fear of them being "fakes" deceiving her, she runs far away until she gets on the edge of the building and falls before Lelouch catches her by her hand with Suzaku grabbing one of Lelouch's legs, so the two won't fall to their death.

They jump off the cliff, where Marco (in gorilla morph) is waiting under an overhang to natch them as they fall, while the real Hork-Bajir play dead at the bottom of the cliff where the other team members are morphed as wolves and biting into them (it's painful, but Hork-Bajir can survive their skulls being opened.
