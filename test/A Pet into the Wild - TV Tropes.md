**Duchess**: McKinley, Lupin said all dogs are descendants of wolves.  
**McKinley**: A long time ago, yes.  
**Duchess**: Lupin says it wasn't _that_ long ago. Anyway, she believes that it's time we stopped living with people. Time to be independent again, to get back to the wild the way we once lived. That's what she said. And it's what I'm thinking of doing.

A very common occurrence in xenofiction media starring domesticated animals are for the protagonists to be strays. This adds a lot of drama to their life (having to flee from predators and humans, having to find food and shelter, dealing with rival animals, etc) but is also convenient for the writers (can create mythos and cultures for the animals, no need for curfews, no being confined by the limits of having an owner, no explanations for why the pets are outside all the time, etc).

Occasionally the pets will be born a stray but more commonly they will be a pet who runs off or is abandoned by their owner. Many times these pets-gone-strays will be bored of being a pet and jump at the excuse to leave. Rarely do their owners seem to care for their missing pet and even rarer do they actually retrieve them. The protagonist being a former pet makes them a good Audience Surrogate as they're uncertain about how living as a stray works and must learn alongside the viewer.

Characters who were originally pets will often face Fantastic Racism from feral animals for having been a pet. This can be anything from mild teasing to full-on aggression. In some works, the offspring of a stray and a pet (or a pet-gone-stray and a stray) will face hatred as well.

Stories that revolve around pets on their own usually come in two types: One where the animal flees willingly and another where they're lost or abandoned. In the former case, expect them to stay strays the entire story. In the latter case though, they'll often return to their owners or be adopted by someone else.

This is more common with cats than other pets. Dogs and cats are the most popular animals for xenofiction; however, in most developed countries, stray dogs are uncommon. They're either rare or are quickly caught by humans. Stray and feral dogs are seen as more of a hazard, and are more inherently dangerous (large dogs in special, though even if rare rabbies is more common in dogs than cats) than a stray cat is, though stray cats are considered more hazardous to the environment than their canine counterparts, and even feral dogs tend to be more tameable than feral cats. In contrast, stray and feral cats are a common sight even in urban areas.

There's a bit of Values Dissonance to these types of stories. Many, such as _Warrior Cats_ and _Varjak Paw_, are written by European writers. In the North Americas there is a large "Inside Cat vs Outside Cat" issue, with most animal welfare groups and cat experts citing that cats should exclusively be inside cats and that it's both abusive and bad for the environment if cats are left outside unattended. In the UK, however, the opposite is true. Leaving your cat inside permanently is seen as abusive and cats are meant to be allowed outside. Many adoption agencies won't even adopt out cats if they're intended to be inside cats. Australia is in the middle ground: letting your cats outside is a good thing, as long as it's daylight because your cat will screw the environment if they're outside at night. Feral animals do exist nevertheless, however North Americans are less likely to glamourize it.

This trope is almost always presented in a more positive light than it is in real life. In real life, pets-gone-stray do not do well in the wild. They don't have the survival skills of feral animals and often times get loose in places completely unsuitable for their species. For example, stray and feral chickens do well in Hawaii, because it is tropical like the red jungle fowl’s (ancestor of the domestic chicken) native habitat. Stray chickens don't do so well in Northeastern and northern Midwestern US states and Southeastern Canada because the climate is very different from that of their ancestor.

If they do somehow make it past their first few weeks without being killed or rescued, they'll likely have less-than-fortunate lives filled with hunger, parasites, and danger. Not even feral animals live long (feral cats have a lifespan around 3-5 years in contrast to pets who live 13-20 <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ), nevermind pets who have to learn survival skills as adults. Alas, watching a dog die of starvation isn't exactly fun so most stories (even darker ones) whitewash the harsher aspects.

Contrast with From Stray to Pet, where a stray animal is adopted. Compare to The Runaway, Stray Animal Story, and Raised In Captivity (for when a wild animal — like a bear or wolf — is raised in captivity and let go into the wild later on).

-   From Stray to Pet appears in _Warrior Cats_ but it is much more common for this to occur. The Clans look down upon "kittypets" (and it's against the Warrior Code to interact with humans and act like a kittypet), and thus it's rare for them to be taken in by humans permanently; however, many kittypets leave their owners to join the Clans:
    -   The series starts out with a kittypet kitten named Rusty who finds his life as a pet bland and has dreams of being a stray cat. (Appropriately, the first book is named _Into the Wild_.) One day he ventures away from home and comes across three cats from ThunderClan. Due to Bluestar recognizing Rusty as being the cat who will likely fulfill a recent prophecy she has seen, she allows Rusty to join the Clan and renames him "Firepaw". Firepaw is renamed "Fireheart" once he finishes his warrior training and ultimately becomes "Firestar" when he becomes the new leader of ThunderClan.
    -   Fireheart brought his nephew, Cloudtail, to ThunderClan as a young kit. His sister, Princess, wanted to choose what happened to her firstborn as she knew her owners would choose where her other kits went.

    -   Firestar's half brother Scourge was a kittypet named "Tiny", who fled his home after his sister told him that any kittens that humans didn't want were thrown into a river. Later on, Scourge's littermates Socks and Ruby, who had been adopted by Twolegs, became strays when their Twolegs abandoned them after moving away. The two begged their brother Scourge to take them in, but he chased them off. It's never clarified if Socks and Ruby were eventually adopted again or if they lived as loners for the rest of their lives.

Eventually, the trope is subverted, as Kiche returns to the village with her son.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Life After People_ has several instances of this happening to domesticated pets:
    -   Dogs can be pretty good survivors once the humans are gone, though some still struggle to survive:
        -   A Lacy Hound (a dog with the blood of scenthounds, sighthounds, and wolves) uses all she can to scavenge for food in her late owner's house. Once the food and water run out, she joins a pack of former pet Lacy Hounds, and they roam over the plains of Texas, hunting wild pigs.
        -   Bo the Portuguese Water Dog, a pet of President Barack Obama, makes his way from the White House to Chesapeake Bay. Eight years after people, and he's lived well by himself, fishing for clams, crabs, and fish.
        -   Sadly, not all pets make it on their own. A Labrador retriever guide dog tries living on his own near a grocery store. Once the food runs out, however, the retriever tries scavenging for food since he doesn't know how to hunt, and he slowly dies from starvation.
        -   Greyhounds used in racing start running wild, chasing rabbits and other prey. But because of their competitive attitudes and thin skin, their future looks bleak.
        -   German shepherds strike out on their own from their military base. While the males are unneutered and can pass down their bloodline, the females are spayed and cannot breed. Several German shepherds still survive, but only on small islands off the coast of California.
        -   The Queen of England's corgis thrive for six months inside the empty Buckingham palace. Fifty years later, they've escaped into the wild and bred with other dogs until their corgi line is lost. They've thrived well in Great Britain due to the extinction of more savage larger predators (like wolves and bears) and the absence of rabies.
        -   Anatolian shepherds are a rather conservative breed in a world without people, refusing to breed with other breeds of dogs that would harm their sheep, but they continue living in the wild alongside the sheep.
    -   There are plenty of cats that begin learning to survive in skyscrapers, evolving very differently. Those that still live on the ground eventually become top predators in their area, growing to the size of bobcats.
    -   Horses belonging to the New York City Police Department start roaming around the city, looking for food in garbage cans. Once the cities start to crumble, they leave the city and head to the beach, where they eventually evolve into shorter but stockier and beach-dwelling horses.
    -   Parrots escape into the wild and pass down their knowledge of human words several generations.
    -   Dairy cows struggle to survive without their human handlers milking them and helping them give birth. Those that do survive eventually escape to the prairies, where they share the grassy areas with bison.
    -   Unlike ordinary cattle, Texas longhorns survive very well without humans.
-   _My World… and Welcome to It_: After the title character (a cat) bites John in "The Saga of Dimity Ann," his exasperation leads him to sneak the feline out of the house and abandon her in the woods nearby.
