_"Professor Hogben... is unwilling to look 'egregious' up in the dictionary and see what it means."_

-   _**e·gre·gious**_ ( \\i-ˈgrē-jəs\\ IPA: /ɪˈɡriː.dʒəs/ or /əˈɡriː.dʒi.əs/)<sup>Pronounced&nbsp;</sup>  _adj._ **1** archaic : distinguished **2** : conspicuous; especially : conspicuously bad : flagrant <egregious errors>. Latin _egregius_, from _e-_ + _greg-_, _grex_ herd

You'll see this word used often, way too often, on this very wiki. It's almost as if people are looking for reasons to wedge it in, as if it were the trigger for some kind of pleasurable behavior. The word itself has become a Discredited Meme, as more instances of its use are linked to this page. Of course, some _were_ uses that were Played Straight until they were linked to this page later on.

Think of a _better_ way to say something is less than perfect. For example, notice how the article you are reading has not used that term to describe the over-wrought, clichéd, mind-numbingly bland, atrocious, annoying use of this stilted, just-plain-busted word more than once.

Now drink up!
