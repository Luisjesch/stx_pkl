_"Why do you keep doing that? Who are you talking to?!_ **_THERE'S NO ONE THERE!_**_"_

If you have a character who has Medium Awareness or is capable of Breaking the Fourth Wall, it's quite common to observe his interactions with characters who don't know they're fictional. Any time our medium-aware friend will directly address the audience or mention some boundaries of the medium, everybody else will either ignore him or act surprised and find themselves unable to understand what he's talking about. Eventually the other person will think he either is joking or has a few screws loose. Usually, no matter what he does, his efforts to make them realize they're all fictional characters will be meaningless—nobody will believe or even understand him.

Most of the time this trope is played in the same way medium awareness is in said work of fiction. If it's Played for Laughs, so is everybody's ignorance. If medium awareness is Played for Drama, this trope may add a little to it—our hero has to deal with being a fictional character _and_ everybody else thinking he's crazy. If the other characters ARE aware of their fictional nature but aren't supposed to show it, see Scolding the Fourth-Wall Breaker.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the last episode of _FLCL_, Kamon explains why manga-like scenes from the first episode didn't appear in later episodes ("It takes time and a lot of work") and why they reappeared in the last one (the creators were "accused of being lazy"). Naota has no idea what Kamon is talking about.
    -   In the first episode they have a cut to a commentary track where Haruko mentions it's really hard to do slow motion scenes because you have to hold your breath while you do it.
        
        **Naota:** That was _you?!_ I thought it was a special effect!
        
-   In the first episode of _Nyaruko: Crawling with Love! W_, Nyarko gives introductions for Tamae and Yoichi for anybody who missed the first season; in the next cut, we see Nyarko is facing the front of the classroom and Mahiro asks "Who the heck are you talking to?"
-   _Mei Company_ begins with Mei Sakuragi giving an opening narration explaining how her world works. Her friend Itsuki Mizuta then asks who she is talking to.
-   Played for Laughs in _Rosario + Vampire_, when the local Fourth-Wall Observer, Kurumu Kurono, complains to the audience that she's been shoved Out of Focus only one episode after she was introduced. This prompts the narrator bat of all people to ask the audience who she's talking to.
-   in _Etotama_, Ordinary High-School Student Takeru isn't aware in the slightest that he's in an anime, which leaves him all the more confused when the deities around him constantly shatter the fourth wall to pieces.
-   In the _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_ prequel series _Adventures of Sinbad,_ we get this after Sinbad, Mystras and Ja'far wind up naked in the wilderness.
-   _How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend_: Tomoya Aki wakes up to find Utaha Kasumigaoka in his bed. When he freaks out and asks why she is here, she says she had zero screen time in the previous episode, so she wanted to make up for it in this one. He gets confused and says he doesn't understand what she means by "screen time" and "episode".
-   In episode 22 of _Inazuma Eleven: Ares_, Chou Kinun (disguised as a bear) tells the audience to look forward to the next episode. His pupil Lee Kobun (who also wears a bear costume) asks him who he's talking to.

    Comic Books 

-   This happens to Deadpool a lot. Every time he breaks the fourth wall or indicates he knows he's a comic book character in the presence of someone else, they have absolutely no idea what he means. Most commonly the other character will respond with a Flat "What" and an assumption that he's crazy. This being Deadpool, they're probably not that far off.
    -   Subverted in _Uncanny X-Force_ #34. After saving Wolverine, Deadpool tells him that he wasn't worried about him dying because apparently "everyone knew he wasn't going to die". When Wolverine asks who's everyone, Deadpool points out to the reader, but in the next panel we find out he was actually pointing to a security camera. It turns into Mind Screw when you start wondering why the guys watching the footage of the security camera would think Wolverine was safe from dying.
-   Played for Laughs in an issue of _Damage Control_ where the characters met She-Hulk, and showed what her Medium Awareness looked like from the outside.
-   One time when She-Hulk guest starred in her cousin's book (or possibly vice versa), at the end she addressed the audience; Hulk (who was intelligent at the time) called her on it.
    
    **Hulk:** Who are you talking to?  
    **She-Hulk:** The people on the other side of the fourth wall.  
    **Hulk:** Uh, Jen? There's no wall there. _\[waves hand to demonstrate\]_ Just air.
    
-   Played straight in Grant Morrison's run on _Animal Man_. Their arc featured the main character gradually becoming aware that he is a comic character.
    -   He once wandered through Comic Limbo where different discarded characters made references to him being a character, only for him to be confused or outright dismiss them.
    -   In one issue, several DC characters wiped out during the _Crisis on Infinite Earths_ event reappeared. One character fully realized he was in a comic and pointed at the reader, claiming that "they" are enjoying the suffering of the characters and that the characters will be doomed to repeat these traumatic events every time someone reads that issue. At first, the other characters believe he's insane but they gradually see it too, eventually realizing that he was right. They don't react well. Note that this storyline alternates between being outside canon (and for good reason—imagine the Fridge Logic and Fridge Horror that would affect the DC Universe if it were) and being a mystical experience of The Multiverse that its participants could only interpret by way of a Breaking the Fourth Wall metaphor, though Morrison has dragged Meta Fiction elements into other stories such as _Final Crisis_.
    -   When he guest-stars in the _JLApe_ crossover because the Martian Manhunter needs information about morphic resonance, he's had a bit of a breakdown and his reaction is "Oh god, I'm important to the plot..." J'onn learns Buddy's view of reality via his telepathy, but decides not to share it with anyone.
-   _Monica's Gang_:
    -   This Brazilian comic has No Fourth Wall to the point of Postmodernism, their parody of _Avatar_ had this exchange:
        
        How **iwonic**! It could only be a **wwiter's** idea.  
        Writer? Who is that?  
        Oh, just an **imaginawy figuwe.**
        
    -   Also, when robots went back in time to kill Monica, Smudge and Jimmy so their descendants won't exist to revolt against robotkind, one of the robots theorized the one that came up with the idea plagiarized it from some movie.
-   The 2000AD one-shot story _It Pays To Be Mental_ had the main character (a class-D mental patient—quite harmless, released to community care) narrating to the audience. Dredd naturally considers talking to an imaginary audience quite subversive<small>◊</small> but can't touch the patient due to his mental license, leading to an Aside Glance on the part of Dredd.
-   _The Simpsons Futurama Crossover Crisis_: The first issue of the first miniseries ends with this:
    
    **Narration Box:** **Farnsworth committed! Fry trapped in the school! Nibbler's brain lactified!** Is all **lost** for the **Planet Express crew**? Are they finally, truly, totally **boned**?  
    **One of the Brain Spawn:** Yes, they **are**!  
    **Another Brain Spawn:** Who are you talking to?

-   In _High Fidelity_, protagonist Rob Gordon continually talks directly to the audience, telling his life story. Nobody seems to notice, until near the end, when he yells:
    
    **Rob:** When is this gonna stop?!  
    **Laura:** _\[who just walked in\]_ When's what gonna stop?  
    **Rob:** Uhh, nothing.
    
-   _The Truman Show_ has an In-Universe example that is Played for Drama, when Truman is the middle of an emotional breakdown and is arguing with his wife, she, smack in the middle of their argument, suddenly presenting him a cocoa drink as if she was doing advertisement for it — which she's actually doing. It only infuriates Truman and escalates the situation further as he demands for her to tell him why she is acting like that.
-   This is the plot of _Last Action Hero._ The kid from reality has to convince the character that he's inside a movie. His efforts are held back by the fact that his real world logic simply isn't relevant. That cartoon character on the force is a known and accepted part of their world, and everyone in a movie will be silver screen attractive, even random store clerks.
-   Incompetent detective McSorely from _Eat And Run_ is constantly narrating for the benefit of the audience, and on more than one occasion other characters ask who the hell he's talking to. He's not actually aware of the fourth wall, however, he's just crazy.
-   When Doctor Scott apparently talks to the viewer during the dinner scene in _The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again_, Brad gives a confused look into the camera as if he's trying to work out who Scott's talking to.

    -   There's also Flex Mentallo, who may or may not be a fictional character, who can hear and understand the Negative Spirit speaking even when no other character can.

The first time, he describes it as her suddenly seeming like she's "gone away somewhere" for a moment. On a later occasion he actually follows her gaze to look straight at the camera (but can't see anything).
-   _Odd Squad_: At the end of "A Job Well Undone", Olympia begins giving her acceptance speech for co-winning the Agent of the Month award to the audience.

    **Jordan:** I'm not on duty right now!  
    **Diego:** _\[Still talking to the fourth wall\]_ You _can?_ Well, where is he?  
    **Jordan:** What — who the fuck are you talking to?

The Grail then turns out to be under one of the seats in the audience.
-   _Westeros: An American Musical_: "Time for a Frown" is basically an analysis of the play's source material sung by a gathering of several characters. A few mentions of "George", the author of the books, leave Sansa clearly bemused.

-   Played for Drama in _The Hex_. Rust McClain, the protagonist of _Waste World_, is the only one of the six protagonists to not know he is a video game character, as is his son Rocky. When confronted with elements like Game Mods and characters asking what game he is from, he has no idea what they are talking about. The fact that he is ignorant of his game character nature means he is often left confused and lost at the things that happen in his own game, like it being unfinished or aliens being modded enemies, and feeling like he is at the mercy of something he cannot comprehend.
-   _Paper Mario_:
    -   Common in _Super Paper Mario_, where exposition dumps and tutorials will often make reference to the player sitting in front of the screen, much to the confusion of Mario and company.
    -   This is also done in _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_, as there are a couple instances of a character talking to the player, leading your partner to ask what they mean by "you in front of the TV".
-   In _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_, Raiden will be utterly confused any time a character breaks the fourth wall.

The player then has the option of doing just that, enforcing the beliefs of the NPCs and player character (but if the player refuses, the prophet bestows gifts on the hero.)
-   In _Senran Kagura: Estival Versus_, Asuka says to watch the OAV for more information about Ryōna. Homura asks who she is talking to. Asuka convinces her not to worry about it.

    **Edge:** Dude, we totally fooled the player into thinking we weren't going to reunite.  
    **Christian:** I know, we totally ... wait a minute? Player? What player?  
    **Edge:** You see that weirdo staring at us through the TV?  
    _\[Edge & Christian look right into the camera and for an added bonus, Edge waves hello to the player in question\]_  
    **Christian:** No, but I'll take your word for it.
    
-   In a secret joke event in _The New Order Last Days Of Europe_, which is inaccessible in normal gameplay and can only be unlocked through using cheats to advance through Nazi Germany's focus tree, sees Albert Speer showing up for a meeting with Adolf Hitler in his office to introduce his plans to work with the USA against Imperial Japan. But instead, he is greeted by an angry Hitler suddenly storming into the office, still wearing his nightgown, and screaming incoherently about the player being a cheater, before going on a rant about how he in, all of his years of playing _Hearts of Iron_, have never felt the need to cheat once and conquered all of Europe fair and square. Speer, quite horrified and confused at what is going on, manages to make Hitler calm down, at which the elderly Führer quietly excuses himself and walks off with a look of defeat on his face, while muttering to himself the player should just restart the game and play it without cheating this time. Speer, still utterly confused at to what Hitler was ranting about, then goes down to the basement to restart the heating system, hoping that his boss' weird outburst was just the result of a lapse in the air conditioning.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Doki Doki Literature Club!_: Though even she mostly stays in character, Monika is the only one who has a handful of fourth-wall breaking jokes. At one point, Natsuki makes a pun that only works in Japanese, and Monika complains it makes no sense in translation (as if the Animesque game is really translated, which it's not), and Natsuki is pretty confused. Another time, Monika does it by herself, as she first gives the player a tip about saving the game and then wonders out loud what she was even talking about. And then Played for Horror when it turns out that being the only game character aware of her existence has left Monika in an existential crisis, feeling like her "friends" are merely bits of code, and trying to take over the game to bond with the only real person she knows- the player.

-   In _Crossoverkill_, when the Doppleganger Gang confronts the Master Assassin - leader of the Character Assassins, a killer cult that believes they can break the fourth wall and enslave their creator by killing the "Alpha Character" — we can see how his breaking the fourth wall and addressing the reader looks from their perspective. Amusingly, Master Assassin is not _actually_ fourth-wall aware — he just thinks he is. His aside glances are as likely to go away from the reader as towards them.
    
    **Kid Apocalypse:** And what's with the kooky asides? Who's he thinks he is talking to?  
    **Syko Suki:** Dunno.
    
-   In _Drow Tales_, the first time Keil talks to the audience, a Guard asks who she's talking to. Inverted later on, when she's talking to Naal, who assumes she's talking to her imaginary friend and walks off.
-   _El Goonish Shive_ is setup wherein the filler strips have No Fourth Wall, but story arcs do, which results in most of the cast only being aware of the fourth wall on occasion. Keyword being "most". In one early instance, when Matt and Rat (two discarded characters), try to complain to Tedd about not being protagonists, he didn't know what they meant. Matt quickly deducted that it means a story arc started, so Tedd is no longer aware he that is in a comic... so forces him to break the fourth wall so they could have an argument. Said characters were subsequently treated for their shared psychosis and became productive members of society according to Word of God.
-   Every time _Mindmistress_ meets medium-aware characters, she tries to explain why it's impossible for them to be comics characters. It never works.
-   The sprite comic _Kid Radd_ uses this trope - it's about video game characters being rescued from their games and living in the internet. Sometimes it takes a while for them to adjust.
-   Done in _Gunnerkrigg Court_ by the trickster god, Coyote. He asks her to tell him stories, and the next panel is an announcement that she tells wonderful stories
    
    **Coyote:** But what was the dark secret he promised to tell her? Now we shall find out...  
    **Antimony:** Who are you even talking to?  
    **Coyote:** HAHAHA!
    
-   In _The Order of the Stick_ after telling Roy that Belkar will die before the end of the year, the Oracle specifies in an aside to the readers that he means a year in the comic, not real life, much to Roy's confusion. Despite the fact that there's usually No Fourth Wall in the comic.
-   Silas, occasional narrator of _Something\*Positive_. Mostly the other characters try their best to ignore him, but sometimes they feel the need to point out there's nobody there.
    
    **Davan:** Silas, how many times have I told you not to sit on my porch and narrate gossip to your imaginary cowpoke friends?  
    **Silas:** I'm so lonely.

    **Sage:** It's ridiculous to think that _Ninja Resurrection_ is so bad that it rendered me catatonic for two whole days... _\[aside glance\]_ isn't it?  
    **Gabe:** What the hell are you looking at?  
    **Sage:** _\[still looking at the camera\]_ Just get in the chair, Gabe.
    
-   In _SMPLive_, some characters are _very_ aware of the medium they're in... While Schlatt on the other hand is not, and will get actively upset if someone points it out.
    
    **Michael:** Did I take the roleplay too far...?  
    **Schlatt:** _Roleplay??_
    
-   Schlatt's medium unawareness actually carries over from SMPLive into _Dream SMP_ as well, which makes sense given the Character Overlap:
    
    **Schlatt:** "Let's remember this is all roleplay?" No it's not. This is real. Minecraft is real life.
    

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Duck Dodgers_ episode parodying 1970s anime, Marvin the Martian explains his motives in villainous monologue directly to the viewers, and one of his robot minions ask who he's talking to. Marvin tries to explain but fails and the robots spend the rest of the episode laughing at him.

    **Brandy:** _\[aside glance\]_ I haven't had the heart to tell her.

-   One episode from the very short-lived stop-motion Black Comedy Canadian TV series, _What It's Like Being Alone_, had one of the mutated orphans, Sammy Fishboy, suddenly becomes aware than an unseen audience is watching him and freaks out that they (us) won't leave him alone and the idea that he may cease to exist if the show ends or we change the channel. Whenever he tries to point out to the others where he's being watched, the camera pans to show him pointing at random objects and locations. The other orphans and their caretaker Aldous think he is insane and use different methods to cure his madness, including medications, being catapulted into a nearby tree, shock treatment, and dumping him in a bath filled with hundreds of leeches. Eventually, the resident sea monster patches things up by stating that Sammy's "delusions" are his imagination and that everyone else has one.
    
    **Sammy Fishboy:** Oh my god I can see you! Yeah, yeah, yeah you out there! A-am I still asleep? Why does it feel like I'm trapped in a TV show?! Why have you trapped me here while you watch, you ugly pink fleshy things with your sofas and chairs and ugly pictures on your walls! What's going on here! How did this happen!

-   Every episode of _Little Bill_ ends with Little Bill in bed, talking to the audience about his adventures that day. It always ends with a member of the family (varying each time) calling in from the hallway: "Little Bill! Who are you talking to?"
-   The sketch from _Robot Chicken_ where He-Man is accidentally killed has him addressing the audience on how trees are some of our most precious resources; Skeletor then leans into the shot and asks who he's talking to. He-Man responds, "Your face" and punches Skeletor.
-   In the _Avengers Assemble_ episode "Avengers Disassembled", Iron Man recruits Spider-Man onto the team. The others question this decision when Spidey is shown standing in the corner talking to himself, apparently expecting the fight to stop until he's finished, like it does in _Ultimate Spider-Man (2012)_.
-   Unlike other characters in _Ed, Edd n Eddy_, Jonny 2x4 for whatever reason is not aware that he is a fictional character. At the end of _Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show_, Jonny is confused when Plank tells him they haven't got time to get revenge on the other kids for an earlier slight because the movie is over.
    
    **Jonny:** There's no time left? It's the end of the movie? What movie?
    
-   _Animaniacs_ has a scene where the Warners are cornered by Mr Director, and give an Aside Glance to the audience. Mr Director wonders who they were looking at, and even presses his nose right up against the camera lens to see 'the nice people in the tee_veeee!_', yet somehow he still doesn't see anybody there.
-   _Rick and Morty_: Rick is frequently shown as a Fourth-Wall Observer, but these comments are typically ignored or found confusing by other characters. Doesn't help that said comments are often part of Rick's many rambling diatribes.
    
    **Rick:** Wake up, Morty! We're in a promo commercial! This isn't real life!  
    **Morty:** Promo commercial? What're you talking about?
    
-   _Kaeloo_: Episode 69, a _Dora the Explorer_ parody, Kaeloo tries to teach the audience to speak foreign languages by saying a word in a different language and staring at the screen waiting for the audience to repeat after her. In the middle of one such session, Stumpy walks in, sees Kaeloo standing there staring into space since he can't see the audience, and is highly confused, going so far as to wave his hand in front of her face.
-   At the end of the _Ultimate Spider-Man (2012)_ Christmas Episode "The Moon Knight Before Christmas", Spidey is wrapping up is narration when he's interrupted by Moon Knight communing with the moon. Moon Knight is surprised to learn Spidey _isn't_ talking to the moon, and when he refuses to say who he _is_ talking to, calls him a weirdo.
