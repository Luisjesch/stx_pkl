It's certainly lovely on these Princesses.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"This is_ my _apartment and I_ like _it! This is a **girls'** apartment! That \[Chandler and Joey's\] is a boys' apartment! It's dirty and it smells! This is **pretty**! It's so pretty! And look, it... and it's **purple**!"_

— **Rachel Green** (voicing her refusal to leave Monica's apartment), _Friends_, "The One With the Embryos"

A lady wearing purple as a sign of her femininity, whether she is girly and sweet, or graceful and mature.

For millennia, purple was the traditional colour of nobility because it was one of the most difficult (and thus expensive) colours to make with naturally occurring dyes. In fact, the Romans went so far as to make it a crime for anyone not of the nobility to wear purple in public, cementing its status in many cultures as the colour of The Beautiful Elite. This changed some time after the Industrial Revolution kicked into high gear, when synthetic dyes became the norm rather than the exception — as it so happens, one of the first colors made by coal-based dyes was mauve. So formerly expensive purple dye was now just as affordable as any other colour, and thus lost much of its association with wealth.

Then as colours began to take on their now-familiar gender connotations, purple found itself increasingly on the feminine side of the gender divide because it was considered a pinker version of blue. This trope is thus a merger of two associations: purple with nobility, and purple with femininity. Due to the historical significance of violets and lavenders in LGBTQ+ circles, purple can also be associated with lesbianism.

This colour is fairly common to see on a young girl, elderly and sophisticated matron, Spirited Young Lady, or princess (even if Princesses Prefer Pink). Expect the Dark Feminine in a Light Feminine and Dark Feminine pair to have deep purple colors as part of their color palette, in lieu of strictly black.

Now even though this colour can be worn by girls of any age, older feminine women are more likely to wear this colour long after a girl who wore pink grew out of that colour.

This also tends to be a popular colour among blondes as the yellow/gold of the hair and the purple of the dress complement each other.

**Just being a woman in purple isn't enough. It has to be a clearly feminine lady.**

Most of her outside artwork, namely monochrome drawings, utilize purple.

In those three incarnations she is a graceful Ojou and her femininity is part of her characterization, especially when contrasted to Minako's spunky and ditzy personality (They pretty much play Tomboy and Girly Girl in the manga). Bonus point for having purple as her secondary colour and purple eyes as well.

    -   Rapunzel of _Tangled_ wears a purple and lavender dress that complements her really long, blonde hair. In this case it's something of a plot point, as purple is one of the colors of her kingdom and she's also been subconsciously painting her room that color for years. So her preference for purple dresses is another clue that helps her work out that she's the lost princess.

    -   _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_: Hermione Granger wears lilac for Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding. It's presented as a She Cleans Up Nicely moment too. "Graceful" wouldn't be a very apt description of Molly Weasley (a short and plump Mama Bear), but she splurges on a brand new set amethyst robes for the occassion.
-   Aztec: A minor subplot. When Mixtli meets Zyanya and Beu Ribe, they are wearing blouses decorated with a "rich and permanent purple" dye. At that point, Mixtli explains that purple had been harvested from insects that lived on a certain crop and it could only be harvested once a year (and faded after numerous washings). Their father had gone to find out the source of the permanent purple, which led Mixtli on the same quest, to better albeit bittersweet results. Much later after Mixtli marries Zyanya he sells some of his stock to Tenochtitlan's elite, but his wife has more purple garments than even the Queen.

-   _Bridgerton_: Lady Agatha Danbury and Kate Sharma are famously often seen in purple dress, reflecting their fearless and feisty traits.
-   _Cobra Kai_: Samantha LaRusso predominantly sports purple/maroon/red or blue patterned outfits. She tends to wears those colors whenever things are happening between her and Miguel, blue being the color of Miyagi-Do (Samantha) and red being the color of Johnny's Cobra Kai/Eagle Fang (Miguel). Their relationship is literally the glue between the dojos, and so her wardrobe colors are the mixture of these two colors.
-   _Doctor Who_: When Rose Tyler has her body stolen by the vain skin-flap Lady Cassandra, she quickly doffs her blue track jacket in favour of her purple-patterned blouse underneath. While certainly being more mature and graceful than Rose, Cassandra is a rather dark example. She is something akin to the Femme Fatale archetype with some extreme-right white supremacist mixed in.
-   _Downton Abbey_: Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (played by Maggie Smith), is quite feminine (in a Grande Dame sort of way) and is hardly ever seen in any colour _but_ purple except when in mourning or in her nightgown.

-   _How I Met Your Mother_: The titular mother wears a purple sundress when first introduced to the audience. And when she finally meets Ted, she's wearing a purple dress under her raincoat.

    _When I am an old woman I shall wear purple  
    With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me.  
    And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves  
    And satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter._

-   Trish Stratus in her 2002-2004 period - notably when she was trying to move away from her Ms. Fanservice status - wore lots of variations of purple and blue on her gear. She never seemed to like pink, so purple was the most feminine colour she wore. And funnily enough, she teamed with Ivory a few times in this period.

    Puppet Shows 

-   On _The Muppet Show_, Miss Piggy is never seen without a pair of lavender High-Class Gloves. She is the very definition of delicate, graceful femininity, and will punch out the lights of anyone who says otherwise.

-   _Galaxy Angel_: Forte Stollen is a zigzagged example. She has purple as her main color, but despite being the oldest and most mature of the Angels, she's also the least feminine, being a tomboy with short hair and a love for firearms. On the other hand, when she dresses up for the Fargo ball, she picks a purple dress that definitely fits for the "mature and elegant" type of beauty associated with this trope.

Interestingly, it is also a Color Motif, seeing the purple, besides being the color of royalty and materialism (in which wealth is associated), is also the color of insanity, fitting since she is mentally ill.
