"_Arachnoid — the 8 legged wonder of the world. Whether firing off his electricity shots or dropping off smaller enemy spiders, this Mecha-Spider will keep you on your toes._"

Sometimes in fiction there's an overlap of bugs and machines being mixed into one new type of being: Robo-Bugs. These robo-bugs have what you call the best of both worlds: multiple limbs and visors/eyes, sometimes they have wings and other body parts that only bugs have. These critters usually will appear being employed as Mecha Mooks by the villains or have antagonistic roles, though that does not mean that necessarily all examples will be evil-aligned or antagonistic.

Generally speaking, the main reason for the trope's usage might be rooted in that both bugs and robots are both usually seen as uncanny by many people and that the bugs' different anatomy to vertebrates might make them look off compared to all other living beings. Sometimes an inversion might be found with bugs which have robot-like characteristics or become cyborgs, though these tend to overlap with other tropes.

Further, arthropods' exoskeletons and segmented limbs and bodies translate better to a robotic design than vertebrates' flexible skin and smoother outlines tend to. Even a robot that is not explicitly designed to resemble an arthropod can still bring one to mind through its plated outer armor, many-jointed limbs, and featureless eyes. At the very least, it's going to resemble some kind of insect more than it's likely to resemble a lizard, bird or mammal.

Another reason for this trope's usage is that one of the main issues with building robots is stability: two-legged robots tend to tip over very easily, and while wheels and tracks are more stable they also don't do too well on uneven terrain. Multiple legs solve both issues at once, and most real-life robots tend to have four or six walking limbs.

Can be considered a subtrope of Starfish Robots, Mechanical Lifeforms, and Mechanical Animals. Super-trope to Literal Surveillance Bug, which specifically covers ones employed for espionage. Also compare to Insectoid Aliens, Mechanical Horse, Mechanical Monster and Robot Dog. Larger specimens may overlap with Spider Tank.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Appleseed_: The fourth volume features arachnid robots with distinct abdomens that are almost entirely made up of a minigun and its absurdly large ammo drum.
-   _Digimon_: Many Digimon in the franchise are robotic-based, with a few individuals standing out in the anime adaptations:
    -   _Digimon Frontier_: Trailmon Worm is a living Digimon train with the features of insects such as multiple eyes and a segmented body (serving as the "cars"). Beetlemon's Beast Hybrid Form, MetalKabuterimon mixes Beetlemon's humanoid beetle features with that of an army tank, with cannons in his hands and tracks instead of legs.
    -   _Digimon Fusion_: Ballistamon is a humanoid robotic Digimon who's modeled after hercules beetles.

    Comic Books 

-   _Spider-Man_: A few of the Spider-Slayer robots were based on spiders, namely the Mark II, Mark III and Mark VI models.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Animatrix_: In "The Second Renaissance", the Machines are first shown as humanoid robots designed for simple labor; as they attain sentience and begin forming a more complex society, their forms evolve into the more efficient, insectoid Machines seen in the _Matrix_ trilogy.
-   _Wreck-It Ralph_: The Cy-Bugs (pictured above) are a very literal example of the trope, as they're a swarm of bugs with technological characteristics.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Matrix Revolutions_: As Neo is walking through the machine city, a number of insect-like robots crawl out of the walls and follow him.
-   _Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie_: Ivan Ooze's Ecto-Morphicon Titans, Hornitor and Scorpitron, are robotic bugs. As their names imply, they are based on a hornet and scorpion, respectively.
-   _Minority Report_: The Bureau of Precrime can send small, spiderlike drones into an apartment building to scan the retinas of its occupants. The little spider-bots typically swarm in by the hundreds, crawling up the bodies of many residents to scan their retinas for identification. Most people are aware of them, and wisely let the bots do their jobs, since interference constitutes a crime.
-   _Star Wars_: In the prequel trilogy, the Confederacy's droid armies include a number of arthropod-like models.
    -   Spider droids are spherical robots with four jointed legs arranged equidistantly around their midsections and powerful laser guns mounted on their fronts (for the small ones) or undersides (for the large ones).
    -   Crab droids have larger, jointed legs and rust-red, exoskeleton-like plating. They're mostly melee fighters that grapple and beat at their enemies.
    -   The droideka, who serve as the Confederacy's elite heavy infantry, look like mechanical scorpions, with a pair of twin blaster cannons instead of claws and a curved, forward-facing back plate with a sensor head that resembles a stinger tail. In the _Star Wars Legends_ continuity, they were modeled after their creators, a carnivorous Insectoid Alien species called the Colicoids (this fact got recanonized in the book _Ultimate Star Wars_).
-   The _Transformers Film Series_ films has its own version of the Insecticons, which are insect-sized drones used for espionage, search, and repair work.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_: The Bug Fighter is the standard Yeerk combat ship, resembling a headless cockroach with two spear-like protusions for energy weapons.
-   _The Dark Side of the Sun_: The planet Laoth is deliberately kept sterile, so its inhabitants created an ecosystem of robot life, including insects.
-   _The Spiderwick Chronicles_: The field guide has an illustration of a clockwork cave cricket built by dwarves.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Black Mirror_: In "Hated in the Nation", after the bees went nearly extinct, many countries utilized Automatic Drone Insects (ADI for short) to carry out pollination. These drones are capable of self-replicating and building hives on their own, with these hives featuring 3D printing devices (which falls short, as they are unable to make honey). They are also used by government to spy on the populace, and were hacked to kill anyone who was voted to be killed on Twitter through the use of the #DeathTo hashtag. The real targets are not the hashtag targets, but those who _used_ the hashtag.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   _Kamen Rider Kabuto_ has them in the form of the Zecters, small robots in the forms of creepy crawlies such as Rhinoceros and Stag Beetle, Bee, Dragonfly, Scorpion, two kinds of Grasshoppers, and three other kinds of Beetles (Hercules, Centaur, and Caucasus) for the movie.
    -   _Kamen Rider Zero-One_ has a giant robot grasshopper that shows up and becomes armor whenever Aruto transforms into his Rising Hopper form, as well as a second one for Shining Hopper, a ton of tiny little ones for Metal Cluster Hopper, and two of them for Kamen Rider Zero-Two. Hororbi also has a giant robot scorpion filling the same purpose, and Gai has a Hercules Beetle show up alongside his Arsinotherium during his own transformation sequence.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Power Rangers Lost Galaxy_: The Scorpion Stinger, the ship used by the villains, has the body and wings of a dragon fly and scorpion's tail.
    -   _Power Rangers Ninja Storm_: The Crimson Insectizord and Navy Beetlezord are based on a rhino beetle and stag beetle respectively, matching the Animal Motifs of their owners, the Thunder Rangers. On the villain side, their is Marah's Marahzord, a pink, humanoid robot with insect-like eyes.
    -   _Power Rangers Beast Morphers_: Steel is a robot based on a scarab.
-   _Stargate SG-1_ features the Replicators, who are primarily found as a swarm of insect- or spider-shaped things composed of thousands of metal 'blocks'. Each block in turn contains millions of Applied Phlebotinum circuits, allowing the Replicators to not only reassemble themselves or combine with each other in a myriad frightening ways, but interface with and take control of anyone else's technology with truly terrifying speed. When moving in large numbers (and they're _always_ in large numbers, or will be very quickly) they make a very distinctive metallic chittering sounds. In any episode where that sound is heard, expect things to rapidly get worse.
-   _Super Sentai_:
    -   _Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger_: Gourai Beetle and Gourai Stag are based on a rhino beetle and stag beetle respectively. The former is a large tank while the latter has the appearance of an armored monster truck. On the villain side we have Pretty-Girl Ninja Furabijenu and Karakuri Giant FurabijenRobo which were created and piloted by Furabiijo.
    -   _Tokumei Sentai Go Busters_: Beet J. Stag is one of the Buddyroids, machines which serve as robot companions for the team and transform into their mechs. Beet is based on a stag beetle.
    -   _Ohsama Sentai King-Ohger_: The Shugods are the first group of mechs to be based entirely on insects, as opposed to just two for the extra Sentai members.
-   _The X-Files_: In "War of the Coprophages", the inhabitants of a small town are seemingly being attacked and killed by cockroaches. The deaths all turn out to have mundane explanations, but they do discover something more bizarre: some of the cockroaches in town prove to be robots with metal exoskeletons, which an expert in the field declares to be far more advanced than anything he's ever seen. It's never confirmed where they come from, but Mulder suspects they may be alien surveillance drones.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Clockwork horrors are mechanical spider-like constructs about two feet across that live in large swarms, where their role and status is determined by the metal they're made out of — electrum ones are soldiers, gold ones commanders, platinum ones generals, and a single adamantine horror rules the swarm. They reproduce by consuming metal and using it to construct new swarm members. They're extremely efficient at this; if a swarm is allowed to grow unchecked, it can quickly strip a city of metal and go on to threaten the rest of the country.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_ has a number of this, mostly typed as artifact creatures and as insects; they're especially common in the biomechanical planes of Phyrexia and Mirrodin. There's some considerable variety, both in constitution (clockwork creatures, robots and magically-animated metal are all present) and in species (ants, beetles, gnats, mantises, millipedes and ticks are all represented).
-   _Mindjammer_: Venu forces use spider-shaped war robots that can climb walls and are adept at moving in zero-G environments.
-   _Pathfinder_: Some robot models resemble arthropods to various degree. The arachnid robots are essentially dog-sized, mechanical scorpions, with a welding torch instead of a stinger and a pair of gripping claws. Annihilators are much larger and more stylized but follow a similar model, and have laser weapons on their tails.
-   _Transhuman Space_: Some microbots in this setting resemble insects, usually as a simple matter of form following function — tiny legged or winged robots have many uses, and will invariably end up looking a bit insectoid — but sometimes no doubt because they are used for espionage, and looking like an insect is a useful disguise. Some larger robots (such as "tech spiders") have somewhat insectoid or arachnoid forms, too.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: The Canoptek constructs created by the Necrons to act as Attack Drones, and caretakers of their Tomb Worlds, are typically crafted to resemble extremely large insects. Beetles (Canoptic Scarabs), spiders (Canoptek Spyders) and centipedes (Tomb Stalkers) are some of the more recognisable forms that these robotic creatures can take, but even the stranger looking constructs such as Canoptek Wraiths and Reanimators have forms based loosely on insectoid life (spider-snake and water strider-Martian tripod hybrids respectively).
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: The Digital Bug archetype has trait of this, as the bugs in the archetype have a lot of digital-covered body parts and are mechanical in appearance. They also simultaneously reference how errors in computers are called "bugs" as their lore has them as inhabitants of the inside of a computer.

    Toys 

-   Many toys of robot bugs have been made. Among the most popular examples being the Hexbugs, which are designed after ticks and minuscule bugs and are placed inside mazes for them to complete.
-   _LEGO_:
    -   The _Insectoids_ run centered around building enormous mechanical bugs. However, these bugs were actually vehicles for colonists on a hostile alien planet, who designed them to resemble bugs in order to blend in with the massive predatory insects native to the planet.
    -   _BIONICLE_: Some of the semi-mechanical wildlife look like giant bugs, such as the dragonfly-like Nui Rama, the beetle-like Bohrok (which are 100% mechanical aside from their Krana), and the spider-like Visorak.
    -   Similar to _Insectoids_, _LEGO Galaxy Squad_ features insect-based vehicles, but this time, they're piloted by _actual_ Insectoid Aliens and visually blur the line between mechanical and organic.
-   _Transformers_: Shows up with a few characters, but the ones that fit the description best are the Insecticons, Kickback, Bombshell, and Skrapnel. According to their bios they may even be a separate species from normal Cybertronians. Transmetals and Transmetals 2 increased the robotic appearances of Waspinator, Blackarachnia, and Tarantulus from _Beast Wars_.

    Video Games 

-   _Bug Fables_: Bee-Boops are robotic drones modelled after the non-anthropomorphic bees whose purpose is to protect the Honey Factory against the intruders. Unfortunately, due to Code 32 being in effect, they now interpret anyone as an intruder. There is also a larger version of Bee-Boop called Heavy Drone B-33, whose purpose is to protect the factory core itself, and it serves as the main boss of Chapter 3.
-   _Clockwords_: The rival inventor sends mechanical bugs that look like brown spiders and climb on bookshelves to steal the inventor's documents.
-   _Dawn of War_:
    -   Builder Scarabs are, well, builders that summon Necron structures. They also have a long detection range and are the only unit in the Necron army that can capture strategic points.
    -   Tomb Spyders are spider-like constructs that serve as the Necron's melee vehicle. Uniquely, they aren't contructed but exist as corpses around the Monolith when the game starts and are resurrected where they fell. They can also harvest dead units to reassemble them into replacement squads (somehow) and spawn Scarabs, swarms of machines that can overwhelm enemies (and in _Soulstorm_, serve as the Necrons' flyers).
-   _Donkey Kong Country_:
    -   In _Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!_, Buzzes are robotic bees created by Baron K. Roolenstein that replace the organic Zingers from the previous two games. They come in two colors; green and red. The green Buzzes can be defeated by regular barrels and certain animal buddies, but the red Buzzes can only be defeated by TNT barrels or the invincibility barrel.
    -   In _Donkey Kong 64_, Mecha-Zingers are robotic versions of Zingers that inhabit Frantic Factory and also briefly appear in a mini-game in Hideout Helm. They drop orange grenades and must be shot with a weapon two times to be defeated, except for Chunky's pineapple launcher, which is twice as powerful.
-   _Freedom Planet_ has several insect-like robots appearing as enemies in the game. There are Dragonflies, aerial robots modelled after their namesakes; Fireflies, who attack with electric light bulbs in their heads; Stingers, green wasp-like robots that attack in huge swarms especially if disturbed in their nests; Wretchnid, a spider-like robot that serves as the Mini-Boss and is encountered in the first stage of the game; and Mantalith, an ancient construct modelled after the praying mantis that attacks with its massive claws or biting its victims, and serves as the end boss of the Stage 2.
-   _Freedom Wars_: The Paradoxa-class Abductors are giant, armored, robot spiders that shed their armor for speed when enough damage is dealt. Not only do they fire sticky webs with their rear cannons, they fire missiles willy-nilly with their missile pods.
-   _Heroes of the Storm_: One of Anub'arak's skins turns him into a mecha-scarab.
-   _Horizon Zero Dawn_: Corruptors are large, scorpion-like robots mounted on four legs and armed with clamps on the tips of their tails and grenade launchers mounted on their backs.
-   _Machine Hunter_: The Type-1 Exterminators. the first type of robot Machine Hunters can possess, are robotic spiders. Originally created for pest extermination, they've been reprogrammed by the aliens as weapons with dual machine-guns on their sides, but players can hijack these robots for themselves.
-   _Mass Effect 2:_ The Collectors are formerly members of the insectoid Prothean race that were given Unwilling Roboticisation to serve as soldiers for the Reapers. In addition, they all use a number of insectoid and insect-like weapons, such as "Seeker" swarms which bite and immobilize their targets without killing them, allowing the Collectors to abduct subjects en masse for experimentation and Reaper conversion.
-   _Mario Party 6_: The battle mini-game "Insectiride" has players control four different bug-like vehicles, each with their own button mechanic.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   _Mega Man (Classic)_: Several of the Mecha-Mooks in the series are based off insects and arthropods, such as the Yambow dragonflies in _3_, the giant centipedes in _Mega Man & Bass_, and even Hornet Man's drones from _Mega Man 9_, the last of which can be utilized by the player as the Hornet Chaser.
    -   _Mega Man X_: A number of the series' Mavericks are robotic Funny Animals, several of which are based on arthropods. Many of the mechaniloid mooks count as well, such as the bees and Bospider from _X_, the dragonfly and caterpillar enemies in Neon Tiger's stage from _X3_, or the hornets and spiders in Web Spider's stage from _X4_.
-   _Mother 3_: One of the first enemies you encounter are Fire Flies which are mechanical bugs that have the ability to breathe fire and are used to set fire to Sunshine Forest in the first chapter.
-   _Pokémon Black and White_: Genesect is not only a metallic bug, but also a prehistoric insect that was revived and given robotic enhancements by Team Plasma to make the most powerful Pokémon ever. Giving it different "drives" allows it to change the type of its signature move Techno Blast, and it can fold its limbs to transform into a flying saucer.
-   _Polyroll_: The boss of the Digital Mind world is a giant mechanical spider. During its first form, it can only be damaged by standing on three different floppy disks until they are inserted into the corresponding drives, all while dodging laser attacks. Each floppy disk activates the circuit of the spider's web once to electrocute it.
-   _Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando_: One of the enemies that shows up in the Joba Megacorp Games is the Nidbot, a small robotic spider that comes in swarms and attacks Ratchet by leaping at him. In addition, one of the bosses in the same arena is the Arachnoid, a much larger robotic spider that shoots electricity and can spawn Nidbots.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_: These are common mooks that Sonic faces, ranging from weak to somewhat tough ones. Motobugs are robotic ladybugs that run on one wheel and are generally easy to destroy, Buzz Bombers are robotic wasps that shoot lasers from their thoraxes, Caterkillers are robotic caterpillars that scatter if Sonic hits one of their body segments rather than their heads, and Grabbers are robotic spiders that grab Sonic in their legs and explode after they catch him.
-   _Spyro: Year of the Dragon_: The level "Bugbot Factory", in which the player controls Spyro's dragonfly sidekick Sparx, features various robotic bugs as enemies. The final boss is a giant (from Sparx's perspective) mechanical centipede.
-   _Star Fox_: A number of enemies across the games are these, most notably the Aparoids, which are an entire race of mechanical insects out to assimilate all life in the Lylat System.
-   _Stellaris_: With the _Synthetic Dawn_ expansion, each major species archetype (mammalian, fungoid, etc.) will build robots loosely themed after themselves. As such, the insectoid model resembles a floating, mechanical arthropod. However, the plantoid and necroid models also use arthropod-like forms, standing on multiple legs.
-   _Super Mario Odyssey_ has Mechawiggler, which is a robotic version of Wiggler, a recurring caterpillar enemy in _Super Mario Bros._ series. It serves as the boss of the Metro Kingdom, and it absorbs the electricity of New Donk City from the lightning rod. During the battle, it fires a lot of electrical spheres at Mario and charges at him by warping through the portals. To destroy it, Mario must capture a nearby Sherm and use its cannonballs to depower all its segments and then shoot at it while it's vulnerable.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_: A few of the various types of Mechon have very bug-like appearances, such as the M42 Scout Units or the M91/DOGMA

    Western Animation 

-   _Action Man (2000)_: Dr. X has the Trilobugs; mechanical insects that can be used for various purposes, like spying on his enemies, hacking computers or (when in large enough numbers) attacking opponents. Dr. X. later also introduces a microscopic variation of the bugs called Nano-Trilobugs, which can infect and control electronic systems, or even infect people. And in the episode "Search and Destroy", X builds a large, heavily weaponized version specifically for tracking down and killing Action Man.
-   _Aladdin: The Series_: The villain Mechanicles builds Clock Punk robot insects to help in commiting his crimes.
-   The eponymous menace in the _Justice League Unlimited_ episode "Dark Heart" is an invasive nanite swarm superweapon whose drones take the form of robotic insects as they work to consume all available resources of a planet.
-   _My Life as a Teenage Robot_: The Cluster are a race of humanoid robots with insect-like characteristics. Their queen, Vexus, is designed after beetles with wings on her back, antennae and serves as the "Hive Queen" of her race. At least until her daughter, Vega, overthrows her.
-   _Rollbots_: The Spiderbots are spider-themed and very large rollbots that desire to wage war with the inhabitants of Flip City. The series' Big Bad is a spiderbot named Vertex.
-   _Samurai Jack_: Aku's primary Mooks, the Beetle-Drones are bug-like hordes of robots initially designed after Hercules beetles, and in Season 5, after stag beetles, later on, large mantis variants named Mantoids are seen. Many other robo-bugs appear in the series, though usually they seem organic until a Robotic Reveal (mainly due to censorship laws). A benevolent bug-like robot, Chitron 6 appears in Episode XLVII but is killed by Aku.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: In "Darkness on Umbara", the Umbarans release a small, scuttling six-legged root called a millicreep among the troopers, throwing them into confusion as its darts among their feet and fatally electrocutes several of them by touching them with its long, electrified tail.
-   In one episode of _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)_, Shredder and Krang unleash a swarm of insect-like devices capable of taking control of any machine, causing chaos throughout the city.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_: Spy-Roach starts out as a cockroach that Donatello attached cameras to. After getting exposed to mutagen it transforms into a cockroach Hollywood Cyborg.
-   _Totally Spies!_: In "Spies Vs. Spies", the protagonists end up tied in a giant web made by a large spider robot, which then crawls over them and sprays them with a liquid material which hardens into a cocoon.
-   _Transformers: Prime_:
    -   While she lacks an outright beast form like Blackarachnia and the Insecticons, Airachnid has a very noticeable spider motif, from her additional legs right down to the webs she uses.
    -   The _Prime_ incarnation of the Insecticons reinvents them as a swarm of hulking, insectoid bruisers that transform into equally gigantic mechanical rhinoceros beetles.
-   _Wakfu_: Noxines used by Noximilien to harvest the titular Life Energy and surveil the protagonists.
