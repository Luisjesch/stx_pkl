_"Leonard, I platonically love you, man..."_

True Companions are very important to most heroes. After overcoming many obstacles and growing closer, one character might tell another (usually same-sex but doesn't need to be, and can also be directed towards a small group of characters) they love them (sometimes dramatically, sometimes nonchalantly). They usually don't need to elaborate because the meaning is clear. Their friendship is strong to the point that it can be described as a type of love. The most important thing is that there is no romantic suggestion between the two characters (at least at this point in the series). This can also happen between family, who are expected by nature to have platonic love for each other.

Sub-Trope of Love Confession. May overlap with Heterosexual Life-Partners or Anguished/Dying Declaration of Love. Related to Platonic Life-Partners but doesn't necessarily have to overlap. For some examples, this might cross over with Friendship Song, Platonic Valentine, or Parental Love Song.

-   One chapter of _Ayakashi Triangle_ has Matsuri making an emotional spectacle in stating how important his senpai Soga is to him. It's played for equals parts humor and pathos, mostly playing on the romantic overtones between the two Matsuri remains completely oblivious to.
-   In the last episode _Digimon Adventure_, The Digidestined get to spend some time alone with their partners before they have to head home. In the dub, Izzy uses some of his time to tell Tentomon that he loves him, causing Tentomon to fall over in surprise. Once he recovers from Izzy's uncharacteristic "sudden display of emotion," they share a hug.
-   In _Digimon Frontier_, one of the first things Junpei does after fighting a particularly harrowing battle with an Enemy Within is to tell his friends how much he loves them. Funnily enough, this is a straight instance that also involves a romantic love interest: Izumi, the girl that Junpei has a crush on.
-   At the end of the first two seasons of _Dog Days_, Cinque declares to Millhiore and Rebecca respectively that he loves them. Although both girls _are_ romantically interested in him, he wishes to develop himself further as an athlete (and Champion) before trying to pursue _any_ romantic relationship. But they're both very important to him, so he still wants them to know that.

This is also an example of Love Confessor, as he tells this to Hekat, not Hanochek.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the Grand Finale of _30 Rock_, Jack _attempts_ to give one of these to Liz.
    
    **Jack:** Lemon, there is a word, a once special word that's been tragically co-opted by the romance industrial complex, and I would hate to use it here and have you think that I am suggesting any type of romantic sentiment, let alone an invitation to scale bone mountain. It's a word that comes to us by way of the old high German "luba" from the Latin "lubera" meaning "to be pleasing." So I'm going to use this word to describe how I feel about you in the way that our Anglo-Saxon forefathers would have used it in reference to say "hot bowl of bear meat" or "your enemy's skull split."  
    **Liz:** I love you too, Jack.

    -   Kitty tells Sherlock, "Do you know what I haven't said to anyone in a really long time? I love you. Isn't that the saddest thing?" on the phone before hanging up in the airport, escaping before she can be arrested for kidnapping and disfiguring her rapist.
    -   In the sixth season finale, Sherlock takes the fall for a murder Joan was falsely accused of committing and, as a result, has to return to England for good. Before he leaves he tells her they're more than just partners — they're "two people who love each other".
-   _Frasier_:
    -   Roz's latest boyfriend dumps her after she tells him she loves him (a pattern he's repeated many times). While consoling her, Frasier assures her that most men won't do this and would say it back. Roz tests the theory by telling Frasier she loves him, in what's clearly a platonic way, and Frasier immediately reciprocates.
    -   This is a plot point in the episode "Breaking the Ice", where Martin can platonically say "I love you" to his dog Eddie or his friend Duke, but can't actually say it to his sons Frasier and Niles. Martin tries claiming that he says "I love _ya_" to Eddie and Duke, but the boys don't buy it.
    -   In the episode "Back Talk". Daphne is getting married soon, and Frasier laments that she will be moving out soon and he'll miss her. He means it perfectly platonically, but Daphne overhears and thinks he is in love with her. After the confusion is sorted out, they have this conversation.
        
        **Daphne:** _\[hopefully\]_ Then you don't love me?  
        **Frasier:** Oh, no, of course I love you, Daphne, but… as a friend, that's all.
        
-   On _The Goldbergs_, Adam delivers several of these to his Platonic Life-Partners: Emmy. Most notably in "Muscles Mirsky", Barry tries to convince him that they just can't be friends. When it goes horribly wrong, he rushes to her house to say that he _does_ love her, but it's like a sibling.
-   _How I Met Your Mother:_ In "Little Minnesota", Robin is feeling down as she can't go home for the holidays, and Marshall gets her thrown out of a bar that reminds her of Canada because he was jealous of the attention she was getting. He later finds her eating ice cream on her doorstep and they reconcile, with him giving her one of these.
    
    **Marshall:** I'm so sorry for what happened back there. I—I acted like a total jerk. I... I shouldn't have said anything.  
    **Robin:** No, look, I'm sorry. That was your place. I shouldn't have tried to make it mine. It's just every year at the holidays, I get homesick. And so far, every year I've had a reason to stay—a boyfriend, a job… or something. But this year for this first time, I don't.  
    **Marshall:** Yes you do.  
    **Robin:** What?  
    **Marshall:** We all love you, okay? If you ever moved back to Canada, we would hop on a plane, we would track you down and, after Barney dragged us to a few of those strip clubs you talked about, we would bring you back here. Right where you're supposed to be. It's not New York without Robin Scherbatsky.  
    **Robin:** Thanks.
    
-   _Jessica Jones (2015)_ uses this as a key word to prove she's not under mind control when speaking to her friend/adoptive sister Trish, as it's something she'd never normally say. Doesn't make it seem any less sincere or true.
-   On _Last Man Standing_, Ed doesn't say such things directly to Kyle, the lovable goofball employee who eventually becomes protagonist Mike's son-in-law. However, he _does_ say them to Mike _about_ Kyle; in one episode, he mentions that he's putting Kyle in his will because he's "the closest thing I'll ever have to a son," and in another, he outright states that "I love that boy like he's my own son."
    -   Kyle, meanwhile, idolizes his father-in-law, "Mr. B," and cheerfully misinterprets a comment in one episode to think Mike is saying-without-saying that he loves him. "I love you too, Mr. B!"
-   _Legion_: In the series finale, Charles Xavier reassures his son David that he does love him even though David in this timeline was given up for adoption. Now that an Alternate Timeline is being created, Charles vows that he'll raise David and be the father that he should've been.
    
    **Charles:** David. I wasn't there for you. You needed me, your mother, and we gave you away. I can't imagine doing it, but I _adore_ you, David, and that will _never_ change. I could only have done it to _protect_ you.  
    **David:** I was a baby.  
    **Charles:** I'll never know what that's like, the pain of it, to be abandoned. But I am here now, and I want to make it right. So, please, my darling boy, let me be your father.
    
-   Played for Laughs, in _The Mighty Boosh_ when Howard tells Vince he loves him, assuming they're both going to die. Vince proceeds to laugh at how out of the blue it seems and admits he loves Howard too. Though Howard claims Vince's confession doesn't count because he said it first.
-   _Monk_:
    -   "Mr. Monk Goes to Mexico": when Captain Stottlemeyer, Monk's Friend on the Force, gets the (erroneous) report that he's been killed, he tells Randy that he will resign if Monk doesn't get a police funeral with full honors (despite having been discharged from the force) and declares, "I'm going to tell you something, Randy, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I loved that man." A few minutes later, he gets the news that it was a lookalike and not Monk who was killed, and his mood flip-flops:
        
        **Stottlemeyer:** I hate that man!
        
    -   "Mr. Monk and the Three Pies": Monk is trying to walk out of his estranged brother's life again when Ambrose says that he loves him. Monk, having been controlling his irritation the entire episode, snaps, saying that people who love each other don't wait seven years between phone calls, especially when one of them is having a tough time.
    -   "Mr. Monk Makes a Friend": When Stottlemeyer, Disher, and Natalie confront Hal, he asks why they're concerning themselves in his relationship with Monk. Natalie answers that it's because they love him.
-   Serves as a Crowning Moment of Heartwarming in one episode of _NUMB3RS_ for David Sinclair and his childhood friend Ben Ellis, who had been at odds for several decades following the death of another friend (David blamed Ben for getting their friend killed, and Ben resented David for abandoning him and never giving him a chance to tell his side of the story). At the end of the episode, after they've sorted out their problems, David hugs Ben and tells him, "Love you, brother."
-   Played for Laughs in the _Seinfeld_ episode "The Serenity Now," when Jerry starts demonstrating real emotions and suddenly starts telling George that he loves him. Given the nature of the show, George is severely creeped out. (By contrast, Kramer responds to the same declaration from Jerry with a casual "I love you too, buddy.")
-   _Sherlock_: In "The Sign of Three" during a flashback when John asks Sherlock to be the best man, he also says that he wants to spend his day with the two people he loves most — which, are, obviously, Mary and Sherlock — and Sherlock's not getting it. Sherlock is so surprised when John actually tells him that he's rendered speechless for the next few minutes.
-   _Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt_, Kimmy admits she loves her friend Cindy during one of her first crying fits. Probably hard not to love someone you were locked up in a bunker with for 15 years; although in this case the two characters probably have slept together, it's still definitely a platonic confession.
-   _USA High_: As Lazz prepares to leave the school for good, Big Man on Campus Jackson is reluctant to say something but eventually...
    
    **Jackson:** I'm not used to saying this to another guy... but I really love you.
    
-   In the _Voyagers!_ episode "The Trial of Phineas Bogg", Drake accuses Bogg of endangering Jeffrey during their time-travel experiences. Bogg responds that he loves Jeffrey and wouldn't let anything hurt him. As Bogg said in an earlier episode that he would like to be able to say Jeffrey was his son, it's pretty clear it isn't sexual.
-   In the first season of _Who Wants to Be a Superhero?_, when it gets down to the final three contestants, they have an emotional moment in which they share a group hug. Feedback warmly tells Fat Momma and Major Victory that "I love you so much."
-   In the second season of _The Witcher (2019)_, Ciri has a conversation with Yennefer in which she describes Geralt as being "the father I never had," and says that she loves him. Geralt, for his part, never actually says the words, but by the end of the season he acknowledges that Ciri is effectively his daughter; when asked by a friend if she is his, he nods and says, "Mine." He also tells Ciri directly that they are family.

    Music 

-   "You Light Up My Life" is a fairly chaste love song, with no sex even implied, which is why many religious groups, including Debby Boone, had it as a paean to Jesus. The song could apply to a spouse, sibling, son, daughter, favorite great-aunt, whoever.
-   In some versions of the song, the singer of "Danny Boy" is Danny's father, bidding goodbye to his youngest son as he goes off to war. In these variations, the lines about love are platonic.
    
    _Oh Danny Boy,  
    Oh, Danny Boy  
    I love you so._
    
-   In Relient K's song "You'll Always Be My Best Friend," the singer promises to love the person he's singing to (which the title would indicate is a friend, not a love interest.)
-   Queen's "You're My Best Friend".
    
    Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had  
    I've been with you such a long time  
    You're my sunshine and I want you to know  
    That my feelings are true  
    I really love you  
    Oh, you're my best friend
    
-   Olivia Rodrigo's "hope ur ok" ends with one to her old friends she hasn't seen in a long time, but still worries about.
    
    _I love you, and I hope that you're okay._
    
-   Taylor Swift's "seven" says, "Love you to the moon and to Saturn" to a childhood friend.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Fraggle Rock_: "Wembley's Egg" has Wembley taking it on himself to sit on an egg that has fallen into the pond and take care of the "tree creature" (bird) that hatches from it. The creature is devoted to Wembley and calls him "Mama", but Wembley peeks into the Gorgs' garden and sees the tree creature's parents crying for their baby. When Wembley makes the very difficult decision of returning the baby to its parents, he tearfully declares his love for the creature as the two of them share a hug.
    
    **Wembley:** I'm taking good care of you, aren't I? And we love each other. And... and you give my life meaning... like in Boober's book.
    

    Theatre 

-   In _The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_, Tom's Aunt Polly promises her sleeping nephew that:
    
    One thing is certain  
    No matter what you do  
    This time tomorrow  
    I will still be loving you.
    

    Video Games 

-   _Bungo to Alchemist_: Hagiwara Sakutarō and Murō Saisei are best friends described as "two souls in one body", with the former emotionally relying on the latter and the latter fiercely protective of the former. Of course, that's basically asking for this gem from the former in their recollection after the latter comforts him and reminds him of his worth:
    
    **Saku:** Sai…! Aah, I love you so much! I'm so glad you were born!
    
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins_:
        -   Both Alistair and Leliana may, at different points, tell the Warden that they love him/her even if they haven't been romanced. Sten, in his own odd way, may also say it, not least by calling the Warden _kadan_ (a Qunari word meaning someone "close to the heart").
        -   During the Human Noble Origin, there are multiple points at which the Warden's mother and father tell their younger child that they love him/her, and the player has the option to say it back to them.
    -   _Dragon Age II_:
        -   At the conclusion of the quest "All That Remains," Hawke's mother dies after she says, "I love you. You've always made me so proud." Hawke may also, before or after this quest, find a note in their bedroom that amounts to the same wording.
        -   If Hawke's sister Bethany is sent to the Circle of Magi and is fighting alongside her elder sibling in the final battle, Hawke can speak to her (as they can speak to all of their companions) just before the last fight. Bethany, generally regarded as the sweetest character in the game, has a moment of this during the conversation.
            
            "If we don't survive this, brother/sister, I just want you to know that I love you."
            
        -   Alternately, if Carver is the surviving twin and is present for the battle, he says it — in his own way.
            
            "I'm proud to call you brother/sister. That's gone unsaid for too long."
            
-   In _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_, if the Dragonborn joins the Companions, Farkas may tell him/her about how he and his fraternal twin brother Vilkas came to be part of the group. Should the Dragonborn then speak to Vilkas about what Farkas said, Vilkas makes some corrections to the story — but he prefaces his remarks with the stern assertion that "I love my brother." Vilkas is the more abrasive of the twins, but his devotion to Farkas is uncontested.
-   In _Final Fantasy XV_, Noctis stammers one out to his True Companions as they gather around a campfire for the last time before heading off to defeat the Big Bad so he can perform the Heroic Sacrifice necessary to save the world. It's more overt in the Japanese version, where he specifically uses the words "I love you" to express his gratitude.
    
    **Noctis:** You guys... are the best.
    
-   _Grandia_ has a comically awkward variation. When Justin and Feena are sailing across the sea at night, alone together for the first time in a long time, Feena asks Justin if he loves her. Justin responds (if the player picks this particular dialogue choice) with "Of course I love you!"... before making it clear with his follow-up comment that he means it platonically. It's not that he doesn't return her feelings, just that he had no idea what she meant at the time. Even after she clarifies that she "wasn't talking about that kind of love", he's still clueless.
-   In _Rune Factory 4,_ you can tell any named character "I love you!" at any time. For characters who aren't possible Love Interests, it's taken to be one of these and elicits an appropriate response. Porcoline gets the wrong idea, but the player character clarifies that it's one of these.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_: Upon finally realizing her desires to be part of a team that cares for her, Nia tells Rex she loves him. Rex responds by saying he loves her, shocking her, and all his friends, which sends her into a laughing fit. Rex may have missed her intentions.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_: When Shion is about to perform what she assumes will be a Heroic Sacrifice in Matsuribayashi-hen, she asks Keiichi to pass on a message to her sister Mion that she loves her and hopes they can be twins again in their next life.
-   In _Katawa Shoujo_, Lilly tells her best friend Hanako she loves her towards the end of her route before she leaves for Scotland.
    
    -   In Hanako's route to the good ending, Hanako will also admit to Hisao that she loves Lilly on their date together after he comments on how close she and Lilly are.
    
    **Hisao:** Lilly's a very special person to you, isn't she?  
    **Hanako:** She is. I... love her... very much.
    

    Webcomics 

-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Elliot nonchalantly declares his love for Tedd while trying to figure out his feelings for Sarah. He even compares their relationship to Frodo and Sam. Tedd decides he needs a hug too much to make the obligatory gay hobbits joke.
-   In _Pixie and Brutus_, Pixie declares that she loves Brutus almost immediately after meeting him, directly after calling him her big brother and squealing that they're going to be the best of friends. Brutus finds this amusing, but willingly adopts Pixie as his protectorate, and subsequent comics make it clear that he adores her.

    Web Original 

-   Ruby's last words to Yang in the Volume 3 finale of _RWBY_ are to tell her that she loves her, but Yang is too emotionally drained from all the trauma she's undergone in the past several episodes to respond to or even acknowledge her sister's words. This becomes a Meaningful Echo when the two reunite in "Known by its Song" after several months apart, and the first thing Yang does is pull Ruby into a hug and tell her that she loves her.
-   Sy _finally_ admits his love for Mary to her in _Twig_ after killing the Baron Richmond, explaining that he considers her his family, shortly before kneecapping her so she can't stop him from running away from the Academy of Evil, having figured out that while she loves him too, they both love the rest of the Lambs too much and Mary would be miserable even if he could convince her to leave with him.

    Western Animation 

-   _Back to the Future: The Animated Series_: Downplayed. In "Forward to the Past", Doc tells his sons that they accidentally messed up the time stream such that none of the people they love (he specifically cites Clara, Marty, and Einstein) exist. While Doc obviously has romantic feelings for Clara, he's clearly referring to different types of love in the sentence as two out of three of the examples are platonic.
-   _Bojack Horseman_:
    -   Invoked in "Love And/Or Marriage," after Princess Carolyn returns from three blind dates to sign congratulations cards to everyone in VIM Agency with the stock words made by her assistant, Judah. She signs them mechanically until she sees the one meant for Judah himself. She's genuinely touched that he so desperately wants her approval.
        
        _"Dear Judah, you are a wonderful employee. I am very proud of you. Sincerely, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."_
        
    -   And then in "It's You":
        
        **Princess Carolyn:** It's been a pleasure working with you, Judah.  
        **Judah:** I've found it to be an above-average experience. Please forgive me for getting emotional.
        
    -   In "That Went Well", Diane visits BoJack after Sarah Lynn's death, finding him at a really low point and after talking about it, Diane raises his spirits by telling him that, contrary to what he now believes, _Horsin' Around_ was an important show in people's lives, especially for troubled people growing up...like her. After processing what she has just said, BoJack retorts that she's wasting her time writing tweets for celebrities when she could do much better and then:
        
        **BoJack:** And I wish you didn't get so distant after you moved out.  
        **Diane:** I'm sorry.  
        **BoJack**: You know me better than anybody, and you can't not be a part of my life.
        
-   A tragic version in the _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_ episode "Mind Pollution": Verminous Skumm concocts and starts selling a narcotic called Bliss. Linka's cousin Boris, unable to afford the higher prices, offers to steal Linka's power ring in exchange for more of it. Skumm asks him to bring in _Linka_ instead, in exchange for all the Bliss he wants. Boris replies with the trope, which might ordinarily signal his freeing himself with The Power of Family... and Skumm replies that, in that case, Boris can just _live_ with the agonizing Bliss withdrawal. Boris gives in and _gets Linka addicted to Bliss_.
-   In the _Darkwing Duck_ episode "Dead Duck", Darkwing tells his daughter, Gosalyn, that he loves her as part of a final goodbye (in a dream... Or Was It a Dream?).
-   In the _DuckTales (1987)_ episode "A DuckTales Valentine", during the kids' final meeting with Scrooge before he plans to go off with Aphroducky, Louie tells Scrooge that they love him, but they can't follow him to Mt. Olympus. This begins to rattle the enchantment.
-   In the _Family Guy_ episode "Life of Brian", Brian gets run over by a car. As he lies dying on the operating table, his final words to his family are "You... You've given me a wonderful life. I love you all."
-   In _Futurama_, Bender has given Fry several, perhaps most eloquently in "Jurassic Bark".
    
    **Bender:** I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature because I love _you_. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.
    
    -   He gives one to both Fry and Leela at the end of _The Beast With a Billion Backs_.
        
        **Bender:** That wasn't love.  
        **Fry:** What? How can you say that?  
        **Bender:** Because Bender _knows_ love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy! _\[he hugs Fry and Leela, choking them\]_ I love you, meatbags!
        
-   _Kaeloo_: Stumpy gives one to the rest of the main four in the climax of Episode 105.
-   In _The Magic School Bus_ episode "Going Batty", some of the children are convinced by Ralphie's assertion that Ms. Frizzle is a vampire and go to rescue their parents before she can turn them. However, when they get there, their parents are already hanging from the ceiling with bats' wings wrapped around them. Phoebe's response?
    
    **Phoebe:** I love you anyway, Daddy. I'll love you forever.
    
-   _Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero_:
    -   The resolution of the Love Triangle plot in "That Purple Girl".
        
        **Boone:** It turned you into a raging jerkface, but that's okay. I forgive you... because I love you.  
        **Penn:** _\[smiles\]_ I love you too.
        
    -   Boone utilizes a more poetic version in "3 Big Problems".
        
        **Boone:** Tell my best friend I love him.  
        **Penn:** I thought _I_ was your best friend.  
        **Boone:** You are.
        
-   _Pinky and the Brain_: Played with via Last-Second Word Swap. In one episode, Brain accidentally knocks Pinky off the table. Upon finding out that he's all right, Brain laments that it's his fault: "This obsession with taking over the world is causing me to hurt the ones I... tolerate."
-   _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_: The titular girls and their father/creator Professor Utonium say "I love you" to one another several times throughout the series, but the most poignant and dramatic instance of it by far happens in the episode "Knock it Off." The professor's old college roommate Dick sees dollar signs when he first meets the girls, and it isn't long before he's mass-producing clones (most of them very slipshod) to sell all over the world. When the girls try to stop him, they're captured and drained of the Chemical X within them so Dick can continue to use the secret ingredient to make more clones. The professor begs to trade places with them, but Dick simply captures him as well. As he's being taken away, he yells out to the girls that he loves them and they respond weakly with "we love you too" before seemingly passing out/dying. This show of affection makes the clones realize that they never received any love themselves, and they turn on their creator. The professor's love ends up revitalizing the girls in the end.
-   _Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!_:
    -   In the episode "Decoy for a Dognapper", the perp, Buck Masters, tells the kids that "I wish you'd have minded your own business". Fred replies, "Catching dognappers _is_ our business, Mr. Masters. After all, Scooby-Doo is a dog, and we love him very much."
    -   In an extra (viewable on _Scooby-Doo's Greatest Mysteries_), the gang are finishing a series of interviews about various aspects of their lives and have just finished having a good laugh at Scooby scaring Shaggy with a monster mask. Fred says that he loves his teammates. Velma responds by telling him to knock it off.
-   _Skull Island (2023)_: The familial kind. As shown by the flashbacks in Episode 6, these were the last words that Annie's Disappeared Dad said to her before he died defending her.
-   In the _Steven Universe_ episode "Jail Break", after Ruby and Sapphire re-fuse into Garnet, Steven sheepishly asks if he made a good first impression on her separate halves, to which Garnet replies, "Steven, we already love you."
    -   Later, when Steven and Peridot drill into the Earth to stop the Cluster and it looks as though they're about to die...
        
        **Steven:** I love you, Peridot.  
        **Peridot:** Wow, thanks.
        
-   From _Voltron: Legendary Defender_: In an epic "I Know You Are in There Somewhere" Fight, Keith tells this to Shiro to bring him back to his senses.
    
    **Keith:** Shiro, please! You're my brother! I love you!  
    _\[ Shiro momentarily freezes\]_
    
    -   Later in Season 7:
        
        **Krolia:** I love you, Keith.  
        **Keith:** I love you too, Mom.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        
-   Wander and Sylvia at the end of the _Wander over Yonder_ episode "The Lonely Planet." It's what finally causes the Yandere planet Janet to stop attacking them, realizing that all she wanted was a friendship like the one they had.
    
    **Sylvia:** If getting lava-balled by a jealous planet is how we go out, buddy, well, I'm just glad we're doing it together.  
    **Wander:** I couldn't agree more. I love you, Sylvia!  
    **Sylvia:** You too, Wander. You too!
