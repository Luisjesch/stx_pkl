Two (or more) characters team up to seduce their target _together_.

Perhaps, in the past, they've both failed to secure the third party's affections, but who would ever turn down TWO PEOPLE hitting on them, or two girls or two guys making out with each other?

An alternate version of this trope can be the two teaming up to put the desired character in a situation which would give either (or both) of them a chance to seduce him/her individually. For example, coming up with the idea to do an activity which needs three people, and then both try to get their beloved alone.

And yet another form of this trope is when the two give each other pointers. Alice points out that if Carol showed off a little more cleavage, she'd look ten times hotter, and Carol admits that if Alice would rein in her bad habits and behave more lady-like, she'd be much easier to approach. Both do their best to cooperate with each other, and then come at their Love Interest with guns blazing. Alternatively, two guys could do the same—as could seducers of two different genders.

The seducers also don't explicitly have to be "rivals". They can merely be two individuals who realize that they have a mutual crush and decide that they stand a better chance trying to seduce him/her together than alone. The target also doesn't have to be someone they're in love with or have feelings for; they could simply be trying to seduce him/her as a means to an end.

There are three typical outcomes to this situation:

1.  The crush STILL doesn't crack and the wacky hijinks continue.
2.  They manage to rein the crush in, but their rivalry, or unwillingness to share, ruins things.
3.  Everybody's happy.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Bleach_, this was suggested by the Cloud Cuckoo Lander Orihime, who said that if she and Rukia were both in love with Ichigo (Rukia says she isn't), they could "team up and the girls would win", but this was laughed off as silly...mostly because nobody knew what the hell she was talking about.
-   In _Please Twins!_, Mina and Karen team up for an episode to seduce Maiku in a mistaken attempt to turn him straight.
-   In _Persona 4: The Animation_'s adaptation of the King's Game, Rise and Yukiko ensure the game is very lewd and sexual. However, things go a step further, when the protagonist winds up having all _three_ of his potential romantic interests follow the perverse rules to have their own quality time with him (although Chie is clearly embarassed).
-   Justified in _Strike the Blood_. Protagonist Kojou Akatsuki is a vampire whose powers only work if he drinks other peoples' blood, and vampiric bloodlust is akin to actual _sexual_ lust, meaning he has to be turned on to drink blood. So this trope happens _twice_.
    -   On one occasion, a familiar turns out to need _two_ peoples' blood to work properly, so when one girl fails to do it alone, the other steps up to the plate as well.
    -   On the second occasion, this trope is fully invoked, both because a single girl can't arouse the dying Kojou enough to save his life, and because only one of them has blood immune to the Anti-Magic field preventing his powers from awakening. So it takes one girl to restore his powers and the other to slake his thirst.
-   _Kiss-x-Sis_: The Suminoe twins begin the series competing with each other for their stepbrother's affections. But once they discover he's begun dating their homeroom teacher, Ms. Yuuzuki, Ako and Riko set aside their differences and join forces to try to seduce Keita away from her.
-   _Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody_: Having manipulated her way into being Satou's Sex Slave, Arisa attempted this with Lulu when first spending the night with Satou, stripping both herself and Lulu naked in preparation to "service" him. The attempt was foiled by two factors: Lulu was too visibly uncomfortable with being used this way, and Satou wasn't interested in young girls.
-   _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_: Olivia and Angelica try this multiple times on Leon, though they end up subverting Ready for Lovemaking by falling asleep in Leon's bed during their first attempt. Noelle tries to give them common sense advice to take other approaches after they fail the second time.

    Art 

-   In _Nymphs and Satyr_, four different nymphs all crowding around a single satyr to get him into the water seems to be this. Whether they are actually interested in sex or are just trying to get him into the water is left ambiguous.

    Comic Books 

-   Betty and Veronica in _Archie Comics_ have pulled this trick a few times, usually with both girls ruining it by fighting again. Since the two girls are best friends, though, "threesome" endings are rare but not completely out of the question (in a PG-rated sense, of course).
-   _Legion of Super-Heroes_: Pictured above are the Legion members Superboy, Phantom Girl and Triplicate Girl. When Phantom Girl takes an opportunity to steal a kiss from Superboy, Triplicate Girl cuts in using two of her duplicate selves to steal Superboy away and get kisses for themselves.

    Fan Works 

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Two women in _Panic_ (2000) do this so as to pick up a guy at a bar, though it later seems like it may have been a roundabout way of getting together with each other.

    Literature 

-   This is pretty much the ending of _The Pyrates_, with the Chaste Hero being approached by all of his potential love interests. It ends without showing the resolution.
-   _Whateley Universe_: In _Boston Brawl_, Fey and Tennyo team up to mess with Hank by play-flirting with him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   There was an episode of _Gilligan's Island_ where Ginger and Mary Ann do this to Gilligan.
-   Kelly Garrett, Jill Munroe and Sabrina Duncan _Charlie's Angels_ stop short of full-on seduction with Bosley in order to get him to reveal what Charlie Townsend looks like.
-   Santana and Brittany seduce and date Finn together in _Glee_ episode "Hell-O", though it plays out as the two girls having a date that they let Finn watch and pay for.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   If this was a professional wrestling site we'd be calling it Tag Team seduction and the trope namers would likely be Quebec's DM Strokes and LJ Strokes: Twins Attraction. Most of their opponents happen to be straight men, so their masculine wiles are mostly used for off ring activities.
-   Attempted by Sarita and Rosita on Eric Young, but his loyalty to ODB made him invulnerable to their charms.
-   During the House Of Truth's first Ring of Honor run and at the very start of their second, some combination of Scarlett Bordeaux, Valerie Malone, Kasey Ray, and or Seleziya Sparx, the so called "Hoopla Hotties", would attempt to seduce enemies of the HOT, especially during the matches of Television Title holders Matt Taven and Jay Lethal.
-   Aksana and Tamina tried this on Brodus Clay. Unfortunately for them he already had two ladies trailing him. So then they tried to get rid of The Funkadactyls, thinking it would work then.

    Video Games 

-   In _Persona 4_, something close to this is what Rise and Yukiko try to pull during the King's Game, when it's Yu's turn to be the King. Both of them make sure that the game is as lewd and perverse as possible, on the off chance that either of them will be picked.
-   Subverted in _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_, where the long-standing Love Triangle between Yennefer and Triss ultimately gets resolved. If Geralt tries to romance them both, the two of them both appear to him in their underwear and imply that they're going to have a threesome. They handcuff him to the bed, but then pull out bottles of champagne to congratulate themselves and leave him Chained to a Bed

    Visual Novels 

-   Double subverted in _Daughter for Dessert_. Heidi enlists the protagonist to try this stealthily with Kathy, because Heidi in sure that Kathy is bi. Kathy pretends to be offended, but she’s actually up for a threesome with the two of them.
-   Multiple times in _Double Homework_:
    -   Dennis offers the protagonist his help in seducing Ms. Walsh; he’s been posing online as Jailson Mendes, a Brazilian actor. He reveals that he’s asked their teacher out on a date, and he expects that the protagonist can close the deal. If he takes Dennis up on his offer, he will indeed have sex with Ms. Walsh.
    -   After Johanna and Tamara bury the hatchet and agree to share the protagonist, the three of them take turns doing this to each other.

    Web Comics 

    Western Animation 

-   In an episode of _Gravity Falls,_ Candy proposes that she and Mabel team up to woo "white whale" Marius, leaving Grenda who eventually wins his heart out of the loop. They don't seem to have a real plan for it and wind up getting in each other's way.
-   Played with in _Star Trek: Lower Decks_. Thanks to the law of Billups's home planet, as crown prince, he becomes king as soon as he has sex, which his mother is desperate for. To that end, she has a male and female guard attempt to seduce him (possibly to cover her bases re: which gender he prefers). When traditional methods fail, she fakes her death to force his hand. Billups sets out to claim his birthright by sleeping with both guards together, which seems to suit them just fine. Until he fails to follow through.
