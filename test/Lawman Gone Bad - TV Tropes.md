Not always this obvious.

_"20 years I've been on the streets. You know what Mega City One is, Dredd? It's a fucking meat grinder. People go in one end, and meat comes out the other. All we do is turn the handle._"

At first glance, he is the Reasonable Authority Figure or maybe even a Gentleman Detective. However, if you push them too far in just the right place (may or may not be their Berserk Button), he will have a good reason to become an outcast from the police force and perform a Face–Heel Turn. What causes them to turn from the law they upheld varies, though disillusionment, disgruntlement or greed will usually be at the root of it.

Due to the nature of the trope, it's often used as part of the character's backstory, or as the surprise twist at the end.

If the lawman is not the hero of the story, then he might do a full Face–Heel Turn. After helping the hero defeat the villains, he turns on the hero and tries to kill him so he can have the money for himself.

To put it bluntly, this character is what's known as a Lawman Gone Bad. This is a character who takes pride in working for the law before an incident that makes him snap causes him to distance himself from those that he used to work for.

The character may also be a Big Bad Friend.

Related to Dirty Cop and Cowboy Cop. Compare Fallen Hero. The companion trope where someone who was once in the military and has turned to crime is From Camouflage to Criminal.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Lagoon_: former police officer Mr. Chang didn't just go bad, he went all in and became a Triad _boss_.
-   _Moriarty the Patriot_: Chief of Police Zachary Patterson became a cop in order to serve justice to the people of the British Empire, but quickly found that Scotland Yard was not the place he thought it was. Disillusioned, he joined up with criminal mastermind William's crew before the series even began.
-   _One Piece_: Shiryu of the Rain was once the head jailer of the most dangerous prison in the world, Impel Down, but prison warden Magellan locked him up for sadistically killing prisoners for fun. During a riot, Magellan releases him to help him quell the riot and makes it clear that he won't be released from his sentence and is only postponing his execution. This leaves Shiryu no other choice but to join the Blackbeard Pirates as one of their commanders.

    Comic Books 

-   This may be the fate of Inspector Finch at the end of _V for Vendetta_ when the Norsefire system is collapsing. See also under film.
-   According to Word of God, this is the backstory of Jackie Boy from _Sin City_. The audience only sees Jackie as an abusive drunk with an allusion to being a "hero cop" in the past. Apparently, he once earned the accolades of a hero but unknown circumstances led him down a dark path.
-   Sheriff Halliday becomes this at the end of _Hitman Annual_ #1 when he tries to take possession of A MacGuffin Full of Money for himself.
-   _Judge Dredd_ has several examples, but the most notable is Dredd's own clone brother, Rico. After graduating top of his class, Rico starts taking bribes and running his own rackets while on the job. Joe ends up arresting him and sentencing him to twenty years on Titan, which he actually survives. Rico comes back for revenge and Joe is forced to kill him.
-   Former Green Lantern Medphyll, after losing his ring, joined forces with Throneworld's corrupt leader to stop the legitimate ruler from returning and reclaiming his authority. Unfortunately for him, Jack Knight fought back and succeeded in destroying Medphyll.
-   Inverted in _Daisy Kutter_, where the sheriff of Middleton is the former train-robbing outlaw Tom McKay. Tom gave up his life of crime and settled down to become a small-town sheriff. He spends the first half of the comic trying to convince his ex-girlfriend and ex-partner-in-crime Daisy to do the same — she quit the banditry business the same time he did, but she opened a general store rather than join up with the institution they once rebelled against. By the end of the comic, Tom's injuries force him to retire and Daisy takes his place as the sheriff of Middleton.
-   Some versions of _The Punisher_ have him be a cop rather than an ex-Vietnam soldier before a Mafia hit sets him on a permanent crusade to avenge his family.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   A prime example is Captain Culpepper (played by Spencer Tracy) from the 1963 Comedy film _It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World_. At first, he intends to confiscate the stolen money and presumably return it to its rightful owners, but after being buried under an ever-increasing mountain of bad news from his home life and regarding his police pension (or lack thereof), he devises A Simple Plan to get the dough for himself and skip on down to Mexico for his "retirement".
-   In the western _There Was a Crooked Man..._, a new warden (Henry Fonda) at an Arizona prison tries to institute reforms, but a Manipulative Bastard inmate (Kirk Douglas) uses this to stage a mass escape. The warden pursues the inmate, and the inmate meets a Karmic Death while retrieving the loot from one of his robberies. The warden returns with the inmate's body and the loot to the prison but realizes that a new warden has been appointed in the meantime. Disgraced and out of a job, he sends the horse with the body toward the prison while he and the money ride off to start a new life.
-   _The Hurricane Heist_: Sheriff Dixon's deputies are initially honest cops working to provide order during the hurricane. But once they get offered a cut of the money, they quickly and remorselessly join Connor's gang.
-   In _Minority Report_, the trope is subverted. For a while, it seems as if John Anderton will become a murderer since he's already abusing illegal drugs to cope with the death of his son. In fact, it's his boss, Lamar Burgess, who has been committing murders to validate the pre-crime system.
-   Unlike the more ambivalent ending of the Comic Book, the film version of _V for Vendetta_ has Finch clearly joining "V" (actually Evey) when the rebellion against the fascist government begins.
-   Ed Kilifer in _Licence to Kill_. He is a DEA agent who accepts a $2 million dollar bribe to spring drug lord Sanchez from federal custody.
-   Harvey Dent / Two-Face from _The Dark Knight_. Originally the White Knight of Gotham, he goes ballistic and insane after some antics by The Joker. Considering said 'antics' result in, among other consequences, Harvey getting _half his face burned off_ and his Love Interest being killed, this is perhaps a bit understandable.
-   In _Hard Rain_, Randy Quaid's character Sheriff Mike Collig does this. Being forced to stay behind and guard an empty flooded-out town against looters, a town whose citizens just _voted you out of office_ was apparently the straw that broke the camel's back.
-   _Speed_: Howard Payne was a former member of the Atlanta PD bomb squad, who turned Mad Bomber after being forcibly retired, due to an accident which injured his right hand. He couldn't continue on the force, but wasn't disabled enough to qualify for collecting his pension. Howard did not take it well.
    
    **Jack:** _\[over phone\]_ Why didn't you just come after me?  
    **Payne:** _\[scoffs\]_ You?! This isn't about you, this is about ME!! It's about my money! This is about money due to ME! Which I WILL collect!
    
-   The Czech cop in _xXx_ who, after one too many humiliations, turns informant for the bad guys.
-   Max Rockatansky (of _Mad Max_) started out as a highway cop in a disintegrating dystopian future; he didn't turn bad so much as become a free agent independent of the law in order to go on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge against the motorcycle gang that murdered his family. Then, between the end of the first film and the start of the next one, the apocalypse broke out...
-   In _Rough Cut_, Burt Reynolds (The Gentleman Thief) tries to steal a case of rough cut diamonds, being protected by a Police Chief bent on capturing him. After the gang get the case to the Bahamas, Burt reveals that the diamonds are fakes. Cue the entry of the Police Chief with the actual case, "selling" it to them for a share of the cut.

-   Sargent Haig of _The Mental State_ starts out as a Jerkass who looks down on the prisoners he is guarding and regards them as scum. Then, when the prison starts to adopt more liberal policies and the inmates are granted more freedom, he becomes even more sadistic and retaliates by beating one of the frailer prisoners up for no good reason. He gets worse after he is falsely accused of dealing drugs and incarcerated in the same prison. He even joins up with a criminal gang just so that he can get revenge on the one responsible for framing him.
-   Commissioner Gauche in _Murder on the Leviathan_ spends about 9/10ths of the novel dedicated to capturing a genuinely dangerous and nasty killer (albeit without that much competence). Then, when it transpires that the motive for the murder involved a treasure map which would lead to more money than Gauche would make on a policeman's salary in ten lifetimes, he promptly beats the captured murderer to death trying to find out where the map was. Unfortunately for him, the man he killed was only an accomplice, and the actual killer makes Guache the next victim.

-   In _CSI: NY_, Mac discovers that his first partner became one of these, having stolen a large amount of money from a crime scene (he was nearing retirement and didn't think he was being paid enough) and murdered the girlfriend of the guy who has a vendetta against him and Mac (he doesn't know, then doesn't care, that Mac wasn't responsible).

    Video Games 

-   Several examples from the _Mass Effect_ series:
    -   Garrus starts off in _Mass Effect_ as a security officer in the Citadel (as well as a Spectre candidate) but quits due to his Cowboy Cop tendencies and eventually goes vigilante in a Wretched Hive in _Mass Effect 2_.
    -   Shepard him-/herself is seen as this by the Alliance and the Council, due to being an ex-Spectre (elite agent of the galactic government) who now collaborates with the pro-human terrorist group Cerberus to deal with alien abductions that the Alliance refuses to acknowledge. In actuality, however, Shepard never goes over to the bad guys, the Illusive Man just did his best to make it look like s/he did.
    -   Also from _Mass Effect 2_, the asari spectre Tela Vasir is revealed to have cooperated with the crime lord Shadow Broker after growing disillusioned with proper procedure. She still considers herself serving a greater good, which she believes to justify the questionable means, and calls Shepard out on his/her own cooperation with Cerberus.
-   _Max Payne_
    -   Max Payne is an NYPD detective in the first two games but is forced by circumstances (both times involving him being framed for the murder of another officer) to go on a one-man crusade against the local mobs both times.
    -   In a twist for the second game, he actually does kill another detective, except she's a Dirty Cop in bed (literally) with the Big Bad.
    -   Supplementary material for _Max Payne 3_ reveals that the Cracha Preto used to be lawmen who went on Vigilante sprees against criminals the law couldn't or wouldn't touch. Then they experienced Motive Decay and descended into being plain paramilitary thugs.
-   According to _Batman: Arkham Origins_, this is the Riddler's backstory in the _Batman: Arkham Series_: Edward Naston was a member of the GCPD's cybercrimes division before going rogue.

    -   The sequel ramps it up to Lawman Gone Ruthless Badass.

-   Numerous examples in _Mega Man X_, including every single major villain in the first game. The Maverick Hunters are robot police, and one of the most common backstories in the series is 'former Hunter gone rogue.' The reasons vary — the most common one is infection by the Maverick Virus, but there are others, especially in the Maverick Hunter X version of the continuity. Sigma, depending on the version, went rogue either because of the virus, to force 'evolution' and draw out the true potential of the reploid race through constant conflict, or both; Sting Chameleon was forced into going rogue because of hostages; Chill Penguin did it out of boredom after having spent so long assigned to Antarctica, Bubble Crab to get rich; and so on.
