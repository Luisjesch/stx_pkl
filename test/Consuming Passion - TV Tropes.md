_"Please don't leave me! I love you! I'm going to eat your every organ, and your bones...."_

Cannibalism is a strange beast. In most cultures eating another person is generally frowned upon. Most media tends to handle the subject one of two ways: either with horror or with dark humor. However there is a third way to use it: as a metaphor for sex for Psychosexual Horror.

At first such an idea might seem strange. After all, what do the two concepts have to do with each other? But upon further inspection they do have more in common than one might think. Both hunger and sexual desire are classified as "needs" and going without either for a long period of time can make the need for them feel all the more stronger. On top of that we have phrases like "sexual appetite" that combine hunger and lust into a single concept. People who lust after somebody are said to "hunger" for them. And in the actual act of lovemaking the man typically ends up "inside" the woman, just like he would if she ate him. Indeed, when a woman has a lot of sexual partners she is called a "maneater," implying that she not only sleeps with these men then ditches them, but devours them like hors d'oeuvres.

As a result media sometimes adds sexual undertones/overtones to the concept of eating another person. Often times this manifests as innuendo eating that is pretty much an euphemism for sex. It also shows up as a metaphor for sexual power and dominance in characters like the Literal Maneater, who both titillates and devours her victims. A third way this trope can be used is the predator catching her (as it's often a her) prey in a manner that is reminiscent of a seduction.

A form of Does This Remind You of Anything?, Sub-Trope of Interplay of Sex and Violence. Hemo Erotic is the Sister Trope for when drinking blood is sexual; also compare Blood Lust. Literal Man Eater, where a Ms. Fanservice devours men, is a subtrope. Contrast Succubi and Incubi, who do the opposite: eating people through sex. See also A Love to Dismember.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Beastars_ combines this trope with Carnivore Confusion, blurring the line between the predatory urges carnivores feel toward herbivores and sexuality between the same. The below are just a few examples:
    -   When Legosi captures Haru outside the theater and clings to her, it would be easy to mistake his predatory musings for sexual excitement.
    -   It happens again when Juno pins Louis to the ground to make her 'declaration of war.'
    -   For carnivores, the ability to kill is seen as a sort of rite of passage not unlike losing virginity. Legosi tries to understand Tem's killer's perspective, even noting that he "has something he doesn't", by starting small and eating a larvae raw; and afterwards he shows textbook examples of a freshly unvirgin male (he's in pure bliss following the consumption, his fur grows back, he gets more confident).
    -   Even strip joints run on this sort of logic. One particular stripper notes that the crowd (which is made of mostly predators) gets more and more frenzied while she (a herbivore) does her thing on stage, and uses that power to her advantage.
    -   A lamb named Sebun, who ends up as Legosi's neighbor for various reasons, harbors suicidal urges of being devoured by a carnivore. Legosi, who is suffering "Meat Withdrawal" after eating Louis's leg at the latter's inclination to beat Riz, keeps accidentally creating situations that are this trope incarnate, complete with pinning her down and the two having heavy breaths.
    -   Pina and Melon both see predation as equal to male-on-female interactions, but take opposite stances. Pina understands how it feels to have indescribable lust for the opposite sex, and relates it to Legosi's urges to eat meat when he's alone with an herbivore; conversely, Melon was never able to understand the urge to "eat" rather than the urge to "kill", only awakening to it when he gets to know Haru.
-   Invoked in _Claymore_ near the end, when Man Behind the Man Dae is gutted by Big Bad Priscilla, who then proceeds to eat his intestines. Dae claims that such an act is almost like a sexual intercourse, which causes Priscilla to pause and call him "creepy".
-   Played disturbingly literally in _Mnemosyne_. Angels (i.e. human men infected with time spores) are natural enemies of the immortals (infected women), because in their presence, the latter are so overcome with sexual desire that they willingly give themselves to the angels to devour (which seems to be the angels' sole motivation). There are even hints that the immortals perceive being eaten alive by an angel as intense sexual pleasure.

    Fan Works 

-   _Codex Equus_: The giant Queen Peínagápia reflects both aspects of this. She began life as a goddess of self-control, becoming a Stepford Smiler until her Emotion Suppression became too great. When she broke, she went on a rampage across the countryside, devouring and ravaging anybody she came across, including her own family. Even when she regained control and learned to balance her newfound hedonist desires, she continues to represent Indulgence and Lust as well as her previous titles. She's stated to frequently feast on the lustful and wicked who do not repent their ways, dooming them to eternal torment inside her.

-   _Trick 'r Treat_: Laurie's friends reminisce about what sound like past sexual escapades, while teasing Laurie for being a "virgin'' and wanting her first time to be "special". Turns out they're all werewolves, and this is how they talk about killing and eating men, which Laurie hadn't done yet.
    
    **Laurie:** I don't know why we drove out here when there are perfectly good guys in the city.  
    **Janet:** Fresh meat. \[...\] Last year we were in Tampa.  
    **Maria:** And we went as sexy nurses.  
    **Danielle:** No Janet, Tampa was two years ago, I remember because you puked doing a guy in his pickup truck.  
    **Janet:** I ate some bad Mexican, and it was a Jeep.  
    **Danielle:** Last year was San Diego. We dressed as sailors and ended up with sailors.  
    **Janet:** Yeah, and Maria's sailor was a girl.  
    **Maria:** So what, she had a nice ass! It all tastes the same to me anyway...
