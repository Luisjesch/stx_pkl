Sexually transmitted infections and diseases are a serious thing and there are many ways to get them in real life. In fiction, however, they rarely (if ever) come up. But when they _do_, it's rarely the "good guys" who get them.

Characters often contract STDs (usually the more dangerous types) as "punishment" if they're villainous. For example, a rapist or murderer who ends up with HIV.

In older works, this is often used as a form of Slut-Shaming. Promiscuous and oftentimes gay characters were "bad", so to punish them they ended up with syphilis, AIDS, or some other sexually transmitted illness. This variation is rarely used anymore, but it can still occasionally pop up.

Contrast with a Tragic AIDS Story, which is a sympathetic portrayal of a character dying of AIDS. Sub-trope to Sexual Karma. See also Good Victims, Bad Victims, But We Used a Condom!, and Can't Get Away with Nuthin'. If the STD was caught due to carelessness, it's also a case of Lust Makes You Dumb.

Finally, like most sex tropes, real life examples are not welcome here as per the Content Policy.

    Literature 

-   During _The City Who Fought_, the inhabitants of a Space Station can't openly defy the army of murderous rapist looters who invade them, lest they all be killed.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Discussed in an episode of _The Golden Girls_ in which Rose is being tested for AIDS because of a possibly contaminated blood transfusion. She rants at Blanche that she doesn't know why this is happening to her when she's a good person and that it seems like something which should happen to the more promiscuous Blanche. Blanche, understandably offended, fires back that "AIDS is not a 'bad person' disease, Rose! It is not God punishing people for their sins!"
-   Invoked on _Lucifer_ when a woman tries to get revenge on a guy who used her and dumped her by tricking him into falling in love with her (she meant so little to him that he didn't recognize her), faking her own kidnapping so he would pay the ransom, then killing him and running away with the money. Lucifer was appalled by the Disproportionate Retribution and said that a simple STD would have been a much more fitting punishment.
-   _Misfits_ had an episode with a woman who had the ability to give people superpowered STIs. Hilarity Ensues when promiscuous and (seemingly) uncaring Rudy fell victim to it and has to go on a search to find said woman and make it up to her before his member falls off.
-   Played absolutely straight on _My Name Is Earl_: Earl wishes to make amends with his ex-girlfriend Natalie, with whom he had broken up by faking his death (in order to avoid hurting her feelings.) Her _new_ boyfriend, Dirk, decides to emulate Earl and fake _his_ own death, and hang out at the motel with a prostitute. Due to the lack of condom machines, he uses motel-issue shower caps instead. Eventually, Natalie discovers his deception and presents him with his Karmic Comeuppance, although Probability was almost certain to bring this one about, so Karma could've taken the day off.
    
    **Natalie:** Hey Dirk. Still getting your mail. It's from the clinic: Somebody got themselves an STD.
    
    **Dirk:** I can deal with that.
    
    **Natalie:** Turn the page.
    
    **Dirk:** Aww crap... Damn shower caps.
    
-   Played with very unpleasantly in _Veronica Mars_. Woody Goodman has chlamydia, which is an indicator of what an awful Dirty Old Man is (and he was literally preying on children). He gave the STD to mass murderer Cassidy Casablancas, which is how Veronica figures out that Cassidy is both her rapist and the bus bomber. The only exception is Veronica herself, who is the heroine and also got it by being raped while unconscious.

    Western Animation 

-   _South Park_: In the episode "Tonsil Trouble", the Token Evil Teammate Cartman discovers he has HIV. Kyle thinks it's karma. Cartman believes that no one deserves AIDS, but he still infects Kyle anyway just to teach him that.
