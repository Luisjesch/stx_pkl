You cannot esc-Ape!

"_Monkeys, apes, they all hold stuff with their feet, man! We're talking freaks of nature!_"

Apes and monkeys with human-level intelligence, whether artificial or natural, have a recurring tendency to be antagonists in fiction. If the protagonists are humans, they might be suffering an inherent sibling rivalry with the human race, and want to either wipe it out or subdue it. If it's a story with a cast of animals, they might see themselves as "superior" to the other species and try to rule over them. Either way, these monkeys are used as signs that something bad is about to go down.

This trope is distinct from Killer Space Monkey in that these monkeys are usually Super Intelligent Mad Scientists who want to Take Over the World or at least make life difficult for humanity. Another possibility is that they are Genius Bruisers determined to both overpower and Out Gambit their fellow primates. However, often they are just highly aggressive animals that attack humans (which may be Truth in Television for some primate species).

This here is the opposite of Silly Simian. Compare Mischief-Making Monkey, where the trouble the monkey causes is more harmless. Killer Gorilla is a subtrope, as gorillas (and other great apes) are particularly often portrayed as malevolent, due to their great strength and menacing appearance. For the underwater equivalent, see Devious Dolphins. For primates in general being depicted as intelligent, regardless of whether or not they're dangerous, see Intelligent Primate.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Beast Titan, from _Attack on Titan_. It's 17 meters tall, with Creepily Long Arms, a cruel, brilliant mind, and the ability to turn humans into Titans he can control. Its appearance heralds very bad things. He's the Warchief of Marley's Titan warriors and is rather fond of baseball.
-   Etemon from _Digimon Adventure_. And Makuramon from Digimon Tamers.
-   The Saiyans from _Dragon Ball Z_ are like this. They are galactic conquerors who can transform into giant apes during the full moon. Their only simian-like characteristic in their normal form is their monkey tails.
-   One of the first monsters seen in _The Fruit of Evolution_ are primates literally called "Clever Monkeys". Not only are they massively more powerful than you'd expect for something that looks like a chimpanzee with a spider monkey's tail, being _Level 150_, they back it up with high stats, high speed, and powerful attacks, including a Razor Wind kick attack called Guillotine Kick. Their highest stat is actually their intelligence, which allows them to craft (and use!) well-made tools and all kinds of herbal medicines and potions. The Clever Monkeys that Seiichi meets are encountered working under a Kaiser Kong, but it's unclear if that's normal for them.
-   _Jojos Bizarre Adventure_: Forever from _Stardust Crusaders_ is an orangutan who gained human-level intelligence after acquiring the Stand Strength, and antagonizes Jotaro and his comrades.
-   The apes in _Princess Mononoke_, who distrust and hate San.
-   _Seton Academy: Join the Pack!_: Pan Saruhara is a chimpanzee beast-girl who is portrayed as conniving and malicious, using her mastery of man-made tools and weapons to cheat in order to get ahead in competitions while taking out her rivals.
-   In _So I'm a Spider, So What?_ the Anogratch are a species of aggressive monkey-type monsters. They will attack anything that enters their territory and if a member of a troop is killed the rest will pursue the killer endlessly, no matter how many die in the pursuit. Given their troops can number in the thousands, the Revenge Monkeys are exceptionally dangerous. Their evolved form, the Bagragratch, is a much larger and stronger baboon-type monster but is actually considered less of a threat as it lacks the Vengeance and Wrath skills of the previous form.
-   Aozaru from _The Twelve Kingdoms_.
-   _Ushio and Tora_ has two notable examples: The Namahage, a monster who skins women and devours their intestines in an attempt to turn into a human, is revealed to be the transformation of a macaque, who originally wanted to become a human for the sake of his childhood human friend but eventually lost himself in villainy. A later arc has some monstrous babboons lead by a gigantic white elder monkey, who enjoy eating young women. They are a nod to the tale of Shippeitaro.

    Asian Animation 

-   One of the rival teams faced by the Sunny Farm F.C. in _Dreamkix_ had several spider monkeys who'd physically impede their progress, even in blatant displays like covering Roy's eyes and trying to drag George down. Yet they were apparently not committing fouls because they were deemed "too small and weak to really physically assault anyone".
-   _Happy Heroes_: As shown in episode 31 of Season 2, among planet Gray's graduate monsters is a giant ape that Big and Little M.'s commander describes as "ferocious".
-   _Rimba Racer_: OoAa the chimpanzee is never shown to speak intelligibly, unlike the other Funny Animals on the show, and tends to screech and grab people when annoyed.

    Comic Books 

-   From _Astro City_ There's the Brass Monkey, a foe of Jack in the Box, who was a janitor whose soul got transferred into a monkey statue.
-   _Big Bang Comics_: Thunder Girl's Arch-Enemy is Dr. Hy Q. Binana: a Mad Scientist talking chimpanzee who styles himself "the most brilliant chimpanzee on the planet!"
-   _The DCU_:
    -   Gorilla Grodd, one of _The Flash's_ major villains, is probably the most archetypal example of this trope, because of his utter disdain for humanity, psychopathic nature and plots to make gorillas the dominant species on Earth. Do NOT call him a monkey, though — unless you really want to make him mad. And he hates bananas.
    -   Likewise, Ultra-Humanite sort of fits this trope, as he is a Mad Scientist inside an albino gorilla's body.
    -   DC love this trope; in addition to the two examples above, there's also the late Monsieur Mallah, a superintelligent machine-gun-toting communist revolutionary homosexual French-speaking gorilla (seriously), the muscle (and lover) of the also deceased Brain. Coincidentally, Grodd killed both of them in _Salvation Run_.
    -   In the _Saga of the Swamp Thing_ story arc, a demonic creature resembling a marmoset fed on the terrors of traumatized children.
    -   While the original Giganta was a Killer Gorilla transformed into a human body via a Devolution Device, the Post-Crisis Giganta was a human scientist whose mind was transfered into a gorilla as an emergency act to save her life when she was dying of a genetic condition.
-   Hans Gruber, one of the bad guys from The Eye of Mongombo, has a chimpanzee named Boris who does whatever Gruber wants for Nutter-Butters.
-   _The Final Plague_: During a quarantine, some scientists are investigating a breach, and find an undead monkey attacking someone.
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   Ape X from _Squadron Supreme._ Which in Squadron Supreme tradition is a homage to the above comic book supermonkeys.
    -   Red Ghost and his Super Apes are enemies of the Fantastic Four. Red Ghost has the power of Intangibility, the gorilla has Super-Strength, the orangutan has Voluntary Shapeshifting, and the mandrill is a Gravity Master.
    -   Marvel also has a C-Lister mutant villain called The Mandrill, because he looks like a humanoid mandrill. He has a weird backstory involving prenatal exposure to radiation that left him deformed in a way that made his father think he was born from adultery, and he's infamous for the fact that he's an out-and-proud misogynist with women-specific Living Aphrodisiac powers, which he uses to enslave women as patsies, goons and sex-slaves. There's a reason Marvel prefers to not bring him up any more.
-   The Disney _Mickey Mouse Comic Universe_ features the monkey mad scientists Ecks, Doublex, and Triplex as enemies of Mickey Mouse. Another comics pal of Mickey's is the tough robot operator Sam Simian, seemingly a gorilla. There's one story where Mickey and Sam take on the three Professors. Apart from Mickey himself, everyone in the story is a monkey!
-   _Rebel Dead Revenge_: Satan uses a reanimated monkey as his Meat Puppet, making for an exceptionally vicious example.

-   In _Creepshow_, the monster in the segment titled "The Crate" resembles a grotesque, fanged baboon.

-   The Pak in _Known Space_ are the ancestors of mankind, and are known to Earthly science as _Homo habilis_; young Pak look like somewhat leggy chimpanzees. Their life cycle is odd, consisting of an animalistic "breeder" phase followed by eating a poisonous root, Tree of Life, that mutates them into Protectors, hyper-intelligent, super-strong sociopaths concerned only with the protection of their progeny. Most of them regard human beings as competitors, and therefore as appropriate targets for genocide.

-   Among the factions of _Feng Shui_ are the Jammers, intelligent apes working in concert with the few humans immune to the influence of Chi. They're a faction of Mad Bombers who do not care one whit about who they blow up, so long as they get to blow up Feng Shui sites and bring about Battlechimp Potemkin's dream of a world without chi.

-   _Ape Escape_ is about tracking down and catching dozens upon dozens of mischievous monkeys and thwarting the schemes of their leader, an uplifted circus monkey named Specter.

    -   _Donkey Kong Country_ has Manky Kong, who throws barrels at you. They're members of the Kong family that were disowned _because_ of their aggressive behavior.
    -   _Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!_ has Minky Kong, who throws nuts at you when you climb up ropes.
-   _Eastern Exorcist_: The Mandrill King, a powerful demon with a babboon motif, is the game's Big Bad and a the overlord of the monsters terrorizing the land. There's also an early boss, the Snow Ape, an albino simian demon who serves the Mandrill King.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Giant Fist_: The frenzy wind that affects the animals in the first stage has even the monkeys aggressively attack the player, jumping in at an angle from above.
-   _Einhänder_: The Mini-Boss "Ausf A Gestell" is a Humongous Mecha ape. It attacks the player's ship like a deranged robot monkey would as well as having a number of dangerous weaponry. Befittingly enough, its battle theme is called "Madness".
-   _Freedom Planet 2_ features a hyperactive tarsier assistant named Aaa, aptly named for his tendancy to scream whenever asked for his name. He aids Corazon Tea in fulfilling Merga's plans to resurrect Bakunawa and built lots of contraptions to slow the heroines down.
-   _Kuon_: the Yang Chapter has the heroines going to the mountain shrine through a dark mountain path infested with both Yamabito (zombies) and Mashira, massive, ferocious undead monkeys which will attack Sakuya with great speed and ferocity. Their boss, a massive monster erroneously called "Yeti" in some sources, patrols a ruined hut where a plot-relevan item is kept and will later ambush Sakuya in a glade as a boss fight.
-   _The Legend of Spyro_: The villains of the first two games, the Apes, are an army of aggressive and violent mandrill-like monkeys trying to take over the world, and most of them tower over Spyro.
-   _Mario Party 7_: The minigame Apes of Wrath begins as two dueling characters eat apples... and a group of Ukikis watch them and get mad (since they own the territory and don't like others eating the surrounding fruits). Cue the characters running for their lives. Whoever gets captured by the Ukikis will lose the duel, and render the other player victorious.
-   _Monster Eye_ have swarms and swarms of vicious chimpanzees in the amusement park area, which the player will need to shoot at. And at the end of that stage, the players will battle the boss, a King Kong Copy giant gorilla.
-   _The Outfoxies_: Dweeb isn't just a simian murderer, he is a simian hitman for hire. And he doesn't protest against killing off his cohorts.

-   _Pokémon_: Mankey and its evolution, Primeape are characterised for their Hair-Trigger Temper and violent outbursts, making them notorious for going on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge for minor slights. Various renditions of Primeape describe it as being willing to "chase you down **forever**" in order to give you a thorough beating if you piss it off. It gets even worse once it evolves into Annihilape, where it transcends physical limits through sheer rage and becomes a Fighting/Ghost type.
-   _RuneScape_: The monkeys and apes of Ape Atoll form a terrifying militaristic faction bent on world domination. And during the Do No Evil quest, where the desert god of monkeys has her senses split into 3 parts, and they take the form of 3 dark and powerful gorillas.
-   _Smite_: Hun Batz, the Howler Monkey God of the Mayan pantheon, is a rather sinister monkey driven with vengeance of being humiliated by the Hero Twins. While at first being introduced to replace Sun Wukong as the latter received a Darker and Edgier overhaul, at least Wukong's old kit was meant to be silly, Hun Batz made the kit more sinister as he's more serious in cracking the enemy's skulls wide open. Also, he babbles about The End of the World as We Know It because he's Mayan.

    -   _Sonic 3 & Knuckles_: Monkey Dude is a robotic monkey who acts as Coconuts' successor, having a similar appearance and attack pattern and inhabiting Angel Island Zone.
    -   _Sonic Adventure_: Kiki is a robotic monkey who serves as a recurring enemy. He tosses bombs at the player, which can be picked up and thrown, but they explode rather quickly, so you'll have to throw them fast.
-   _Star Fox_
    -   Andross is an evil genius primate who leads an army of Maniac Monkeys and has two of them as his proteges, and is also the page image.
    -   His nephew, Andrew Oikonny, is a highly incompetent Maniac Monkey, a character trait which is Played for Laughs.
    -   His grandson Dash Bowman appears to be a subversion of this trope, as he joins the Star Fox team to clear his family name and right Andross's wrongs, but two of the possible endings of _Star Fox Command_ have him follow in his grandfather's footsteps to become another galactic overlord. So far, there hasn't been a single ape or monkey in Star Fox who hasn't turned evil in some form.
    -   _Star Fox 64_: The Meteo Crusher pilot, yet another monkey who works for Andross. Falco even calls him a monkey in an insulting, derogatory way.

Feeding them a banana makes them sleep and drop their parts. Later on the slow, fat Chimps are replaced with fast, wheeled Chimps that sleep for a much shorter time.
-   _System Shock 2_ has screeching monkeys with cryokenitic and pyrokinetic powers, who still have their heads cut open and their brains exposed from experimentation.
-   _Temple Run_: The demon monkeys chasing you.
-   _Thief_: The Monkeymen patrol many of the later levels. They're actually easier to deal with than regular guards, due to the fact that they don't count as humans, meaning you can freely kill them even on Expert difficulty.

-   _Top Hunter: Roddy & Cathy_ contains a fierce, gigantic Black Faced Macaque Mini-Boss with sharp claws and More Teeth than the Osmond Family, who escapes a cage to fight the titular characters.
-   _Vigilante 8_: In _Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense_, the Secret Identity of Astronaut Bob O. is none other than a NASA chimpanzee who was sent to space and went insane in the process. Hinting at this is a line in his character bio revealing his favorite foods as being oatmeal and fruit, as well as a scene where the Garbage Man tries to bribe him with bananas in exchange for his stolen moon rover. He manages to hide this with his spacesuit and by speaking through a vocoder, as well as insisting that his name is Bob O., not "Bo-Bo".

    Web Animation 

-   _Gaming All-Stars_: Specter and his army, as well as Andross in _The Ultimate Crossover_ and _Remastered_, are all villainous simians.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Freefall_ chimpanzees were uplifted a century previous, but they retained their aggressiveness and lack of impulse control.

-   One episode of _Back at the Barnyard_ dealt with a space test monkey who pretended to be friendly for awhile before revealing his true colors by somehow intending to take over the entire farm in front of the horrified animals due to his opposable thumbs (which is sort of Fridge Logic as Otis and his friends never had problems with manipulating objects before despite not having opposable thumbs), although it could all be down to playing the entire scenario for comedy.

-   Evil Monkey from _Family Guy_, though he and Chris eventually become friends and he moves on to another boy's closet.

-   _Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts_: Scarlemagne's a twisted, controlling Mandrill who wants to enslave all humans for his own entertainment. So he fits the "Maniac" part pretty well. He outright admits that he's insane, too. His mooks are also various species of primates.
-   _Mr. Bogus_: "Hipster Tripster" featured a trio of monkeys who Bogus plays around with in the first act, but in the second act, they become this after Bogus releases them from their cage.

-   Mojo Jojo from _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ is an evil genius chimpanzee with an oversized brain and one of the girls' oldest and greatest foes. He used to be Professor Utonium's assistant helper monkey, but exposure to Chemical X caused his brain to mutate and grow, and the Professor's newfound love for the girls led to his path of villainy. In _The Powerpuff Girls Movie_, he has a whole army of uplifted simians, but they object to him being the one in charge and start fighting over who should rule Townsville.
    -   Even before Mojo Jojo became sapient, he was a menace that did nothing but smash everything the Professor owned and shoved him while he was working, inadvertently creating the Girls. He is _really_ not happy to be informed of this in the present day.
-   _Primal (2019)_: The eponymous ape-men of the episode "Rage of the Ape-Men" are a tribe of savages with a violent culture, holding some kind of fighting tournament in an arena and having a magical serum that enhances size, strength and aggression. Their champions are gorilla-like brutes, but the commoners are smaller monkey-men (somewhat resembling Japanese macaques or Barbary apes) who Zerg Rush their opponents.
-   _Runaway Brain_: Dr. Frankenollie, the Mad Scientist who swaps Mickey's brain with that of his creation, is a chimpanzee.
-   In one episode of _The Simpsons_, Ned Flanders ends up in a baboon enclosure. The creatures are portrayed frighteningly straight (parodying a similar scene from _The Omen_ with violent baboons), and they almost wind up killing him.

    Real Life 

-   Nonhuman primates in general are extremely dangerous animals.
    -   Baboons are territorial, and they often raid human settlements to steal food. They tend to travel in groups, too.
    -   Inverted with gorillas, who are generally docile and peaceful despite being more menacing in their appearance. In the wild, they’re even known to use diplomacy to resolve disputes amongst themselves and other tribes of their species. Harm them or their families, however, and you will soon learn why they have no natural predators. They also may react aggressively to a human chest pounding, smiling, or even looking them in the eye because these all are insults or threats to them. Unfortunately, these are all common things people do in front of them.
        -   This silverback took particular offence at a young girl chest pounding, and quickly made the other humans laughing at him realise just who they were dealing with, courtesy of a punch that cracked the thick interior glass pane of his enclosure. Watch the reflections in the window closely, and you’ll see the exact moment everyone realises they made a serious mistake!
    -   Chimpanzees are especially dangerous because the common comical and cute portrayal they get in media has led to a mass underestimation of just how violent they can be. Their stooped and modest frames belie their extremely powerful upper body strength, with which they can easily tear human body parts off. People get them as pets for their "cuteness" and have been mauled to death. Seriously, they've been known to torture other chimps, and other animals, to death in the wild. Males fight for and enforce dominance with brutal fights and aggression. They also have been known, as Jane Goodall can tell you, to go to "war", where two troops stay in conflict for a extended period of time until one is entirely wiped out. They also have been caught killing and cannibalizing other chimps, including infant chimps.
    -   It's been well documented and established in the animal kingdom that very few predators, despite the danger they pose, attack with the intent to draw out their prey's suffering; they simply do so to survive and eat, and most wild animals who attack humans do so out of fear or provocation and don't actively try to kill unless they have to. Chimpanzees are an exception. As our closest living relatives and one of the most intelligent animals on Earth, they are one of the few animals to understand the concept of sadism. When they attack other animals - even their own kind - it is often premeditated and planned out by them (individually or more chaotically in groups) and they often go out of their way to inflict as much pain as possible. While many victims of their savage attacks, animal or human alike, survive the encounter, chimpanzees will _make them wish they hadn't_.
        -   Travis was a pet chimpanzee who lived happily and peacefully for 13 years with his human owners. He had been treated like a surrogate son by them and socialized to humans since birth. But one day when he saw his owner's friend holding one of his favorite toys, he savagely mauled her, ripping off her face and hands. His owner tried to stop him by beating him with a shovel and stabbing him with a butcher knife, but he was only stopped when police arrived and shot him.
        -   Passion was a female chimpanzee and mother of three infants. She was part of the Kasakela community, studied and pioneered by Dr. Jane Goodall herself (who gave Passion her name), who took note of Passion's savagery. What was so unique about her? She was essentially a chimp female cannibalistic Serial Killer... of _babies._ She would lure the parents of chimps away using her daughter Pom as a "femme fatale" sort, before capturing, kidnapping and brutally murdering the offspring, then eating them and giving the remains to her three children. She would also viciously maul or kill any parent who wised up to her tactics and tried to defend their babies. Dr. Goodall even noted that her behaviour was very unnatural for a chimpanzee mothers and she was basically the chimpanzee equivalent of Mashilipa, who had no lasting affection for her own infants, when even her daughter Pom, who helped her commit these atrocities, was protective of her own son.
        -   Bruno was a chimp who was born during the Sierra Leone Civil War in the 1990s. After his family were murdered by hunters who claimed his habitat for the war effort and Bruno was exposed to the horrors of war and greatly mistreated, he was sold on the black market as a pet, when a kindly couple bought him for a measly $30. Despite this act of kindness, Bruno's experiences left him with a deep-seated hatred for humans and when he was eventually transferred to the Tacaguma Chimpanzee Sanctuary, he grew into a dangerous and violent chimp quite a bit larger than the other chimps, even becoming the alpha male very quickly. One day in 2006, he and thirty-one followers escaped the sanctuary and they relentlessly attacked a group of four men in a taxi driven by Issa Kanu, who was brutally mauled to death and the three survivors were left greatly injured and mutilated. Bruno was never captured or found. While Bruno is admittedly a more tragic example of this trope, he is still a prime example of just how dangerous chimpanzees can be.
-   _Human_ primates are sometimes considered the most dangerous animals on Earth<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , only outranked by one other animal for most lethal to other humans per year<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Which makes sense, considering we're the only ones with guns and nukes.
-   Jeff Corwin has frequently handled venomous snakes and other reptiles, but dislikes and fears monkeys; everywhere he goes, monkeys cause him problems.
-   Jacco Macacco was an infamous fighting monkey in London who regularly fought against dogs and won, even dogs that were twice his weight. While his species is unknown, some believe him to have been a rhesus macaque based on this etching of his head.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
