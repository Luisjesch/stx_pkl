_"When things get strange, when what goes bump in the night flicks on the lights, when no one else can help you, give me a call. I'm in the book."_

All kinds of Things That Go "Bump" in the Night seem to plague the media. It seems you can't throw a TV remote without hitting ghosts, vampires, The Legions of Hell, aliens, or some other type of monster. Fortunately, wherever there are monsters, there's likely to be people who hunt them, and they ain't afraid of no ghosts.

These folks tend to come in a number of distinct varieties:

1.  The Chosen One, who is also often the Hunter of Monsters.
2.  A small band of concerned but "average" citizens who have taken it upon themselves to deal with the threat(s). The ones who survive long enough can also graduate to Hunter status or become an Occult Detective. May opt to Help the Helpless.
3.  The Freelanced Professional, someone who's been in the business of hunting and fighting vampires, werewolves, wizards, and aliens for a long time, usually was part of the former at some point. Often a Hunter or Occult Detective. Not really a part of any organization (might be loosely) that hunts them, but usually has a network of friends, experts, and allies to help him out.
4.  A quasi-governmental Agency or Secret Society which both deals with the threat(s) and actively strives to keep the citizenry at large ignorant. Often headed up by Da Chief, with a Cowboy Cop protagonist who has been newly recruited from the local police force.
5.  Priests and Nuns who kick ass who worship a Deity or at least follow a religious paradigm that does _not_ approve of such blasphemies.
6.  In The Unmasqued World, government-sanctioned (or possibly non-sanctioned) Cape Busters or the Mutant Draft Board (in variants tilted towards supernatural horrors rather than metahumans) may be called in to deal with it.
7.  A Paranormal Investigation team who investigate ghosts and spirits. Their equipment consists of digital thermometers, cameras, camcorders, EMF meters (to detect paranormal activity) and voice recorders (to record EVP).

Of course, Muggles don't tend to be aware of the existence of the threat, so types 1-5 are often perceived as kooks, often of the Agent Mulder brand. Still, if there's something strange in your neighbourhood...

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_, the Demon Slayer Corps is the only organization capable of handling a demon, especially one that has supernatural Blood Arts. Unfortunately they're not officially recognized by the government and rarely known by the general populace. So while requests are made to the individual swordsman, they usually come from HQ or else a swordsman may investigate suspicious disappearances on their own initiative.
-   In _Devil Hunter Yohko_, Yohko's best friend, Chigako, appoints herself as her manager and starts by trying to promote her as a professional demon slayer, by taking out an ad in the paper. She also tries to make recordings of Yohko's battles, to showcase her abilities, in order to build Yohko's reputation. Though it usually ends up putting Chigako in harm's way, or simply makes Yohko's job more difficult.
-   In _Ga-Rei -Zero-_, two anti-paranormal organizations consist of the Ministry of Defense's Paranormal Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters, staffed by actual Self-Defense Forces officers/soldiers/staff with a few agents who have the ability to detect and see spirits while using weapons and military equipment that have been customized to fight demons. The other is the Ministry of Environment's Supernatural Disaster Countermeasures Division, consisting of agents who can see supernatural entities while relying on custom-made anti-demon weapons and equipment. Both anti-paranormal organizations have access to vehicles that can be used for traveling around Japan such as Chinook helicopters permanently posted to the PDCH while the SDCD has access to Humvees.
-   Shibuya Psychic Research from _Ghost Hunt_, as well as the various other exorcists/investigators who often accompany them.
-   _Ghost Sweeper Mikami_: The titular character runs an agency dedicated to exorcising ghosts that cause trouble, although she has her fair share of run-ins with various supernatural beings, including vampires, werewolves and many others. She's said to be the best at this job, although she only takes works that net her a hefty amount of money.
-   The _Hellsing_ Organization fights a secret war to protect Queen and Country from vampires... with _Dracula_ as their best agent.
-   The titular character of _Hell Teacher Nube_, Meisuke "Nube" Nueno, is a very well-known and respected exorcist. Even though Japanese folklore already gravitates towards him, his school (Doumori Elementary) and his students, people from far and wide seek him out to keep him from having too much free time. Also, his father is a _world_\-renowned warrior monk and spiritualist; his fame is so great that the media constantly hounds him, and he even has fanclubs among Nube's students. By the end of the manga, Nube has moved to another town, leaving the responsibility to protect Doumori to Tamamo and Izuna.
-   _The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service_ is a group of Psychopomps for hire, who speak to the dead and help fulfill their last wishes in exchange for payment.
-   In the _Nasuverse_, the Burial Agency and the Magus Association's Enforcers are the main agencies that police the supernatural. Their main jobs are containing Dead Apostles, eliminating rogue magi, and maintaining the Masquerade by hypnotizing or killed any muggle witnesses. When demons were more common, several clans in Japan were dedicated to hunting them.
-   _Phantom Quest Corp._ is a for profit organization that'll take any case dealing with the paranormal, or the supernatural. Incidentally, the show's intro just happens to be their ad!
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   The Tendo Dojo seems to be the standard place to go in Nerima for demon and ghost sightings. It's stated that battling such things is the responsibility of the "true martial artist," whatever _that_ is. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Specific example: "Mystery of the Marauding Octopus Pot" Filler story, from both manga and anime. Ranma, Soun and Genma are hired to come to a seaside village and deal with a living octopus pot that has been stealing all sorts of things, namely food and women's underwear. Soun and Genma promptly take to their private room and lounge around eating seafood, while Ranma, expressing disdain for their attitude, goes and uses his Gender Bender Curse to stake out the women's baths in order to lure out the lecherous monster. It turns out to be Dirty Old Man Happosai, raiding the village to care for a beautiful moocher (anime version) or because he's a dick (manga).
-   The DWMA forces in _Soul Eater_ deal with supernatural threats, usually involving demons or witches. If any other organizations are involved, we don't see them.
-   The Sumeragi Family of onmyouji, as portrayed in _Tokyo Babylon_, will deal with anyone's paranormal issues if hired, to the point that the current head of the family is so busy he can't attend school on a regular basis.
-   _YuYu Hakusho_: Yusuke and friends provide a Demon Slaying service.

    Comic Books 

-   _Atomic Robo_: Robo starts out as a type three who either gets recruited to deal with assorted mad science nonsense or stumbles on it of his own accord, then later starts a business to do it with more reliable backup. Later in his career, the appeal has kind of worn off for him, and he repeatedly grouses that all he _wants_ to do is just regular science, but no, he has to keep running around putting out everyone else's fires and getting beaten half to scrap while doing so.
    
    **Robo:** I have _got_ to restructure my life so I spend more time reading abstracts and less time punching dinosaurs.
    

-   _Hack/Slash_ is about a former Final Girl who becomes a slasher\-hunter.
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   In _AXIS_, this ends up being Hobgoblin's big shtick as he realizes that Good Feels Good and turns self-help guru.
    -   Doctor Strange is the go-to guy for dealing with most supernatural threats, and people often come directly to him to deal with their supernatural problems. Since he's the Sorcerer Supreme, it's pretty much in his job description. Or Brother Voodoo or Magik if Strange isn't around.
    -   So your planet is about to get devoured again. Who you gonna call? Why, the Fantastic Four, of course!
    -   In cases of victims of psychic attacks, Professor Charles Xavier of the X-Men is usually the only expert who can treat such casualties.
-   As noted in the Western Animation tab, the _Scooby-Doo_ gang don't wind up facing actual ghosts and the mysteries they stumble upon are usually unintentional. This is inverted in the Gold Key comic of _Scooby_, as starting with issue #14 the gang became ghost breakers for hire.
    
    **Scooby:** _\[thought balloon\]_ Oh, brother... get in the newspapers for solving a few mysteries and pretty soon your services are in high demand.
    
-   The _Vampirella_ comics have featured different variations of this trope:
    -   The main character herself is a vampire who protects humans from supernatural threats. She is often aided by demon hunter Adam Van Helsing and the wizard Pendragon.
    -   During the 90s, Vampirella was allied with the Danse Macabre, an organization that fought supernatural threats with considerably more extreme measures. They were unfortunately wiped out by the villainess Nyx, who also killed Vampirella herself.
    -   _Vampirella: The New Monthly_ introduced the comic's Church Militant variant of this trope called the Sisterhood, an organization of nuns who fought the supernatural.
    -   A later run in the early 2000s introduced the World's End Circus, a covert branch of the FBI tasked with fighting supernatural threats.

    Fan Works 

-   In a Missing Trailer Scene for the Halloween Episode of _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_, Calvin claimed he was going to call the Ghostbusters, but Hobbes called him a fool as it was their busiest night.
-   _Child of the Storm_:
    -   It becomes something of a Running Gag for one character or another to have Xavier recommended to them as either a teacher or more frequently, a therapist, since he's pretty much the only therapist in the superhuman community — though as Harry points out when this is lampshaded, he's also the best.
    -   MI13 tend to be the ones who are called in to handle superhuman and/or supernatural nonsense in Britain, to the increasing disgruntlement of the Ministry.
    -   Harry Dresden is the man who investigates the weird in Chicago as part of his Occult Detective shtick, though even SHIELD sometimes turn to him for his near-unrivalled skills as a supernatural tracker. His later teacher and girlfriend Wanda Maximoff is suggested to have spent most of the last decade and a half dabbling in this too.
-   "Who Ya Gonna Call?" was a 1988 fan story for the _Doctor Who_ fanzine Time Log that paired the sixth Doctor and Peri with the Ghostbusters. They're both investigating strange goings on in Arkham, Massachusetts, although the Doctor resolutely refuses to believe in ghosts.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Beowulf (2007)_: "I'm here to kill your monster."
-   Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, and Porky Pig parody _Ghostbusters_ with _Daffy Duck's Quackbusters_. They even have a tagline:
    
    _"Spooks spooked, goblins gobbled, U.F.O.s K.O.'ed, aliens alienated, vampires evaporated, and monsters remonstrated!"_
    
-   _First Squad_: The titular squad is a Russian counter-occult special force consisting of five teenagers, set during World War II. Only one of them lasts more than fifteen minutes into the first film, but luckily, she can channel the ghosts of her comrades.
-   One of the oldest examples is the Mickey, Donald and Goofy cartoon "Lonesome Ghosts", in which the trio run a Ghost Exterminator Agency.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter_ is about... Abraham Lincoln hunting vampires. The only other hunter shown in the film is Henry, the guy who trains Lincoln, though it's sort of implied that Henry recruits and trains other hunters on a regular basis.
-   The Boys from _Bad Taste_, who respond to threats from outer space.
-   In _Casper_, Dr. Harvey is ultimately called to exorcise the Haunted House, but Carrigan tries a few other professionals first — even one of the trope namers, who is run out of the house by the Ghostly Trio and tells the new owners:
-   In _Demon Hunters_ from Dead Gentlemen Productions, the aforementioned Hunters of Demons are the Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch — an official branch of Heaven that deals with Hell's agents. "You've heard of Hell's Angels? Well, we're... Heaven's Demons."

-   _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_: Newt Scamander, an expert on magical creatures, seems to be the magical equivalent of an animal control expert.

-   _Ghostbusters (1984)_: "If there's something strange... in your neighborhood... who you gonna call?" "**GHOSTBUSTERS!**" Probably the most well-known "concerned citizens" example who are formerly parapsychologists. Although they're also making money off it and for that reason, they encourage the muggles finding out. Peter Venkman even lampshades it in the sequel:
    
    **Peter Venkman:** "Sometimes, weird things happen, _someone_ has to deal with it, and _who you gonna **call**_?"
    

-   The Frog Brothers in _The Lost Boys_. Teenage vampire hunters, they state "We're dedicated to a higher purpose. We're fighters for truth, justice, and the American way."
-   _Men in Black_ takes the "secret government agency" approach, with the titular agency having the dual role of protecting the Earth from malevolent aliens and keeping those benevolent aliens living on the planet from being discovered.

-   Dr. Lesh and her crew, Ryan and Marty from _Poltergeist (1982)_. They're just parapsychologists who study on ghosts, creaking doors and cold spots.

    Literature 

-   _Beowulf_: The eponymous hero takes on the demon Grendel, Grendel's mother, and eventually a dragon; not in self-defense but because he wants to.
-   R.S Belcher's _The Brotherhood of the Wheel_ has the titular Brotherhood protect humanity from supernatural threats and psychopathic killers. Additionally, the FBI has the real-life special taskforce "Highway Serial Killings Iniative" to investigate and keep under wraps serial killer packs, such as the Finders and the Zodiac Lodge, who use the highways to hunt.
-   The title character of _Carnacki the Ghost-Finder_ functions as this, and more than anything else resembls a cross between the Ghostbusters and Sherlock Holmes.
-   _Conan the Barbarian_: Conan has often been hired or recruited to kill a supernatural threat. While some civilized folk aren't impressed with his superstituous ways, he's built a long resume of knowing how to kill monsters.
-   Most investigators in the _Cthulhu Mythos_ either die or go insane just by learning about the cosmic horrors. However, several stories feature characters who actively fight back against the Mythos. One is Derleth's Professor Shrewsbury, another is policeman-turned-occult hunter Inspector Legrasse (yes, the same one that turns up in _Call of Cthulhu_). Brian Lumley wrote about both occultist Titus Crowe and the Wilmarth Foundation, both dedicated to stopping the various Mythos threats.
-   In _Cyrion_ by Tanith Lee, the titular character is a master swordsman, all-around genius and amateur sleuth in a Sword and Sorcery world. Cyrion's famous for solving problems involving the supernatural.
-   In _Darker Than You Think_, Dr. Mondrick's Humane Research Foundation appears to be an ordinary group of researchers but was actually founded to study and fight shapeshifters. All but one member of the Foundation is killed, but it's implied that he may try to create another more secret organization.
-   The title character of _Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency_ is actually running a hustle to bank on people's credulity, not quite a 'concerned citizen'. Yet he manages to get into, and solve, mysteries the only solution to which are supernatural agents.
-   Parodied, along with every other existing trope ever, in _Discworld_. This particular trope gets its turn in _Reaper Man_:
    
    _"Who is he going to call!_ We're _the wizards around here."_
    
-   Van Helsing from _Dracula_ originally acts as a consultant on abnormal medical phenomena rather than a Vampire Hunter. Luckily, he also happens to be the latter as well, and formally initiates his five new friends into a team of vampire-busters.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   To quote Harry Dresden's Yellow Pages ad: "Harry Dresden—Wizard. Lost Items Found. Paranormal Investigations. Consulting. Advice. Reasonable Rates. No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment." (Ironically, Harry did have to resort to doing a birthday party at least once to make ends meet.) If you need a cop, call 911. If you need a miracle, call Harry Dresden. (In fact, he gets a fair number of calls _from_ the cops — most usually from Karrin Murphy.)
    -   There's also the Knights of the Cross, though you don't usually call for their help so much as they show up at exactly the right moment to save the day. Working for the Almighty gives you a good sense of timing.
    -   To a lesser extent, the Paranet. They're a grassroots group of minor magical talents and those in the know who banded together for mutual protection, colaborative work, and to spreading information within their community. They don't have access to the elite Wizard-level knowledge or power, but having been helped organized by one helps. Arguably, their greatest asset is the ability to use the internet to communicate and operate, without having the magical juice to break the machine they're using to access it.

-   _Forest Kingdom_: Book 3 of the _Hawk & Fisher_ spinoff series (_The God Killer_) features the God Squad, a special unit of Haven's police force who deal with supernatural phenomena and entities.
-   _Ghost Finders_ features ghost-hunting investigators from a government-affiliated agency called the Carnacki Institute.
-   _Harry Potter_: The Aurors of the Ministry of Magic are mostly magical law enforcement (they apprehend dark wizards). The books mention many other departments of the Ministry of Magic that deal with magical creatures and spirits for the sake of the Wizarding (and Muggle) community.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_: This is, technically, the intent of the SOS Brigade. Thanks to their leader, they tend to make things much worse whenever they actually get a case.
-   _Jakub Wędrowycz_: Jakub is an amateur exorcist, and yet one of the most effective experts in his profession in the world. The setting also includes traditional priest exorcists, while Jakub is just an old drunkard who makes a living by making moonshine, but he's not any less effective, though his methods rely less on religious rituals and more on blunt force (well, that and some Ritual Magic).

-   In the _Jules De Grandin_ stories by Seabury Quinn, the eponymous famous expert and Master of All Occult Detective will solve your supernatural problems (and the occasional mundane case) for money or pro bono — and if it's an especially heinous criminal, Jules will happily give him a horrible death.
-   The protagonist of _Labyrinths of Echo_ works in the "Minor Secret Investigations Forces". They deal with magical crime (you don't send normal policemen against an insane wizard capable of blowing up a city block or raising a cadaver army) and variety of dangerous monsters — and sometimes one leads to another. As to the ghosts, they are rarely lucid, thus some end up as targets; on the other hand, the best-performing branch (in a bustling port city at that) of Secret Investigations itself is composed entirely of mages' ghosts.
-   There are plenty of these agencies in _Lockwood & Co._, which is set in an Alternate Universe where hauntings have become rampant.

-   A couple of short fantasy novels, _Ogre Castle_ and _In The Sea Nymph's Lair_, feature a wizard-and-apprentice team who specialize in exorcising the many, many ghosts left behind by a recent war among archmages.
-   In _Pact_, Andy and Eva — two local witch hunters in the small town of Jacob's Bell — are supplied and trained by a loose organization of Canadian hunters of the supernatural based out of Montreal.

-   _Rental Magica_ is about a "magical problem solving" business, and it started with hunting a runaway "dog", then many of other missions were—or ended up being—about fighting some or other monster (when it wasn't about fighting some crazy wizard).
-   _Repairman Jack_: Jack has been _pushed_ into this role by the machinations of the Otherness and the Ally, although he'd far rather be "fixing" mundane problems for his customers. He doesn't advertise his services against supernatural threats, but people keep referring anyone with that kind of problem to him anyway.
-   _Rivers of London_: The Folly are a long-established covert unit of the Metropolitan Police who specialize in "magical crime".
-   Grettir from _The Saga of Grettir the Strong_ makes a habit of dispatching undeads and trolls.
-   _Shadow Police_ is about a group of cops who initially get drawn into the occult while investigating a gangster who has turned to black magic.
-   Real Life firefighter Sean Grigsby's _Smoke Eater_ novels feature an elite force of high-tech _dragon_\-fighters, called to action by the emergence of man-eating incendiary reptiles from the depths of the Earth.
-   One _Star Wars_ novel, _Destiny's Way_, gives us this quote.
    
    _"Well, what happens if you need a diplomat who can also practice philosophy, fight with a lightsaber, and levitate small objects? Who else are you going to call but us?"_
    

-   _The Witcher_: Witchers alter themselves with physical discipline, meditation and alchemy to develop the enhanced abilities and magic needed to fight monsters. Though they traditionally do this for a fee, the fee is at their discretion and can be suited to what the employer can afford; for example, expecting gold from lords and kings but saving a peasant's farm for a home-cooked meal.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_: Despite being the Trope Namer for We Help the Helpless, most of the time, Angel is involved as a Chosen One. Early on, he follows visions sent by Powers That Be. Prophecies tend to replace the visions as a motive force later, prompting fate\-al conflict on all sides.
-   Batman is literally called via the Bat-phone in _Batman (1966)_, and usually to battle only bizarre supercrime.
-   One episode of _Beetleborgs_ features a "Dr. Buster Zapper", a ghostbuster-like phasm hunter hired by Trip and Van to capture Flabber. In reality, he's a Snake Oil Salesman who doesn't know squat about real ghosts.
-   In _Blue SWAT_, the main organization of the same name is a police unit dedicated to conducting anti-alien black ops.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   While Buffy is the chosen one type, she can also team up with a gang of "concerned citizens" to stop the forces of evil (like vampires and demons) into taking over Earth and killing the innocent.
    -   Theoretically backed by a Secret Society, and in one season an official government Agency turns up as well. The phrase itself is lampshaded in "The Killer in Me":
        
        **Buffy:** No, it's not a book thing. It's a phone thing.  
        **Spike:** Who you gonna call? _\[beat\]_ God, that phrase is never going to be usable again, is it?  
        **Buffy:** Doubt it.
        
-   Every time someone has a problem may call _El Chapulín Colorado_ by saying always the same catchphrase: "Oh, ¿y ahora, quien podrá defenderme?" ("Aw, and now, who could defend me?"). These problems often include supernatural creatures or aliens.
-   _Charmed (1998)_: The Charmed Ones, of course, but when _they_ need to get rid of evil spirits that plague the manor, they call upon the services of a witch doctor. He is actually described as someone who gets rid of the Things That Go "Bump" in the Night.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Doctor is the freelance professional (or "ancient amateur") variety. They tend to show up based on the whims of their sentient time machine, but a handful of people know how to contact them on purpose. Lampshaded in "Army of Ghosts", where the Doctor quotes this title. Called by name again in "Last Christmas". The Twelfth Doctor is much more overtly conscious of playing this role than some of his predecessors were. In "Extremis", he calls _himself_ to warn of the Monks' impending invasion of Earth.
        
        **The Doctor:** I'm doing what everyone does when the world is in danger: I'm calling the Doctor!
        
    -   UNIT, especially in the Third Doctor era, where he was grounded on Earth for a significant period and worked as their advisor against alien threats. They continue to show up intermittently to this day.
    -   The revival has other groups that try to track the Doctor specifically. Both fall under the "concerned citizen" status. Neither has a huge survival rate once the other alien horrors start showing up.
-   The _Doom Patrol (2019)_ episode "Sex Men" sees the eponymous group basically as a sex-theme version of the Ghostbuster, trying to keep the world safe from sex-based extinction. They arrive at the Doom Ptrol's doostep after Elasti-Woman's immodest orgasm summons a demon capable of such a thing.

-   _Fringe_:
    -   The Fringe Division is a covert Government Agency of Fiction dedicated to dealing with Weird Science cases. The trope name is actually spoken by Walter Bishop in one episode.
    -   Also, in the Alternate Universe, where the freaky "laws of physics are falling apart" kind of events are so common and powerful they couldn't be kept in secret from the public anymore, the Alt-Fringe Division actually has a specific emergency number for these events, so, in case you see a blackhole-like vortex in your neighborhood, call 711.
-   Long before the Columbia Pictures version, Filmation (usually an animation company) created a live-action series called _The Ghost Busters_ which starred Forrest Tucker and Larry Storch, who both previously starred in the sitcom _F Troop_. It would go on to inspire Filmation's later animated series (called simply, _Ghostbusters_), which was created when the Columbia version became a hit (well, there's a bit more to it than just that, but you get the idea).
-   Every ghost hunting program ever like _Ghost Hunters_ and _Ghost Adventures_. The paranormal investigators may be "concerned" citizens who investigate ghosts, but at least they have their equipment like EMF meters to monitor ghostly activities, voice recorders to record EVP ghosts produce and video cameras to film supernatural occurrences.

-   Detective Nick Burkhardt from _Grimm_ is a cop and _also_ the latest in a line of slayers of fairy-tale-type creatures. Although rather than slaying them, he mostly tries to reason with them, or arrest them if they've committed a crime.
-   _The Invaders (1967)_ features a lone Concerned Citizen fighting an alien infiltration. Just as he started to gain some helpers, the show was canceled.

-   The Enigma Corporation in _Lost Tapes_ are a security firm who deal with the unexplained. The two veteran members seen are both Genre Savvy and completely badass, surviving three supernatural monster attacks and even defeating an Aztec God. Rookie or non-combat trained members are normally Red Shirts, however.

-   In _The Sarah Jane Adventures_, Sarah Jane Smith and her friends are also concerned citizens. Sarah doesn't trust MIB-agencies like UNIT and Torchwood to deal with things sensibly ("Too many guns").

-   _Supernatural_: The hunters are a very loosely organised network of freelance humans who've made it their mission in life to track down and kill supernatural menaces. Rather than being called, they tend to show up on witnesses' doorsteps while posing as regular authorities in order to get more info.
-   _Torchwood_ was established by Queen Victoria to deal with the supernatural threats to her empire, following an encounter with the Doctor and a werewolf. While she resolved to never speak of such incidents, she intended to be prepared for them. However, they are _laughably_ unprepared to fight the Daleks and Cybermen, and wiped out in the first story they appear in. Then one branch of it is brought back and gets its own series. Since it's led by Captain Jack Harkness, they actually get things done.
-   _The X-Files_: Agents Scully and Mulder are FBI Agents called on to solve the X-Files, the FBI's cold case files, deemed unsolvable due to possible supernatural elements.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Many of the secret societies of _7th Sea_ are dedicated to hunting the supernatural.
-   _Bureau 13: Stalking the Night Fantastic_ has a top-secret U.S. government agency hunting paranormal monsters.
-   The players in _Call of Cthulhu_ usually fall into the "concerned citizens" category, unless they work for the modern-day agency _Delta Green_.

-   The _Conspiracy X_ RPG features government agents versus aliens.
-   The Eldritch Society in _CthulhuTech_ is a non-governmental version three, who suffer the small problem that the government currently wouldn't distinguish them from the real nasties, due to their use of the supernatural in their hunts (arguably quite justifiably, their main weapons are summoned organisms that eat the hosts half the time and merge with them the other half) and their fear that the government is too cult corrupted to be trusted.
-   _d20 Modern_:
    -   Department-7 often falls under this trope though its exact layout depends on the campaign in question, but it always deals with whatever the campaign at the time revolves around. Its layout depends on what campaign the characters are participating in. In _Shadow Chasers_ and _Urban Arcana_, it deals primarily with supernatural threats (The difference between the two settings is whether or not _the players_ are supernatural.) In _Agents of Psi_ it has a charter for Psionic agents.
    -   Similarly, the Hoffman Institute from _Dark•Matter (1999)_ investigates strange phenomena. Both Department-7 and the Hoffman Institute (may) exist in the same continuity.
    -   The _d20 Modern_ SRD also has an organisation called the Fraternal Order of Vigilance, which inverts this trope by being more of a hate group.
-   _Deadlands_ features posses of concerned citizens making the West safe from fear and creatures of the night.
-   The _Ghostbusters_ RPG (and its Even Better Sequel _Ghostbusters International_) casts the players as owners of a local Ghostbusters franchise; busting ghosts for clients, fending off the EPA and desperately trying to wriggle out of spurious fees that the main office thinks up to drain money from the players' coffers.
-   _GURPS_:
    -   _GURPS Black Ops_ has a top-secret agency called "The Company" that fights supernatural monsters and aliens.
    -   _GURPS Monster Hunters_ is Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
    -   _GURPS Technomancer_ has "Hellhounds" who hunt demons and undead. Technically, a Hellhound is a member of Leviathan's Cerebus teams, but the term is also used for freelancers such as Eric Keele, Entity Eradicator (who, in the vignette we see him in, is being told by his secretary that the only way they're going to be able to pay for his Depleted Phlebotinum Shells is if he agrees to do a photoshoot for a muscle magazine).
-   The Crab Clan of _Legend of the Five Rings_ is dedicated to protecting Rokugan from the dread corrupting supernatural forces of the Shadowlands.
-   _Little Fears_ features concerned citizen monster hunters still in grade school.
-   The Troubleshooters of _Paranoia_ exist for the purpose of rooting out Commie mutant traitors. Hope no one finds out they _are_ Commie mutant traitors...
-   In _Rippers_, the court alchemist and Rosicrucian magician John Dee, using monster dissection research from his ex-partner Edward Kelley, eventually becomes Jack the Ripper who teaches others "Rippertech" to a number of scientists and wizards. Against the threat of monsters and after his other disciples went rogue, "Dr Jack" along with his disciple Dr. Abraham Van Helsing create the "Rippers", a monster hunter organization that alternately forbid and embrace Rosicrucian magic and Rippertech.
-   In _Shadowrun_, Ares Macrotechnology maintains a number of tactical military units dedicated to finding and eradicating bug spirit nests.
-   The Imperium from _Warhammer 40,000_ faces daemons, aliens, and mutants as daily (and serious) threats, to the point that two branches of the Inquisition, the Ordo Malleus and Ordo Xenos specialize in hunting down and destroying daemons and aliens, and have their own specialized military forces-the Grey Knights and Deathwatch, respectively. The Sisters of Battle also qualify to an extent. The Ordo Hereticus (the third branch of the Inquisition) is responsible for hunting down cultists, mutants and... well... heretics. Of course, given their methods, you may not exactly _want_ to call them. When you _do_, it's a tell-tale sign that things have gone horribly awry.
-   _The World of Darkness_:
    -   The Old World of Darkness had a number of hunter groups, with one particular type of hunter getting their own gameline in _Hunter: The Reckoning_. The new WoD has _Hunter: The Vigil_, a game allowing for the creation of virtually any hunter type. On top of that, the default gametype for nWoD is playing as normal humans — given the setting, these are most likely either Concerned Citizen hunters (who may graduate into the Vigil, and thus become slightly more organized and effective concerned citizens with the potential to become something more)... or Supernaturals-to-be back when they were still normal.
    -   _Orpheus_ plays very strongly into this trope as well; people can hire ghostly agents who can communicate with restless spirits, or, depending on the circumstances, fumigate them.
    -   _Geist: The Sin-Eaters_ also uses elements of this. Sin-Eaters tend to be a bit more lax about the Masquerade than other supernaturals, and some of them pass themselves off as ghost hunters, mediums, and exorcists in order to get a better handle of the ghostly ecology of their respective city.
    -   The fangame _Genius: The Transgression_ has the Karnackis, a group of Geniuses who do this, named after the original Carnacki if misspelled.

    Video Games 

-   _ANNO: Mutationem_: Raymond's Agency is a firm specializing in occult and inexplainable phenomena such as ghouls or a Mad Doctor wearing a plague mask.
-   In _The Blackwell Series_, Rosangela decides to set up this sort of business at the end of _Convergence_ and continues it in _Deception_, complete with business cards and newspaper advertisement. The titular organisation of _Unavowed_, which takes place in the same universe as the _The Blackwell Series_, is a more formal take on the trope, being a secret society which hunts down any supernatural threat preying on the innocent.

-   _Clive Barker's Jericho_ features a special military force of occult soldiers defending the Earth.
-   The titular paranormal P.I. from _Conrad Stevenson's Paranormal P.I._ is contacted to investigate locations around the town of New Eidolon, where there are serious suspicions of paranormal goings-on. As the game progresses, he also acquires the means to remove all types of ghosts and even demonic entities from said locations.
-   _Devil May Cry_:
    -   The eponymous shop, Devil May Cry, hunts demons and devils for a fee. Apparently, the business has been confused for a more generic We Help the Helpless outfit before, hence Dante having a password that only those really needing demons slain would get. Initially, Dante was the only one slaying demons around, but over time, he later had this gig extended to his allies like Lady, Trish, and Nero. The latter even got his own Devil May Cry sign and placed it on Nico's van.
    -   The Order of the Sword from _Devil May Cry 4_ is supposed to act this way for the island of Fortuna. It's a religious group with knights trained to fight demons, but it's eventually shown to be somewhat dubious as the Order uses demonic powers to enhance themselves.
    -   It has been suggested, at least in the expanded materials like the novels, that there are other little demon-hunting outfits in the universe.
-   In the world of _Elite Beat Agents_ and _Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan_, whenever somebody is in desperate need, they shout out, "Heeeaaallp!" The Agents/Ouendan then arrive to help the helpless... help themselves... with music and dance moves. The helpers in this case are part of a semi-governmental agency, making them the third type.
-   The main character in _Elvira_ is an agent of a private "ghoul buster" service, advertised in the back of a tabloid magazine. He's hired by Elvira to investigate her haunted castle; he arrives only after the _real_ crap begins...
-   _First Encounter Assault Recon_ revolves around the eponymous organization, a special unit of the US Army dedicated to fighting paranormal threats to national security, which in the game's case turns out to be a battalion of cloned Super Soldiers led by a cannibalistic psychic.
-   _Gabriel Knight_, the archetypical Chosen One example for this category. Because he's the last surviving Schattenjäger ("shadow hunter"). The second game mentions that in the past Schattenjägers used to belong to categories 2, 4 and 5, being a group of pretty average people (if you forget a large library and a single powerful talisman), some sort of religious order (but definitely not monks), in a world that still believed in supernatural. There are also other organizations with similar objectives, like Brazilian religious order Manos Del Sol ("Men of the Sun"), it's just that Gabriel doesn't know about them.
-   The titular ghost, demon and alien hunting team from _Gaia Attack 4_ spends the entire game battling various supernatural threats around the world, from hunting poltergeists in a British hotel and battling poltergeists inhabiting an Australian junkyard, before ultimately thwarting an alien invasion in the final level.
-   Data East's unreleased Neo Geo game _Ghostlop_ starred a team of professional ghost hunters named Bruce and McCoy. The characters and their associated gameplay were later incorporated into _Magical Drop V_.
-   _Luigi's Mansion_:
    -   In _Luigi's Mansion_, Luigi himself is charged with the capture of the many Boos in the eponymous mansion in order to rescue Mario. Moreover, the Poltergust 3000 he wears makes him slightly resemble an actual "Ghostbuster".
    -   _Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon_ has Luigi and Professor E Gadd actually start up a proper ghost hunting business after the Dark Moon shatters and the ghosts turn 'evil'. Including the whole 'journey to multiple different mansions' thing.
-   Shinra from _Namco × Capcom_ and _Project × Zone_ is dedicated to investigating paranormal activity, most of it coming from the Shibuya district. Their rivals include a Nebulous Evil Organisation called Ouma.
-   Discussed by Junpei in _Persona 3_, who (along with the other protagonists) is a member of a club dedicated to wiping out the Shadows plaguing the city.
    
    **Junpei:** It's like we should have our own theme song, y'know? "Who you gonna call? Shadowbusters!"
    
-   The _Sakura Wars_ series has several Type 4's: the Combat Revues, clandestine government organizations that combat demonic threats with steam-powered Mini-Mecha while masquerading as theater companies. The original series of games have Combat Revues situated in Tokyo, Paris, and New York. _Sakura Wars (2019)_ has a reformed Tokyo-based Revue, as well as new Revues in London, Berlin, and Shanghai.
-   All three Secret Societies in _The Secret World_ are Type 3. They all deal with paranormal threats and occult disasters all while controlling the world from the shadows and keeping the truth from the general public. The Illuminati does this to keep themselves in power and maintain the status quo. The Templars believes it's their sworn duty to fight and protect humanity against all evil. The Dragon, on the other hand, wants to keep the occult and paranormal activities from mucking up their already planned equations and models. They will sometimes send in one of their agents just to see what will happen.
-   _Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters_, as the name implies, has you playing a Paranormal Investigation version of this.
-   Averted in _Touhou Project_, as the main character and youkai exterminator, the shrine maiden Hakurei Reimu often solves the various incidents that happen in Gensokyo without anyone else knowing that she did. That probably explains why she doesn't get that many donations...

    Webcomics 

-   _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_: Dr. McNinja gets called out to deal with everything from appendicitis to giant lumberjack attacks.
-   In _Bram & Vlad_, you can call Van Helsing & Seward, psychiatrists and vampire hunters (they are descendents of the original Van Helsing and Seward).
    
    **Dr. Van Helsing:** Think about it this way: if people believe that they need a vampire hunter, either the people really need a vampire hunter, or they need a psychiatrist.  
    **Dr. Seward:** Conveniently, we are both. We win a job either way, see?
    
-   In _Here There Be Monsters_, Blaine's group of monster hunters is operating in a town with an enhanced weirdness censor, however they are also the town's Animal Control which works out well because every time they've been called out to deal with something mundane like a racoon it is _not_ a racoon.

-   The _Paranormal Mystery Squad_ is a privately run organization, much like Phantom Quest. As their name implies, Demon Slaying is their business, and they take on cases dealing with the paranormal in general — at least until vol. 4, in which they're disbanded by order of PETM, following Stephanie Kane's abduction.

-   Riff in _Sluggy Freelance_ ran a good business selling information and especially weapons to vampire hunters from Alaska, where the nights are longer. One of his clients, Arminius, was a Vampire Hunter, but not always as successfully as he liked.

-   In the _Zokusho Comics_ multiverse, the Wayward Cross is somewhere between type 2 and 3.

    Web Originals 

-   _The League of S.T.E.A.M._ is a Steampunk version of the _Ghostbusters_, a "paranormal pest control service" in a neo-Victorian setting. The _Ghostbusters_ TV ad from the first film is even parodied in a short.
    
    _Whom should you telegram?_
    
-   _The Magnus Archives_: The titular Magnus Institute openly asks people with supernatural experiences to give a statement explaining their experiences. Many people come in looking for help or information, but the Institute never actually _helps_ them in any way — in fact, the statements are used to feed the Beholding, the eldritch fear god that the Institute serves, and anyone who gives a statement will have a recurring nightmare of their experience for the rest of their lives, and those are the ones who get off easy.
-   The _SCP Foundation_ is a solid flavor 4. On bad days, they fight to keep a Crapsack World half full, but most of the time, they tend to the messes made by less dangerous but no less bizarre artifacts and people.
-   _Whateley Universe_: The "Goobers" at Whateley Academy, training to fight supernatural evil under the auspices of Reverend Englund and the leadership of Buffy-wannabe Nightbane. Of course, whenever they go up against Carmilla (twice in earnest so far plus at least once in the simulators), they keep getting their heads handed to them...

    Western Animation 

-   A couple of _Bonkers_ episodes deal with hauntings caused by toon ghosts. During one of the incidents, Bonkers says the trope name, before he and Lucky shake their heads and say "Nah".
-   _The Cuphead Show!_: In the episode "Dead Broke", Cuphead and Mugman decide to raise money to buy ice cream by having their friend Miss Chalice haunt a house, then the cups "catch" her with the victims paying them for their services. Problems arise when they visit a house that's already haunted, with the spirits within wanting to imprison the trio in paintings and take their place.

-   In _Dragons: Riders of Berk_, Hiccup and co. deal with all sorts of dragon-related problems with their services often requested by Berk's villagers.
-   _Family Guy_ parodies this in one episode where the Griffin house is haunted. Reporter Tom Tucker, who's covering the story, delivers this line, followed by his partner sighing and saying "_Ghostbusters_?" Tucker looks at her and says "No, Diane, their insurance company. That's just stupid, what you said."
-   The main characters of _Fangface_ sometimes do this is an unofficial capacity, with many episodes opening with them being called in by a friend to help settle some supernatural goings on. Other episodes, however, show the gang on vacation and getting roped into the mystery through circumstances.

-   Parodied in the _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_ episode "Bloooo". When Bloo's cold causes the inhabitants of the house to believe the house is haunted, Coco picks up a phone. Wilt asks "Who you gonna call?", which leads to Coco saying "Co-coco!" in a way reminiscent of the Ghostbusters' theme song. To which Wilt replies "They've been out of business for years!"
-   _Futurama_: In "Ghost in the Machines", Bender's ghost haunts Fry, who decides he needs to bust this ghost and starts to dial a phone. Hermes asks "Who you gonna call?", to which Fry replies "Gho—", but gets a dial tone before the operator replies "The number you have dialed has been lame since 1989."

-   _Martin Mystery_ has the Center as an anti-supernatural/alien agency.
-   The _Phantom Investigators_. "So remember — if you're up to your eyeballs in bioplasm, ectoplasm, or phantasms, don't spasm — call Phantom Investigators, where you'll get no sarcasm, just enthusiasm!"
-   Mystery, Inc., a.k.a. the _Scooby-Doo_ gang. Subverted in that they very rarely end up dealing with _actual_ spooks, and so often function as more of a We Help the Helpless group. There was also a special called _Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers_, where Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy hire the Boo Brothers, ghost exterminators who are ghosts themselves. ("It takes one to catch one in this business", they claim.)
-   _The Smurfs (1981)_: In the episode "Smurfing for Ghosts", Peewit looks for Papa Smurf's help to get rid of some unwanted ghosts in Quarrel Castle, but gets instead Brainy and Clumsy, who are both armed with vacuum cleaner-type devices that are designed for capturing ghosts. At the end of the episode, as Brainy and Clumsy head back to the village, Brainy asks Peewit, "Who are you gonna smurf?", and Clumsy answers, "Autosmurfers".
-   Discussed in an episode of _The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper_ which has the characters mysteriously being erased. Casper rings up a hotline, which amongst other things, prompts him to dial 2 if they are being harassed by a Ghostbuster.

    Real Life 

-   Easington District Council! Or at least they pay for them.
-   The ones who have been called most often in Real Life to scare away the Things That Go "Bump" in the Night, going back through all of recorded history (and _before_), are Papa Wolf and Mama Bear. It's part of the job.
    -   Domestic dogs have served in this capacity for a very long time too, even back into the days when the strange noise in the night might _actually be_ a sabertooth cat or pack of dire wolves.
-   Though disbanded now, the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) was a group backed by a wealthy businessman that brought together various scientists to investigate reports of the paranormal/supernatural. Their most famous investigation was probably that of Skinwalker Ranch in Utah.
