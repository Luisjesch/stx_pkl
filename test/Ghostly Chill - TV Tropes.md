_"You ever feel the prickly things on the back of your neck?  
And the tiny hairs on your arm, you know when they stand up?  
That's them. When they get mad... it gets cold."_

One side-effect of the manifestation of ghosts or other spirits of the dead is coldness. Mirrors and windows may frost over, people's breath may make visible steam, and someone may comment on how cold it has got all of a sudden. The feeling may be especially acute if someone is being walked through, or is walking through, an immaterial ghost.

Sometimes this is explained by the ghost drawing on ambient heat energy to manifest (often with a fine disregard for thermodynamics), but just as often it's merely an unexplained side effect of ethereal activity. Objects that are ghost-touched often exhibit this trait as Thermal Dissonance.

Compare Evil Is Deathly Cold, Snow Means Death, Chill of Undeath, and I'm Cold... So Cold....

    Anime & Manga 

-   This is used often on _Ghost Hunt_. The Shibuya Psychic Research team even has special thermal cameras that measure room temperature to help them detect ghosts/supernatural activity.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Taken to a logical extreme in Parts 1 and 2, where the element of cold belongs to The Undead, such as vampires and zombies, as well as the Pillar Men.
    -   In Part 3 and onwards, there are a couple of Stands that have ice powers and, given the motifs associated with stands, play this very straight, such as Pet Shop's stand Horus and Ghiaccio's stand White Album.
-   The title character of _My Lovely Ghost Kana_ is observed chilling a beer in her cleavage. The male lead insists that she _does_ have a warmth (and even a heartbeat!), but it's difficult to detect.
-   In the 60 years of her haunting seat number 1, Sayo of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ gained almost complete exclusivity of the spot since it had become infamous as the seat that gives an otherworldy chill to those who sit there.
-   While not _technically_ a ghost, Brook of _One Piece_ learns how to use his power to channel the energy of the Underworld through his attacks, which gives them an additional icy effect.

    Fan Works 

-   In _A Boy, a Girl and a Dog: The Leithian Script_, when a disembodied soul touches a living, it feels like the air has become suddenly slightly colder. Likewise, the dead feels a slight sensation of warmth.
    
    **Warrior:** What was it like, when you two intersected? \[...\] You and his Majesty's father — we saw it when you were talking.  
    **Beren:** Oh. _\[glancing up at Finarfin\]_ Not much. Like light, I guess, — like when the sun bounces off something like a horse-brass or a sword, you know how you don't really feel it unless it's in your eyes, but you can tell sort of. For me at least.  
    **Finarfin:** _\[looking at the Warrior's shade\]_ Of what matter is thy question?  
    **Beren:** What it felt like, when you tried to take the Ring from me. We were wondering — earlier, that is — what would happen if someone living hit one of us.  
    **Finarfin:** I did not strike thee, boy, nor did e'en attempt such.  
    **Beren:** No sir. We meant colliding in general as well — even only by accident. Um, did it — feel like anything to you? _\[pausing\]_ If you're not offended for some reason by me asking that.  
    **Finarfin:** _\[shaking head\]_ \[...\] — Like to naught but to a shadow passed suddenly 'neath on summer's day, or to a chill air, that moveth off the water — and to naught else.
    
-   _Fatal Frame VI: Vengeance_: In chapter 5, the mere presence of Ayumi Oshiro makes the room so cold that Sumiko's breath becomes visible.
-   The ghosts in the cliff dwelling in _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_ have a fear aura and also freeze their opponents.
-   _Magic and Mayhem_: A slight chill in the air is a pretty good sign of the presence of a ghost in the area. Kat is so used to it, she can notice the Ghostly Trio approaching the room before anyone else does or keep track of Casper's exact location even while he's invisible.
-   _Metro Master_: One of the many signs that the titular Metro Master is a ghost is the bitter chill lingering around his office, persisting even in the blistering Kalosian summer. Metro Master Ingo isn't a ghost, and it's implied that the he puts the AC on full blast because he spent years in the freezing mountains of Hisui. The chill persists in summer because his office, like most of the subway, is underground.
-   _You See Them_: To a T. The only indication of a ghost's presence for those who can't see or hear them is the cold feeling on a person's skin whenever a ghost touches them. The surrounding temperature also drops dramatically with a sense of dread when angry ghosts are nearby, and the effects intensify with more of them around.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the _Apocalypse_ film series movie _Tribulation_, Eileen Canboro gets this when she enters the hospital room where a One Nation Earth agent subjects her brother-in-law Jason Quincy to a bit of Mind Rape. The agent relents when he senses the presence of a Christian (Eileen) in the room.
-   In _A Christmas Carol: The Musical_, when Marley's ghost hugs Scrooge, a cold pallor spreads across his body until they break contact.
-   A major feature of the demon's presence in _The Exorcist_. It's _freezing_ in there. When they were making the film they built the set for Regan's room _inside a freezer_, so you could see everybody's breath. One day it actually snowed inside the set. Though hundreds of hours of filming, Linda Blair wore nothing but a thin nightdress. To this day she cannot stand being cold.
-   In _Ghost Town (2008)_, people sneeze whenever they walk through a ghost.
-   _Haunted Mansion (2023)_: Subverted. Bruce wonders whether it's getting colder because of the ghosts, but it turns out that he's just cold because he's not wearing pants.
-   _The Sixth Sense_: The presence of ghosts makes one's breath visible. This is one of the ways the protagonist understands he's actually dead. This actually only happens if the ghost is hostile (which most of them usually are). For most of the film, the protagonist doesn't have this effect... but when he gets frustrated with Cole, the boy's breath becomes visible.
-   In _The Stone Tape_, the scientists speculate that the chill is caused by heat being drawn out of the air and converted to other forms of energy, to create the physical manifestation of the ghost.
-   When Eun-joo returns to the house in _A Tale of Two Sisters_ and enters Soo-yeon's former room, her breath is visible and she is shaking rapidly. It's a sign that Soo-yeon's ghost is present who then proceeds to attack Eun-joo.
-   In the opening narration to _The Uninvited (1944)_, Rick says "You get to recognize a peculiar cold, which is the first warning." Sure enough, the presence of spirits in the Haunted House is signaled by a mysterious chill in the studio.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Fighting Fantasy_
    -   _Crypt of the Sorcerer_, overlapping with Our Ghosts Are Different, have you encounter Ice Ghosts in the howling tunnels. These specters have a chilling touch that upon contact with any living being, will freeze their blood solid — you'll need a set of magic stones to repel the effects of touching one.
    -   _Legend of Zagor_ has a one-shot encounter with a supernatural creature called a Skulking Shade, a ghost from an especially spiteful servant of evil who hides in the shadows and could ambush you from the darkness. It's touch is so chilling that you lose two STAMINA points even before you can fight it.
    -   _Bloodbones_ has another minor enemy, the Chiller, a ghost inhabiting a freezing-cold room who can bring down the temperature of the room it's haunting.

    Literature 

-   Dimity uses this cold as one of her weapons against an unwanted visitor in _Aunt Dimity's Death_.
-   In _Bones of Faerie_, ghosts are the shadows of the dead give off a cold aura.
-   A recurring theme experienced by the heroine in _The Dark Beneath The Ice_ is numbness, and icy water.
-   In J.R. Lowell's _Daughter of Darkness_, you could always tell when Willie's mother was about to show up. The temperature dropped by a good fifteen degrees.
-   Ghosts in _Feliks, Net & Nika_ can be detected by drop of temperature they cause. It's not much — 3 degrees at most - but it's enough for main characters to track ghosts with strategically placed thermometers with Bluetooth.
-   _Galaxy of Fear: Ghost of the Jedi_ has the presence of the titular ghost cause a chill in the air.
-   Ghosts in _Harry Potter_ are intangible heat sinks; walking through one is like taking a cold shower. Dementors also fit, freezing the environment around them.
-   Played with in _Hurog_: the haunted castle Hurog is so cold that the protagonist needs a fire even in summer (though that might be Truth in Television — the protagonist spent his whole life there, so of course to him it's normal). On the other hand, the soul that is bound to the castle can manifest a human body that is surprisingly warm and unghostly.
-   One of a few signs of ghostly activity in _Lockwood & Co._. Agents assigned to investigate and fight ghosts carry thermometers as part of their toolkits and regularly take temperature readings when in a haunted area.
-   At the end of _Making Money_, the professor's ghost is installed into a front-row seat in a strip club. From then on, no patron who sits in it manages to stay for more than a few seconds.
-   In _The Secret of Crickley Hall_, ghosts may drain atmospheres of energy, resulting in tiredness, darkness, and cold — sometimes strongly enough to nearly put out a fire, or freeze bathwater.
-   In _Shaman Blues_, people sensitive to supernatural, such as Konstancja or Witkacy, can feel ghost's presence as sudden drop in temperature.
-   In _Smoke and Mirrors_, ghosts function exactly as specified in this trope. They draw on ambient heat in order to physically manifest, and contact with them chills living people.
-   In the _Towers Trilogy_, ghosts are invisible to most people, but can be felt as a ghostly chill when touched.
-   In _The Traveling Triple-C Incorporeal Circus_, how much chill a person feels is dependent on how inherently receptive they are. Some people ignore a ghost passing through them entirely, while others may feel it so strongly that they stop in place.
-   In the _Ultramarines_ novel _The Killing Ground_, an atrocity's vengeful ghosts are "glacial cold."

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_:
    -   In "RmWAVu", Cordelia is unimpressed when a ghost sends cold winds rushing through her apartment.
        
        **Cordelia:** Uh, cold wind, scary! What are you going to do? Chap me to death?
        
    -   Inverted when Spike turns up as a ghost in Season Five. Fred notes that, while most ghosts absorb heat, he's radiating it. Because he's being slowly pulled into Hell, it turns out.
        
        **Spike:** Think I'm hot, do you?  
        **Fred:** Hmm. Lukewarm. Just above room temperature.
        
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Referenced in "Out of Mind, Out of Sight". The fact that Buffy _didn't_ experience this is a clue that they're dealing with something else.
    -   In "Where the Wild Things Are", Graham and Forrest complain how cold the haunted frat house is.
-   _Doctor Who_: In "The Unquiet Dead", the morgue is the place in the undertaker's house where the most "ghostly" activity has been seen, and when the Gelth (who are not _technically_ ghosts) appear, it cools way down.
-   _Ghost Adventures_: They crew have pointed out themselves with goosebumps as well carrying meters that read temperature, all the more noticeable whenever the locations they're locked down are either during the summer or it's usually warm/hot.
-   Occurs occasionally in _Ghost Hunters_, usually followed by the explanation that "cold spots" may or may not be ghosts depending on the specific circumstances of the spot itself. Always discounted by the investigators as it's not conclusive evidence of anything, and a lot of cold spots can be faked.
-   In _The Master's Sun_, Kang Woo shudders when running past the piano player's wife. She's been kept in a deep freeze since her death, so that may be part of it.
-   In _Rose Red_, Cathy wanders into a room, unknown to her that a ghost is present, and she remarks about how freezing cold the room is.
-   Used a lot in _Supernatural_ to signify that a ghost is lurking somewhere nearby. Usually noted by the character's breath fogging up suddenly in a room.
-   _Truth Seekers_: Room 2 at the Portland Beacon is haunted, freezing and affected by electrical anomalies. The management interpret this as heating and wiring problems, and closed the room to visitors.
-   Si-ohn's second ghostly vision in _Who Are You?_ is the ghost of a young woman who brings a Ghostly Chill along with her, making the environment cold whenever she appears. This applies even to people who don't have Si-ohn's I See Dead People knack, like the woman on the bus who shivers and puts on a sweater when the ghost manifests herself.

    Music 

-   Stars (Canadian Band): "I Died So I Can Haunt You" describes the air growing cold as a ghost encounters what is implied to be her ex.

    You know that he's there

    Video Games 

-   A good sign that you're entering a crypt or other haunted place in _Avernum_ is the sudden chill in the air.
-   All types of spiritual entities encountered in _Conrad Stevenson's Paranormal P.I._ will cause unnatural temperature drops, as they're believed to siphon off thermal energy from their environment. Detecting those cold spots with a thermometer is required for a perfect score investigation.
-   In _Cursed Treasure_, a skill in the Undead skill tree gives all undead Crypts a chance to cause freezing when they attack an opponent.
-   Many ghosts in _Dominions_ have a cold aura that chills those nearby.
-   Ghosts encountered in _Dubloon_ breath ice as their main attack and are weak to fire to boot, except on Bowish Island where they are fire-elemental.

    -   In _Morrowind_, in Sandas Ancestral Tomb you'll find the skeletons of 2 noble guards, you'll find a key on one of the skeletons and a key on a pillar next to the other skeleton which lead to a room and a cursed chest respectively, if you open this chest you'll receive a message saying "You suddenly feel quite cold...". The skeletons become alive and will attack you.
-   It's also used in the _Geneforge_ series to signify hauntings. Shades, which seem to spontaneously generate in areas of high ambient magic, don't have the same effect.
-   In _Luigi's Mansion_ Luigi's breath is always visible in rooms that have not yet been cleared of ghosts.
-   In _Phasmophobia_, a ghost's presence can be detected by a sudden drop in temperature compared to surrounding rooms. Whether or not a ghost drops the temperature below freezing (as opposed to just "colder than normal") is important evidence in determining what type of ghost is present.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Several Ghost-type mons cause this, referred to as draining the energy from their surroundings.
    -   Special mention goes to Froslass which is based on the Yuki-onna and comes from a line of Ice-types.

    Western Animation 

-   _Ben 10_:
    -   The original series plays this straight with Ghostfreak... once, and only when he passes physically though people. All later instances of Ghostfreak passing into people have Demonic Possession written all over them.
    -   This trope is probably why Big Chill of _Ben 10: Alien Force_ has both intangibility and freezing powers.
-   The eponymous character in _Danny Phantom_ has the ability to sense ghosts, which manifests as a sudden chill and mist coming out of Danny's mouth. Later in the show, this was expanded into full-on freezing powers.
