_"A friend of mine has two Daughters, whom I will call Lætitia and Daphne; The Former is one of the Greatest Beauties of the Age in which she lives. . . . Lætitia has not, from her very Childhood, heard any thing else but Commendations of her Features and Complexion, by which means she is no other than Nature made her, very beautiful Outside. The Consciousness of her Charms has rendered her insupportably Vain and Insolent, towards all who have to do with her."_

— **Joseph Addison**

A character who is beautiful, well aware of the effect they have on other people, and is proud of it.

Regardless of the exact nature of a character's attractive appearance, some characters decide that if they've got an advantage, they might as well use it. A character who follows this trope is proud of their physical attractiveness and view their physical form as a means to get what they want.

Such characters are prone to parading their "assets" in the presence of the opposite sex, sometimes with a little extra bounce in their step, and may often brag about their appearance unknowingly in front of less fortunate, usually younger or self-conscious characters. Unlike more prim and proper characters, they will generally enjoy distracted admirers staring at them, as it makes them feel good about themselves.

A common plot is for this character to be the Veronica of a Betty and Veronica dynamic — sometimes serially, enticing a long line of Archies (who inevitably wise up, leave her, and marry Betties). When _she_ is finally ready to settle down, she finds she set her standards too high, or overestimated how long her beauty would last, and ends up an Old Maid.

See Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful! when they start to use their beauty to get away with offenses and Beauty Breeds Laziness when they feel that their beauty entitles them to not work.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Mimimi of _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_. Unlike other examples of the trope, she's fully aware that beauty can't simply be bought, works as hard as she can to make herself beautiful, and considers inner beauty just as important as outer beauty.
-   _The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!_: Jahy's original form was very beautiful, and she took pride in being one of the most attractive, if not the most attractive, demon in the demon realm. Part of the reason she dislikes her Sleep-Mode Size is because she loses all of her beauty and sexiness and looks like a young child.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Nami. She's attractive, she knows it, and knows how to use it to her advantage.
    -   Averted with Alvida who constantly proclaimed herself to be the most beautiful woman on the seas despite being a grotesquely obese woman. People only agreed with her for fear of her hitting them with her giant mace.
        -   However, played straight later on when she eats the Slip-Slip Fruit and becomes thin and beautiful. So when she asks who's the most beautiful woman in the seas people say it's her and mean it.
    -   Boa Hancock, the most beautiful woman above the sea, manipulates everyone with her beauty, save Luffy. To the point where she's the page quote for Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful!.
    -   "Pirate Prince" Cavendish, captain of the Beautiful Pirates, considers himself to be the prettiest pirate in the world and hates to see his beauty and consequent popularity overshadowed by the actions of the Worst Generation of pirates (Luffy's in special).
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    
    -   The first series has a one-episode character, Giselle. She's quite popular with boys despite her bitchy attitude, and even has the honor of being the first and possibly only female to actually attract Ash's attention.
    
    "It's sad that others aren't blessed with my beauty"
    
    -   In the Japanese version, Misty acts this way. She considers herself to be very beautiful and makes it known several times, to the point she enjoys the adoring audience gazing at her swimsuit during a Beauty Contest (something the English dub noticeably changed). When she reappeared in Alola, she mentions it as a Call-Back in her introduction.
-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_: Nino is a downplayed example, as she doesn't exactly exploit her looks despite being aware of them. In a twist, she actually uses this to snap Miku out of her self-pity state, telling her that as identical quintuplets, if one of them is cute, all of them are.
-   _Ranma ½_: While not as popular as her sister, Akane, Nabiki Tendo is regarded as attractive by her classmates and has her fair share of would-be suitors. She's perfectly aware of this and tends to use her sex appeal to fleece them for all they're worth before dumping them... assuming she doesn't become bored with toying with them first.
    -   Apparently Ranma takes pride in his strength, skills and basically being a man, while in female form he takes pride in his beauty. When Tsubasa (Ukyo's stalker) calling Ranma's female form "ugly", Ranma retorts by noting that Ukyo's the one who loves him, so he must be less ugly than Tsubasa.
-   _Red Baron_: Dr. Marilyn considers her beauty to be her most important quality, and she knows how to exploit it to get what she wants.
-   Satsuki from _Strawberry 100%_ is very proud about to be a sexy teenager, especially when she is compared to adult woman as the prof Kurokawa.
-   Maaya from _Umisho_ loves bragging about her modeling career and frequently uses her good looks to get boys to do favors for her.
-   _Yo-kai Watch Jam - Yo-kai Academy Y: Close Encounters of the N Kind_: Ryusuke is attractive and he knows it, constantly bragging about it.

    Arts 

-   _Portrait of Madame X_: Madame X is portrayed as a confident, sexually active woman in a flattering dress, the kind of person Gautreau was only rumored to be. Her pose is one that proudly displays her beauty.

    Comic Books 

-   _Archie Comics_: Veronica Lodge.
-   _The Mighty Thor_: It's hard to imagine a character being more proud of her spectacular beauty (or more fond of using it to her advantage) than Amora the Enchantress. A large portion of her magical arsenal is dedicated to charms and mind control, but in most cases, the exquisite perfection of her face, her hair, and her body is enough to get her anything she wants — though there's probably some sort of para-magical goddess effect operating in the background, to give it some extra oomph.
-   _Spider-Man_: Gwen Stacy actually started out this way, as she got angry at Peter Parker for daring not to be attracted to her, and reflected that "I've never met a boy like him! He didn't even give me a glance!" Fortunately, she got better. Mary Jane Watson and Black Cat play this role more straight due to the former being a Fanservice Model and the latter being a Sexy Cat Person/Classy Cat-Burglar with a form-fitting Spy Catsuit.
-   _W.I.T.C.H._: Cornelia Hale sometimes acts like this, usually after Irma's latest attempt to get her jealous of her large breasts.

    Comic Strips 

-   Jen from _Liberty Meadows_ likes using her good looks to flirt and tease Frank. At one point she decides to make a website, which becomes very popular, where people can watch her work through her web cam.
-   Fourteen-year-old Jeri Keene from _PreTeena_ fancies herself as one of these and sets the boyfriend bar correspondingly high. She never loses an opportunity to flaunt, especially to her younger sister Teena and Teena's plain gawky friend Stick.

    Fairy Tales 

    Fan Works 

Crossovers

-   In the Buffy/Thor crossover _An Average Everyday Supergoddess_, Harmony gains the powers and legendary beauty of the Asgardian Enchantress. Coming to grips with new memories and magical abilities is extremely difficult, but the girl has NO complaints with the appearance upgrade and gleefully flaunts her supernatural beauty whenever possible.
-   Buffy in _Heroes and Villains_ is largely _made_ of this. With her pre-Sunnydale personality firmly in place, she is shamelessly vain and manipulative, and absolutely delights in the effect her beauty has on those around her (especially Faith).

_Dragon Age_

-   Dorian, much as in canon, is this in _Skyhold Academy Yearbook_. In largest part, however, his pride in his attractiveness is Played for Laughs, and he's still an incredibly Nice Guy.

_Total Drama_

-   Emilia from _Total Drama Legacy_. She's drop-dead gorgeous, and she's _well aware_ of that- heck, she usually responds to compliments with "I know."

    Films — Animation 

-   _Beauty and the Beast_: Gaston is handsome, the most desired man in his town, and a narcissist. The only reason he wants to marry the female protagonist, Belle, is because she's considered the most beautiful girl in town and that makes her worthy to be his bride.
-   _Oliver & Company_ has Georgette, the pampered show dog of a rich household. She has an entire number devoted to how her perfection makes her irresistible and she knows it.
-   _The Jungle Book (1967)_ and _The Jungle Book 2_ has Shanti, the beautiful, cute, sweet, and intelligent village girl. She is revealed and sometimes implied to be this, both in general and especially around Mowgli, both the original movie and the sequel (being the Fille Fatale, Good Bad Girl, and Ms. Fanservice).

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _American Beauty_: Angela Hayes (played by Mena Suvari) expresses confusion that "he \[Ricky Fitts\] didn’t even look at her, like, once."
-   _Art of the Dead_: When Alpha Bitch Tiffany is mocking Donna for throwing herself at her boyfriend and being rejected, she does so by highlighting that she's more attractive than Donna, untying her shawl and groping her large breasts, saying nobody would want Donna if they could have her.
-   _The Devil's Brother_: In a Laurel and Hardy movie, believe it or not. In one scene, Zerlina the beautiful servant girl, changing for bed, looks in a mirror. She observes herself in a bra, frilly panties, and stockings, and sings a little song about how she's proud about having a great body. {"There's no cause for sighing/when one boasts such a figure as this.") This is plot relevant as Stan sings it later, so Zerlina realizes that he was in her room the night of the robbery.
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: In the cinematic series finale, the _Madison Express's_ new lonely hearts columnist walks this way whenever she goes through the newsroom.
-   _Thor: Ragnarok_: As a charismatic schemer, Loki is preoccupied with looking as elegantly handsome as possible, always adorning himself with intricately-designed apparel. He even has a masculine Supermodel Strut to flaunt his body. He's _extremely_ vain, and Thor knows it. Near the beginning of the movie, Thor suspects that Loki is disguised as Odin, and attempts to rile his brother by asserting that Loki's statue is better looking than Loki himself because it's "less weaselly, less greasy." It takes a fair amount of effort for Loki not to break character in order to respond to the affront to his pride. Later, on Midgard, Loki takes offense when Thor likens his all-black, dapper suit to that of a witch.
-   _X-Men Film Series_
    -   _X-Men: First Class_: Dr. Charles Xavier is a scientist who unabashedly exploits his gorgeousness (along with his charm) to proposition coeds at Oxford. Charles is so fond of his hair that he _immediately_ dismisses Hank's suggestion that he shave it off before he tests Cerebro. It's costume designer Sammy Sheldon's intention to make the character as stylish as possible within a conservative academic setting.
    -   _X-Men: Apocalypse_: Professor X is a Hot Teacher who doesn't seem to be concerned in the slightest that his translucent white shirt would be deemed inappropriate in any other school with teenagers and children. His sunglasses are the most flashy of the film because of their gradient lenses, and they enhance his sex appeal while also giving him the air of a fashion model. Xavier runs his hand through his luscious locks (which is his equivalent of a peacock's tail) to tame some wayward strands before he meets Moira to ensure that he's at his most attractive. Even after he goes bald, he conjures a mental projection of himself which still proudly has a feathered mullet on its head when he faces a life-and-death struggle with Apocalypse. It's The End of the World as We Know It if the Professor fails, but even if he's doomed, he'll at least look fabulous on the astral plane (heck, he still manages to be pretty even when he's soaked in his own blood). Make no mistake, folks; Charles is _vain_.

    Literature 

-   Iason Mink, the top ruling Blondie in _Ai no Kusabi_, is very well aware of his uncanny beauty and uses it get the advantage over his Pet, Riki.
-   Jane Austen:
    -   _Mansfield Park_:
        -   The Bertram sisters Maria and Julia are well aware of their attractiveness. They're beautiful and from a baronet's family, and plan to marry well because of it.
            
            _"The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the neighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements a manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to civility and obligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration. Their vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it, and gave themselves no airs."_
            
        -   Lady Bertram is beautiful and proud of it, and she values beauty greatly. She thinks every beautiful woman should use it to her advantage, ideally by making a good match and marrying a rich guy. (She also thinks that average-looking and plain women have no right to marry well and lead a comfortable life.)
            
            _"She had been a beauty, and a prosperous beauty all her life; and beauty and wealth, and fame were all that excited her respect."_
            
        -   Miss Crawford is a stunning, very spirited lady with beauty of the dark variety, with sparkling brown eyes and darkish complexion. She's very well aware of her charms. She is also very rich and is generally very satisfied with her lot in life. She wants to marry the heir to a nice property so her charming life can continue.
    -   _Persuasion_:
        
        -   Miss Elliot, the heroine's eldest sister, is very handsome and extremely vain about it. She is also proud to be a baronet's daughter. When the novel begins, Elizabeth is in her late twenties and starts to get conscious about her age. She is still gorgeous as ever, but she would really like a marriage proposal, from a baronet if possible.
        -   Sir Walter Elliot is a rare male example. He is extremely proud of his good looks that (he thinks) do not fade. He's equally proud that he's a baronet.
        
        _"Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character; vanity of person and of situation. He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man. Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society. He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion."_
        

-   Aphrodite in _The Camp Half-Blood Series_ makes no attempt to hide or downplay her beauty, which can get on her daughter Piper's nerves.
-   Tabitha, the Villain Protagonist of the _Delicate Fire_ series, lives this trope virtually every waking moment. Granted, her beauty is the key to her magical powers, so there's a bit more there than simple vanity. Lady Asuna from the same series also fits this perfectly, but with strong shades of Rich Bitch thrown in for good measure.
-   Alison Sedge in Robin Jarvis' _Deptford Mice_ trilogy becomes extremely vain after she receives her mousebrass, the Sign of Grace and Beauty.
-   In _The Familiar of Zero_, only a few male characters are unaffected by Kirche's good looks. She knows this and loves to flaunt and use her beauty to get what she wants.
-   Fleur Delacour in _Harry Potter_, who is well aware of how her looks and Veela-blood affect the people around her. Heartwarmingly subverted in _Half-Blood Prince_ when her fiancé Bill has his face half torn off by Fenrir Greyback. Molly refers to their engagement in the past tense, obviously assuming that the proud Fleur will no longer want Bill now that he is scarred for life. Fleur objects immediately.
    
    **Fleur:** I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave!
    
-   _Rebuild World_: There are multiple women like this, it’s almost like a theme.
    -   Alpha, Akira’s Virtual Sidekick he can only see as an Augmented Reality avatar that she precisely calculated to be as attractive as possible. Alpha is an Attention Whore and also The Tease and The Gadfly trying to get reactions out of Akira. Alpha’s excuses for being a Shameless Fanservice Girl are to see if anyone else can detect her because she’s Invisible to Normals, and to serve as anti Honey Trap training. The former proves an excuse after she modulates her avatar to only be visible to Akira.
    -   Downplayed with Elena and Sara who are attractive hunters who like to tease boys like Akira and Katsuya. Sara especially likes to flaunt her Cyborg enhanced chest.
    -   Sheryl is a young Dude Magnet who’s gotten by in the slums by appealing to powerful men. She’s shocked by Akira’s cold reaction to offering her body out of desperation for help (but he helps anyway). Sheryl is particularly confident in her smile which seems to be able to make boys fall in love with her. Akira’s reaction to it is Trauma Button panic that he might fall into a Honey Trap (which Sheryl is a proven expert in).
    -   Carol is a Predatory Prostitute who gets men addicted to her before doubling her rates until they’re driven into ruin or offering information as Pro Bono Barter. Her first appearance is undressing to try to seduce Akira, and she’s offended how he can ignore her constant seduction attempts. She spent a lot of money on plastic surgery alongside her Cyborg enhancements.
-   Queen Cersei Lannister in _A Song of Ice and Fire_ greatly values her beauty and is glad she is considered the most beautiful woman in Westeros. She is a bit worried though, because of a prophecy that says her power is going to be destroyed by a future queen who is going to be even more beautiful.
-   _Tomcat Blue Eyes' Diaries_: Like most cats, Blue Eyes is well aware of the fact that he's really adorable and really good-looking. When White Whiskers scolds him for getting stuck in a fence, he asks him whether he knows what the purpose of cat's whiskers is. Blue Eyes answers: "To look beautiful of course!"
-   Gilgamesh in _Fate/strange Fake_ is so self-assured about his physical appearance that he just assumes anyone staring dumbly at him must be Distracted by the Sexy.
    
    "What is it? Have you finally noticed that the greatest pleasure in this world is to look upon my glory? Very well, I permit you. Stare at me to your heart’s content, and pass on the tale to your offspring until the stars perish".
    
-   Laplace, the titular "mythical sorceress" in _Sexiled: My Sexist Party Leader Kicked Me Out So I Teamed Up With A Mythical Sorceress!_ is quite proud of her beauty and is not shy about letting everyone know it. There's a reason that when she needs an alias to compete in a tournament, she decided to call herself the "Stone Cold Stunner".
-   _Sherlock Holmes_ had a variation with one aging Femme Fatale, who receives them in a dimly-lit room.
    
    The lady had come, I felt, to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the half-light more welcome.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   Although Sarah on _Chuck_ is a strikingly beautiful woman, the show's resident Ms. Fanservice, and has used her looks to advantage on missions, it's her DEA friend Carina who _really_ lives and breathes this trope. She's even able to stop _Casey_, of all people, in his tracks by stripping down to her bra and panties when he tries to arrest her after she double-crosses the team on a mission. When Morgan later grows a spine and tells her off for using this trope to abuse and take advantage of him, she's legitimately shocked at his rejection because no one has _ever_ told her "no" before. Carina is _so_ surprised, in fact, she genuinely becomes interested and hops into bed with him when the mission is over.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Lady Cassandra, after living as a Brain in a Jar for ages, she gets a chance of possessing The Doctor's companion, Rose, in order to get revenge on her as well. Since she is an upper-class lady, she at first looks down on Rose as being too "brassy" for someone like her but after taking a good look, she can't deny how attractive she becomes once she takes over her body. So while still holding a grudge against Rose, she lets everyone know just how beautiful her new figure truly is either way.
    -   Played completely straight in the same episode also by Cassandra, when she briefly takes over The Doctor's body. Cassandra _thoroughly_ enjoys the experience - which is understandable since this iteration of The Doctor is played by David Tennant. The scene is completed by Tenent absolutely nailing the gesture of a woman putting on a slinky cocktail dress. The Doctor himself generally subverts this trope, being instead the Oblivious Beauty.
    -   Also in _Doctor Who_is Rose's mom. She is genuinely good looking for her years, but she's almost absurdly proud of it, to the extent that she forgets about her actual accomplishments (raising a wonderful daughter, helping save the Doctor's butt from the Daleks with nothing except a pickup truck, etc.).
-   Lady Mary Crawley of _Downton Abbey_ is stunningly beautiful and aware of it, uses it to her advantage gaining admirers and making her sister feel bad, and as the eldest daughter of an earl, she is extremely snobbish and haughty.
-   _Ginny and Georgia_: Georgia is quite aware of her good looks, showing them off with outfits which show her cleavage and legs often, plus always making herself up before going out.
-   Blanche in _The Golden Girls_ often talks about being attractive and definitely knows how it could affect men. Which it does.
-   In _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_, Aphrodite is very proud of her beauty and has no problem showing it. Of course, she _is_ the goddess of love and beauty.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: In "...After the Phantoms of Your Former Self", Lestat de Lioncourt brags about his "astonishing jawline" during the car ride with his boyfriend Louis de Pointe du Lac.
-   _Once Upon a Time_ has a male example in Captain Hook, who repeatedly makes reference to the fact that he is "devilishly handsome". He also frequently refers to himself or his actions as "dashing".
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: Women like this appear once in a while, and are always at least a nuisance to Miss Brooks or teenager Harriet Conklin:
    -   In "The Model Teacher", an obnoxious but attractive reporter competes with Miss Brooks for Mr. Boynton's affections.
    -   "New Girl" sees the titular new girl go after Harriet's boyfriend Walter Denton. The girl's mother has eyes for Mr. Boynton.
    -   "The Dancer" sees a burlesque dancer audition for a job at a bachelor party being arranged by Mr. Conklin. The usually shy Mr. Boynton is very interested in seeing her do her work.
    -   In the cinematic series finale, the _Madison Express's_ new lonely hearts columnist walks this way whenever she goes through the newsroom. But fortunately, this proud beauty stays out of the way.
-   On _Seinfeld_, Jerry dates a woman who is part vain beauty, part Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful!, and he takes full advantage of it. She is eventually stolen away from him by Elaine's "dating loophole" guy.
-   _She's Gotta Have It_: Greer is a Rare Male Example, as he often speaks of his own good looks with pride and boasts of how many women like him.
-   _Star Trek: Picard_: It's hinted in "Broken Pieces" that Mister Hospitality (the Emergency Hospitality Hologram on _La Sirena_) is vain because he views himself as a "better-groomed" version of Rios, and he runs his hand through his hair a couple of times to illustrate this.
-   _Utopia Falls_: Brooklyn clearly knows just how attractive she is, tossing back her hair back and sticking her chest out while boldly strutting into rooms. This turns Sage's head, and Brooklyn realizes she's interested as a result.

    Music 

-   Right Said Fred's "I'm Too Sexy" is a comical take on the trope, as it's so over the top. "I'm too sexy for my shirt, so sexy it _hurts_."
-   The protagonist of LMFAO's song "Sexy and I Know It" (Unreliable Narrator notwithstanding).
    
    When I walk on by, girls be looking like "damn he fly"
    
-   The girl in "Fit But You Know It" by _The Streets_, the Mc version (which has different lyrics) makes her a straight up Alpha Bitch.
-   Bea Miller's "S.L.U.T." with the message that being proud of your appearance is nothing to be shamed for.
    
    ''I love myself, I wanna see it  
    When I turn around, look in the mirror  
    And if you don't like it, you can leave it  
    'Cause it's my own and I'll keep owning it
    
-   Similarly Meghan Trainor's "Made You Look" is all about embracing your natural beauty and owning it.
-   The guy trying woo Shania Twain in "That Don't Impress Me Much," along with being an Insufferable Genius and obsessed with his car.
    
    _I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket  
    And a comb up his sleeve-just in case  
    And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it  
    'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place  
    Oh, oh, so you think you're something special  
    Oh, oh, you think you're something else  
    Okay, so you're Brad Pitt  
    That don't impress me much_
    

    Myths & Religion 

-   Greek Mythology:
    -   Every incarnation of Aphrodite has this trait. Justified since she is the goddess of love and beauty. Merely suggesting she might not be considered the most beautiful being ever is also her Berserk Button. In the tale of Eros and Psyche, she becomes jealous of Psyche (whose beauty is praised above hers) and sends her son Eros to use his arrows to cause Psyche to fall in love with the most hideous thing in the world. Of course, this fails because as soon as Eros sees Psyche, he falls in love with her too.
    -   In the Apple of Discord tale, goddesses Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite have an argument (turned into a competition) to see who is the fairest. The three demanded Zeus choose who is the "fairest", but he wisely declines. Instead, he chooses a mortal man to arbitrate. Each goddess presents their beauty to him while also offering a prize should he choose them. Eventually he chooses Aphrodite as the winner and accepts her promise of the most beautiful woman in Greece. The man? Paris of Troy. The woman? Helen of Sparta. Thus begins The Trojan War.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   At wrestling shows, Mildred Burke was all business, straight to the point, pin her opponent, show off her title belt and leave. Away from wrestling shows though Burke regularly participated in glamour shoots wearing little clothing and sold pinups of herself where she seemed to be overjoyed to be showing off her curves(and biceps).
-   The Midnight Express, specifically Randy Rose and Dennis Condrey, _especially_ their successors "Sweet" Stan Lane and "Beautiful" Bobby Eaton, who were notorious for doing nothing but stand around and pose for the camera while their manager Jim Cornette mouthed off. Whether or not anyone else thought so they couldn't be told any different and if you were claiming Beautiful Bobby wasn't those may just be fighting words. It applied further still to The Heavenly Bodies Jimmy Del Rey and Doctor Tom Pritchard, especially after Stan Lane joined in Smoky Mountain Wrestling.
-   Jacqueline Miss Tennessee/Miss Texas gimmick was initially about believing she was so pretty she could win a pageant and dressing like it when not wrestling. This mostly disappeared, as she became more of a proud fighter, proud drinker, proud party maker or just proud in general, but only disappeared entirely in WCW while beating people up for Kevin Sullivan. Otherwise she knew she had a giant rack, and while rarely reveling in the fact at one point did say "sex sells".
-   "The Pretty Boy Pitbull" Kenny King feels no shame in the fact his other job involves him showing off his naked body for the pleasure of women with the Chippendale dance troupe. After being busted open during a match with Eric Young in TNA, King looked to the camera and boasted that he was "still pretty".
-   The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew were both this in different ways. "The Lovely Lacey" viewed herself as the perfect athletic specimen perfectly proportioned in all areas while Radiant Rain boasted a naturally large breasts despite the most rigorous exercise and diet routines. Being scared in a car accident didn't diminish Rain's pride either, she just directed people to spend more time looking at her butt.
-   Three out of four Team Blondage members, especially the TNA cage danger Lollipop and the model Krissy Vaine. GeeStar was the odd woman out, being a Boisterous Bruiser eager to prove she was One of the Boys, but even the Jerk Jock motocross racing Amber O'Neal insisted that she was sexier than anyone named Lollipop or Vaine, who were merely her "equals".
-   Gail Kim initially hid her face under a mask, only got breast implants to get a job on television and was mortified when John Laurinaitis booked her in a series of bra and panties matches against Dawn Marie. However, after she posed nude for a Korean cellphone company Kim came to embrace her beauty and began to demand special treatment from wrestling companies because of her good looks.
-   The Fabulous Firebird Phoenix was always proud of her height and musculature, believing that she was what a real wrestler should look like, but she was out to rid wrestling of "plastic excuses for women" and prone to uneasiness around taller or more muscular women wrestlers, rare as they were. That changed in 2006 when she got breast implants and began calling herself "The Glamazon", a "perfect combination of strength and beauty". From then on nothing could shake her pride in her physical appearance and belief in its superiority, although she was rattled when Melina Perez said Phoenix still didn't know how to be "glamorous".
-   ODB is a trashy trailer chick who lifts a lot of weights, but after getting breast implants she became convinced pretty much every man she saw was into her, and prior to marrying Eric Young she was always ready to sleep with any man who did what she requested of him.
-   No matter her amount skin exposure, the quality of her clothing, how much she is bleeding, her amount of bruises, any fat she may have, how muscular she may get, how skinny she may get, how she paints her face, the way she styles her hair, the kind of mask she wears Athena knows you think she's sexy and wants you to just admit it already.
-   The Beautiful People of TNA, as if the name wasn't enough, took every opportunity to inform the audience that everyone else was uglier, and thus inferior to them...however, during the in fighting in which Angelina Love and Velvet Sky tormented Madison Rayne, they admitted to finding Rayne's fan girl Brittany "pretty".
-   At wrestling shows The Twisted Sisters Holidead and Thunder Rosa paint their faces with skull or patchwork patterns and concern themselves with viciously savaging their opponents, and occasionally fight over something like Rosa not taking things seriously enough, but their beauty is of no one's concern, least of all their own. Away from wrestling events though the two can't get enough of doing themselves up and showing off their bodies, with Thunder Rosa once lamenting a cold snap in Texas prevented her from wearing booty shorts and in other instance filming herself running out in the snow in nothing but underwear anyway. It's not surprising when one learns Rosa rigorously studied Mildred Burke.
-   Mila Naniki was this way about her whole body, once calling the entire PGWA roster too ugly to wrestle her, but was especially proud of her backside.

    Theatre

-   Katherine Howard is portrayed this way in _Six_, being very aware of her beauty and the male attention it attracts.
    
    _I think we can all agree — I'm the ten amongst these threes._
    

    Video Games 

-   Morrigan from _Darkstalkers_, a beauty naughty succubus with suggestive movements and really proud.
    -   Played up extensively in _Pocket Fighter_. There, Morrigan's goal is to prove to the world that she's the strongest and most beautiful woman out there, so she challenges Chun-Li, the current title-holder for both claims, in a battle of female supremacy. In the end, Morrigan is victorious but ultimately loses out to none other than Lilith, who unwittingly attracts the guys away from her sister.
-   Dorian Pavus is the Agent Peacock of _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, and is very well aware of just how handsome he is; at one point in party banter, he mentions that his visage should be preserved in marble. One of his cries in battle is even "I'm too pretty to die!" Unlike most examples, however, he's really a sweetheart and is one of the least morally compromised companions in the series.
-   Zhenji from _Dynasty Warriors_ is known for being exceptionally beautiful and loves being complimented on her beauty.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, this is a trait of Meridia, a Daedric Prince whose sphere is obscured to mortals, but is associated with Life Energy, Light, and Beauty. Meridia embodies light and life, and so takes an appearance that mortals would perceive as a beautiful woman. She is well aware of this fact and takes pride in the fact that mortals find everything about her, even her visible form, pleasant and appealing.

-   Carmine from _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_ is quite proud of her looks. She expects the player character to be stunned when they see her in her festival outfit, and she compares Fezendipity's beauty to her own at one point. Fittingly, one of the other students on the field trip is implied to get a crush on her, as he's jealous of the player hogging all of Carmine's time.
-   While Rise from _Persona 4_ doesn't tend to brag about her looks, she's _easily_ the most sexually-confident out of the female members of the Investigation team: she has no problem wearing a swimsuit for the pageant while Chie and Yukiko are extremely embarrassed and Naoto outright runs away, and shrugs when Teddie offers to reveal the girls' measurements, noting hers have been public knowledge for a while. She's also shocked and slightly affronted to learn that Naoto has a bigger bust than her, and is outright offended when she realizes that Kanji has absolutely no interest in her.
-   Although asexual, Valentine from _Skullgirls_ takes great pride in her appearance — she even uses her measurements as an override code.
-   Rouge the Bat from _Sonic The Hedgehog_ can be very vain about her looks.
-   Giorgio, in _Story of Seasons (2014)_, is this trope Played for Laughs.

Really, he's moderately obsessed with beauty in general, not just his own. Despite this, however, he's a genuinely Nice Guy.

-   Zen from _Mystic Messenger_ is an extremely handsome actor who constantly brags about his good looks, to the frequent exasperation of his friends. However, he turns out to be a borderline deconstruction of this trope: he actually thought he was ugly when he was young because his parents believed he would become too fixated or reliant on his looks to become successful and even after he learns to take pride in his looks, he works himself to the bone at his acting job to prove that he didn't become famous on looks alone.

    Web Animation 

-   Tifa Lockhart in _Final Fantasy VII: Machinabridged_ is very aware of how beautiful she is and flaunts it. She wears short-shorts because she believes she has legs the world NEEDS to see and considers her bust "a goddamn national treasure".

However, Hayley soon retaliates and they end up in a Cat Fight. It turned out that Roger had manipulated them to make a video and send it in to a website that exchanges mother-daughter catfights for free T-shirts.
-   _As Told by Ginger_: Courtney is very pretty, and fully aware and proud of it.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_: Poison Ivy is perfectly aware of what a smokin' hot redheaded bombshell she is and is in no way shy about flaunting it, with supermodel like poses, a silky sway of her hips, and Double Entendres smoothly delivered with that sensual, breathy voice galore. You definitely get a sense Ivy enjoys the power her sex appeal has over men. Being charmed by her though is costly, _especially_ if she's in the mood for kissing. Harvey Dent learned this firsthand.
-   In _Class of the Titans_, Neil is a descendant of Narcissus who works as a freelance model. He says stuff like So Beautiful, It's a Curse occasionally, but he's just kidding. He loves it.
-   In _Codename: Kids Next Door_, Henrietta Von Marzipan is so proud of her beauty that it's the quality she values most about herself. When she lost it due to a curse (that also switched her gender), she was devastated to the point of pulling a Face–Heel Turn until she found a way to change back.

-   Daring Charming from _Ever After High_ is the son of Prince Charming, and has inherited his charm, looks and poise... and is very, very aware of this. He's far from a bad guy, but even so, his mirror checks can last for hours and he's all too eager to point out his many virtues at length.

After being invited to join the Quahog Beautiful People's Club and learning the perks of being beautiful, he becomes narcissistic. At one point, he goes so far as to paste a picture of his face over his wife's face in their wedding photo because he thought it would look better that way.
-   A mild example, but Mabel from _Gravity Falls_ does seem to be aware of and prize her beauty. In "Gideon Rises", she refers to herself as beautiful, and in "Dreamscaperers", when Bill Cipher turns her into an ugly, green monster while she's inside Stan's mind, she flips out and exclaims, "My cuteness! What did you do to my cuteness?".
-   Rarity in _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_. She is confident enough to persuade stallions to help her with various things through her beauty and charm. However, she _usually_ avoids taking it to the point where it becomes a problem, and as the pilot episode shows, she is willing to sacrifice her hair or clothes without complaint if need be.
