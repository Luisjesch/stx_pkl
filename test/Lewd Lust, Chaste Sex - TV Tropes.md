_Eroticism is such that the kiss we only imagine giving can be as powerful and exciting as hours of actual lovemaking._

Sometimes, the most explicit acts get the least explicit scenes. It can seem very strange when a French kiss, a make-out session, or other act of non-coitus is depicted far more sexily than actual sex.

The effect is natural enough. There are any number of reasons not to depict a sex scene, and far fewer to shy away from a merely erotic one. Sex may not fit the rating; it may not fit the tone; it may be intended as an act of loving union, and the slimy bits would distract; the author may know their own skill level better than to tackle description of this kind; there simply might not be a way around the fact that sex is ridiculous for everyone but the people involved. By contrast, tamer acts offend fewer delicate sensibilities, are less likely to overwhelm the plot, and can wind down naturally at levels where cutting away from a sex act would be both awkwardly explicit and frustratingly vague. The careful writer plans for the contrast and makes it meaningful.

    Anime & Manga 

-   A weird example coming from a series like _Berserk_. All sorts of graphic sex scenes — consensual or not — and various performances are depicted in the series, the Official Couple not excluded. While Guts and Casca are _clearly_ seen having vaginal intercourse (in four different positions, no less), there is little to no detail of Guts performing cunnilingus on Casca aside from Guts spreading her legs apart and telling her to get ready and Casca looking down and then shuddering and moaning in pleasure. So it's really more of a chaste lust, lewd(ish) sex scene.
-   The bonus epilogue chapter of _Domestic Girlfriend_, "Memories with Rui/Days with Hina", is an example of this. While both Rui and Hina are major love interests for protagonist Natsuo, "Memories with Rui" is depicted as pure carnal desire and is the most sexually explicit of the two stories; meanwhile, "Days with Hina" only features one implied sex scene, happening after establishing a First-Name Basis and declaring their love for one another.

    Film 

-   _The Hole_ has this in spades. Thora Birch and her romantic interest have a standing make-out-and-grope session, while the camera keeps them dead centre. Later, when the love interest takes her virginity, it's offscreen, and all we hear are her not-too-sexy grunting noises.
-   In _Picasso Trigger_, both Hope Marie Carlton and Bruce Penhall are both naked in a jacuzzi and when they kiss, the camera cuts away.
-   In _Plan B_, Bruno and Pablo get many UST\-laden scenes of them undressing and sleeping in the same bed with just their underwear on, but their attempt at having sex together is incredibly awkward and only goes as far as them removing their shirts before they break down into nervous laughter and call it off. When they're finally fully ready to have sex at the end of the film, we only see them pulling each other into the bedroom before the credits start rolling.
    -   Marco Berger's later films after _Plan B_ fit this trope even better. _Hawaii_ and _Taekwondo_ are both teeming with handsome men who spend at least 90% of their screen time without a shirt on, get multiple Male Frontal Nudity scenes and Unresolved Sexual Tension with each other so thick it could be cut with a knife... but the most action these men get with each other are a kiss at the very end of their respective films.
-   In _Three Colors: White_, a failed attempt at sex is shown in all its glory to establish the desperation of the participants and of their relationship. Success much later on fades to white.

    Fan Fiction 

    Literature 

-   In an Older Than Feudalism example, _The Song of Songs_ describes the anticipation and meetings between two lovers in rather racy detail, but the part about the actual intimacy is absent.
-   In _A Brother's Price_, all the sex scenes are like this. While it is only touching with clothes in between, we get full details, but once the clothes come off, it's only hinted at what they actually do. The scenes where we actually are told what goes where, with no cut, are the ones that aren't meant to be erotic.

-   _The Hunger Games_: Katniss and Peeta share a make-out session that describes the kissing and the way it makes her feel in great detail. When they eventually have sex it's given so little detail that there's room to argue they didn't even have sex at all.
-   The _Last Herald-Mage Trilogy_ stars Herald-Mage Vanyel, one of the first gay male protagonists in fantasy. While his love life — both good and bad — does factor into the plot, there are no explicit sex scenes, just the lead up, perhaps a bit of text from a third party's perspective to tell you what's going on, and straight to the post-coital bliss or trauma.
-   A hot'n'heavy scene in Cory Doctorow's _Little Brother_ has a lot of sucking and moaning and lowering and brushing, and that's about when the tear gas comes down. When the couple has actual sex, the description cuts away.
-   Shows up from time to time in the _Nightrunner_ series. The kisses are described in great detail, from the physical to the emotional ramifications. But by the time the two leads actually become a real couple, the descriptions largely gloss over any specifics.
-   Orson Scott Card's "The Originist": When Deet and Leyel have sex on the living room floor, it's only two sentences. However, their post-coital nuzzling is given multiple paragraphs of description.
-   In _Sunshine_, two characters at one point have very pleasant sex outside in the sunshine...and that's all we're told about that. When two characters stop at foreplay, the reader is given all the details up to and including how unhappy the viewpoint character is at stopping halfway through.
-   _The Twilight Saga_ goes into detail about Edward and Bella making out, but the various sex scenes in Breaking Dawn were faded to black.

    Video Games 

-   _Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards_. After a game's worth of dirty jokes and innuendo in the quest to get Larry laid, impending success causes the game to switch to a black screen for fireworks and a developer's congratulation.
