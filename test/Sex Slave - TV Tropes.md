Simply put, this is a character who has been Made a Slave for the sexual desires of others. This happens especially often in Dystopia, The Empire, and the darker versions of Fetish-Fuel Future, either to show how much the world sucks, or, well, just because. In the former kind, the Sex Slave is rarely a protagonist. At best, she's a Damsel in Distress for the hero to rescue. At worst she only exists as a narrative tool to show the audience that this is indeed a No Woman's Land. In the Romanticized Abuse kind, however, she (or he) is usually the protagonist. In that case, expect Property of Love and Freedom from Choice to come along with Happiness in Slavery.

The contrast between some of the more risque aspects of this trope and the Crapsack World environment it usually occurs in can often create Unfortunate Implications. In some works, the slavery can develop into a mutual relationship. Expect Bathe Her and Bring Her to Me, Go-Go Enslavement, and/or a Slave Collar. Compare Slavery Is a Special Kind of Evil.

Unfortunately, this is Truth in Television, although generally quite different from the fetishised fantasy. Forced prostitution in general amounts to this. Human Trafficking in particular is one of the biggest ways that people are enslaved like this.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Much of the plot of _Ai no Kusabi_ revolves around how Riki was forcibly Made A Sex Slave as a "Pet" and the effect it has on him, his master, and his ex-lover.
-   This is what actually happened to Shiro Masuda aka Amakusa in _Amakusa 1637_. More exactly, Shiro is captured and given as a slave to Naozumi, an already emotionally unstable Time Traveler, who made him his forced lover due to Shirou being identical to Natsuki, Naozumi's Unrequited Love. According to Naozumi's own testimony, Shirou first attempted to understand his "lord"'s broken psyche via speaking to him politely and gently, then tried to use this to try helping his fellow Christians... but when Naozumi realized that he was starting to fall for Shirou, he strangled the poor kid to death, and then threw his lifeless body into the sea.
-   In _Berserk_, this happened to both Guts and Casca in their childhoods. Guts was sold by his adoptive father Gambino to the mercenary Donovan for one night for three silver coins, leading to his traumatic rape. Casca was sold by her parents to a noble who wanted a new serving girl, only for it to turn out that this was what he wanted her for. She was saved by Griffith before the bastard could rape her, but Griffith made her finish him off herself. Unfortunately, the very same Griffith would later rape her himself after getting hooked on The Dark Side.
-   _Black Butler II_: Episode 8 reveals that old man Trancy captured many young boys to choose sex slaves from, raped most of them, and Alois ended up being his favorite sex slave right up until either he died of old age, or Alois killed him. Also, the flashbacks in the manga to when Ciel is kept as a self-described 'pet' to the cult members has several panels that suggest this probably happened to him.
-   What Chaka wanted to do to Yukio in _Black Lagoon_, after stripping her of power within the Washimine clan. Ginji, Rock, and Revy stop him, though. And Ginji gives him a Cruel And Unusual Karmic Death.
-   _Blue Drop_: Tenchi no Bokura had school girls as sex slaves. To the teachers. The school _claimed_ to be teaching them the usual things, but the real purpose was to teach the all-female students to be sex slaves to their lesbian alien conquerors and be utterly alien to the concept of sex with men.
-   One of the many uses of the _DearS_. Takeya isn't happy when Ren offers to fulfill her function for him.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi_:
    -   In the manga version, the group enters a Lady Land, and the guys must dress like women to get through safely.
    -   One of the omakes in the OVA takes it to a more comedic level. A drag-queen Mitsukake apparently looks disgusting enough to have his face censored and make the rest of the cast Blue with Shock, and is still singled out to become the Sex Slave. Then Tamahome and Tasuki drop their disguises and willingly and gleefuly volunteer to become slaves themselves, much to Miaka's chargin.
    -   Also, Soi was sold to a brothel by her impoverished family when she was a little girl. At the age of 12, she is about to be punished by her pimp for refusing to have sex with a client, but is rescued by Nakago. (She is also "used" by him for her sexual healing powers, but does so willingly out of love, even knowing that the love is more or less one-sided.)
    -   The emperor of Kutou kept Nakago as a sex slave in the past. This is Nakago's Start of Darkness.
    -   This is implied to be what the slave traders truly want to do to Miaka and Yui in the beginning. Miaka tries to fight back, but is overpowered, and then Tamahome steps in.

-   _Almost_ happens to Kurumi Akino in _Haou Airen_. When she has a Heroic BSoD and tries to run away from Hakuron in the middle of Hong Kong, she's captured by some Triad members who intend to sell her as one; then, they strip and almost rape her. Hakuron finds them and shoots them to death, then takes Kurumi to safety.
-   In _Legend of the Blue Wolves_ Captain Continental has many sex slaves and tries to make Jonathan into one as well. Jonathan refuses so Captain Continental rapes him.
-   _Master of Martial Hearts_: The fate of those who lose the tournament is to be Mind Raped into mindlessness and then sold into sexual slavery. This drives the Cycle of Revenge in the series in general.
-   Underclassmen at Garderobe Academy in _My-Otome_ are given to the Onee-samas as "room attendants." One student states, when explaining the system, that the kohai _could_ be made to have sex for the Onee-sama, complete with Imagine Spot.

-   In the _Peacemaker Kurogane_ manga, the old merchant Yamatoya makes Suzu his sex slave after Suzu's master was killed and he was left all alone starving in the streets. Suzu wasn't the only one, however — two twin kitty boys were also picked up by him for this purpose.

-   In _Sensitive Pornograph_, Aki-chan is this to his abusive boyfriend. After being dumped, battered, and thrown out for having sex with the Unlucky Everydude who came in expecting a pet rabbit to look after, Aki-chan ends up in a new relationship with said Unlucky Everydude.
-   In _Shitsurakuen_, this is mostly Fridge Logic, since we don't see what the boys do to their girls in the off-hours. Ironically, the one unambiguous case is the _heroine's_ encounter with Reiko, as part of a Batman Gambit to save her.
-   Legato Bluesummers from the _Trigun_ manga was revealed to have been one in his past... until Knives happened upon the town Legato was in and massacred everyone. Legato managed to use his strings to stop Knives from killing him at the same time, and then said he was going to let him go, so he could kill him if he wanted, but please don't. Knives decided he was interesting, and asked his name, and the rest is history. This notably explains Legato's insane loyalty in the face of Knives' indifference and cruelty in really depressing terms: Knives isn't _good_ to him, but he's better than anyone else ever was.
-   Being reduced to this drove Mai Kamio insane to the point of a Face–Heel Turn in _Video Girl Ai_.

-   _Yuria 100 Shiki_: If Dutch Wife Yuria has sex with someone, and she automatically becomes programmed to become said person's sex slave.

    Comic Books 

-   _Empowered_:
    -   Ninjette was intended as one for her clan. Training her to be a badass Ninja first was probably a bad idea. Her clan's intended use for her isn't as a sex slave per se; the forced sex would have been "merely" a necessary prerequisite for her bearing lots of ninja babies.
    -   Emp herself was nearly taken as one, but the Robot sent to capture her decided her butt was too big. She was more devastated by the insult than her good fortune.
-   _The Incredible Hulk_: In _The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect_, the Maestro, an older and evil version of the Hulk from an alternate future, rules the world and keeps a harem of slave girls for this purpose.
-   Norman Osborn has human trafficking connections of this type. In one issue of _Dark Avengers_, he threatens Mystique by telling her he knows of an upper-class brothel in Dubai where the men would pay top dollar for sex with a Shapeshifter. (For those who he think he was bluffing, check out his own page.)
-   "The Slavers", an arc in _The Punisher_, has Frank Castle taking on a slave-trafficking ring. The horrible things that the slavers do to the people they've enslaved hits every one of Castle's Berserk Buttons concerning mistreatment of women and children in general, resulting in one of his most brutal killing sprees.
-   _Wonder Woman_: In the backstory Diana's mother Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, was once enslaved by the demi-god Heracles (sent by Ares in his war against Athena) along with her people for his sexual desires. Athena freed Hippolyta on the condition that she would not seek revenge, but Heracles escaped anyway.
-   In part 2 of _Druuna: Morbus Gravis_, Druuna and a young bald woman are "rescued" from the wastelands by the fascistic soldiers who police the ruined city. Druuna wakes up in the commander's bed, and after asking him what happened to the girl she was with, is shown evidence that the girl has been forced into sexual slavery. Meanwhile, Druuna herself is offered "protection" by the commander in exchange for sexual services – the alternative being death.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Chaos Is Very Good_, Discord threatens to do this to Luna.
-   The _Firefly_ fic _Freedom To The Free_ has Simon forced into this when he, Wash and Kaylee are enslaved. Simon is mentally scarred by it but lets the master use him because he’s protecting Kaylee from threats to rape her if he doesn’t comply.
-   _The Night Unfurls_:
    -   Vault and the Black Dogs aim to build a regime named the Sex Empire, where the women would "cook, clean and fuck" whenever they are told to. They plan on starting with Olga, Chloe and the dark elves after they take over the Black Fortress, moving on to the women in the south.
    -   It turns out that Vault and the Black Dogs are not the first group of people to think of this idea. When Lily was preparing to be ordained, she had heard tales of slavers picking the "choicest" women to sell people rich enough to purchase them. And since slavery was a crime often went unpunished in the country even before Vault's conquest...
    -   Implied for Grace, who became one of the slaver Morgan's "products" after being displaced from her homeland, later tossed aside when she had fulfilled her uses.
    -   Chapter 24 reveals that House Mandeville practises dark elf trafficking, particularly dark elf slaves waiting to be transported to the Grim Up North for Vault's taking, so sexual labour is obviously involved.
    -   Chloe, conceived via a human male raping a dark elf female. The father is later revealed to be John Mandeville, whose house was involved in the dark elf slave trade centuries ago, the reason why Chloe, her mother, and many other dark elves were taken as slaves to be entertainment. And then Mandeville manages to have Chloe in his grasp once more.
-   _Red Fire, Red Planet_: Meromi Riyal, first officer of the IKS _mupwI'_, was one of the 1,500 Orion slave girls given to the Great Houses of the Klingon Empire by the Orion Syndicate at the signing of the Treaty of Ter'jas Mor.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  She decided she'd had enough of Klingon sex and escaped into the Qo'noS underground where she joined a smuggling ring.
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: Malleus's slaves, who also doubled as Breeding Slaves, as said:
    
    To Malleus, the poor girls chained naked to the walls were nothing but objects of convenience, there to sate his lusts and produce offspring.
    

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Blue Velvet_: Dorothy Vallens is forced into this role after her child and husband are kidnapped by a local crime-boss Frank. Eventually, she develops a sort of Stockholm Syndrome and seems to take a twisted pleasure in Frank's rape at one point.
-   _Deadgirl_: The titular zombie girl is used as a sex slave after a pair of teens discover her chained in the basement of an abandoned mental hospital. The discovery that she is undead only provokes her captors into even further depravity.
-   In _Don Juan DeMarco_, the titular mental patient relates a yarn about spending a year in the 'service' of a lusty Sultana. Not that he seems to've minded much. It probably helped that she kept him hidden in the Sultan's harem (apparently she didn't mind sharing.)
-   In _Hitler's Madman_, super-evil Nazi Reinhard Heydrich has the prettiest girls of the village of Lidice lined up against a wall. He picks the ones he likes best and has them sent off to the Eastern Front to be sex slaves in German brothels.
-   This is the whole premise of the film _Human Trafficking_ - the trafficking happens only to get sex slaves.
-   _Macho Dancer_: Noel's fears are proven true: his sister, Pining, was trafficked and forced to work at a brothel in Manila. She services clients at all hours of the day and will be trapped for three years. Noel is able to free her but at the cost of his life.
-   _Mandalay_: Tanya is forced into this lifestyle when her jerkass lover sells her off for payment of guns. She becomes the infamous "Spot White", the main hostess of the "Jardin d'Orient" brothel. The film is a rare case where the sex slave is the main character _and_ not in a Romanticized Abuse kind of situation.
-   In _Manos: The Hands of Fate_, this is the sickening fate of the hero's wife _and_ his child.
-   Three or four unfortunate young blondes are locked in an attic as forced prostitutes in _The Sinful Dwarf_.
-   The "Furniture Girls" in _Soylent Green_. The one owned by the murder victim even becomes the love interest of Ty Thorn.
-   Similar to the Orion girls from _Star Trek_ are the Twi'lek girls from _Star Wars_. According to the Expanded Universe they actually encourage sexual slavery: since they have no spacecraft of their own, becoming sex slaves is their primary method of going offworld, with the plan of freeing themselves to get a real job at some point. However, they don't seem to be doing a very good job as it's been this way for thousands of years.
-   _The Street Fighter_: Because the guy who hired him didn't have enough money to pay him for the job he did for him, Terry sent the guy out the window and then sold the guy's sister into sexual slavery. It's quite the dick move on Terry's part, cementing him as a _very_ dark antihero, and when the sister gets out of this, she is very much pissed at Terry and goes after him for revenge.

-   In _Taken_, the Papa Wolf main character must pretty much race against the clock to make sure his kidnapped daughter won't be sold into sex slavery. He's too late to save the daughter's best friend, but _does_ manage to save his child.
-   In _The Ten Commandments (1956)_, Lilia is blackmailed into this position via Scarpia Ultimatum by Dathan, who promises not to have Joshua executed if she agrees to it _and_ tells anyone who asks that it's consensual. Despite the type of man Dathan has proven to be thus far, he keeps his end of the bargain.
-   In _¡Three Amigos!_, El Guapo kidnaps Carmen and it's made abundantly clear that it's for this purpose, going so far that as to have another woman "instruct" her on it. However, he rejects Jefe's suggestion of simply forcing himself on her and prefers to wait until she's willing...or he'll kill her. And, yes, this is all played for laughs.
-   In _When Taekwondo Strikes_, the members of the Bansan Karate School, a Thug Dojo that's a front for the Japanese Secret Service, kidnap Korean women for use as comfort women.

    Literature 

-   A.N. Roquelaure's _Beauty_ series features more of a sexual indentured servitude. Before they're permitted to take rulership, young nobility and royalty are sent into training as sexual slaves. It's also a means a social mobility, as commoners and lesser nobles may also submit themselves for the same treatment. Slaves may also beg to remain so for life.
-   Piers Anthony invokes this in _Bio of a Space Tyrant_, where the hero's older sister Faith gives herself up to pirates as a sex slave in order to save her fellow refugees from being destroyed. Even more dispiriting than it sounds, since the family had fled the planet to protect Faith from being raped in the first place.
-   In J.R. Ward's _Black Dagger Brotherhood_ series, we learn that Zsadist, kidnapped by his nanny as an infant, was sold into slavery and eventually used as a sex/blood slave by a sadistic mistress. Zsadist is eventually rescued by his twin brother, Phury, and kills his mistress but suffers intense psychological damage. He is considered souless by his fellow Brothers, and dangerous. His book in the series involves him falling in love with a woman and having to overcome (well, not completely) his past.
-   _Black Jewels_:
    -   Ttwo of the three main male good guys were pleasure slaves in Courts in Tereille. Aside from Daemon and Lucivar, there's also Jared (pre-Invisible Ring) and a small army of others.
    -   Jaenelle and the Briarwood girls also count, being kept in a secure facility, drugged, and used for sex on a regular basis.
-   The Red Temple in Fred Saberhagen's _Books of Swords_ series is known to use sex slaves among its prostitutes, and the Silver Queen sells her own daughter into slavery to the Red Temple for this purpose. Arian is rescued by Baron Doon and his party before she actually gets to the Red Temple or is raped, but things don't end well.
-   In Nora Keller's _Comfort Woman_, Akiko was forced to serve as a military "comfort woman," a sex slave provided to troops during the Japanese occupation of Korea in World War II. Her daughter Beccah does not know of this history, and as she learns of it, she comes to understand her mother's apparently strange ways.
-   Robert E. Howard's _Conan the Barbarian_ has rescued his share of slave girls in his day, such as Olivia from Shah Amurath in _Iron Shadows in the Moon_.
    -   In "Xuthal of the Dusk", Thalis tells Conan to kill Natala because unlike her, she is too soft to survive the sexual demands of the men in the city.
    -   And in _The People of the Black Circle_ Yasmina is forced to remember past lives of this:
        
        _She reeled naked and bleeding over burning sands, dragged at the slaver's stirrup, and she knew the grip of hot, fierce hands on her writhing flesh, the shame and agony of brutal lust._
        
    -   In _A Witch Shall Be Born_, one of the luxuries Salome is after is "handsome men and soft women for my paramours and my slaves."

-   In _The Count of Monte Cristo_, this is the Count's cover story for Haydee's presence. It also helps him to justify why a man of his standing isn't courting women.
-   _The Draka_: The Draka revel in this trope, with "bedwenches" and "prettybucks" (male serfs "for men so inclined"). At the same time, sex between female Draka and male serfs is forbidden, as are homosexual relations between male Draka. Instead female Draka get it on with other female Draka or female serfs. After the Draka developed perfect contraception and switched to using serf women to carry Draka fetuses female Draka were allowed to have male sex slaves. And the genetically engineered 'new race' is altered to be universally bisexual, apparently.
-   The White Court's human thralls in _The Dresden Files_. It should be noted that most of them are essentially brainwashed.
-   The Imperium in _Dune_ allows the possession of sex slaves. The Emperor is allowed to have slave-concubines, Baron Harkonnen uses a slave boy as one, and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen spends a lot of his time with the women in the Baron's slave quarters.
-   In Graham McNeill's Warhammer 40,000 Horus Heresy novel _False Gods_, Maggard is sexually exploited by his mistress, on top of having his vocal cords removed because it was unfitting for him to speak in his mistress's presence.

-   In _The Fifth Sacred Thing,_ by Starhawk, post-eco-apocalypse Southern California is ruled by a high-tech religious dictatorship with gene-engineered slave castes, one of which is bred exclusively for sexual entertainment. In one scene, the protagonist Madrone, a witch-healer from the neopagan utopia around San Francisco, is forced by circumstances to share a cot with a five-year-old girl of that caste. The child tries to touch Madrone sexually and, when gently rebuffed, has a temper tantrum — because she has been frustrated in the only only way she knows of to get approval from adults. Madrone, when she is told about the girl's background, and that these sex-slaves' owners can do _anything at all_ to them, remarks, "I was raised not to believe in evil. But I can't think of any other name for this."

-   _The Handmaid's Tale_ has a main character who is the sex slave (more specifically, a _breeding_ slave) of a military commander.
-   _Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World_:
    -   Sex slaves are a common trade for people who have the money. They are typically females and sold as virgins as a guarantee that there will be no communicable diseases to worry about. Some do double as combat slaves, and biologically speaking if the slave and master are different species is there is no chance of Half-Human Hybrid children being produced.
    -   On a more specific case, Michio Kaga has gained five such slaves over the course of the series. None are human like him, but besides having the title of slave, they are each treated more akin to a beloved spouse. He gifts them all fine clothes, warm food, good equipment, and kindness most have never experienced. He treats them as equals and values their opinions. They all love him deeply in response and are wholly devoted to him as a result.
-   Manpower Incorporated's c-line genetic slaves in the _Honor Harrington_ books, which was the origin of a handful of secondary characters including Virginia Usher and Elaine Kormandorski ( otherwise known as Lady Georgia Young, Countess North Hollow) .
-   This turns out to be common in _The Hunger Games_ as the fate of physically attractive winners of the Hunger Games. The money made from renting them out goes straight to President Snow, but they typically cooperate anyways so as to avoid "accidents" happening to their families. Finnick manages to use this to collect information from the powerful people who purchase him, and after joining the rebels he reveals all the Capitol's dirty laundry in a television broadcast.
-   _The Odyssey_: This happened to Odysseus on the final phase of his journey home, courtesy of Calypso; she _tried_ to make him love her, but was still forcing him to be her lover against his will eventually letting him go when it proved hopeless. Depending on the version it was also the case with Circe; if anything, he was forced to give in to a Scarpia Ultimatum as part of the deal release his men who she had turned to swine.
-   Is a main plot point of the John Ringo _Paladin of Shadows_ series, an extremely guilty pleasure for both the reader _and_ the writer.
-   A type of sexual slavery shows up in a lot of Werewolf fiction, such as the _Mercy Thompson_ and _Kitty Norville_ novels. The alpha can have sex with any female he wants, and/or decide the lowest female in the pack can be given to other males as reward and the female has to take it.
-   Catarina from _Lost Voices_ was sold for cigarettes and vodka by her parents to people who used her a sex slave before her transformation into a mermaid. Because of everything that was done to her, Catarina hates humans more than almost any other mermaid, and refuses to entertain the idea of making peace with such evil creatures.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, the city Yunkai in the Slaver's Bay region is famed for its pleasure slaves trained in the ways of the "seven sighs" and the "sixteen seats of pleasure."

-   _Technic History_: In _A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows_, a major character is sold into prostitution by her political enemies.
-   Jo Walton's _Tooth and Claw_ suggests that even dragons may sink this low. Sebeth, Avan's clerk, was (or claimed to be) the daughter of an Eminent Lord, kidnapped as a child, and, when her father refused to pay the ransom, forced into prostitution until she managed to kill her captor and escape.
-   _The Tough Guide to Fantasyland_:
    -   There are two types for female slaves:
        -   Female Tourists, who are captured into slavery: "You may well be annoyed to find how little your new owner pays for you, but this is the Management's way of protecting you from rape, beatings, and other hardships."
        -   Girls of a Royal Harem, and the sex they have is never forced: "Beautiful young women. You will find these in droves in the FANATIC CALIPHATES and sometimes in the PALACES of bad KINGS. Their duties are light and pleasant and are: looking beautiful, bathing and massaging visitors, singing and dancing, and, for male Tourists, providing company in bed. None of them seem unhappy in their work and they show no desire to escape. \[...\] Often male Tourists will sympathize with the plight of such Slaves, nobly reject their offer of free, no-holds-barred SEX, insist on assisting them to escape from the exploitative tyranny under which they have been existing, and then, having obviously done them a Good Turn, have free, no-holds-barred Sex before stranding them in the middle of nowhere to make their way thousands of miles back to their own COUNTRY."
    -   Male slaves are "used by bad KINGS, FANATIC CALIPHATES, and some WIZARDS in large numbers as GUARDS, attendants, fan-bearers, waiters and entertainment, and for SEX."
-   Played with in the _Warchild Series_. The pirates take prisoners and sometimes recruit children as geishas, which are only loosely based on the old customs. Mostly, they are sex slaves and sometimes assassins. In the first book, the main character was a prisoner whom the Big Bad intended to turn into one of these. He escapes without much of the training (but a lot of the abuse). It's not until the third book that one of these slaves becomes a main character. This is not played for Fanservice, but rather deconstructed to show the psychological ramifications related to such an existence. Very dark portrayal, really.
-   Paolo Bacigalupi's _The Windup Girl_ features Emiko, a Japanese Windup abandoned by her master in a dystopian Bangkok. Windups, or "New People," are genetically altered to have an irrepressible instinct to please and have been trained from birth that they are in a position of servitude. While revered in Japan as works of art and strong workers, they are hated in Bangkok and, in order to avoid being picked up by police and incinerated, Emiko is forced to work in a sex club, where she is routinely humiliated and abused. Also, Emiko's body has been genetically engineered to feel orgasm automatically under sexual stimulation. When she is raped, she actually _comes_ - hating every moment of it and despising herself for it. Enjoy your Brain Bleach.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_, one of the many signs that the _Pegasus_ crew have crossed the Moral Event Horizon is their use of a captured Number Six Cylon as a sex slave.
-   Warren's ex-girlfriend Katrina in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ almost became this when the Trio (a trio of villainous college-aged nerds turned mad scientists) tested their mind control ray on her. She fought off the mind control before anything could happen, and Warren killed her in the ensuing struggle. When setting up their grand scheme, their plans included Conjure Fake I.D.s, Girls, Girls, The Gorilla Thing, and Make Buffy Their Sex Slave.
-   _The Commish_ also has an episode where a 15 year old girl (who used to be the babysitter of the Commisioner's son) is forced into doing porno films. _And_ pleasing the boss.
-   In _Dante's Cove_, Ambrosius holds Toby hostage to force Kevin to become his sex slave. Later, Griff uses his influence with the Tresum Council to try to get Grace to submit to him similarly, but she outwits him.
-   Every Active in _Dollhouse_ is used for this frequently. They are overwritten with new personalities and then hired out to clients, many of whom (though not all) specifically do so to indulge in romantic fantasies. While the Actives' original personalities effectively signed a contract to be used as sex slaves with the Dollhouse beforehand, it's only offered to people who were in some sort of dire straits, nor would such an agreement hold up in any modern court of law.
-   _Engrenages_: One of the major plots of the third season has Laure and the other cops going up against a gang of Albanian pimps who keep their trafficked women as virtual prisoners in a sleazy motel, keep all the money they earn, and react to any hint of rebellion by brutally torturing them or handing them over to a local Serial Killer to be murdered. They even kill one of them in a copycat murder when the killer gets arrested, so that he'll be thought innocent and let out of jail to continue working as their ultimate sanction.
-   Though we don't see it directly in _Firefly_, it is implied that the sexual slave trade is around. When Mal discovers River in Simon's cryo box, the first thing he assumes is that Simon is smuggling her to be sold to a Border-world baron.
-   Zev (or Xev) of _Lexx_ was going to be made one of these, but she broke free before the mental reconditioning was implemented. This conditioning was inflicted instead on 790, the robot drone overseeing the operation. Since the conditioning resulted in the victim falling hopelessly in love with the first person s/he saw next, 790 became obsessed with Zev, devoting himself to her completely.
-   _Lost Girl_ plays with this: the closest anyone comes to using the word "slave" to describe Lauren is when she refers to herself as the Ash's property, even though she clearly is a slave, even to the point of wearing a Slave Collar. She nevertheless enjoys a great deal of prestige within the fae community, and is primarily valuable as a slave for her medical expertise. All the same, when it suits his purpose, the Ash orders her to seduce and sleep with Bo, even though it ends up wrecking her relationship with Bo when she finds out that that was why Lauren slept with her.
-   The final series of the _Murphy's Law_ revolves around the search for a missing police officer who has been caught up in a sex slave ring. Does a very good job at describing just how brutal and terrifying the real thing can actually be.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   The Orion slave girls, first seen in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ pilot "The Cage". These are an interesting example because they are retconned in the _Star Trek: Enterprise_ episode "Bound" into secretly being the rulers of their race. They use the pretense of being sex-slaves to infiltrate enemy organizations, and then use powerful pheromones to control any males they wish, as they do with the males of their own species. The whole set-up comes across as a bit of an awkward plot device, though, and some argue that this situation carries more Unfortunate Implications than just playing the trope straight.
    -   In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Bread and Circuses", Kirk is the well-treated prisoner of the ruler of an Ancient Rome Planet. A female slave is sent to his quarters by his captor. The slave makes it clear (quite suggestively) that she was _ordered_ to please Kirk. It's left unclear whether Kirk actually has sex with her, but it is clearly at least a possibility.
    -   In _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, Bajoran women were kept as "comfort women" during the Cardassian occupation.
    -   In _Star Trek: Voyager_, the holodeck program _The Adventures of Captain Proton_ (a _Flash Gordon_ expy) has slave girls that the players can rescue. Presumably they are quite grateful to their saviours.
-   The plot of Season 2 of _The Wire_ kicks off when a shipping container full of dead Eastern European sex slaves are found on the Baltimore docks.

    Music Video 

-   The video for "Bad Romance" depicts Lady Gaga as one of these. At the end of the video, she burns to death the man who buys her.

    Tabletop RPG 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   In every edition except the 4th, dryads occasionally use their magical abilities to charm men to force them to become their lovers and companions. (Although, in some editions, most release them after a while.)
    -   The splat book _Legions of Hell_ describes Glasya, the Archdutchess of Malbolge, the Sixth Hell, as a cruel sadist who deals with trespassers in her realm by casting them into torture chambers. Unless they are male and very attractive, in which case it might be worse; she has been known to either force them into this situation or offer it as an alternate punishment. (It's suggested that she kills or imprisons most of them eventually anyway, once they bore her.)
-   _Earthdawn_. The Theran Empire designated some of its slaves as "Pleasure Slaves".
-   _Exalted_: In addition to the "regular" form, some populations have been raised, trained, and even bred (or worse yet, genetically engineered!) for this. A particularly disturbing case of the "regular" variety is found in the Djala, who are slender, delicately built pygmies. True pygmies; as adults, they do not exceed 4'10". Don't think about it too much.
-   The Batraeans of _Talislanta_ has this as their Hat: the males, who are grossly ugly, systematically sells their female relatives, who are all incredibly beautiful and sensual, as slaves and concubines to their more civilised neighbours, and treat them very much as chattle before they do. Batraean females has pheromones that makes men lustful, but for some reason their own males are immune, which they often use to be relatively well-treated slaves. Other forms of sex slavery exist as well - Thaecians and Sawilans are preyed upon by slavers for that reason, for instance.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Dark Eldar and followers of Slaanesh practice sexual slavery.
    -   This is also common among Imperial nobility, though whether they're called courtesans, consorts, slave or whatever else varies depending on the specific planet. As long as the nobles don't go too far (which is pretty far), the Inquisition doesn't care.
-   This is a simplistic and biased but not entirely inaccurate view of Mars' Julandri Courtesan sub-caste in _Rocket Age_. They are technically owned by the Royal and Priest castes, but they are closer to geishas than concubines and they have far better lives and potentially can hold a lot of soft power than almost anyone else in their society. Despite this, they still fall into this trope a lot of the time.

-   _Fallout: New Vegas_:
    -   Although all the player ever sees of Legion slaves is them carrying heavy loads, it is heavily implied that the women are subjected to rape on a regular basis, and a bit more subtly that the men aren't just used as pack mules either.
    -   There's also an entire quest ("Bye Bye Love") set in the casino of Gomorrah to break a prostitute out of sexual slavery done in a similar fashion to Real Life: Joana is an expensive hooker who's controlled by her bosses using her drug addiction and threats of violence.
