"Lightning fired his fiercest bolt straight at Shrek's head. Shrek just gobbled it, belched some smoke, and grinned."

_"If it looks good, eat it. And it all looks good to me."_

The Extreme Omnivore will eat just about _anything_ out of hunger or curiosity, so long as it looks like food. And sometimes even when it clearly doesn't. They don't fear the Lethal Chef, and you will never hear them say I Ate WHAT?!

There are two versions of this trope:

1.  **Unpicky Eater:** The milder of the two and can apply to ordinary unpowered individuals. This character is willing to eat things that may be perfectly nutritious, but are either considered unhygienic (e.g., it fell on the floor, it's roadkill, another character has been eating it, or it's expired and/or spoiled), or taboo (e.g., insects, horseflesh) in that character's society. They may be indifferent to, or ignorant of, the social conventions that keep most people from eating those things, or they might be from another culture or species where such things are accepted. Perhaps they may just be so desperate for food that they don't care, in which case that would overlap with Too Desperate to Be Picky. Often they have a Bizarre Taste in Food. This version can exist in real life. They may also be the only one who likes food produced by the Cordon Bleugh Chef or the Lethal Chef.
2.  **Can Eat Anything:** For super powered individuals there may be overlap with type one via Personality Powers. They can and will eat **anything**, even things that would make a person gravely sick if they consumed them in real life. Rocks, sticks, dirt, metal... nothing is too tough for this character to eat, and they can digest it with few ill effects. They can digest completely inedible items and may either have strong enough teeth to bite through said material or stomach acid that can digest it as a Required Secondary Power. Their stomach may also be able to hold an excessive amount of food. If a video game character, they are likely to be able to consume their foes whether living or not.

Both versions may also be open to the idea of cannibalism when the opportunity presents itself.

Please note that instances of someone being forced to eat something disgusting or inappropriate isn't Extreme Omnivorosity. Likewise for unintentional ingestion. A true Extreme Omnivore has a long-term _pattern_ of eating everything knowingly, willingly, and usually cheerfully.

Compare Paste Eater. Horde of Alien Locusts can be an entire species of this. Extreme Omni-Goat is a subtrope where this applies to goats. A character like this is likely to be a Big Eater, though a Big Eater generally restricts themselves to things ordinarily considered food. Compare Extreme Omnisexual. Contrast Picky Eater and Unconventional Food Usage. Compare Fantastic Diet Requirement; while the Extreme Omnivore can eat almost anything, but doesn't typically require any one specific intake, someone with a Fantastic Diet Requirement _needs_ to eat something unusual, usually a single specific thing, either exclusively or as part of their diet.

**Don't Try This at Home**, seriously. People have _died_ trying to eat things not meant for human consumption. At best, you'll feel sick to your stomach. At worst, you'll die because of it.

    Advertising 

-   For a few McDonald's commercials, Ronald McDonald and the McDonaldland gang knew a diminutive monster named Bernice who tended to eat anything. For one ongoing series of commercials, she ate a movie script that Ronald needed, and Ronald had to use things like an X-ray and a flashlight on her to find out what the script said. (In the second case, she ate the flashlight.)
-   At the end of the infamous Nickelodeon Egg and Spoon Vanity Plate, the egg monster turns to the viewer and eats the camera like it's nothing more than pie.
-   Played with in a Canadian commercial for Tim Horton's. A group of Big Eater types are talking about their gastronomical adventures. One subverts the game by telling the group about a nice bowl of chicken stew he ate..."And then I ate the bowl!" The ad is for Timmie's stew in a bowl made of bread.
-   A brand of cracker snacks named "TUC" has a series of commercials featuring an insatiably hungry woman who swallows any nearby object she finds whole, before being given a pack of TUC crackers to satisfy her hunger.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Garfield_: Garfield will eat anything that's edible, including things like chocolate that would kill a real cat. However, even he has his limits — he hates raisins, and Jon's cooking at times. He also refuses to eat mice, much to Jon's disappointment. He's eaten a few inedible objects too, although in most cases it's by accident because he's shoveling down his food so fast he doesn't realize until it's too late. Deliberate examples include swallowing the TV remote to keep Jon from getting it, and eating Jon's wallet because it was made from cowhide. On another occasion, he starts eating the _fridge_ after finding it empty, and says that he's "had worse". If the June 27, 2021 strip is anything to go by, Garfield is willing to take a bite out of **the moon** should he be hungry enough.
-   _Get Fuzzy_: Satchel is one; he has eaten seat cushions, candles, and _the remote for the TV._

    Fan Works 

-   _The Bolt Chronicles_:
    -   In "The Supermarket," Bolt is portrayed as being willing to eat almost anything, no matter how disgusting it is. He even admits to this later when he says, "Pig innards aren't even the nastiest thing I've eaten today."
        
        **Mittens:** Coming from a critter who'll eat almost anything organic no matter how gross it is, that's not exactly a ringing endorsement.
        
    -   In "The Insomniac," Mittens describes Bolt as being willing to eat anything, saying it's typical of him since he's a dog — but that it may prove fatal if he's unlucky.
        
        **Mittens:** Geez, anything could happen, you know? Bolt could get hit by a car or eat food loaded with poison by mistake and kick the bucket, just like that. And darn him, he'll chow down on almost anything. He's such a dog that way.
        
-   _The Boy Who Cried Idiot_: Downplayed and discussed when Clyde mentions a video in which a little girl _attempts_ to eat rocks.
-   _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_ has DreamFuture!Calvin and Hobbes forced to eat tires while deserted. Later in the same episode (after the dream ends), Calvin remarks that gum ointment is somewhat tasty and contemplates eating a tire.
-   _Casey Steele_: As part of a joke:
    
    She giggled briefly before looking around in confusion, "What did you do with your wet bathing suit?"  
    "I ate it," I said with grin, "I was hungry."  
    "Seriously?" she asked as her eyes opened widely.  
    "No, not really, I just sent it away..."
    
-   _Cheesy Potaters_: Sniper is perfectly willing to eat a container of three-week-old mac and cheese with a thick layer of mold on it (after scraping the mold off, of course), commenting that he'd eaten far worse as a tracker in the Outback. He doesn't actually get to eat it because Spy (whose standards for food are much higher) snatches it at the last minute and throws it in the trash.
-   _Eater_: Izuku has a Quirk called Real Eater that lets him eat _anything_ including being an Abstract Eater, being able to eat things that have no substance like laughter, Quirks, and his injuries (not his flesh, the fact he was injured at all).
-   In several _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ fanfics, Doc Boy from _Garfield_ shows up or is mentioned. In these fics, he's been known to eat ANYTHING, including people.
-   _Enter the Dragon_: After transforming into a dragon, Harry Potter eats pretty much anything and everything, with a particular fondness for petrol and steel. The only material Harry is shown to dislike the taste of is wood. When he gets a cave to use as a lair, Harry expands it by eating the stone until he decides his lair is big enough.
-   _Fallout: Equestria - Project Horizons_: Blackjack starts out as just an unpicky eater, nomming down happily on a Lethal Chef's cooking and Foreign Queasine with gusto, but when she's augumented, it really takes off. Bonus points go to when she's hit with an assassination attempt and, instead, eats the knife.
-   _Gensokyo 20XX_: An age-regressed Reimu from the later parts of the series. Slightly justified because she was mentally conditioned to not have a sense of danger or question anything that doesn't seem right (her own reasonings, especially), so, besides Sniff Sniff Nom or putting things in her mouth in general, she'll eat anything the other kids might find disgusting or get bored of.
    
    **Reimu**:"I like ratburgers."  
    **Sakuya**: "Reimu, you eat anything in which it is you pick up\[...\]"
    
-   _Hard Being Pure_: Noa cannot properly eat like a normal person, and instead gains sustenance from the matter she disintegrates through her telekinetic power. She can use her power to digest just about anything.
-   _Harry Is a Dragon, and That's OK_: A good chunk of humor is dragon!Harry being able to eat virtually anything. He's eaten everything from plastic packaging, hedge trimmings, metal cutlery and glitter to potion ingredients and Howlers. Once the House Elves get wind of this, they start serving specially marked Harry-only dishes made with otherwise inedible ingredients, like metal and hemlock. The hemlock was actually a poisoning attempt, but Harry didn't notice.
-   _Light and Dark The Adventures of Dark Yagami_: At one point, the narration casually mentions L eating a TV remote.
-   _Natural Histories_: Salamanders feed on anything organic — fresh plants, eggs, animals too injured, weak or stupid to avoid them, carrion, rotting leaves, and anything else they stumble across; it's all fuel to them.
-   _The Nightmare House_: Baby Lily Loud doesn't know what a mortgage is, so she dreams it's a ravenous beast named Mor-Gaj, who eats money, Rita's purse, and tries to eat her.
-   _Not the intended use (Zantetsuken Reverse)_: The Ghoul soul allows Soma to eat anything as long as it was edible at some point in the past:
    
    The Ghoul soul made everything taste like it was at its freshest, something Soma was greatly thankful for. A superpower that just suppressed the gag reflex and stopped food poisoning was useful but not pleasant.
    
-   _The Parselmouth of Gryffindor_: All food gets magically vanished — turned into magical energy — the moment it enters his body, anyway, so Maximilian pulls no stops and does things like eating the wrapping along with the candy.
-   _Queen of All Oni_: After Jade becomes a Shadowkan girl once more, her appetite and metabolism go way up, and in one chapter, she eats a rib, BONE AND ALL!
-   _The Secret Return of Alex Mack_: The Downingtown Blob appears to be able to consume _any_ organic matter and grow larger; even upholstery is fair game. It can be injured by fire or electricity, but will immediately consume the damaged cells and thus minimise its losses.
-   _Selaginella Lepidophylla_: Amethyst discusses marinating something in soap as part of her meal.
-   _A Shadow of the Titans_: Jade once bit the tongs off her spoon, and only noticed when she tried to pick up another bite. She lampshades it multiple times, and Jinx makes a Running Gag out of asking Jade if she's part goat or something.
-   _Twila The Girl Who Waz In Luv With A Vampyre_: The protagonists eat Bella's bed after they kill her "so there would be no evidenze (lol geddit like evinezenze.)"
-   _Tyrant Kings_: Humans and dinosaurs are noted as being the only sapient species that can safely consume both dextro and levo amino-based foods, whereas every other race will at best gain no nutrition from one and at worst have a fatal allergic reaction.
-   _With This Ring_:
    -   The orange light is the light of avarice, so as his skills progress, the protagonist is able to use it to "consume" anything, even intangibles like magic. Nearby metals are corroded, spells are drained, and even Maltusians are well advised to back away and shield themselves.
        
        **Paul**: FEED ME!
        
    -   He also keeps a swarm of Praexis Demons that have been turned into orange constructs, but have lost none of their insatiable appetite in the process. Not only will they eat anything he lets them catch, they can also feed on ambient heat, Energy Weapon fire, and even the spiritual energies of a crime scene.
-   _Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse_: Miriam can safely digest normally inedible organic matter like bone, shell and hoof, and even has a tendency to gnaw on things made of wood or metal when she's distracted or bored, to her chagrin. She blames it on being a tiger shark-aspect Fishman hybrid, as tiger sharks are notorious for eating _anything_ they can swallow, even compared to other sharks.

    Podcasts 

-   Ghouls from _Less is Morgue_ will eat pretty much anything - examples in the show so far include both living things and corpses, as well as glue, soap, straight mayonnaise, a car tire, bugs, and rodents. It's pretty gross.
-   Tellie from _Sequinox_ is able to consume anything inorganic because it's not part of the Earth. Technically this means it's supposed to eat trash, but in the end it eats basically anything put in front of it except for food. And Tootsie Rolls.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_:
    -   The Spikit. It has been known to tear parts off people's cars and eat them.
    -   The Kinloka Rat. It can and will eat anything and everything.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Amnesia: Memories_' fandisc _Amnesia LATER_: Ukyo gets a pasta dish, loaded with extra spicy habanero sauce he knows nothing about, adds tabasco on top and eats it. The guys that put the habanero sauce on there as a prank are amazed that Ukyo ate it without flinching or even commenting on the taste.
