Mrs, Ms, and Missy.  
Image by lumi-mae. Used with permission.

A trio of ladies: the steady, wise **Wife**, the sexual, often lively **Seductress**, and the innocent **Child**.

The Wife is the calmer, more reliable personality, and is someone around whom one could build a home life. This does not necessarily mean she is motherly. The Seductress is passionate, sexually experienced and independent. The "Child" (who does _not_ have to be a literal child) is innocent, perhaps painfully so, sweet and kind.

Sometimes The Wife can also be the Seductress and vice versa, being not only calm, reliable, and motherly, but also passionate, sexually experienced, flirtatious, and independent.

So in short, a triad of:

-   Calm and Capable
-   Hot and Sexy
-   Playful and Innocent

All three character types are considered to be very feminine — with Child representing Light Feminine, Seductress representing Dark Feminine and Wife being in the middle. Instead of butch, femme, and neither it's (lady-like) femme, (overtly sexy) femme, and (girly) femme.

As a Villainess Trio, the Wife is very often the calculating, informative villainess. The Seductress is the more hands-on, sadistic (sometimes even lewd) villainess. With the Child commonly posing as the deceptively naive, cutesy glue to hold them together.

Contrast:

-   Beauty, Brains, and Brawn which has attractive, smart, and tough while in this trope all three represent different kinds of beauty: pleasant, provocative, and pretty. Alternatively beautiful, sexy, and cute. If brains or brawn are attached, they could go to any of the three.
-   Freudian Trio (an all-female version) with the Id being the flirtatious, charming Seductress. The Superego being the dutiful, hardworking Wife, leaving the Ego as the impressionable, often conflicted Child. Of course, this can be played with.
-   Madonna-Whore Complex where any individual woman must be either "sexual and malevolent" or "virtuous and maternal", but cannot be anything else.
-   The Weird Sisters, where the personality distinction does not need to be present, and the three must be supernatural.

Compare and contrast:

-   The Hecate Sisters, where the "maiden" combines the naiveté of the child with the sexuality of the seductress, the "mother" combines the liveliness of the seductress with the maturity of the wife, and the "crone" combines the experience of the wife with the disinterest of the child. The Hecates can represent a lifelong cycle of youthful, matured, and elderly, where the Eves can represent a coming of age cycle of naive, exploring, and wise.
-   The Three Faces of Adam, the Spear Counterpart to The Hecate Sisters.

Named for the 1957 film _The Three Faces of Eve_, about a woman with multiple personalities representing each of these types.

    Anime and Manga 

Generally, most Unwanted Harem series will have a dynamic among the potential love interests, with the child typically being the Token Mini-Moe.

-   _Ah! My Goddess_' three Goddesses:
    -   Immature kid sister Skuld, who is the goddess of the future.
    -   The calm, compassionate, and domestic Belldandy, goddess of the present.
    -   The flirty, firey, half-demon Urd, goddess of the past.
-   _Aria the Scarlet Ammo_ has Aria, a childish, inexperienced tsundere, Shirayuki, a wifely Yamato Nadeshiko, and Riko who seduces people for both fun and profit.
-   _Cat's Eye_: The Kisugi sisters.
    -   The Eldest sister Rui is the wise one who takes the place of the girls' Missing Mom.
    -   Middle sister Hitomi is sexy and emotional and has a steady love interest
    -   Youngest sister Ai is the Child: tomboyish, cheerful and a Wrench Wench
-   In _Change 123,_ Motoko's three alternate personalities follow this mold. Mikiri is the innocent child, Hibiki is the Hot-Blooded seductress and Fujiko is the wise, motherly wife.
-   _Daimos_:
    -   Erika is the calm, intelligent, reflective wife.
    -   Raiza is sexy, sensual seductress who uses her feminine charms to get what she wants.
    -   Nana is the young, temperamental, child.
-   _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_ The Three Kocho Sisters:
    -   Kanae was the eldest and most caring sister, she isn't overtly flirtatious but kept a serene and whimsical nature about her. She was good-natured (a little too good) that although smoothed Shinobu's personality, ended up costing her life. (Seductress)
    -   Shinobu was previously very critical, but mellowed-out overtime she became similar to Kanae, though deep down she still held great anger, for the demon that ruined her family. (Wife)
    -   Kanao is the "Odd-One-Out" between the sisters, she's a pondering, quiet girl who is looking for meaning in her life. She couldn't express her thoughts and feelings, until Tanjiro got her to open-up more. (Child)
-   _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA_ has the eventual main character trio Illya, Miyu and Chloe:
    -   Illya is immature, optimistic and somewhat simple-minded, as well as being a literal child.
    -   Miyu is a stoic and smart wife, who is supportive and protective of Illya as well as having many domestic skills.
    -   Chloe is the seductress, being _very_ open-minded about matters of love. She has to kiss other people a lot,since it's how she gets the energy she needs to live).
-   _Food Wars!_:
    -   Among the Polaris girls, Megumi is the Wife, being the sweet, humble one of the trio with a talent for home cooking.
    -   Ryoko is the Seductress, being the sexiest and most provocative of the three.
    -   Yuuki is the Child, being the cheerful, energetic mood-maker of Polaris Dormitory.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_ plays with this a bit, possibly unconsciously. Of the three women who show interest in Onizuka:
    -   Tomoko is clearly the child, being cute, innocent, and full of Incorruptible Pure Pureness.
    -   Urumi acts the most like the seductress, but she's as sexually inexperienced as the other two.
    -   Azusa is the wife, being the only adult and the most sensible, though she has her moments of immaturity and naivety.
-   _Gohan no Otomo_ has Mai and her two friends, Tomo and Noe. Mai (the Child) is the youngest of three children, gets frequently pranked by her brothers, and describes herself as immature. She describes Tomo (the Seductress) as stylish and outgoing, and she is the only one among the group who has a boyfriend. Meanwhile, Noe (the Wife) is described as smart and independent—having travelled overseas on her own in order to study other cultures. Ironically, the other two thinks that _Mai_ is the one they should learn from, as she is the best at doing housework.
-   _Madlax_ gives us Margaret Burton as the Wife (gentle, quiet Ordinary Highschool Student), Madlax as the Seductress (deadly and sexy hitwoman with a heart), and Laetitia as the Child (creepy-looking Lonely Doll Girl). It's even more meaningful when we find out that Laetitia and Madlax are actually _parts of Margaret's whole self_, released when she killed her Brainwashed and Crazy father (and the first Madlax) in self-defense years ago. In the end, Margaret decides to accept her past and split herself again in three, adopting Laetitia as her little sister and releasing Madlax so she can live her life as she sees fit.
-   _Mazinger Z_:
    -   Jealous, temperamental, nagging, tantrum-prone Sayaka Yumi is the child.
    -   Mature, calm, collected, professional Misato is the wife.
    -   Beautiful, sensual and alluring Erika is the seductress.
-   For _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_, the results aren't exactly balanced, but the primary dragon characters of the main cast do fit this to a certain degree:
    -   Kanna is the child, as not only is she a literal toddler, but she possesses little - if any - romantic interest towards anyone.
    -   Tohru is the wife; although she doesn't _always_ fall under wholesome (she notably tries several times to mate with Kobayashi), the main reason she chose to stay with her was that Kobayashi saved her in the past, even if she was drunk at the time.
    -   Lucoa, finally, fits under the seductress category; not only does she constantly wear what can _barely_ be considered clothing, but she is openly lecherous towards those who interest her. Quite tellingly, Shouta, the one boy she has any interest in, constantly mistakes her for a succubus, something her antics do very little to disprove.
-   Among the girls who fall in love with Kurusu in _Monster Musume_, several form up into distinct triads:
    -   First there is Papi, the joyous, naive child; Centaurea, the honorable and loyal wife; and Miia, the flirtatious and seductive temptress.
    -   Secondly, there is Suu, the naive and innocent child; Meroune, the wifely character who wants a classic romance with Kimihito (albeit a rather bizarre "tragic romance"), and the most openly sexual member of the cast; Rachnera the Seductress.
    -   Even the three main members of the MON group fit this trope, with the innocent and girlish Tionishia being the Child (despite her massive size), shy and demure Manako being the Wife, and laddish, teasing Zombina being the Seductress, traits that can be most easily seen during the chapter where they all go on dates with Kimihito.
-   _Panzer World Galient_:
    -   Queen Felia is the calm, mature, wife.
    -   Hilmuka is the beautiful, sultry, temptress.
    -   Hot-tempered, emotional twelve-year-old Chiruru is the child.
-   _One Piece_: The female crewmates of Straw Hats can be grouped this way. Robin is the Wife being the Team Mom who’s patient and calm and only gets angered at mistreatment of her younger crew members. Nami is the Seductress being The Tease, Dude Magnet and overt Ms. Fanservice often to get what she wants. Vivi is the Child, younger than Robin or Nami, shy about her body and optimistically pure and sweet. Vivi can also be swapped out for the equally child-like Carrot.
-   In _Please Teacher!_, the heroine, Mizuho, is the "sensible and capable" Wife, her "innocent childlike" sister Maho is the Child, and the "Hotter and Sexier" Hatsuho is the Seductress, despite the fact that she's their mother.
-   _Ranma ½_: This dynamic is overplayed for laughs with the three Tendo sisters:
    -   Kasumi, the oldest, is the motherly House Wife figure, who is so kind and pure-hearted that she has no negative inclination whatsoever.
    -   Nabiki, the second, is a sociopathic hedonist and heartbreaking seductress.
    -   Akane, the youngest, is a naive, temperamental, idealistic child.
-   _Saber Marionette J_:
    -   Lime, the child, is youthful in appearance, overly cheerful, and a bit dumb at times.
    -   Cherry, the wife, is domestic, even-tempered, and focused on propriety.
    -   Bloodberry is the most mature looking of the three, more shameless and more sexual in her intention.
-   In _Saiyuki_, (even though all three are male):
    -   Goku is optimistic (especially for a demon), youthful, and more than a bit clueless.
    -   Hakkai, the group's House Husband, is the smartest and most even-tempered.
    -   Gojyo is flirty and physical, particularly where women are concerned.
-   In _Tenchi Muyo!_ the first three girls in Tenchi's household
    -   The pure-hearted and young Sasami
    -   The dignified and demure Ayeka
    -   The boisterous and overtly sexual Ryoko
-   The three Deviluke sisters in _To Love Ru_: the Nice Girl Lala, the Tsundere Nana, and the seductive Momo.
-   _Vandread_ has the three Dread pilots who combine with Hibiki.
    -   Dita is the Genki Girl, who behaves childishly.
    -   Meia is the more calm and collective wife, who takes her role as Dread Leader seriously.
    -   Jura is the older seductress, who was to get closer to Hibiki more intimately.
-   The three female Card Professors in _Yu-Gi-Oh! R_ fall into this.
    -   Reiko Kitamori, the Child, is a Shrinking Violet whose first instinct is to run away whenever she sees a Duelist despite being a very skilled one herself.
    -   Tilla Mook, the Seductress, is a beautiful Goth whose deck revolves around her vampire "master".
    -   Mrs. Maico Kato, the Wife, is a sedate, elderly woman who dotes on her grandchildren (and has to be careful not to beat them too badly when they play Duel Monsters.)

    Comic Books 

-   In some versions of the _Legion of Super-Heroes_, Triplicate Girl (or Triad) has a different personality for each body; Triad-Purple is brash and outgoing (seductress), Triad-Orange is shy and quiet (Child) and Triad-White is the stable figure who has to keep the other two together (Wife).
-   In the DC Universe series _Gotham City Sirens_, Harley Quinn plays up her clownish persona by acting ditzy and naive (child), Catwoman is pragmatic and sensible (Wife), and Poison Ivy is a vamp known for using her sex appeal to get her way (seductress).
-   _Batman and the Outsiders_: Halo is the child, Katana is the wife/widow, and Looker is the seductress.
    -   The 2018 _Batman and the Outsiders_ series zig-zagged it a bit. Role of the child is this time taken by Cassandra Cain due to her being the youngest and lacking in social expertise, though a lot of her innocence was lost already. but the other two roles seem split between Katana and Lady Shiva. Katana has blatant Unresolved Sexual Tension with Black Lightning but resists it out of feeling it could be a betrayal of her dead husband, meaning the motivation of Wife/Widow prevents her from stepping into the role of Seductress. Shiva acts the role of Seductress, albeit non-sexual, as she attempts to tempt pretty much everyone on the team in some way, from urging Jefferson to seek revenge to trying to convince her daughter to abandon Batman's ideals. However, she does it due to a feeling being in Batman's shadow stifles Cassandra's potential - meaning she only assumes the role of Seductress out of a motivation befitting Wife/Mother.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: For a while Diana (calm rational experienced hero), Artemis (skimpily dressed Amazonian Beauty), and Cassie (a child/young teenager new to heroics) acted as a trio of heroes working together to fight villains.
-   One of the tales told in _The Sandman (1989)_ is about Adam having three Eves: the first one was too sexually aggressive for Adam and was forced to leave Eden, the second one was too innocent and was rejected by Adam after he got squicked out by watching her body be formed organ by organ in front of him, and the third one was created from Adam's rib and lived to an old age.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In Alan Moore's _Lost Girls_, Alice is the Seductress (the one who initiates the sex games), Wendy is the Wife (a literal housewife) and Dorothy is the Child (the youngest and most good-natured).

    Fan Works 

-   _Evangelion 303_: The three female pilots:
    -   Asuka is the intelligent, competent and dependable wife (when she is emotionally stable).
    -   Mari is the Seductress: she is sexy, she knows it, and she flaunts it to the point that her weapons officer states that she shoots off hormones like they were lasers)
    -   Rei is the Child: she is naive, innocent and insecure.
-   _The Second Try_:
    -   Asuka is the wife in more ways than one: She is wise, dependable and supportive, to the point that Shinji usually depends on her for everything.

    -   Rei is the child: she is innocent, inmature, insecure and socially ignorant.
-   It's not really canon, but if we count Past Sins, then the three ponies touched by the Nightmare Forces fit this trope: we have wise Luna (wife), innocent Nyx (child), and flirty Rarity (seductress).
-   In _Thousand Shinji_:
    -   Asuka is the wife. She calmed Shinji down and her presence kept him emotionally stable.
    -   Rei is the emotional child.
    -   Misato is the sultry, sensual seductress.

    Literature

Carrie White is shy, quiet, unsocial, submissive and unaware in things like periods (child), Sue Snell who is more mature, conformist, level-headed and the only one of the three who lives to adulthood (wife) and Chris Hargensen is the vain and good-looking Alpha Bitch who Really Gets Around and has a manipulative streak (seductress).
-   _The Twilight Saga_ has Esme (wife), who welcomes Bella into her home and later restores a cottage on the Cullen estate for Bella and Edward, Rosalie (seductress), who is jealous of Edward's affection for Bella because she's used to being desired by men, and Alice (child), who values Bella's safety above all and cares for her like a sister.

Helen is the wife, steadfastly devoted to her marriage even when it begins to fall apart; she takes her marital duties so seriously that she returns to Grassdale when Huntingdon is ill to care for him. Millicent is the child, innocent, idealistic, and very passive. Annabella is the seductress, tricking Lord Lowborough into marriage with her beauty and luring Huntingdon away from Helen.
-   _David Copperfield_ gives us the three ladies whom David loved through his life. His First Love is Little Emily, the Seductress, who is aware of her good looks, may or may have not been a prostitute, and is best friends with on one. Dora is the child, spoiled, sweet, naive, even nicknamed 'his child wife'. Agnes is the Wife (reliable, the "angel of the house", softspoken, and a Proper Lady).
-   _His Family_: Roger's daughters. Edith fits the "wife" face exactly, nurturing, motherly and dedicated to her children to the exclusion of everything else. Laura is the "seductress", as she is sexy, likes to party, and Really Gets Around. Deborah isn't quite the "innocent", as she is a hard-working social activist, but she is somewhat virginal and puritanical.
-   The three primary female characters in William Lindsay Gresham's _Nightmare Alley_ fall into these roles. Zeena is the mature, steady and motherly mentor figure, Molly is the sweet and innocent child-like ingenue and Lilith is the sexy, scheming and manipulative seductress.
-   In the last three _Harry Potter_ books (mainly Books 5 and 6), the three girls in Harry's immediate circle of friends form this dynamic. Hermione, being the down-to-earth devoted student that she is, is the Wife. Luna, innocent and more than a little quirky, is the Child. Finally, Ginny, hot-headed jock who has come well out of her shell that she spent her first three years in, is easily the Seductress.
-   In _Things Fall Apart_, main character Okonkwo conveniently has three wives to fill the roles. His senior wife is the Wife; she's so unremarkable that her name is never given and is only referred to as her son's mother. While there has been friction between her and Ekwefi, she is ultimately kind to the younger wives and their children; she not only cares for Ojiugo's children when Ojiugo stays out late with with her friends and forgets to feed them, but she tries to protect Ojiugo from Okonkwo's wrath by lying and saying Ojiugo arranged this with her beforehand. Ojiugo is the Child, as the youngest and most irresponsible of the three, and Ekwefi was the Seductress in her youth, as the village beauty and Okonkwo's (and the narrative's) favorite wife, though her first husband abusing her after she chose him over Okonkwo and all but one of her children with Okonkwo dying shortly after birth have tempered these aspects of her personality.

    Live-Action TV

-   In _Knots Landing_, there is Karen, the wife, who is wise and calm. Abby is The Seductress — sexually experienced and independent. Val is The "Child" (although she's the same age as the other women) because she is innocent to the point of naivete.
-   _Friends_ has flirty and sophisticated Rachel as the seductress, innocent and quirky Phoebe as the child, and capable, responsible Monica as the wife.
-   _Community_ has a study group composed of Shirley, the wife who seeks to be the voice of reason and mediator wherever possible; Britta, the seductress, who has the most varied sex-life and uses sex to get what she wants; and Annie, the child who is the most idealistic and naive.
-   The three female leads of _Mad Men_: Joan is the seductress, completely willing to using her sexuality to get what she wants. At first glance, Betty (Stepford Smiler housewife) would seem to be the wife, with Peggy (Plucky Office Girl) being the child, but before long, childishness establishes itself as one of Betty's flaws, and Peggy works to leave behind the role of wide-eyed little girl and become a capable woman.
-   The three ladies of _The Golden Girls_ minus Sophia. Rose was the child (sweet and naive), Dorothy was the wife (calm and sensible) and Blanche was the seductress (sexy and fiery.)
-   _A.N.T. Farm_ has Chyna (wife), Olive (child) and Lexi (seductress).
-   The ladies of _Gilligan's Island_, but not the way you'd expect:
    -   Mrs. Howell (the oldest and the only married woman, and very happily so), is actually the Child: she's naive, pretty much nonsexual, and dependent.
    -   Tall, sexy, flirtatious, Hollywood-starlet Ginger is the Seductress.
    -   Young, sweet, gentle farm Girl Next Door Mary Ann is the stable, mature, reliable Wife".
-   _Charmed_:

She is also the first one to actually get married and have children. Paige is the child, being the youngest, newest member of the family and the least experienced in the ways of magic. Phoebe is the seductress, having the most active love life of the sisters.
    -   The Stillman Sisters, evil blonde counterparts in season 6. Leader Mabel is the wife, ditzy youngest sister Mitsy is the child and flirty and provocative Margo is the seductress.
-   _The Haunting of Hill House (2018)_, The three Crain daughters:
    -   Shirley is the mother, as the oldest sister who is also literally married with kids and is put in the position of looking after her younger siblings such as paying for Luke's rehab;
    -   Theo is the seductress, as the highly sexual lesbian who sleeps around on a nightly basis but refuses to form any longterm relationships;
    -   Nell is the child. Although she's already been married (and widowed), she remains extremely vulnerable, gentle, and sweet
-   In _Saved by the Bell_ the three female leads qualify. Kelly is the Child; she's portrayed as kind to everyone and often too naive for her own good. Jessie is the Wife; she's the student council president and the most mature of the main characters. Lisa is the Seductress; as she herself puts it "my hobbies include dating, guys and dating guys".
-   Overlapping with Town Girls, the three leading ladies of _Dawson's Creek_ fit into this trope. Joey, the Brainy Brunette **Wife**, starts out as the Girl Next Door; Jen, the blonde **Seductress** who Really Gets Around, arrives in Capeside as the Inciting Incident that kicks the show off; and Andie, the Cute But Psycho **Child**, arrives at the start of the next season, becoming the first of three characters to join the opening credits (alongside her brother Jack and her own Suspiciously Similar Substitute Audrey).
-   Played With in _Kamen Rider Gotchard_ with the three Dark Sisters.
    -   Atropos is the Child appearance-wise yet is the Wife personality-wise, as she resembles a literal child yet is the collected, intelligent leader of the trio.

    -   Lachesis is the Seductress both in appearance and personality, as she's the most conventionally attractive of the three and has a sadistic Femme Fatale personality.

    Music 

-   The three main female muses in Eminem's music are his abusive, slutty, pill-crazed, litigious and overly enmeshed mother Debbie (a dark version of the Wife), his abusive, slutty, coke-crazed, emotionally unstable and serial cheat wife/ex-wife/wife/ex-wife Kim (a dark version of the Seductress), and his daughter Hailie, the light of his life who occasionally shows up on his tracks to provide kiddie vocals and chainsaw noises and represents everything good in his life (the Child).

    Myths and Religion 

-   As this academic thesis proposes, the Three Faces of Eve are at the core of the Western, Judaist-Christian view of womanhood. Following several ancient texts from these religions, a woman's identity can be split into either a virgin, a mother, or a harlot (whore). The virgin represents the war between the carnal desires of the earthly body and the fated-to-Heaven soul. She also comprises the relationships of a woman's self with her body and also with the world. The mother breaks her virginity, in the process becoming less holy and suffering a great deal, but for a greater, idealized end — ensuring children make it to adulthood. Finally, the harlot is the woman that deviates from the norm both sexually and morally. Within her is the potential of both sin and redemption. She challenges the virgin by allowing herself to be lost in her carnal desires and challenges the mother by doing so without the idea of bearing children as the ultimate goal. The harlot, however, can still obtain sanctity and her path is portrayed as even more miraculous and heroic.
-   In Greek Mythology, the Gorgon Sisters make for an interesting variation. While all three are attractive in their own right, Stheno (Seductress) was the eldest, dominating and most violent sister. Medusa (Wife) was the youngest, yet was the most clever and kept her sisters united. Lastly was Euryale (Child) who was the most sensitive yet mysterious (since theres not much about her), her howls could shatter stone and she cared for Medusa a lot.

    -   Margo is the sly, hot-headed, scheming seductress.
    -   Bubbly and bubble-brained Lu Ann is the child.

-   _Oklahoma!_: Aunt Eller, the wise, no-nonsense matriarch, fulfills the Wife role. Ado Annie is the Seductress. Laurie is the Child who can't make up her mind about Curly and denies her feelings.
-   In _Grease_, Sandy is the wholesome and "hopelessly devoted" Wife, Rizzo is definitely the Seductress, and Frenchie (or any of the other Pink Ladies) is the Child.
-   Robert's three girlfriends in _Company (Sondheim)_ who sing "You Could Drive a Person Crazy." April is the ditzy Child, Marta is the bawdy Seductress, and Kathy is the most "Wife material" of the trio.
-   _Avenue Q_ has Christmas Eve as the Wife, secretly wise about love and devoted to Brian. Kate Monster is the Child, sweet and still figuring herself out. Lucy the Slut is...take a guess.
-   _Fun Home_ is an interesting case where the three faces of Eve are the same woman: Small Alison is the Child, Medium Alison is the Seductress exploring her sexuality, and Alison is the experienced and reflective Wife.

    Video Games 

-   _Final Fantasy_ games, in general, have a pattern to their three playable females (and there are always three; see the Three Females Rule in the Grand List) are almost always represented as an Innocent Princess type, a Tough but Sexy Type, and a Perky Girl type. Occasionally this overlaps with the faces of Eve archetypes, although often times the Tough but Sexy character is not a seductress but more passively sexy.
    -   _Final Fantasy IV_ does a similar trick to the later _VII_ in that it reverses the appearance and character of two of the girls. Rosa is pure Wife/Innocent Princess whose main desire is to be helpful, and who marries Cecil at the end. But Rydia looks sexy but is in personality the Perky Girl; Porom is a child, but hits people to keep them in line and is extremely clever and dangerous (being a brilliant mage and a spy).
    -   _Final Fantasy V_:
        -   Lenna, the wife/innocent princess. Her main plots are about her family, specifically her quest to rescue her father, her backstory about her mother, and her connection to drakes, for which she will harm herself to any extent to protect.
        -   Faris, the seductress/tough but sexy girl. She's a pirate who is shown as being sexually irresistible even when dressed as a man and passing, with most of her crew having crushes on her. She also tries to kidnap the princess for ransom money and climbs up rope bridges with her teeth.
        -   Krile is the child, fourteen and has supernatural sensitivity coming from her innocence. However, she's very much _not_ perky, with the end of the game revealing her to be actively suicidal once her desire for revenge isn't sustaining her. (She does get one comic setpiece where she gets into a slap-fight with Bartz, though.)
    -   _Final Fantasy VI_:
        -   Terra is the wife/innocent princess type - despite being the least stable of the three, she's the sweetest and most compassionate, and pretty level-headed regarding her role in the story. No wonder her name means "earth".
        -   Celes is the seductress/tough but sexy type - she's a Tsundere in her romance with Locke, and she's also the tough one, being a war general.
        -   Relm is the child/perky type - Strago didn't even want her to be involved in any combat at first because of this. She's precocious and optimistic.
    -   _Final Fantasy VII_ has an interesting version of this. For starters, one of the three women is an Optional Party Member, and secondly, the two who weren't looked like they played one role, but in fact, were the opposite:
        -   Tifa, who looks the part of the seductress, is in fact most reasonable and sensitive — also the secret-keeper of the group (her last name, Lockheart foreshadows this).
        -   Aerith, who looks the part of the demure wife, is in fact flirty, street-wise, and the most assertive in her sexuality.
        -   Yuffie (the optional one) both looks and acts like the child and is naïve and idealistic (if not particularly honest or trustworthy).
    -   _Final Fantasy VIII_ uses these archetypes, but much more loosely than anything before (and most after), suiting the game's approach of using more psychologically realistic characters:
        -   Rinoa is the wife and introduced with the nickname 'Princess'. Unlike the typical portrayal, she's quite bratty and selfish, but like the typical portrayal she has pure, supernatural powers, and tries hard to bring out the main character's better nature (and even succeeds, sometimes).
        -   Quistis is the seductress. She is experienced and in a position of authority, has a highly mature appearance compared to the other characters, flirts with the main character and fights using a whip. Her apparent maturity is Deconstructed in that she was a prodigy who had achieved a high rank at 15, and she ends up sent back to her previous rank very early in the game due to her atrocious social and emotional skills, which repeatedly hobble her during the game.
        -   Selphie is the child, her clearly high intelligence doing little to dampen her relentless enthusiasm and short attention span. Unlike the typical example, she's something of a Deadpan Snarker Nightmare Fetishist
    -   _Final Fantasy X_:
        -   Yuna is in the wife role, being unerringly calm and lives to helps others, self-sacrificing, soft-spoken, and graceful.
        -   Lulu is in the seductress role, most obviously in how she dresses, the tone she uses when she speaks, and how she holds herself and moves around in her battle animations.
        -   Rikku is in the child role, the fact that she is the youngest is exaggerated by her consistently upbeat personality, her sweet but shortsighted convictions, and her occasional ditziness.
    -   _Final Fantasy XII_:
        -   Ashe is more or less in the wife role. She's calm, steady, graceful, and downright regal (as befits her status as a princess). Unusually for a Final Fantasy party member, she's actually been married, too... though she was widowed soon after. However, she's haughty, vengeful, and morally questionable.
        -   Fran's Stripperiffic outfit makes it obvious she's the seductress. Being an extremely tall non-human prone to berserker rages helps.
        -   Penelo is the child, being cheerful, idealistic, and the youngest of the three.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII_ has this in its three female party members.
        -   Lightning (believe it or not) plays the part of the wife. She's the most motherly and caring of the group — particularly towards Hope and (much later) Snow. She is also said to have acted this way around Serah.
        -   Fang plays the role of the seductress; she is the most flirty and provocative of the group, and is quite Hot-Blooded at times. Interestingly, these aspects of her personality originally belonged to Lightning (with Serah as the seventh party member and playing the part of the wife), but when Fang was made a woman, they were given to her instead.
        -   Vanille is usually very bubbly and other characters will comment (or complain) about her childishness. Vanille is actually putting a lot of that behavior up as a facade to hide her guilt, but genuinely is like this otherwise.
    -   _Final Fantasy XV_ is more complicated; it has an all-male main cast where The Hero's three friends fill these archetypes - Prompto is childish and hyper, Ignis is domestic and nurturing, and Gladio is mean and sexy, with a hyper-gendered appearance and revealing outfit. Its prominent female side characters fold into this archetype too - Cindy and Iris are perky and childish, Aranea and Gentiana are seductive, experienced, and dangerous, and Luna is Incorruptible Pure Pureness and so much a 'wife' that she is literally the hero's fiancée.
-   BioWare is fond of using this trope for the female love interests in its RPGs.
    -   In _Baldur's Gate II_. Sweet Aerie is the Child, no-nonsense world-weary widowed Jaheira the wife, and darkly playful Viconia the seductress.
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins_:
        -   Child - Leliana is on the ingenuous side of Ping Pong Naïveté. She had been drawn into espionage and political intrigue by the sense of glamor, excitement, adventure, and it wasn't until after she was burned by the shady side that she realized she had relied on Marjolaine to shelter her from that so she could continue to innocently play games. Instead of becoming the jaded manipulative spy, she chose to preserve her purity of spirit by seeking sanctuary with a stable and nurturing parental surrogate, the Church of Andraste.
        -   Seductress - Morrigan is cynical, instantly contemptive of others, knows her sex appeal and how to use it to her advantage. Before the end, she will try to seduce a Warden to get what she wants, whether or not that Warden has ever shown interest in intimacy with her, or even likes her at all.
        -   Wife - Wynne is cool-headed, perceptive, compassionate, and far more worldly wise than the confined life of a Tower Mage would suggest. She's no stranger to giving and receiving pleasure in her relationships. Modest and pragmatic, but not overly prim, she simply flirts with more decorum.
    -   The three female companions in _Dragon Age II_:
        -   Child - Merrill is a Ditzy Genius Fish out of Water and your most relentlessly cheery teammate. Of course, she's _also_ a powerful blood mage and the only party mage to focus entirely on damage. She looks up to the more worldly Isabela (see below).
        -   Wife - Aveline is the only character to start the story married (although she is quickly widowed), and the only character almost guaranteed to end in a relationship. She's wise, honest, caring, no-nonsense, and a capable leader; she takes her responsibilities as captain of the city guard seriously and strives very hard to keep the men and women under her as safe as possible.
        -   Seductress - Isabela flirts with everyone and makes no bones about her love of sex and no attempt to hide her past sexual exploits. She is the most provocatively dressed member of the party, and offers to teach Merrill how to do body-shots.
    -   The three female companions in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_:
        -   Child - Sera is playful, brash, confrontational, and acerbic young woman whose personality lies someone who has problems dealing with her racial and cultural identity and suffered from a lot of people who let her down when it mattered the most. Thus she deals with all of her issues by lashing out onto others and delivering her strange brand of justice. Regardless of her flaws, she genuinely wants to help others, especially to other people who don't fit to what the society expects from them.
        -   Wife - Cassandra is quick-tempered, no-nonsense, honest, responsible, and forthcoming individual who always wants to do the right thing despite her and her organization's faults.
        -   Seductress - Vivienne is a stoic, cunning, and ambitious go-getter who will not hesitate to go underhanded to get into the highest echelons of the society, including becoming a mistress of a duke just to keep herself away from the oppression other mages face.
-   In _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_ by Obsidian, we have the naive Handmaiden as the child, saucy Mira as the seductress, and self-sacrificing Visas as the Wife.
-   The Women Fighters Team from _The King of Fighters_ has the half-naked kunoichi **Mai** as the seductress, hyperactive karateka **Yuri** as the Child and tomboyish kickboxer **King** as the wife.
    -   The Highschool Girls team from KOF 2003 had Athena Asamiya as the Wife (more experienced membress, leader of the group, Idol Singer who sings to keep the spirits of her fans high no matter what), Hinako Shinjou as the Child (naive sweet Cute Bruiser who wants to show how girls can do what they wish) and Malin as the Seductress (Combat Pragmatist, outspoken, veeeeery short Magic Skirt)
    -   Alternatively, in KOF 96 and KOF 97 there are some changes to the Women's Team's roster and they fit in here as well. KOF 96 has Kasumi Todoh replacing Yuri as the Child, and in KOF 97 Chizuru Kagura becomes a secondary Wife.
-   _Persona_:
    -   _Persona 3_ has Aigis as the Child — guiding the plot without knowing why — Elizabeth as the Wife — providing guidance and Side Quests to help the hero grow stronger — and as the seductress, the Big Bad Nyx, who's trying to bring about The End of the World as We Know It through coaxing humanity across the Despair Event Horizon. Her main male underling is a shameless flirt.
    -   _Persona 4_ also has its own trio of girls (before Naoto joins in), which are Yukiko (quiet, delicate, and responsible wife), Chie (spunky, impulsive, and tomboyish child), and Rise (playful, cheery, and naive seductress). If we use the description from the Final Fantasy example, it also fits their shadows too in that Yukiko's shadow is The Innocent Virgin Princess (literally, complete with castle, pink dress, knights and all), Chie's shadow is Tough But Sexy (how else could you describe a dominatrix?), and Rise's shadow being The Perky Jailbait (to the point of squick, and even the main character's second homeroom teacher, a notorious bully, refers to her as such, not even caring about the dark side of fame).
    -   The Phantom Thieves from _Persona 5_ (before Haru joins in) have Ann as the **Seductress** — being the middle, she uses her appearance to seduce the enemies, Makoto as the **Wife** — being the oldest, she's responsible for taking others well-being and Futaba as the **Child** — being the youngest, she's smart. But, doesn't know the outside world.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games_, the three Oracles (shown in the page image) are Din, an outgoing dancer (seductress); Nayru, a gentle singer (wife); and Farore, a helpful intellectual (child). Unfortunately, the game which was supposed to feature Farore was cancelled. Incidentally, the Oracles share their names with a trio of goddesses in the series mythology (the goddesses of power, wisdom, and courage, respectively), but we don't know enough about them to know if they match the trope.

-   _Tales Series_:
    -   In _Tales of Symphonia_, there's the painfully sheltered and fragile Colette (Child), Busty Action Girl Sheena (Seductress) and No-nonsense scholar Raine (Wife).
    -   In _Tales of the Abyss_ there is an interesting twist on it; Tear is the Wife (if somewhat cold) due to her nurturing aspects and status as the Love Interest to The Hero, but the Token Mini-Moe Anise is the Seductress with her flirting and Bitch in Sheep's Clothing tendencies, while Natalia is the Child through her Idiot Ball moments and naiveté compared to the other two (not to mention her main goal in life revolves around a Childhood Marriage Promise).
    -   In _Tales of Vesperia_, you have Estelle (Innocent Virgin Princess), Judith (Tough But Sexy), and Patti (Cute Bruiser).
-   The DS update of _Dragon Quest V_ gives the hero three brides to choose from: Bianca (the child), Nera (the Wife), and Debora (the seductress).
-   In _Fire Emblem_:
    -   The Pegasus Knight sisters from _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_. The Wife is the eldest sister Fiora (who even tends to be overprotective and strict), middle sister Farina is The Seductress (strongwilled, materialistic, yet with a hidden gentle side) and the Child is little sister Florina (Shrinking Violet)
    -   All of the girls that can potentially be fathered by Chrom count as this in _Fire Emblem: Awakening_: Patient and serious Lucina is the wife, strong-willed and rough Kjelle the seductress, and clumsy, innocent Cynthia the child. Heck, even Chrom's wife choices themselves can be this: Robin and Maribelle (wife), Sully (seductress), and Sumia and Olivia (child).
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_:
        -   Present with the Nohrian princesses. Flirtatious Camilla is the seductress (with some heavy touches of Wife since she's also very protective of her siblings and the Team Mom of Nohr), cheerful and energetic Elise is the child, and melancholy but compassionate Azura is the Wife. The Hoshidan princesses fit this as well; Azura is the wife again, sweet and shy Sakura is the child, and fiery and independent Hinoka is the seductress.
        -   The three action girls who serve under the male lords fit as well: Takumi's motherly and skilled at sewing subordinate Oboro is the Wife, Ryoma's no-nonsense and busty subordinate Kagerou is the seductress, and Xander's Cute and Psycho subordinate Peri is the Child.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ follows the pattern with the three female characters from the Blue Lions. Mercedes is the wife, being the resident healer and having the caring personality to match, as well as being one of the older students in general giving her a motherly feel. Ingrid is the seductress, being a hot headed, spunky knight in training who gets angry when other characters suggest she should pursue a more 'traditional' lifestyle for a woman. And Annette, as one of the youngest students as well as one of the most innocent is the child.
-   Regarding the mistresses of _Overlord II_: Kelda would serve as the child (least evil of the Mistresses and the only one to actually love The Witch-Boy), Juno the seductress (Gold Digger) and Queen Fay is the Wife figure (the one most "Equal" to the Witch-Boy).
-   The NOL girls of _BlazBlue_. Noel is shy, innocent and idealistic (the Child), Tsubaki is level-headed and academic (the Wife), and Makoto is the most blatantly fanservicey (the Seductress).
    -   The past arc in the Magic Guild girls too: Caelica the bright younger sister girl, Trinity the sensible, if bookish one, and Nine the fiery and buxom one.
-   The three playable women in _Breath of Fire II_:
    -   Child - Katt's personality is up-beat, innocent, impulsive, and a little bit dim.
    -   Seductress - Bleu is the overtly mature one with flirty dialog and a stripperiffic costume.
    -   Wife - Nina is the favored love interest for the protagonist, she is often the voice of reason and is compassionate and graceful, as well as a being bit maternal towards her younger sister.
-   The ladies of _Chrono Trigger_ fit this trope.
    -   Marle is the child, maintaining her naivety and innocence through most of the game.
    -   Lucca is the wife, smart and sensible and always the voice of reason.
    -   Ayla is the seductress, flirting with both Crono and Kino, a kiss ability, as well as wearing the least amount of clothes.

-   The ladies of _The Witcher_.
    -   Child: Ciri, Geralt's Unexpected Child, has a playful and innocent relationship with Geralt. She inspires a lightness in him that he displays with no one else, including getting Geralt to have a snowball fight.
    -   Seductress/ Wife: This depends on which romance track you pursue in the game.
        -   If you pursue Triss, she is very loving and kind with Geralt, constantly joking with him and encouraging him to support the magical and non-human under dog. If you don't pursue Triss, she clearly carries a flame for Geralt and is jealous of his relationship with Yennefer.
        -   If you pursue Yennifer, she is very teasingly snarky and quick to seize any opportunity to make love. If you don't pursue her, she's very cold towards Geralt because she is in love with him and it hurts her to see him with Triss, who Yennefer views as having stolen her one true love.
-   _Mega Man X_ has the three Navigator girls: Alia is the wise and temperate Wife, Pallette is the youthful and spunky Child, and Layer is the elegant and buxom Seductress (albeit more demure than other examples).
-   _Metal Gear_ tends to use the 'sexy' role as a template for a sympathetic villain, the 'wife' role as a mission support (who usually turns out to be attempting to backstab the hero) and the 'child' role as a hostage or damsel.
    -   The three women who fall in love with Solid Snake in _Metal Gear Solid_ fit - Meryl, a naive but beautiful teenager with a Celeb Crush on the famous Snake; Sniper Wolf, a sexy Stalker with a Crush who falls in love with Snake due to him being her Worthy Opponent and declares herself to be The Only One Allowed to Defeat You, and Naomi Hunter, who is (in this appearance) prim and mature, and is Snake's main emotional and medical support as well as the woman who repeatedly challenges him about his actual personality and motivations. Even once it is revealed she is trying to stab him in the back, the story remains sympathetic towards her.
    -   _Metal Gear: Ghost Babel_ has the mature and straight-talking Chris Jenner, the brooding, sexy and passionate Sophie N'dram, and the cheery, mid-teens Mei Ling.
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_ has Emma, a Deadpan Snarker teen prodigy and Otacon's little sister; Rose, who is Raiden's girlfriend attempting to get him to take their relationship more seriously; and Olga, who is cunning, vengeful, and attempts to seduce Solid Snake to distract him during his holdup of her.
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ has EVA, who is a clear Seductress, The Boss, who is motherly and described as Snake's other half, and Para-Medic, who is still in her twenties, goofy, and obsessed with cool movie monsters. It is worth observing that Para-Medic and Snake come across as being relative equals, something done deliberately to emphasise Snake's Manchild personality.
    -   In _Metal Gear Solid V_, Paz has a childish appearance and believes herself to be a teenager; Quiet is sexy and monstrous; and your third female character is the voice of the iDroid.
-   The Updated Re-release of _Catherine_ adds a Third-Option Love Interest to the cast, resulting in this dynamic between Katherine McBride (wife), Catherine (seductress), and Quathrine/"Rin" (child).
-   The three playable female characters in _Resident Evil 2_ fit these roles, fittingly it is Leon's Coming of Age Story, which is more explicit in the Remake. Claire is the wife being the determined, opposite of him saving Sherry, she even asks them if they are a couple in the remakes ending. Ada is the seductress, who he doesn't know what her intentions are while she seduces him for her own ends. Sherry is easily the child, her segment even takes place in an orphanage and she says Claire and Leon should adopt her.
-   The three female companions of _Fallout 4_ fit this trope too. Curie the synth is very childlike and innocent as she is experiencing the world for the first time, having been cooped up in a vault for centuries. The streetwise Piper is The Wife, constantly pushing you to help the wasteland, while Cait is the drug-addicted former cage fighter who constantly flirts with you and even likes it if you fast travel in your underclothes.
-   The three main female characters of _Telling Lies_ fit this trope: Ava is the child, Emma is the wife, and the camgirl is the seductress.
-   The three female Legends of _Apex Legends_ that were later added fit the bill: We have kind but capable, Wattson (Child) who believes in the good in people. Smooth-talking and overtly sexual Thief, Loba (Seductress). With inquisitive, experimental yet equally compassionate Astro scientist, Horizon (Wife) completing the trio. (She even was a real mother.)
    -   Later additions added:
        -   Valkyrie (Seductress) is a spunky, youthful aerial specialist with slim features and tomboyish nature (she has a crush on Loba).
        -   Ash (Wife) the no-nonsense former pilot, who expects perfection in everything and everyone. She's cold but fair, like a tough mother usually is.
        -   Vantage (Child) a whole-heartedly curious sniper, who competes to free and find justice for her mother.
-   The three iconic leading ladies of _Mario_, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, and Cosmic Ruler Rosalina fill these roles in a child-friendly way.
    -   Peach is the _Child_. She's the sweetest and kindest of all the characters in the franchise. She's very prim and proper and kind as a princess should be.
    -   Daisy is the _Seductress_. She's feminine just like Peach, but she's _much_ sassier and has a deeper more brash voice. She's not exactly sexualized or seductive, but she's the most outgoing and energetic.
    -   Rosalina is the _Wife_. She's the only character to be an outright mother, serving as the mother to the Lumas, and faithfully guarding the cosmos with incredible regality and formality. Though she has some Hidden Depths, she's the most mature of the female characters.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Fate/stay night_ has Ilya as the Child (acts very precocious and is literally stuck in a child's body), Arturia as the Wife (partner to The Hero and eventually enters into a relationship with him), while both Rin and Sakura have different aspects of the Seductress (Rin is virginal yet very headstrong and independent, while Sakura is sexually experienced even if NOT by choice but emotionally dependent).
    -   An alternative interpretation focusing on the heroines: Saber is the Child, unused to personal relationships and clinging to a childish ideal. Rin is the Seductress, competent and fiery but also insecure. Sakura is the Wife, sexually experienced and dedicated to the happiness of Shirou above her own.
-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_ is the first game in the series with every assistant character from the series, who fill this. Hot-blooded Athena is the seductress, matured and had a _Promotion to Parent_ Maya is the wife, while young and innocent Trucy is the child. Ema is the only assistant who doesn't fit in the grouping.
-   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_ has a subtle version this with Kyoko, Toko and Asahina - Ultimate Detective Kyoko is the Wife, though more aloof and cold than the usual, Ultimate Writer Toko is the Seductress, though she's also withdrawn and with a Split Personality and Ultimate Swimmer Asahina who is the most physically-oriented of the three is the Child.

     Webcomics 

-   _Megan Kearney's Beauty and the Beast_: Virtue is, or was the Seductress: before becoming poor, she was very wooed by noblemen and good in flirting. Soon after her family moved to the country, she was wooed by Claude and married him. Temperance is the Wife: mature, intelligent, practical and frequently the most rational in the family. Beauty is the Child, sensitive and (initially)innocent; Virtue calls her "the baby" and their father says she is "the heart of the house".

     Web Videos 

-   The three female adventurers of _Critical Role_ neatly fit into this.
    -   Pike is the Wife, being motherly patient and calm. She looks after Grog and keeps him in line while reacting modestly and shyly to Scanlan’s infatuation with her.
    -   Vex'ahlia is effortlessly the Seductress, being flirtatious to a T and having slept with at least one male member of the party Percy and flashed her breasts to Grog to encourage him in a tournament.
    -   Keyleth is the Child, being often naive, clumsy and incredibly awkward. She also spends a lot of time actively figuring out what she wants and who she likes much like a kid does.
-   In _Dimension 20_ the three female leads of _Fantasy High_ have this going on though it gets Played With over time.
    -   Kristen starts off as the Wife, being the most openly caring of the team, the healer and very pious being the cleric (though she gets disillusioned).
    -   Figg is initially the Seductress being the most flirty and wild of the Bad Kids and happy to transform into grown women to get kisses from men.
    -   Adaine is the Child, being often petulant and happy to resort to crude spells against her older sister and even gives the Arc Villain of Season 1 a double flip off. She’s also incredibly anxious thanks to a nervous disorder and has to be looked after by her friends when panicking.
        -   Eventually Kristen and Figg swap places as the Wife and Seductress. Kristen becomes sexually active and horny with her girlfriend Tracker whilst Figg (despite her claims to the contrary) is The Heart always looking after other members of the party like Gorgug, Riz and Adaine.

    Western Animation 

-   _Drawn Together_:
    -   Princess Clara is the sweet, mature, caring Wife (at least on the surface level).
    -   Foxxy Love is the sexy, sassy, promiscuous Seductress.
    -   Toot Braunstein is the hot-headed, loud-mouthed, food-obsessed Child.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_:
    -   Nazz is the Wife: She is sweet, responsible and usually one of the more level-headed of the kids.
    -   Sarah is the Child: A hot-tempered Bratty Half-Pint.
    -   The Kanker Sisters are the Seductresses: Romantic abhorrent admirerers who lust after the Eds.
-   The Eds themselves could qualify as a gender-inverted example:
    -   Ed is the ditzy childish one.
    -   Edd/Double D is responsible, mature and the one who acts most like an adult.
    -   Eddy is the charming Casanova Wannabe.

-   The Dangerous Ladies on _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: The leader Azula is a Manipulative Bitch (seductress); Ty Lee is the sweet, affectionate, giggling Cloudcuckoolander (innocent); and Mai is eternally cool, calm, and collected _and_ the only one in a committed relationship (wife).
    -   Though "The Beach" actually muddles this a bit: while Azula can be brash and independent, she's actually really _bad_ at flirting with guys. Ty Lee, meanwhile, is a bit of an (ambiguously) Innocent Fanservice Girl.

-   _Bob's Burgers_: The Belcher women are a textbook example.
    -   Louise Belcher, appropriately enough, is the child whose only concerns are playing pranks and roughhousing, and considers anything romantic and maternal "Sick!"
    -   Tina Belcher, despite her young age, is the seductress, as a boy-crazy, erotic fanfic novelist, and barely-qualifying Covert Pervert for locker room towel sizes and measurements.
    -   Linda Belcher, naturally, is the wife, maternal, nurturing, forgiving and obsessed with anything baby-related (porcelain babies, Dutch babies, lil’ water bottles, etc).
-   _The Real Ghostbusters_ contains another Gender-Inverted Example: The playful, jovial, energetic, child-like Ray, who shows little to no interest in women outside of grinning and blushing like mad around his old childhood crush, is the innocent; Peter, at the opposite end of the spectrum, is an incurable skirt-chaser and Casanova Wannabe; and the stoic, levelheaded, reliable Egon is the only one with a single, steady love interest.
-   _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_'s Birds of Prey. Black Canary is the easiest to get a rise out of and has the hardest time acting on her feelings for Bats- innocent. Catwoman is the seductress (a given). Huntress, who's pretty reserved throughout the other two's bickering, is wife.
-   _Steven Universe: Future_: Each member of the Rose Quartz trio from "Rose Buds" represents one of the many masks the Crystal Gem Rose has worn in her life.
    -   Superfan Rose is the Child, the immature, silly, and excitable one who is always in awe of the wonders of organic life (or at least Steven).
    -   Shy Rose is the Wife, the wise, dignified, and emotionally mature one who knows what's going on better than anyone.
    -   Hippie Rose is the Seductress, who at least takes an interest in Pearl, saying in a sensual tone that "if I could have had a Pearl, I would've wanted her to be just like you" and offers Garnet a shoulder-massage in a flirty manner.
-   Even in the original _Steven Universe_ it can be said that the three main Crystal Gems somewhat fit this trope:
    -   Garnet is the true Wife archetype, being calmer, more mature, and generally more stable than the other two Crystal Gems. She's even a fusion of two Gems who are in a romantic relationship, with strong connotations of marriage.
    -   Amethyst is the Child, being the more fun-loving, tomboyish one who tends to be on the same emotional level as Steven. However, she occasionally takes the role of the Seductress, often goading others into hedonistic fun, and being quite flirty at times.
    -   Pearl appears to be the Wife, calm and competent and nurturing, and acting as the more immediate mother figure in Steven's life. However, she leans into the Seductress role on occasion, as she was in love with Rose Quartz, and while she generally is more mature than Amethyst she isn't above the occasional lapse in maturity and judgement, giving her some hints of the Child.
-   _Teenage Euthanasia_: Annie is the naïve and shy child, The Pollyanna who is the youngest member of the Fantasy Family. Trophy is the Seductress, being a very promiscuous Hard-Drinking Party Girl with a high sex drive. Baba is the Wife, who is a serious and strict matriarch who dressed like a babushka and used to come from literal The Old Country.
