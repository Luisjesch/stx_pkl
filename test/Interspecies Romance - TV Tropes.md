_"Put him down! Howard may be a duck, but you people are animals! He's my boyfriend!"_

A romance, sexual or otherwise, between two different species. Sometimes they are Humanoid Aliens, or they can be a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire and a human, two Funny Animals, or a Beast and Beauty couple. The type of species can diverge greatly, so long as they are different.

May include a moral about the Fantastic Racism version of inter-racial romances. Also may be Starcrossed Lovers. Anyone looking for more built in angst will make one of these a Mayfly–December Romance. In less realistic settings, can easily result in Half Human Hybrids, Hybrid Monsters, Non Human Humanoid Hybrids, or even Random Species Offsprings.

Chances of it actually becoming an Official Couple (and evolving into a mixed marriage) are increased if the nonhuman has a human form. Although there is an element of Squick amongst a certain number of audience members, most people accept it in cases where there are _no_ humans involved. If one of them _is_ human, and the other clearly _isn't_, expect a much larger portion of the audience to ignore all evidence that both are people, malign the consenting romance as something else, or for it to not happen at all. For anthropomorphic animals, this can be a source of Furry Confusion, especially if they're the _only_ couple seen to be of different species, or the only couple of radically different phenotype.

For some this is the way to go about First Contact. Alien invaders seemingly love to tempt humans with this as part of their Masquerade, although you'd think they'd learn better.

This is somewhat vague though, as a species is defined as a group of organisms that can mate and produce fertile offspring, so "interspecies" relationships that result in fertile offspring aren't interspecies relationships at all, because _by definition_ both parties are members of the same species.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

See also: Extreme Omnisexual, Boldly Coming, Bestiality Is Depraved, Mars Needs Women, Divine Date, Magical Girlfriend, Deus Sex Machina, Did You Just Romance Cthulhu?, Boy Meets Ghoul, Robosexual (for when the "species" barrier is a robot, AI, or other artificial lifeform), Robosexuals Are Creeps (for when the sexual or romantic attraction is portrayed as creepy), Hot Skitty-on-Wailord Action (for when you wonder how these two things could actually reproduce, or at least engage in activities that would lead to reproduction with members of their own species), Muggle–Mage Romance, Animal Sweet on Object, What Measure Is a Humanoid?, and Succubi and Incubi (who almost invariably have sexual interests that go beyond their own demonic species). Any romantic variant of Monster and the Maiden also qualifies here by default. May involve Exotic Equipment or the Male-to-Female Universal Adaptor. May lead to Half Human Hybrids or to a Non-Human Lover Reveal if one member was keeping secrets. If society does not approve of such romance, then it's also Maligned Mixed Marriage. Interspecies Friendship and Predator-Prey Friendship are the platonic versions of this trope. It may also involve Non-Standard Kissing. The offspring of the couple may be born in a Whale Egg or from a Pregnant Reptile.

A Gender Flip of this premise can be seen in HoneyWorks' "Chiisana Lion".

    Newspaper Comics

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Chicken Minute_, a canadian show from the 90s, featured Minute, a fox, being in love with Chicken Mama, a hen with whom he even lives.
-   _The Muppets_ has Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.
    
    **Kermit**: Me? In love with a pig? Wait 'til I tell the guys in marketing! Ha ha! Maybe you expected me to go HOG-wild? Perhaps you could bring home the BACON! Ahhh... the sounds of love, SU-EEEEE! Oink, oink.
    
    -   Also, Gonzo, whose species was unknown at the time but is now said to be some kind of alien has an attraction to birds, especially chickens, and in one case, a cow.
    -   Also, in one episode he was infatuated with Madeline Khan, a human.
    -   And in the cartoon spin-off, _Muppet Babies (1984)_, he's in love with Piggy. Camilla, is, alas, just a stuffed toy in that version.
    -   _The Muppets Take Manhattan_ contained this exchange:
        
        **Brooke Shields**: Is something wrong?  
        **Masterson Rat**: Do you believe in interspecies dating?  
        **Brooke Shields**: Well, I've dated some rats before, if that's what you mean.
        
    -   It got weirder in _Muppet Treasure Island_. Benjamina Gunn (Miss Piggy) apparently had relationships with the humans Captain Flint _and_ Long John Silver, the former of whom abandoned her on the island after their relationship ended. Her former fiance Captain Smollett (Kermit) seemed disturbed by this revelation, but it may have been more because of her promiscuity than the interspecies aspect.
    -   Piggy's been known to throw herself at hunky male humans on _The Muppet Show_ before. Christopher Reeve comes to mind. Also Patrick Wilson, drummer for Weezer, in the "Keep Fishing" video. Neither one reciprocated.
        -   Charles Grodin, however, was quite enamoured with her in _The Great Muppet Caper_. As was John Ritter in _The Fantastic Miss Piggy Show_.
    -   In the 2015 series _The Muppets_, Kermit and Piggy have split up, and Kermit is dating another pig named Denise, who works in marketing. Miss Piggy meanwhile, is again attaching herself to human guest stars. And Fozzie has a human girlfriend whose parents are a bit freaked out.

-   _Bleak Expectations_: Considered, though mercifully never attempted, by Mister Benevolent and Harry Biscuit in regards to Juanita Hotchille, a Spicy Latina who has wound up in the body of a dinosaur, which has done nothing to decrease her sex-appeal.
    
    **Mr. Benevolent**: She's a Dinosaur. Wouldn't it be wrong?  
    **Harry Biscuit**: I've asked myself the same thing.
    

    Roleplay 

-   The most prominent example from _AJCO_ is Clovis/Mei - the former being a Plant Person and the latter being an anthropomorphic zombie dog. It Makes Sense in Context.
    -   Egg and Kube's relationship probably qualifies, though it's not quite as obviously romantic as the above.
    -   While it's unconfirmed and seemingly one-sided Kaja and Crez also come under this trope — Kaja is a bizarre Angel and Crez is... Crez.
-   In Disney World of War there are several and the most prominant are Scatani, Scamp (dog) and Vitani (lioness) and Berlielle, Berlioz (cat) and Danielle (dog).
-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, Omaroch and Delora are a demon and a human who fall in love although such union is seen by many as blasphemy. The Land of the Living witnesses several intermarriages between different races, including elves, humans and dwarves among others, which result in children with mixed ancestry such as half-elves. Interspecies romance becomes a major plot point with nymphs who need males from other races to breed because a magical curse makes them only give birth to female nymphs; this causes them to have no males of their own to keep their population going so they need to seduce men from other races in order to become pregnant and stop the nymph race from becoming extinct.
-   _Solar Wind_ sees one of the (human) main characters fall in love with Tav, the series' alien protagonist.
-   Has happened sometimes in We Are All Pokémon Trainers. At some point there are romances between humans and _Legendaries_, such as Luke with Reshiram and Jane with Zekrom. (Both ended up breaking up though.) In a later case, Sierra's boyfriend Vyvyan is forcefully transformed into a Rayquaza.

-   _Creature From The Black Lagoon The Musical_: In this version Kay falls in love with the Creature.
-   _Seussical_ has Horton the Elephant and Gertrude McFuzz, a bird.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Adastra_ is centered around the gradual romance between the human college student Marco and Amicus, a prince who is not only an alien from the moon Adastra, but also a 7ft tall anthropomorphic wolf. In-Universe, Marco acknowledges to himself that falling for a talking wolf alien who abducted you is weird, but it doesn't stop him from falling in love with him. Amicus starts reciprocating once he finally comes out of the closet and the two are slated to eventually marry, as revealed by an omniscient entity.
    -   One of the main signs there's more than meets the eye with Cassius, Amicus' xenophobic Jerkass of a brother, are the heavy, **heavy** indicators that there's something stronger than just a master-servant relationship between him, a wolf, and the cat Alexios. By the end, it's all but stated that they're an Official Couple.
    -   The very empire of Adastra was able to thrive thanks to the love between the wolf Drusus and Meera, an Hindo (read, a tigress) and the latter's tragic sacrifice.
    -   Khemia, the jackal Neferu's birthplanet, is much more open to these relationships than wolven society. This reflects even too much in Neferu, as he goes after anything from wolves to humans and even cats.
    -   In the sequel _Khemia_, the wolven diplomat Scipio moved up in his career in great part due to how close he got to the jackal Neferu as a lover.
-   In _Amorous_, the player can customize their character's species. However, unless you manage to make your character a bizarre Eldritch Abomination who manages to be a parrot, a lion, a dog, a ram, a bunny, a dragon, a cat, a chameleon and a gecko all at the same time, you will eventually start an interspecies relationship within the dateable cast.
-   In _Cafe Enchante_, Kotone, a human, can become romantically involve with a demon, a fallen angel, a fairy and a firewolf.
-   In _Chijoku no Onna Kishi_, the protagonist, Orurogin, is an Orc who can pursue a relationship with several women of different species which includes two humans, two elves, a Cat Girl and a Demon Queen. Interestingly enough, any children he has with the women are the same race as their mother, regardless of gender.
-   _Cryptid Crush_ has a pretty self-explanatory title. The Visual Novel focuses on Token Human Robyn (name dependent on player) and their misadventures in a town full of Cryptids and, while not yet implemented as of the latest update, a sizeable chunk of this monstrous cast will be dateable by our human protagonist: the mothman Atlas, the ghost Mike, the werewolf August, the Jersey Devil Jamie and the Loch Ness Monster Expy Tessie.
-   _Dra+Koi_ is a love story between a nameless protagonist and a dragon who similarly has no name. She picked him out as the one who would slay her, a choice he can reject.
-   _DRAMAtical Murder_ has one between Aoba and Clear, an android.
-   _Echo_ features multiple, being a World of Funny Animals and messy love lives:
    -   The otter Chase spent a lot of his teenagehood in a relationship with the wolf Leo. After their break-up, a quick browse through Leo's search history lets Chase know that Leo definitely has never stopped liking otters.
    -   Based on what route you choose, Chase the otter could try rekindling his romance with Leo, start feeling something for the ram Carl or the lynx TJ or even get to fourth base with the kit fox Jenna or the gila lizard Flynn. Some end with the possibility of a relationship in the far future, some end in a definite friendzone and others could end in mutilation, urbanicide or turning into a charred time-travelling monster, but none of these flings really go anywhere.
    -   The raccoon Kudzu used to have one with his bunny boyfriend before the latter was killed. In the Good Ending to Leo's route, he finds his Second Love in the otter Chase.
    -   In Jenna's route we find that the wolf Leo had a fling with the bat Micha at one point. the two become an Official Couple once Leo gets over Chase in Jenna's good ending.
    -   The ram James Hendricks I was secretly lovers with his business partner, the kit fox John Begay. James being James, it ended poorly.
    -   _Arches_ introduces us to the coyote Cameron and his boyfriend, the brown bear Devon.
-   _Far Beyond the World_ already starts off with the main cast in huge trouble due to the wolf Ranok smuggling the human Caelan in the xenophobic Wolven village, and it all becomes even more complicated for everyone when the two quickly start falling in love.
    -   When travelling to the Tiger-dominated town of Strandbard, Caelan finds out their society is much more open to relationships of this kind.
-   _Hatoful Boyfriend_ uses this for its deliberate Audience-Alienating Premise: it's a Dating Sim, like many others, where your character tries to romance cute guys. Only this time, replace "cute guys" with "photo-realistic birds".
    -   This trope is zig-zagged, to an extent. To help players identify with the characters, many of the birds have official artwork showing what they would look like if they were human (answer: Bishounen). There first game has the option to show these designs when each love interest is introduced, and said designs are also occasionally used in the sequel and various spinoff media. Regardless, it is made clear that the birds _really are birds_, and this is just a visual Translation Convention.
    -   This trope eventually turns out to be _enforced_. Because of political tensions between birds and humans after the birds' rise to sapience, the heroine has been sent to a birds-only school to test how closely humans and birds can interact. If she doesn't romance anybirdy, the experiment is considered a failure, and the Hawk Party condemns humanity to destruction, starting with the heroine.
-   The origins of the Furude family in _Higurashi: When They Cry_ stem from a marriage between a human and a demon (Hanyuu). Note: Hanyuu was older than the form seen in the 7th and 8th novels during said marriage.
-   _Minotaur Hotel_: Potentially you and Asterion can end up in one. Pedro and Oscar also flirt with the idea, but decide it's better for them to be friends for the time being.
-   Taken pretty seriously with _Kanon_ (between Yuuichi and Makoto who was originally a fox) and _CLANNAD_ (between Tomoya's landlady Misae and her first love "Katsuki" Shima... who was actually a cat with the form of his once owner), both by Key/Visual Arts. Both scenarios are demonstrated in rather emotional routes following the Beautiful All Along path, except... just replace _beautiful_ with _animal_.
-   _Lake Of Voices_ has Lu and the Guide as possible love interests. Both are Nixi, although it's known that Lu tends to keep his human appearance for most of the time.
-   The Queer Furry Visual Novel _Lyre_ narrates the (mis)adventures of the ambassador Lichter (or whatever name the reader gave him) in the titular kingdom. Great part of the story is about Lichter, a human, falling in love with the Captain of the Lyrian Royal Guards, the anthropomorphic wolf Lyall Reed. Unlike other Visual Novels in the genre, the fact it's a gay relationship isn't a huge issue for them, as the setting is more or less as accepting of same-sex relationships as the real life Western world; no, the problems arise from the fact that interspecies relationships are taboo in Lyre, especially when the difference in anatomy is as stark as between a wolf and a human. Of course, Lichter and Lyall need to add this scandal of theirs to their long list of problems in the story.
    -   The caracal Kadaj is also in a gay relationship and, while we don't know his boyfriend's species, we know it's an interspecies relationship too because the bigoted, gossipy aristocrats hold it against Kadaj, not that he cares.
    -   Before Richter, the wolf Lyall had the bear Edan for a boyfriend, but they had to end the relationship as Amicable Exes because of how much prejudice they faced.
-   _Magical Warrior Diamond Heart_ has two of Valerie's love interests be the cat fairy Diana and the Wolf Man Opal. Both of them are from the magical land of Chalcedonia and have the ability to take on human form.
-   _Morenatsu_ is a visual novel where you have the option to romance one of 9 different guys, all of whom happen to be anthropomorphic beast men. Since the protagonist is a human, any choice you make which leads to romance will be interspecies.
-   The Furry Sci-Fi Visual Novel _No More Future_ is set in a World of Funny Animals where apparently Interspecies relationships are the norm, as protagonist Isaac claims it's very rare for any two family members to be of the same species and, on-screen, we see Apollo and Daphne's parents seemed to have been a felid and a candid respectively and two patrons at the "Blue Cloth" are a green deer and a hyena looking longingly at one another. With all this said and done, this is actually a complicated subversion as whatever animal you look like in this universe is _not_ your actual species. Everyone is the same species: Yuumans (which are implied to be humans who all underwent mass transformation) and they just happen to all look like a different animal. in example, the aforementioned felid and canid copulated and gave birth to _a sheep and a human_.
    -   One actual example in the story could be Isaac and Natalie if Mary's Shipper on Deck teasing is successful, as the latter is a Labrador yuuman, while the former is a Synthetic, a yuuman who transferred their consciousness into an android body. However, while this would practically be an interspecies relationship, it wouldn't be one _morally_ since the main theme of the VN is that Isaac counts as a yuuman even in his new robotic body.
-   _Serre_ is a short yuri visual novel about the love story between Arlette, an awkward human gardener, and Oaxa, a somewhat ditzy bee-like alien woman.
-   "The Demon Lord in Another World" h-game VN is an inverse of the normal "isekai" trope in that its the female Demon Lord that gets transported to the modern world, where she ends up having to live with the nameable MC due to being unable to return back to her world, not that she's in a hurry to go back to it due to just how shitty it is, and she eventually falls in love with the human main character, marries him, and becomes pregnant with his child and looking forward to having another soon in her happy new life with him.

    -   One Q&A session has a human who is in an apparently mutual romantic relationship with an Eldar seeking the Emperor's blessing for the romance. The Emperor responds that this Eldar is essentially into bestiality, since the Eldar consider humans nothing more than animals. He then adds that such a relationship will probably lead to the Eldar contracting a bunch of STD's and spreading infections all over their Craftworld... therefore yes, the human has the Emperor's blessing.
-   In _Rainbow Dash Presents My Little Dashie_ Rainbow Dash (a pegasus) forms one with the monkey (and her adopted father's enemy) Jokermort.
