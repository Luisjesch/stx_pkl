**Irwin:** What if this kid's telling the truth? We can't have toys out on the market that may be dangerous.  
**Larry:** _\[lackadaisical\]_ How can they be dangerous? Everything on them is standard. The design is standard, the materials are standard... the mechanicals are standard. Even the... _\[sudden Oh, Crap! face\]_ Oh.  
**Irwin:** What's "Oh"?  
**Larry:** What?  
**Irwin:** You just said "Oh".  
**Larry:** No, I said "Oh!"  
**Irwin:** You mean "Oh" like, "That's interesting" or "Oh" like, "We're screwed"?  
**Larry:** No. I mean, "Hey! Whoa! Oh!". Look, forget the "Oh", all right? I'm going to go down to legal and get the ball rolling on the countersuit.  
**Irwin:** The chips! That's the "Oh"!

Bob has the situation under control, and is explaining it to his partner, Alice. While he initially thought everything was fine and going to plan, it's only once he stops to think about it and hears himself say it aloud that he realizes how much trouble he and Alice are really in.

Essentially, a case of in-universe Fridge Logic (or Fridge Horror) catching up to the characters, can be Played for Laughs or drama. Can be triggered by the listening party's Let Me Get This Straight... putting a new perspective on Bob's explanation.

The Oh, Crap! can also be simply that there _really is_ No Time to Explain. Some situations go further with this, having the feared event happen directly after it's realized, which is a case of Five-Second Foreshadowing.

The Placebo Eureka Moment is an inverse, in which the act of explaining leads to a solution rather just than a realization that there's a problem. Not to be confused with I Can Explain or Not Helping Your Case.

Compare Punch! Punch! Punch! Uh Oh..., You Answered Your Own Question, Delayed "Oh, Crap!" (when the character doesn't realize how screwed they are until after they're _done_ explaining), Digging Yourself Deeper (when a character's already in trouble and doesn't realise they're giving away more than they should until it's too late, upon which this trope swiftly applies), I Never Said It Was Poison (when the realization is that there's something previously told by another character that doesn't fit the facts _or_ make them fit all of a sudden), and Stopped Dead in Their Tracks (when this trope can result in a stunned stop reaction in another character).

-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: In episode 3 of _Great War in the Bizarre World_, when the Queen explains that Darton leaves a mark on all who are under his control, she caps it off saying it's hard to explain. Then an X-circle mark appears on her belly, and Slowy asks if that's the mark he leaves. The Queen says yes, and it takes a Double Take for her to realize what just happened; she's corrupted shortly afterwards.

-   In Chess, one of the methods for dealing with a speculative sacrifice by an opponent is known as the _show me_ method. If you can't see the point of the sacrifice, or even if you do see the point but don't think it will be all that effective, the recommended course of action is to accept it and continue playing natural moves, daring the opponent to show you their idea. Sometimes this works and the sacrifice fails. When it succeeds, however, you end up with this trope.

    He said, "Naw man, I like big, hard, throbbin' co-" (_extended Jaw Drop_) "...I did not know that about myself."

The man's name is Headdick (Dugland, a plausible name, but also an insulting term similar to "jackass") so they decide to appeal to the younger voters by using verlan (French slang that reverses syllable order), which would give... <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    "Forget it?"
    
    "Yeah."
    

They decide to look for a more suitable name in the man's family tree, settling on Beauregard (equivalent to "beautiful eyes"). Then they see a poster of the Comically Cross-Eyed candidate, and consider going back to the original plan.

    **Darcy:** I say... so when I phoned back to tell you it was all arranged and the Berlin Express left at seven, you assumed an op had come up and we'd have to skip the party. Which means...  
    **Cecil:** Yes, sir. We've gone a commando raid by mistake.
    

Fortunately their captor gloatingly mocks their attempts to raid a factory vital to the Third Reich's war efforts, accidentally giving them an objective.

Johnny points out this isn't possible, since the rest of the FF are elsewhere doing their own things, and more to the point have no reason to attack Spidey (something he really _should_ know).

-   _New Avengers (2015)_: Monica Rappaccini and Andrew Forson, former leaders of AIM, crash the funeral of Roberto Da Costa, using a specialized time-bubble. Forson notes that the only way to shield one's self from the time-bubble's effects would be in some sort of specially pre-prepared equipment which his scanners couldn't pick up, like if, say, they were hidden behind adamantium shielding... such as the adamantium in Da Costa's coffin. Surprise! It's a trap.

Her expression when this dawns on her says it all.
        
        **Cream:** Bad dolly! I'm trying to take care of you and find your owner, and you keep disappearing! ...Like at the Forget-Me-Knots concert. And this is just like what happened at the civic center...

-   As _Calvin and Hobbes_ indicates, Bill Watterson _loves_ this trope.
    -   One storyline had C&H pushing the family car out of the garage so they could use the structure as a clubhouse, only to discover that the driveway is on an incline, which sends the vehicle careening into a ditch across the street. After they run away, Calvin's mother notices the situation, and begins to wonder aloud:
        
        **Calvin's Mom:** And how on Earth did they go in straight backward? To do that, the car would have had to come...right...out...of...OUR DRIVEWAY!
        
    -   In another arc, the family goes to the zoo, and Calvin gets lost when he starts following a woman who looks like his mom. As Calvin's parents try to figure out where he's gone, Dad hits upon an idea—"Maybe Calvin's at the tiger pit, since he likes tigers so much." After walking a bit, he laughs to himself: "Ha ha, maybe Calvin's _in_ the tiger pit, since he likes tigers so much." He then realizes that that's a perfectly plausible scenario and breaks into a run.
    -   In one of the Transmrogrifier arcs, Calvin believes that he's been permanently transformed into an owl.

    -   At the beginning of one story arc, Calvin notices his mom has showered rather early in the day, and from that alone he quickly puts together a rather disturbing conclusion...
        
        **Calvin:** You're taking a shower _now_? That means you're going out tonight, right? And you haven't told _me_ to get cleaned up, so that means I'm staying home, right? And if I'm staying home, that means you've gotten me a babysitter, right? And that means you've probably hired _Rosalyn_, right?!?  
        **Calvin's Mom:** Brilliant, Holmes.  
        **Calvin:** _**AAAHHHHHH!**_
        
-   In one _Garfield_ strip, Jon demands to know what Garfield did with Mrs. Feeny's dog, along with a bunch of stamps, a box, and some twine...before pausing in shock as his mind begins to connect the dots.

He encounters one, only for him to turn out to be a friend of his that can become a humanoid animal based on what bites him. As they speak of other matters, the main character asks why he waited two days to meet him, only for the friend to reply that he arrived in the city just that morning. Cue both of them going Oh, Crap!—as the actual werewolf shows up.
-   A variation occurs in _Animorphs #16: The Warning_:
-   A rather charming one in _The Belgariad_ when Jeebers, an elderly personal tutor of her little Imperial Highness Ce'Nedra, explains to the heroes that the emperor has the utmost trust in him. Which is exactly why "the princess knocked on his door deep at night, revealing to him that he got tasked to help her to disguise herself, then sneak her out of the palace without anyone else noticing, and to then escort her (alone) across half the country" ...in a time when people are murdering each other in the streets due to all sorts of politics. Which is when he notices in sheer horror that the emperor had nothing to do with it and that this was all rebellious little Ce'Nedra's idea. Poor guy.
-   _The Canaris Fragments_ by Walter Winward takes place during the Nuremberg trials of 1945. The main characters have discovered that a group of SS men plans to liberate the prisoners and have had the courthouse surrounded by security, but then they start discussing why a group of SS men would go through so much trouble and realize that Kaltenbrenner, the only high-ranking SS member among the defendants, is not at the courthouse, but at a hospital at the other end of the city.
-   _The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump_: David's coworker Michael casts a spell to test if a sorcerer's flayed human skin substitute is being used for ritualistic purposes and it seems to exonerate the man. However, David quickly asks if the spell would have been ineffective if the "substitute" was real flayed human skin. Michael thoughtfully agrees that this would have nullified his test before horrifiedly realizing just where real flayed human skin would have come from and what it might be used for.
-   _The Caves of Steel_: When Lije and Daneel visit a premier roboticist, Lije asks him about Ridiculously Human Robots, how they would be different from humans, and how easy it is to spot them. The man starts to confidently say how unlikely it is, then pauses as he realizes that Daneel meets the signs he just described. The man is embarrassed that it took him so long to notice.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   _Jingo_:
        -   Vimes does one of these, when he works out how 71-Hour Ahmed got his name. The traditional Klatchian period of hospitality and protection is three days - 72 hours. What must you have had to do to be associated with a time just short of that period?
        -   When Vimes explains to Ahmed that he knows that the attempted assassination of the Klatch Prince wasn't arranged by the Klatchians themselves, but that it was a very bad frame-job, complete with an Orgy of Evidence and a lampshaded Foreign Money Is Proof of Guilt... and realizes mid-explanation it looked like such a bad frame job because the Klatchians deliberately made it look like they were being badly framed.
    -   In _Feet of Clay_, there are two major plot threads that the Watch are investigating. The first is a set of murders connected to the city's golem population (golems here being mostly magical beasts of burden). The second is repeated arsenic poisoning of Lord Vetinari. Vimes, Angua and Cheery discuss these at a late stage of the novel, and it becomes apparent that it's surprising they actually managed to track arsenic in any meaningful way. It gets used all over the city for all kinds of things—rat poisons, paints...
        
        **Vimes:** I'm surprised people aren't dropping dead of it all the time.  
        **Cheery:** Oh, most people use golems, sir—
        
    -   The same book also has an _I, Claudius_ style inversion: when the nobles and Guild leaders learn that the rumours about the heir to the throne being a watchman have somehow moved from Captain Carrot to Corporal Nobbs, they protest "But he's an absolute tit", and then start thinking about what an absolute tit as king might mean for the other powers in the city, namely them. They conclude that he'd probably make a great king, with the right advisors.
    -   In _Interesting Times_, Rincewind learns that the revolution was spurred by the contents of a book titled _What I Did On My Holidays_, and finds a spot to read it himself. He finds it just describes things he finds rather mundane, like sausages made from "genuine pig product", and is completely unimpressed, but realizes that the book was written by his old traveling companion from _The Colour of Magic_ and _The Light Fantastic_, Twoflower the tourist, and he went above and beyond painting Rincewind as a great hero and magus. Once again putting Rincewind in the hot seat, just like old times.
        
        Ha! Mister What-I-Did-On-My-Holidays should try coming to Ankh-Morpork next time, and see how much he liked one of old... Dibbler's sausages... full of genuine... pig product...

Frank and Joe look into it when Linda is kidnapped, eventually bringing Walter to a house...where it turns out Linda, Greg and Mike are setting Walter up to kill him in "self-defense" for his fortune and using the Hardys to sell the plot. Frank reveals he'd already figured this out thanks to the Orgy of Evidence making this case so easy and shows up with a detective ally. But it turns out this "detective" is Linda's real husband and Greg and Mike's dad. The family gloats on getting away with it all...until it hits Greg that Frank had just said he figured this whole thing out _before_ he came to the house. So if he knew this was a scam and "Dad wasn't a detective, why would he have trusted him to help?" They have five seconds to think about it before a couple of the Hardys' friends burst in to take Greg and Mike down just before the real cops arrive to arrest them all.
-   In the _Honor Harrington_ novel _At All Costs_, there's an internal version when Admiral Chin wonders about the strange maneuvers of the Manticoran force that just hypered in behind her. Over the course of several paragraphs of narration, it dawns on her exactly which formation she is looking at... and what they're armed with.
    
    _But if Third Fleet was what they'd just finished destroying, then these people had to be_ Eighth Fleet_, which meant Honor Harrington. And Harrington didn't do things that didn't make sense. So what—?  
    Her eyes opened wide in horror.  
    "General signal all units!" she shouted, spinning towards her com section. "Hyper out immediately! Repeat, hyper out—"  
    But it had taken Genevieve Chin two minutes too long to realize what was happening._
    
-   In _Mission: Levity_: "But how can there be gravity? The planet is too far away and there's nothing else there but that... ship..."
-   _Jeeves and Wooster:_ Bertie's friend Gussie talks about how he's been writing down insults about his prospective father-in-law and Roderick Spode in a notebook which he misplaced.
    
    **Gussie:** Have you ever heard Sir Watkyn Bassett dealing with a bowl of soup? It's not unlike the Scottish express going through a tunnel. Have you ever seen Spode eat asparagus?  
    **Bertie:** No.  
    **Gussie:** Revolting. It alters one's whole conception of Man as Nature's last word.  
    **Bertie:** Those were two of the things you wrote in the book?  
    **Gussie:** I gave them about half a page. They were just trivial, surface faults. The bulk of my researches went much deeper.  
    **Bertie:** I see. You spread yourself?  
    **Gussie:** Very much so.  
    **Bertie:** And it was all bright, snappy stuff?  
    **Gussie:** Every word of it.  
    **Bertie:** That's great. I mean to say, no chance of old Bassett being bored when he reads it.  
    **Gussie:** Reads it?  
    **Bertie:** Well, he's just as likely to find the book as anyone, isn't he?  
    **Gussie:** I never thought of that!  
    **Bertie:** Start now.
    
-   _Night Huntress_: Main character Leila has been bound to someone so that if either dies, the other dies, so a shadowy group abducts that person and threatens to kill Leila unless Vlad kills Mencheres. When Mencheres realizes that Vlad didn't tell him about this in case he ended up with no choice but to go through with it, he's naturally upset.
    
    **Mencheres:** You would have widowed Kira. You would have brought war between our two lines, forcing Bones into a fight against your people that would have resulted in many deaths. Our allies would have been forced to choose sides, too, bringing more death, until you could have shattered the peace we've had since Apollyon failed to incite a war between vampires and ghouls—  
    _\[cuts off as he, Vlad, Leila, and Veritas realize this_ was _the point of the whole thing\]_
    
-   _Ravelling Wrath_:
    
    **Rinn:** That couldn't be right, could it? She wasn't afraid, it was just a reaction, like when I'd first summoned a Blood Blade. She knew I wouldn't actually hurt her, right? I was just blowing off steam! And besides, she had looked way more scared when the Blood Blade thing happened! And then she'd gotten back under control right away, because she knew it was just me and I wouldn't hurt her! Obviously! So obviously, THIS time, maybe I did some stuff I shouldn't have, and she got scared, but then I started backing off, and then she was… still acting scared… because… that meant…  
    I had made her afraid of me.
    
-   In _Wizard's First Rule_, first book of the _Sword of Truth_ series, Zedd invokes this on a mob that's coming to burn him for being a witch.

    -   In _Fear in Fashion_, the kids' latest boss, Dee Dee, takes on a Cool Big Sis role with them, encouraging their dreams (like Richelle's modeling aspirations) and praising their talents. She is just buttering them up to be Unwitting Pawns in a con game. Richelle is hit especially hard when she observes the others (save Sunny, who was always a bit suspicious) lamenting how they were fooled and muses about how they were silly to be fooled and at least Dee Dee wasn't all bad due to recognizing Richelle's potential to be a model, only to halt mid-thought as she realizes Dee Dee was manipulating her the same as the others.
-   In _The Temp_, the director of a firm producing a floating oil rig asks the Temp what she thinks of the drawing of the design.

The second character launches into trying to explain that the fax machine first has to convert the scanned data into a "stream of electrons", before realizing that the first character is talking about the same for the wormhole with a big, "Oh shit!"
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: A comedic version in the Ciaphas Cain novel _The Traitor's Hand_. Cain is discussing Mauve Shirt "Jinxie" Penlan with the command staff when her reputation comes up, and...
    
    **Cain:** "But she's not nearly as accident prone as she's supposed to be. I'll grant you she fell down an ambull tunnel once, and there was that incident with the frag grenade and the latrine trench, but things tend to work out for her. The orks on Kastafore were as surprised as she was when the floor in the factory collapsed, and we'd have walked right into that hrud ambush on Skweki if she hadn't triggered the mine by chucking an empty food tin away..."  
    My brain finally caught up to what I was saying and I trailed off rather lamely. "Well, you know how soldiers exaggerate these things."
    
    -   In the _Horus Heresy_ novel _Unremembered Empire_, when Curze is on the loose in the Temple of Hera, the entire forces at nearby Residence sets out to hunt him down. One of the members of the strike force, Gantula, wonders aloud whether Curze is a predator, using a wolf as his example. Then this happens:
        
        **Gantula:** \[...\] So, while the herdsmen are occupied, guarding the herd, the wolf turns to where they are not - the larder, the granary, the stables, the bird cages... _(beat) (Gantula stops and turns back, running to the Residence)_

-   Eminem's "Stan":
    
    _I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick.  
    Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge,  
    and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid,  
    and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to.  
    Come to think about, his name was... it was you.  
    Damn..._
    
    -   Also applies to the previous verse when Stan realizes a fatal miscalculation in his suicidal plan:
    
    _Well, gotta go, I’m almost at the bridge now-  
    Oh shit, I forgot! How am I supposed to send this shit out?_
    
-   In Jon Lajoie's "WTF Collective", MC Uses Time Machines Irresponsibly does this:

    I met up with my parents and we hung out all night  
    Come to think of it, they didn't have any alone time..._ NOOO—

-   _Team America: World Police_: Kim Jong-Il's translator, while interpreting for Kim during an arms deal, takes a moment to think about _what_ he's translating. Unfortunately for him, this revelation is the _second_\-last thing to go through his head.
    
    **Kim Jong-Il:** \[vaguely Korean-sounding gibberish\]  
    **Translator:** He asks what part of the deal you did not understand. He says that perhaps his translator did not make it clear to you. He says he should... f-fire his...translator?  
    _\*BANG\*_
    
-   _The Muppet Show_:
    -   In the Edward Burgen episode, the Muppet News Reporter comes in with a Muppet News Flash saying an embarrassing situation occurred when the Muppet News Reporter went on camera while forgetting to put on his pants...causing him to stop and look down behind his desk.

    -   Before the opening credits of the episode featuring Harry Belafonte, said guest star has a word with Scooter:
        
        **Scooter:** Say, is everything alright?  
        **Harry:** Oh, yeah, everything's OK. Except I haven't done the show yet and somebody started to put me down.  
        **Scooter:** No! What do you mean?  
        **Harry:** Just now I heard somebody outside my door say, 'Don't go inside that dressing room. Crazy Harry's in there.'  
        **Scooter:** They didn't mean you. You see, Crazy Harry's a m- CRAZY HARRY?!  
        **KABOOM!**
        
-   In "The Best Thanksgiving Ever" from _Bear in the Big Blue House_, following the pageant, Bear and the others smell something burning.

    **Everyone:** (_big gasp_) The food!
    
-   In _Dinosaurs_' episode "The Greatest Story Ever Sold", when Earl and the other tree-pushers express their existential woes of not knowing why they exist, their boss Richfield tries to set them straight;
    
    **Richfield:** Why you exist? I’ll tell you why you exist! So you can push down trees! So cities can be built for dinosaurs to live in, so they can push down more trees so more cities can be built so…dinosaurs can…push…down… _(Beat)_ You’re right! I don’t know why we exist! Oh no! AAAAHHHH!

-   In _The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy 1978_, Arthur and his friends find themselves on a ship manned by Haggunenons which, in the words of the titular guide, "would do for Charles Darwin what a squadron of Arcturan stunt apples would have done for Isaac Newton", giving the specific example that a Hagguneon who wanted to reach for the coffee might evolve into something with longer arms, but which is probably quite incapable of drinking coffee. (Incidentally, the same guide, which has the words "Don't Panic" written in large, friendly letters; notes that the best method of dealing with them is to "run away terribly fast".) The heroes then realize that one could be with them right now. Ford notes that it could even be the chair with two headrests that Zaphod and Trillian sat in earlier, which leads to this exchange:
-   _That Mitchell and Webb Sound_: The wedding planner called up before the Little Old Lady Job Justification Hearing, after realizing that essentially her job is in fact redundant.
    
    **Wedding planner:** _(sounding like she's about to cry)_ Oh... they don't need me.  
    **Little Old Lady:** No.
    
-   Near the of _The Frantics_ skit “Last Will and Testament”, the lawyer reads the section talking about what his client left for him. Not a boot to the head like all the other beneficiaries received, but a rabid Tasmanian Devil stuffed in his trousers. The lawyer gets understandably concerned as he’s reading it and begins shrieking in pain as the furry creature begins attacking him.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_, Daigo creates a monster that he then plans to send after two kids who accidentally come across the scene. His girlfriend, Melissa, tries to explain to him how it's actually better if the kids get away, because then they'd go alert their older brother (which is what the two want, since said brother is one of the superpowered kids they're hunting down). However, during her explanation, she looks over and realises that the monster has broken free of its restraint and is hurtling towards the children.

-   In _Jasper in Deadland_, after Jasper and Agnes reunite, reach Elysium and have their memories return, Agnes excitedly begins talking about how they can finally leave Deadland and go home to their families... before she realizes that returning to her life means returning to her abusive father, and she anxiously tries to convince Jasper to stay with her in Deadland.
-   _Hamilton:_
    -   In "The Room Where it Happens", after Hamilton seemingly sacrifices New York's status as the US Capital, Burr realizes:
    -   Burr has a second, more tragic example in "The World Was Wide Enough" as he pulls the trigger:
        
        **Ensemble & Burr:** He aims his pistol at the sky!  
        **Burr:** WAIT!
        
-   Fagin's song in _Oliver!_, "Reviewing the Situation", is this trope in musical form. Having realized that the life of a criminal, with all its "trials and tribulations", might not be the best thing for him, and he muses over possible alternatives: getting married, living in society, getting an honest job. Each time, though, he comes to the realization halfway through that the "solution" he's describing would not be an improvement, leading him to conclude:
    
    **Fagin:** I think I'd better think it out again.
    
-   Deianira has shades of this in _The Trachiniae_ as she talks to the chorus about the "strange sight" that is the bubbling, disintegrating piece of cloth she used to smear a love potion onto a shirt she just gave her husband.
-   In the Bill C. Davis play _Mass Appeal_, the young deacon, Mark, has been questioned about his sexuality after defending two seminarians suspected of being gay. He has decided to be honest and admit the fact that he has had same-sex relations as well as opposite-sex relations. Following the interview, he recounts the conversation to his mentor.
    
    **Mark:** He said, "Thank you for being so honest. Good day." Thank you for being so honest. Good d — _(moment of realization)_ I'm in trouble, aren't I?
    
-   Jason Robert Brown's _Songs for a New World_ features this trope in musical form courtesy of "Stars and the Moon." One of the show's four Singers (none of whom are named) reflects on her life and how, when she was young, she met two men who offered her immaterial treasures like love, truth, strength, summer rains, and the titular stars and the moon. But the singer wanted tangible wealth instead—"And I thought, you know...I'd rather have a yacht." She eventually met a young, rich man who promised her all of the luxuries she'd ever wanted and more—cars, houses, jewels, parties, furs—and happily married him, only to wake up one morning, look around, and realize that she'd given up on true happiness in the name of material possessions: "And I thought—My God...I'll _never_ have the moon..."
-   "When Words Fail," a song from _Shrek: The Musical_, plays this trope for laughs. The titular ogre has realized his feelings for Fiona and tries to prepare a declaration of love. First, he imagines offering her a flower as a symbol of his dedication, only to completely lose the metaphor and comment "Oh, MAN, I'm in trouble." Shrek then tries again by comparing the imaginary Fiona to the moon, as it's "big and bright"—and promptly realizes that he just called her "big." This leads to Verbal Backspace as he tries to make up for it ("And by 'big' I don't mean 'chubby!' Obviously you're not fat!") and starts talking about his own weight problems and his genetic predisposition to—and there's the metaphor lost again. It becomes a sweet moment, though, when Shrek realizes that even if he _does_ fail to express what he's feeling, Fiona will still understand the love behind his words.

-   _Camp Camp_:
    -   "Romeo & Juliet 2: Love Resurrected" sees Camp Campbell put on a Fan Sequel to Romeo and Juliet with Neil as Romeo and Nikki as Juliet. However, Tabii decides to take Nikki out of commission so she can take her place as Juliet and kiss Neil, leading to this exchange...
        
        **Tabii:** _\[offscreen\]_ Wow Nikki, you're, like, such a good actor.  
        **Nikki:** Oh thank you ominous, offscreen voice-wait a minute. _\[gets ambushed by Tabii and her friends\]_
        
    -   Throughout the episode "Into Town", Nikki just gets sicker and sicker until she eventually coughs up blood on Neil's shirt. Max doesn't know what's wrong with her, as they'd just been walking around town all day, and then it hits him: he dragged Nikki, a ravenous Nature Lover, _out_ of nature.
    -   In the episode "Anti-Social Network", Neil creates chatbots so the other campers will leave him alone. When he realizes that the chatbots are becoming smarter, he worries that a Turned On Their Masters scenario is occurring and gathers the chatbots with Max's help, then remember they forgot one:
-   _Dr. Havoc's Diary_: In "Captain Dr. Havoc":
    
    **Brock:** _\[the submarine is leaking\]_ Oh, shit, Havoc. I think your boat has a hole.  
    **Dr. Havoc:** How is that possible? _(Beat)_ Brock, how did you get on my submarine?  
    **Brock:** Oh, I just-I took a welding gun, and I popped a hole in the side, and then I— Ah, shit. Yep. I figured it out. I did it.
    
-   In _Clear Skies 2_, we get this little exchange between two characters in an escape pod wondering why their captain is trying to ram a _Titan_.
    
    **Burke:** I think he's going for the hydrazine tanks behind the engine.  
    **Fodder:** But that stuff's stable!  
    **Burke:** Not when the warp core goes up near i— _oh my word!_  
    **Fodder:** How big a bang's that gonna make?  
    **Burke:** How fast does this pod go?
    
-   In one episode of _Puffin Forest_, a group of players are on the second floor of a church about to set off a bunch of bombs they set on the lower floor of the church to kill some enemies when one of the players realizes that something isn't right with the plan but isn't quite sure what it is. Another player starts explaining the plan again before realizing they are still in the building they are about to blow up and shouts "RUN!" They all jump out the windows to escape the building and break their legs just as the bombs go off.

-   _Darths & Droids_:
    -   This happens to Annie when she finally tells Jim that she'd lost her job and in that same frame of time realizes it wasn't his fault entirely.
    -   Much later on, during the attack on the second Peace Moon, the Rebels come to an important realization: The Peace Moon is fueled by the Lost Orb, a source of unlimited power. And since it's fueled by a source of unlimited power, they'd never have a reason _not_ to have their shield up at all times.
        
        **Admiral Ackbar:** My god! It's not a trap! We're just **prats**!
        
-   In _8-Bit Theater_, the Light Warriors are sailing on a ship they got from Bikke when a discussion on sea monsters attacking them ensues. Red Mage points out that such encounters are so common, most seafarers keep their ships ready... only to realize that maybe Bikke neglected to keep his ship ship-shape as he did with his own crew.
    
    **Black Mage:** Well, I'm sure we have nothing to worry about. Bikke seemed the responsible sort. I mean, he only fed his faithful, loyal, beloved pirate crew Cheetos for three months because it was cheaper than real food. And since that led directly to their deaths, he was then able to keep all the money Garland paid for his full crew to kill us. Money that would've undoubtedly gone toward the upkeep of this boat had he not insisted upon giving it to us. Why does this sound like something Thief would do?
    
-   _El Goonish Shive_:
-   It's more of an Explain Explain Oh My moment, but... _Freefall_ has one somewhat like this. Florence is having a conversation with her friend Niomi about Uplifted Animals like Florence that segues into a discussion on terraforming.
    
    **Niomi:** As for Pfouts, that's a mirror world. Life there uses right-handed amino acids, Earth life uses left-handed. Our toughest viruses wouldn't survive there. To colonize Pfouts you'd have to redesign humans from the atomic level... Sheesh! It'd be faster and cheaper to engineer one of the local critters up to human... _\[beat\]_ Isaac Asimov on a bicycle!  
    **Florence:** Most things make sense when you look at them right. It's just sometimes you have to look really, really cock-eyed.
    
-   In _Gene Catlow_, Gene Catlow and CatsWhisker are discussing the First Animen, who are hostile to them. CW wonders how beings so ancient who have been in psychic contact with so many minds remained sane— and Gene realizes that they didn't.

    -   In the Franz Scortchmaw side-story, when Vip, the librarian who insists she's not a thief, reveals she has a sophisticated alchemy calibration tool, Lumi, the student Spark geeks out, because one of her professors has one exactly like it but won't let the students touch it because it's "one-of-a-kind".
        
        **Lumi**: Ha! If she knew _we_ had one... uh... _I knew it!_ You _are_ a thief!
        
-   In _A Modest Destiny_ the Big Bad, after being pestered by the Hive that he needs to make a blood sacrifice _now_ or the ritual will fail, he stabs one of them to death. When the ritual is still failing, the other members explain that as an undead he was barely a quarter alive.
    
    **The Black Knight:** So what you are saying is that I need to kill three more just like him, right?  
    **Hive #2:** Correct.  
    **Hive #3:** ...Um...  
    **Hive #4:** ...Nuts.
    
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   In "It Takes a Thief", the Order needs to figure out where Xykon is hiding during the siege on Azure City, when Belkar starts to complain.
        
        **Belkar:** Hey, is there any chance we can hurry this up? "It's Pat" is already fireballing hobgoblins down there, and me, I'm just standing around here freezing my considerable assets off in this wind.  
        **Roy:** Keep it down, Belkar, this is more important than complaining about the...wind.  
        **Sound F/X:** wooosh!  
        _(Beat panel)_  
        **Sound F/X:** wooosh!  
        **Hinjo:** Saangwan! Cast your spell now!  
        **Saangwan:** Yes, Lord Hinjo.  
        **Haley:** And look UP!  
        **Sound F/X:** WOOOSH!  
        **Saangwan:** True Seeing! _(Looks up)_ Oh...oh my.  
        _(Xykon is shown riding a_ zombie dragon._)_
        
    -   In "They've Had Time to Train, Too", Haley and the Azurite Resistance are running a stealth raid on a granary in Hobgoblin-occupied Azure City. Haley's already dispatched most of the hobgoblin guards and all they need to do to take the granary undetected is to finish off the wizard leading them, when the wizard fires off...
        
        **Haley:** "Dancing Lights"? That's like a 0th-level spell! Geez, what kind of low-level, lame-ass spellcaster are you? You've got one chance before I perforate you, and you choose... Dancing... Lights...  
        _\[wizard points upward; Haley looks up at the bright red signal alerting hobgoblin forces all over the city of their position\]_
        
    -   In "The Comics Must Flow", Belkar is chugging spice in the middle of the desert. Seeing his eyes change color, Haley insists he read the warning label to avoid getting sick.
        
        **Belkar:** No, it doesn't say anything about eye color change. Just a disclaimer that the distributor is not liable for any gruesome violent deaths resulting from consuming this product in an open desert. So, see? It's perfectly safe for— ...Ah, crap.  
        _\[cue giant Sand Worm bursting from sand\]_
        
    -   In "Collect Call", when Roy and Belkar get arrested for not having proper entry papers, Durkon contacts them with Sending. After three _sending_ discussions, Roy tells Durkon to find the others, saying that he hopes Durkon has enough _sending_ spells. Durkon Sends again, telling Roy not to worry as he had prepared four _sending_ spells... before he realizes that he just used them all up.
        
        **Belkar:** _\[to Roy\]_ I don't know what just happened, but I feel a sudden urge to help you come up with 25 synonyms for "buffoon".
        
    -   In "Rising Suspicion", when the Order is walking around a bunch of fresh corpses that have been killed by vampires, Belkar comments that he hopes they don't turn into more vampires, but Roy tells him that it won't be a problem as a person doesn't become a vampire until three days after they died and he had broken the staff that had the spell to speed up the process. It's then that Haley realizes that Vampire Durkon's time spent researching the _protection from daylight_ spell wouldn't make sense if he was going to be invading a subterranean city and that he had actually been learning the spell to speed up a vampire's rise.
        
        **Haley:** I'm just saying, if I knew my Evil Doom Plan might hinge on me invading a subterranean country, I might not worry too much... about the sun.
        
-   _Paranatural_:
    
    -   Chapter 5 sees a game of dodgeball—sorry, "hitball"—go awry when Jeff gets (sort of) possessed by a spirit named Hijack. Eventually the only people still on the field are Max, Johnny, Hijack!Jeff, and an unnamed student who taped several balls to her body to shield herself. Max then promptly...gets the unnamed student out. Hijack thinks about why he did that at first, but then it dawns on him.
    
    **Hijack!Jeff:** Why'd he hit her? That's just..._every last ball ON MY SIDE!_
    
    -   Max's internal narration describes Scrapdragon, and it eventually becomes apparent that it is not just describing Scrapdragon from memory, but describing the sight in front of Max at that very moment. This is followed by an illustration of a wide-eyed Max staring at Scrapdragon, suddenly realizing that he is in Scrapdragon's spirit realm.
    
    What had Max been thinking, treating that leviathan like an unruly pet?! I mean, just _look_ at it! It was huge! It spanned half the horizon! Which was bright red now, a sunset over fields of metal scrap, just barely visible through the... ruins of...  
    _\[Illustration of Max staring at Scrapdragon towering over him, the surroundings having suddenly taken on a junkyard look\]_

-   _Pixie and Brutus_: In one strip, Pixie tells Brutus that he found a movie on television about a character she thinks is named "Freddy Cougar".

The machine was set to look forwards in time instead of backwards.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    -   Kevyn learns that there is a right time and a wrong time to invoke this on someone here. The time to explain by feeding someone clues and letting them work out the enemy's plan themselves is _not_ when you are in the enemy's territory _and_ they know you're there.
    -   During the Under New Management arc, Kevyn and Tagon discuss their current mission; being blackmailed by Xinchub into hunting down Kevyn's sister Breya. If they don't, Xinchub will have the Toughs arrested for a number of crimes. When Kevyn remains unhappy, Tagon asks who Xinchub will send after Breya once the Toughs are imprisoned. Kevyn responds, "I don't know... Some unimaginative, trigger-happy rear admiral, I guess." _(Beat)_ "Oh, crap. I can't believe I _just now_ figured that out."
-   _Something\*Positive_: Having put in a bid on a nice looking house, Peejee brags to Davan that, with its severely reduced asking price and history of other bidders backing out at the last moment, she's certain to get it for cheap... before realizing that those were actually some pretty serious red flags that she'd completely glossed over. It later turns out that, while the house _itself_ is fine, the neighborhood it's in is full of creeps, bigots, fundies and generally unpleasant neighbors.
-   _xkcd_: "How did the pole vaulters get up to our balcony?"
-   _Questionable Content_:
    -   In "Delayed Entendre Recognition", Faye is justifying her claim that she's descended from Civil War pirates by saying her grandmother said their ancestors were "boarded by Yankee seamen all the time". As she says it, she realises that that's not what she meant.
    -   Two strips later, she tells Marten about telling Angus about her father's suicide. When Marten is surprised that she just told him, she replies "Well, yeah. I mean, I couldn't be all _cryptic_ about it, that would be a really shitty ... thing ... to do ... to ... someone ..."
    -   In BRTOM, when Beepatrice questions whether Roko's attempts to find leverage against someone she's got a meeting with are appropriate for an AI rights volunteer:
        
        **Roko:** Oh, what, like being an agent of the state conditioned me to treat any potential conflict as a cops versus robbers situation instead of two adults trying to come to an agreement, and I'm deflecting my anxiety over this meeting by regressing to that mindset?  
        _\[Beat\]_  
        **Roko:** Well, shit. I thought I was being sarcastic.  
        **Beeps:** You get the Big Realizer of the Month award! I'll fetch your commemorative plaque.
        
    -   In "Self-Revelation", on Dora's first date with Jim, she tells him why she broke up with Marten, and how the relationship seemed to bring out her anxieties, concluding "I probably shouldn't be dating _anybody_ right now. _\[Beat\]_ Shit."
-   _Terror Island_: In this strip, several characters are attempting to banish a demon. They gather everything they need except toothpaste when the demon traps them in a force field, leading to this.
    
    **Liln:** Okay, this isn't too bad. We just need to call Sid and Stephen, and have them get the toothpaste... at the grocery store.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>   
    **First Folio:** We're doomed!
    
-   In _Leftover Soup_, Cheryl and Carol are discussing the ethics of being a parent while also being in a polyamorous relationship, when...
    
    **Cheryl:** You don't think finding out about Mommy and Daddy's other lovers is gonna mess a kid up?  
    **Carol:** Well, how do you feel about Miguel?  
    **Cheryl:** Uncle Meegs? That's different. He's just Mom and Dad's friend, nothing weird or polyamorous about that. He just moved in with us for a while to help out with child care after Carl was born. _(beat)_ ...our little brother Carl, who has black hair and brown eyes and evidently my entire life is an elaborate web of deception.  
    **Carol:** _(nervously)_ Omission! An elaborate web of omission!
    
-   #8 of _Hobbits And Hole Dwellers_ has a rather twitchy Ted excuse himself for five minutes. When he comes back, he asks Bailey to tell him about her character. Bailey responds by asking _which_ character of hers he means.
    
    **Ted:** What do you mean, which one? You only had that wizard five minutes ago- wait.
    
-   Played for laughs in this _Penny Arcade_ strip:
    
    **Tycho:** You must be cranked up for this Sea of Thieves RPG, right?  
    **Gabe:** Must I?  
    **Tycho:** I mean, you've spent months essentially porting the Sea of Thieves experience to D&D! You meticulously crafted rules for sailing, ship combat, modelling the wind, custom minigames to simulate fishing, diving... treasure hunting... Oh.
    
-   In _It's Walky!_, when Walky and Joyce are running a Trojan Gauntlet, Joyce comes up with the brilliant idea of buying some other random things, so the clerk will think they're using the condoms in a science project or something.
    
    **Joyce**: I've got these plastic cowboy handcuffs, a bag of feathers, a, uh— jar of vasoli— AAAAAGGH!

    **Storm:** Guy on the Couch gives you Slack +1. You can play him at any time without rolling, but starting on the next player's turn, he'll go away if... oh, I'm an idiot.

-   _The Nostalgia Critic_:
    -   This happens at the end of his review of _A Simple Wish_, where he rants about Mara Wilson's bad movies only to realize, as he describes what she looks like now, that she's currently watching him. She then proceeds to respond to his dissing of her movies from when she was a little girl by showing clips from some of the Critic's home movies from his own childhood.
        
        **Critic:** But I'm sorry, I'm just not a fan of her movies! I mean, it's like everything Mara Wilson touched back then just turned to crap. I mean, look at her. _\[pulls up video of a modern-day Mara, looking visibly displeased\]_ With her couch, her modern-day haircut, her twenty-five-ish-year-old body, her vengeful eyes that seem to be looking directly at me right now— _eeesh!_  
        **Mara:** Hello, Critic.
        
    -   Another one happens in his review of _The Nutcracker in 3D_ when Gielgud mentions that the Rat King and his men (who are depicted as behaving like Nazis) burn toys.
        
        **NC:** Wait. Like inanimate toys, or living toys, like the ones we've been seeing?  
        _\[Cut back to the first scene with the Nutcracker\]_  
        **Nutcracker:** All dolls are alive.  
        **NC:** Okay, I guess that's supposed to mean they're all alive... _\[freezes in place, realizing what this means\]_ You're not.  
        _\[We're again shown the scene of the Rat King speaking to the Nutcracker, Tinker and Sticks\]_  
        **Rat King:** You ever wonder what happens to a doll's soul when it burns?  
        **NC:** _\[shakes head\]_ You're seriously not. _\[The people of the kingdom, paired as parent and child, are brought to the Rat King's palace/smoke factory to the big pile of inanimate toys before them. The rat soldiers take the toys away from the children to toss them on the pile\]_ Oh, yeah. You thought this was just gonna be simple bad guy Nazi imagery like in _Indiana Jones_ or old _Looney Tunes_ cartoons? But no. People being rounded up, children crying, and the sky filled with smoke from factories burning piles of what they just made clear are _**living individuals**_. _All of this is actually happening._
        
-   The Rap Critic's list of the top nine worst lyrics of 2016 has him wrapping up by putting the entirety of B.o.B.'s "Flatline" at #1. His discussion of the song's failings culminates in a massive "The Reason You Suck" Speech at conspiracy theorists, accusing them of poisoning the discourse such that actual problems with government and corporate corruption and malfeasance can't be discussed rationally without being lumped in with raving lunatics. He then realizes that the proliferation of phony conspiracy theories to misdirect truth-seekers would be _just what the people in power would want_. This causes him to (sarcastically) go into raving Conspiracy Theorist mode himself.
    
    **Rap Critic:** In fact, if I didn't know any better, I'd think that... oh my God. These conspiracy nuts are a plant by evil corporations! They're there to make any actual criticism of the effects of their tyranny look crazy! Oh my God, it's the perfect plan! To keep your mind occupied by fantasy that tells you that you're powerless, and misdirect people out there who want to be socially aware with gobbledygook about the Earth being flat! Because, y'know, _that's_ what's ruining society! Listen to me, people! All you flat-earthers and 9/11 truthers out there, stop focusing your energy on this bulls\*\*t! Remove the wool from over your eyes and realize that you should be using your energy to protest actual corrupt stuff like, like the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, or pushing for better police training! Stop talking about the weather machines or pizza parties or whatever bulls\*\*t you're actually thinking about! That's just what the Illumi-Nazis or the Build-a-Bear Corporation want you to think! _Open your eyes, sheeple!!!_ I'm the Rap Critic, and... be aware, my friends. _\[takes off cap to reveal a Tinfoil Hat\]_ Be very aware.
    
-   During their video on _SCP – Containment Breach_, IGP and IcyCaress were camping outside the door to a small, three-door connector, waiting for "Peanuts" (the infamous SCP-173) on the other side to leave, reassuring each other that 173 cannot open doors. A few moments later, IGP goes through the door and the following exchange occurs:
    
    **Icy:** Are you sure you're alright?  
    **IGP:** Yeah, I don't have the blink meter, that means he's gone. He's gone!  
    **Icy:** Great! That means... wait, that means he _can_ open doors.  
    **IGP:** He's... Oh god, he can.
    
-   _StacheBros_: In "The Day Super Mario Died", Boo believes that Mario is dead after hearing such news from Luigi, but she tries to show him the bright side of being dead by helping him pull pranks on the Mushroom Kingdom. After their pranking, though, Mario is still bummed about believing he's dead:
    
    **Boo:** Aw, c'mon, we went through this! Being dead's great! So what if a condor bit your head off?  
    **Mario:** Yeah, I know, it's bad- _\[record needle scratch\]_ What? Condor?  
    **Boo:** Yeah, and that forest shark ate the rest of you!  
    **Mario:** What? No, I got pushed off a cliff by Luigi.  
    **Boo:** What, that stupid hill? You couldn't have... oh, no.  
    **Mario:** What?  
    **Boo:** Luigi made it all up. Which means... you're alive! And that means...  
    **Mario:** All those pranks were...  
    **Both:** Oh, no!
    
-   This happens twice to Todd in the Shadows during his review of One Direction's "Best Song Ever", as his criticisms fall flat and he starts to realize that he actually likes the song.
-   _Unraveled_:
    -   Brian spends more than ten minutes discussing the vital traits that his new music genre will require to thrive in the wastelands of the _Fallout_ series, he suddenly realises that he's spent all that time reinventing Ska.
    -   At the end of his video on Bowser's military organisation, Brian fills in some of the odds-and-ends characters:
        
        "\[_These characters_\] didn't really fit in the military structure, they don't act like military. The Koopa Troopas from _Super Mario 64_, they don't even antagonise you, they go about their business unless you go out of your way to attack them. So, again, they don't even feel like military. They act more like civilians, to be honest."  
        _(long pause)_  
        "Oh my God, they're civilians."
        
    -   Throughout his video on when Mario can retire, all of Brian's projections have come to the conclusion that Mario can't retire until he's almost 90. At the end of the video, Brian tries one last time, using his own financial information, only to get the same result. Brian protests this conclusion, pointing out that if Mario can never retire, then _he_ can never retire, at which point what he just said hits him, and the video ends with Brian out drinking.
-   At the end of the _Big Picture_ episode "Familiar Things", about how _Stranger Things_ uses nostalgia for The '80s as one of its main hooks, Bob notes how many of the Amblin Entertainment works that the show is hearkening back to were themselves nostalgic for The '40s and The '50s, when their own creators grew up, and how that nostalgia has come full circle. He then starts thinking of how it might come full circle again once the young fans of _Stranger Things_ themselves become adults.
    
    "I can't help but wonder, knowing that _Stranger Things_ does indeed have a young fanbase that doesn't actually have firsthand memories of its various references, what it'll look like when the series inspires its own nostalgia in a generation's time. Nostalgia for the 2010s' nostalgia of the '80s, which was nostalgia for the '40s and '50s? Well, at least my job's not going anywhere... oh dear God."
    
-   Decker Shado ended up doing this when commenting on the title of the version of _Gamera vs. Gyaos_ he's reviewing with That Long-Haired Creepy Guy. As when commenting on it, he criticizes the latter titular monster's name being spelled as "Gaes" and is immediately horrified. Creepy, an LGBT man, quickly gives out a Death Glare.
-   At the end of _Atop the Fourth Wall_'s review of _Sensational Spider-Man_ #0, Linkara mentions that some viewers believed that he was almost done with _The Clone Saga_ before mentioning he's been skipping around stories before he lifted up the massive seven volume omnibus collection covering it and tells them that that doesn't even include the original saga, the Ultimate Clone Saga, the mini-series revision and others. This means he'd _never_ run out of the Clone Saga. A split second later, his face drops and he shouts "DAMMIT!"
-   During _Tear Of Grace_'s playthough of _Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor_, after Brett's newest Captain defeats an enemy one in combat, several other enemy Captains flee the scene. Brett reads off the name of one of said Captains and stops mid-sentence when he realizes that his Implacable Man Nemesis Pigug the Shadow has come Back from the Dead yet again.
    
    **Brett:** Pigug the Shadow escape- _\[Beat as Brett remembers who that is\]_ Pigug... Shadow... Escaped...
    
-   A subdued version is used in _Scott The Woz_ when the group's attempt at warning people of the blue border in "Borderline Forever" fails miserably and they realize it may have had the exact opposite effect they were hoping for:
-   _Oxventure_: Played for Laughs, since the players were well aware of Prudence's big Internal Reveal in advance:
-   _Critical Role_: As Nott deals the final blow to the incubus that had been hassling the party, Sam proudly proclaims she blows it up with an explosive crossbow bolt. His expression then turns to horror when he realizes that Caduceus, who was unconscious and had already failed two death saves, was in the blast radius as well.
