You've seen it on the road, or (more likely) in a parking lot with the sound of either Led Zeppelin or a sexophone coming from the speakers and smoke that ain't tobacco coming out the windows and doors. It's a classic full-size work van, but it's definitely _not_ being used as a work vehicle, unless you're talking about The Oldest Profession. Most of the interior behind the front seats has been gutted and replaced with camper-like living quarters, often with such amenities as a bed, a TV, a mini fridge, and shag carpeting, where a bunch of people can smoke cannabis and get laid. It may have a custom paint job lifted straight off the cover of a Heavy Metal album or a High Fantasy novel, filled with Rated M for Manly imagery like dragons, demons, fire, lightning, barbarian warriors, and scantily-clad women. Either that, or it has a lot of earth-tone stripes, spirals, and arrows running down the length of the vehicle. And its owner has probably given it a sweet name, possibly printed on the side of the van. Remember: if the van's a-rockin', Don't Come A-Knockin'.

As for the owner, he (and it's usually a he) usually falls into one of two categories. First, he's probably either working-class or a Lower-Class Lout, decidedly countercultural in his tastes (often a metalhead), and likely to be somebody's cool older cousin or sibling. Second, he's The Casanova who uses his van as a rolling bachelor pad or private room to get laid, or at least a Casanova Wannabe who _tries_ to.

In short, you're looking at a Shag Wagon.

Also known as a conversion van, a sin bin, or a shag cart, a Shag Wagon is similar to a Hippie Van and can be seen as its successor, but has some key differences. First, and most importantly, you probably won't find actual hippies around it, but a crowd whose idea of free living is more about Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll than peace and love. Second, a Shag Wagon typically (though not always) puts a greater emphasis on creature comforts, whereas a Hippie Van is typically more utilitarian. Furthermore, while a Hippie Van is usually either a Volkswagen Type 2 or (less commonly) a converted school bus, a proper Shag Wagon is usually an all-American Chevrolet, Dodge, or Ford van. Finally, while the Hippie Van is a symbol of The '60s, the Shag Wagon and the associated van culture are both deeply associated with The '70s. American automakers at the time were fully aware of what their vans were being used for and eagerly exploited this trope, marketing their vans as being built for "cruising" and even making their own factory conversion packages.

A Boyfriend-Blocking Dad will _not_ take kindly to his daughter's date showing up in one of these, as it broadcasts loud and clear what his intentions are.

A type of Pimped-Out Car. Very likely to be a Cool Car or at least thought of as such by its owner. Often used as a form of Vehicle-Based Characterization, to show that its owner holds libertine views on sex and drug use. Contrast the Van in Black and the Creepy Stalker Van.

-   In _Onward_, the protagonist Ian Lightfoot's older brother Barley drives a van that he calls Guinevere, which has a pegasus painted on the side and Barley's living quarters in the back. It's The Alleged Car, but Barley still treats it as The Precious, Precious Car, until he sacrifices it so that he and Ian can complete their quest without getting arrested. He replaces it with a new van, Guinevere II, at the end.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Harry from _Dumb and Dumber_ has a customized van... modded to resemble a dog's head, complete with fake fur all over it. He runs a mobile pet-grooming service out of the back, but he's also dumb enough to think he can use it to pick up chicks. He outright calls the van his "shaggin' wagon" while attempting to flirt with a woman at a gas station.
-   Sam in _Ginger Snaps_ drives a yellow Chevrolet Astro that he uses to run over the werewolf that bit Ginger. The tools on the roof and in the back indicate that he does in fact use it as a work vehicle, but some of his classmates also use it as a place to privately get stoned.
-   _Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back_: Jay and Silent Bob, while hitchhiking to Hollywood, come across a group that are clearly parodies of the crew from _Scooby-Doo_. They try to soothe an argument with the group by offering them "doobie snacks", i.e. pot, in the back of a large van that's suspiciously _not_ the Mystery Machine.
-   The band Low Shoulder in _Jennifer's Body_ travel in one. It doubles as a Creepy Stalker Van given how they use it to lure in underage fans, including Jennifer, who they sacrifice to Satan in order to make it big.
-   _Kill Bill_ has a pickup truck being used for this purpose. After waking up in a hospital bed and killing the orderly who raped her and pimped her out while she was in a coma, Beatrix steals the orderly's truck, a customized yellow Chevrolet Silverado with the words "Pussy Wagon" printed on the sides and the tailgate in funky pink lettering. She is visibly disgusted by it and insults its late owner when she sees it. Given the film's Genre Throwback to '70s martial arts movies, Quentin Tarantino was likely invoking this trope, even if the Pussy Wagon wasn't actually a van.
-   Slick in _Prom Night (1980)_ drives one that he uses to try and run over the killer, who instead hitches an Outside Ride on it that ends with the van getting blown up and Slick and Jude killed.

    -   The 1977 film _The Van_ is about a nerdy guy who buys a shag wagon called the Straight Arrow upon graduating high school so he can land the girl of his dreams, only to find his best friend getting more use out of it than he does.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_: Hitchcock and Scully drive around in a old van which is a relic from a bygone era inside and out.

    Western Animation
