**Wilson:** Well I decided that being a little bit more like you wouldn't hurt.  
_\[Wilson takes off his hat and crushes a beer can against his forehead\]_  
**Tim:** How do you feel now?  
**Wilson:** ...I hurt.

Crushing a can of beer or soda with your forehead.

Often starts by a drunken person wanting to show how tough they are, and hey, they just HAPPEN to have an empty beer can in their hand...

Sometimes it's a macho thing, and sometimes it's Played for Laughs. The most frequent variation involves the can being full, with resulting cranial trauma.

In Real Life, this could result in a concussion if you slam the thing against your head (as opposed to placing it there and applying steady pressure). Using a full can is especially not recommended, as these are strong enough for you to _stand_ on them.

It should also be noted that the ability to smash a can against one's forehead is not as impressive of a feat as it used to be, because modern beverage cans are made of thinner aluminum than vintage beverage cans (which were usually steel).

    Advertising 

-   In a "How to Speak Australian" ad for Foster's Lager, a lady at a bar does this after topping off a guy's drink with what was left in the can. She's called a "keeper."
    -   Miller Lite:
    -   One of Miller Lite's "Man Law" commercials had the Men of the Square Table debating whether crushing cans on your forehead was macho or just moronic. They decided on moronic.
        
        **Eddie Griffin:** Cans ain't as thick as they once were. I mean, back in the day, you crushed a can against your forehead, you were saying something. But now...  
        **Burt Reynolds:** Lame.
        
    -   Head crushing was the subject of a commercial back in the late '80s. Former Bears safety Gary Fencik did the crushing while making comments about being known for "using your head" (Fencik graduated from Yale). Another patron tries to imitate him and knocks himself cold.
-   One Pepsi commercial had can-crushing as a final test for initiates in a Buddhist monastery.
-   An Australian beer ad had a similar in spirit version where a tough guy attempting to impress a pretty girl in a midriff top on the other side of the bar opens his beer bottle with his eye socket. The unimpressed girl picks up her beer, holds it below bar level so it is out of sight, and twists it before holding up her open bottle. The tough guy is visibly shocked until the girl stands up revealing that she had opened it with her navel.

    Comedy 

-   A prop comedian once demonstrated the ultimate way to one-up tough guys who crush beer cans on their foreheads: He showed a beer can, crushed it against his forehead, and subsequently un-crushed it by inflating it back to its original shape.

    Comic Books 

-   _Bigfoot & Gray on the Run_: Gray does this to dispose of the Gray Bull cans he drinks (or leave them at a spot in his spaceship, at least).

    Comic Strips 

-   One _For Better or for Worse_ during Michael's college years had Michael deciding to "never take advice from a guy who crushes beer cans with his forehead" after his roommate Weed does so.
-   A 2002 _Over the Hedge_ strip showed RJ, Verne, and Sammy drinking cola, burping, then smashing the cans against their foreheads. Verne wound up with his can stuck directly through his head, with RJ remarking "That's gonna leave a mark."

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Chicken Little_, Fish Out Of Water does this to a can during the baseball game. Justified as he always wears a sturdy diving suit helmet.

    Literature 

-   Invoked by Mr. Tulip, in _The Truth_, who smashes a bottle of alcohol against his forehead. The narrative notes that he is not doing this to be perceived as tough by the drinkers at Beirs, but simply because he had a bottle that he no longer needed and putting it down on a table required more concentration than he deemed necessary. This is implied to be what causes the other customers in Biers to later lock the door in case Mr. Tulip and his partner come back. For those less familiar with Discworld, Biers is Ankh-Morpork's resident bar for the _undead_.
    -   A brief reference to Bad Guy Bar toughs who "open beer bottles with their teeth, or—if the evening has been going _really_ well—other people's teeth" in an earlier work is similar in spirit.
-   Deconstructed in one humorous college survival guide, which shows a step-by-step guide to doing this, the last step being that you will not make a good impression on your girlfriend's parents, with the boy meeting the parents with the marks from crushing the can still on his head.

Next time you meet him, he's wielding the jade pillar as a weapon.

Put an empty can in her fake hand, press the button, and it smashes the can flat while playing a tinny recording of her voice.

-   Russian Airborne Forces soldiers have a tradition of smashing glass bottles this way to show how badass they are.
-   You can buy novelty soft plastic cans that look a bit like the real thing which will crush gently and not injure you when whacked against your head.
