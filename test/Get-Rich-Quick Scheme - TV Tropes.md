_"Is this a get rich quick scheme? Of course! Who wants to get rich slow?"_

Most people have careers that allow them to live comfortably, some people have very well-paying jobs, fewer still have jobs that would allow them to be "rich", and still even fewer have Big Bux.

When a character wants to get Big Bux, they often don't try more common varieties of accruing wealth like bumping off rich relatives, stealing, or being a miser. They go for a Get-Rich-Quick Scheme sometimes resulting in an If I Were a Rich Man moment and often overlapping with a Zany Scheme or Missing Steps Plan.

A common variation of this trope is that the Get Rich Quick person thinks working is a get-rich-quick scheme or that they fall for someone else's scheme instead. In situations where the scheme does end up getting someone Big Bux, the story often follows up by the participants then totaling up any taxes/fines/expenses/etc incurred over the course of the scheme, and realizing that their actual profit is negligible at best.

Beware: every Con Man knows exactly how appealing the prospect of easy money can be and is eager to exploit it as part of The Con to take advantage of the mark's naïveté. Or, alternately, if someone else hits on a scheme that _works_, he may step in to help make sure A Fool and His New Money Are Soon Parted. Remember: if it sounds Too Good to be True, it probably is.

A Sister Trope to Ponzi, and a favorite pastime of the Schemer and the Ambitious, but Lazy.

Compare Mock Millionaire (who's typically involved in one way or another).

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In Mel Brooks' _The Producers_, two theatrical producers sell 25,000% of the production to investors and plan to create a play that will close on opening night, receiving almost no income, and therefore net them a substantial profit from the unused investment, since the IRS doesn't investigate flops. Their efforts to create a flop result in a blatantly pro-Nazi musical called _Springtime for Hitler_, a production starring a spaced-out hippie as Hitler. Unfortunately for the producers, audiences mistake the musical for a satire and love it. Because the play does not flop, the producers will be completely unable to pay back their investors, resulting in their exposure in investment fraud. The musical and its 2005 adaptation swap out the spaced-out hippie for the Camp Gay director; the results are the same.
-   _Layer Cake_: The protagonists' boss, Jimmy Price, has lost a bundle on stupid investments and fires off a bunch of these, chiefly by stealing a bunch of ecstasy from some other gangsters, but also by embezzling the savings of his underling, shopping his villainous colleagues to the police, and attempting to have a fellow crime lord's daughter kidnapped and ransomed.

There are others.
-   Al Bundy tried several of these on _Married... with Children_. They worked out about as well as you'd expect.

    Music 

-   Discussed with utter contempt in Styx's "Rockin' the Paradise":
    
    Don't need no fast-buck, lame-duck profits for fun
    
    Quick-trick plans take the money and run
    
    We need long-term, slow-burn, gettin' it done
    
    A straight-talkin', hard-workin' son-of-a-gun

    Video Games 

-   The basis of every part of _Crystal Caves_. The main character, Mylo, keeps bungling into one Get-Rich-Quick Scheme after another (he's so famous for this that this got him a entry in the Galactic Encyclopedia) and isn't afraid to cooperate with people with names like Mr. Rip Eweoff. Each episode involves him trying to collect enough crystals to buy another inevitably fail-prone business (such as the farm of Explosive Breeders who turn out to be too explosive in this regard, or a farm of slugs which happens to be built on top of a salt mine). His luck turns around in the end of episode three; after a solar system he just bought explodes, Mylo sets up a burger shop near the resulting scenic nebula.
-   Mission's older brother Griff from _Knights of the Old Republic_ has a bad habit of trying these. The last one is a plan to ferment beverages from tach glands—falling for it is technically the only way to clear his (optional) questline.
-   Reimu Hakurei, protagonist of _Touhou Project_, carries these out all the time — though it this case it's more like "Get Any Money, Period" Quick Schemes, since the Hakurei Shrine is almost always dirt poor due to the rumors of Yōkai hanging around scaring away would-be worshipers. This crops up primarily in official Expanded Universe materials, with Reimu pulling one in every alternate chapter of _Touhou Ibarakasen ~ Wild and Horned Hermit_ in particular.
-   Penelope in _Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time_ intends to use Bentley's skills to make a fortune in designs, _weapon_ designs, in order to Take Over the World. It doesn't work as intended when Bentley finds out and dumps her, owing to her lack of patience and empathy.

    Webcomics 

-   Mr. Kornada from _Freefall_ attempts one of these on a planetary scale.

Said robots are also essential workers for the terraforming process that the planet is in the middle of.

-   Most _SpongeBob SquarePants_ episodes featuring Mr. Krabs that don't focus on defending the Krabby Patty Formula have the greedy crab plotting some sort of elaborate plot to earn extra money such as selling garbage at a yard sale, adding a new item on the menu or turning the Krusty Krab into a hotel.
-   In the _Futurama_ episode "Put Your Head On My Shoulder", Bender has a deviously clever scheme to make money by pimping. Unfortunately, the city has a no-pimping policy and he was arrested. And this is just one of his many schemes that doesn't involve stealing from somebody.
-   _King of the Hill_:

    -   In "Cops and Robert", Dale applies for a job at a "Hooters" Expy called Bazooms! with the expectation that they will turn him down for being male, letting him sue them for gender discrimination.

    -   In "Timephoon", he steals a Time Machine so he can travel back in time and space to retrieve lost treasures before they were lost (so there wouldn't be any risk of temporal paradoxes). However, his repeated use of the time machine ends up causing a Time Crash that nearly rips apart the fabric of reality, so he's forced to put all the artifacts back in their correct times.
    -   In "Glomtales", Louie is able to trick all of Scrooge's enemies into handing over all of their money to him, and in the process winning a bet that grants him total control over Scrooge's assets as well.

When the villains convene at the the dentist office and tell Blossom and Bubbles what she was doing behind their backs, they work together to set up an ambush for Buttercup in order to teach her a lesson. Buttercup, as a result, has _her teeth_ knocked out by the villains in return and then loses all the money she obtained through her scheme when the Professor uses it to pay her dental bills.
