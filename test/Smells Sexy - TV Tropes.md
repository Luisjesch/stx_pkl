_"You vampires. Did anybody ever tell you the whole smelling people thing's a little gross?"_

This is the The Nose Knows version of Mr. Fanservice, Ms. Fanservice, and the Head-Turning Beauty. It is the reason why humans invented perfume and cologne. A character with Super-Senses will probably be attracted to a person by their smell, especially if they've got some doggish attributes. Both vampires and werewolves are likely to note that their victim/lover smells good.

In Real Life, countless species use Pheromones for communication, especially for identifying when its members are able to reproduce. In fiction, this is a little more explicit... a character will 'smell sexy', and often there will be a list of exactly _what_ that character smells like. Expect a man to lovingly bury his face in the girl's hair, or nuzzling her neck as he tells her how wonderful she smells. Often, this calls back to baser, more bestial desires and needs, although it can be 'pure and romantic'.

May be related to Love Is in the Air, if the 'love flu' is coming off of one person. See Aroused by Their Voice for when a character's _voice_ arouses other characters. May involve Signature Scent or Perverted Sniffing.

-   Commercials for Axe body shampoo and spray have women falling all over men who use the products.
    -   One advert for Lynx featured a woman who, leaving the house in a hurry, liberally squirted her husband's Lynx over herself. For the rest of the day she is fighting off lots of enamoured women expressing an interest in her. The message is that Lynx is so potent it turns women into lesbians.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Ayakashi Triangle_:
    -   One of the more blatant signs that Matsuri, despite his claims, loves Suzu occurs when her doppelganger comes to him at night. As she closes in to kiss him, Matsuri knows it's not Shirogane in disguise again because he recognizes the smell of Suzu's shampoo. A later chapter has him enter her bedroom for the first time in years.

As such, his scent is a strange blend of human and Ghoul as well as male and female. This earns him a Stalker with a Crush in the form of Tsukiyama, who repeatedly engages in Perverted Sniffing. More generally, some ghouls don't distinguish between humans smelling "sexy" and "delicious".
-   _Urara Meirocho_: When exposed to alcohol, Chiya releases wild Pheromones that attract and put in heat animals and humans equally, it works with the same sex because she successfully attracted Koume and Nono.

-   _The Apprentice, the Student, and the Charlatan_:
    -   The Seduction Scent magic that Shimmer Silvermane attempts to use on Nova Shine is described as smelling like many things that he holds dear, namely books, lavender (Twilight), and the metallic edge of magic.

-   In _The Changeling of the Guard_, thestrals can detect changelings through their disguise by their scent. Fortunately for the insectoid ponies (or equine insects), the scent they give off is less "delicious" and more "comforting/arousing", much to exiled changeling Idol Hoove's perturbance when he learns of this fact from Mothchaser, a female thestral who has been flirting with him quite blatantly.
    
    She let out a chittey giggle, nervous. “The night guard has a joke that if it smells like coming home, it’s Idol Hooves coming on shift.” At my concerned look, she clarified. “It’s really a thestral thing. You don’t smell exactly like a pony, you kinda smell… um… good.” She cleared her throat. “Like. Really good. Nobody can really put a hoof on what it is but we like it.”  
    “...I do recall one of the unicorn night guard begging me for my cologne and then rolling all over me when I told him I had no idea what he meant. It was important for a ‘big date’.”  
    “Oh yeah, he absolutely got lucky with that one, then. Bold move, but I actually bet it worked?” At my stunned look, Mothchaser blushed. “It’s uh. Yeah. It’s a thing. Actually had to hold one of the New Moons back because they wanted to see if you tasted as good as you smelled.” I stared. She coughed.

-   _Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince_:
    -   As in canon, Amortentia, the world's strongest love potion, smells like whatever attracts you. However, it's recontextualized a bit. Harry doesn't smell Ginny's hair, but a new perfume that Fleur had given Ginny. It also takes Ginny a long time to identify the third thing she smells. It turns out to be phoenix tears. In her case (and presumably Harry's) the third smell is a _memory_; Harry's is apparently the first time he saw her as a potential Love Interest (which happened to be when she wore the new perfume), and for her it's when Harry carried her out of the Chamber of Secrets.

-   _Heroes by Choice_: Ochako's Quirk, instead of her canon Gravity Master power, turns her into a Succubus who, among other things, spreads pheromones that cause people attracted to females to see her as their ideal woman. Deconstructed, because it causes her to fear that any male friend she tries to make may only want to get into her pants and that her closest friends may have been affected. The fact that Izuku sees her as herself without knowing about the "ideal woman" thing becomes a Milholland Relationship Moment.
-   _Impunity_: House manages to identify a few women, including Cameron and Cuddy, with his eyes closed and without hearing any of their voices, simply by knowing what perfume they tend to favor.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_: Some fanfics utilize the premise that bonds with Miraculouses create "mating cycles" in humans, with accompanying production of mating pheromones.
    -   _Lady and the Tomcat_: Marinette learns that, thanks to her bond with Tikki, she has a "mating cycle" (despite the same bond making her temporarily infertile) in which she gives off pheromones that will make people around her more relaxed, but will have a much more intense effect on her partner Chat Noir. "If he's around you too much during this time, it'll set off the mating hormones in him too. And those will reflect back at you, and the connection will drift back and forth until it's painfully hard to manage." Unfortunately, while Ladybug can alert Chat to this and tell him to stay away from her outside of battle, the two have no idea that their civilian identities are in the same class.
        
        **Tikki**: You two can fight akumas together, but long periods of time where he's exposed to the pheromones will be the most detrimental. Like if you two were to sit near one another for an extended period of time.  
        **Marinette**: Well, we don't do that.  
        **Tikki**: Exactly.

-   _The UA Girls_: Mina and Tohru sniff Izuku slightly after he comes out of the shower, and both claim he smells "divine". According to Momo, it's because he's so clean that they smelled his pure pheromones.

    Films — Animated 

-   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_: Frollo shows his lust for Esmeralda by smelling her hair in a very creepy fashion.
-   _Rebuild of Evangelion_: A weird version is present in the second movie: Mari Makinami likes Shinji's scent... because he smells like LCL. She also mentions that she doesn't mind the scent of Eva-02, even though it smells like "the previous pilot", Asuka, perhaps indicating there's something special about Shinji.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Beast (2017)_, Moll brings up Pascal's smell a few times and clearly finds it attractive. When Polly asks what she likes about him, she half-jokingly brings up his smell.

-   _Harry Potter_: Amortentia, a love potion, smells like whatever the individual likes to smell most. When smelling said love potion for the first time, Harry picks up a scent he himself can't quite place, but the description given by the narration matches Ginny Weasley, making this an early indication that (earlier crushes notwithstanding) they're soul mates. Similarly, Hermione lists two things that she can smell in the potion but stops herself from revealing the third; according to Word of God, the one she wouldn't mention was Ron Weasley's hair. In the film her third is spearmint, referencing an earlier scene where Ron gave her toothpaste.

-   _Mind Games_: When Danielle is in her Cat Girl form, she says James smells so good that she can hardly stand it, even when he's covered with dirt and blood.

Over the course of the story, he becomes obsessed with capturing and bottling the scent of a woman, turning into a creepy serial killer of virgins. Just before he's executed, he pours single drop of the perfume on himself, throwing the crowd gathered to watch his execution into a lusty orgy. Later, using the whole bottle at once causes him to be torn limb from limb and devoured by beggars.
-   _The Princess Diaries_: Mia likes the smell of Michael's neck.
-   _Reign of the Seven Spellblades_: Ophelia Salvatori is an Uneven Hybrid of human mages and succubi, and constantly releases a Perfume which renders her irresistible to biological males (she's physically incapable of turning it off). Alvin Godfrey addressed the issue by casting pain spells on himself until he could be near her without being affected (she's implied to have fallen in love with him as a result), Carlos Whitrow was magically neutered as a child to serve as her minder, while Pete Reston is a Sex Shifter and becomes immune when he shifts to his female form while unconscious after she kidnaps him.

    Other 

-   Truth in Television, apparently. Scientific investigation has revealed that women actually CAN pick potential 'mates' based on smell - indeed, they can subconsciously 'smell' good genes. The attraction by smell is actually from having dissimilar types of antibodies, with nature preferring dissimilar ones for healthier offspring. Guys can do this too. Although, this sense is limited in modern humans, considering how we mostly use vision (appearance) and/or higher cognitive functions (like similar interests, intelligence or wealth) in choosing mates. Scent can also indicate arousal and illnesses.
-   Also, interestingly, this may explain why women wear their hair longer than men do. The pheromone glands in humans are located on the back of the neck. The long hair acts as a wick to spread the pheromones and thus attract the attention of a mate. This also explains a bit of the romantic hair-snuffling mentioned above; men are known to be attracted by the scent of a woman's hair (shampoo, etc.) but it's the pheromones there that really make it chemically addictive in the male brain.
-   More explicitly, pheromone glands are also located in the groin area. It is strongly believed that this is to make a person more enticing to their sexual partner. Indeed, queries have found that rather than being unappealing—as many women fear—most men find the aroma coming from this region to be very arousing.
-   There is also a theory that kissing as a gesture of affection and/or passion arose from smelling scent glands located on either side of our noses, and the actual mouth contact grew out of that.
