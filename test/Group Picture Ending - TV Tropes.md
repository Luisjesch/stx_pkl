When a visual work (movie, TV episode, video game, etc.) ends with a group picture of the main cast, especially if it's an ensemble. For the authors, it provides a perfect way to capture the entire ensemble dynamics in a single frame—one that is guaranteed to stick in the audience's memory.

If the actual picture taking is replaced with a simple freeze frame, it is Freeze-Frame Ending.

Also, hilarity will often ensue, as some of the cast can miss the mark and look the wrong way, say a Funny Photo Phrase, or even intentionally prank each other. May be followed up by Photo Montage in the Closing Credits.

Compare Crowded-Cast Shot.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

        -   Subverted at the end of "The Battling Eevee Brothers". Psyduck sets up a camera for a group photo of all the episode's characters, then trips trying to get into place when the timer goes off. At least that's the way the episode ends for the heroes; the actual last scene is of Team Rocket lamenting the failure of their latest scheme.

-   The _Mass Effect 3_ DLC campaign "Citadel" ends with a group photo of Shepard and whatever former and current squadmates and notable _Normandy_ crew are still alive. This photo then stays projected onto the wall of Shepard's new apartment. In a meta way, it also serves as the ending to the entire Shepard trilogy, as "Citadel" was the final piece of content produced for it (though chronologically, it comes before the game's ending).
-   _Mega Man (Classic)_ has had two so far.
    -   _Mega Man 4_ ends with Mega Man returning home by standing on top of a train. When he reaches home, he jumps off of the train as Roll and Rush run up to greet him as the screen freezes and turns sepia as though it was just photographed.

    -   In _Persona 5_, the ending of Royal in which you submit to Maruki's reality features a group photo of the cast once Makoto and Haru graduate.

-   The True Pacfist ending of _Undertale_ is one if you chose to leave the underground. However, if you have completed Genocide Run before, the group photo would have everyone crossed out by you, implying Chara has taken over you and murdered everyone else, this cannot be undone.
