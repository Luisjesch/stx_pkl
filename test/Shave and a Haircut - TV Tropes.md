Two bits!

Probably the most infamous seven beats of music in the modern world, or at least high on the list, this five-and-two lick appears everywhere. In music, it's a sting to end a piece; in other media, it appears in a joke and/or as a recognition signature, usually a knock—the first person taps out "shave-and-a-hair-cut," and waits for the "two bits" response.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

For laymen unfamiliar with musical terminology and reading musical notes, "Shave and a Haircut" is the name of the familiar beat that goes "dun dun-dun dun dun, DUN DUN."

While the rhythm is flexible, and the words change, it's always to a similar tune, though some different versions of it exist. Illustrated is actually a variation of the original tune, with a flattened sixth. (A flat instead of an A). Another common variation is to have an additional faster note between the "and" and "a" part of the melody, usually an augmented fourth. (which would be an F# in the illustrated example).

(Cultural warning: be careful with expressing this song in Mexico or in front of Mexicans, because as noted under the real-life section this sting is _extremely_ offensive over there and is likely to get you in serious trouble with another Mexican unless you have enough of a friendship to justify it as friendly teasing).

For an equally ubiquitous song intro, see the Minsky Pickup.

The first time it appears, Harry uses the words "six bits!" as the punchline - perhaps he learned of the gag from the Michelle Shocked example below in Music? Regardless, someone must have corrected him, as in a later book he uses the more common "two bits" version.
-   _Ask Your Mama: 12 Moods for Jazz_ by Langston Hughes:

If you hear this tune being honked in a Mexican street, that means someone is having a fit of road rage — this led to an American Urban Legend which claims that if you honk the tune on your horn in a Mexican neighborhood, you'll likely be shot dead (which is not necessarily true, but given its local meaning, it has a very real possibility of leading to violent incidents).
