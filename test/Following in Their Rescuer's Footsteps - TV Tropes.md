This is when someone bases their future career path on having been saved by someone in that same line of work.

From a narrative standpoint, the reason for this is because the person wants to give back for getting a second chance in living and wanting to help others like they themselves were helped.

If the person knows the people who rescued them, expect some level of Hero Worship and wanting to be just as good as their rescuers. There is potential for a Broken Pedestal if they learn a dark secret about their heroes.

While the most common jobs of this area are from civil service areas like cops, doctors, firefighters and even military personnel, fantastic jobs like superheroes or even a Hunter of Monsters can also be suitable.

Subtrope of Paying It Forward. Can overlap with The Real Heroes and The Paragon. Compare to Atonement Detective. See also Ascended Fanboy.

Playing Light Sided proves you to be The Paragon she always saw in you.
