_"Every generation has a legend. Every journey has a first step. Every saga has a beginning."_

A work that is produced _after_ one installment in a series but, internally, is chronologically set _prior_ to it.

Maybe the last entry in the series left no room for a sequel. Maybe the writers just want to explore the Backstory, Origins Episode, Start of Darkness or what have you. Maybe they want to provide more context to certain elements of previous installments. As they might say, sometimes it's not about the destination...but the journey.

Either way, it may be time for a Prequel (a portmanteau of "pre-" and "sequel"): a sequel that is set chronologically _before_ the previous work. On one hand, this allows for Call Forwards as well as an opportunity to further expand the universe of a work. On the other, the prequel often heavily retcons the backstory, it can have consequences that should have been mentioned in the original story, and it's difficult to keep up the tension when the audience knows how it ends. For example, in the _Star Wars_ prequel trilogy, various characters interact with others they would meet again in the original _Star Wars_ trilogy, but in that film they show no evidence of recognizing them. Because the second _Indiana Jones_ film was a prequel, audiences knew he would survive, and that he wouldn't get to keep the girl. That, however, doesn't mean a prequel can't have big twists or major reveals of their own and may even cast some aspects, if not the entirety, of a previous work in a whole new light.

TV Series usually wrap a prequel in a Whole Episode Flashback. A movie may get a prequel TV series. Sometimes writers will squeeze a story between existing entries in a series, making it both a sequel and a prequel. Prequels are also an easy way to make use of an Expansion Pack World and introduce new conflicts without undermining the resolution of the previous work by introducing an even more ultimate evil. Occasionally said ultimate evil can get their own prequel with a Start of Darkness.

One issue with prequels in electronic media is that if they come out years after the original, you have the problem of technology in Real Life advancing to the point that special effects, graphics, etc. make the prequel look more advanced than the original, which ends up with a Cosmetically-Advanced Prequel. Depending on the series, and the circumstances surrounding it, this can be overlooked, or jarring.

**Remember that a work must be produced _after_ its related installment to be considered a prequel; previous installments do not qualify for the definition. For example, _Rocky_ is not a prequel to _Rocky II_, because _Rocky II_ was both produced and set after the first.**

Is often, but not always, an Origins Episode. Compare Backstory, Flashback and Interquel. Prequel in the Lost Age is a subtrope set in a bygone era mentioned in-universe. If a genuine sequel or interquel is released after the prequel, then it's Anachronic Order.

    Anime & Manga 

-   On its seventh volume, _Arachnid_ introduces an assassin named Imomushi who has her own goal in the story's battle royale. Shortly after, however, she's anti-climatically knocked off the plot and isn't seen again. A spinoff named _Caterpillar_ was then published alongside the main story, showing Imomushi on an adventure of her own a year earlier. After 93 chapters, the story catches up to _Arachnid_ and becomes a P.O.V. Sequel.
-   _Bad Company_ is an Origins Episode prequel to _GTO: The Early Years_ showing how Eikichi and Ryuji first met and became friends.
-   _Saiyuki Gaiden_ is the story of the main four's godly past lives (and in Goku's case, forcibly forgotten childhood). The author acknowledged in the first volume that the ending is obvious for anyone familiar with the main series, and used it to heighten the tension: the audience knew from the very first page that Konzen, Kenren and Tenpou are going to die, and that Goku will lose his memory and spend 500 years imprisoned. What we don't know is how, or when.
-   _Spiral: Alive_ is the prequel to _Spiral: Suiri no Kizuna,_ and mostly focuses on the serial murder of several Blade Children whose existence was missed by the Organization, and what the killer hopes to gain, involving Kiyotaka, Kousuke, Ryoko, Rio, and more.
-   _Codename: Sailor V_ occupies the strange definition of being both a prequel, and the source, of _Sailor Moon_. This is because, though _Sailor V_ came first; most of _Sailor Moon_ came before _Sailor V_ which ran sporadically and wrapped up after _Sailor Moon_ ended.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   Technically, anything that takes place in the Universal Century timeline and was released after _Mobile Suit Victory Gundam_ is this to both it, F91 and Crossbone; some parts of Crossbone itself even count as this to Victory.
    -   The novel _Advance of Zeta_ serves as this to _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_, telling the story of the Titans' test unit.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_ had a manga-only prequel named _Episode Zero_ that showed formative moments from the early lives of the Gundam Pilots and Relena. The stories actually began life as a pair of flashback episodes that had to be cut when scheduling complications arose, and have the benefit of being penned by the show's head writer.
-   _Fist of the Blue Sky_ is a distant prequel to _Fist of the North Star_, set in pre-World War II Asia. It doesn't have much to do with _North Star_, but stars Ryuken's elder brother and predecessor Kasumi Kenshiro, whom the Kenshiro from _North Star_ was named after. The more recent spinoffs of _Fist of the North Star_ are standard prequels and side-stories though, centering around characters from the original series (the 25th anniversary movie _Hokuto no Ken Zero_ is a prequel set a year before the events of the original manga).
-   _Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas_ tells the story of the previous Holy War between Hades and Athena, taking place 250 years before the original series.
-   Around the time the _Ginga Densetsu Weed_ anime was made, a manga was created called _Ginga Densetsu Riki_, the prequel to the 1980s manga and anime _Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin_. This tells about Riki when he was a puppy and encounters his father Shiro.
-   _Legend of the Galactic Heroes_ has two Gaiden series totalling 52 episodes which basically revealed the early military careers of Reinhard von Lohengramm and Yang Wen-li before the start of the series proper.
-   Due to the _Lupin III_ franchise's Negative Continuity, the only way to determine if a story is a Sequel or Prequel is if it is also an Origins Episode. A given episode or chapter cannot even promise if it happened before or after the last episode or chapter.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul: JACK_ takes place 12-years prior to the main story, and focuses on a teenage Kishou Arima.
-   _Handa-kun_ is a gag-comedy prequel to _Barakamon_ that that features the main character's life in high school six years earlier.
-   Osamu Tezuka's works tend to get some dubiously official prequels in order to explain how the main characters ended up the way they did. _Young Black Jack_ fills in the holes of Dr. Black Jack's time in the Japanese medical field and how he came to abandon it, and _Atom: The Beginning_ shows Professor Ochanomizu and Dr. Tenma as young scientists on the path to creating the technology that would one day help create Astro Boy.
-   Like _Sailor V_, _High☆Speed! (2013)_ turned into a strange hybrid of source material and prequel for _Free!_ over its run. The first book came out well before its sequel anime, but the second was released before _Eternal Summer_ and adapted afterwards as a prequel film.
-   _My Hero Academia: Vigilantes_ is a standalone prequel to _My Hero Academia_, set some time shortly before the events of the main series.
-   _Pokémon Journeys: The Series_: The first episode serves as a prequel to the whole _Pokémon: The Series_, also revealing that Ash's Pikachu was a wild Pichu prior to evolving into a Pikachu.
-   _Queen Millennia_: Chronologically, this series takes place generations before _Galaxy Express 999_ and gives a bit of background context for that setting, followed by _Maetel Legend_.
-   _Naruto: The Whorl within the Spiral_ one-shot is a prequel to _Naruto_ focused on Naruto's father, and future Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze.

    Arts 

-   _The Last Supper_: Leonardo da Vinci was tasked with painting something opposite to a depiction of _The Crucifixion_. Knowing that, it's no surprise Leonardo painted _The Last Supper_, where Christ announced his sacrifice through bread and wine.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Mechamato_ is an indirect prequel to _BoBoiBoy_, likely occurring more than a decade before that titular hero was even born, since the show's child protagonist is BoBoiBoy's father as a kid.

    Audio Plays 

-   _Big Finish Doctor Who_:
    -   _Quinnis_, narrated by Susan, takes place on a planet that was a Noodle Incident in the third ever serial.
    -   _Hunters of Earth_, narrated by Carole Ann Ford not as Susan, is set during the period Susan was attending Coal Hill School.
    -   _The Beginning_, narrated by Susan, begins with the Doctor stealing the TARDIS.
    -   _The War Doctor Begins_, starring Jonathon Carley as a nascent version of the late John Hurt's War Doctor, is a prequel to the original series _The War Doctor_, which itself precedes "The Day of the Doctor".

    Comic Books 

-   _Arkham Asylum: Living Hell_ is one. While published in the time frame between "Officer Down" and "Face the Face", it takes place before it (with a footnote even stating that it happened before _Batman: No Man's Land_) and features Jim Gordon, not Michael Akins, as police commissioner yelling at a doctor for releasing an inmate (which given both the "doctor" and the inmate are question are serial killers, with the former even stealing the real doctor's identity, one can't blame him) and Harvey Bullock as a police detective.
-   _Agent 47: Birth of the Hitman_ is an Origins Episode for Diana, 47 and the Shadow Client before they came to meet each other prior to _Hitman: Codename 47_ (or in the case of the Shadow Client, how he's a clone and helped 47 free them from their masters; The Institute). The comic book was released at the end of _Hitman (2016)_, serving as a prequel to the franchise as a whole, and becomes increasingly more relevant to the story arcs of _2016's_ sequels; _Hitman 2_ and _Hitman 3_, which directly callback to this comic series.
-   _Blake and Mortimer_: _Plutarch's Staff_ (released in 2014) is the first story in the continuity of the series (at this point) as it is set in 1944. It tells how Blake joined MI-5, how him and Mortimer met again decades after their Indian adventure during their teens, and features the rising threat of the Yellow Empire while World War II isn't finished yet. _Plutarch's Staff_ ending is actually the beginning of _The Secret of the Swordfish_, making it a direct Prequel.
-   _Disney Kingdoms: Figment_ explores the origins of Disney Theme Parks characters Dreamfinder and Figment.
-   The _ElfQuest_ comics had a number of prequels over the years, most notably _Bearclaw_. The title character was the father of Cutter, the hero of the original series. The _Bearclaw_ series sets up many of the events which occurred before the main story began, and in particular explains the implacable enmity between the human and elf tribes which led to the humans burning the elves out of their forest home at the beginning of _Elfquest #1_.
-   _Fables_ had a prequel in the form of a video game titled _The Wolf Among Us_.
-   _The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck_ works as a prequel to the _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_, telling Scrooge McDuck's life story long before Donald Duck and rest of characters were born.
-   _My Little Pony: The Movie Prequel_ is an unusual case. It's set prior to the events of _My Little Pony: The Movie (2017)_, establishing the major new characters and settings. However, the actual release of the comics predates the film; the first issue was released in June 2017, four months prior to the movie's release.
-   _Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker_ is a prequel to the short film of the same name. It also gives background information that isn't in the short film.
-   _The Smurfs_' limited-edition 50th anniversary story "The Flute Smurfers" is a prequel to the _Johan and Peewit_ story "The Smurfs And The Magic Flute", telling what the magic flute was originally made for. It should be noted, however, that the Smurf Forest in the prequel resembles the flourishing Sugar Bowl forest of the Smurf comic book series more than it does the sparse rock-filled forest of the _Johan And Peewit_ story that chronologically follows it.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: _Knights of the Old Republic_ is an interesting example. Pitched and sold as a prequel to the _Knights of the Old Republic_ video game, the series avoids many typical prequel pitfalls such as Foregone Conclusion, Saved by Canon and having to feature heroes prior to their Character Development by focusing on an entirely different cast with an original plot instead. The game characters that do appear are relegated to supporting roles, and some too-on-the-nose Foreshadowing turned out to be Red Herring to keep the readers on their toes. In the end, the comics share the same setting and hit the required important plot points, but end standing completely on their own, with only a passing knowledge of the game required.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Many comic book prequels explain how things are different after a retcon. For example, _Action Comics_ #158 shows young Clark Kent's life in a different way than _Superman #1_ had. This version was reconned out by _Man Of Steel_, which in turn was displaced by _Superman: Birthright_, _Superman: Secret Origin_ and _Action Comics (New 52)_.
    -   _The Krypton Chronicles_, published forty-three years after the first story featuring Superman, narrates the history of Pre-Crisis Krypton and the House of El since the dawn of Kryptonian civilization.
    -   The whole _Superboy_ 1949 series was a prequel to the mainline series, telling the history of Clark Kent before becoming Superman.
    -   _Superman: Secret Files 2009_ told the story of the beginning of the friendship between Kara Zor-El and Thara Ak-Var, and it is set prior to the events of _New Krypton_ and _Who is Superwoman?_, which introduced Thara.
    -   _Adventure Comics #271:_ How Luthor Met Superboy'' narrated the until then untold story of the first meeting between both characters.
-   _Transformers_
    -   _Beast Wars_ had gotten prequels from _Transformers: Timelines_, in multiple media formats.
        -   The "Dawn of Future's Past" comic book, which takes place just before the first episode of _Beast Wars_ and depicted the Maximals' pursuing of the Predacons that ultimately led to both factions ending up on prehistoric Earth.
        -   "Theft of The Golden Disk", which is an animated short taking place before "Dawn of Future's Past" that serves to explain the circumstances under which Megatron got the Golden Disk.
        -   "The Razor's Edge", a text story made available on the _Transformers_ fan club website that tells of an adventure Airazor went on in her days as Wing Saber, the name she went by before she ended up on prehistoric Earth as one of the protoforms sealed in stasis pods the Maximals and Predacons searched for in the events of the _Beast Wars_ cartoon.
    -   _Transformers: Generation One_: _The War Within_ series happens before the events of the main book, establishing the details of the war between the Autobots and Decepticons before they ended up on Earth.
    -   _The Transformers: Autocracy_, _The Transformers: Monstrosity_ and _The Transformers: Primacy_ are a trilogy of miniseries that serve as prequels to IDW Publishing's _Transformers_ continuity that is part of the Hasbro Comic Universe. The trilogy goes into detail about Optimus Prime's early experiences as a Prime and the Autobots' first clashes with the Decepticons before their war ended up bringing them to Earth.
    -   The Marvel Comics continuity received a prequel in a 2019 one-shot titled _Transformers '84_, which had a Framing Device of Punch narrating the events that led to Optimus Prime and several other Autobots leaving Cybertron in the Ark. The unexpected success of the one-shot led to it being followed the next year by a miniseries titled _Secrets & Lies_, where Punch continued to explain the events that unfolded on Earth and Cybertron after the Ark took flight and before the Autobots and Decepticons aboard the spacecraft were reactivated in the 1980's.
-   _Stardew Valley Before the Farmer_ is this for _Stardew Valley_, as it tells the story of what happened in the valley during the year before the player character arrived.
-   _Star Trek: Early Voyages_: Aside from the series itself being a prequel to _Star Trek: The Original Series_, "Our Dearest Blood" depicts the _Enterprise_'s mission to Rigel VII, a major part of the backstory to "The Cage". This includes Captain Pike's fight with the Kaylar in the abandoned Zemtar fortress, which the Talosians forced him to relive soon after abducting him. It turns out that the dress that the Damsel in Distress Vina wore in this illusion is identical to one actually worn by Talza, the aide of the Rigellian Minister Etashnan. Unlike Vina in the illusion, however, Talza left as soon as the Kaylar began to attack Pike as she had brought him to the fortress so that he could be ambushed.
-   The events of the _Ewoks_ comic book chronologically took place before the events of the cartoon.

    Fan Works 

-   While the fics in the _Eleutherophobia_ series don't all take place in the order they were published, _City of Lost Children_ is set the earliest of all, years before the point of divergence from canon.
-   _From Bajor to the Black_ and "The Universe Doesn't Cheat", for StarSword's series of _Star Trek Online_ fics starring Captain Kanril Eleya. _From Bajor to the Black_ explains how and why Eleya first joined the military and eventually became a Starfleet commanding officer, while "The Universe Doesn't Cheat" has her take the _Kobayashi Maru_.

-   _Triumvirate_ is a prequel to the Elemental Chess Trilogy.
-   _Courtney and the Violin of Despair_ is mostly set at earlier dates than its parent work.
-   _Sunsplit Saga_: The second story, _Sunspawned_, is the prequel to the first story, _Sunsplit_.
-   _Heart of a Lioness: Through the Eyes of a Queen_ begins 20-30 years prior to the first _Lion King_. The first book stars Simba's great-grandparents, the first King and Queen of Pride Rock.
-   _Infinity Train: Knight of the Orange Lily_ (taking place during _Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon_ and some time after the end of Book 2 of _Infinity Train_) starts months before _Infinity Train: Blossoming Trail_ (which takes place sometime before Episode 29 of _Journeys_ and starting just when Book 3 of _Infinity Train_ begins)
-   _Pride Lands Generations_ is a different telling of the Pride Lands' first king. While no set number of years are given for each generation, the main character Dhahabu is Simba's great-great-grandfather, and his father is the actual first Lion King until the final chapters. (Dhahabu is the first to actually rule from Pride Rock, however.)

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Animatrix_, an animated anthology film and prequel to _The Matrix_.
-   _Batman: Mask of the Phantasm_ is generally considered a prequel of _Batman: The Animated Series_ as it tells the story of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. Whether the parts of the movie set in "present" are before, after or during the events of the show is open to fans' interpretation.
-   _The Lion King 1 ½_ is partially a prequel, as it tells a bit of backstory about Timon and Pumbaa, as well as how they met.
-   _Miniforce: New Heroes Rise_ is this to the TV show as it shows how they became the team they are today.
-   _Minions_ reveals before they served Gru by the time of _Despicable Me_, the minions served Scarlet Overkill. This movie's sequel, _Minions: The Rise of Gru_ serves even more as a prequel as it concentrates on Gru, the _Despicable Me_ franchises adult protagonist Gru as a child.
-   Good friends and _Monsters, Inc._ employees Mike and Sulley met each other at _Monsters University_. This is the first, and currently _only_ prequel that Pixar has ever produced.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls Movie_ was a retroactive prequel, converting what was covered in just a couple lines from the Expository Theme Tune into a full movie.
-   _Puss in Boots_ is chronologically set before all of the _Shrek_ movies.
-   The Disney movie _The Sword in the Stone_ is effectively a prequel to King Arthur's reign; it's based on the first quarter or so of the book _The Once and Future King_.
-   Mexican movie _Top Cat Begins_ is the prequel to both _Top Cat: The Movie_ and the show, as it shows how the gang met.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Army of the Dead_ has a German-American prequel film titled _Army of Thieves_, which centers around safecracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer, who also directs).
-   The _wuxia_ film _Ashes of Time_ is a prequel to the novel, _The Legend of the Condor Heroes_, with it's "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue seguing directly to the novel's first chapter.
-   _The Godfather Part II_ is at once a prequel and a sequel to the original film, jumping back and forth between the young Vito at the turn of the century and Michael in the '50s.
-   _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom_ is a prequel to the first film, set one year earlier.
-   The prologue sequence in _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ shows Indy as a boy in the year 1912, featuring the origin of such things as his iconic hat, whip, scar and fear of snakes.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   The entire Prequel Trilogy provides the backstory for Anakin Skywalker's turn to the Dark Side and the formation of the Galactic Empire. Some viewers objected to the way the series has Anakin interact with characters he does not seem to recognize later in the Original Trilogy. The Expanded Universe attempts to retcon some of the discrepancies away.
        -   This despite the fact that Anakin/Vader was in the same scene in both trilogies with only a handful of characters. To wit, Palpatine, Obi Wan, Boba Fett (using a very generous definition of "with"), Tarkin and C3P0. In each case except the last, he does recognize them, with C3P0, well when they meet in Empire Strikes Back, Vader was kind of preoccupied.
        -   The Prequel Trilogy’s films also show a far more advanced galaxy than the Original Trilogy, despite it being over two decades earlier. Justified to an extent as most of the Original trilogy takes place in the galactic boondocks or on Naval Ships while the Prequels are set in the main part of the galaxy. OTH, George Lucas says that was deliberate, as the prequels were a more "civilized age".
    -   _Rogue One_ is a prequel to _A New Hope_, ending very shortly (possibly _minutes_) before the first movie kicks off.
    -   _Solo_ is a prequel to the Original Trilogy featuring the origin story of Han Solo (naturally). It includes the beginning of his friendship with Chewbacca, his history with Lando Calrissian and the Millennium Falcon, and the circumstances of his record-breaking Kessel Run.
-   _Cruel Intentions II_ is a prequel to _Cruel Intentions_.
-   The Tsui Hark movie _A Better Tomorrow III_ was the prequel to the two John Woo movies that would kick off the Heroic Bloodshed genre. It follows Chow Yun-Fat's Mark Gor as he goes to Saigon, falls in love, and develops into the gunslinging badass that we know from _A Better Tomorrow._ And no, he does not keep the girl.
-   Uwe Boll's _House of the Dead_ is actually a prequel to the video games. Its canonicity is disputable.
    -   Likewise with the first two _BloodRaynes_.
-   _Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga_ details Furiosa's story before the events of Mad Max: Fury Road''.
-   _Mallrats_ is set the day before the events in _Clerks_.
-   _The Scorpion King_ is supposed to be a prequel to _The Mummy Returns_, although the fact that there is nothing to indicate that Mathias will turn evil appears to break that connection. However, Word of God is that the Scorpion King featured in _The Mummy Returns_ is actually Mathias's Identical Grandson. It is probably more of a spin-off than a true prequel.
    -   The Direct to Video film _The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior_ is a prequel to _The Scorpion King_, making it a prequel to a prequel.
-   _Paranormal Activity 2_ is (mostly) a prequel to the first film. Its follow-up, _Paranormal Activity 3_, is a prequel to the second film.
-   _Final Destination 5_ isn't explicitly advertised as such, instead opting for a Twist Ending in which the final two survivors of the bridge collapse die in the Flight 180 disaster that started the first film. However, some of the trailers spoiled this by showing new footage of Flight 180.
-   _The Thing (2011)_ is set less than a week before the first movie; it shows how the monster was first discovered and what it did to the Norwegian base.
-   Although the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe are standalone for the most part, their internal chronology makes _Captain America: The First Avenger_ and _Captain Marvel_ prequels as they take place entirely before the events of _Iron Man_.
-   Most people would be surprised if you pointed out that _The Muppet Movie_ was actually a prequel to _The Muppet Show_. Unless they've actually _seen_ them. of course, since it's blindingly obvious that many of the various characters who are friends or at least co-workers of long standing on Show are meeting for the first time in Movie.
-   Both _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_ and _X-Men: First Class_ serve as prequels to the original _X-Men Film Series_ trilogy. _X-Men: Days of Future Past_, meanwhile, is an odd example in that it is both a prequel _and_ a sequel to the original trilogy, concluding with a Cosmic Retcon that deletes the entire trilogy, and probably _Origins: Wolverine_ and _The Wolverine_ also, from the timeline. That means its sequel, _X-Men: Apocalypse_, while still taking place years before the original trilogy, isn't a prequel anymore (if one wants to nitpick very much, it is still _technically_ a prequel, since the ending of _Days_ features the aforementioned retconned timeline set during the original trilogy's time period.
-   In the _Planet of the Apes_ film series: The third, fourth and fifth films of the original series were Prequels to the first two, however; thanks to time travel the third qualifies as both a Prequel (from the Verse's point of view) _and_ a Sequel (from that of the ape characters). Whilst _Rise of the Planet of the Apes_ is officially a Continuity Reboot but works perfectly as a prequel to the original franchise.
-   _Terminator Salvation_ is a bit of an oddball because of the series's heavy use of time travel. It is both a sequel to _Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines_, and a prequel to the events of the original _The Terminator_.
-   _Prometheus_ is described as a "semi-prequel" to the _Alien_ series.
-   _AVP: Alien vs. Predator_ and _Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem_ were also prequels to _Alien_, but in the wake of this new film, their canon it difficult to determine.
-   _Red Dragon_ is a prequel to _The Silence of the Lambs_. The novel had already been adapted to film as _Manhunter_, but the original version did not fit into the film series with Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. The same goes for _Hannibal Rising_.
-   _Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd_ is a prequel to _Dumb and Dumber_.
-   Both _Exorcist: The Beginning_ and _Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist_, Exactly What It Says on the Tin. Prequels to the original film in two different perspectives (of the directors; the former is the result of a complex Executive Meddling for the latter).
-   _Tremors 4: The Legend Begins_ is the fourth and final film in the Tremors series and a prequel to the earlier movies.
-   _The Hobbit_ trilogy is set before _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy. This doesn't apply to the books, though: _The Lord of the Rings_ was a proper sequel.
-   There is no Word of God and it wasn't marketed as such, but _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_, the last movie in the Dollars Trilogy, is a prequel to the other two. It takes place during the The American Civil War (1861–1865), while a grave stone dated 1873 is clearly seen in the first movie(_A Fistful of Dollars_). 'Blondie' also gains the iconic clothes <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  he wears in the two other movies during the last third of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
-   _Cube Zero_ is a prequel to the original _Cube_. The main character suffers the same fate as Kazan from the original, but since they couldn't get the original actor they're only vaguely implied to be the same person. The continuity in this series is already marginal at best due to having different creators for each entry who all had different ideas on what the mythology should be.
-   _Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning_ is a distant prequel to the first _Ginger Snaps_ featuring the apparent ancestors of the Fitzgerald sisters encountering a werewolf in a completely different time period.
-   The western _Nevada Smith_, is a prequel to the _The Carpetbaggers_, a film about the movie industry.
-   _Underworld: Rise of the Lycans_ is the prequel to the rest of the series.
-   _Fantastic Beasts_ is a prequel series to the _Harry Potter_ films. The first is set in 1926 (65 years before _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_), the second is set in 1927, and the third is set in 1932.
-   _Insidious: Chapter 3_ is set before the events of the first film, showing what Elise, Specs, and Tucker were up to before they become involved with the Lamberts.
-   _The Conjuring_ series:
    -   _Annabelle_ is set a year before the titular doll is retrieved by the Warrens in the opening scene of _The Conjuring_.
    -   As the title suggests, _Annabelle: Creation_ shows how the doll came to be and thus predates the previous three films by having a 1955 setting (the first _Annabelle_ is set in 1970).
    -   _The Nun_ is set in 1952, the earliest time period of the series and predating all previous films released.
-   As indicated in the title, _Ouija: Origin of Evil_ details the Start of Darkness of the main villains of _Ouija_, with a setting some fifty years prior.
-   As the events of _Wonder Woman (2017)_ happened before and in the same universe of _Man of Steel_ and _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ then is a prequel of both, though more directly connected to the latter.
-   _Smokin' Aces 2: Assassins' Ball_ takes place prior to _Smokin' Aces_. This doesn't show too much, since the plots are mostly unrelated except for featuring some recurring characters (such as Laslo Zoot and the Tremor family), at least one of whom was killed in the first movie.
-   The original Japanese adaptation of _The Ring_ has a prequel in _Ring 0: Birthday_, an Origins Episode set 30 years prior. The prequel is adapted from a short story of an omnibus novel that among other things includes a plain sequel and an Interquel.
-   _Death Race 2: Frankenstein Lives_ and _Death Race 3: Inferno_, despite being Numbered Sequels, are both prequels to the _Death Race_ remake.
-   _Ophelia_ is a partial example. The first forty or so minutes is set before the beginning of _Hamlet_, covering what happened in the months leading up the king's death (including how Ophelia and Hamlet became a couple). It then segues into the events of the play, albeit with alterations due the story being told from Ophelia's perspective in this version.
-   _Orphan: First Kill_ is a prequel to _Orphan_.

-   _7th Dragon III UE72 Mikan no Yuuma_ by Carlo Zen of _The Saga of Tanya the Evil_ fame is set before _7th Dragon III Code: VFD_.
-   In the _Amber Brown_ series, the _A is for Amber_ books featured rather younger versions of Amber and Justin, before Justin moved away and Amber's parents got divorced.
-   _Assassin's Creed: Underworld_ is a prequel to _Assassin's Creed Syndicate_ starring Henry "The Ghost" Green, the leader of the British Assassins at the time and The Mentor to the Frye Twins.
-   David & Leigh Eddings wrote prequels of their _The Belgariad_ and _The Malloreon_ decalogy, in which all "hidden" details, Noodle Incidents, and Unspoken Plans are explained. Interestingly, the Framing Device was a sequel, where the main characters are asked to write their memories.
-   _La Belle Sauvage_, the first volume of Philip Pullman's _The Book of Dust_, is set ten years before _His Dark Materials_. The remainder of the trilogy is set ten years _afterwards_. Pullman calls the whole thing an "equel".
-   _Bruce Coville's Book of... Magic_: _Wizard's Boy_ is actually one to Coville's earlier story _Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher_ — that book tells, briefly, of how the wizard Bellenmore was the one who helped send the dragons to their new world, and his apprentice Aaron, the title character of this story, is the one who figured out how to save the species by bringing their eggs back to Earth so they could be hatched and then sent to the other world again once they were old enough. This story takes place before those events.
-   Several books in _The Chronicles of Narnia_ series are prequels or interquels to books written before.
    -   This is further complicated by the fact that the prequels assume that the reader is reading the books in the _published_ order. _The Magician's Nephew_, for example, is the first novel (chronologically speaking, but the 6th in the publishing order), but unless one has read _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ (the 2nd novel chronologically speaking), one can miss a lot of the subtext and the deeper meanings worked into the novel.
    -   While the author and most experts agree that you should read them in order of release rather than chronology, the publisher continues to insist on numbering them in chronological order, further confusing new readers.
    -   Complicating matters is the fact that the events of Book 5 are in fact taking place during the final chapter of Book 1.
-   When Jennifer Fallon was writing the prequels to her _Demon Child_ series, she had a large board labelled "These People Must Die" next to her desk, indicating characters she had to kill off before the end of the prequel series in order to avoid having to explain their absence in the original series.
-   The _Divergent_ trilogy is followed by four Four-centric short stories, three of which focus on him as a Dauntless initiate, 2 years before the events of the main series (the other is a P.O.V. Sequel of the first book). All were later collected in the _Four: A Divergent Collection_ omnibus.
-   In the _Doctor Who Expanded Universe_, the novella _Time and Relative_ by Kim Newman is set shortly before "An Unearthly Child". There are also about ten short stories in the _Short Trips_ series set prior to the TARDIS landing in Totter's Lane.
-   _Dragon Age_: The novels _The Stolen Throne_ and _The Calling_ are prequels to _Dragon Age: Origins_. The former deals with the liberation of Ferelden from under the boot of the Orlesian Empire, while the latter introduces the Expansion Pack, explains how the Grey Wardens were allowed back into Ferelden, and hints at the origins of a major character.
-   _Dragons of Requiem_ has the _Dawn of Dragons_ trilogy, which was released three years after the original trilogy. It takes place three thousand years before _Song of Dragons_ and shows who founded and built Requiem, and how the Vir Requis united as a whole.
-   _The Dresden Files_: _Brief Cases_ has "A Fistful of Warlocks", detailing Anastasia Luccio's pursuit of a warlock in the Wild West in the late 19th century. It also features a guest appearance by the necromancer Heinrich Kemmler, who is very, very dead in the series' present.
-   _Dusty Revenge_ have a prequel, _Dusty Raging Fist_, released four years after the original but set a decade before. The titular rabbit protagonist managed to obtain Elemental Powers in the prequel, but thanks to Bag of Spilling lose his abilities after the final battle where the original game have him restored to his Badass Normal state.
-   _The Evolution of Claire_: A novel that takes place eleven years prior to the events of _Jurassic World_ which follows the character of Claire Dearing in her first year of internship for Masrani Global.
-   _Fate/Zero_ is a series of novels that detail the events leading up to famous Visual Novel _Fate/stay night_. Considering the relatively short timespan between the two story-wise (ten years), much of the events in _Zero_ had a significant impact on _stay night_.
-   Isaac Asimov:
    -   "The Psychohistorians": This Short Story was added retroactively when _Foundation (1951)_ was published, to begin the _Foundation_ series at \-2 Foundation Era, compared to 50 F.E. of "The Encyclopedists". Year 1 is when the planet Terminus is colonized by the Encyclopedia Foundation.
    -   _Preludeto Foundation_: This book is a prequel to his original Foundation trilogy.
    -   _The Stars, Like Dust_: This book is a follow-up to _Pebble in the Sky_, still taking place in a far future where the Earth has become radioactive, but before the Trantorian Empire becomes relevant to the region of space it takes place in. This was followed by _The Currents of Space_, which takes place after _The Stars, Like Dust_ but before _Pebble in the Sky_ at a point when the Trantorian Empire's galactic dominance is in sight, but still distant enough that it hasn't renamed itself as the Galactic Empire it was in _Pebble in the Sky_.
-   Jack Campbell's _The Genesis Fleet_ series is set in the same universe as his _The Lost Fleet_ books, but centuries earlier, during the formation of The Alliance. In the _Vanguard_ novel, the recent invention of the jump drive has rapidly sped up the expansion of humanity into the galaxy. However, Old Earth's influence is waning, and the once mighty Earth fleet is being decommissioned. Even the old colonies are no longer the beacon of civilization they once were. The new colonies must fend for themselves in the face of pirates, slavers, and hostile colonies. The novel is focused on a number of characters, two of which appear to be the ancestors of key characters from the main series: Lieutenant Robert Geary of the recently-settled Glenlyon (in fact, the colony isn't even named at the start of the book) and Sergeant Dominic Desjani (although he doesn't appear until about two thirds of the way into the book) of the slightly more established Kosatka. Glenlyon finds itself the target of an expansionist militant colony called Scatha and, with no defense forces to speak of, must figure out a way to survive, its leaders realizing that colonies in similar situations must band together for common protection. The third and final novel of the prequels ends with the formation of the building blocks of the Alliance. The Distant Finale returns to just after the main series, with the two main characters discussing their ancestors and their roles in creating the Alliance.
-   Joanne Harris's _The Gospel of Loki_ serves as a prequel to her earlier fantasy novels _Runemarks_ and _Runelight_. However, as a lifelong Norse Mythology fan, Harris likely worked out the basic plot of _Gospel_ long before writing the other two books, much as Tolkien did with _The Silmarillion_ and the hobbit books.
-   Several _Halo_ novels serve as this, including _Halo: The Fall of Reach_ and _Halo: Contact Harvest_; the former focuses on the SPARTAN-II program, while the latter focuses on Sergeant Johnson and first contact with the Covenant. Another example is the _The Forerunner Saga_ trilogy, a distant prequel that takes place during the time of the Forerunners.

-   _Horatio Hornblower_: The first book published, _The Happy Return_ (_Beat to Quarters_ in some regions) was intended as a stand-alone novel, but later became part of a multi-book arc (_Ship of the Line_, _Flying Colours_, _The Commodore_ and _Lord Hornblower_). _Hornblower and the Atropos_, _Hornblower and the Hotspur_, _Lieutenant Hornblower_ and _Midshipman Hornblower_, as well as the short stories _The Hand of Destiny_ and _Hornblower and the Widow McCool_ all take place before the events of _The Happy Return_.
-   _The House of Night_:
    -   _Dragon's Oath_, about Dragon's past and his relationship with Anastasia.
    -   _Lenobia's Vow_, about Lenobia's past.
    -   _Neferet's Curse_, which relates Neferet's past.
-   _The Kharkanas Trilogy_ is a prequel to the _Malazan Book of the Fallen_, set in The Time of Myths and telling an important part of the setting's backstory. It originally seemed like there was no need for a prequel as the backstory is covered quite extensively in the main series, however it turns out that a few millennia of time can change what actually happened into myths hardly related to the truth anymore. So even knowing how events eventually play out, _how_ things ended up the way they did is a wholly different matter, sometimes overturning supposedly known facts without actually contradicting them.
-   Before _Narnia_ there were James Fenimore Cooper's _Leatherstocking Tales_, published in this order: 4, 2, 5, 3, 1.
-   Sergey Lukyanenko:
    -   _Dances on the Snow_ takes place about a century prior to the events of _Genome_, the first novel of the series. However, the author insists that _Genome_ should still be read first, even though the novels target completely different issues (Designer Babies in _Genome_, clones in _Dances on the Snow_) and don't feature any of the same characters (except for one mentioned off-hand).
    -   Lukyanenko's short story _Shadows of Dreams_ is a prequel to _Line of Delirium_, as it describes one of Arthur's previous failed attempts to get to Grail with a teenage girl as his bodyguard. The latter is not revealed until the end of the short story, though.
-   By the same token, _Mass Effect: Revelation_ is a prequel to the first _Mass Effect_ game, revealing the history between Captain Anderson and Saren, as well as how Saren found _Sovereign_.
-   _The Kill Order_ and _The Fever Code_ are both prequels to the main trilogy of _The Maze Runner_ series, taking focus to the background story and lore. The former tells the story of the first outbreak of the Zombie Apocalypse approximately a decade before the events at the Glade, while the latter is a direct prequel to the first book.
-   _Left Behind_ had a three-book prequel series following the twelve-book main series: _The Rising_, _The Regime_, and _The Rapture_, which all tell of events that took place up to the start of the main series, such as the rise of the Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia as well as the lives of future Tribulation Force members Rayford and Chloe Steele and Buck Williams.
-   _The Mortal Instruments_ series has one completed prequel series (_The Infernal Devices_) and one still in development (_The Last Hours_), both being set more than a century before the events of the main series. Plus, some of the novella collections (particularly, _The Bane Chronicles_) have stories predating _TMI_, as well.
-   Most of Anthony Price's thriller novels form a sequence set in the present day (i.e. the 1970s and '80s, contemporary with when they were written), but four of them are prequels set in the 1940s and '50s, exploring the roots of the main sequence protaonists and the organisation they work for.
-   _Reign of the Seven Spellblades_: The Spin-Off volume _Side of Fire: Chronicle of Purgatory_ is set three years before the start of the main series and expands on the backstory of Alvin Godfrey, Leoncio Echevalria, and the rivalry between their respective student body factions, which forms a major part of several volumes of the main series.
-   _Jack Ryan_:
    -   _Without Remorse_ covers the backstory for John Clark formerly Kelly, set before Jack Ryan, Sr becomes an adult.
    -   _Patriot Games_ occurs before _The Hunt for Red October_, in which there are a few off-hand references to PG's events.
    -   _Red Rabbit_ takes a step back to the very start of Jack Ryan, Sr's involvement with the US government, though was published after _Executive Orders_.
-   In John Masefield's _Sard Harker_, the protagonist's backstory includes him having once played a small but important role in a rebellion in South America. Masefield's later novel _Odtaa_ is set during the rebellion.
-   _Shannara_ by Terry Brooks:
    -   _First King of Shannara_ is the prequel to _The Sword of Shannara Trilogy_. It was written decades after that series was published. Even the trilogy's _sequel_ series (_The Heritage of Shannara_) had been published before the _First King of Shannara_ came out. As with the Narnia novels, it's best to actually read the _Sword of Shannara_ and perhaps even the _Heritage of Shannara_ novels before reading the prequel, as it assumes knowledge and therefore acts as a spoiler to the original novels (_The Sword of Shannara_ especially).
    -   _The Genesis of Shannara_ is set even earlier; the Apocalypse How to the After the End setting of the main series. It also canon welds Brooks' Urban Fantasy series _The Word and the Void_, retroactively making them _Shannara_ prequels as well.
-   _The Silmarillion_ is an example of how good some of these can be. None of the foreshadowing starts till the end of the Quenta Silmarillion, with _Akallabêth_ and _On the Rings of Power and the Third Age_.
    -   Not a wholly straightforward example though, since Tolkien started writing _The Silmarillion_ long before he wrote _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ (in fact, _The Hobbit_ was not initially part of the same continuity) _and_ continued afterwards. Consider also that the main events of _The Silmarillion_ are set thousands of years before _The Lord of the Rings_ (though a few characters are still in both.) _Akallabêth_ and _On the Rings of Power..._ are (admittedly long) epilogues to the main narrative, with the latter bringing the action to the time of _LOTR_.
    -   Especially true because Tolkien didn't actually write _The Silmarillion_ ... he wrote a **lot** of background material for _LOTR_, in many drafts and revisions, and then used tiny fragments of them in _LOTR_ to suggest that it had its own tales and legends. After he died his son pieced together a mostly-consistent narrative out of the background material and published it. Then he started publishing the _Unfinished Tales_ series, which were various drafts of stuff that _didn't_ get used in _The Silmarillion_ (many of these being earlier drafts of pieces that _did_ get used; confused yet?).
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   The _Tales of Dunk and Egg_ novellas of are set hundred years before the main series. They portray the golden age of House Targaryen and feature many "legendary" characters from the main series, and links between the books have surfaced, including the Myth Arc relating to "The Prince That Was Promised" and the revelation in _A Dance with Dragons_ of Lord Bloodraven, a supporting character in the earlier series alive in the present.
    -   _Archmaester Gyldayn's Histories_ are another series of novellas going back even further to a Civil War known as the Dance of the Dragons that took place 70 years before Dunk and Egg and 170 years before the main series. _The Rogue Prince_ takes place before _The Princess and the Queen_, making it a prequel of a prequel.
-   The _Star Trek: Terok Nor_ novel trilogy; _Deep Space Nine_ prequels set during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor.
-   _Star Wars Expanded Universe_:
    -   _Master and Apprentice_ is set before _The Phantom Menace_, covering Obi-Wan's apprenticeship to Qui-Gon.
    -   _Queen's Peril_ is a prequel to both _The Phantom Menace_, set at the very beginning of Padmé's reign as Queen of Naboo, and its predecessor novel _Queen's Shadow_, which starts at the _end_ of Padmé's time as queen.
    -   Timothy Zahn's _Ascendancy Trilogy_ is a prequel to his new-canon trilogy about Grand Admiral Thrawn (_Thrawn_, _Alliances_, _Treason_), about Thrawn's time serving the Chiss Ascendancy.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: Timothy Zahn wrote _Outbound Flight_ before he came up with the idea for the later-set _Survivor's Quest_, but due to scheduling _Survivors' Quest_ was released first, resulting in a situation like this.
-   _The Tale of Little Pig Robinson_ by Beatrix Potter explains that Pig Robinson is actually the "piggy-wig" in Edward Lear's "The Owl and the Pussycat", and this is the story of how he ended up in the Land Where the Bong Tree Grows.
-   _The Tale Of Magic_ is this to _The Land of Stories_. It takes place when the main characters’ grandmother was a teenager.
-   _Third Maccabees_ from the apocryphal books of the Maccabees is an In Name Only prequel story, as it has nothing to do with Judah Maccabee or The Maccabean Revolt, but rather an early persecution of the Jews that took place in the 3rd Century BC.
-   Wolfram von Eschenbach's unfinished epic poem _Titurel_ was a prequel to his _Parzival_.
-   _Tortall Universe_: The _Beka Cooper_ trilogy is set nearly 200 years before the rest of the series, and features main protagonist Beka Cooper, who's the ancestor of other characters George and Aly. While the main plot is very much self-contained, it does show a bit about how Tortall came to be the way it is, including the outlawing of slavery and the decline of the female knights.
-   _When The Tripods Came_, the prequel to _The Tripods_ trilogy.
-   _The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor_ is a prequel to the comic book series _The Walking Dead_.
-   _Warrior Cats_ began doing prequels with several standalone Super Editions taking place a generation or two before the first series, a time period that is now often nicknamed the "prequel era". Some novellas have expanded upon this time period, as well as a generation or two before _that_. Later, the fifth arc _Warrior Cats: Dawn of the Clans_ came out; it's a prequel about the founding of the Clans, set at least a few decades before the modern books.
-   _New Spring_ is a prequel to _The Wheel of Time_ series, taking place about 20 years before _The Eye of the World_. What's particularly jarring is that it's actually a lot better written than the previous few books.
-   _Woodwalkers And Friends_: _Katzige Gefährten_ is one to _Seawalkers_. It shows what Carag and Tikaani did in the gap between Tag der Rache and Gefährliche Gestalten\- Foregone Conclusion obviously ensues, because both of them are revealed to be alive in _Seawalkers_ which was released a year before this book.

    Live-Action TV 

### **In General:**

-   _Smallville_ and _Gotham_ are prequels of the Superman and Batman mythos respectively.
    -   _Krypton_ is another prequel to the Superman mythos. The series takes place on the titular planet 200 years before its destruction and Kal-El's arrival on Earth. The protagonist is his grandfather Seg-El.

### **Series:**

-   The 1998 TV film _Babylon 5: In The Beginning_ is a prequel to _Babylon 5_, which depicts the Earth-Minbari War (2245-2248), a major part of the series' backstory. Its storyline explores the involvement, direct and indirect, of numerous regular characters in the war, including Sheridan, Sinclair, Delenn, Londo, G'Kar, Franklin and Ivanova. The major exception is Garibaldi, who was said to have served as a Ground Pounder (GROPO) during the war in "The Long Dark". The Framing Device, which ties into the future sequences of "War Without End Part 2" featuring a devastated Centauri Prime, takes place in 2278. It involves the elderly Londo, the Emperor of the Centauri Republic, telling two young children and their nanny of humanity's heroism during the Earth-Minbari War and how it inspired the Babylon Project, the last, best hope for peace. The film ties into several other episodes as well such as "And the Sky, Full of Stars", "A Late Delivery from Avalon" and "Atonement".
-   _Better Call Saul_ is a prequel to _Breaking Bad_ and focuses on the life of Amoral Attorney Saul Goodman seven years before he first met Walter White. At the time Saul still goes by his birth name of Jimmy McGill and has yet to have his Start of Darkness that would make him such a key player in the Heisenberg saga. Similarly, Mike Ehrmantraut has just arrived in Albuquerque and has yet to embark on his career as a criminal fixer.
-   _Black Sails_ is a prequel to _Treasure Island_. It shows how Captain Flint got the _Urca_ gold and why he put it on Treasure Island. It also provides backstory for various characters from the book, including Long John Silver, Billy Bones, Israel Hands and Ben Gunn.
-   _Caprica_ is a rare example of a prequel TV series (to _Battlestar Galactica_). The prequel is so far separated in time (it begins 58 years before _BSG_) that only one character, William Adama, is shared between them—and while he was unquestionably the male lead in _BSG_, he's a secondary (if important) character in _Caprica_ (and the vast time difference makes things, if anything, _more_ interesting: How does he go from Willie Adama, gangster-in-training, to William "The Old Man" Adama, hardened officer of the Colonial Fleet?).
    -   He doesn't. He dies, and his father has another son with his second wife whom they name William. He is the one who will become "The Old Man".
-   There's a very popular, long-running Italian police-detective show, _Il Commissario Montalbano_. In 2012, the spinoff _Young Montalbano_ appeared alongside it, about Montalbano as a young man.
-   _The Continental_ is a prequel series to the _John Wick_ films. It follows a young Winston Scott as he begins his journey to become the manager of the New York City Continental Hotel
-   The 1986 TV film _Dallas: The Early Years_ is a prequel to _Dallas_ which explores the origins of the Barnes-Ewing feud in the 1930s. The Framing Device takes place in 1951 and features J.R. as a teenager and Bobby, Cliff, Pam and Gary as young children.
-   _The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance_ is a prequel series to the 1982 Jim Henson film _The Dark Crystal_, detailing how the depraved Skeksis came to be at war with the Gelflings and caused the world of Thra to decay.
-   _Dickensian_, a Massive Multiplayer Crossover of all Charles Dickens's characters is set prior to the novels (with, the writer admits, some fudging of dates). So Ebeneezer Scrooge is still a miser, Miss Havisham is a young woman who's just met Compeyson, Inspector Bucket has just become a detective, and so on.
-   _Fear the Walking Dead_ depicts the very beginning of the Zombie Apocalypse that _The Walking Dead (2010)_ takes place in the aftermath of (albeit thousands of miles away).
-   _House of the Dragon_ is a distant prequel to _Game of Thrones_, taking place 200 years before it and chronicling the downfall of House Targaryen.
-   _Inspector Morse_ has spawned the prequel series _Endeavour_, about the young Morse (as well as a sequel series, _Lewis_, starring Morse's sergeant/sidekick). This allows more stories about Morse on TV, even though both the character and the actor have died.
-   The events of _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_ are set before _The Lord of the Rings_.
-   _Prime Suspect 1973_ is a prequel to _Prime Suspect_, about WPC Jane Tennison at the beginning of her career dealing with even more sexism than she will as DCI Jane Tennison.
-   _Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story_ was produced after _Bridgerton_ and shows the youth of Queen Charlotte, before she became one of the ton's most formidable figures.
-   _Rock & Chips_ (originally announced as _Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Chips_), a prequel to _Only Fools and Horses_ which is set in 1960, and tells the story of Joan and Freddie the Frog. It's a bit of a Genre Shift, being a rather downbeat drama with some laughs rather than the traditional sitcom of the original (and _The Green Green Grass_).
-   The _Dirty Harry_ parody TV series _Sledge Hammer!_ ended its first season by blowing up Los Angeles, since the producers were expecting the series be canceled. When, much to their surprise, the series was picked up for a second season, they had to set it five years before the finale and called it _Sledge Hammer: The Early Years_.
-   The mini-series _Spartacus: Gods of the Arena_ is the prequel of _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_, sadly made because the main actor suffered from cancer (that eventually caused his death) and therefore the producers have to made something without him to entertain the audience in the hopes he would recover. He didn't, so they went for The Other Darrin route.
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise_, which is set 100 years before Kirk's time period. _Star Trek: Discovery_ is more of an Interquel, being set between _Enterprise_ and TOS. _Discovery_ itself has a spinoff, _Star Trek: Strange New Worlds_, in the timeframe of the original Pilot Episode of TOS.
-   _Walker: Independence_, set in the 1800s is a prequel to _Walker_ focused on Cordell Walker's ancestor, Abby Walker.
-   _The Winchesters_, which focuses on John and Mary Winchesters, is a _Supernatural_ prequel set in the 1970s.
-   _Young Hercules_, a prequel TV series to _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_ with a young _Ryan Gosling_ portraying a much younger version of Kevin Sorbo's title character.
-   _Young Hyacinth_ was a one-off prequel to _Keeping Up Appearances_, explaining how Hyacinth's snobbish pretensions were formed when she was in domestic service to the local gentry in the 1950s.
-   _The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles_, a prequel TV series featuring stories from Indiana Jones' early life in Anachronic Order. The majority of episodes depicted Indy as a young man, set during his experiences in World War One and in the years after; the rest were about Indy as a boy, while on an extended journey around the world.
-   _Young Sheldon_ is a prequel to _The Big Bang Theory_ that focuses on Sheldon Cooper's childhood.

    Multimedia 

-   The entire 2004-'05 saga of _BIONICLE_, including the _Adventures_ novel series, comics, online videos and the films _Legends of Metru Nui_ and _Web of Shadows_ take place 1,000 years before the 2001-'03 saga, detailing the struggles of the Toa Metru/Hordika before they became the Turaga of Mata Nui and how the Matoran of Metru Nui ended up on the island of Mata Nui in the first place. Technically, the 2005 story was an interquel set just before the ending of the 2004 plot, but it contained yet more flashbacks in comics and short stories. The original plan was to have even more prequel arcs, the _Legends of Metru Nui_ film was actually set up as the finale of a whole series of prequel movies revealing the origin and Face–Heel Turn of Makuta, but those plans were scrapped after LEGO executives realized the new timeline confused children. Thus, later prequel materials were sprinkled into the novels, short stories and one graphic novel.

    Music 

-   Noah's music video for "Kota Mati" is a prequel to their old "Tak Ada yang Abadi" video back when they were named Peterpan, showing how the people ends up dead in the latter video and who is the shooter.

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Achilleid_ is set ten years before _The Iliad_ and promises to explain how Achilles became a hero of legend. We see Achilles' training under Chiron, Thetis' first attempts to avert her son's destined death, and even the first meeting of Achilles and the Hero of Another Story, Ulysses.

    Radio 

-   Parodied in one _I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue_ round, which proposes such prequels as _Alice Lives Here_, _Too Much Cheese Before Bedtime on Elm Street_, _The Empire Gets Struck_ and _Taking the Long Way Round, Avoiding the River Kwai_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _Legend of the Five Rings_ CCG featured two prequel sets: _Scorpion Clan Coup_, about the events that set the Clan War in motion, and _Dawn of the Empire_, which finally put the legendary gods and heroes of Rokugan's founding into CCG form.

    Theatre 

-   While _Oedipus the King_ is chronologically the first play of Sophocles' Theban trilogy, is was the second in production order, making this trope Older Than Feudalism.
-   William Shakespeare did it too. The second history tetralogy (_Richard II_, _Henry IV_ (1&2), and _Henry V_) were prequels to the first history tetralogy (_Henry VI_ (1,2&3) and _Richard III_). And even those probably weren't written in order either; _Henry VI_ 2, 3, and _Richard III_ are almost one long play in three parts, the first part of _Henry VI_ may well have been written a few years later.
-   _Another Part of the Forest_ by Lillian Hellman was a prequel to her play _The Little Foxes_ set 20 years earlier.
-   Cirque du Soleil's _Toruk — The First Flight_ is the prequel to _Avatar_, retelling the story of the first Toruk Makto (an individual who manages to tame and ride a toruk in a time of great peril for the Na'vi) in the 9th century BC. The Tree of Souls is threatened by a volcanic eruption, and the Omaticaya clan sends a brave young hunter to gather the five items he needs in order to tame the toruk and and use the creature as a symbol to unite the clans and save the Tree. The hunter, Ralu, fails, but his friend Entu, a failed hunter, succeeds. The clans manage to rally even without the Toruk Makto, but their efforts to save the tree prove futile. Then Entu appears on the back of the toruk, and the creature manages to put out the flames, dying during the act. The Storyteller then reveals that _he_ is Entu. There is some discontinuity there, as the Storyteller appears to be telling all this to the Sky People (i.e. humans), except humans didn't make it to Pandora until the 22nd century. It's highly doubtful that Entu has lived for so long.

    Video Games 

-   _Act Raiser 2_ is hinted to be a prequel to the first _ActRaiser_.
-   COPS 2170 The Power Of Law is a Prequel to _Paradise Cracked_.
-   _The Legend of Oasis_, known in Europe as _The Story of Thor 2_, is a prequel to the first _The Story of Thor_, known as _Beyond Oasis_ in North America.
-   _The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard_ and _The Elder Scrolls Online_ take place during the Second Era, hundreds of years before the main entries in _The Elder Scrolls_.
-   _Ever Quest Online Adventures_ takes place 500 years before the first _Everquest_.
-   _Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals_ serves as a prequel, starring the hero that appeared in the prologue and was the ancestor of the Player Character in _Lufia & The Fortress of Doom_.
-   In _Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis_ the main villain is a Soviet general called Guba, and one of the protagonists is a US special forces soldier by the name of Gastovski. The expansion pack _Resistance_ features a new campaign set three years earlier, in which then-colonel Guba leads the Soviet invasion of a different island than those featured in the original game, and Gastovski is there to lend the locals a hand. Naturally, there are zero references to this earlier armed conflict in the original game.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_ practically runs on this trope. Only _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_ and the _Breath of the Wild_ trilogy occur chronologically after the original game, with all the others being either prequels, sequels to those prequels, or take place on concurrent Alternate Timelines.
    -   _A Link to the Past_ was originally envisioned as a distant prequel to _The Legend of Zelda_. That remains the case, but as of 2020, there are five other games that take place during that timespan; three direct sequels to ALTTP (_Oracle of Ages/Seasons_ and _Link's Awakening_) and two distant sequels featuring their own version of Link (_A Link Between Worlds_ and _TriForce Heroes_).
    -   _Skyward Sword_ is chronologically the first game in the series, serving as an origin story for the Master Sword, the Kingdom of Hyrule, and even why evil is always able to rear its ugly head again and again, particularly with regards to Ganon's inability to stay fully dead.
    -   _The Minish Cap_, chronologically the second game in the series, is the prequel to _Four Swords_, explaining the origins of both the Four Swords and Vaati.
    -   _Ocarina of Time_ was created to serve as a distant prequel to _A Link to the Past_ and it still retains that status, with no other games taking place between them. That said, _Ocarina of Time_ is also where the three main Alternate Timelines of the series originate.
    -   _Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity_ is a Spin-Off entry in terms of gameplay, but a canonical prequel (well, given the events of the game, psuedo-prequel) to _Breath of the Wild_, making it the first _Zelda_ game to be a prequel with the same Link.
-   _Tales of Symphonia_ takes place thousands of years before _Tales of Phantasia_, the game it precedes, and this is only known through references in the game, rather than being explicitly stated... such as the two worlds having the same names as the two moons of Aseria in _Phantasia_, the existence of Martel who guards a giant tree named Yggdrasill, the world maps in _Symphonia_ being that of _Phantasia_ split in two, Suzu and Sheena Fujibayashi, the Eternal Sword, discrimination against half-elves (although it's not as big a plot point in _Phantasia_ as it was in _Symphonia_), Magitek flying machines (the Techbirds of _Phantasia_ and the Rheairds of _Symphonia_ have very similar designs, and in both games powering them up involves gaining the aid of the lightning summon spirit Volt).
-   _Dragon Quest_:
    -   In _Dragon Quest III_, you play what appears to be a standalone game in the series, only towards the end you end up in an alternate universe — the universe of _Dragon Quest_ and _Dragon Quest II_. Only it's hundreds of years before _I_. At the end of the game, your hero is given the title of Loto (Erdrick in the original US translation) — which is the name of the legendary hero that the _Dragon Quest_ character is descended from...
    -   The second trilogy (_IV_, _V_, and _VI_) also appear to follow this format, though much more ambiguously.
    -   The ending of _Dragon Quest XI_ reveals that it takes place in the distant past of _Dragon Quest III_'s world, as shown by the Hero of that game's mother reading about the story in an old book, before getting up to wake up her child to see the king.
-   Infocom's Interactive Fiction game _Zork Zero_ is, as the name implies, a prequel to the company's previous Zork and Enchanter trilogies.
-   _S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky_ is a prequel to _S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl_.
-   _Fallout 76_ takes place 59 years before the original _Fallout_ in the year 2102, although Super Mutants are still present despite the Master not having created them until the following year and the Institute ones not being created until over a century later.
-   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ is a prequel to the entire series and details the backstory and Start of Darkness of Big Boss, and was followed with _Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops_, _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_ and finally _Metal Gear Solid V_ (with _V_ having a closing scene teasing _Metal Gear_).
    -   Ordered by canon chronology, the central plot thread is as follows: _MGS3_, _Portable Ops_, _Peace Walker_, _MGSV_, _Metal Gear_, _Metal Gear 2_, _Metal Gear Solid_, _Metal Gear Solid 2_, and (finally) _Metal Gear Solid 4_.
-   _Street Fighter_ is pretty bad about this. After the constant updates of _Street Fighter II_, the _Street Fighter Alpha_ series arrived onto the scene in 1995, with the purpose of fleshing out the backstory by... showing what happened in between the original _Street Fighter_/_Final Fight_ and _Street Fighter II_. After _Street Fighter III_ (as well as _2nd Impact_ and _3rd Strike_) came and went, _Street Fighter IV_ comes out and... it takes place after _II_ and before _III_. _Street Fighter V_ would later continue the trend by being set after _IV_... but _still_ before _III_.
-   Most media associated with _Final Fantasy VII_ (also known as the _Compilation of Final Fantasy VII_) take place before the titular game. In fact, the franchise only has one video game sequel, _Dirge of Cerberus_, which is set a few years after the ending of the game.
    -   _Before Crisis_ is set six years before _VII_, with the focus shifting to a brand of villains that got retconned.
    -   _Crisis Core_ is set four years before _VII_ and explores about an important Posthumous Character who influenced that game's main protagonist. The ending even outright sequences into the opening of _VII_.
-   _Dissidia Final Fantasy_ gets _Dissidia 012: Final Fantasy_, which takes place on the previous iteration of the "Groundhog Day" Loop. Also, the series is technically a prequel to the first _Final Fantasy_, as the game's setting is revealed to be a copy of that game's world ("World B", as opposed to "World A"). The ending shows the Warrior of Light setting up for another adventure in World A (the first game's storyline), with other heroes returning back to their own homeworlds.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
    -   _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_ takes place roughly ten years before the events of the first game. The secret ending includes a Distant Finale that takes place right after _Kingdom Hearts II_.
    -   _Kingdom Hearts χ_ not only takes place long before every other game, including _Birth by Sleep_, but immediately before the Keyblade War which made the universe the way it is throught the rest of the series.
-   _Devil May Cry_ series:
    -   _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_ is a prequel to the first _Devil May Cry_ game.
    -   _Devil May Cry 4_ used to be considered a prequel as it originally took place before _Devil May Cry 2_, following the original Anachronic Order of the games (_3_ -> _1_ -> _4_ -> _2_) in such a way that _DMC2_ was still the last distant game in the lore. However, the release and marketing of _Devil May Cry 5_ retconned the chronology into swapping _2_ and _4_, no longer making the latter game a prequel.
-   _Castlevania_ had its first game set in 1691, but there have been games set before this time. And a shitload of sequels/interquels. So much so that the main climax isn't even a game yet! Chronologically, the main timeline begins with _Castlevania: Lament of Innocence_, which is set in 1094 and depicts the origins of Dracula, Vampire Killer and the Belmont Clan.
-   _Assassin's Creed:_
    -   _Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles_ is a prequel to _Assassin's Creed_.
    -   _Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag_ is a prequel to _Assassin's Creed III_ that shows the life of Connor's grandfather Edward Kenway. Technically, however, it's still a sequel, since the modern day storyline takes place 20 Minutes into the Future, and the lives of the Kenways are only recordings that are simply viewed out of order.
    -   By that same token, _Assassin's Creed Rogue_ could also be considered a prequel of _Assassin's Creed III_, since the events deal with the fall of the Colonial Assassins some time before Connor meets Achilles.
    -   And now there's _Assassin's Creed Origins_, which portrays the founding of the Assassin Brotherhood in Ptolemaic Egypt as the Hidden Ones by Bayek of Siwa and his wife Aya.
    -   _Assassin's Creed: Odyssey_ goes even further back in time than any of the previous installments in the franchise as it's set in the Peloponnesian War between 431 and 422 BC, around 400 years before the events of _Origins_.
    -   _Assassin's Creed: Valhalla_ is set three centuries before the Third Crusade of _Assassin's Creed I_.
-   _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_ is a prequel to _Deus Ex_ and _Deus Ex: Invisible War_. _Deus Ex: Mankind Divided_ is a sequel to _Human Revolution_ and the second prequel to the original _Deus Ex_.
-   According to Word of God, _Nexus: The Jupiter Incident_ is an unofficial prequel to the _Imperium Galactica_ series, as it was originally planned as _Imperium Galactica III: Genesis_ before getting stuck in Development Hell and switching developers and publishers several times. The basic storyline has not changed from the original, though.
-   _I Miss the Sunrise_ expands on and explains the shocking Sequel Hooks dropped at the end of _The Reconstruction_.
-   The mod/scenario _Fall from Heaven: Age of Ice_, included in _Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword_, is a prequel to the popular mod _Fall From Heaven II_. The original mod is set in the fantasy world of Erebus at the start of the Age of Rebirth. The prequel scenario shows how the previous age (the Age of Ice) was ended by a hero unifying a scattered tribe and vanquishing a god.
-   _Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist_ is a prequel to _Leisure Suit Larry_, set in The Wild West. Zircon Jim Laffer is an ancestor of Larry Laffer.
-   _Child of Eden_ is said to be a prequel to _Rez_, although some call it a spiritual sequel.
-   _Halo: Reach_: Since the game retells a well-known catastrophe in the franchise's backstory, much of the plot and marketing played on the drama of the Foregone Conclusion.
-   _Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak_ is a prequel to the original _Homeworld_. The game expands the backstory of Kharak, and how the search for the starship wasn't a simple ride into the desert. But a long grueling war where the Kiithid of the North fought a long bloody war against the Gaalsiens over the ruins of the starship.
-   The entire _Ace Combat_ series released after _Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere_.
    -   _Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War_ is a prequel to the entire series, especially ''Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War as the aftermath of the Belkan War itself plays a major part in 5's plot.
-   _The Tale of ALLTYNEX_ brings us _RefleX_ (2008), which is a prequel to _KAMUI_ (1999). _RefleX_ in turn is preceded by _ALLTYNEX Second_ (2010). Amusingly, the latter two games in the series are remakes of existing games: _Reflection_ (1998) and _ALLTYNEX_ (1996), meaning that retroactively, the series was still released in straight chronological order.
-   The _Sonic Boom_ Licensed Game is a prequel to the TV show.
-   The _Yoshi's Island_ series (besides _Yoshi Topsy-Turvy_) is a prequel to the _Super Mario Bros._ series, set when the Mario Bros. and Bowser were babies.
-   The Stinger in the ending for _Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker_ reveals that the game actually takes place before _Super Mario 3D World_ (or as of the Switch port, _Super Mario Odyssey_), as Captain Toad winds up in 3D World's opening cutscene. Captain Toad follows Mario and crew down the clear pipe, which also explains how he wound up in the Sprixie Kingdom in said game. In the Switch port, instead, Toad and Toadette's cart ends in the Sand Kingdom, and upon Toad seeing the Odyssey flying through the skies, he eagerly follows it, much to the dismay of Toadette.
-   Word of God has stated that _Shadow of the Colossus_ is the prequel to _ICO_, and that Wander is the progenitor of the "cursed" horned children like the titular Ico, as signified by Wander becoming an infant with horns at the end.
-   _Five Nights at Freddy's_:
    -   _Five Nights at Freddy's 2_ is a stealth prequel, thus explaining why Phone Guy is alive and the restaurant is still running. It actually takes place shortly before "The Bite of 1987".
    -   _Five Nights at Freddy's 4_ is either this or a P.O.V. Sequel to _2._ If it's the former, it reveals that there was also a "Bite of 1983." If it's the latter, then it shows a child who is scared of Freddy and friends who ultimately becomes the Bite of 1987 victim.
    -   _Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location_, thanks to a certain secret ending from the game's update, is implied to be a prequel, though just _what_ it is a prequel to is hard to pinpoint. Basically, the game is designed as such that it could be placed at any point in the timeline. For a full answer: it might be an Origins Episode for the main antagonist and thus take place before the events of other games in the series, it might happen sometime in between _4_ and _3_ and explain about the antagonist's previously unmentioned son (though there's no stopping for the son to appear before _4_ either), or it might be unconnected to any game thus far, because the antagonist's name is not fully confirmed to be his canonical name (it was previously revealed in a non-canon spinoff novel).
-   One of the endings of _House of the Dead 4_ sets up the game as a prequel to _House Of The Dead 3_. It gets this in your face by telling you to go back and play _House Of The Dead 3_ after you managed to get said ending.
    -   Meanwhile, _Overkill_ is set before any other game in the series, identifiable because Agent G is introduced as being sent on his _first_ assignment here.
-   _Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire_, rather than simply being remakes of the original _Ruby_ and _Sapphire_, add new plot points touching upon the origin of Mega Evolution and the war in Kalos 3,000 years before the start of the series, tying them into _Pokémon X and Y_. According to Word of God, the former two take place an unspecified amount of time before the latter two.
-   The Game Boy Advance game _The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King_ is a prequel to the animated film _The Nightmare Before Christmas_ that explains how Jack Skellington first encountered Oogie Boogie and why they hate each other.
-   While most sequels in the _Silent Hill_ series are standalone, the first game has a prequel in the form of _Origins_ that focuses on a new protagonist who is nevertheless involved with the characters of _1_.
-   _Life Is Strange: Before the Storm_ takes place three years before the original game. It shows how Chloe met Rachel Amber, who never appeared in the original but whose relationships and strange disappearance drove much of the plot.
-   The followups to the Flash puzzle platformer _Sleepy Knight_: _One-Trick Mage_, _Choppy Orc_ and _Sticky Sorcerer_, are prequels. (Each game ends with you freeing the main character of the previous one.)
-   _Gradius ReBirth_ (2009) is this to _Nemesis 2_ (1987), featuring Dr. Venom as James Burton's commanding officer before the former went rogue. Completing the third and final loop of the game exposes Venom's coup d'etat and Face–Heel Turn, setting up the events of _Nemesis 2_.
-   _Professor Layton_: The second trilogy of games take place before the first, telling how, among other things, Layton met his assistant Luke.
-   _Red Dead Redemption II_ takes place before the first _Red Dead Redemption_, focusing on Dutch van der Linde's gang; the same gang whose remnants John must hunt down in the first game.
-   _Spider-Man: Battle for New York_ is set before _Ultimate Spider-Man (2005)_ with Peter Parker still at high school.
-   _Hiveswap_ serves as one to _Homestuck_, taking place two decades (and several sweeps) before the Kids' and Trolls' sessions.
-   _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_ took place 20 years before _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_, which stars Roy's father, Eliwood. Several characters from Binding Blade appear in Blazing Blade in their younger years like Hector and Marcus, and even few characters make cameo appearances like Sophia.
-   _Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent_ is a mobile spin-off of _Octopath Traveler_ that takes place 3 years before the events of the latter. Specifically, it goes over events that were largely untouched in the original game and includes several cameos of characters from the base game.
-   _Yakuza 0_ serves as an Origin Story for Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, telling a story set during The '80s that documents how both men end up rising to power in the Tojo Clan and would become the Dragon of Dojima and the Mad Dog of Shimano respectively.
-   _Yandere Simulator_'s 1980's Mode is a prequel to the main game, featuring Yandere-chan's mother Ryoba, and setting up events that play key roles in the main story, such as the murder trial that led to Akademi's distrust of the police, the reason the third floor bathroom is haunted, and, of course, Ryoba meeting and successfully kidnapping her Senpai/Yan-chan's father.
-   _Tenchu_ chronologically begins with _Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins_, which is the second game in the series and shows Rikimaru and Ayame as teenagers and how they became the Azuma ninja they are in the present. The Nintendo DS installment _Tenchu: Dark Secret_ is also set before the first game.
-   _Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon_ is a prequel to the _Bayonetta_ games set during the title character’s childhood.
-   The _Art of Fighting_ series chronologically precedes the _Fatal Fury_ series, with the second game of the former featuring a younger Geese Howard go from corrupt police commissioner to a feared criminal mastermind.

    Visual Novels 

-   Weirdly enough, this is subverted in _DDLC+_, the Updated Re-release of _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ — that is to say, something looks like a prequel but isn't exactly. The side stories that are added are clearly a prequel to the original story in the sense that they detail how the characters got to know each other and formed the Literature Club. They do suffer from slight continuity problems typical in prequels in that, since they focus on developing the characters' relationships, it makes it a bit odd that some issues seem to be more unresolved in the original story that was written first.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  However, _DDLC+_ also contains a backstory, revealed later, about a group of people who were the fictional developers of the game, and this explains how the side stories are in a different simulated universe than the game proper, one where certain things are different. So the sort-of-prequel side stories are actually in a different in-universe Alternate Continuity from the main game; they (or at least the first ones, anyway) are set before those events in the timeline of the history of the Literature Club but don't actually lead up to them in the broader story where it all being a game is part of the story. It Makes Sense in Context.

    Web Animation 

-   Comics 5-11 of _Kirby Guardian_ take place before the rest of the series and showcase why Adeline is the way she is in episode 6
-   Season 9 of _Red vs. Blue_ began showing a prequel story delving into the backstory of Project Freelancer, split between showing Church's attempts to revive Tex in the Epsilon Capture Unit.

-   _The Aikonia_ webcomic is one to the videogame of the same name.
-   In a way, Hivebent is one for _Homestuck_, revolving around the trolls' session without any input from the kids. Of course, it's later revealed that without the kids, their entire session couldn't have happened.
-   _My Impossible Soulmate_ is a standalone prequel to _Rain (2010)_. It centers on the life of Chiaki Koizumi, the author of the fictional in-universe manga _Black Wings: Kaminari_, Rain’s favorite manga.
-   _The Order of the Stick_ has had two print-only books. The first, numbered 0, is _On the Origin of PCs_, which shows what the heroes were doing before joining together.

-   _Contest Jitters_ is one for _Satin Steele_.
-   _Prequel_, the aforementioned _Elder Scrolls_ fan webcomic, is is one for _Oblivion_.

    Web Videos

    Western Animation 

-   The '90s cartoon short _Another Froggy Evening_ appeared to be a prequel to _One Froggy Evening_ for most of the cartoon, where Michigan J. Frog appears in earlier time periods and meets characters who resemble the man who discovered him in the original short, but this is subverted in the Twist Ending: Michigan eventually reaches a desert island, and the castaway that sees him thinks of him as food rather than a chance to exploit him for fame. Just before the frog was put in a cooking pot, however, he was then abducted by Marvin the Martian. It turns out, happily, that Michigan's croaks are considered Martian, and Marvin and Michigan end it off with a duet.
-   Parodied in _Earthworm Jim_, with a "promo" of _Young Earthworm Jim_ which would feature Jim's many "adventures" before the suit came about.
-   _Recess: All Growed Down_ was released in 2003 (two years after the show was cancelled), but features T.J. and his friends as kindergarteners, rather than fourth (or fifth) graders.
-   _All Hail King Julien_ serves as a prequel to the _Madagascar_ franchise, as it explains how King Julien became king in the first episode, and is otherwise set chronologically before the first movie.
-   _Dawn of the Croods_ serves as a prequel to _The Croods_, showing the family living happily with other cave families in Ahh! Valley.
-   _Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated_ is heavily implied to be a prequel to the original 1969 series in its final episode.
    -   The forthcoming HBO Max series _Velma_ will definitely be a prequel to the Scooby series as it will focus on Velma's origins as mystery cracker.
-   In _The Lion Guard_, the first two seasons take place in the middle of _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_, as Kiara, Kovu and Vitani were shown as cubs. However, the final season takes place after the end of The Lion King II as Kiara, Kovu and Vitani were shown as adults.
-   Disney's _Hercules: The Animated Series_ is a prequel to the Disney movie _Hercules_ of the same name, showing Hercules during his teen-age years.
-   The _Alf_ animated series is a prequel to _ALF_ showing Alf's life on Melmac.
-   In the case of _Star Wars Legends_, long before the prequels that we all know, the animated shows _Droids_ and _Ewoks_ were prequels of the original trilogy. The first told the story of C-3PO and R2-D2 before they met Luke and the second one told the lives of the Ewoks before their first encounter with humans.
-   Considering that _Taz-Mania_ shows Taz still living in Tazmania and in his parent's house probably in his late teens/early twenties, then the show can be considered a loose prequel to the _Looney Tunes_ cartoons.
-   _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_'s season 3 episode "Bold Beginnings!" features stories told by Green Arrow, Plastic Man, and Aquaman as they each take turns explaining to one another how they first met Batman.
-   _Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai_ is set in the year 1920, about 64 years before the original film, and follows the origins of Gizmo and the shopkeeper Mr. Wing.
