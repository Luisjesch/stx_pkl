Pretty!

_Ai yi yi, I'm your little butterfly  
Green black and blue, paint the colors in the sky_

Some people view most insect types as Big Creepy-Crawlies that are scary at best, or dangerous and scary at worst.

Butterflies, however, have always gained positive interest from humanity, given their beautiful colors, their graceful flying, and the fact they look like they would rather drink nectar from flowers than star in the next horror B-Movie. They became symbols of the wind, reincarnation, transformation, the soul, and magic throughout the ages. As a result, butterflies have appeared numerous times in many media.

That said, don't let your guard down around their petite and attractive forms. Butterflies in fiction have an occasional history of being paired with some darker trait like poison; this has made them popular with various Vamps and Honey Traps, as well as any villain that chooses the butterfly motif to represent subtle allure and deceptive deadliness. This is also Truth in Television: butterflies and moths have been seen to drink blood from corpses or even still-living animals in order to get proteins and other nutrients not present in flower nectar.

Compare Amicable Ants and Virtuous Bees, two other types of insects which are typically portrayed as more hard-working than butterflies, but still just as benevolent. Contrast Macabre Moth Motif (although if someone is invoking this trope to hide how deadly the butterfly is, the difference between the two is only skin deep) and Moth Menace, in which butterflies (as well as moths) act as active threats.

    -   Averted with Szayelaporro Granz though. His normal, human-like form is actually rather handsome but when he goes One-Winged Angel butterflies will no longer be beautiful to you.

-   In _Street Fighter V_, a certain female character's profile states that she loves butterflies.
