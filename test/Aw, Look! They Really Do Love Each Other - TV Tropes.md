_"Instead, to Jack's mild surprise, he discovered he was worried about Alison. He was worried about Taneem, too, of course, but mostly he was worried about Alison. It was a rather annoying discovery, actually."_

When a couple/potential couple — who spend the entirety of the show yelling at each other, insulting one another, stabbing each other in the back, etc. — have a moment when they reveal that, deep down, they really care for one another. Awwww.

Often takes place in a humorous rushing-to-your-spouse's-defense manner, where one of them angrily defends the other against the same kind of insults that they themselves like to dish out. The common line is: "Nobody insults/beats up/threatens my wife/husband/boyfriend/girlfriend but me!"

If this relation is between friends then they are Vitriolic Best Buds. If it is between siblings, then it either combines Big Brother Bully and Big Brother Instinct or is Thicker Than Water.

If the romance part comes without warning or justification, the trope may fall flat, since it comes out of nowhere when the previous context of the story makes it seem like they have nothing to love about each other. When couples don't even have these moments, you get No Accounting for Taste. If the bickering is _immediately_ followed by kisses and/or sex, see Slap-Slap-Kiss.

In the early issues, she shoots him down whenever he tries to flirt with her, but eventually reveals that it was more her being put off by his half-assed attempts, and implies she wouldn't turn down a direct request for a date. When she gets pregnant after their enchantment-caused liaison, she is initially angry at him (he could tell from her scent as soon as he woke up from the enchantment, but didn't tell her) and is at first intensely worried about the damage to her image, then spends several weeks avoiding Bigby. But when The Adversary's army of wooden soldiers attack Fabletown, Bigby saves the day. Finally realizing the depth of his love for her, she dashes downstairs (heavily pregnant, and in the pouring rain) and gives him a gigantic hug in front of pretty much everyone of importance.

-   _Ultimate X-Men_: Although he had a strong Sibling Rivalry with Scott, Alex did not hate him, so some mourning for his death (in _Ultimatum_) was plently justified. But... going mad for the loss? Wow, either his brotherly love was way stronger than displayed, or it took that for him to realize that blood is Thicker Than Water.

    Comic Strips

    -   There are many strips which show that, despite the apparent tension and hatred between the two, Calvin and Susie really do care about one another.
    -   Calvin and his parents rarely ever see eye-to-eye. Calvin often doesn't think too highly of his parents, Calvin's Dad sometimes offhandedly comments about wanting a dog instead of a rambunctious youngster... but every so often, we do see that both parties do care for each other in a few strips, with one memorable one showing Dad taking a break from working to play with Calvin in the snow.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Bud and Lindsay Brigman from _The Abyss_. At the start of the movie they're in the middle of a very bitter divorce, but a few near-death experiences remind them that they still do, in fact, love each other, to the point of being willing to die for one another.

-   In _Blindness_, the Japanese couple seem to be incredibly strained after they become blind, to the point of her rejecting him completely. But after a while they reconcile. The same goes for the Doctor and his wife, who is sickened and humiliated with how she cares for him now like he was a baby rather than her husband, but ultimately they prove to still care for each other.
-   In _Casper Meets Wendy_, the title characters don't exactly have the most supportive families. The Ghostly Trio and Wendy's aunts pretty much bully and restrict the kids, respectively, but when Casper and Wendy end up in trouble from Desmond Spellman and about to be trapped in the Mystic Abyss, neither the witches nor the ghosts hesitate to save them.
-   _Cyberbully_: Taylor and Eric Hillridge get on each other's nerves all the time, especially when the latter gets mad at the former for refusing to let him create his own Cliquesters account, which then results in him hacking her account and changing her status to something mean and demeaning, which leads to him being grounded and, along with the fake account created by her best friend, Samantha, would contribute to the Cyberbullying campaign against her. After Taylor tries to kill herself by downing a large amount of Tylenol after all the bullying and having her heart broken, but fails due to the childproof cap and Samantha having watched the video of her threat and notifying their mother to stop her in time, Eric regretted his actions and felt genuinely upset at the thought of losing his sister to suicide.
-   _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_: Greg and Rodrick in the second film, Greg and Frank in the third film. These films explore and flesh out Greg's dysfunctional relationships with his father and older brother better than in the books, eventually showing they do care for each other.
-   _GoldenEye_ provides a non-romantic example between M and 007. Despite delivering a "The Reason You Suck" Speech to James Bond and even saying she has no problem sending him to his death as long as it was worthwhile, M's farewell to him is:
-   As much as Katniss Everdeen bickers with Haymitch and as angry as she is with him in _The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1_, they still have moments that show how much they've grown to care about one another. For example, it's his arms she cries in over Peeta's torture.
-   _Into the Storm (2009)_ shows Clemmie and Winston bicker a lot, but they have their sweet moments, too.
-   _Kaamelott: Premier Volet_: While Arthur often belittles Guenièvre in Books 1 to 4 of _Kaamelott_ despite her (mostly ineffectual) efforts to be a good queen and wife, he accompanies her to the tower to get the flower crown back. And then he actually climbs the tower for her and tenderly kisses her.
-   In _Kung Fu Hustle_, the ferocious landlady and her cowardly husband, who have been squabbling for the entire first part of the movie (she even throws him out the window and hits him in the head with a flower pot), band together to defend the neighborhood from the Axe Gang, fight the Beast, and nurse the movie's hero back to health. They also had a brief dance together... before resuming their usual henpecking roles.
-   In _Life with Father_, Clarence Sr. and Vinnie are always arguing over the finances or houseguests or church, but when Vinnie's illness takes a turn for the worse, the workaholic Clarence leaves the office in the middle of the day and takes a cab home (after railing several times about how much he hates cabs) to be at her side.
-   _Lincoln_ has a heartrending moment at the very end. The war is over, the slaves are free, the trees are in bloom, and Abe and Mary — who have spent most of the film yelling at each other in bitter anguish — take a Good Friday carriage ride, hold hands and talk about the future; "We must try to be happier. We must. Both of us. We've been so miserable for so long."
-   _The Love of Siam_. When Tong's mother forbids Tong from seeing Mew, he simply brushed her off and went to search for Mew. Unfortunately, the two boys don't get together in the end. However, the movie do end with a bittersweet ending with Tong confessing his love for him. Furthermore, there's many foreshadowing that they will get together in the future.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_: For a friendship example, most of the time in the _Guardians of the Galaxy_ movies, especially the 2nd and 3rd one as well as _Avengers: Infinity War_, Peter and Rocket spend most of their screen time together bickering and arguing. However, several examples show they're truly close friends to the point where Quill is devastated when Rocket is close to dying.
-   _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_: Rick's new Italian wife Francesca at first seems to be little more than a Trophy Wife for him, especially given that she's considerably younger than him and that they married within a few months of meeting each other. However, after he kills the last of the Manson cultists who were breaking into his home, the very first thing he does is call out for Francesca and check up on her, proving that he does genuinely love her. The novelization also reveals that they stayed married to each other and that they settled down together following Rick's retirement.
-   For all his selfishness and scheming, you've got to "Awww" at the look on Jack's face when Will gets stabbed in _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End_.
-   _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock_:
    -   Even though they've been estranged for most of their lives, Sarek spends most of the film desperately trying to do right by Spock. Then, at the end, when the Vulcan priestess questions the logic of performing an all-but-forgotten procedure to reunite Spock's _katra_ with his reanimated body, Sarek openly states, in front of multiple Vulcans, that "my logic is uncertain where my son is concerned". From a Vulcan, that's a _massive_ admission.
    -   McCoy, too. While they're transporting Spock's body to Vulcan, he admits that he's missed Spock and that he doesn't think he could bear to lose him a second time. Shortly thereafter, he agrees to risk his own life for Spock's sake.
-   Building on the previous film, _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_ has several of these for Sarek and Spock.
    -   First off, we have Sarek coming to the Federation Council to speak on behalf of Kirk and the others. It's never explicitly stated, but it's fairly clear that at least part of his reason for doing so is the fact that those actions brought Spock back to him.
    -   After the court-martial, Spock and Sarek have a conversation that's practically brimming with this trope.
        
        **Sarek**: I am returning to Vulcan within the hour. I would like to take my leave of you.  
        **Spock**: It was most kind of you to make this effort.  
        **Sarek**: It was not an effort. You are my son. Besides, I am most impressed with your performance in this crisis.  
        **Spock**: Most kind.  
        **Sarek**: As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet. It is possible that judgment was incorrect. Your associates are people of good character.  
        **Spock**: They are my friends.  
        **Sarek**: Yes, of course.
        
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   Han Solo and Princess Leia might have moments like these only under threat of carbonite freezing, death by stormtrooper, or in post-I-can't-believe-we-survived-that-elation, but they do have them.
    -   C-3PO and R2-D2 even have a moment in _A New Hope_. After blowing up the Death Star, the team pulls R2 out of the X-Wing in disrepair. 3PO is in a panic, begging the others to fix the droid and even offering to donate any of his own parts to help with the repairs.
-   In the remake of _The Stepford Wives_ Walter and Joanna clearly have a difficult marriage, but both gradually learn compromise and in the end, Walter doesn't get a Stepford wife, which in this movie means brainwashing his wife into a servile domestic servant, and proceeds to help Joanna put a stop to their scheme, and Joanna in return protects Walter from Mike. At the end, nothing is really perfect, but it is real.
-   _Steps Trodden Black_: Despite the two bickering for the first half of the movie, Alex is genuinely worried when Jack's whereabouts are unknown and there's a monster on the loose.
-   _Us_: Kitty and Josh appear to be in an Awful Wedded Life, and spend most of their screentime arguing and insulting one another. But in the end, when she's dying, Kitty crawls towards an already-dead Josh, showing that she did love him deep down.

    Music 

-   Voltaire's song "Stuck With You".
-   The Parlotones (a South African rock band) portrays this in their music video for Push Me to the Floor, in which the married couple spend the entire video getting back and sabotaging at each other in every possible way...and at the end start getting frisky and about to have sex on a billiards table .
-   The final song of _The Simpsons Sing the Blues_, "Sibling Rivalry," ends with a quiet a capella refrain about Bart and Lisa's fractious relationship, but afterward oh, you can hear Bart mutter "Let go of my hand, Lisa."
-   Depending on your interpretation, either played straight or deconstructed in The Pogues' "Fairytale Of New York".
-   Darkly subverted/deconstructed by the Mountain Goats song "Oceanographer's Choice". The bickering couple getting back together in the end is depicted as them being too dangerously codependent and screwed up to get out of their mutually abusive and destructive relationship.
-   Reel Big Fish's "I Know You Too Well To Like You Anymore" is a duet where each singer spends the time insulting one another, but ends with them ultimately admitting they love each other, concluding with "Oh well."
-   _Gorillaz_'s music video for "The Lost Chord" ends with _2-D_ of all people coming back for Murdoc after it appears that the band has left him to sink with the remnants of Plastic Beach after Poseidon destroys it. Murdoc's expression of ecstatic joy in response has to be seen to be believed. Especially touching because it shows how much both of them have grown and developed as people over the past two decades, especially when it's in the face of something as, well, _complicated_ for the band as Plastic Beach.
-   Barry Louis Polisar: In "Oh No, I Like My Sister!", the narrator is constantly bickering with his sister, but now that she's gone to Australia, he can't help but worry about her, and wishes that she comes back soon.
-   P!nk's "True Love" is a song about someone being in a long term relationship with another person that is not perfect, yet despite their respective flaws they love everything about each other.

    Podcasts 

-   A platonic example from the main trio of _Wooden Overcoats_. Twins Rudyard and Antigone are usually at each other's throats, and can barely stand to be in the same room as each other, while Georgie, though very loyal, doesn't hesitate to snark at them both (though she is likely to be nicer to Antigone). However, it's clear Rudyard and Antigone _do_ love each other, and will even occasionally admit it. (One of the most touching moments of the whole series is Antigone begrudgingly telling her brother, "I don't actually hate you. Keep your chin up.") They _both_ admit they can't function without Georgie, who, in turn, can't imagine life without them. Even when she temporarily quits Funn Funerals and gets a nice, stable job with the mayor's office, she can't stand being away from them for longer than day.

    Radio 

-   Almost the entire point of _The Bickersons_ — John and Blanche may **constantly** fight with each other, but there's no doubt that neither one would ever consider a divorce.
-   Damien and Anthony in In and Out of the Kitchen — they bicker all the time, but are obviously in love.

    Theatre 

-   Walter and Marion spend almost all of _Don't Drink the Water_ bickering like the old married couple they are...until Marion starts to cry with worry over their escape plan. Walter finally calms his brash demeanor to comfort her and the two remember their first few dates together.
-   In _Fiddler on the Roof_, Golde and Tevye get their moment after seeing their first two daughters marry for love. Up until now all we've seen is Golde harassing Tevye and Tevye evading her. In a charming duet they consider the fact that theirs was an Arranged Marriage and they'd never met until they were reciting their wedding vows. After evading for awhile Golde finally admits that yes, she does love him and he responds in kind. If done well, these two can outshine all the young couples as the cutest in the show.
-   In _Fools_, a curse not only makes most of the characters stupid but also prevents them from falling in love. Once the curse is broken, the parents of The Ingenue, Sophia, Lenya and Nikolai realize they've always loved each other
-   Nathan and Richard have a scene or two like this in _Thrill Me_ — generally speaking, Richard tries to deny he could possibly care about anyone, but he does genuinely like (and need) Nathan.
    
    **Richard:** _\[reluctantly\]_ ...I...I screw up without you.  
    **Nathan:** What?  
    **Richard:** I screw up without you, okay!  
    **Nathan:** ...You never said you needed me before.
    

    Visual Novels 

-   In _The Eden of Grisaia_, Makina spends pretty much the entire story mocking and abusing Michiru as a flanderization of her previous mildly annoying behavior. She considers Michiru to be one of her best friends, but rarely shows that. However, in the afterstory, Michiru is incredibly upset and frustrated about getting pregnant which the other girls consider to be a good thing. When they see Michiru is upset, however, they instantly cut out the jokes and spend a few minutes assuring her everything is going to be okay.
-   In _Obey Me! – One Master to Rule Them All!_, Mammon is constantly picked on and belittled by his brothers for being a greedy and "scummy" demon. In one of his side stories, he runs away after they assume he was trying to steal Beelzebub's wallet. When he doesn't return after a few days, his brothers become concerned and a couple promise to go looking for him. When they find out that he has returned, they and he are glad to see each other.
-   In _Shinrai: Broken Beyond Despair_, Raiko Shinpuku is rather gloomy and finds her mother annoying, from her tendency to tease Raiko to buying Raiko an embarrassing cat costume to wear to the Halloween party. However, at the end of the game(in one of the bad endings and a journal entry on the good ending route), Raiko is rather happy to see her mother after everything that happened that night.
-   As one of the Valkyrie, Wildfire has spent all her life seeing men as lust objects in _War: 13th Day_, but when Brooks attempts to rape Chase, the player can have her put a stop to it. In the same scene, Chase reveals that he didn't fight back against Brooks because he knows she is Wildfire's best friend.

    Web Animation

-   Louie stands up for Dewey and Huey in _Ducktalez_ 4, when Buzzkill is about to kill them, because they're Louie's brothers despite the crap they give Louie.
-   _Clicker_: Despite the bickering and fighting throughout the entire short, which worsened the longer they stay Trapped in TV Land, both Bloo and Trevor are clearly upset and in tears when the former has no choice but to break up after realising their relationship is beyond saving.
-   A platonic version in _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, between father and son. After the Emperor mocks and denigrates his son Rogal Dorn just one too many times, specifically asking why he didn't go on some extreme long-shot adventure into the Warp like so many of his other brothers, Rogal has this to say:
    
    **Rogal Dorn:** While my siblings are out being lost, I came here to keep our rambling paraplegic father company. Because I love him more than any other.  
    **The Emperor of Mankind:** ... You are lucky I find salt and sweet to go nicely together, son.
    
-   In one episode of _Red vs. Blue_:
    
    **Church:** From now on, if anybody makes my girlfriend cranky and psychotic, it's gonna be me!  
    **Tex:** Aw, that's sweet.  
    **Church:** Shut up, bitch.  
    **Tex:** Asshole.
    

    Web Original 

-   _The Cry of Mann_: The Mann children. Quirky as they may be, and all clashing over the course of the story due to their personal struggles, they do sincerely love each other. Being told Jouglat was dead snapped Jack out of his "Jack Prime" state, leading to an emotional monologue where Jack expressed his sincere love for his brother. In the same scene, Berry was struggling to keep everyone respectful during the ceremony, and was incredibly worried during Jack's outburst, telling him that he's not a buff monster, but a sweet boy who paints sweet trains. Jouglat even admitted that Jacks "alright".
-   In _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_, Vegeta treats Future Trunks with nothing but contempt both before and after learning that he's his son from the future. Then Super Perfect Cell blasts a hole in Trunks's chest in the finale, and Vegeta watches in Stunned Silence for a few seconds before going _ballistic_ with rage.
-   _Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk_: The Dwarf really doesn't like the Elf. Even though he constantly berates and mocks her, this doesn't stop him from perving over her with the other males when she decides to go bathing in the nude. Played more poignantly when the Elf dies later on in the story, and the Dwarf, the swearing grumpy old git who started an argument with her literally three seconds after meeting her, is utterly _heartbroken_.
-   While calling it "love" would be a stretch, The Nostalgia Chick and The Nostalgia Critic tend to have a few sweetly (if slightly freakish) affectionate moments amidst their Belligerent Sexual Tension.
    
    **Nostalgia Chick (To the Critic in a fond, affectionate voice)**: You stupid sack of shit.
    
-   In _Plague and Treachery on the Oregon Trail_, Cyrus goes psychotic when he finds out the sheer _number_ of how many men his wife has slept with behind his back, and she ends up doing a running away to live in the wilderness, only for them to realize they really do care for each other, and will start their lives over together in Oregon.
-   Schlatt has a moment of this with Connor in one _SMPLive_ stream:
    
    **Schlatt:** You know I would never get genuinely upset at you.
    
-   In _There Will Be Brawl_, Captain Falcon and Pit's relationship can be borderline abusive sometimes. But when someone else threatens to hurt Pit...
    
    **Captain Falcon:** I may have held mercy for you before. But there is only one fist that can bruise the face of _my_ angel. **FALCONNNNNNNN PUNCH!**
    

    Real Life 

-   Even the meanest, grumpiest male crocodile would soften up if you pair him with a female... unless one of them ate the other for dinner instead. In nature, male and female often only show interest in each other in that way at mating time; the rest of the time, it's just another rival/potential meal.
-   Dogs; if you own two or more, you'll often see them badgering each other, swiping their toys, chasing one another around, and generally harassing one another back and forth. But if one is sick or injured, the others will stick by him or her and comfort them until they get better.
-   Cats as well, to a lesser extent. Most companion cats (who live together but may or may not be related by blood) spend a fair chunk of their time fighting, but it's all for play and they'll often slip into social grooming shortly thereafter.
