"I hope it's not too late to return this."

_"Ancient folk saying: 'You can catch the devil, but you can't hold him long.'"_

Long ago, An Ancient People faced a terrible evil. Using various methods, they bound the evil into a prison from which they thought it could never escape.

It did.

Sealed Evil in a Can, as the title suggests, is a way to suddenly introduce a villain, especially one that is legendary and powerful. It also explains why the villain hasn't done anything up to that point: It escaped very, _very_ recently.

A sealed evil is often introduced as a Greater-Scope Villain: the direct Big Bad's plan will be to unseal the can of some ancient God of Evil, hoping they'll get some of that great power as a reward. Of course, Evil Is Not a Toy; if they succeed, it usually turns out that the Sealed Evil does not care for them (or may have even been manipulating them into freeing them) and disposes of them, making the Sealed Evil the _true_ Final Boss. Sealed Evil™ almost _never_ rewards those who release it. It may even act like the malevolent flavor of a Jackass Genie, twisting their releasers' wishes back on them. (Of course, occasionally the Big Bad actually _succeeds_ in controlling the sealed evil.)

The hero occasionally breaks the seal themselves due to ignorance, lack of information, or active manipulation by the villain.

Or perhaps it was awoken by unsuspecting miners or archaeologists who Dug Too Deep and found something better left buried and undisturbed — often ignoring every single warning they found before releasing it.

Oddly enough, no matter what the cause of the seal being broken, it seems to always happen 1,000 years after the evil was first sealed. Yet nobody ever seems to know that the evil is about to reemerge in that time frame. (To be fair, 1,000 years is _plenty_ of time for people to forget about something, especially if more immediate concerns arise in the meantime.)

Either way, if a Sealed Evil is introduced into a story, expect it to escape at some point. This brings up the primary question "Why did they just seal it, as opposed to **kill** it?" The answer tends to vary; but usually it's a variant of The Punishment (for both the sealed and everyone else), Thou Shalt Not Kill (heroes can take pity and/or show mercy towards the oddest things), and/or As Long as There Is Evil. Maybe it _couldn't_ be killed for good (or more commonly, the conditions weren't right to deal the final blow), so sealing it was the next best thing. Another common excuse is the Balance Between Good and Evil; if they'd killed the ancient evil, then a bigger, badder evil would've taken its place, thus sealing it away neutralizes the threat but also keeps it in the world and maintains the balance. And a good excuse that is often used is that the evil was way too strong, so even the most powerful heroes of the past couldn't kill it, but the sealing spell worked just fine. Or maybe it _was_ killed and the method of breaking the seal was resurrecting it.

Expect the mere release of the SEIAC to cause a World-Wrecking Wave, Walking Wasteland, and sundry other disasters. That said, being cooped up for centuries is likely to have weakened the SEIAC, meaning that it needs some time to recover its lost strength. This could mean that the hero(es) has a chance to seal it back up, or even destroy it once and for all.

Since this trope can be traced back to Greek mythology, it's Older Than Feudalism. Note that, minus your standard speculative fiction elements, it's functionally identical to a plot where a horrible criminal escapes from or is released from prison. Not to be confused with Exactly What It Says on the Tin — although your Evil-in-a-Can may be clearly labeled as such. But no one will ever read or believe the label.

This is an _extremely_ common plot and backstory in video games, especially Role-Playing Games, because it's such a simple backstory: the Big Bad, put away by some ancient hero, has escaped, and you (the player) must put them back in/kill them for good. Or, as mentioned above, the current Big Bad wishes to release the Greater-Scope Villain to use its power, and the hero must stop them. With the second plotline, you can expect the heroes to fail to stop the unsealing, and the sealed evil to be the Final Boss instead of the direct Big Bad, and for the sealed evil to promptly bring about the Darkest Hour, only to be defeated anyway. Presumably, if the sealed evil was never going to be released, it never would have been mentioned in the first place.

If the seal isn't all that tight, then it's a Leaking Can of Evil.

The precise nature of the Can can vary considerably, although a few forms crop up more often than not. In some cases, the evil is imprisoned inside a physical object, sometimes a surprisingly small one such as a lamp or a box; other times, its prison may be any sort of mundane but very thoroughly-sealed cavern, chamber or prison cell. It may also take the form of a Monster in the Ice, in which case it's fairly common for the entity to have become this accidentally. In more extreme cases, the evil is trapped within a pocket dimension or was expelled from the universe altogether.

May be caused by Supernatural Sealing. Depending on the nature of the seal, the evil may or may not be able to perceive or interact with the immediate surroundings of the prison, or have anything to really _do_. In the case that it cannot and does not, the Fridge Horror (And I Must Scream) is usually never addressed or acknowledged, mainly to keep people from feeling sorry for the villain, even though the Driven to Madness aspect could easily make for a villain who's even worse when unpackaged than they were when they were first sealed in.

In some cases, the sealed Evil comes to the conclusion that Being Evil Sucks, and decide to undergo a Heel–Face Turn, becoming Evil Redeemed in a Can.

Compare Put on a Prison Bus, when a character (usually a villain) gets arrested instead of being magically sealed away, and Sealed Evil in Another World, where the "can" is a different world entirely. Contrast with Trapped in the Host, where an entity (usually but not always evil, or at least predatory) gets stuck in a body or object they had possessed. Not to be confused with Monstrous Seal. That trope refers to _animal_ seals.

    Asian Animation 

-   In the _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_ story arc _Great War in the Bizarre World_, the bees inhabiting the Bizarre World were able to seal the evil Darton inside a giant egg, and consider the egg to be sacred for that reason. While Wolffy tries to cook the egg, he accidentally removes the seal on it, releasing Darton who proceeds to get Wolffy's help in an evil scheme.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   Dark Depths, after certain conditions are met – i.e. the costly "unsealing" process of removing ten ice counters from it – creates a large and damn near unkillable monster<small>◊</small>.
    -   For a much older example, consider the Bottle of Suleiman, which upon being sacrificed has a 50/50 chance of either releasing a fairly powerful djinn that joins your forces or else simply blowing up in your face.
    -   And then there's the Tomb of Urami, who nets you a big demon at the price of sacrificing all of your lands.
    -   Yawgmoth, the guy who makes planeswalkers look like muggles and Dominaria's version of the Devil, was sealed in a whole other plane back when he was a mortal. He wanted back in and spent thousands of years in a battle of wits with Anti-Hero Urza with his freedom as the stakes.
    -   In the _Zendikar_ expansion, a group of Eldritch Abominations called the Eldrazi were got sealed away by Sorin Markov and two other guys, turning all of Zendikar into a prison for them. The final set in the _Zendikar_ block, _Rise of the Eldrazi_, sees them loosed on the Multiverse.
    -   A plot-relevant example can be found in the _Innistrad_ expansion: The Helvault was created by the vampire planeswalker Sorin Markov to seal away demons that Avacyn couldn't outright defeat. The plot of the expansion is set in motion when, by twist of fate, Avacyn herself becomes sealed inside the Helvault.
    -   The demon Withengar, also from the _Innistrad_ expansion, was sealed inside Elbrus, the Binding Blade. If the Blade tastes blood, Withengar is freed.
    -   Certain cards allow players to set up Sealed Evil in a Can situations. Cards like Oblivion Ring and Journey to Nowhere let a player seal an opponent's creature in a can but any card that can remove the enchantment frees them. Summoner's Egg goes the other direction, letting a player seal a creature from their hand and bringing it to the battlefield for free if the Egg gets destroyed.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!!_:
    -   The game has several monsters like this, the most memorable being Exodia (who is split up into five pieces and allows you to _win the game_ should you have all five in your hand; in the anime, it did take a huge ritual to unseal it) and all versions of the three God Cards (Egyptian, Sacred Beasts, and "Wicked Gods", all of which need three sacrifices to bring out and have devastating power, and two of which have fusions of themselves that are even _more_ powerful). In the anime, they are so powerful that most of them are sealed up themselves, and it's considered madness for anyone to try and duel with them in their deck.
    -   The "Hidden Arsenal" storyline has the three dragons of the Ice Barrier, sealed away long ago by a powerful sage. Unfortunately, the people of the Ice Barrier get so desperate in a war they decided to unleash them. When they got to the last, Trishula, it wound up getting them all killed. The three dragons were re-sealed, but eventually got infected by the Evilswarm and let out again.

    Comic Strips 

-   One _Dilbert_ strip has Dilbert open up the box of his new phone, saying it was only $50 after rebate... only to unleash the three-headed demon Rebaterus, who forces him to go through a series of extremely annoying tasks to complete the rebate.
-   In "The Garden" segment of _Garfield: His 9 Lives_, Garfield (who is a kitten here) and Cloey (his owner in this life) are given a magical garden by Uncle Tod when he joins the circus, under the condition that they never open the crystal box on the checkered toadstool. The trope is subverted here because, out of loyalty to Uncle Tod, they decide _not_ to open it.
-   In _Hsu and Chan_, the Tanaka brothers fight off a demon invasion by sealing them in various trinkets and keepsakes.
-   _Wormy_: The title dragon owned a collection of magical orbs containing vicious demons, which a human wizard attempted to steal. This being a humor comic, Wormy used the orbs as snooker balls.

    Fairy Tales 

-   "The Death of Koschei the Deathless": Marya succeeded in trapping the immortal and evil sorcerer Koschei in her palace's dungeons, fettered by twelve chains. Ten years later, her husband Ivan wanders into the dungeon and accidentally releases Koschei, who proceeds to kidnap Marya.
-   Alexander Afanasyev's "Little Master Misery": Ivan manages to imprison the embodiment of misery in a pit, covering the hole with a heavy boulder. Later, his brother foolishly releases Misery, but manages to trick him into shrink down and jump into a wheel's hub, thereupon plugging the hole and throwing the wheel into a river. The narrator concludes the tale by pointing out that, given the state of world, some greedy fool surely found the wheel, pulled the wedges out and set Misery free.
-   In "The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples", the empress had gotten a dragon locked up in a cask bound with iron hoops and hidden away in a cellar under her palace. Then her husband goes into the cellar and accidentally releases the dragon.

    Fan Works 

_Ah! My Goddess_

-   _Ah! Archfall!_: Jago's alter ego Papa Jupiter is one of these to the point of him taking over and killing Lind and their son being the one thing he fears the most. Unfortunately, he is also Jago's One-Winged Angel and so he doesn't stay quite as sealed as Jago would like. It is also implied that Gandamak was one of these before he was released by a traitor and it is also implied that the mysterious Titans are or were examples of this.

_Calvin and Hobbes_

-   In _Retro Chill_, Retro and Bob end up stuck in a box after his last bout, and they are accidentally freed by Rupert Chill and Earl.

Crossover

-   _The Bridge (MLP)_ (_My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ & _Godzilla_):
    -   The Big Bad Bagan was sealed within Attu island for more than 70,000 years, until an archaeologist accidentally broke the seal enough for him to wake up and began manipulating events remotely, eventually culminating in seizing control of Dimension Tide and using it to transport himself (and the kaiju) to Equestria.
    -   The original Gabara was sealed in a chamber beneath Aokigahara, but was able to astral project to torment people.
    -   Grogar, the Nexus of Dark Magic and a being on par with the Big Bad, was imprisoned by Harmony in his own realm of Tambelon, the entrance to which is beneath the Crystal Empire. Chrysalis and Sombra are planning to release him.
-   _The Chaotic Masters_: The Chaotic Masters were all sealed away centuries ago, the Monkey King as a puppet, the Collector in a mirror, and BJ's location currently unknown. The plot is kicked off when Monkey King is inadvertently freed and goes looking for the others, while Collector starts trying to manipulate people into freeing him.
-   _Code Prime_: In Chapter 29 of _R2: Revolution_, Cera lures Megatron into the Sword of Akasha, then uses a pair of Groundbridges to trap him in a Shadowzone, before then having the last Thought Elevator destroyed in order to cut the Sword off from Earth, thus making it impossible to reach Megatron. The author's notes for the chapter compare it to being locked in an air-tight vault and then tossing it into the ocean. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long, as the end of the next chapter reveals that Shockwave and Soundwave used an artificial Thought Elevator to reach the Sword, before freeing him from the Shadowzone.
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_:
    -   The world's adamantine deposits are the can sealing away the evil of a deceased Dark God. The dwarfs try to use a similar idea to get rid of particularly dangerous Keepers by tricking them into a warded airtight adamantine chamber and locking them in.
    -   Horned Reapers are also buried away by Keepers, because a Keeper getting rid of them in any other way is bound for retribution from the Dark Gods.
-   _The Ghost Child And The Ghostbusters_ concludes with Morbius, a necromancer who absorbs power from other ghosts, trapped in a Fenton Thermos after being defeated by the Fentons and the Ghostbusters. Since Morbius's nature means that putting him back in the Ghost Zone or in the Ghostbusters' containment unit would risk him starting his campaign all over again, Clockwork volunteers to take custody of the thermos himself, as he can slow down time so that it will remain locked.
-   _God of War: Chains of the Heart_: This happens to Sinmara courtesy of Sora, with Niflheim as the can. When he cuts off the realm's connection to the World Tree, it leaves her unable to leave her dimension at all. As such, much of her time is spent looking for ways to escape so she can go on a vengeful warpath against those she blames for Surtr's death.
-   _Harry Potter and the Boiling Isles_: Chapters 19 and 20 see the Owl House gang treasure hunting in a recently discovered temple on Monster Island, with Darius and Eberwolf also showing up to explore the place for Belos. Aside from the hostile terrain surrounding it, the temple is also at the bottom of a valley with an Anti-Magic field that cancels out all flight-based magic (making it extremely difficult to enter), and the temple itself is a Mobile Maze. All of this turns out to be to lock away and keep hidden from accidental discovery an army of Dementors. After barely escaping this, the group not only re-locks the doors behind them but Darius also causes a cliff to collapse atop the temple, further hiding it.
-   _Justice League of Equestria_ (_My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ & DC Comics):
    -   _Mare of Steel_: At the end of the story, Brainiac is petrified by the Elements of Harmony, and Rainbow Dash/Supermare puts him in storage in the Fortress of Solitude for safe keeping.
    -   _The Princess of Themyscira_: Ares's master plan is to unleash the army of demons created by the Olympians' war with the Titans and then locked away in Tartarus, in order to start a Forever War. While he briefly succeeds in releasing them, Twilight (empowered by the Helmut of Nabu) sends them back, and Ares himself ends up sealed with them.
-   The _J-WITCH Series_ (_Jackie Chan Adventures_ & _W.I.T.C.H._):
    -   "A Jolly J-WITCH Xmas" has Krampus, who was long ago sealed in an Arctic tomb by Saint Nicholas and his elf allies, who built their monastery over him to maintain the seal. Wong and Cedric attack the monastery to free him and unleash him on the Guardians but he's ultimately defeated and re-sealed.
    -   At the end of Season 1, as per canon, Shendu is transformed back into a statue, with the added security measure here of then being locked away beneath the Infinite City's prison.
-   _There Was Once an Avenger From Krypton_ (Massive Multiplayer Crossover): At the climax of _Changing of the Guard_, this is how Vilgax is defeated, with Ben trapping him in Diamondhead's unbreakable crystal, with the plan being to let him out to toss him at Thanos when the Mad Titan eventually comes for Earth.
-   _A Triangle in the Stars_: (_Gravity Falls_ & _Steven Universe_): Both shows' canons have these instances, so it only figures that this story would have at least two:
    -   Bill Cipher. He starts off as this – the statue he became in Gravity Falls' finale. Steven comes across it, which kicks off the plot. It's ultimately Subverted, since Bill finds that he's lost some powers. But over the course of the story, he steadily regains them...
    -   Gabriel is another one. He had gotten thrown into the Void, though he wasn't evil then.
-   _The Weaver Option_:
    -   The Vault of Infinity in the Peril arc is eventually revealed to be a Necron Tesseract Vault containing a fragment of Iash'uddra. The fragment breaks free and fights Taylor until Trazyn seals it in a new Vault.
    -   During the razing of Commorragh, Objective I assigned to Taylor's forces is to capture a Great Crusade-era stasis chamber and release it on Sicarus. The chamber releases the last surviving members of the Skaven race, starting a planetary war and religious schism.
    -   Objective D2 of the razing was to ensure the Oblivion Gate remained sealed. The author explained the Gate is a webway portal leading to a pocket dimension containing something so horrific the term "eldritch abomination" was insufficient. The Aeldari at their prime couldn't destroy it, only seal the Gate, and even the Drukhari weren't demented enough to open it.

_Dragon Ball_

-   This is how _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_ interprets the villain Bojack. In his movie it was said that he was released from his imprisonment by King Kai's death; in _Abridged_ he's literally trapped within King Kai's planet (and will occasionally remark on the goings-on) and its immense gravity is said to be a side-effect of his high fighting power.

_Game of Thrones_ / _A Song of Ice and Fire_

-   In _Robb Returns_, it's eventually revealed that there's a secret chamber beneath the Hightower which contains an ancient gate, which House Hightower have been defending for their entire history. On the other side of that gate is _something_, which is constantly banging on it in an attempt to get free. After an encounter with it when it almost gets through, Willas Tyrell becomes convinced that it's the Drowned God of the Ironborn, which is later confirmed by research Sam Tarly does at the Citadel.

_Godzilla_

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: It's confirmed in this story that Ghidorah was very much a Leaking Can of Evil during the time it was frozen and under Monarch observation in Antarctica. During the Yonaguni battle, Godzilla buries one of the Many's Mind Hives alive and seals all its ways out.

_Invader Zim_

-   _Gaz Dreams of Genie_: At the end, Gaz becomes this after being transformed into a genie and trapped inside a lamp. She's absolutely furious at her imprisonment, and vows to exact brutal vengeance on Azie and on her family the moment she's freed or, failing that, to make the life of whoever she's freed by a living hell, and has the power to follow up on these threats. However, she cannot exit the lamp on her own and is sealed deep inside a Secret Government Warehouse, and likely will remain there for a very long time.

_Jackie Chan Adventures_

-   In the backstory of _Ages of Shadow_, Jade is sealed in the Shadow Realm by her family after her Face–Heel Turn, after more mundane ways of locking her up failed. Her entire plot during the Third Age (Chapters 3-6) is to gather the power to escape this imprisonment. Ultimately, Trace fixes the flaw in the seal that let her communicate with other worlds, locking her away for good.
-   _Jackie Chan Adventures: Olympian Journey_: Thousands of years ago, most of the Greek gods (except Hestia and Prometheus, who helped in the sealing) were sealed in a magical amphora by the rebelling humanity. In the modern day, the urn is broken during a fight between Jackie and a Villain Team-Up of several of his old foes, releasing the gods. Though by this point, only Eris is still extant, the others having been reduced to semi-sentient essences that seek out and merge with hosts.
-   _Queen of All Oni_: Since Daolon Wong's spell turned Jade evil instead of releasing Tarakudo, the latter is still trapped in the shadow realm, observing and mildly influencing events while building up his strength to escape.
    -   Drago was once sealed inside a sword by Lo Pei, until some point in the future when he was released and enslaved by Monsieur Verde.
    -   There's also the various evils sealed in the Vault of Endless Night under Mexico City and watched over by Nameless. We see a large number of Big Creepy-Crawlies, Demonic Spiders, and zombies, but it's implied that there are even _worse_ things sealed away deeper down.
    -   The Shadow Man, the JCA verse analogue to Dr. Facilier, upon his defeat was reduced to a Living Shadow and sealed within a container. Verde releases him in order to absorb his power, but he ends up resealed by the J-Team.
    -   The story eventually elaborates on The Grand Design: a massive spell that guarantees sealed evils will _stay_ sealed indefinitely, and that so many evils being released one after another in the series is the direct result of that Design finally beginning to _fail_, because The Chosen One, who is supposed to keep it going, died prematurely, and the new one, Jade, is now unable.
        
        **Karasu:** Then things start to happen, Chan. Things like a petrified demon not only waking up, but doing so in the hands of a man foolish enough to make a deal to a with it, and possessing the resources to release it.
        
-   _Shadows Awakening_:
    -   The Queen is trapped in Jade's mind, with the Tiger Talisman's power taking the form of two tigers that keep her from making any direct moves to control Jade's body. Eventually, her corruption reaches the point that the talisman separates them, freeing her from Jade. However, after she's defeated in the Final Battle, she's reabsorbed by Jade and trapped again.
    -   During the Final Battle, Kyosuke ends up sucked inside the Urn of Wei Cheing by Uncle and Tohru.

_My Little Pony_ _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ has had several examples of this in the show; unsurprisingly, it shows up quite frequently in its fanfiction as well.

-   _A Diplomatic Visit_:
    -   Chapter 8 of the sequel _Diplomat at Large_ reveals that millennia ago, the merlions migrated into the area of the western oceans ruled by the monstrous octopus Squirk, and defeated and imprisoned him in a cage of wrought sea-silver and oceanic crystal, enchanted to keep his words from getting out. He's still there to this day, throwing tantrums inside his prison.
    -   Grogar, the ancient ram sorcerer, imprisoned long ago. Twilight checks up on his prison in chapter 11, and finds that it's still shut tight, adding a few extra spells of her own to be safe.
    -   The final arc of the fourth story, _The Diplomat's Life_, features Rabia, AKA the Pony of Shadows, who was imprisoned in Limbo when Starswirl and his fellow Pillars sacrificed themselves to lock him away.
-   In _The Equestrian Wind Mage_ continuity, Majora has been imprisoned in the Dark World for countless years. The entire plot is driven by his minions working to free him.
-   _A Future of Friendship, a History of Hate_: By the time the story starts, Ruinate has been trapped in the Void Between the Worlds for eons. Naturally, he breaks out within the first chapter.
-   _The Great Alicorn Hunt_ has minor Arc Villain Malfunziona, a lesser cousin of Discord's who is basically a giant gremlin. His driving desire to break any complex technology he finds is why Equestria was stuck in Medieval Stasis for so long, until Bold Lion (an expy of Leonardo Da Vinci) locked him away in a secret compartment of a statue. He finally breaks his way free while Applejack's group is visiting a convention the statue is on display at and is resealed when Apple Bloom figures out how to design a prison that turns his own powers against him – he's locked inside a clockwork container that stays sealed because it's _already_ broken, and any attempts to break it open will actually _fix_ it, something Malfunziona's powers and nature won't allow him to do.
-   _How Do You Shoot a Gun with Hooves?_ has Tydal who turns out to be Not Evil, Just Misunderstood.

-   _Nine Days Down_: Tartarus serves as a prison and sealing place for ancient villains, demons, and entire species of monsters. While dangerous creatures remain around in Equestria, these are for the most part simply wild animals, more moderate bandits, or willing to leave alone if let alone. Everything else — the horrors and predators that delighted in preying on people and sowing destruction, that would not cooperate with civilization, leave others alone or change their ways — were eventually banished or forced to retreat into Tartarus, with only one another for company and kept under watch by the living consciousness of Tatarus itself, which delights in playing out endless horror stories and gloats over its prisoners like a dragon on its hoard.
-   _Pony POV Series_: In addition to Discord (who is imprisoned as in canon at the beginning of _Reharmonized Ponies_), the series has several others. One is Morning Star, Celestia's Fallen Alicorn brother, who was imprisoned for trying to take over the universe after deciding he was better than the Elders and being as evil as Discord if not worse. He was released by Havoc to fight in the Alicorn/Draconequi War, where he was either killed (though considering Evil still exists, he wasn't killed as thoroughly as it's possible to kill a God) or imprisoned in Hell (Havoc's domain) after the war as part of the peace treaty between the two according to Word of God. Another recurring one is Grogar, a G1 _My Little Pony_ villain and (in this series) Darkseid Expy who is sealed away in another dimension. It's stated he returns every five hundred years unless stopped and has to be resealed. In his case it may be justified because, in Dark World, he's been shown to be powerful enough to go toe to toe with Discord and have a chance of winning. Discord shows a great deal of anger that Grogar doesn't seem all that mad about this, in direct contrast to Discord himself, who can't _stand_ his can.
    -   There's also the Shadow of Chernobull, an entity created by Pandora and then locked in her Box, until a Hooviet experiment accidentally freed it, leading it to feeding on the Hooviets' existence and desires for a Super-Soldier, becoming General-Admiral Makarov (Big Bad of Shining Armor's side-story).
    -   Clover's story in the _7 Dreams/Nightmares_ collection reveals the existence of a group of Eldritch Abominations who fled into the POV reality when their own ended and tried to absorb all things into their Hive Mind in order to torment them for eternity. This offended both sets of the Elders (for different reasons), leading to them and their respective children working together to defeat these beings and seal them beyond the Gates of Tartarus. Notably, unlike most sealed evils, being sealed is having a negative effect on them; according to Rota Fortuna, unless they get loose and begin absorbing beings again, they'll devolve into little more than shadows of themselves (Luna states that this fate has actually already befallen many of them).
    -   At the end of the Wedding Arc, this is the final punishment that Cadence – now Queen of the Changelings after defeating Chrysalis – delivers on Kabuto, Chrysalis' Mad Scientist, for his many, many crimes. Since Cadence is a believer in Thou Shall Not Kill, she doesn't execute him, instead sealing him beneath the surface of the sun, completely aware, for a time equivalent to the sum total of all the years of life he's stolen from his victims. He'll be there for _several generations_, at least.
-   _The Power of the Equinox_ begins with Twilight Sparkle, trapped by Queen Chrysalis in the crystal caverns beneath Canterlot, striking a pitch-black crystal in her desperation and anger. Inside the cracked crystal awakens a malevolent being known as the Entity. It enters Twilight's body, transforming her into Dimmed Star.
-   _The Powers of Harmony_ has Nightmare Moon's corrupted army, which was sealed in Tartarus. Keeping them sealed, and then preventing Cetus from releasing them, is a driving part of the plot.
    -   Discord is also mentioned several times. Turns out, Harmony is trying to arrange his release simultaneously to her own, in order to purify them both and restore their balance.
-   _RainbowDoubleDash's Lunaverse:_ Corona starts off the series sealed inside the sun (she gets out, naturally). Discord, meanwhile, is not only in statue form, but Luna had the statue buried under a massive amount of cement (though she's well aware that if and when Discord gets out, that won't do _squat_, it's just to stop other people letting him out early). And then there's Tirek, who's been sealed away inside Tartarus for several thousand years (and who _doesn't_ want to get out.).
-   In _The Two Sides of Daring Do_, it's revealed Ahuizotl was this. He was sealed in a temple for a long period until an archaeological expedition released him. The story ends with him being temporarily sealed away when a temple collapses on his head and buries him alive, though it's established it won't keep him out of things forever.
-   _The Writing on the Wall_ has the eponymous writing warn anyone who comes to the structure of the dangers entombed beneath. But warnings like that are always just to scare away tomb robbers, right? It turns out it's a repository for nuclear waste, which is still radioactive enough to poison anypony exposed to it.

_Pokémon_

-   In _A New Chance For Adventure_ the attack on the Oldale Ruins by Team Magma releases an evil spirit that was responsible for the imprisonment of the Father Latios in the Soul Dew. And judging from Skailyn's anger, was responsible for a lot more evil in the ancient past.

_Teen Titans (2003)_

-   Double Subverted in _Transition_ after Jinx and Raven teleport back to earth unconcious the police put her into a Cryo-Prison due to her increased power levels, what they don't know is: A) Jinx isn't a villain any more and B) Her powers are now semi autonomous like Ravens, meaning putting her in cryosleep doesn't turn them off, it lets them do anything they want to get Jinx free without her mind holding them back with things like "concern for collateral damage" or "ability to tell friend from foe".

_Xiaolin Showdown_

-   _Demon of Wind_: This gets discussed in the story between characters as to why so many great evils are locked away instead of outrightly destroyed. It is also played with in the case of Rai who, though being locked away for being part of the bad guys, was at worst a Punch-Clock Villain, albiet an alarmingly effective one.

Dormant/Dead/Unsorted

-   John Carpenter's _Prince of Darkness_ had sealed evil in a can – The Anti-Christ, in fact, sealed in liquid form inside a giant glass and metal container in the basement of a church.

    Music 

-   _Bal-Sagoth_: Every song starts with "Oh shit, we just woke up Cthulhu." This is all the more impressive considering that (actually) awakening an elder god would crush the mind of anyone near it, then plunge the Earth into a neverending night.

    Myths & Religion 

-   In _The Bible_:
    -   The woman in the basket with the lead cover in one of Zechariah's visions in the Book of Zechariah, who is mentioned as being the personification of Wickedness.
    -   Specifically in the _Revelation_ (_not_ Revelations) of John, Satan is going to be confined to the bottomless pit for 1,000 years, after which he'll be released to wreak havoc upon the world one last time. Then God will smoke Satan's entire army at the Final Battle, and then he will be thrown into the Lake of Fire to stay.
-   Classical Mythology
    -   This trope harkens back to the Greek Mythology of Pandora's Box. The container itself is an unusual case, as it was created and given to her for no other reason than Zeus felt like being a dick. After seeing all the atrocities emanating from the box, Pandora quickly shut it, leaving only one thing inside – Hope. As aforementioned, all according to Zeus' plan.
    -   The Titans were locked inside Tartarus, a dank, gloomy prison "as far beneath Hades as heaven is high above the Earth", where they were guarded by their siblings the Hecatonchires.
    -   Typhon was trapped beneath Mount Etna by Zeus.
-   According to Islam, Dhu'l-Qarnayn, or "He of the Two Horns" (a lesser prophet who appeared long before Muhammad) encountered a race of monsters (split into two tribes, the _Yahjuj_ and _Mahjuj_, or Gog and Magog of Biblical fame) that were harassing the people, so he built a giant wall to keep them enclosed. They won't be able to escape until Allah says so, which will be during the lead-up to _Yawm al-Qiyāmah_ (the Day of Judgment).
-   Norse Mythology
    -   Unbreakable magic chains kept Fenrir (a gigantic wolf so massive that it must crouch down to avoid scraping against the dome of the sky) bound, until he eventually breaks them. Ironically, it is implied that binding him is what made him so pissed off at the gods in the first place. Well, that's the trouble with prophecies... and he is a child of Loki, God of betrayal, mischief, and "evil".
    -   That kind of thing happens a lot in Norse mythology. The gods were so afraid that Loki and his monstrous children might turn against them that they imprisoned them all in various unpleasant ways... thus ensuring their pissed off-ness and guaranteeing Ragnarök when they eventually get out.
        -   Please note that the gods didn't _just_ imprison Loki because they were scared (Who do you think they are, Greeks?). Loki and his children had been around long before this, some were even benevolent (read Sleipnir). The reason given in _Lokasenna_ is that he was being a particularly big dick, and it's possible that the punishment was also for manipulating Hodr into killing Balder.
    -   Ragnarök could be best be described as every Can in Norse Mythology opening at once. _Everything_ broke free. Jormungandr, Fenrir, Loki, the forces of Hel, Garm, etc.
-   Slavic Mythology: Koschei the Deathless was captured by Marya Morevna. She tried killing him, but he had a Soul Jar, so she locked him up instead... until he was accidentally freed by Ivan Tsarevitch, who then had to find a way to kill him.
-   According to Scientology's OT III, Xenu is apparently still locked up in a mountain somewhere.
-   The legends of genies often fall under this trope. Not all genies are good, ya see, and the good ones will interpret wishes literally. Moreover, the Ur-Example for many of the bad jinn/wicked ifrit stories is the tale that Solomon/Sulayman used his ring to seal (yes, seal, with molten lead and a magic seal ring) a number of bad jinn into brazen urns (which is a fancy name for brass cans) and cast them into the ocean, only to have them later dredged up as in stories like "The Fisherman and the Genie." And the genie is now full of even _more_ anger at humanity, for sealing it up, and is ready for vengeance. Since this has an evil spirit sealed in an actual can, this makes this trope Older Than Feudalism.

Most of the horrors of the series are caused by their minions, collectively called the Inner Dark, acting on their behalf and trying to free them.
-   _Trials & Trebuchets_: The Progenitor, a godlike being who is responsible for the destruction of the ancient Sheoran civilization, is trapped within the Sunken Hatch, which can only be opened by placing the Orbs of Progress, Power, Might, and Reverence into their respective slots in the hatch.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Fraggle Rock_: In the episode "Wembley and the Mean Genie," Wembley lets a Jackass Genie out of a bottle. The Genie refuses to grant any wishes, and instead breaks things, insults people, and tries to turn Wembley against his friends. At the end, he hypnotizes everyone but Wembley. When Wembley finally stands up for himself and demands his wishes (which apparently the Genie can't twist), he gets them and uses them to free his friends.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Champions_: In the adventure _The Blood and Dr. McQuark_, Azor (an agent of some Eldritch Abominations) was imprisoned by the Council of Nine but escapes during the course of the adventure.
-   _Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine_: The Titov family, messed up though it may be, exists to keep _something_ chained beneath its shrine. It may or may not be Iolithae Septimian, a Humanoid Abomination Reality Warper.
-   _Deadlands_: A group of Native Americans sealed off "The Hunting Grounds" (affecting all magic, good or ill, but ill vastly outnumbered good). Centuries later, another group unsealed it, looking for revenge on the white man for killing off their tribes.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   In 4th Edition, the _entire plane_ of Baator is like this, being created by a divine curse to imprison the Magnificent Bastard Asmodeus and the devils. Unfortunately, said can is rather _flimsy_, and, while it does a good job of holding Asmodeus, any infernalist worth his salt can create a temporary portal to it, allowing the devils to stream through and wreak havoc and contracts. The seal, for the record, wasn't made to save mortals from Asmodeus and his devils – but to save the other gods from him. Hence why mortals are free to poke holes at the seal and let devils come and do Faustian pacts. If you are dumb enough to do it, you deserve what's coming to you.
    -   The Shadowfell in 5th Edition can also become one of these. As the Shadowfell is a reflection of the darker aspects of the material planes it connects to, acts of terrible evil can cause dark powers to surge and grow in the Shadowfell. This can end up creating areas known as "dread domains", which are their own planes of existence of tremendous evil energy which grant power to the mortal who created it. Dangerous creatures from the Shadowfell will often seize the evil person who created the dread domain and trap them there to feed on their powers, and good deities can banish these same dark lords to the dread domain to imprison them. It is usually very difficult to escape from these places, as frequently the only way to get free from a dread domain is to find redemption.
    -   _D&D_ 3.5e:
        -   One example is the homebrewed Harrowed class. Anyone with this class is this for their own unique destructive being that they call "the monster within", which is constantly raging to get free from its host. Ironically, if the beast were to be released it would be promptly obliterated by about seven different gods at once; this won't ever happen though because plenty of greater deities have been left scratching their heads after failing to remove the beasts. This class cannot even use any of their abilities without provoking the beast and needing to make a will save or let it gain control for a few rounds of combat. If you think that the Harrowed are justified in wanting to die, they aren't. They are stuck in a constant cycle of reincarnation after they die and they always come back as another Harrowed with exactly the same homicidal beast sealed inside them. They are such a tight can that not even death or the gods can crack them open.
        -   Layer 73 of the Abyss, the Wells of Darkness, is essentially a giant holding pen for these. It holds previous lords of the Abyss who their replacements couldn't or wouldn't kill, evil gods who turned the rest of their pantheons against them, and the odd Eldritch Abomination. Visitors to the layer tend to either be worshipers of the imprisoned beings paying them homage... or entities working to _keep_ them locked up.
    -   _Scarred Lands_:
        -   In the Back Story the current gods sealed the evil gods that ruled before them, each in a different way befitting them and tailored so that their powers couldn't get them out. For instance, Thulkas, the Iron Lord, was so strong that he couldn't be moved, so he was _hammered into an arrow and shot into the sun_.
        -   The Scarred Lands also has the Slarecians, psionic beings who challenged both the gods and the titans. The twist is that they sealed _themselves_ into the can so they wouldn't be destroyed.
    -   _B3: Palace of the Silver Princess_: In the published version, a huge ruby called My Lady's Heart turns out to be a Canopener for an evil Immortal, Arik. Even the _leakage_ of Arik's power which the gem emits is enough to petrify a royal court, trap its best defenders in a dimensional prison, and attract monsters and fanatical dark priests from hundreds of miles around.
    -   An important part of Eberron is that there are multiple Sealed Evils in various Cans, with sealants as strong as the plot demands of them. There are three big ones, as well as a number of more localized ones:
        -   The Overlords of the Age of Demons, aka the Rakshasa Rajahs, are the closest thing to actual Physical Gods confirmed to exist in the setting. They were big-time Abusive Precursors and were eventually defeated after a war with the dragons and locked in prisons in Khyber, where they are kept in (mostly) suspended animation. Releasing them would be a _massive_ undertaking requiring very fine manipulation of specific prophesied events (different for each Overlord) to pop their can, as attested by the fact that they've had minions working on the problem for millennia and only managed to spring _one_ (and that one was re-sealed in a year). Per Word of God, it's set up like this so that you _can_ make an Overlord being unleashed the climax of your story or otherwise a major point, or you can just say that nothing particularly major is prophesied for the next 200 years or so and deal with some of the _other_ problems facing the setting.
        -   The quori, malevolent nightmare spirits, are trapped in their own dimension because it's been knocked off its metaphysical axis, preventing travel to and from other planes<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . The quori mostly get around this by projecting themselves into mortal dreams and possessing people, since while their bodies can't leave Dal Quor, their _minds_ can...
        -   The Daelkyr were Humanoid Abominations and the generals of an army of creatures from the Realm of Madness that invaded the mortal world several millennia ago (before the modern nations, but well after the dragon-demon war went down). They lost and got sealed with most of their minions in Khyber, though unlike the Overlords they're still awake and can move around, so long as they don't come to the surface or try to go home, both of which they're prevented from doing by special druidic seals. They do still have a disturbing amount of leeway for Sealed Evils, though.
        -   The setting's Creation Myth has the progenitor dragons (Siberys, Eberron and Khyber) create the planes of existence and the sun, then, when Khyber turned on the others and murdered Siberys, Eberron trapped Khyber within her coils and became the world, starting a cycle of great evil being bound through desperate sacrifice that was mirrored in all of the above examples.
    -   _Ptolus_ is set on the world of Praemal, which exists as a giant can in which to seal evil. The city of Ptolus itself is built on top of a can or ten and has a giant, impossibly high spire in it where a cleric once, long ago, tried to seal all the evils of the world in a can. Then he became evil, and eventually his fortress atop the spire was itself sealed with the remains of his work (and his remains) within it. It's a pretty can-heavy setting.
    -   _Nentir Vale_: Torog, god of torture and imprisonment, is another notable (and, given his portfolio, ironic) example. The kicker? The earth is his can. He's trapped in the Underdark, actively crawling around down there, and occasionally reaches up from below the earth to pull whole cities down into his can with him.
    -   _Greyhawk_: Zuggtmoy (in the Temple of Elemental Evil), Iuz and Fraz-Urb-Iuu (in Castle Greyhawk) and Tharizdun (in his Forgotten Temple).
    -   _Midnight (2003)_: There is the evil god Izrador, who was sealed (along with some other beings) in the world of Aryth. The bad part? Your characters live on Aryth and they're also sealed there. Not only is the evil in the can but you're in the can with it. Crapsack World indeed.
    -   _Forgotten Realms_: One of the oldest cans would be the Sharn Wall, erected by the creatures which gave it its name so as to keep the phaerimms sealed away from Faerûn. Weakened severely over the millennia, it is later brought down by the return of the Shadovar, who then must team up with the Sharn and the peoples of Toril to drive the phaerimm back. Other examples include: the djinn Calim and the efreet Memnon, locked in eternal struggle forever, their battle creating the Calimshan Desert; Sarya Dlardrageth and the rest of her fallen house of demon-interbred Elves, trapped in the Nameless Dungeon beneath Hellgate Keep, who are inadvertently freed when the Mistmaster and his Harper allies destroy Ascalhorn's mythal with the Gatekeeper's crystal; Iyachtu Xvim, son (and receptacle) of Bane, imprisoned beneath Zhentil Keep until he breaks free in the wake of Fzoul Chembryl's reading of _The True Life of Cyric_; an illithid and a rakshasa that became trapped in stasis beneath Beorunna's Well after seeking revenge on Runlatha for their previous imprisonment and torture and who are even now (by using an image of the rakshasa to pretend to be the totem spirit of the Red Tiger Clan) trying to obtain the cooperation of the Uthgardt barbarians in securing their freedom; and the three nycaloths accidentally freed from their dimensional pocket by the flight of "a red dragon that never held malice or greed in its heart over the coronal's throne" – which leads directly to the Weeping War and the fall of Myth Drannor.
    -   The artifact known as the Acorn of Wo Mai holds an evil demigod called the Copper Tyrant of Tros that will try to trick anyone possessing the Acorn into letting it loose.
    -   Most of the titular monsters in the 3.5e sourcebook _Elder Evils_ qualify, with the exceptions being Atropus and Ragnorra, both of which are completely free to roam the universe, killing or corrupting (respectively) everything they encounter. Father Llymic is a Far Realm entity that's sealed in a glacier, the Hulks of Zoretha are slumbering alien superweapons, the Leviathan is the chaos left over from creating the world given physical form and put to sleep at the bottom of the ocean, Pandorym is a phenomenally powerful entity whose mind and body have been separated and sealed far away from civilization and each other, Sertrous is a dead obyrith whose spirit is trapped in his skull, Kyuss is a would-be god who is sealed in an obelisk on an isolated island, and Zargon is the previous ruler of Baator, who was imprisoned by Asmodeus in a giant rock under a desert.
    -   _Dark Sun_ setting. After the Champions of Rajaat realize that Rajaat's Cleansing Wars are actually attempted genocide, they seal him in a prison dimension.
    -   _Dragon_ magazine #46 adventure "The Temple of Poseidon''. The Cthulhuoid Dark King Ythog-Nthlei (AKA Zoth Ommog) was sealed into a sarcophagus hundreds of years before the adventure begins. Unless the PCs can stop it, he will be released during the adventure.
    -   The Amber Temple in Barovia in the Ravenloft setting is an entire temple dedicated to this concept. Evil gods upon evil gods (implied to be the Dark Powers themselves in the 5th edition update) sealed in giant blocks of amber. Of course, a temple filled with dark gods sounds like a perfect idea that'll never go wrong, doesn't it?
    -   Tharizdun (mentioned above under Greyhawk) has gradually evolved to be a Greater-Scope Villain for the entire D&D multiverse, so it's a good thing the Gods did a damn good job in sealing him. They placed him in his own personal prison universe, and he still hasn't gotten out (keep in mind, this happened before the world as we know it existed).
-   _In Nomine_:
    -   One of the prophecies for Armageddon is "An ancient evil breaks its bonds." One of the possibilities for fulfilling this is Magog, Demon Prince of Cruelty, who was sealed in an ancient Egyptian tomb exactly one day after falling from Heaven.
    -   The Archangel David keeps an immense amber gemstone — the very first amber, in fact, based on which the common mineral was designed — in his realm in Heaven. The amber appears to hold an insect within it, but the creature is in fact a terrible mistake from the early days of creation that David imprisoned in the gem.
    -   There is a rumor among angels that Uriel's recall to the Upper Heavens is a lie, and that what actually happened was that the Seraphim Council judged him dangerously insane and chained him beneath Gabriel's Volcano, trapping him with Gabriel's power and an endless dream woven by Blandine. Supposedly, the Archangel of Purity is trapped there still, dreaming of escape and vengeance. Supposedly...
-   _Iron Kingdoms_: The Skorne have Ancestral Guardians, which are statues empowered by the souls of fallen Skorne warriors.
-   _The Madness Dossier_: In 535 AD, a successful revolution sealed the monstrous Anunnakku, the true rulers of humanity, in the ultimate special container; non-existence. Unfortunately, that containment is breaking down. Individual Anunnakku (or small groups) may appear as "Irruptors" when and where reality glitches badly enough.
-   _Neuroshima_: There are a number of items scattered around the world which adventurers refer to as Pandora's boxes. Each is a large metal canister that contains something nasty (from a biological weapon to a very compact assassin droid). Everyone knows what they are but humans being humans, every once in a while someone opens one, either because of the Schmuck Bait involved or in some desperate gambit against his enemies.
-   _Pathfinder_: A common trope in _Pathfinder_; Golarion has _many_ hidden cans of evil, some of which are now breaking open due to the recent death of humanity's patron deity.
    -   The most notable can is Golarion itself, which holds Rovagug, the "Rough Beast" and god of destruction. He resembles a giant arthropod and seeks nothing more than to undo the works of the other gods and destroy creation itself. Faced with this foe, good and evil deities alike joined forces to destroy him, and many lost their lives. In the end it was Sarenrae and Asmodeus who managed to take him down, with Sarenrae battling him for long enough that Asmodeus was able to seal him within Golarion with a special key. Rovagug is still there within the world, where his struggles are blamed for volcanoes and earthquakes. The Pit of Gormuz (a twenty-mile-wide chasm) is a weak spot in his prison, and while Rovagug himself can't get out, he _can_ periodically release some new Spawn on the world to continue his work (the most famous of which is the Tarrasque). There's a reason why the natives of Golarion's neighboring planets refer to it as the Cage.
    -   Numerous other examples dot the world.
        -   Runelords, ancient tyrannical wizard-kings and -queens, sealed themselves away to escape an ancient catastrophe, and several adventures deal with their cans being breached from without or within and releasing them into the world.
        -   The elves trapped the plant-corrupting demon Treerazer in the portion of their nation he had already claimed.
        -   The Whispering Tyrant, the world's most infamous lich, lay imprisoned within his former fortress and guarded by an entire nation of paladins. Then he managed to escape his prison, wiped out the paladins in less than a week and promptly restarted his plans for world conquest.
        -   An island where an ancient Magocracy trapped its enemies and mistakes behind an impenetrable magical wall has been repurposed by a gold dragon and his allies into serving as a prison for fiends, Eldritch Abominations, evil wizards and other terrors, who are all unceremoniously shoved inside and left to sort themselves out.
        -   The Bottle of the Bound, a nearly literal example, is a metal bottle containing an army of 666 fiends trapped there by an ancient emperor after a horribly botched summoning ritual, which can be summoned (albeit only one at a time) by anyone who wields the bottle and tracks down its three lost command words. Its most powerful prisoner is the daemonic demigod Zelishkar the Bitter Flame, but numerous other devils, daemons and demons of considerable power are held within it as well.
        -   The Tarrasque itself was sealed in a cave after it destroyed the nation of Ninshabur in -632 AR, given that literally nothing can kill it the best any player characters unfortunate enough to fight it can hope for is re-sealing it.
    -   Many published modules and adventure paths involve the player characters stopping some sealed evil from being unleashed – "Realm of the Fellnight Queen", "Pact Stone Pyramid", and "From Shore to Sea" just to name a few.
    -   The Adventure Path _Reign of Fire_ has the Big Bad and his army in a scroll, which happens to be the anchor for a demi-plane that served as the vacation home for an ancient wizard. When the party opens the scroll(They can find out what it is, but won't know who's in it, so it's pretty inevitable), he and his army naturally escape and close it up with them in it. The party then has to deal with the remaining factions in the plane, such as the creatures forced to create it, or deserters from the Big Bad's army that decided to stay.
    -   There is one extremely secretive organization, the Seal-Breakers, who have put considerable time and effort into tracking down all of Golarion's various cans and cracking them open one after the other in the name of breaking down the artificial order of the world and giving birth to a truer reality – or of destroying the universe, they don't much care. They were partially responsible for freeing the Whispering Tyrant, and further plan to see Treerazer released from his own prison, invoke a variety of ancient slumbering entities, and ultimately split Golarion itself open to unleash Rovagug upon the universe.
-   _Rifts_:
    -   According to _Mindwerks_, the Philosopher's Stone is actually a prison for an incredibly powerful Eldritch Abomination. The Stone's owner unconsciously forms a mental bond with the Stone, and as he uses the Stone's fantastic powers, he becomes more and more corrupted by it.
    -   The Host are powerful, evil demons who were sealed in a very tight can indeed – it's almost impossible to find their dimensional prison except by blind luck, they need a summoner to willingly sacrifice themselves by allowing the demon to take over their body and soul (and most people willing to call upon such evil creatures would be nowhere near selfless enough to consider doing such a thing), and even once freed they categorically cannot cross between dimensions without another such summoning without being struck Deader than Dead.
-   _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_: The Chaos God Slaanesh, while lazing about from a feast of souls, got jumped by the newly ascended Elven gods and imprisoned between the realms of Ulgu and Hysh. The absence from his seat of power allowed the upstart Skaven god, the Horned Rat to usurp his place amongst the Ruinous Powers.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Daemon weapons contain bound daemons within them, giving them incredible power and just as incredible malevolence. However, the greatest threat isn't them escaping, but rather corrupting the weapon's wielder and twisting them to its will.
    -   More powerful daemons, who couldn't at the time be banished back to the Warp, are often sealed in the Materium in some way that prevents them from killing everything at the moment, perhaps in the hope that they can be banished later. This being WH40K, not only does the sealing frequently make things worse, but most of the time those doing the sealing _never tell anyone about it_.
    -   Both literal and metaphorical in the case of the Necrons and their C'tan masters (later retconned to have actually been shattered by the Necrons and chained), who sealed _themselves_ deep beneath the surface of numerous worlds approximately **sixty million years ago**. The most powerful C'tan, the Void Dragon, is _buried underneath Mars_ after the Emperor defeated him in a titanic fight. The new Necron superheavy unit, the Tesseract Vault, is essentially an attempt at weaponising this trope by taking a C'tan trapped in a high-tech device to keep it caged, and then having that device float around the battlefield dropping meteors on people. In an emergency, the Nemesors can disable the seals and let the C'tan loose.
    -   The God-Emperor is either a Sealed Evil, a Sealed Good or a Sealed Badass, depending on one's perspective.
    -   During the Great Crusade, the Emperor sought to gain access to the Webway. In a top-secret chamber deep beneath his palace on Terra, he constructed a massive machine that allowed him to breach it. He had to put some heavy-duty psychic wards around the place to keep daemons from using the gate to enter Terra. Unfortunately, Magnus the Red broke those wards to tell him of Horus' betrayal. Since then, the Emperor has sat on the Golden Throne, using his psychic might (and the might of thousands of daily psyker sacrifices) to keep that gate closed.
-   White Wolf:
    -   _Exalted_:
        -   In the prehistory of Creation, the defeated Primordials were stitched into the twisted body of their god-king Malfeas and confined to another realm... mainly because the Exalted looked upon the Primordials who _had_ been killed, saw that they'd brought the Underworld into existence, and said, "Yeah, that ain't supposed to happen."
        -   There are also the Neverborn, the aforementioned Primordials that _had_ been killed. Being too big to die properly, they instead wrapped themselves up in giant sarcophagi spanning infinite distances as they resisted the pull of Oblivion. Then the Solars decided to pop a few blocks open to learn Necromancy...
        -   From the perspective of the Bronze Faction, this was the case when the Solar Exaltations that they locked in the Jade Prison for ~2000 years, due to the Solars having grown increasingly tyrannical, corrupt and depraved, were broken free and scattered across the world to find new hosts.
    -   _Scion_ uses the same logic in regards to the Titans. At the end of the Titanomachy, the gods bound them away in the Underworld because the Titans were incarnations of things such as Light, Fire, Darkness, Life, and Water, and their death would screw with reality big time. This was proven when Ymir was killed... causing the Great Flood, as the Ice Age ended right then and there.
    -   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_: The Uktena make a trade of this; one of their camps, the Bane Tenders, possesses secretive rites that allow them to seal away Banes too powerful to kill, so that they can't get out and wreak havoc on the world.
        -   This is also the grand view of the Wyrm, whose evil was not the cause of his sealing, but vice versa; the Weaver, herself a bit batshit at the time, decided to trap the Wyrm within her webs, driving it mad and shifting its purpose from "a blessed end to all things" to "reality cancer, forever and ever." Some of its most devout cultists seek to undo the Weaver's webs so that the Wyrm can be set free. Unfortunately, since those webs make up a good chunk of reality...
        -   A literal (but downplayed) example comes from the Pentex Corporation of the Werewolf setting. One of their subsidiaries, a brewery, sometimes includes a minor bane (corrupted/evil nature spirit) in a can of beer, to be drunk by a member of the unsuspecting public. This might have the effect of turning the poor sap into a spirit/human hybrid (fomor), or just cause them to make life miserable for themselves and everyone around them just a little bit more.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_ has the Toa Seal, an impenetrable restrictive force made of protodermis created by combining six Toa's Elemental Powers, but only if they're blasted at the target in unison. The only thing capable of undoing the seal is the same Toa projecting their powers into either the seal itself or a disconnected fragment of it. Different media depict Toa Seals differently:
    -   When the Toa Mata trap Cahdok and Gahdok in a protodermis cage in the comics, the effect is a criss-crossing bond of glowing energy constricting them. In the online animations, the cage is more like a plane of glass filled with _liquid_ protodermis that keeps Cahdok and Gahdok in stasis, but they can still move their eyes and blow bubbles. The Toa later undo the seal when they learn Cahdok and Gahdok are Not Evil, Just Misunderstood.
    -   In the animated films, Makuta Teridax is encased in crystalline protodermis by the Toa Metru. The crystal puts Makuta's body in absolute stasis, but his mind is free to call out to his servants Sidorak and Roodaka. Roodaka manages to chip off a fragment of crystal, and by coercing the Toa with a ploy to shoot their powers at her, the energies also hit the fragment and undo the seal, allowing Makuta to burst free.

    Theme Parks 

-   _Lost Island Theme Park_'s Volkanu is a malevolent fire demon trapped inside the park's volcano through the creation of the mystical Ora Tika idol channeling the power of the four elements. The theft of the idol by six thieves cursed into Stone Guardians allows Volkanu and his lava minions to begin emerging to destroy the island, setting the stage for the _Volkanu: Quest for the Golden Idol_ dark ride.

    Web Animation 

-   _Dreamscape_: The Overlord of Evil is currently sealed in the Underworld...but that seal is weakening. In "The Mystery of Melinda", Drake and Keedran had to upgrade it to a Sealed Evil in a Six Pack. Before that, he was sealed away in the Sky Dimension, because the angel guards had to seal the entire dimension away after Curien and Ethan created an irreversible dark rift there.
    -   Melinda is currently sealed in a Blank White Void dimension...but that seal is weakening. In addition, breaking seals like these is her specialty. Before that, she was locked away in her Ominous Floating Castle. Getting into a conflict with her sister, Betty, will break the seal, but Betty wasn't even aware of Melinda's existence. Even while sealed away, she was able to manipulate Melissa into becoming her apprentice.
-   _HTF +_: Rainbow Dash deletes the file of Luna Game on the computer and thus defeating Evil Pinkie Pie in HTF+CC 2, but in HTF+FI/RF 1 she is freed from the recycle bin by FI Creepybloom.
-   _No Evil_ has this in the form of the Black Tezcatlipoca, which is sealed away at the start of the series into Xochipilli, Ixtlilton, and Xochiquetzal, the seals taking the form of earmuffs, an eye mask, and a brooch, which contains the magical goo in exchange for robbing each of the three of their hearing, sight, and voice, respectively. The fourth member, Xipe Totec, gave up her immortality as part of this arrangement. This is acknowledged as a temporary fix, until they can find someone who can put an end to it for good.
    -   Though, if you read the prequel comic carefully, it explains that they formed a contract with the Black Tezcatlipoca for it to seal the Red Tezcatlipoca in exchange for their senses and immortality, essentially dealing with the issue by turning it into the can sealing another potentially world-ending entity. As seen when Charles unwittingly unleashes the Red, and it's all-consuming inferno, in episode 34.

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Dwarfs, the Spirit and the Sorceress_, a _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_ Fan Webcomic, Zoso was this – in a rock – until the beginning, and is sealed again – in a medallion – at the end.
-   _Bronze Skin Inc._: In the second chapter, Julia awakens the captain's ghost by touching the anchor he is sealed to.
-   In _The Adventures of Shan Shan_, Julius is worried because the sealed evils have managed to touch the physical dimension.
-   _Charby the Vampirate_ had a an old evil sealed inside two of the main characters, slightly subverted since it had originally been sealed by an amateurish effort to defeat it, only to reseal it with a tighter lid later after it got loose. We didn't learn that evil came in cans until after the fact.
-   _Crow Time_: In "Marble", there's a Elder God stuck in a _marble_.
-   An extremely literal example in _Cthulhu Slippers_ with 'Can O' Shoggoth' a product that is 100% fatal 100% of the time.
-   In _Cucumber Quest_, the Nightmare Knight. At that, every 5000 years, someone manages to unseal it. Cucumber finds this a bit depressing, but with Nautilus' help, he concludes that he can try to work out how to really end it.
-   In _Girl Genius_, the Other is a being of such extreme evil that it wants to enslave the world... and doesn't really care who dies in the process. It was eventually defeated, but nobody knows HOW... except maybe the parents and uncle of the protagonist. It left a machine behind with a copy of itself, which it then imprinted on the protagonist (unsealing it), who is the daughter of the Other, or rather, taking into account certain implications and statements that lend themselves towards it having been an actually ancient evil, it simply possessed the protagonist's mother, and hundreds of other people through time, before finally taking possession of the protagonist, temporarily.
-   The Axe of Prissan in _Goblins_ acts as a prison for an immensely powerful demon lord, whose very existence threatened the mortal plane. The enchantments binding the prison will gradually break down if the axe is not used for good, or even faster if used for evil. As such, it has enchantments layered on it to ensure it will aid any paladin who encounters it and refresh the prison. Later on it is revealed that the Axe is exploiting this trope. It's actually a _conduit_ "the Sacred" needs to cross from the hells into the mortal realm. The Axe was always intended to break; the legend about paladins needing to wield it ensured the one holding it would be a paladin, whose souls are delicious. It's also revealed at the same time there exist three Prissans. The first is a hammer that contains good; the second is the Axe; and the third contains "the Damned".
-   The plot of _Homestuck_ ends (and also begins, due to Stable Time Loops) this way. As revealed in the finale of Homosuck, when the Alpha kids face off against Caliborn, Dirk attempts to destroy his soul, but instead traps it inside of the puppet Lil' Cal. This seals him away from the time being, but ironically, this enables Cal to be the host for Lord English, the Big Bad of the series.
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_, space villain Fructose Riboflavin gets turned into Pure Energy and stuffed into a _battery_. He doesn't stay there for long, though. More recently, there's the ancient Japanese treasure monster.

-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_:
    -   The Red-Eyed King was the largest and most powerful demon lord ever to exist, and the Gods sealed him away because he was so foul they had no way to permanently kill him. He was eventually freed by God of Evil Aesma (she fell in love with him), who later beat him into submission and re-sealed him after he spurned her. At the current time of the comic (which takes place over thirty Kalpa<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  later), The Red-Eyed King is little but a myth and presumably ceased to be relevant long ago.
    -   Himself, the King of Devils, is sealed in a Tailor-Made Prison inside a deep pit beneath Throne by his own people. Being a reality-defying Eldritch Abomination means no-one wants him around, though exactly why the devils are the ones guarding his prison is unknown.
    -   During _Breaker of Infinities_ Jagganoth is subjected to this courtesy of Solomon David, who expends all his power in an attempt to remove Jagganoth from Creation. He is sealed away for the duration of the Time Skip, but is slowly undoing his binding from the inside.
-   _Mystery Babylon_ has the Pit, into which every demon on Earth save one was imprisoned 1,000 years ago. The final remaining demon, Mystery Babylon, is prophesied to one day break the seal on the Pit and release the others, thereby causing the Apocalypse.
-   On sale in the Gift Shop of Death in _Neko the Kitty_.
-   _The Order of the Stick_ features The Snarl, a monster formed from tangles in the fabric of reality, and sealed within the world itself.
-   Umbria/Zaedalkaah from _Our Little Adventure_, who was blindly released by the heroine.
-   In _Jenny and the Multiverse_, Lord Grallyx was "sealed inside the skin of the Sun" by the 'Disciples of Light' in an Alternate Universe until he was accidentally summoned to Mystepolia by Laura's machine.
-   _Lovely Lovecraft_: The shoggoth imprisoned at Miskatonic University.
-   In _Schlock Mercenary_, it looks like Oisri is a massive prison for the dark matter entities like the ones which destroyed the galaxy in the alternate timeline. Petey thinks it's something far worse.
    
    **Petey**: To my analysis, Oisri is not a vessel for imprisoning a dark-matter creature. It was a machine for creating one.
    
-   _Tower of God_: Inside Baylord Yama's floating fortress, the cage, it's said that a gigantic beast is imprisoned that he fought and defeated. It turns out the prisoner is really his older brother Baylord Doom, who's also being used as the real source of the power of the canine people in the Cage. In a further twist, when the Sealed Evil is released by rebellious canine people, he ultimately turns out less like an overwhelming threat and more like a potential puppet for the Man Behind the Man.
-   Inverted in _The Way of the Metagamer_: the evil is sealed within the Book, and does not escape... but the heroes are forced to follow it into the Book.
-   Subverted in _8-Bit Theater_. Red Mage places the fire demon Kary in a Bag of Holding and freezes it with a powerful Ice spell, with the idea that she will remain sealed until they are powerful enough to defeat her. White Mage simply smashes the frozen bag in revenge for the death of Black Belt.
-   In _Flaky Pastry_, Nitrine discovers that Moirganae (the evil vampire created by Morgana) has been trapped in the belt-buckle of her Powered Armor for all the time since their fight. Moirganae promises to fight Nitrine's enemies and suck their blood whenever she gets summoned – until she becomes powerful enough to free herself, that is. Then she'll kill Nitrine.
-   _Angel Moxie_: All the villains start out like this but Tristan unleashes Vashi and she releases the rest of them. It's later revealed that One Minion escaped being sealed by the heroes predecessors and was working on freeing Vashi all along.
-   Blackburn, a dangerous pirate/witch in _Jackie Rose_. Most of the season one is trying prevent her from escaping. Unfortunately, the villain of the first season, Desanto, finds out that _his_ blood will be able to break the seal.
-   _Paranatural_: More than a few.
    -   The spirit in Max's bat is a grudge, an insane spirit pumped up on pain and rage. It's unclear what it was originally like, but at this point it is nothing but a mad animal that lashes out at everything in reach. While it is still recovering in the bat, it can't do anything, but Max still gets access to its magnet powers.
    -   Max is also unknowingly possessed by a piece of a "broken god," an entity that terrifies Doorman and seems to be part of the vague "evil" of Mayview. It's still recovering, but it's implied that something very bad will happen if it manages to escape its prison. And since Max doesn't even know he is a prison, the spirit is learning quite a few dangerous secrets through him.
    -   Spender is possessed by an incredibly powerful shadow spirit, only contained by the constant efforts of the light spirit in his glasses. It is implied to be the "biggest spirit" that Spender defeated years ago.
    -   Mayview itself is contained in a massive bubble that keeps spirits, spectrals, and their powers from crossing the barrier in either direction. Spender dodges the question when Max asks why it exists, but it likely has something to do with the "evil" he mentions sleeping in the town, and the power that people are constantly seeking.
    -   Francisco Guerra has a number of powerful spirits contained in Tools. At least one is an angry god who wishes to usher in the apocalypse and destroy all humankind. Guerra uses it as target practice.

-   Many, many things contained by the _SCP Foundation_.
    
    -   SCP-076-2 ("Able") has the particularity of coming with his own (leaky) can, SCP-076-1, and the SCP Foundation (after many Pyrrhic Victories keeping it _in_ the can) eventually decided to try and work with him; predictably, it didn't end well.
    -   SCP-231-7 ("Special Personnel Requirements") _is_ the can for...whatever End of the World as We Know It entity it is that she carries. And the Foundation has to do some horrible stuff to keep it in there. Trust us, You Do NOT Want To Know.
    -   SCP-557 ("Ancient Containment Site"). Around 2,400 B.C. a tomb was built to be a prison for supernatural beings. Sometime later the "bastard son of Apep" (SCP-557-1) was captured with the help of the gods and secured in the tomb by being chained to a block of granite. Around 300 A.D. the last Keeper (guard) of the tomb died. In 1988 a geological survey team stumbled across the site and somehow released SCP-557-1 from confinement.
    -   SCP-1739 ("Obsolete Laptop"). SCP-1739 contains an Eldritch Abomination by creating an Alternate Universe. The Abomination is distracted by being allowed to destroy the Alternate Universe, keeping it from destroying the universe it's in.
    -   SCP-2317 ("A Door to Another World"). On the other side of the door is a desert, and buried in a hidden chamber beneath that desert is a 200 kilometer-tall humanoid being who is restrained by seven chains, six of which have already broken, with it being believed that the entity will escape into our world when the seventh breaks as well. The Foundation is carrying out a regular ritual to maintain the last chain until they can figure out how to repair the others. Except that's a lie designed to avoid panic — the ritual does nothing, no one in the Foundation has any idea how to repair the chains, and they estimate that the last will break in 30 to 100 years, with no way to stop it.
    -   Subverted with SCP-3758 ("The Last Dodo"), about an entity named Hualiet which will only be freed when all but one dodo is extinct. The dodo they interview talks about him like one of these, but only because their culture treats ideas like "maybe stop torturing people" and "let's learn how to make buildings" as heretical. Unfortunately his banishment to the "poison light fields" has resulted in Hualiet becoming enormous and lethally radioactive, so the Foundation is secretly maintaining a dodo population to keep him banished.
    
    **Foundation Ethics Committee:** Given the choice between letting an ancient martyr's eternal damnation continue, or setting loose a walking Chernobyl, I'm afraid we can only afford to go with the former.
    
-   BEN of _Ben Drowned_ is within a Majora's Mask Nintendo 64 cartridge, though how he originally got inside is relatively unknown.
    -   As revealed in THE FATHER.wmv, BEN might not even be the worst thing contained within that cartridge...
-   _Neopets_ now has its very own Sealed Evil In A Can, as of the end of the Return of Dr. Sloth plot event that happened January 29 – March 15, 2008. The comic is here and spoilers are here: Dr. Frank Sloth is the sealed evil. The can is the Space Faerie's token. Roll your mouse over the very last panel of the last chapter, and you'll see the token, which was not destroyed in the explosion of the ship, floating through space. When it gets most of the way across the panel, a pair of red eyes glow from within...
-   _Phantasia_ has more than one of these, of varying degrees of world-destroying power.
-   The Big Bad of the second year in _The Questport Chronicles_ starts out as Sealed Evil in a Mirror.
-   This Uncyclopedia article lapses into this trope in the last two sections, in a hilariously meta way.
-   In the _Noob_ in-game backstory, the Empire once created a very dangerous artificial being known as Tabris. The Sources of life and death, the setting's Physical Gods, weren't happy with this and made the Empire destroy them in exchange of allocating a little of their magic power to fuel most of the newly-created technology that relied on a very limited resource at the time. After this, that limited resource was used only for the essential and/or top-secret stuff, in case the Sources changed their mind. That top-secret stuff included a place in which Tabris was held prisoner after being officially destroyed. A few thousand years later, an attack on Centralis, the Empire's capital, put a strain on all its energy sources and Tabris' prison was one of the places that ended up without power.
-   The Celle Neues Rathaus in _Bedtime Stories (YouTube Channel)_ has the entire basement section. Flooded by the SS just days before the Western Allies entered the area, the US forces stationed there decided to send three divers into said flooded basement. What the lone surviving diver found down there was pretty unsettling to say the least. Thus, when the British took over the area, they immediately sealed the access points to the basement with concrete, which was a good move.
    -   In a later episode, there's the titular "Entity of Tsarichina", an Ancient Evil being capable of communicating with aliens and supernatural beings in order to help it get released. Upon being unearthed by a Bulgarian Army expedition, it goes on a rampage, killing any and all humans that it comes across. Thankfully, a team of Army Engineers blows the cave it was found in, burying it once more.
-   _Fire Emblem on Forums_ has a few examples, generally as the Big Bad or Final Boss of any given roleplay:
    -   _Chains of Horai_: The God of Curses, a "foreign god" that the Gods of the Land sealed away at the cost of a Heroic Sacrifice by one of their ranks.
    -   _Final Hour_: Chaos, sealed away in the dimension on the other side of the Waygates.
    -   _Gates of Rundum_: The eponymous Rundum (or one of them, anyway), a demon-god who the players must beat down to seal.
-   _The Crawlspace_: The Monstrous Humanoid creature apparently lives in the crawlspace, the entrance of which is a small, locked door in the master bathroom. Of course, the girls just had to open it, didn’t they?
-   _Overlord DVD_:
    -   Harvey Cthulhu is an Eldritch Abomination who Doomcock has sealed within a container. Harvey frequently tries to get Doomcock or the viewers to press the button that will release him and allow him to destroy the world.
    -   The Skull of Calderón was once an Evil Sorcerer who was beheaded by Doomcock, his still-living skull now stuck in a bubble of entropy.
    -   Omnivac is de facto sealed by the fact that Doomcock _refuses_ to give Omnivac any kind of internet connection, lest he take over the world first!

## Qual

Frieren sealed the evil demon mage Qual because he proved too powerful to defeat.
