_"If there's one thing to learn, it's you just can't go wrong,  
If you follow your heart, and end with a song."  
\[elaborate song and dance number\]_

A film or TV show, despite not previously having been a musical, ends with a Crowd Song (possibly a traditional musical number, more likely lip-synced to an existing recording) involving a significant portion of the cast without regard for the previous relationships (or even physical locations, or even aliveness) of the characters involved. American examples are possibly derived from the straightforward (over)use of this trope in Euro cinema. Bonus points if it uses Vera Lynn's "We'll Meet Again".

Frequently overlaps with Dance Party Ending. Probably related to Big-Lipped Alligator Moment and to Gainax Ending. Contrast with Dancing Is Serious Business. Not to be confused with Musicalis Interruptus, which is when a musical performance suddenly ends.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   Episode 46 of the first series of _Magical Princess Minky Momo_ ends with all the characters who had appeared in the show so far dancing and singing the show's theme song. It'd make more sense if it had been the actual finale.

    Film — Animation 

-   _Shrek_:
    -   _Shrek_ ends with all the characters singing "I'm a Believer".
    -   _Shrek 2_ ended with "Livin' La Vida Loca".
-   The Blue Sky Studios animated movie of _Horton Hears a Who!_ has all the characters break into "Can't Fight This Feeling" at the end. According to the DVD Commentary, this was because they wanted to avoid a Bittersweet Ending where Horton has to leave Whoville behind and never talk to the mayor again, and that's all they could think of.
-   At the end of _Open Season 2_, everyone begins to sing "Close To You" after the wild animals and pets settle their differences and become friends.
-   At the end of _Recess: School's Out_, the main six sing "Green Tambourine". Subverted as the credits have already started, but it's the only part of the film where the cast do a musical number.
-   _Toy Story 2_ ends with Wheezy the Penguin spontaneously bursting into song ("You've Got A Friend In Me" from the previous movie), with the Barbie dolls as backup singers/dancers and his normally high, raspy voice inexplicably replaced with a deep, rich one.

    Film — Live Action 

-   _Mr. Bean's Holiday_ ends with everyone on the beach, lip-syncing to the song "La Mer".
-   _Inland Empire_. A nice cherry on top of a film that is Mind Screw all through.
-   "Age of Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" at the end of _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_.
-   _There's Something About Mary_ ends with the entire cast singing along to "Build Me Up Buttercup", switching around to different locations used in the movie.
-   _Slumdog Millionaire_, as a nod to the film's Bollywood influence. Bollywood flicks are generally loaded with song and dance numbers.
-   The movie version of _Ella Enchanted_ ends with all the characters singing "Don't Go Breaking My Heart". Including the villain, who was supposed to be dead. Eric Idle as narrator provides the page quote.
-   _Bring It On_ ends with the cheerleaders lipsynching to "Hey Mickey". Clip.
-   _Casper_ ends with the entire cast breaking out into a Little Richard cover of "Casper the Friendly Ghost".
-   The final scene of _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ shows the main cast of the movie and half the population of Toontown parading out of the factory as "Smile, Darn Ya, Smile" plays in the background from out of nowhere. A less out-of-left-field example than most, since the song had been heard earlier and it had already been established that Toontown was a naturally song-filled place.
-   _Get Over It_ has the cast singing Earth, Wind & Fire's "September".
-   _Evan Almighty_ has the cast singing and dancing to "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" during the credits.
-   _Beetlejuice_ rather bizarrely ends with a crowd _dance_ scene to Harry Belafonte's "Jump in the Line". While the film is not really a musical _per se_, there _has_ been some plot-important singing before that. It's still kind of a non-sequitur.
-   _Gulliver's Travels (2010)_ features Jack Black singing "War".
    
    **Gulliver:** Why do war? What is it good for?
    
    **Horatio:** Absolutely naught!
    
-   _Bend It Like Beckham_ ends with a Bollywood version of "Hot Hot Hot".
-   _Mirror, Mirror_ ends with "I Believe (In Love)" being sung by Lily Collins.
-   _Damsels in Distress_ ends with the main characters dancing the Sambola, Violet's attempt at a dance craze.
-   _Scrooged_ ends with the cast singing "Put A Little Love In Your Heart".
-   _This Is the End_ ends with the majority of the cast singing and dancing along to "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" by Backstreet Boys in heaven.
-   _Hot Fuzz_ has an in-universe example in a play the main duo are made to attend. In a production of _Romeo and Juliet_ of all things. This trope, combined with the horrible performance, is a contributing factor in the lead actors' murder.
-   Federico Fellini's _8½_ ends with all the people from the protagonist's past coming together to dance around him on a circus stage, while he is the ringmaster in the middle.
-   _Save Your Legs!_ ends with a sudden Bollywood song and dance number.
-   _Jackass Number Two_ ends with the cast doing a rendition of "The Best of Times".
-   Jackie Chan's _Kung Fu Yoga_ ends with a sudden Bollywood-esque Chinese song with both heroes and antagonists dance together along with Indian people.
-   _White Noise (2022)_ ends with the entire cast performing an elaborate dance routine to "New Body Rhumba" by LCD Soundsystem.

    Live Action TV 

-   The season finale of the first television season of _Our Miss Brooks_ ("June Bride") ends with an impromptu square dance. Miss Brooks had been filling in as proxy for Mr. Leblanc's French bride. At the last minute the wedding is called off. Mr. Boynton uses the opportunity . . . not to propose marriage to Miss Brooks, but to call for a square dance. Mrs. Davis plays the square dance music on the organ, while Miss Brooks, Mr. Boynton, Mr. Conklin, Harriet Conklin, Walter Denton, Mr. Leblanc, the judge, and the telegraph delivery boy all join in.
    
    **Mr. Boynton**: Oh come on in and form a line, come on in the dancing's fine!
    
    **Miss Brooks**: Oh look at me, instead of being wed, I'm dancing with a fella with corners on his head!
    
-   The series finale of _Hart of Dixie_ ends up with the entire town of Bluebell performing a musical number in the town square.
-   _Skins_ series one ends on a performance of "Wild World" sung by Sid, Tony, Chris, Angie, a few guys in the toilet, and a bus driver.
    -   The American remake ends with Stanley leading a performance of "Shout" on stage at a club.
-   The hundredth episode of _How I Met Your Mother_ ends with an unexpected musical number about Barney and his suits.
-   An episode of _30 Rock_ featuring numerous references to Gladys Knight sees Kenneth deciding to go home to Georgia. By rail. Around 12ish. Most of the cast burst into song at the end of the episode... until Gladys Knight finally shows up, just to tell them to cut it out.
-   An early episode of _Kingdom Hospital_ ended with the medical staff breaking into a musical number, dancing in the OR, corpses in the morgue singing along. It comes completely out of nowhere, and yet for a series that runs on equal parts Surreal Horror and Black Comedy it somehow works.
-   _2point4 Children_:
    -   Every Christmas Episode of ends with the characters in a parody of a cheesy American Bing Crosby\-style Christmas Special, singing 1950s Christmas songs. In the first one, it was justified as an Imagine Spot into Bill's mother's fantasy Christmas. In subsequent years, though, it just happened.
    -   A more justified example in the episode "Frenzy", which almost ends with Jenny's school talent contest and Ben and David accompanying her singing "Everybody Needs Somebody to Love". Then they get home and discover the house is on fire.
-   Season 7A of _Mad Men_ ends with Bert Cooper singing "The Best Things in Life are Free", complete with secretarial backup dancers, completely out of nowhere. It's even more random considering Bert died earlier in the episode.
-   In an unusual example of this being played for Tear Jerker, the _Scrubs_ episode "My Philosophy" ends with a patient - who had previously said she liked to imagine death as a big Broadway number - coding. As JD watches, his Imagine Spot has her singing "Waiting for My Real Life to Begin" with some of the regulars. As the song ends, so does the Imagine Spot, and we fade back to the medical team realising they've lost her.
-   _The Colbert Report_ ended this way, with Stephen starting to sing Vera Lynn's "We'll Meet Again" before being joined by all the guests he's had over the years.
-   _A Series of Unfortunate Events (2017)_ ends its first season with the cast singing a somber tune emphasizing the downbeat nature of the story.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_ episode "The Thespian Catalyst" ends with Raj and Bernadette performing a Bollywood musical number, one of the many Imagine Spots Raj has during the episode.
-   Following Mildred's promotion in the final episode of _The Worst Witch_, it all ends with a Good-Times Montage as the cast sings One Direction's "One Thing".
-   _Donkey Hodie_ will sometimes end episodes with a musical number:
    -   "Treasure Nest" ends with the song "Quackity Quack, Quack On Back", sung by the Duck Family Songbook.
    -   "Swoop A Rino" ends with a reprise of "You've Got To Do It", sung by Donkey Hodie, Bob Dog and Duck Duck.
    -   "Cheesy Con" ends with a reprise of the last song from the Cheesy Con Sing-Along sung by Donkey and Panda.
    -   "A Donkey Hodie Halloween" ends with "Hey-O Halloween", sung by the entire cast.

    Radio 

-   _The Twelfth Night Show_, a BBC comedy special telling the story of _Twelfth Night_ via clips from different reimaginings "from the archives" (all fictional), ends with the big finale of the cheesy 80s musical _The Chick Wears Pants_; a cheesy 80s version of "The Rain it Raineth Every Day".

    Video Games 

-   _Battleblock Theater_ ends with a double dose of songs: First, a surprisingly heartfelt tribute to the now permanently vegetative Hatty, which is abruptly followed up with a song about the importance of buckling one's pants.
-   _Limbo of the Lost_ does this extremely narmfully.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies_ ends with the zombies deciding they don't want to eat your brain after all, they just want to make a music video.

    Web Original 

-   _Invention Pioneers of Note_ has this for the last season.
-   Channel Awesome does this frequently; for example, The Nostalgia Chick's review for _Les Misérables_ ends in a "One Day More" sing-along with lots of cameos. _Atop the Fourth Wall_ had two, a sing-along of his theme song at the end of the 200th episode, and one of The Killers after the massive crossover review of _Southland Tales_, evoking one of the most _understandable_ moments of that movie.
-   _JonTron_ sings "Firework" at the end of his Dino City video.
-   Parodied by _The Onion_ in their article New ‘Game Of Thrones’ Trailer Provides Sneak Peek At Show’s Climactic All-Cast Dance Number.
-   Played for laughs in _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_, where in the final episode of season 2, after Florence and Marik fail in their duel against Melvin, the two agree they can only do one thing before Melvin finishes them off: sing "Stand by Me".

    Western Animation 

-   _Super Why!_: "Hip, hip hooray! The Super Readers saved the day!"
-   Some episodes of _U.S. Acres_ ended this way such as "Banana Nose" which closed with a song whose moral was "Whatever the name, I'm still the same nice person!" or "Short Story" where Booker comes to terms with being short.
-   The Series Fauxnale to _Reboot_ ended this way, as the entire second half of the episode was a musical performed by actors summing up the entire season to the tune of "I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General", while the main characters all enjoyed the performance.
-   The last episode of _Freakazoid!_ had its story end, then everyone appeared for a curtain call and a teary rendition of "We'll Meet Again".
-   The Bugs Bunny cartoon _Fresh Hare_ ends with Bugs, ready to be executed by a Mountie firing squad, being told by Elmer that he can have a Last Request. Bugs sings "I wish I was in Dixie, hooray, hooray!", which results in everyone suddenly down South dressed as blackface minstrels singing "Camptown Races".
    
    **Bugs:** Fantastic, isn't it?
    
-   There are several episodes of _The Chocolix_ (including the first, "First Day of School") that end with the characters doing a happiness dance called the "Chocolele", despite there having been no musical numbers before.
