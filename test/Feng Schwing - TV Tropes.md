_"Most bachelors in this city are only interested in an apartment that comes fully loaded with every gadget and contraption man has invented to snare a woman."_

Bob's bachelor pad looks pretty decent, almost like a model home. Of course, that's just for when most people come over. If Bob has a date over, he's a cad, so his home is rigged with the latest mechanical ways to get a woman in the mood, from a luxurious bed with satin sheets that automatically folds out, to recessed mood lights, to romantic music, all at the flip of a switch.

Bob either hired a Gadgeteer Genius to set this up or is one himself, and has rigged up his house better than Bruce Wayne ever dreamed of doing. Yet, Bob isn't Q from the _James Bond_ stories, so his gadgets aren't spy tools, they're sex aids.

This is usually a comedy trope that's Played for Laughs, and would rarely happen in a straight drama.

The trope name is a Portmanteau of Feng Shui<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and "SCHWING", the sound Wayne and Garth make whenever they see an attractive woman and their spirits are uplifted.

Compare Lonely Bachelor Pad. A Shag Wagon is the vehicular version, and it may have the same push-button mood music and folding bed. A Sub-Trope of Super Multi-Purpose Room.

    Film

-   The Matt Helm films were a major contributor to the trope, right down to the revolving bed that can dump you into the pool for a bath. In one of the movie, _The Wrecking Crew_, the _female_ Gypsy Lola Medina has a room like this (including mood lighting) which she uses to try to seduce Mr. Helm.
-   Eric "Otter" Stratton in _Animal House_ has his room this way, which is humorous both for being the only non-messy place in the house and for being so obviously a "bachelor pad" of this type.
-   Dudley Moore's character in _Foul Play_.
-   In the 1966 film _The Swinger_, the lecherous head of "Girl-Lure" Magazine tries to seduce Ann-Margret's character with an office much like this.

As her superiors watch on closed-circuit tv, she goes to change, and he kicks back on the couch with a cigarette, which he promptly drops underneath him - as he flails around manically to retrieve it he hits a switch which opens the couch into a big comfy bed. His watchers admire his smooth technique.
-   Jason Robards uses a wall bed to seduce Britt Ekland in _The Night They Raided Minskys_. She's a virginal Mennonite girl who doesn't want to "do it" unless she gets "a sign from God," and the bed is rigged to lower as his Victrola plays "Hallelujah"...
-   _The Wolverine_: While on the run from the Yakuza, Mariko and Logan hide out in a Love Hotel. The only vacant rooms are "The Dungeon", "Nurse's Office" and "Mission to Mars."

    Literature 

-   Contrary to the preceding article, one of Q's assistants, Ann Reilly (aka "Q'ute") rigs up a similar room in a _James Bond_ continuation novel, _Licence Renewed_. James is confused and impressed all at the same time.
-   In the _Doctor Who_ Eighth Doctor Adventures novel _The Taint_, Fitz clearly _wishes_ his scuzzy little flat were like this. He just has a "sleazily red" lightbulb in his bedroom, which Sam (whom he's on a bit of a date with at the time) makes fun of him for. He says it's his "relaxation bulb" and swaps it out for a normal one.

     Live Action TV  

-   An odd variation of this appears in _The Twilight Zone (1959)_ episode "A Nice Place to Visit". Henry Valentine's suite acts this way (including music starting automatically), but it's just for mood, because the woman concerned didn't need to be seduced.
-   Ponch's waterfront apartment (a bit expensive for a highway patrolman) on _CHiPs_ is like a primer on how to be a stud in California.
    
    **Paul Mavis**: First, get a job as a Highway Patrolman (flash rig, sweet uniform, gun). Next, get an apartment down at the Marina. Next, get a waterbed (loosely filled for that "ocean motion" effect), restore a Trans Am that you picked up as a wreck (actually, get your partner Jon who has no life to fix it up for you), and then have your partner help you move your stuff in, including your Carpenters records (they're prominently on display, to let the chicks know Ponch is sensitive). Throw in some ferns and smoked glass, and watch the chicks roll in.
    
-   There's an episode of _NewsRadio_ where Matthew and Beth end up house-sitting for Bill, and his apartment is much like this, complete with mood music and rotating bed that activate once the lights are turned on. Matthew being... well, Matthew, he's quickly swept up into the "mystique" of the apartment and tries to put the mack on Beth. However, the episode ends with the reveal that it actually wasn't Bill's apartment, but his friend, Larry - who, according to Bill, is "one of the busiest male prostitutes in the biz."
-   In the French-Canadian television science-fiction/mystery/drama/suspense/horror (!) series L'Héritière de Grande Ourse, a character has a device for that purpose hidden in his sofa.
-   The late father's home in the pilot of the short-lived show _Jenny_.
-   Inverted by Barney's bachelor pad in _How I Met Your Mother_, which was designed to get women to leave in the morning, with everything from one pillow to a porn library to a toilet seat lid that automatically springs upward.
-   Surprisingly, showed up in the aggressively squeaky-clean (and even more aggressively obscure) Sitcom _Safe at Home._
-   Less outrageous, but the apartment Latke briefly rented on _Taxi_ had a lot of party-friendly furniture concealed in the walls.
-   A downplayed version in _Hunter_. when Hunter and Dee Dee McCall have to stay in a No-Tell Motel where There Is Only One Bed which has restraints and a coin-operated vibrating mattress. Dee Dee starts to crack up laughing when she hears Hunter drop a couple of coins in and the bed starts to vibrate.
-   A decor variant in _The Nanny_ episode "The Morning After", when Fran's cousin helps her redecorate the kitchen. Hoping to help things between Fran and Max progress, she uses suggestive imagery throughout, e.g. a clock with horns and an oyster wallpaper pattern. The result is utterly tasteless, though it does work on Niles and C.C..
-   Netflix's _How To Build A Sex Room_ is a reality TV show about this trope in _Real Life_.
-   _Deep Space Nine_. In "Our Man Bashir", Dr. Bashir is playing a holodeck program where he's a 1960's secret agent. He's surprised to find the bar in his expensive apartment rotates around to reveal a bed with a beautiful Russian spy reclined on it (and even more surprised to find it's his colleague Major Kira playing the part).

    Video Games 

-   In _Kingdom of Loathing_, the 300th floor of Fernswarthy's Basement features a seemingly-empty room that converts into a cheesy bachelor pad.
    
    The wall opposite you rotates 180 degrees, revealing a circular bed with leopard-print sheets. To your left, a portion of the wall slides up vertically to reveal a fully-stocked wet bar. Red and blue lights flash overhead as sexified, slow-jam R&B music slinks out of hidden speakers. Oh, man... you just learned way more about Fernswarthy than you ever, ever wanted to know.
    

     Web Original 

-   _The Onion_ has a recurring opinion/lifestyle columnist named Smoove B, who is a casanova straight out of an R&B song. Smoove's bachelor pad is mentioned in many columns, and is optimized for seduction. The place, which "has been photographed for many romance-enthusiast magazines", includes a fireplace with fur rugs, red silk wall hangings, a round bed with luxury sheets, and a hot tub.

     Western Animation  

-   _Family Guy_ spoofs this even more with Glen Quagmire's house. He seems to have Murphy beds built into every item in his house. _Everything_ pops out a bed when Cleveland is chasing him with a bat. Stereo, refrigerator, and...bed. His RV has a more...forceful version, where the buttons on the console clamp the girl down and force her mouth onto his private area. Stewie (and especially Brian) learn that the hard way when they steal it.
    -   A later episode shows that he has mechanisms that are voice activated to phrases inverse to how much someone wants to stay. Someone requesting to leave gets dropped through a trapdoor into a sex dungeon, while asking to stay can get you violently defenestrated by a robot arm.
-   Zapp Brannigan of _Futurama_ calls his the Lovenasium. He needs it because he suffers from a very sexy learning disability: "Sexlexia".

-   In _King of the Hill_, Hank Hill goes to get treatment from masseur John Redcorn. Unlike most of John Redcorn's female clients, he actually needs it. The room is set up to automatically activate make-out music and mood lighting, which can't be turned off, ever.
-   _Justice League_. Green Lantern is puzzled as to why Flash has turned a van into a Pimped-Out Car, until Flash opens the back and shows the cargo space has been converted into a cheesy bachelor pad. GL promptly turns down an invitation for them to go on a road trip together.
