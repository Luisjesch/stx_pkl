Now you see him...now you don't!

_"An iris in would be appropriate now, don't you think?"_ \[iris out on Eddy\] _"Thank you."_

A transition where the screen turns to solid black starting at the edges and pushing inwards, forcing the view of the scene into an ever-dwindling circle in the manner of a camera iris closing. The circle is centered either on the physical middle of the screen, or on some object or person of importance in order to draw attention to it. When the center of the "iris" is on a person, it sometimes pauses to allow them to get off a One-Liner or other comment. Some shows use the Iris Out instead of Fade Out for a character's POV when they pass out/faint/are knocked unconscious. Image overlays are occasionally added onto the iris to give it an effect.

The iris isn't required to be circular. If the episode ends on a romantic high note, it often takes the form of a Heart Symbol.

A common variation is for the iris to almost close, then pop back open a little either to continue the cartoon or for one last gag before the iris finally closes altogether. A common fourth-wall breaking variation on this variation is for a character to physically grab the closing iris, sometimes pushing it to prevent the scene from ending, other times stretching it open to rant or to step through into the blacked-out screen.

The effect originates from the early filming technique of shrinking the physical iris of the camera to film closing shots. At some point, this became so cliche that variations and parodies were inevitable.

-   Most episodes of _K-On!_ end with a Fade to Black or just a straight cut to black or credits, but a few episodes end _this_ way.
    -   In Season 1, Episode 5, the iris closes on Mio, who's just collapsed from learning that she has to fill in for Yui, who's ruined her voice for a few days from too much practice. Another iris opens on Yui, who tells us they have 3 days until the school festival...
    -   In Episode 6, a heart-shaped iris closes on Mio, who's traumatized from having accidentally given the audience a Panty Shot.

It comes into use again at the end of the festival, when Natsumi has to sit in it and apologize for messing everything up. The segment ends with an Iris Out for real, with Natsumi saying "I've had it with these cultural festivals".

    Asian Animation 

-   Every episode of _Canimals_ ends on one of these. The circle formed by the iris-out is sealed by a can lid suddenly appearing over it.

-   _The Artist_, a 2011 film but deliberately old-fashioned, uses this as well as several other tropes from the late-silent period of cinema.
-   The _Star Wars_ films use the Iris Out along with wipes for transitions instead of the standard dissolve. This is done as an Homage to the old film serials that influenced George Lucas.
-   This is done a lot in German silent films such as _The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_. Often, they would even start the iris out (or in) but stop partway through, so that only one part of the screen is visible and the rest is darkened. To some extent, this was a way of directing the audience's attention to a specific area of the screen that was superseded by the more mobile camera and faster editing style that became widespread by the later 1920s.
-   _Feast_ III ends on an improvised variation, with the surviving character of the film using his hands to imitate an iris out.

-   The logo of the independent Hollywood studio, Avco-Embassy Pictures Corporation (1968-1982), began with an iris-out zooming out.
-   Experimental Soviet film _Man with a Movie Camera_ plays with this, ending with a shot _of the camera lens_ as the iris closes.

-   _Wonderwall_ sometimes uses an iris out after one of Oscar's fantasies.
-   _Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_: Befitting of this film being the Grand Finale of the _Indiana Jones_ series, the last scene ends with an iris out on Indy's hat hanging on a clothesline. It pauses momentarily to show the hat being taken by Indy offscreen, quickly fading to black afterwards.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Canada's Worst Handyman_: The final episode of season 6 ends with one.
-   _Pushing Daisies_: An Iris Out is the usual Idiosyncratic Wipe used, where its old-fashioned feel complements the show's retro charm.
-   _Sesame Street_: Used in the end of the opening theme to the 24th to 29th season. At the end of the recent variation of the "Frazzle" song is where the iris permeates along with the rip wipe with Frazzle grumbling twice when shrinking with an ease-in animation, which then vanishes after the second growl.
-   _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_: The "Neighborhood of Make-Believe" segments are usually bookended by this, with the iris appearing on the trolly as it goes from the real world to the pretend one and back. This is one of Fred Rogers' ways of helping his young audience know the difference between reality and fantasy.

-   _Ugly Betty_ does this on occasion, with the iris focusing on Betty after she gets into certain situations.
-   In the UK, when the television signal used to cut off for the night, an iris out would close up into the centre of the screen, leaving just a little white dot which would then slowly fade.
-   _Supernatural_: "Scoobynatural", a crossover with _Scooby-Doo_, ends with an iris out like in a cartoon.
-   _Mako Mermaids: An H₂O Adventure_ only does this one time in "The Siren", which makes it seem really out of place. As Carly opens her laptop to show the others a video of a Canadian siren luring a canoer with song, Zac, Evie, Sirena, Ondina and Mimmi immediately shut it down with a Big "NO!" It irises out with a freeze frame of Carly’s face.

-   _Tipping the Velvet (2002)_: In the TV version, obviously. Usually on Nan, since she's the narrator. Each episode closes on the scene by doing this, in the last one with a heart shape after Nan finds true love with Flo.

    Music Videos 

-   Dire Straits' video for "Walk Of Life" ends with this.
-   During The Who's 2012/13 Quadrophenia And More tour, during "5:15", one of the video screens would show archival footage of John Entwistle taking a bass solo. And the end of the segment, as John salutes the audience, the video would Iris Out and go back to what was going on onstage.
-   In The Linda Lindas's video for "Talking to Myself" the band members are attacked by their dolls, which have come to life and are angry about being excluded from band practice. They leave the girls lying in a heap all bloody and bruised, and the scene closes in on one of the dolls. Just before the shot closes fully, the dolls's eye pops open. Creepy Doll indeed.
-   _Ren & Stimpy_'s music video for "Cat Hairballs" irises out on an unconscious Stimpy's butt, which had been stamped and branded with a "Grade A" mark of approval.
-   The music video for My Chemical Romance's "Welcome to the Black Parade" has a rather persistent one, which keeps on trying to end the video.

    Video Games 

-   Also used to transition between scenes in many video games; for example, _Super Mario 64_ and _Paper Mario 64_ did this using outlines of characters' heads rather than the traditional circle.
    -   When you entered a level in the original NES _Super Mario Bros. 3_, the transition was a box that always went into the center of the screen. The remakes used a circle that was always centered on Mario.
    -   _Super Mario World_ did this with a circle at the end of every stage, except those finished using a keyhole. Keyhole exits did an inversion of this trope using the keyhole itself as the iris.
    -   In _Super Mario RPG_, this happens each time you spend a night at an inn, stopping to let Mario strike his trademark pose before finishing.
    -   _Super Mario 64_, _Super Mario Galaxy_, and the _New Super Mario Bros._ games do this with the outline of Bowser's face whenever Mario loses a life. The _New Super Mario Bros_ games also have generic circle irises for pipe and door entries and Idiosyncratic Wipes for secret pipes hidden off screen. And, in _New Super Mario Bros. Wii_, if you enter a door in a hidden area, there's an additional iris-out for the passage.
    -   If you lose your last life in _Galaxy_, then instead of Bowser's face, the iris out will be shaped like the words "Game Over" instead.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies_: "There's a Zombie on Your Lawn", the music video that plays when the player defeats Dr. Zomboss, ends with an iris out on Sunflower, who winks at the viewer.
-   All _Kingdom Hearts_ games released after _Kingdom Hearts II_ used iris-outs between areas in a world. The outline is always some sort of symbol related to the world currently in - a keyhole in Twilight Town, a Mickey Mouse head in Disney Castle, a lightning bolt medal in the Olympus Coliseum, a rose in Beast Castle, and a standard Iris Out in Timeless River...
-   Used for all level transitions in _Donkey Kong 64_, with the iris in the shape of the initials "DK".
-   _Banjo-Kazooie_ and _Banjo-Tooie_ used these as screen transitions. If you got a Game Over or decided to quit playing, the iris would take the shape of a profile of Grunty's head.
-   Both _Dragon's Lair_ games and _Space Ace_ did this after each "miss" sequence. _Space Ace_ even does an "Iris In" with Borf taunting the player (except when the player got a game over, although the Borf taunting bits were still done before game overs in the blu-ray version). There are even heart-shaped irises that close out in Level 4 of _Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp_.
-   A heart-shaped version can be found in both endings of _Super Meat Boy_.
-   There's a mushroom-shaped iris out whenever Marisa collects a mushroom in _New Super Marisa Land_.
-   In _Killer Queen_, whenever a win is achieved the screen first freeze-frames, then irises and zooms in on the player scoring the winning point.
-   _River City Girls_: The flashback after getting the fake gold cat statue ends with a Heart Symbol iris out.
-   _Virgo Versus the Zodiac_ uses an iris out as the Fight Woosh from the overworld into battle encounters.

    Webcomics 

-   _Love Unlimited (2022)_: In the _Ms. Marvel & Red Dagger_ arc, supervillain Curio shocks Ms. Marvel into unconsciousness and the story switches to her point of view, with oval panels shrinking as it all fades to black.

    Web Original 

-   _Super Mario Bros. Z_ uses iris-outs that are somewhat merged with Idiosyncratic Wipes:
    -   In Episode 7, after the Dancing Banana inexplicably causes an explosion in the Pipe Maze that sends Wario and Waluigi back out to the surface, they land on Jeff and Hal from Bowser's Kingdom, and a banana graphic does this trope to _Super Mario World 1_'s "iris-out" sound effect.
    -   Then, in Episode 8, Wario throws Waluigi at the Sky Pop Mark II in an attempt to steal Mario and the gang's Chaos Emeralds. Waluigi stops just short and does a Wile E. Coyote-esque fall. After he lands, we cut to a stunned-nearly-speechless Wario, and the same thing happens as in the Episode 7 scene, but with a "W" emblem.
-   In the original Jib Jab video "This Land", George W. Bush grabs the iris at the end to mention Cheney.
-   _Happy Tree Friends_ does this at the end of almost every episode, with a few exceptions here and there. A common gag is for the iris to close on a character's body part, thus snapping it off.

    Web Video 

-   _Economy Watch_: In the 2022 Halloween special "Cryptic Cryptos", the iris wipe is used to transition from the opening credits to the first scene, done to pay homage to old film serials.

    Western Animation 

-   The first episode of _Bounty Hamster_ ends with Cassie and Marion being Chased Off into the Sunset by an angry mob, followed by this trope. Marion then pops up to reassure the audience that they managed to give their pursuers the slip, only to hear one of the mob shouting: "There he is! In front of the hole that gets smaller!" and he flees in a hail of bullets.
-   Most _101 Dalmatians: The Series_ episodes end this way, usually with the standard circle. "Love 'em and Flea 'em" uses a heart, as do "Swine Song" and "My Fair Moochie", while some use a star, like "Shake, Rattle, and Woof" and "Lucky All-Star". On a few occasions, the iris out is parodied by characters trying to keep the iris out open while trying to say something and other stuff.
-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_ almost always uses Iris Outs in the shape of whatever symbol Jimmy uses to identify everything he invents.
-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_ does this in in "The Castle", when Gumball and Darwin celebrate not having to go to school, despite being only a minute into the episode and the show normally ending with a Smash to Black.
-   _Animaniacs_:
    -   The "Please Please Please Get a Life Foundation" segment ends with an iris-out on a Fanboy's nose, but he reopens it, saying that It's Been Done before closing again.
    -   Called by name in the Willie Slakmer short "Karaoke-Dokie":
        
        **Yakko, Wakko and Dot:** Iris Out already, please?
        
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_ had a _heart-shaped_ Iris out in "Harlequinade". The only example of one in the entire DC Animated Universe.
-   An episode of _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_ ends with Batman standing behind Plastic Man and Woozy Winks as they laugh at the way the case ends. The iris stops and re-opens, as Plas and Woozy stop laughing, pause and resume and Batman simply walks out of the shot.
-   _Beast Wars_: "A Better Mousetrap" starts to iris out at the end as the Maximals sadly contemplate Rattrap's Heroic Sacrifice...then the iris reverses as Rattrap comes out of the ship, perfectly fine, and the episode continues for another minute.
-   This isn't standard for the 2003 animated _The Berenstain Bears_ series, but it's used at the end of "The Hiccup Cure" after Papa Bear hiccups at the Squire's party but then says that he's just kidding. It's also used with Kenny in "Big Road Race" as the race ends.
-   This is the standard episode closing for _Blaze and the Monster Machines_, usually centered on Crusher whenever he gets the episode's last laugh. A certain number of episodes fade to black instead.
-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_: In "The Chicken From Outer Space", when Courage remarks, "This shouldn't happen to a dog!" It has since become a well-known gag on the series.
-   In an episode of _Darkwing Duck_ where the characters get involved in a movie production, everyone starts to argue about how to end the movie. The Diva wants it to end on her face, and another suggests a ride into the sunset, and and Launchpad starts to describe the iris out as the perfect way to end it. Guess which one they chose.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ does this at the end of "Here's Mud in Your Ed", when Edd says while Breaking the Fourth Wall, "An iris in \[on Eddy\] would be appropriate." After that happens and the screen is completely black, he says, "Thank you!"
-   _FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman_, The 30-second animated stingers usually end this way.
-   All episodes of _Fudêncio e Seus Amigos_ end with this. Since one of the main characters has a round head and most episodes end with him being arrested and complaining to the audience about it, this often happens around his head.
-   _Garfield and Friends_: At the end of "The Horror Hostess (Part 1)", Garfield worries about the trouble Jon is in and realizes it's the end of the episode. He fruitlessly tries to keep the iris from closing, muttering, "I hope this is a two-parter."
-   At the end of _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ episode "Hog Wild", Billy gets caught in the iris, which horrifically contorts his face until he slips through it so it can close.
-   Used frequently (but not all the time) on _Jimmy Two-Shoes_.
-   The same goes for almost all episodes of _Johnny Test_.
-   On the animated version of _Little Princess_, this is the standard ending for all episodes, generally holding to show what it's focused in on for about two seconds before going to black entirely and going to the credits. "I Want to be a Detective" from the third season is an exception to the rule. It instead ends with a flash photo capture of the final scene, showing Princess, Puss and Scruff all leaping for a biscuit (cookie).
-   On _Llama Llama_, this is actually not the standard method of closing the show, but is nevertheless used at the end of "Lucky Pajamas," zooming on Mama Llama's face.
-   The best-known examples of this can be seen in various Warner Bros. cartoons. which were already subverting the trope in the 1930s. One famous example is in many of Bob Clampett's cartoons, in which he created a "Beeo-woop!" sound effect to accompany the iris out at the end.
    -   "The Wearing of the Grin" ends with an iris out shaped like a shamrock.
    -   In "All This and Rabbit Stew", the camera begins to iris-out on the Stepin Fetchit parody after being reduced to wearing nothing but a leaf over his crotch thanks to Bugs beating him in a game of craps. Bugs then jumps into the iris right before it closes and jumps out holding the leaf.
    -   In _Duck Amuck_, Daffy Duck pushes the closing iris aside, since in his mind, the cartoon hasn't started yet.
-   Usually used for _Lou and Lou: Safety Patrol_, with the iris being shaped like the badge of the Safety Patrol.
-   _Lupo the Butcher_: Subverted when Lupo's severed head squeezes its way through the iris and continues to scream obscenities and insults during the credits.
-   _Making Fiends_: At the end of the TurboNick promo "No. 2 Pencil", Marvin calls out on Charlotte by saying that she's got his pencil, to which an iris centers around Charlotte's now-stunned face... who simply says "Teehee!" followed by the iris closing completely.
-   Fairly common in _The Mask_, including the "one last joke before closing" (one time, it was fading with the baby putting on the mask, and then the circle returned to show the masked baby grumbling again). One time the Mask tried to weaponize it to finish the fight\\episode sooner, but his enemy caught on and pulled the closing circle out.
-   _Max and Ruby_ plays it straight to end each episode.
-   _Mickey Mouse Clubhouse_: One that's shaped like Mickey's head closes on Mickey after he bids farewell to the viewers at the end of every episode.
-   One _Mighty Mouse_ episode with Pearl Pureheart and Oil Can Harry apparently ends on a cliffhanger and an iris out. The narrator calls out "WAIT!", causing the iris out to suddenly stop on a frozen image of Mighty Mouse in flight. The narrator pleads, "Gosh, we can't wait till next week. _Please_ show us what happens now, won't you?" The iris opens back up and the show resumes as normal.
-   Almost every _Mixels_ ends with one of these. A couple of shorts leave it out, and two of the half-hour specials have them at the end of their first acts but not at the very end.
-   Frequently used on _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   Notably, at the end of the Season 2 Premiere, as a Shout-Out to _A New Hope_.
    -   Pinkie Pie also has a fight with the Iris Out at one point, and another at the end of "Magic Duel", where she reminds Twilight to restore her deleted mouth.
    -   "Secret of My Excess" has an Iris Out in the shape of lips closing in on the lipstick mark on Spike's cheek.
-   Frederator and Billionfold toons on Nickelodeon have some trademark ones:
    -   _Danny Phantom_ uses this with some variations. In one of the earlier episodes, the final shot is Danny, Sam and Tucker laughing with three iris outs on each of them. If the episode ends on a scene where only Danny and Sam are present, expect the iris to be heart-shaped.
    -   _The Fairly OddParents!_ has also used this with one for Timmy, Cosmo and Wanda all laughing.
    -   A really Idiosyncratic Wipes example in _Fanboy and Chum Chum_ — instead of a closing iris, it's in the shape of teeth snapping shut.
-   Almost all of the episodes of _Paper Port_ end this way.
-   The _Phineas and Ferb_ episodes "The Fast and the Phineas" and "Crack That Whip" end with this.
-   The _Ready Jet Go!_ episode "Sean Has a Cold" ends with this.
-   _Recess_ will use this as an ending on some occasions in place of a Fade Out.
-   _Rocko's Modern Life_ uses these at the end of most episodes.
-   _Rolie Polie Olie_ ends every scene with this. The iris is sometimes shaped like a square, in reference to Billy and his family.
-   _Rosie's Rules_: "Cat Mail" ends with a heart iris.
-   This is also sometimes used on _Sergeant Stripes_.
-   Most episodes of _Shelldon_ end with this, followed by a Doctor Shell segment recapping the events of the episode or teaching about real-life sea creatures. This segment ends with a regular brief fade to black before the credits.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: The only three episodes before season 9 that used to end with an iris out were "Wishing You Well", "Rodeo Daze" and "Trenchbillies". Now since season 9B started, this effect is now prominently used, and since season 11, it's become the general closing along with an accompanying sound effect.
-   _Steven Universe_ uses a star-shaped Iris Out, although episodes with particularly shocking, serious or sad endings use a Smash to Black instead.
    -   Several episodes play with this trope, such as "Giant Woman" (the episode focusing on the Fusion Dance between Amethyst and Pearl): the iris out starts to close in but suddenly goes back when Steven finds out he can fuse as well. Cue Smash to Black.
    -   Gradually, the star iris out became less common, even for endings where it would be tonally appropriate, to the point where the final season used it only for a quarter of the episodes, none of which were in the season's latter half.
    -   _Steven Universe: Future_ only even used it once for a Fake-Out Fade-Out.
-   _Superjail!_: Done in the very first episode after the Warden's plan works out and he gets to eat the remains of a prison riot. He comments that his "plan tastes great! I mean, it could use a little salt, but otherwise it tastes great!" As the iris closes in, it stops for a moment just long enough for him to wink at the audience.
    -   Done again in the season 3 episode "Sticky Discharge", where the Warden's plan to keep Paul in Superjail works, prompting the Warden to say "Isn't it great?" Cue iris out, stopping yet again for the Warden to wink at the audience.
-   _The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!_ episode "The Bird! The Bird!" uses a strange variation. After the final line is delivered, the iris appears already partially zoomed in, and both the iris and image it frames shrink into nothingness shortly afterwards.
-   _El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera_ enjoys this a lot:
    -   "A Fistful of Nickels" ends with White Pantera and Puma Loco arguing over whether Manny will grow up to be a hero or a villain. The iris closes on Pantera shouting "Hero!" but it opens back up again on Puma Loco shouting "Villain!" before it closes for good.
    -   In "Oso Solo Mio", the iris-out begins with a heart shape as El Oso begins walking away with his love, birds singing around them. But then the iris opens back up as the she-bear he loves runs away from him and we realize the show still has a couple of minutes left.
-   _Tom and Jerry_ (pictured above): Almost all of the shorts end with this, save for select shorts where it instead fades to black.
-   _Total Drama_: In the exclusive clip for "Zeek and Ye Shall Find", Ezekiel digs his way into the Fun Zone and befriends the mutants with a luxurious cake. After all he's been put through since _World Tour_, Zeke now has a place where he's at peace. In the clips final seconds, the screen goes black except for a heart-shaped cut-out around Zeke's broadly smiling face. After a pause, the heart shrinks to leave a full black screen.
-   This is the standard ending for _Wild Animal Baby Explorers_, usually zooming in a character's face before going to the credits.
-   This is the usual closing for _My Friends Tigger & Pooh_, though Tigger will sometimes play around with it. Also, in "How to Say I Love Roo," the iris is in the shape of a heart, closing in on Kanga and Roo hugging.
-   A Walter Lantz short from the _Woody Woodpecker_ family ended with the shrinking iris _decapitating_ the character, but it was Played for Laughs.
-   _Work It Out Wombats!_:
    -   "Game Changer" ends with an iris out on Malik and his muddy umbrella.
    -   "Helper For the Day" closes with an iris out on Zeke's face.
