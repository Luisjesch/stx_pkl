You're minding your own business, when all of a sudden you are attacked by a group of bandits, or perhaps soldiers of an opposing country. You are battered, bruised and cut to the point where there is next to no hope for you to survive. The wounds have been cut deep, you feel yourself inching closer and closer towards the afterlife. Your vision blurs and everything goes black. Suddenly a stranger happens by (generally a female) and discovers that you still have a pulse. So, being the Good Samaritan they are, they bring you back to their own personal cabin and begin nursing you back to health.

You awake, distraught and confused at your new surroundings, when your savior walks in pleasantly surprised that you are awake and asks how you are feeling and will explain what they were doing before happening across your limp body, essentially saying: "I found you like this." If your caretaker is not a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, they will help you get back on your feet and in working order. If they are, they will grumpily save your life and then tell you to leave whenever possible. If the caretaker doesn't come in right away after you wake up, this gives you an opportunity to look around the room and take note of anything interesting or unusual about the place. This is generally the first time you meet this character, making this a Subtrope of Rescue Introduction.

The circumstance in which the character is injured does not always have to be related directly to a battle. Anything that causes enough physical or (in some cases both) mental damage to put the character in serious danger without medical help can qualify. If the character however collapses from harsh environmental conditions alone and is found by some friendly wandering natives, their situation might be more related to the Bedouin Rescue Service.

Waking from a wound-induced sleep can spark a romance between the wounded and the caretaker, and it can cause you to Level Drain or forget everything about yourself. Or all three at once.
