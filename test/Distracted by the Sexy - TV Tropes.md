_"Boobs are near the center of the universe, until you turn twenty-five or so. Which is also when young men's auto insurance rates go down. This is not a coincidence."_

For some men, it's very easy to forget what they are doing when a sexy body strolls past and lose control, doing things like walking into walls, tripping over themselves, dropping fragile objects, causing a Human Traffic Jam, etc. Mostly a comedy trope.

If this is induced intentionally by the seducer in question when We Need a Distraction, it falls instead into Show Some Leg.

Compare Chic and Awe, Sex Sells, Sexy Coat Flashing, and Show Some Leg. Contrast, naturally, Not Distracted by the Sexy, Ignore the Fanservice, and The Power of Lust (which is when the sexy inspires rather than distracts). This may occur after a Crash Through the Harem.

If the viewers are the ones Distracted By The Sexy, that's Best Known for the Fanservice. If the distracted party finds himself lost in thought over the distraction, it becomes Eating the Eye Candy. If distracted by someone that their orientation wouldn't generally be attracted to, that's Stupid Sexy Flanders. If communication is attempted, it can cause Gibberish of Love. Expect Favors for the Sexy by the distracted. If a character distracts themselves by noticing their reflection in a mirror, that's Distracted by My Own Sexy. See Cuteness Proximity for the non-sexy, non-human variant. Compare also with Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful!

The Seducer or Seductress are (usually) young, attractive characters that employ this trope.

    Advertising 

-   A Dutch insurance company, known for their slogan "Even Apeldoorn bellen" ("Time to call Apeldoorn", the name of the city where they have their main office) has a number of rather clever TV ads. In one, two roadworkers are digging a rather large hole (the road is at chest level); one of them is wielding a pickaxe. Then a stunning pair of legs walks by (that's roughly what you see, due to the camera crop), the guys look at them approvingly, the pickaxe swings down once more, a metallic "clunk" is heard and a jet of water spouts up. Slogan text blends in.

-   A 1984 ad for Maaco (auto painting and repair chain) has a Too Dumb to Live guy staring at several women walking by and ends up driving his car right inside a moving van. Uh, oh. Better get Maaco, indeed.
-   Subverted in a 2000 ad for Kronenbourg 1664 beer. It starts out with one awe-struck construction worker obliviously swinging a pickaxe while gazing at a woman, while another equally oblivious worker climbs out of a manhole in front of him. Cue a quick camera change and a sickening squish noise. It goes on like this for forty seconds, with butchers slicing off fingers, men getting hit by busses, and utility workers getting electrocuted. They're not into the woman herself, but her beer.
-   _Air New Zealand Safety Videos_: The guys demonstrating the brace positions in a canoe in "Safety in Paradise" keep sneaking glances at the model in the bikini on the beach.
-   The first commercial for the Sega Dreamcast in America ended with Sonic the Hedgehog losing his balance from the on-light of the Dreamcast and falling, ready to be caught by a football player, only for Sarah to walk by, distracting the player and causing Sonic to faceplant on the ground, losing rings in the process.
-   Ads for the Australian pantyhose makers Razza Matazz had a gorgeous woman (wearing the brand being advertised) going about her business when her skirt blows up in the wind - and total chaos and hilarity ensues among the innocent men going about their business around her.
-   A cellphone commercial from The '90s featured a rollerblader navigating a city. (We see this from his perspective.) About halfway through, he spots a sexy lady and keeps looking at her as he passes. He looks back at his path and sees the truck he's about to crash into. He then uses his cellphone to call his doctor and say "I did it again."
-   An car insurance ad for Allstate has a young man driving a car see a "hot babe out jogging" and run his car into a light pole. The big joke being that as with all the ads in this particular campaign, the "hot babe out jogging" is Dean Winters, this time adding a pink headband and barbells to his rumpled suit as the character "Mayhem".
    -   Similarly, a radio ad for the Chicago market has a motorist on Lake Shore Drive paying too much attention to a beach volleyball player and rear-ending another car.
-   In a DKNY commercial where Emily Ratajakowski goes out walking a dog only dressed in her underwear this is the result. Especially when a driver loses control as there's a closeup on her dog... and the car hits another car. Everybody Lives. (Including the dog.)
-   A _very_ darkly humorous version of this (both played straight and with a gender inversion) occurs in this German ad for the fashion store NewYorker. The ad shows an attractive young woman in a minidress strolling in the city, passing several people: a skateboarder, a tattooist making tattoos for some gang members, and some firemen helping someone escape a burning building. All of them are distracted by her looks, which ends up spelling disaster (which she ignores every time): the skateboarder rolls out onto the street and is hit by a car, the tattooist accidentally tattoos a heart on a gang member's back and is shot by the other gang members, and the firemen misplace their safety net, causing the guy in the burning building to fall on the ground. She then passes by another man, whom she flirts with, but then she accidentally walks backwards right into a pit in the sidewalk, which is then filled in by rocks immediately afterwards. The ad ends on a shot of a small piece of her dress partially buried in the sidewalk while someone uses a jackhammer nearby.

    Animation 

-   _Happy Heroes_: In episode 2 of Season 2, Careful S. distracts a couple of guards by throwing magazines their way. The magazines' covers depict beautiful women which distract the guards.
-   _Motu Patlu_: In "Angry Clouds", several townspeople notice and get distracted by Motu while he is Disguised in Drag.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: In _Great War in the Bizarre World_ episode 5, the goats have Jollie dress up like a female bee in order to distract the bee guards at the palace and get into the building. The intended reaction is given by the bees... until Jollie turns around, revealing he looks rather ugly as a girl and causing the bees to faint in disgust.

    Comedy 

-   Bill Engvall discusses looking at colleges with his daughter:
    
    **Bill Engvall:** I'll tell you, it's a real slap in the face when you walk onto a college campus with your daughter and you catch some guy checking her out. _(murmurs of agreement)_ Yeah. Then I realized it _was_ a slap in the face; my wife caught me checking out college chicks. _(laughter)_ "Sorry, I'm a guy."
    

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Li'l Abner_, "Stupefyin' Jones" stunned any male who gazed upon her, except if they were wearing special glasses. In the stage and movie adaptation, she was played by Julie Newmar in a skimpy skintight body suit.

    Jokes 

-   A man is walking with his wife when he sees a young woman in a short skirt getting into a bus and keeps looking. His wife tells him acidly "I suppose you think I didn't catch you staring at the girl getting in the bus?" "What bus?"

    Magazines 

-   Taken to Self-Demonstrating Article levels by the cover of the June 2007 issue of _Latina Magazine_ (covergirl: Eva Longoria) in re an article about Enrique Iglesias:
-   A MAD Magazine cover parodying Sherlock Holmes, named inside as Shermlock Shomes, shows the famous detective and Dr. Whatsit starting after a hairy gentleman with a knife in his back, a bone, and a guy in his pocket, later implied to be "Arty Morty", but seeing an "interesting turn" in the case and instead following a woman with a conspicuous figure who, outlined against the lights, constitutes "a much more suspicious character to follow!"

    Manhua 

-   _Old Master Q_ has a strip where an art gallery displays the picture of a nude woman right _next_ to a pillar. Half of the male patrons in said gallery, including the titular character, ends up getting distracted by the picture and running into the pillar, and the clinic next to said gallery had a field day.

    Music 

-   "What Was I Thinkin'" by Dierks Bentley:
    
    I was thinkin 'bout a little white tank top  
    Sittin' right there in the middle by me  
    I was thinkin' bout a long kiss  
    Man just gotta get goin'  
    Where the night might lead  
    I know what I was feelin'  
    But what was I thinkin'
    
-   "Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On" by Mel McDaniel is a good example of this.
    
    _She can't help it if she's made that way  
    She's not to blame if they look her way  
    She ain't really tryin' to cause a scene  
    It just comes naturally  
    Lord, the girl can't help it_
    
-   "Bettina, zieh dir bitte etwas an" (Bettina, put some clothes on) by _Fettes Brot_ has the chorus "Bettina, wrap up your boobs". The song was inspired by the outfit of the host in a late night, call-in TV game show.
-   The singer of "Man on a Mission" in _!HERO: The Rock Opera_ ends the song with "Who's that beautiful girl?", segueing into "Secrets of the Heart".
-   "Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress)" by The Hollies. An FBI agent is about to signal a raid on a Bad Guy Bar but the eponymous woman catches his eye:
    
    _With just one look I was a bad mess  
    cause that long cool woman had it all_
    
-   "Bigger Than the Beatles" by Joe Joe Diffie has a mutual example of this. A waitress in a bar and a musician who performs in the bar are very much in love. Sometimes she forgets an order because she's thinking about how handsome he is, and sometimes he forgets to sing a chorus because he's thinking about how beautiful _she_ is.
-   Bruce Springsteen:
    -   "Crush on You": the narrator is _constantly_ getting distracted by beautiful girls to the point of wanting to drop everything and just run after them.
    -   Also these lines from "Loose Change":
        
        _Yeah, I knew she was trouble but trouble sure was lookin' fine  
        When I pulled her close what I knew kinda slipped my mind_
        
-   "I Don't Want This Night to End" by Luke Bryan:
    
    You got your hands up  
    You're rocking in my truck  
    You got the radio on  
    You're singing every song  
    I'm set on cruise control  
    I'm slowing losing hold of everything I got  
    You're looking so damn hot  
    And I don't know what road we're on  
    Or where we've been from starin' at you  
    Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end
    
-   "Younger Men" by K.T. Oslin:
    
    _That's why younger men are starting to catch my eye  
    I'm strating to stop what I'm doing  
    Just to turn around and watch them walk by_  
    \[...\]  
    Woah, look over here  
    We got a cute little ol' runner on the right  
    Blue shorts, no shirt  
    Whoo, you're looking good, darling  
    That's right, stay in shape''
    
-   In Del Reeves' "Girl on the Billboard", the singer notes how the titular billboard featuring a girl in just a Modesty Towel has caused crashes on Route 66.
-   In "Parents Just Don't Understand" by DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, Fresh Prince's night is going well until his companion unbuttons her shirt. Due to this, he fails to notice a police car and gets pulled over for speeding. This leads to an arrest and no doubt severe punishment from his parents.
    -   In "Just One Of Those Days", Prince, in a desperate attempt to get to work on time, steals a child's bike and rides away on it, catching the attention of a squad of _twelve cop cars_. Just as he's about to shake them off, he gets distracted by a pretty girl who walks by and promptly wipes out inside a construction zone.
-   In the Four Preps' "The Girl Without a Top" a naval captain runs his submarine into a pier when he spots her through his periscope.
-   Inverted in Whitney Avalon's song "Let's Not Talk About That", where Whitney is distracted _from_ the sexy dancing by Jordan Maron's insistence on talking about politics.
-   "Bobbie Ann Mason" by Rick Trevino mentions the title character as being a sexy distraction in school:
    
    It wasn't the books that I didn't read  
    It wasn't the teachers who tried to teach me  
    It wasn't that varsity baseball coach  
    Who kept on telling them locker room jokes  
    It was Bobbie Ann Mason, back in high school  
    She was way too cute, she was way too cool  
    How was I gonna get an education  
    Sittin' right in back of Bobbie Ann Mason
    

    Music Videos 

-   Eric Schwartz's "Kosha Boy", a parody of "Soulja Boy", has the Kosha Boy "try to set an example", but he gets distracted by "the girl \[he wants\] to schtup in the third row."
-   Weezer's video for "If You're Wondering If I Want You To" has this happen to two people: one standing in the street watching said girl, and the other driving a pickup truck, which hits the one standing in the street.
-   Trace Adkins' "Honky Tonk Badonkadonk" is a video about this trope in action - the hottest girl on the dance floor is so hot the guys can't stop staring at her.
-   MC Hammer's "U Can't Touch This" features a scene where Hammer suddenly stops dancing to admire the backside of the girl dancing in front of him.
-   In Chris Cornell's "Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart," set in Western times on the day he and Eric Roberts are among prisoners due to be hanged, an onlooker played by Elena "Ms. Fanservice roles a specialty" Satine uses this tactic as part of a plan to save Chris. At the end it's implied that she's going to do it again for Eric. P.S. It does work the first time.
-   Happens to a prison guard dog in Blake Shelton's "Old Red." Old Red has the best nose in the county and never lets a prisoner escape.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Avoiding this is apparently the reasons certain sects of certain religions insist on their women dressing in a conservative manner. Even religious sects that don't require modesty for women's day-to-day lives will still ask that they cover their shoulders and legs when attending services.
-   Classical Mythology:
    -   If Actaeon had been thinking with the right head at the time, he probably would have realized it was not a good idea to stand around watching the adamantly virginal Artemis bathe. And he might have survived.
    -   Fittingly enough this happens between goddess of love and fanservice, herself, Aphrodite and Adonis. Obsessed with him since he was a baby and unintentionally starts a Love Triangle with Persephone as the Veronica as soon as he's grown up, she's so obsessed with him that she's not doing her job of helping OTHER people fall in love/lust to instead (awkwardly) join him on hunts and stick with him 24/7.
-   The Trojan War:
    -   At one point in _The Iliad_, Hera goes to enormous lengths to seduce Zeus long enough for his pro-Trojan battle manipulations to fall apart.
    -   Said to have saved Helen's life. After the Achaeans have breached Troy's walls and are sacking the city, her first husband Menelaus is furious at her as can be expected and is portrayed in various accounts as ordering his troops to execute her or even about to kill her himself before her beauty stays their/his hands (helped by some accounts saying her clothes were getting torn off in all of the drama).
-   A story in both Jewish folklore and The Qur'an: after the other Egyptian women mock her for making a fool of herself over Joseph, Potiphar's wife invites them over, then calls him in while they're cutting fruit. Multiple injuries ensue.

    Podcasts 

-   Happens several times in ''The Fallen Gods’’.
    -   When Tuatha fails several perception and intuition checks when the group is trying to procure a ship, it's chalked up to her being distracted by the hot fake ship's captain. She's also willing to employ this herself if it means she can avoid an actual fight.
    -   There's also Mistress Mara the merchant, who causes this in everybody. Solvin has to step outside because it's so awkward he's about to crawl out of his skin.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   _The Great American Bash 2007_ had a backstage skit where Matt Hardy started lecturing Jeff Hardy that he had to stay focused to win his upcoming match. Candice Michelle, who just had a match, started pouring water all over herself to cool off, leaving Matt, Jeff, and then Ron Simmons gawking. Jeff later lost his match.
-   During a Full Impact Pro Falls Count Anywhere match CM Punk tossed Homicide onto a table where a strip show was happening and, without missing a beat, Homicide rolled onto his elbows to enjoy it. Punk stomped onto the table, stomped on Homicide's head and then noticed the strippers, though his reaction was more so appalled by the sexy.
-   At the 2015 _FIP Heatstroke_ Earl Kooter was more interested in making out with Veronica Voxx than watching his Trailer Park Nation partner Zane Riley wrestle. Riley ended up getting pinned by Gary Jay when he ended up paying too much attention to Kooter and Voxx make out.
-   The whole feud between George "The Animal" Steele and Randy "Macho Man" Savage in 1986-1987 WWE was centered around Steele's attraction to Miss Elizabeth, though, unlike the more overtly sexy WWE Divas who would follow, she didn't actually _do_ anything to provoke this reaction. She was just _there_.
-   Happened once to Vladimir Kozlov in a backstage segment on _WWE SmackDown_. But then, it _was_ Beth Phoenix, courtesy of being kissed by her Under the Mistletoe.
-   Happens to a photographer in this picture from Allysin Kay's Instagram. She wasn't above trying if it would help Chest Flexor in Absolute Intense Wrestling either, though the Midwest Militia usually took a more direct and violent approach to Flexor Industries' problems.
-   Mr. America lost an arm-wrestling match to Vince McMahon after Sable flashed him.
-   This was Debra's schtick during her WWF run as a valet for Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart. She accompanied them to the ring wore business suits. At a critical point in the match, she would get up on the apron and unleash the "puppies", as Jerry Lawler called it - that is, unbutton her blazer to reveal the skimpy bra underneath. Usually she used it to distract the opponent, but if that didn't work she could almost always find some way to use the puppies to cause a distraction.

    Roleplay 

-   The "Hallucination" psi-power from _A Shock to the System_ involves "Cramming an image of a pretty fem performing an act of depravity up \[an enemy's\] temporal lobe".

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition_:
    -   The 3.0 non-official book _Nymphology_ introduces new rules for lewd situations. For example, a Concentration check can be required for a spellcaster facing a naked and attractive opponent, in order to not flub a spell. Although modified by the foe's Charisma, the check is rather easy (since most spellcasters max out their Concentration skill), so only a complete novice is really at risk of being distracted.
    -   In the 3.5 supplement _Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss_, one of the Abyssal Heritor feats is "Otherworldly Countenance", which allows to choose between wretchedly hideous or stunningly beautiful. If beautiful, the character can cause a fascination effect a set number of times per day by focusing attention on a subject. Note that no mention is made of the subject needing to be of the opposite sex (or even the same species, in fact).
-   In the _Mutants & Masterminds_ supplement about Japanese media _Mecha & Manga_, there's a feat called "Distracting Looks" that allows your character to provoke this reaction to reduce targets' effectiveness with social skills.
-   In _Pathfinder_, the emypreal lord Arshea uses zir Charisma modifier as zir armor. Ze offers this to zir followers who preform obediences. The ability requires the user to wear revealing clothing and no armor.
-   _Reign_ has the "Beauty" advantage, which is prime for this use. At lower ranks you merely turn heads, while at the highest rank comparisons are made to Helen of Troy. And that's before you _intentionally_ use it to jack your Fascinate skill through the roof.
-   _Shadowrun_: the 4th Edition supplement _Attitude_ notes that female Urban Brawl champion Svetlana Jurjewa is known for her tactic of opening her top and flashing her breasts at members of the other team in order to distract them while one of her teammates makes a play. It's technically against the rules but so popular with viewers that she (and other female players who started copying her) are allowed to do it anyway.
-   _A Touch of Evil_: The Succubus minion gets an extra Fight Die against male Heroes.
-   The "Sexualized" merit in _Vampire: The Requiem_ lets characters use this to their advantage, at the cost of dealing with the fallout from the occasional Stupid Sexy Flanders moments they inflict on people around them.
-   The Dark Elf Sorceress Morathi in _Warhammer Fantasy_ is so beautiful and seductive that entire units must make a morale check to avoid distracted by her mere presence in combats she is involved in.

    Theatre 

-   As the Man in Chair tells us, the actress in the 1920s musical _The Drowsy Chaperone_ was famous for playing "The Oops Girl", who had this as her entire shtick.
-   In _The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee_, Chip Tolentino washes out of the eponymous bee when he notices Leaf Coneybear's buxom older sister Marigold in the audience just as he is given the word "tittup." Predictably, he spells it with only one "t" and is disqualified.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Melody_:
    -   Downplayed on Becca’s romantic path when the protagonist is fixing her sink and gets a view of her panties. He gets distracted from what he’s doing, but there are no bad consequences. Becca isn’t even that upset if he looks long enough that she catches him.
    -   Discussed by Melody. According to her, when she and Steve were together, Steve would check out other girls while on dates with her.

-   On Tumblr, Radioactivesupersonic posted an essay deconstructing the use of this trope to justify showing Action Girl characters in skimpy outfits. Their main point is that seduction is not a valid strategy in a combat situation, and is based on the assumption that the people she is fighting will be attracted to her and not be too savvy/sensible to fall for the trick — and if it _were_, why wouldn't male characters do it more often?

-   In the 50th Anniversary _Doctor Who_ panel video, Peter Davison begins talking about the legendarily Narm-inducing decision for Peri to be leaning over his Doctor's face in a super-low-cut top during his regeneration scene, itself an example of this trope. Only as he carries on talking about it, the other old Doctors become noticeably distracted by the large-breasted sign-language interpreter on stage right as she mimes the sign for "cleavage", dropping their sentences and losing focus. Except for Tom Baker, who acts completely oblivious, and doesn't turn around to look even after Peter Davison points her out to him and starts miming the sign himself to indicate what he's missing. And then double subverts it by suddenly turning around and delivering a very flirty "_hello_".
