The common view is that Reptiles Are Abhorrent. They're scaly, inhuman, and to some people, creepy... but some can be cute.

For a number of reasons, lizards tend to be regarded as some of the cuter reptiles. They're small with big eyes, traits that humans instinctively find endearing, and most are non-threatening to humans. Sure, some species of lizard can still seem creepy, but if you look closely, you can find some of the same qualities in them that make other animals endearing.

This perceived cuteness often leads to lizard characters being kindhearted and/or heroic, more so than other reptiles like snakes and crocodiles. Geckos and chameleons are the most commonly-used lizards for this trope, due to their small size and being among the cutest of lizards. Exotic-looking lizards such as iguanas, frilled lizards, bearded dragons, basilisks, horned lizards, and thorny devils are also popular choices, though they still have their share of negative portrayals as well. Monitor lizards, being the largest, scariest, and least "cute" of the lizards, are rarely portrayed this way. Gila monsters are also usually portrayed negatively due to being venomous and scary-looking. Skinks, despite being smaller, are also not likely to be portrayed as this due to looking "generic" and therefore creepy. And good luck finding a legless lizard — nobody can tell them apart from those awful _snakes_. However, despite legged lizards being the more likely squamates to be shown as lovable, this hasn't stopped portrayals of kindhearted snakes from occurring<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .

May or may not be Lizard Folk. May overlap with Hollywood Chameleons, especially in kids' shows where they make for brightly colored and charming sidekicks. Related to Wise Old Turtle, another common aversion of Reptiles Are Abhorrent. See also Delightful Dragon and Shoulder-Sized Dragon for this trope with wings.

    Advertising 

-   The GEICO gecko is a polite little guy with a Cockney accent.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Beastars_: Gosha is a rare example of a friendly _komodo dragon_. A former crime-fighting vigilante, he is now a friendly old man that volunteers at a day-care and is constantly worried of his venom hurting others. He's also a caring grandfather to the protagonist Legoshi.
-   _My Hero Academia_: Played with. The lizard man Spinner is a member of the League of Villains, but is one of the most benevolent Anti Villains in the series. He refuses to kill Midoriya because Stain has decided he is worthy of being a hero and even stops Magne's attacks towards him. Chapter 220 explores more of him to reveal he joined the League in an attempt to rebel against the Fantastic Racism against mutants rather than just wanting to destroy society like his boss.

    Comic Strips 

-   _FoxTrot_ has Jason's iguana Quincy. He doesn't really do much, but he has an adorable design and his child owner loves and dotes on him like the beloved pet that he is.

    Fanworks 

-   _Heaven's Light_: Pascal, again, since this is a crossover between _Tangled_ and _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_. He certainly endears himself to Quasimodo, being a Friend to All Living Things. Of course, Beware the Nice Ones still applies to him, as he contributes to the death of Big Bad Frollo's Hellish Horse Snowball later on.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Monsters, Inc._: Randall Boggs plays with this. In the original movie, he, a lizardlike monster, was portrayed as pure evil. But the prequel _Monsters University_ shows his Start of Darkness. As a teen, "Randy" was a shy, dorky, and innocent guy who just wanted to make friends. This led him to join the Jerk Jock fraternity, only for them to cast him out when he loses the big game to Mike and Sully, causing him to develop a grudge against Sully that guides his actions in the original movie. This is an interesting example because even though we know he's going to turn bad, his younger self in _MU_ is still quite cute and relatable, making him a great (if retroactive) example of straying away from Reptiles Are Abhorrent.
-   _Rango_: The title character, a dorky chameleon looking for his place in the world.
-   In _Tangled_, Rapunzel has a pet chameleon named Pascal, who is cute and feisty, as well as a bit of a Silent Snarker. However, he's also responsible for tripping Mother Gothel up so that she falls to her Disney Villain Death at the climax.
-   _The Rescuers Down Under_:
    -   Frank, an adorably hyperactive and nervous frilled lizard.
    -   While Joanna the Goana is a secondary antagonist, her doglike mannerisms are endearing. It's implied her antagonism is largely due to be being abused by her master, and she is spared in the end.

    Films — Live Action 

-   In the kung fu movie _Five Deadly Venoms_, the martial artist known as Lizard (because his style of kung fu allows him to walk up walls) is one of the heroes, while the warriors named after creepier animals (Centipede, Snake, and Scorpion) are bad guys.

    Literature 

-   _Art the Gecko Makes a Friend_: Art is cute and lovable and clearly adores his owner Brett.
-   _Lionboy_ has Ninu, a friendly little chameleon who befriends Charlie and Sergei.
-   Sissix from _The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet_ is an Aandrisk, a species of alien that looks a lot like a bipedal lizard. She is one of the more friendly beings on the _Wayfearer_, quickly helping Rosemary feel at home among the crew.
-   The _Shredderman_ books by Wendelin van Draanen have _The Gecko and Sticky_, an in-universe TV show about a gecko-themed superhero fighting crime with his pet gecko, Sticky, who can talk. The book's protagonist, Nolan Byrd, loves the show so much that it inspires him to create his own secret identity, kickstarting the plot.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Galavant_: King Richard's pet bearded dragon lizard, Tad Cooper, is a Ridiculously Cute Critter who, despite his owner's belief that he's the other kind of dragon, is completely harmless and docile. Except Richard's right about his lineage. He really was a baby dragon.
-   _Primeval_: Rex is a _Coelurosauravus_ who ends stranded in the present day and gets adopted by Abby and Connor as a pet, he is always portrayed as a friendly and loving animal with heavy loyalty to his "owners" and is the Team Pet of sorts of the good guys.
-   _Under the Umbrella Tree_ has Iggy the Iguana, who is the most lovable and relatable of the characters.

    Mythology 

-   The cultural heroes of the Adnyamathanha are Kudnu (literally "goanna" or "skink") and Muda ("gecko"). Traditionally lizards are thus respected by the Adnyamathanha.

    Sports 

-   The mascot for the National Hockey League's Vegas Golden Knights is Chance, a friendly gila monster with sparkly scales. When choosing a mascot, the Golden Knights felt an anthropomorphic animal would be cuter and more appealing to children than an actual knight, and chose the gila monster because it's a creature that can be found in Nevada.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Eberron_: The native celestials are the couatl, winged rainbow snakes. Because of this, rainbow snake motifs are very common in any religious context (especially for the Silver Flame, as Tira Miron was guided by a couatl), and Keith Baker suggests adding cosmetic snake features to existing celestials to reinforce this theme. There are still evil snake monsters, but they aren't seen as indicative of a wider trend any more than evil dog monsters or evil fire monsters.

    Video Games 

-   _Animal Crossing_:
    -   Nat the chameleon is a British-accented naturalist who hosts the Bug-Off Tournament.

    -   In _Pokémon Sword and Shield_, Gen VIII introduces Sobble, a little blue chameleon with big, watery eyes that looks like it's about to cry, hence its name and Water type.
-   Alphys from _Undertale_ is a monster resembling a golden, crested lizard or dinosaur. Her timid, socially awkward personality will make most players come to love her quickly.
-   _Gex_: Downplayed. While Gex is a gecko and the protagonist of the series, he is a selfish Anti-Hero in the first two games. Not exactly the innocent type, although his jokes and references help make him a little more likable. He does become more heroic in the third game, though.
-   In _Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil_, the Amusement Park Joilant has its own mascot in the form of a goofy-looking Cartoon Creature resembling a lizard or dinosaur. In the Joilant Fun Park level, he can be seen numerous times in the background, entertaining the guests.
-   _League of Legends_: Neeko is a half-chameleon Cute Monster Girl and one of the sweeter and more adorable Champions in the game.
-   Gary from _Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart_ is an interesting example: being a Snivelakian like the antagonistic Goons-4-Less, he's basically a tall, muscular lizard- or crocodile-like alien... But his big round eyes and gentle personality make him very endearing.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_: Espio the Chameleon is a member of the Chaotix detective agency, and also the stoic Only Sane Man of the group.

-   _Yooka-Laylee_: Yooka the chameleon, one of the two main protagonists, is kindhearted and optimistic.

    Webcomics 

-   The protagonist of _Broken Plot Device_ is Lizardbeth, a lovably eccentric iguana who writes and draws her own webcomic.

    Web Original 

-   Polite Lizard, a meme that started out with a video of a leopard gecko inching towards the camera with a big smile and Puppy-Dog Eyes. People started adding captions comparing the gecko to someone staring at something they want or love.

    Web Video 

-   Clint's Reptiles takes this view, as a reptile keeper eager to spread knowledge of proper animal care and recommendations for pets.

    Western Animation 

-   _Amazing Animals_: Henry the Gecko, the CGI-animated lizard.
-   Bing from _The Angry Beavers_ may be annoyingly clingy, but he is otherwise very amicable.
-   _Dora the Explorer_: Isa the Iguana, one of Dora's animal companions and The Heart of their little Five-Man Band.
-   _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe_ has Lizard Man, sometimes just called Lizzie. He's not nearly as beefed up and muscular as most of the heroes (he didn't have an action figure in those days), but he's a nice and heroic guy and very good at climbing.
-   Much of _The Lion Guard_'s edutainment value comes from teaching kids about different wild animals, so the heroes meet up with a few of these:
    -   Kinyonga, a Badass Adorable veiled chameleon who helps the Lion Guard by spying on Scar in the Outlands thanks to her camouflage ability.
    -   Hodari, a William's dwarf gecko who forms a Brains and Brawn duo with Makuu.
-   The animated short film _Lizard Quest_ stars an _adorable_ little gecko going on a quest with a turtle and a chameleon, who are more experienced adventurers and see the gecko as The Load. The gecko has a tendency to get stuck to things, which lands him in trouble a few times until he uses it to help defeat the dragon, making the turtle and chameleon realize how special he is and accept him into the group.
-   Liz of _The Magic School Bus_, Ms. Frizzle's loyal sidekick Jackson chameleon.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: In _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Summertime Shorts_, Sunset Shimmer gets a pet in an adorable leopard gecko which she names Ray.
-   _Oscar's Oasis_ features a titular protagonist who is a gecko.
-   _Ovide and the Gang_ has Polo, a giant red lizard who is one of the main heroes.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: In one episode, the boys find a chameleon and name him Steve. Ferb especially takes such a shine to the reptile that when he goes missing, Ferb delivers an epic (and utterly out of character) Rousing Speech when Phineas and Isabella are about to give up.
-   _PJ Masks_: Gekko, a young Lizard themed superhero. He also has a pet lizard named Lionel, who acts more like a dog than a reptile (he likes to play fetch).
-   _Santiago of the Seas_: Nacho is the pet green iguana of Tomas, one of the main characters of the series. He is quite adorable and seems to love cuddling with his human and dozing off.
-   Komodo from _The Secret Saturdays_ is one of Zak's animal companions. Being a Komodo dragon, however, he is less pleasant than most examples.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "Selma's Choice", Selma gains a pet iguana named Jub-Jub, who formerly belonged to her deceased aunt Gladys. She shows a lot of affection for the lizard, even cradling him like a baby.
    -   Played with in "Bart the Mother". Bart takes in what he thinks are two bird eggs, but they turn out to be Bolivian tree lizards, a fictional species that lay their eggs in bird nests to feed off the birds. Bart grows attached to them anyway, and is horrified when Principal Skinner tries to kill them (as he runs a birdwatching club and considers the lizards destructive) but saves them with Marge's help and releases them into the wild. Here, the "lovable" part comes not so much from the lizards themselves, but with Bart's fondness for them, which is truly heartwarming:
        
        **Bart:** Everyone thinks they're monsters. But I raised them and I love them.
        
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ has these as mutants, depending on the continuity.
    -   Mondo Gecko, who was an ordinary gecko (or a human) prior to his mutation, is a skater who tends to start out misguidedly working for villains (or extremists at best) before he befriends the ninja turtles. He naturally gets along the most with fellow skater Michelangelo.
-   _Work It Out Wombats!_: Although fastidious, Mr. E is ultimately a warm-hearted, helpful, and hard-working iguana.
