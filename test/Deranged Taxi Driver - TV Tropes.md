...Better leave him a good tip.

_"We hope you enjoyed the ride! Ha ha!"_

Maybe he's a Cloudcuckoolander, maybe a Serial Killer... either way, once you're in his cab you're in serious trouble.

The Deranged Taxi Driver is a Sub-Trope of The Driver, defined by their deep-down craziness. This can take many different forms: maybe a Conspiracy Theorist who babbles to their customers while stuck in traffic, or even The Sociopath who uses the job as an excuse to collect victims. Odds are he Drives Like Crazy, but often is strangely efficient at getting someone from Point A to Point B. It's getting them there in _one piece_ that's the hard part. In the US, taxi driving is a common occupation for new immigrants so the driver may be a Funny Foreigner. In Britain he's more likely to be a Lower-Class Lout.

Just as unpredictable is their effect on the plot; the driver may be part of a Trauma Conga Line for the protagonist, the actual Big Bad, or even form an Odd Friendship with the protagonist if they turn out to be helpful. May overlap with Not My Driver and the "Hostile To Hitchhikers" variant of Hostile Hitchhiker. Compare Buses Are for Freaks.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Jin the Taxi Driver, an episodic character from _Canaan_, is entertainingly deranged in that he is completely unfazed by danger and will take the most insane routes to get his passengers to their destination despite any and all opposition (which includes The Triads and the Tongs and international terror cells). His unhinged, yet entertaining image is further enhanced by his voice actor, Joji Nakata, who hams it out the entire time while Jin is on-screen.

    Comedy 

-   Jerry Seinfeld has this bit from his act:
    
    _And the way they drive. You can see they're upset. I don't know what it's like to drive a cab. It must be very difficult because they're very upset, these people. Sometimes, you just want to lean over that seat and ask "What is happening in your life and your mind that is making you drive like this? Take it easy!"_
    

    Comic Books 

-   Downplayed in _From Hell_ with Netley the coachman (a Victoria-era version of a cab driver). He comes off as an average working Joe, and even shows some resistance to the story's more sinister themes. It doesn't make him any saner for his current fare: transporting Dr. William Gull, AKA Jack the Ripper, as he commits his infamous murders.
-   The Zen Cabbie from _Top 10_ wears a blindfold and Drives Like Crazy, justifying it as "I don't drive the cab, the universe does" (even in a city where Everyone Is a Super, he still comes off as a loon). Considering the fact that he picks up his passengers wherever they need transportation the most and they arrive to wherever they need to go Just in Time to accomplish whatever they need to do, he may have a point.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _The Big Lebowski_: The Dude complains about the Eagles playing in the taxi taking him home from Malibu; the cab driver responds with a Cluster F-Bomb and throws him out on the side of the road.
-   _Conspiracy Theory_: Jerry Fletcher is a paranoid New York cab driver who rants and raves about conspiracies to any passenger who will listen (and anyone who won't). His home is basically a survivalist's bunker, even armed with a self-destruct system. It turns out that he has a good reason for his erratic behavior; he may have been an MK Ultra subject, brainwashed into being a sleeper assassin and now fighting his programming.
-   _Deadpool (2016)_: Dopinder the Taxi Driver befriends Deadpool after the latter gave him some questionable romantic advice. In attempting to follow said advice, he ends up kidnapping his romantic rival and stuffing him in the backseat of the cab. In _Deadpool 2_, he starts trying to become a mercenary like Deadpool attempts to join the X-Force.
-   _Ernest Saves Christmas_: Ernest P. Worrell starts the movie as a taxi driver, and applies the same work ethic as all his other jobs. We see him swerving around the freeway (at one point so hard the passenger _falls out_), accidentally sending the cab through the air, and eventually loading his catatonic-from-fear passenger onto a luggage conveyor by accident.
-   _Escape from New York_: The Cabbie is a friendly, enthusiastic Cloudcuckoolander who seems to have no problem being trapped in a city full of violent criminals, driving an armored taxi and using Molotov cocktails to drive off crazies who threaten his customers; when he meets Snake Plissken (an infamous gunfighter and thief) he reacts like a little kid meeting his football hero. At the end, when the President shows little regard for Cabbie and others who died getting him out of New York, an enraged Plissken humiliates him by tricking the President into playing Cabbie's copy of "Bandstand Boogie" at a summit instead of a tape about nuclear fusion, while Snake destroys the real tape.
-   _For a Good Time, Call..._: Kevin Smith has a cameo as a caller to the main characters' phone sex line, a cab driver pleasuring himself _while on duty._ Then we see he even has a passenger in the back seat waiting for him to finish.
-   _The Game (1997)_: Nicholas Van Orton is trapped in a cab with a grinning man who Drives Like Crazy, before leaping from the cab as it drives into the river, taking Nicholas with it (he manages to escape). Subverted at the end when we see the driver among the many actors employed by CRS for the Game Nicholas is trapped in; the entire incident was staged.
-   _Ghost Dad_: Elliot makes the epic mistake of catching a ride with Satanist taxi driver Curtis Burch, who drives erratically and screams about obeying his "Dark Master" (Elliot pretends to be Satan and commands him to stop, causing Burch to drive the cab into a river). When he runs into Burch again at the end, Elliot orders him to go straight to hell and Burch ecstatically drives off.
-   Mentioned in _Men in Black_ when K reveals to J that many Manhattan citizens are aliens in disguise, most just trying to adapt and make a living:
    
    **J:** Cab drivers?  
    **K:** Not as many as you'd think.
    
-   Downplayed in _Pulp Fiction_ with Esmerelda Villalobos. She's perfectly lucid and transports Butch with no trouble... but she's also _very_ interested in discussing how it felt when he beat a man to death in a boxing match.
-   _Rat Race_: Incompetent NFL ref Owen Templeton catches a ride with a seemingly friendly cab driver while racing to get to a cash prize; unfortunately, he doesn't realize the driver lost a bet on a football game because of Owen's botched call. The driver ends up stranding him in the middle of the desert in his boxers.

-   Probably the most famous (and infamous) example in cinema: Travis Bickle, the Anti-Hero of _Taxi Driver_.

-   The page quote is provided by Johnny Cab from _Total Recall (1990)_, an android cab driver who gets hijacked by the hero, Doug Quaid.

-   _How I Met Your Mother_: A subtle example, but one episode opens with narrator and protagonist Ted musing about how his life would have changed if he had gotten into a different cab than the one he rode one fateful day.

Later in the episode, a character is reading a newspaper with the headline "Nude Cabbie Vows To Kill Again."

-   In the 1998 Dutch Foreign Remake of British Edutainment show _Police, Camera, Action!_, there was footage from 1996 of a deranged Dutch taxi driver doing 204 km/h (125mph) on a motorway near Hengelo, the Netherlands. Apparently, he was in a rush to get his fare to the airport on time, but that still didn't explain why he needed to do _125mph_. Borders on Refuge in Audacity as well.
-   _Sherlock_: In the first episode, "A Study in Pink", Holmes' investigation into a Serial Killer leads him to a terminally ill cabbie who forces his victims into a sick game of Russian Roulette involving poison pills.

Shortly afterward, we see the driver pick up a new unsuspecting passenger.

    Video Games
