A chase scene trope wherein Bob (the chased) runs/drives through an area containing people potentially hostile to both him and Charlie (the chaser), in the hopes of slowing the chaser down. Usually this involves riling them up somehow. If it fails, Bob ends up Chased by Angry Natives.

-   In the _Cowboy Bebop_ episode "Stray Dog Strut", Hakim (the bounty of the week), Spike, and two scientists are all chasing after Ein on foot. Ein runs under a card table where a couple of guys are playing chess as a crowd watches. Hakim, who's enormously tall, easily clears the table, leaving the group surprised. Then Spike simply crashes through the table. By the time the two scientists arrive, they find their way blocked by a bunch of angry people.

    Comic Books 

-   Used in _Asterix_ by one of the boars in the forest. Whenever pursued by the Gauls, he leads them across a Roman patrol, and flees while they beat each other up.
-   In _Hitman vs. Lobo_, Hitman uses this trick, shooting Lobo in the eyes (forcing him to follow by smell until they regenerate) and leading him in a merry chase through all the local gang meeting places, dispatching several of his personal foes in the ensuing chaos. Then he leads him into an actual ambush by Six-pac and his squad... The gods of plot are with him and the most incompetent band of super-misfits on the planet actually wins.
-   In one of the _Kaamelott_ comics, Arthur and co are climbing to the top of a mountain to defeat an evil necromancer. Along the way, they come across a gigantic Rodent of Unusual Size, fortunately asleep.

    -   _The Punisher: Welcome Back, Frank_: Chased by Mafia goons through a zoo, Frank runs through the polar bear enclosure, punches the first sleepy one he sees and keeps running. By the time the goons get there, they are facing three very pissed-off polar bears.
    -   In another story, Frank is driving around town killing various gang members and criminals. One group survives the initial attack and gives chase. Frank gets rid of them by driving through a Mafia meeting without stopping, the gangstas following aren't so lucky.

    Fan Works 

-   _All Guardsmen Party_: The Guardsmen are trying to return to base, but are being tailed by a very aggressive traffic cop. Not willing to expose themselves either by revealing the base or gunning down a police officer, they instead drive a few laps through the middle of a gunfight between some Hive gangs. Their van only takes a few incidental bullets, while the cop is deliberately shot down and swarmed by pipe-wielding kids. When he shows up later, the cop is _pissed_.
-   _Here Comes The New Boss_: Squealer tries to shake Elpis' pursuit by driving through the middle of a _second_ car chase cum running battle, between the Empire and the Teeth, with razor force fields and rifles making the whole area deadly. Elpis responds by just pressing the accelerator.

    Film 

-   Inverted in _A Low Down Dirty Shame_; Shame interrogates a Latino crook, then lets him go... turns out they were backstage of a Skinhead rally.
-   _Raiders of the Lost Ark_: Belloq sent the Hovitos on Indiana Jones after taking from him the idol from the temple. Through a combination of holding the idol and speaking the native's language, he was able somehow to command them to go after Indy.
-   _Serenity (2005)_: The crew of _Serenity_ intentionally provoke a fleet of Reaver spaceships into following them so that they can use them in a surprise attack on the Operative's fleet.

    Literature 

-   _Cultist of Cerebon_: When faced with a nest of System Spawn too powerful for his party to defeat, Zareth comes up with the idea of putting a group of sand elementals between themselves and the System Spawn, then spreading a pheromone on the wind that makes the Spawn rush forward and attack in a frenzy. Some of the Spawn get past the elementals and fight the party, but most of them are overcome by the elementals, and their nest is left practically vacant.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   This is awkwardly done by Harry in _Small Favor_ when a huge snow storm has hit most of Chicago. Harry and a friend head to the train station to acquire something when they are beset upon by hobs, small imp-like monsters beholden to the Winter Queens. While they are handling these monsters and protecting people, one of the Gruffs, a Summer Fae assassin who has been trying to chase him, arrives in the form of a 10ft or taller goat-man. Summer Fae and Winter Fae have a deep dislike of each other at the best of times. So, Harry tricks the hobs into noticing the wounded Gruff and let nature take its course.
    -   In _Changes_, this is discussed, and Harry has to vehemently deny that this was his intention. He explains to the native party that he had no way of knowing that when he was escaping Red Court vampires pursuing him in the Chicago field office of the FBI, and he opened a door to the spirit world to escape, he would land in the private dining hall of the Erlking, a powerful Fae who has wanted to kill Harry ever since he trapped the Erlking in a magic circle. The Red Court vampires try to claim this whole thing is a plot by Harry to get the Erlking to kill them in Harry's place. The concept of being used like that angers the Erlking, who decides to let the parties face trial by combat. The victor will win his protection as a guest, the other will be treated like an invader.
-   Hermione attempts this in _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_, running through the centaurs' territory in the hopes that Umbridge will be dealt with by them. However, it turns out that the centaurs do _not_ appreciate being used that way, even if the target is the villainous Dolores Umbridge. They carry off Umbridge, but then turn on Hermione and Harry.
-   _Interesting Times_: Rincewind, pursued by the palace guard, finds himself trapped in the wrestler's quarters. He gets out of it by pointing at one of the guards, claiming he has a pork sandwich on him, and escapes as the guards are crushed in the stampede.
-   In _The Misenchanted Sword_, the protagonist — a soldier behind enemy lines — takes a nap in a tree, and when he wakes up, there's a young dragon on the ground beneath him. He jumps on the dragon but is unable to kill him, so he runs away through the forest, the dragon chasing him, until he finds himself unwittingly on the edge of a large enemy encampment. He screams and runs through the camp — and the sentries, soldiers, etc. who start chasing him have to turn around to deal with the dragon.
-   At least one _Redwall_ novel has the heroes evade capture by stirring up hornets or wasps and running just as the vermin approach.

    Video Games 

-   In _City of Heroes_, it's possible to use this as a PK technique by using a combination of long-range attacks and stealth to 'pull' a powerful group of monsters on top of enemy players.
-   _Valheim_:
    -   Enemies from different biomes will attack each other on sight (and some are native to certain biomes but can spawn in different ones, such as skeletons in the Black Forest), so it's possible to kite pursuers into a group of hostiles and escape both.
    -   It's also a good way to collect resources from hard-to-hit enemies killed by others (e.g., you'll often find deerskins and meat lying on the ground courtesy of the skeletons guarding a nearby tomb).
    -   The Mistlands update added dverger outposts, which contain valuable components. Since the only way to get them is to break the crate, which causes the dverger to (understandably) turn on you, and since the dverger are some of the few enemies who _don't_ try to murder you on sight, many players get around the ethical dilemma by kiting local enemies like Seekers into the dverger's base, then coming back to loot the place once they're all dead.
-   It's (sometimes) possible to pull this off in _Warcraft III_, which contains monsters equally hostile to all players. However, it requires good timing so they don't attack you, and if your enemy is strong enough, fighting them merely gets him more money, experience, and items.
