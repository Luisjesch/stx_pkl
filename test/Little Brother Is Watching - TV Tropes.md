_"Careful the things you say;  
Children will listen.  
Careful the things you do;  
Children will see,  
And learn.  
Children may not obey,  
But children will listen..."_

It's been said before that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. However, what if the behavior in question really shouldn't be complimented? Children Are Innocent, but sometimes that Ambiguous Innocence leads them to copy behaviors from their role models that are less than ideal. While some, like the Card-Carrying Villain, may appreciate this, and others, like the Anti-Role Model, may not care, some others do care and don't necessarily like where it leads. Some Evil Parents Want Good Kids, after all.

It's one thing that they're being evil and damning their own souls. It's another when they're teaching children who look up to them to do the same. Realizing this, they may try to keep their bad behavior a secret from their children for a while. However, others take a different path. Realizing that their secret will inevitably come out, or perhaps simply unable to answer why they're doing something they don't want youngsters to ever learn to do, they perform a Heel–Face Turn. No more evil for him!

This trope can and does encompass more mundane behaviors as well (e.g. drug use). The fundamental idea is that the parent, sibling, or role model does something that he doesn't want another to find out, not because it will ruin his life - most people probably already know - but because he doesn't want to influence the younger person to do the exact same thing. In order to make sure that doesn't happen - or sometimes upon discovery, although it's more often used as prevention - he quits the bad behavior.

Often, this is to avert Corrupt the Cutie.

Sub-Trope of Morality Pet. Parent trope to Not in Front of the Kid.

Not to be confused with Big Brother Is Watching, where the government makes sure you are responsible by being ready to punish any immoral acts.

    Advertising 

-   There's an _Above the Influence_ (anti-drug use) ad that provides a solid example of this trope: as an older sister lights up, the flame reflects in the eye of her younger brother, who is spying through the keyhole. The implication is that the girl should/will change her behavior, as she seems to notice her brother at the end of the ad.
-   A print _Above the Influence_ ad showed an older boy and a younger boy on either side of the page. Various opinions, such as "I think cartoons are for kids" were printed over the older boy and then immediately repeated over the younger one. The last was "I don't smoke weed, it's not my thing."
-   There was an anti-marijuana PSA that played this trope. In it, a teenage basketball player's little brother watches him win a streetball game. After the game, the teen meets up with some friends and one (the token female in the group) offers him some pot with the PSA's voiceover saying, "Some people think smoking weed makes you cool." His little brother is then shown looking at him in awe, and the voiceover asks, "But what about those who think you already are?"
-   In an anti-drug PSA a father is yelling at his son about the marijuana he found. "Where did you learn to do this stuff?" "From you, alright? I learned it by watching you!"

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Doraemon_: In "Soap Bubbles", Toby thinks he's a horrible person for smoking and he hopes Noby never smokes as an adult.
-   _Lupin III_: An indication of a Lighter and Softer storyline is the introduction of a child as the main character.
    -   Lupin III: Part 1 has "Rescue the Tomboy", a story where Lupin steals a person from her uncle! Her father was in Lupin II's gang, and asked Lupin the Third to bring her back because her "uncle", the third man of their gang, is trying to blackmail him by threatening her life.
    -   Lupin is known as a Handsome Lech, but for Clarisse's sake in _The Castle of Cagliostro_, he tries to be a Thief In A Stylin' Suit. When Lupin tells Jigen and Goemon about being "wild and crazy" in his past, their silence can suggest that Lupin may have been talking about _last week_. At the end of the movie, she hugs him tight and begs to become a thief and leave Cagliostro with him. Lupin visibly trembles before he pushes her away gently.
-   This trope is discussed more than anything in the Fishman Island arc of _One Piece_. A recurring theme throughout that arc is the Cycle of Revenge and central characters of the arc not wanting to pass their prejudices regarding humans on to the next generation, even when some of them could not let go of that hatred themselves. Arc villains the New Fishman Pirates are a case of Corruption of a Minor because that prejudice _was_ passed down to them.
-   _Tiger Mask_ makes a Heel–Face Turn, for good, when he is approached by a fan who says he wants to grow up to become a villain.

    Comic Books 

-   In the "Mother Russia" arc of _The Punisher MAX_, Frank is trying to retrieve a young girl (around the same age as his daughter was) whose blood contains a biological superweapon that will eat her alive if he doesn't get her out of there. The Russians send a guy called the Mongolian, who kicks Frank's ass until he threatens the girl. Frank goes Papa Wolf, "twisting his leg off like a drumstick until I realize she's watching". Later on, he sees her pick up a gun to help him and immediately takes it from her so she won't shoot herself or someone.

    Fan Works 

-   _Down And Out_ both plays it straight and averts it.
    -   Played straight with Grace with the Apex, with the young woman going out of her way to make sure none of the remaining Apex children are aware that she is keeping Simon prisoner, only visiting him when they leave to explore nearby cars or are sleeping. Becomes a moot point once all the Apex children successfully leave the train.
    -   Averted with Amelia and Hazel, with the former not caring at all what behavior seven-year-old Hazel witnesses from her, while Hazel has become too jaded from her time with Grace and Simon months prior to view _anyone_ as a good role model, clinging to the lessons taught by her murdered mother figure Tuba instead.
-   _The Weedverse_: In _Foalsitting Follies_, Radiance beats up Nuance, constantly accusing him of being a Spoiled Brat who "doesn't get punished _enough_!" It turns out Radiance acts this way because he's spent a lot of time watching the Royal Guard train.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _American History X_, Derek Vinyard gets out of prison for murder and has to convince his little brother Danny to stop imitating his white supremacist life style, which Derek has since renounced.
-   At the end of _Angels with Dirty Faces_, Jerry tells Rocky that the boys in Jerry's care look up to Rocky and stand a chance of becoming criminals themselves because they idolize Rocky so. When Rocky is finally taken to the electric chair, instead of acting tough like he bragged about, he screamed, cried, begged for his life and "died yellow". It's ambiguous whether he truly panicked or just acted that way to discourage the kids from thinking he was cool. (Perhaps a bit of column A, a bit of column B?) Jerry, who became a priest instead of a crook like Rocky, then asks the boys to pray for the soul of a little boy who couldn't run as fast.
-   _Boy_: A pretty scummy con artist couple routinely run a Staged Pedestrian Accident in which they have their older son, a 10-year-old, step in front of cars to fake accidents. One day the younger son, a toddler, does what he's seen his older brother do so many times, and steps in front of a car. The motorist swerves to avoid him and is killed.
-   In the film _Boys Town_ Mickey Rooney plays the younger sibling; he idolizes his older brother, who is in prison for murder. Older brother contacts Father Flanagan, asking him to take in his little brother so he won't follow the same path.
-   Near the end of _The Emperor's Club_, Sedgwick tells Mr. Hundert that principles mean nothing and that he will be as unethical as necessary to succeed in the world - only to see his young son standing nearby, who heard everything.

    Literature 

-   In the PT Deutermann Military Academy crime thriller _Darkside_, US Naval Academy security chief Jim Hall states "The Midshipmen are always watching!", implying that if the Academy's senior leadership preaches about honor, morality and integrity, but doesn't practice those values themselves due to careerism, the midshipmen (naval cadets) will learn to do the same and lose respect for Navy leadership.
-   In _Little Lord Fauntleroy_, the Earl of Dorincourt becomes less selfish and more considerate, because his grandson Cedric thinks about him as a kind-hearted, generous man and looks up to him, and the earl doesn't want to disappoint the boy.
-   Sam Vimes' _own past self_ basically fills this role in _Night Watch_. The "present" Vimes is stuck in the past playing the role of his own mentor, John Keel, and knows that his younger self needs a swift crash course in being lawful and good to get him to _Guards! Guards!_ with his morals more-or-less intact. On three separate occasions (only two of which young Sam is actually there for), he takes the heroic / risky approach over the fast and brutal one because of this.
-   _Roys Bedoys_: An example involving an actual little brother occurs in “Don’t Say Bad Words, Roys Bedoys!”, when Roys instantly changes his mind about swearing when Loys learns a swear word from him.

    Live-Action TV

-   _Scrubs_ has J.D. parody the anti-marijuana PSA mentioned above in his head with himself being a caffeine-addict finding a coffee-machine in his son's room.
    
    **J.D.:** _(sniffs)_ At least he's using good beans...
    
-   Ian and Lip in the US version of _Shameless (US)_ make their little brother Carl wear earmuffs at night so they can talk about various illegal activities openly. However, Carl is naturally more sociopathic than either of his older brothers.

    Music 

-   The country song "Watching You" by Rodney Atkins is about a man who realizes that his four-year-old son is learning from him when he curses under his breath and then hears his boy immediately repeat it, saying he wants to be just like his dad. When they get home, the dad goes alone (or so he thinks) to the barn and prays, hoping that in the future he'll try to be a better example for his son. That night, at bedtime, the little boy prays before climbing into his bed, and says that he wants to be just like his dad.
-   The third verse of the song "Hero" by Superchic\[k\](it starts around 2:10) is about an older brother who makes some bad choices, unaware that his nine year old brother "who wants to be him" is following his example, and that his choices will change his little brother's life. Whether he tries to be a better example is left up to the listener.

    Theatre

-   Invoked in BioWare games. There's often one party member that's almost always female and younger than the Player Character (Mission Vao, Wild Flower, Merrill, Nadia, Mako, Ashara) , and they're often naive and good-natured, approving of charitable or kind actions. While you _can_ do evil actions while they're in the party, their reaction to cruel actions is tailored toward What the Hell, Player?
-   Daughter of the late Empress and implied daughter of Corvo, Emily Kaldwin plays this trope as a part of the Karma System in _Dishonored_. After rescuing her fairly early, members of the resistance begin taking care of her while Corvo (you) are on assassination and abduction missions. Killing on your part encourage the girl's drawings to go from a tad Creepy Cute to trading her naive charms entirely for something colder and darker, ultimately turning her into a tyrannical Empress who cares only for her protector.
