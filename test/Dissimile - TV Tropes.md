_"Boxing is a lot like ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other."_

— _Deep Thoughts_ by **Jack Handey**

A Dissimile is like when you eat a banana, but instead of peeling it, you compare it to another thing that isn't entirely like it. And instead of eating it, you deconstruct the comparison. Also, it doesn't necessarily have to be a banana, or any other kind of fruit, or even anything edible. Actually, it is nothing like eating a banana. Forget the banana.

Let's try again. A Dissimile is when you attempt to make a comparison between two things that can't be usefully compared, realize your problem, and then throw more words at the argument in an attempt to salvage it. This just undermines your comparison even further, to the amusement of anyone listening.

This can take several different forms:

-   "This is just like X, only without (element{s} crucial to X, sometimes a Long List)."
    -   Variation: may include at least one dissimilar addition alongside the subtractions (see Jack Handey quote above) or consist entirely of them.
    -   Optional postscript: "Come to think of it, it's not like X at all."
    -   Or, sometimes, the opposite: "But other than that it's just like X!"
-   "This is just like X! And by 'X', I mean, 'A'."
    -   Occasionally followed up by "And by 'A' I mean 'B'." ...and so on.
    -   May involve parallel replacements, as in "This is just like W X, and by 'W', I mean, 'A', and by 'X', I mean 'B'."
-   "You know what X is like? That's exactly what this isn't like."
    -   Alternatively, "This is just like X, except not," or, "This is just like X, only different."
-   Inverted Trope: "Besides, Y is nothing like X", where X and Y are pretty much exactly the same.

Often used as a comedy trope, but it has been known to show up in dramatic situations as well. Usually, characters will use dissimiles to make themselves look like a smartass, or because they derive amusement from raising someone else's hopes and then quickly dashing them. It may also show up as part of a pattern of Buffy Speak.

Compare The Other Wiki's article on this. Except it's not always played for laughs. And the person doesn't have to realize they've made a Dissimile. But aside from that, exactly like The Other Wiki's article.

On the other hand, a Dissimile often has a lot of overlap with Metaphorgotten. Also compare with Analogy Backfire and Lies to Children. See also Talks Like a Simile and I Would Say If I Could Say.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the Bount arc dub from _Bleach_, Rukia is offered a pudding-filled rice ball, and later says, "It's kinda like a cream-filled donut, only it's not cream-filled and it's not a donut." Also counts as a Take That! to dub edits.
-   Haruhi Suzumiya once commented in a _Haruhi-chan_ short that playing tug of war with Kyon reminded her of the times when two women who claimed to have the same baby would tug on the child as a test. However, while the "winner" of that game would have to let go of the baby, instead of pulling it as hard as she can, Haruhi intended to win by holding onto Kyon. Kyon then commented that the difference Haruhi pointed out renders her speech pointless.
-   Used once in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, when Yue gives Negi "hot cola".
    
    _"It's like hot chocolate, but not."_
    

    Card Games 

    Comic Books 

-   A partial example in a 1994 _Batman_ comic book, when three punks are confronting Batman. Their leader points his gun and brags that in just a few seconds, Batman will look "like a plate of spilled Spaghetti-O's!" And then, after an awkward pause: " - without the plate!"
-   The View Askewniverse comic _Chasing Dogma_ features Jay describing Pittsburgh thus: "Except for the hockey arena, the zillion fucking bridges, all the buildings, and a couple of rivers, this looks exactly like the tri-town, doesn't it?"
-   The French comic series _Leo Loden_ - whose Character Title is a detective from Marseille - opens often with a visited city of France depicted as "exactly like Marseille, except..." ...many differences.
-   _Nextwave_ is like Shakespeare but with lots more punchin'. It's like Goethe but with lots more crushing. It's like Titanic but the boat's still floating. No it's not! The mother\_\_\_\_ing boat is exploding!
-   In the first issue of _Simpsons Comics_, Burns contemplates becoming a giant and says, "I'll be like the Jolly Green Giant, only not green, and not jolly!”
-   In _Tintin: Explorers on the Moon_, when Captain Haddock is explained by Prof. Calculus how the Moon Rocket will turn around before landing, he ends up concluding that "It is exactly like during take off, except that it is the complete opposite".
-   _Watchmen_: "You know that kind of cancer you eventually get better from? That's not the type of cancer I have."

    Comic Strips 

-   In one strip of _Dilbert_, Dogbert describes time: "It's like a donut shot out of a cannon and spinning at the speed of light, only without the donut and the cannon."
-   During an arc in _FoxTrot_ where Roger tries to write a spy novel, his main character is described as doing something with "the cat-like agility his name would imply, if foxes were cats"; the narrator then goes on a tangent about how said main character naturally knows the difference, given his Ph.D. in zoology (and six dozen other disciplines).
-   _Garfield_ - "Life is like a bird bath. It's made of concrete and birds like to splash around in it. Boy, that was dumb. Life isn't anything like a bird bath. Life... is like a sock monkey..."
-   _Zits_:
    -   Pierce says his family life "is like a symphony. But there aren't any musical instruments, and the musicians just yell at each other."
    -   In another, he (white) compares his black girlfriend D'ijon's skin to brushed mahogany. "But not hard like mahogany. Like that skin that forms on caramel pudding when you leave it out for a week." She's not amused.

    Fan Works 

-   Lampshaded in _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_:
    
    **Hobbes:** Calvin, let's put this into perspective. One book with about 50 pages is light. Fifteen thousand books, each with 50 pages, are impossible to pick up. It took a lot of snowflakes to build those four snowmen.  
    **Calvin:** You're comparing my snowmen to books? You're crazy. Go get the wagon.
    
-   _A Different Kind of Trio_:
    
    **Harry:** What even is quidditch?  
    **Matthew:** You know what football is, right? Well, it's just like that. Except there's only seven players on each team. And four balls to keep track of. You're obviously flying too, which is quite a bit different. Oh, and the goals are actually three large hoops at either end of the pitch.
    
-   This gem from _Forbiden Fruit: The Tempation of Edward Cullen_: "Jasper Cullen was tall with blond curly hair like straw only soft and nice and not dry."
-   _Growing_:
    -   The protagonist describes her boyfriend as a "really smart, but stupid, jock".
    -   In another example, Nyx tells her: "You do not know your mother because the woman whom \[sic\] gave birth to you is not your mother."
-   _Half-Life: Full Life Consequences_ describes the evil Combines as "robot things that weren't robots."
-   _Harry Potter and the Golden Ring_:
    
    **Barda:** Who is this...Umbridge?  
    **Karen:** A complete and total bitch. Think Talia Al Ghul without the looks, the money, the combat skills and the charisma.
    
-   _Harry Potter and the Long Kiss Goodnight_:
    
    Vernon, who had been changing colors, as first horror, then anger, then full-blown rage, then fear had wandered through his consciousness, suddenly found himself having a joyful cruciatus experience, which is kind of like a joyful cappuccino experience except for it being painful and not having any caffeinated goodness...well...I guess it really is nothing like it after all.
    
-   _Is Your Great-Aunt an AI?_:
    
    Soon, the bottle was refilled enough for Harry to risk drinking it (it felt like he had drunk liquid nitrogen, only without the vitrification and the damage to one's stomach from the liquid gas expanding and other horrid things that happened when one drank liquid nitrogen), and then he plunged through the flames.
    
-   In _Magical Relations_ Harry asks Hermione about Azkaban and Quidditch.
    
    **Hermione:** Complete opposites. Azkaban is the wizard prison. The guards are really creepy, I'll show you a picture later. And Quidditch is a sport, kind of like football, only nothing like it.
    
-   In _The Moment It Began,_ young Snape describes his flying ability (carried over from Deathly Hallows) as "quite like flying on a broom, only without a broom".
-   The crew of _Rocketship Voyager_ have never seen a holodeck before; the closest thing they have being a three-dimensional theatre called an Illusionarium, so Nee'Lix tries to explain what it is.
-   _Scars in the Moonlight_:
    
    Five and a half minutes later, Kitty had decided that the Gringotts mining carts were probably very similar to roller coasters, sans the whole going upside-down part. And the part where it was probably much longer than the average roller coaster ride. And the part where they somehow controlled a system of railroad switches at speed. That last one was easily the most terrifying.
    
-   _Shatterheart_: When Syaoran looks at the mannequins in the clothing store.
    
    _"Flowing dresses with sequined accessories hung from plastic dolls made to resemble the human figure, if that figure happened to be anorexic."_
    
-   _Summer_:
    
    **Sally:** That motorbike... is practically a death trap. I know you had Arthur Weasley put in some extra features, don't think I hadn't noticed. DF stands for Dragon Fire, doesn't it?  
    **Sirius:** It's actually Destination Finale.  
    **Sally:** And I suppose G. O. is Game Over?  
    **Sirius:** No, that's actually a board game, sort of like Chess but nothing like it at all.
    
-   _Thirty Hs_: "Harry slammed his book shut. It wasn't really a book, because the pages were made of lasers and the words were made of headless women making godless love to dragons made of motorcycles, but it was still reading."
-   _Three Black Birds_:
    
    **Lindsey:** Okay, riding a bike is pretty similar to flying, except you're not flying. Well, fine, it's not like flying in that respect. But otherwise they're totally the same! Except you have to pedal to go forward, and push the brakes to stop, and you can't do barrel rolls. And you'll fall over if you're not moving.
    
-   _Thunderclap_:
    
    **Draco:** Look. It doesn't drown you. It lets you drift. It's the most relaxing thing that I've ever heard of. Like being underwater, but you don't drown, and you're a lot warmer, and you can listen to the songs of the creatures here without fearing that anyone's going to attack you.  
    **Harry:** So, _not_ very much like being underwater, then.
    
-   From _Twillight Sparkle's awesome adventure_: "The Mane Six – minus Twillight Sparkle who was with Doctor Whoowes and Rainbow Dash who was in a prison and Fluttershy who is useless – still fought against the guards."
-   _A Voice Among the Strangers_: In _A Stranger Among the Voices_, when Twilight looks at Jessica's x-ray, she briefly compares it to a diamond dog's before deciding it looks nothing like one.
    
    _"On a quick glance Twilight could make out it was a skeletal structure, perhaps of a diamond dog, although the skull was lacking a muzzle and... Well, on second thought, it looked nothing like a diamond dog."_
    
-   In _Wizard's Law_ Harry tries to teach Fred and George to play basketball.
    
    **George:** So what's the point of this game?  
    **Harry:** Same as Quidditch, you get the ball into the hoop. Only there's no flying, you don't have to dodge any other balls, and most of the players generally tend to be pretty tall. Like Madame Maxime-sized tall.
    
-   _Red_:
    
    The psychiatrist was nice enough: an old, balding man with glasses he constantly had to push up and a generally calm demeanor. Like Alfred, but weird and also a psychiatrist.
    
    …Okay, so not like Alfred.
    

    Film — Animated 

-   In _Cars_, Mater talks about an old girlfriend called Doreen, who "looked just like a Jaguar, 'cept she was a truck." (A bit of Actor Allusion, as Larry the Cable Guy would make similar comparisons on his stand-up. See Stand-Up Comedy below.)
-   _Mars Needs Moms_: "Relax, it's just like a waterslide. Without the water! Or the slide."
-   In _Monsters vs. Aliens_, General W.R. Monger tries to calm Ginormica by comparing her cell with a hotel... that she can't leave because the doors are locked. So... not a hotel then.
-   In _Rugrats Go Wild!_ when a wave of water crashes onto the boat, Phil says "This is just like bath time..except there's no duckie, and I'm not nakie." Then an actual duck shows up and the babies proceed to "get nakie" by removing their diapers.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   In _A Colbert Christmas_, Stephen Colbert says that Elvis Costello is like Avril Lavigne, except older, male, and instead of singing about skateboarding, he sings about people dying in shipyards.
-   In _Deadpool (2016)_, Wade's explanation of his relationship with Al.
    
    **Deadpool:** Al's like the Robin to my Batman... Except she's old. And black. And blind.
    
-   From _Down Periscope_:
    
    **Nitro:** Radio's working like a Swiss ... _car_.
    
-   _Elf_:
    
    **Jovie:** Thanks, but I don't sing.  
    **Buddy:** Oh, well, it's just like talking, except longer and louder, and you move your voice up and down!
    
    -   Another example:
        
        **Buddy:** (describing the mail room at his dad's office) It's just like Santa's workshop! Except it smells like mushrooms... ...and everyone looks like they want to hurt me.
        
-   In _Face/Off_, Sean Archer while wearing Castor Troy's face is in a prison when in comes Castor Troy wearing Archer's face and suit, and he quips "It's like looking in a mirror, only... _not_."
-   _Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle_:
    
    **Kumar:** How were Katie Holmes's tits? <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>   
    **Goldstein:** You know The Holocaust?  
    **Kumar:** Yeah.  
    **Goldstein:** Picture the exact opposite of that.

-   _The Last Starfighter_ After the alien Grig describes his home as a cave, Alex tries to describe his home.
    
    **Alex:** We live in a mobile home. It's like a cave...that's above ground...with wheels. You can go places. Only, we never went anywhere.
    
-   _The Muppets Take Manhattan_:
    
    **Bill the Frog:** How about this? Ocean Breeze Soap: It's just like taking an ocean cruise, only there's no boat and you don't actually go anywhere.
    
-   In _The Other Guys_, Allen tells Terry how he met his wife and adds that it's like that Meg Ryan movie. Terry can't think of any movies where Meg Ryan met a guy with poison ivy on his rectum. Later, Allen and his wife remember the movie: _You've Got Mail_, and both are certain that Tom Hanks had poison ivy in it.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_: "This is just like what the Greeks done at Troy,... only they was in a horse instead of dresses."
-   The commentary tracks for some of the _Saw_ movies' home video releases involve a Running Gag among the crew, wherein when someone describes something that isn't true or foolishly naive, they'll remark "That's a great idea. If by 'great', you mean 'the stupidest fucking thing ever', then yeah, it's 'great'.", or some variation thereof.
-   In _Scary Movie 2_, Cindy and Buddy find a painting of the wife who had lived in the house.
    
    **Buddy:** Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.  
    **Cindy:** Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?  
    **Buddy:** Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny. Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...  
    **Cindy:** Alright!
    
    -   When Cindy later shows a picture of her, Strange Minds Think Alike.
        
        **Theo:** Wow! She looks just like you... except she doesn't have as many split ends as you and her skin isn't as oily.  
        **Ray:** Yeah, and sometimes your eyes get all squinty and it looks like you got Down's Syndrome.  
        **Brenda:** Yeah, girl, damn near twins... except she's more sophisticated and classy. You got that cute, trailer park look.  
        **Shorty:** No doubt... and her tits are perfect, not at all pointy or funny looking. You got them National Geographic orangutan titties.  
        **Cindy:** Okay, I get the point.
        
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)_, Sonic's mentor Longclaw is described as being like Obi-Wan Kenobi, "if Obi-Wan had a beak and ate mice."
-   _Stuart Little 2_:
    
    **Snowbell:** (after Stuart's car overheats) I'm telling you, Stuart, it's a sign. This is just like the Burning Bush — except it's a carburetor, and I'm not Moses.
    
-   _¡Three Amigos!_ has Lucky's speech to the villagers of Santo Poco:
    
    **Lucky Day:** In a way, each of us has an El Guapo to face. For some, shyness might be their El Guapo. For others, a lack of education might be their El Guapo. For us, El Guapo is a big, dangerous guy who wants to kill us. But as sure as my name is Lucky Day, the people of Santa Poco can conquer their own personal El Guapo, who also happens to be the _actual_ El Guapo!
    
-   In _UHF_, George tries to convince his friend Bob to help him run the UHF station he recently became manager of.
    
    **George:** It's just like working in the fish market, except you don't have to clean and gut fish all day.
    

    Jokes 

-   Many Radio Yerevan jokes, like this one:
    
    Q: "Is it true that the famous cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin won a trip to the USA when he was in Leningrad?"  
    A: "It is true, except that it wasn't in Leningrad but Moscow, and not Gagarin but Gagarov, and not Yuri but Oleg, and he wasn't a cosmonaut but a retiree, and it wasn't a trip to the US but a bicycle, and he didn't win it, but it was stolen from him."
    
-   Some Anti-Humor jokes are along the lines of a Dissimile:
    
    Q: "What do an eagle and a gopher have in common?"  
    A: "They both live underground, except the eagle."
    
    -   There is also another joke that goes: "How is a duck like a bicycle? They both have handlebars. Except for the duck."
    -   What's the difference between a duck? One of his feet is both the same size.
-   There's an old joke where a wise rabbi says, "Life is like a fountain." When asked why, he thinks for a long time, and finally says, "Fine, so it's not a fountain."
-   There's a really long joke in Spanish that answers the question "What do a cow and an elevator have in common?". After a string of plays on words and relating objects to other ideas (gold mines, from gold you make rings, rings go in fingers, fingers have nails...) only for the punchline taking you to the word "eye". _An organ used to see that a cow and an elevator have nothing in common_.
-   Deadpan comedian Steven Wright: "I have a pair of pants just like these at home…except they're red with green stripes and they're shorts."
-   Comedian Tim Hawkins, on what he thinks of Jeopardy contestants: "Can I have a L? It's my favorite letter! 'Cause it's like a seven - but it's not!"
-   An old Jewish joke:
    
    "What's green, hangs on the wall, and whistles?"
    
    "A herring!"
    
    "But a herring isn't green!"
    
    "So paint it green."
    
    "It doesn't hang on the wall."
    
    "So hang it on the wall."
    
    "What about the whistling?"
    
    "Oh, I just threw that in to make it hard."
    

    Literature 

-   Peter Wilson's _40 Games for Frivolous People_:
    
    The idea of charades is very simple. You must convey a message without speaking or using any props. You therefore become a mime artist, except that you're not wearing black leotards or white face makeup, and you're not being paid.
    
-   In Jon Stewart's _America (The Book)_ chapter on the American Revolution, the section of "Would You Mind If I Told You How We Do It In Canada?" by Samantha Bee describes how Canada has also earned its independence similar to the US, then proceeds to list all the differences and finishes off with "All in all, a small price to pay for an independence achieved without bloodshed, violence, glory or independence."
-   Quoth Mack, in _The Automatic Detective_, it was just like the scene in the movies: "some dumb mug finds himself sitting in a tiny room with a cop standing over him, reading him the riot act. That's pretty much what happened to me." Except, he clarifies, he was standing, the room was quite large, and the cop was sitting and smoking a cigarette. But other than that, exactly like the scene in the movies.
-   Randall Garrett describing the Council of the Meich in his Affectionate Parody _Backstage Lensman_.
    
    Though they had no spines, they were something like porcupines; though they had no tentacles, they reminded one of octopuses; though they had no wings or beaks, they seemed similar to vultures; and though they had neither scales nor fins, there was definitely something fishy about them.
    
-   Humor columnist Dave Barry used this often.
    -   From his home repair book _The Taming of the Screw_:
        
        "A plumbing system is very much like your electrical system, except that instead of electricity, it has water, and instead of wires, it has pipes, and instead of radios and waffle irons, it has faucets and toilets. So the truth is that your plumbing system is nothing at all like your electrical system, which is good, because electricity can kill you."
        
    -   From _Claw Your Way to the Top_:
        
        "It might be useful to compare a business meeting to a football huddle. Everybody is a 'player' who is trying to get the 'ball' so they can 'carry' it to the 'endzone' in order to score a 'touchdown' and give the other players a 'pat' on the 'butt'. So you can see it is in fact not useful at all to compare a business meeting to a football huddle. It was a stupid idea, and I apologize for suggesting it."
        
    -   Other examples: Writing "giving a new meaning to the word fun" with a footnote that reads "not fun". Or saying that a car has the same maneuverability and handling as a municipal parking garage, only "without as much pickup". In fact, the latter is one of his favorite jokes: insulting A by saying it has as much B as C, where C doesn't have any B at all, and then \*further\* insulting A by saying that C has more D, where C doesn't have any D either.
    -   His blog recently advertised his new book thusly: "It's kind of like Moby Dick, but instead of a whale or a plot there are essays by members of the band in which we reveal intimate secrets about each other, such as who has, and who does not have, a spleen."
-   _Book of Imaginary Beings_: The goofang is described as being about the size of a sunfish, only much bigger.
-   Common in _Discworld_.
    -   In _Thief of Time_, Lobsang describes repairing history after the Glass Clock is activated as "Imagine a thousand invisible puzzle pieces scattered all throughout time and none of them fit together right. Got that? Okay, it's _nothing_ like that, that was just a vague analogy that might give you an inkling."
    -   "No, but it's a lie you can understand," gets used occasionally.
        -   Ponder Stibbons' version is when he describes an analogy as being very helpful in getting people to understand complicated magic while being, in every meaningful sense, wrong.
    -   This quote from _The Light Fantastic_:
        
        "Sunlight poured like molten gold across the sleeping landscape.<sup>Footnote&nbsp;</sup> "
        
    -   Also in _The Light Fantastic_, it's noted that an ancient ruler outlawed simile and metaphors, and any writer or casual speaker not careful with his phrasing would rapidly find himself a good deal shorter. About a head's worth, really (so someone describing a woman as having a face that launched a thousand ships had better have empirical evidence that the object of desire did indeed resemble a wine bottle, or appropriate documentation from shipyards).
    -   _Sourcery_:
        
        "Have you ever been bitten by a snake?"  
        "No."  
        "Then you know exactly what it felt like, it wasn't like a snake bite at all."
        
    -   In the Discworld spin-off books _The Science of Discworld_, the phrase "Lies to Children" is used to refer to analogies or descriptions that are completely wrong, but prepare the listener for the real truth.
    -   _Soul Music_ takes the (real) simile that a guitar is shaped like a woman, and adds that this is a woman with a very long neck, no arms or legs, and six ears.
    -   In _Guards! Guards!_, the description of Where the Dragons Went is "It would put you in mind of a can of sardines, if you thought sardines were huge and scaly and proud and arrogant."
        -   There's another one in _Guards! Guards!_ where the metaphor of the city being like a woman is shot down with 'You mean that she's big and dirty and got a river running through her?'
    -   In _Thud!_ one of the minor characters is Tawnee (real name Betty), a staggeringly beautiful but rather dim exotic dancer "on whom the name Betty stuck like rocks to a ceiling".
-   H. P. Lovecraft played this for horror in "The Festival".
    
    "They were not altogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats, nor decomposed human beings; but something I cannot and must not recall."
    
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ has quite a few of these.
    -   Perhaps the most famous is: "The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't."
    -   Another contender is the description of the Nutri-Matic Drinks Synthesizer's output as "almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea". This might be one of the few rare cases where the dissimile is understandable, since Arthur had asked for tea.
    -   Another example would be Ford Prefect's explanation of the origin of the universe, describing a situation where one would fill a conical ebony bathtub with sand, pull the plug and film the sand falling down the drain, then watching this film in reverse... which, he then states, has nothing at all to do with the origin of the universe, but is really fun to watch. Of course, he was blind-drunk during the telling of this.
-   There's a smeerp-y creature in the _Honor Harrington_ universe called a "Sphinxian Chipmunk." Being from Sphinx we can infer that it has six legs like all of the other native fauna, but other than that the _only_ description given for it is that it _doesn't_ resemble a terrestrial chipmunk.
-   Peg Bracken, _The I Hate to Housekeep Book_:
    
    "Electricity is like flower-arranging. Either you have a feeling for it or you don't. The main difference is that if you make a major mistake with your flower-arranging, you'll just have a mess on your hands. But with electricity, you can end up French fried."
    
-   _InCryptid_: Discussed by Sarah when she's describing Fantastic Fruits and Vegetables from Another Dimension:
    
    "_You_ try explaining what a turnip tastes like to someone who's never tasted one. If you can manage anything better than "like a potato, but maybe sort of sweet," you're a culinary genius. Now imagine the person you're talking to has never had a potato either. You have no common points of reference. I could tell I was eating something close to root vegetables, and some kind of herbs, and some kind of fungus, maybe, along with the large chunks of what could almost have been shrimp, and a piece of what was almost but not entirely like bread."
    
-   _Into The Thickening Fog_: Filippov's seatmate "looked like a forty-year-old Britney Spears who'd gone to bookkeeping school, put on a chunk of weight, and never been in show business".
-   _Jeeves and Wooster_:
    
    "I've found, as a general rule in life, that the things that you think are going to be the scariest nearly always turn out to be not so bad after all; but it wasn't that way with Bingo's tea party."
    
    -   Elsewhere in P. G. Wodehouse:
        
        "It is never difficult to distinguish between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine."
        
-   _The Killing Star_ by Charles Pellegrino and George Zebrowski points out that "There are, of course, a few obvious differences between Central Park and the universe..."
-   A trope Ephraim Kishon was very fond of. Like here:
    
    "'Ephraim, please, leave me alone!' my wife murmured. Except that she wasn't murmuring, but talking quite loudly. In fact, she was shouting."
    
-   _Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography_ is riddled with them.
    
    "Today was a very cold and bitter day, as cold and bitter as a cup of hot chocolate, if the cup of hot chocolate had vinegar added to it and were placed in a refrigerator for several hours."
    
-   In Stephen Fry's first novel, _The Liar_, one character remarks that a good bottle of wine is like a good woman 'apart from the fact it doesn't have arms, legs or breasts. Or can't bear children. In fact a good bottle of wine is nothing like a woman come to think of it'.
    -   Stephen regularly uses variations on this trope. See below under Live Action Television.
-   On the first page of _Men are Better than Women_:
    
    "Women are like Febreze Fabric Refresher, except instead of getting out your toughest odors, they accidentally call their ex-boyfriend drunk and then won't stop crying for the rest of the night."
    
-   Literally <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  everywhere throughout _More Information Than You Require_.
-   Pratchett is very fond of this one. _Nation_ has one man describing a horse thusly:
    
    "Well, you know hogs? ...well, they are not like hogs. But if you took a hog and made it bigger and longer, with a longer nose and a tail, that's a horse. Oh, and much more handsome. And much longer legs."  
    "So a horse is not really like a pig at all?"  
    "Well yes, I suppose so. But it's got the same number of legs."
    
-   _Paradise Lost_ uses this a lot as a way to emphasize how utterly beyond human comprehension the events are.
-   In _The Reckoners Trilogy_ David has a tendency to come up with his own _unique_ comparisons, both in conversation and internal narrative. When he says them out loud people sometimes demand he explain what on earth he's going on about, and they generally have a kind of weird logic to them (he's a "brick made of porridge" because he's putting up a front of being strong, but he's worried that when it comes to it he'll fail, like a brick that looks useable but collapses when place with other bricks, and then the porridge mixes in with the mortar), but ones he mentions internally are left to stand there as a mystery, such as "laser through a pile of sheep".
-   In _Skulduggery Pleasant_, Skulduggery uses one when he first meets Stephanie.
    
    "You know, I met your uncle under similar circumstances. Well, kind of similar. But he was drunk. And we were in a bar. And he had vomited on my shoes. So I suppose the actual circumstances aren't overly similar, but both events include a meeting, so..."
    
-   In _A Dance with Dragons_, the 5th book of _A Song of Ice and Fire_, Tyron Lannister describes his much-despised sister Queen Cersei Lannister to her enemies as being "as gentle as King Maegor" (known justifiably as "The Cruel"), "as selfless as Aegon the Unworthy" (a foolish, cruel, greedy, gluttonous, and lecherous king who was once theorised to be actively _trying_ to be the worst ruler he possibly could), and "as wise as Mad Aerys" (the insane pyromaniac who brought about the fall of his entire dynasty).
-   In _New Moon_:
    
    **Bella:** His voice was like velvet, if velvet can be rough.
    
-   _Words of Radiance_ (second book of _The Stormlight Archive_): Shallan's attempts to describe Pattern often fall flat.
    
    She turned back to Pattern, who had shifted into his hovering form. He looked something like the pattern of splintered light thrown on the wall by a crystal chandelier—except he was made of something black instead of light, and he was three-dimensional. So... Maybe not much like that at all.
    
-   In _Wraith Squadron_, Former Child Star Face Lorran talks about how, after acting in a very successful propagandist holodrama, he was taken to meet the Emperor, but the Emperor wasn't available, so he was instead taken to meet Madame Director Ysanne Isard, who sat him in her lap and told him what a good boy he was. He said it was
    
    "Something like being stroked by a poisonous reptile wearing a human suit, only not quite so comforting."

-   _Australia You're Standing In It_: Two Aussie outback-types struggle to complete a simile for "dry as a...". One suggests "glass of water". He gets a look of disbelief from his mate, and amends it to "an empty glass".
-   _Band of Brothers_ does this in second to last episode, "Why we fight", while the men are on patrol in the woods.
    
    **Frank Perconte:** Hey, George.  
    **George Luz:** Yeah?  
    **Frank Perconte:** This kind of remind you of Bastogne?  
    \[comedic pause, including bemused look\]  
    **George Luz:** Yeah... now that you mention it. Except, of course, there's no snow, we got warm grub in our bellies, and the trees aren't _**fucking exploding**_ from Kraut artillery, but yeah... Frank... other than that, it's a lot like Bastogne.  
    **Frank Perconte:** Right?  
    **George Luz:** Bull, smack him for me please?  
    \[thump\]  
    **George Luz:** Thank you.
    
-   On the premiere of _Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown_, Bobby Flay sums up Tiffani Faison and Jet Tila's round (and by proxy the event as a whole) thusly:
    
    **Bobby Flay:** This is kind of like a holiday family gathering, except you have to compete for your dinner.
    
-   In Season 3 of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ Xander talks tacks about selling chocolate to support for the school's band, but loses focus as Willow's foot creeps up his shin.
    
    **Xander:** The band. Yeah. They're great. They march.  
    **Willow:** Like an army. \[beat\] Except with music instead of bullets, and... usually no one dies.
    
-   Nathan Fillion describes _Castle_:
    
    "I often say that _Castle_ is _Moonlighting_ meets _Murder, She Wrote_ having not really remembered _Moonlighting_ and never having actually seen _Murder She Wrote_."
    
-   _Charlie Brooker's Gameswipe_ describes _Sonic the Hedgehog_ as "rolling at high speed through a jolly cartoon world just like real hedgehogs don't".
-   _Cheers_: Sam's extended metaphor on how Carla sleeping with Hill hurts him works relatively fine up until the last hurdle.
    
    **Sam:** Well, the way I see it, uh... you let down the whole team. It's like, you know, the bottom of the ninth. One out, runner on first, you're up at bat. The coach tells you to bunt. The team expects you to bunt, the runner on first expects you to bunt, fans expect you to bunt. But instead of bunting... _**YOU SLEEP WITH JOHN! ALLEN! HILL!**_
    
-   This conversation from _Le cœur a ses raisons_ :
    
    **Crystale**: I once had a terrible experience when saying "Allô"<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> . I once said "allô" and spend the subsequent ten years in a brothel in Calcutta.
    
    **Brad**: Oooh, the same thing happened to me.
    
    **Crystale**: Oh?
    
    **Brad**: Yes. Except it wasn't in a brothel but in a supermarket, it wasn't in Calcutta but on the other side of the street and it wasn't me it was another person. But the rest was the same.
    
-   On _The Colbert Report_, curling is described to be like horseshoes, but your horse died and you're trying to get over your sorrow by playing curling.
-   _Corner Gas_: When Wanda is rejected for a credit card after being told she was pre-approved, Hank attempts to console her.
    
    **Hank:** It's okay, Wanda. I got one of those "pre-approved" letters in the mail too.  
    **Wanda:** And they rejected you too?  
    **Hank:** No, they gave me a credit card. But other than that, same sad story.
    
-   In _Criminal Minds_ episode "Neon Terror", the team looks into a suspect and Garcia confirms he isn't their UnSub:
    
    **Garcia:** Aside from being slightly morally repugnant, he's clean as a whistle. If that whistle was slightly morally repugnant.
    
-   _The Daily Show_:
    -   When news companies were discussing the BP oil spill, one newscaster described the plan to fix it something like "it's like conducting open-heart surgery, but underwater, in the dark, with submarines".
    -   Senior British Correspondent John Oliver became quite upset with grassroots movements comparing their struggle against the government to that of the Colonial Revolutionaries against the British Empire. After all, the British had been real bastards at the time; by comparison, the modern American government were a bunch of pansies.
    -   Lewis Black compared Glenn Beck's constant comparisons of people/things he doesn't like to Hitler and Nazi Germany to the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon". Except there's only one degree and Kevin Bacon is Hitler.
    -   Jon Stewart, by way of explaining the Jimmy Savile/BBC scandal to American viewers, noted that he hosted _Jim'll Fix It_, a show where he granted children's wishes. Savile was "like Santa Claus, only real, and a pedophile. So basically, nothing like Santa Claus."
-   _Dexter_ - After having spent the evening planning a murder with his new sidekick:
    
    \[Narrating\] "I feel like I am dropping off my prom date. Except this is my house and my wife is dead and I have no idea where Lumen fits into my world. And this is all so weird... _exactly_ like my prom."
    
-   _Doctor Who_: This happens to the Doctor a lot, usually when trying to convey concepts far beyond their companions' understanding.
    -   The BBC's original introduction to "The Next Doctor" asked viewers to think of the perfect Victorian Christmas... but with Cybermen.
    -   "The End of Time": When the Doctor attempts to explain the nature of a Time Lock:
        
        **The Doctor:** They're sealed inside of a bubble. It's not a bubble, but just think of a bubble.
        
    -   The Eleventh Doctor, in particular, is prone to this, along with sister trope Metaphorgotten:
        -   "The Time of Angels":
            
            **River:** A needle in a haystack.  
            **The Doctor:** A needle that looks like hay. A hay-like needle of death. A hay-like needle of death in a haystack of, ah, statues. No, yours was fine.
            
        -   "The Vampires of Venice":
            
            "You're like Houdini, only five slightly scary girls. And he was shorter. Will be shorter. I'm rambling."
            
        -   In "The Pandorica Opens" while explaining what the Cybermen do to people. "It's just like being an organ donor, except you're alive and sort of...screaming."
        -   In "A Christmas Carol", when trying to convince Young Kazran that he's an appropriate "babysitter":
            
            **The Doctor:** Have you ever seen _Mary Poppins_?  
            **Young Kazran:** No...  
            **The Doctor:** Good. Because that comparison would have been _rubbish._
            
        -   And again in the 2011 Comic Relief short "Space".
            
            **The Doctor:** Yeah, it's fine, we're just entering conceptual space. Imagine a banana, or anything curved; actually don't, because it's not curved or like a banana. Forget the banana!
            
        -   Twice in "The Curse of the Black Spot": While trying to describe the monster of the week, and explaining how the spaceship and the pirate ship can be in the same place.
            
            **Pirate:** Like a shark, a shark can smell blood.  
            **The Doctor:** Okay, just like a shark. In a dress. Singing. In green! A green, singing shark in a evening gown!
            
            **The Doctor:** A space ship, trapped in a temporal rift.  
            **Amy:** How can two ships be in the same place?  
            **The Doctor:** Not the same. Two planes; two worlds. Two cars parked in the same space. There are a lot of different universes, nested inside each other. Now and again they collide, and you can step through from one to the other.  
            **Amy:** Okay, I think I can understand.  
            **The Doctor:** Good, because it isn't like that at all — but if it helps...
            
        -   By "The Doctor's Wife", he's stopped even feeling bad about it.
            
            **Rory:** How can we be _outside_ the universe? The universe is everything.  
            **The Doctor:** Imagine a great big soap bubble, with one of those tiny little bubbles on the outside.  
            **Rory:** Okay.  
            **The Doctor:** Well, it's nothing like that.
            
        -   He actually manages to exploit the trope in "Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS".
        -   Let's face it, it's Eleven's new catchphrase.
        -   In the Eleventh Doctor novel _Touched by an Angel_, the Doctor says the Weeping Angels are attracted to Mark like a moth to a flame, and is then shocked to realise that this makes sense. "My analogies _never_ make sense! I must write it down. Rory, write it down for me!"
    -   "The Woman Who Fell to Earth": The Doctor describes the sonic screwdriver:
        
        "It's a Swiss Army knife... only without the knife. Only idiots carry knives."
        
-   Alexei Sayle's _Drive_, a series made by a comedian to promote safe driving, includes an explanation of how it's often hard to realise how fast you're driving because cars are so comfortable these days, more like your lounge than a car, except smaller and without a television and you can't get up to make a drink and the decor's not as nice and can I stop now this is a shit comparison.
-   From _Firefly_:
    
    **Simon:** _\[to Jayne\]_ You're like a trained ape. Without the training.
    
-   In _Friends_:
    -   Chandler describes Joey's latest date:
        
        **Chandler:** You remember Kathy Bates in _Misery_?  
        **Monica and Rachel:** Yeah...  
        **Chandler:** Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
        
    -   When Ross is talking about how messy his date's apartment was: "You know how at the end of the day, you throw your jacket on a chair? Well, instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time itself and garbage is all that has survived."
-   In a Sammy J and Randy skit from _Good News World_, in which the duo have just discovered gold down their home-made mine shaft, we get this exchange:
    
    **Sammy J:** I always dreamed of this moment!  
    **Randy:** Really? This exact moment?  
    **Sammy J:** Yeah! Except, in my dream, you're Livinia Nixon, and we're making love, and we're not down a mine.
    
-   In the first episode of _How I Met Your Mother_, Ted chickens out of dating a local news reporter. Then, when he sees her reporting on a guy who was about to jump off a building, but also chickened out, Ted gets his courage back and says:
    
    **Ted:** I'm going to do what that guy was too scared to do and take the plunge! Okay, it's not a perfect metaphor, because for me taking the plunge means getting married and having kids, while for him it's ... death.  
    **Barney:** Actually, it's a perfect metaphor.
    
-   On _I Love Lucy_, the way Ethel described poker to Lucy: "It's a lot like hearts, only you bet, and there isn't any old maid."
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ is also fond of these, usually something to the effect of: "Many people compare this scene to the chariot race in _Ben-Hur_. They'll say, _'Ben Hur_ was a great film. This film totally sucks.'"
    -   In _Track of the Moon Beast_, we get the following delightful example while watching the local law enforcement:
        
        **Tom Servo:** _\[in '70s TV promo voice\]_ He's a cop. He's a rabbi. They're cops! Except for the rabbi.
        
    -   When one movie shows the hero being tailed by a private helicopter.
        
        **Crow:** It's one of those UN black helicopters, except... white and orange.
        
-   _MythBusters_ has a couple quotes, usually done for humor:
    
    **Grant Imahara:** It's like sewing on a button, except this button is tongue-shaped and made out of meat.  
    **Jamie Hyneman:** It's kind of like watching the grass grow, except there's an explosion at the end of it.
    
-   A minor running gag in _QI_: sometimes when Stephen Fry goes off on a tangent, he'll end the tangent by using a word to describe something.
    
    **Stephen:** Welcome to _QI_, the closest modern equivalent to lions versus Christians.  
    **Stephen:** I love the way your mind works, Alan Davies ... and I use the word "works" quite wrongly.  
    **Stephen:** (in response to Rory McGrath's Pun) When I said "eye", I meant E-Y-E, and you thought...possibly for comic effect, but if so, disastrously, er, that I was saying "I"...It was one of these laughable misunderstandings, and I use the word "laughable" quite wrongly.
    
-   Philomena Cunk delivers on in _Cunk On Britain_ which actually comes full circle back to the original item:
    
    **Cunk**: In 1953, millions of people watched the Queen being coronationed, on their new televisions. It must have been like watching _The Crown_ on Netflix, but live and actually happenin', like _Britain's Got Talent_, but more serious, like _Game of Thrones_, but set in the real world, and starring Queen Elizabeth, like _The Crown_ again.
    
-   Van, in _Reba_ is excited about he and his now-wife Cheyenne getting to go out with their old high school gang on Friday night.
    
    **Van:** And all the old gang will be there! It'll be just like Friday nights back in sophomore year! Except that we're married...you're pregnant...and everything's different.
    
-   Seinfeld broke up with his girlfriend of the week:
    
    **Jerry:** I tell you... the sex. I was like an animal. I was just completely uninhibited.  
    **George:** It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring!  
    **Jerry:** (Beat) ...It's not like that _at all!_
    
-   On _Skithouse_, when Scod tried to explain Charades to Yon.
    
    **Yon:** It's basically Celebrity Head, right?  
    **Scod:** Yeah, except you know the thing and everyone else doesn't.  
    **Yon:** Rock Paper Scissors?  
    **Scod:** Okay, Yon. Like Rock Paper Scissors except there's no rock, no paper and instead of scissors there's this whole new game called Charades.
    
-   _Space Cases_: In the Personality Swap episode, android!Suzee says, "Don't worry. Inside, I am still the same Suzee... except, extremely different."
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, explaining darts to Worf (who would commonly play poker during his time on the Enterprise). "It's like poker, with pointed tips."
-   On _That '70s Show_, Eric accidentally ran over Donna's cat and didn't tell her right away, on the same episode Jackie found out Kelso was cheating on her with Laurie. Donna thought Eric's deception was as bad as Kelso's, Jackie was quick to point out that it wasn't.
    
    **Jackie:** Until goody goody Eric cheats on you with your stupid dead cat, I suggest you shut up.
    
-   From _The Thick of It_:
    
    **Malcolm Tucker:** I'm going to need you to make like a tree and go fuck yourselves.
    
-   Jeremy Clarkson has been known to use them on _Top Gear_.
    
    **Clarkson:** Unfortunately, James May couldn't be here today, so we've found someone who looks exactly like him... except in every single detail.
    
-   Half-used, half-subverted on _The West Wing_ when Donna opines that "a dry wit, like a fine martini, is best enjoyed..." and then realizes she's got nothing.
    -   Another time Josh asked therapist Stanley Keyworth why his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder worked the way it did (music, inexplicably, made him relive getting shot).
        
        **Stanley:** Well, I'll tell you, but it's gonna sound like I'm saying two plus two equals a bushel of potatoes...
        
    -   In one episode Josh claims the scene he, Sam and Toby are currently in is similar to the one in _The Godfather_ when Michael first proposes that he kill Sollozzo and McCluskey: "It's a lot like that scene, only not really." Then a minute later he decides it _is_ like that scene after all. Nobody else really cares.

    Music 

-   _Mitch Benn is the 37th Beatle_ opens with Mitch explaining to younger members of the audience who The Beatles actually were:
    
    There was a band once called the Beatles,  
    In the nineteen-sixties, long ago.  
    They were a bit like One Direction,  
    Except they played instruments and they wrote their own songs,  
    And had amazing ideas, and weren't just vacuous gonks,  
    With immaculate teeth and ridiculous hair,  
    And were immeasurably better on every conceivable level.
    
-   Musician-comedian Bill Bailey's jokes often turn out this way. For example, in "Tinselworm", he mentions his meteoric rise to fame over the past 22 years, "... if that meteor was being dragged by an elderly arthritic donkey across the Mojave Desert."
-   Comedian Bo Burnham's song "Men & Women" contains gems like "Women are like puzzles, because prior to 1920 neither had the right to vote. Puzzles still don't." He also had this line in "Love Is...":
    
    _Love is real-life porn, minus all the stuff that makes porn cool._
    
-   "Factually Accurate Love Song" by Flat 29 has many examples of this, starting with "Girl your eyes shine like the moon. Well like two moons specifically, positioned unnaturally close together, but without the gravitational and tidal problems that would occur if this was not a simile."
-   The Flight of the Conchords song, "Pencils in the Wind" is about how love is like a roll of tape, which actually starts out sensically, then gets... less so.
-   Menomena's song "Tithe": "Spending the best years of a childhood/Horizontal on the floor/Like a bobsled minus the teamwork/And the televised support."
-   The Midnight Beast's song "Ninjas": "And my hands are like samurai swords, except not metal, so nothing like swords- they're just hands!"
-   The comedy a cappella group Moosebutter has said about themselves: "Moosebutter is just like a cutting-edge, hard-core hip-hop group, except moosebutter is from Utah, all white, not interested in controversy, and also doesn't perform hip-hop."
-   U2's "Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World" contains the line, "A woman needs a man / Like a fish needs a bicycle".

    New Media 

-   The Cinema Snob counters the description of _Lady Terminator_, which says the movie is 'like _Kill Bill_, but with oodles of sex' with this:
    
    "'Yeah, it's just like _Kill Bill_. If _Kill Bill_ was a 1984 James Cameron film called _The Terminator_. And who uses the word oodles?'"
    
-   From _Cracked.com_:
-   On his LiveJournal, obscure author Gideon Defoe (_The Pirates!_ series) came up with this one:
    
    "Kennington can seem vaguely post-apocalyptic at the best of times, but with all the lights out it's like a proper 1980's BBC2 dystopia. But with hoodies instead of triffids. Hoodies don't make that sinister 'tap tap tap' noise, and they have mace instead of the poison stinger thing, so the analogy breaks down there, but otherwise it's exactly the same."
    
-   _The Nostalgia Critic_:
    -   In his _Top 11 Nostalgic Shows_ countdown, he says the _Ghostbusters_ were like firefighters, "except instead of putting out fires, you were chasing ghosts."
    -   Or in his review of _Drop Dead Fred_ concerning the titular character's performance:
        
        "You know, there is a thin line between _funny_ and _god-awfully horrendous_. Luckily, he comes nowhere near that line, he is just _god-awfully horrendous_."
        
-   This notice from Tlf Travel Alerts:
    
    "Minor delays on the Jubilee line due to track failure at Southwark. And by 'track failure' we mean 'wolves'."
    
-   The most popular definition Play-Doh on Urban Dictionary. "The second coolest thing in the world. Just like fire except it's not hot. And you can squeeze it in your hands. And it comes in multiple colors. And it smells like shit. And unlike fire it can't burn down houses and forests. Come to think of it, its not really like fire at all....Shit." There used to be a corresponding entry for "fire", but it seems to have vanished into the ether.

    Radio 

-   In one Interview Sketch on _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme_, Patsy Straightwoman is interviewing Professor Craven, a scientist who has no idea how to simplify his ideas for a lay audience. When she prompts him that sometimes scientists use analogies, we get this:
    
    **Craven**: The universe is like ... an orange.  
    **Straightwoman**: Is it?  
    **Craven**: ...Yes?  
    **Straightwoman**: In what way?  
    **Craven**: They both ... exist? No, hang on, we're talking about a notional orange, aren't we? So, um, no, there's no point of similarity at all.  
    **Straightwoman**: Right. So, the universe is utterly unlike an imaginary orange?  
    **Craven**: So far as we know.
    
    -   One end-of-episode tag has Margaret Caborn-Smith close it off by saying "John Finnemore will return, like _James Bond_... except in every possible way."
-   Inverted by David Quantick on _The Now Show_, when he has to admit the simile is _closer_ than he initially indicated:

    Stand Up Comedy 

-   Larry the Cable Guy gives us this one: "I met this gal a while back, looked like Shania Twain. Only a little shorter, and, uh, the face was different. I was drunk, it looked like Shania Twain. Next morning, _Mark Twain_!"
    -   As he's about to play something on his guitar: "You know that song 'Amarillo by Morning' by George Strait? Well this here don't sound anywhere close to that song!"
-   The Pete and Brian sketch "Knock Knock" combines this trope with Bread, Eggs, Milk, Squick in a classic "Priest, Rabbi and Shaman walk into a bar" joke that somehow turns it into being about how someone's Dad molested them within the space of a few sentences.
    
    "A priest, a rabbi, and a shaman walk into a bar!  
    But there's no rabbi and no shaman _\*laughs\*_ and it's actually my eighth birthday and the priest is molesting me.  
    And the priest is my dad and he's not a priest.  
    ...  
    My dad molested me...a lot."

-   _Broken Legs_' description of the mousy kid in the waiting room, in part:
    
    Let's tell a story. Because people like this are only in stories. So once there was a princess of some kind. Not the annoying five-year-old brat kind, the chained-up-in-a-tower kind. The kind who gets her hair all ratty and her dress all torn and tossed into brambles or something. Now imagine that instead of a princess you have a stage kid and instead of a tower you've got Bridger. And that she's not the main character because that's you, Lottie. Then you'll have this girl.

-   From a section of Cortex's monologue to Crash in _Crash Twinsanity_:
    
    **Cortex:** Three years I spent alone in the frozen Antarctic wastes! _And I missed you!_ And so, I've organized a little gathering; like a birthday party, except... the exact opposite!
    
-   The instructions for _Crystal Crazy_ describe black holes as: "Rifts in the space-time continuum that instantly transport you from one place to another. Actually the time bit isn't really correct. Neither is the continuum bit. Or the rift. But it sounded good."
-   _Dwarf Fortress_: "Like chess, only with short people that can catch on fire like rags soaked in tar, and lots of booze."
-   The following conversation in _Dragon Age II_:
    
    **Merrill:** You remind me of Hahren Paival, Varric. Only younger. And shorter. And not as serious.  
    **Varric:** So it's a close resemblance, then.
    
    -   Merrill's good at these. She comments that Anders's coat (with its odd fur pauldron) is "cheerful, like a crow in anting." He replies "Thank you...?" and the player is just as puzzled as he is about whether she meant it sarcastically or as a genuine compliment.
-   _Gex 3_: "This city's a jungle, but a square one with no plants!"
-   In _Kerbal Space Program_, the description for Eve (a planet similar to Venus) goes like this:
    
    "It is considered by some to be almost a sister planet to Kerbin. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme pressures and temperatures. Actually, it’s not very similar at all is it? Who are those people?"
    
-   _Kingdom of Loathing_:
    -   In the description for the Queen Filthworm:
        
        "Have you ever been out in a rose garden on a nice spring day, wearing clothes fresh from the dryer and really expensive cologne, and then you walk under a window ledge with a freshly baked apple pie cooling on it? Well, her smell is the exact opposite of that."
        
    -   And from the description of sangria:
        
        "This is sangria. It's like blood, except instead of plasma it has wine, and instead of blood cells it has bits of cherry. But other than that, it's exactly like blood."
        
    -   And the description for a ring setting combines this with Waxing Lyrical:
        
        "This is a ring without a jewel. It's like eyes without a face, but instead of eyes, it's a ring, and instead of a face, it's a jewel."
        
    -   And this, from the effect _soul freeze_:
        
        "You've got a frozen soul. This is like when you get a headache from eating too much ice cream, only instead of a headache, your soul is frozen, and there isn't really any ice cream involved, either, now that I think about it."
        
    -   And when you consume Crystal skeleton vodka, you get this:
        
        "You hang the skeleton from the ceiling and kiss it like it's Spider-Man, you're Mary Jane, and instead of kissing her, Spider-Man vomited an entire skeleton's worth of vodka into Mary Jane's mouth."
        
    -   One of the Slime's attacks is described thusly:
        
        "The Slime oozes across your face. It's like being licked by a puppy, only painful and disgusting."
        
-   In _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_, HK-47 tries to elucidate his consternation at the existence of his evil(er) knock-offs by comparing his situation to that of the Exile. The result is a cross between this and Metaphorgotten, and, as might be expected, it's hilarious. He draws a number of other comparisons between his vocation of assassination and the practices of various factions in the game; whether you find these similarities convincing will depend largely on whether you share the game's own cynicism about the _Star Wars_ universe and its heroes.
-   In _Lost Pig_, Grunk the orc describes an underground chamber lit by "mossfuressence":
    
    It bright, just like day time. Except that instead of sun, it wall that glow. And instead of grass and tree, it square room with four wall. And instead of outside, it all under ground. But beside those thing, it just like it!
    
-   _Mass Effect 3_: in the Citadel DLC, Wrex informs us that krogan dancing involves more headbutts. And blood. And no actual dancing. So basically, it's just like every other krogan hobby.
-   _Mass Effect: Andromeda:_ At one point when Ryder reactivates some technology, which naturally also reactivates the local trigger-happy security drones, they're informed by Suvi that everything's "lit up like Mardi Gras". Teammate Peebee angrily retorts thus:
    
    **Peebee:** Yeah, just like Mardi Gras, except with no jazz and more _death!_
    
-   Misha from _Mercenaries 2_ has this to say about dropping guided bombs:
    
    **Misha:** Is like putting thread through hole in needle, except thread is BOMB.
    
-   In _Midtown Madness 3_, each loading screen shows the race map and a caption. One caption says "It's like a square, only it's not."
-   Eggman's P.A messages in _Sonic Colors_ are full of these whenever he tells visitors to enjoy something that's complimentary.
    
    "...And by complimentary, I mean very expensive."
    
-   Anebriate's answer to people who ask him what it's like being the "greatest warrior in the universe" in _Tales of the Drunken Paladin_:
    
    **Anebriate:** Well, it's kinda like being the juiciest red apple in a trash can full of flies. Except instead of flies, it's hot babes. And instead of being an apple, I'm a ripped warrior.
    
-   According to the official website, the roguelike First-Person Shooter _Tower of Guns_ is "like _The Binding of Isaac_, only less dead babies. Also, it's an FPS... maybe it's not like _Binding of Isaac_."
-   Sans explains _Undertale_'s blue attacks, which are dodged by remaining motionless, by telling you that when you see a stop sign you stop, and since stop signs are red, you should imagine a blue stop sign.
-   _Whiplash_, a game featuring you playing as a weasel chained to a rabbit whom you use as a mace despite his pained protests occasionally has the rabbit moan "Hey, this is just like water skiing. Except it's on concrete, I'm flat on my back and it's REALLY PAINFUL".

    Web Animation

-   _Zero Punctuation_: Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw likes to litter these around every once in a while, such as in his opening phrase for his review on _The Witcher_:
    
    _"What would you get if you took the corpse of J. R. R. Tolkien, ground it into a fine powder and snorted it off the doughy breasts of a prostitute suffering from Tourette's syndrome? Well, first you'd get a throatful of dead writer, then the police will probably want to talk to you, and you'll no doubt make an enemy of_ Mrs. _Tolkien. What you probably_ won't _get is_ The Witcher_, because it's a video game and more easily acquired from your local electronics retailer, you idiot."_
    
    -   His review of _Rise of the Triad_ actually had a dissimile which, in a bit of a Mind Screw fashion, still managed to serve as a perfectly cogent simile: "Like a man with both hands trapped in a gumball machine, (the game) was absolutely fuck-all to do with triads".
    -   From his review of _Army of Two_: "you get to wear funky skull masks like it's Halloween every day, except that it's you giving out the candy, and the candy is _bullets."_
    -   His review of _Batman: Arkham City_ when describing Catwoman's abilities: "Mainly she plays like Batman making use of a few pole dancing lessons in her own combat and stealth sections, although she can cling to ceilings as well, just like real cat (that's been bitten by a radioactive spider)."

    **Frans Rayner:** Why are you looking at me like that?  
    **Gordito:** You killed a lot of ninjas in the 80's, so now you've made a bunch more to kill. Your maniacal laughing is like a fat man who's just restocked his freezer with Hot Pockets.  
    **Frans Rayner:** Ooh, no no. I'm laughing like a fat man who is nearing the final steps of his lifelong journey to power. And he's actually in really good shape and not fat at all.

And it wasn’t a dog it was me playing both sides of a single checkers board because I had no one to play with, but I had a plush dog there with me. Okay, it was actually a cat. And it wasn’t checkers, it was my breakfast... I had pancakes."
    
-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_. After introducing a large artificial habitat room, containing a grassy field with a large cherry tree, the author notes below the page:
    
    **Tom Siddell:** My school had one of these. No wait, they had a bike rack.
    
-   In _Homestuck_, Karkat, being an alien, has very little idea of human units of time:
    
    **Karkat:** WAIT, HOW LONG ARE YEARS SUPPOSED TO BE AGAIN?  
    **Karkat:** WAS IT LIKE TWO WEEKS OR SOMETHING?  
    **Rose:** Yes, two.  
    **Rose:** And then fifty more.

    -   Two in the same strip, in fact.
        
        "I'm making wheatloaf. It's like meatloaf, only with wheat."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    
    **Reverend Theo Fobius:** What a coincidence. That's almost exactly what I didn't have in mind.
    
    -   As well as:
        
        **Schlock:** If by 'hair' you mean 'plasma', and 'dryer' you mean 'cannon', then yes. Yes, it is.
        
    -   And for the hat trick (amidst many, _many_ others):
        
        **Morokweng:** Ah. Will it be falling to me to sweep this under the rug, Ma'am?  
        **Admiral Emm:** Word choice, 'Kweng. Replace "sweep" with "compress," "under" with "into," and give me "neutronium" in place of that ratty old "rug."
        
    -   Running Gag, essentially.
        
        **Kevyn:** We're practically home free, everybody.  
        **Brad:** Ummm... Yeah. If by "home" you mean "out of." And by "free" you mean "fuel."
        
    -   Even the Lemony Narrator gets in on it in this strip.
        
        "In order to follow what Petey is doing, it's useful to employ a metaphor.  
        Imagine the smartest person you know...  
        Now imagine that person in a real-time voice, video, and hypertext conference with over a thousand other people who are very nearly as smart.  
        The absolute dearth of productivity that you are now imagining springing from this kind of meeting is not what Petey gets. Tomorrow: The cartoonist comes up with a better metaphor."
        
-   Monette's Thanksgiving grace in _Something\*Positive_: "Please watch over us the next year and let us form long-lasting friendships like the one shared between the pilgrims and the Indians. But without the smallpox and eventual betrayal."
-   From _String Theory (2009)_, a talking cat compares his new owner to his prior one:
    
    **Marcus:** Plus, you sorta remind me of the doc! You know, if he was a girl and didn't have a bunch of bad habits. Also, you're like, way more mentally stable. I bet your mom never pushed you down the stairs on purpose, huh?
    
-   According to _Toothpaste For Dinner_, Kids are like dogs. "A dog that says it hates macaroni four minutes after asking for macaroni."

    -   Also done in his review on _Twilight_

-   From Cracked's "The 6 Most Horrifying Ways Anyone Ever Got Rich":
    
    "Well, it wasn't really a 'hotel,' except in the sense the Hotel California was a hotel. You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave. Except you can't check out. Because you're dead. Or slowly suffocating in an airtight vault, or being stretched on a rack in the basement that Holmes used to see how far the human body could stretch (Answer: not that far)."

-   In 'Let's Drown Out Hexen: Beyond Heretic', Yahtzee and Gabriel noticed that the teleporter was different from their previous playthrough, which they were slightly amazed on that.

    **Others Present:** ...

    **Baldurk:** That bad?  
    **Vicas:** He's less intrusive.  
    **Slowbeef:** Oh, yeah, much less. This is like the second time I've seen him the whole game.

    -   "That's Kaiba's Duel Dome! You know, in my day, we didn't have Duel Domes. We had to play our card games out on the street. And our cards weren't even real cards! They were just rocks that we picked up off the ground. And then we threw them at each other! Come to think of it, it wasn't really card games at all. We just liked to throw rocks at each other—mostly at me. That's probably why I have so much self-loathing. (_beat_) Anyway, we should probably go over there."

        **Lois:** How is that?  
        **Peter:** How is what?  
        **Lois:** How is it anything like a monkey having the keys to an amusement park?  
        **Peter:** I don't know, the hours would be erratic; maintenance would probably suffer to some degree; the prizes for games of chance would all be bananas.
