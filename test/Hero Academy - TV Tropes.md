Many fictional worlds show a hero working his way to fight and stop some great evil. Sometimes they're princes or knights fighting to save a damsel in distress, maybe they're mercenaries fighting evil for a paycheck or a regular person relying strictly on his wits and luck. Either way, they were defined as heroes on their respective stories.

But what if being a hero alone is to be considered a job?

Hero Academy refers to a organization, or part of an organization, that trains people to develop the skills and knowledge, combat-related or otherwise, needed to be able to do heroic deeds. Unlike Superhero School, it usually trains regular people with little to no superpowers and teaches their students the skills they need rather than picking out students that already have extraordinary abilities, though they may pick out individuals that they believe show potential.

It is a subtrope of Extranormal Institute: one thing a Hero Academy has in common with Superhero School and Wizarding School that may separate it from Military School or Military Academy is that they function as a society as much as a training program. Compare Adventure Guild, which can be a faction that focuses more on having individuals go on quests than on tutoring students how to successfully go through them. The Evil Counterpart is the Academy of Evil.

Not to be confused with the similarly-named _My Hero Academia_ or _Hero Elementary_.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Garderobe in some incarnations of _My-Otome_ functions as this. Healthy, normal young girls are brought in to be educated in both etiquette and combat skills so that they may serve their patrons or nations as one woman armies. The latter part is due to technology rather than any inborn superpowers.
-   No points for guessing what _My Hero Academia_ is about. The series focuses on U.A., one of many such academies in the setting. While it acts as a Superhero School for those aspiring to be pro heroes, it also has General Education, Hero Support (the people who design heroes' gadgets), and Management courses taught so that non-pros can effectively navigate the setting post-graduation.
-   _Pretty Cure All Stars New Stage 2_ introduced the Fairy Academy, which trained fairies for the opportunity to be mascots to future Pretty Cure.
-   Palaestra in _Saint Seiya Omega_, which makes the training of Saints more formalized than in the original series where training is done on master-disciple basis.
-   Death Weapon Meister Academy (or DWMA for short) in _Soul Eater_ could be considered this, as they teach and train relatively normal children to become effective 'meisters' and 'weapons'. (The weapon children are naturally born with the ability to transform, but it's a trait common enough in the world to not be considered a 'super power'.) In the spinoff _Soul Eater Not!_ it is stated that DWMA is recognized as a school that produces heroes of the world and its graduates are respected by society.
-   _Tiger & Bunny_, being a show about _corporate_ superheroes, has one of these. Not all students have gifts that are suitable for hero-ing, however.

    Fan Works 

-   Beacon in _Forged Destiny_, as opposed to the one in _RWBY_ which is just an Extranormal Institute, acts as this. It and its counterparts in the other kingdoms train members of the Hero Caste to become Heroes capable of defending mankind against the forces of Grimm. Dropouts are regulated to the Soldier Caste, a group that is loyal to the kingdoms themselves rather than to mankind itself.

    Literature 

-   The Assassins' Guild School in the _Discworld_ teaches its pupils to do some pretty extraordinary things - at the price of what is reputed to be a very high drop-out rate...
-   In _Doom Valley Prep School_, The School of Righteousness And Honor is a sister school to the openly evil Doom Valley Prep School, and the #1 school in the world. it teaches students how to be good wizards, paladins, and presumably benevolent politicians among other things. They frequently pit their students against each other in pass or die tests.
-   The Stone Prince in _Enchanted Forest Chronicles_ went to one of these.
-   _GameWorld_: The Hero School used to train adventurers and knights, now it trains politicians and accountants (aka, the people who actually run the world nowadays).
-   The Collegium in the _Heralds of Valdemar_ series, at least for Herald-trainees. Students in other disciplines train there too, but for Heralds this is where they learn to master their Gifts (magical or psychic powers) and is the one place they can really call home.
-   The Institutes of _The Mortal Instruments_ and _The Infernal Devices_ teaches and trains its students to become Shadowhunters, the warriors who protect mundanes and keep them blissfully unaware of the Shadow World.
-   _PJ Masks_: The book "L'école des Pyjamasques" focuses on a school for superpowered kis, run by the hero Energuman. Besides the Pyjamasques, the school is attended by the Mascrapules, Lilifée and Tatouro (the book counterpart of Armadylan).
-   The eponymous _World Express_ is such a school located on a Train that constantly moves around the world. While it does teach some Magi Tech, it's primary goal is to teach its pupils how to change the world for the better. Disciplines include self-confidence, rhetoric and unarmed combat.
-   _Heretical Edge_: Crossroads Academy, which trains young adults to become the aforementioned "Heretics". Rival school Eden's Garden is portrayed as more of an _Anti_hero Academy. Turns out that their senior leadership teams are both full of people who are a very long way from being any kind of hero at all.

    Video Games 

-   _Fable_ shows an academy called the Hero's Guild, as in the Fable Universe, Heroes gifted human beings that carry potential of carrying amazing combat skills with Melee, Ranged, and Magic abilities. Fully-trained Heroes in the Fable universe usually show extremely impressive skills in the area of combat they specialize.
-   The _Valthirian Arc_ series, consisting of _Valthirian Arc 1_, _Valthirian Arc 2_ and _Valthirian Arc Hero School Story_, is about running Hero Academies.

    Web Animation 

-   The current version of _True Tail_ is set in True Tail Academy, which is ran by veteran heroes who train students to become the next generation of heroes.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Codename: Kids Next Door_, when kids want to become Kids Next Door Operatives, they have to sign up for the KND Cadet Academy for training and studying on being a KND Operative. What separates it from a Military Academy is that, though KND is modeled as a military organization, as explained on the description above, it's as much of a society as it is a military group, which cause it to fit more into the Hero Academy trope. Their goal is also "combat evil adults".
