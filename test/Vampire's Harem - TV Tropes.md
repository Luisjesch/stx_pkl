Things to do when you're dead.

_"He was beautiful, magnificent, like an archangel. I was mesmerized, but I knew that couldn't be right. I mean, I'm a full blown fucking dyke, and here I was drooling over this... Man. I couldn't help myself, because I wasn't really me. I was a slave. I was one of his brides, there to serve his every depravity, and it was like that for decades. It was like being trapped inside myself; I was aware of who I was, who I used to be, and I could do nothing about it."_

It's very common in fiction for vampire lords to target and seduce women (and it seems always women) and recruit them into the ranks of the undead. Whether to ease loneliness or attraction, these women are treated as the vampire's consorts, his brides. Typically, he is accompanied by more than one, often three at the very least, and The Heroine is the one most subject to his attention in the story. The brides nearly always have completely identical personalities and are interchangeable except perhaps for hair color and the like. If a human woman is turned and added to the harem, she inevitably loses her original personality and becomes just like the other brides.

This trope traces its origin back to Bram Stoker's novel _Dracula_, referring to a trio of female vampires that live alongside Dracula in his castle and are popularly referred to as his "brides", even though this was never explicitly confirmed. That didn't stop them from being used this way in fiction; Victorian-era vampires were used as allegories of sexual impurity and deviancy. Which, nowadays, can be seen as more awesome than horrific after decades of Values Dissonance. While the male vampire/female victim pairing is the most common form of this trope due to being based on _Dracula_, gender-inverted or same-sex variants do occur, they are just rarer. (Hence, the gender neutral name instead of being "Vampire _Bride_").

Subtrope to Immortality Promiscuity. May overlap with Unholy Matrimony should the relationship work out.

Compare with I Have You Now, My Pretty, I Love You, Vampire Son and Vampires Are Sex Gods (which often leads someone joining said harem). Contrast with Romantic Vampire Boy (when a heroine has a consensual relationship with a male vampire). See also Vampire Episode, where this can likely happen as well.

    Literature 

-   _A Dowry of Blood_: Dracula keeps three vampiric spouses that he sired personally. These are two women named Constanta and Magdalena and a young man named Alexei.
-   _Dracula_ is the Trope Codifier, though it's something of an Unbuilt Trope since the three female vampires are merely implied to be his wives, but never outright confirmed. If anything, it's heavily implied they might be blood-related since two of them share the same physical resemblance to him. Of course, this doesn't cancel out the other alternative, since vampirism is used as an metaphor for sexual deviancy in the book.
-   _The Dracula Tape_: The brides are present as it covers the original story and even named (in this case, Melisse, Wanda and Anna. The blonde and brunettes respectively). But, in contrast to Dracula's Adaptational Heroism where he was just looking to move to London and make new friends, here the brides are presented as wholly villainous having let the power go to their heads. Melisse even outright tries an assassination attempt on Dracula near the end of the story. Dracula mentions he doesn't really remember why he turned them (save a vague remembrance of them being kinder back then) and planned to abandon them outright in the castle. At the end of the story he does gain Mina as his mate after letting her live out her normal life and dying of natural causes. The vampirism kicks in after she's buried and regresses her back to when she was younger to which Dracula happily greets her after she rises from her grave. This was a mutual turning by the way.
-   In _The Empire of Fear_ by Brian M. Stableford, vampires live openly (and have ruled most of Europe since the vampire Attila converted Aetius and they established the Twin Empire of Gaul and Wallachia) and the most common configuration is a male vampire leader with an entourage of women he has converted. This is one of the things that leads one of the mortal characters to theorize that the common story of being made a vampire by being bitten is just superstition and that vampirism is actually spread by sexual contact.
-   _Gotrek & Felix_: Ulrika Magdova, Felix's love interest, is turned into a vampire by Adolphus Krieger in _Vampireslayer_ due to expressing interest on her.
-   _Immortals After Dark_: A vampire's beloved is referred to as their Bride. When they finally meet them, they regain the ability to breathe, their hearts beat again and they become even stronger.
-   _Vampiros do Rio Douro_:
    -   Inverno covets Eliana as his "queen and bride" after she accidentally reanimated him with her blood.
    -   Sétimo picks two beautiful young women Paola and Aléxia to be his brides when building his vampire army. They are an villainous version of Betty and Veronica with one seductive and proactive and the other demure and submissive.
-   _Wayward Children_: The Master of the Moors likes to claim pretty young girls, raise them as his "daughters" and compliant victims, and turn them into vampires when they turn eighteen. It's described in very similar terms to a sexually abusive parent. His current daughter, Jill, is desperate to become a vampire, because she's built her life around appeasing him and she doesn't know how to be anything else.
-   In _Straight Outta Fangton_ and the _Morgan Detective Agency_ (both part of the United States Of Monsters series) by C.T. Phipps, vampires are practically _required_ to have harems. This is due to the fact that it is better to drink lightly from humans regularly than drain humans completely if you're trying to live as part of regular society. The Kiss of the Vampire is so sexual (and frequently accompanies sex) that these harems are usually literal. In addition, vampires are described as almost all practicing Polygamy and tend to have multiple marriages to each other.
-   _Overlord 2010_: Shalltear Bloodfallen is accompanied by two female vampires that are explicitly referred to as her brides. She also counts as a rare female example.
-   _Strike the Blood_: A powerful vampire is known as a "Progenitor", and they usually amass enough power to become a sovereign nation unto themselves. In addition to this, it's standard for a Progenitor to gain a number of mates. In the case of our hero, Kojou, even when he shows no interest in doing so, other groups manipulate events to create an Unwanted Harem _for_ him. And, in a Call-Forward via Time Travel, we learn that he's had children with at least more than one of these women.
-   _Vampire Hunter D_: Count Magnus Lee chooses Doris Lang as his new bride in order to stave off boredom, and she enlists the titular protagonist to destroy the vampire and save her from becoming a vampire.
-   _Fledgling_ has a variant: the Ina are a vampiric Human Subspecies that form a symbiotic bond with groups of humans. The Ina gets a blood supply, the humans get prolonged lifespans, and both get a strongly close-knit "family" — albeit one enforced by addictive venom that overrides their usual sexual preferences to be compatible with the Ina.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffyverse_:
    -   In the backstory to _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ and _Angel_, Angelus had Darla, Drusilla, and Spike.
    -   Likewise the actual brides from the novel show up briefly in the episode "Buffy vs Dracula" where they nearly seduce Giles before Riley scares them off.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: Lestat de Lioncourt turned Louis de Pointe du Lac into a vampire specifically to be to be his Eternal Lover. They're crazy about each other, but in a dysfunctional, The Masochism Tango sort of way. Before long, Lestat also has a side chick, Antoinette Brown. He's a proponent of Immortality Promiscuity, saying that an open relationship will help him and Louis stay interested in each other over the long-term. There's no question that Lestat _loves_ Louis more, but a case could be made that he _likes_ Antoinette better — they get along more easily, and they don't constantly fight (although that's because Antoinette is a lot more compliant than Louis; she quickly backs down when she notices Lestat is getting angry, e.g. "I didn't mean to make you mad"). In the Season 1 finale, Lestat talks about upgrading this Bisexual Love Triangle to a more overt harem setup, promoting Antoinette (now a vampire) from The Mistress to his second spouse ("Antoinette will be much more agreeable to our life together") while Louis is his Gender-Inverted Top Wife. Louis loathes Antoinette — he's jealous of her and wants her dead — and he would _never_ accept the idea of having to live under the same roof with her and both having to share Lestat's bed (or coffin). For Louis, this is a far more insufferable arrangement than if she had remained as Lestat's paramour, and it's the final straw in terms of what he's willing to endure (along with years of Domestic Abuse). His outrage at the thought of Antoinette joining their household boosts his determination to kill Lestat.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The _Ravenloft_ setting:
        -   Strahd's obsession with his brother's fiancée Tatyana led him to kill his brother and drive Tatyana to suicide, crimes that caused him to be Cursed with vampirism.

He also has four female and one male consort, and might claim some of the Player Characters as consorts if he likes the look of them.
        -   Elder vampires in 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition can choose to create a "Bride": a free-willed Mindlink Mate. Since a progenitor vampire can only have one Bride (or Groom) at a time, doesn't have the usual mental control over it, and suffers terribly if it dies, it's generally only done out of genuine care for the victim — or some darker obsession.
    -   In the module I2 _Tomb of the Lizard King_, the Lizard King Sakatha is a vampire who has a bride: a female lizardfolk whom he changed into a vampire. She will fight the Player Characters if they enter her room.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade_ and _Vampire: The Requiem_ both have the Herd Background/Merit, which reflects the vampire having a stable of regular individuals to feed upon. Given certain influences, this is often a stable of sex partners, but it could also be a group of blood cultists, the tenants of a hospital ward, or even a literal herd of cattle.

    Video Games 

-   _Castlevania_:
    -   In numerous games, Dracula takes women to make them his brides, some of them Belmonts' fiancées, which motivates them to go after the Lord of Darkness. One exception is Lisa, who becomes Dracula's second wife without being converted and stays with him for love. They have a son called Adrian Tepes (Alucard) and her death would cause his war against humanity as seen in _Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse_, in which even his own son Alucard goes after him (plot expanded with the _Castlevania_ series by Netflix).
    -   Furthermore, the _Dracula_ novel is confirmed as canon in this universe, implying that the three "Brides" in the novel existed.

-   _Resident Evil Village_: Lady Dimitrescu's "daughters", Daniela, Bela, and Cassandra are clear allusions to this even if the household's head vampire is their supposed "mother", not their spouse. Dimitrescu herself is a Gender Flipped version of Dracula, after all.
-   _Suikoden_: After becoming governor of the Lorimar region, the vampire Neclord demands that the people sent him one girl every year to be his bride. The village chief's daughter Tengaar is selected, but the heroes mount a rescue mission to besiege his fortress and save the girl.
    -   It's implied that Viktor's lover Daisy committed suicide rather than become one of his brides.
