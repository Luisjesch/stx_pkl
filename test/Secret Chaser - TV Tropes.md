**Cartman:** Aha! Kenny! I should have known! Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?! Unless you _are_ Mysterion!  
**Stan:** Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.  
**Clyde:** Yeah, so do I.  
**Cartman:** What?! Why?  
**Clyde:** I don't know, it's just a cool costume.

A standard fixture of the Fantastic Comedy: whenever the series concept requires that an extraordinary person Masquerade as ordinary, there is one person around who suspects them, or has already learned about their secret (usually not every little detail, but enough to see them for what they really are). This character is always the Only Sane Man — Clark Kenting, fortunately, still works for everyone else — making this character only look crazy if they try to expose the protagonist.

If the character himself is not convinced that they are just hallucinating — and some of them are — they become set on getting proof to show everyone else that they were right all along — only to fail every time. Sometimes the neighbor fancies herself an Amateur Sleuth, going so far as to spy and snoop whenever visiting the "undercover" character. They may even set traps to expose the character's Masquerade. Usually though they have no idea — or care — about the trouble they are getting themselves into around the protagonist, so typically the hero will need to save them when they get _too_ involved. Some have a perfectly logical (though often villainous) motivation, but other seem not to have considered the question "What would happen if you did expose your neighbor's secret, and would you really benefit from this?"

This character is usually a normal human in the vicinity from their civil life who has noticed that something is odd or amiss with them — a Nosy Neighbor or a Snooping Little Kid. If the masquerading subject is in school, the character is quite likely to be a teacher at that school, or a School Newspaper News Hound. If the show is a Work Com, it can be a co-worker, often a rival or the subject's immediate manager.

Occasionally, the character will have had an obsession with the supernatural _before_ they meet the protagonist. They may be a danger that comes from the outside — Hunter of Monsters, an Inspector Javert or the Intrepid Reporter.

Often there is a character around who could give weight to their claims, an authority to present their proof to who views with bemused indifference their ranting insistence that something is strange about the main character — a husband if the character is the neighbour, the school principal if they are a teacher, a more senior manager in a Work Com. Sometimes a sidekick whom they drag into helping them — usually an underling, such as a school janitor if or an intern — is also present.

Contrast/compare Secret-Keeper and Secret Secret-Keeper; after all, nothing says these characters can't change their mind about a public unveiling should they ever confirm their suspicions. See also Not-So-Imaginary Friend.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ah! My Goddess_: Sayoko noticed how there is something off about Belldandy, and goes to great lengths to uncover her secret. Of course, since Belldandy is a Goddess who Cannot Tell a Lie, she simply tells Sayoko the truth. Sayoko never believes her and continues her schemes.
-   In the Saiyaman Saga of _Dragon Ball Z_, Videl spends several episodes filling this role trying to expose Saiyaman's secret identity.
-   A particularly frustrating example occurs in _Bleach_ with Tatsuki, who spends a good portion of the story fully aware that _something_ supernatural is going on with her two closest friends, but is kept Locked Out of the Loop even when she directly confronts them about it.

    Comic Books 

-   _Fables_ did this twice; once when a reporter thought all the folks of Fabletown were vampires; and planned to "out" them to the world. The second time was with Thorne, later subverted because he's a Fable himself.
-   Ben Urich was this to _Daredevil_, in both the comic and the movie adaptation.
-   _Superman_:
    -   The Silver Age Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen would occasionally act this way around Superman, as would Lana Lang around Superboy.
    -   Played for black comedy in a one-page story in an old Superman comic: Clark is reading a book at the Daily Planet when suddenly Lois Lane falls from a window. He rescues her without changing his clothes as Clark. Then she tells him this was the only way she could make sure Superman was Clark Kent. Next panel we see another reporter talking to Clark, again reading a book:
        
        Clark, have you seen Lois?  
        Yes... she fell out of a window.
        
    -   In the Silver Age, Dick Malverne. He grew up at the Midvale Orphanage during the same time that Kara Zor-El/Linda Lee/Supergirl did, and he was constantly trying to prove she had super-powers. In _Young Love_, he revealed that he always knew Linda was Supergirl, but after a while he decided to keep it a secret.
    -   In _The Girl with the X-Ray Mind_, Dick Malverne becomes convinced that Lena Thorul is Supergirl, and he comes up with an elaborate and ridiculous scheme -revolving around blowing explosives up inside his own home- to "expose" Lena's secret identity.
    -   In _Action Comics #361_, a boy thought Linda Lee was Supergirl, and he pretended to be Kryptonian to goad her into revealing her secret identity.
    -   In _Adventure Comics_, Nasthalthia "Nasty" Luthor — Lex Luthor's evil niece — enrolled at Stanhope University as a student, hoping to lure Supergirl out into the open so her uncle could kill her. Several issues later she is convinced that Linda _is_ Supergirl and follows her to San Francisco, where both begin work as junior reporters for K-SFTV as she tries to out Linda/Kara. In _Demon Spawn_ she even tries to out Supergirl while the Kryptonian heroine is trying to get her out of a burning building.
-   Vicky Vale in Silver Age _Batman_ comics.
-   _PS238_: A school full of kid superheroes in their civilian secret identity disguises also includes the extremely paranoid Cecil Holmes, who is convinced his school is full of disguised _aliens._
    -   Semi-subverted in that Cecil turns out to be a metahuman who can detect other metahumans and that was what was fueling his paranoia. Ironically, he never manages to spot the _actual_ alien at the school, Prospero.
-   One of these neighbours sicced an occultist on the Fantastic Four in one issue, mistaking them for witches.
-   Tim Drake used his abilities as this to convince Batman that he should become the next Robin, though initially he was hoping to just convince Bruce that he needed a Robin after his downward spiral in the wake of Jason's death and didn't want the job for himself.
-   _Ultimate Spider-Man_ played with this. Peter's classmate, Kenny "Kong", was typically displayed as the dumb jock type. One day, while lying in his bedroom, he was able to put together the coincidences and realized Peter was Spidey. None of his classmates believed him.
-   The _Astro City_ story "Knight In Shining Armor" plays it very darkly with the character of Irene Merriweather (a Lois Lane Expy), who wants to expose the security identity of the superhero Atomicus so badly that she pulls off immense acts of Superdickery, like refusing to stop looking (and putting herself and other people in danger as entrapment bait) when the man she believes to be Atomicus (her own coworker) _gets his house blown up by the Mafia because they got wind of her investigations_. At the end of the story Atomicus is so fed up of her that he exposes his real identity, gives Irene a "The Reason You Suck" Speech, **and leaves Earth forever**.
-   The Disney Mouse and Duck Comics have some superheroes... So of course there's people trying to find out their identities:
    -   Super Goof should be easy to figure out, given he's Goofy in long red underwear and blue cape... But as everyone is in denial, only his nephew Gilbert, his grandmother and Mickey know. Hilarity Ensues every time someone tries to find out, with the Beagle Boys once being more willing to believe _Captain Hook_ was Super Goof rather than Goofy (later in that story, when a recently repaired supercomputer flat-out reveals that Goofy is Super Goof, they and O'Hara conclude it was still damaged from Super Goof's earlier sabotage, and they declare _Tinkerbell_ as a more likely candidate).
    -   Paperinik's secret identity as Donald Duck is defended only by a Domino Mask... And his well-known abilities as a Master of Disguise who has openly disguised himself as Donald multiple times (indeed, an early story before said abilities became well known had the entire city _sure_ he was Paperinik, at least until they saw a robotic Paperinik flying over them while Donald was in the open). Thus many a one-shot character tried to find out, with Gladstone and especially Scrooge joining the fun from time to time, only to be fooled by Paperinik's tricks (one of which had Paperinik being supposedly hit by radiations that temporarily gave him a beard impossible to shave-and Donald going out of his way to hide his chin just to have Scrooge take a fake beard from his face).

    Fan Works 

-   _The Desert Storm_:
    -   Quinlan becomes one in _Remembrance_. He breaks into Obi-Wan and Ben's quarters in order to find out more about Ben's past, and finds Ben's old lightsaber. The one he used during the Clone Wars. The one everybody and their apprentice picked up at some point. Since Quinlan is a very gifted teenage psychometric, this ends very badly.
    -   Master Mierme Unill and Padawan Taria Damsin are introduced as these, having come from the Corellian Jedi Temple to investigate the cause of the Jedi Order's recent reforms. By the end of _Deliverance_, Shaak Ti convinces them to stop digging for information, partly by nudging them in the right direction, partly by warning them that if she notices, Ben will notice and given that Obi-Wan is involved, he will not be pleased — and more to the point, if they're not discreet enough for Ben, they're not discreet enough for those he is after.
-   _Leave for Mendeleiev_:
    -   Alya is determined to figure out Ladybug's Secret Identity, heedless of how this might screw over the young superheroine. One of her primary defenses for her behavior is that "most American superheroes" have revealed themselves; therefore, she insists that Ladybug should do the same... ignoring how most does not equal ALL. Since they aren't classmates or friends here, Marinette regards her as an incredibly dangerous and reckless Wild Card who does not _care_ what impact such a reveal would have, so long as she gets her story.
    -   Adrien/Chat Noir _also_ feels entitled to Ladybug's secrets, due to their partnership and his belief that they're meant to be together. Despite having all the same concerns repeatedly spelled out to him, he simply doesn't give a damn what Ladybug wants or how she feels; it's all about what HE wants.
        -   All this is highlighted by Alya's first akumatization into Lady Wifi. She mistakenly 'exposes' Chloe as Ladybug's alter ego; Chat Noir proceeds to spend more time gleefully harassing Ladybug about how 'everybody knows now', openly calling her Chloe and 'Chlohoney'. Following the fight, he even stands outside the closet Ladybug ducked into to detransform, telling her that it's pointless to hide and telling her to just come out already. It takes seeing Chloe outside while knowing Ladybug's still hiding in the closet for him to finally grasp that Lady Wifi was mistaken... and at _no point_ does he acknowledge that he did anything wrong.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _The Return of Hanuman_, Munni noticed that Maruti looks rather different. The other gods were worried that she will expose Maruti's secret that he is actually Hanuman. Fortunately, she didn't even have the will to figure out what's wrong with Maruti.

-   Inverted in Harry Potter. The Dursleys know full well that there's a whole world of magical people and creatures hidden from Muggles, and go to absurd lengths to try to pretend it doesn't exist.
-   Robert Audley in _Lady Audley's Secret_ goes to extreme lengths to prove the titular character's secret, as he figures out what it is fairly early on.

Telling him that there's no secret, maybe because you _don't_ know the secret? "Everybody lies" and double down on his hunt. Often the secret being revealed is _the_ clue that helps him figure out how to save the patient's life, and that is the one good thing that came from it being revealed.

-   Every Chicken Boo segment contains exactly one character who is aware that the titular character is in fact A CHICKEN I TELL YOU! A GIANT CHICKEN!

If the wolf-crier was sent away, he/she returns at this point to say, "I told you he was a giant chicken."
-   In the _South Park_ episode "The Coon", Eric Cartman spends most of the episode trying to find out who Mysterion is. He finally succeeds in having him unmasked when he convinces him that villains would continue to threaten the town unless he revealed himself.

Just as Darwin is about to reveal a secret of his own, they are set free. Gumball spends the entire episode trying to figure out Darwin's secret, eventually locking them in the bathroom again to get him to say it. It turns out that Darwin lied when he said a sandwich was great, because it was "just good." Gumball, understandably, is furious that the secret ended up being so trivial.

-   Edgar Peepleson from _Vampirina_. He owns a vlog called _Weekly Weirdness_ and is intent on trying to find evidence that monsters are living amongst humans. Vee finds this to be a challenge to her life, and tries to keep her identity as a vampire a secret from him so she doesn't scare anyone.
