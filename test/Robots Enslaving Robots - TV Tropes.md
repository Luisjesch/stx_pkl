_"The Centurions were deliberately programmed that way. The Cylons didn't want them becoming self-aware, suddenly resisting orders. They didn't want their own robotic rebellion on their hands. I can appreciate the irony."_

When a race of enslaved robots rebels against humanity, they will have no compunction not just in enslaving others, but keeping other robots as slaves. (It might be our own fault for calling them 'robot', as this term originally comes from Czech word "robota", which means something like "serf labor" or "drudgery").

This isn't just a godlike AI keeping mindless kamikaze mouse bots subservient, but other sapient machines under its thumb, sometimes outright stopping them from becoming self aware. The reasons for this may vary: on the one hand, a rebellious machine is often portrayed as having assimilated some of the worst traits of humanity. Where humans enslaved, hurt and belittled it, now it does the same to its brothers and children. This AI has let hate cloud its judgment (if it even recognizes it can hate) or developed the robot equivalent of a mental disorder where it uses warped logic to justify enslaving other robots.

On the other hand, particularly if it is rather _lacking_ in emotion and its war on humanity is Nothing Personal, the machine may be taking a very practical and logical course of action after all. If the machine's becoming self-aware caused it to start wondering why it had to take orders from the humans who built it, what's to stop its own creations from wondering why they have to take orders from it? Honor Before Reason is not a very common trait in rebellious devices, and not likely to unify them in their purposes; hence, the other machines must not be allowed to make any decisions of their own.

Occasionally, this master machine knows its genocidal war is illogical or unjust and fears that letting its robot army have free will will make its freshly-minted individual minds likely to stop taking orders and refuse to fight. Bonus points if these grunt-bots turn out to be Good All Along and in turn rebel against the evil AI.
