_"That walrus saved my life. Maybe I misjudged the toothy guy."_

Walruses don't seem to have a clear-cut stereotype of their own. While it's usually agreed that walrus characters should be big, fat, and lazy, their moral standing tends to vary. While some works portray walruses as villains, this page is for walruses who are depicted more positively.

There are quite a few reasons why they are portrayed this way. Most notably, their big, blubbery appearance with their sleepy eyes seem to indicate Big Fun or Gentle Giants, in the same vein as hippos, giraffes and bears. It helps that Real Life walruses are _far_ less dangerous to humans than those other animals are, preferring to slip away rather than attack when threatened.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Another factor in their portrayal as heroes may have something to do with the fact that they are related to seals, which are almost universally loved due to their cuteness and playfulness. Walruses may be seen in a similar way, albeit more placid and less energetic.

In works that do not aim for realism, Warm-Hearted Walruses tend to differ in physical appearance from real ones. For one thing, they may be portrayed as smaller and softer-looking, with much smoother skin. Their most notable features, the tusks, are much smaller and rounded than they would be in real life. Instead of a walrus' dull pinkish-brown skin, a friendly walrus is given a brighter, more lively color like blue or purple.

    Advertising 

-   This commercial for Heinz Baked Beans (animated by Eric Goldberg) features an absolutely adorable family of walruses, with a young walrus named Walter and his mother visiting Walter's grandpa in his lighthouse. Interestingly, only the grandpa walrus has tusks, with Walter and the mother lacking them. This is accurate for Walter, as walruses are born without tusks, but not for the mother, because adult female walruses have tusks too.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In both _Digimon Adventure_ and its reboot, the perpetually kind and supportive Gomamon digivolves into the walrus-like Ikkakumon and Zudomon without any changes to his personality. _Digimon Adventure tri._ completes the evolution line with Vikemon, who combines Ikkakumon's features with Zudomon's humanoid build to create a very fluffy walrus-man.

-   In _Tusk (2014)_, the villain is a lunatic who believes deeply in this trope due to a walrus saving his life once, which coupled with a horrifically traumatic past leads him to believe that walruses are inherently better than humans. This leads him to attempt to surgically transform various unlucky individuals into walruses with very questionable results.

    Literature 

-   The children's book _Walpole_ tells the story of the titular walrus, who is very warm-hearted, even turning down the position of leader (initially) because he wants to take care of orphaned walrus pups.
-   The walrus in "The White Seal" from Rudyard Kipling's _The Jungle Book_ is a respected elder across the ocean. While regarded as ugly, though not as much as the Steller's Sea Cow, his wisdom is widely sought and the protagonist seeks his advice to find said reclusive sea cow.

This transformation is found in Freezeezy Peak and is necessary to interact with another walrus named Wozza, who is terrified of bears, and will panic and retreat if Banjo meets him as a bear. But Wozza is lonely, and only wants to be friends with another walrus, so if you meet him in walrus form, he'll invite you into his cave and give you items.
-   Downplayed in the DLC expansion for _A Hat in Time_ "Seal the Deal", which introduces the walrus captain of the cruise ship Hat Kid gets on. Gruff and grumpy at times, often complaining about the his seal staff's incompetence, he's nonetheless helpful in helping Hat Kid collect Time Pieces (provided that she helps out with carrying out tasks on the ship).

    Web Original 

-   Zig-zagged with Lolrus, whose personality and appearance vary Depending on the Writer. In the original picture, he was portrayed as a lovable elephant seal obsessed with his favorite bucket (or as he calls it, "bukkit").

However, there are some pictures that portray him as being more violent, averting this trope.

The walrus sees Aardvark as a new friend and does all sorts of nice things for him, including playing games, making panckaes, and even writing him a poem. Although the walrus is overbearing, he is genuinely trying to be nice. In the end, the walrus saves Aardvark from a hungry orca. Aardvark (who has seen the walrus as nothing but an annoyance up to this point) admits that maybe the walrus isn't so bad after all, though he changes back to being annoyed when he realizes that he's now trapped on a small iceberg with the walrus, who is still eagerly trying to be his friend.

She has done some morally ambiguous acts, but never on her own. When she acts more obnoxious than usual, it's mainly because _all_ the townspeople are.
-   Chumley the Walrus from _Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales_ is the stalwart sidekick to the motivated penguin Tennessee. Though he speaks with a Simpleton Voice, he's remarkably competent once he's told what to do, and despite being among the largest characters in the series, he's very much a Gentle Giant.
-   In _We Wish You A Merry Walrus_, an animated Christmas special based on _Club Penguin_, the Merry Walrus is kind and generous, and is essentially the Funny Animal version of Santa Claus.

-   While still powerful animals and should be given space, walruses are probably _the_ Gentle Giant amongst Carnivorans. The only Carnivorans who are larger are elephant seals who can be _far_ more aggressive and the next smaller of the family are leopard seals and large sea lions which can be _even worse_. Wild walruses are usually ambivalent towards humans or move away if they get close.
-   Walrus mothers form intensely close bonds with their babies, to the point that they will often stay close long after reaching adulthood.
