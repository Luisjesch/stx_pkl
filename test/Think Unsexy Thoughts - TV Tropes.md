Sadly that didn't help him make his... GOOOAL... of lasting longer.

_"Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day! Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!"_

Sometimes, a man doesn't _want_ to have an erection. Either it's potentially physically hazardous, or there's a beautiful woman who he actually wants to spend time with and turning up with an obvious case of wood might not help (or both). It could be that he's just embarrassed to be seen in public that way. And sometimes, a man might be in the act, so to speak, and in need of some way to delay the inevitable.

Either way, the solution is the same: to conjure up some image in the brain that draws attention away from the contents of the pants. Such an image is either hilariously mundane or hilariously horrific. In American media, the former option often takes the form "think about baseball!"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Someone in a Transparent Closet might try thinking of someone of the same gender; because of course thinking about the same gender would not result in a positive reaction for a heterosexual person like themselves. For some reason, this doesn't work.

The opposite of Lie Back and Think of England when used for sex. Fetish Retardant and The Loins Sleep Tonight are inversions of this.

Contrast with Not Distracted by the Sexy, where somebody doesn't have to struggle to avoid having sexual thoughts.

    -   _Violence Inherent in the System_:

    -   _Revealing Perspectives_:
        
        **Harry:** _No! Stop it. Think about something else. Think about Snape. Eurgh. Snape and Umbridge; in tutus. Hrrk._
        
    -   In _A Collection of Harmonious OneShots_ Hermione, fed up with Harry's comment that he loves her like a sister, ties him to a bed and then strips.

    -   _The Augurey_:
        
        _Shit, fuck, god-dammit, son of a_—\[Harry\] was going to come in his pants and embarrass himself completely. _Shit. Hagrid's pajamas, Flobberworms, Cornelius Fudge, Aunt Petunia's knickers._
        
    -   _Out of the Ashes_:
        
        \[Blaise\] wracked his brain to think of something disgusting enough to get his erection to go down... ah, he had it... Snape and Dumbledore, together and naked. **Ugh!**
        
    -   _A Second Chance at Happiness? Maybe?_:
        
        He supposed another reason it was so strange was because of how arousing he found the image. Regulus looked poised and focused, holding a deadly weapon and standing proud and dangerous. Harry kept having to think of dead puppies to stop his body from reacting. Getting an erection while wearing thin trousers was not going to go down well.
        
    -   In _17, Clumsy and Shy_ Harry gets an erection when Ginny lands on him after falling off a ladder.
        
        Harry turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder. "Sorry," he said again, his voice sounding gruff and deep. He tried to think of the least arousing thing in the world..._Snape in his underpants...Snape in a dress...Mundungus Fletcher kissing Snape in a dress_...
        
    -   _Chimera Luck_:
        
        **Harry:** _Bubotuber pus. Blast ended skrewts. Percy Weasley. Voldemort in a Speedo. Snape in a Speedo. Oh, ick!_
        
    -   _HexCrossed Lovers_:
        
        **Harry:** _'Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall in bed together with whipped cream? No, that's not going to work. Filch, Mrs. Norris and Lockhart in a three way. I've got it now; Voldemort in a pink lace negligee that should work!_
        
    -   _The Coffee Prince_:
        
        **George:** _Think of naked Hagrid doing things with that Beauxbatons bird. Think of crabby old Aberforth tending to his goats. Think of McGonagall in a corset. Don't think of Harry bent over the counters. Don't let his smile get to you. Most of all, don't reach out and grab his arse!_
        
    -   In _When All Seems Lost (It's Not)_ an announcement of Mrs. Weasley's arrival interrupts Harry and Snape's makeout session.

    -   _Magical Blocks and Bonds_:
        
        **Harry:** Snape in Madam Longbottom's dress, and Umbitch's pink cardy, Dumbledore in board shorts and a grubby grey singlet.
        
-   Happens a couple of times in _Serendipitous Fate_ with Adrien, with thoughts such as his father in a Speedo and kittens which may or may not be dead. Results in a hilarious Digging Yourself Deeper exchange with Marinette when she asks what he's thinking about.
-   In _Captain Proton and the Planet of Lesbians_, Buster Kincaid is faced with twin scantily-dressed scientists intent on using him as a Glorified Sperm Donor for their Lady Land society. He tries a Survival Mantra ("I must drink beer, beer is the mind killer..."), the procedure for assembling a Class IV Rocket Engine ("Insert the long tribanium rod into the moist cunt...I mean the Moise-Carver termination socket. Do not attempt to force the rod if it becomes stuck, but instead come, I mean _coat_ the rod in ejaculate..._ejection_ lubricant in order to ease its passage into the tight hole...") and then:
    
    "The President of Earth naked!" babbled Buster. "The cold depths of space, ahhh... the Giant Toothed Vagina of Freudian Nightmares! The Slime-Dripping Sludge Monster of Stenchia III!"
    
-   In _My Huntsman Academia_, Izuku accidentally ropes himself into a game of romantic chicken with Yang. She uses every trick in the book to get him to fold, including leaning forward so he could stare straight at her Cleavage Window. He desperately tries to think of everything cold he can to keep it down.
    
    **Yang:** _\[leaning on a restaurant table seductively\]_ Don't be so stressed Iz-u-ku~ After all, you've taken me out to someplace fancy... you're allowed to look~.  
    **Izuku:** _\[looking anywhere but at her\]_ Cold thoughts Izuku, cold thoughts. Ice cubes, cold showers, Mountain Glenn winter. Going skiing on the top of the mountain and then tumbling down a good way through all that snow. Cold thoughts, cold thoughts, cold thoughts...
    
-   In _Eye of the Storm_, in reaction to Scathach's beauty, Shirou try to focus his thoughts on Rin. It isn't specified if he want to calm buzzing hormones by focusing on his true love, or by fear of what she will do to him if he's be unfaithful.

    Films — Live-Action

-   In the Steve Martin movie _All of Me_, a woman is stuck in the body of the main character. He wants to sleep with another female character, but his "roommate" objects and starts filling his head with images of dead kittens and old nuns.
-   _Austin Powers_ combines this with a Survival Mantra: "Baseball, cold showers. Baseball, cold showers." Then, after things escalate a bit: "MARGARET THATCHER NAKED ON A COLD DAY! MARGARET THATCHER NAKED ON A COLD DAY!"
-   _Bedrooms And Hallways_: Margaret Thatcher again serves as anti-erection fodder, where Leo, a gay man, is convinced to sit in a sauna with the fellow (straight) members of his support group.
-   The title character of _Blankman_ routinely goes into... convulsions... when kissed or otherwise aroused. "Think about math..."
-   A Running Gag in _Bubble Boy_ is Jimmy reciting the Pledge of Allegiance any time he gets an erection and repeating it until it goes away, as his hyper-fundamentalist mother had taught him to do. This includes when his crush gets a little too close to him while teaching him to play guitar and, much later, when mud wrestling two bikini-clad women.
-   In _Closely Watched Trains_, a Czech film that oscillates between sex comedy and La Résistance thriller, the protagonist is a young man who is suicidally depressed after he prematurely ejaculated on the big night with his girlfriend. The doctor advises him to think about football to slow things down.
-   In the movie _The Couch Trip_ John Burns, who is posing as a psychiatrist, recommends thinking of transmission repair for this purpose. Unfortunately, his description of taking apart a transmission, though he doesn't seem to realize or intend it, does not exactly qualify as unsexy. Observe.
-   _Follow That Dream_: Toby's go-to method of not getting taken in when a woman is trying to seduce him is to recite multiplication tables.
-   _Head in the Clouds_: Gilda instructs Guy "Think Sunday school" when they first have sex so he lasts longer.

    Literature 

-   Dave Barry:
    -   In _Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys_, Barry includes advice for men on how to delay their orgasms and suggests thinking of Margaret Thatcher, or, in extreme cases, Rush Limbaugh in a thong.
    -   In another, he mentions a technique devised by a friend of his, wherein the man and the woman are having sex, and the guy's dog comes to investigate, and cheerfully shoves its subzero nose in an area the guy would _really_ not like to feel cold in.
        
        **Man:** Yesyesyesyesyesyesyes...  
        **Woman:** Yesyesyesyesyesyesyes...  
        **Man:** YesyesyesYEOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW...
        
-   In the novel _Choke_, the protagonist thinks of corpses and other disgusting things to avoid early ejaculation.
-   _Discworld_: In _Going Postal_, Moist von Lipwig finds himself in this mindset regarding Adora Belle Dearheart. "_He'd get another chance to be smiled at by Miss Dearheart — think about Golems! Golems, golems, golems!_"
-   In _Heaven Official’s Blessing: Tian Guan Ci Fu_, practitioners of cultivational purity like Xie Lian are taught to mentally recite from the Daoist scripture _Dao De Jing_ in order to dispel unwanted reactions. For Xie Lian, the technique is less that effective against his reaction to Hua Cheng.
-   _Heralds of Valdemar_: Early in the _Mage Winds_ trilogy, Darkwind rescues a woman who he finds sexually attractive, but who he thinks may be a Honey Trap. (She is.) To counter his physical response to her, he concentrates on the monthly chore of scrubbing out the reservoir in his privy.
-   _Inheritance Cycle_: In _Brisingr_, when Nasuada meets Blödhgarm, she is distracted by his appealing scent. Elva advises her to think about the bitter taste of horehound, which clears her head.
    
    Again she succumbed to the wanton attraction of Blödhgarm's odor, imagining what it would feel like to run her hands through his mane. She only returned to herself when Elva pulled on her left arm, forcing her to bend over and place her ear close to the witch-child's mouth. In a low, harsh voice, Elva said, "Horehound. Concentrate upon the taste of horehound."  
    Following her advice, Nasuada summoned a memory from the previous year, when she had eaten horehound candy during one of King Hrothgar's feasts. Just thinking about the acrid flavor of the candy dried out her mouth and counteracted the seductive qualities of Blödhgarm's musk.
    
-   In Stephen King's _It_, Tom Rogan thinks of "White Sox batting averages or who was trying to undercut him for the Chesley account at work" to last longer in bed.
-   _The Parasol Protectorate_: _Soulless_ has two instances:
    -   Lord Maccon _tries_ to get himself under control regarding Alexia.
        
        _He was sure his control was around somewhere if he could simply find it. He tore his eyes away from the tops of those remarkable breasts of hers and tried to think unpleasant thoughts of particularly horrible things, like overcooked vegetables and cut-rate wine._
        
    -   Later, Alexia is locked in a cell with Lord Maccon by the villains, and due to her status as a Power Nullifier and it being full Moon, she has to hold on to him so he stays in human form, and when she really notices that he's naked...
        
        _He did not seem particularly perturbed by this fact, but Miss Tarabotti felt the sudden need to close her eyes tight and think about asparagus or something equally mundane._
        
-   In _Trading Bases: A Story About Wall Street, Gambling, and Baseball_, author Joe Peta recalls a college friend who pictured baseball star Roberto Clemente when he wanted to slow himself down. Peta mortified him in a social setting by saying his pal had to imagine Clemente while having sex, to which another fellow asked "Batting or fielding?"
-   _Whateley Universe_: In _Boston Brawl_, when Fey and Tennyo are teasing Hank with Teamwork Seduction, Sara advises him to distract himself by thinking about non-sexual things.
    
    She laughed and pulled him over to the window, "OK, _dude_, the key is chairs."  
    "Chairs?" He looked puzzled.  
    "Think about anything non-sexual. Furniture is good for most guys. Or someone totally heinous, like Hitler or George W. Bush. Anything to get your mind off the problem."  
    Understanding slowly dawned on his face, "Ah… ok… chairs. Right, chairs. Hey, chairs are made out of wood, right?"  
    "No," Sara shook her head, "don't go there. Woody Allen's not a good one either. How about cups? Not too erotic?"  
    "Depends what you put in them."  
    "Touché. Ok, I've got a sure fire winner. Ms. Hartford."  
    Hank winced, "Thanks, I'll never get any wood ever again..."
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Boy Meets World_: In "The Last Temptation of Cory", Cory mutters the words "lunchroom lady" to get him to stop thinking about a pretty girl who is trying to seduce him away from Topanga.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: "Earshot" had Buffy acquiring uncontrollable telepathy after killing a demon who has the power. Xander freaks out when he learns about this, because of his usual train of thought, and tries desperately to deter it:
    
    **Xander:** 4 times 5 is 30. 5 times 6 is 32. Naked women. Naked Buffy. Help!
    
    -   Made slightly funnier in that Xander is so focused on trying to distract himself that he gets the maths wrong.
-   _Dollhouse_: In "Needs", several Actives wake up in their sleeping chambers with their original personalities before they were mind-wiped, but no memory of how they got there. So they have to pretend to be the mind-wiped Actives while they work out how to escape; unfortunately, this means going into the co-ed showers. Victor plays the baseball flavor of this trope straight and out loud, reciting the Mets roster by fielding position after catching a glimpse of incredibly hot Sierra all wet and naked.
-   _Farscape_: In "Coup By Clam", D'Argo becomes mentally linked to Noranti, who starts stimulating herself, causing an identical reaction in D'Argo, who doesn't enjoy it as much as you'd think.
    
    **Aeryn:** Come on D'Argo. Just fight it.  
    **John:** Dee, think about baseball. Math. Isosceles triangle. Rusty... razor blades. Gravel. _\[hint: it doesn't work\]_
    
-   _The Flash (2014)_: In "The Nuclear Man", Barry Allen is given some unwanted advice by Cisco in order to avoid being the Fastest Man Alive during his date with Linda Park.
    
    **Cisco:** You're gonna need to think about a _lot_ of dead puppies. Like, we're talking about a whole _kennel_. And baseball. Cold showers. You know what? _Nuns_.
    
-   _Frasier_:
    -   Frasier and Kate Costas are trying to get over their mutual lust after their affair nearly loses them their jobs. Attempting to avoid the press by taking a service elevator, they get stuck and soon discover the elevator is full of the belongings of a romance novelist who's moving house, and a few accidents later they're in a mood-lit compartment with sultry posters on the walls, reeking of spilt musk oil, and with a double mattress taking up most of the floor.
    -   Niles' advice to Frasier when he's trying to resist Lilith;
        
        **Niles:** Remember the summer we were at Uncle Henry's farm, we found that dead horse, lying in the hot sun, crawling with maggots? Hold on to that picture! You can ride that horse to safety!  
        **Frasier:** Thank you, Niles. You know, that might just do the trick. When it comes to an ugly image, you can't beat a dead horse.
        
    -   In an episode when Niles was desperate for sex, Daphne makes one of her typical Innocent Innuendo remarks that sends Niles' mind off to fantasy land. Frasier brings him back down to Earth with the phrase "Grandma in a teddy."
-   _Friends_:
    -   In an episode, Joey mentions "baseball, or sandwiches, or... Chandler" as things he thinks of to keep himself from getting too "excited". Phoebe tries to follow his advice when she has to massage an incredibly hot client, but finds even baseball and sandwiches too sexy... thinking about Chandler, on the other hand, works fine. In fact it works a little _too_ well and she gets so distracted she lets the appointment overrun by an hour.
    -   In another episode Ross gets rid of an erection by thinking about his grandmother.
    -   After Phoebe and Mike break up Phoebe asks Monica to keep them from having sex again. Eventually Monica is forced to leave Phoebe and Mike alone together while she uses the bathroom so she provides them with a list of off-putting imagery to keep themselves under control while she's out of the room.
        
        **Monica:** Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
        
-   _Glee_: A Running Gag is Finn thinking of the time he ran over a mailman in order to prevent himself... arriving early. It's made a plot point on "Never Been Kissed" when Sam needs to find his "mailman" and decides to think of Coach Bieste in various unflattering positions. It's so effective that the method spreads-in fact, it's _too_ effective, soon the boys (and Tina) actually start saying Bieste's name during makeout sessions, causing their partners to become suspicious. And then Bieste finds out, and things get very unfunny. That's right, _Glee_ actually deconstructed the trope.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_:
    -   Marshall tries to prolong sex with Lily to avoid a big fight they agreed that they wouldn't have until after they'd had sex. To slow things down, he starts thinking of unsexy things, such as roadkill, clipping toenails, and bugs. But then he finds he's taken it too far and needs to rearouse himself, so he starts thinking of sexy things, such as bugs with boobs.
    -   Inverted with Barney's brother James before he came out as gay: while having sex with his girlfriend, he'd think about baseball (and, more specifically, the men playing baseball) to make it go _faster_.
-   _iZombie_: After eating the brain of a CDC doctor, Liv starts to get visions of her having sex with Ravi. Ravi apparently says unsexy things _out loud_ in order to "delay the inevitable".
-   _Kyle XY_: Josh explains to Kyle that when he doesn't want to have an erection, he thinks of "disgusting things" (for him, zits and old people). Kyle responds that he finds grapefruit disgusting (Josh: "Huh."). Later in the episode, he repeated that phrase while escaping naked from the parents of the girl he was with.
    
    **Josh:** Zits. Old people. Zits. Old people. GRAPEFRUIT!
    
-   _LazyTown_ has Bill Thompson captured by the "Evil Dudette" (who is the brother of the "Evil Dude") shouting out "You're an ugly girl!" & what Austin Powers said about Margret Thatcher without clothes on a cold day.
-   _Married... with Children_:
    -   In "What I Did for Love", Jefferson mentions that there was a time when he had to think about baseball to slow things down during sex; nowadays, he just wants to think about baseball.
    -   In another episode Steve thanks Al, because wondering why Steve Guttenberg is a star works like this.
    -   In "Dial B for Virgin", Bud thinks out loud "Zima Guy, Zima Guy. No, no, I mean, I mean, Roseanne, Roseanne..."
-   _Melissa & Joey_: In one episode, Joey has to constantly call his mom in order to distract him from having sexual thoughts about a friend of Melissa.
-   _My Left Nut_: When the doctor is showing Mick's swollen testicle to the medical students, Mick is busy worrying about not getting a Raging Stiffie, especially since the attractive medical student is also there. He keeps thinking about cold water to keep himself in control... but amusingly ends up having shrinkage instead of an erection.
    
    **Mick:** Jumping in the sea in Donegal. Jumping in the freezing cold Atlantic ocean in Donegal. The absolutely baltic freezing cold ocean covering my balls.  
    _\[Mick sneaks a glance down at his penis\]_  
    **Mick:** Shite! Not that cold. Warm. Warm. Warm thoughts.
