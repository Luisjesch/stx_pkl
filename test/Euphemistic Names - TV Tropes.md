**Rafe Masters**: What are you going to do to me?  
**Reagan Ridley**: Well, I was going to erase every woman you've ever dated...  
**Rafe Masters**: No! Not Chesty McThong and Boussums Naturale and Nora Gagreflex!

When a person's name sounds like it can refer to a person's breasts, bottom, genitalia, or depraved acts one does with all three.

There is a certain Double Standard when it comes to Euphemistic Names. When a woman has it, expect her to be the smoking-hot Femme Fatale type that is just begging to be hit on by the male protagonist. If it's a man, it's either an Atrocious Alias he picked out for himself to evoke the trope or an Unfortunate Name that got him bullied in school.

The two common applications of Euphemistic Names are in either Tuxedo and Martini–style Spy Fiction or Pornography. In the latter, it's a staple of Porn Names for obvious reasons. It also regularly crops up in Parallel Porn Titles, where any naughty pun that can be made from the original title will be made.

Related to Meaningful Name, Punny Name, and Unfortunate Names. May turn out to be a Real Joke Name. If the name was bestowed by someone else, it may be an Embarrassing Nickname. For innuendos that originally sounded innocent (like those wholesome old names "Dick" and "Fanny"), see Have a Gay Old Time.

See also A Dick in Name, usually used with the Jerkass meaning of _dick_, rather than the sexual one.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Gintama_: In Eastern order, recurring reporter Ana Ketsuno's name sounds like the Japanese term for "anus" (_ketsu no ana_).
-   _World's End Harem_: Shota Doi, the deuteragonist, is a case that gets Lost in Translation unless you're familiar with Japanese pornography: "shota" is a term for fetish scenarios where a motherly older woman has sex with an inexperienced younger male, i.e. pretty much exactly what happens when Shota is unfrozen and placed into a "Truman Show" Plot that includes his beloved former music teacher Yuzuki Hanyu.

    Comedy 

-   This is the subject of the Rowan Atkinson sketch "No One Called Jones," where a teacher at a boy's prep school is taking attendance. While some names ("Herpes," "Clitoris," etc.) are not even remotely euphemistic, most of the students being called on have names like "Imadick," "Myprick," and the Russian exchange student "Suckmeoff," leading to sentences like, "Dodo, Suckmeoff, Niceandquick, detention Saturday!" Then the headmaster of the school is revealed to be named "Mr. Greatbighardcock." There is a "clean" version of the same sketch where the boys only have Inherently Funny Names like "Plectrum" and "Nancyboy-Potter," but they manage to sound like euphemisms anyway.
    
    **Schoolmaster:** NIBBLE! _LEAVE ORIFICE ALONE!_

-   The Trope Codifier that spawned a billion homages with the trope belongs to the _James Bond_ franchise, with various female characters James Bond encounters (either as foes, love-interests, or allies) having a suggestive name of some sort.

    -   Lampshaded in _Casino Royale (2006)_. While taking a taxi from the Montenegro airport to the casino, Bond and Vesper Lynd (a Punny Name but not an example of this trope) start going over their cover identities. Bond tells Vesper her cover name is "Miss Stephanie Broadchest", prompting her to interrupt, "I am not!" We never actually find out for certain whether it's her real cover name or if he's just pulling her leg.

    Literature 

-   _The Scum Villain's Self-Saving System: Ren Zha Fanpai Zijiu Xitong_:
    -   The protagonist Shen Yuan's online ID was Peerless Cucumber (cucumber being as a euphemism for a penis). He also attempts to use it as a regular alias later in the story, though he almost immediately regrets it.
    -   Shang Qinghua, the author of the novel the story is set in, wrote under the name Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky. 'Beating one's airplane' is Chinese slang for masturbation.

    Live-Action TV 

-   A question in _The Chase (Game Show)_ asked who Andy Capp is known as in Germany — Dick Tingeler, Helmut Schmacker, or Willi Wakker. Bradley and the audience near-instantly lost their composure at the _first_ name.

    **Andy:** So, she's smuggling diamonds, Bond, and your job is to find out how. Just go to the hotel reception, and ask for Fanny Vajazzle.
    
-   _WandaVision_: Ralph Bohner finds his own last name rather amusing when Monica says it out loud. Whether this was the name given to him in the Hex, a stage name (since he had a headshot), or his real name is never elaborated on.
-   Played with in the _Seinfeld_ episode "The Junior Mint". Jerry's new girlfriend told him that her name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy, but he can't remember what it is. In desperation, he guesses Bovary, Mulva, Loleola, Celeste, Hest, and Gipple, and she storms out angrily. It isn't until too late that he remembers it's Dolores.
-   Referenced by Aunjanue Ellis when drew from the "Sombrero of awkward questions" on the red carpet before the 2022 Oscars.

Some names that may show up among players include Mike Hunt, Barry McCocciner, Gabe Itch, Jenna Talia, and Penny Trayshun.

-   _The Simpsons_: At the end of "Homer to the Max", Homer tells Marge that while he was at the courthouse, he had her name officially changed to "Chesty LaRue". When Marge protests, Homer proposes the alternatives "Busty St. Clair" and "Hooty McBoob".
