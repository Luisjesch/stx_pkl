_Sexual behaviour among gay men is an exceptionally good indicator of what happens when the limiting factor of female sexual preference is entirely removed. Straight men’s sexual preferences are constrained by the fact that, when women are given a choice, they are generally much pickier than men and reject a much larger proportion of suitors._

—**Louise Perry**, _The Case Against the Sexual Revolution_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

The homosexual version (and logical conclusion) of I'm a Man; I Can't Help It, All Men Are Perverts, and A Man Is Always Eager. If all men constantly want sex, then men who are attracted to other men obviously must be constantly _having_ sex. After all, there's no women involved to say no, so what's stopping them, right?

This stereotype is in fact the _reason_ why gay people are called "gay." The word changed meanings over the years from "bright and showy," to "carefree and full of mirth," to "addicted to pleasures" and eventually to "sexually promiscuous." Sometime in the early 20th century, the word narrowed to specifically refer to homosexual men due to belief in the stereotype (previously "gay" actually meant promiscuous _heterosexual_ men, odd as it may seem now).

This trope has some interesting historical basis, in that many gay and lesbian writers post-Stonewall (and a few queer theory writers more recently) advocated emphasizing difference from heterosexual and normative life. This difference included denigrating marriage and monogamy, thus strengthening the link between homosexuality and promiscuity in the eyes of those who viewed all homosexuals as sick sexual deviants.

Lesbians have their own version of this trope; lesbians are stereotyped as women stepping in the roles of men, which includes emulating the male sexual appetite. This is part of the basis behind the Lesbian Vampire trope, who is a woman that preys on other women and "transforms" them into creatures like her.

When it comes to bisexual characters, this can be the result of writers wanting to avoid But Not Too Bi; by committing to a monogamous relationship, the bisexual character might be deemed 'choosing a side', leading either to the appearance they were merely gay-in-denial, or were merely expressing token same-sex affections for the sake of fanservice/diversity. Having multiple relationships with multiple genders helps to avoid this. _However_, in real life, even among the LGBT community, bisexuals often face biphobic discrimination for supposedly being promiscuous and unfaithful, as well as accused of being confused/in-denial of their sexuality or even merely wanting attention, so playing this straight _and_ averting it both results in negative implications. Avoiding both can be a tricky minefield with no obvious solution, which ironically is part of the problem bisexuals often face when dating.

How this trope is treated in the eye of the writer (or the reader for that matter) will depend on how they view sexuality itself, whether they believe that frequent sex when detached from romantic relationships is a matter of morality, and what they believe normative sexuality _should_ be.

The LGBT news media tend to go to the opposite extreme. A common trope in those media is that gay men are unrealistically picky in their sexual or romantic choices.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Gilbert in _Kaze to Ki no Uta_. Although this may be less to do with being gay and more to do with him having some serious unresolved issues.

-   Possibly both of the characters from _Kuso Miso Technique_ but certainly Abe, who sits outside the public toilets, asking good-looking men if they "want to do it" and then shows them his penis.
-   _Prince Charming_: Mostly Kagami, but Asahina is tempted to invoke this trope.
-   _Yandere Kanojo_: Shuuei Mori. In his introductory chapter, the first thing he says to every guy he meets is "Hey, wanna go to a hotel later?".
-   _Murciélago_ has the protagonist Kuroko whose biggest priority always seems to be getting a pretty lady to sleep with her.
-   Deconstructed in _Bokura no Hentai_. Tamura is the most hormonal of the major characters by far. Tamura lost his virginity in middle school to his abusive straight crush. Prior to that, he had Erotic Dreams where he was a nymphomaniac woman and he believes these were visions of a past life, though they're really related to his repressed memories of being molested when he was younger. After breaking ties with his crush, he began hanging around older men in drag and tried to have sex with at least two different characters (and actually does with Marika to an extent). His promiscuous behavior has less to do with him being gay and more to do with his issues over his past abuse.
-   _Kämpfer_: Sakura is a lesbian with a tremendous crush on the main character in his female form. Later, it turns out that she has a Split Personality which gets off on sexually brainwashing women, to the point that she has her own harem of slaves and is shown in bed (implied to be post-coitus) with them multiple times. She is the _only_ female character shown to be sexually active at all and that the other female leads all prefer Senou in his male form.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_:
    -   Reo is openly bisexual and shows no preference for men or women. She also has No Sense of Personal Space, readily getting up close to smell anyone if she likes their scent. However, Matsuri is the only one Reo wants to date.
    -   Suzu is likewise monogamous, but her libido and aggression seem to correlate with her attraction to girl Matsuri. She starts the series an Ambiguously Bi Covert Pervert, but spends the latter half as a Hormone-Addled Teenager who'd gladly bed Matsuri in either form.

    Comic Books 

-   Unfortunately, this trope is played completely straight in _Associated Student Bodies_, a furry comic about a young lion who discovers his homosexuality while living in a nearly all-gay dorm at college. While the story is presented, and usually marketed, as a more or less "realistic" story about gay issues, pretty much all the gay characters are presented as feverishly sex-obsessed, having polyamorous relationships with each other and just generally banging each other at every conceivable opportunity. The trope reaches its apex in issue 5, where it is revealed that the gays at Daniel's college organize a huge orgy every New Year's Eve at his dorm.
-   _Chelsea Boys_ plays it straight with some characters, and averts it with others. The main character's best friend pretty much says that this trope outright, and that the main guy is going against all common gay logic in wanting to be monogamous.
-   Subverted in the furry comic _Circles_, unlike the other dozen or so gay furry comics that have devolved into this. Every couple ends up in an exclusive relationship with no cheating. The only characters who were previously promiscuous were Paulie, Arthur, Ken, and John.
-   In the Furry Comic _Tank Vixens_ seemingly every girl in the 101st Tank Crushers is sleeping with all the others save Firen and Sonya.
-   Not surprisingly, this appears frequently in _Chick Tracts_.

    Fanfiction 

-   Slash Fic often features one promiscuous gay, and one who is in the closet, and then proceed to use the "Promiscuous man is changed by his true love for chaste woman" plot, but with two male protagonists.
-   Jim Bond (Get it?) in the _Glee_ fanfiction series, _Spah Verse_.
-   Jim Moriarty in the _Sherlock_ fanfic _Baker School Blitz_. Justified by Jim's medically-diagnosed nymphomania.

    Film 

-   Sacha Baron Cohen's character Brüno (2009) is pretty much every negative gay stereotype rolled into one person. Cohen apparently considered it homophobic to find this caricature unappealing, even though most real-life gay people wouldn't want to be around a guy like Bruno, either.
-   Wallace Wells, Scott Pilgrim's cool gay roommate, is characterized with this trope, even going so far as to hang a lampshade on it when he's chastising Scott for infidelity.
    
    **Scott**: Double standard!  
    **Wallace**: Hey, I didn't make the gay rules. If you don't like it, take it up with Liberace's ghost!
    
-   Guy Bennett in _Another Country_ has apparently seduced anyone and everyone at that college, and probably their brothers too.
-   The men in _Stranger by the Lake_ - but then again, the film _is_ set at a cruising ground...
-   Averted in the film _The Love of Siam_. The two gay characters in the movie never even had sex, with each other or anyone else.
-   _Boat Trip_ is this trope: The Movie.
-   The dueling films about Yves Saint Laurent, _Yves Saint Laurent_ and _Saint Laurent_, both tackle this trope head-on, but they take different approaches. The former deals with Pierre and Yves's open relationship delicately, while focusing on the love the two had for each other. The latter revels in the wild parties, orgies, and free love of the 1970s, focusing on Yves's torrid affair with a young gigolo.
-   Kate Veach in _DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story_ is thought to be a lesbian when she makes out with her partner Joyce after winning the tournament. She then announces she's actually bisexual and immediately makes out with Peter, with no apparent objection from Joyce.

    Literature 

-   Unlike the lustful men and women of _The Divine Comedy_'s Hell, the homosexuals in Hell are not grouped in pairs, but travel in large bands. This implies sodomy doesn't have the same intimacy and union of baby-makin' sex (Dante's words).
-   David Reuben, the author of _Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask_, once sincerely believed that this trope was inviolable law. Along with the perpetuation of the myth that Coca-Cola made an effective spermicide, the preaching of this stereotype was what made the book infamous long after its initial popularity died down. Thirty years later, he recanted this in a revised edition, apologizing for his earlier portrayal. In the new version being gay was treated neutrally.
-   Inverted in Joe Haldeman's award-winning SF novel _The Forever War_. As a population control measure the Earth government in the future encourages homosexuality. When the hero and his girlfriend, a hetero couple, are hospitalized together, their gay doctor teases them with this trope. "Still in separate beds?"
-   Played with in German novel _Gottes Bodenpersonal - Eine Unwahrscheinliche Liebesgeschichte_ - one of the protagonists is a male hooker with male customers, but it's just a job. What he really wants is a romantic candlelight dinner with a nice, gentlemanly man who opens doors for him. Another protagonist is a Chaste Hero, who never got around to look for a partner, and was only slightly worried by the fact that he never met a nice girl at church. When he falls in love with a man, he is worried about having his heart broken because of this trope. Both of them are shown to become happily monogamous, and even adopt a child together.
-   _Heralds of Valdemar_: Firesong k'Treva, coming from a Non-Heteronormative Society, had company and his choice of men as often as he wanted among the Tayledras, and he wanted them often. Traveling to Valdemar his prospects got slimmer, and then going on a mission into Hardorn meant not having anyone at all, which he wasn't used to. In the _Mage Storms_ trilogy when he and An'desha break up, between Valdemar's tolerant but mildly homophobic culture and the Storms affecting his psyche and making him more irritable, Firesong didn't have anyone for months and this didn't help his state of mind.
    -   Vanyel is essentially celibate when he doesn't have a life-bonded partner. He has a fling with a soldier in his twenties, and not much else considering that it's Lonely at the Top. It takes his father most of his life to get over the knee-jerk assumption that being gay means being not only promiscuous but also a pedophile.
        -   Vanyel's first lifebonded had had a bad first experience and so was reluctant to start new relationships, including with Van. His _second_, Stefan, who is the reincarnation of the first, had a much more active sex life until meeting Van and fully becoming a gay Ladykiller in Love.
-   In Francine Rivers' _The Mark of the Lion_ trilogy, this is played straight with every major homosexual character in the series. Justified since most of the heterosexual characters are pretty promiscuous, too. It _is_ Ancient Rome. Averted with Prometheus after his conversion in the last book, mostly because he doesn't want to be gay.
-   Deconstructed in _Before Night Falls_, Reinaldo Arenas's memoir of life as a gay man under Castro's regime. The promiscuity of many of the gay characters is presented as a reaction to the choking repression of their society as well as a result of pragmatism - when your latest lover may be hauled off to a concentration camp without you ever even finding out, there's not much room for stable monogamy.
-   Present and discussed in _Less_. There _are_ a pretty decent amount of one-night stands, but they are there for a reason. Arthur, the main character, is a single gay man in his late 40s, and he struggles with his identity because of his lack of a partner and his residual Survivor's Guilt after the AIDS crisis.
-   Downplayed in _The Secret History_. Francis Abernathy is the only explicitly gay character while the rest are either Ambiguously Gay or Ambiguously Bi, and he is the only one in the main cast who is mentioned having regular hook ups (Richard also has a few but implied to be far less). One of the first things he says to the Richard is "Cubitum eamus?" which is Latin and roughly translates to "Shall we go to bed?" However sex isn't something he talks about due to being in the Transparent Closet and he seems to still care about his studies and avoiding the police more.
-   Played with in Redfern Jon Barrett's _Proud Pink Sky_. The Gay Republic officially idealises same-sex marriage and monogamy; however, not everyone adheres to these standards.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Dante's Cove_ is made of this trope. Kevin and Toby are probably the most monogamous in the cast, with only a couple of "slips" from each of them.
-   _Dates_: Subverted as Erica infers that she believes Kate has had a lot of lesbian sex and has introduced a lot of women to it. Kate drops her hard exterior, shyly replying that it won't be anywhere near as many as she's thinking. Neither is depicted as more promiscuous than the straight couples.
-   In the _Degrassi: The Next Generation_ episode "Moonlight Desires" Marco catches his boyfriend Dylan in bed making out with another guy. Dylan tells Marco that he wants to be free to have an open relationship and see other people as well as Marco. Marco says no so they break up because Dylan would rather have multiple partners than have Marco.
-   _Dix pour cent_: Hervé's definition of not having had sex in ages is six days. In the season 2 premiere he denounces fidelity as an idea, calling it "hetero-conservative thinking" and saying that everyone's body belongs to themselves and not their partners.
-   Lampshaded and played with by Shane in _Faking It_, who tell Amy who's confused about her gender preference that while gay men are sexually aggressive and only looking to hook up most lesbians want to bond and nest build. Averted with another gay character who wants a monogamous relationship with Shane.
-   _Fellow Travelers_:
    -   Played Straight with Hawkins Fuller, who's promiscuous and does Gay Cruising for one-night stands at public washrooms or gay bars. This habit continues when he's in his late 60s in 1986. He informs a doctor that he has sex with men 3 or 4 times a year, and it's never the same man twice if he can help it.
    -   Lampshaded by the gay Marcus Gaines when he tells Timothy Laughlin that he and Hawk "prefer sex without emotional entanglements."
    -   Averted with the monogamist Tim and discussed in episode 3. He disagrees with Hawk's statement that they hide who they sleep with and that everyone has something to hide, because "it's not who we sleep with, it's who we love." He wants nothing more than to have a normal romantic relationship with Hawk.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Downplayed by Ser Loras Tyrell; he is rather easily seduced by an attractive male prostitute, and exchanges significant glances with the openly bisexual Oberyn Martell not long after his lover Renly Baratheon is killed. He mostly comes across as this in comparison to his literary incarnation, who falls into a deep depression after Renly's death, is apparently celibate, and shows signs of being a Death Seeker.
    -   Played Straight in "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken", when Olenna declares, "Renly Baratheon shagged half the stableboys in the Seven Kingdoms." However, we never actually _see_ him have sex with anyone except Loras.
-   Several variations show in up in _Glee_:
    -   First it's inverted with Kurt, who was the only one of the New Directions boys who was still a virgin until early third season while everyone else was getting around. He lost it to Blaine, who in turn was also a virgin at the time.
    -   Played with in Santana's case who slept her way through the entire football-team before coming to terms with the fact that she is gay, got a girlfriend, went monogamous, and stayed that way.
    -   Brittany's situation is similar to Santana's. While she has almost certainly slept with nearly every boy in the school and more than a few girls, she is fully comfortable with her bisexuality and could date a girl just as easily as a guy.
    -   Played straight (ahem) with Sebastian.
-   Subverted in an episode of _The Good Wife_. The prosecution tries to paint a gay couple's marriage as not real because the two men have an open relationship. Lockhart & Gardner respond by revealing that one of the prosecution's witnesses serially cheats on his wife, in an attempt to show equivalency (and thereby invoke the Equal Protection Clause against the prosecution's attempt to invoke the Defense of Marriage Act in an evidence ruling where a straight couple would be protected).
-   13 on _House_. Almost immediately after she was revealed to be bisexual, she started picking up one-night stands, and eventually became involved with Foreman. This behavior stemmed from the knowledge that she was slowly dying, and eventually she accepts her shortened lifespan. She is later shown settling down with another woman by the time she leaves the show for good.
-   Inverted with Barney and his gay brother on _How I Met Your Mother_ — at first it appears that his brother is as much of a hedonistic swinger as he is, but then Barney finds out that he's settled down and engaged to be married. Naturally, Barney is horrified that his brother has gone monogamous. It's probably no coincidence that Neil Patrick Harris, who plays Barney, is gay and in a committed relationship in real life. In fact, the episode aired around the time he came out of the closet. But then played straight in a later episode that revealed that they're separating, because Barney's brother had been cheating _at least_ twice a day for some time, despite being married and having children.
-   _The L Word_ gets accused of fostering this image despite having a few committed couples considering how much bed-hopping goes on, with Shane having the most. As a result, there's a fair number of real-life lesbians who despise the show for it, among other reasons, and it doesn't help that by the end of the show nearly every relationship was ended.
-   Inverted in _Motherland: Fort Salem_. The heterosexual characters, Abigail in particular, are significantly more promiscuous than the openly lesbian Raelle, who has a single romance in the series (which doesn't go smoothly). She even ends up spending Beltane platonically hanging out with a gay male witch on the periphery of an orgy, neither one of them having anyone better to do.
-   On _My Name Is Earl_, Kenny becomes this after his Coming-Out Story in the Pilot, especially after some Flanderization. Though he _does_ get into a couple of monogamous relationships during the series.
-   _Never Wipe Tears Without Gloves_ shines a light on this. In the eighties, this trope was generally believed to be true of gay men which in combination with the rapid spread of AIDS was used against them. The characters in the series land on both sides of the prejudice. Paul Really Gets Around and as much as Rasmus loves Benjamin he wants an open relationship. Benjamin, on the other hand, only sleeps with Rasmus and Seppo and Lars-Åke are in a monogamous relationship. The book series gives a lot more depth to the trope. For the majority of the promiscuous characters, the desire to sleep around is rooted in the knowledge that they're not accepted outside of their own community. Casual sex with other men becomes a way to express their sexuality after so many years of hiding it.
-   _Noah's Arc_: Played straight with Ricky, though some Character Development over time helps to give him a bit more depth.
-   Subverted on _The Other Two_:
    -   Carey stops his Friends with Benefits relationship with his roommate because he feels exploited.
    -   Carey presumes the Instagays are promiscuous and fooling around with one another when they are religious virgins and one of them is straight. They just like hanging out in speedos and taking pictures of each other's bodies.
-   Stuart on the original version of _Queer as Folk (UK)_ even told Vince he wasn't really gay, but "a straight guy who has sex with men", because he preferred monogamy to sleeping around. It's even worse in the American version (pictured above), where there are two monogamous couples, and the rest seem to wake up in a new bed every day, and in one of these couples the term "monogamous" has rather wide definitions. Any gay couple who chooses to settle down is accused of conforming to heterosexual norms or turning into "lesbians" by Brian. Only Brian really disbelieves in monogamy, but Justin tries to change him.
-   Nicky and Big Boo in _Orange Is the New Black_ both seem to have very high sex drives and though they both were monogamous at some points (Nicky with the 'prison gay' Morello, and Boo with a series of 'Mrs. Boos'), they start to sleep around a lot after that, often causing 'cliterference' between them, which resulted in staging a fucking contest. That said, there are also plenty of lesbian characters in the series who aren't promiscuous at all.
-   _Oz_: Defied in Richie Hanlon's case, though some of the other inmates do treat him like he's one.
    
    **Hanlon:** I only suck the cocks I _wanna_ suck.
    
-   _Political Animals_: T.J. uses a Grindr-like smartphone app to hook up with a guy in the first episode and has several other one-night stands, plus a longer-term affair with a married senator. However, the lesbian Supreme Court Justice is extremely committed to her ailing partner.
-   Brian Kinney on _Queer as Folk (US)_ is built of this trope. All of the other gay lead characters are promiscuous to varying degrees, with Michael and Ben being the most monogamously inclined. The sole lesbian couple is monogamous, although Lindsey does wind up having an affair... with a man.
-   In _The Savage Eye_, the homophobic Mick 'The Bull' Daly claims that all 'quaaares' will try to trick you into 'riding' them.
-   In one episode of _Sex and the City_, an Australian gay guy explains that he's in an open relationship with his partner, the rules for pickups being "no last names, blow-jobs only" on the basis that it's "unrealistic" to expect monogamy from a gay guy.
-   Played with on _Schitt's Creek_ with David and Patrick.
    -   Pansexual David often references the numerous partners from his past and he shows no shame about this. His straight sister also talks about her multiple past partners with pride and no shame at all. However, it's also heavily implied that David's promiscuity was in part due to his getting used and dumped all the time.
    -   Patrick, however, has only ever been with David and the handful of girls from his past. David worries about this and even suggests Patrick see other people so that down the line he won't feel like he missed out. When Patrick agrees to a date with a younger, handsome man, David begins to rethink his offer but it turns out that Patrick can't go through with it because he's in love with David.
    -   In Season 6, David and Patrick consider having a threesome with local polyamorous, bisexual hunk Jake. They go over to his apartment but are nervous. When it turns out that Jake had invited them to what appears to be an orgy with both men and women attending, including their female best friend, they politely leave before the festivities begin.
-   Played with in _Sirens (US)_. At first, it seems like Hank plays this trope straight. However, over the course of the show, it becomes clear this is actually a sign that his last breakup is still bothering him more than he's willing to admit. One episode finally has him reach an epiphany and admit he wants a serious, committed relationship.
-   Played with in _Six Feet Under_. David and Keith were not above giving their plumber a blowjob just because, and the local gay men's choir is used basically as a sex club. Further, when Keith has a security job that takes him out of town, they mutually agree that each may have unlimited one-night stands as long they don't sleep with the same guy more than once. They eventually change their minds by the end of the series after deciding that the lack of monogamy was doing more harm than good to their relationship and become completely monogamous.
-   _Stargate Universe_:
    -   Inverted. The straight characters have a fair amount of relationship drama, and the sole gay couple (Wray and Sharon) have the most stable relationship on the show.
    -   In the Alternate Universe episode "Epilogue", where the crew was stranded on a planet, eliminating any chance that they might ever be reunited with their loved ones, Wray mentions that while she had gone on a couple of dates with another woman since being stranded, her love for Sharon was getting in the way, providing a rare case of a homosexual character choosing to remain celibate despite having the option for a relationship.
-   In the _Supernatural_ episode "LARP And The Real Girl", Charlie Bradbury says she became queen of Moondoor for the girls. She makes eyes at quite a few maidens and an actual fairy.
-   _Trinkets_: Inverted. Out of the main trio, it's the _straight_ girls that are sexually experienced and the lesbian that's a clueless virgin at first. The other two lesbian women on the show aren't promiscuous either.
-   An old MTV late-night series called _Undressed_ had one gay character (who seemed to be trying to "convert" his roommate) explain this as something of a perk for being gay. His logic was while women are conditioned from a young age not to put out, guys are conditioned/encouraged to be more promiscuous and thus have less reluctance to sex in general, ergo it's easier to have sex if you're a gay man than a straight man because the target is more willing.
-   Jack on _Will & Grace_ (Arguably every character on that show. Even the straight ones.)
    -   Lampshaded in this exchange from an episode where Will's in a small town, looking to buy a home:
        
        "Me and the guys were wondering... being gay and all, since there's no women around to say no... you must be just doing it all the time, right?"  
        "Oh, nah. I'm sure I don't do it any more often than you do, probably.  
        "Well that sucks. Pfff, why be gay?"
        

    Music 

-   Completely torn apart in "Spring Break Anthem" by The Lonely Island. It's a song praising all kind of "cool", immature, and irresponsible behaviors of questionable morality like binge drinking, sex with lots of women, taking drugs, vandalism, being all out disrespectful to women, and gay marriage. Which is portrayed as the total opposite.
    
    _Trashing hotel rooms, clogging up toilets,_  
    _Beer goggles, if she's a hag._  
    _Planning the menu, picking out flowers,_  
    _Nailing sluts, and writing our vows!_'
    

    Theatre 

-   _Always Plenty of Light at the Starlight All Night Diner_ Sam has a lot of one-night-stands despite being in love with Jessa.
-   _Angels in America_ has Armored Closet Gay Roy Cohn, whose many sexual encounters with men are the reason he's dying of AIDS. It also contains an aversion in that we are never told much about Prior's sexual history despite him being who has AIDS but is implied to have been faithful to Louis (except for the one time that was supposedly when he got infected), but Louis is said to have played around in the past. It's later implied Prior has been letting Louis screw around ever since he got AIDS, which is made all the more heartbreaking when Louis leaves him.
-   This trope is a focal point in _The Normal Heart_. Many gay men refuse to give up sex even though it may be the way the then-unknown AIDS is transmitted.

    Video Games 

-   While not involving sex specifically, Oshare Bones from _Puyo Puyo_ is rather flirtatious despite claiming to be waiting for a reunion with his long-lost lover. One of his victory quotes against Ocean Prince in _Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary_ asks for the prince to "invite a lot of nice gentlemen" to the ball he would be hosting; in the same game, Oshare also expresses interest in Lemres, Satan, and Zoh-Daimaoh, even suggesting that he and Zoh go out on a date sometime.

    Visual Novels 

-   The lion Darius from _Extracurricular Activities_ hooks up with different guys every week, and takes pride in touting the number of hookups he's had, as much for the dismayed reaction of his (exclusively homosexual) teammates as for puffing up his own image. The trope is driven to near-parodic heights with the (offscreen) revelation that the contact photos in Darius' phone for his hookups are all dick pics, rather than their faces - these relationships are all purely for physical pleasure. As events in his route progress, his attachment-free lifestyle is called into question when a sudden upheaval leaves Darius in need of support, but with barely anyone to turn to. Darius' route later explores his lack of experience with _emotional_ intimacy, which leaves him confused and vulnerable when he inevitably finds himself attracted to the player character.
-   Zig-zagged in _Yearning: A Gay Story_. On one hand, Dan and his roommate Nate have sex with any and all willing males and want to remain non-exclusive even after they genuinely fall in love with other men. On the other hand, all the other dateable guys in the game completely avert this trope with Jake, Carlos, James, and Adam preferring to develop an emotional connection before getting to the sex and having had very few or zero past hook-ups with other men because of relationship and/or sexuality hangups.

    Webcomics 

-   This is a big part of _Blur the Lines_. Though the main characters Rick and Drew are partners, they frequently seek out sex with other men. They are also both OK with the other's promiscuity, leading to a My Girl Is a Slut scenario.
    -   Subverted, though, when Rick refuses to feel up a man because he thinks the man's bitter ex-boyfriend may be watching them.
-   In _Fans!_, Meighan's skirt-chasing is her biggest weakness (and was, for some time, her only real personality trait). Ally even depended on this as part of her plan to Break Rikk's Heart To Save Him — in fact, it was the only part of the plan that worked. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   A great running gag of this trope is Batuo, the main gay Asian in _Tales Of A Gay Asian_, though he tends to like big fat meaty...white guys.
-   A minor example from _Questionable Content_ - one character lives in a girl's liberal arts college dorm with high concentration of lesbians, who exist in a state of constantly shifting Love Dodecahedron. She is also part of it, but later on expresses reservations about being in that situation, eventually hooking up in a monogamous relationship with a girl outside the college. Later on, Marten's gay father is introduced and actually proposes to his long term boyfriend, so it seems that not _all_ (or even most) gays are promiscuous in the QC verse.

    Web Original 

-   Zig-zagged in _Hazbin Hotel_. The major character Angel Dust plays this trope up to the hilt; he's a mobster/porn star who flirts with every male character in his line of sight (he even provides a video example for this very page). However, Vaggie is also homosexual and in a loving and committed relationship with Charlie (who is herself bisexual), and her only real sign of promiscuity is Word of God that she was a prostitute in life. So it's less that gays in general are sluts and more that _Angel Dust_ is one.
-   Invoked in _Helluva Boss_ S2E3 "Exes and Oohs". Moxxie's father Crimson seems to be under the impression that not only is his son not actually Happily Married to Millie and is instead using her as a cover for his gayness, but also that "The Gays" like decorating every flat surface of their house with dildos, as he reveals to a clearly horrified Moxxie.
-   Complicated in the Whateley Universe. Poe Cottage, which is the LGBT dorm at Superhero School Whateley Academy, does have some gays who are taking advantage of this. But they're teenagers who have only just been allowed to express themselves, and they have a like-minded roommate. On the other hand, other gay kids are refraining from sex completely, or staying in monogamous relationships. Saladin, the only gay boy who has a point-of-view storyline, is strictly monogamous and seldom even sees his boyfriend.
-   Zigzagged in Where the Bears Are. Nelson and Todd are strictly with each other, but most of the other main characters are not in exclusive relationships, even the married ones..
-   Any male character (most notably Drew Pickles from _Rugrats_) appearing in a Barney Bunch video (including sister series Secret Missing Episodes) is depicted as a promiscuous homosexual who will be willing to have sexual intercourse with anything, consensual or not.
-   In _Trapped In The Birdcage_ if you are an attractive male, Saturn will hit on you.
-   The stereotype of gay men wanting to bang everyone who's male is a frequent recurring gag in _Queer Duck_. Two notable instances are in "Oh Christ!", where Queer Duck berates another man for having only slept with seven men in his lifetime, and "Wedding Bell Blues", where Queer Duck clarifies a long list of situations where he may be unfaithful to Openly Gator when they exchange vows on their wedding day.

    Western Animation 

-   One episode of _Drawn Together_ had Xandir go on and on about having had a LOT of gay sex in his life, even though he had only been out of the closet for a season and was not shown to have had many partners. Less egregious than other examples since _Drawn Together_ has next to no continuity anyway and _everyone_ is a massive pervert except (sometimes) Clara, so it has less to do with his sexuality and more that _everyone_ is a sex fiend.
-   As mentioned elsewhere on this wiki, _Family Guy_ used to terrible effect in an episode where Peter is given an injection that makes him gay. The supposedly pro-gay rights episode presents the injection as making him hyper promiscuous and being even less interested in supporting his children than usual, which is saying something. One of the gags in the episode is predicated on the idea that every gay man will have sex with strangers _in public_ unless given very specific instructions not to. It also implies that any gay guy would be totally willing to have an 11-way with strangers. It would've been better if it were only Peter like this because it would make sense for straight Peter to want an 11-way with 10 ladies, but it's still pretty bad.
-   _The Nutshack_ takes this to its logical extreme and depicts every homosexual male character as a creepy rapist.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Parodied when Homer, as a love counselor, advises the men who want to break up with their dance partner in a gay club to simply turn to their right.
    -   Also, in another episode, Moe turns his bar into a gay-friendly bar and pretends to be gay himself so that the gay community accepts and respects him. Waylon Smithers, knowing the truth, asks Moe if he finds him attractive, to which he responds: "Oh, yeah, yeah. Like all gays, I'm attracted to all men." Parodied afterwards when Comic Book Gay calls this "the most insidious stereotype ever", but then when another guy from the crowd calls him cute and asks him out, responds: "Whoever said that, yes".
-   _South Park_:
    -   In the episode "D-Yikes!" Mrs. Garrison thinks this is true of lesbians and tries to hit on one who's clearly spoken for. When the town was hit by the metrosexual trend, the then-male Mr. Garrison was eager to spend some quality time with one of any number of men he mistook for gay. Then again, this is _Mr. Garrison_ we're talking about here.
        
        **Chef:** Children, there's a _big_ difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison.
        
    -   Played straight with Mr. Slave, who managed to out-whore Paris Hilton.
