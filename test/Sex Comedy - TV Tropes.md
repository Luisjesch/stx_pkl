...or don't look. It's more polite, and keeps things SFW.

A wacky romp, usually full of fanservice, blunt innuendos, and simple plans all to one purpose — to get laid! Expect tons of Boob-Based Gag, humorous dating or hook up scenarios, and maybe a large dollop of Virgin-Shaming, or Sex as Rite-of-Passage if they still is. These can be explicit or non-explicit. The hijinks don't have to end after our hero or heroine gets laid.

Note that the proportion of sexual material can vary; jokes on other subjects are certainly permitted. A comedy series can have episodes of sex comedy while completely avoiding the subject at other times. Many of the examples below actually feature variants of the trope, or deconstruct it in some way. Conversely, when Porn with Plot tries to be funny, the result is obviously some kind of sex comedy, if not usually a very good one.

Many long-running sitcoms aimed at grown-ups will have an episode of sex comedy sooner or later, sometimes featuring an attractive visiting character or guest star who catches the attention of one or more of the primary cast.

Related to Poor Man's Porn, because you can own a copy of the film and no one will know it's one scene you own the film for.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _A.I. Love You_ starts off with the Unlucky Everydude getting a Magical Girlfriend due to a lightning strike hitting his computer, causing her to materialize into the real world, with some fan-servicey moments here and there. Then around the time Number 20 and 40 appear, there are _much_ more fan-servicey moments, Hitoshi is made out to be a huge pervert who only wants to get some nice action (whether it be from his computer program girlfriend or... actual Ecchi video games) and there's more jokes that go pretty far for an overall comedy series with tearjerky moments, including things like Hitoshi arousing Number 30 enough and pinching her nipple.
-   _Anoko to Iikoto_ is a collection of humorous NSFW stories about A-Cup Angst, Brother–Sister Incest, and other hentai fetishes.
-   _B Gata H Kei_ is about Yamada, a girl who aims to have 100 casual sex partners, even though she's still a virgin and is secretly insecure about it. When she meets an unremarkable boy, the rest of the series shifts to being about her making advances on him so he'll be her first, even though he's oblivious and she develops genuine feelings for him. Commentary is regularly provided by the Eros Deities, who are personifications of the characters' libidos.
-   _Booty Royale: Never Go Down Without a Fight!_ is a Work Com about adult models and porn actors. Also crosses over with Slice of Life, as well as being a Fighting Series since the main protagonist is a karate black belt.
-   _Dragon Pink_ is a Porn with Plot, the plot being a Role-Playing Game infused with Slapstick.
-   _Happy Mania_: A young woman sleeps her way into true love, with many semen jokes along the way.
-   _Interspecies Reviewers_ is about a group of adventurers who want to find out which species of Cute Monster Girl is best to have sex with, as they go to various brothels and write reviews of their experiences. The series takes a rather lax view of prostitution and is largely a fanservice-filled romp. While the manga doesn't actually show anyone having sex despite the premise revolving around it, the anime is much Hotter and Sexier.
-   _Junk Boy_ is basically "boner joke" the series. If the main character isn't popping a stiffie over some hottie he just met he's humping a hole into a _Colonel Sanders statue._ (No, that last part isn't made up, see Bennett the Sage's review of the anime for details.)
-   _Lunatic Night_: It's After the End, and the last human male has to repopulate the Earth with his new harem. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ is an Animated Shock Comedy about two fallen angels known as Panty & Stocking Anarchy. Panty has an obsession with having sex with as many men as possible, with a lot of jokes being made because of this. Stocking also has an active sex life even if subdued compared to Panty, being into bondage, with some jokes of her being Too Kinky to Torture.
-   _Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time_ is a comedy series about a man and his Unwanted Harem of Cute Monster Girls who keep trying to get him to have sex with them so he can give them strong children. While the Fanservice goes beyond what a typical ecchi series shows and it's very clear that sex _does_ happen, no actual sex is ever shown directly and it typically cuts to the morning after.
-   _Seitokai Yakuindomo_ is about 21% school Slice of Life jokes, 10% height jokes, and 69% sex comedy. Though here, the protagonist (and only male) is the Straight Man — it's the surrounding girls who provide all of the lust and sex jokes. Surprisingly, it's not actually Ecchi despite all the sex jokes, and the fanservice is pretty limited.
-   _Sex Demon Queen_: a hentai OVA that's also a Heroic Fantasy\-Magical Girl parody.
-   _Strange Love_: An odd series about a sexy redheaded schoolgirl who develops feelings for another student after breaking up with her rocker boyfriend. Tries to mix silly comedy antics with some genuine dramatic moments for... a rather unique experience.
-   _Very Private Lesson_ notably inverts a common set up of this genre by making the adult male teacher protagonist be the unlucky target of the infatuations of an underage teenage girl and forced into the role of her protector and guardian lest her mob boss father have him fitted for a pair of cement shoes. "Hilarity" ensues.
-   _Why the Hell Are You Here, Teacher!?_ is an ecchi series about Teacher/Student Romance. While full of fanservice, the only times sex is actually shown is in omakes (or in the case of the anime, the OVA).

    Comic Books 

-   Horacio Altuna's erotic fiction also includes a lot of comedy, usually a five-page set-up ending on a gag or punchline.
-   _Cheat(er) Code_ is fully an adult work about a gay Asian-American man finding himself thrown into a video game world.
-   _Money Shot_ is a Porn with Plot Space Opera about explorers finding aliens to make porn with.
-   _Red Ears_: This enormously successful Belgian comic book is nothing more than an erotic gag comic strip series.
-   _Sex Criminals_ is a series about two people who can freeze time when they have orgasms. They use this ability to rob banks so that they can use the money to save a library.
-   Much of the work of Icelandic artist Kjartan Arnorsson is a comedic core wrapped in a thick layer of pornographic shenanigans, where the context may be sexual but the execution is often presented as silly, almost cartoonish antics.

    Fan Fiction 

-   _New Tamaran_: The author wrote two prequels that are lemon examples; the sex scenes are described as a Random Events Plot combining Bizarre Alien Biology and Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex, with Robin being made into both a Sex God and an Iron Butt Monkey.
-   _Sword Art Online Chapter 16.5_: This infamous exercise in Ikea Erotica has been widely shunned by the fandom, yet it's still made many readers laugh by being So Bad, It's Good.
-   The NSFW _RWBY_ fanfic _Love Hurts_ is a series of loosely connected drabbles regarding the sex lives (and attempted sex lives) of various pairings. The primary pairings are Blake/Yang (more sexually adventurous than is probably healthy), Ruby/Oscar (young and stupid and with no idea what they're doing), Weiss/Jaune (Friends with Benefits), Nora/Ren (Like an Old Married Couple), and Qrow/Winter (Slap-Slap-Kiss), but there are a few other random Crack Pairings that are vaguely in continuity with the rest. Jacques and Willow Schnee separately cheated on each other with the same "maid" (actually an assassin), Cinder ended up hooking up with Taiyang without knowing he was Yang and Ruby's father, and Salem watches everything through her crystal ball and gets _very_ drunk over the stupidity of it all.
-   _Orange Rose Gathering_, a spinoff Fusion Fic of the _Blossomingverse_ and _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ focuses on a Hormone-Addled Teenager Chloe Cerise as she goes on a working vacation in Pallet Town, where she meets many, _many_ of Ash's siblings during his family reunion, with plenty of Fanservice and hilarity all over the place.

    Films — Animation 

-   Ralph Bakshi 's _Fritz the Cat_ also falls in this category.
-   _Tarzoon The Shame of the Jungle_ puts sex into blunt parody.

    Films — Live-Action  

-   _Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask_ and _A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy_ by Woody Allen.
-   A lot of Mel Brooks' films fall in this category, despite sex not being the central theme; they tend to have a lot of sexual innuendo in their jokes.
-   _Alice in Wonderland: An X-Rated Fantasy_: A sex comedy musical with actual sex scenes.
-   _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_: The clue is in the title.
-   The _American Pie_ series is fairly definitive of the genre.
-   _Another Gay Movie_ and its sequel _Another Gay Sequel: Gay's Gone Wild_, unsurprisingly.
-   The _Austin Powers_ movies, being _James Bond_ parodies, riff nonstop on the _Bond_ movies' sexual content.
-   _Belle Époque_: A cheerful comedy in which an affable young man lives for a while with a rich dude and the rich dude's four hot daughters. He winds up working his way through all four hot daughters — and one of them is Penélope Cruz.
-   _The Birds, the Bees and the Italians_: A bunch of Italian bourgeoisie has affairs with each other's spouses, take mistresses, and have unfortunate experiences with a underage nymphet.
-   _Deep In the Valley_, where two average dudes are sucked into the world of porn films.
-   _Eating Out_
-   _Fast Times at Ridgemont High_: '80s teen sex comedy.
-   _French Fried Vacation_: The first entry of this Vacation Film series (released in 1978) features much nudity and sex-related gags. The following two meanwhile largely avoided this and went for Slapstick.
-   In _Hot Bot_, two sexually repressed and unpopular teenagers discover a lifelike super-model Sexbot. Thrilled at the chance to finally have sex, Huffy and Nard go to great lengths to protect their newest discovery.
-   _The Last American Virgin_
-   _Losin' It_, a 1983 comedy about teenage boys making a trip to Tijuana to lose their virginity.
-   _Love & Other Drugs_: A higher drama quotient, but still in the category.
-   _Mischief_, a 1985 comedy where a shy high school student wants to get it on with a popular girl in 1956 Ohio. Basically, it's Happy Days with sex in it.
-   _Not Another Teen Movie_, a parody of both this genre and teen movies. Most visibly pronounced with Areola, a Foreign Exchange Student who spends the entire film butt-naked.
-   _The Naked Gun_ movies, at least once a film, will parody dramatic Hollywood sex/romance scenes.
-   _No Hard Feelings_
-   _The Pink Panther_ has a fair number of sexual jokes, even though no one really gets any.
-   _Poltergay_ - A married couple inherits a house inhabited by five disco era gay ghosts. They like to draw penises and spy on the couple when they have sex.
-   _Porky's_ is the Trope Codifier for the Teen Sex Comedy subtrope.
-   _Pretty Cool_, and its sequel, _Pretty Cool Too_.
-   _Private School_ is another '80s comedy featuring various sex-related hijinks at a girls' private school.
-   _Promises! Promises!_: A sex farce involving accidental wife swapping, possible adultery, a dorky dude worried about his impotence, lots of dirty double entendres, and naked Jayne Mansfield.
-   _Sexual Chemistry_ is a 1999 soft-core porn film, but with an essentially comedic central idea (a scientist accidentally invents a drug that causes him to temporarily change sex) and a fair number of jokes accordingly.
-   _Superbad_ is a Deconstructive Parody of the genre, with the protagonists' obsession with getting into the pants of the hottest girls at school used to paint them as a bunch of weirdos.
-   _The Sweetest Thing_: It's like a chick flick was directed by the guys who direct Rob Schneider's films.
-   _Scary Movie_: Not officially, but since the Hormone-Addled Teenager is a key component of the Slasher Movie formula being parodied, there is plenty of sex gags that redefines "over the top".
-   _Sound Eroticism_ is mainly a satire of Hungary in the 1980s, but, as its title suggests, has plenty of sex-related humor.
-   _Striptease_ is a film in which the heroine is a stripper, some of whose fans fixate on her.
-   _The Woman in Red_ crosses this with Romantic Comedy. It is about a man pursuing a woman, has a soundtrack by Stevie Wonder, and the most famous scenes involve seeing up the woman's dress and seeing her naked in her bedroom.
-   The film _Yes, God, Yes_ is about a repressed Catholic School Girl discovering the wonders of masturbation while attending a religious youth retreat.
-   Either the premise of _Young People Fucking_ is obvious, or we're all just lying to ourselves.
-   _Zapped! (1982)_, a parody of _Carrie_ in which a teenage boy gains telekinetic powers and uses them to strip girls naked.

    Live-Action Television 

-   _Brass_: Most of the lead characters are highly lecherous, leading to a lot of sexual plots and sub-plots.
-   _Dream On_ is very much sex comedy, albeit with a gimmick.
-   _Sex Education_: Can probably be termed more of a Sex-Dramedy. It's very funny, and sex in some form or another is usually the subject, but it treats the characters' emotional journeys with utmost seriousness. The protagonist is actually a teenaged amateur sex-counselor, who tries to help his fellow classmates, for a fee. His mother is actually a professional (and licensed) sex therapist.
-   _Sexify_: A Polish TV series about a tech student who develops an app meant to make sex more enjoyable for women.

    Music 

-   Most musicians know better than to make this a schtick. Thankfully, Bloodhound Gang does not.

    Theatre 

-   The Ancient Greek play _Lysistrata_ demonstrates that the sex comedy is Older Than Feudalism.
-   In the 19th century, Georges Feydeau not only popularized farce in the modern form, but was quite risqué about it by the standards of the time; many of his stories have elements of sex comedy, and the combination has remained popular in theatrical farce to the present.
-   "Nothing On", the Show Within a Show in _Noises Off_, is a Feydeau-style sex farce. As we only ever see the first act, we don't get to see how it develops, but the young ingenue spends most of the act stripped to her underwear and one of the male leads hops around with his pants around his ankles.

    Video Games 

-   _Leisure Suit Larry_ is an Adventure Game by genre, but by content, it's a Sex Comedy with logic puzzles.
-   _Monster Prom_ is a competitive Dating Sim in which your Lovable Sex Maniac playable character tries to score a date for prom, the quest being full of innuendos and several characters being very open about their sexuality as well as Everyone Is Bi.

    Webcomics 

-   Among (non-porn) webcomics, _Ménage à 3_ is perhaps the purest example, although it's _relatively_ subtle and even deconstructive about it — some of the time, anyway.
    -   Of its spinoffs, _Sticky Dilly Buns_ and _Pixie Trix Comix_ are more or less equally sex comedies (especially the former) but dial back on the explicitness and add a little more Soap Opera, while _Sandra on the Rocks_ is less about sex and somewhat less explicit (despite the odd Shower Scene and a fair bit of nudity with careful use of the Scenery Censor), but still approaches the trope at times; some of the later plots and Print Bonus material dial the sexual content back up a bit.
-   _Sabrina Online_ is mostly a Slice of Life Furry Comic story, but does slide into (relatively tame) sex comedy regularly (especially with the titular character's job as I.T. specialist for an adult film studio). Considering the series is a safe for work story set in the same universe as the author's NSFW stuff, one could argue its an overly complicated attempt to do Porn with Plot... with all the plot sequestered in the tamer wide audience series and the raunchier adult content depicted elsewhere.
-   _Oglaf_ primarily revolves around sex comedy in a High Fantasy setting. Unlike the aforementioned webcomic, it is quite explicit and occasionally pornographic. Not all of it though, and some jokes could easily fit into a SFW fantasy parody.
-   _The Rock Cocks_ is more of a Dramedy or Slice of Life story, but definitely has heavy sexual content.

    Western Animation 

-   The infamous 1929 cartoon _Everready Harton In Buried Treasure_ is a sex comedy.
