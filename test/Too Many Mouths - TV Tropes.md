Yogg-Saron is every dentist's worst nightmare.

**Sahjhan:** You'll get your money.  
**Arnie:** I've heard that one before. You know, I've got mouths to feed. Plus a family. Some of them have mouths, too.

In the same way that having extra eyes in unusual places can be unnerving, a creature with extra mouths can also be horrific, in a different way. The mouth is the organ of consumption, so a creature can be given extra mouths to show that it is a ravenous, hungry monstrosity. A massive paunch and lack of other sensory organs will create the image of an organism with no intelligence or purpose other than to eat.

To enhance the effect of the mouths, they may be equipped with More Teeth than the Osmond Family, or alternatively, might be gross and wide orifices with a thick tongue and smacking lips.

But there are many other ways to add mouths, and many places. They can be obvious or discreet, even hidden. They may even have special properties or powers. Their owner can be an Eldritch Abomination or a seemingly-normal human, or anything in between.

Sometimes the extra mouths will be able to speak separately, which probably isn't very useful for communicating, but allow Magical Incantations to be performed several at once.

A Super-Trope to Belly Mouth, Vagina Dentata, Nested Mouths. Sub-Trope to both Monster Mouth and Spare Body Parts. Compare Two-Faced and Multiple Head Case, contrast No Mouth.

    Video Games 

-   _Spore_: The creature creator allows many mouths to be affixed to a given creature. The abilities provided by mouths don't stack so the main reason for this trope is aesthetics. There is one practical application for multiple mouths with omnivores. They have one mouth with the highest Bite rating and one mouth with the highest Sing rating. Placing both types on the creature gives them both abilities at max level. An example is seen here with this creation. This creature has mouths and faces all over its body (tail, belly, legs, feet, etc...). Strangely, its main head is on one of its feet. As the creature evolves, some heads die, including its original small human head (which was killed by _its own feet_), but more form, including its torso’s head, which is actually located on what was once the belly (Cephalothorax). Mouths can also detach and form their own creatures.

-   In early versions of _The Sapling_, it was common for animals to evolve multiple different mouth types in sandbox mode so they could eat everything. While this can still be done, the Fight and Flight update rendered it Awesome, but Impractical due to the introduction of body part based pregnancy times.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Spirit Hunter: NG_, what marks a person as a participant in Kakuya's game are the extra mouths that appear on their body.
