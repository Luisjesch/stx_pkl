Sandal punk is a subgenre of the Punk Punk science fiction category. It focuses on the classical period or the ancient world before the Middle Ages, usually Ancient Rome, or Ancient Greece, or both, sometimes with hints of The Trojan War; or alternatively, on a Fantasy Counterpart Culture or Planet of Hats modeled on those settings. A closely related trope, known as Bible punk, combines Stone Punk and Sandal punk within an Egyptian or Middle Eastern setting.

See also Sword and Sandal.

     Comics  

-   Wonder Woman's island home of Themyscira has traditionally fallen under this trope; a utopian society of ancient Greek immortals who mix ancient religion with advanced discoveries. As originally conceived, Wonder Woman was created by the gods, trained in super-advanced martial arts and telepathy, and wielded a mixture of magical tools (like the her bracelet and lasso) and technological ones (like her invisible plane and the purple healing ray.) As time has gone on, the "ancient Greek" stuff has gotten more and more emphasized and the other stuff has increasingly fallen by the wayside.
-   The Bronze Age world of _Sláine_ combines Sandal Punk with Stone Punk.
-   _Asterix_: Modern appliances are often recreated with Bamboo Technology. For instance, chariots are treated exactly like cars, including tow trucks or mail vans versions of them. Or internal communications in an enterprise is recreated with slaves, waiting in desks to hear messages, then rush to repeat them.

All this while still possessing tribalistic characteristics such as a hunter/gatherer style of living.
