_"Oh, I haven't got the brains for argument, but I don't need them as long as my head is harder than his viscera!"_

— **Cindy Lou**, _Kiss the Boys Good-Bye_

It has been shown time and again, in cartoons, movies, and video games, that the best way to break something is by hitting it with your head. _Really hard._

We're not talking ordinary, run-of-the-mill headbutts here. Heck, we're not even talking about headbutts of love. When a character uses his head, they transform from ordinary bloke to full-on Battering Ram. The character may go into full on raging-bull mode, charging blindly ahead at whatever stands in his path. Or his companions may actually _pick him up_, using the blunt end of his skull to smash down whatever it is that needs smashin'. This can be an effective means of attack for some. For others, it's simply the easiest road to destruction. When somebody breaks out the cranial cannonball, the walls are going to come tumblin' down, 'cuz Ramming Always Works.

Strangely enough, a character who employs this technique never seems to get a concussion, or even a headache. This may be because he's a Big Guy or a Cloudcuckoolander — two character subspecies known for this trope — and for having very thick skulls, or maybe he's wearing Weaponized Headgear. (Genius Bruisers are, of course, an exception.)

Although the Trope Naming phrase doesn't _always_ precede incidences of this trope, if you utter it in the presence of the Big Guy or a Cloudcuckoolander in battle, you know exactly what you're likely to get.

Also see Headdesk, which is Using Your Head out of frustration, or Put Their Heads Together, when two characters get hit with each other's skulls. Compare Ass Kicks You. A signature move of the Violent Glaswegian, where it is called the "Glasgow Kiss". Headbutting Pachy is another related trope, drawing attention to a dinosaur with a reputation for doing this.

As Ram-Man himself said in one cartoon, Don't Try This at Home.

    Advertising 

-   Irn-Bru, the Scottish national soft drink, often has very unusual and sometimes comical ads. This particular one is definitely on the funny side, and plays to the Violent Glaswegian trope by featuring the iconic headbutt as delivered by a _vending machine._
-   One _Segata Sanshiro_ commercial features Segata doing a brick break in this manner to advertise the brainteaser game _Solo Crisis_. He even drops this trope's title (in Japanese, of course) after doing so.

    Asian Animation 

-   _BoBoiBoy_: In a giant game of checkers where the heroes and their enemies were used as game pieces, upon getting kinged, the square-headed alien Adu Du gets a taller head, with which he uses to whack away enemy pieces after "eating" them.

    Comic Books 

-   _Amulet_: Dagno manages to take down Gabilan via helmet-assisted aerial headbutt.
-   _Atari Force_: In the second series, Martin and Christopher Champion both attack the Dark Destroyer's humanoid form with their heads in separate confrontations. Christoper's attack turns out to be less effective than Martin's, however.
-   _The DCU_:
    -   _Batman_: In an early comic, Dick Grayson does this to a crook, complete with lampshading: "How's that for using my head?"
    -   _Earth 2_: During a fight with Superman's clone and Val-Zod, the clone face-butts Val and causes his own face to crack, revealing that he was a clone and not the real Superman.
    -   _JLA: A League of One_: Diana's means of defeating Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner) is to headbutt him once she is able to remove his ring from his hand.
    -   In _Supergirl_ story "Supergirls Super Pet", Streaky the Supercat headbutts an eagle to drive it away from some helpless chicks.
    -   _Superman_: In _Kryptonite Nevermore_, a corrupt tycoon head-butts Superman on the stomach. Of course, he knocks himself out. Remarkably (and stupidly), he tries this tactic after his goons break their hands by punching Superman, who had previously tanked cannon fire.
    -   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: In the Wonder Girl Impossible Tale in #111, a large whale knocks out Renno and a sea-centuar by ramming into them with its head, and is defeated by tricking it into ramming its own reflection until it knocks itself for a loop.
-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_:
    -   Donald Duck a number of times has resorted to ramming his head straight into the stomachs of bigger-sized enemies who have really enraged him, such as Neighbor Jones. This always works in taking his enemy down. Donald doesn't use this on anyone the same size as him, like Gladstone Gander.
    -   His Uncle Scrooge has also done this a few times.
-   _El Toxico_: El Toxico headbutts a giant bug during a battle with it.<small>◊</small>
-   _Gotlib_ has a wacky variant (it's Gotlib after all) which could either be shoehorned into this trope or would need a new subtrope with this entry as only element. So here goes nothing: An intellectual gets clobbered by a stone-age brute. He then holds his nose tight and blows until his brain flies out of his ear, hits the brute and scores a clean K.O. "Use your brain" indeed.
-   _Invincible_ once got both his arms broken by an extremely powerful adversary. So he beat him to death with his head. Or so he thought.

-   _Judge Dredd_:
    -   Mean Machine Angel is a berserker cyborg who attacks his opponents by ramming them with his metal plate head.
    -   Dredd himself used this to incapacitate a psychotic woman who was in love with him when he was handcuffed by smashing her with his helmet.
-   _Lucky Luke_: In _Going Up the Mississippi_, one of the hired trouble-makers Luke has to deal with is called Hardhead Wilson, whom is seen head-butting an alligator unconscious. Captain Barrows mentions even bullets have no effect on his skull.
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   _Spider-Man_: This is the trademark of the villain Hammerhead. Originally, he didn't even have superpowers, just a metal plate in his head that somehow made him tough enough to go up against the wallcrawler, though he's since become a Cyborg.
    -   _X-Men_: The Juggernaut uses this mode of attack as well. In the _Capcom vs._ series, it's his one and only Hyper Combo.
-   In _Nodwick_, Yeagar has used Nodwick as a battering ram to beat down doors on more than one occasion.
-   _Oz (Caliber)_: Hektor Hammerhead, one of the Freedom Fighters of Oz, is a member of the race known as the Hammer-Heads. Like all of his race, his big oversized head is flat on top, with a very smooth surface. his neck is incredibly long like elastic, stretching out like an accordion. He can shoot his necks out like the spring of a jack-in-the-box. This allows him to strike out at opponents with his head to knock them down hard.
-   _Strontium Dog_: For Middenface McNulty, this is practically his signature move. Though, given his reputation, he would probably like to refer to this as a Glasgow Kiss.
-   _The Ultimates_: Herr Kleiser has secured Captain America, but Cap fights dirty and does not shy away from any trick to regain the upper hand in a fight.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: In Chapter 13, Godzilla rams himself head-first into the Many construct in the sea, which is enough for him to make it lose its grip on Monster X.
-   _Ashes of the Past_: Played for Laughs when Ash's Charizard headbutts Brandon's Regirock right between the eyes.
    
    As there were seven of them, this required several headbutts.
    
-   _Doing It Right This Time_: Mari, despite being probably the most level-headed and mentally healthy pilot on the team, is still Hot-Blooded enough to try and headbutt _Ramiel_. (How she was even able to attempt this is a whole other trope.)
-   _Empathy_: Oh does this to end his fight with Smek during the climax. Afterwards, it hurts him too, and he admits that it's an awful fight move.
-   _Escape from the Moon_: In the sequel _The Mare From the Moon_, Spliced Genome’s reaction when Princess Celestia tries to keep her from leaving her bed is to headbutt the other mare and break her snout. (She apologizes later and heals it though.)
-   _A Force of Four_: U-Ban head-butts Power Girl when they brawl.
-   _The Gunslinger Hero: Flintlock_:
    
    -   Izumi does this during the USJ Attack, pulling Tomura Shigaraki halfway through one of Kurogiri’s portals before giving him a wound-up headbutt.

    Then he smashed his forehead against her own, and filled her head with pain.
    
-   In _Hellsister Trilogy_, Supergirl used the move as fighting Satan Girl for the first time.
    
    The purple-suited girl was going for Supergirl's eyes. Desperately, Kara grabbed her foe's wrists, kneed her in the stomach as hard as she could, and head-butted her in the forehead. It felt like banging her head into a steel wall, but she could see Satan Girl wince with the pain for a second.
    
-   _Here There Be Monsters_: During one battle, Mary Marvel flies right into Illyria's stomach.
    
    Angrily, Mary used her flight power and slammed her head into Illyria's stomach. The villainess groaned and doubled.
    
-   In the _My Hero Academia_ fic _Every Step of the Way_, Aizawa, left blind after a run in with a villain, is still unsure of his abilities. One of the criminals had escaped earlier and when he tried coming after Aizawa, Aizawa breaks out of the guy’s grasp by whipping his head backward into the guy’s chest.
-   _The Return-Remixed_: After the members of DEAR give Molly Holly a Mohawk as part of a Torture Interrogation. Molly then accompanied the Diva Army in their match against DEAR wearing a military helmet, which she used to headbutt the members of DEAR.
-   _Shinji And Warhammer 40 K_: It's called "the Ikari". It begins with a headbutt and it ends with the opponent on the ground crying for mercy. The best part of this is it was first used in a scene where EVA-01 loses the function of both its arms and only has its head.
-   In _TRON: Legacy_ story _A Survivors Tale_, Clu sends a captured Yori to the Games and, just to be a complete dick, puts her up against his champion (her Brainwashed and Crazy husband), figuring that she'll easily be de-rezzed. She's an engineer, not a warrior, after all. What Clu did _not_ expect was Yori figuring out the mechanics of the arena, getting into grappling range with "Rinzler", and using a headbutt to knock _both of them_ out, essentially ending the match in a draw.
-   _Thousand Shinji_: Asuka head butted a MP-Eva when she fought nine of them.
    
    A long blade slammed through right shoulder while another one skittered across her torso armour, looking for a gap to plunge in and begin ripping out her Eva’s guts. Asuka held off its other hands while it snapped at her face, drool flying off its shiny, metallic razor sharp teeth to splatter across Unit 02’s helmet.  
    Asuka head butted it.
    
-   _The Vampire of Steel_: Buffy uses a headbutt to get Zol-Am off her during their fight.
    
    She felt the strain of pushing Zol-Am away, felt his greater strength drawing her nearer.  
    So she stopped resisting him and brought their foreheads together with a bang.
    
-   In the _Star Wars Rebels_ story _A Sword to Pass_
    -   Done hilariously by Sabine. When she and Tristan are going on separate missions with their parents she yells "Helemt Check" and slams her head down on his. This disorients him and gets Sabine a scolding from their father. Tristan attempts to get her back, but she is ready for it and the impact doesn't have the same effect on her.
    -   During his fight with the saboteur, Tristan slams his head into the assailant’s own.

    Film — Animation

-   _BoBoiBoy: The Movie_: After Gopal gains the ability to transform his body into other materials, he bounces around like rubber before turning his head into diamond when he's headed for Gaga Naz's back, serving a solid head-butt from behind.
-   Disney:
    -   _Hercules_: Hercules lands his first attack on the centaur Nessus in this manner after Phil tells him to "use your head!"
    -   _Mulan_: Shan-Yu does this while fighting Shang. Shang doesn't suffer visible damage, but it takes him out of the fight quite effectively. And in a nice moment of realism, Shan-Yu's own eyes are shown to be momentarily unfocused after the blow.
    -   _Oliver & Company_: The titular gang plots to steal a radio from a Rolls Royce. Dodger calls upon Einstein to produce a fender bender, in a tone that indicates that Einstein has both experience and expertise in this regard. Einstein just broadsides the car with his head.
    -   _Zootopia_: When Nick locks a ram mook in the rear compartment of a train, they repeatedly bash their head into the door leaving it increasingly dented until Nick pulls a Door Judo move on them and their momentum causes them to run out the train window.
-   _How to Train Your Dragon_: Discussed by one of the Viking kids, though he doesn't get to actually do it. "I will cut off the legs of every dragon I see. _With my face_." Also discussed by Stoick.
    
    **Stoick:** When I was a boy, my dad told me to bang my head against a rock, and I did it! I thought he was crazy, but I didn't question him. And do you know what happened?  
    **Gobber:** You got a headache.  
    **Stoick:** That rock split in two!
    
-   _The Land Before Time_: Being a _Triceratops_, Cera does this a couple of times.
-   _Shrek_:
    -   Fiona has used headbutts to deal with men she finds distasteful, such as Robin Hood or Prince Charming.
    -   Princess Fiona's mother does this to walls twice in _Shrek the Third_. The second time she does it leaves her understandably disorientated. And humming "My Favorite Things".
-   _Toy Story 2_: When breaking through a vent that's been screwed shut, the fake Buzz tells Rex to "use your head". Cut to a shot of them running down the vent with Rex as a battering ram as he yells "But I don't wanna use my head!". Justified in that Rex is a toy and technically has no biological brain that can be damaged. Also, due to the bottom screws having been taken out, they just push the vent open like a flap. Subverted in the "outtake" of this scene where the grate is on too tight, and all of them just bash against it. "Ow", indeed.
-   In _Turning Red_, when they're both in panda form, Mei delivers a monstrous headbutt to Ming, knocking her unconscious.

-   In _Blade Runner_, Roy Batty enters the bathroom like this. Excusable as (a) he has superhuman strength, (b) he's playing it for shock value and (c) he really needs an adrenaline kick. It's not as silly as it sounds.

A troll charges at the wall of Dale with some sort of stone edifice on its head and bashes in a hole large enough for the orc army to pour through. Amusingly, the troll falls over after the impact, presumably knocked out cold. Dáin takes Dwarven hard-headedness to a new level, using his head as his preferred weapon even against enemies _wearing helmets_.
-   _The Horror of Party Beach_ features a whiter-than-white guy getting into a fight with some Hollywood-style biker thugs over a girl. At one point, the lead thug's compatriots pick him up and ram his head into the guy he's fighting.
-   _Internal Affairs_: Dennis Peck, a Dirty Cop, greets Raymond Avila, the IA officer investigating him, this way when the latter is about to get out of an elevator. The head butt is a prelude to the No-Holds-Barred Beatdown Peck gives Avila both physically and psychologically while they're both in the elevator.
-   _Interstellar_: Mann uses this to great effect against Cooper, resulting in the latter nearly dying from a Broken Faceplate. He does this even though Cooper points out there's an equal chance of breaking his own faceplate that way.
-   _Jack Reacher_. After being attacked by two incompetent criminals in a confined space, Reacher knocks down one guy onto another, then smashes the top guy's head into the bottom guy's until both are out.

-   _Avengers: Infinity War_: Tony ends up on the wrong end of this again, courtesy of Thanos.
-   _Avengers: Endgame_: Thanos tries this again in the final battle, except this time his target is Carol Danvers — who _completely tanks it._

    -   Deconstructed when Blart tries this on a minion only to hurt himself.
        
        **Blart:** Nobody wins in a headbutt.
        
    -   A _properly_ done headbutt (as in using the top of the forehead and targeting vulnerable areas) is probably one of the safest ways to strike. But doing it improperly (like, say, aiming at the _other_ guy's forehead instead of, say, face) means damaging your head and likely your brain.
-   _Red Eye_: Jackson Rippner hits Lisa Reisert in the face with his head to make her stop evading his questions... and is left legitimately puzzled when not only does it knock her unconscious, which is bad for his plan, but, in particular, when he realizes that his own forehead is bleeding. (In contrast to his apparently-genuine confusion over why holding her father hostage would cause her to act at all agitated, this may have contributed to the part where he gives her an aspirin when she wakes up, but only because he needs her to be able to think clearly.)

-   _Sherlock Holmes (2009)_: Subverted. Holmes is facing Giant Mook Dredger, proven to be pretty much Made of Iron in their last encounter. Suddenly Watson grabs Dredger from behind and shouts at Holmes to "Nut him!" Holmes runs up to Dredger, jumps up into the air and head-butts him, only to stumble backward, a stunned look on his face. Holmes then tries throwing a punch, but is so disoriented he slips and falls on his back.
-   In _Star Wars: The Last Jedi_, BB-8 tries to fix the circuits in Poe's X-Wing, but each time he bridges one with a tool, another one overloads. Finally, he just headbutts the panel, getting the weapons back online and giving himself a nice shock in the process.
-   In _Starter for 10_, one character attempts a headbutt on another in a moment of frustration, and knocks himself out. When he wakes up, another character snarkily explains that he has completely failed to understand the basic principle of the headbutt: "You're meant to hit the soft part of their nose with the hard part of your forehead, not the other way round."
-   _Suburban Commando_: One of the bad guys has the top of his skull replaced with a metal cap for this particular reason. Not to mention he looks patently ridiculous while doing so.
-   _The Three Stooges_ occasionally have a Hard Head stooge (often Curly, but once in a while Shemp) used outright as a battering ram.
-   _Tyranno's Claw_ has a pachycephalosaurus stumbling across a bunch of cavemen and headbutting them in self-defense, much like typical depictions of said dinosaur. One of the cavemen, in a Too Dumb to Live moment, tries headbutting the pachycephalosaurus' head with his _own_, and breaks his own skull in the process.

After being knocked off his horse by a knight wielding a mace, it appears to be all up for our vertically-challenged protagonist until he headbutts the knight's horse, ripping its guts open. The knight falls off and breaks several bones, forcing him to surrender to Tyrion.
-   _The Speed of Sound_: In _The Sound of Echoes_, Skylar snaps her head into her kidnapper's face, breaking his nose, while she's Bound and Gagged.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: Mace Windu does this to a guard twice his size who blocks his way in _Shatterpoint_. The guard taunts the "little Jedi" to draw his lightsaber.

    **Guard:** What you gonna do, think me to death? (_headbutt_)

    -   In _The Lord of the Rings_, Gandalf (jokingly, perhaps, although he was pretty cranky by that point and might well have done it) threatens to use Pippin's head as a battering ram to try to open the gates of Moria: "But if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will try to seek the opening words."
    -   _The History of Middle-earth_: Done by Ecthelion in _The Book of Lost Tales_/ _The Fall of Gondolin_ to kill Gothmog. Of course, at that point in time, Ecthelion has _lost both of his arms_ and has a great big spike on his helmet.
-   _Tasakeru_: Faun invented the story's equivalent of the Heavy Metal Headbutt by giving a Glasgow Kiss to a drunken, lecherous bar patron. Nicely Lampshaded.
    
    "Do you knowhow to do the 'headache?'"
    
-   _Warrior Cats_: In _A Light in the Mist_, Redwillow thinks he'll be able to take over Bristlefrost's body by headbutting her after having performed a "ritual". That's not how possession works, so it just results in a very confused Bristlefrost seeing stars.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Andor_:
    -   In the first episode, when a couple of corporate security goons are shaking protagonist Cassian Andor down, he gets one of them to walk right behind him, and then bashes the corpo in the nose with the back of his head.

        **Holtz:** Your punch could have been quicker... without so much to drink.  
        **Justine:** It's kind of a trade-off, because without that much to drink _\[head-butts Holtz\]_ hurts a lot more.

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Played with. One of Spike's minions asks him how to get into a locked room; Spike scornfully says "use your head!", grabs him by the scruff of the neck... and smashes his head into the compartment next to the door holding a fire axe.

The other cops assume he just snapped, as they didn't see the headbutt and he is well known to have a hatred for Dexter before he had a solid reason to. The whole thing was planned by Dexter to give Doakes even less credibility than usual.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Lodger": The Doctor is trying to explain to Craig why he's living in his flat, which is to investigate time disruptions coming from upstairs. Telling Craig would take too long, so the Doctor headbutts him for a very fast mind meld. Painful to both parties.

-   _Super Sentai_:
    -   _Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger_: Kyoryu Gray and his Zyudenryu partner Bunpachy are both based on a Pachycephalosaurus, and use this technique regularly. So do their counterparts in _Power Rangers Dino Charge_, which the Graphite Ranger refers to as "Pachy Punch" or "a royal headbutt".

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The Battering Ram — a finishing move used by several wrestlers, most notably The Bushwhackers, whose Finishing Move was _called_ the Battering Ram. Which was first used by Bobo Brazil (Houston Harris — a former baseball player), and called the Coco Butt, in 1950.
-   The diving head butt is mostly used by Samoan wrestlers, but to the world at large, Bam Bam Bigelow and Chris Benoit are probably the most famous users. The late Chris Benoit used to do this as a tribute to the Dynamite Kid, with much the same tragic results (severe brain trauma). Harley Race has gone on record as saying he wished he'd never invented the move (he'd actually just fallen from the top-rope head-first the first time, but subsequently did it intentionally).
-   The Junkyard Dog would comically get on all fours and repeatedly ram fallen opponents head-first. JYD was known for having a hard head. More than once, an opponent would headbutt him - only to hurt _themselves_ instead!
-   After losing a hair-vs.-hair match to one of the Von Erichs, Buddy Roberts of the Fabulous Freebirds took to wearing a wig with a boxing headgear to hold it on. During matches, Buddy would load a piece of metal into the headgear and headbutt his opponents with it.
-   In the late-1980's in WCW, there was a masked tag team called the Russian Assassins, managed by Paul Jones. Their finisher was for one of them to insert a piece of metal into their mask right at their forehead and headbutt their opponent with it.
-   In the mid/late-1980's, there was a wrestler named Jason The Terrible (a pro wrestling expy of Jason Voorhees) who was active in the Memphis and Calgary territories. He wore a hockey mask in the ring and would headbutt opponents with it.
-   Similarly, Memphis also had a wrestler named Lord Humongous, based the villain from _The Road Warrior_ who wore a hockey mask and put it to good use. He later became better known without the mask as Sid Vicious.
-   Hijo Del Santo is known as "El Rey de Tope" for his willingness to do diving head butts and flying battering rams (ironically, it would be a back injury that would put his career on hold). CMLL World Heavyweight Champion Rayo De Jalisco Jr was known for delivering multiple headbutts in rapid succession, though he had a bad habit of not looking during the last one, so if the opponent wasn't knocked senseless by the first 2-4 they could capitalize.
-   LLF champion Sadika's "cabezazo" is an enforced version, as she sandwiches an object between her and her opponent's head and butts it till it breaks.
-   Paige is another diva that uses headbutts, even incorporating a rather...Les Yay version as her signature move.
-   Drew McIntyre, upon his first release from WWE, began using a headbutt as a signature move. This continued after returning to WWE. As he is Scottish, the commentators will call it a "Glasgow Kiss," despite his being from Ayr.
-   Maki Itoh uses this as a big part of her gimmick: given that her having a big head was part of the reason her Idol Singer career didn't go anywhere, she frequently makes use of it in combat. Her signature move is to deliberately fall over and land onto a prone opponent, head first.

    Sports 

-   The danger of a concussion is why direct, intentional helmet-to-helmet collisions are not allowed in the NFL. Spearing, the practice of diving into another player helmet-first, is also illegal due to the risk of spinal injury. This practice gained a lot of notoriety during the 1990s, largely because safety Chuck Cecil was so fond of using it. Yes, before he was a controversial assistant coach often fined by the NFL for his actions, he was a controversial player who was often fined by the NFL for his actions.
-   Soccer is one of a few where the head can be used to score. On the other hand, headbutts on the adversary also occur:
-   Several martial arts allow and/or teach the use of headbutts.
    -   Headbutts are allowed in muay boran—an older form of Muay Thai— adding a ninth contact surface as opposed to the eight of muay thai. The headbutts are still used in Lethwei, a similar fighting style from neighbouring Myanmar.
    -   Capoeira employs spearing headbutts as one of the prime ways to show an opponent that they've left their mid-section open, particularly during cartwheels. It also enforces them during short clinches.
    -   Krav Maga and other self-defense styles love to use headbutts, they are simple, effective and can be life-saving.
    -   Some hybrid/full contact Karate rulesets allow headbutting. Among them it's famous the school of Daido-juku Kudo, whose practitioners are forced to wear a special mask. A similar case is done with combat Sambo.
    -   Even Judo used to contain headbutts as part of its forgotten striking part of atemi-waza.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Spelljammer_: Giff are large hippo-like humanoids that are available as a player character race in the setting.

-   Games Workshop games:
    -   In _Warhammer_, an 'Eadbutt is one of the randomly generated attacks that a Giant is able to deliver against larger opponents. In battle, such an attack can only cause a single wound but it dazes the target so that they are briefly unable to attack themselves.
    -   In _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_ Aleguzzler Gargants are able to unleash a devastating head-butt against their foes. Although it is their less accurate, when it hits this ‘Eadbutt is capable of doing far more damage than any of its other attacks.
    -   _Warhammer 40,000_:
        -   Orks, especially the members of the Goff clan, often resort to headbutts and headlong charges in battle, something enhanced by their tendency to wear horned helmets. Ghazghkull Thraka, the greatest Ork Warlord, had part of his cranium replaced with a bionic skull made from adamantium, with which he's able to deliver a powerful head-butt. Whether this is represented in the game rules changes from edition to edition.
        -   In _Necromunda_, fighters with the "Headbutt" Muscle<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> /Brawn<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Skill can choose to deliver a punishing headbutt against an opponent in close combat. How this is worked out depends on the edition with the first two editions requiring the fighter to give up at least two regular hits in combat while the 3rd Edition makes the headbutt attack a Basic action.

    Theatre 

-   In _Kiss the Boys Good-bye_ by Clare Boothe, Cindy Lou says, about her temper: "I do deplore it, but when I'm in a snit I'm prone to butt the object of my wrath plumb in the tummy."

She demonstrates it on Breed when he goes off on a tirade against the Deep South, and the blow to his stomach knocks the wind out of him.

        **Zeetha:** Oh sure, pirates have this whole _image_ thing. People fighting them get _nervous!_ They have these _expectations!_ It lets you use that, you know, that thing— where you mess with people's heads?  
        **Bang:** What— Psychology?  
        _\[Zeetha headbutts Bang by surprise\]_

    -   Robin tries to get the upper hand against Ben by having a mook knock him off balance and then smashing his face in while he falls. He's in for a nasty surprise when Ben ducks his head down so that Robin punches his cranium instead, fracturing a good amount of his finger bones.

-   _Transformers_:
    -   _The Transformers_: The Dinobot Slag does this on more than one occasion. One of the best instances would be when he rams Devastator in _The Transformers: The Movie_. Being a giant robot who transforms into a robot Triceratops is very useful for this. For this guy, Ramming Always Works.

-   The Decepticon Seeker Ramjet has a reinforced nosecone for doing this in vehicle mode. It counts because his nosecone is indeed part of his head. Ramjet actually did fail at this once — then again, he was trying to ram _Warpath_.

-   _Wakfu_
    -   One of the lessons that Sadlygrove's mentor, Goultard, tries to teach him is that he does actually need to use his head when he's fighting. One such lesson is making him fight Rubilax, a Shushu that gets bigger and stronger every time it's hit, meaning his usual tactic of "hit it 'til it stops moving" won't work. Once he actually starts using his brain, he manages to come up with a winning strategy: Headbutt the Shushu until it's so big that that it starts to sink into the sand and faces a real risk of choking to death. Goultard approves.
    -   Goultard himself also favors this tactic. In his special _Goultard the Barbarian_, he headbutts Katar so hard that a _crater_ forms underneath them. He does the same thing to Rushu in the series proper.
    -   Sadlygrove ends up teaching this lesson to his daughter Elely, who takes it to heart in her fights in Season 3, particularly against the Pandawa demigod Poo where she beats him into submission by repeatedly slamming her head into his face..

    Real Life 

-   If you're in a close grapple with someone, it's not a bad idea to use your forehead to smear your opponent's nose across his face. You may end up a little dazed but, if you did it right, he'll be much worse off; out of all possible ways to do it, headbutts are probably the single easiest way to break someone's nose by a long shot. Same goes for opponents with glasses; if you headbutt someone wearing them, they're all but guaranteed to wind up broken beyond repair.
    -   It's also effective if you're grabbed from behind, as you can get a lot of momentum by tilting your head all the way forward and swinging it back.
    -   The strongest part on the human skull is, in fact, the center of the forehead. This is naturally the best place to headbutt someone else with. Keeping your neck, back and head together in a straight line as you headbutt will also help your brain shake less from the impact.
-   The animal kingdom has its share of bad-ass headbashers:
    -   Check out giraffes. Yes, _giraffes_. Giraffes are basically the living version of Epic Flail. Don't believe me? Just look at this. Yeah, you go and say giraffes aren't badass. We'll be over here where it's safe.
    -   Paleontologists believe that the dinosaurs known as pachycephalosaurs (whose name means "thick-headed lizard") used its thick-skulled head this way (in fact, several species show injuries on their skulls that could have only been caused by using their heads as weapons), although _how_ is often debated. Some believe they smashed their heads together in head-on collisions like modern musk oxen or bighorn sheep, other think they engaged in head-shoving contests, and still others think they engaged in flank-butting like giraffes.
    -   The carnivorous dinosaurs _Carnotaurus_ and _Majungasaurus_ have been speculated to do this as well by some palaeontologists, due to their unusual thick, horned skulls. In fact, _Majungasaurus_' was originally mistaken for a species of pachycephalosaur when it was discovered because of the thickness of its skull.
    -   Some chalicotheres (an unusual extinct group of mammals related to horses and rhinoceroses), like _Tylocephalonyx_, may have engaged in head-butting contests, based on their thick-domed skulls.
    -   Tapinocephalids like _Moschops_ were bulky therapsids (aka "mammal-like reptiles") that often possessed thick skulls, and occasionally horns. Scientists believed that males used them to engage in head-shoving contests, similar to buffaloes.
    -   The extinct giraffe relative _Discokeryx_ had a thick-skulled cranium and thick neck bones with complex head-neck joints, leading scientists to believe it engaged in fierce head-butting contests that probably would have looked like a mix of those between bighorn sheep or musk-oxen and the neck-slamming battles of giraffes.
    -   Heck, a plain ordinary ol' bull can headbutt your ribs into splinters, even without horns. And a full-grown male plains bison can easily do the same thing to your car's door.
    -   Orcas can headbutt hard enough to cause a whale's internal organs to _explode_.
    -   On a smaller scale, seahorses head-butt one another during territorial disputes.
    -   The various members of the pig family have exceptionally thick skulls and powerful neck muscles. These are more commonly used for rooting for buried vegetative matter and some small prey, but all of the various pig species are quite capable of using these features for offense as well. The tusks (for the specimens that have them) are not the only part of what one has to worry about if a pig is angry at someone.
    -   Any animal with one or more horns or tusks does this, including but not limited to deer, moose, goats, gazelles, wildebeest, and elephants. Among them, musk-ox and bighorn sheep are best known for this.
