_"You can't spell 'warrior' without one 'I'."_

Something covers one of the character's eyes. It might be an eyepatch, a particularly concealing haircut, or a tilted Martial Arts Headband. Whatever it is, and however it came to be, through Fashionable Asymmetry it neatly conveys the fact that the wearer is either 1) an experienced combatant or 2) secretly a badass.

Perhaps both.

These characters rarely experience any problems with depth perception or suffer from the resulting reduced field of vision. In fact, sometimes the Eyepatch of Power covers a perfectly functional — or specially functional — eye instead of the empty hole one might suspect. This is sometimes a technique of The Trickster. Main characters will often gain an eyepatch as a Future Badass or Evil Twin.

Pirates often have eye patches as a Stock Costume Trait, which is a separate thematic concept — see Dressed to Plunder — but the overlap of badassery and piracy is significant enough to mention. This is partially Truth in Television, pirates in real life did often wear eye patches regularly, but mainly because on sailing ships in the 18th century there were over a thousand different ways one could lose body parts, including eyes (this is also the reason why hooks for hands and peg legs are commonly associated with them as well, seeing as such items could easily be improvised using materials already on a ship to compensate for missing limbs). In this case, sailors didn't wear eye patches to look tough so much as they did because on average people have an easier time looking at a piece of cloth over one eye than at the scarred tissue where the eye used to be. Furthermore, even pirates (and other seamen) with two functioning eyes were wont to wear eyepatches: since it's so dark belowdecks, having one eye always in darkness made it easier to adjust.

In The Future, rough and tumble outlaws will often have a single, obvious cybernetic eye which will give them some sort of special holdout ability or Super-Senses.

When the Norse god Odin traded an eye for a drink from Mimir's well of knowledge, he made this trope Older Than Print.

Related to Blind Seer—power gain through the loss of an eye is a repeating motif in literature, like the Odin example above.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Eyepatches and concealing hairdos abound in Leiji Matsumoto's works (_Captain Harlock_, _Queen Emeraldas_, _Space Battleship Yamato_).
-   _Doraemon: Nobita and the Haunts of Evil_: The dangerous Mook Lieutenant of Daburanda''s army is a wolfhound named Saberu, who sports an eyepatch over his left eye. He's also the only named villain who's an actual threat in direct combat, being a very competent Master Swordsman.
-   In _11eyes_, Kakeru has a blind right eye, covered by an overly large eyepatch, which grants him the power of precognition.
-   _Fire Force_: Both Captain Burns and Joker, two powerful fighters in their own right, wear eyepatches on opposite sides. And it's not a coincidence. Both of them were partners once, and went their separate ways after a mission led to their respective eyes literally burning out of their skulls from staring right into the setting's equivalent of Hell itself.
-   Akito from _Air Gear_'s eyepatch acts as an indicator as to which half of his Split Personality is in charge: if over the right eye, sweet and innocent Akito is in control. Over the left eye, violent and brash Agito takes over. Without the eyepatch, Agito _still_ has control, but with more power.
-   Akachi from _Arata: The Legend_ wears one after implanting their eye in another character.
-   Nice Holystone of _Baccano!_, who conceals a small but functional _bomb_ within the empty eye socket covered by her eyepatch. A bomb is also how she lost the eye in the first place.
-   In the _Berserk_ prototype story, Guts has an eyepatch. He gives it away as a souvenir at the end. In the actual manga Guts averts this, as even though his right eye is missing/heavily damaged after being clawed out by a demon during the Eclipse, he doesn't wear an eyepatch; he just... keeps his eyelid closed.
-   _The Big O_: Norman has one, along with a mustache.
-   Ciel Phantomhive of _Black Butler_ has one to hide his Magical Eye pentagram; the sign of his Deal with the Devil contract.
-   In _Black Cat_, Sven Vollfied wears an eyepatch over his right eye, which has the ability to see a few seconds into the future. If he uses it extensively, it can cause extreme exhaustion. He has the eye from his old partner Lloyd who had these powers of seeing the future. Foreseeing Sven's death, Lloyd went to intervene and was consequently killed himself. Sven lost an eye in the process but was given a transplant from Lloyd who had registered as an organ donor not long before.
    -   Later on in the manga, his eye can greatly accelerate his perception of motion so everything appears slowed down, allowing him to easily dodge bullets, punches, and anything else that comes flying at him. He also gets better at using his Magical Eye so he doesn't need his Eyepatch Of Power as often, but he keeps it anyway. (Probably because it looks badass.)
-   For some unexplained reason in _Bludgeoning Angel Dokurochan_ her younger but older looking sister Zakuro wears an eye patch.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Kenpachi Zaraki hides one (functioning) eye under an eyepatch made from a creature that eats his Battle Aura, which allows him to fight at a lower power-level so as not to crush lesser opponents and ruin all the fun so quickly.
    -   Kenpachi's evil counterpart, the Quinto Espada Nnoitra Gilga, also has an eyepatch, which conceals his Hollow hole and the remnants of his mask.
    -   Coyote Starrk's release gives him what's either an eyepatch or a scouter. When he does this, he goes from Brilliant, but Lazy to a Not-So-Harmless Villain.
    -   Shunsui Kyoraku starts using one of these after Robert Accutrone subjects him to Eye Scream by shooting his right eye. Every now and then, Kubo mistakenly draws the eye intact.
    -   One of the original Thirteen Court Guard Captains, Furoufushi Saitou, wears an eyepatch and being part of the strongest generation of the Division Captains this trope is a given.
-   Saya Kisaragi from _Blood-C_ gets one in episode 12, after getting the left half of her head blown off **and living to tell**. So she rips her clothes and covers her injury as her Healing Factor slowly kicks in...
-   In _Brave10_, Rokurou hides his right eye behind bandages to conceal the power of the Water Crest eye, which lets him suck out people's memories and store limitless amounts of knowledge in it. He loses it to Anastasia when she betrays the Braves and the eyepatch starts doing its normal job...Or so it would seem, until the sequel, at which point it's revealed he's gone and put his other family heirloom, the God's Jewel, in the socket to make up for it and is now hiding _that_.
-   Othinus from _A Certain Magical Index_, much like her mythological counterpart. Othinus has acquired the position of majin (magic god) and is thus one of the most powerful beings in the world.
-   _Chainsaw Man_:
    -   Himeno, one of the more experienced devil hunters, has an eyepatch hiding her right eye. She gave up her right eye to the Ghost Devil for a devil contract in exchange for borrowing some of its supernatural power.
    -   Quanxi also bears one and, according to her former buddy Kishibe, would win in a bare-knuckle fighting tournament of all of humanity. She's also a weapon devil hybrid (presumably bow), making her nigh-unkillable. Her eyepatch hides an arrow which acts as the switch for the transformation when removed, explaining why her regeneration doesn't just give her a new eye.
-   Lelouch Lamperouge of _Code Geass_ has a variation in the second season of the show, as now that his geass in his eye is in Power Incontinence mode, he has to wear a special contact lens over it to hide that power in civilian life.
    -   A (slightly) more straight example can be found in Knight Of One Bismarck Waldstein, who has his left eye sewn shut. This is to seal his always-on Geass, which allows him to predict an opponent's movement.
    -   When Jeremiah Gottwald opens his left eye, he can nullify any Geass power. Being a badass already, it made it easy for him to deal with Rolo and Lelouch when they were unable to use their Geass on him. Lelouch outsmarts him, though, because he's savvy enough not to rely exclusively on Geass.
    -   "Julius Kingsly" in the OVA _Code Geass: Akito the Exiled_ also has his left eye covered by a particularly extravagant eye patch, almost certainly to prevent him from using his Geass.
-   In _Comic Girls_, The Hero of Tsubasa's Shōnen manga is a traditional hero wearing this and Badass Cape. Tsubasa herself sometimes wear both when she acts him out for story writing.
-   Lavi from _D.Gray-Man_ wears an eye patch over his right eye. Under it he hides a secret "only known to Bookmen". Nobody know what it is. Yet. And God knows how long til we find out.
    -   Cross Marian's right eye is covered by a faceplate. And since he was either killed or was Put on a Bus, "God knows how long till we find out." (Because when an eye is covered by something, you know it's covered for a reason...)
-   In _The Daughter of Twenty Faces_, Ken gets one after losing an eye and turns Darker and Edgier as a result.
-   An odd and extremely narmy version of this is combined with Mask Power in _Dragonaut: The Resonance_. When Kazuki, the Rival Turned Evil, returns from a No One Could Survive That! moment, he's wearing an eyepatch... as a mask. It makes it look like he has a thong on his head.
-   Jay Rock of _Fang of the Sun Dougram_ is more or less Che Guevara with an eyepatch. Not surprisingly, he's the show's local avatar of the god of Badass.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Führer King Bradley uses a patch to hide his "Ultimate Eye", his left eye which holds his Ouroboros that gives him the foresight to see all possible outcomes of a given situation, allowing him to predict the moves of any opponent before they happen. His original eye rotted out long ago once he graduated from Führer school.
    -   Bradley's eye in the first anime didn't let him see the future, but it let him see just about everything else. It was used to great effect in his fight with Mustang were swinging his sword altered the air currents in the room and diverted Mustang's attacks.
    -   In the end of the first anime, Mustang kills Bradley but ends up losing his eye himself. He starts using an eyepatch afterward.
-   The Genbu Seishi Hikitsu from _Fushigi Yuugi_ and _Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden_ wears an eyepatch over his right eye, which he calls "Shikyokan". The eye forces the person looking into it to remember their worst memories, letting him see these as well, and beyond.
-   Minene Uryu of _Future Diary_ gains an eyepatch after becoming blind in one in a fight with protagonist Yukiteru Amano, and said eye is plucked out by Yomotsu Hirsaka.
-   Saito from _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ has a cybernetic implant that resembles an eyepatch. His left eye was replaced with the "Hawkeye", a prosthetic eye that interfaces with satellites to allow for shots of incredible accuracy.
-   _Gintama_ has Kyuubei (based on Yagyu Jubei in the Real Life examples below) and Takasugi. Kyuubei got hers as a child after being injured protecting Tae.
-   Chigusa Tsukikage from _Glass Mask_ uses her long and messy black hair to cover the scars on her face after a terrible on-stage accident.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_:
    -   Subverted, as while the eyepatch Lockon Stratos receives later in the series does make him look more badass (if this is even possible for stupid, sexy Lockon), it gives Ali an advantage in the final fight causing Lockon to lose their fight and _die_.
    -   Allelujah's hair works similarly to an eyepatch, as it shows which side of him is fighting. If you can see the right eye, you are fighting pacifist, gentle Allelujah. See the left eye, you are fighting the rather terrifying Hallelujah. See both eyes, you are fighting the infinitely scarier gestalt of the two.

-   _Hellsing_ has two examples, the first being the mercenary Pip Bernadotte and the second being Integra after her eye was damaged in the final battle.
-   _Ikki Tousen_:
    -   Ryoumo, a.k.a. _Battle Vixens_, wears a medical bandage over her left eye. it's eventually revealed that the eyepatch is there to help Seal Evil (a "dragon" berserker spirit) In A Can.
    -   Later when Kakouton Genjou has an eye gouged out saving Sousou from Koushaji's fatal needles he starts sporting a rather spiffy patch with a skull and bones motif. This is a Shout-Out to and/or Generation Xerox of his past incarnation Xiahou Dun of _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_ fame, seen below under "Real Life".
-   Laura Bodewig from _Infinite Stratos_ has an eyepatch to conceal her nanomachine-enhanced golden super-eye, named Odin's Eye, or the _Eye that Surpasses the World._ It heightens the nerve processing to the brain, giving much faster reactions, to make her a better pilot.
-   Elder Kaede from _Inuyasha_ wears one because she lost her eye during an attack of demons when she was a little girl.
-   Midari of _Kakegurui_, who lost an eye by her own hands, paying a debt, and smiling as she did so - which also made her realize she liked both gambling and pain.
-   Jiyu Nanohana from _Jubei-chan_ received a "Lovely Eyepatch" that turned her into a super swordswoman. Her Rival Freesia in the second season had a similar one.
-   Nui Harime from _Kill la Kill_ has an eyepatch shaped like a combination of the katakana of her name. She is one of the most powerful fighters due to the Life Fibers in her body.
-   Farfarello of _Knight Hunters_. It doesn't seem to slow him down much.
-   Gantai from _Koi Koi 7_ has one to conceal her mechanical eye. Fitting to the trope, she's incredibly dangerous when she goes berserk.
-   _KonoSuba_: Even though both of her eyes are fine, Megumin wears an eyepatch solely because she thinks it looks cool.
-   Moritsugu Reiji's Machina Verdant in _Linebarrels of Iron_ has one eye destroyed, odd considering that like other machina it can heal given time, and Kouichi actually does try to use this to his advantage imagine his shock when Verdant suddenly heals its right eye after he took notice of the blind spot, Reiji goes on to state that verdant deliberately left the eye permanently damaged as a means of testing opponents.
-   Retsudou from _Lone Wolf and Cub_ got his after the hero tried to kill him by means of an arrow through the eye. It didn't work.
-   In _Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!_, Rikka wears an eyepatch under the delusion of being a seal to her "Evil Eye".
-   Cinque of _Lyrical Nanoha_. She once fought against an S-Rank mage. She lost her eye, he lost his life. Also an invoked trope for Cinque, as she could've gotten an artificial eye replacement after losing her eye in battle, but she chooses not to. Cypha from _Force_ also wears one.
-   In MÄR, the Chess Piece Candice has one of these _in addition_ to a mask. The eyepatch conceals a magic stone instead of an empty socket, which she uses as a Dimension Ärm.
-   Dr. Hell from _Mazinger Z_ wore one in the sequel series, _Great Mazinger_.
    -   A minor character showed up in one chapter also wore one. He was a homeless thief and street urchin, and the eyepatch furthered the sensation of he was a badass in one fight.
    -   Minister Zurill of _UFO Robo Grendizer_ was a Badass Bookworm with one eyepatch covering his left eye.
-   In _My Hero Academia_, Shota Aizawa, Eraser Head, starts wearing one after he loses an eye during the Paranormal Liberation War arc.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Kakashi hides a special eye behind his Martial Arts Headband. In fact, he had to _switch out his old eye for it_...
    -   A later chapter shows that Danzo has it too.
    -   In fact, there are a lot of minor ninja with eyepatches/coverings including Kuromaru (who for the uninformed is _a dog_) and Tonbo Tobitake, who has a covering for _both_ eyes. The above revelation has started a joke among the fandom that anyone who is covering their eye or an arm (doesn't even need to be with an eyepatch; it can just be with hair), they must be hiding a Sharingan. Humorously, just a couple chapters _earlier_, Ao, a character from the Mist village, revealed that his eyepatch hides not a Sharingan, but a _Byakugan_. Since the Byakugan grants X-Ray Vision, he doesn't ever _need_ to take off the eyepatch.
-   In _Natsume's Book of Friends_, Matoba, head of the notorious Matoba clan, wears a paper seal to protect his right eye. This is because his ancestor's had negotiated the assistance from a Youkai for his right-eye but he never kept up his end of the deal and so vengeful youkai target the head's right-eye. He notes he does have a horrible scar from an ayakashi attack but his eye-patch has yet to be lifted. Realistically though, his depth of perception is poor due to working with only one eye.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ goes this route with bandages. Rei starts the series with an eyepatch, Asuka ends the movie with one (given that she's thin, likes to wear red, and is German, she should look for work in the next Matsumoto movie).
    -   In Evangelion 3.0, Asuka has a more typical pirate-type eyepatch.
-   You'd think _One Piece_, being a manga about _pirates_, would be all over this trope. But to date, it has actually **averted** it, with not a single eyepatch to be seen despite a length of over 1000 chapters. Word of God is that the Eyepatch Of Power is being saved for someone special. Considering how incredibly badass and powerful some of the characters we've already met have been, it can only be wondered what kind of person the eyepatched one will be...
-   In the concealing haircut version of the trope, Xerxes Break of _PandoraHearts_ has bangs that conceal an empty eye socket, accidentally revealed by a young Gil. It is shown later in the series that the eye was plucked out by the Will of the Abyss to replace Cheshire's having encountered the Will of the Abyss due to being dragged into the Abyss after going on a killing spree with his chain.
-   Senri from _+Anima_ uses an eyepatch to control his + anima form.
-   _Puella Magi Oriko Magica_'s Kirika has an eyepatch in her Magical Girl form. This doesn't seem to hamper her fighting ability.
-   Shirow Watari from _RahXephon_ has one. Fitting for the commander of a small army.
-   Itsuki Iba of _Rental Magica_ always wears an eyepatch, though even with it, he still feels a bit of pain when he's around too much magical pollution.
-   André Grandier from _The Rose of Versailles_ has one after losing his left eye rather messily.
-   Barasuishou of _Rozen Maiden Träumend_ wears a flowery eyepatch over her left eye, acting as a seal over her emotions. Kirakishou, the doll she was based on, appears to have an identical one over her right eye, but it was revealed to be an actual rose growing from the socket.
-   _Saint Seiya_:
    -   Somewhat subverted by Dragon Shiryu in . Shiryu either blinds himself or loses his eyesight in the peak moments of his fights, then emerges much more powerful.
    -   His companion Cygnus Hyoga wears a more traditional one.
-   Several of the Samurai Gun have these. Losing an eye is apparently an occupational hazard.
-   Toppi of _Sands of Destruction_ wears a patch across his right eye; it isn't stated how he lost it. In one episode, he meets up with an old adventuring buddy named Yappi who also wears one.
-   In _The Seven Deadly Sins_ Helbram in his human form wears an eyepatch on his right eye.
-   Bel Peol, a leader of the villain group Bal Masque from _Shakugan no Shana_, actually has three eyes, but her normal right eye is covered by an eyepatch. This only makes her look even more badass.
-   In _Shura no Toki_, two characters use this trope. Takato keeps one eye closed while the legendary Yagyuu Juubei wears a tsuba (sword guard) over one eye. In both cases they have perfectly functional binocular vision but close one eye for the sake of "training". They instantly power up when they use both eyes.
-   In _Soul Eater_, the Death Scythe Marie Mjolnir has an eyepatch with a lightning bolt on it over her left eye. We're not told what happened for her to need it. In the anime, it is removed during a vision when she uses her special soul wavelength.
-   Professor Anarchy<small>◊</small>, Speed Racer's adversary in the episode "Gang of Assassins", sports a rather distinctive patch.
-   Fultac from Arakawa's earlier manga _Stray Dog_ also has one hiding a plot-relevant functional eye.
-   Mio Sakamoto of _Strike Witches_ wears a patch over her right (magical) eye. It allows her to see the cores of Neuroi. It should also be noted that this magical eye seems to be always on, meaning the eye patch may also maintain her sanity, if you saw things in magic-o-vision 24/7 you would probably Go Mad From The Revelations.
-   Lag Seeing from _Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee_ has an eye of amber that is usually covered by his hair... unless he is shooting his Heart Gun. It lets him shoot Heart Shots without amber in his gun, and lets him shoot bullets from the palm of his hand too.
    -   There are actually several characters in the series who have lost one or both of their eyes, to the point of being a running motif. Others include Dr. Thunderland (one eye) and the twin gatekeepers (both eyes).
-   Adiane in _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_. It's bulletproof, too, if the first movie is to be believed.
-   Makiko Nagi of _Tenjho Tenge_ wears one, and it covers a pretty freaky scar. She got it after her lover decided to try creating an ultimate weapon out of someone else and removed the eye in question in order to give his new experimentee the abilities she'd already absorbed from other people.
-   Natose, one of the more powerful characters in _They Are My Noble Masters_ (which is saying something), has an eye patch which is a direct reference to her tragic past.
-   Taken to ridiculous extremes in _Tono to Issho_ OVA with Date Masamune. Just watch first five minutes.
    -   The _Sengoku Basara_ version is no slouch, fighting with 6 swords at once when he gets serious.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, Kaneki Ken wears a medical eyepatch to conceal his oft-uncontrolled Kakugan. After the time skip and his descent into Anti-Hero territory, he starts wearing an eyepatch with a stylized Centipede embroidered on it. His Cool Mask is designed with an eyepatch covering his normal eye, resulting in him gaining the alias "Eyepatch".
    -   In the sequel, _Tokyo Ghoul: Re_, Mutsuki Tooru wears a medical eyepatch for the same reason.
-   _Trigun_'s Dominique the Cyclops has what she calls the Demon Eye. Hidden by a metal shutter over her right eye, the fake eye can temporarily put all who are near in a trance for a few moments.
-   Syaoran's Ultimate Eyepatch Of We're Edgy Now in _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_. Which was later passed to Fai after Clone!Syaoran ate Fai's eye and Real!Syaoran escaped from his fishbowl.
-   In _Umineko: When They Cry_, Siesta 00, the commander of the Siestas (bunny-girl soldiers), has one of these.
-   Lucia Nahashi from _Venus Versus Virus_ wears an eyepatch in order to hide her glowing left eye. It blends in well with her gothic lolita fashion.
-   Thorkell of _Vinland Saga_ has just recently come into possession of an eye patch after losing an eye in a battle. As if he wasn't badass enough already, if this trend continues he'll soon be wearing a long coat regardless of how anachronistic that might be to the period.
-   Wicked Witch of the West in the 1982 anime adaptation of _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ wears an eyepatch.
-   Ryuuko Kounuma from _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_, after her boyfriend beats her up.
-   Lord Darcia III from _Wolf's Rain_: He uses a patch on his left side to hide the gold-colored wolf's eye which he uses to inexplicably render humans unconscious. It's the result of a family curse and being descended from wolves.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_,
    -   In the original anime, Pegasus' hair almost always covered his Millennium Eye. Usually when it doesn't, it's because he's lifted it out of place. Even after he loses the Millennium Eye, he still covers the place where it was with his hair. He _did_, however, wear an eyepatch in the (non-canon) card battle video game _Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction_.
    -   One episode in _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ featured Don Zaruug/Don Zaloog, a Duel Monster spirit wearing a gold eyepatch that allowed him to manifest in the physical world and bring his fellow "Dark Scorpion" gang members with him. Jim also has bandages constantly covering his magic eye.
-   Fu Inubozaki of _Yuki Yuna is a Hero_ starts wearing an eyepatch after losing the vision of her left eye to the Senju.
-   Irvine from _Zoids: Chaotic Century_. Though his eyes are completely normal, the eyepatch he wears effectively functions as a combination camera, camcorder, and binoculars.

    Asian Animation 

-   In _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_, Martial Wolf is famous among wolves for being the original leader of the wolf pack. He wears an eyepatch as a part of his pirate outfit.

    -   The badass assassin Deathstroke wears an eyepatch over his missing eye; his mask is split into two colors, with featureless black over his missing eye, because he's so badass that it doesn't matter if his opponents know he has a physical impairment. In addition, his daughter wears an eyepatch after taking out her own eye in order to prove herself to him.
        -   Deathstroke's missing eye is even more badass considering that he lost it when his wife, standing right behind him, tried to shoot him in the back of the head. He heard her cock the gun and dodged. Well mostly. Also keep in mind that his wife was the one who initially trained him as a Special Forces operative, so she knew how to kill someone.
        -   Well, except for knowing the proper time to cock a gun. Despite that, she _still_ managed to hit him — and to this day, she's still one of the very, _very_ few people to ever successfully hit him... and out of everybody, she's the one who inflicted the most damage on him.
    -   The Action Girl Tallulah Black from _Jonah Hex_ wears an eyepatch on account of her facial scarring from being subject to a Moe Greene Special.
    -   Mark Shaw (one of the characters to use the name Manhunter) wore one in his alternative identity of the Privateer. And, no, there was nothing wrong with his eye. He wore it purely because it was cool.

    -   Deathstroke's daughter Rose, a.k.a. Ravager, gouged out her own eye in an attempt to emulate her father while Brainwashed and Crazy. She would go on to become one of the most badass members of the Teen Titans. And looks smoking hot in her white eyepatch.
    -   _Wonder Woman_:
        -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: The Nazi super-soldier Red Panzer has a scar through one eye which he usually keeps covered as it is no longer funtional.
        -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: The Daxamite wears an eyepatch over her missing eye that does not have a robotic replacement, and she is undeniably an excellent and powerful fighter who commands respect through her insistence on respecting life despite all the horrible things she's gone through. It's a bit of Space Pirate flair for one of the least piratey of Wonder Woman's space pirates.
        -   _Wonder Woman (2006)_: Black Canary wears an eyepatch as part of her disguise for infiltrating a superpowered underground fighting ring. It doesn't impede her in the least.
        -   _Wonder Woman: Odyssey_: Philippus lost the use of an eye in the failed fight to defend Themyscira, and as the she was the Amazon's best warrior even before the fall of Themyscira she remains so with the Amazons decimated and the survivors living as refugees.

-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   Nick Fury, _Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D._, started as the hard-charging Sgt. Fury during WWII. But he had two eyes then. The eyepatch gave Fury an older, badass injured look — something the spy gained as a soldier during the war. Since both were running concurrently, Marvel Comics could differentiate the two timelines of the character by use of the patch.
    -   Doctor Strange had one for a while as part of a retool into a 'darker' character.
    -   _Excalibur (Marvel Comics)_: Pete Wisdom wore an eyepatch, but later revealed that he has full functionality in both eyes and did it just so he could pick up chicks.
    -   Odin, father of The Mighty Thor, wears an eyepatch to cover the socket that used to hold the eye that was cast into the Well of Mimir in exchange for wisdom.
    -   Lampshaded in _What The—?!_, where every character in the Marvel Universe tries to wear an eyepatch just to be as cool as Wolverine. (See the Invisible Woman wearing nothing but an eye patch!) Wolverine explains that only he can handle the eyepatch as Human Torch slams into the side of a building having misjudged the distance.
    -   Wolverine wore an eyepatch for a short time—and went by the name Patch—as a disguise. This worked only as long as you had never met Wolverine before, and/or had never seen him unmasked, since he didn't change anything else about his appearance, including his distinctive hairstyle and facial hair.
        -   He has another one in _Marvel 100th Anniversary Special_, but there's no indication that this one is fake.

-   One-Eye of _ElfQuest_ has a very prominent eyepatch, having lost an eye to humans. In the novelization, Leetah offers to heal it but finds that there's nothing left of the missing eye to heal. In any event, his missing eye turns out to be a liability because when the elves and trolls are fighting he can't see a troll sneaking up on his blind side and is killed.
-   In the Top Cow comic _Just a Pilgrim_, by Garth Ennis, we are introduced to two Eyepatch Badasses. The pilgrim does not have an eyepatch as such, but he did burn out one of his own eyes, leaving a cross-shaped scar across his face. He seems to be the baddest dude on the planet. Till he meets the pirate king, who has TWO eyepatches, TWO hooks for hands, and TWO peg legs. "This be MY killing floor, mate!"

-   Maj. Bludd has one of these by default in every incarnation of _G.I. Joe_ he appears in, but in the comic Billy eventually acquires one as well, cementing his status as a badass.

-   Gareth the Bowman from _Sojourn_. Various characters did wonder how someone with no depth perception could be an expert archer. In his narration, Gareth promised that there was an explanation, but the series ended before we could find out what it was.
-   In one of the _Wallace & Gromit_ comics, the villainous Herr Doktor Count Baron Napoleon von Strudel (real name Bert Maudsley) sports an eyepatch to go with his Dastardly Whiplash mustache. He uses the patch to conceal an experimental ping-pong ball that will explode if it touches the ground.
-   Torin Mac Quillon from _Starslayer_ wears an eyepatch that also includes a link to his Robot Buddy SAM.
-   Spike has acquired one for some reason in the short for Issue #4 of _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_, even though both his eyes clearly work fine in the last panel. Perhaps he just felt it looked cool.
-   _Halo: Blood Line_: Spartan-II Black-One has one, though in a variant it's actually a cybernetic prosthetic that lets her keep seeing despite the loss of her actual eye.
-   _Black Moon Chronicles_: Frater Sinister has his eye gouged out by the dragonlord he was allied with when his insurrection against the emperor falls apart, and has to wear a black eyepatch from then on as he openly joins the forces of evil.

    -   One of the female leaders of a Neo-Nazi post-apocalyptic gang is wearing a black eyepatch after half her face was burned in a fight against Rowan.

-   _Juice Squeezers_: Coach Kettleborne, the leader of the Juice Squeezers, has an eyepatch. He got it as a kid in The Battle Of Valley May Farms. A giant potato bug tried to eat his brain, so he cut its thorax in half and pulled the head out of its eye socket.

    Comic Strips 

-   While he's soft-spoken by nature and aphasic by condition, Leo from _Doonesbury_ does come off as badass at times.
-   _Peanuts_:
    -   Snoopy and his (pretend) crew of "bloodthirsty pirates" wear these. Although the badass quotient decreases when one of his crewbirds tries to double it—and wanders into a post.
    -   Sally, during a story arc where she wears an eyepatch to treat 'lazy eye', looks at herself and thinks she should be in an ad for men's shirts. (When her eye got better, she gave it to Snoopy.)

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Book of Life_:
    -   Jorge and Scardelita Sanchez wear ones over their left eye sockets.
    -   Joaquin loses his right eye in the final battle. He places a black eyepatch over it.
-   _Harlock: Space Pirate_. The title character as in the anime, and we see how he loses his eye during a flashback scene. Harlock passes on his eyepatch to Yama while Passing the Torch; Yama having had his eye shot out during the course of the movie.
-   Buck the weasel in _Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs_ movie, although more Cloud Cuckoolander ("And now let me tell you about the time I used a sharpened clamshell to turn a T-Rex... into a T-Rachel!") than badass.
-   The title character of _Kubo and the Two Strings_ has worn an eyepatch since _infancy_ because his grandfather tore one eye out and is coming for the other. He's certainly not one to be trifled with, but a twelve-year-old with an eyepatch is still a bit disconcerting, which probably why it's usually covered by his hair.
-   In _The Pagemaster_, Adventure (Patrick Stewart) looks like a pirate, complete with eyepatch. There's nothing wrong with the eye under it—so when he needs to get a better look at something he just lifts it up.
-   Doofenshmirtz-2's eyepatch in _Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension_.

-   _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_: Among Bowser's troops there's a Koopa Troopa with red spiked shoulderpads who wears an eyepatch. It's clearly just to look much tougher as during the intro scene, when another Koopa gets knocked down by a snowball, he lifts it revealing his eye is fine.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Dilios, the sole survivor in the film _300_. By definition (given his peers) a badass, he is perhaps more so because, with his one eye and his talent for storytelling, he is ordered to do the hard thing (for a Spartan): escape and live, to tell their story.
-   Anne's first mate Dougal sports an eyepatch in _Anne of the Indies_: only losing it during the final battle just before he dies.
-   _Army of Frankensteins_: Alan is given one by the war nurses due to Finski removing his eye before the time portal opened.
-   Number Two in _Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery_ neatly takes the second version: hidden in his eyepatch is a sight-enhancing camera, allowing him to cheat at blackjack.
-   In _Barbarella_, when Barbarella first meets the Black Queen of Sorgo, the Queen is in disguise wearing an eyepatch.
-   In the old cowboy film _Black Patch_, the title character got the name because he had to wear such a patch after his enemies cut out his eye.
-   Professor Zero from the spy film, _The Brain Stealers_, wears an eyepatch and is the leader of a powerful SPECTRE-like criminal organization who commands plenty of mooks, and have minions who failed him disposed in an Acid Pool. Turns out to be a subversion when the film's ending reveals Professor Zero to be the heroine's former partner - the eyepatch, scar and cap is just a disguise.
-   In _Bring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman_, Big Bad's Longara's right-hand man Bracoli sports a heavy leather eyepatch. Longara eventually kills him by driving a drinking straw through his good eye.
-   Lord Dread in _Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future_. Upper-left quarter of his head is cybernetic. His eye is a reg-glowing lens.
-   In _Chai Lai Angels: Dangerous Flowers_, Darkie, one of Dragon's henchmen, sports one. It is later revealed to be the result of Rose putting his eye out in an earlier encounter.
-   The Russian assassin Morovich in _Condorman_ is prone to wearing an eyepatch. It's usually worn either in place of or to conceal his distinctive false eye, which is entirely silver. he and his team of Elite Mooks are so feared that whenever people hear their fleet of black Porsches approaching they run and hide.
-   Horace's dog Wink wears one in _Cruella_.
-   Nicole's Gentleman Thief father sports one in _Death Walks on High Heels_.
-   Major Eden Sinclair in _Doomsday_. She also has a fake eye, but half the time it's being bounced around and used as a spy camera.
-   Subverted in _The Eagle Has Landed_. While Colonel Radl does wear a black eyepatch, he is neither particularly evil nor that powerful. He is in fact a calm, empathetic and remotely fatalistic officer.
-   Snake Plissken of _Escape from New York_ and _Escape from L.A._ fame. Captain Ron ... not so much.
-   The obscure 80s action movie _Firewalker_ had its villain, Coyote, wear one. Although which eye he wore it over changed a few times without explanation...
-   _Frankenstein Island_: Jocko, one of Sheila Frankenstein's two human henchmen, sports an eyepatch. Whatever is under it is so horrific that Curtis recoils away when shown it.
-   In _Friendly Persuasion_, the Union Army veteran giving new-to-combat Josh some friendly advice while they lay in wait for Confederate raiders has an eyepatch over one eye.
-   Big Bad Sarris from _Galaxy Quest_ has a metal plate bolted over his damaged right eye after surviving having his ship blown up by _atomic mines_. He's a sadistic bastard, but that's pretty badass.
-   In _Gangs of New York_, Bill "the Butcher" Cutting has a glass eye with an iris in the shape of an eagle. He cut his own eye out for flinching from an enemy.
-   _Godzilla_
    -   Dr. Serizawa, the man who kills Godzilla in _Godzilla (1954)_.
    -   Akikito Hirata plays an eyepatch-wearing villain in _Ebirah, Horror of the Deep_.
-   Patch, the leader of the Howlers motorcycle gang in _Goldstone_, gets his name from the distinctive eyepatch he wears, which makes him look really badass.
-   Spoofed in _The Hebrew Hammer_, where a guy has an eyepatch with a Star of David on it. The character is a deliberate parody of real-life Israeli military leader Moshe Dayan, who wore an eyepatch. (See Real Life)
-   _The Horse Soldiers_: Jackie Jo, one of the pair of Dangerous Deserters captured by Marlowe and his men, wears an eyepatch which adds considerably to his dangerous and desperate air.
-   _James Bond_
    -   Emilio Largo in _Thunderball_. It helps that he's one of the most charismatic Bond villains ever.
    -   Played with the minor villain Gettler in _Casino Royale (2006)_, who wears glasses that have one lens darkened.
-   Dark Action Girl and Evil Counterpart of the protagonist, Elle Driver from _Kill Bill_ has one due to getting her eye plucked out by Hermit Guru Pai Mei prior to the film. Tarantino got the idea from a '70s exploitation film (no surprise there) called _Thriller: A Cruel Picture_, about an eyepatch-wearing prostitute going on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. Unfortunately for Driver, getting her remaining eye plucked out makes her defenseless.
-   _Kingsman: The Golden Circle_ explores the downsides of this trope. The character wearing the eyepatch (and later, a pair of glasses with one black lens) was established as a highly trained One-Man Army before the event that cost him his eye. Sadly, without proper depth perception, he now struggles to aim his shots properly, and in his first fight since that event, he is caught completely off guard by an attack from his blind side. He gets better over the course of the story and seems capable enough in the final fights, but the failures early on are shown to put quite a damper on his confidence.
-   Benedict, the Big Bad in _Last Action Hero_, has a collection of unique glass eyes, most of which have special functions, like explosives.
-   _Long John Silver_: As might be guessed from his name, Silver's first mate Patch sports an eyepatch.
-   Several examples in the Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   A _Thor_ example: As in mythology and the comic books, Odin has one eye. What sets him apart in this adaptation is his choice of eyegear. He has a regular eyepatch and an armored eyepatch for battle. Verily.
    -   Nick Fury in all his film appearances. In _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ Fury even weaponizes this trope by storing the retinal data for his bad eye in the S.H.I.E.L.D. systems in case his primary clearance is revoked.
    -   By the end of _Thor: Ragnarok_, Thor loses an eye and gains one of these. Though in his next appearance he gets a Electronic Eye from Rocket, which isn't the same color as the remaining one.
-   In _The Mummy Returns_, the character Izzy is first seen wearing an eyepatch. Subverted when he openly admits that he wears it to look good; Rick pulls it off afterward.
-   The aptly named Kid Blink from _Newsies_.
-   Wilhelm in _None Shall Escape_ briefly uses an eyepatch after losing his left eye before getting a Glass Eye instead.
-   "Big" Dan Teague from _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_ wears an eyepatch when he is introduced, and a one-eyed Ku Klux Klan hood later. This is a Shout-Out to the Cyclops and the Greek mythology underpinning the story.
-   Towards the end of _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End_, Ragetti (a Plucky Comic Relief character) gives up his wooden eye for an eyepatch since it turned out his wooden eye was one of the pieces of eight of the Pirate Lords. He doesn't really become more badass, but it does mark a shift into a more serious tone of the film.
-   Willy T, the weird but surprisingly perceptive and cultured gas station attendant in _Psycho Pike_ wears an eyepatch over his right eye, which was bitten off by a ferocious pike.
-   Holmes wears one as part of his disguise to infiltrate Moriarty's gang in _Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace_.
-   Johnny Five dons an eyepatch of sorts it's actually his nonfunctional eye being held in place and covered by electrical tape during the third act of _Short Circuit 2_. Its reveal marks a second mood shift in the film and begins his Roaring Rampage of Revenge.
-   In _Six Gun Savior_, the outlaw Grant Dillion, the object of Lane's obsession and the major human villain of the film, sports an eye-patch.
-   Franky, Angelina Jolie's character in _Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_ (2004).
-   General Chang in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ doesn't _wear_ an eyepatch—he's such a badass that he actually has a metal plate riveted to his face.
-   Captain Typho, who replaces Captain Panaka in between Episodes I and II of the _Star Wars_ prequels as the head of Amidala's guard. Some viewers mistook Typho for a recast Panaka with battle damage.
-   Many of the publicity photos and posters for the _Terminator_ movies show Arnie with one human-like eye and one glowing red machine eye, showing the bad-assedness of having one normal eye and one weird high-tech eye.
-   Christopher Lee wore an eyepatch for his role as Rochefort in _The Three Musketeers (1973)_, to make him more sinister, and this appearance detail has carried over to a lot of other adaptations.
-   Rooster Cogburn, John Wayne's (or Jeff Bridges') anti-hero from _True Grit_. Though the Rooster in the 2010 film is still an excellent shot with one eye, the film points out his difficulty aiming, and it's why he accidentally hits LaBoeuf in the arm during a shootout.
-   In _True Lies_, Charlton Heston makes a cameo as the boss of Ahnuld's character. He sports one of these, as well as several gold teeth.
-   Inspector Kemp from _Young Frankenstein_ sports one of these, along with a wooden arm (either the left or the right depending on context and funniness) and monocle (on the same eye as the eyepatch).

    Literature 

-   _Heaven Official’s Blessing: Tian Guan Ci Fu_: Hua Cheng is a very powerful Ghost King and one of the Four Calamities, and he wears an eyepatch almost all the time.
-   Donar Vadderung in _The Dresden Files_ has one of these, as well an incredible amount of power. Unsurprising, since he's Odin.
-   Lampshaded with jollity in Garth Nix's _Keys to the Kingdom_ series, in which Arthur encounters a band of savage looking sailors. When it's revealed that their appearances are all for show, one of them insists that he can not only have one but two eyepatches, if one-way leather is used.
-   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_: When he is introduced in Battle of the Labyrinth, Ethan Nakamura has already made a deal with his godly mother, Nemesis, and sacrificed one eye in order to become more powerful. He is the one to find Percy's Achilles' Heel (literally) and even his own conscience when he turns against Kronos in the last minute.
-   Professor Mad Eye Moody in the _Harry Potter_ books has a magical glass eye, which is not only intimidating and can see in any direction, but also penetrates solid objects and illusions.
-   Ryan Cawdor of the _Deathlands_ novels has one. He is an exceptional shot with a gun, but in conversation the characters note that this is rather unusual and indicative of his marksmanship talents.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Mr. Teatime in _Hogfather_ is a sociopathic and highly-skilled assassin with one good eye. Many characters in the book think his glass eye (which is blank and rumored to be made from the same glass used for crystal balls) isn't nearly as scary as his good eye (which has an unnervingly narrow pupil). Of course, considering that Discworld magic is more than a little unstable, it proves how insane he is if he _put a magic prosthetic in his eye socket_.
    -   Posthumous Character John Keel in _Night Watch_—the guy who taught Sam Vimes everything he knows. Vimes has to act briefly as his one-eyed mentor to establish a Stable Time Loop—however, he's no more badass than he normally is, which is still pretty damn badass.
-   _Forest Kingdom_: In the _Hawk & Fisher_ spinoff series, Hawk has an eyepatch over one eye, as well as several scars along his face. Unusually enough, he does have depth perception problems, at least to the point where he prefers to fight with a short-handled axe rather than a sword. He's almost over-the-top in levels of 'experienced badass combatant', though, even with this handicap. The truth isn't revealed (both in-universe and to readers) until the parent series' book 4 (_Beyond the Blue Moon_), when it comes out that Hawk is actually Prince Rupert from the parent series' book 1 (_Blue Moon Rising_), who lost the eye in battle against a Big Bad.
-   _Forgotten Realms_ antagonist/antihero Jarlaxle has two good eyes, but sports a magical eyepatch with powers including X-ray vision and protection against psionics, depending on which eye the patch covers. Jarlaxle leads a prestigious mercenary company and is something of a Magnificent Bastard, glorying in chaos and favored by the drow's evil spider goddess.
-   Honor Harrington wore an eyepatch in one book after her left eye was damaged before she had it replaced with a cybernetic eye (with telescopic vision). Later, she also acquired a synthetic arm.
-   Captain William Fredrickson from the _Sharpe_ series is missing an eye (and his two front teeth). When he enters combat, he removes his eyepatch and false teeth to frighten the enemy.
-   Euron Greyjoy from _A Song of Ice and Fire_. Called the Crow's Eye, Euron is a vicious Magnificent Bastard with serious issues. His brother Aeron, describes Euron's uncovered eye as his "smiling eye" and makes vague, fearful references to what he hides beneath the patch. He is the captain of the ship "Silence", whose crew is made of mutes and its hull painted red with the blood of Euron's enemies, and it is said that men pray whenever they see his sails.
-   Corum in Michael Moorcock's novels is given the Eye of the missing god Rhynn to replace his lost eye. This allows him to see into—and summon the assistance of creatures from—other realms whenever he raises his jeweled eyepatch. Later on, he has to give (the no-longer missing) Rhynn his eye back, and thereafter wears a conventional eyepatch.
-   _The Wheel of Time_
    -   Uno is introduced with just one eye, later on he starts wearing an eyepatch with a scary eye painted on it. While he IS a badass he more of a drill sergeant.
    -   Mat Cauthon loses an eye, too, and he actually notes his lack of depth perception and worsened sight, but he decides it isn't so bad. After all,he needed to trade it with Eldritch Abominations shaped as Snakes, who you can only way to survive the Evil Tower of Ominousness, which a children's game is base off of, because All Myths Are True. "Luck worked better when you were not looking anyway."
-   The Divine Fratery of Dan Abnett's novel _Ravenor Returned_ are an organization that dedicates their efforts to ruining the Imperium by scrying out possible futures and working to manifest the ones that would do the most harm. In order to become a full member, the supplicant must put out one of their own eyes and receive no medical treatment for any reason until they have completed fashioning the silver mirror they will use to divine the future. Constructing the mirror can take years. Those who are successful are given an augmented eye to replace the one they sacrificed, and henceforth hide their remaining real eye behind an eye patch when not actively scrying.
-   Star Wars Legends:
    -   There are three people in the _X-Wing Series_ who each have a mechanical eye—Booster Terrick, General Edor Crespin, and Ton Phanan. Booster and Phanan each have a glowing red prosthesis. When Phanan dies staring at the stars and someone closes his real eye, his mechanical one stays powered, not dimming. Crespin is said to have got a glossy black prosthetic, but because people found it unnerving he wore a mirrored patch over it. Wedge suspects that he can see through it.
    -   Baron Soontir Fel acquires an eye patch. When asked why he never replaced it with a prosthetic, he says that the resources can be better used elsewhere and that he's still the best damn pilot in the Empire of the Hand.
    -   _Star Wars: Kenobi_: Tusken Raiders always go masked anyway, but A'Yark only has the use of one eye, so she's jammed a reddish gemstone into the other eyepiece.
-   _Friday_ by Robert A. Heinlein. Friday's unnamed Boss refuses to have his eye regenerated, and so wears an 'unfashionable' eyepatch.
-   In the _Mageworlds_ series by Debra Doyle and James D. MacDonald, the heroine Beka Metadi assumes the identity of the roguish (and male) Tarnikep Portee, a nearly psychotic dandy with a crimson eyepatch and an oversized blaster. Tarnikep is both crazier and more of a badass that Beka.
-   _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_: Xiahou Dun earns his Eyepatch of Power by getting hit in the eye with an arrow. Unfazed, he plucks out the arrow, _eats his own eye_, and returns to the fight.
-   _Tales of the Sundered Lands_: One-Eyed Ryan, as his name suggests, has only one eye. He is also very experienced.
-   _The Hereward Trilogy_: Lysir, who may actually BE Odin.
-   The Wicked Witch of the West wears one in the original _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_.
-   Major \_\_\_\_ de Coverley wears one in _Catch-22_. His face is so forbidding that no one dares ask his first name. It turns out that his eyepatch was not gained during any battlefield heroics. An ornery old man tossed a rose in the Major's eye for being so damn imperious.
-   Mrs. Arthur B. Candy in _Flashman and the Redskins_, from the “Seventy-Sixer” half of the book, wears an eyepatch. Flashy doesn't care why she has it, as he finds it smoking hot, along with her. To his sorrow, he later finds out that she's actually the ex-slave Cleonie, and is wearing the patch to hide the shape of her face so she can fool him, seduce him, and lure him to his doom as revenge for the evil he did to her in the “Forty-Niner” half of the book.
-   In _Expecting Someone Taller_ (a very loose, comic sequel to the famous opera, _The Ring of the Nibelung_), Wotan, the king of the gods, wears one, just as he does in the opera. It's very intimidating.
-   Bagley Brown Jr., the lead character in the children's novel _The Wainscott Weasel_, sports an eyepatch as the result of losing an eye to a bird attack when he was a child. His troubles with depth perception are accurately mentioned, and he definitely meets his badass quota by doing most of the work in hauling off an osprey's nest from the top of a telephone pole.
-   In _Changeling_ by Roger Zelazny, when Mark Marakson is slowly becoming a dark lord of high technology in a world of magic, one of the first things he gets is an implant in his left eye. With a lens that buzzes and changes color adapting to illuminance.
-   In _The Shattered Kingdoms_, the mercenary known as the Mongrel has an eyepatch, but she isn't missing an eye. Rather, her two eyes work differently from each other as a result of her supernatural illness (which applies a sort of Duality Motif to her). Both eyes work, but they don't work well _together_, and she actually sees better if she only uses one at a time.
-   In _Another_, Mei Misaki wears an eyepatch that covers an artificial eye that replaces the one she lost to cancer. She can see the "color of death" with said "eye".
-   Jurand in _The Knights of the Cross_, of an experienced combatant variety (also, badass). Later on he loses the other eye, along with some other body parts, thanks to the vengeful villains.
-   The sorcerer Peredur in _The Dragon Waiting_.
-   Jerry Ahern (aka Axel Kilgore) wrote an Action-Adventure series _They Call Me The Mercenary_. The title character Hank Frost wore an eyepatch, and a Running Gag involved him providing a different and highly implausible explanation every time someone asked how he lost his eye.
-   In the ebook _Lockhartand Teague:The Empty Chest_ Allegra Stroud is a powerful and imposing character who has a glass eye. It's implied that she had it made a slightly lighter shade than her other, real eye just to screw with people.
-   Polly in _Quicksand House_ spends most of the story wearing an improvised eyepatch made from a doll's face. Hence why the picture on the book's cover is of a green-haired girl with antlers and a doll's-face eyepatch, giving you a good idea of what to expect.
-   _Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians_: The Big Bad of the first book is Blackburn, who Invoked this trope. In their world, magic has to do with lenses (magic glasses) and he put out one of his own eyes in order to concentrate **all** his power through the **one** eye. It works, in that it makes him a more powerful Oculator, but it also handicaps him and makes him short-sighted.
    
    **Bastille**: He's a very powerful Oculator, Alcatraz — they say he put out his own eye to increase the power focused through his single remaining one.
    
-   In _Raise Some Hell_ Ramona herself gets one after her eye is hit by a piece of flaming wood. It's burned to the point that even the school nurse can't regenerate it, though they can make sure it won't act up.

-   _Game of Thrones_: Beric Dondarrion wears one after "surviving" a dagger in the eye.
-   _House of the Dragon_: Aemond Targaryen wears one after the childhood brawl against his Velaryon nephews over his claiming of Vhagar that cost him an eye. He grew up a fearsome swordsman regardless.
-   _MythBusters_ did a segment exploring the story that a pirate captain wore an unnecessary eyepatch so that they could go above and below decks without losing their night-vision, as the eye covered would already be dark-acclimated. Their tests showed that switching an eyepatch from one eye to the other in a darkened room made navigating an obstacle course significantly easier.
-   Saul Tigh, as of S3 of _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_. He's always been somewhat of a Psycho Supporter, almost a Manipulative Bastard, but perhaps not coincidentally, he becomes a significantly more formidable character at more or less the exact same point at which he loses his eye. In what may count as a subversion, Tigh forgoes a classic black eyepatch for a distinctly more medical flesh-colored patch with transparent cords. Moreover, he spends several episodes beforehand with a very uncool chunk of gauze taped to his face. It's also worthy of note that there was an episode where he was having a great deal of difficulty putting his "uncool chunk of gauze" on by himself, subverting the "no loss of depth perception" addendum above.
-   Subverted in _Flight of the Conchords_: David Bowie appears to Bret in a dream and tells him that he'd become more famous as a musician if he started wearing an eyepatch. Bret wears one for a while but stops after he complains about his poor depth perception causing him to miss chairs and run into walls. In his next dream, Bret tells Bowie what happened and he admits he had similar problems when he wore one (see Music below).
-   In the same way goatees are commonly used to depict evil Alternate Universe versions of characters in parodies (after Spock grew one in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Mirror Mirror"), eyepatches are used for the same purpose, because the evil version of the Brigadier wore one in the _Doctor Who_ serial _Inferno_. And as we all know, Evil is Bad Ass, therefore, this counts as a variation on this trope.
    -   _The Middleman_ also uses this, probably in a Shout-Out in "The Palindrome Reversal Palindrome." In the alternate universe, the one sporting the Eyepatch of Power is the alt!Middleman himself. He's a Badass Biker to boot, but still a good guy.
-   Madam Kovarian from the 2011 series of _Doctor Who_ has some kind of cybernetic device over her right eye. A bunch of other characters start wearing copies of it in "The Wedding of River Song". The Doctor notes that all the servants of The Silence wear them, and as such is horrified when he sees Amy wearing one. She however is not Brainwashed and Crazy and notes that it is not an eyepatch, it lets them remember the Silents. Which is why both their servants, and those fighting them (like Amy's group) wear them.
    -   The eyepatches also act as kill-devices that electrocute their wearers to death once the Silence have no further use for them. As Kovarian learned the painful way when Amy forced hers back on.
-   Mikhail from _Lost_. The man survived many injuries (such a sonic fence-induced brain hemorrhage and being shot in the chest with a harpoon) relatively unscathed. It took the Word of God to convince fans that he _could_ die.
-   General Martok, of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, was already badass as a Klingon. Add to that the removal of his eye, the scar tissue that covered up the socket in a _natural_ eye patch, and his becoming the winningest Klingon commander of the war and eventually the new Chancellor, and you have a true badass.
    -   And on top of all that, in the Expanded Universe he becomes the _Klingon King Arthur_!
-   Humorously subverted in the Ferengi episode of _Star Trek: Voyager_. While Paris and Chakotay visit an alien planet, they're approached by a 'prophet' (read: con-man) who gives interpretations of sacred legends for a 'small fee'. This all works very well (though neither of them are actually fooled), until Paris dryly points out that his eyepatch was on the _other_ eye the last time they spoke with him. Said con-man then switches the patch to the 'correct' eye right in front of them and holds out his hand for payment.
-   Lily Charles of _Pushing Daisies_ is missing an eye due to an incident while cleaning cat litter and is definitely bad-ass, blowing her erstwhile assassin out the window with her shotgun after he thought her choked to death. Her lack of an eye is dealt with realistically, if a bit comedically, in that she misses the fact that Chuck, her niece/daughter, is back from the dead despite Chuck standing right in front of her. You see, Chuck just happened to be in her blind-spot at the time...
-   Space Commander Travis in _Blake's 7_ has a skinlike eye patch large enough for the Two-Faced trope to also apply. It's an injury inflicted by Blake in their Back Story, along with the damaged arm that's been converted into an Arm Cannon.
-   In the pilot for _Firefly_, Lawrence Dobson gets his eye shot out by Mal. Though he survives, he harbors a massive grudge in the tie-in comic _Those Left Behind_, and, as a nifty bonus, he gets a _seriously_ mean-looking cybernetic eye implant grafted onto the side of his head. This goes hand-in-hand with his boosted badassness by that point. Then subverted, as Mal ends up shooting him in the _other_ eye (and a few dozen other places).
-   Subverted in the Disney series _Wizards of Waverly Place_ during the _Harry Potter_ spoof school for magic (where everyone must wear a bathrobe over their clothes and a pair of glasses just like Harry's to accessorize the bathrobes) the rude upperclassman who acts as Justin's rival wears an Eyepatch over a functioning eye, not to make himself better but just to get out of wearing the dorky glasses.
-   _Babylon 5_: G'Kar was badass even before losing the eye, but gets downright messianic afterward. Also, his eye was part of a prophecy involving Londo - "saving the eye that does not see" is one of three actions that would save Londo from bad, bad things. He doesn't. Then the Drakh put a Keeper on him.
-   Xander from _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ got considerably more badass after Caleb takes out his eye during Season 7. This too subverts the "no lost depth perception" by having him state that he now has to renew his driver's license every year, due to his loss in depth perception.
    -   Though Dawn proves that even with his badass boost she is more badass by using a taser on him soon after waking up from him chloroforming her. While he's driving.
-   In the _Spin City_ episode "Grand Illusion", bumbling press secretary Paul Lassiter (Richard Kind) is forced to wear an eyepatch for several days because of an accident with his new toaster. Almost immediately, it starts taking effect: Women start finding him attractive, he's able to hold his own with the people who insult him, he makes sure the press have no questions at all and is even able to order his boss around a little. At the end of the episode, he decides he doesn't need the eyepatch in order to be confident and pitches it. Needless to say, it doesn't go as planned, and he ends up trying to find it again.
-   The magnificent Catalina Creel from _Cuna de lobos_, Evil Matriarch who uses her eyepatch to inflict guilt over her unfavourite son for the accident who left her blind on that eye. She also overdoes every telenovela villain ever. Her eyepatch is so vital to her that the first murder we see she does, in the very first chapter, is her husband's, because he discovered that the eye under that patch is _healthy_, and he wanted to uncover the truth.
    -   Another telenovela example is Arturo Peniche's character, Governor Fernando Sánchez de Moncada, from the recent Zorro telenovela - _Zorro: La Espada y la Rosa_ (Zorro: the Sword and the Rose). He's the father of the antagonistic sisters Esmeralda and Mariangel, both interested in the main character and wears a nice black eyepatch.
-   Richard "Yin Yang Man" Branden on _WMAC Masters_ wore an eye patch with a yin yang symbol on it however his is legitimately blind in that eye and sometimes during exhibitions he would actually use a glass eye with the symbol on it instead.
-   In the original television airings of _The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles_, there were segments set in the present day (the _then_ present, around 1992). These bits featured an elderly Indiana Jones, who wore an eyepatch over his right eye, and a pair of glasses over the patch. He also had a nasty facial scar trailing out from under his eyepatch. However, these 1990s scenes were all deleted in later airings of the show, and still haven't become available on home video. A time skip was involved here, because Indy still has both eyes in all the films so far (which cover events up to 1957, and when the _Chronicles_ first aired extended only to 1938).
-   One of the most popular characters on _Days of Our Lives_ in the late 1980s was Steve 'Patch' Johnson who (in his backstory) had lost an eye in a fight with the show's main hero Bo Brady and wore a patch. Steve's initial storylines included terrorizing Bo and his wife Hope but after a Heel–Face Turn, Steve reconciled with Bo and eventually married Bo's sister after taking over from Bo as the show's main hero when Bo was put on a sailing ship.
-   In _Tensou Sentai Goseiger_, the Seaick form of their Giant Robot, Gosei Great, has a literal Eyepatch Of Power; it not only adds to the pirate look of the mecha, it allows it to detect and target enemies.
-   In _Kamen Rider Decade_, the alternate Kamen Rider TheBee has one. He lost his eye to Souji.
-   In _Twin Peaks_, Nadine Hurley wears an eyepatch over her left eye after losing it in a hunting accident on her and her husband Ed's honeymoon. At the beginning of the second season after attempting suicide, she not only loses her memory but also gains Super-Strength. In fact, she's so strong, she accidentally _pulled a door off its hinges_.
-   In _NCIS_, Trent Kort seems quite unfazed and even more driven ever since losing an eye to the port-to-port killer and wearing a metallic eye patch. He even seems to enjoy the menacing look it gives him.
-   Michael "Archangel" Coldsmith-Briggs, CIA agent and Mission Control for _Airwolf_, loses an eye during the Grand Theft Prototype of the eponymous helicopter in the Pilot Movie. He wears a medical eyepatch at first, then for the rest of the series wears spectacles with one opaque black lens, in a variation on the trope.
-   A cutaway sketch in _The Young Ones_ involves a literal pirate radio DJ wearing an eyepatch. The trouble with that is, he's a cyclops. When his parrot shouts out insults he thinks the cabin boy's doing it.
-   Tom Croydon of _Blue Heelers_ first had a bandage, then a medical patch after the station bombing. He's implied to kill two criminals, threatens the jobs of those around him, alienates everyone who knows him and becomes a thug for the better part of the rest of the series.
-   A villainous example from _The Walking Dead (2010)_: The Governor, though already established as a _very_ dangerous man, eventually dons an eyepatch after Michonne gauges out his eye with a piece of broken glass, though unlike most examples it _does_ take a few episodes before he puts on the actual eyepatch, though the bandages he wears in that time could still count.
-   In _Arrow_, Slade Wilson wears an eyepiece that restores and enhances vision in the present-day timeline, having lost his right eye sometime in the past due to having an arrow stabbed through his eye by Oliver.
-   In _Mad Men_, after an incident while hunting with clients in Detroit, Ken Cosgrove wounds his right eye and is forced to wear an eyepatch.
-   One episode of _Combat! (1962)_, "Odyssey", has Sgt. Saunders pretending to a shellshocked German soldier named "Corporal Ernst Keller." Everyone buys the act, except for two characters: one is a particularly observant and highly decorated German orderly (the other is a German lieutenant later on). In an apparently intentional allusion to Polyphemus from _The Odyssey_, the orderly wears an eyepatch and does his best to "sniff out" Germans who are feigning their injuries, and Saunders has to continually outwit him.
-   Parodied in the _Supernatural_ episode "Pac-Man Fever". Charlie Bradbury is in a Lotus-Eater Machine where she's a video game Action Girl. When she first appears, she's wearing an entirely unnecessary eyepatch that she removes after her Big Damn Heroes.
-   _NTSF:SD:SUV::_: Kove wears an eyepatch, given that she's a female Nick Fury spoof.
-   Portrayed by Spongebob's voice actor, Tom Kenny, Patchy the Pirate is the President of the Spongebob Squarepants Fan Club. He sports a fashionable black eyepatch which serves seemingly no reason other than to make him appear more badass than he already is. He can be blatantly seen switching the eyepatch from eye to eye proving the previous statement.
-   In one episode of _Seinfeld_, Kramer sees a cop wearing an eyepatch and, thinking it looks cool, decides to start wearing one as well. His trademark klutziness exacerbates thanks to his now-limited field of vision, but he doesn't seem to care.
    
    **Jerry:** You look like a pirate!  
    **Kramer:** I _want_ to be a pirate!
    
-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_: Subverted in "The Light Brigade", in which the Chief Weapons Officer on a spaceship has an eyepatch like you might expect of a badass combat veteran, but when we see the Weapons Room everyone there has the same patch, which is revealed to cover an ocular implant for a Brain/Computer Interface.
-   _Motherland: Fort Salem_: Abigail's bodyguard Bridey has an eyepatch, a reminder of her failure to save her sister.
-   Colonel March sports one in _Colonel March of Scotland Yard_.
-   _The Boys (2019)_ has in the season 3 finale Maeve losing an eye fighting Homelander. Before she goes on exile with her girlfriend, eye still only covered in gauze, she asks whether to get an eyepatch or a glass eye. The girlfriend replies the first, certainly very aware of this trope.

    Music 

-   Following a childhood accident that left his left eye blind, British-American rapper Slick Rick is always seen with it as an Iconic Outfit.
-   Kansas guitarist Rich Williams, who lost an eye to a childhood fireworks accident. He used to have a glass eye, but now goes for this trope.
-   Country singer Dick Curless covered a bad right eye with his trademark patch.
-   Ray Sawyer of Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show has worn one ever since losing an eye in a car crash.
-   When David Bowie made a Dutch television appearance to promote his then-new album _Diamond Dogs_, his right eye was affected with pinkeye and he thus wore an eyepatch for the duration of it. The eyepatch was cool enough that his whole outfit became tied to the character of Halloween Jack (from the album's title track) for fans, despite him not wearing anything similar to it on the subsequent Diamond Dogs Tour. (His performance of "Rebel Rebel" from this show appears on the _Best of Bowie_ DVD set.)
-   When The Who performed _Quadrophenia_ at London's Hyde Park in 1996, lead singer Roger Daltrey wore a red, white and blue eyepatch after he got hit in the eye by Gary Glitter's mike stand during rehearsals.
-   Bushwick Bill of Geto Boys fame has sported one ever since a 1991 incident when he goaded his girlfriend into shooting him in the face. While holding their kid out a window. No, really.

    Music Videos 

-   The music video for They Might Be Giants' song "Hollywood House of Blues" involves an innovative alternative rock band called The Lads, whose lead singer wears an eyepatch. The eyepatch is also key to the greater success of Lads rip-off band The Blokes.
-   Pete Burns from Dead or Alive wore a spiffy black eyepatch in the video for "You Spin Me Right Round".

    Myths & Religion 

-   Odin, the chief god in Norse Mythology, is said to have plucked out an eye to gain wisdom from a magic well. Personal sacrifice to gain knowledge is actually a recurring theme for him.

    Podcasts 

-   _The Adventure Zone: Balance_ Merle receives one after giving up his left eye in "The Suffering Game".
-   In _Mission to Zyxx_ Pleck tries one out to look cool. He adopts it full-time after his eyeball hatches.
-   In the _Relative Disasters_ episode on the Roman invasion of Kush, Queen Amanirenas loses an eye in battle and continues to personally lead her army, though it's unclear whether or not she has a literal eyepatch.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Pirata Morgan took up a pirate gimmick after he lost an eye during a match. He usually wears a mask with only one eye hole rather than a patch but he has worn those too.
-   Rocky Romero takes to an eye patch when teaming with Alex Koslov as Forever Hooligans.
-   Bryan Danielson wore an eye patch after Takeshi Morishima punched him in the face and detached his retina.
-   Jimmy Jacobs took up an eye patch after his own spike was turned on him by Delirious, so he wouldn't miss the rest of Ring of Honor's early 2009 Canada tour.
-   Leva Bates as _Nick Fury: Agent Of Shield_.
-   Wonder Ring Stardom's Act Yasukawa wears an eye patch, partially due to being blind in one eye, though she can function without it. More importantly, she's from the same area as "the one-eyed dragon" Date Masamune, who also wore a patch.
-   Naomi Knight after having her orbital bone broken by Aksana.
-   Jon Moxley wore one after being stabbed in the eye by then-current _All Elite Wrestling_ champion Chris Jericho. He wore it for weeks, before pulling it off to reveal his eye was healed during his match against Jericho for the championship, using the surprise to pin Jericho and become AEW champion himself.

    Roleplay 

-   Paul Smith of _Survival of the Fittest_ has an eyepatch, having lost one eye after a freak barbecue accident (no, seriously). He is shown to be a more than competent fighter, being (as of the end of the 2007 school year) the second-best fighter in the school and certainly something of a badass.
-   Tom from _Ruby Quest_ has his right eye ripped out early on; he's left with an empty socket until he and Ruby find some gauze and bandages to make an eyepatch. Eventually, this is augmented with a "DO NOT OPEN" label. In this case it only serves as an apropos emblem of his supreme badassery, as his MANLY PHYSIQUE and inclination towards smashing things prove valuable assets throughout the course of the story.
-   El Cid Campeador from _Fate/Nuovo Guerra_ sports an eyepatch, and some facial scarring to boot. He also happens to be the national hero of Spain, and a heroic spirit capable of superhuman feats.
-   _Equestria Chronicles_: Behold Fidelity, badass pegasus guard, though outside guard situations she's not that good.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Deadlands_, one of the canon NPCs is a grizzled veteran of a dozen wars and conflicts with the supernatural who sports just such an eyepatch. The story goes like this: Hank Ketchum was laying in the surgeon's tent at the Battle of Gettysburg when his surgeon-to-be snapped. He had already lopped body parts off of a few other men before gouging out Ketchum's eye with a scalpel. What did the gruff Texan do? He _chased the surgeon away_, presumably with violence real and threatened. And that's why they call him One-Eye.
    -   Based off the John Wayne character Rooster Cogburn (see Movies above.)
-   There's a magic item in one _Dungeons & Dragons_ sourcebook called the Corsair's Eyepatch, which is transparent to the wearer so as not to impede vision. Depending on which eye it's worn over, the wearer can activate it to See Invisible, or gain the Blind Fight feat.
    -   And don't forget the Eye of Vecna. A cursed relic of an infamous arch-mage that requires the user to put out one of their own eyes and place the Eye of Vecna in the empty socket.
    -   Forgotten Realms has a lot of unusual magical items, including eyepatches such as the one worn by Jarlaxle (see above) and eyepatch of shooting stars.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Kommissar Yarrick replaced a missing eye with a bionic implant that could fire a laser in order to live up to Ork stories that he could kill with a glance.
    -   "Lord Prince" Yriel, an Eldar corsair turned High Admiral of Iyanden whose Eye of Wrath can blast everything around him once per game.
    -   All Navigators wear coverings of some sort over their third eye when not guiding a ship through the Warp, because eye contact with a Navigator's third eye is fatal.
-   _BattleTech_:
    -   Susie "One-Eyed" Morgaine-Ryan was one of the few surviving Bandit Kingdom leaders after the coming of the Clans wiped out almost all of the bandits in their path. That she not only survived but kept her unit intact _and_ captured some Clan Omnimechs speaks volumes about her credentials. Naturally, she looks and acts the part of a pirate queen.
    -   Anastasius Focht is never seen without an eyepatch, and though he's at least 50 years old by the time he shows up, he is both an accomplished Battlemech pilot and a strategic genius who turned back the Clans at Tukayyid. To beat one Clan is already a feat. To beat six out of the seven invading Clans on their own terms is pretty impressive. Focht is really Frederick Steiner of House Steiner, a disgraced minor scion who was found to be plotting treachery and was given the chance to make one last heroic stand against his nation's enemies instead. Instead of dying, he was shot in the side of the head—costing him an eye, but, as he notes, granting him new insight and maturity concerning the nature of politics and people.
-   Zigzags for _GURPS_, at least for some editions. "One Eye" disadvantage normally gives -1 reaction roll, but "If you have Charisma, or are Handsome or Very Handsome, the patch just looks romantic, and does not affect reaction rolls."

    Theatre 

-   The Maniac wears one (covering a perfectly functional eye) in _Accidental Death of an Anarchist_.
-   In _The SpongeBob Musical_, Plankton's actor wears an eyepatch to represent how the character is a one-eyed plankton in the cartoon.
-   Head god Wotan in _The Ring of the Nibelung_ is usually portrayed with an eyepatch, since he _is_ a version of Odin.

    Toys 

-   Big Barda is re-imagined as a space pirate with an Eyepatch Of Power in the _Ame-Comi_ Girls line of PVC statues from DC Direct.

    Video Games 

-   Dalton from _Chrono Trigger_, one of the villains in 12,000 B.C. He may not seem to fit the "of Power" part of the trope, being a arrogant blowhard who prefers for golems to do his fighting for him, but _Chrono Trigger DS_ proved him to be a Not-So-Harmless Villain.
-   In _Dicey Dungeons_, the Thief wears an eyepatch on his left eye, adding to his "rogue thief" aesthetic.
-   Kano from _Mortal Kombat_ had a red cyber-eye in a metal plate. Ironically, he's a bit of a jobber.
-   Sagat from _Street Fighter_ has an eyepatch, and embodies this trope to quite an extent.
    -   Juri Han wears one in _Street Fighter V_ when Bison rips out her cybernetic eye. She gets a replacement, but it doesn't look like a human eye, so she hides it with the eyepatch until she wants to use it.
-   _Soul Series_:
    -   Zasalamel from _Soul Calibur 3_ has a golden left eye, which is rumored to contain his immortal soul.
    -   In the Korean versions, Mitsurugi (a samurai) is replaced by a blonde English man with an eyepatch called Arthur. This allowed the makers to keep Mitsurugi's moveset in the game without offending the Korean players.
-   Heidern, Mature (in KoFXII/XIII only) and Ramon from _The King of Fighters_.
    -   Badass Rugal Bernstein, rocking the glowing red eye version. Double points for having lost that eye to the next game boss Goenitz back when both were younger. For worse, _he_ is the reason why Heidern is wearing his own 'patch... and why he lost his first unit and his family.
    -   And in the case of Mature, the eyepatch is actually a Power Limiter. If she takes it off, it's a clue that she's about to unleash a world of PAIN on you with the strongest super move she's got.
-   _Xenogears_ gives us not one, but two examples of this trope. Bartholomew Fatima, the ousted desert pirate prince of Aveh, and Sigurd, the Ambiguously Brown Pretty Boy who is Bart's brother with his eyepatch on the opposite eye. This becomes a plot point later in the game.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_:
    -   Zeke, who wears an eyepatch emblazoned with a turtle. He claims it conceals his "Eye of Shining Justice", which supposedly has enough power to reduce men to ash, but if his Blade Pandoria is to be believed, he just wears it because he was too poor to afford a contact lenses for a bad eye. A multitude of his battle poses have him with a hand in front of said eye as though he's channeling power from it. However, the addition of New Game Plus would reveal that the Eye of Shining Justice was Real After All. Working in a similar fashion to invoking Pnuema, the Eye will give Zeke and Pandoria a major speed and power boost. The right set-up could even kill the strongest superboss with ease.
    -   The Blades Praxis and Theory also wear an eyepatch; in post-battle banter, Zeke will accuse Praxis of "infringing" on his "copyright." Praxis retorts that she has an actual condition, so if anything he should lose _his_ eyepatch.
-   Vandham and his crew in _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_ bore eyepatches when he first encountered the six soldiers that he would empower with the Ouroboros Stone before his passing. Much later, after the party reach Swordmarch as Vandham had recommended, it's revealed that he and other denizens of the City wore these eyepatches over the eye that contained their Iris when out on missions with the Lost Numbers. These eyepatches had small fragments of Origin metal that served to obscure them from Moebius' tracking systems. The party would even obtain these eyepatches for themselves, and would be automatically equipped with them whenever they journeyed from the City; the Kevesi team members over their right eyes, the Agnians over their left.
-   From _Kingdom Hearts II_, Xigbar, of Organization XIII, plays this trope to the hilt. Not only does he have an eyepatch, but several scars running across his face. Of all the Organization, he carries himself almost like a seasoned warrior. At one point, he even hints to Sora that he has fought several Keyblade Masters before him. Except for Xemnas and Roxas, that's probably the closest any member of the Organization gets to having an actual backstory. It's confirmed in _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_ that he did in fact meet and fight previous keyblade masters— Terra, Ven, and Aqua. It's also confirmed in _Kingdom Hearts III_ that he's the current incarnation of Luxu, a _Keyblade Master_.
    -   Terra is also the one who gave him the need to wear an eyepatch in the first place, adding weight to his words in Kingdom Hearts II.
    -   Also in the _Kingdom Hearts_ series, Riku spends a long period with a blindfold on. It's not directly stated _why_ he wears it; the most explanation we get is Mickey in _KH2_ saying he wore it because 'his eyes couldn't lie', and when Sora asks who he was trying to fool, Riku says himself. It's also never made clear whether he can see through it, although the fact that he has lifted it on occasion suggests that he can't. Some of his more badass moments involve the blindfold. As Roxas found out the hard way, if he takes it off, you're on for a major beatdown courtesy of Xehanort's Heartless.
    -   DiZ uses a belt to this effect. Yes, on his head.
    -   Although there is nothing wrong with his eye, Sora wears an orange pumpkin mask over his right eye whenever he is in Halloween Town, serving as an eyepatch. Of course, it's still possible to see his covered eye in some cutscenes, and with the right angle with the camera in gameplay. In _Kingdom Hearts II_, the magic from Sora's drive attire would end up in his mask while in this world, allowing it to change shape whenever Sora uses a drive form. In the Final Mix version for the same game, Sora wears a black Santa Claus hat in Christmas Town that also covers his eye, though the right camera angle still makes the eye (but not the mask) visible. The magic from the mask is now transferred to the hat.
-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_:
        -   Subversion: when Naked Snake (later named Big Boss) gets his eye muzzle-burned and is rewarded with an eyepatch, he has quite a touching scene in which he attempts to catch a moth, but fails because of his poor depth perception. (Since Word of God says that Snake's codename was inspired by _Escape from New York_'s Snake Plissken, the eyepatch doubles as a Shout-Out.) The lead female expresses pity, but he shrugs it off. The first person view for the player goes a bit funny, too - the lost eye was his dominant one, so that's what he habitually aligns his gunsights to. Later in the game, however, he is wiring a base up with plastic explosive. He molds it into the shape of a moth, throws it up into the air, and catches it - "Got you this time," he tells it, then attaches it to the detonator.
        -   Strangely, in a later scene, the player needs to fire a sniper rifle at explosives to destroy the Shagohad, and when that fails he switches to an RPG, all of this with his standard pinpoint accuracy - which normally would be fine, except the sight is on the right side and cannot be moved. Guess which side his eyepatch is on. And the kicker? You can still see down the sight of the RPG in First-Person View. _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ and _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_ both allow Snake and Big Boss to fire their guns with either their left or right hands, which in the case of Big Boss would allow him to look down the scope/iron sight with his left eye. Such ambidextrous shooting however is never displayed by Big Boss in _Metal Gear Solid 3_, his eye patch must really have power if he can see through it even when it is on.
    -   One of his sons, later in the series's chronology, is actually happy to lose his eye in a plane crash - now he looks like his father. However, this is subverted, as an easy way to defeat him in the final boss battle is to approach him from the side of his missing eye, where he has a small blind spot.
    -   Furthermore, in _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_, Solid Snake is given the Solid Eye device, an advanced monocular display mounted in an eyepatch. Combat advantage? Definitely. Looks cool? Possibly enough to balance out the Dick Van Dyke mustache. In any case, it makes him look almost exactly like his father.
    -   In _Metal Gear Rising_, Raiden covers his damaged left eye with a cloth when he gets a new cyborg body, but the cloth is covered in sensors that act as a replacement eye, allowing him to keep full vision.
-   The titular character of _Monster Hunter (PC)_ is a one-eyed Hunter of Monsters skilled in using various weapons, and can take down hordes and hordes of deadly monsters.
-   _Wildcat Gun Machine_ sees you playing as an eyepatched mercenary, Cat, who slays monsters by the hundreds easily.
-   In early _World of Warcraft_ one of the most potent pieces of leather armor was an eyepatch called the Eye of Rend, which rather counter-intuitively increased your critical strike chance. Eyepatches still show up occasionally, where they provide just as much armor as a full helm of the same type.
-   Garrett of the _Thief_ series of stealth-based video games had his eye yanked out of his head during the events of the first installment, and had it replaced with a mechanical one that allows him to telescope his vision. While more of an extraordinarily skilled Deadpan Snarker than an out-and-out badass, he's still not someone you'd ever want to mess with.
-   In _Grim Fandango_ the protagonist Manny's sidekick Glottis, in awe after an eyepatch-wearing, gruff, salty sailor type has given a stirring speech, whispers "Wowww! Manny, could I have an eyepatch?"
-   Since the Yagyu Jubei from the _Samurai Shodown_ games is supposed to be the one from real life, he wears an eyepatch. Notable for him and Sagat earlier ... the nature of the graphics means the patch switches from one eye to the other when the character changes which way he's facing.
-   Sion from _Treasure of the Rudra_ not only has an Eyepatch Of Power but said eyepatch hides the Cosmic Keystone that got embedded in his eye after a battle against Surt.
-   Zato-1 from _Guilty Gear_ is blind and blindfolded (his name is a homage to blind swordsman Zatoichi). He's supposedly able to access better senses than with his eyes, which probably means that his shadow, the sentient bioweapon Eddie, sees for him. He _is_ reasonably badass...for a dead guy (though Eddie's also pretty badass itself.
-   Georg Prime in _Suikoden V_ wears an eyepatch over his left eye. Even with the handicap, he's considered the greatest swordsman around, with a reputation for defeating all foes with his first attack. He eventually tells the main character that in his youth, he was careless in a battle and was slashed in the face, only surviving because the main character's father rescued him. Still later, he reveals that the slash actually missed his eye, and that he wears the eyepatch as a reminder not to get too cocky. At that point he discards the eyepatch, deciding he doesn't need it anymore.
    -   Geddoe from _Suikoden III_ also wears one of these.
        -   Though in his case, it's actually handled somewhat more realistically; his accuracy stat is quite low, and the absolute worst of all the playable storyline characters.
-   James "Paladin" Taggart is depicted with an eyepatch in _Super Wing Commander_, though in the other _Wing Commander_ games featuring the character, he has the use of both eyes. He gains no special powers or abilities from missing an eye (indeed, as an AI wingman he is somewhat mediocre, even compared to other AI wingmen), but he is an experienced combat pilot whose career spans several decades.
-   _Fire Emblem_ has quite a few eyepatch wearers.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon & the Blade of Light_ and _Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem_ have General Lorenz of Grust. Malice, a character introduced in spinoff material before making her way into _New Mystery of the Emblem_, also wears one.
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_'s antagonist, Nergal, has one eye covered by his loose turban-like wrap, but that's as close as it gets... at least until the finale, when he takes it off to reveal some badass scars.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_ and _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_ have Haar, and the latter game introduces Nailah.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Awakening_'s Basilio, one of the Khans of Feroxi, sports one. It's also possible to give a build 2 Female Avatar one.
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates's_ Niles is a very cynical Anti-Hero, and wears a rather cool blue eyepatch with a star on it. It's also possible to give the Avatar one, whether in white or in black, no matter the build or gender this time. There's also the 'Cross Eyepatch' accessory one can buy and give to anyone in the party, but in this case, it's simply for Rule of Cool rather than necessity.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses's_ Dimitri, who is one of the protagonists of the game, wears an eyepatch after the timeskip in every route but Crimson Flower. It is briefly deconstructed in the advice boxes, where he needs eye drops to do paperwork.
    -   _Fire Emblem Heroes_: Many of the above also return for this game. In addition, Sutur's Perilous Seas alt sports one of these, and among the accessories are a few eyepatches that can be put on any character able to wear mask-type accessories.
-   Auron of _Final Fantasy X_ has one missing eye, partially concealed with sunglasses. Not quite an eyepatch, but it should be noted that after losing his eye, he took levels exclusively in badassery.
-   Likewise, in _Gungrave_, Grave lost his left eye when he was murdered. He wears glasses with the left lens blacked out and a white cross on top of that to conceal it, although sometimes his hair has the same effect. Like Auron above it's not quite an eyepatch but Grave did take several levels of badass after being resurrected.
-   General Beatrix of _Final Fantasy IX_ has a badass metal eyepatch, and the first fights against her cannot be won. The goal is only to survive.
-   Forcystus from _Tales of Symphonia_ has both an Eyepatch Of Power and an Arm Cannon that appears to replace his left arm (actually, his arm is inside the thing and can be seen during some of his attacks when the arm cannon opens up.
-   The Demoman from _Team Fortress 2_ wears one, and is actually quite bitter about having lost his eye, referring to himself as a 'black, Scottish cyclops'. His lack of an eye has minimal impact on the player when playing as him<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ; however, and he still performs quite adequately considering his weapon of choice is a grenade launcher.
    
    -   He seems _really_ bitter.
    
    _...prancin' aboot with yer heads full of eyeballs!_
    
    -   Seems to run in the family; a comic released prior to his (and the Soldier's) update reveals that both the RED Demoman's parents are blind, a result of the family profession being demolitions.
    
    **RED Demoman's Mum:** Mark me, boy: no Demoman worth his sulfur ever had an eye in his head past thirty!
    
    -   In one comics it was revealed that a wizard Merasmus took his eye, after a sentient book possessed the eye for the lols. In one of the Halloween maps, the players fight Merasmus, and the Demoman seems really eager to kick his ass.
    -   Taken to its logical conclusion when playing as a Demoknight<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  with the Eyelander sword or its functional equivalents. Such a Demoknight starts slower and weaker than a stock Demoman, but quickly surpasses stock after gaining enough heads from kills. Gaining heads also adds a glow in/over the eyepatch, possibly implying Magical Eye (Socket) is in play; the higher a Demoknight's headcount, the stronger the glow.
    -   Originally exaggerated for comedy with the Eye-Catcher cosmetic. Yes, it gives all classes an eyepatch, but concept art reveals the artist had wanted it to cover Demoman's _remaining_ eye. Valve nixed this idea, sadly denying players the comedy of a Demoman who can't see anything.
    -   In _Search for Sandvich_, whenever Gary Schwartz switches from Heavy to Demoman, he visually indicates it by putting on an eyepatch.
-   Sakuma from _Inazuma Eleven_ wears an eyepatch over his right eye. While part of Shin Teikoku, his right eye is visible through a hole in his eyepatch and he's revealed to have black sclerae, possibly a side effect of the Aliea Meteorite.
-   In _NieR Gestalt_, the Protagonist wears an eyepatch after the five-year Time Skip. His younger _Replicant_ counterpart does not.
-   Genshin from _Ninja Gaiden II_.
-   Drachma of _Skies of Arcadia_ has a literal Eyepatch of Power. The accessory he starts with is an eyepatch that increases his attack power slightly when he has it equipped.
    -   Vyse has an eyepatch-like lens over one eye - he has two good eyes, although the equipped lens is supposed to increase his accuracy. It gives him telescopic sight in that eye, too. The original lens is also replaced with one that allows him to see Moonfish in the remake.
        -   This carries over to his cameo in _Valkyria Chronicles_, where he retains his signature goggle patch and is easily one of the best Shocktroopers in the game.
-   Gippal of _Final Fantasy X-2_. The Mexican Standoff kind of forces that point home, too.
-   Lucian of _Lunar Knights_ has an eyepatch. He's also former prodigy member of the Three Gunslingers Sartana.
-   Wolf O'Donnell of _Star Fox_ goes through several variations of this. In the prototype _Star Fox 2_, he is depicted with a scar over one of his eyes, while in _Star Fox 64_, he sports an eyepatch (over the opposite eye), and from _Star Fox: Assault_ onwards, he wears a cybernetic eyepatch. Although some have assumed that his left eye is missing, his _Assault_ model shows that it is still there, and can even be seen during certain cutscenes. He's even seen without the eyepatch in his concept art.
-   Interesting example from the _Empire Earth_ opening movie. You see four warriors in four dramatically different epochs (stone age, British imperial age, second world war and the future). The stone age warrior has a white (blind) left eye, the imperial sea-captain has a cloth in front of his, the WWII commander has a standard black eyepatch and the futuristic warrior has a cyborg left eye.
-   Lord David from _The Last Remnant_ takes this to a particularly literal level. In battle, he wears an eyepatch that appears to be tied into the aiming or activation of the remnant Gae Bolg — an enormous energy cannon. It even has a name — "Kellendros" — and is described as the "Trigger device of the Gae Bolg", though it may be that Kellendros and Ex Machina (his uber gun) are dual triggers for it, since both are used to summon the extra uber cannon.
-   Alfred Woden of the _Max Payne_ series wears a special pair of glasses which are shaded over his right eye. This was meant to evoke Odin, as was his last name, since Oden himself wore an eyepatch, and thus establishes himself as the one running the show. Max himself notes "In the Land of the Blind, the One-Eyed Man is King"
-   Baron Praxis in _Jak II: Renegade_ has a highly visible bionic eye. His Dragon, Erol, ends up with only half his head semi-intact with a mechanical body, giving him his very own bionic eye (and face, and torso, and legs...). For a more heroic example, Sig has yet another bionic eye. Yeah, Naughty Dog Software seem to enjoy this one.
-   _Monster Hunter_:
    
    -   _Monster Hunter 3 (Tri)_: Your character has 2 if you are female and one if you are male, the female has an exclusive helmet in the deviljho gunner set with an eyepatch, and both genders have the Wyvernking Eyepatch which has 3 slots and is upgradeable.
    -   _Monster Hunter: World_ has the Dragonking Eyepatch, which gives two levels of the extremely strong Weakness Exploit skill and a deceptively high amount of protection. Plus it has this description:
    
    "Put this baby on to double your manliness instantly. Ideal for the grittier guys and gals."
    
-   In _Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction_, the Smuggler has an eyepatch. It's probably just for show though, since in his first scene he lifts up the eyepatch and glares at Ratchet with the eye underneath (which appears normal). Also, the eyepatch switches sides between scenes . . . and this _isn't_ a sprite game.
-   In _BlazBlue_, Nu-13 has an Eyepatch Of Power that is replaced by a visor whenever she activates the angelic-looking Murakumo unit. Disturbingly, the eyepatch in question has a design akin to a red sphere with a thick black stripe running down the middle at an angle. Note the similar design on the back of protagonist Ragna's right hand. In case it isn't obvious, Nu is _dangerous_.
-   _Persona 3_: Mitsuru's father, Takeharu, who runs the omnipresent Kirijo Group corporation.
-   _Persona 4: Arena Ultimax_ gives Marie the option of wearing an eyepatch over her forward eye whereas most other characters in the game have glasses. The eyepatch is a reference to the unnatural color that Marie's left eye attains in her dungeon in _Persona 4 Golden_.
-   _Persona 5_: The Twins, who serve as the game's ultimate Superboss, each wear an eyepatch on the opposite eye. Their true form, Lavenza, does not have one. Party member Ryuji Sakamoto's Fighting Spirit, a badass skeletal pirate, also wears an eyepatch, despite not having physical eyes anymore, because it goes with his pirate motif.
-   _Sengoku Basara_ has Date Masamune and Chosokabe Motochika. Masamune's eyepatch of power is so badass that it's a tsuba. You see.
-   Masamune also makes an appearance in _Samurai Warriors_ and _Warriors Orochi_.
-   In _Final Fantasy XI_, there is Balrahn, celebrated hero and Emperor of Aht Urghan, who in his day managed to collect 20 unique weapons (one for each job class, conveniently) as war trophies during epic battles with foreign powers. These "Mythic Weapons", now locked in the Empire's vaults, are obtainable by the player after completing a series of difficult and/or time-consuming tasks, one of which is to obtain Balrahn's Eyepatch, which is described as a sacred relic.
    -   Don't forget Gilgamesh, the pirate with an eye patch of power.
    -   ...And Moblin Maze Mongers event has an eye patch as a possible reward.
-   Averted in the later _Twisted Metal_ games with Calypso. As the organizer of the tournament, and a Literal Genie with all sorts of power, one would think an eyepatch would suit him. Except in the early games, he had both eyes, and in later games when he's missing one (with no explanation) _he gladly shows off the gaping hole_.
-   John Marston, the protagonist of _Red Dead Redemption_ wears one in the 'Deadly Assassin' outfit which, humorously, improves his slow-motion 'Dead-eye Aim'.
    -   Though some voice lines hint towards him possibly having a blind eye.
-   Ellie Langford, deutragonist of _Dead Space 2_ loses her eye to Titan Station's resident mental patient Nolan Stross, and it is shown in a rather humourous and awesome moment. "You owe me an eye, you bastard!"
    -   She gets a prosthetic in the sequel. Shame.
-   In _Splinter Cell: Conviction_, the imagery is evoked with both the co-op player characters rendered in the loading screen with their sonar goggles only covering one eye. This also applies to the enemy Splinter Cells. Appropriately, the latter are Elite Mooks. However, the biggest badass, protagonist Sam Fisher, wears his goggles covering both eyes.
-   Big Bad Morden of _Metal Slug_ bears one of these over his right eye. He lost that eye in the Central Park Bombing that also killed his young son, giving him his reasons for defecting from the Regular Army. Also used for a bit of Fridge Brilliance in Metal Slug 3... The Morden you fight at the midway point of the Final Mission has the patch over the left eye... it's a Mars Person in disguise.
-   Captain Price in _Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare_ invokes this with his night-vision goggles — it's more of a monocle.
-   Goro Majima of the _Like a Dragon_ series has an eyepatch over his left eye. It does little to stop him from being one of the series' canonically best fighters and consistently hardest bosses to fight. The fourth game shows that he got it due to refusing to sell out his Blood Brother and had it stabbed out by the tanto he now carries.
-   Iorveth, elvish terrorist/guerilla leader from _The Witcher 2_. Iorveth covers the remains of his right eye with a tilted bandana and has spent the better part of a century fighting humans.
    -   Sorceress Philippa Eilhart has both her eyes carved out as punishment for conspiration in The Witcher 2. In the next game she sports replacement magical eyes, only visible by a faint glow under her blindfold.
-   As with the Real Life person he's based on, Masamune from _Pokémon Conquest_ is the one-eyed warlord of Avia with dreams of uniting the entirety of Rensai under his rule. In fact, during the post-game challenge The Dragon's Dream, Masamune does just that. His Warrior skill is One-Eyed Dragon.
-   In _Super Time Force_, Commander Repeatski, savior of the world, has _two_ eyepatches, one for each eye.
-   A character customization option in _Star Trek Online_. Klingons get a leather patch with three metallic studs on it for free, and you can buy a pirate-style patch to cover either eye as a microtransaction.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction_, Pegasus sports a golden eyepatch over his left eye, covering the socket where his Millennium Eye used to be.
-   In _Billy vs. SNAKEMAN_, the titular Billy (a parody of Naruto) wears an eyepatch at level one. If you level him up once (by, specifically, defeating a pirate) he dons a second eyepatch over his other eye, which somehow makes him more powerful. And if you do the quest that gets him to level three, he dons a _third_ eyepatch. (Where he puts it, the game doesn't say.)
-   Taupy from _Sands of Destruction_ wears an eye patch over his right eye (except when he faces the other way). He lost it when he accepted a duel-by-proxy job and wound up fighting his best friend.
-   In _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, The Iron Bull wears an eyepatch over his left eye, lost to being gouged out by a flail while protecting Krem, a man he didn't know at the time, who later became his second-in-command.
-   Siripent has one in _Telepath Tactics_. It's never explained where he got it.
-   Keith Martin from _Time Crisis 5_.
-   Apparently the Hero of Time lost an eye at some point, because he has one eye blacked out (in both his human and wolf forms) when he appears as the Hero's Shade in _Twilight Princess_.
-   Two characters in _Evolve_ have these. Markov, the Sole Survivor of a corporate mercenary raid on his colony from either side, and Hyde, a Blood Knight veteran of The First Mutagen War.
-   Ana from _Overwatch_ was a crack sniper who had her right eye— a cybernetic one which gave her six times normal vision — shot out by a rival sniper via Scope Snipe. She now chooses to wear an eyepatch, despite the availability of medical options to replace the missing eye.
-   In _Darkest Dungeon_, the Man-at-arms is missing an eye, and his backstory comic doesn't give an explanation, although it shows that he was the Sole Survivor of his squad back before joining the heroes.
-   Viktor from _Paladins_ has both his eyes, but can wear different kinds of eyepatches as a cosmetic accessory. And Dredge the undead pirate.
-   _Yandere Simulator_:
    -   While the members of the Occult Club all have something covering one eye, they're considered creepy and aren't played attention to much (and it's possible none of them are actually missing an eye).
    -   Student Council member Aoi Ryugoku also has an eyepatch, and pulls off this trope much better (case in point, she's the _enforcer_ of the Student Council). Unlike the Occult Club, she is confirmed to be missing an eye. It's rumored Student Council President Megami Saikou has something to do with her missing eye but nothing's been proven.
-   _God Eater_ has a sniper, Gina with a purple eye patch over her left eye. Player characters can wear one too over either eye, with five different types to choose from. The two smaller variants however don't stick to the face fully, meaning that you can see under them with a proper angle.
-   Jacker of _Ghost 1.0_ has a cybernetic implant resembling an eyepatch which covers his left eye.
-   Kaeya, Fischl, and Beidou in _Genshin Impact_. Particularly Beidou as she is a pirate captain. She's also probably the only one who actually needs it as Kaeya and Fischl only wear theirs as stylistic choices.
-   Kiria from _Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE_ has an eyepatch in her Carnage form.
-   _Trails_:
    -   General Zechs Vander notably sports one of these, and is actually called "One-Eyed Zechs".
    -   Sigmund Orlando also sports one of these, presumably because mercenary work is particularly dangerous for eyeballs.
    -   Prince Olivert sports one of these from _Trails of Cold Steel IV_ onwards, as a result of surviving an assassination attempt by the Gnomes.
-   In _Final Fantasy XIV_, the fearsome Black Mages of ancient Mhach would wear eyepatches and wide-brimmed hats to obstruct the gaze of Voidsent abs prevent them from using eye contact to establish control over them, and this is reflected in how all the black mage artifact armor includes an eyepatch. Interestingly, though it’s never called out such, the same seems to go for Reapers, who wear eyepatches in their signature outfits and also deal with voidsent as part of their power.
-   In _Battle for Wesnoth_, the highest advancement of Thug, named Highwayman, wears an eyepatch. Fittingly, Highwayman is the strongest unit in terms of melee combat among the outlaw units.
-   Smith has one in _2Dark_
-   _A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky_: In one of Flavio's sermons, Desdemona reveals that she doesn't like her eyepatch's intimidation factor since it makes her for her to find love:
    
    **Desdemona:** It's the eyepatch, isn't it?! \[pause for player input\] I can't help it if it makes me look intimidating!  
    I've had it ever since that skiing accident in the fifth grade!
    

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   Apollo wears an eyepatch in the first and last two cases of _Dual Destinies_. This and his Coat Cape imply that he's become a ''lot'' more hard-boiled since the last game, but the eyepatch is actually a Power Limiter for his perception ability so he wouldn't have to notice Athena lying about her relation to his best friend's death.
    -   Dhurke Sahdmadhi, his foster father, also wears one. Ga'ran's propaganda certainly makes full use of it to make the rebel leader seem menacing. Subverted when it turns out that he's actually just a fun-loving goofball, but he still manages to pull off a few _terrifying_ Death Glares
-   How do we know M in _Shikkoku no Sharnoth_ is awesome even before he does anything? Guess. Interestingly enough, despite it being implied that the eye underneath it actually works fine, it is never removed.
-   Masamune Date from _Ikemen Sengoku_ is a handsome, cocky Spirited Competitor who wears an eyepatch over his right eye. He becomes even more badass when you learn the story behind his eyepatch: he lost his eye to smallpox when he was younger and after angsting about it for a while, decided to just cut short his self-pity party by asking one of his subordinates to cut the entire eye out for him. The female main character even thinks that "anything sounds good coming from a man with an eyepatch" in regards to him.
-   _Galaxy Angel_: Lester Coolduras, Tact's subcommander and best friend, always wears a rather cool-looking eyepatch over his left eye. One event in the first game has Almo and Coco asking Tact directly about it, and he can answer that he uses it to conceal a laser beam, an embarrassing birthmark that looks like a panda, or that he lost his eye in a duel with his father. All of these turn out to be jokes, as Tact immediately admits he has no idea because Lester never talks about it.

    Web Animation 

-   _Plan 3_: The cursed pirate has an eyepatch over his left eye. It’s not established if something happened to the eye before, or after he was cursed.

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_, Judy's kitten had survived an attack from a dinosaur and now sports an eyepatch. It still looks very cute. The President of the United States is also shown to have one.
-   Like her canon counterpart, Integra in _And Shine Heaven Now_ gets one in the end. During her brief period of unconsciousness, in which she talks with her mother, Integra admits that being able to intimidate people better with an eyepatch on was an experience worth living for.
-   Inverted in _Angel Down_ with Maria, who only wears her eyepatch at formal events. She mostly preforms her badassery while wearing a pair of blacked out sunglasses.
-   In the Bad Future in _Autumn Bay_, both Johnny and Dr. Deacon have one, though Dr. Deacon's is the cybernetic version.
-   Tony the Tiger in _Breakfast of the Gods_
-   _Champions of Far'aus_: Wila, who was the Hyperia Pantheons previous High priestess introduced in the "_Wills induction_" short story (which chronologically takes place years before the main story), had an eyepatch that covered up a scar where her left eye should be.
-   In _Commander Kitty_, CK himself tries to invoke this, though even he admits it's probably overdoing things.
-   _Crimson Flag_: Ludovic, Lord Julian's right-hand man, has an eyepatch, though it's also mentioned that he uses a depth-perception spell.
-   Nimmel Feenix from _Dominic Deegan_ had his right eye slashed to uselessness, so he combed his previously slicked-back hair in such a way as to cover it up. Curiously, The Infernomancer from who inflicted this injury _also_ sported an eyepatch of power ? a blindfold with long spikes on the inside, that concealed magically ever-bleeding eyes (the mark of the demonic pact that gave him his powers).
    -   At one point, Dominic was recovering from temporary blindness and had only gotten back his sight in one eye. He wore an eyepatch until his vision recovered; combined with his artificial leg, this gave rise to at least one pirate joke.
-   Fenny's manager, Missy, wears an eyepatch in the first two chapters of _Furry Fight Chronicles_ to cover her missing eye, which she gave to a demon for fighting knowledge.
-   In _Galactic Maximum_, one uses a knife in the gun fight
-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   The Smoke Knight Varpa is revealed to be hiding an eyepatch underneath the hood she keeps up and pulled over one eye.
    -   Captain Hawkins, a privateer working for the British, wears a bandanna over one eye as part of her very piratey outfit, she is also an excellent fighter.
-   Chief from _Goblins_ has a riveted-on eyepatch bearing his clan symbol (which was originally tattooed on near his lost eye. It doesn't make him markedly more badass, though. Most of the time.
-   Sydney from _Grrl Power_ got one for an hour or so after a an incident with a noodle. It heals up within a few hours, but she keeps it anyway.
    
    **Maxima:** Do you still need that eye patch?  
    **Sydney:** Um, no?  
    **Maxima:** Take it off.  
    **Sydney:** Aw.
    
-   Royce Lashiec of _Heartcore_ takes to wearing one after the Prologue Arc.
-   Vriska of _Homestuck_ sports one. Due to Ambidextrous Sprites, _which_ eye it covers is never officially determined. It isn't until later in the Hivebent arc that we find out how she lost her eye (and arm) in the first place.
    -   She later gets her eye and arm back, so she loses the patch.
    -   Sollux wears two eyepatches (one red, one blue) on the pirate ship in the Furthest Ring. However, the fact that he lost his eyes means that he lost the ability to produce his insanely powerful Eye Beams, so he's sort of an inversion.
-   In _It's Walky!_, Penny Worthington was _double_ the badass for wearing the eyepatch she took from her predecessor, Dargon Chesterfield, after assassinating him.
-   Nikolai Vankof, a former Soviet secret agent from _The Incredible and Awe-Inspiring Serial Adventures of the Amazing Plasma-Man_ has an eyepatch over his right eye.
-   Viktor Vasko of _Lackadaisy_ lost his right eye in a violent striker's rally, shortly before he became a rum runner for Atlas May.
-   This is parodied in _A Modest Destiny_; Maureen's younger brother wears an eyepatch to impress new thieves guild members because he thought Maureen's looked cool.
    -   And Maureen herself only wears her eyepatch to hide her heterochromia, which is seen as an ill omen.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Also parodied: Elan, after the time skip, is shown sporting an eyepatch... but one strip later it's revealed that he started wearing it because it made him look mysterious.
    -   Right-Eye, Redcloak's little brother, and later Redcloak himself, courtesy of O-Chul sport an eyepatch as well, although it actually covers a missing eye. In the case of the latter, while he does have the ability to regenerate it with cleric magic, Xykon forbids him from doing so, as punishment for delaying too long in Azure City in the aftermath of the siege. From that point on, whenever Redcloak looked in the mirror, he'd see the face of Right-Eye, whom he had sacrificed in service of The Plan, staring back at him.
-   Sarn Kellfrock of _Planescape Survival Guide_ is an ancient duergar dwarf cleric who lost his eye to the future god Bane while defending his own god (Jergal's) realm. His eyepatch of power comes into play later on when he takes Bane's eye out before killing the god single-handedly.
-   In _The Wotch_, there's DeFrain the Pirate - a member of La Résistance, whose piratey eyepatch hides a magical eye capable of seeing through anything, as well as detecting magical auras - handy for checking out whether a ship contains anything worth stealing. He also appears to be a Ninja Pirate.
-   Agent Jim of Mayu Zane's _Siege_ is nearly shot down in one scene because of a gunner on his left-and he's blind in his left eye, which he neglected to mention to anyone previously.
    -   There were previous references to his hidden face being badly hurt or burned, however.
        -   Zane would know-he's blind (or nearly so) in one of his eyes as a result of a detached retina.
-   From _Sidekicks_, Kyle (aka One-Eyed Shadow) is a villain-turned-sidekick who wears an eyepatch over his right eye. His right eye isn't seen when he enters a shadow-like form so it may not be functioning.
-   Hwaryun from _Tower of God_ ever since Bam cut her right eye. As a girl, all her eyepatches are also very stylish.
    -   Sachi Faker now sports a stylish black eyepatch-thing(?) over his left eye 600 years after he first took on the Hell Train.
-   The First Mate, Marge, of _I Was Kidnapped by Lesbian Pirates from Outer Space!!!_ sports an eyepatch.
-   The Suicide Girl from _Sexy Losers_. She's an animated corpse; the eyepatch covers the eye she accidentally shot herself through (she was toweling her hair and blindly picked up what she thought was her hairdryer; unfortunately, she kept her gun next to her hairdryer for some reason...).
-   In _The KAMics_, Ratatosk (self-proclaimed) god of the squirrels wears one to seem more Odin-like. Since both eyes are good he occasionally switches which eye it covers.
-   In Ben Croshaw's webcomic _Yahtzee Takes On The World_, the alternate universe Anti-Yahtzee has the token alt-self eyepatch, as well as the other inevitable deliberate clichés of the identical-but-opposite-color clothing and the typical facial hair inversion.
-   Vanka the theif from _Oglaf_, who wears a rolled headband with the hem positioned to cover her missing eye.
-   Kogeru from Rune Master: Tales of A demon Slayer wears an eyepatch on his (functioning) right eye, to cover the word "traitor" tattooed on its lid.
-   _Roommates_ played with this trope as two characters wore eye-patches. Odin is obviously a straight example, but the other one Mortal!Jareth an inversion as he literally had an _Eyepatch of Depower_ covering his left eye (he normally has heterochromia as a sign of his magical heritage), he got better.
-   Qamra Umar of _Pacificators_ fame lost an eye and an ear to a bomb. She covers it up with hair.
-   _Rhapsodies_: Commander Mercédès Vampa, Conal's commanding officer, and crush. (Apparently she stole her eyepatch from a pirate.)''
-   Myra Rienkemeyer from _Skin Deep._ Both her eyes work fine, but due to a damaged medallion the left one is stuck permanently as the Glowing Eye of Doom of her bugbear form. She keeps it covered with an eyepatch unless she's got her Game Face on.
-   The Raider, the most powerful and notorious villain in the world in _A Hate Story_, wears one to cover the blank spot where his left eye socket should be. He has Super-Senses, but notably poor depth perception.
-   Dante in _The Story of Anima_ wears a metal one over his magic eye.
-   The title character of _The Legend of Lucy_ wears one over her left eye.
-   _Unsounded_: Irma Keon, a powerful battle wright and Crescian state Aseptick, is introduced with a bandage over her right eye while decimating Aldish troops.
-   Val in _Val and Isaac_. Cybernetics exist in-universe, but Val's allergic, so she just covers up her missing eye. She's also a Badass Normal.
-   In a guest strip of _The Last Days of Foxhound_, after checking to see that nobody was watching him, Liquid decided to see what he'd look like if he had an eyepatch like Big Boss before him. However, the ghost of Big Boss is always watching...

-   Parodied in _Billy vs. SNAKEMAN_, where Billy's power is proportional to how many eyepatches he's wearing. When he reaches his highest level, he puts on a third eyepatch.
-   In a _Cracked_ article about soldiers shrugging off horribly painful and debilitating wounds, all of the top 3 had eyepatches. The article briefly commented by saying something along the lines "Having an eyepatch is like taking the express lane to being a badass."
-   Xinjao O'Reilly in _Tech Infantry_ wears one after being tortured by having a soldering iron thrust into one eye. This also comes shortly after he Took a Level in Badass and went from comic-relief engineer with a Porn Stash to resourceful leader of a guerrilla band of engineers and admiral of his own private mercenary space fleet.
-   Sylvester in _Twig_ loses an eye to the Baron Richmond, and sports an eyepatch until he gets it replaced. When he runs into the Baron again, though, he puts the eyepatch back on to disguise that he's filled his eye with massive amounts of poison so he can squirt it at people as a one-use weapon.

-   Sarge in _Agents of Cracked_ has one of these, although it's probably only for looks since it keeps switching eyes.
-   Apollo Z. Hack. No reason is given for why he wears it; it just looks badass.
-   _Board James_: Bad Luck Bootsy has an eye patch after he got stabbed in the eye by _Tornado Rex_ on his first appearance.
-   _Camp Camp_:
    -   Snake, whose name that doesn't hide who he is a parody of.
    -   Flower Scout Tabii starts wearing an eyepatch (caused by being hit in the eye by a fork... thrown by herself) in the same episode where she and her friends become drug lords that can even take down the Mexican cartel.
-   Colonel Blitzer from _Coyle Command_ has one. You may notice it switches eye from time to time.
-   Lord Commander Mason Garrilac of _Death from Above_ sports one. Presumably he lost his eye in battle, being a mech warrior. In one episode where he's piloting a mech and misses terribly he mentions lack of depth perception as the reason.
-   In _I Am Not Infected_ Amanda sports one in her first appearance. She quickly stops wearing it, and with it her status as a badass.
-   _Pirates SMP_:
    -   Invoked for Graecie, who started wearing her eye-patch because "that's how she earns respect around here", rather than being actually unable to see out of that eye. She also constantly lies about why she wears the eye-patch to everyone else. It's likely that she did so because while her faction, the Nightingales, get along with the other factions without much issue, they are also often overlooked for being "softies".
    -   Kuervo wears a gold-lined eye-patch; the finale reveals that it's a Battle Trophy from killing Commander Miria (the eye-patch's previous owner) of the Nayan Armada, from which (and more) he'd become a Defector from Decadence and gone on the run.
-   _World War II_: The series discusses the incredible exploits of British general Carton de Wiart who sports one of these after being shot in the face during World War I.

    Western Animation 

-   _Kim Possible_:
    -   Dr. Director and her evil (fraternal) twin brother have eye patches, and are some of the most competent fighters in the series. Dr. Director is primarily a parody/homage to Nick Fury.
    -   An extra in the "A Sitch in Time" DVD shows a future Kim as Dr. Director's successor. She also wears an eyepatch.
-   Parodied in _Rocko's Modern Life_, with the charter boat captain "Two-Patch" Crappie Jack (yes, that is his name). He can't walk too well. Two wooden legs. Can't steer too well. Two wooden arms. Can't see too well. Two wooden eyes.
-   While it's not technically an eyepatch, your chances of badassness go way up in _Transformers_ if you have one optic sensor rather than two. Shockwave is probably the most obvious of these.
    -   _Transformers: Animated_ shows it off well. Compare Longarm Prime to Shockwave.
    -   _Transformers: Prime_ gives one to Breakdown, after MECH removed his eye. Presumably Megatron forbids letting him get a replacement eye as punishment for getting captured by Puny Humans.
-   In _Codename: Kids Next Door_, the candy pirate Stickybeard has a patch. (_And_ a peg leg, _and_ a hook hand; he's pretty much Dressed to Plunder.)
-   _Bounty Hamster_: Marion, one of several shout-outs to _True Grit_. Alt!Cassie from "Twin Cheeks" also has one.
-   Matrix, the grown-up Enzo from _ReBoot_'s third season, has a golden cybernetic eye that provides super targeting abilities, which he received after the original was cut out. By THE DEVIL in a _Mortal Kombat_\-ish game.
    -   Parodied with the pirate bi-nomes. There's at least one "zero" bi-nome with two patches that optionally hide two good eyes, and there's at least one "one" bi-nome with a single patch over it's only perfectly fine eye.
-   Gutierrez, Ricardo Montalbán's character on _Freakazoid!_, had an eye patch. When he transformed into his "super freak" form, it had an eye painted over it, and an energy weapon behind it.
    -   Subversion: His eye is perfectly normal before he mutates, and this eyepatch is important to his painful defeat.
-   Falcon 7, Birdman's boss in _Birdman (1967)_ has an eyepatch. That, of course, becomes a source of many jokes in _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_, where Falcon 7 becomes Phil Ken Sebben.
    -   Ha _ha!_ Power!
    -   In the "New Year's Eve Party at Brak's House" series of bumps, Hesh doesn't believe that Phil needs the patch, calling it 'Your Bum Eye And How It Doesn't Exist'.
-   Hudson, from _Gargoyles_, has only one good eye due to a wound that either stayed with him due to its magical origin or didn't heal properly before sunrise. In either case, throughout the series it's implied that while he might be getting a little old and slow and even his good eye is starting to fail, he's a canny warrior whose insight is invaluable.
-   The Pirate Captain from _Mike, Lu & Og_ has _two_ eyepatches (as well as two wooden legs). This doesn't seem to slow him down much, although he's not very badass because he and his men are always being defeated by a bunch of kids.
-   Popeye, while not wearing an eyepatch, misses one eye. He just keeps eyelids permanently closed.
    -   I thought it was a stroke.
-   Subversion during the pirate episode of _The Backyardigans:_ Uniqua has an eyepatch, but she only wears it to show she's a pirate. In other words, Eyepatch Does Nothing during the episode.
-   Parodied in _The Tick_ episode "That Moustache Feeling", where the Tick meets Jim Rave, Agent of S.H.A.V.E.. Rave is a Nick Fury lookalike, down to the eyepatch-but at the episode's end, the Tick realizes Rave isn't a _real_ special agent because he still has both eyes-the eyepatch is just there to make him look cool.
-   Tako from _Sushi Pack_ wears a fake eyepatch that does not diminish his fighting prowess in the least. Then again, considering that his main attack is flinging paint at enemies, direct aim may not be crucial.
-   Suzi X from _The Haunted World of El Superbeasto_.
-   Pariah Dark in _Danny Phantom_. Probably doesn't suffer any depth perception since he's a ghost.
    -   The once useless Box Ghost will eventually become a Future Badass who can fight on par with any of the major villains. His secret? An eyepatch.
-   _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ gives us resident badass, Hoss Delgado. Complete with Swiss-Army Appendage.
-   Gibbs in _Titan Maximum_, who's both the main villain and probably one of the smartest characters in the series.
-   In _Street Sharks_, big bad villain Dr. Paradigm wears an eyepatch for no explained reason. He starts off the show as an implied college lecturer. It's somewhat badass in context.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_:
    -   Officer Shallowgrave wears an eyepatch.
    -   In one of the _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_ shorts, Cosmo and Wanda wear eye patches while playing pirate. Wanda tries wearing two at once.
-   _G.I. Joe_
    -   While villain Maj. Bludd's _actual_ status as a badass is more than a little questionable on the show, the patch at least made him _look_ suitably badass. His _Renegades_ incarnation, however, has _more_ than earned his badass cred (and likely the eyepatch itself) in his debut episode.
    -   Zanzibar the Dreadnok Pirate has one, but his teammates think it's for show, as he's little more than a Spoiled Brat who _thinks_ he's badass.
    -   Gen Abernathy from _G.I. Joe: Renegades_ sports one of these.
-   Something of a subversion on _Captain Planet and the Planeteers._ Mad Scientist Dr. Blight is blonde, but wears one shock of long white hair over one of her eyes. This would seem to be this trope... except that the hair is actually hiding the fact that part of her face is deformed.
-   Alejandro gets punched in the eye in an episode of _Total Drama World Tour_, resulting in him having to wear an eyepatch for the rest of the episode.
-   On _Jimmy Two-Shoes_ the bailiffs in the Horn Fairy Court wear eyepatches with stars on them.
-   The lead character of _Danger Mouse_ has one. People who worked on the show can't seem to agree on whether he lost an eye or he just has it to be fashionable.
    -   The current reboot kits DM with an eyepatch with modern technical advances (it's an "i-patch.")
-   Jonathan Kidd, the commander of the _Voyager_ in the _Fantastic Voyage_ animated series.
-   In _Gravity Falls_, Grunkle Stan wears an eyepatch over a perfectly healthy eye in order to fit into the Mystery Shack's mood of strange and paranormal.
    -   He wears it _over his glasses!_
    -   Dipper borrows the look in "Boss Mable" when Stan's on vacation, as does Soos when he becomes the new manager of the Mystery Shack following Stan's retirement in the Grand Finale.
-   Mr. Fischoeder, the wealthy, eccentric, Affably Evil landlord on _Bob's Burgers_ wears an eyepatch. The story behind it (he lost his eye while roughhousing with his brother as a child) isn't very impressive, though.
-   In _Cat City_ the Dragon-in-Chief Fritz Teufel wears an eyepatch. When it gets torn off in the climactic fight, we get to see a ruby in his eye socket.
-   Nick Fury's becomes a plot point in _Spider-Man: The Animated Series_, due to a flipped picture printed by J. Jonah Jameson. The backwards picture is used by Chameleon to pretend to be Fury, only for everyone who's met him to figure it out.
-   Evil Morty, from _Rick and Morty_ wears an eyepatch as a reference to this trope and as an Evil Twin. Both of his eyes are actually fully functional, but he uses the eyepatch as a device to remotely control Evil Rick. At the end of the episode, he got rid of the eyepatch when Evil Rick was killed.
-   _Dawn of the Croods_ features Amber, the lead hunter of the community who wears an amber rock in her eye. Although jokes are made about her missing an eye, in one episode she gives the rock to Ugga as a symbolic gesture and everyone is surprised to find the eye underneath is just fine.
-   _The Penguins of Madagascar_:
    -   Doctor Blowhole has a very functional cybernetic one on his missing right eye. He has a laser in it and once uses it as a remote control to his "scooter one-wheel thing."
    -   The Red Squirrel has one. He has a button to launch a rocket under it.
-   Given an interesting twist in _Aaahh!!! Real Monsters_. Krumm and his father Horvak are both monsters consisting of a Cephalothorax that carry their disembodied eyes in their hands. However, Horvak lost one of his eyes when it was mistaken for a musket ball and so he carries the remaining eye in one hand while in the other he wears _a black leather glove_.
-   The pirate captain Two-Eyed Alonso in _The Adventures of Puss in Boots_, as his name (sort of) suggests, combines this trope with Extra Eyes.
-   _Peter Pan & the Pirates_: One antagonist was the ghost of Captain Hook's brother, Jasper Hook, who was known as "Captain Patch" because he had an eye-patch to go with his brother's Hook Hand.
-   Kwazii of _The Octonauts_ wears one, as he was a pirate before he became an Octonaut and still affects some stereotypical piratical behaviors (other than plunder, of course). While it's never explicitly stated, he most likely wears it for the "able to switch between light and dark areas" reason - a few times, he lifts it up and shows that he still has both eyes.
-   _We Bare Bears_: Wallace, one of the Poppy Rangers, has an eye-patch she apparently gained trying to earn one of her merit badges. She apparently has no regrets.
-   Octavia in _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_ wears her Force Captain badge as an eyepatch, covering the damage done when a young Catra scratched her on the eye.
-   In _Teen Titans Go!_, Beast Boy gets an eyepatch made out of a metal plate and a chain as part of his "Scar Man" persona in the episode "Man Person".
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: Parodied in "Arrgh!" when Spongebob and Patrick cosplay as pirates. Patrick puts eyepatches over _both_ eyes and calls himself "Blindbeard the Pirate". Of course, he can't see anything and trips, so he removes them.
-   In _Captain Pugwash_, Pugwash's Arch-Nemesis Cut-Throat Jake sports an eyepatch and a Seadog Beard.
-   _Pibby_: The trailer shows Pibby with an eyepatch on after she receives an injury to one eye. It ties into her maturation and Character Development, as several scenes afterward show her acting as a sword-wielding leader.

    Real Life 

-   U.S. Representative Lt. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) wears an eyepatch (and, in conjunction with his beard, arguably looks not unlike Big Boss.) A former Navy SEAL, Crenshaw lost his right eye in an IED blast in Afghanistan. Beneath it, he sports a glass eye with a Captain America emblem, which he showed to Chris Evans.
-   One of Alexander's generals (and a later ruler in his own right), Antigonus, was known by the nickname _"Monopthalmus"_, or "the One-Eyed". Alexander's father Philip II of Macedon was one-eyed as well but lacked an eyepatch. After his damaged eye had been surgically removed, it was then sewn shut defeating the purpose of an eyepatch completely, though some portrayals do feature him with one.
-   Though he didn't wear an eyepatch, Horatio Nelson lost the sight in his right eye. He later went on to be arguably the most famous admiral in history. He famously ignored a signal not to engage a Danish fleet by holding his telescope to his blind eye and asserting that he could not see the signal to hold back. He went on to decisively win the Battle of Copenhagen. This event is considered the origin of the idiom "to turn a blind eye." As Captain Jack in the _Aubrey-Maturin_ series put it, "Lord Nelson is a man of singular vision."
-   Hannibal Barca lost his eye while on the march from pink eye. Not long after this he launches a massive ambush on Roman forces in the Battle of Lake Trasimene.
-   Date Masamune lost an eye as a youth, and thus is often depicted as wearing an eyepatch. It didn't hinder him much, as he went on to defeat Japan's prominent strategists of the time. Legend says that he ripped it out himself when it was rendered useless by smallpox (though this is highly unlikely given that he was a young child when he contracted the illness). It earned him the nickname of One-Eyed Dragon; though it started off as a comment on his reckless nature, it later in his life became a term of respect. He is almost always portrayed with an eyepatch in fictional appearances, even though there's no record of him wearing one in real life.
-   Xiahou Dun, a Chinese general serving under Cao Cao during the late Eastern Han Dynasty. Reputedly, he was such a badass that, when an arrow shot him in the eye, he plucked it out and _swallowed it to instill fear in his enemies._ In most literary and pop culture depictions of him (read: _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_), he's wearing either an eyepatch or a bandanna around his eye.
-   Yagyu Jubei, one of the most famous and romanticized samurai of all time, is a somewhat more ambiguous case. Although portraits from his own time show him with two eyes, somewhere along the line of centuries spent telling and retelling his story it became traditional to depict him wearing an eyepatch. Whether the historical Jubei ever wore one or it comes from Kabuki exaggerations is open to debate, but it has become a traditional part of his character, usually with the explanation that he lost it as a child while training. Other movies show him being wounded by a cut to the face as an adult, but developing his skill to greater degrees afterwards.
-   Moshe Dayan, Israeli General and Defense Minister (including during the Six-Day war — when Israel battled against 3 armies and still managed to triple its land mass in six days), lost his left eye while infiltrating Vichy France-controlled Syria in WWII; the binoculars he was looking through were shot and the glass and metal destroyed his eye socket (the bulk of the binoculars probably slowed the bullet enough to save his life). He didn't like his black eyepatch (he went through several unsuccessful surgeries in an attempt to be rid of it), but it did make him look pretty badass. Nor did it slow him down when it came to the ladies — his first wife wrote a whole chapter of her autobiography about "Moshe's bad taste in women." When he was once stopped for speeding (with fellow minister/future PM and President Shimon Peres next to him), he told the police officer, "I can either look at the road or at the speedometer. Which would you prefer?"
-   Jan Žižka had already lost an eye, either in battle or due to a childhood accident depending on the source, by the time he became the leader of the Czech rebel faction in the Hussite Wars. He soon lost the other one as well but continued to lead his troops into battle personally despite being _completely blind_. As is fitting for a man of his stature, he is the subject of the world's tallest equestrian statue in Prague.
-   John Pendlebury, a famous archaeologist lost one eye, and made a point of being better at athletics because people assumed he couldn't. He later became a war hero in WWII, fighting Nazis in a critical battle on Crete.
-   Canadian Léo Major during WWII lost an eye in Normandy. He refused to be brought back home, saying that he "only needed one eye to aim at Germans". He went on to liberate a city (Zwolle) in the Netherlands from an entire German squad _on his own_ by firing multiple rifles and throwing grenades, making the Germans rout as they believed they were being attacked by an entire platoon. He was actually awarded three DCMs, but turned the first one down because he thought General Montgomery, the man awarding it to him, was too stupid to be handing out medals. He died in 2008, and the Dutch Ambassador to Canada was present at his funeral. The city he liberated held a vigil.
-   Director Raoul Walsh lost an eye in a car accident, and took to wearing a very large black eyepatch. Opinions on his films remain pretty mixed (a common statement is that he "never let the truth get in the way of a good story," due to films like _Gentleman Jim_ and _They Died With Their Boots On_ taking significant historical liberties) but he's certainly one of the toughest looking directors ever. He also directed _The Roaring Twenties_, _High Sierra_, _They Drive By Night_, _White Heat_, and many other famous gangster films. _White Heat_ in particular was the most violent film at the time of its release, broke the censorship code completely, and caused several revisions to the Code, ultimately leading to its downfall twenty years later. _High Sierra_ was also one of Humphrey Bogart's first not-completely-villainous roles, and led to his general stardom.
-   Many directors of The Golden Age of Hollywood suffered accidents in their eyes that led to them wearing eyepatches which helped give them an aura of authority and respect that maintained discipline on set. John Ford, Fritz Lang, Andre de Toth and Nicholas Ray. The reasons why they wore eyepatches varies, with Lang having a weak eye on account of his service in the military during World War I while others insist they wore it as a cool accessory.
-   Pirates during the Golden Age of Piracy are often depicted with eyepatches. This might have come from pirate captains who, needing to go above and below decks constantly, would put an eyepatch over one eye above deck to avoid losing their dark-vision in that eye. The tales of Arab pirate Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalahimah, who wore it after losing an eye in battle in the 18th century, adds further fuel to the image.
-   The logo of the now-Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League invokes the trope as part of their bad-boy outside-the-law image.
-   Crime novelist and child protection lawyer Andrew Vachss.
-   Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, a German soldier and aristocrat who lost his left eye, right hand, and two fingers from his remaining hand during an Allied air raid. He was the German equivilent of a Colonel Badass and had won the Iron Cross before becoming completely convinced that Hitler needed to be killed. He took a leading role in the 20 July Plot, the closest anyone ever got to assassinating Hitler. He was popularly portrayed in the film _Valkyrie_.
-   Steve Watt, a Wyoming State Trooper, was shot five times by a bank robber, one bullet of which came within about a paper's width of damaging his brain. Fortunately, he got better. While he isn't a State Trooper anymore, his eyepatch now undoubtedly adds to his presence as a D.A.R.E. instructor and ordained minister.
-   As an aside, losing an eye would have very little, if any, effect on long-range rifle accuracy such as sniping (presuming it wasn't their dominant eye) - in fact, USMC recruits (at least as of the early 90s) would be taught to close the eye opposite the one being used to sight with, and even issued an eyepatch to cover that eye until they could break the habit of trying to use both eyes. At ranges over about 100 meters (give or take), human eyes simply aren't far enough apart to contribute greatly to depth perception, and visual references (the car or doorway the opponent is standing near, for example) are much better for use in estimating distance.
-   Lieutenant-General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart was an Anglo-Belgian aristocrat, soldier and diplomat, was wounded seven times during the First World War, losing his left eye to a bullet and having his hand so badly mangled he bit his own fingers off. He went on to win a Victoria Cross at La Boiselle, afterwards saying, "Frankly I enjoyed the war." He spent the inter-war period with the British military mission to Poland, fighting off Red Army cavalry with a revolver at Warsaw. When WWII rolled around he escaped Poland just ahead of the Wehrmacht, led an amphibious assault on Norway and was transferred to the Mediterranean just in time to be shot down and captured by the Italians, escaping five times despite being over sixty and speaking no Italian. Released as part of Italy's surrender in '43 he was then sent as Churchill's personal representative to China, where he called out Mao Zedong to his face for holding back from fighting the Japanese, in favor of fighting the Nationalists. He did all this looking much like Brigadier Lethbridge-Stuart's evil counterpart<small>◊</small>, with a black eyepatch and a black moustache. A badass mofo in anyone's book and one of those crazy career soldiers Britain seemed to turn out like a production line prior to WWII.
-   James Joyce often wore one. He was troubled by eyesight problems for much of his life, and underwent numerous eye surgeries.
-   Chilean TV host and Intrepid Reporter Santiago Pavlovic lost an eye in a childhood accident. He now wears a spiffy eyepatch to cover it.
-   Russian field marshal Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov, widely considered the best of Suvorov's pupils, got to wear one after his right eye was injured by a musket ball (twice) and he started to get splitting headaches from its use. It also contributed to the myth that he was one-eyed.
-   War Journalist Marie Colvin lost sight in one of her eyes due to a being caught in the blast of Sri-Lankan Army Rocket Propelled Grenade in 2001. She took to wearing an eyepatch after losing the sight in her eye due to the damage done to it.
-   British nuclear bomber crews were issued with eyepatches for fear that in a war they'd be blinded by all the atomic weapons going off. When one eye was blinded by a nuclear flash, they were supposed to switch over to the other, and hopefully there'd be a crewmember still able to see by the time they reached their target (returning home was not an issue, as there wouldn't have been enough fuel anyway).
-   Eyepatches are frequently used to correct amblyopia (lazy eye), especially in children.
-   Economist Richard W. Rahn, a senior fellow at the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute, wears an eyepatch over his right eye<small>◊</small>.
-   The Austrian general Adam Albert von Neipperg lost his right eye to bayonet wounds at nineteen, in 1794 and wore an eyepatch after that. Historians mentioning him in passing often make a point of saying that this took nothing off his charm, and indeed, he became the lover and eventually morganatic husband of Marie-Louise, Napoleon's second wife.
-   Ana de Mendoza, a Spanish noblewoman of the 16th century famous for her beauty and court intrigues, wore an eyepatch over her right eye.
-   Even though duelling was outlawed in Prussia in 1851, and the rest of Germany upon its' founding as a result, German university fraternities still practised fencing duels, the idea being to slash the opponants' face in order to win. The scars were worn as a badge of honour, likewise a missing eye. Thus explaning why almost all fictional aristocratic villains of Germanic heritage would either sport a facial scar on the left of their face(Schmisse), or an eyepatch.
-   A subverted example comes in the Oath Keepers' founder, Stewart Rhodes. In 1993, he reportedly dropped a loaded handgun and it shot him in the face, blinding him in his left eye.
