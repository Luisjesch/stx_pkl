_One engineer begins to laugh, seemingly unable to stop. Another weeps. The tears scorch his face like kettle-water. A third frantically tries to write down what you said, but gives up when her third pen combusts in lavender flame. "This changes everything," a grease-stained engineer whispers. Later, his colleagues catch him out back, burning his collected volumes of the Transactions of the South Wales Institute of Engineers._

So, we all know that every time you show dinosaurs and cave-people together in the same era a palaeontologist cries. Probably not literally, of course. You'd have to be fairly unstable to be brought to tears just because some TV show took some artistic liberties. After all, it's just a show...

However, if a scientist or other expert saw this kind of defiance of the laws of the universe taking place _right in front of them_, it's likely that they would be a bit shaken up.

_All those years of careful study and research suddenly proven wrong..._ _NOOOOOOOOOO!_

This trope occurs when the expert in question is a character in the work who becomes upset that their reality is blatantly defying the laws of nature, physics, etc. This may manifest as actual crying, Unstoppable Rage, or even a nervous breakdown.

Often Played for Laughs as a form of Lampshade Hanging\- the author is demonstrating that, yes, they know perfectly well that it doesn't make sense, and are giving the viewer a gentle reminder not to take it too seriously.

If the professor is already aware of the existence of other magic, aliens, etc, then his disbelief is Flat Earth Atheism or Arbitrary Skepticism if he'll believe in some paranormal/supernatural stuff, though not others. Often happens to the Agent Scully.

Compare This Cannot Be!, another trope about characters being confounded after seeing something that proves them wrong. Contrast Admiring the Abomination, when the Professor is pleased rather than alarmed at a sudden scary turn of events because it's proved him _right_.

    Comics 

-   Reed Richards in _Fantastic Four_ does this all of the time, which is itself an incredible source of Fridge Logic, given he can stretch and bend like he's made out of goddamn Silly Putty.
    -   He can deal with comicbook superscience — _magic_ continues to confound him.
-   This angers Homer of all people in The Simpsons comic edition where Professor Frink uses his latest device to grant Homer increased intelligence. He rails on the impossibility of dinosaurs co-existing and fighting humans while watching a B-Movie, much to Bart's surprise.
-   "An Insult to Science" in Warren _Vampirella_ 57 features a professor whose profession is unmasking false mediums. He stumbles directly into a ghost story. He takes the insult with astonishing dignity.

    Fan Fiction 

-   In _Challenge of the Super Friends: The End_, Lex Luthor repeatedly underestimates The Benefactor's claims of ruling an entire universe, reasoning that the distances would be just too great. Apparently such claims are true.
-   In the final chapter of _Yabba Dabba Joes,_ a paleontologist working on Sue the T-Rex's skull before she goes on display goes into a temporary brain shutdown when he pulls a nine millimeter bullet out of a pockmark on Sue's jaw.
-   Ritsuko in _Shinji And Warhammer 40 K_ suffers a serious blow to her sanity after repeatedly witnessing Shinji playing Reality Warper with his AT-field wizardry and psyker abilities without finding ANY scientific explanation for it. She learned to cope via ranting and publishing scientific papers on the latest proof-by-Evangelion that physics don't work; the hate-mail keeps her going.
    -   In the Anime/Addventure thread "Switching Places/Eva", she has a similar reaction to Ranma. And to his habit (which most of the rest of the cast has picked up) of calling the Angels "kaiju."
-   In _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_, Harry took the revelation of the existence of magic in stride, because once he realised that magic follows certain rules he realised he could apply the scientific method to reconcile it with the known laws of physics. Nevertheless, he has a mild freak-out when contemplating the Shapeshifter Baggage of Professor McGonagall turning into a cat.
    
    "You turned into a cat! A _SMALL_ cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signaling!"
    
-   In _The Weaver Option_, Dragon occasionally longs for a nice corner in which she would sob over sanity's demise. It mainly happens right after she witnesses various sorcerous phaenomena or the Orks' utterly absurd constructs.
-   In _Dawn Comes on the Sunset Sea_, CAN researchers are _not_ coping well with Westerosi society evoluting in a quasi identical way to Earth. One is outright drinking onscreen while several others suffer nervous breakdowns.

    Film 

-   A benign version would be Ellie and Alan's miniature freakout the first time they see a dinosaur in _Jurassic Park_. They're more broken by the sense of awe than anything else, and a few minutes later Alan is observing the movement patterns to confirm one of his theories.
    
    _They_ DO _move in herds._
    

    Literature 

-   In _The Last Continent_, Ponder Stibbons has some difficulty adjusting to the idea that the deserted island he and the rest of Unseen University's senior faculty are trapped on is actively supplying them with the means to live. Further, he's pretty disillusioned to learn that evolution isn't a wonderfully elegant self-driving force, but is driven by an inept god like everything else on the Disc. But what _really_ pushes him beyond the breaking point is learning that said god doesn't regard _humans_ as the pinnacle of evolution for their sapience, but instead assigns that role to **cockroaches** for their durability.
-   In Ted Chiang's story, _Division by Zero_, a mathematician tries to commit suicide after she proves that arithmetic is inconsistent and that through formal mathematics, one can make any two numbers equal each other.
-   The short story "Flashes" by Robert J. Sawyer is about most of the scientific community of Earth being broken _en masse_ by a broadcast of the Encyclopedia Galactica that claims that aliens have disproved many of Earth's established scientific theories. Why the scientists are not trying to repeat the aliens' experiments is not discussed in the story.
-   Jules Verne's _Journey to the Center of the Earth_ pits geologist Otto Lidenbrock (who clings to a hollow earth theory) against our narrator, Otto's nephew Axel (who knows that Science Has Marched On and that the Earth is heated from the inside, and thus that the journey makes absolutely no sense and will inevitably end in heat suffocation). Hilarity Ensues when Axel is forced to change his mind.
-   In _The Three-Body Problem_, several scientists commit suicide when the data collected by particle accelerators appear to be completely inconsistent, due to Trisolaris' sophons.

    Live-Action TV 

-   This is actually a plot point quite often on _Fringe_. In a season 3 episode, Walter was confused and upset when the densest element (Osmium) was used by another scientist (who stumbled upon it and has no idea why it's doing this either) to make people float in the sky. Yes, it makes no sense. As it turns out, this lapse in the laws of physics is a sign that our universe is about to collide with another one and destroy them both.
-   _Doctor Who_: In "The Husbands of River Song," the Doctor pretends to be utterly shattered by how (his own) TARDIS's Bigger on the Inside nature defies all laws of physics. Mentioned here for _how much_ he hams it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ga6CwyKvr8

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Hunter: The Vigil_ has Null Mysteriis, an academic organization devoted to the scientific study of supernatural creatures and phenomena, believing that things like vampires, werewolves, and mages all have rational, scientific explanations. Problem is, they live in the _World of Darkness_. Depending on the GM, either they're correct, and science simply hasn't advanced to the point where study of the supernatural is possible, or they have it all wrong, and the supernatural completely defies all attempts at explanation. Understandably, this tends to drive more than a few Null M. scientists insane.

    Video Games 

-   One of the planet travel guides in _Tyrian_ reads "Many a scientist comes here after retirement to watch all their fundamental mathematical theorems fall apart as they watch the landmasses floating in apparent defiance to their life's work."

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   This is what happens in _Funny Business_ when a group of computer scientists learn of Jeanette's godlike powers. Tom is so shaken up by this that he goes on a lengthy rant about how useless his profession is if there exists a being who can ignore the laws of physics at will. It's not exactly "crying in the corner", but the effect is the same.
-   In _Welcome to Night Vale_, poor, _perfect_ Carlos seems to be a victim of this.
-   On This Very Wiki, the Artistic License – Paleontology page used to be called Somewhere A Paleontologist Is Crying.

    Western Animation 

-   _Looney Tunes:_ The cartoon _Rocket-bye Baby_ had a professor giving a lecture where he refuted the existence of UFO's and "Little green men". Just as he's laughing at the very idea, a flying saucer with a baby green Martian flies in and hovers before his face for a few moments, causing the laughter to turn into tears.
-   _The Simpsons_
    -   The curator for the Jebediah Springfield museum was so dismayed upon finding evidence that Jebediah was actually a vicious pirate that he stole and hid the evidence to stop others from knowing the truth.
    -   Lisa Simpson, when they went to Africa and saw a rhinoceros hatch from an egg.
        
        **Lisa**: Wait, rhinos aren't born from eggs!
        
        **Homer**: What did you just see, Lisa?
        
        **Lisa**: I know, but—
        
        **Homer**: _What did you just see?!_
        
    -   Homer again after Lisa (somehow) makes a perpetual motion machine. The scene ends with Homer calling Lisa to him and angrily shouting, "In this house, we obey the laws of thermodynamics!"
-   _Transformers: Prime_: In "Predacons Rising", the Grand Finale movie, when Unicron-possessing-Megatron reanimates Predacon bones as Terrorcons, Shockwave, Decepticons' Mad Scientist who always thinks with logic, got absolutely horrified due to how illogical their mere existence is.
    
    **Shockwave**: It defies logic...
    

    Real Life 

-   This actually has happened to a lesser extent with rival theories. One notable example was Fred Hoyle whose steady state theory was discredited once sufficient evidence was more accurately explained by the Big Bang theory. After it was proven, Fred Hoyle still wasn't in favor of it because he saw a universe with a finite beginning as bad due to the fact that it meant that the universe would also have a finite ending. (Admittedly, cosmologists have come to something resembling Hoyle's Steady State for other reasons.)
-   Ancient Greek philosopher/mathematician Pythagoras was allegedly so disturbed by the concept of irrational numbers (numbers which cannot be expressed as a fraction), that he ordered his students not to divulge their existence under threat of death. The discoverer of irrational numbers, possibly Hippasus, is said (possibly apocryphally) to have been sentenced to death by drowning.
