When a character accustomed to a high-octane, adventurous lifestyle undergoes a change where they live what the audience would consider mundane or boring, only to find that they enjoy this way of living.

There can often be a Freudian reason behind this; life-or-death situations can get old when you experience them all the time, and even then the rewards that come with them never really last. But lying on the couch, talking for hours about nothing with the people you love, and keeping your house together? That's _different._ The planet exploding might seem like a bigger threat scale-wise, but you can't beat the small — and more personal — victories of managing to fix your wife's car or your kids giving you a finger-painted card on your birthday or winning an argument on who shot first with your bar buddies.

However, The Call Knows Where You Live and it never lasts. This can end one of three ways:

-   **Option 1**: The story ends with the hero finding the source of the weirdness (usually the Big Bad), destroying it, and retiring for good (or at least until the sequel).
-   **Option 2**: The hero leaves this happy life behind and returns to their action-packed way of life so that their loved ones can enjoy the life they can't have. This is typically treated as a Bittersweet Ending, as while the protagonist doesn't get the simple life that they wanted and will only endure more danger, they are content in the fact that their loved ones will be safe, and they were badasses anyway, so odds are they can handle it just fine.
-   **Option 3**: The hero finds a happy medium between 1 and 2, flying off weekdays to new and exciting horizons while spending their weekends in boring suburbia.

Expect their mundane stability to form when they suffer from amnesia and becomes reluctant to return to their old selves when they regain their memories.

Sub-Trope of Mundane Made Awesome. Compare Call to Agriculture, Can't Stay Normal, I Just Want to Be Normal, Incredibly Lame Fun, Refusal of the Call and Slumming It. Contrast Nightmare of Normality, where an exceptional person experiencing normalcy is treated like an Ironic Hell. Taken to extremes leads to Obsessively Normal.

Steven shoots this down immediately.
    
    **Connie**: I don't know why you hang out with me! I'm so much more... less interesting than you! And obviously you have some sort of magical destiny. Why would you even care about something like Dogcopter?
