_"And if we had that goat, I could have a glass of milk whenever I wanted."_

In Real Life, female cattle are not able to be milked year round. Like most female mammals, they make milk only for their offspring and thus only lactate during pregnancy and directly after pregnancy, and even then, they only lactate during a warmer season. Cows need to constantly be pregnant (being impregnated about once a year)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and be in a warm temperature in order to make milk. Even then, cows will eventually stop giving milk with age, which leads to the cows either being retired or sent to the slaughter.

In fiction, however, cows can be milked even when they haven't had any calves. Cows can be milked even when the weather is unsuitable for lactating. Cows in fiction lactate no matter what. The only time they'll stop is when sick, old or starving. This is because cows are mainly known for producing milk. Add this to very young audiences often not yet knowing that milk doesn't come from _just_ cows, and you get an erroneous perception that they produce it all the time. In video games where cows and their milk are a resource, this spares the logistics involving animal husbandry and managing the calves. Sometimes, udders are a weapon for the cow, with the milk being Edible Ammunition.

This trope also applies to other animals used for milk, such as goats and buffalo.

Sub-trope of Artistic License – Biology. May overlap with Lactating Male if the cow is male. See also Cow Tipping for another trope about fictional cows being portrayed inaccurately, Perplexing Pearl Production for another animal product portrayed inaccurately, The Simple Life is Simple for other agricultural misconceptions, and Super Wool Growth for another trope about farm animals producing resources faster than they should. Has nothing to do with Milking the Giant Cow.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Zigzagged in the _Akazukin Chacha_ TV series. When the characters need to find milk for a giant baby, they observe that they need to find a cow that's recently had a calf. However, there's one all-too-conveniently available.
-   _Monster Musume_: Minotaurs lactate constantly, so they need to be milked. Of course, they have human-like breasts rather than udders, since it's an ecchi comic.
-   Applied to _humans_ in _Vinland Saga_, when Thorfinn and friends find a baby, they immediately hand it over to the girl in the group so she can feed it. Except, as she has to explain to the dumbfounded males, she's not pregnant or nursing and thus won't produce milk.

    Comic Strips 

-   _The Far Side_: One strip has a man and a cow on a liferaft, the cow trying to drink a glass of milk while fending off the man.
    
    You said you were empty, you stinking liar!
    

    Eastern European Animation

-   Seemingly played straight for most of _Green Acres_, but subverted in at least two episodes. In season 1's "Lisa Has a Calf", the Douglas' cow, Eleanor, has a calf, justifying the fact that she had been able to be milked thus far in the series. In season 4's "A Husband for Eleanor" she stops giving milk, and the plot revolves around finding a bull to breed her with.
-   _The Last Man on Earth_: The group is overjoyed in season one to discover that a cow managed to survive the virus as it means they get to have fresh milk. Whilst the cow does end up getting pregnant, they still milk it even when its not. Likewise after it dies, they just go to milking its calf.

    Video Games 

-   Cows in the _Farming Simulator_ series always produce milk, thanks to the fact that Eternal Equinox is also in play in vanilla. This is averted in the Seasons mods for these games by Realismus Modding, cows will only produce milk after they have given birth though they are artificially inseminated which requires no input from the player. This can be further averted with a mod for the GlobalCompany script extension in _19_ that only milks them every half-day.
-   In _Farmville_ you can milk cows, and you can breed them, but you don't need to breed them in order to be able to milk them.
-   In _Hay Day,_ cows always take exactly an hour to regenerate their milk after being fed, no pregnancy needed.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_, you can make any cow instantly produce a surplus of milk by playing Epona's Song on the ocarina while standing next to it. If you have an empty bottle, it'll let you fill the bottle with milk in gratitude for playing such a nice song.
-   In _Let's Build a Zoo_, fertile cows will produce milk as long as they're in a barn or battery.

-   In _My Time at Portia_, cows start producing milk once they reach adulthood. You don't even need to actually milk them: bottles of milk will just appear in their pen overnight as long as you keep them happy and fed.
-   Miltank from _Pokémon_ is a cow Pokemon whose signature move is Milk Drink. It's also the source of the Moomoo Milk item.

In any case, all Pokemon reproduce through eggs and young Pokemon eat solids as soon as they're hatched.
-   _RimWorld_ has several animals that regularly produce milk once they grow into adults. There's no need to keep males around unless you plan on breeding or eating them.

    -   In most titles, all adult cows can be milked year round. They only stop lactating when sick. As soon as a calf turns into an adult, she can be milked.
    -   Subverted in _Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life_, which strives to be more realistic than the rest of the series.
        -   Cows only give milk for two seasons before they need to be bred again. The quality and quantity of the milk also slow down just before they stop giving milk. This justifies the existence of bulls, whose entire purpose in the game is to impregnate cows. If you don't have bulls, you have to pay to borrow bulls from other farms. Also, if you buy cows, don't expect them to lactate for you immediately, because you have to breed them first. According to Takakura, the reason why the cow you start the game with can lactate for free is because she just recently gave birth.
        -   In the original game, the goat can also only be milked for a period, but she can't be bred _or_ sold. The only way to get rid of her was to let her die. _Another Wonderful Life_ and _A Wonderful Life: Special Edition_ fixed that by allowing her to be sold.
-   Marge from _Toonstruck_ is an anthropomorphic cow who laments her butter-making Churnatron being out of order due to a missing part. Once you find that part and it gets reattached, Marge will attach the machine's suction caps to her udders every few seconds to produce butter.

-   _The Loud House_: In the episode "Pasture Bedtime", one of the animals on Liam's farm is a goat. Despite being the only goat on his farm, and therefore not having any kids, she is still able to make milk. This comes in handy when Lincoln and his friends try to make Liam fall asleep with the milk.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   The "Treehouse of Horror" special "The Isle of Dr. Hibbert" has Ned Flanders turned into a half-man-half-cow creature (he has his own torso but a cow's body, similar to a centaur) and is in pain from needing to be milked, even though he hasn't recently had calves.
    -   _The Itchy & Scratchy Show_ episode "Butter Off Dead", Itchy shoves Scratchy into a cow's mouth, and after Scratchy is digested, Itchy is somehow able milk him out through the cow as butter.
