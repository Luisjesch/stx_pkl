**Shepard:** Conrad. If you have some kind of weird shrine of me, I'm going to be very unhappy.  
**Conrad:** It's just a poster with a few candles. It's very tasteful!  
**Shepard:** Gah...

What's a good way to show that a character is a bit more attached to someone than is really healthy? That this someone is a Yandere, a Stalker with a Crush, a Loony Fan, or just very, very creepily obsessed? Have a special private place in the character's residence that is dedicated to the object of the person's obsession. A shrine to them.

The contents of the shrine may vary, but they usually consist of photos of the stalker's obsession. _Lots_ of photos. More rarely, newspaper and magazine articles, timelines, address book information, or videos are added. If there's a statue or bust of the stalkee, it has probably been kissed. For extra creepiness factor, a couple of half-melted candles are strategically located at the base of the shrine. There might also be locks of hair, trash, or other mundane items stolen from the object of the stalker's obsession.

While encountering a stalker shrine is almost always a very creepy event, on rare occasions, it can be strangely touching as well if the stalker truly cares for the target of their obsession. The shrine is simply a substitute for their physical presence. A less creepy version replaces the shrine with a hidden stash of photos of the obsession taken in secret.

-   In _Front Mission 5_, there's a Running Gag of how cold hardass Lynn Wennwright has one such shrine of player character Walter Feng.
-   _Hollow Knight_: If you rescue Bretta, she idolizes the Knight and starts keeping a doll in its likeness in her house in Dirtmouth, complete with flowery prose in her diary gushing over her "White Savior". If you save Zote the Mighty and face him in the Colosseum of Fools, she becomes obsessed with Zote and his tall tales to the point of putting up a poster of him and building a shrine to him in the basement, which has enough "dream power" to unlock an optional boss fight against Grey Prince Zote, a much stronger idealized version of Zote.
-   _Hyrule Warriors_: Cia's dimensional lair is, in itself, one gigantic stalker shrine to Link. Everywhere you go, portraits of him can be found here and there. Her backyard? A rose garden with statues of _every single Link_. Including Wolf Link, Young "Hero of Time" Link and Right-Handed Link. Oh, and guess who _you_ get to come here as, and who you're here to find? Simply delightful.
-   It was known throughout _Luigi's Mansion 3_ that the hotel's owner Hellen Gravely is a Fangirl of King Boo. The Master Suite, where she lives, has King Boo statues plastered everywhere.
-   Played for laughs in _Mass Effect 3_ with Shepard's obsessive fanboy, Conrad Verner. When Shepard asks Conrad if he lost anyone when the Reapers hit Earth, Conrad answers no, eventually admitting that the "wife" he's mentioned before doesn't actually exist. In light of this, Shepard sees this trope coming a mile away, and sure enough, Conrad lives down to expectations. In his "defense", it's apparently very small and only has a few "tasteful" candles. Shepard is understandably still weirded out.
-   _Persona_:
    -   _Persona 3_ in the Female Protagonist Magician Social Link, has the Protagonist getting told by Junpei that someone took photos of her during gym class. Junpei briefly wonders why someone would do this but then gets quiet and tells the protagonist to enjoy the ramen. (They later find the culprit and Junpei fights with him offscreen)
    -   The first area in the TV world of _Persona 4_ (The one with the noose) has photos of councilman Namatame's wife with her head cut out plastered all over the walls.

The fight takes place in a room filled with pictures of Pikachu, with the strong implication that Mimikyu put them up itself.
-   _Portal_, in the Room Full of Crazy, has a photo shrine for the Companion cube.
-   Inbeda of the House-In-Exile has one of these in _The Secret World_. More specifically, he's turned most of the bathhouse into a weird sex-shrine to Illuminati handler Kirsten Geary. One room alone is dominated by a massive painting of her in a pose that the real woman probably wouldn't be caught dead in; the pool is surrounded by mannequins, quite a few of which appear to be deliberately modeled on Geary as well... and there appears to be a blow-up doll floating in the water. Also, Inbeda is in the habit of having sex with the mannequins. Geary has seen this particular shrine, and the fact that she recommends having Inbeda bumped off as soon as he's no longer useful is purely coincidental.
-   To absolutely no one's surprise, Yandere-chan from _Yandere Simulator_ has one for Senpai, complete with things she's personally stolen from him without his knowledge.

    Web Comics 

-   In _Gunnerkrigg Court_, Chapter 18, "S1", Antimony and her True Companions stumble upon a room full of robots, and an adjoining chamber with a large portrait of Jeanne and a much smaller portrait of someone named Diego. They conclude that Diego must have put the whole thing together to honor Jeanne's memory; they disagree on what the relationship between Diego and Jeanne must have been, and consequently whether the construction of the shrine was something sweet or creepy. The story itself later reveals that Diego was in part responsible for Jeanne's death and did his part out of jealousy, only to afterwards deny any association with the crime even from himself, only blaming others for what happened pushing it firmly into the creepy camp.

    Web Videos 

-   _Empires SMP_ Season 2: fWhip has proclaimed himself to be deeply devoted to Sheriff Jimmy and the Law he enforces. Reflecting this, he has a shrine to the Law filled with candles and toys made in the Sheriff's likeliness located deep in Gobland.

-   _Hey Arnold!_:
    -   The intensity of Helga's love for Arnold was quickly established by showing that she kept a shrine of Arnold in the back of her closet that was shaped like his head and made out of his used chewing gum. Later shrines shown included one made out of an actual football and garbage, and another that was some sort of hat / mask thing that she put on and danced around in. About the only thing preventing this from being incredibly creepy is the fact that she's nine years old and it's Played for Laughs.
    -   Ernie, one of the boarding house attendants, has a shrine to Lola, a tall fashion model who he has a crush on.
-   Heloise of _Jimmy Two-Shoes_ has a very Helga-esque shrine of Jimmy hidden behind her living room.

-   Krazy Kat has one of Ignatz in the 1963 cartoon.
-   Played with in _Milo Murphy's Law_; although this is Zack's first thought when he discovers that Melissa has a room full of pictures of Milo, it's very much Not What It Looks Like. Unless it looks like an attempt to discover the inner workings of Milo's condition, in which case it's exactly what it looks like. Either way, it's fair to be a little unsettled by the fact that she managed to procure his old toothbrushes.

-   _Total Drama_: This is actually averted or downplayed with Sierra, who otherwise displays every other Loony Fan and Stalker with a Crush hallmark but is never even implied to have a shrine to Cody, the unwilling object of her affections — unless one counts the numerous fan blogs she made for him. It's played straight with Sierra's mother, who is just as obsessed with Chris as Sierra is with Cody and showed this devotion by converting an entire room of her house into a mini-Chris museum.
