_Most like a spider she was, but huger than the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. Great horns she had, and behind her short stalk-like neck was her huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and sagging beneath her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid marks, but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a stench. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her back, and hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg's end there was a claw._

Arachnophobia is probably the second-most popular phobia (after coulrophobia), and even non-arachnophobes have to admit that spiders can be pretty freaky. Therefore, the most popular form of Big Creepy-Crawlies and one of the most popular 50-Foot Whatevers to attack has to be (don't click the link if you like to browse TV Tropes before bed) a big spider. The bigger they are, the less likely there are to be more of them, but they're almost all so big that they realistically shouldn't be able to move or breathe (according to natural laws of our universe's Earth, given our atmosphere's oxygen concentration). They will usually have hypertoxic venom, both spin webs and hunt for prey, and spit Projectile Webbing out of their mouths (most spiders in real life only focus on one trait). For extra terror, they may even attack in groups (again, most spiders in real life are solitary).

Needless to say, they can be a bit of a problem for viewers that really are arachnophobic, especially in video games with them as a featured enemy. Many games get around this by making the spiders relatively cartoonish, or not having them correspond to any real-life spiders. Granted, they can still be freaky due to the sheer nature of being giant spiders.

They usually have little personality, beyond vague malevolence. Some of them can talk, but they're rarely very chatty, and only very rarely will they overlap with Friendly Neighborhood Spider. They can turn up in a variety of situations, but their most common habitats are the Hungry Jungle and vast caverns Beneath the Earth. In fantasy works, they are also likely to turn up in dark, trackless and haunted forests, especially if the work is closely patterned after Tolkien. Sometimes, they're just ordinary spiders who meet up with a protagonist who is small, although it amounts to the same thing.

Not to be confused with Demonic Spiders, who are just difficult enemies, or Money Spiders, which are just enemies that drop money even though they logically shouldn't — although either of these _can_ be literal spiders.

In the final battle, Naraku's outer shell is a gargantuan black spider who acts as a final dungeon.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind_ uses the "shrunken hero" vs. regular-sized spider variant, as Formaggio traps Narancia (who has been affected by Formaggio's Little Feet stand) in a bottle and pits him against a normal tarantula.
-   _Majin Devil_: The third chapter is rife with them. Demonic dog-sized spiders with embryos on their backs that crawl out of pregnant girls' hoohahs, tear their way out of their stomachs or rip themselves out of hosts' heads.

Benares states that this monster can subdue even an immortal Wu like Yakumo.
-   _So I'm a Spider, So What?_: The main character is this, as well as her "family" after she's reincarnated.

-   _Spider Riders_, as its name suggests, features giant spiders as the characters' mounts.
-   _Spirited Away_: Kamaji the boiler man is a youkai who seems to be a cross between an old man and a large spider. (Or perhaps an opilione, also known as harvestmen or daddy longlegs.) He's not quite as scary as the other examples on this page, and is actually a rather decent fellow.

-   _Phill Jupitus: Quadrophobia_: Phill claims to have encountered two "Category 3" spiders:
    
    The first time, I was nine and it was in my mum's house. Actually, it was in the bathroom. Actually, come to think of it, it was in the bath. Now, when I say "in the bath", it was actually _having_ a bath. Six legs up the tap end, reading the _Daily Mirror_. "Fucking hell, Bobby Moore's gone to Fulham, what's that about? You alright, son, you don't look well."
    
    \[...\]
    
    _\[After a description of moving a cabinet out of the cellar more recently\]_ ...And there, in the corner of the cellar, was a _bigger_ Category 3 than the one I saw when I was nine. This one reading Joseph Heller's _Catch-22_. This spider, who was wearing a _beret_, looks up at me and goes "He died last year, you know. A tragic loss to the world of literature, don't you agree? I always thought he had another novel in him, what say you?"
    

    Comic Books 

-   _All Eight Eyes_ is set in a world where giant spiders exist and prey on humans, but only a single vagrant is shown doing anything about them because people at large rationalize away any evidence.

-   _Paperinik New Adventures_: The Last Haga is a giant _space_ spider. She is enormous (and can grow even bigger), is stated to be able to devour whole _planets_ given enough time, reproduces extremely quickly and asexually (her offspring also qualify for this trope), and she is totally undetectable by radar or any other type of sensor. A small gang of space pirates worship the Haga as a deity, referring to her as "Ironheart", "Mother" and "Devourer". Furthermore, their wording imply that the giant Haga we see in action (which later merges with their spaceship upon returning) is the _larval form_ of the Haga, implying that it could transform further.
-   _Samurai Squirrel_: Nato-san takes on several spiders bigger than him in their own lair to rescue the baby bird that their leader, known as Silverback, kidnapped to eat.

    -   And there was a villain who was obsessed with killing Spider-Man and for some reason would only use giant spider robots called "Spider Slayers" for the job. One version of the Spider Slayer was a scorpion though, which makes a bit more sense, given that scorpions do commonly prey upon spiders. This was the original reasoning in giving Mac Gargan the power and abilities of a scorpion to serve as Spider-Man's Evil Counterpart.
    -   To say nothing of Spider-Man transforming into the Half-Human Hybrid Man-Spider on occasion.
    -   The storyline _Spider-Island_ is literally crawling with them.

He eventually turns into a giant spider and is completely under Queen's control, and she plans to use him as an egg sac to give birth to her offspring. It was a small miracle that Peter managed to survive the process. His giant spider form died unexpectedly and he got his original body back.

After winning the Race Against the Clock to plant his team's flag first on said meteor, Tintin opens his cantine and a minuscule spider escapes from it. Fast-forward a minute or so later, the spider has grown giant due to the meteor's strange properties, and starts attacking Tintin, only to be crushed under a giant apple from a giant apple tree that grew from an apple Tintin had a bite in and threw away.

    Fan Works 

-   _Besides the Will of Evil_: Ungoliants are enormous spider-like monsters created by Reiziger as muscle for his armies. They create an aura of shadow around themselves, and unlike real spiders, they have a poisonous stinger hidden beneath their bellies.
-   _Child of the Storm_ mentions the Acromantulae of the Forbidden Forest and Uhtred immediately perks up. Harry immediately tells him that no, he can't go hunt them because it would upset Hagrid. While this may seem odd, Uhtred is a teenage Asgardian well on course to be bigger than Thor and as strong as Volstagg and is, moreover, the protégé of Sif herself. In short, Harry is very right to worry for the spiders.
-   _Children of an Elder God_: The first enemy Shinji fights is a skyscraper-sized spider-shaped Eldritch Abomination spread its webs all over the city and spawned millions of smaller spiders danced around its legs and flooded the city's streets.
    
    _It showed a creature that resembled a huge spider, hundreds of feet tall, lying on its side, its legs working the air feebly. It was surrounded by a charred cocoon of spider silk and the corpses of countless spiders. However, more were erupting up from the ground and forming from its blood, which was puddled around it. Furthermore, the charred marks on its exterior were fading, and ichor was no longer leaking from it._
    
-   _Codex Equus_:
    -   Cuddle Spiders, based on _Lucas the Spider_, are the size of a medium-sized dog. They're also adorable, friendly, and make great pets sustained by their owner's affection and love. They're the domesticated version of a now long-extinct species of love-sucking, wolf-sized spiders that were far less friendly.
    -   More traditional ones live in the Giant Lands, where proportionally to giants they're the same size as normal ones are to ponies. When the get out of the Giant Lands, however, they're a much bigger problem.
-   _Divided Rainbow_: Lero runs into a giant ("as tall as a rhinoceros, and equally as wide") seven-legged spider (the eighth leg is just an infected-looking stump) in chapter 3, and names it Mr. 7. He very nearly gets killed by it until Rarity shows up to help.
-   _Doctor Whooves – The Series_: _Along Came a Spider_ has pony-hoof-sized ones as well as ANASI, THE SPIDER GODDESS (straight from Metebelis III.
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_:
    -   There are monsterous giant spiders, mainly used by Keeper Arachne, as seen in "Captured!":
        
        With a strange wrenching noise, a quartet of giant spiders dropped out of thin air, each one landing in a separate corner of the room. Even the smallest of the ugly, hairy monsters was as big as a sheep at least, not even counting the long legs covered in sharp bristles.

-   _The Nightmare House_: The spiders in Leni's nightmare are enlarged with "Super Spider Growy Stuff".
-   _Personality Conflicts_: One appears in _The Green-Eyed Monster_, in the Castle of Nyghtmayr. The castle defenses replicate the same emotion-evoking powers as the eight Minor Demons, and Fyar's powers summon up a giant spider for Tasha to confront. She's able to defeat it by listing three biological reasons why the creature before her can't actually exist (any permeable-membraned egg that size would dry out before it could hatch; Square-Cube Law means "the cross-section of the legs only increase on a square curve" and would soon be too small to support it; and spiders and insects both "breathe through tracheal tubes that run from their 'skin' to their bloodstream. Those tubes can’t be longer than an inch or so, otherwise no air gets down them, and the spider suffocates"). Each example causes the spider to shrink until it's the size of a normal tarantula, allowing Tasha to step on it and crush it into nothing.
-   _Pony POV Series_: There's the Polyphemus Gargantula, more commonly known as Giant Cyclops Spider. Aahg from G1 is a member of this species, however the first and most deadly of the entire species was Lahb, a creation of Hydia's ancestor, the First Witch Lilith. Lahb was a forty-foot tall titan with legs as wide as tree trunks and fangs big enough to impale a centaur.
-   _Prehistoric Park Reimagined_: The newly discovered In-Universe _Megalorachne_ prove to be reasonably massive spiders for the time period in which they naturally live in before their kind get rescued to be put on display at the titular park, with at least one of the females being explicitly confirmed to be at least the same size as one human character's head. Rather appropriately, they are explicitly based on the 'mesothelae' from _Walking with Monsters_.
-   In _Rise of the Minisukas_, Matarael is a man-sized, multi-eyed spider-like abomination.
-   _The Secret Return of Alex Mack_ includes a crossover with _Tarantula!_, but unlike the original, after killing the 200-foot spider, a horde of car-sized babies appears; the SRI team has to invade their cave and deal with them. Alex gets nightmares afterwards for weeks.

-   _The World of the Creatures_: Batman and the Eleventh Doctor are captured by a colony of giant spiders that talk. It's implied that these are either from _Harry Potter_ or _The Hobbit_.
-   _Witch Quest_: Rochelle is a sane Witch whose normal form is of this. She even introduces herself this way to others at first ("Hwee ahr a giahnt spidahr"). She subverts the usual portrayal of this trope insofar as she's actually trying to help Magical Girls get happy endings, although mistrust, misunderstandings, and Napalm stand in the way (among others).
-   _The World is Filled with Monsters_: The first monsters encountered in the story are a colony of enormous and very aggressive spiders, ranging from the size of a cat to the size of a house to the biggest of them all, Blightweaver, which is more than two stories tall and has legs as thick as tree trunks. The first sign the company gets of them is enormous webs stretching across most of a forest's canopy, with whole flocks of geese webbed up like flies.

    Films — Animation

-   _Coraline_: The Other Mother's true form is a sort of spider zombie doll thing with hands and legs made out of needles.
-   _Hellboy: Sword of Storms_ has a woman sitting in a forest clearing covered in fallen leaves playing a stringed instrument who looks perfectly normal...until her fingers start bleeding as she plays, spiders start to swarm around, Hellboy gets caught by three spiders the size of dogs, and the woman rises up out of the leaves to reveal an enormous spider abdomen and set of legs — then she starts to breathe fire.
-   _The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part_: A real-life spider crawls over Emmet while he's stuck Undar of the Dryar. Of course it's tiny, but compared to a LEGO minifig it's huge, and freaks him out a bit.

-   _Oggy and the Cockroaches: The Movie_: One tries to make a meal out of Oggy Magnon, only to get knocked out by the cat's smelly feet without him even noticing.
-   _The Secret of NIMH_ had a fairly large spider that looked enormous to the mouse protagonist. It mostly existed to serve as a very memorable way to establish the barely-controlled danger of the Great Owl; if Mrs. Brisby is threatened by a spider and the spider is nothing but a snack for the Owl... well, let's just say she's lucky to survive that scene.
-   Superman fights a giant mechanical spider at the beginning of _Superman: Doomsday_, while Kevin Smith, in an animated cameo, looks on and says "Lame!". It's a Take That! against the Executive Meddling forced upon Smith's _Superman Lives_ script — see below.
-   Scroop, the main villain of _Treasure Planet_ resembles an evil, giant alien spider/scorpion hybrid.

    Gamebooks 

-   A really popular choice of enemy in the _Fighting Fantasy_ series, starting from _The Warlock of Firetop Mountain_. Notable examples include the "Mizugumo Fens" in _Sword of the Samurai_, where your hero can encounter and fight several giant spiders living in the marsh, _Midnight Rogue_ (a gigantic spider shows up in the final dungeon as a rather difficult fight), and _Howl of the Werewolf_, where you can venture in a cavern infested by all manners of monstrous arachnids, including a literal spider-wolf horror and their queen, the vaguely humanoid Arachne.
-   Subverted in _Space Assassin_, where aboard one of Cyrus' lab, you can uncover a giant spider who can talk, and communicate with you. Turns out this spider used to be a sentient life-form from another planet, one of the many victims abducted by Cyrus, an Evilutionary Biologist, and if you release him the spider will give you an important clue before leaving.
-   In the _GrailQuest_ series, the hero's Talking Sword Excalibur Junior is arachnophobic. This is problematic when fighting giant spiders, as the sword is either shaking in fear or plain refusing to be pulled from its scabbard.
-   In the French gamebook series _La Saga du Prêtre Jean_, Giant Spiders are often encountered by the titular hero at least once per book, and sometimes will have fatal venom. The sole exceptions are Book 5, set in ancient India, and the last fanmade book set in Tibet.

    Live-Action TV

-   The _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ episode "Selfless" starts out with one of these.
-   The Monster of the Week in the _Charmed (1998)_ episode "Spin City".
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Planet of the Spiders" has the titular Giant Spiders of Metebelis 3 (which evolved from normal spiders).
    -   "The Runaway Bride": The Racnoss, as a species, cross this trope with Horde of Alien Locusts, although the Empress is partially humanoid in appearance.
    -   "Kill the Moon": The Doctor and co. stumble upon giant _germs_ shaped like spiders living on the Moon.
    -   "Arachnids in the UK": There's a mother spider the size of, in Graham's words, a _van_. It's actually a test subject from a university laboratory that grew that size after it was improperly disposed of by a waste company owned by a Corrupt Corporate Executive, which grew so large due to eating garbage in the landfill it was dumped in. And, unlike some other giant spiders on this show, it _is_ affected by the Square-Cube Law, as when the Doctor finally confronts it, she realizes it's dying of suffocation as it's grown too big to breathe.
-   In the _Gilligan's Island_ episode "The Pigeon", the castaways run into a Black Morning Spider. It's six feet long, has red eyes, and weighs 500 lbs.
-   Some seasons of _Kamen Rider_ feature a spider monster in the first episode, and more recent seasons like _Kamen Rider Blade_ and _Kamen Rider Kiva_ have a recurring spider monster. Admittedly these are just People in Rubber Suits with spider heads and maybe legs sticking out the back. However, _Kamen Rider Ryuki_ and _Kamen Rider Hibiki_ went all the way, with proper giant spiders by way of CGI. _Kamen Rider ZO_ had one that was made with Claymation, featuring a creepy face and unnatural movements that make it _so much_ more scary than the better-animated versions.
-   The UK kids' game show _Knightmare_ had Ariadne, a very slow, very large spider who could block the path and eat the dungeoneer.
-   In the _Merlin_ episode "The Poisoned Chalice" Arthur is trapped in a cave with a bunch of giant spiders. They aren't as big as some of the beasties on this page, but they are bigger than his head — not counting the legs. Oh, and there's hundreds of them.

-   _Power Rangers_ and _Super Sentai_:
    -   _Power Rangers Mystic Force_ also has a CGI giant spider in one episode, complete with giant web. It wasn't even the Monster of the Week, just a denizen of a dangerous forest.
    -   Spidertron (Dora Tarantula in _Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger_) from _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_, on the other hand, _was_ a monster of the week. Rita, being a Witch with a Capital "B", created it upon discovering Zack had a fear of spiders. Zack bored its guts out with the Dragonzord Fighting Mode's Power Staff.
    -   Arachnofiend from Season 3 of _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_, who was Tsuchigumo in _Ninja Sentai Kakuranger_. Another Tsuchigumo appeared in _Shuriken Sentai Ninninger_, renamed Tangleweb for _Power Rangers Ninja Steel_.
    -   Gozunagumo from _Samurai Sentai Shinkenger_ is based on the Ushi-Oni mentioned below. He was renamed Arachnitor for _Power Rangers Samurai_.
-   _Primeval_ had giant prehistoric spiders in its second episode. It's pointed out that, technically, they're not really spiders, but spider ancestors. They are not, however, the most threatening monster in the episode. A giant millipede is.
-   An episode of _The Really Wild Show_ had a spoof monster movie, in which the show's pet tarantula grew to the size of a building. This being an Edutainment Show, of course, it was followed by an explanation of why you couldn't really get spiders that big.
-   When Phill Jupitus nominated "people who _aren't_ scared of spiders" to go into _Room 101_, the illustrative prop was a fake spider a foot in diameter which, rather than Paul producing it from behind the desk, was lowered from the ceiling while they were talking. Jupitus, who is _severely_ arachnophobic, had a genuine moment of panic, before realising, and commenting "It's a big comedy one and all, what kind of twat am I? Big, googly-eyed, cartoon spider, I run a mile."
-   Within the _Sanctuary_ story, Big Bertha is an earth-moving, psychically powered, possible divine version of this. Yeah, it's pretty damn cool.
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_: Implied at the end of "Super Twins" (the superhero story part of Disney Channel's "Wish Gone Amiss" weekend) after the two defeat the Meanager (Mr. Moseby's supervillain persona):
    
    **Carey:** Aw, guys, I'm sorry, but the phone's been ringing all night. Apparently a lot of people need your help. _(whips out the list)_ Let's see, there's a bus on a broken suspension bridge, and... Ooh, I think I'd start with the giant spider that's climbing city hall.  
    _(a crowd is heard screaming outside, and the twins and Carey peek out the window)_  
    **Carey:** Oh, he just ate the mayor!  
    _(monster burping)_
    
-   _The Twilight Zone (1985)_: In "The Elevator", a spider ate the super food developed by Roger and Will's father in order to solve world hunger. It then killed the smaller but still giant cat and dog and possibly the giant rats. When Roger and Will call the elevator in their father's factory, the giant spider grabs them with its pedipalps and kills them.
-   Ultra Series examples:
    -   _Ultra Q_ has a giant tarantula inhabiting an abandoned mansion, who is simply named... Giant Tarantula.
    -   An episode of _Ultraseven_ has the TDF getting stranded in a monster infested swamp, with Soga being pursued by an oversized arachnid creature called a Gumonga. The creature's name is a direct reference to the Godzilla foe, Kumonga.
    -   The _Ultraman Nexus_ kaiju Banpira is a giant bipedal spider with four arms. Like all the Space Beasts, Banpira likes To Serve Man, but it is also able to cloak its presence by creating Ominous Fog. From there, it incapacitates prey with a sonic shriek before snatching targets with webbing from its mouth and then erasing survivors' memories with a flash of light from its eyes. Sweet dreams...
-   Giant melon-sized spiders called "_Mesothelae_" appeared in the Carboniferous segment of _Walking with Monsters_. They were larger than any genuine spiders of that (or any) time, and were only depicted as being so huge because a proto-scorpion had been mistaken for a spider; otherwise, this would be listed under Real Life.
-   Episode 12 of the UK version of _Who Wants to Be a Superhero?_ featured one terrorising various London landmarks and the superheroes' task was to mix a formula to shrink it.
-   In _The Wild Wild West_ episode "The Night of the Raven", James West and a Native American princess are menaced by a spider while shrunk. That's right, the series did a Giant Spider scene (more or less) 33 years before The Movie (cited elsewhere).

    Music 

-   Frank Zappa was a huge fan of B-movies, especially monster movies, and thus giant spiders appear a lot in his work, including "Cheepnis" on _Roxy & Elsewhere_ and "Spider Of Destiny" on _Sleep Dirt_.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   The Tsuchigumo and Jorogumo youkai of Japanese mythology, both of which are also known for shapeshifting and illusions, along with deadly poisons and large webs which they used to catch their prey. Archetypal myths for both involve posing as a beautiful girl or young boy to attract and snare unwary travellers, or accosting and offering wishes or marriage to someone who is kind to spiders. The latter is actually fairly common, since jorogumo's natural form is considered lucky for its bright coloring.
    -   The Ushi-Oni is sometimes described as a giant spider with crab-like claws and a bull's head.
-   Natives of the Congo jungles and cryptozoologists tell tales of a species of monkey-sized trapdoor spiders known as J'ba Fofi ("Giant Spider" in Bakongo).
-   In Greek Mythology we have Arachne, a weaver of extraordinary talent who once challenged Athena with her work. Ironically, Arachne was turned into a spider by the angry goddess for her arrogance; some other versions instead have it that Arachne saw that she couldn't compare to Athena and hanged herself (or was about to) and Athena turned her into a spider so that she could keep weaving, out of pity rather than as a punishment. A lot of art depicts Arachne as either human with spider features or a giant spider altogether.
-   Anansi, the West African Trickster God (later a part of Caribbean folklore due to the Slave Trade), was depicted either as a spider (his name means "spider"), a man, or a man-sized spider.
-   Areop-Enap, the Creator God of Nauruan mythology, is a gigantic spider.

    Pinball 

-   _Krull_ has the Crystal Spider, who dwells on the upper playfield to trap players.

    Podcasts 

-   Holland, the "large brown spider"-turned-Dash Two monster from episode 5 of _Find Us Alive_. He's described as being about the size of a large dog.
-   In _Jemjammer_, the first monsters the group encounter is a trio of giant spiders. This is just a taste of the neogi, giant _alien_ spiders that can control minds and breed by having their young burst from their corpses. The party has to fight them after they attack Alana's ship. The fact that Jylliana (and to a lesser degree her player Annie) are arachnophobic doesn't help.
-   In _Trials & Trebuchets_, the party battle a Retriever, a giant mechanical spider, during the Autumn's End duels.

    Radio 

-   In Fit the Eleventh of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1978)_, Zaphod and Ford enter a hanger full of Techno Wreckage and huge cobwebs. A huge spider briefly lands next to them and says "'scuse me" in a "Boris the Spider" voice before scuttling off.
-   In the _Lights Out Everybody_ episode "The Spider," two small-time down-on-their-luck thugs scour the Amazon basin for exotic butterflies, looking to make enough money to get back to the States. Instead, they spot a dog-sized spider, which appears to be their ticket out. But there's a problem...

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Spiders are sacred to the drow's goddess Lolth, so not only do the drow have a spider motif by association, they've bred several varieties of giant spider to use as mounts or attack animals. Drow who have failed their goddess in some way or another are sometimes transformed into driders or masses of spider legs called chwidenchas, while Lolth's realm in the Abyss, the Demonweb Pits, is home to absolutely enormous spiders called Demonweb Terrors.
    -   Other races of the Underdark, such as the duergar dwarves or the ettercaps — themselves spider-headed, web-weaving humanoids — similarly use giant spiders as mounts.
    -   Giant spiders in the Classic _D&D_ game (Basic, Expert, etc.) were a bit more varied than in other versions of _D&D_, and often had interesting abilities based on Truth in Television, such as crab spiders blending into their surroundings, or folklore, like the "tarantella"'s poison causing a spastic "dance."

They're also fully sapient and capable of speech and known for having morbid conversations with their food while it "ripens" on their spines.
    -   Phase spiders are two-eyed, man-sized spiders capable of shifting between the Material and Ethereal Planes, hence the name. They observe and stalk prey from the Ethereal Plane undetected, then shift to the Material to attack seemingly from nowhere, and either hit-and-run or drag their food back with them to the Ethereal to feed.
    -   Retrievers are giant robot demon spiders that can shoot lasers from their eyes. Demon lords use them to hunt down those who displease or offend them.
    -   Tomb spiders are horse-sized arachnids suffused with negative energy and have a disturbing life cycle. They specifically lay their eggs in humanoid corpses, then wrap the body in silk to create a "web mummy," which is then animated by negative energy and serves its creator as a guardian. Once the eggs inside the undead husk hatch, the newborn tomb spiders feed on the corpse, then each other, until one emerges as a fully-grown adult in a few weeks. If the web mummy is destroyed before then, it releases a Spider Swarm of tiny tomb spiders. Oh, and tomb spider venom causes victims to be hurt by _cure wounds_ spells and healed by _inflict wounds_ spells, as if they were an undead creature.

-   _Exalted_ includes these among the variety of creatures in Creation. Some are mundane animals that just happen to be huge; others are smaller but intelligent, malicious elementals called Wood Spiders. Then there are the pattern spiders, the mechanical gods that maintain the Loom of Fate. And then there are anhules, a category of demon. No, not race, _category._ As in, "there's at least one subspecies of them descended from each Yozi because Yozi are jerks like that."

-   _The World of Darkness_:
    -   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ includes a race of blood-sucking werespiders called Ananasi. One of their forms is indeed a spider one-and-a-half times their human weight, and about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Their other forms are human (with a few spider internal organs), spider-human hybrid monster, and an entire swarm of normal-sized spiders linked by a hive-mind. In that form, they can survive the death of any number of spiders, as long as one is left — though losing a lot will change their appearance and personality. Regular Ananasi are sinister and emotionless, but the Kumo of East Asia are sadistic, insane, and evil.
    -   _Werewolf: The Forsaken_ features giant spiders known as Azlu, which are bizarre spirit hybrids. They start off small and looking mostly like natural spiders, and feed themselves on regular spiders and other Azlu. When they get big enough they start targeting humans and either eat their brains and ride around in their heads, or (when bigger) suck the body empty and wear the skin. When they get big enough, they often resemble a hideous combination of human and spider parts and will be covered in poisonous spines and fangs. They eat humans, spirits, and the occasional werewolf. When they get big enough, they stop being able to pass as human, but often gain the ability to lay eggs, either eating the young or letting them grow into a family to bring it more prey. On top of all that if they are killed they split into dozens of their original form, which all have to be killed to prevent them from growing into new Azlu.

    Theme Parks 

-   The _Dungeon of Terror_ haunted house from Universal Studios' _Halloween Horror Nights_ had a six-foot spider dangling down at the guests.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_: The Visorak horde, made up of car-sized spiders. There are also the elite Visorak, the humongous Kahgarak spiders, several stories high. Also, a variety of giant spider-like Rahi qualify as well, like the Chute Lurker, the Sea Spider, and Vezon's steed Fenrakk.
-   _BIONICLE (2015)_ had the Skull Spiders. They are about the size of a Toa's head, but their leader, the Lord of the Skull Spiders, is the size of a small house (though his toy is about the size of a Toa figure and is definitely way shorter). Some of the Skull Spiders have scorpion-like tails and like the Visorak, they are four-legged. The Lord has six legs.

    Webcomics 

-   _Abe & Kroenen_: Rasputin tries to capture a giant spider for his own use. It's later found out that its name is Starbuck and belongs to Davy Jones.
-   _A Beginner's Guide to the End of the Universe_: While exploring the caves on the Dark Star, the Everyman is ambushed by a giant wolf spider as large as he is.
-   _Daddy-Long-Legs_: Mr. Scapegrace stands more than twice as tall as a human. However, while he is a cellar spider, he _stands_ that tall because he is a Beast Man and standing on his fourth pair of legs, having hands on the others.
-   _El Goonish Shive_: Elliot initially mistakes the Bloodgrem for one of these after seeing its many spider-like eyes.
-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   The Geisterdamen ride ghost spiders, pale spiders several meters tall and with very long, slender legs. This is actually one of the _least_ creepy things about the Geisterdamen.
    -   There's a different one in Castle Heterodyne, which while not being much bigger than a real-life tarantula is still able to completely envelop an adult human in webs in a few seconds.
-   _Homestuck_: Trolls are raised by alien monsters called lusii naturae; Vriska's is a spider the size of a house. She is also responsible for _feeding it._ It's outright stated that she Eats Babies.
-   _Nature of Nature's Art_: Since it's about spiders, _Lycos\]_ usually averts this trope; pretty much all of the spiders who appear are their actual sizes. Then the trope gets inverted with _Patu digua_ (one of the world's smallest spiders), and then played straight with... none other than _Theraphosa blondi_ (the above-mentioned Goliath Birdeater Tarantula), who _dwarfs_ the titular spider. Three guesses why this page scared the crap out of some readers.
-   _Squid Row_: What your imagination will do to you.
-   _Tales of the Questor_: Quentyn reveals that his marvelous silken cloak is woven from the silk of biomancy enhanced spiders the size of tomatoes. (canonically, they are literally too large to walk on their own, and have to be hand-fed by their handlers.) Sam is not enthused.
-   _Wasted Talent_ plays with this.
-   _xkcd_: In strip #1530 "Keyboard Mash", a giant spider ties up a human, and then tries to impersonate that human online.

    Web Original 

-   The osteopods in _Alien Biospheres_ are genetically distinct from true spiders due to evolving on a different planet, but their eight legs, six eyes, mandibles, pedipalps, and cephalothorax cause them to look the part.
-   "Giant Spider Invasion". A guy finds a pretty big spider in his backyard, so he sprays insecticide all over his house and on the spider... only it turns out he picked up insecti_steroids_ instead. Then the all-grown-up spider invades his house and kills him.
-   This particularly famous Jerma985 clip. Complete with beatboxing!
-   In the _Kriegs Maiden_ novel universe, there's a series of spider-type Kriegsmaiden. The most infamous is the Widow, which doesn't look humanoid at all, and can have a leg span longer than the average car!
-   Downplayed but still present with the titular character of _Lucas the Spider_. He is far larger than any real species of jumping spider, which tend to be a few millimeters in size, where as Lucas seems to be around 3 inches long.
-   Oddly toyed with in _Mortasheen_. You'd think the human-insect hybrid Arthropoid class of creatures would have one, but in actuality, the spider-based creatures they have there aren't all that big and tend to look more like humans with weirdly spidery proportions (the biggest one looks more ape-like than anything else). There is a monster that fits this trope, though oddly enough it's actually a weird cow thing designed to produce meat.
-   In _Mother of Learning_, the aranea are a somewhat downplayed example — Zorian's narration describes them as being the size of his chest. They're still pretty scary, though, not in the least because they are a species of mind-mages.
-   One of the various terrors beset on Noah Maxwell at the Victor Park Boardwalk is this, as well as one of the various forms of the Administrator.
-   _SCP Foundation_:
-   This appears to be the true form of the creepy Victorian throwback villain Spider in _World Domination in Retrospect_, as revealed when the fight goes against him.
-   Invoked in this video, in which a German Shepherd is dressed in a spider costume to prank unwary passersby.
-   From what little we can see of them, the Woodcrawlers from _Gemini Home Entertainment_ appear to be shaped similarly to spiders. They have four front legs that seem to be arachnid in shape, and they're large enough to fill up most of a doorway.

    Real Life 

-   Mostly averted in Real Life: spiders as a whole are tiny creatures, with most of them being smaller than your fingernail.
-   The biggest spider known is the South American goliath birdeater tarantula, growing to roughly 9-10" (22-25 cm) in size, this creature's relatively harmless (to humans) venom is made up for by its increased aggression compared to most tarantulae and tendency to fling clouds of irritating spines into the eyes of larger enemies. While they usually only eat the externally digested liquid remains of insects, reptiles, and amphibians they paralyze with their venom, they do occasionally manage to catch a bird (and no, they do not build giant webs to catch them with). To quote Cracked "It's frequently described as 'larger than a dinner plate,' presumably because spider-scientists don't want to freak people out with the significantly more relevant 'big enough to fit over your face.'"
-   Australia is infamous for its thick concentration of huntsman spiders, which can grow to be the size of one's face. According to native Aussies, the first time you see one you scream and run away, the second you try to get rid of it, the third you just ignore it. They are venomous, but their bite is effectively harmless to any healthy human, and they keep other bugs out of the house. (The spiders, not the Australians.)
-   Everybody meet the new kid in town! The _Heteropoda maxima_, also called the Giant Huntsman Spider is another 30 cm (12 inch) beast from Laos. It isn't as bulky as Goliath, but it definitely holds as much Nightmare Fuel for those scared of lanky, skinny spiders. It is also, as the name implies, the largest species of all Huntsman spiders.
-   La Princesse, the fifty-foot spider marionette. She appeared on the side of a tower, was taken to a dock, and started roaming Liverpool and spraying people with water. She "seemed to be leading the entire population of the city on a merry dance, like some kind of arachnid Pied Piper."
-   Maman, the giant pregnant spider which now menaces Ontario.
-   It was once believed that a fossil arthropod from the Carboniferous, called _Megarachne_, was one of these. However, more recent evidence shows that the extinct creature wasn't a spider at all but in fact part of an extinct group of animals known as sea scorpions. So yes, not Giant Spiders, just _Giant Scorpions_. The largest sea scorpion, _Jaekelopterus_, reached a length of over eight feet (2.5 meters), _four times_ as long as _Megarachne_. But it didn't _look_ like a spider, so that's all right then.
    -   As a matter of fact, the largest known prehistoric spiders (the Jurassic _Mongolarachne_ and the Permian _Arthrolycosa_) were actually _smaller_ than the largest spiders of today, with neither exceeding 5 inches in leg span.
-   Although they are not true spiders (though they are distantly related), some species of pycnogonids (also known as sea spiders) can reach 2 feet across. The largest ones tend to be found in cold, deep water so you're unlikely to encounter those kinds.
-   Also, there is the Japanese spider crab. It's a kind of crab reaching 3.8 m from claw to claw and looking like a giant spider.
-   A persistent urban legend holds that giant spiders were found in the summer of 2001, living near Windsor Castle. They were discovered by British Telecom workers in an underground maintenance tunnel. Entomologists initially reported that they were venomous, aggressive and possibly a type thought to have been extinct for centuries. On later examination they proved to be _Meta menardi<small>◊</small>_ cave spiders, which are notoriously _non_aggressive. The colony was rehomed to a nearby forest.
-   Another persistent urban legend is that of the so-called Iraqi Camel Spider. Supposedly, these creatures grow up to one foot in length, can run up to twenty-five miles an hour, make a screaming noise when they run, can jump two feet in the air, have a venom powerful enough to melt flesh, and attack and kill camels to lay their eggs in their stomachs. This has come with many claims about them attacking humans. In reality, Camel Spiders are not spiders at all but are part of a separate group of arachnids called Solifugae. They never grow beyond six inches in length, have a top speed of ten miles an hour, can't jump, and don't even produce venom. The idea that they attack camels and humans comes from their name; "Solifugae" means "flee from the sun", which is exactly what they're doing. Dead camels and humans provide shadows for them to use to get out of bright desert sunlight. And aside from all that, they're not even exclusive to the Middle East, also being native to the American Southwest.
