A type of reveal where misdeeds depicted in the work were in fact committed by two agents (man or beast), either separately or working together. If they are in cahoots, then they may well pretend not to know each other, or to hate each other, to throw the detective off the scent; they may also arrange that each of them can give the other an apparently unshakeable alibi.

A less crowded version of Everybody Did It. Compare Lotsa People Try to Dun It, where multiple characters make separate attempts on the life of the victim.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the _Death Note_ manga (and anime), it's revealed that a second Death Note made its way to Earth. Light eventually takes advantage of this and works with accomplices more than once.
-   In _Sword Art Online_, the perpetrator of the "Death Gun" killings in Gun Gale Online is revealed to be two people: someone controlling the in-game avatar, and a real-world accomplice who murders the player at the same time the avatar is killed to simulate the effect of a "magic gun that kills you in real life." But the real twist is that the government investigation afterward reveals there was a third partner in the loop who managed to evade authorities.

    Comic Books 

-   Rather confusingly done in _The Long Halloween_. When the Holiday Killer is apprehended and revealed to be Alberto Falcone, he tells the police that there was _another_ Holiday Killer, but he refuses to elaborate. Batman interprets this as a reference to Harvey Dent aka Two-Face, who had killed Carmine Falcone on Halloween and thus (metaphorically) inherited Holiday's mantle. But in the very last scene, Harvey's wife, Gilda, monologues that _she_ was actually the one responsible for Holiday's first victims. Whether they were telling the truth, or had simply lost touch with reality due to grief, is not entirely clear.
-   _Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (1968)_: The first issue opens with a variant of this. Fury breaks into a building but is shot dead by a masked man who catches him by surprise. It's then revealed that 'Fury' was actually a 'Life Model Decoy' android duplicate, and the masked man was the real Nick Fury - it was all a Fake Action Prologue, a training exercise to test the android's abilities. But _then_ it's revealed that the L.M.D. was shot _four_ times, and Fury only fired three - the villain of the story, Scorpio, has stealthily interrupted the training exercise with a simultaneous Assassination Attempt, assuming that he was shooting the real Fury.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   In _Black Rat_, it turns out there are actually two different killers wearing the rat mask: Asuka's sister Akane, and Creepy Crossdresser Kengo. At the end of the film, after Akane and Kengo have both been killed, Misato dons the mask to kill the last survivor Saki.
-   _Blood and Black Lace_: There are two people under the featureless mask at separate times Massimo killed some of the women, and Cristina killed the others to draw the police's attention away from him.
-   At the end of _Boar_, the giant boar has been killed and the survivors drive away. However, as their truck pulls out of sight, a second giant pokes its snout of the undergrowth and snorts angrily.
-   Used in _Hell Night_. A bit of an odd example as the legend that surrounds the setting tells about one "deformed guy hiding in the house", and doesn't explain who the second deformed guy is.
-   Subverted in _Hot Fuzz_. At first Nicholas Angel suspects the Obviously Evil local supermarket manager Simon Skinner of being behind the string of mysterious deaths, but he has a waterproof alibi. Just when Angel realizes that there must be more than one killer, he's attacked by Skinner's brutish thug, who tells him to rendezvous at a castle after believing Nicholas to be disposed of. Once Nicholas gets there, it turns out that in fact almost the entire town is in on it.
-   It is revealed two thirds into _Just Before Dawn_ that the fat redneck psycho killing the cast has an equally fat psycho twin, and they work together in getting rid of people trespassing their family's territory.
-   When the killer crocodile is captured in _Lake Placid_, another one immediately appears. The second one gets shot, but it later turns out that the second, smaller crocodile was _male_...
-   _Murder Mystery_:
    -   Nick's original theory has Charles and Suzi conspiring (which they are, but unsuccessfully).
    -   Then he theorizes it's Grace and Tobias, which is half right.
    -   The actual killers are Juan and Grace.
-   Played with in _Psycho II_, wherein Lila Loomis and (initially) her daughter Mary are trying to drive Norman Bates back into insanity and murder by impersonating his seemingly long-dead mother (i.e. the source of his troubled mental state), while Emma Spool simultaneously commits a series of murders and claims to be Norman's actual mother. Ultimately, Mrs. Spool kills Lila, Mary tries to kill Norman based on the mistaken assumption that he was actually responsible for the murders (and becomes the main police suspect for them herself as a result), and Norman finally rejoins the fun by killing Mrs. Spool and resuming his life as a slasher.
-   Subverted in the first _Scary Movie_. There are three separate killers all adopting the Ghostface persona. The first two are two gay teenagers (although one of them is in denial about it) working together, while the "real" killer is a cop Obfuscating Stupidity who kills the former two for trying to upstage him.
-   In the first _Scream (1996)_, it turns out that there were two Ghostface killers working in tandem to terrorize the town of Woodsboro. This was also true in _Scream 2_, but by then it was expected. (However, _Scream 3_ had only one killer. But _Scream 4_ returned with the duo of Ghostfaces.)
-   In the BBC television film _Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking_, the murderer turns out to be a pair of identical twins, which enables them to always have an alibi when they kill.
-   After the killer Santa Claus's identity is revealed in _To All A Goodnight_, it is shown to the audience that there is also a second one.
-   In the 2014 meta-sequel to the 1976 movie _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_, the "new" Phantom killer turns out to be two men working together: the first victim who faked his death with the help of the second one, the sheriff deputy.
-   In the sex comedy _Video Vixens_, a film-within-the-film, an X-rated _Dragnet_ parody, involves a serial rapist who is actually identical twins; one would go out and rape someone while the other is seen in public doing something mundane as an alibi. The next night they'd switch places. (Yes, despite the description, it's a comedy.)

    Gamebooks 

-   In the _Choose Your Own Adventure_ book _Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey?_, it turns out that the crime was committed by the titular character's niece and her fiance - he stole a bottle of arsenic from Thrombey's greenhouse, and she spiked his bottle of brandy with it.

    Jokes 

-   A Russian joke goes: the Chinese army desperately tries to cross a mountain pass guarded by one Russian soldier. 100,000 Chinese try to storm the pass, no one returns. 200,000 Chinese try to storm the pass, no one returns. 500,000 Chinese try to storm the pass, one badly wounded soldier returns and yells: "Ambush! There are TWO of them there!"

    Literature 

## Authors:

-   This was one of Agatha Christie's favorite twists. Many of her novels and short stories had the murderer turn out to be a man and a woman in a Secret Relationship who either pretended to dislike each other or not know each other, and then use that to create alibis and opportunities for each other.
    -   She first used it in her very first novel, _The Mysterious Affair at Styles_. Alfred Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard pretend to hate each other, but they are secretly in cahoots to kill Emily Inglethorp (Alfred's wife and Evelyn's boss).
    -   _They Do It With Mirrors_: Lewis and Edgar—secretly father and son—collaborated on the murder, with Edgar Holding Both Sides of the Conversation while Lewis stole off to do the deed.
    -   _Evil Under the Sun_: Supposedly Christine and Patrick are in a dysfunctional marriage and Patrick is carrying on an affair with Arlena, who turns up as the murder victim. In fact Christine and Patrick are quite Happily Married, and evil, as they collaborated together to kill Arlena.
    -   _Death on the Nile_: Linnet and Simon are a honeymooning couple, with Jaqueline the Woman Scorned stalking them. It turns out that Simon and Jacqueline were in cahoots from the beginning to kill Linnet so that they'd get their hands on her money.
    -   _Third Girl_: Andrew Resnick and his wife Mary conspired to kill Andrew's old girlfriend Louise, because "Andrew Resnick" is actually an impostor and the real Andrew's old lover from back in the day, Louise, is basically the only person alive who can identify him as a fake.
    -   _Dead Man's Folly_: George and Hattie, a married couple, conspired to kill multiple, people, including the real Hattie (George's wife is an impostor), and two other people who knew of their crime.
    -   _The Murder at the Vicarage_: Anne Protheroe and Lawrence Redding separately confess to the murder of Anne's husband in order to paint themselves as a pair of Starcrossed Lovers, when in truth they carefully planned the crime together so that both would have an airtight alibi and be cleared as suspects.

## Individual works:

-   _Dark Places_: There are two killers working separately. One is Calvin Diehl, "the Angel of Debt", who Patty hired to kill her, and ended up killing Debby accidentally. The other killer is Diondra, working completely separately, who kills Michelle because Michelle learned about her pregnancy.
-   _Discworld: In_ Maskerade'', the major break in the case happens when Granny realizes there are two Opera Ghosts. One Opera Ghost is the hapless but good Walter Plinge, who used the Ghost to hide out under the opera house and do some other mysterious but not evil things. The other is Salzella and actually killed the dead opera members.
-   _Forest Kingdom_: Used more than once in the _Hawk & Fisher_ spinoff series.
    -   In book 1, a werewolf proves responsible for most of the murders due to being trapped in a house full of potential victims during the full moon, but Adam Stalker, a member of the influential DeFerrier family who was operating under an alias was responsible for the deaths of Councilor William Blackstone and later his wife Katherine.
    -   In book 2 (_Winner Takes All_), early on, James Adamant tells Hawk and Fisher that someone's been embezzling from him, and leaking information on his campaign to his enemies. It's revealed later that two different people were responsible — his political advisor had fallen for a woman who was working for the opposition and was being tricked into telling her all sorts of things, while Adamant's wife Dannielle was embezzling to feed her drug habit.
-   _Hive Mind (2016)_: In _Hurricane_, the pranks at the Sea Farm were initially committed by Treeve, who then went to the mine for a while and told Massen, who had already been cleared by Morton, to commit some more so that he'd have an alibi. The murders were committed by a third person, Treeve's daughter Rose.
-   In _The Illuminatus! Trilogy_ universe, John F. Kennedy was shot by five snipers simultaneously.
-   This is one of the theories floated in the _Jesse Stone_ novel and TV movie _Stone Cold_, based on the fact that the bullets recovered from the victims came from two different guns. Turns out there's "one shooter, two guns," but she was helped by her husband.
-   _Judge Dee_: After a retired general is found dead the day after his birthday, with clues pointing at a local painter (whose father claimed the general was a traitor and a coward, and was kicked out of the army for it), the Judge investigates and discovers a tiny arrowhead embedded in the general's throat, along with poisoned fruit. It turns out the general was wanted dead by two people: a (now-dead) former governor who knew the general _was_ a traitor<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and the general's son, who was having an affair with one of his father's concubines, a major no-no in Tang society (it's outright referred to as incest). The son gave his father a box of poisoned fruit, hoping to blame the murder on the painter, while the governor had given the general a booby-trapped quill, to be used on the day he wrote his memoirs. The quill killed the general, but the Judge orders the general's son to commit suicide (see major no-no above).
-   _A Line to Kill_: Middle-aged author Anne Cleary and Sexy Secretary Kathryn Harris are revealed to be mother and daughter. They worked together to lure Asshole Victim Charles le Mesurier away from a party, so they could kill him, because they blame him for the death of Anne's son and Kathryn's brother.
-   _Retired Witches Mysteries_:
    -   During the events of book 1, the coven learns that two people are responsible for the death of Olivia and the theft of their spell book — a witch, and a thief who does their bidding. The thief and killer turns out to be Lisbet, Joe's partner as a homicide detective, under the influence of her mother Matilda, an ancient witch who's trying to extend her own life by killing other witches and stealing their powers.
    -   In book 3, Makaleigh Verza, a member of the Grand Council of Witches, is murdered. Hedyle, her arch-rival, set it up and got another member, Bairne Caelius, to do the actual killing, because Makaleigh wanted to make changes to the council that Hedyle and Bairne didn't approve of. Shortly after it comes out, Hedyle herself is killed, but it turns out to be the witchfinder Antonio de Santiago, who was just taking advantage of the confusion and knew her death would free him.
-   In _Wings of Fire_, Tsunami initially assumes that the dragon killing Queen Coral's unhatched daughters is the same one who tried to kill her, herself a daughter of Coral. It turns out, however, that the killer of her sisters is an enchanted statue created by Orca, while Whirlpool was the one who tried to kill her.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _American Vandal_:
    -   The main characters wonder about the possibility in season one that more than one person was responsible for vandalizing the teachers' cars. Near the ending, they come to the conclusion that the most likely culprit, Christa, worked together with her boyfriend to do it, since she had her leg broken at the time. While she deleted the footage of the crime, her boyfriend did it.
    -   Season 2 plays with this. It turns out that the pranks were the work of many people, the actual criminal blackmailed all of them to force them into playing the pranks for him.
-   One episode of _Castle_ has Castle competing with Beckett's Romantic False Lead over who can solve the murder first, with each man focusing on one particular suspect. Beckett's the one who realizes that _both_ suspects did it. They weren't working together, and had no idea the other one had done anything, they just both wanted the guy dead. Esposito tells Beckett it was generous of her to let both the guys win.
-   _Columbo_: This is the final reveal of _Double Shock_. The episode shook up the normal Columbo formula by showing the murder as normal and then a bit later revealing the murderer is one of a pair of identical twins, leaving the viewer uncertain which of the two did it. As the presence on this page indicates, it turns out they worked together on the murder.

-   _Criminologist Himura and Mystery Writer Arisugawa_:
    -   The victim of "A Study in Vermilion - Part 2" was bludgeoned over the head and then, a little later, had a rock dropped on her from a high place. Initially thought to be a single suspect making sure she was dead, it soon becomes clear that two people are involved.
    -   In "ABC Killer", the four murders are revealed to have been committed by two different people. The first two victims were killed by the third victim. The third and fourth victim were then killed by the main suspect of the case, leaving her with an alibi for two of the supposed serial killer victims.
-   The Blue Paint Killer in _CSI_. The first ep has the believed killer escaping execution due to more bodies being found, then he dies at the end. In the later ep, more cases popped up, and the group realized the executed man was just the apprentice. The guy captured in that episode was the real main killer. Both men did the crimes, though.
-   In _Death in Paradise_, this turns out to be the solutions in "The Blood Red Sea", "The Complex Murder", and "Murder at the Polls".
-   This trope is rare in _Midsomer Murders_, but it does happen in "The Creeper", where the killers turn out to be a mother and daughter-in-law killing to protect a family secret.
-   _Psych_: In season 3, Shawn captured serial killer Mr. Yang. It isn't until a year later that it was revealed that she had a partner, Mr. Yin (Mary was killed after figuring this out). A year after that, it was revealed that Yin was Yang's father, and, though they worked together, he was actually the one who committed the murders.
-   Like the movie it's based on, the killer in the first season of _Scream_ turns out to have been been two people. This is first suspected by the characters when the killer of the first season is revealed, as they were seemingly attacked by the killer in a previous episode. The surviving killer then becomes the new Big Bad of the next season, their motive being revenge for the death of their accomplice.
-   An episode of _Supernatural_ had the Winchesters investigate murders they assumed had been committed by a ghost or some other supernatural creature due to its apparent ability to teleport, but turned out to be the actions of two normal guys pretending to be some kind of ghost.

    Video Games 

-   In _Knights of the Old Republic_, the Jedi council asks you to investigate a murder with two suspects, each accusing the other. Turns out they both did it, but not intentionally, they just happened to act on their separate plans simultaneously. Then it turns out to have been a Secret Test of Character — the Jedi master "assisting" your investigation had already solved it on his own.
-   In _Master Detective Archives: Rain Code_, one case has three primary suspects, but investigating the crime proves that none of them had the opportunity or ability to have killed the victim on their own. It turns out that this is because all three of them had colluded to carry out different elements of the murder as revenge for the victim killing a mutual friend six months prior, and getting away with it because of her family connections.
-   In _Paradise Killer_: The full investigation eventually reveals that there were two separate plots to murder the Council that happened on the same night, completely unaware of each other. The player can unveil both, or play favorites to spare characters they sympathize with.
-   In _Persona 4_, there are actually _three_. One copycat, one pawn who thought he was _defeating_ the killer (while actually creating new victims) and then the original killer that orchestrated the whole scheme. There's also a Man Behind the Man, who had nothing to do with the killings but caused them indirectly by empowering the original killer.

-   In the _This War of Mine_ DLC _Father's Promise_, the burglary in the Pharmacy was committed by two separate parties. The perpetrator who left the only trail is not the perpetrator who left the clues to your Driving Question; it is sheer coincidence that following the first perpetrator's trail allows you to pick up the trail of the second.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Danganronpa_ does this a lot; aside from the fact that Monokuma is the Big Bad responsible for every murder as the host of the Mutual Killing Games, nearly every case has at least two culprits, though usually with one being the central planner and murderer.
    -   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_:
        -   Chapter 1: Leon was the one who killed Sayaka, but she tried to kill him first, only for him to fight back and kill her instead. The manga also has it be an Accidental Murder on Leon's part.
        -   Chapter 2: Mondo murdered Chihiro, but Byakuya tampered with the evidence to blame it on and draw out Genocide Jack, the Serial Killer hiding among them.
        -   Chapter 3: Celeste trucked Hifumi into killing Kiyotaka, then killed Hifumi herself to keep him from talking.
        -   Chapter 4: Sakura was Driven to Suicide, but Aoi was manipulated by a fake suicide note written by Monokuma into trying to get everyone else killed as well.
        -   Chapter 5 and 6: Eventually, it's revealed that there are two masterminds behind Monokuma, collectively known as the Ultimate Despair. However the mastermind who was manually controlling the bear, Junko Enoshima, murdered her accomplice Mukuro Ikusaba early in the story by baiting her into breaking the rules. This was done to hide the fact that they had swapped identities.
    -   _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_:
        -   Chapter 1: Teruteru killed the Ultimate Imposter, but Nagito goaded him into it in the first place. Teruteru was actually aiming for Nagito.
        -   Chapter 2: Subverted. Peko killed Mahiru, but it seems that Fuyuhiko ordered her to do it. Turns out Peko did it of her own accord, assuming Fuyuhiko _would_ order her to do it.
        -   Chapter 3: Also subverted. It seems that Hiyoko may have been an accomplice to the murder of Ibuki, but she was not; Mikan killed both of them on her own.
        -   Chapter 4: Gundham killed Nekomaru, but they fought in a Duel to the Death. Had Nekomaru won, he would have killed Gundham.
        -   Chapter 5: Chiaki was the direct killer of Nagito, but Nagito himself set things up so she would accidentally kill him.
        -   Chapter 6: There are in fact two-to-three masterminds: Nagito, who manipulated the other students and set up much of the conflict; Monokuma/Junko, the host of the killing game; and Izuru Kamukura, Hajime Hinata's Superpowered Evil Side who put the Junko AI into the Neo World Program.
    -   _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_: The war between kids and adults in Towa City was set up by Monaca Towa and AI Junko Enoshima, the latter disguised as Shirokuma and Kurokuma.
    -   _Danganronpa 3 Side:Future_: The mastermind of the Final Killing Game is Kazuo Tengan, head of the Future Foundation, whose goal was to eradicate despair for good by tormenting Ryota Mitarai until he snapped and decided to use his talent to brainwash the entire world into feeling nothing but hope. The "spy" that was supposedly going around killing everyone does not exist, all of the "murders" were actually brainwashing-induced suicides. Monaca Towa also killed Miaya Gekkogahara at some point before the events of the killing game and replaced her with a remote-controlled robotic duplicate that she was using to spy on the Future Foundation, but she was ultimately a Red Herring who had nothing to do with the Final Killing Game.
    -   _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_:
        -   Chapter 1: Kaede set up a trap to kill the mastermind, but ended up accidentally killing Rantaro with it instead. Except she didn't, the trap missed. The mastermind, Tsumugi, then killed Rantaro herself and arranged the scene to make it look like the trap worked to keep the killing game on-script.
        -   Chapter 2: Actually averted; Kirumi is the sole culprit behind Ryoma's murder this time. Although Ryoma did let himself get killed because he discovered he genuinely had nothing to live for and no one waiting for him on the outside.
        -   Chapter 3: Subverted; while it seems like Angie and Tenko may have been killed by two different people, Korekiyo murdered both of them. Of course, Korekiyo _is_ two different people, or at least he thinks he is.
        -   Chapter 4: Miu, the victim, was trying to kill Kokichi, only for him to manipulate Gonta into killing her.
        -   Chapter 5: Kaito killed Kokichi, but at his request as part of a Thanatos Gambit.
        -   Chapter 6: Tsumugi is the mastermind of the current killing game, but she's just one of many employees of Team Danganronpa, the true mastermind who makes the _Danganronpa_\-themed reality show. And of course, the only reason they keep making the show is because the fans keep watching it and demanding more.
-   Even Fan Games are prone to this, as demonstrated by LINUJ's _Another_ duology:
    -   The masterminds of _Danganronpa Another_ turn out to be Akane Taira and Yuki Maeda, aka Utsuro, working together as subordinates of Junko.
    -   _Super Danganronpa Another 2_:
        -   Chapter 1: It is established that the 5-man group known as _Void_ are the people behind the Killing Game. Mikado kickstarts the Killing Game by ordering Hajime to kill Yuri.
        -   Chapter 2: Subverted; while Kokoro inadvertently provoked Emma into killing her, Emma orchestrated the entire murder on her own.
        -   Chapter 3: Both Hibiki and Kanade are the culprits behind Setsuka's murder. Downplayed by the fact that Kanade planned the entire murder, and Hibiki could not disagree.
        -   Chapter 4: Nikei goads Yuki into cutting Shinji's throat, followed by Sora attempting to cut Shinji's throat again using an unconscious Nikei. Shinji eventually kills himself to save all of them from execution.
        -   Chapter 5: Mikado poisons Teruya's food and pins the blame on Iroha. Teruya goes ahead with it as a Heroic Sacrifice to screw Mikado over.
-   _The Great Ace Attorney_:
    -   Retroactively applied to Case 1 of the first game, as while Jezail Brett is the killer, we find out at the end of the second game that Seishiro Jigoku, the judge of Case 1, was the one who ordered the hit on the victim.
    -   In Case 2 of the first game, Nikolina Pavlova was the crime's accidental culprit, while Bif Strogenov worked with her to cover it up.
    -   Both Enoch Drebber and Courtney Sithe were responsible for Case 3's murder in the second game. Drebber set up most of the crime, while Courtney physically killed the victim and assisted Drebber.
    -   Cases 4 and 5 of the second game have two sets of these. In the present, Seishiro Jigoku was Gregson's murderer, but Mael Stronghart was the mastermind behind it, and the events of both games. In the past, Klint van Zeiks was the Serial Killer known as The Professor, but was killed by Genshin Asogi in a duel once he found out, and Genshin was scapegoated for all the murders.
-   In _Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors_, the True Ending of the game reveals that the mastermind behind the Nonary Game, Zero, is actually _two_ of the game's participants. Though Santa is actually The Dragon to Zero/Akane. Also, Ace masterminded the first Nonary Game and is the reason Akane did this one.
-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_ has between one and four antagonists for the final case of the original trilogy depending on how you count.
-   A possible theory about the truth of the Rokkenjima Mansion massacre in _Umineko: When They Cry_ is that the events are caused by two teams working independent of each other, one planning and one opportunistic. It eventually turns out that this is indeed the case- Beatrice/Yasu was the one who planned the Deadly Game, but when everyone won and lived, it was Kyrie and Rudolf Ushiromiya who shot and killed everyone (except Eva, who killed back in self-defense) so they could get the Rokkenjima treasure.

    Webcomics 

-   _xkcd_ has a cartoon proposing a parodic compromise with the 9/11 "truthers": One of the twin towers was destroyed by a secret US government conspiracy and made to look like an Islamic terrorist attack... and the other tower actually was destroyed by Islamic terrorists. Both attacks happened on the same day by complete coincidence.

    Western Animation 

-   _Central Park_: In Season 3 "A Matter of Life and Boeuf", someone stole Ambrose's cote de boeuf (an expensive steak) and later on they discover someone added poison to the steak with the intent to kill Ambrose. It turns out Kendra added the steak sauce to kill Ambrose so she can inherit his money, but didn't account for Anton stealing the steak to sell on the black market. They were going to use the money to start a new life together.

    Real Life 

-   The Hillside Strangler turned out to be the Hillside Stranglers, Angelo Buono and his cousin Kenneth Bianchi. The police in that case had actually guessed beforehand that they might be dealing with two killers, thinking that two men would have an easier time carrying and dumping bodies around Los Angeles suburbs.
