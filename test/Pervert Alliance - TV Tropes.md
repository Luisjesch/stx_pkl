Fiction tells us that All Men Are Perverts. And perverts all have one thing on their mind.

Typically, those perverts are prone to extreme self-interest, especially if there is but a single heroine for them to focus on. They want what they want and they're not interested in sharing.

However, sometimes, men, and perverts, can unite under a common banner with a unified goal.

Often, there are plenty of girls to go around, so the idea is that the Pervert Alliance can savor their licentious goals together, and no one is necessarily trying to steal what someone else wants. Often this involves them working as peeping Toms.

Sometimes their stated goal will be protecting the "purity" of the girl they're all interested in. And by that, they mean utterly destroying the guy who has the best chance of actually being in a relationship with the girl.

Of course, the members of the alliance are Hypocrites who would each jump at the chance to ogle the young lady or have her attention to themselves.

These sorts of alliances can be very short-lived, especially when the men in question realize that once the common enemy is eliminated, they have the individual members of the group to contend with.

To keep this trope in the realm of comedy and not anything more sinister or even criminal, the Pervert Alliance is, naturally, doomed to failure. Often excruciatingly painful failure.

If any member of the group suggests taking their actions further, to physical contact, or even sexual assault, expect at least one member, possibly more, to have a Heel Realization and decide that there are some lows they won't stoop to.

There may be occasions where groups of women gather together to act perverted towards a male character, or, depending on the story, another female character. Due to a variety of reasons, like Double Standard: Abuse, Female on Male, and Girl on Girl Is Hot, women are seldom punished for their behavior, and if they are, it generally doesn't involve the Megaton Punch that male characters would receive, often taking the form of a stern lecture.

Very common to the Harem Genre.

See also Accidental Pervert, Pervert Revenge Mode, Casanova Wannabe, and Abhorrent Admirer.

Contrast Unprovoked Pervert Payback and Forgiving the Accidental Pervert. Contrast Sisterhood Eliminates Creep where the alliance is against the pervert(s). (Of course, both groups can coexist in the same universe, and will be guaranteed to be mortal enemies.)

Given that even the most "innocent" version of this would likely be criminal in reality, even accounting for Values Dissonance, No Real Life Examples, Please!.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Rentarou's harem is known for its friendship and mutual assistance - but it also means they do perverted things together. For example, in chapter 21, everyone except Shizuka is trying to spy on Rentarou taking a bath. Rentarou turns out to be ready for this, and the plan fails - ironically, only Shizuka sees Rentarou naked.
-   _Ah! My Goddess_: A very bizarre example involving a group of girls acting in what they believe is the interest of a male. Urd, Peorth, and Skuld are all trying to prove that they are capable of granting wishes in an unofficial contest. Seeing Keiichi respond to the sight of a woman's skirt being blown up by the wind, they all try to accommodate what they believe is his desire by casting spells to make the wind flip up girl's skirts for him. Unfortunately, their spells get intertwined, turning Keiichi into the wind itself. Thankfully, Belldandy is able to restore him.
-   _Amagami SS_: Downplayed. In one episode, Juunichi is waiting near the pool for a girl who is doing a swimming class. Haruka spots him and motions for him to join her, assuming he's there for the same reason she is, to watch the girls in their swimsuits, and tells him that her vantage point will allow them to observe without being observed.
-   _Castletown Dandelion_: The Akane Sakurada Fan Club (of which her eldest brother Shuu is a member) groups together to watch Akane be flustered and cute. And when Kanade jokingly tells Shuu that the club president was asking for Akane's hand in marriage, Shuu protests loudly. On top of that, all of the boys in her class unite under the goal of seeing her panties when it looks like she's forgotten her skirt and is about to ascend a flight of stairs. Even her bestie, Karin, gets a nosebleed when seeing said panties.
-   In the third season of _The Familiar of Zero_, some of the male students have dug a tunnel so they can peep on the girls in the bath. They then try to cheer up Saito by inviting him along but have to actually drag him there since he's reluctant to get into more trouble with Louise. Sure enough, they get caught and everyone ends up in trouble.
-   _Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu_: Though not given a formal name, Kurz, Kazama, and Ono-D team up to try and spy on the girls in the open-air baths. However, Sgt. Major Mao and Sgt. Sagara anticipated this tactic by Kurz, and so Sousuke had gone ahead of the group and laid the hills surrounding the baths with a series of booby traps and security devices designed to thwart them. And in the end, Kazama got a face full of Sousuke wing-wang as the baths changed sides after 10pm.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_ has the Musashino Kinky Club, a select group of respectable citizens with perverted desires, and Urumi attempts to sell them Miyabi and her two friends in order to help Onizuka to pay a trip to Okinawa for the school.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_: The Soul Brothers, Keiichi, Ooishi, Irie, and Tomitake, all try to do various things, such as dreaming up a "punishment game" where they'd have Shion lick whipped cream off of Mion, or when they try to obtain a pair of swimming trunks that will make the wearer irresistible to women if worn for three hours. However, while formidable together, they often turn on each other out of their own individual self-interests.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   The most obvious example are the band of Furinkan High School male students whom the fans nicknamed "The Hentai Horde", having accepted Tatewaki Kuno's proposal that the one who beats Akane Tendo is the one who will have her as a girlfriend. A combination of perversion and the extreme implication that Kuno (because he sees Akane as the ultimate example of feminity, at least until Ranma-in-girl-form comes along) will attack any man who refuses to show interest in Akane (and thus be part of the horde) meant that Akane had to deal with a sizable group of guys<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  attacking her when she arrived at school every day since the start of the school semester, which began an unspecified time before the series begins. Unsurprisingly, this lead to Akane developing her harshly critical attitude against men. That said, once they found out that Ranma was Akane's fiancee (and Ranma beat the snot out of Kuno), they immediately accepted this and let the couple alone (except for Kuno. However, in the manga, they briefly resume trying to Best Her to Bed Her during the stint when Akane broke up with Ranma and Nabiki took over as his fiancee.
    -   The anime has the exclusive, one-time appearance of a group of four male nerds at Furinkan High School who make up the school's Chemistry Club. These four perverts unite under the banner of making Akane Tendō theirs by trying to set land mines to blow Ranma to bits during his duel with Ryōga. They fall victim to their own trap, while Ranma is unscathed.
    -   In an anime filler episode, Happosai finds an apprentice in the perverted shapeshifter Copycat Ken, who happily joins Happosai in stealing underwear and groping pretty girls, including the three Tendō sisters.
    -   In an anime filler episode, it's shown that at least a significant portion of Tatewaki Kuno's kendo club at Furinkan High are lusting over Akane themselves; when Kuno is briefly knocked unconscious, they promptly start brawling over which of them can woo Akane now that he's out of the picture.
-   _School Rumble_: Most of the boys of Class 2-C are in an alliance, led by Ganji "Buddha" Nishimoto, with resident Camera Fiend Fuyuki providing snaps of the girls in class. Itoko-sensei wipes out their collection of photos with a virus and a Fan Disservice pic of Harima's butt and a caption telling them to knock it off and study.
-   _SHUFFLE!_: Not one, not two, but three groups of pervert alliances, each dedicated to a different girl, all dedicated to destroying Rin Tsuchimi. The names vary between the Japanese and the English dubs, but their goals remain the same. If one girl looks like she's won Rin's affections, the other two groups will turn on the group protecting the current girl with the idea that since one girl seems to be the subject of Rin's love, their girl is safe, and they need to support whichever relationship is thriving, breaking the alliance with that girl's group.
-   _Urusei Yatsura_: In the manga, it's established in the third chapter that Lum's brief appearance in Tomobiki inspired deep lust in four of the pervier members of Tomobiki High School, to the point they bribe Ataru to help them summon Lum back to Earth in order to be able to admire her and woo her. Ironically, they actually drop out of the manga relatively quickly, vanishing forever after the 28th chapter. The 1981 Animated Adaptation thrust them into the limelight as major secondary characters, giving them the group monikers of "Lum's Stormtroopers" and "Lum's Fanclub" as well as individual nicknames to identify them. This expanded version portrays them as united by their common lust for Lum and envy of Ataru, with Mendō pointing out in the second movie, "Beautiful Dreamer", that their alliance would fall apart quickly if they didn't have a common foe (Ataru, or even Mendō) to unite against, as none of them would countenance letting Lum fall for one of the others in their ragtag little group.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_: A wholly female group at a convent that was none too holy lights a "grail-shaped beacon" to draw in wandering knights seeking the same. Sir Galahad, after stating he seeks the Grail, is informed that it's not the first time that they've had that problem, and that he must punish the offending girl by tying her on a bed and spanking her soundly, with the other girls quickly insisting they be spanked as well. "And after the spankings, the oral sex!" declares the lead girl. Sir Galahad decides he can stay a _bit_ longer. Fortunately, Sir Lancelot shows up to rescue Galahad from the "peril".
-   _Porky's_: The famous shower room scene shows the guys cutting a hole into the wall of the gym shower to spy on the girls, but getting a surprise when Ms. Balbricker comes in.
-   _Revenge of the Nerds_: In the first movie, the socially outcast nerds get the upper hand on the hot cheerleading sorority Pi Delta Pi by invading the latter's house for a panty raid and secretly planting hidden cameras in the girls' showers and bedrooms. In the next scene, the sexually frustrated nerds literally stay awake all night, just watching women sleep. Later, they use candid shots of a topless Betty (from the footage they had) to sell apple pies in the pie contest. Lampshaded by nerd leader Lewis after he has sex with Betty:
    
    **Lewis:** All jocks ever think about is sports. All we \[nerds\] ever think about is sex.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _M\*A\*S\*H_:
    -   A unique mixed-gender alliance forms against Capt. BJ Hunnicutt in one episode as the result of a prank war. After Hawkeye and Winchester come to the realization that BJ had been arranging for Charles to be pranked and Hawkeye to take the sole blame, they get revenge. They strip BJ naked while he sleeps and leave his cot in the nurse's tent, with his blanket nailed to the cot so he can't use it for cover. The nurses eagerly eye their new tentmate. And then, to really sell it, Hawk and Winchester had arranged for a fake announcement of incoming wounded, leaving BJ with no choice but to exit the tent, to the hoots, hollers, cat calls, and wolf whistles of the whole camp.
    -   In another episode, and another prank war, Margaret steals Hawkeye and BJ's bathrobes from the showers. The two try to discreetly make their way back to The Swamp (their tent), only to find the nurses of the camp sitting there waiting for them. They're very enthusiastic about what they see.
-   _Scrubs_: In "My No Good Reason", Turk shows a tape of his attractive nanny to the men, and one woman, of the hospital. Carla walks in and asks them what they're watching. On the spot, the group is able to work together to come up with a lie explaining that they're watching football despite the season being over. This is undone when Turk sits on the remote, turning the TV back on again.
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_: In the episode "Forever Plaid,” Zack and Cody accidentally knock a hole in a wall, but then discover that the girls' soccer team is on the other side. They invite two of their friends, Bob and Warren, to partake, and make extra holes so all of them can spy on the girls. Predictably, they're caught, get poked in the eye, and grounded, and Carey makes her sons write a two-thousand-word apology note to the girls, each.

    Webcomics 

-   _Collar 6_ has the Everfall Park Voyeurs Club, a group of five guys who'd hang out and check out all the girls in the town park. Lecherous, but not dangerous besides one guy who liked to touched because he was a masochist who liked getting smacked for it. By their second appearance, they had quit the club thing due to differing life paths.

    Western Animation 

-   _Daria_: Joey, Jeffie, and Jamie, collectively known as "The Three Js", are all vying to date Quinn. In their initial appearance in "The Invitation", they all attempt to have a sexual encounter with Quinn, who shuts all of them down. "The Three Js" are an interesting case in that while they all go out of their way to sabotage each other, Quinn herself is well aware of their intentions, and frequently manipulates them into doing what she wants. This does backfire on one occasion, however, in "Fair Enough", when one of them is chosen to understudy for Kevin last second, the other two deliberately give him the wrong lines to read to humiliate him, and this ends up embarrassing Quinn as well.
