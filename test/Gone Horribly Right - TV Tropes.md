_"The big downside of the plan to infuriate an emotionally traumatized psychopath into trying to kill me was part two, where the lunatic actually did it."_

You'd think the opposite of Gone Horribly Wrong would be a _good_ thing, right?

You'd be wrong. Maybe even _dead_ wrong.

Rather than have something unexpected happen that sabotages the program, the researchers have everything proceed in an orderly fashion. The results are everything they hoped for — better, in fact. Unfortunately, they've succeeded _too_ well, and it's this success that dooms them. The result turns out to be too intense, too powerful, or the researchers didn't fully consider the consequences of what they wanted to do. Or, maybe they just made an awesome stealth device... that they can't find because they can't see it.

Sometimes the results are a runaway chain reaction that threatens to destroy the facility/city/region/country/continent/world/_universe,_ a weapon that not only annihilates its target but has high (or total) collateral damage, or a Psycho Prototype that obeys orders, only too well. Other times, the instigators find out the result was something they shouldn't have attempted in the first place. The Potential Applications were so exclusively in the evil/destructive side that the project had no possible use _but_ to destroy.

Things that have Gone Horribly Right might not be immediately apparent. The researchers may create and market an entire product line based on their Super Prototype that only later turns on them, or over-performs its duty like, say, a genetically engineered plant that has a high CO<sub>2</sub> consumption out-competing every other plant on the planet _and_ causing massive fires to keep feeding. Usually, this is paired with a Fantastic Aesop that (heavily) implies the intended use or goal of the research is to blame.

This trope may be most succinctly captured in _Jurassic Park_, and directly spelled out in Aesop fashion, with Ian Malcolm's line "Yeah, yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they _could_ that they didn't stop to think if they _should_."

A Sub-Trope of Literal Genie, putting it in the scientific category as opposed to Be Careful What You Wish For, which is when what the character wanted falls in their lap through coincidence or magic rather than their own planning and hard work. A Supertrope to The Genie in the Machine, where the machine does _exactly_ what you told it to. Since Love Potions never work, any one that "works as intended" will usually end up in this category. Often overlaps with Dangerous Forbidden Technique. Compare Springtime for Hitler, What Could Possibly Go Wrong?, Nice Job Breaking It, Hero, Hoist by His Own Petard. Didn't Think This Through often follows the realization of this trope. May become a Game-Breaker. A form of invisibility that the creators now can't find because it's invisible could be considered Useless Useful Stealth. Sometimes goes hand in hand with A Lesson Learned Too Well.

    -   In another strip Jason Fox mentioned to Marcus that the last time they went as fast as they did via tobogganing on a hill in the winter, they were thrown off the toboggan when they released the brake chute, so they learned from that mistake by taping themselves with a lot of tape so they _can't be thrown off_ when they use the brake chute. It worked too well, however, as while they were successful in not falling off, their toboggan was shown flying through the air with them on it due to it being a windy day.
    -   At one point, Andy plants 24 zucchini plants in the back yard, with the intention of getting and eating fresh homegrown zucchini. She got zucchini, all right...more than even Peter could eat.
-   _Calvin and Hobbes_:
    -   Calvin didn't want to clean his room, so he made an identical clone of himself and ordered the clone to clean his room. Naturally, the clone didn't want to clean Calvin's room either, so he ran off to cause mischief, knowing the original Calvin would be blamed. Later in the story, the clone gets a hold of the duplicator and starts cloning himself, with predictable results.

-   _The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part_: At the start of the movie, Lucy admonishes Emmet for his niceness and optimism, saying he needs to grow up and become tough, just like her, advice he ends up taking to heart. After she finds out that the Systarians are as nice as they claim to be and actually want to _stop_ Armamageddon, she tries to talk Emmet out of stopping their plan. Unfortunately, her abandonment of her badass persona and claim that she secretly liked bright and colorful things convinced Emmet she's been brainwashed, as "The real Lucy would never say that".

-   In _Meet the Robinsons,_ Lewis, feeling low after another family chose not to adopt him, bitterly complains that even his own birth mother didn't want him.

Not only did Woody not intend to actually hurt Buzz, but the rest of Andy's toys turn against him for what looks a lot like a jealousy-driven murder.

    Jokes 

-   An old Mexican joke tells us that Pepito used to play pranks on his family. He would go to his relatives and say with an evil smirk, "I know _everything_." The relatives would bribe him to keep the secret. It worked perfectly well, until he said it to the milkman, who instead of bribing him, hugged him and yelled: "My son!"
-   An old Moon-Landing Hoax joke is that NASA _did_ fake the moon landing...except they hired Stanley Kubrick to help them do so, and he immediately demanded that they shoot it on-location.

    Music

    Music Videos 

-   Kate Bush's song "Experiment IV", which tells the story of a group of scientists contracted into a military experiment to create a sound-based weapon. In the original song the lyrics are somewhat ambiguous in regards to the outcome, but in the video, the scientists are unfortunate enough to succeed in creating the sound-based weapon, which proceeds to kill everyone working in the building (and it might have _escaped_). To make matters worse, the general who contracted the scientists actually seems _pleased_ with the results, implying that he may actually attempt to implement it as a regular weapon.

    Myths & Religion

-   Hinduism has a couple instances where a Honey Trap goes a bit too far.
    -   When in need of seducing demons, Vishnu takes the form of a beautiful female avatar, Mohini, and never fails to save the day.

Thos eventually involve Shiva and Mohini having sex and producing the god Shasta.
    -   Tilottama is a beautiful apsara created by Brahma's orders to seduce two unbeatable demons, Sunda and Upsunda, into killing each other. When Tilotamma returns, however, it's the gods' own turn to fall in love with her, so much that Shiva and Indra grow many heads and eyes, respectively, in order not to stop looking at her.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Gran Apache spent years of his AAA career trying to wreck the relationship between his daughter Fabi and Billy Boy. Billy Boy did eventually snap, but rather than leave Fabi, Billy Boy became a Domestic Abuser.
-   The man asks for a chair. The crowd obliged, catapulting the seating for the first six rows in all directions. You never do see the two wrestlers on the mat escape the nigh-instant barrage. It wasn't the only time either, you'd think they'd have known after the first.
-   _WCW Monday Nitro_, Jan 4. 1999: Sure, Tony Schiavone, go ahead and spoil to your TV viewers that Mick Foley, who wrestled for your company at one point in his career, is going to win your chief competition's primary championship title to prevent them from changing the channel. And be sure to end it with "That'll put some butts in the seats!" It's not like they're gonna do just that or anything...
-   In 2022, Edge decided to stop caring what the fans thought about him because it was holding him back, and encouraged others to do the same. This worked great— until his recruits declared that they just had one last thing to get rid of, namely _him_.

    Radio 

-   In one episode of _The Men from the Ministry_ Mr. Lamb is being depressed by the utter boredom of his life, and Mildred and Mr. Lennox-Brown decide to make him take dancing lessons so that he will find more joy in his life. He does find dancing very enjoyable, so much that he plans to quit his job in the Ministry and become a professional dancer.
-   Real Life: In 1964 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission adopted the FM Non-Duplication Rule, limiting owners of AM stations in large cities to simulcasting only 50% of their content on FM stations they owned. The idea was that, by requiring more original content on FM, a slow market for the technology would noticeably pick up.  
    It did. After 1967, the year the rule went into full effect, a slowly growing FM sector boomed as freeform radio took off, primarily playing a lot of late 1960s rock that had fanbases but never got played on AM Top 40 radio, and by the late 1970s more people were listening to FM than AM. So much so that the FCC repealed the rule in 1986 because _AM_ stations were struggling.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   _Cyrano de Bergerac_:
    -   Given his own company, the Gascon Cadets, disrespects him, De Guiche plans a Last Stand for them.

-   Hamlet did reach his end goal of killing the king... pity that almost everybody else he cared about became collateral casualties, and he dies as well.
    -   Depending on the interpretation his madness may also be this by the end.
-   Hamilton _did_ clear his name of embezzlement accusations. The way he went about it - releasing a pamphlet stating that he was not embezzling government funds to James Reynolds, but instead using his own money to pay the man off in exchange for allowing him to sleep with his wife - absolutely cleared his name because he had no reason to implicate himself in something just as bad if he was lying. Unfortunately, it nearly destroyed his marriage and inadvertently led to his son's death. At least he wasn't being accused of perjury anymore, right?
-   Elisabeth of Austria(-Hungary) got her way alright, traveling the world and doing whatever she damn well wanted, unburdened by the rigmaroles of court and a loving (the feeling quickly became non-mutual for her) but ineffectual husband. It, however, came at the cost of/resulted in:
    -   The death of two of her children, Sophie by sickness due to a trip Sisi insisted she go on, Rudolf by suicide due to Sisi choosing non-interference in his issues because she had cut her bonds with the Emperor long ago.
    -   Franz Joseph cheating on her and infecting her with a STD. He regretted it, but the damage was done.
    -   Her turning into a bitter and cold Broken Bird, only able to find solace in the arms of Death. Takarazuka Revue's treatment has Death calling for Sisi as Lucheni stabs her, turning it into a suicide than a murder.
-   In _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_, this occurs with both main characters. Sweeney wants revenge for his false imprisonment, but gradually slips into a Serial Killer philosophy thanks to a bout of Black-and-White Insanity. Mrs. Lovett loves Sweeney and wants to be with him, but he's too busy pining for his dead wife Lucy. In the end, the two plots intersect: Sweeney's obsessive bloodlust sees him unknowingly murder Lucy, who wasn't dead after all, just driven insane by her trauma. Mrs. Lovett, who knew the truth but kept it hidden for her own agenda, _does_ get Sweeney all to herself—at least for the thirty or so seconds between The Reveal and Sweeney burning her alive for lying to him.

    Web Animation 

-   _Madness Combat_: The Auditor started creating magnified soldiers to combat Jebus, Hank, Sanford and Deimos. An "agent magnification chamber" was constructed to speed the process up, and for all we know it worked: Mag v4's were seen in action less than five minutes after the incomplete v3 was killed. What the Auditor didn't expect was the possibility that Deimos would use the chamber _on Hank_.
-   In _Red vs. Blue_, Project Freelancer's bad ideas worked much better than their good ones. There's a reason why in the present day its operations consist largely of recovering its agents' armor and enhancements.
    -   In order to get enough A.I. to properly test (they were only provided with one), they tortured it until it fragmented. The resulting fragments worked great paired with elite Freelancers... and included two (Sigma and Omega) who were not only disloyal, but _actively malevolent_.
    -   The point of pairing soldiers with A.I. was to create an unstoppable super soldier. They got what they were aiming for in The Meta (Originally Maine with the aforementioned Sigma), whose primary goal was _killing other Freelancers_ and taking their A.I. and enhancements.
    -   Top Freelancer agents were encouraged to compete amongst each other, which stoked interpersonal issues that resulted in Freelancer teams falling apart.
-   _RWBY_: The Apathy are not strong or ferocious, but their mere presence drains the will to live of anyone who's within range. Facing financial ruin, Bartleby's last desperate scheme is to cut the costs of Huntsman protection by artificially keeping his farmstead community permanently calm to avoid Grimm attacks. After capturing two Apathy and locking them in the cellar, he is too drained to seal the tunnels until the following day, allowing the rest of the pack to relocate their missing members. By unknowningly sealing the entire pack into the tunnels, Bartleby creates such an apathetic community that, once they retire to bed, they never rise again.
    
    **Maria:** Bartleby's plan worked. No-one was angry, or sad, or scared. No-one was anything. And then... no one was left.
    
-   _Camp Camp_: Max spends Season 1 trying to break David out of his The Pollyanna nature. In the season finale, he succeeds... and promptly goes into My God, What Have I Done? mode because a broken David is kinda completely terrifying.
-   _The Wrath of Giga Bowser_: The description of the video on the original forum thread where it was posted describes the goal of Ganondorf, Mewtwo and Dr. Mario as being to "attempt to create a monster". Needless to say, they succeed... and said monster proceeds to immediately turn on them, before going on a rampage throughout which it kills every single character that crosses its path.

-   _Cobra Kai_ High school student Eli is a Shrinking Violet who takes up Karate to learn to stop being bullied and give himself confidence. He then grows a mohawk and changes his name to Hawk. Over the course of the series he becomes such a jerk to all of his friends that they abandon him, drinks beer, commits various acts of assault and vandilism, gets tattooed, breaks his former best friend's arm, and almost beats his former bully to death in front of his dojo after his opponent gives up and spits on him after he is defeated just to prove that he cannot be pushed around anymore.
-   In _Elfslayer Chronicles_, the DM established that in her world, Humans Are Bastards and you Can't Argue with Elves. This backfired on her when a player annoyed by the elf posturing decided that his character, a human, would _not_ be an exception to the rule and therefore have no reason to play along with the DM's plot of helping the elves. Oh, and he would also be a total Magnificent Bastard who used the elements the DM introduced to turn the campaign into a Xanatos Gambit of getting away with sabotaging the party's mission via murdering the guy who they were supposed to escort back home to stop a war.
-   _The Fire Never Dies:_ In an effort to stem the flow of American arms to the Entente, Germany resumes unrestricted submarine warfare. This leads to a reckless U-boat captain sinking a British merchant ship while still in American waters, leading to the United States declaring war on Germany. However, this in turn escalates an ongoing dockworkers' strike into a general strike by the Industrial Workers of the World, and ultimately into a full-blown socialist revolution that seizes control of much of the country, including most of the American industrial base. With the US now embroiled in a Second American Civil War, the supply of arms is indeed cut off... but now it looks like the socialists will _win_.
-   The backstory of the Monster Girl Encyclopedia has an example that managed to go horribly wrong _and_ horribly right at the same time. A succubus takes the throne of the Demon King with help from a human hero she'd fallen in love with, and uses her powers to give all the monsters succubus aspects so as to turn their hatred towards humanity into lust and affection. The part that went horribly wrong: Monsters can only give birth to other monsters, all of whom are female, thus dooming the species to a slow extinction. The part that went horribly right: The newfound affection did not come with a _conscience_, leading to monsters becoming sex-crazed rapists. Good judgment call there, Demon King.
-   Taerel Setting: The kin'toni project. (Project Bloodmoon), yes, they made their superhuman soldiers, but shame they turned on the Xeara zu'aan empire right?
-   _Starwalker Earth_: The new drive works perfectly. It can modify the gravity around a star to open a door to another star by going outside the universe. This has two effects: It turns the drive into a time machine and it damages the stars it flies through.
-   In _Pay Me, Bug!_, Grif Vindh wound up with the score of a lifetime, through more than a little blind luck. Of course, blind luck doesn't do much for one's reputation, so he spun a yarn involving him breaking into Ur Voys (The Empire of the Radiant Throne's most secure facility) single-handedly, stealing the contraband, and smuggling it out right under the noses of The Radiant Throne's Swords. Unfortunately for him, a certain black-ops division of The Alliance of Free Worlds' military hears the story. They also want to steal something from Ur Voys, and they're not above blackmailing someone of Vindh's "skill" to get it for them.
    
    **Grif Vindh:** If I'd known the Alliance was going to get wind of this, I'd have thought of a much less self-aggrandizing lie.
    
-   Several man-made SCPs collected by the SCP Foundation have this as their origin story. Mostly those made by The Factory, Dr. Wondertainment or Prometheus Labs (though the former two are so enigmatic that it's hard to tell _what_ they were trying to accomplish).
-   One hypothetical situation on _Atomic Rockets_ had a computer virus intended to sabotage missile anti-countermeasure computers by allowing them to "endlessly self-modify their programming" results in the missiles gaining sentience and declare themselves a sovereign nation. And they all lived happily ever after-the newly sapient weapons force a cease fire agreement between the warring factions and go on to become galaxy-wide diplomats.
-   On the now-defunct WWWF Grudge Match website (devoted to Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny fights), every so often, particularly when both combatants were very much The Scrappy, fans would clamor for the "All Killed And Mutilated" button to be incorporated. The people running the match were generally loathed to do so... but they finally caved when the match was a to-the-death match between Scrappy-Doo and Jar-Jar Binks, refereed by Carrot Top. The staff commentators even warned against voting for "All Killed And Mutilated." Not surprisingly, many people ignored it... and it turned out that picking to kill both Scrappy and Jar-Jar resulted in Carrot Top winning. As noted in the comments for the match, this caught many people by anguished surprise. This was likely all planned by the site runners, as the next match was a Tournament of Champions, seeing which of the year's previous winners would then kill Carrot Top.
-   The story for artist Keith Thompson's "The Warden" sees this happen with the Changeling Tale. The Warden was a young faerie left in the crib when the Fey Folk stole a human child. However, his human parents proved to be _impossibly_ patient and loving, and he came to love them in return. Once he reached adulthood, he stayed with them until they passed away, and then set out to make the Fey Folk feel every bit of the sorrow they had ever inflicted on humanity.
-   _Roll to Dodge_ has this baked into the system. If you roll a 6 on your action for the turn (referred to as Overshot), then it "succeeds", but with disastrous consequences due to an overly large effort.

In the second, Paul succeeds in creating "vantabeige," the purest form of beige possible and theoretical ultimate goal of Ian's company — which now no longer has a reason to exist, promptly cancels Taupecon and fires Ian, and is bought by Lockheed-Martin because they want to explore vantabeige's hypnotic effects.
-   Seen in the _Scott The Woz_ episode "Game Stores"; when working at the game store "Games on a Shelf", Scott is told by the manager to lose subtleties and manners and just push the store membership. When the next customer walks towards the register, Scott greets them with this:

-   In "Don't Panic" by _Door Monster_, the commander realizes that his crew actually shoot better when they're blindly flailing around in a panic than when they stay calm and aim, and tries to get them to panic. He immediately realizes that this was an _awful_ idea, because now they're nearly hitting him most of the time.
-   Claire Luvcat from _Cream Heroes_ trains one of her cats Nana to ring a bell after teaching her to shake and high-five. Cue Nana ringing the bell constantly to get extra love and attention from Claire, and even trying to get the other cats to do it.
-   _Jet Lag: The Game_: At the end of Day 2 of _Crime Spree_, Sam & JT decide to stay at the Boston Airport Hotel, but then realize that it would be too obvious, so they exploit a rule that allows them to turn off their tracker 30 minutes before arriving at any hotels they stay at. They drive away from the Boston Airport Hotel, turn off the tracker, and then do a U-turn, all to make it look like they are going somewhere else. Adam & Ben are fooled by this, and they realize that they have no way of finding Sam & JT at this point, so they decide to turn in for the night... at the Boston Airport Hotel.
