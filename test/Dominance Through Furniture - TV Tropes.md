**Gil Eavis**: Have you ever used another human being as a footstool, Mr Wambsgams?

**Tom Wambsgams**: Uh, Senator, I use a variety of target-oriented incentives to enhance optimal performance...

There are many, many ways of illustrating a character's dominance over a setting or a person, from Cool Crowns to impressive thrones, from pimped-out regalia to magnificent palaces. However, for a thorough demonstration of just how much power one has, one of the bluntest methods is to use another living being as a piece of furniture.

In one common form, a servant, lackey, or victim is forced to kneel on the floor while their master props their feet up on them like an ottoman. Another popular variant features the victim being made to play the role of a chair and support the weight of their tormentor - with dire consequences if they collapse. Others still may involve the victim being used as stairs, footstools, or even carpets.

Needless to say, this is a technique used almost exclusively by villains and Nominal Heroes of a distinctly sadistic bent and is often used as an Establishing Character Moment to that end.

May be combined with Too Important to Walk.

Compare and contrast Human Doorstop, the lighter, comedic variant of this trope. Also compare Cruelty by Feet, which is very similar thematically.

As a result, his next scene features the boss reading a newspaper while using the surviving enemy as an ottoman; for good measure, he also warns the poor man that if he keeps trembling, he'll happily use the man as a toilet instead!
-   Done quite dramatically in _Young Avengers_ when the Mother parasite hijacks Hulkling's shapeshifting powers to force him into the shape of a throne for it to sit on. It's not a smooth transformation either, his body being stretched into tendrils molded into a chair shape.
-   _Wonder Woman (2011)_: Hades has his father chained up with a hole through his stomach as his throne.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The 1968 movie _Great Catherine_ (based on the eponymous play by George Bernard Shaw) features a playful, flirtatious version of this: the empress Catherine the Great takes a liking to the handsome British ambassador, and when he refuses her advances, she orders to tie him up and uses him as her footstool, tickling his ribs with her bare toes. As a condition for getting him untied, she tells him to kiss her foot ("When an Empress allows you to see her foot, you should kiss it"), and after that, they spend a passionate night.
-   _300_: Xerxes is introduced being carried in a massive sedan chair by an army of slaves, who then form themselves into stairs for him to descend to the ground.
-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_: The Goblin King is introduced sitting on his throne with half a dozen lesser goblins being used as an impromptu ottoman chair.

-   The live-action _Tokyo Tribes_ has the Big Bad's son, N'koi, who has an entire room full of people he's posed as living furniture.

-   In the _Fantozzi_ series, renowned for its Black Comedy, the company's top CEOs have chairs made of "human leather" as a status symbol. When he has a chance to touch one of the chairs, Fantozzi even recognizes the specific colleague that was used.

    Literature 

-   _Cold Days_: At Harry's birthday party in Arctis Tor, the Winter Lady, Maeve, sits on a young man to watch Harry fight. Her mother, the Winter Queen, prefers the traditional ice throne, which also serves to highlight the differences between the two Queens of Winter.
    
    The Sidhe shoved the young man to his hands and knees, and Maeve's slight weight settled across his broad back.
    
-   _Everworld_ takes this to a horrifying extreme in "Realm of the Reaper": the Norse goddess Hel has taken to using the victims she's ensnared as the road leading into her domain, essentially burying people up to their necks so their heads serve as the paving stones; as a result, they are left to be repeatedly trodden on and tripped over by any unfortunate guests invited into Niflheim until the victims finally die and decay into skulls that are - at a distance - identical to real paving stones. For good measure, Hel has a thing for keeping the freshest examples closest to her domain, likely so she can enjoy the screams.
-   _Moby-Dick_: Upon meeting the man, Ishmael is surprised when his new companion Queequeg arranges a nearby drunk to serve as a suitable chair to sit on.

-   In _Modern Faerie Tales_, the Unseelie Queen orders an unfortunate to act as her dinner table just because she can and she's in a bad mood—and being the Unseelie Queen, she's going to do something really nasty if he spills anything, which he will because he's not that strong and he's terrified of her. Roiben, a knight traded into her service, offers himself in the poor guy's place.
-   _Overlord_:
    -   After Ainz frees his subordinate Shalltear from her brainwashing, she demands to be punished for betraying him. After another of his subordinates, Demiurge, makes him a macabre throne made of human bones, a disgusted Ainz instead decides to punish Shalltear by making _her_ his seat for the time being. Instead of being a punishment, however, Shalltear becomes very, _very_ aroused by being sat on by her beloved Ainz. In fact, it makes Shalltear so happy that an extremely jealous Albedo excuses herself from the room and can be heard yelling and breaking things in frustration.
    -   Ainz's skeletal soldiers also often get used this way, such as in his epic entrance with the lizardmen, in which an entire group of skeletal soldiers lay themselves and their shields against a gigantic stone block thrown into a frozen river, forming themselves into stairs for Ainz and his entourage to ascend.
-   In _The Wheel of Time_, Graendal of the Quirky Miniboss Squad spends her free time using mind control to amass a harem of servants who also act as living furniture. Her preference is for men or women who are both attractive and politically important.

-   In the _Black Mirror_ episode "USS Callister", programmer Robert Daly regularly takes out his frustrations on doppelgangers of his co-workers in a virtual reality game of his own design; in one early case, he throttles clone Walton half to death, then forces him to kneel on the floor while Daly props his boots on top of him - and Walton's reaction indicates that he's done this before. In the process, Daly illustrates both his power over the virtual setting and the fact that his shy exterior is just a mask for a Psychopathic Manchild.

-   In _The Drew Carey Show_, when Kate worked as Mrs. Lauder's personal assistant, the former was often used by the latter as a desk when she needed to write a quick memo. When Kate finds another job, she sings a happy-sounding quitting song, but when that job falls through, she begs Mrs. Louder for her job back by lying about an "impersonator" going around pulling pranks. Mrs. Lauder rehires Kate and immediately puts her to work as a footstool.

-   _Succession_: One of Mean Boss Tom's tactics to assert his authority at ATN (a reflection of how little pull he has with the family) is making "human furniture" or "footstooling" his employees (putting his feet up on their backs).

Botha, then-president of South Africa, was entertaining a British diplomat, and claimed he employed several "kaffirs"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in his mansion. When the diplomat remarks that he hadn't seen a single black since he got in, Botha bellows:
    
    "You haven't? By God, man, what do you think you wiped your feet on when you came in?!"
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Tzimisce clan of _Vampire: The Masquerade_ take this to a disturbingly literal extent: because of their clan-unique Discipline of Vicissitude and their utter contempt for humanity, they enjoy making innocent human beings into furniture for their homes — including chairs. Worse still, many of these objects are still sentient even after all the mutilation they've been subjected to. One particular Tzimisce brags that he's created a fainting couch that still cries when you sit on it!

This was common practice among the Portuguese, meant to imply a subordinate status for black Africans.
