He always _thought_ himself to be on the top of the world.

If you're struggling to do something, nothing can give you more satisfaction than success. That's why thinking you've succeeded at something when you really haven't can be really annoying or even downright torturous. Considering that, you have to wonder why the minds of people, both real and fictional, insist on forcing them to experience visions of such things as having dead relatives come back to life, marrying lost loves, escaping life-threatening situations, becoming rich/famous and even just getting out of bed when we're tired in the morning, even though they all have to inevitably end with the rug being pulled out from under you.

Basically, if you don't know the meaning of "I can take the despair, it's the hope I can't stand," this clearly has never happened to you.

Often in fictional works, the audience is led to believe along with the character that the hallucination/dream is real. We learn it wasn't real only in usually very creepy and ominous reveals, a reveal that usually involves somebody saying something like, "But you never really got out!!!"

    Anime and Manga 

-   The Big Bad's Eye Of The Moon Plan in _Naruto_ involves shrouding the world in an "Infinite Tsukuyomi". This would trap every living person in a permanent illusion, ceasing all conflict by purging free will itself from the world, so everyone could live in a reality without war or suffering.
-   In _Fate/Zero_, Matou Karia hallucinates that he was able to save Sakura as he dies right in front of her.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_, Atticus/Fubuki hallucinates that he is able to finish his duel with Fujiwara in a draw. Moments later, it turns out Fujiwara landed the winning blow a couple turns ago.
-   In one of the earliest installments of the original _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ manga and anime, Yami Yugi challenges a would-be psychic to a Shadow Game.

-   Weaponized by the Big Bad in _Bleach_: He could use his Master of Illusion powers to simply win fights immediately, but instead prefers to make his opponents think they've succeeded first. In an infamous scene, he is apparently impaled and killed by Hitsugaya. The illusion then drops to reveal that Aizen switched places with the attacker's close friend Momo. He really likes getting their hopes up.
-   At the end of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable_, Yoshikage Kira believes that he was able to activate Bites The Dust and defeat all the heroes. But as he cackles about his victory, he notices that a bird just flew through him... leading him to come to the slow realization that he was killed and is now a ghost stuck in the Ghost Alley. Reimi, his first victim from many years ago, then appears to him and forces him to remember the _real_ ending of his fight with the heroes, where Kira is not only stopped from activating Bites The Dust by Koichi and Jotaro's combined efforts, but is also subject to an Undignified Death at the hands of an ambulance meant to save him.
-   In a chapter of _The Disastrous Life of Saiki K._, Saiki and Kaidou are cornered by some delinquents who want their wallets. A terrified Saiki asks what to do, but Kaidou tells him not to worry, because the time to release the power sealed in his right hand is now. And, amazingly, a force comes out of Kaidou's arm and defeats them all. Obviously, none of that actually happened. Kaidou just passed out from fright and started dreaming. An easy clue for the reader is that Saiki had no reason to fear and doesn't talk.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Dr. House hallucinates sleeping with Dr. Cuddy and getting over his Vicodin addiction. It takes him a full day to figure out that it didn't really happen.
-   in the season six finale of _Cold Case_, Detective Lilly Rush's car gets run off the road and into a river. She hallucinates escaping and solving the case of who did it. Weirdly, she apparently guesses right, going by the shots of arrests in the real world at the end of the episode.
-   In the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "Hard Time". Chief O'Brien said he frequently dreamed about flying back to the station during his 20-year prison sentence. The irony is that the 20-year sentence turned out to be an artificial dream.

-   Subverted in _Malcolm in the Middle_. A whole episode revolves around Lois imagining that she had daughters instead of sons (interspersed with the reality of trying to handle three boys).

-   Happens in _Hikonin Sentai Akibaranger_ frequently. In the first episode, for instance, Nobuo is riding his bike when he sees a thief steal a woman's purse. He rides the bike down a flight of stairs, takes down the thief with some Bike Fu, and hands the purse back to the woman- only what actually happened was that he fell off the bike on the way down the stairs, and the woman picked it up and tossed it at the thief herself. Indeed, the entire premise of the show starts out as one of these, as rather than really becoming a Sentai team as they first thought, their battles take place only in their minds. However, after some encouragement, they're okay with this, thinking it'll improve them as people. Later episodes give their battles real consequences.
-   In _Scrubs_, when JD has to deliver bad news to a patient, he stops, and instead spends the episode working to get the test redone, thinking the machine, known to be faulty, might have given incorrect results.

We then cut back to the beginning of the episode, JD dismisses the fantasy we just saw as pointless wishful thinking, and steps forward to deliver the bad news.

    Video Games

After a heartfelt conversation, she warns him that he has "one more hardship to go through." He wakes up back in court as the guards prepare to remove him to his place of execution.

    Web Comics 

-   _The Order of the Stick_: Girard's Gate, created by illusionist Girard Draketooth and guarded by his descendants, is naturally filled to the brim with illusions (at least it was before Girard's family was wiped out). One of the illusions traps the victim in their idea of a happy ending.

    **Peter:** I can't believe we lost the talent show! What'd we do wrong?  
    **Chris:** Well, I think I can shed a little light on that. You guys were so baked, you didn't sound anywhere near as good as you thought you were. I was in the audience.

-   The _Justice League_ episode "For the Man Who Has Everything", as part of his plan to conquer Earth, Mongul sent a plant called Black Mercy to Superman due to believing the Man of Steel was the only real threat to his hopes to conquering the planet. Once attached, the Black Mercy fed Superman a reality where Krypton never exploded, he was a simple farmer with a wife and son, and his father is a disgraced old man. Batman attempted fruitlessly to several different means to remove the plant but was only able to succeed when Superman himself realized that the reality was a fake. Unfortunately, the Black Mercy then attached itself to Batman and fed the Dark Knight a reality where his father and mother survived the night of their deaths and his father fought off the gunman that killed them.
