_"Humans are disgusting. We'll have sex with anything. Every day, an Earth doctor pulls an octopus or a light bulb out of someone that was put in there on purpose. Captain Kirk boned things that didn't even have holes until he met them. And this article itself is probably next to an ad featuring a flashlight that you can fuck. Seriously, come visit, aliens. See what happens."_

The Captain Kirk approach<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to First Contact; namely, to have sex with a Green-Skinned Space Babe. Of course, questions of Bizarre Alien Biology are never raised beforehand, such as whether the species in question has compatible genitalia or if their bodily fluids are poisonous, acidic, or otherwise harmful to humans (or vice-versa). If it can walk, talk, and (hopefully) give consent, humans _will_ find a way.

Inverse of Mars Needs Women and a subtrope of Interspecies Romance. See also Anal Probing for when the aliens do this to us (but may not be thinking of the act as sexual). May involve Hot Skitty-on-Wailord Action. Not to be confused with The Xenophile, that's when a human shows a strictly platonic love of aliens.

In the event that humanity ever encounters sapient extraterrestrial life, No Real Life Examples, Please!

    Anime and Manga 

-   _The Elder Sister-like One_ stars a neglected orphan who makes a deal with Shub-Niggurath for her to become his big sister, beginning a rather heartwarming Slice of Life story ...in the safe for work serialisation, that is. In the original doujins, depicting the events where she takes her payment, well, what else would you expect from the Anthropomorphic Personification of biological reproduction?

    Comic Books 

-   The _XXXenophile_ series is full of these.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Professor X falls in love with Shi'ar Empress Lilandra during the Phoenix Saga and becomes her consort. While their respective duties kept them from truly being together, she would still send him care packages in the form of technology upgrades for the mansion.
    -   Dazzler of the X-Men married extra-dimensional alien Longshot, who has since their divorce gone on to make Boldly Coming a way of life.
-   The Marvel Universe is full of these things. Captain Mar-Vell has at least three children, none of his own species, for instance.
-   _Empowered_: Not one, not two, but three of the Superhomeys obtained their powers from sex with non-humans (one a robot!). In fact, they met in a support group for it. One of them gained his powers through an alien STD.
-   _Green Lantern_: Every single major love interest that John Stewart has ever had was an alien. He has been married to the red/magenta Korugaran Katma Tui and dated the blue Baraquan Merayn Dethalis.
-   Both Superman and Supergirl have been known to have interspecies relationships with humans and other alien races (of course, they're pretty much out of options unless they're wanting to go the incest route). Superman has gotten several children with -usually- Lois Lane in the mainstream continuity and alternate universes. In _Kingdom Come_ it's speculated that a blonde-haired, green-skinned alien woman wearing a "S"-Chest Insignia and related to Brainiac 5 is Supergirl's daughter.
-   _The Incredible Hulk_: Two of the Hulk's three wives have been aliens.
-   Lampshaded in _The Worlds of Aldebaran_. As Alexa notes, Kim encounters a humanoid alien from another galaxy... and one of the first things they do is have sex.
-   _Tech Jacket_: Subverted, when the protagonist Zack Thompson and his Geldarian love interest Princess Lin start getting closer they are foiled by an unspecified incompatibility of genitalia.
-   Alan Moore did a particularly dark take on this one (for laughs) in one of his backup strips for _Omega Men_.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In short: a blue-skinned space babe anthropologist investigates an all-male warrior race and how they reproduce. She decides to do some _first-hand_ research. Turns out they reproduce semi-asexually by shoving their spears into a bunch of giant snails that serve as incubators, and no, that is _not_ a euphemism. The one she, ah, researches? Next morning his spear comes out all red...
-   _Money Shot_ is entirely about this. Christine and her team find aliens to have sex with and make porn.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Power Girl_ fanfic _A Force of Four_, Power Girl has a rather passionate relationship with human Andrew Vinson. One of her _Infinity, Inc._ teammates thinks Kara has had more human lovers previously.
-   _Child of the Storm_: every race in the Nine Realms got a little _something_ when it came to becoming part of Yggdrasil (e.g. Asgardians becoming, well Asgardians), and humanity's was apparently remarkable adaptability and an incredibly flexible genetic code that will successfully recombine with more or less any other sentient species. While this isn't, yet, widely known among humans because alien contact is very limited, it's pointed out that humans are known to successfully breed with a _very_ wide variety of extradimensional species and divinities, including the likes of Asgardians, who were once aliens. Indeed, Asgardians are actually notably _more_ fertile with humans than other Asgardians. This is contrasted with Kryptonians, who had to pick their diplomatic marriages carefully if they wanted viable offspring.
-   In _The Flash (2014)_/_Supergirl (2015)_ crossover _Call Me Kara_, Kryptonian Kara Danvers and human Barry Allen get together and have a daughter.
-   In the start of _Supergirl_ fic _Hellsister Trilogy_, Clark Kent and Lois Lane get married. Their relationship is very... Spirited.
-   In _Last Child of Krypton_, Shinji -Kryptonian- and Asuka -Amazon- get together. At the end of the rewrite, Asuka's gotten pregnant.
-   In _Superman_ story _Superman of 2499: The Great Confrontation_, Superman and Supergirl had offspring with humans, which the main characters are descendants of.
-   In _Superwomen of Eva 2: Lone Heir of Krypton_, Asuka (Kryptonian) and Shinji (human) get into a relationship.
-   Inverted in _With This Ring_ the Martian Manwomanhunter, J'onn J'aarkn loves having sex with humans. So much, that the former biology teacher made a career out of it as an adult film star. Although to be noted Martians and Humans don't look anything alike and Martians are rather monstrous looking in their natural form (the white/green/red skinned humanoids we usually see are mostly for convenience). J'aarkin even notes how Humans appeal to him differently than other Martians.
    -   This becomes a Martian subculture when J'aarkin returns to Mars and shares his experiences with the rest of the planet. Mars has an extremely rigid caste-system and a very static society, making human ideas of liberty and physical sexuality very appealing to the lower-caste White Martians (Martian sexuality is mostly telepathic).
-   Non-consensual version in the _Star Wars_ fic ''Important Information''. Han Solo is captured by a group of imperials and endures several days of brutal torture, but stubbornly refuses to break. His captor is of a species known for using its sexuality as a weapon, and when she sees that torturing Han isn't working, she begins repeatedly raping him. He struggles with the same shame, anger, and humiliation that many real victims do, and his road to recovery is a long one.
-   _A Changed World_ has Kanril Eleya, a Bajoran, make a wisecrack about James T. Kirk's reputation for this: apparently Bones had to create a cure for banta fever after Kirk's first contact with her species.
    
    _(Reshek Gaarra, Bajoran, nearly falls over laughing.)_  
    **Birail Riyannis**: I'm ... missing something funny. Wait, is banta fever—  
    **Eleya**: An STD? Yes it is. _(Biri starts giggling.)_
    
-   In _Kara of Rokyn_, Clark Kent and Lois Lane finally get married after the final battle against Lex Luthor. Not long after their wedding they are already expecting a baby.
-   Averted in _Rocketship Voyager_. As they're 70,000 light years from Earth, Chakotay suggests they find a planet and settle down, but Captain Janeway points out they barely have enough crew to establish a viable colony.
    
    "Then we find a world with biologically-compatible aliens."  
    Janeway was aghast. "What you're suggesting is a direct violation of our Prime Directive!"  
    "Is this the right time to worry about Spacefleet's ban on miscegenation?"
    
-   In _Strange New Girls_, Malcolm Reed has a close encounter with the two long-tongued alien dancing girls he seemed so fascinated with in the pilot episode of _Star Trek: Enterprise_.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Galaxy Quest_:
    -   Played for Laughs when the Thermian Bridge Bunny shapeshifts back into her tentacled Starfish Alien form to have sex with Fred Kwan, who isn't bothered in the slightest. Guy Fleegman on the other hand is a horrified witness.
    -   Lampshaded early in the movie as the "crew" chastises Jason Nesmith for his character (Captain Taggart) doing exactly what James Kirk did in his own show. Although it wasn't made clear if it was his character... or him, it pretty heavily implies that Nesmith is sleeping with the actresses playing the green-skinned space babes. Whether his character is also sleeping with the green-skinned space babes is sort of irrelevant at that moment.
    -   In a deleted scene, two of Seras' goons hit on Gwen DeMarco. She unzips the top of her suit (that's why it's open for the rest of the movie)... and then squashes them with a blast door.
-   In _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_, Ego admits to having sent avatars of himself throughout the universe to bang at least one woman from every alien species he learns of. He has slideshows on his own planet (himself) to prove it.
-   Defied Trope in _Star Trek: Nemesis_. Shinzon, a clone of Picard raised on the Romulan twin moon of Remus, organizes a coup against the Imperial Senate and takes over. Commander Donatra later tries to flirt with him, but he stops her dead cold, as he grew up amongst the Slave Race of the Romulan Empire and thus despises ordinary Romulans. Instead, he settles for engaging in some pretty literal Mind Rape against the half-human Troi.
-   _Star Trek (2009)_:
    -   As a nod to the original series, Kirk attempts this with a Green-Skinned Space Babe but is interrupted by Uhura coming into the room.
    -   The sequel, _Into Darkness_, has him in bed with Caitian (cat people) twins. What a stud.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Barbarella_: The pretty blonde envoy of an Earth that left behind such outdated concepts like violence or physical sex, gets used to both rather quickly after being introduced to them on a more... uhm, anarchic planet. She doesn't decline to try other things too. In one memorable scene, Durand-Durand tries to kill her with his orgasm machine, but she overloads it.
-   Interspecies prostitution is mentioned in _District 9_... with aliens who look like broadly-humanoid shellfish. The protagonist is falsely accused of having contracted an alien STD.
-   Early into _Clerks II_, in Jay and Silent Bob's first scene, Jay talks about this.
    
    **Jay**: People be like 'There he goes. Homeboy fucked a martian once.'
    
-   Before _Alien: Resurrection_ was released in theaters, there were rumors of a sex scene between Ripley and an alien. Sigourney Weaver, when reached for comment, said "No. That's _Alien 5_." There was however one scene of Ripley being carried by an Alien that played with the subtext. The studio wanted to cut it because of the implications, but Weaver refused.
-   In _Aliens_ the Marines joke about previously hooking up with some Arcturians. Hudson laughs at a (male) Marine because his was a male. The grinning reply is "it don't matter, if they're Arcturian."
-   In _Men in Black II_, an entire subsection of the plot focuses on J discovering that Laura is a Zarthan yet still being in love with her. It is also heavily implied that K had a fling with her mother and may be her father. The series as a whole seems to enjoy playing with these ideas.
-   Jake in _Avatar_. Justified, considering the fact that one, it took quite some time to get to _that_ particular point, and two, he was in his Na'vi body.
-   Implied to have happened between two nebbishy humans and two female _Killer Klowns from Outer Space._
-   Parodied in _My Stepmother Is an Alien_ with Celeste, who is a gorgeous Human Alien, arriving to Earth to investigate the source of the signal that has damaged her planet. Her race is extremely logical and pragmatic, having gotten rid of emotions long ago. She starts dating the scientist, who has sent the signal, and, eventually, things lead into the bedroom. The problem? She has no idea what sex is. When she asks her talking purse, the purse looks up the term in the dictionary, but the appropriate definition has been redacted. The purse then finds some "instructional videos" (Celeste comments that this Debbie is a busy woman), horrifying the alien female. She resolves to go through with it for the mission and is surprised to find it very pleasurable, asking her partner why they're only doing this now instead of all along. At the end of the film, after she ends up marrying him, her brother-in-law ends up leaving on the spaceship sent to pick her up in order to teach the aliens about human emotions. Given that the all-female crew of the ship is extremely attractive, the guy will have a lot of fun teaching them about this trope.
-   _The Shape of Water_: Elisa becomes attracted to the Amphibian Man, which leads her to have sex with him. Her friend Zelda is astonished and impressed, as she hadn't realized that his genitals would be compatible (they were normally carried internally, Elisa explains).

    Literature 

-   Deconstructed in James Tiptree, Jr's story, _And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side_ as just a trashy form of Sex Tourism that only perverted aliens indulge in, as part of their exploitation of Earth for its resources.
-   _Animorphs_ has a variation. Tobias' parents were a human named Loren and an Andalite named Elfangor. However, the variation is that Elfangor was in human morph at the time, so they were able to have sex the usual human way.
-   In _Arrivals from the Dark_, LCdr Pavel Litvin ends up having sex with a Faata female, who has never before had sex (the pragmatic Faata have switched to artificial insemination long ago, since it's far more reliable). This while Earth is being threatened with an Alien Invasion! The spin off _Trevelyan's Mission_ series has the titular character constantly engage in sex with humanoid females. The virtual ghost of his long-dead ancestor generally approves, as he himself was married four times, although he'd prefer that Ivar stuck to human women. This ends by the later books, as Ivar gets married to a very traditional-minded woman (in a Free-Love Future, mind you) and promises to stop his philandering ways.
-   Used in Erich von Daniken's nominally nonfiction _Chariots of the Gods_ to argue that Boldly Coming is obviously the first thing we'd be doing if we were traveling to unknown planets. The Ancient Astronauts just thought of it first.
-   In Piers Anthony's _Cluster_ series, powerful Ancient structures are often activated by creatures with strong Kirlian auras having sex in or on them.
-   Citizens of _The Culture_ are genofixed to be genetically compatible with most humanoid species. Their genitals are also modified for increased ability to sustain a climax, which leads to all sorts of rumours and envy among other civilizations. Having a dedicated gland for secreting all kinds of mind-altering substances for personal use also helps to get into the mood.

-   _Foundation and Earth_: The protagonists find only a few planets inhabited by humans (there are no alien races) on The Quest, and Golan Trevize finds a sexual partner on each of them. One of his companions complains about his philandering due to the way they've been to two planets with humans (for only a few hours each time), and both times he found someone to have sex with.
    
    **Golan**: Erotomaniac? Come, Bliss. Twice on this entire trip. Twice!  
    **Bliss**: We were only on two worlds that had functioning human females on them. Two out of two, and we had only been a few hours on each.
    
-   Subverted in _The Gods of Xuma_, where the human explorers discover, with some frustration, that those good-looking humanoid aliens aren't "mechanically" compatible.
-   Played with in Alan Dean Foster's _Humanx Commonwealth_ series, novel _Bloodhype_, in which the rather promiscuous Kitten Kai-Sung has some fun squicking out her companions by describing in some detail the ways to accomplish this with various sentient species. Various other Commonwealth novels further expand on this- it sometimes happens but it's at the very least considered socially unacceptable by most people, even when the two species are fairly close together in terms of anatomy.
    -   Flinx actually ends up getting it on with aliens more than once. Most notably, he sleeps with a Midworld native woman <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and later gets a short-term marraige to an AAnn artist (AAnn are Lizard Folk who's empire has been at war with the Commonwealth since the Commonwealth's inception).
-   _John Carter of Mars_: John Carter and the title character of Edgar Rice Burroughs' _A Princess of Mars_. Of course the Martians are divided into monstrous four-armed Green Martians and heavily-tanned-human Red Martians. Guess which one the Princess is! (Although she does still _lay eggs_, raising some unanswered biological questions...)
-   In the German SF series _Maddrax_, a commander from the US Air Force has an affair with a woman from Mars. However, the Martians themselves are humans who have simply adapted to Mars over the course of five hundred years, so it is questionable to what extent they are considered extraterrestrials.
    -   Rulfan has become intimate with a female daa'mure. They are actually extraterrestrial reptiles, but they can disguise themselves as humans. At the time, Rulfan didn't know who this woman really was. When another daa'mure offers him intimacy, he refuses.
    -   The daa'mure Grao lived with a human woman for several years. It later turns out that sexual contact between humans and daa'mures is not uncommon, but humans almost always believe that they are with someone else.
    -   A woman named Xaana has been found attractive by aliens on several occasions. Even by those who don't look particularly human. But she has categorically rejected every romantic encounter so far.
-   _The Occupation Saga_: Shil'vati females (most of the species) are stereotyped among humans as being promiscuous. Main character Jason discovers that the reverse is also true. While Shil'vati do have relatively fewer cultural hang-ups about casual sex than humans, what's really going on is that most of the Shil'vati that most humans interact with are young military personnel experimenting in an exotic locale (Shil'vati-occupied Earth), and equally young human men and occasionally women being willing to take them up on it. Jason is no exception: a university student who ends up in the Imperial Marines in lieu of prison after getting into a Bar Brawl with an off-duty Shil'vati soldier, by the end of the first book he's slept with nearly every other member of his training squad—even Tarcil, the only Shil'vati male in the group.
-   In Mike Resnick's _The Outpost_, Magnificent Bastard Hurricane Smith, one of the galaxy's top bounty hunters, has this trope has his main passion in life. He's already had five ex/late-wives, all different alien species, as he finds human women to "all look the same". After he and his fellow bounty hunters help save the galactic human Democracy from a genocidal alien invasion, he is last seen in romantic pursuit of a _sentient spaceship_ (with female A.I.), as he rebounds from the death-in-battle of his last wife, an insectoid shapeshifter.
-   _Perelandra_: So, a man gets sent in the nude spend weeks alone with a naked Green-Skinned Space Babe with no one else on their side of the planet. The first person Ransom talks to about the situation assumes their relationship is purely sexual and Ransom vainly tries to explain that the alien's Edenic innocence makes it difficult to look at her perversely.
-   _Ringworld_: The common method of demonstrating your peaceful intentions with whomever you happen to run across is to have sex with them, also known as Rishathra. Made easier on a world where just about every race encountered is a far-evolved subspecies of humankind. Also used as birth control since the various species are no longer closely enough related to produce children. The first people they meet in the second novel reveal they're incapable of Rishathra. Both Louis and Teela end up doing it with Ringworlders. One of the reasons Halrloprillalar wants to leave Ringworld and go to Earth with Louis is because she thinks that humans know very little about sex (she's a professionally-trained ship's whore).
-   _Sister Alice_ has Lyman Chamberlain, who Really Gets Around with the huge variety of Human Subspecies residing on Earth. The protagonist, Ord, recalls stumbles on him trying to get it on with a cetacean-esque human adapted for deep-sea life.
-   Deconstructed in _Spar_, a 2009 short story by Kij Johnson. After the destruction of her spacecraft, a human woman is trapped in a lifeboat with a Starfish Alien survivor, and they have squick-inducing sex simply because there's nothing else to do. Worse, she has no means of communicating with the alien, so never discovers if the act has any meaning for it; or even if she's having sex with a sentient alien at all and not just their equivalent of the houseplant.
-   This trope is definitely Older Than Feudalism; in Lucian's _True History_, some of the narrator's traveling companions have sex with tree-women on a remote island, and end up stuck to them.
-   Not uncommon in L. Sprague de Camp's _Viagens Interplanetarias_ setting, which was deliberately constructed to allow Planetary Romance type stories with somewhat harder science. In _The Hostage of Zir_, one of the characters comments that The Bible forbids fornication, sex with a human you're not married to, and bestiality, sex with a dumb animal, but it says not a word about fun with a Green-Skinned Space Babe on the planet Zarathustra.
-   Octavia Butler's _Lilith's Brood_:
    -   Inverted with the Cthulhumanoid Oankali, who have a deep-seated biological need to crossbreed with every sapient species they come across, and rescue humanity After the End to do so. Given that they're all passive-aggressive tentacle-covered anemone-like things, this takes some work... and they add some incentive by rendering humans incapable of having children other than half-Oankali hybrids.
    -   The Half-Human Hybrid Akin looks almost completely human and tries to act as a diplomat to human "resister" communities who refuse contact with the Oankali. This generally involves sleeping with a few of the local women who hope that they'll be able to conceive a child with him. He does tell them that human sterility doesn't work that way, but hope springs eternal...
-   _Shadows of the Empire_: Prince Xizor, a humanoid alien with green skin (of reptilian evolutionary descent) seems to primarily like human women, as that's all we seem him pursue. He also has human replica droid Guri, who is almost entirely indistinguishable from a blonde human woman (whom Xizor occasionally has sex with).
-   Several species in the _Wayfarers_ series are compatible with humans, and we see a few sexual relationships. Captain Ashby is in a long-term romance with an Aeluon captain named Pei, and Rosemary enters a relationship with her crewmate Sissix.
-   _X-Wing Series_: Discussed by Corran and Gavin when the latter is getting into a relationship with Asyr Sei'lar, who's Bothan (descended from canines). He urges caution, as unexpected problems will arise between different species, relating his own experience having sex with a Selonian (who seem similar to weasels). While they both enjoyed themselves and everything was apparently "compatible", both had allergic reactions to each other (her fur, Corran's sweat), which made them break things off. Gavin later reports no issues with Asyr however (aside from the fact they can't have children). Rhysati (a Human) and Nawara (a Twi'lek) become a couple too with no apparent sexual issues. It seems to be fairly common, although the Empire hates interspecies pairings.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Star Trek_:
    -   Averted by _Star Trek: The Original Series_. While Captain Kirk fell in love with a new person weekly, and there were quite a lot of interspecies kisses, the writers only made it clear he'd had sex on two occasions: once, he lost his memory, went native, and his wife became pregnant<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and once the show returned from commercial to find a woman brushing her hair in his room while he put his boots back on.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  There are numerous examples of interspecies reproduction (Spock being the most famous example) throughout the franchise, however, so apparently quite a few individuals boldly came.
    -   From the rarely-heard lyrics to the original _Star Trek_ theme <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> :
        
        _Beyond the brim of the star light,  
        My love is wandering in star flight.  
        I know he'll find in star-clustered reaches,  
        Love, strange love a star-woman teaches._
        
    -   In _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, this practically seemed to be a part of Commander Riker's official job description as First Officer...
        -   In the episode "Angel One", Riker dresses up in chest-baring native garb and goes off to score with the head-of-state of the titular planet, claiming it is part of the "diplomatic" aspect of their mission.
        -   In the episode "First Contact", Riker gets an... ahem, offer to help him escape a hospital facility from a nurse in exchange for wild alien sex. According to Word of God, this is intended as a parody of Trek fandom.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
            
            **Riker**: The things I do for Starfleet.
            
        -   Again in the episode "A Matter of Honor". Participating in a officer exchange program, Riker signed on to a Klingon vessel, the crew of which subjects him to a rather unusual Secret Test: seeing how he reacts to two female shipmates openly flirting with him (he passes).
            
            **Klingon Officer**: They want to know how you would endure.  
            **Riker**: Endure what?  
            **Klingon Officer**: Them.  
            (_Riker gives the females an appraising look_)  
            **Riker**: One, or both?  
            (_The Klingons burst out laughing_)
            
        -   In "The Outcast", Riker almost boldly goes where even James T. Kirk had never gone before, entering into whirlwind romance with an alien from a species that has a single sex and doesn't usually have a gender identity (though she secretly identifies as female).
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
        -   Chief O'Brien was forced to work alongside a pompous Cardassian engineer. The two bicker and bicker and bicker until, finally, the female engineer comes on to O'Brien and drops an anvil of a pick-up line on him: "I'm _very_ fertile." Apparently, Cardassian women are turned on by argumentative males. O'Brien is clearly shocked and tells her he's married, and it turns out she thought he was flirting with her. Great example of a Cross-Cultural Kerfluffle.
        -   Jadzia Dax was also into a number of men of other species. We have Julian (human), Worf (Klingon), Morn (Lurian), Captain Boday (Gallamite), and Deral (Midianite). And those are just the ones mentioned. The Dax symbiote and its hosts had a reputation for seduction that had been built up with very good reason for _centuries_, to the point that the one Dax host who _wasn't_ like this is called out as an oddity every time he's mentioned.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_:
        -   A major plot point of Season One is a disguised Cardassian agent who sleeps her way to the top of Chakotay's ranks. Even her disguise (Bajoran) was a non-human species.
        -   In "The Disease", Harry Kim falls for an alien babe and ends up catching something (and no, it's not Space Clap). Turns out there are Starfleet regulations that say you've got to clear this (intimate relations with a member of a previously unknown or medically evaluated race, not intimate relations with any alien) with your ship's doctor first. Given the popular view of Captain Kirk, this led to fan accusations of Series Continuity Error, though it could easily be justified as the regulation having been made as a result of those Original Series crews shagging their way across the galaxy, filling it with Human Aliens.
        -   In "Fair Haven", the Doctor mentions that a ship's captain's romantic opportunities are traditionally limited to "the occasional dalliance with a passing alien," casting Captain Janeway's holographic lover in a favorable light.
-   _Smallville_. Technically when anyone had sex with Clark, Zod, or any other Kryptonians.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_ pointed out the ludicrousness of this trope:
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   It's established that by Capt. Jack Harkness' time (the 51st century) this is humanity's attitude to space exploration. Of course, they're also more flexible about the genders involved.
    -   The backstory of "The Unicorn and the Wasp" concerns the child of a human-vespiform romance going insane upon finding out his true heritage and committing murders in the vein of Agatha Christie stories.
    -   The Classic series had its examples of companions using time and space to shag various historical people and aliens, too — Barbara was (by Word of God) banging the Thal Alydon offscreen in "The Daleks", and a possible reading of the scene at the end of "The Massacre" where Steven theorises that Dodo is a descendant of Anne Chaplet is that he's also theorising that he is one of her ancestors....
-   _Battlestar Galactica_:
    -   It has this in the series finale. Upon finding human natives on the planet Kara led them to, the first thing Gaius Baltar talks about is their genetic compatibility with the Colonials. Adama does not let this go without a Lampshade Hanging at Baltar's expense.
    -   Speaking of _Battlestar Galactica_, are there any characters on that show that _didn't_ boldly come? Gaius did anything with a vagina and a pulse, Chief Tyrol married Callie, Helo nailed Boomer, the guy that Starbuck married eventually turned out to be a Cylon, Tigh's wife was sometimes accused of being a slut... hell, even Admiral Cain (!) got some robot Girls' Love in _Razor_.
    -   Ladies and gentlemen, I present the Frakmap
-   _Stargate Atlantis_:
    -   John Sheppard has a reputation for this, usually involving collective eye-rolling by the rest of the characters. In the episode "Sanctuary", Rodney accuses him of "the Captain Kirk routine" of "romancing the alien priestess", and calls it "very 1967".
        
        **McKay**: (_channelling his inner McCoy, no doubt_) Oh my God, he _is_ Kirk.
        
        -   Although, when you watch more closely, it becomes obvious that he's rarely interested in anything beyond flirting and nine times out of ten he isn't the one who initiates things. Sure, he gets hit on _a lot_, but when you count it up over five seasons he only went as far as kissing _four_ women and there's little evidence that he actually slept with any of these women in question. (In one case an alien princess strips for him and his reaction is a very bewildered "I did not see this coming" which is as far from Boldly Coming as you can get.) In fact by the end of the series he's the only major character _not_ with someone. So this is more of an Informed Attribute than an actual character trait.
-   _Stargate SG-1_:
    -   Jack O'Neill and Daniel Jackson both had a few off-world lovers. Note that examples from the Stargate-verse are more justified than in many fictional works, since almost all aliens in the series are Transplanted Humans. Although in one instance, it wasn't technically Jack doing the romancing, but the Tok'ra symbiote he was sharing a body with.
        
        **Col. O'Neill**: Daniel, you dog, you keep this up, you'll have a girl on every planet.
        
    -   The truly alien beings (Unas, Asgard, etc) generally have as little interest in sex with humans as the humans do with them. The Asgard do not even procreate through sex anymore; they are all consciousnesses downloaded into identical clone bodies. Plus, given the nature of the show, most of the people are government officials, military, or otherwise high in status so any sort of hanky-panky would have to be very discreet to avoid... problems.
-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   Captain Sheridan marries and has a child with Delenn, a Minbari.
    -   An episode subverted this trope with Ivanova, who did not want to have sex with an alien diplomat whose species uses the act to finalize business negotiations. Because the alien actually had no idea how humans mated, she she managed to trick him into thinking that a firm handshake and a weird dance was the human way to _do it_.
    -   The one who was Boldly Coming was G'Kar, who in the earlier seasons would have sex with anything that had compatible genitals (apparently including humans). He also slept with one of Londo's wives. Since humans and Centauri are more or less incompatible<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , he apparently didn't feel limited by mere anatomical details. Technology is a wonderful thing. It should be noted that other than the genitals themselves, human and Centauri women look identical. Other Narn occasionally poke fun at him for it like it's a slightly embarrassing fetish.
    -   A scene (originally deleted) from the pilot movie indicates that there are guidelines restricting with which species humans are permitted to have sex. Speciesist? Maybe. But there are reasons...
        
        **Commander Sinclair**: I wouldn't. You know the rules about crossing species. Stick with the list.  
        **Man**: What are you, a bigot or something?  
        **Sinclair**: No. But obviously you've never met an Arnassian before. After they finish, they _eat_ their mate.
        
    -   The short-lived _Babylon 5_ sequel _Crusade_ reveals that human-Pak'ma'ra porn exists. Also, certain creatures living in hyperspace may try to mate with passing starships. According to J. Michael Straczynski, one of the Executive Meddling demands for the series that he turned down was that the show's "thief" character Dureena be turned into a "sexual explorer" whose official job would be this.
-   _Taken_: In "Beyond the Sky", the alien John has sex with Sally Clarke in her shed. Their son Jacob is conceived as a result.
-   In the backstory of _Tracker_ — most recently, Mel's grandparents.
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   Subverted (in the nick of time) during the sixth series when Lister is forced to marry a GELF (Genetically Engineered Life Form, a human-created species — there are no actual aliens in _Red Dwarf_) in exchange for a part needed to repair their ship. While his new orangutan-like bride seems very eager to consummate their marriage Lister resists as best he can before escaping under the pretence of needing to "slip into something more comfortable... it's called Starbug." This episode's basic plot was adapted for the third volume of the novel 'verse, _Last Human_. It took a very different approach in keeping with the generally Darker and Edgier tone of the books.
    -   Cat is eager to have sex and while he'd prefer another _felis sapiens_ he's not above hitting on human women or a pleasure GELF. The crew finally encounter what appears to be a female _felis sapiens_ in season XI and Cat immediately starts hitting on her. It's only after they've had sex that Cat finds out she was actually a Polymorph in disguise that was using him as a host for her eggs.
    -   Rimmer frequently fantasizes about meeting alien women and having sex with them but, as mentioned above, there are no aliens in this setting so he never gets to indulge in his desires.
-   Brought up briefly in _The Thin Blue Line_ during the briefing in "Ism Ism Ism".
-   The "bodily fluid" problem is a real one in _Alien Nation_, as the Newcomers' flesh is corroded by salty water, and they are a _lot_ stronger than humans. There are even formal classes would-be romantic partners can take in order to learn how to successfully copulate with each other. (In the sense the two participants safely achieve mutual satisfaction.) Played for Laughs when the male cop dating a Newcomer woman doesn't want to take the classes, and she, er, demonstrates their necessity. He comes into work the next day with a very _specific_ neck injury, which his Newcomer co-workers immediately recognize the source of (and remedy for).
-   _Hyperdrive_. Hilariously spoofed in the compulsory Instructional Film the crew has to watch before a First Contact mission. We don't see it (fortunately) but the crews' reactions to what they are watching indicate it would make even Captain Kirk think twice.
    
    "Let's learn about another **A**lien **S**ex **D**isease. This crewmember had intercourse with a Glygonthian octopoid. Let's take a close look at his genitals. Pustules have developed, and on the pustules: warts. Soon, his entire groin explodes, leaving five baby octopoids, each with his face. Remember, Alien Sex is Danger Sex."
    
-   In _First Wave_, Gua infiltrators frequently use sex to achieve their goals. However, the show never actually shows us true Gua. All we see are Half-Human Hybrid husks with Gua minds downloaded into them. Presumably, they're engineered to be compatible with humans. To their delight, human sex is very pleasurable, unlike the very painful Gua sex, so they are all to happy to "sleep their way to the top". Also, they deliberately engineer most of their husks to be attractive. However, most humans have no idea they're actually having sex with an alien.
-   In the sci-fi parody _Quark_, Ficus is ordered to seduce Libido so our heroes can escape. Turns out Vegetons mate by lying on their back with their limbs in the air.
    
    **Libido**: What now?  
    **Ficus**: It's simple. We wait for the bee.
    
-   Inverted in _3rd Rock from the Sun_, the Galaxy's ruler Big Giant Head (played by William Shatner) has sex with a human (played by Jan Hooks) and actually gets her pregnant. He has A Form You Are Comfortable With at the moment, his real looks is unknown.
-   _The Orville_:
    -   The series starts its first episode with the main character Ed Mercer discovering his wife Kelly cheating on him with a blue alien that he derogatory nicknames "Papa Smurf". It's later revealed that the alien is from a race that has a cycle of pheromones causing everyone they touch to feel sexually attracted to them and he causes this effect once again in both Ed and Kelly.
    -   Alara, the only Xeleyan aboard, has a history of failed relationships on the ship. The Season 3 episode "From Unknown Graves" would show just how dangerous a sexual relationship between a Xelayan and non-Xelayan can be through LaMarr and Talla (another Xeleyan, having replaced Alara in Season 2), which results in the former getting repeatedly injured during sex. By the end of the episode, they decide to break up before Talla accidentally kills LaMarr.
    -   Dr. Finn had a one-night stand with Yapheet and was in a steady relationship with Isaac.
    -   Bortus' ex-boyfriend Locar goes out with Talla, but it doesn't go any father than a kiss. According to Bortus, he once caught Locar in bed with another alien female. Locar, being a closet heterosexual, would have to engage in this trope, given that Moclans are an all-male species.
    -   Ed Mercer unintentionally engages in this, since his girlfriend Janel turns out to be a Krill spy named Teleya.
-   _Defiance_: A lot of Humans and Votans have little compunctions about having sex with each other, not to mention full-on relationships, including marriage. Some have children too.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   In "Small Potatoes" this is inverted. At first it looks like a woman has had sex with an alien. She has a child who has a tail and says that the child's father is from another planet. When Mulder and Scully investigate the case, they quickly learn that this woman is crazy about _Star Wars_, and that a mutant who knows her has simply taken the form of Luke Skywalker to become intimate with her.
    -   The eleventh season shows Jackson Van De Kamp. He was created through genetic experimentation, and much of his DNA is extraterrestrial. It is shown that he had two girlfriends. It is unknown if he became sexually active with either or both of the girls, but if so, they qualify for this trope, provided that half-aliens count as well.
-   _The Outpost_:
    -   Human man Janzo and Blackblood woman Wren quickly grow attracted to each other. After flirting, Wren proposes they "test" if in fact both their species have compatible genitals, as a "science" experiment. Which they do, and yes they're compatible. After this, they grow into a couple and even conceive a baby together.
    -   Talon (a Blackblood woman) and Garret (a Human man) finally become lovers too in Season 3.

    Music 

-   They Might Be Giants: The entire plot of the song "For Science" by exactly who you'd think would write a song about that.
-   The entire plot of the song "Rishathra" by filk band Ookla The Mok.
-   "E.T." has Katy Perry sing about being in love with an alien. The version with Kanye West makes it way more explicit.
    
    **Kanye**: _Tell me what's next, alien sex  
    I'mma disrobe you, then I'mma probe you  
    See I abducted you  
    So I tell you what to do!_
    
-   David Bowie's "Moonage Daydream" tells this story from the viewpoint of the alien Glam Rock messiah Ziggy Stardust.
-   Lady Gaga's "Venus" is a same-sex take on this trope.
    
    _Rocket #9 take off to the planet (to the planet)  
    Venus  
    Aphrodite lady seashell bikini (garden panty)  
    Venus  
    Let's blast off to a new dimension (in your bedroom)  
    Venus  
    Aphrodite lady seashell bikini (get with me)  
    Venus_
    
-   "Banned from Argo" plays this for laughs. Yes, the captain has to be extracted from group sex with five different species (and gender) of alien. Yes, the head nurse commits Black Comedy Rape on the first officer. Yes, the helmsman's plants grew out of control and seduced the governor's wife. These are only a _few_ reasons the crew in question got kicked off the planet.
-   Implied by Charlie's "Spacer Woman", in which the titular character, a female alien with a warbling voice, attempts to seduce the (presumably human) listener.
    
    _I'm a spacer woman  
    Don't you worry 'bout me  
    I don't want to hurt you  
    I just want to love you_
    

    Pinballs 

-   Heavily implied in the _Star Trek Pinball_ table "To Boldly Go", where the playfield is dominated by a leering James Kirk surrounded by a half-dozen wary women.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Trinity_:
    -   The Coalition (a group of alien species) are another reverse example, as their goal is the acquisition of fresh genetic material... including through sex. They _rape the human first contact team to death_, try to do the same to the group that comes to check what happened to said team and are later observed doing it to a native alien population on a planet they've just taken control of.
    -   The d20 version plays it straighter, with sexual contact considered a normal method of interaction between species in the Coalition's home region of space. The human first contact team gets raped to death unintentionally, but second contact goes well, with no sexual interaction.
-   _Sentinels of the Multiverse_: Aliens and humans have regular interactions throughout the non-Earth parts of the galaxy, and the writers have admitted that this means a lot of interspecies "activity". Of the characters with in-game decks, Captain Cosmic is more likely to _date_ aliens as well as sleep with them, while Greazer Clutch and K.N.Y.F.E. will both do anything that approximates their preferred genders.

    Video Games 

-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   The exotophilia, near-universal biological compatibility, and empathy of asari probably smoothed out first contact with the salarians to no end ...and the turians, later ...and the humans ...and the krogan ...and then, and then, and then... In fact, inter-asari relationships producing children are discouraged and the children of such relationships are given the slur "purebloods". "Pureblood" asari have a small chance of turning out to be Ardat-Yakshi. It's mentioned in flavor text for Tevura that asari have always been exogamous, traveling far from their origins to find mates in order to prevent inbreeding. This makes anti-pureblood sentiment and preference for nonasari look a lot like aversion to incest, and raises the question of whether Ardat-Yakshi parents tend to be related.
    -   The series actually deconstructs this trope somewhat. Not only is alien fetishism a frequent topic of discussion within the game's universe (and not just from a human's perspective), but many sexual pairings have to take caution because their bodily fluids are physically toxic to each other, as Mordin points out should Shepard enter a relationship with Garrus.
    -   Yeoman Kelly Chambers wholeheartedly endorses the boldly coming approach.
        
        **Kelly**: \[...\]intimacy brings understanding.
        
    -   Even the Illusive Man, Human Supremacist Supreme, isn't exempt from this trope. Amongst the data the Shadow Broker keeps on him is a list of TIM's Sexual Liasons. There are a lot of human supermodels and an asari matriarch (twice). Averted in the case of his minion Kai Leng, who in the books finds all aliens physically repulsive and considers the asari "whorish".
    -   Grayson, one of the major protagonists of the _Mass Effect_ book series, takes an asari lover in the third book and, after a particularly wild night with her, wonders _how he would ever go back to humans_. Also, keep in mind that this coming from a man who once actively _hated_ aliens.
    -   After Shepard and Grunt (a male krogan) take down a Thresher Maw in the course of the latter's krogan rite of passage, Grunt receives a number of breeding proposals from female krogan... and so does Shepard, even if Shepard is a woman.
    -   Tali also seems to have a touch of xenophilia; she's a viable love interest for a male Shepard, and if you don't hook up with her, she'll eventually end up in a relationship with Garrus, and during the Citadel DLC she's willing to entertain the possibility of a threesome with herself, female!Shepard, and Garrus. She also notes that an in-universe movie called _Fleet and Flotilla_, about an inter-species romance between a quarian and a turian, "jumpstarted" her puberty. However, turians and quarians have similar dextro-amino body chemistry; not only can they have sex safely, but they can consume the same food, drink, and drugs, so pairings between the two races are not unusual.
    -   The existence of the magazine _Fornax_, a publication dedicated to the finest in interspecies erotica, should tell you how this trope is faring in the _Mass Effect_ universe.
        -   It's worth noting that _Fornax_ is specifically a human printed publication. While asari may be the most common race to date outside their species (for obvious reasons), the series seem to portray humans as the next most likely to engage in xenophilia, and we don't have the same excuses the asari do.
    -   Mordin Solus (a salarian) is non-romanceable, but if the player goes long enough in _Mass Effect 2_ without starting a romance with someone else, he will misinterpret Shepard's friendliness as a come-on. When asked if this has happened to him before, he confirms that it happens _constantly;_ he's received propositions from asari, turians, and there is apparently a subset of krogan sexuality that finds salarians arousing.
    -   Javik claims that the Protheans did not "date" other species. They conquered them, enslaved them, sometimes ate them, but did not date them. Except for asari.
    -   However Half-Human Hybrids are _completely_ nonexistent, which is understandable given the troubles different pairings have in the first place. Even the asari technically reproduce asexually—a partner is necessary to stimulate her body into pregnancy, but the offspring is purely her own.
    -   From _Mass Effect: Andromeda_, the tradition's still going across galaxies. Some angara, who've been in an eighty year long invasion that's left them severely untrusting of aliens, find humans intriguing, and of course, the asari. An angara in their primary city can be heard complaining about how boring those humans are getting, then wondering where the asari are at (she likes the color blue is all). At one point, one of Ryder's teammates, an angara, speculates with Peebee - an asari - about cross-species romance. It's also possible to find "evidence" of at least one angara and one asari having done a little more than speculating.
-   _Knights of the Old Republic_:
    -   Over the course of both games, the possible romances include four humans, one Cathar, one Miraluka, and one Echani. (Fandom will also include the Zabrak tech for females...) However, one of the humans in the first game is the only pairing in which sex is confirmed to occur, the Echani looks just like a human (and is half-human anyway), the Miraluka is a human with no eyes.
    -   Miraluka and Echani are stated to be "near human," close enough to human for mating to work, but there are some genetic and culture differences due to thousands of years of adapting to their native worlds. The Cathar is a Gay Option, and definitely not in the near-human bracket.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ continues this legacy. The player character can be Human/Cyborg, Zabrak, Miraluka, Twi'lek, Mirialan, Rattataki, Sith Pureblood, Chiss, and later Cathar and Togruta. All of these races are Rubber-Forehead Aliens at worst, and all possible love interests and one-night stands are from the same set. None of them care which one your character is. They've presumably had millennia to work that out.
-   _Star Control 2_:
    -   It's possible to do this with Talana, the blue-skinned space babe. The game's ending has the player character settling down with her and having kids.
    -   It's implied that humans originated on Syra, then were transplanted by the Arilou to Earth and genetically-modified for some purpose.
    -   The Syreen in Star Control are this in general. Their planet was struck by a natural disaster later revealed to not actually be all that natural, and as the all-female Space Patrol were the vast majority of Syreen offplanet at the time, most of the race's survivors are female. They need males of other species (mostly humans) to keep their race going. Mars Needs Women inverted.
-   _Stellaris_:
    -   Species with the "Fertile" trait, a Biological Ascension Trait, have unnaturally high fecundity. When they are enslaved it is implied that they are being used as Sex Slaves, as the pops that own them get +10 happiness. Even when they are enslaved by another species.
    -   In Empires with the Xeno-Biology Ascension perk, added in patch 2.2, are species inhabiting it are interfertile with each other. This increases your empire's immigration pull, and occasionally results in the creation of hybrid species which have traits from both of their parent species.
    -   The Great Khan, who rises in Marauder Clans and wages wars of conquest across the Galaxy, is sometimes killed by a concubine. The event specifically states that the Khan is killed by an _alien_ concubine.
-   _World of Warcraft_: Mostly averted with the playable races with most cross-racial pairings falling under Interspecies Romance instead of this trope. There are the Steamy Romance Novels (collectible ingame items) however, where a paladin named Marcus takes a "tour" of the species of Azeroth. Also for some reason, goblin males find orc women exceptionally hot.
    -   Unlike a lot of examples the lack of Bizarre Alien Biology is explained here. All the playable races are descended from creatures made by the Titans: so of course they are compatible physiologically. However it doesn't seem like they are all capable of interbreeding. Of course, that is hardly going to stop people from getting it on, it could even be seen as a bonus.
-   _Destroy All Humans!_:
    -   In the backstory, the Furons arrived on Earth thousands of years ago and did this with the humans, to the point where nowadays, every human being on Earth has some Furon DNA. Later, the Furons return to Earth to harvest the pure, uncontaminated DNA from the humans in order to save their species from radiation-induced sterility.
    -   Crypto also does this with Natalya at the end of the second game, and is heavily suggested as doing this with an assortment of random women ever since getting his genitalia back. In _Path of the Furon_, he explains that, of all the species the Furons have subjugated, humans have the hottest females.
-   _The Sims_:
    -   Staples of the series since _The Sims 2_ have been aliens and alien abduction. Sims have a chance of being abducted by spaceships while stargazing at night. When they return in the morning, male Sims will often end up pregnant.
    -   Sims also have the option of romancing any aliens who may be living in their neighborhood, which is the only way (without any mods or hacks) for female Sims to be impregnated by them.
-   In _HuniePop_, Celeste Luvendass is a Secret Character for this very purpose.
-   One of the most extreme examples is the indie erotic RPG _Teraurge._ After being pulled through a portal into an alien world, the player character finds themselves the only human in a world where half the species aren't even _remotely_ humanoid, but the majority don't let this interfere with their sexual freedom. While some are relatively close in general shape (being at least bipedal), potential lovers include a four-armed insectoid woman with a chitinous green exoskeleton and a triangular head with no visible eyes, a large caterpillar man with six pairs of limbs, a colony of wormlike creatures with a single Hive Mind that looks like a large worm with small limbs covered in barnacles, _two_ separate sea serpent-like females with no limbs whatsoever (and in the case of the latter, no eyes or ability to communicate verbally, despite clear sentience), and another insectoid woman who looks like a long-necked beetle with pretty blue eyes and hooked fingerless hands, with whom intimacy is very dicey owing to her skin being covered with a nausea-inducing contact poison. It's a weird game alright.

    Webcomics 

-   Dmitri from _Spacetrawler_ has made it a personal goal to experiment with any alien which is "at least 50% compatible". 50% compatibility covers quite a range of bizarre alien biologies thus far: Shuar is insectoid, Dal has eight stubby limbs and a face full of tentacles, this lady looks like she's part plant, Choan has a worm-like head and gills (albeit with a suspiciously humanoid figure), Haldeyis is an ambulatory glowing barnacle, and he was last seen having a drunken roll in the hay with the Eeb Red-9.
-   In _Loon Land_ the alien Lana Loon lands on earth and has a close (failed sexual) encounter with the terrestrial loon Mike Moon \[1\].
    
    **Mike**: Hang on! You've got like five holes down here! Which do I poke it in?  
    **Lana**: All of them.
    
-   _Grrl Power_:
    -   If Deus' Little Black Book is anything to go by, he not only qualifies, he's doing so systematically - and has pre-written entries ready ahead of time for particular species, and in some cases, particular individuals. This would also explain his fascination with Maxima, since he knows that the source of her powers is extraterrestrial. This led to the following conversation with Big Bad Sciona:
        
        **Sciona**: How well traveled are you... a Draugr? Ew!  
        **Deus**: Not one of the gross zombie grunts, of course. An elite Draugr Lord. Lord-ette. Lordess?
        
    -   Sydney, stranded off-world, manages to hook up with Frix, a dog-like alien species named "Woof". "Human" sounds as funny to him as "Woof" does to us.
    -   When aliens give Sydney a ride home, they encounter a bunch of reporters, who are _trying_ to be paranoid and ask intelligent questions, but keep getting Distracted by the Sexy.
        
        **Sydney:** This invasion is going well.
        
    -   Cora tells the press that all of Earth's entertainment is going to be quite popular on the galactic stage, _especially_ their porn. Later, a porn actress squeals at the thought of aliens watching her work, and then gives an intelligent summary of how an exponential increase in audience will affect the industry.
-   In _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_, aliens threaten the Earth with destruction unless they are provided 100,000 human slaves as mates. It's a Secret Test of Character to see if the humans will sell out or protect their own in the face of a perceived threat. Instead, the UN post the request to a fetish site and exceed the quota in _minutes_ with willing volunteers, to the confusion of the aliens.
-   In _Cthulhu Slippers_, Mal wonders over lunch and a _Star Trek_ fanzine what Captain Kirk would make of actual Eldritch Abominations. Sim immediately has an Imagine Spot of Kirk saucily eyeing a gibbering mass of teeth and tentacles wearing anatomically-improbable lingerie and lipstick.

    Web Original 

-   A great many memes about the satirical proposed 2019 Area 51 raid dealt with this idea, namely that female aliens trapped inside Area 51 would reward their rescuers with coochie.
-   _Three Worlds Collide_ features a First Contact scenario between humans and two other sentient spacefaring species simultaneously. One of these, dubbed "Super Happies", takes this trope and runs with it — _all_ their communication, both among themselves and with other species, is having sex. It seems that evolution decided that, while one transfers genetic information, all sorts of other information might be traded as well.
-   Inverted and played straight in a 365 Tommorows story. In this case, the ones having carefree sex are the Sybaris, the alien species that the humans came into contact with. It's played straight by the human delegation to the Sybaris.
-   According to SF Debris, this is Starfleet policy:
    
    **Captain Picard**: Son, as a Starfleet officer, I'm afraid you have no choice but to take that beautiful alien aside, and bone her twelve-ways-from-Sunday. It's part of the duty when you put on that uniform—that you'd have to take it off again to satisfy the endless lust of four-breasted aliens. Make the Federation proud! Make me proud!  
    **Tom Paris**: Aye, aye, sir, I won't let you down!  
    **Picard**: Lieutenant? Make it so.
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Futurama_:
    -   Zapp Brannigan aspires to do this, but is just so bad at it.
        
        **Zapp**: We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end, is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars?... Kif, I'm asking you a question.
        
    -   Ironic of him to ask Kif that question, since Kif also ended up making it with a hot, alien babe, namely Amy Wong. Which means _she_ filled this trope, too. As did Leela, when _she got Kif pregnant_ (accidentally; don't ask). In fact, Zapp is the only one of the four who _hasn't_, despite having built his whole life around trying (he sleeps with Leela, who he thinks is an alien, but she later turns out to be a human mutant).
    -   If the Amazonian women are aliens and not just giant humans, then Zapp did make it with a significant number of hot alien babes.
        
        **Zapp**: Ladies, please, the spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
        
    -   Fry as well, to a lesser degree. He's also bad at it, but that's because he's Wrong Genre Savvy. He's been known to mistake mundane (for the future, at least) objects for alien beings. At one point he made out with a radiator, thinking "she" was an alien ambassador from the "Radiator Planet".
        
        **Fry**: Is there a burn ward within ten feet of here?
        
    -   Lrrr, Ruler of the Planet Omicron Perseii VIII, did this accidentally after separating from his wife Ndnd and going through a mid-life crisis. He hooks up with what he takes to be a hot Omicronian woman, but afterwards learns that she was a human in costume (it seems some humans are into this sort of thing), and she thought _he_ was actually a human as well. Lrrr is horrified that he slept with a human, but the girl is still into it.
-   Maxwell Tennyson a.k.a. "Grandpa Max" from the _Ben 10_ series has dated at least one literal Green-Skinned Space Babe and later married an Energy Being who is also the mother of his sons and, through them, the grandmother of Ben and Gwen.
    -   It's later revealed that humans are universal breeders and have reproductive compatibility with many sapient alien species throughout the universe. According to Kevin a significant portion of the human race carries alien ancestry (especially the descendants of Plumbers), with some (like Ben & Gwen) not even knowing before ending up in The Unmasqued World.
-   How did _Steven Universe_ come to be? Well, that involves a little story he likes to call "The Ballad of Greg and Rose." It started with a young man playing through his concert like a comet and a mysterious 8-foot tall woman in the audience. He was a talented rocker who wanted to make it big. She was the leader of a group of sentient gem aliens with physical forms made out of light who protected the Earth. Their chance encounter gave birth to a beautiful love and, later, a beautiful son...
-   The Galra Empire in _Voltron: Legendary Defender_ has ruled most of charted space for thousands of years, so it feels kind of natural that a ton of interspecies mingling has apparently happened in that time. This has led to a decent percentage of the Empire's population being hybrids; they're generally accepted, but there are traditionalists who think that hybrids shouldn't be allowed in the military. Note that the Galra take this trope so far that one of the main characters (Keith) is the product of a Galra secretly meeting and hooking up with a guy from Earth, before official first contact between the Galra and humanity has even happened. Even the heir to the Galra throne, Prince Lotor, is half-Altean.
-   Although it's never happened in the movies yet, Star Wars canon seems to suggest that relationships between humans - or the species that is referred to as "humans" - and Rubber-Forehead Aliens are fairly common. _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ has confirmed that humans _can_ produce viable offspring with Twi'Leks, who seem to be the most common example of this trope for some strange reason. Not surprisingly, Anakin Skywalker has something of a reputation for this, as shown when he flirts with the queen of the Zygerrians. Then there's the relationship between Lux Bonteri (a human) and Ahsoka Tano (a Togruta).
    -   Interestingly, the way that human/alien hybrids in the galaxy actually _turn out_ is somewhat inconsistent. An episode of _The Clone Wars_ featured the children of a Twi'Lek mother and a human father, who had their mother's head tails but their father's human-ish skin tone, while _Star Wars Rebels_ features the offspring of another male human and female Twi'lek, who looks like a normal human except for his vivid green hair.
-   _Rick and Morty_
    -   Throughout the series, Rick has had a _lot_ of sex with women of various alien species, including a Hive Mind (Unity) and a _sentient planet_ (Gaia).
    -   While it's offscreen, The Stinger to "The Ricklantis Mixup" mentions that Morty got to have sex with a mermaid.
    -   The subplot to "The ABC's of Beth" revolves around Jerry dating a Krutabulon warrior priestess named Kiara, and his struggles with wanting to break up with her. Rick offhandedly reveals in The Stinger that he ended up sleeping with Kiara.
    -   An interesting example occurs in "Rattlestar Ricklactica"; after accidentally killing an alien snake, a guilty Morty decides to send an ordinary Earth snake to the alien snake's planet in its place. The rest of the alien snakes quickly find out that the snake Morty sent is not from their planet, and when a scientist snake tries interacting with the Earth snake, the Earth snake proceeds to have sex with him.
-   The titular character of _Johnny Bravo_ is indicated to be open to hooking up with alien women in "Bikini Space Planet" and "Third Dork from the Sun".
