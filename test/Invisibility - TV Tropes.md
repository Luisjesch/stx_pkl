— **Queen**, "Invisible Man"

One of the more frequently reused science fiction ideas in TV, after putting people in spaceships, is turning people invisible. In addition to the frequent appearance of invisibility as a one-use trope in both serious and comedic programs (see Invisible Main Character), it has been the central premise for a number of programs.

Invisibility is often coupled with themes of isolation and alienation, as the invisible character's ability marks him an outcast. The original Invisible Man became a sociopath because of his condition. In many of these series, the character is permanently invisible, which strains normal personal ties.

**Some coping mechanisms for permanent invisibility:**

-   The 1958 series hero could do no better than to bandage his face.
-   In the 1975 series, David McCallum's character was rendered visible via a Latex Perfection mask.
-   The _Gemini Man_ had a small, fragile device which held his invisibility - and the certain death it brought with overuse - at bay.
-   Alexa Hamilton used flesh-colored Body Paint, a brunet wig and contact lenses.
-   The invisible man of the film of _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ uses a full-length coat, gloves, sunglasses, a hat and white makeup applied to his face (which, by happy coincidence, allows the actor to use his real face in close-ups).

It is also interesting to note that the overwhelming majority of shows with invisibility use the same setup: The person is the product of a government experiment, usually military, and becomes an agent for a top secret government anti-crime task force. While this setup is not limited to this power, the fact that the two are so often coincident probably leads to a lot of Recycled Scripts. Expect newly invisible characters to make a point out of realizing that they can't see themselves.

**Invisibility is such an old trope that there are multiple ways to be invisible. Many of them still require a Hand Wave.**

-   Transparent organs. Non-organic matter cannot become transparent. Mind you, invisible eyeballs result in blindness.
-   Bending light around an object. This allows clothing and other material near the object to become unseen as well.
-   Not reflecting light visible to the human eye, or altering the reflected light into a non-visible wavelength. Ultraviolet and infrared are examples in Real Life. Some animals can see these wavelengths.
-   Removing the light source so that no light is available to bounce off the object. But see Hollywood Darkness. Or just hide in the shadows.
-   Absorbing any light that falls onto it. Rarely used because, while you can't see it, you will see the lack of light.
-   Perception Filter. A specific person or persons cannot see the object only because _their_ perception has changed. Other people can see the object normally. The alteration can be a Jedi Mind Trick but can also be a mental block the person suffers. Maybe the object is Invisible to Normals.
-   Magic, if the setting allows for it, can write off the logical issues surrounding the person's clothing and ability to see while invisible, but if Magic A Is Magic A, these might still need to be addressed.

Implied nudity is another recurring element: Regardless of the invisible character's sex, clothing is seldom affected. Indeed, fans of this trope as a storyline have coined two different terms for invisible women: FFI (or "fading femmes invisible") for women whose clothes go invisible with them, and TFI (or "true femmes invisible") for women whose bodies vanish but whose clothes do not. A third term, CFI ("Clear Femmes Invisible"), for characters such as Oar from _The League of Peoples 'Verse_, who are visible but translucent, has also come into usage lately.

It may be interesting to note that whatever the parameters of the invisibility — permanent or non-permanent, affecting clothes or only the body, voluntary or involuntary, these will usually be taken as the "obvious" properties of invisibility, without any need to explain why they should work according to those rules instead of one of the other permutations. (Note for example the opening monologue to the Sci Fi Channel's _The Invisible Man_, which cites the H.G. Wells story, but implies that character's invisibility was non-permanent and voluntarily controlled.)

Permanent, involuntary invisibility is usually treated as either Cursed with Awesome or Blessed with Suck depending on the story.

Note that most of the works mentioned herein are more "cynical" shows; invisibility as the power of a Superhero, such as _Space Ghost_, is generally at will and free of angst. It may be a Personality Power, with the user shy and retiring, or sneaky and subversive.

Invisibility is also a recurring device in TV commercials, selling such diverse products as jeans, feminine deodorant and alcoholic beverages.

May or may not become an Invisible Jerkass or an Invisible Introvert. Often comes with drawbacks. Invisible Monsters are another Sub-Trope.

See Visible Invisibility to show way producers use to achieve this effects. For when the clothes/armor/equipment are the ones who provide invisibility, see Invisibility Cloak. When everything _except_ the clothes/armor/equipment is invisible, see Invisible Streaker. Astral Projection frequently renders the projected invisible. Characters based on chameleons may have this ability.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Kobushi, or as she calls herself, Blackfist, from _Tokyo ESP_ has this as her main power once the glowing fish entered her. Notably, her invisibility powers allow her to also make whatever she's carrying - such as clothes, weapons, a pair of shades - invisible with her, allowing her to wear clothing at her leisure. It's the perfect power for her, considering her love of boxing and how no one sees her attacks coming.
-   Teana of _Lyrical Nanoha_ has the ability to turn herself or her teammates invisible as an extension of her Illusion abilities. Garyuu has the ability to cloak themselves.
-   Deconstructed and played straight in Kazuhiro Okamoto's manga, _Translucent_. Shizuka is a typical 14-year-old girl; she just happens to have _Translucent Syndrome_, which makes her body turn translucent during a semi-regular cycle — although it is affected by her mood (and can become permanent if she spends too much time translucent). While she never goes outright invisible per se, there's little enough difference between 100% invisibility and being 99% translucent. Indeed, she uses her condition to sneak into a building later in the series by simply leaving her clothing with a friend.
-   The Laughing Man in _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ has no esoteric superpowers, but he can effortlessly hack the brain/eye cyborg implants of anyone who's watching him and remove his image from their field of view. This makes it impossible for anyone with implants to see him, and since basically everybody in the GITS universe is cyborged to some extent, this makes him invisible for all intents and purposes. He can also edit people's memories while they are watching him in case they _don't_ have artificial eyes. But they have to have an artificial brain for him to edit their memories, and if they have one of those it's unlikely that they don't have artificial eyes (e.g., the two hobos who see him whose memories he can't erase).
-   The titular Alabaster in Osamu Tezuka's _Alabaster_ is partly invisible, as the raygun he used on himself to attempt to become invisible was unfinished and lethal. Disgustingly disfigured (the only thing invisible is his _skin_; his organs are fully visible), he is obsessed with defacing "beauty" with the gun — leaving partly invisible corpses in the wake of his murder sprees. Playing the trope more straight, Ami, Alabaster's hostage turned mistress turned partner-in-crime, was shot by the gun in the womb, and has been invisible her entire life.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   The Thriller Bark arc introduces a member of the Quirky Miniboss Squad, Absalom, possesses this power via the Suke-Suke Devil Fruit ("Suke" means to be see-through), enabling him to turn himself or anything he touches<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  invisible. He's also perfectly well aware of and happily exploits his abilities' Power Perversion Potential. After the Time Skip, Absalom was killer by the Blackbeard Pirates and the Clear-Clear fruit ends up being pass to Shiryu.
    -   Sanji later gets his hands on a super suit that allows him to have this ability.
-   Invisibility is a clan-inherited power for Bouquet in _Blue Dragon_, as she points out while sneaking into an alley to switch it on in one episode.
-   Sarah Gallagher from _My-Otome_ has this as her GEM's secondary power.
-   Momoko of _Saki_, who is described as having zero presence. When she doesn't want to be found, she will disappear from your sight even though she's sitting right beside you or had just been chatting with you a moment ago. Her anti-presence extends to her voice and even to her discard pile, so other players won't notice if she had called Riichi or had thrown the Mahjong tile they needed to win. However, if her opponent completely ignores everyone's presence in the first place, this ability of hers won't work on them. It's noted that this is only a mental invisibility. Characters using video cameras of the game to watch can see her and her discards just fine, and wonder why her opponents are playing into her moves that should be clearly apparent.
-   Genma Saotome of _Ranma ½_ created a technique that renders him invisible and Ranma later learned the style himself. While training to use the basics of the style, Ranma was able to steal the floorboards out from underneath the house. Said house was filled with various martial artists of various skill levels and none of them noticed anything until it had already happened.
-   Soga Keena from _Demon King Daimao_ has the apparently innate ability to turn invisible (and fly), but the invisibility does not extend to her clothing. Luckily she lacks any sort of nudity taboo, so whenever she gets into trouble her first instinct is to shuck her clothes and fly away invisibly. Frequently the invisibility fails for one reason or another and she ends up flying around naked for everyone to see.
-   In an anime filler episode for _Fairy Tail_, Lucy is turned invisible by an expired magic potion she kept in her house after she put it in her bath. To be fair, the potion is seven years old. She hasn't touched it since because of Tenro Island.
-   In _My Hero Academia_, Toru Hagakure has this as her power, which leads to her spending most of her time in the nude when she's fighting. She can't turn it off, even if she's sleeping or unconscious. Eventually, it was revealed that her power can "glitch" in very stressful situations, causing her to become partially or fully visible, something that happened twice in the manga. It's been shown her quirk/superpowers aren't limited to just being invisible all the time; she has also been shown to be able to refract and intensify light after some Training from Hell in a class trip. An omake in which her classmates try to find out what her face looks like reveals that her parents are also invisible.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Shizuka Joestar from _Diamond is Unbreakable_ has invisibility as her Stand ability, which she can also use on her surroundings within a certain radius. Unfortunately, being a baby, she has no control over her Stand so its powers just amplify whenever she's frightened.
    -   In _Stone Ocean_, Sports Maxx's Stand has the power to revive the dead as invisible zombies.
-   In _Dragon Ball_, Yamcha fought against an invisible man, and only won because of Roshi's nosebleed from seeing Bulma's breasts covering him with blood and revealing his location.
-   In _Dragon Ball Super_, another invisible opponent appeared, and was defeated this time when Gohan covered him in dust from the damaged arena, making him visible.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_: This trope is one of the few things known about one of the mysterious entities that emerges when Touma's right hand/arm is cut off. It has remained consistently invisible in every appearance, so its true appearance is unclear, though when covered with blood or dust, it looks like a dragon's head.
-   Akira from _Toumei Shounen Tantei Akira_ is a detective who can turn invisible under his clothes, including a mask and gloves, which he uses to help him investigate cases.
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_, the Blitz Gundam has the "Mirage Colloid" system, which is a special gas that can envelop the Mobile Suit in special reflective particles that render the machine invisible to most sensors. The Astray Gold Frame inherits this system when the Blitz's cut off right arm is added to it in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray_. The _Girty Lue_ in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_ also uses this function.
-   The Conductor from _Galaxy Express 999_ would eventually revealed to be an invisible alien, with his uniform hiding this fact and the shadow from his hat being the source of his face, along with the only way his eyes could be revealed. As soon as his hat is ever removed, he appears headless.
-   _After God_: An IPO is not picked up by cameras and even secondary methods like a smoke bombs are ineffective. Witnesses describe them as mirages, and you have to look at them directly to see them.

    Comic Books 

-   "The Bod", a four-part story in Image Comics' _Double Image_, follows Kelly Gordon, a sexy blue-eyed blonde who enters show business and becomes invisible due to spilling hydrated resin on herself. Her newfound fame takes her from _The Tonight Show_ to _Jerry Springer_ to _Judge Judy_.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In _Supergirl_ story _The Death of Luthor_, the eponymous villain concocts an invisibility serum to escape from prison.
    -   _Legion of Super-Heroes_: Invisible Kid I & II. In almost all of the various incarnations of the Legion, I-Kid invents the invisibility serum basically out of boredom. It's only in the Post-Zero Hour: Crisis in Time! reboot that I-Kid was working for Black Hole, an Earth government spy agency, when he invented it. In the 2004 reboot, he found out that his father had been having him make it to give to the Science Police, hence he's alienated from the rest of the Legion, except for a few others.
-   _Fantastic Four_: Susan Richards, the Invisible Woman. She bypasses the blindness problem by being able to detect cosmic radiation outside the white light spectrum. She later learns how to make other things invisible. For example, she once defeated Doctor Doom by making a mountain invisible and tricking him into flying into it.
-   In the 70s when Phantom Lady joined the Freedom Fighters, she gained this power. She also took on a role very similar to Susan Richards in the Fantastic Four.
-   Kim Suskind from _Planetary_, one of the Four (who are a takeoff of the Fantastic Four). She can turn invisible, but to be able to see while invisible she has to wear special goggles. It's unclear why the goggles work either, but at least they made some effort.
-   One of the many powers of the Martian Manhunter and Miss Martian. In _War World_ J'onn turns invisible to catch Mongul by surprise.
-   _Empowered_ has this as one of her minor, useless powers: Her suit can turn invisible. Her body can't, just her suit. It's largely just another example of her near-constant Clothing Damage. That said, it did play a role in her Moment of Awesome at the end of the fourth volume. She turned her suit invisible to make the villain think she was naked and helpless, then attacked him when he dropped his guard.
-   Mary Zero, from _Deadpool_ spinoff _Agent X_ had the mutant power of psychically blanking out her presence for almost anyone, and anyone who did manage to register her soon forgot she existed. The fact that the titular Agent X, due to an advanced healing factor, could both see _and_ remember her, Mary fell madly in love with him. Hilarity ensued.
-   The Military Medic from _Sturmtruppen_ at one point becomes obsessed with the invisibility elixir. When he believe to have drunk one, he starts to run around naked, believing that no one could see him.
-   Disappearing Trix, a character in British children's comics of the 1980s, is a cute blond schoolgirl who becomes invisible by blinking.
-   Speedsters such as The Flash in The DCU are able to vibrate their bodies so fast that they can't be seen. This solves the clothes problem because their costumes vibrate too. Of course, they can run beyond/near the speed of light, so they can just be invisible by running.
-   Empty Vee in _The Intimates_ has invisibility as her natural state; it takes intense concentration for her to turn visible, and she's always at least partially transparent even then. Thankfully, her invisibility extends to her clothes.
-   The Ghost from _Strikeforce: Morituri_ had an advanced form of invisibility; he was undetectable to everything short of psychic powers.
-   Blindside of the DCU's Relative Heroes has the ability to turn invisible and is descended from the Golden Age hero the Invisible Hood who had the same powers.
-   In Milo Manara's _Butterscotch_ (_Il Profumo dell'invisibile_, aka _The Parfum of Invisibility_), there is a sweet-smelling body-paint which makes the wearer invisible. This being Milo Manara, there's a lot of fetish material.
-   The title character in _Il Ragazzo Invisibile_.
-   Wraith from X-Men has permanent invisibility as his mutant power... sort of. It only extends to his skin, meaning that his muscles and part of his skull are always visible. He also has the ability to temporarily extend this "power" to anyone he touches.
-   Mister Bones, former Infinity, Inc. villain turned government agent, appears as a walking, talking skeleton, but in truth it's just that his skeleton's the only part of him that isn't permanently invisible.
-   _Ultimate Spider-Man_: Miles Morales has camouflage as one of his spider powers. Depending on the Artist, it either acts like actual camouflage or it just makes him completely invisible.
-   An animated episode of _Spirou & Fantasio_ has both an invisible man and an invisible woman. Apparently, their invisibility was caused by contact with a meteor that landed in their city, and the antidote is a potion extracted from mushrooms.
-   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Saturnians can use their telepathy to hide their presence visibly and audibly, and usually use their variation on an Invisibility Cloak to improve the effects. This doesn't work very well on Diana given her own low level telepathic abilities.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Invisible Scarlet O'Neil_, a strip created by Russell Stamm and published from 1940 to 1956, was one of the earliest superheroines in comics, predating Wonder Woman by a year. Scarlet was accidentally hit by an ray her father had invented, which turned her invisible. She later discovered that by pressing a sensitive nerve on her left wrist she could turn visible and invisible at will.
-   _Scary Gary_: The Invisible Man is completely invisible, and gets mistaken for a self-driving car at one point.

    Fan Works 

-   _Irreversible Damage_: One of the Magic Potions turns drinkers invisible, including their clothing. Greg believes that this can be reversed with water, such as with a shower or rain, but it turns out that that only works in cartoons. Chirag turns himself invisible by drinking one of the potions, and while he's pretty upset over this at first he eventually comes to enjoy the ability to do whatever he wants without getting caught.
-   _Transformers Meta_: Barricade can "cloak," or make himself invisible.
-   In _Aeon Natum Engel_, the use of cloaking devices (normally limited to Mechas and Mages, and thus is revolutionary for being compact sized and not magic dependent) by the Replica Assassins is one of the reasons for the fall of Iceland.
-   Paul in _With Strings Attached_ can boost his minor cosmetic illusion into full-blown invisibility. He cannot use this on anything except his own body. He can turn it on or off at will. And he's an Invisible Streaker.
-   _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_:
    -   Nearly everyone is invisible to Ringo when he uses his mindsight because everyone is masked. He does manage to compensate somewhat by focusing on the dust people stir up in the air and the skin flakes and hairs they shed.
    -   Several of the ambushers at “Hermit's Rock” turn themselves invisible, but since John can both hear them and sense the water they contain, it's useless.
    -   Spectrem can turn himself invisible.
-   In an omake for _Make a Wish_, Harry's mad scientist friend's henchgirl gave Harry a potion that was supposed to make him turn invisible, but didn't work on his skeleton. When he asked what he was supposed to do until it wore off, she suggested pointing at people while staring at his watch.
-   This is the shtick with the Inviso Bombman, from _Calvin and Hobbes III: Double Trouble_.
-   In the Naruto AU _Invisible Fox_, a pre-Academy Naruto gets hit by a lightning bolt while trying to perform an invisibility technique. Said bolt overcharges the technique to the point that it's permanent, causing him quite a few problems including sleeping as his eyelids don't block the light. The author has provided explanations for how Naruto can see as well as taking many of the problems into account.
-   In _Lulu's Bizarre Rebellion_ Lelouch's stand, Painted Black, can turn anything in a dark enough area invisible. It is precise enough to let him relay instructions to Zero (who, due to the clandestine nature of Painted Black's power, is not Lelouch but rather Shirley) by writing on the inside of their mask.
-   _RainbowDoubleDash's Lunaverse_: Trixie Lulamoon:
    -   One of signature abilities. She explains in one fic that while there are several different kinds of invisibility spell, the one she uses works by causing her body to not interact with light.
    -   When Zecora poison jokes her, she briefly becomes not only permanently invisible, but inaudible and unable to touch anything other than her friends. Attuning to the Element of Magic reverses this effect.
-   _Seventh Endmost Vision_ has a rather surprising character who can do this: Yuffie, who combines it with Intangible Man powersets as Yuffie the Transparent- which is a hell of a surprise, given that she initially appears as just a teenage waitress Cloud knows!
-   Empath of _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ is shown on a few occasions to be able to psychically cloak himself (and at least one other person with him) whenever he sneaks around.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _The Incredibles_, Violet (who, as one of several homages to the _Fantastic Four_, is also a Barrier Warrior) can turn invisible at will except for her clothes. However, the Invisible Streaker trope is totally Averted: when Edna Mode makes costumes for the family, she makes one for Violet that turns invisible with her.
-   In _Igor_, you have Carl Cristall, the invisible TV show host who wears all other clothes except pants of any sort, since he realized there was no reason for an invisible man to wear such.
-   One of the funniest gags in _Monsters vs. Aliens_ is the fate of the invisible man in the monster prison. "He had a heart attack... in _that_ chair. He's still there." He does make an appearance (as much as someone who's invisible can be said to appear) in the DVD short "B.O.B's Big Break".
-   In _Hotel Transylvania_, one of Dracula's friends is an Invisible Man and is named Griffin, as in the novel, _The Invisible Man_. He wears glasses often, which convey his emotions as if they were actually eyes.
-   La Muerte and Xibalba from _The Book of Life_ can make themselves unseen from the eyes of mortals.
-   _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_: Miles can turn himself invisible, apparently from the radioactive spider's camouflage abilities. It's originally the only power Miles can semi-reliably control, mainly activating when he's feeling afraid or dejected.

-   Two direct-to-video _Invisible Mom_ movies starring Dee Wallace Stone.
    -   These movies had a Spiritual Successor, _Invisible Dad_, but the titular father uses his powers only to thrust a mop at people and beat some guy up in a bathroom, then steal his suit. It's less wacky than you'd hope for in an invisibility-based comedy.
    -   A copycat movie, _Mom's Outta Sight_, starred Melissa Williamson.
-   The 2000 horror movie _Hollow Man_.
-   _Mandroid_: Late in the movie, it's revealed that Ben is becoming invisible as a result of being exposed to frozen Supercon.
-   Parodied in the _Mystery Men_ movie, where the Invisible Boy can become invisible only when no one is looking at him. Including himself. It was proved, however, that if those conditions were met, he could actually become invisible (allowing him to elude purely mechanical surveillance).
-   _The Invisible Man_, a 1933 film based on H. G. Wells' novel, staring Claude Rains.
-   In _The Amazing Transparent Man_, a criminal gains the power of invisibility in a science experiment, which has several dangerous side effects. He also has little control over his new ability.
-   Also, the movie _Invisible Agent_, which has dialogue so bad it was parodied by Cheech and Chong.
-   Completely and humorously averted in _Amazon Women on the Moon_, where the mad scientist drinks his invisibility potion, removes his clothes, and starts going around pulling "invisible" stunts such as messing with the dartboard in a bar, and completely ignorant of the fact he is perfectly opaque.
-   _Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man_ was different in that the invisible man was not a government agent, but a boxer wrongly accused. His girl was the daughter of a doctor experimenting with invisibility. He (the boxer) took the invisibility serum to give himself the chance to clear himself of the murder charge. And before that, a different Invisible Man makes a cameo (non)appearence at the end of _Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein_.
-   In _Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd: Out of CONTROL_, the film centers on the efforts of Bruce and Lloyd, two CONTROL scientists, to retrieve a stolen invisibility cloak prototype. The cloak can be defeated by ordinary polarized sunglasses.

    **Wonder Woman:** Did you feel something?  
    **Invisible Man:** I don’t know, but my ass hurts.
    

    Literature 

-   Older Than Feudalism: One very early example is the Ring of Gyges in Plato's _The Republic_.
-   The trope in its current form began with H. G. Wells' novel _The Invisible Man_.
    -   The titular man is the scientist Griffin, who manages to invent a way to make himself invisible. It involves him being an albino and bleaching his blood (no pigment or colour to reflect light), and using some machine that reduces the refraction of light as it passes through his tissues. Wells himself admitted that this method would prevent light from being absorbed by the retinas and therefore the invisible man would have been _blind._
    -   Griffin also creates an invisible cat, in which the reflective tapetum of the eyes (the layer that make them seem to "glow" in the dark) remain visible.
-   One story in Tove Jansson's _Tales from the Moomin Valley_, "The Invisible Child", features Ninni, a girl who "was frightened in the wrong way" by the woman who took care of her, causing her to turn invisible. As she stays with the Moomins and regains her self-esteem, she gradually becomes visible again.
-   In _Castle Hangnail_, Molly's one piece of inherent magic that she can do without any external aids is that she can turn invisible for as long as she can hold her breath. The effect includes anything she's wearing or carrying.
-   In _Hurog_, Oreg is invisible to most characters. Apparently, he chooses to, though there are family legends in Ward's family about people who were able to see the "ghost". It is unclear whether Oreg chose to be visible to those people, or something else is the cause for it. He seems to voluntarily become visible to Ward's younger sister Ciarra. Apparently, most of his "owners" wanted to keep him a secret, but over the time Oreg developed a dislike for humans, anyway. (Considering that he can see what is going on anywhere in castle Hurog, he has likely seen a _lot_ of the worst side of mankind.)
-   In one _The Dresden Files_ book, while on one case, Harry makes a potion that makes him unnoticeable. This turns out to have interesting benefits making it better than classic "invisibility".
-   Donna MacMeans' 2008 novel _The Trouble with Moonlight_, set in Victorian London, features Lusinda Havershaw, a gentlewoman thief who becomes invisible during a full moon. Naturally, it doesn't affect Lusinda's clothing or anything on her person.
-   In the _Invisible Inc._ series of children's books, the main character Chip turns permanently invisible after falling into a mysterious lake while exploring a cave. As a result, the clothing he was wearing when he fell in the lake is invisible as well, but any other outfits he wears are visible. This allows him to sneak around as a Kid Detective without implied nudity. Unlike most examples, after the first book Chip makes no attempt to conceal his condition, and his classmates accept it as no stranger than his best friend's hearing impairment. (Aesops about accepting diversity and finding unique advantages in a disability are had by all). Notable for clever, non-angsty speculation about the challenges of living a normal life while invisible (lack of facial expressions, Chip's frustration when his friend can't tell that he's sticking his tongue out he resorts to using emoticons to express his feelings)... and for creating fairly detailed and consistent properties for Chip's invisibility without getting bogged down attempting an explanation (anything that got wet in the lake is permanently invisible, nothing becomes invisible on contact with Chip, food is visible going down Chip's throat but disappears when it reaches his stomach, Chip's dog is invisible except for his tail because he followed Chip into the lake but his tail stayed dry, no one ever visits the mysterious lake again).
-   The young adult novel _Things Not Seen_.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Extraordinarily _real_ characters such as Death have a sort of invisibility: They're just _so_ visible that people's minds can't take it and end up not recognizing they're even there.
    -   There's also Mr. Shine in _Thud!_, a troll made of diamond who can regulate the reflectivity of his body, making himself quite hard to see.
    -   Granny Weatherwax has the ability to become invisible by simply making people not notice she's there. Trainee witch Tiffany Aching manages to pick up on this trick, to the envy of her peers.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   The eponymous character has an Invisibility Cloak that he inherits from his father. The fifth book has Moody performing a Disillusionment Charm on Harry, a camouflage spell that makes him perfectly mimic his surroundings. And in the first book, Dumbledore mentions that there are different ways to become invisible (to imply that he was spying on Harry.)
    -   In _Deathly Hallows_, the methods for invisibility are listed (mental aversion, perfect camouflage, and a special cloth that quickly loses its potency.) This is important because Harry's cloak uses none of these methods. The cloak is one of the Deathly Hallows, either made by Death himself or by a legendary wizard. Nobody noticed it until the seventh book, probably mistaking it for one of the everyday kind that wears out quickly.
    -   Multiple methods of achieving invisibility were first alluded to in _Prisoner of Azkaban_, which mentions _The Invisible Book of Invisibility_ — the bookstore owner is not a fan ("Cost a fortune, and we never found 'em!").
    -   The Weasley family car also has an "Invisibility Booster" to keep Muggles from noticing it flying. We have yet to get an explanation as to where it came from.
-   In _The Lord of the Rings_ the One Ring turns whoever wears it invisible. Prelude book _The Hobbit_ introduces the Ring as nothing more than a ring of invisibility, and an imperfect one at that — shadows are barely visible in strong sunlight. Its full history was invented for the sequel. The One Ring makes its wearer invisible by partly shifting him into the wraith world - the Nine have the same effect on their wearers, and when, say, the Witch-King has his final confrontation he is seen to wear a crown but "on no head visible was it set", but Frodo and the Nazgûl could see each other very well on Weathertop. Tom Bombadil could not be affected in that way, but Isildur, a Man of Númenórean descent, could be; it just didn't prevent orcs from tracking him by scent and the trail he left through grass, and it slipped from his finger as he swam across the River, leaving him visible to be slain by archers.
-   Robert Cormier plays this for as much horror as possible in _Fade_.
-   _Pumuckl_, the kobold protagonist of a German children's series, is invisible, unless he gets caught by a human (which includes him getting stuck to a glue pot). The kobold laws state that Pumuckl has to stay with said human if this happens, which is how the series starts. Many stories are about Pumuckl being in danger of being seen by someone else but Eder, which would mean that he had to leave Eder.
-   The psychic power known as "plateau eyes" in Larry Niven's _Known Space_ series makes people effectively invisible by forcing other people to ignore them.
-   The 2012 novel _Calling Invisible Women_ by Jeanne Ray involves a woman named Clover who has become invisible, both literally and metaphorically. Her clothing is still visible, but her husband and children consider it an Unusually Uninteresting Sight.
-   _Perry Rhodan_ introduces its light-warping "deflector fields" (not to be confused with Deflector Shields) early on as a feature routinely included in Arkonid space suits. They only affect the generally visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum — one protagonist is spotted early on by simple 70s _radar_ where he didn't expect it — and their emissions can themselves be detected by suitable sensors, so they're good primarily against cameras and the standard Mk I eyeball. (Still good enough that when hostile aliens who generate these fields _naturally_ show up later in the series they cause a lot of trouble until suitable countermeasures can be put into mass production.) The use of mind control powers to get others to ignore the user and possibly his or her friends is also featured, but less frequently since those powers are rather less common in the first place.
-   David Eddings' _The Elenium_/_The Tamuli_ novels features three shown types of invisibility, used by different people depending on their talents and preferences: Perception Filter, bending light, and time-trickery that works because the responsible god doesn't realize that it shouldn't work.
-   L.E. Modestitt's _Saga of Recluce_ books feature two variants: Order magicians can create a pattern of energy that passes the light through them, making them literally invisible. Chaos mages destroy the mental connection between seeing them and actually noticing they're there. Either spell lights you up like a beacon to casters of the opposed alignment, concentrating enough of the opposing power in one place that if they weren't your enemy before, they probably want to have a stern talk with you now. The order version also passes non-visual-spectrum light, handy when your primary enemies have an established love of the fireball spell.
-   _Kroniki Drugiego Kręgu_ has a mage caste called Illusion Weavers, who can use their powers to become invisible. This apparently doesn’t work on dragons, which see people currently under the spell as holes in the landscape.
-   Fritz Leiber's story "Stardock" from the _Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser_ series features invisible, but otherwise human-shaped, girls who ride invisible rays (as in fish) which swim through the air. They apply full-body make-up to render themselves visible to the heroes, which proves quite a treat for them (and it won't be the last treat they get from those two mountain-princesses).
-   Shadewalking in Shadow Grail uses the perception filter version of this. This allows students to sneak around, as long as none of the teachers with that gift are near by.
-   Ostraya, the Princess of the Country of Glass, is afflicted with this condition in _The Orphan's Tales._ There is a huge bit of Fridge Logic implicit — she acquired her invisibility by being caught outside during a rain of glass shards, and she says that as a result, her body is _made_ of glass. But the narrative treats her as if she is perfectly invisible, when simple common sense deduces that glass in the shape of a young woman would still be quite visible, by reflecting light and distorting the images of what's behind her.
-   A hobgoblin in _A Fantasy Attraction_ has the ability to go invisible. Another character, who can apparently still see him, complains it gives him an eyeache.
-   In the _Mr. Men_ books, this is one of the impossible things Mr. Impossible can do; all he has to do is concentrate hard enough, and he becomes invisible. ("You try it," said the narration, "it's impossible!") This comes in handy when Mr. Small enlists his help for the plan to make Little Miss Naughty start behaving herself; Mr. Impossible turns himself invisible and tweaks Little Miss Naughty's nose whenever she is about to wreak havoc.
-   _Somewhither_: This is Foster Hidden's ability. He can also create a special zone with his magical arrows to make others within invisible.
-   This seems to be the first power gained in _The Accidental Superheroine_, with additional powers only being unlocked by listening to a particular suite of music.
-   In _The Balanced Sword_, Xavier Ross has the ability to make himself invisible (not only to the naked eye but also to all forms of magical detection) and intangible.
-   In The Wall and the Wing by Laura Ruby, this is what the protagonist Gurl gets instead of the ability to fly.
-   In _Below_, higher doses of an invisibility potion mean longer duration, after which the drinker will fade slowly back to normal. It includes the Required Secondary Powers, affects objects carried or worn by the drinker, and even the light and smoke from their torches is hidden from others.
-   _Goosebumps_:
    -   The book _Let's Get Invisible_ has the protagonist and his friend find a mirror on his attic which can turn them invisible. However, if they use it for too long they get sucked into the mirror, and their reflections come out to take their place. (Yeah, kind of a weird setup there.)
    -   _Revenge of the Invisible Boy_ is a more traditonal one. The protagnist tries to use a potion he found to make a bully invisible, but he ends up drinking it instead. He first has fun pulling pranks but eventually tries to find an antidote.
-   One _Ghosts of Fear Street_ book has the protagonist and his friend accidentally summon a girl with magic powers, who grants them twelve hours of invisibility to prove that she's legit. They spend a good chunk of it playing pranks on some of the nastier kids from school.
-   Invisibility in the _Lord Darcy_ stories works not by literally making people or objects transparent, but by magically re-directing observers' gaze away from its subject. This means that people who know about this effect and are on the alert for it can sense that something they're not seeing is nearby, based on where they're _not_ looking.
-   In _Renegades_, the superhero Dread Warden can turn invisible, along with whatever he's wearing and any small objects he's holding.
-   _Princesses of the Pizza Parlor_: From _Princesses Don't Play Nice_, as part of Princess Isabel Cœur de Lion Solaire, who, before a few edits, was effectively a Wonder Woman expy who had:
    
    flying unicorn mount, the bridle of invisibility
    
-   _The Tough Guide to Fantasyland_: Several kinds exist, usually provided with a magical device.
    -   A spell that makes people ignore you.
    -   Being rendered transparent. Here, bright lights and shadows will give them away.
    -   True invisibility, the rarest kind. It will still not stop you being detected by sound, smell or touch though.
-   _Bruce Coville's Book of... Nightmares_: Merlin uses this to avoid his Abhorrent Admirer in _Master of the Hunt_. Later, Cai and Arthur use his disappearing powder so they can sneak up on a stag, but they wind up getting chased by the Wild Hunt, which mistakes them for ghosts. Merlin, incidentally, can see them just fine when they return and try to get his reappearing powder.
-   _Dragonvarld_: Among many other illusion spells is a simple one which makes the caster invisible. It does not stop sound though, and the illusion can be broken if anyone so much as sneezes, so it's viewed as a weak spell. The dragon army is powerful enough to keep their entire force rendered invisible, but that takes many casters working together.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Out of Sight_ a 1993 British TV series about a boy genius that finds a magical formula for spray-on invisibility.

-   _The Invisible Man_, a Sci-Fi Channel series running from 2000 to 2002. This is one of the few shows that Hand Wave away the fact that invisibility should cause blindness: It's said that though the "quicksilver" that makes Darien invisible bends all visible light around him, it lets in (and frequency-shifts) ultraviolet light which allows him to see.
-   The alien Tosk from the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "Captive Pursuit", can do this. It'd later become the signature ability of the Dominion's genetically engineered foot soldiers, the Jem'Hadar. Apparently, there were plans for the Tosk to have been similarly created by the Dominion, but mention of that never made its way into an episode.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   "Excelsis Dei" deals with the case of a nurse raped by an invisible attacker (akin to the famous case of _The Entity_ as apparently there are many reported cases of women attacked by invisible men). Scully mentions that a common theory to explain this is the victim's subconscious erasing the image of the attacker from her memory. It turns out that the attacker is one of the elderly men that the nurse have to care using Astral Projection thanks to a special fungus.
    -   "Unrequited" features a character who can cause those nearby to develop a wandering blind spot between himself and the viewer's retina.
    -   "Je Souhaite" has a character making a wish (to a Genie) to be able to turn invisible, by will. He forgets to ask that his clothes turn invisible as well, and then gets killed moments later while crossing the road.
-   _Heroes_:
    -   Claude has this as his superpower. While the condition is not permanent, he appears to have chosen to remain continuously invisible for years, in order to hide from his former employers. Peter Petrelli picks up the power from him, and it seems to be one of Peter's favorites once he gains some degree of control over his abilities. His name is an obvious reference to Claude Rains, the first actor to play the Invisible Man.
    -   The show also introduced a minor character named Becky who also has the ability. She uses it to torment Claire as part of a revenge plan against Noah Bennet for killing her father when she was a child.
-   Ea in _Toumei Shoujo Ea_ is made more or less permanently invisible against her will by the villains of the series, although it's not perfect several things will cause her to become semi-visible against her will, including bright light (like the sun getting reflected off a mirror), electricity (like a stun gun) and physical contact these do not make her outright visible, but instead cause her modified skin to do a "predator-style" CGI thing (making her look like she's made of blue or red glass). This has the bonus effect of giving her a good excuse to stay naked the entire series, although the hero and titular Ea rather quickly realize that uncontrollable invisibility kinda sucks and so curing her is the main plot of the series. Ea's modesty was apparently also affected by the invisibility formula, as she doesn't react to her nudity the entire series. (However, the hero and his girlfriend most definitely _do_.) The camera doesn't react either, outside using clever camera angles, random objects, and lens flares to hide anything _too_ much for 2 a.m. TV. Yup, you guessed it, most Japanese writers are male.

-   In the _Doctor Who_ episode "The Face of Evil", the normal trope of invisible eyes still somehow being able to see is averted. The invisible monsters are blind.
-   An early episode of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, "Out of Mind, Out of Sight", involves a girl who was ignored so often she started turning invisible. It later turns out this is a common malaise, and government agents have started a special school for these students to use them as invisible assassins. Joss Whedon has said (on "The Chosen" special collection extras DVD) that this was his first "experience" with Buffy; it was the first idea he ever had that made it into the show. Buffy also briefly becomes invisible in the Season 6 episode "Gone", when the Nerd Trio accidentally zap her with their invisibility gun.
-   Jacob in _Lost_. Ben brings Locke to Jacob's cabin and begins having a violent, one-sided argument with an empty rocking chair that Jacob is allegedly sitting in; his voice even cuts off several times as if Jacob is interrupting him. This is all very amusing to Locke, who deems Ben insane and proceeds to start leaving...until someone who isn't Ben says "help me" and all hell breaks loose. During the ensuing temper tantrum (during which the chair's invisible occupant throws Ben against the wall), a shadowy, ragged, long haired figure can be seen sitting in the chair for a split second, after which Locke bolts out the door.
-   In _Misfits_, socially inept young offender Simon, who has been alienated and marginalised since his childhood, develops the "power" to turn invisible whenever he feels particularly ignored and rejected However, when his power get reversed by a drug, he ends up becoming the centre of attention, implying that his power might not actually be invisibility, but simply a Perception Filter that causes everyone to ignore him.
-   _Mako Mermaids: An H₂O Adventure_: Invisibility was the first power revealed that the mermaids from the previous series didn't have. A look into Zac's point of view while invisible showed his vision clouded by what looked like the water's surface, implying that the merfolk use water vapor to cloak themselves.
-   The _Supernatural_ episode "Wishful Thinking" has an invisible kid (among a few other things) due to a real (evil) wishing well. The kid wished for it purely so that he could peep in the ladies' locker room. Late in the episode, he gets hit by a car (he lives), but it's unclear whether this is due to the kid's bad luck or the well _causing_ the bad luck to happen.
-   _Stargate SG-1_:
    -   In "200", the team reveals that at some point Jack O'Neill was turned invisible. He used it to, among other things, spy on Carter in the shower. Apparently, he didn't want to give it up.
    -   "Show and Tell" features the Reetou, an alien race that are naturally out-of-phase with normal humans and thus invisible to them. A faction attempt to communicate with the SGC using a genetically engineered child but they assume he's hallucinating until they happen to discuss the situation with their Tok'ra allies, who explain that the Reetou are real and the Goa'uld nearly wiped them out with weapons they developed that can render them visible. Later episodes show that the system lord Nirrti developed a personal Invisibility Cloak based of their abilities.
-   Near the end of the first season of _Sanctuary (2007)_, the team has to locate an invisible girl to find the MacGuffin to defeat the bad guys. The fact that she has to be naked to do so is frequently commented on and joked about. This gives the show a chance to Fanservice it up since the other female characters, while being very attractive, are always quite well covered up.
-   Tommy and Trent both have this as their Dino-Gem-induced ability in _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_. Neither of them use it a whole lot, but it came in handy when the former's actor was unavailable for a few episodes — they just render him unable to become visible again (_after_ he escapes from being stuck in his costume).
-   The ability of Night Man's cape as long as it is properly charged.
-   In one episode of _The Bugaloos_, The Bugaloos turn themselves invisible through the use of a magic wand.
-   In a episode of Sid and Marty Krofft Productions' _Dr. Shrinker_, B.J and Gordie turn themselves invisible by eating a strange fruit and they become visible again if they hold their breath.
-   When _Alphas_ delved into the idea of invisibility they focused on the notion of "blind spots". Their invisible girl can trick the eyes into thinking there's no one there. One of the side effects is that when she's caught and can't move, she remains perfectly visible.
-   A one-shot villain in an early episode of _Lois & Clark_, "I'm Looking Through You", has an invisibility suit. Lois maintains Arbitrary Skepticism throughout, until the evidence is so stacked against her that she has to move the goalposts:
    
    **Clark:** Think of it as the next stage of stealth technology. If you wore a suit made of this material, you would appear to be invisible.  
    **Lois:** Well, _that_ makes sense. The _appearance_ of invisibility is completely different from _real_ invisibility!
    
-   _El Chapulín Colorado_ has two episodes with the Invisible Man: "El hombre invisible es tan antipático, que nadie lo quiere ver" and "Yo al hombre invisible no lo puedo ver ni en pintura". The invisibility is caused by a weird experiment involving paint.
-   _Charmed (1998)_: "Sight Unseen" has an enemy demon named Troxa with this ability. His weakness is that cold temperatures slowly make him become visible, and since he can't feel cold, he doesn't notice if it is happening.
-   Many _Ultra Series_ monsters have this ability, but a few use this as their defining power.
    -   Neronga of the original _Ultraman_ goes by the Boss Subtitles "Transparency Monster". Its invisibility powers are gained from the creature's manipulation of electricity, thus it must consume electricity in vast amounts in order to remain invisible for long periods.
    -   _Ultraseven_'s first episode was "The Invisible Invader", whose title enemy was the alien invader Kuuru (sometimes Cool). However, Kuuru wasn't able to become invisible himself, rather it was his spaceship that gave Ultra Garrison such a hard time. Later on, a race of aliens called the Shadow had this as their own ability, which they used to carry out their invasion plan without being seen.
    -   The _Return of Ultraman_ episode "The Giant Invisible Monster from Outer Space" gives us Exactly What It Says on the Tin in the form a grotesque elephant-like creature named Sartan.
    -   One opponent of Ultraman Leo was the alien Vibe, so-called because his power was that he could vibrate his own body at such speeds that he could not be seen with the naked eye.
    -   The _Ultraman Nexus_ monster Golgolem was able to perform a variation of this. It didn't truly turn invisible, but was able to phase in and out of reality for the same effect, meaning it could still be detected, but it couldn't be hit by attacks.
    -   The mosquito-like Bugdalas of _Ultraman Max_ used this ability to sneak around DASH's base and drain the life force of prey without being spotted, despite growing to monstrous heights in a matter of hours.
-   _Odd Squad_: In "Now You Don't See Me", Odd Todd uses invisible ink to all of Odd Squad—except for Olive and Otto who were out of HQ at the time—invisible. Olive and Otto have to track down Todd and take back the revisinator gadget he stole, which is the only way to reverse the effect.
-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_: In "Afterlife", the aliens display this ability at the end, having watched the test completely unseen.
-   _The Amazing Extraordinary Friends_: The Invisible Ninja is part of the Carnival of Killers hired in "Quality Time". He (or she) appears to be permanently invisible, as the never become visible over the course of the episode.
-   _Pee-wee's Playhouse_: Pee-Wee renders himself invisible during a magic show. It's fun for a while, but the novelty wears out fast. And then he learns that the trick to render himself visible is in the second magic kit, which he has to mail a coupon for.
-   _Zero (2021)_: Omar discovers he can turn himself invisible, at first only if highly emotional, then later at will. Anyone who he touches will also turn invisible with him.

    Mythology and Folklore 

-   Ghosts, at least at times. Poltergeists especially tend to remain invisible at all times.
-   In Classical Mythology, the helm of Hades rendered Perseus invisible, allowing him to sneak up on and slay the gorgon Medusa.
-   Aleister Crowley claimed that as part of his mastery of occultism and magick ritual, he could make himself invisible at will. It was certainly recorded that he could abruptly turn up in a group or a social setting with multiple people present, and when people compared notes afterwards, nobody had a clear recollection of having seen him arrive until he revealed that he'd been present for some time. A charismatic and imposing presence like Crowley's, people pointed out, would normally be highly visible and hard to ignore. Whatever the truth of such stories, the published rituals of the Golden Dawn (Crowley's magical order) have a spell for "Donning the Starry- Mantled Cloak of Midnight", ie, becoming invisible. When the obfuscating magickal language is decoded, this appears to involve somehow supressing and switching off the ego of the magical practitioner - ie, dampening all the conscious and unconscious signals we give off that advise others we are nearby. The jury is still out on this.

-   _SCP Foundation_:

    Professional Wrestling 

-   _GCW Joey Janela's Spring Break 3 Part I_, April 5, 2019, featured a match between the good guy The Invisible Man and the bad guy Invisible Stan. (Meaning, there was nobody actually wrestling.) Referee Bryce Remsburg wore special goggles to be able to keep track of the participants. They were both announced as hailing from "Parts Unknown," with an "unimaginable" weight. Bryce counted pin attempts, and followed them as they fought into the crowd, and The Invisible Man actually did a 30-foot balcony dive, with the fans falling to the ground. Bryce actually took a _ref bump_, with Japanese comedy wrestler Kikutaro running in to make the save, until Bryce threw him out. A table had been positioned against one of the corners and it actually _broke_, leading to The Invisible Man winning. The crowd totally played along with it the whole time, as did commentators Dave Prazak and Denver Colorado.

    Radio 

-   The primary power of _The Shadow_ is his ability to "cloud the minds of men" — he cannot become invisible, but can cause anyone nearby to fail to see him.
-   _Journey into Space_: Discussed in _The World in Peril_. Lemmy speculates that the Martians may be invisible. Mitch describes this as "about the worst suggestion made to now."

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Anathema_: Shrouds (which includes the player characters) can become invisible at will with no cost or limit on duration.
-   _Chaotic_: A game mechanic, primarily used by Mipedians, that gives a creature additional abilities if they fight an opponent that doesn't have Invisibility. It's usually paired with Strike (your first attack deals more damage), Disarm (disables the opponent's Battlegear), or Surprise (skips the Initiative check and lets you attack first, unless the opponent also has Surprise).
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ has multiple invisibility spells.
    -   The previous edition Invisibility spell allows invisibility until the invisible person attacks — presumably only for game balance, as most invisible persons outside of D&D can attack and stay invisible. Of course, now, not only is the former second level AD&D spell a _16th_ level spell in D&D 4e, it's been suitably nerfed.
    -   In 5e, Trickery Domain clerics also get Invisibility as a 6th level Channel Divinity.
    -   Tasha's Cauldron of Everything allows Rangers to take "Nature's Veil" at level 10 instead of "Hide in Plain Sight"; the former allows them to turn invisible in combat as a bonus action until the start of their next turn. And unlike the Invisibility spell, attacking while invisible does _not_ break the invisibility.
-   _Hunter: The Vigil_: Amun's Water is an Elixir of the Ascending Ones that, when drunk, makes its drinker invisible. As this is true invisibility, not a mind-altering effect, it fools cameras and infrared tripwires the same as it does mortal eyes; particularly well-mixed doses also grant some protection from magical detection.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
-   _Shadowrun_ contains both the psychic mind-affecting and the light bending versions - a must for most mages in a game thats all about pulling heists.
-   _Space 1889_ has invisibility device of the bending-light version as a possible invention. Some distortion is visible, looking like heat waves.
-   _The World of Darkness_
    -   Both _Vampire: The Masquerade_ and _Vampire: The Requiem_ feature the Obfuscate Discipline, which is a form of mental invisibility or camouflage — it causes others to ignore your presence, or think that you're somebody else. Needless to say, it's a common feature of the Nosferatu.
    -   _Mage: The Ascension_ had its own version of this with the Occult merit. At one dot, people tended to lose track of you if you weren't in the room. At three dots, you were essentially immune to documentation and paperwork, as anything describing you became "lost" or "misfiled" pretty fast. At five dots, regular humans and most non-mage supernatural creatures lacked basic object permanence regarding you, forgetting you existed the moment their eyes left you. As with many things Mage, this had a frequently hilarious downside: unlike disciplines, merits can't be turned off. The first time players with high ranks in this merit needed to question a mortal about something, or rent a car or hotel room, they learned to regret it.
    -   _Mage: The Awakening_ has a few ways to become invisible: a Perception Filter with the Mind arcanum, true invisibility with Forces (which has the advantage of being able to block other forms of radiation as well), and natural camouflage with Life. Since this is the _World of Darkness_, some people in the Legion legacy<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  gain natural concealment by summoning an Abyssal entity to _consume and replace their skin_.

    Video Games 

-   _Banjo-Tooie_: In one of his boss battles, Klungo drinks a green potion to turn invisible, in an attempt to fool Banjo and Kazooie. The effects aren't failproof, however: From time to time, Klungo's position can be faintly noticed.
-   _Donkey Kong 64_:
    -   The third boss (Mad Jack) turns invisible when it's in the brink of defeat. He can still be spotted by his shadow, but the invisibility will also make it move much quicker, so Tiny has to move constantly to avoid being crushed and wait until the boss prepares the next attack so she can proceed to hit him one last time (with an energy field activated through a switch).
    -   Chunky Kong can learn an ability (Gorilla Gone) that allows him to turn his body invisible (though his clothes can still be seen) in order to make certain things appear, though he needs to stand onto a pad showing his face to use it.
-   _Sly Cooper_: This is one of the eponymous character's powers in some of his games; the player can use it while standing still, but not while moving (unless upgraded).
-   Microforum International's cell phone games include _The Invisible Man_, set in 1899 London, and _The Invisible Lady_, set in modern Los Angeles.
-   _StarCraft_:
    -   The Dark Templar severed their ties to their psionic brethren, as well as their ties to the visible world (the light-bending version).
    -   The Protoss Arbiter passively cloaks every unit around itself.
    -   Terran Ghosts and Wraiths are able to cloak as long as they have enough energy. In the sequel, Banshees replace Wraiths, and all three's portraits show them donning a mask in order to see when cloaked.
-   _Second Sight_ has multiple characters who use the mind-clouding variant, represented as transparency. Security cameras ignore it, and it can't be activated if someone's already looking at the user (unless that someone is you, anyways.) It also malfunctions if the user gets too close to someone else, and odd things can happen if someone sees footprints forming without anything visible to form them.
-   _Twisted Wonderland_: Chenya's unnamed unique magic allows him to render parts of his body invisible, which he uses to appear as a Flying Face.
-   _The ball_ can turn invisible in _Backyard Baseball_ via a powerup.
-   _City of Heroes_:
    -   There's the power pool set "Invisibility" which has Stealth, Invisibility and Grant Invisibility. The first slows you down and is only _partial_ invisibility, and the second keeps you from attacking.
    -   Superior Invisibiltity is power in the Illusion Control set. You go completely invisible, run full speed and can still attack.
-   _Killer7_: Kevin Smith's ultimate ability is to turn invisible to go undetected among the Heaven Smiles, which are usually very good at spotting any living being to attempt to suicidally kill them. Kevin's invisibility is further reinforced with his permanent silence (he never speaks and the noises he makes while running are very minimal).
-   Several _Mortal Kombat_ characters, such as Reptile and Smoke, have the ability to turn invisible, although it usually wears off when they are hit.
-   One of the scarier creatures of the _S.T.A.L.K.E.R._ universe has the power to turn everything - except its Glowing Eyes of Doom - invisible. Cue much spraying of its general direction with copious amounts of ammo.
-   In _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_ you can play as a Nosferatu. At first, you can only "cloak" standing still, but as you gain more levels in the discipline, you can start moving, running and finally attacking while invisible
-   _Touhou Project_:
    -   Sunny Milk of the three mischievous fairies has the ability to control the refraction of light. Common uses for this include rendering something invisible for the purpose of pranking, and making herself and her partners in crime invisible so they could flee when a prank goes wrong.
    -   The series also has Koishi, who is implied to have a form of this as an extension to her powers to manipulate the subconscious. If she wishes, she could simply have others not notice her, allowing her to, for example, casually walk up a mountain heavily guarded by Tengu without being detected.
-   _Halo_ features active camouflage, which makes the user (usually a Spartan, Elite, or Brute) clear/translucent; some versions are equipped, while others have to be picked up. For the player character, it is always temporary in its effects.
-   In _Marathon_, the camouflage doesn't just make the user appear as clear shimmers of light, but as a SHADOW! And if you get two camouflage powerups, you're incredibly hard to see with the naked eye.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   The series generally has this available in two flavors: The Invisibility effect and the Chameleon effect. This Invisibility effect makes the player character completely invisible for a set duration, but the effect ends as soon as the player performs an action other than simply moving. (Interacting with an object, attacking, casting a spell, etc.) The Chameleon effect offers a percentage of partial invisibility, making it harder for NPCs to detect the PC. The effect also does not end if the PC performs an action. Unlike Invisibility, Chameleon can be made a permanent effect via enchantments, and getting permanent 100% Chameleon—which makes the player fully invisible—is considered a Game-Breaker. (Both in the sense that it makes the game ludicrously easy, and in the sense that, if the effect cannot be "turned off", it breaks the game by making impossible to advance since you won't be able to interact with NPCs.)
    -   Invisibility is a spell commonly used by Tamriel's various vampire bloodlines. Whether it is an inherent ability or simply using the Vampire's enhanced abilities in the Illusion-school of magic varies. There are also vampire bloodlines who have the ability to _see_ invisible enemies as an inherent trait.
    -   The Ring of Khajiiti, a legendary Daedric artifact associated with the Daedric Prince Mephala, grants the wearer invisibility along with enhanced speed and silent movement. It is said that the Ring was stolen off the arm of Mephala by the legendary Khajiiti Impossible Thief, Rajhin, who used its powers to amp up his thievery skills.
    -   _Skyrim_:
        -   This is one of the "Agent of Nocturnal" abilities granted to Nightingales. It is a special power that will render them invisible for two minutes, but can only be used once per day.
        -   A variation occurs when encountering Falmer. Because they are completely blind and rely on sound to hear, having the Muffle enchantment on your gear or the Muffle spell makes it possible to walk straight in front of them without being "seen" at all.
-   Joachim of _Shadow Hearts: Covenant_ goes through a handful of different forms, one of which is Invisible.
-   The **Natural Camouflage** tonic in _BioShock_ allows you to remain invisible permanently, provided you don't try to walk or attack. Hacking is fine.
-   Female Night Elves in _Warcraft III_ can Shadowmeld at night if they stand still. This ability was extended to males as well in _World of Warcraft._
    -   Elven Sorceresses can cast an invisibility spell on allied units (but not sappers), carried over from _Warcraft II_ (where using it on a sapper killed it).
    -   The Orc Blademaster can turn himself invisible to move faster and do extra damage on his next attack.
    -   While no unit actually has it, there's an ability that allows a unit to attack _without_ breaking invisibility.
-   In _Battlefield Heroes_, Commando soldiers can use their stealth ability to become invisible from far away, making them able to sneak up on enemies with a knife, or snipe people from safe distances.
-   _Mass Effect 2_ introduces the Tactical Cloak for Infiltrators, also used by Kasumi, who has an attack based around it. It's very temporary and one particular enemy that doesn't rely on sight to get you can still... get you, but otherwise you can just run past your enemies. It seems to use a lot of energy as it can only be maintained at its longest for about 18 seconds.
-   The Spy from _Team Fortress 2_ has a wide variety of invisibility watches so he can get behind enemy lines. There's the default watch, where cloak drains when in use, but is regenerated when not-in-use or with resupplies. There's the Cloak And Dagger, which doesn't drain when you are standing still, meaning you could be perpetually invisible. Finally, there's the Dead Ringer which if activated when injured will turn you invisible, drop a fake corpse, give a fake death notifcation and reduce your damage taken by 90%.
-   In _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_, Quiet, the untalkative sharpshooter, is capable of rendering herself (and her clothes) completely invisible. This is thanks to a form of Toxic Phlebotinum: a special strain of the Vocal Chord Parasite she received after nearly burning to death in an earlier failed attempt on Venom Snake's life, one that is attuned to the English language. If she ever speaks in English, she could initiate a pandemic of apocalyptic proportions.
-   The Novistadors from _Resident Evil 4_ have _Predator_\-style camouflage by way of color change. Their glowing eyes are still visible, though, and they can't use it and fly at the same time.
-   _Dungeon Crawl_:
    -   There are a few sources of invisibility in the game. Being invisible can be pretty handy, since it makes you much stealthier and monsters have a hard time hitting you. Running into monsters that can turn or are just naturally invisible, however, is highly annoying at best and lethal at worst (though that's kinda par for the course for a Roguelike).
    -   One particularly notorious player-killing monster, Sigmund, has the Invisibility spell, which contributes significantly to his notoriety. As if he wasn't deadly enough to low-level players with his scythe and confusion spell.
-   _Minecraft_ has invisibility potions that makes only your skin vanish and not your armor. Monsters can't see you, but if you wear armor, they will spot you. In multiplayer servers, your name tag vanishes when you turn invisible, making PvP more intense.
-   Most with invisibility in the game _Minion Masters_ are of the Voidborne-Faction: The Shadow Welp, the Assassin and the Shadowfork. Further, the Scrat Sniper Styx goes invisible after a short time after shooting. Lastly, two Crystal Elf-minions can go invisible: The Veilstalker and the Mana Chaser.
    -   The Shadowfork can give invisibility to other Voidborne by killing an enemy minion.
-   _Dawn of War_: In the first two games, invisibility was a toggled ability that only served to move units undetected, ending whenever the unit attacked or was told to capture a point. From Dark Crusade onwards, invisibility became permanent, but every faction has multiple detectors to cope with it.
-   In _Paper Mario 64_ and its sequel, "Invisible" is a status effect that makes most attacks always miss the invisible one, and can also be bestowed in the field by Bow to avoid encounters (as well as pass through certain solid objects). Peach becomes invisible in the sequel, but her invisibility is granted by potion, and doesn't affect her clothes, so unlike Mario, she has to remove them in order to remain undetected.
-   _Ghost Recon: Future Soldier_ introduces "adaptive camo" in the second mission as its main means of stealth. It only affects the user's clothes and equipment, however - exposed skin and the ironsights on their weapons are still visible (though the latter is more so you can actually use them rather than due to any limitations to the tech), as is the user's shadow. It automatically deactivates if the user moves faster than a crouched walk (or at all in multiplayer), or if they're shot at.
-   In _Deus Ex_, thanks to bio-augmentations, you can have two different kinds of cloaking, anti-device and anti-human. You are free to attack as much as you like, but the duration of the cloak is very limited. There also are jackets granting invisibility of one kind or the other, which you can wear until they run out of batteries.

-   In the Hidden Object Game _Mystery Trackers: Raincliff_ and its sequel, _Raincliff's Phantoms_, the detective protagonist discovers that the abandoned town of Raincliff was once home to a family with a genetic disposition to invisibility. The first game's plot centers on how the family is connected to the disappearance of four graduate students The game's sequel has the detective return to Raincliff to rescue a kidnapped reporter and discovering that the town has been converted into an invisible colony of escaped criminals.
-   _Defense of the Ancients_ features several heroes that has temporary invisibility mechanics. However, Riki the Stealth Assassin is capable of permanently going invisible with his aptly named Ultimate "Permanent Invisibility". While he does reveal himself moments after attacking, he can easily catch his opponents off guard unless they bring items to counter him, like wards or Gem of True Sight (which newbies rarely carry, but pro players will carry it with gusto, mostly rendering Riki and other invisible heroes very vulnerable)
-   _Kingdom Hearts_: The recurring Vanish ability will temporarily make the player invisible, preventing enemies from targeting them.
-   In _Jak 3: Wastelander_, Jak gains a Dark Eco ability to turn invisible, allowing him to slip by the floating watchers in temples that activate traps.
-   The insecto-robot from _La Statuette Maudite de l'Oncle Ernest_ turns invisible in its spirit form.
-   In _Psychonauts_, invisibility is a psychic ability and turns Raz invisible for a short period of time.
-   _Sonic Adventure 2: Battle_ for the Nintendo Game Cube offers the possibility of breeding invisible Chao. These Chao are invisible except for their wings, emotions balls and eyes. You can get one if you breed any Jewel Chao with either a Shiny Yellow, Shiny Limegreen or Shiny Gray Chao.
-   _Final Fantasy Tactics_, Ninjas have the powerful react ability "Vanish". After an attack, the successful ninja turns invisible and can move without becoming visible. The computer cannot see or directly attack the ninja until they strike first. After that, they become visible and can be targeted like normal.
-   _Shounen Kininden Tsumuji_: Tsumuji gains an Invisibility Cloak to hide from sight and avoid light-detecting abilities.
-   The half-unreal Void Walker demons in _Nexus Clash_ have abilities that let them phase out of reality and become more or less permanently invisible, making them notoriously difficult to catch for anyone who isn't one of the few character classes with Scarily Competent Tracker abilities. The only thing that can top them is the underrated White Magic Advocate angel, who can anoint _everyone_ around them with invisibility potions to cloak a whole army.
-   _XCOM Enemy Within_ has two examples.
    -   The Seeker is an early game robotic enemy that cloaks when spotted. Its cloak is based on movement, much like the Archangel Armor's flight fuel, and has to be dropped before it can attack by either strangling a vulnerable soldier with its tentacles or shooting with its plasma gun; Battle Scanners and soldiers with Bioelectric Skin negate the cloak.
    -   Autopsying said Seeker unlocks the Mimetic Skin gene mod. It allows soldiers to become concealed by moving from an unobserved position (no enemies in sight) to a spot with full cover<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and unlike the cloak from Ghost Armor and Ghost Grenades, can last indefinitely and has unlimited activations; otherwise, it functions the same, down to the +30% Critical Hit chance when attacking and non-attack actions not breaking the cloak. Said cover doesn't have to be between the soldier and the enemy either, any full cover will do. If moving from an observed spot or to a tile where there's no cover to activate concealment, the soldier will be revealed before they start moving (after if using the grapple on the Skeleton and Ghost Armor). The drawbacks are that Mimetic Skin precludes the cloak granted by Ghost Armor and Ghost Grenades, and at 150 credits and 65 Meld, it's by far the most expensive gene mod in the game.
-   _Warframe_ gives this power to three of its frames:
    -   Ash, having a Ninja aesthetic, gains this with his Smoke Out ability, allowing him to escape enemy fire alongside stunning nearby foes, and an augment can let him cloak allies for a short period if they're close enough.
    -   Loki has a much quicker variant, and his augment muffles weapon noise from primary and secondary guns, allowing for a more stealthy approach.
    -   Ivara's Prowl does render her invisible, but also slows her movement speed to a crawl unless you roll everywhere. Its main use comes from its ability to steal items from unaware foes, including ammo, energy pickups and mods. Her augment allows her to pass through laser barriers that would otherwise be tripped by the above mentioned two, alongside a small increase in movement speed. She will need silenced weapons, as loud fire will break her cloak (which will reset itself, but that's usually long enough for foes to cotton onto her presence). For other frames, Excalibur Umbra's signature katana can give its wielder invisibility on a stealth kill, and for those part of a Dojo, one can replicate a blueprint for a stim that allows temporary invisibility. The Naramon focus tree used to have invisibility as an unlockable node, but recent reworks eliminated it.
-   _Wario Land 3_: The potions of Mad Scienstein give this, for passing through the eye doors.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_: Blue Moas are invisible to Link's eye until he collects the cross in Three-Eye Rock Palace. These Moas roam Old Kasuto and all parts of the Valley of Death (the pathway to the final dungeon), so getting the Cross will be crucial to defeat them easily.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_:
        -   The Magic Cape. Comes with invincibility, allowing you to walk on Spikes of Doom undamaged. Also good for hiding from enemies.
        -   Like in the first game, Ganon can turn himself invisible and shoot fire at Link. However, Link can nullify it by keeping the two arena torches lit.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_: Bongo Bongo can become invisible to the naked eye. The only way to see it when it turns invisible is to use the Lens of Truth. Though like other invisible enemies, it can still be locked onto.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass_: Crayk turns invisible, and can only be decamouflaged by shooting its eye with an arrow.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: Wizzrobes make themselves invisible while moving, only dropping their cloak to attack. However, they can still be attacked while invisible, and leave behind faint tracks while walking in the air.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Fate/stay night_ and its spin-offs, Saber uses her Noble Phantasm Invisible Air to use wind magic to bend light and make her sword invisible. This helps catch her opponents off guard as they normally cannot tell how long her sword is, and conceals the sword's identity. She has to drop the invisibility to use her sword's true power.
-   The illusion spell Invisibility in _Tyrion Cuthbert: Attorney of the Arcane_ allows the user to turn a target invisible, including themselves, for one hour. Whatever the invisible creature is holding or wearing is also invisible. Used by Beatrice to conceal the existence of Marrunath, her demonic familiar.

    Web Comics 

-   Yahtzee's old surrealistic webcomic _The Adventures Of Angular Mike_ has the the Invisible Hentai Girl character, who you can only tell is around whenever she wears her Sailor Fuku uniform, which she, given her name, rarely does for long periods of time. Yahtzee blatantly admits on the character description page that the main reason for her invisibility is his inability to draw animesque women, but he also makes note of the element of irony in giving the most oversexed he has ever done this trait.

-   Kali in _Enjuhneer_ was created as a joke on the "invisible roommate," but has since been explained as having eaten radioactive toast. In addition to her own transparency, any clothing she wears gradually and permanently becomes invisible, as does any dye she puts in her hair. (A Santa hat and a pair of White Gloves are immune to this, for reasons that have so far only been vaguely implied.) The author has mined a _lot_ of jokes out of the various rules and applications of this ability—for instance, Kali can hide items in an invisible messenger bag and pull them out as if from Hammerspace.
-   _Girl Genius_: Old Pluto Heterodyne decided his city needed a watch, but didn't want said watch mucking up the way Mechanicsburg did business and therefore made them invisible and impossible for normals to even remember interacting with. They could see each other, and some other constructs like the Jagers have no issue perceiving them, but most went mad from the isolation long ago and killed themselves with the only known one left in the watch being Chief Drozeki.

    -   Rham Ripa's legs were leached of their visual aspect in the same accident in which his son was killed. The edge where visible meets invisible is something he keeps covered with pants, but is apparnently jagged and lets his innards be seen.
    -   Queen Sonorie has a number of wright protectors who keep themselves glamored invisible, which means they catch a would be assassin by surprise.
