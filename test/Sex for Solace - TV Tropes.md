**Lauren:** It's just that the doctor part of me never shuts off, and I know that I’m merely acting out of transference of grief onto you. Wanting to have sex is a very common response to grief. Biologically speaking, the transference often helps move the pain. Sort of use it as something else. Turn it into something different. Something better...  
**Bo:** Yeah, I, um...I can see how...intimacy could do that.  
**Lauren:** It's in much the same way that a person who's having a heart attack often feels a sharp pain in the left arm? It's the brain's way of redistributing the pain so that it's not all...concentrated in one area.  
**Bo:** I love it when you totally geek out.  
**Lauren:** Can I sleep with you?  
**Bo:** Yes.

When a character has sex, possibly while drunk, in order to help them cope with (emotional) trauma from a recent tragedy.

Alice and Bob are two characters in a series who are extremely close; maybe they are in love, or maybe they are just close friends, but they are happy together… until Bob dies. Or leaves. Or is revealed to be lying the whole time. Regardless of the exact circumstances, the relationship is over and Alice is emotionally crushed. Does she begin to drink heavily or gorge herself on ice cream to wipe away the feelings or seek to end the pain? Nope, she goes out and finds somebody to spend the night with, and then finds somebody else the next night, and then finds somebody _else_ the night after that. These are not emotionally healthy relationships, nor do they count as "relationships" by any definition of the term; they are just a string of one night stands as she tries to cope with the loss.

Sex For Solace deals with any situation where a character, suffering from severe emotional trauma, acts out their own internal turmoil through repeated sexual experiences. The trope does not only limit itself to ended romantic or sexual relationships, but can also deal with the death or loss of a parent/child, the defeat of an ideal, or other such crippling events. The trope can be played alternately for laughs or for drama, depending on the general tone of the work and how Alice's attempts to gain a new sexual partner are portrayed.

Related to, and often the result of, Drowning My Sorrows. Might indicate that somebody is Off the Wagon in a different area. Contrast Ethical Slut, For Happiness, and Sex Is Good. Compare _or_ contrast Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny, depending on how the story deals with sexuality. Also compare Comforting the Widow, wherein someone takes advantage of an emotionally vulnerable person grieving the loss of their partner. Also compare On the Rebound where someone begins an ill-advised relationship after splitting up with their partner.

In Real Life, this is a common way of dealing with emotional trauma and PTSD. Needless to say, it can be a bad idea (though at the very least, it's better than drugs or alcohol or the like… maybe). That said, it's a somewhat commonplace reaction to **mass** casualty disasters, perhaps as evolution's way to encourage repopulation. Now that that's out of the way…

-   _Black Butler_: Beast gives in to Sebastian's seduction and has sex with him after Joker ignores her request to run away from their "father" and rejects her feelings for him. Sebastian uses her emotional vulnerability to coerce her into sex to "help" her with her pain, but it is really to get answers out of her.
-   Tamura from _Bokura no Hentai_ was abused as a child by an older neighbor. He repressed the memories until he lost his virginity. Tamura ends up becoming promiscuous, often trying to have sex with adult men and other male-assigned-at-birth members of the cast (including trans girl Marika). Even as an adult, he engages in strings of one-night stands and flings despite finding them unfulfilling, all traced back to his trauma from being assaulted at a young age.
-   In a twisted way in _Canaan_, the trope is Played for Drama with Hakko's sex scene with Santana's corpse, which takes place after she crosses the Despair Event Horizon when Liang Qi tricks her into killing him with her voice.
-   In _Ceres, Celestial Legend_, Aya offers herself to Yuuhi, looking for Sex for Solace for losing Toya. Yuuhi gives in at first, to the point of making out and both getting naked. However, right before going too far, Yuuhi snaps out of it after seeing Aya being clearly on the brink of tears. He then kindly rejects her, claiming that he loves her too much to take advantage of the situation.
-   _Citrus_:
    -   Really, any time when Mei becomes overly emotionally distressed, she would proceed to try to make sexual advances on Yuzu. While this is mostly because she is inept when it comes to processing her feelings towards her stepsister, Mei is often depicted as being shrouded by darkness. The worst case of this is in episode 2 of the anime where when Yuzu tries to extract some insight into how Mei truly felt about moving in with her grandfather, Mei lashes out at her, and pushes her onto the bed. She then proceeds to tear open her blouse and if there is any indication, she would've gone as far as to molest Yuzu had it not have been for Yuzu getting to her.
    -   In episode 6, after Mei learns that her father has no intent on returning to the academy, in her depression, she forces herself onto Yuzu. The expression that she makes before Yuzu slaps her is especially sinister. She also comments how she'll "be gentle" since it would be Yuzu's first time. That can be taken as a hint that Mei has done this before.
-   Subverted in _Code Geass_. Lelouch is depressed and going through a 10-Minute Retirement and propositions this to Kallen. She gives him a slap coupled with a Get a Hold of Yourself, Man! instead.
-   _Cross Ange_:
    -   This is part of the reason why Ange seduces Tusk in Episode 22 after learning he survived his Disney Death. At first she thinks his presence here is a product of Embryo pulling a cruel illusion trick on her, but she nevertheless wants to believe that the man she loves is indeed still alive and right in front of her. So she begs him to stay as she tackles him to the ground and strips down. Thankfully, there is lots of tenderness to be felt in what becomes Their First Time, and Ange is saved from her current Despair Event Horizon, renewed to fight one last time because Tusk is still by her side.
    -   A couple of episodes earlier, Rosalie tries to proposition this to Hilda since their crush objects (Chris for Rosalie, Ange for Hilda) haven't been heard from for some time, with no guarantee that they're safe. Rosalie is upset because Chris has joined Embryo, and Hilda is struggling with her unrequited crush on Ange. While they do attempt to start off, they ultimately realize they can't go past a heated kiss, and instead choose to have a heart-to-heart regarding their love interests.
-   Jeremy from _A Cruel God Reigns_ does this so often that he becomes a teenaged prostitute. Even after quitting this, Jeremy still tries to seduce Ian when is extremely upset or having a rough time coping. Lindon is the first to realize that Jeremy's actions are a poor method of coping with his issues.
-   _Denpa Teki na Kanojo_: Hikaru proposes this to Juu after she has been rejected by her true crush thanks to the Malicious Slander from the Happiness Club.
-   Ryo from the _FAKE_ series tells Dee he can "go ahead and do it" to him while in a depressed state. Dee answers with a slap with a Get A Hold Of Yourself Man out of anger, as he is Above the Influence and would never take advantage of someone who's head isn't on straight and vulnerable.
-   _Food Wars!_: In the final chapters, it's revealed that Azami Nakiri (Erina's father) had a one-night stand with an American woman when he was still a student, due to still being depressed over the disappearance of his dear senpai Joichiro Saiba. The result was the birth of Asahi, leaving him horrified when he learns he had abandoned a son.
-   In _Gravitation_, Yuki revealed he was raped when he was younger, leading to his preference for multiple partners male and female, as well as triggering his depression.
-   Kurumi from _Haou Airen_ engages once in this with her Fetishized Abuser's Number Two, Fuuron. Doubles as Intimate Psychotherapy since it takes place right after she explains her most recent troubles to him.
-   In _Inubaka_, Kanako began to go out late every night and bring strange men to her home to cope with her dog's death.
-   _Kaze to Ki no Uta_: Despite his apparent cruelty, Gilbert proves to be a tortured young man with a history of abandonment, objectification, and abuse. This is part of the reason why he sleeps around with male students.
-   _Legend of the Blue Wolves_: Jonathan and Leonard have a romance with each other and sex scene. It is these tender moments that they turn to for solace from their precarious lifestyle as they are in the middle of a war with aliens, and Jonathan is lusted after and then raped by Captain Continental.
-   Myung and Guld go through this once in _Macross Plus_, after she cries in front of him during a chat and begs him not to leave her alone that night, since she had been almost murdered and he was the one who saved her.
-   Subverted in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ by Flay, who takes advantage of a distraught Kira in order to allegedly comfort him with her body. It's actually a ploy to manipulate him in revenge for him not being able to save her father.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_:
    -   Implied to be a heavy basis for Misato and Kaji's relationship. Most sources show that Misato underwent a lot of psychological trauma after Second Impact, and the manga also illuminates that Kaji went through similarly difficult losses, so they both used intimacy as a means of coping with their pain.
    -   It's implied that Misato is offering sex to Shinji when he's depressed after Rei's demise in Episode 23. After Shinji rejects her advances, she concludes that she's more in need than he is for solace (Kaji having died a couple of episodes earlier).
-   _Rec_: When Onda Aka's apartment burns up along with all of her belongings and Fumihiko Matsumaru, a young office worker, she first met only a few hours ago, takes her in, she has sex with him out of grief.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_:
    -   Utena secretly suffers from suicidal depression under her tough prince exterior. She ends up in bed with Akio and in a brief romance with Touji, both of which she attempts to use to comfort herself, although the scene with Akio is so dubious she does not seem to like it in the end. She eventually ends up in a romance with Anthy, another girl, and she reveals her protecting Anthy was partly due to her own self-satisfaction but her relationship with Anthy does end up offering her solace, as they grow to love each other.
    -   It is implied that many of the admittedly dysfunctional cast sleeps around, partly for this reason. Touga and Akio in particular, though they also do so to further their own goals.
-   _Sakura Gari_: Souma had a traumatic childhood which included rape (due to his beauty) and afterwards he is so broken he seeks out multiple partners and continues to do so even after they die from having ties with him at the hands of his psychotic sister.
-   _School Days_: Almost every character is messed up or depressed and Everybody Has Lots of Sex or simply has romantically charged scenes. This notably occurs between Makoto and Kotonoha as well as Makoto and Sekai. Both girls have serious issues, and the romance and sex with Makoto help, until the plot thickens and Makoto's womanizing tendencies arise so things take a turn for the worse.
-   It's implied a lot that Shizuma did this with a majority of the girls at her school in _Strawberry Panic!_, as a way to cope with the death of Kaori, her first true love.
-   Touka and Kaneki's sex scene in _Tokyo Ghoul:re_ acts as this as well as Intimate Psychotherapy as they are both depressed and seeking solace but it is also an expression of their love for each other and Their First Time.
-   Almost happens between Yota and Moemi in _Video Girl Ai_, after she goes through a Near-Rape Experience and almost crosses the Despair Event Horizon. They end up hugging naked and crying.
-   _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_: After Haguro's death, Ryuuko just lost her mind, wandering on the streets and selling her body for sex to men in utter disbelief and despair now that she lost Haguro and couldn't get Inugami.

With the help of The Question, she manages to regain her emotional equilibrium, but when she needs to kill a young girl that Intergang had brainwashed into being a suicide bomber she is found drunk again and in bed with another woman. She herself admits that this is a pattern, and after every emotional trauma she either runs back to the bottle or into the nearest bed.
-   Anna, whom Katherine "Kate" Kane is dating in the first issue of her run on _Detective Comics_, claims Kate is using her as a rebound relationship.

-   _Fine Print_: Lauren has lots of casual sex to offset her depression and loneliness. This doesn't work.
-   Norman Osborn has sex with Gwen Stacy — yes, _that_ Gwen Stacy — soon after his son Harry is hospitalized for OD'ing on LSD.

-   One Alternate Character Interpretation of Starfire's behavior in _Red Hood and the Outlaws_ is that she's doing this when she propositions Roy Harper barely hours after they first meet. Apparently she was supposed to come off as an Ethical Slut, but instead, it came off like this.
-   In _Runaways_, Nico has a self-admitted tendency to throw herself at people in the aftermath of any stressful or traumatic scenario, although she does not progress to actual sex until well into the second volume of the series. She knows it is not healthy and is not fair to herself _or_ whomever she throws herself at, but she cannot seem to break the pattern. She _does_ break the pattern after Victor cheats on her with Lillie, deciding to let him go in the hopes that Lillie will make him happier. In the 2017 relaunch, she impulsively tries to kiss Karolina, despite Karolina already being taken.
    
    **Karolina:** Why do you always do this?  
    **Nico:** I don't know...

He ended up getting her pregnant, forced to marry her only for the survived Alt!Shepard to show up with her own big stomach. And this was just the first in a serial of disastrous events that came later, all because Alt.Garrus decided to seek this trope with the wrong person (despite knowing said person has an ulterior motive).
    -   Later Alt-Garrus slept with Shepard in the hospital to help them calm down after their son's incident with Garrus's current wife, Perdita.

-   After Shinji gets some troubling news about Yui's motivations in _Ghosts of Evangelion_, Asuka decides to take his mind off it this way. At this point in their relationship this was a rarity for them, and he ended up feeling even worse when he realized that she hadn't really been in the mood.
-   In _Gold Poisons_, Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue had an encounter like this during the Sunshot Campaign. It was Jin Guangyao's fault, as he'd written a letter warning Xichen he was in danger and Xichen has a hard time processing it. Both feel like they've taken advantage of each other.
-   After a few bottles of wine, Zuko and Katara end up doing this in _Leave Your Spirit_. Katara's pained by her husband being away more often then he's not, while Zuko has been left a widower after his wife died. They regret it afterwards. It isn't until two years afterwards that Katara notices her daughter Kya is most likely not her husband's:
    
    _The planes of Fire Lord Zuko's face have hardened and his eyes squeeze shut as if he can lock out all the harsh memories of death and loving feelings never lost. And Katara watches him and wishes that she could take away some of the pain.  
    And then she looks away, because wanting to take away some of his pain was one of the reasons that she got herself into this situation.  
    That, and him wanting to take away hers._

-   Kalash93's _Relax_ is all about this trope. The conclusion is absolutely heartwarming. (Sturgeon's Law is in full effect here. You have been warned.) There's also related stories by the same author. In both, it's a case of a prostitute using her body to comfort her soldier client, but each one is told with an interesting twist which makes them both really good quick reads.
-   The _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ fanfic _Scar Tissue_ has Asuka sleeping with Shinji in order to alleviate her trauma. Played very darkly in that Shinji feels too guilty to say "no."
-   In the _Fairy Tail_ fanfic _The Spirit Doll_, Natsu and Lucy had done this after the battle with Tartaros. After they had both suffered the loss of someone they loved (ie. Igneel and Aquarius) with Lucy having the extra solace of almost losing Natsu to go with it. They need the reassurance that both of them were still there and alive, not realizing their actual feelings for one another. This led to Lucy having a daughter during the timeskip as well as the events of the story to take place.

Ripley has lost two people who meant a lot to her, and Clemens has spent a large part of his life on a bleak prison planet to atone for his past mistakes. Ripley also does it to deflect a question that Clemens asked her, but why she chose _this_ way to deflect it is this trope ("I've been out here a long time", she says).

-   In _It_, another work by Stephen King, the Losers become lost in the sewers after beating It for the first time and start to panic. Beverly calms the boys down and establishes a physical bond with them by having sex with them.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   It's hinted, implied and occasionally flat-out stated to be a big part of Bond's relationships with the Bond girls. His few meaningful relationships have ended in betrayal and/or death, hence his cavalier attitude towards women and his pursuit of sex as a pleasurable distraction (much like his drinking habit) or a means to an end.
    -   In _Death Is Forever_, Bond agrees to provide sexual comfort for a female spy who just became the sole living member of her network of thirty agents.
-   In _Jennifer Government_ Buy Mitsui blames himself for the death of a young girl because he gave her the money to buy the shoes she was killed for.

-   _Kushiel's Legacy_: Phèdre's friendship with Hyacinthe is entirely platonic, but they sleep together once after Hyacinthe's lover is killed in battle. As a sacred prostitute, she's very familiar with this trope and Intimate Psychotherapy, though not usually with so close a personal acquaintance.
-   In the backstory of _Shadow of the Conqueror,_ this was how Dayless began indulging in sex after the death of his family, using it as a method of coping with the pain within. He went from prostitutes to willing young girls in a hurry, and eventually indulged in increasingly extreme forms of stimulation to keep himself from depression.
-   In the Stephen King short story "The Raft" from _Skeleton Crew_, the protagonist has sex with his girlfriend. On a raft. In October in New England. While a man-eating blob, that has already eaten their friends, waits for them to drop a hair or a finger in the water. It being a King story, guess what happens.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Littlefinger sleeps with Lysa Tully after he gets drunk at the feast in which her sister Catelyn's engagement to Brandon Stark is announced. Though it's possible he might not have known who he was sleeping with.

-   Brett from _The Sun Also Rises_ is known for drinking, partying, and sleeping around (despite being 34 and engaged) to cope with the fact that she's been through two failed marriages, getting older (and, she fears, less desirable), questioning her engagement to Mike, and her tumultuous relationship with Jake.
-   _Tigana_: Dianora and Baerd's relationship was founded mostly out of their shared pain and loss. Their province just fell to an empire, their father died in the battle, their city is occupied. Even though they're siblings they fall into each other's arms in the aftermath of that. After they first have sex, they say to each other:
    
    **Baerd**: _What are we doing?_ What have we done?  
    **Dianora**: Oh, Baerd. What has been done to us?
    
-   In _Axiom's End_'s sequel _Truth of the Divine_, Cora hits rock bottom emotionally for various reasons, and is taken in by/hooks up with Kaveh, the only person on Earth who can even _begin_ to relate to what she's going through. It doesn't really help; with her self-esteem where it is, sex just becomes a new source of anxiety for her, and she doesn't start recovering until Kaveh makes her actually start working through her emotional state instead of letting it control her.
-   In the _Warchild Series_, it's stated that jets do this to handle the trauma of battle. Evan, who is not a jet, sleeps around as a way of coping with his PTSD.
-   In _Watchers of the Throne_, during the Days of Blindness, Tieron and Jek begin sleeping together as a way to stave off the terror they're feeling during that time. They break it off once the immediate crisis passes, though they remain Amicable Exes.
-   In _The Wheel of Time_, Min asks Rand for some physical comfort after Harid Fel is killed. However unusual a reaction that is to learning of a mentor figure being brutally dismembered, it does cement a Relationship Upgrade that lasts for the rest of the series.
-   In _The Will of the Empress_, Briar tries to have someone in his bed every night to ward off PTSD-induced nightmares.
-   In _Wedge's Gamble_ from the _X-Wing Series_, Erisi Dlarit tries to sleep with Corran Horn on this pretense; to ease his angst. He refrains and wanders an enemy-controlled city without watching where he's going instead. Probably just as well—rather than getting him captured or killed this leads to unexpected discoveries. Anyway, Erisi is a traitor to the cause.

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In Season 6, Buffy suffers from long-term depression after being taken from heaven back into the real world, and so engages in a Secret Relationship with bad-boy vampire Spike—who happens to be in love with her. Unfortunately, Buffy's guilt over using him only makes her feel worse and she eventually breaks off with him, causing Spike to seek solace in the arms of ex-demon Anya, who'd been recently left at the altar by Xander. The trope is directly name dropped by Anya in "Entropy", when she is confronted by Xander, as she states that the tryst was not an act of revenge but one of _solace_.
    -   When Buffy's mother dies, Angel does a Character Overlap in "Forever" just to comfort her, but has to leave early to prevent this trope from happening.
-   In _Californication_, Hank's promiscuity is largely due to his inability to cope with the demise of his romantic relationship with Karen. Also applies somewhat to Charlie in later seasons, after his divorce from Marcy.
-   _Castle_: After a very rough day, including a near-death encounter, a tense break-up with Castle, virtually being kicked off the force, and letting a good lead on her mother's killer get away, Beckett finally confesses her feelings for Castle and throws herself at him, at the end of the 4th season.

-   _Frasier_: In "Room Service", Frasier's ex-wife Lilith shows up and reveals her new husband has just left her. Frasier immediately realises she's looking for him to console her, and while he's _very_ tempted he resolves not to sleep with her. Lilith instead ends up in bed with Niles, who's currently going through his own torturous divorce from Maris.
    
    **Niles:** We both know why this happened; last night was simply two wounded people overcome with loneliness, confusion and...  
    **Lilith:** Tequila shooters.  
    **Niles:** Mmm-hmmm.
    
-   _Friends_:
    -   Chandler and Monica's first liaison comes about as a result of Monica becoming depressed at Ross's wedding to Emily - his second - while she is still single. Add in a wedding guest thinking that Monica is Ross's _mother_ and she's not feeling great about herself. When Chandler tells Monica how beautiful she is she throws herself at him, and while it at first looks to be a one-night stand the two of them can't wait to be back in each other's arms. It's the start of what many viewers consider the series' definitive relationship - and certainly its healthiest.
    -   Subverted in "The One Where Joey Speaks French" when, after Rachel's father has a heart attack, she turns to Ross for comfort and sex, although Ross rejects her. The next morning Rachel is annoyed as instead of being comforted she was left feeling "stupid and embarrassed".
        
        **Rachel:** In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
        
-   _Gossip Girl_'s Chuck Bass. Blair does this as well. So far she has had sex for comfort at least four times.
-   In the German soap opera _Hand aufs Herz_, Jenny assumes that she and Emma have broken up after having a fight, and Jenny sleeps with Ben for solace. Ben's also miserable about his love life at the time, making it a mutual thing.
-   _Haven_:
    -   Subverted in season 3. Audrey turns to Duke in season 3 while they're in Colorado following up on a lead for the series' overarching mythology. She stresses about the fact she's going to disappear in three weeks, her identity, and her relationships, before jumping him. It doesn't get beyond an intense kiss, and Duke doesn't push it, despite still having feelings for her. Weirdly, this becomes somewhat of a Trust Password between them, a Something Only They Would Say, because they're the only two who knows what did—and didn't—happen in that hotel room.
    -   Played straighter in season 5, when Duke is mourning Jennifer and taken advantage of by Mara, who uses the sex ans an opportunity to turn him into a walking, talking Trouble bomb.
-   Thirteen from _House_ slid into a downward spiral of partying and drunken one-night-stands with random chicks due to being unable to deal with her Huntington's disease.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_: This is how Barney and Robin hook up. She was depressed over her high school boyfriend dumping her _again_ (in the same situation, for the same girl, and for the same reason as the first time), and he made her feel better after she broke down crying. Coitus proceeded to ensue. Though a one-night stand at the time, he eventually sought to make it more than that.
-   In the _Knight Rider_ remake, Mike's Love Interest Sarah is grieving after the death of her father. Mike is trying to get her to return to work with him and KITT, but Sarah would rather lounge on the beach than face reality. Just as Mike, exasperated, is about to leave, she tells him she doesn't want to spend the night alone. Coitus ensues. However, this isn't their first time (she was his girlfriend before he was shipped out to Iraq), and neither does it signal a renewed relationship.
-   _Lost_: After seeing Jack flirting with Juliet, Kate goes straight to Sawyer and jumps him at his tent. He sees her subtly crying and puts two and two together but goes with it anyway.
-   Mentioned the _Lost Girl_ episode "Lachlan's Gambit". Lauren is grieving over Nadia's death and she even gives a scientific reason for this, but ultimately subverts it.
    
    **Lauren:** Can I sleep with you?  
    **Bo:** Yes.  
    **Lauren:** I just mean sleep. _\[Bo's face falls a little\]_ In your arms?  
    **Bo:** ... yeah exactly.
    
-   Subverted in _Lucifer_. Chloe tries this with Lucifer after Dan apparently breaks up with her via SMS. Lucifer surprises himself by not taking advantage of the fact that she is drunk.
-   Happens in Season 6 of _Mad Men_ where after helping Stan recover from a dart injury, Peggy receives a kiss from him and gently chides him for coming on to her ("You're lucky I don't like beards"), he then told her the reason he's been taking so much hard drugs: his cousin died in Vietnam, Peggy then voices she experienced loss and that one has to own that loss and not numb it with one-night stands and drugs, from her perspective it just seems he's still being his usual horny self (he gives a longing look at her when she walks away); she then discovers him having sex with the grieving hippie, teenage daughter of a late partner and disappointedly goes home.
-   _Miami Vice:_ After Zito's death in "Down for the Count," Trudy has sex with a man she hasn't seen in five years because she doesn't want to be alone. It doesn't make her feel any better.
-   _Nashville_: A lot of characters experience emotional trauma and have sex to try to help with that, with sometimes disastrous results, as Juliette can attest to, as she has done things like sleep around, drink, and jump off the slippery slope when her sometimes traumatic life becomes too much to bear.
-   _New Girl_: Jess's new roommates decide that the first order of business is to help her find a man to use for a rebound, for which they give her extensive coaching.
-   _Orange Is the New Black_: Numerous people in the show are hurting something fierce, owed in part to the prison setting and the drama experienced there, or just how much some of the characters lives sucked out of prison, and they long for love and touch from another person. Piper herself says she can't survive in prison and life without having someone to love and hold, and switches back and forth between sex with her male fiance, her one time girlfriend Stella, and her past girlfriend Alex, who she does actually end up with at the end. She wonders if Prison compels her to act like a worse version of herself by relentlessly on and off pursuing people she cares about and developing sadistic tendencies, or if she was always that way. Also, after Alex is essentially dumped by Piper for her original fiance; she immediately goes to Nicky for some sexual solace. Nicky also seeks out girls for sex to help with her personal issues, and she is a Hopeless Suitor for the straight Morella so her unrequited feelings cause her pain which she seeks to numb through relationships with other girls. Another flashback in season 5 had Alex drowning her sorrows over her love pain with Piper when the latter broke her heart. A Frenchman sits at the bar next to her and recounts his own love pain: his wife slept with multiple people and then married one of them and in response, he drinks heavily and sleeps with many women to try to forget the love pain. Although as he says talking about it and hearing about other people's love pain helps.
-   _The Punisher (2017)_. Dinah Madani is at home suffering from depression after her partner is killed due to an operation she planned, so she makes immediate advances on her boyfriend Billy Russo when he comes round. Even though he's portrayed as The Casanova Billy turns her down, saying sex is not going to make her problems go away.
-   Averted with a lampshade on an episode of _Remington Steele_. After Remington comforts Laura in the aftermath of a personal tragedy, in which this trope does not occur, Laura comments on what might have happened. Remington, a _gentleman_ rogue, finds the notion of them ending their UST that way offensive.
-   Implied in the _Roseanne_ revival, where it's noted that Becky has had a lot of flings since Mark died, but no real relationships, since she's never found anybody she likes as much as him. After the episode "Eggs Over, Not Easy" she seems to be trying to get over this.
-   _Scoundrels (2010)_:
    
    -   Tanya rather desperately offers this to Cal after Billy's death, but he's not interested.
    
    **Tanya:** I know you have a lot on your mind, but I did want to mention that I'm currently single, and I wanted you to know that I'm here for you, to comfort you in any way you need comforting morning, noon, night, the morning after!
    
    -   Hope uses this as an excuse when she kissed Tad for the first time.
    
    **Hope:** Don't people do this sort of thing at funerals to, you know, affirm life?
    
-   In _Smallville_, this is how both of Chloe's sexual relationships and eventually (dubious) marriages start. In season two, she had a (off-screen) summer fling with Jimmy after she broke up with Clark, and in season nine, is Strangled by the Red String with Oliver once Jimmy died.
-   In the pilot of _Something is Out There_, telepathic spacewoman Ta'Ra is exasperated by how human cop Jack Breslin is constantly fantasizing about her. However when Breslin is depressed because his partner was murdered by the Monster of the Week, she kisses him and it's implied they have sex (It's this trope for her as well as her previous lover was killed by the same alien monster).
    
    **Breslin:** What did you do that for?
    
    **Ta'Ra:** Because you wanted me to.
    
-   _Star Trek: Picard_: In "The Impossible Box", after murdering Maddox, Jurati sleeps with Rios, although he naturally thinks it's because she's upset about her ex-boyfriend's death.
-   _Supernatural_: Dean and Sam have had flings and relationships that ended badly due to their hunting lifestyle. It's implied to be because of their lifestyle (they are constantly on the move and in danger), why they seek out sex with women so much and to feel validated.
    -   Ruby kisses Sam when he is at his lowest and most vulnerable point in the wake of Dean's death, to prove to him that he still has her, at least. He tries to put some distance between them and rebukes her, but she keeps pushing it until he gives in, kisses her back (rather desperately), and has violent, desperate, hair-pulling sex with her. Rather than this showing two people coming together for comfort, it just goes to show how Sam has hit rock-bottom after Dean died. Sera Gamble even compared it to self-mutilating and calling it getting dressed for the prom.
-   _Switched at Birth_: Emmett is completely hysterical about his father giving up custodial rights, and is incredibly angry at his girlfriend Bay for interfering. Simone, meanwhile, is bummed out about her basketball tournament loss and her boyfriend Toby not trusting her. Both Emmett and Simone are out of town and coincidentally staying at the same hotel, and run into each other at the ice machine. She invites him to her room, and you can guess the rest.
-   On _That '70s Show,_ Donna's parents go through a long period of strain before her mom suddenly up and moves across the country. Immediately after, Donna has sex (twice) with Eric, her ex-boyfriend/now-platonic-friends-no-really. It turns out to be kind of a bummer for Eric, who thought this meant that she actually wanted to get back together with him.

    Music 

-   Cold Chisel's "Khe Sanh" describes a Vietnam War veteran suffering from PTSD, who engages in this.
-   Halsey's song "Strangers" is about a romance she had while trying to get over a long-term relationship. Ironically, the bridge makes it clear that both girls feel more than _just_ this, but won't admit it because they both think the other doesn't care.
    
    _We're not lovers, we're just strangers with the same damn hunger to be touched, to be loved, to feel anything at all._
    
    -   On the same album, "I find myself alone at night, unless I'm having sex" from "100 Letters" implies this.
-   "Out in the Cold" by Judas Priest is this trope incarnate.
-   Although it has a legacy of being one of the sauciest songs ever made, "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails is a brutal deconstruction of this trope if taken in the album's context, and describes how one must be thoroughly broken emotionally and have an overwhelmingly negative view of themselves to indulge in this. Overall, it's far more an Obsession Song than an Intercourse with You type of song.
-   The theme appears in several songs off _Carrie & Lowell_ by Sufjan Stevens, most notably in "No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross":
    
    _Like a champion, get drunk to get laid._
    
-   The Vaccines' song Post Break-Up Sex.
    
    _I can barely look at you_
    
    _Don't tell me who you lost it to_
    
    _Didn't we say we had a deal?_
    
    _Didn't I say how bad I'd feel?_
    
-   Tove Lo's "Habits (Stay High)" is about a self-destructive way of getting over one. Amongst the various ways to do so is this trope.
-   In Emmy The Great's "Edward Is Dedward", she hooks up with a friend after the titular Edward's funeral... in Edward's bed. Apparently Edward is a real friend of hers, but not really dead. That sure is a good way of putting a guy off _ever_ dying.

    Theater 

-   In _Artus Excalibur_, Artus' preoccupation with his war for revenge is what drives Guinevere into Lancelot's arms. Everyone involved has immediate regrets.
-   In _Lady Windermere's Fan_, Lady Windermere, mistakenly thinking her husband is cheating on her, resolves in a moment of despair to go to her other lover, Lord Darlington.
-   _Miss Saigon_. Chris grabs his wife Ellen and kisses her passionately, having just awakened from a nightmare about his lost love Kim. It's not hard to imagine that he's trying to invoke this trope.
-   A Streetcar Named Desire: Immediately following the event of her husband committing suicide after she told him that he disgusted her because she had found him in bed with a man, Blanche was subjected to a series of deaths in her family and the ultimate loss of the ancestral home. They illustrated the ugliness and brutality of life. To escape from these brutalities and to escape from the lonely void created by her young husband's death, Blanche turned to alcohol and sexual promiscuity. She had an affair with a student at a school where she was a teacher. It is why she lost her job.

    Video Games 

-   In _Fallout 4_, the Sole Survivor's husband/wife is murdered in the introduction to the game, and they are clearly emotionally distraught by this. They can later romance and sleep with one or more of their companions, which can come off as this, especially since several of the dialogue options can have the Survivor still be emotionally shaken and grieving over their spouse's death.
-   In _Heavy Rain_, Ethan can have an Optional Sexual Encounter with Madison when he is approaching the Despair Event Horizon over the events of the game. It's actually Sex For Solace for her respect as well, as she's been attacked by a serial killer and nearly raped at gunpoint during the preceding day.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_ the option to have a one-night stand with Jack can unlock for a male Shepard right after Horizon with some careful timing. Why is this considered solace? Because you could potentially get dumped by Ashley on Horizon, probably even in Jack's presence.
        -   Additionally, Jack is not the most emotionally stable and has a past of sexual abuse and emotional manipulation so it can be seen as solace from her end as well. This is a stark contrast to the Paragon version of the culmination of her romance path, which the hottest action the player can get is cuddling as a price of an emotionally-charged scene that features how much Jack tears down her barriers to show how she cares for Shepard.
    -   In _Mass Effect 3_, by the end, Shepard is having frequent nightmares and is visibly worn down. Shepard's sex scene before the final mission can be seen as this.
-   _The Walking Dead: Season Two': In_ Amid the Ruins'', Luke and Jane have sex while observing for walkers and in doing so, they miss a hoard of zombies that nearly kills the Cabin Survivors, Mike, and Jane (the only fatality can be Sarah but her fate is determinant). Although remorseful for nearly getting everyone killed, he emphasizes that it was an offer from Jane that he couldn't refuse because he was deeply stressed out from the apocalypse, Carver, and the deaths of his fellow survivors.
    
    **Luke**: Well, comin' down on me isn't helping. Look, I'm sorry, okay? I fucked up... but y'know what? Jane, she made an offer and... Jesus Christ, I needed it, okay. I mean look around you, okay? Everything is SHIT. So forgive me for wantin' to enjoy ONE MOMENT of somethin' else!
    

    Visual Novels 

-   After the protagonist of _Daughter for Dessert_ hears about Amanda's attraction to him from Kathy, he tells her what he's heard, and promises to help her explore what they discovered about each other. Then, they make love. Justified, since Amanda already came on to him before.

    -   Ms. Walsh seeks out sex, first with “Jailson Mendes,” whom she meets online and then openly with the protagonist, to deal with her dissatisfaction with her job.
-   In _Katawa Shoujo_, Misha tries to seduce her best friend Shizune's boyfriend Hisao because she's depressed and looking for comfort over the fact that she loves Shizune and knows she can never have her (while Shizune and Hisao have already had Their First Time). The self-contradiction here should tell you why "comforting" her is a terrible idea. Even worse, the sexual act is very painful for Misha. They don't get caught, but they both fall into depression over the guilt of betraying Shizune. Topping it off, choosing to comfort her triggers the route's Bad Ending.
-   _Melody_:
    -   The protagonist and Isabella can have sex to get over their respective breakups. Lampshaded by Isabella when she says that neither of them is “in the best place right now.”
    -   Melody, right after her breakup with Steve (and he kept her prized guitar), had sex with Sophia.

    Web Comics 

-   _Ménage à 3_: Matt demonstrates a slightly unusual variant on several occasions. He usually sleeps around on a whim without regard for how his actions affect others. However, he does sometimes fall for his partners, notably Kiley, and when those relationships break up he can seem genuinely heartbroken. But his response to such heartbreak seems to be to have sex with someone else, for solace. The seriousness of his feelings for Kiley can be measured by the fact that he gets some partners (male and female) to wear a wig resembling Kiley's hair.
-   Referenced and averted in _Questionable Content_, after Dora breaks up with Marten…
    
    **Sven:** Oh, and if you need some meaningless rebound sex, I know TONS of slutty chicks who'll—  
    **Marten:** OKAY THANK YOU BYE!

-   In _Sequential Art_, Hillary, sobbing, says she's not asking for much, just some sympathy -- cut to the two characters in bed.
-   _Ship In a Bottle_: Reversed. While the fact that she was a seductive buck-naked genie seemed to be all the incentive Allan needed to sleep with Shiphrah in the first issue, he was quick to blame the encounter on his grief about his recently-deceased grampa in the immediate aftermath, as an excuse to back out of a relationship with her.
-   In _Something\*Positive,_ Davan's old friend Scotty kills himself when his longtime off-and-on girlfriend, Donna, breaks up with him. Donna feels guilty and thinks everyone else blames her, Davan was also mourning and assures her that it wasn't her fault, and, well… When they meet again a few years later, Davan winds up having to take a Daddy DNA Test.
-   _Subnormality_ has "A Christmas Eve in the Future", in which a man walks into a Sex Stop ("Serving all genders since 2130!") looking for this.

-   From the 10 Commandments for Pilots:
    
    Thou shalt cast thine eyes to thy right and also to thy left as thou passeth through the firmament lest thy fellow pilots bring flowers to thy widow and comfort her in other ways.
    
-   Played With in _Critical Role_ when Percy and Lilith vanish after an evening that has been traumatic for both of them and the other characters assume they are doing this. Subverted, as it turns out: Lilith has left in the night, leaving only a note, and Percy has locked himself in his workshop to have a minor Heroic BSoD. Grog remains convinced the two are...consoling each other even _after_ finding Lilith's note.

    Western Animation 

-   In an episode of _Archer_, Lana had sex with the eponymous protagonist after he asked for it because Archer learned he had cancer.
    -   In the second season finale Archer's fiance Katya sacrifices herself to try and take out Barry (who survives). The third season opens with Archer having run away to, as his mother puts it, "grief-bang the entire Pacific Rim". Archer shamelessly admits that his tragic story turned out to be extremely useful for getting women into bed with him.
-   _Family Guy_ has Quagmire, who constantly sleeps around after losing his chances with The One That Got Away.
-   In the _Futurama_ episode, "The Beast With A Billion Backs", Zapp manages to manipulate Amy into having sex with him after Kif dies. This is made even worse when Kif comes back to life and finds out.
    
    **Kif:** Perhaps you should see the meaning of "Fon-fon-ru!" It means "one who doesn't sleep with my superior officer!" That's the literal translation!
