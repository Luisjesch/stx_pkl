Alice is aroused by Bob, prompting her to act out that lust with Charlie. The key is that Alice is not merely fantasizing about Bob while she's with Charlie, but that being turned on by Bob _motivated_ her to go have sex with Charlie in a time when they might not have otherwise.

In many works, for a partnered person to be aroused by any Lust Object besides their partner is a forerunner to danger or at least high drama. But sometimes a character will perform a kind of lust judo and redirect their heightened libido in a more acceptable direction.

The situation need not be an actual encounter with a person, it could for instance be hearing a story, including one involving their partner but not themselves. However, things being as they are, the math is often that a man hearing about his female partner's experience with a woman will lead to retargeted lust, as will a woman hearing about her male partner's early experience with another woman, but other combinations will just lead to trouble.

Given that many partnered people live their lives surrounded by potentially arousing people, images, and ideas, and yet somehow most of them remain mostly monogamous most of the time, it is probable that this phenomenon is if anything more common in Real Life than in fiction.

Does not include circumstances such as a couple watching pornography together, which is more passive, planned, and "safe". Also does not include cases where a character tries to use lust for one person as a way of overcoming their Incompatible Orientation from their partner, which is a form of Gayngst.

A Wrong-Name Outburst is likely. If the lust in question leads to masturbation, then it's more of an I'll Be in My Bunk moment.

-   In _Basic Instinct_, having been thoroughly taunted and titillated by murder suspect Catherine Trammell, Detective Nick Curran more or less forces himself on his on-again/off-again girlfriend, police psychologist Beth Garner.

-   _Seeds of Yesterday_: Bart beds Melodie shortly after Cindy catches him spying on her while she's at the pool. Later, he visits a brothel and selects a prostitute who resembles Cindy.

    Literature 

-   Kinda what happens in "Victims of Circumstances" novella from the first volume of _Labyrinths of Echo_: Max and Melamori, who kept having rather moist dreams about each other (despite not really being in a relationship when awake), fall prey to some Wild Magic and wake up in the same bed one morning. After all the yelling and name-calling, Melamori storms off, saying she'll go visit the local Red Light District and have sex with a total stranger, just to spite him. Before long, he ends up in said district, as well. Because the "brothels" in Echo work differently from our world (it's more of a blind dating than prostitution), they end up being accidentally matched together, anyway—which only complicates their relationship even more.
-   Discussed on more than one occasion in the _Dragonriders of Pern_ world, when two dragons want to mate, but their riders don't want to do so with each other (Incompatible Orientation, a possible incestuous pairing, one or both riders are in committed relationships, or they simply hate each other). The solution is for each rider to stay near his/her preferred partner during a flight, or find a willing third party for the occasion.

-   _Middlesex_: Lefty goes to a church and prays, castigating himself for his attraction to his sister Desdemona. Then he goes to a brothel and has sex with a girl who resembles her, and calls her by that name.
    -   This is later the cause of the "Simultaneous Fertilization" that leads to the existence of the protagonist's parents, second cousins Milton and Tessie: their parents went together to (what turned out to be) a very erotically charged production of _The Minotaur,_ and the inevitable occurred in their respective bedrooms when they all got home. Notably, Tessie's mother, Sourmelina, was a closeted lesbian and was retargeting her lust for the chorus girls.
        
        **Desdemona:** I don't remember what I was thinking that night.
        
        **Lina:** I do. Third one from the right. With the red hair.
