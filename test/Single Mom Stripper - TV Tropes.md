Gonna be awkward when the little one is old enough to ask, "How was your day mom?"

_"What would you do when your son's at home?  
Crying alone on the bedroom floor  
And he's hungry  
And the only way to feed him  
Is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money?"_

Your nasty husband has cheated on you and left. Or maybe you're an unwed teenager, and you chose to carry to term, but you had to drop out of school due to your pregnancy, your very traditional parents threw you out onto the streets once your pregnancy started showing, and the baby's father is completely out of the picture. Or maybe your husband died, he was the primary breadwinner, and you've been out of the workforce since you got married. Or you're a single mom, and your Pointy-Haired Boss fired you for a crappy reason (or no reason at all). Regardless, you're out of work, you've got a baby to feed and you're one missed rent payment away from being out on the streets.

You realize that the boys at school really liked you. Maybe you could make some quick fast cash waiting tables--in a bikini. Or pole dancing. Or going all the way, if needed.

A Single Mom Stripper is a single woman working in any aspect of the sex trade (stripper, porn star/adult model, escort, hooker, masseuse, taxi-dancer, phone-sex operator, etc.) because she sees it as a practical way to support her child or children. On one hand, this trope can humanize the women and give them a story behind their beauty. But on the other hand, it implies that a woman who is only in the business due to circumstance is more deserving of respect and sympathy than one who does it by choice.

May be a Hooker with a Heart of Gold or a Junkie Parent. The children might be treated as a Son of a Whore, whether or not actual prostitution is involved. May also be used to give the Disposable Sex Worker a sympathetic backstory. Compare with Justified Criminal. Usually results from Struggling Single Mother and sometimes overlaps with Secret Sex Worker, with the mom trying to keep her profession a secret from her children.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _7 Seeds_ had Semimaru's mother raising him on her own, while working as a night-worker.
-   This trope proves to be a godsend for Yuusaku Godai, the male lead of _Maison Ikkoku_. The young man manages to graduate from college as a teacher trained in early childhood education and hoping to work in an elementary school until he's laid off and the only work he can find is a strip joint. After a humiliating period as a street barker, things turn around when one of the dancers, a single mother who couldn't afford daycare, is forced to bring her toddler kids to work. In this situation, Godai is ordered to take care of the child safely out of sight in the back and does so well that the other dancers, predominately single mothers themselves, ask him to take care of their little kids. Pretty soon, Godai is running an excellent daycare centre at the strip joint and is deeply valued by the rest of the staff.
-   Nina from _Sweet Guilty Love Bites_ isn't a stripper, but the hostess job she does to support Ryuna is dependent on her looks, and leads to some awkwardness. Though at the end the single part is not so applicable anymore.
-   Reiko from _Forest of Piano_ is a prostitute mother raising her son Kai on her own in the town's Red Light District.
-   _Dance in the Vampire Bund_ has Mina temporarily sheltered by one while on the run from her enemies. She repays the favor by willingly surrendering to protect her and her daughter, and brutally slaughtering the pedophile vampire "interested" in little Suzy.
-   In _Rurouni Kenshin_, Yahiko's mother, the wife of a Samurai, turned to prostitution to support herself and Yahiko after her husband was killed in the Meiji Restoration. Unfortunately, this move cost her her life: she contracted syphilis from one of her clients, which eventually killed her. Yahiko makes it clear when some villains mock him for it that he considers his mother every bit the hero that his samurai father was, and that he is the son of two brave people who gave their lives to protect what mattered to them.
-   Implied in _Ginga Hyouryuu Vifam_, as Sharon once mentioned that her mother isn't around much to take care of her due to her job as a dancer.
-   _Booty Royale: Never Go Down Without a Fight!_: Recurring character Goujima Sara is an extreme porn star who is revealed in chapter 22 (at least a year in-universe since her last appearance) to have an infant son with no further explanation. Main character Misora criticizes her for swearing in front of the kid when they go out to dinner together.

    Comic Books 

-   _Watchmen_: In the flashbacks, Rorschach's mother is a single mom prostitute. Perhaps an Inverted Trope, in that she _hates_ him because he inadvertently drives away business. ("I shoulda had the abortion!") The woman living in the next apartment from him in the present is also a prostitute but successfully keeps this secret from her children. Though she lies to the news about him trying to rape her, Rorschach doesn't kill or seriously hurt her because her children are present — and also because her efforts to hide what she does from them indicate that, unlike his own mother, she cares enough about her children to protect them from the ugliness of her life.

-   Garth Ennis' _The Pro_ is a superhero parody in which a woman in this trope gets given superpowers. She doesn't stop working as a prostitute since she has to pay the bills somehow.
-   Despite having been a prostitute long before the birth of her son Pepito, Clara (or Betty, for English speakers) from _Clara... de Noche_ (aka _Betty by Night_ or _Betty by the hour_) claims that she continues as a hooker to support her son and grant him a decent lifestyle.
-   In a brief _MAD Magazine_ comic strip from the late '90s, two teenage boys are looking at internet porn when one asks the other if that's his mom. At first, the second boy thinks he's joking until he realizes it _is_ his mom. He runs home and asks her how she could do such a thing, and she nonchalantly replies, "I made enough money in ten minutes to afford one of those Sega Dreamcasts you've been bitching about." His tone _quickly_ changes.

    Fan Works 

-   Downplayed _bent or broken, it's the family tree_. Esmeralda is a single mother who dances to make money. However, it's just that—dancing, fully clothed, in the streets. It's still somewhat scandalous by 1400s France standards.
-   In _Four Horsewomen - Family Is Forever_, this is Bayley's backstory. Her mother was only a teenager when she had her, then her boyfriend (Bayley's father), a musician, was killed. She took it hard and wound up doing this for a living, as well as getting into drugs & alcohol and having a boyfriend who abused Bayley, which led to her being taken in and adopted by Stephanie McMahon and Triple H. By the time the mother comes back into Bayley's life nine years later, she's cleaned up her act, married a nice guy, found religion, and had another daughter.
-   Played with in _"Batteries"_, where Ryuuko started off as a stripper but she had her baby, Hoshi, after she took up work as a prostitute. Though, while she was doing sex work to support herself after running away from home, if she had custody of her baby, she most likely would have become this, but getting pregnant again, she opts to leave sex work for a more "honest" job at a laundromat.
    -   In _Secret Sunshine_ (by the same author), Ryuuko mentions "turning tricks" as something she considered to better support her niece, Kiko.
-   By the end of the _Zootopia_ fan comic _The Longest Night_. Nadja returns home to her daughter Anya with groceries bought with the money Nick paid for her services.
-   In the Worm fanfic _Alternate Beginnings_ one of the characters has an 18 year old sister. She's not the mom, but when her parents both lose their jobs (and after the younger teenage son has turned down joining of the worse gangs in the city) and they're about to be tossed on the street, she takes up hooking to get money to support them. The younger brother catches her at coming home one night and tells her she's not doing that again and promptly joins up with the gang. Some months later she's managed to land a temp job and between that and the income he's pulling from gang duties they're managed to make ends meet.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Dangerous Beauty_ is about a 16th-century woman who becomes a courtesan to support herself and her mother.
-   Jasmine from _Independence Day_. Unlike most examples, however, she's not the least bit ashamed of her line of work ("It's good money. Besides, my baby's worth it."), she's in a long-term relationship with an airman who is a great stepdad to her son, and the film deserves credit for not making her any less sympathetic.
-   Note to cruel kids: Do not tease Michael Myers in the _Halloween (2007)_ remake about how his mom is a pole dancer.

-   Demi Moore's character in _Striptease_, though she starts out not to support her daughter but to get money to appeal the custody decision against her. Bet that really helped her case... Oh, but it did, because Fate moves in mysterious ways here. After a congressman who not only frequents the club but has arranged for the murder of his political opponents starts to fall for her, he hires her for personal dances. He says too much, she starts to get wise to his shady dealings, then he tries to blackmail her by helping her ex-husband. Consequently, she helps the police expose him by tricking him into confessing on tape, and she not only wins full custody as a result, but her deadbeat ex-husband winds up back in jail.

-   Heather Graham's character in _The Hangover_ is both a single mom stripper _and_ a single mom prostitute. She says that she works at a strip club as a way of meeting clients.

    **Alan:** How dare you, she's a nice lady!
    
-   One background character in _Repo!_, based on what she does in her one scene.
    
    I needed an organ transplant desperately  
    Geneco showed this single mom sympathy  
    This makeover came for a small added fee  
    Now I look smashing on live TV!
    

-   Halley in _The Florida Project_ at first works as a stripper in order to support herself and her young daughter.

-   In _Sands of Iwo Jima_, Sgt. Stryker (John Wayne) is disgusted by the prostitute he meets — until he finds out that she has a baby. (It's implied she's in the business to support her son.) Stryker dandles the boy for a while, gives the woman money, and leaves.

-   A dancer in the nude stage show in _Showgirls_ has to chase down her son running through the dressing room. This appears to be a frequent occurrence.

-   Diana "Diamond" Armstrong from _The Players Club_ began stripping to support her and her son and help pay for college with the aspirations of becoming a television journalist.

    Literature 

-   _Dancing Aztecs_: Jerry's one-night stand Myra is a stripper and mentions having a kid who's staying with her mother.
-   The trope is central to the premise of _Striptease_, both the Carl Hiaasen book and the movie (see above).
-   One of the "actresses" in the _The Dresden Files_ book _Blood Rites_, most of which happens in and around a porn studio (It Makes Sense in Context) is a single mom trying to feed her kids.
-   In _Chronicles of Nick_, Cherise Gautier (Nick's mother) had him at fifteen and works as a Bourbon St stripper, but is supposed to be just about the sweetest human being you could ever meet... until she's murdered and left for Nick to find.

-   In _Crime and Punishment_ Sonya becomes a prostitute to feed her brothers and sisters.
-   Fantine from _Les Misérables_ is fired from her factory job for having a child out of wedlock, which also makes it impossible for her to find any other legitimate employment. Leaving her daughter with the money-grubbing Thénardiers does not help her financial situation, and when she has run out of other things to sell, she resorts to selling her body.
-   _Strip Tease_, by Carl Hiaasen, hinges on this trope: Erin Grant becomes a stripper, but only because she has to do something lucrative to pay off her legal fees from trying to get custody of her daughter from her sleazeball ex-husband. She never actually has much of a romance with anybody, let alone being saved by The Power of Love, and she gets the happiest ending of anyone in the book.
-   Ryuji's mother Yasuko Takasu in _Toradora!_ isn't a stripper but a bar hostess, which in Japan is regarded as practically the same thing; using her sex-appeal while waiting tables and entertaining bar patrons is part of her job.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Tiffy in _The Unit_ worked as a Family-Friendly Stripper after separating from her husband.

-   Hilda on _Ugly Betty_ once ended up working at a Hooters analogue for this reason.
-   Cassie on _Guiding Light;_ did this to try to make enough money to get her daughter out of foster care. Cassie was later so Anvilicious about treating her past as an Old Shame you'd think she'd been a prostitute dealing cocaine to school children.

-   Frederico in _Six Feet Under_ had an affair with a stripper who was a single mom. He didn't really have that much sex with her, as much as he just bought her lots of nice things she never asked for in the first place.
-   LT Hawkes spends a night with a prostitute on R&R in _Space: Above and Beyond_. Halfway through the night, he stumbles into the next room to find a sleeping baby. While the woman was upset that he found the baby's room, earlier she was excited to see he had a stash of painkillers highly addictive for their species.

In the ensuing custody dispute, Gillian's unsavoury lifestyle and habitation are major black marks against her.

-   In season 3 of _Downton Abbey_, Isobel Crawley discovers that Ethel Parks has become a prostitute after having had an illegitimate son in the previous season. Truth in Television — this was all too common among disgraced unwed mothers at the time.

Catherine gives a I Was Young and Needed the Money kind of reply, which doesn’t help much.

    Music 

-   The song "Rockabye" by Clean Bandit implies this about the subject of the song, who is going to "do what I got to do" to provide a better life for her young son, and also mentions how she can't find the child's father anywhere. The music video makes the stripping aspect more explicit, with the mother twirling on a stripper pole in a bar in her underwear.
-   The Kenny Chesney song _"Dancin' for the Groceries"_ tells of a desperate single mother who resorts to stripping in order to make ends meet.

    "I have to admit it was even more of a turn-on  
    When I found out she was doin' me to buy baby formula."
    
-   Cher's "Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves" is about the daughter of a tent show dancer (not a single mom; papa's a tent-preacher or snake-oil seller and would have protected his daughter if he'd known what was going on, and helps support his grandkid) who becomes a Single Mom dancer herself. Stripping may or may not be involved.

    Music Videos 

-   Metallica's video for "Turn The Page" features a Single Mom Stripper. And it just goes spiraling from there.

-   In Juvenile's video for "Rodeo", the camera goes "behind the scenes" at a strip club.

-   _The Simpsons_ :
