A normal day for Rito.

_"How did we get into this position from the way we bumped into each other? It seems the laws of physics don't apply to you anymore."_

When two characters fall in close proximity and wind up in a sexually suggestive position. The guy finds himself in Marshmallow Hell, or the girl lands sitting on his face. It could even result in an Accidental Kiss. The lighter versions will just end with the guy copping a feel.

Needless to say, this trope is _particularly_ likely to affect the Accidental Pervert.

Regardless of the circumstances, nine and a half times out of ten the girl will act like it was deliberate — usually, that means screaming "Pervert!" and slapping him. On the other hand, she might tease him for it, welcome the advance or remark on his "boldness". It mostly depends on what kind of girl she is.

If someone walks in on them, Not What It Looks Like is all but inevitable. Often leads to a Please Get Off Me.

A staple of Harem Anime. May overlap with Crash-Into Hello if this is the first time the characters meet. Thanks for the Mammary and Funbag Airbag are Sub Tropes. Not to be confused with unintentional occurrences of awkward positions, as caused by Ragdoll Physics in video games. Compare Grossout Fakeout.

Truth in Television to an extent. When someone takes a tumble, their first basic instinct (and usually the correct one) is to shift their body or limbs towards the softest or most stable object they can reach. And as it happens, nearby people can very commonly fit the bill for "softest or most stable". The exact suggestiveness of their prone positions is more of a coin flip than modern anime would have you believe, but as modesty takes a back seat to impending pain, there is definitely a chance of an _interesting_ aftermath.

Compare Clingy Sleepers.

The more serious and romantic Sister Trope is Literally Falling in Love.

    Anime & Manga 

-   One chapter of _Ayakashi Triangle_ begins with Yayo tripping into Matsuri, causing her to grabs his butt and looks up his skirt. Since Yayo had rather shamelessly grabbed Matsuri's breasts the previous chapter, she can't convince him it was an accident, and spends the chapter trying to make up with him. Matsuri discovers that Yayo was possessed by a minor ayakashi, causing her to trip constantly, which almost sends her face-first down a flight of steps.
-   _Code Geass_:
    -   Kallen falls over Lelouch in a suggestive position, lampshading their uncertain relationship.
    -   Suzaku ends up falling on top of Shirley. However, in this case, it is treated as a total accident by both parties, there is no Ship Tease involved, and nobody walks in to find them in this position, so its only relevance for their respective characters is, perhaps, that it emphasizes that they are simply good enough (platonic) friends for it not to be a problem.
-   _Cross Ange_: Tusk repeatedly falls face-first into Ange's crotch, resulting in Ange calling him a pervert. And once reversed when Ange fell into _Tusk's_ crotch.
-   _Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker_ features one of these collisions between Galyan and Cassandra as they flee from the Seekers while chained together. Galyan earns a smack when he jokes about it.
-   _Fairy Tail_: Often happens to Natsu and Lucy:
    -   In the Phantom Lord arc, she jumps off a building to escape from Jose Porla, confident that Natsu will catch her. She ends up with shoving her bust into Natsu's face upon landing, though she isn't too bothered by it considering the current situation.
    -   In the Grand Magic Games arc, during the attack of the seven dragons from the past one of them strips Lucy naked and she later ends up flying through the air and colliding with Natsu. To top it off, the two end up trapped inside a bell, and Natsu tries to protect Lucy's modesty... covering her boobs with his hands.

-   _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA_:

-   _Fate/Grand Order - Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia_: Ishtar, goddess of love and war, crashes into Fujimaru and lands sitting on his face. Fujimaru introduces himself to her with "Hi, I'm your cushion." This exchange is also present in the game, although narrated instead of animated (the quip is a player dialog option).
-   Subverted in _FLCL_ where it looks like Naota and Ninamori are about to have a collision kiss, but instead their foreheads collide violently with each other. Then again, like just about everything in _FLCL_, foreheads are often used as metaphors for sexual organs.

    -   Sousuke throws himself on top of a scantily dressed Kaname to shield her from automatic weapons fire. There's a Running Gag involving Sousuke being mistaken for a pervert (at the time, Kaname didn't know he was a Mithril operative assigned to protect her) so naturally, Kaname starts hitting him in the face.
-   _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_. Toward the end of Season 1, Batou and the Major are on the run and hiding out in a skyscraper. A police helicopter flies up to the window and shines its sunlight in. Batou quickly pushes the Major behind a pillar. Shortly after there's a Did They or Didn't They? scene as Batou walks off with his arm around her.
-   _Giant Ojou Sama_. Despite being a 9 year old Child Prodigy, Nakano Giraffe is a magnet for this sort of thing, with his introductory chapter ending with him under a gigantified Madoka's butt.

-   In the episode which introduces Priscilla in _GUN×SWORD_, she pulls Van out of the way of a collision with a rolling object, only to end up sitting on him in a very sexual looking position.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_

    -   In Chapter 38 of the manga, Petra does a leap onto a balcony where her handler Sandro is fighting with an attacker. She ends up on top of him and for a moment their faces are quite close...until Sandro shoves her off him as she's really heavy thanks to her cyborg body.

-   _I Want Your Mother To Be With Me!_: Asahi's pet beetle startles Yuzuki and she trips, falling butt-first into Ryo's face. It's quite a case of Mood Whiplash, since the rest of the chapter is a serious story about kids learning that Death Is a Sad Thing.
-   Happens in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_, the first time Erio Mondial and Caro Ru Lushe meet each other. Caro doesn't even seem to notice that she fell onto Erio boobs-first, perhaps out of gratitude for him catching her at all (she just tripped down a staircase).

The collision is seen from an upskirt angle, to show that his erection was pressed against her camel toe.

-   _Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation_: When Fitts confronts Rudeus in the library, their interaction escalates into both falling onto the ground with the former on top of the latter's crotch.

Once Morei recovers from the fall, she realizes she's fallen in top of Shouta, her crotch is right in his face, _and_ she wet herself during the fall. Shouta calmly asks Morei to get off of him. Morei is so humiliated she yells a Big "NO!" and punches Shouta so hard he flies through the stuck door that was keeping them trapped.
    -   In chapter 18, Shouta starts out standing, facing Ichigo, who is standing in front of Muni.

-   In _Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness_ during the finale, Leon rushes across a walkway to rescue Claire who’s about to fall and after grabbing her hand and pulling hard, Claire falls on top on him in a sensual manner. They both take a Beat as Leon asks if she’s okay, before Claire awkwardly gets off him, the fact the room they’re in is currently filling up with acid doesn’t seem to concern either of them in the moment.
-   Happens in _Rosario + Vampire_ at the end of a fight between Kurumu and Mizore's moms (named Ageha and Tsurara, respectively). In an attempt to break the fight up, Tsukune is thrown at the two women — and lands in a very awkward position where his face is between Tsurara's legs and his hand is grabbing Ageha's chest.
-   _Sands of Destruction_ has a couple, both afflicting poor Kyrie:

-   In _Seitokai Yakuindomo_ happened between Suzu Hagimura and Takatoshi Tsuda. The aftermath of it is one Tsundere Suzu. Mrs. Hagimura seems pleased that they might've had sex. Suzu also causes a variant when she suddenly runs into and hugs Takatoshi in relief,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  which didn't help given how her head is at crotch height.
-   _Shimoneta_ has Tanukichi falling right on top of Anna Nishikomiya, the Student Council President and one of the leaders of the Moral Guardians trying to eradicate "dirty things", and giving her an Accidental Kiss. Unfortunately for Tanukichi, this sets off something terrifying within Anna, who quickly becomes obsessed with the poor guy.

Naturally, she takes it out _on him._
-   In _Strawberry 100%_ happen often to the male protagonist, Junpei, with every girl. The best example is the first meet with Kozue. She not only falls on top of Junpei but she gives him quite an eyeful (of her panties) in the process before screaming and running away.
-   In episode 8 of _Sword Art Online_, Asuna accidentally lands on top of Kirito with her breasts in his face after teleporting into the zone he is in. Things quickly take a turn for the worst when the situation results in a Thanks for the Mammary moment, resulting in Kirito taking a massive hit from her as a result.
-   Rito from _To Love Ru_ is seemingly incapable of walking in close proximity with a girl without having this happen. One time Yui even tried to avert this because she's well aware of his tendency for this, which naturally ended in her being the cause of the inevitable collision.
    -   By _Darkness_, whenever Rito is onscreen, he can barely go for more than a couple of pages without tripping and literally landing face first in someone's crotch. One incident involving a rogue vacuum cleaner ends up actually _burying_ him under a pile of naked girls.
    -   A few times, others have collided with Rito. In a later episode, Tearju bumps into Rito in the hallway at school and somehow ends up sitting on his face with her panties pulled to the side. Rito ends up getting a faceful _and_ a mouthful when Tearju inadvertently gets off from it.
    -   It eventually gets to the point that there are two chapters dedicated to the other characters trying to figure out why it happens so often and curing it. They first attributed it to "Cataplectic Indecency Syndrome" (aka. Rito tries so hard to be a gentlemen despite being surrounded by girls that his base urges started to manifest subconsciously), but after the inevitable happens<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  they decide that it's an incurable supernatural phenomenon.
-   A few times in _Vandread_. Hibiki walks off, then accidentally bumps his face into Jura's breasts. Happens again in the cockpit of Vandread Jura where both pilots fall over in fatigue (Hibiki keels over first, then Jura falls over him, boobs on his head). The first time Hibiki and Meia combine their rides into Vandread Meia, Hibiki leans backwards, accidentally pressing back on Meia's chest. Then Hibiki climbs up a ladder quickly and accidentally smooshes his face into Dita's behind in Season Two. Towards the end of Season One, this unfortunate tendency of Hibiki to collide with the female pirates sparks off a massive protest after he accidentally stumbles through a door into one of the girl's quarters and faceplants into her behind; they eventually get over it before the Harvest fleet could destroy them.
-   Happens in practically every chapter of _Why the Hell Are You Here, Teacher!?_.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Happens to Joey and Mai in the episode "Lights, Camera, Duel." Played with though, in that Mai fell on top of him because he was catching her as she fell from a dangerous height—and instead of going for the pervert-slap, Mai thanks him for saving her and calls him an "action hero".
    -   Happened again in _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_ with Yuma and Ray with the latter crashed into the former on a busy morning to school. It's later revealed that Ray (Vector) purposely invoked this trope.

    Comic Books 

-   _Blue Monday_: In a flashback to Bleu's first Valentines Dance, Victor slips on spilled punch and knocks Clover into the punch bowl, and then onto the floor.

**Bleu:** If you didn't know each other before, I'd say you know each other now. Is that legal in public?  
**Victor:** Sorry! I'm sorry!  
**Clover:** I _hope_ for your sake that's a pencil! A simple _"hello"_ would have done fine, y'know!

-   _SpyBoy_ has some fun with this. One instance had Bombshell falling with her breasts landing square on Butch's face. She lifted herself off him without a word (though looking mildly annoyed) while he lay there smiling goofily.
-   In _The Umbrella Academy: Apocalypse Suite_, Kraken pushes Vanya to the ground- partly to protect her from enemy fire, and partly to be a jerk. (Kraken has issues.) Since they used to date, their position has the usual connotations.
-   In the comic version of _Winx Club_ it is revealed that this was how Timmy met Tecna. During the first ball, Timmy was searching the ground trying to find one of his electronics, and since he wasn't watching where he was going, his face smooshes into Tecna's butt.
-   _Young Avengers_: During the battle with Kang, Eli tackles Kate out of the way of an energy blast and ends up on top of her. They talk about how this makes them even for Kate saving him earlier, neither of them in any apparent hurry to get up until their teammates snap them out of it.

    Fan Works 

-   _Advice and Trust_: In chapter 4 Rei makes an indiscreet, offhand comment about Shinji touching her in a weird place, prompting Asuka to ask what happened.

-   In _The Death God Alliance_, Sadie falls on Nico causing a deconstruction of this trope when Nico gets a bad concussion.
-   _A Certain Droll Hivemind_: Touma throws himself over Misaka-11111 to protect her from an explosion, and ends up with his face in her boobs. 11111, of course, has no idea why she would be upset about this, and wonders why he keeps blushing and apologizing.
    
    The Network does not know what he is talking about. Misaka-15293 points out that he may be feeling bad about hurting my chest with his face. That is evidence that he is thoughtful. "'I do not think you have any reason to apologise,' Misaka says, her body aching,' I say, hurting all over no matter what my mean sisters might say about me complaining. Misaka-10032 prompts me to apologise to him, and I consider it a sensible thing to do. "'I wish to apologise if my chest hurt your face', Misaka says," I said. "'My ribcage is optimised for protecting my organs, not for being comfortable to rest on,' Misaka adds, massaging the site of injury and deciding that she may have a bruise," I add. Yes. I think I will have a bruise there. I will monitor its development and schedule an appointment with my assigned healthcare professional if there are signs of further injury.

They're both quite embarrassed by this.
-   _The One I Love Is..._: Shinji colliding with other woman and falling on top of her happens so many times it is a Running Gag. Shinji had fallen on top of Rei before the beginning of the story, he fell on top of Asuka when she was asleep and lying on her bed and he tripped and fell over Misato when he was helping her to go to her bedroom. All accidents are highly embarrassing to him.
-   A mild example occurs in the Oak's Summer Camp Gaiden sidestory of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_.

-   In _The Weaver Option_ while repelling a boarding action, Gabriela Jordan is thrown across a room and crashes into Clockblocker, knocking him flat on his back while she ends up straddling him. Just to ensure the humiliation, Clockblocker instinctively froze her armor so they were locked in their pose long enough for Ancient Pierre to make a crack about fraternizing _after_ the battle.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: How the food fight ends. Jaune lands on Cinder and accidentally gropes her. She throws him across the room, and in the chaos Ruby ends up with her face in his chest (and unable to breathe), he ends up with Yang's boobs on his face (and unable to breathe), while Yang lands in a big cake or something, leaving them all splattered (and unable to breathe). And then Ruby and Yang's uncle Qrow walks in.

-   The lead in _Eight Days A Week_ does this intentionally. He's spending the summer camped out on his true love's front lawn in an effort to win her over. She enlists his help in climbing down from her window to sneak out of the house to be with her _actual_ boyfriend. He helps but also takes the opportunity to invoke this trope, falling down with her on top of him in a different position each time.
-   This happens in _Enchanted_ when Giselle falls out of the bathroom onto Robert _whilst wearing only a towel_. And naturally it happens just as Robert's girlfriend Nancy walks in.

-   In _The Naked Gun_, Lt. Drebin jumps over the queen to save her from what he thinks is imminent danger. Of course, that's not what it looks like in the front page picture.
-   A Running Gag in the _Police Academy_ franchise is Lt. Callahan's self-defense training that often ends with her legs around the guy's neck... and yes, in that way.
-   In _The Proposal_, Margaret makes a nude run for the wardrobe from the shower. Andrew is also naked, getting ready to take a shower of his own. Neither is looking and they walk into each other at a fast pace. He ends up on top for her:

    -   Between Angel and Buffy in "I Will Remember You", and lampshaded by her later.

    -   Justine pushes Vampire Hunter Holtz out of the way of a falling object and they lie on each other wide-eyed. The next episode implies they've had a Relationship Upgrade.
-   _Arrow_. Slade Wilson is sparring hand-to-hand with Shado and they end up on the ground holding knives on each other. Shado is actually involved with Oliver, who's watching them fight, but this trope hints at Slade's attraction to her as well.
-   _Batwoman_:
    -   In the pilot episode, Kate Kane (disguised as the title character) rescues her former lesbian love interest Sophie when she's thrown off a building. They crash through a roof onto a bed, further adding to the erotic subtext. It happens again in the next episode when Sophie does a Diving Save on Kate to stop her being run over by a van.
    -   Played for laughs in "How Queer Everything Is Today". Kate stops a runaway subway car with her cable hook but it breaks and would have taken her head off but for a Diving Save by handsome GCPD officer Slam Bradley. Their Suggestive Collision leads to widespread Shipping to Kate's annoyance. In the climatic scene it's Kate who does the Diving Save to rescue Bradley from a bomb blast. The crowd of bystanders start chanting: "Kiss! Kiss!" and Bradley eagerly leans in for a Smooch of Victory only to Talk to the Hand.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Buffy falls on top of Spike at the end of his "Rest in Peace" song in "Once More, With Feeling"; given Buffy's reluctance to acknowledge the UST between them, she responds by fleeing. In the next episode, Buffy states that she'll never touch Spike again, only to immediately throw herself on top of him to save Spike from a hurled wooden stake.
    -   In Season 7 Buffy is using Spike for a demonstration on how to fight a vampire and she ends up on top of him again. Noting the obvious UST between these supposed Just Friends, the Potentials ask if they're supposed to be making out with the vampires they fight.
    -   At the start of Season 3, Xander and Cordelia are eager to see each other again, but quickly revert to their usual squabbling. That night a vampire leaps onto Xander, knocking him to the ground. Upon seeing Xander in distress, Cordelia's scorn immediately turns to concern, and she dogpiles on the vampire from behind, so the vamp is sandwiched between Xander on the bottom and Cordelia on the top. With Cordelia's weight on top of him, the vampire can't hold back Xander's stake any longer, and he explodes into ashes. Cordelia falls down on top of Xander. The two of them look at each other for an instant, then grab each other and start kissing passionately with appropriate cheesy music.
-   The _Community_ episode "Basic Rocket Science" does this twice as the rocket simulator swerves around: first played straight with Britta colliding into Troy, then parodied with Pierce colliding into Jeff.
-   _Cowboy Bebop_. During a Whole Episode Flashback of how Spike fell in love with Julia, the latter is showing Spike how to dance. However it's a line dance rather than a Dance of Romance, until someone accidently knocks Julia into Spike's arms. They quickly seperate given that Julia is dating Spike's best friend at the time.

Clara gets the bustle of her Pimped-Out Dress caught climbing out the window while escaping from the Monster of the Week, gets yanked out by the Doctor and ends up falling on top of him. His immediate suggestion that she Take Off Your Clothes in no way helps lower the UST.
    -   "The Halloween Apocalypse" has the falling-on-a-mattress-together version, with the Thirteenth Doctor and Yasmin Khan.
-   _Farscape_
    -   Happens often enough with John Crichton and Aeryn Sun that they remark on it in the DVD commentary. In "The Flax", John lands on top of Aeryn after the ship has a collision, prompting her to joke: "Comfortable? Can I get you a pillow?"
    -   In "PK Tech Girl", Sebacean technician Gilina is thrown backwards into John Crichton, and then comments that humans and Sebaceans really are similar all the way around.
    -   At the end of "Picture if You Will" when D'Argo pulls Chiana out of Maldis's illusion they fall over and land with Chiana lying on top of D'Argo. It's one of several Ship Tease moments they had around this time before finally hooking up a few episodes later.
-   Averted on _Firefly_ when Kaylee pushes Wash out of the way of gunfire and lands on top of him. He's married, she's interested in someone else, and there is no full body shot emphasizing the fact that she's lying on top of him - merely shocked facial expressions which are pretty clearly about the gunfire, not their position.
-   _Friends_: Rachel gets distracted while helping Monica learn to rollerskate which means Monica crashes into her. They end up on the ground, Rachel lying flat with Monica on top of her and both of them moaning. At that moment, Joey walks out of Central Perk and lets out a delighted "Oh my".
-   _Get Smart_. Maxwell Smart is doing an Emergency Impersonation of the King of Coronia.

    -   Gwen and Arthur end up this way at the start of season two.
    -   A lot later in the show, Percival finds himself on top of Gwaine.
-   _Personal Taste_. While Jin Ho and Gae In are on the bus together, the vehicle makes an unexpected brake. Gae In falls and Jin Ho puts his hands out to support her, only for his hands to end up on her butt. Gae In’s following anger isn’t helped by the fact that she thinks Jin Ho was ogling her.
-   Mocked in an early episode of _Scrubs_ when JD is running down the hallway to answer a page and runs into Laverne, which results in this:
    
    **Laverne:** _\[lying motionless underneath him\]_ Are you planning on making this worth my while?  
    **JD:** _\[removes his head from her bosom and scurries off\]_
    
-   _Stargate SG-1_:

-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_. In "Dagger of the Mind", Captain Kirk is embarrassed to realise the pretty officer beaming down with him is someone he had a one-night stand with after a staff Christmas party.

At one point Harry yanks Seven away from an exposed conduit, then realises he's got his hands all over the Ms. Fanservice of the Delta Quadrant. When he tries to ask her out on a date however, Seven shuts him down quickly by asking Do You Want to Copulate?.
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise_ invokes the Marshmallow Hell variant with Capt. Archer and T'Pol in "Shadows of P'Jem". Many Trekkies loudly condemned the scene, while the rest silently wished they were Scott Bakula. (While others got the joke that the scene was in part a lampshading of the infamous industrial-strength brassieres many female cast members on Trek had to wear under their costumes.)
-   Also happens in a _Torchwood_ flashback, between Jack and Ianto.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The edition of _TNA iMPACT_ in which Talia Madison and Angel Williams were renamed after porn stars was also the edition they lost to ODB in a three-way dance in which the winning fall came from ODB performing a Lou Thesz press that saw her breasts go into one of their faces.

    Video Games 

-   In _Devil Survivor 2_, the first time you use the Terminal, you have a minor Teleporter Accident and wind up several feet in the air.

Rean gets slapped of course. It happens again in _Cold Steel III_ with Kurt Vander and Juna Crawford after falling down another trap door. Rean, who is now an instructor and is Older and Wiser, actually managed to warn his students to get their balance although he grimaces at the Call-Back after seeing both Juna and Kurt's position.
-   Happens twice in _Little Busters!_, both involving Thanks for the Mammary. The first time is in Mio's route when she tries to run away in shock at stumbling upon what seems to be a yaoi scene she was 'invited to join', with Riki accidentally knocking her over in his haste to catch up and accidentally falling on her chest. The second time involves Haruka and is much smaller, with no CG, and just involves Riki slipping on a magazine in her room and falling onto her. Haruka is much more receptive than Mio, though to be fair they were already dating by that point.
-   _Mass Effect: Andromeda_: Peebee's Establishing Character Moment has her tackling into Ryder to stop them from activating a dangerous machine... and promptly landing on them in such a way that it looks she's riding their crotch. The shit-eating grin on her face afterwards indicates she knows _exactly_ how it looked.

-   _Riviera: The Promised Land_, Cierra's first meeting with Ein is by landing on his face. If you choose a certain choice afterward, every other girl agrees that Ein is a pervert and lose some love points.
-   _Skies of Arcadia: Legends_: Seen during the escape from Dangral Island, when Vyse leaps from the monorail, just as it collapses from beneath him, and lands on top of Aika. They not only remain in said position, but Aika's gaze is also set squarely on Vyse the entire time, and she doesn't object.
-   Two of Pyrrha's throws result in this in _Soul Calibur V_. One of her throws involve her pulling in her opponent and losing her balance, resulting in not only her opponent falling onto her sword but also falling face first into her chest. A second throw involves her jumping butt first onto her opponent, ending with her butt on their face.
-   Happens for no particularly good reason between Jin and Asuka in the latter's ending for the fifth _Tekken_ game. Even odder because the two characters are cousins (though they probably do not know it).

    Webcomics 

-   _The Beginning After the End_: In an original scene, Tessia ends up pinning Arthur to the ground after he playfully teases her about how they first met.
