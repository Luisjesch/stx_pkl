In media, characters who have just bathed or showered will often wrap themselves in towels to preserve their modesty, even if there is no one else around. This is often done to show that a character has been interrupted while or shortly after they were bathing, as they had no time to get properly dressed yet. Towels are also common attire in public baths, locker rooms, spas, and saunas. But while wearing a towel in Truth in Television, it's far less common in Real Life than media portrays, as people usually prefer the more reliable and modest bathrobes. As such, towels in media are often done to invoke fanservice.

Men will wear the towel wrapped around the waist hanging from their hips, while women will wear it wrapped around the torso hanging from their bust. This conveniently covers any body parts Moral Guardians might find objectionable, but is often Truth in Television just out of practicality: the towel wards off a potential chill and soaks up any water left remaining on the skin after bathing, plus those who are accustomed to covering themselves while others are around will often do so out of habit, even if they are alone. The differences in how males and females wear it probably stems as much from men and women having different places to hang their towels as their having different places that might require covering. Even more practical, those with long hair often wrap a towel turban-style around it.

Towels on men will be very low to best show their bare pectorals, while women will wear them with an Impossibly-Low Neckline to show off cleavage but also have them short on the waist for maximum leg exposure. This also follows the Theiss Titillation Theory, as it will be immediately clear that the towel is the _only_ thing being worn, and it is in constant danger of slipping loose and falling off or being snagged away, a possibility that can be made even more imminent if the wearer makes a sudden movement or reaches for something, usually when surprised or when put in some kind of action sequence. If the towel _does_ slip, the wearer will likely have a Naked Freak-Out and resort to Hand-or-Object Underwear to maintain some measure of modesty/dignity. Often, a towel actually serves as the "Object Underwear" for a character that has been caught while they were bathing. It can also be used in conjunction with Dress Hits Floor (when a character purposefully drops their towel) and Sexy Coat Flashing (when a character opens their towel to flash someone).

Wearing a towel can also be a subtle way of implying intimacy between two people, serving as a form of Sex Dressed. A common situation is a third party assuming the two characters have been intimate upon when finding one of them in a towel, even if the situation is actually innocent.

A common gag is for a character to wear one even when they shouldn't have anything to hide such as a Half-Dressed Cartoon Animal. Another common gag is to show effeminate males wearing their towels in the feminine style. However, as towels are often just worn for practicality, both situations actually make sense. In stark contrast, female characters _can_ wear their towels in the masculine way (or a mock-up of that way, which has one towel around the breasts and another wrapped at the waist, baring the midriff), but this is impractical and does not preserve modesty, so this would pretty much only be for fanservice.

In televised anime, towels are often used to censor scenes like bathing, in which the characters really should be naked. When a towel appears in the localization that wasn't there in the original, it's a form of Digital Bikini. Many Video Games also feature towels as unlockable costumes, sometimes as purely cosmetic outfit, sometimes as an equipable item with actual stats.

See Censor Steam and Censor Suds for another common form of bathtime censorship. Related to the Modesty Bedsheet, with characters wrapping themselves up in a sheet to preserve their modesty in a similar manner, though that trope is far less likely to occur in Real Life.

    Advertising 

-   A Flash cartoon advertisement for Monsavon Smoothie Care shower gel which can be seen here has a mother and daughter doing a dance in modesty towels.<small>◊</small> With the last image, the towels fall.<small>◊</small>
-   Isaiah Mustafa of the _The Man Your Man Could Smell Like_ Old Spice adverts is known for wearing one. It's all he wears in the personalized Youtube response videos, and even mentions that the only way to do community service is in a towel. Eventually, it changes since whenever he changes the scene, he wears new clothes as the situation demands. But never a shirt.
-   Many spoofs of advertisements featuring towel-only clad models have appeared through the years. However, North Scott High School in Eldridge, Iowa, took this a step farther in the spring of 2002 when members of the school newspaper, _The Lance_, published a "centerfold" featuring students — including several 18-year-old male and female students — dressed minimally, including some girls wrapped only in towels. Related pictures (which also appeared in a "minimal clothing calendar") appeared on the April 25, 2002, issue's back page. The student editor told the _Moline Daily Dispatch_ that his staff had gotten the idea from reading ads for such items as perfume and shaving cream in magazines that circulated at the school's library. The resulting newspaper gained noteriety in the community for several days as several conservative-minded community members expressed their concern about the morality of the feature and, despite the absence of outright nudity and a disclaimer that the students _were_ dressed, the fact that child pornography had inadvertently been published. (All of the students pictured in the issue were seniors, but the worry was that some had yet to turn 18.)
-   A woman is painting a naked male model wearing only a towel over certain parts you can't show on TV, and she is even painting the towel on the portrait, but her biggest concern was the problem the model had, a discolored toenail. (This was, of course, an ad for a toenail fungus treatment.) If she wanted not to show that, why didn't she just have him wear a bathing suit or underpants?
-   In a commercial for _Bad Company_, Chris Rock ends up pulling the same gag as _James Bond_ in _The Man with the Golden Gun_, below.
-   Subverted in this Diet Rite commercial. In the locker room a football player wraps his towel around his neck instead to the delight of the female reporter.
-   This Proactiv commercial features Olivia Munn materializing out of nowhere to the shock of a young man in a towel to tell him that Proactiv will clear up his face quicker than the cleanser he was about to use. His towel falls, of course, and Munn tries to back out of the room.
-   Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes, which has aired its "surprise" presentations of $1 million checks on live television (usually on Super Bowl Sunday), once caught a 21-year-old girl wrapped in nothing but a towel answering the door of a winner.

All while still wearing only a towel.

And she wasn't even naked under the towel! She just got her hair wet and wrapped the towel over her clothes.
-   _Hajime no Ippo_: Ippo wears one around his waist when he first showers with the guys simply because he's Shower Shy. Takamura mistakes this for size insecurity and removes it for giggles- which is how he discovered Ippo's actually a "heavyweight".
-   There's a short Super-Deformed Hot Springs Anime Special for _Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 3_ that features Modesty Towels; and apparently it's entirely possible to _swim underwater freely_ while wrapped in these. Also, considering the nature of the _Haruka_ franchise, had the special not been drawn in the Super-Deformed style, it probably would've been much more valuable in terms of Fanservice...
-   In _HappinessCharge Pretty Cure!_, the Cures wear color-coded fabric resembling a towel during transformation sequences to preserve their modesty. When forced to detransform, they wear this "towel" instead of their normal clothes, so it could be considered to act as a modesty towel.

-   _How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend_: Episode 10 has Tomoya's cousin Michiru walking around his house in the buff except for her panties and a towel around her neck, with the danglings ends that just barely cover up her breasts. At the end of the episode, the situation is inversed when he steps out of the shower in a towel and hears Michiru playing a song on her guitar and walks up to her to listen. Shortly after she finishes, his towel falls off and we're left with her awkwardly staring right at his crotch before fading to credits.

-   In the _Love Hina_ manga, characters are normally naked when in the hot springs, while in the anime, they are often wrapped in towels. Evidently, even the Barbie-doll bodies of the manga are too risqué for anime.
-   _Lupin III: Episode 0: First Contact_: Fujiko takes a shower in Jigen's apartment, comes out in just a towel, and tries to seduce him by leaning over to show her generous cleavage off, and then when he ignores that, starts to drop the towel. He uses the barrel of his magnum to hold it on her body while simultaneously threatening to shoot her if she tries that again. This is also an Establishing Character Moment for Jigen, as he is the only one consistently unaffected by Fujiko's feminine wiles.
-   _Lupin III: Travels of Marco Polo – Another Page_: During Hiromi's Furo Scene, her bustline is covered by Censor Steam while the lower half is covered by a Modesty Towel.
-   Present on every character during the Hot Springs Episode of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_, though absent... everywhere else.

When Nekomaru uses one of his nine lives to revive him, Ryunosuke is now in a female body. A _rather shapely_ female body that causes the boys in the bathhouse to get quite distracted, especially since his Modesty Towel was only covering his lower half, giving them all an eyeful when he stands up.
-   _Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse_: Yui wears one in episode 19, but its because she wasn't told to bring a swimsuit like the other women were. Inia and Cryska also have one, but at least in Inia's case, she chose not to bring it. All three of them either get the towel taken away, or it falls off them when they go in the hot springs.
-   Censor Steam aside, this was quite common in Akamatsu's next work, the anime version of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, also done by Xebec. In the manga, however...
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_:
    -   Rei wears one when Shinji goes to visit her apartment for a delivery, as she just finished showering at the time. Unfortunately, it falls to the floor when Shinji trips and falls on her... but being an Emotionless Girl, Rei barely reacts, despite Shinji's utter embarrassment.

After having Shinji swear that he absolutely won't peek, Mana comes out of the bathroom in a towel and, similarly to Asuka, asks if he wants to look before taking off the towel... but unlike Asuka, Mana is not baiting him but is _actually naked_. We don't get to see Shinji's reaction, only hear it - but Mana finds it amusing enough to laugh for the rest of the scene as the camera rapidly pans over her still frame, with a corner of the towel censoring her crotch (and Censor Steam over her breasts, though the latter is absent from the version in the visual novel's bonus materials).
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Used after Luffy defeated Crocodile while everyone is in their own gender baths. Gets averted when the guys are looking over at the girls and Nami decides to give them what she liked to call: Happiness... PUNCH! Made funnier by Vivi's horrified expression at Nami when she does this.
    -   Many chapters later, Robin wears one she has taken a bath with Momonosuke and goes outside to ask for Momonosuke's kimono.
    -   Oddly enough, Brook has been known to do this, despite being a skeleton and thus having nothing to hide.

-   _Persona 3: The Movie_: Just like in the game, all the guys are wearing these in Hot Springs Episode. This is played for faux drama when they realize the girls are coming to bathe and they have to leave without them noticing, but Junpei loses his Modesty Towel in the stream while they were swimming underwater. He invokes I Will Only Slow You Down but his fellow male teammates don't want to leave him behind. Their conversation drew the attention of the girls, followed by the guys's "Execution".

-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_ has this trope a few times:
    -   First in Chapter 5, Fuutarou enters the Nakano apartment to retrieve his wallet, and finds Nino in a towel drying her hair on the couch. She doesn't recognize him immediately due to not wearing her contacts and first thinks he's Miku.
    -   Later, in Chapter 34, Fuutarou enters the apartment and sees one of the quintuplets in a towel, who tosses him a bag calling him "pervert". He doesn't identify her immediately because she was also wearing a towel in her head (thus covering her hair), and the next chapter is about finding out who it was (it was Ichika).
    -   Reversed in Chapter 43. After having a Shower of Angst at Nino's hotel and telling her about his encounter with "Rena", he comes out of the bathroom wearing only a towel around the waist. Nino freaks out, but he calls it even because he already saw her the same way.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   While the title character really couldn't care less about being seen naked as a girl\], Akane will wrap her in a towel anyway. Even if there's nobody but girls in the room. Left to his own devices Ranma wraps the towel around his hips male-style regardless of his current form. Towels get a lot of use since Ranma's Gender Bender curse is triggered by hot and cold water.
    -   Akane herself dons the Modesty Towel quite a bit.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_ has these for all the guys during the Hot Springs Epic Battle in the OAV. Much to the fangirls' disappointment.

Tsukune gets a violent Nosebleed at the sight as Kurumu has a Naked Freak-Out.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Used in the Hot Springs Episode of the first season. Shingo is wearing one, female-style and embarrassed about bathing with his family. When Usagi teases him about it, he retaliates by stealing hers and leaving Usagi naked.
    -   Used in one episode of _Sailor Moon Stars_. When Seiya is hanging out at Usagi's house while her parents are out (it's completely innocent, don't look at me like that...), Chibi-Chibi spills cake all over him, so he uses her shower to clean himself up while his clothes are being washed. Meanwhile, the other girls show up... just in time for him to come out of the shower in what appears to be the tiniest towel on the face of the earth, asking where his clothes are. Then Chibi-Chibi complains that he's using her towel and proceeds to do her best to get it away from him. Hilarity Ensues.

When he comes back to take her prisioner, a towel is all he allows her to wear as he disposed of all her clothing, since her security pass was incorporated into her uniform, and depriving her of it leaves her dependent on Ralph. When she manages to flee from her the ship via an escape pod, she's still only clad in the towel and the heroes make fun of her when they arrest her, much to her continued humiliation.
-   _Soul Eater_: In episode 12, The rest of the gang meet at Soul and Maka's pad for the first time when Ms. Fanservice Blair suddenly walks in wearing nothing but a towel, which falls off as she strikes a pose, giving them a Naked First Impression and causing the guys to stare.

    -   In _Tales of Xillia 2_ the animated Hot Springs Episode has all the characters wearing one while bathing.
    -   In _Tales of Zestiria_, the party has a Hot Springs Episode while visiting the inn, with one event CG showing the boys dressed in towels at the sauna, while another event CG shows the girls are bathing in the hot springs in their towels.

The dialogue makes it pretty clear the character actually _aren't_ wearing towels with many having a Naked Freak-Out over the body swap, and their modesty is concealed instead with Censor Steam, Scenery Censor or Shoulders-Up Nudity. But after the event, all the characters gain "Hot Spring" costumes that are all Modesty Towels. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   _Yakuza_:
    -   _Yakuza 2_: One scene has Kiryu coming to Serena, only to find Kaoru wearing nothing but a Modesty Towel after helping herself to a shower closeby. She even casually drops the towel to get dressed while he's still in the room. He's obviously awkward the whole time.
    -   _Yakuza 6_: The first time Kiryu goes to confront Takumi Someya, the latter is relaxing in the sauna of a hotel, wearing nothing but a towel. Before the fight can actually start, however, Someya throws said towel in Kiryu's face as a distraction and scampers back to his suite to put something on while leaving his guards in Kiryu's path. By the time Kiryu catches up to him, he's just managed to put on a pair of athletic briefs. Notably, Someya's lack of clothes is also used dramatically, since it shows that he has no _irezumi_ on his back despite being a high-ranking yakuza.

She has pretty much given up on the pretense when an _actual_ assassin shows up.
-   "Around the Universe in a Bath Towel" is the fourth _Girls in Space_ story. Scarlet "Red" Macrumble spends almost the entire story wearing only a towel.
-   On page 306 of _Girls Next Door_, Jareth inverts this trope. While a Modesty Towel is usually used to... well, preserve one's modesty, Jareth uses it as an opportunity to blatantly invoke a Shirtless Scene. This is made even more egregious by the fact that Jareth can (and frequently _does_) magically poof into different outfits—he has no _need_ to **ever** be only partly dressed. Also, the towel he wears seems to be a hand towel, not a bath towel.
    
    **Sarah:** ...Jareth we don't even own a towel that small.
    
-   Instinctively wrapping her towel girl-style is just one of the things programmed into Roxanne the Gender Bent cheerleader by _The Good Witch_ along with a full set of cheer routines, causing Roxanne some cognitive dissonance and making her wonder if any other parts of her brain were affected by her transformation.

    In sauna you're supposed to be naked, but let's keep this comic worksafe.
    
-   _Magick Chicks_ is rated PG-13 like its parent comic, _Eerie Cuties_ (see above), and also uses bath towels to preserve that rating. As seen here, for example, when Faith steps out of the shower to check on Sandi's progress with the wand.
-   In _MeatShield_, it's more like Modesty Blankets for Jaine and Dhur after they get mugged.
-   _Megatokyo_: In strip 1319, Miho and Piro are in a Public Bathhouse when Miho nonchalantly starts stripping in front of Piro so they can talk while they're bathing.

Later when they're done talking, Miho covers herself back in a towel as she walks out, but she also ends up getting into a quick Bathroom Brawl with Yuki and seemingly loses both towels offscreen.

-   In _White Noise_ (not the one that has a trope page), Teige wears his modesty towel female style. He also wears a tight, cropped undershirt reminiscent of a sports bra in his human disguise. It's foreshadowing the eventual reveal that he's transgender.
