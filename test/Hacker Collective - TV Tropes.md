In Real Life as well as fiction, there are Mad Scientists, hackers and crackers, white hats and black hats who can penetrate the firewall(s) of everything from the local high school to the Pentagon, to even terrorists and cults with little more than a keyboard (or two) and their own l33t skillz. They are usually depicted as loners in their Hacker Cave.

Sometimes however, one hacker just isn't enough. Sometimes, they find each other, come together, pool resources and accomplish what no lone hacker (or Hackette) can achieve on their own. Compare Playful Hacker and The Singularity. Contrast Dueling Hackers and Rival Science Teams.

    -   In season three, Everyone undergoes what one member refers to as a "civil war".

Zaxon is one of the most prominent and led by the mysterious Yuugo, who aims to unite all the hackers in EDEN and investigate Kamishiro Enterprises (the provider of EDEN). There is also Demons, an evil group led by Jimmy KEN, a wild rock star; one plot point has the protagonist stop them from stealing accounts.
    -   In _Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory_, the player character has his account stolen by a hacker and he joins a hacker group called Hudie, which answers to Zaxon, to find the culprit and clear his name.

They also send information to both players of _Project Legacy_ and Desmond in _Brotherhood_ by giving him passwords to the other Assassins' email accounts so that he can monitor their exchanges on his own terms.

    Webcomics 

-   The "Sympathetic Party" who offers to help restore Bubbles' sealed memories in _Questionable Content_ is an A.I. version of this, with Word of God confirming that several of them share the physical body they appear in at one time (thus the Ambiguous Gender of the chassis and use of "they" as a personal pronoun). They offer to help Bubbles no strings attached but apparently aren't always so benevolent.

    Real Life 

-   Anonymous almost certainly qualifies. They have made something of a name for themselves by public actions like DDOSing and/or defacing the websites of Daesh and other organizations they disapprove of. Their symbols include Guy Fawkes masks and a man with a question mark for a head.
