Aside from the Farm Boy or Ordinary High-School Student, few characters are more likely to be the hero or heroine of a story than a beautiful princess. Fairy Tales, Fantasy stories, and stories aimed at children are all highly likely to feature a princess in a leading role. Likely due to the fact that little girls love princesses.

The singular role of princesses as main characters has endured despite the decline of the aristocracy and changing gender roles. Older iterations of the character were commonly the demure and pure Princess Classic, but later versions moved to Spirited Young Lady and Rebellious Princess interpretations that made princesses more active players. Often, works combine the princess role with more modern female archetypes by making her a Tomboy Princess, Politically-Active Princess, or an Action Girl Pretty Princess Powerhouse.

Common plotlines involve a princess trying to regain her rightful throne, find her One True Love (often Prince Charming), struggle against an evil queen, or defy an unwanted Arranged Marriage. More modern or fantasy versions may put her as a Damsel out of Distress or a Benevolent Mage Ruler fighting to protect her kingdom from the Evil Overlord.

Because Princesses Prefer Pink, the Princess Protagonist is often also a Pink Heroine.

Works featuring The Chief's Daughter as a heroine also count for this. May overlap with Ruler Protagonist if Princesses Rule.

Contrast Save the Princess, an Excuse Plot where the princess is a Hostage MacGuffin whose personality or even status as a princess is rarely important. May overlap with Gratuitous Princess, where the character's princess-ness isn't relevant to the story or setting.

See also Princess Stories, which often feature this trope.

The series is also famous for postulating that all girls are princesses but there aren't enough princes for everyone. Alternatively, interpretation is that both princes and princesses are childish and false ideals and that the way to grow up is to move past them.
-   _Sailor Moon_: Played with. The title character turns out to be the reincarnation of Princess Serenity, for whom everyone had been searching. In the manga and The '90s English dub of the anime, all the other senshi were reincarnated princesses, too. There's an odd aspect to this in the 90s anime, in which, whenever Usagi needs to unlock new powers or tap into the full potential of the Silver Crystal, she always transformed into _Princess_ Serenity, despite the fact that she rarely needed to do so in the manga, and after the second arc always transformed into _Neo-Queen_ Serenity when she did need to do so.

-   _Yume no Crayon Oukoku_: Princess Silver is the main character and princess of the Crayon Kingdom, who goes on a quest to find the boy Grim Reaper.
-   _Voltes V_: Halfway through the series, it's revealed that Kentaro's real identity is Prince Gohl and he is from Boazania - meaning Kenichi, Daijiro and Hiyoshi are Alien Prines. Not only that, Heinel is their half-brother, as he is the child of Gohl and his first wife, Lozaria.

    Arts 

-   _Marie de' Medici Cycle_: During the first four paintings, Marie is a French princess; then, in the fifth, she marries and becomes Queen of France. The complete series narrates her life very epically, with the constant intervention of gods.
-   _Las Meninas_: In this busy and spatially ambiguous artwork, it is the Infanta who has pride of place. The lighting and her white dress make her the most prominent character in the scene, and many of the questions surrounding the painting involve why she's looking out at the audience.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In _Donkeyskin_, after promising to marry a woman as beautiful as his dead queen, the king tries to marry his own daughter, the princess. She delays her father's insane request by asking for three wonderful dresses and the hide of the kingdom's gold-producing donkey, then becomes the titular Donkeyskin when she flees to another kingdom.

In this story, she is raped by a king and bears him twins while still asleep, before eventually waking up and marrying the king after a series of shenanigans occur.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Anastasia_: The film focuses on Anastasia, a princess in exile discovering her secret royal past. While the real Anastasia was royalty, she is recognised as "Grand Duchess" rather than princess.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  But the film frequently refers to her as a princess just to avoid confusion. In a twist, she also gives up the title and chooses to elope with Dimitri. Often confused with Disney's princesses (notably because Don Bluth was an ex-Disney animator and it shows), which became ironic when Disney came to own it after they purchased 20th Century Fox.
-   _Barbie_ : Barbie is a Princess Protagonist in about half of her movies, though often she doesn't discover this until near the end of the film (i.e. _Barbie in the Nutcracker_, _Barbie: Princess Charm School_).

When she's kidnapped, peasant girl Erika - who is inexplicably nearly identical to her - pretends to be her to buy time to rescue her (though she also hatches her own plan to escape); matters are complicated when the king Anneliese is meant to be marrying starts falling in love with Erika. Erika herself becomes a queen in the end when she marries the king.
    -   In _Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus_, the main protagonist Princess Annika sets out on a quest to save her parents and people from an evil sorcerer.

    -   In _Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses_, Princess Genevieve is one of twelve royal sisters, who have to save their kingdom from the evil Duchess Rowena.
    -   In _Barbie as the Island Princess_, it's revealed that the titual island princess Ro - in addition to marrying a prince - is the daughter of a queen from a neighboring kingdom, who was lost at sea years ago.
    -   The big reveal in _Barbie: Princess Charm School_ is that Blair is the long-lost heir to the throne of Gardenia and thus was a real princess all along.
-   The Disney Animated Canon codified the trope for animation with a number of princesses as protagonists, so much so that they got their own umbrella franchise:
    -   _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_ (1937): Princess Snow White was threatened by her Wicked Stepmother, but is saved by some dwarfs and a handsome prince.
    -   _Cinderella_ (1950): Retelling of the classic fairy tale, focusing on Cinderella's struggles with her evil stepsisters. Cinderella wasn't actually born a princess, but becomes one after marrying the handsome prince. _Cinderella II: Dreams Come True_ focuses on her life as a princess.
    -   _Sleeping Beauty_ (1959): Princess Aurora is cursed by an evil fairy, and then rescued by a handsome prince. The film largely focuses on her and her good fairy godmothers.

    -   _Pocahontas_ (1995): The real-life historical figure Princess Pocahontas is based on was not a princess, but this film gives her a princess upgrade. Pocahontas faces a political Arranged Marriage to a man she doesn't love but falls in love with outsider John Smith. She must then save her man as well as her people from a conflict between the English and her father.
    -   _The Princess and the Frog_ (2009): In the original fairy tale, the main female character is a princess, but in this film, the heroine Tiana is a commoner who dreams of owning a restaurant. She does become a princess eventually through marrying the prince, and the film is commonly considered a princess film nevertheless.
    -   _Tangled_ (2010). The story focuses on Princess Rapunzel. Due to living in a tower in the forest, she didn't know about her royal ancestry... until she gave a burglar a Tap on the Head with a frying pan, and her life changed forever. Everyone cheers when she returns to her birth parents.
    -   _Brave_ (2012): Princess Merida was the first Pixar character to be a "Disney Princess". She is something of a Rebellious Princess, refusing to marry a man just because he won a contest, which one has to admit is not a good method to find a suitable husband for your daughter. She makes everything better for the princes of the neighbouring countries, who weren't very keen on marrying a stranger because of "tradition", either.
    -   _Wreck-It Ralph_ (2012), Played With when it's revealed Vanellope is actually the ruler of the world in "Sugar Rush" after everyone in the game gets their memories back. However, after going through the whole ordeal in the movie, she decides to abdicate the throne and turn the kingdom into a democracy. This does get a cute lampshade in the second movie when she meets the rest of the Disney princesses while milling around on a Disney website.
    -   _Frozen_ (2013) and _Frozen II_ (2019). The two main characters are both princesses, though Elsa is crowned a queen very early in the first movie. The first film's story focuses on Princess Anna, who had a sheltered childhood and identifies strongly with Princess Classic archetypes, who goes on a quest to save her kingdom from her sister's magical powers as well as various hostile outsiders.
    -   _Moana_ is an unusual example in that she's technically not a princess, as she points out. Her community doesn't have a monarchy, but she is the daughter of the village chief and is expected to take on leadership roles. She also fits some Princess Classic tropes, especially Disney Princess ones, as Maui points out.
        
        **Moana:** Okay, first, I’m not a princess, I’m the daughter of the chief.  
        **Maui:** If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.
        
    -   Then there’s Kiara in _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_ though she isn’t in the Princess line due to not being human. She’s the main focus of the film and helps to end the feud between the halves of the pride.
-   _The Emoji Movie_: Jailbreak is revealed to be a former princess emoji (princess of what exactly is never revealed) but took on a disguise as she didn't want to be associated with the expected nature of the title.

-   _Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken_: The second trailer reveals that the main character is a kraken princess.
-   Very common in Studio Ghibli productions:

    -   _The Tale of the Princess Kaguya_, adapted from a Japanese folktale, tells the story of a girl who is born from a bamboo stalk.

    Films — Live-Action

In real life, she was disinherited at a young age and would not have been called a princess (she was formally styled "the Lady Elizabeth, the King's daughter"); but she was the daughter of the king and she is addressed as a princess in the film.
-   The heroine of _Enchanted_, Giselle, is an idealistic Princess Classic from a fairy-tale kingdom who is thrown into the real world of New York by an Evil Queen.

-   _Kris Longknife_: Kris ends up being dubbed a princess after convincing her great-grandfather to accept the position of King of the United Society.

The Golden Ending of the first game reveals that the player is the long-lost daughter of the king and queen. The "Star Princess" ending of the second game reveals that the player is the long-lost princess of another _planet_.
-   _Dragon Age_ has a couple of these, depending on player choices:
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, one of the possible origin stories (Dwarf Noble) is as the second child of the dwarven king; a female PC can thus be a dwarven princess.
        -   Another option is the Human Noble origin, in which the female PC is the daughter of the oldest and highest-ranked noble house in the country (second only to the royal family in precedence); her home region, Highever, is actually a principality, which means that she is technically a princess even though the family doesn't use princely titles. The female Human Noble is also the only player character who can potentially end the game by becoming queen.
    -   A female Hawke can become this in _Dragon Age II_. Hawke is not royal, but does come from a noble family in Kirkwall. If she pursues a friendship romance with Sebastian (in the DLC _The Exiled Prince_), Sebastian will eventually propose a chaste marriage, which makes Hawke the Princess of Starkhaven for the last leg of the game.
-   Princess Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca in _Final Fantasy XII_. Although Vaan is the POV character, the story clearly focuses on Ashe, and her actions drive most of the game's plot.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones_ has three princesses. One of the main characters, Eirika, is a Lady of War Princess and swordswoman from Renais. Her best friend, the Pegasus Knight Tana, is the princess of Frelia. Another friend of hers, L'Arachel, is the princess of Rausten.
    -   Lucina in _Fire Emblem: Awakening_ is the future daughter of Prince Chrom and of the three main Lords, who traveled from the past to prevent the world from falling into an apocalypse.
    -   As for _Fire Emblem Fates_, the Avatar, if female, is a princess of Hoshido raised with the royal family of Nohr. 'Princess' is even in her starting class's name! The Deuteragonist Azura is the opposite of the Avatar: a princess of Nohr raised with the royal family of Hoshido.
    -   Celica in _Fire Emblem Gaiden_ is the princess of Zofia. While she normally plays the Deuteragonist role, _Gaiden_ has a Two Lines, No Waiting structure so Celica is just as much of a main character as Alm.
    -   Edelgard plays this role in _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, but only if the Crimson Flower sub-route is chosen and she becomes the Deuteragonist. Also in her class is Petra, a princess of Brigid despite being listed as a "Commoner" in terms of class.
-   _Hyper Princess Pitch_ stars a princess, who's also a demigod apparently. Rather than concern herself with affairs of state, her only goal in life seems to be bringing an end to Christmas and causing gratuitous explosions.

    -   In _King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella_, the protagonist is Princess Rosella, an Action Girl who must find some magic fruit and defeat an evil sorceress in order to save her dying father.
