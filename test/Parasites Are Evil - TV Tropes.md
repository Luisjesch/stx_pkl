_"I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars..."_

Though undeniably horrifying and on occasion dangerous to human beings, there's nothing objectively _evil_ in what parasites or parasitoids do. Regardless of whether they control the minds of their hosts, use them as incubators for their young, simply eat them (or their nutrients) from within or just generally make their lives a little bit more uncomfortable than normal, the creature committing these acts is merely trying to survive and reproduce in much the same way as any other animal. Nearly every non-parasitic species has more than one unique parasite, and parasites outnumber free-living organisms by a vast margin. This means that the _norm_ for most Earth life is spending a part of their life cycle in or on another organism for food and shelter.

However, humans have a nasty habit of projecting their morality on the natural world, or at the very least, forgetting that Nature Is Not Nice. Consequently, parasitism in nature may be regarded as immoral and vile. Imagine someone living in your house without your consent or stealing your stuff. That's what parasites are.

Thusly, fictional parasites, parasitoids and their ilk can all too often be depicted as evil, with their need to live upon others being regarded as cruel or immoral, especially if sentient. In keeping with the Always Chaotic Evil portrayal, dysfunctional societies with lots of backstabbing and betrayals may be a possibility. If sufficiently powerful and/or intelligent, they might even qualify as the main villains of the story.

For this reason, parasites may end up becoming the exception to a hero's code against killing, even if they do qualify as sapient life forms; in extreme cases, they may even become the target of a Guilt-Free Extermination War.

**NOTE: To qualify for this trope, the parasite or parasitoid must be confirmed to be of evil origins or deliberately malevolent. An ordinary parasite simply acting in its own natural interests does _not_ count, hence No Real Life Examples, Please!**

Compare and contrast Predators Are Mean, Scavengers Are Scum, and Monstrous Germs, all similar examples of human morality being imposed on nature. Could overlap with Parasitic Immortality; after all, taking somebody's body against their will so you can live forever is pretty immoral by default. Super-Trope of Talking Pest, as parasites and pests are often characterized as malicious in pesticide ads.
