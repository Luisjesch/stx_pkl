**Digory:** I think we can get out of this place into jolly well Anywhere! We don't need to jump back into the same pool we came up by. Or at least not yet.  
**Polly:** The Wood between the Worlds. It sounds rather nice.

If you're a character in a fantasy setting, proceed with caution when approaching any large body of water. The most mundane-looking lake, spring, waterfall or well could secretly be a portal to a Magical Land. Your Breather at the local hot spring could turn dreadfully exciting without warning.

In some, you just keep falling until the water disappears and you hit solid ground — always unharmed, of course. In others, you step or fall in, go down (what are those weird lights?), turn to head back up (wasn't this _down_ a minute ago?), and find you're still in a body of water, but it's not in Kansas anymore. Such cases are not guaranteed to work both ways.

Compare Portal Picture, its oil-and-canvas counterpart. Also compare Portal Door, when doors lead to someplace non-adjacent. When the portal is actually a swirling vortex, see Mega Maelstrom. Not to be confused with No-Flow Portal, which can be about portals immersed _in_ pools, nor with the pools in _Portal_, which will cause an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record, followed by death. Nor this,<small>◊</small> as long as we're talking about _Portal._

    Fan Works 

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Turning Red_, the mirror that separates out the red panda spirit in the astral realm looks and acts like a vertical version of this.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _The Blair Witch Project_ — Ten-year-old Eileen Treacle went to the first annual Wheat Harvest Picnic near Tappy East Creek. During the picnic, Eileen wandered off to wade in ankle deep water. Eleven eye-witnesses claimed to have seen a ghostly white hand reach up out of the water and pull her in under the surface. No body was ever recovered. Later, the creek mysteriously became clogged with oily bundles of sticks, rendering the water useless for thirteen days.
-   The titular protagonist of _Constantine (2005)_ flat-out states that water "lubricates the transition between worlds" — meaning you can get there as long as you know how, but without water, it _literally_ hurts like hell.
-   Parodied rather niftily in _Deathstalker II: Duel of the Titans_. After failing to defeat the Deathstalker, one Mook contacts his master, Jarek, through a nearby boiling pond by dumping a few coins in it, which magically allows the two to view and communicate with each other (Jarek is speaking through a Magic Cauldron) as if it were some kind of magic video payphone. Jarek proceeds to off the mook for his failure by jamming his sword through his cauldron and into the mook's chest on the other side, then goes through the portal to his location to finish the job himself.
-   In _Enchanted_: a fairy-tale princess is pushed down a well and ends up in the very _un_\-magical land of modern Manhattan.

-   In _Hot Tub Time Machine_, a hot tub serves as a portal to the past.
-   The horror movie _House_ has several portals connected to one another through different parts of the house. The portal pool effect comes into play when Roger explores the abyss behind the bathroom mirror, and ends up falling into a black ocean that leads down into a river in his Vietnam-based Mental World. Diving into the river again causes him to surface in the swimming pool behind the house, which was the same Portal Pool that his son got lost in several years before.
-   In _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End_, the ocean of Davy Jones' Locker acts as a one-way Portal Pool that leads Back from the Dead, but only if you're in an upside-down boat, and only at sunset (which is sunrise in the living world). And anything that sucks you underwater from this end — waterfalls, whirlpools, humongous invertebrate cephalopods — can take you over.
    -   In _Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides_, the pool of gravity-defying water in the cave is a portal to the Fountain of Youth, although at first it looks like the pool "eats" things that touch it.
-   In _Poltergeist III_, an oil slick in a parking deck turns into a portal pool, with monstrous hands reaching out of it to abduct Carol Anne, as well as her cousin and the cousin's boyfriend. The rest of her family later finds the other two chilled to the bone but otherwise unharmed ...at least, so it seems.
-   Portal pools appear in _The Smurfs_ and _The Smurfs 2_.

    Literature 

-   In _Bones of Faerie_, Liza pulls her mother, Matthew, and Allie through the lake in Faerie to get back to their village, though the lake is only a portal because Liza has the power to turn reflective surfaces into portals (into the past, present, and future).
-   C. S. Lewis's _The Chronicles of Narnia_: The portals branching off to various worlds in The Wood Between The Worlds lie in pools scattered about the Wood. Jump into a pool, land in a world — if you have the right magic ring, that is. Pools can also lead to "empty worlds" where nothing exists yet (allowing some characters to actually witness the creation of Narnia), though the destruction of a world causes its pool to dry up (as happened with Jadis' home world in _The Magician's Nephew_).
-   To a powerful watercrafter in _Codex Alera_, any body of water becomes one of these.
-   In Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere, these are a hallmark of a Shard's invested presence in a planet. They transport a user to the Cognitive Realm, which compresses the vast distances between planets so that travellers can hike between them.

-   In _Implied Spaces_, _Pools of Life_ are pretty much equivalent to 'save points' in games — you can enter a pool to have a snapshot of your memories stored and/or your body plan altered and/or have yourself deconstructed then reassembled at another location with or without your consent.
-   In _The Iron Grail_ by Robert Holdstock, Merlin descends to the otherworldly interior of a hill (the hill fort Taurovinda) by way of a well. This is a well sacred to the Celtic god Nodons, into which offerings are placed (see Real Life section below).
-   In _The Looking-Glass Wars_ (which is based loosely on _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_), the Pool of Tears is a portal to our world and certain puddles are used to return to Wonderland.
-   In Lev Grossman's _Magicians_ trilogy (which is partly a Take That! to Narnia) the portals are fountains in an empty city.
-   In _Maybird and the Ever After_, along with the other sequels, the titular character enters the After Life through a glowing lake hidden in the woods behind her house.
-   Though not a still body of water, the River in Tad Williams' 'Otherland' series (particularly the second book, 'River of Blue Fire') is how the characters travel between different simulations in the Otherland virtual reality network.
-   Dian Curtis Regan's _Princess Nevermore_ (much like _Enchanted_) features a princess from a magical land who travels to the "real" world by way of a magical pool.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Angel jumps into an empty swimming pool in Season 2 of _Angel_ that acts a portal to another place.
-   The _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ episode "Anne" has a portal to a demon dimension where kidnapped street kids are taken to be worked to death that looks like a pool of used motor oil.
-   The eponymous _Catweazle_, a bumbling wizard, casts a spell in the 11th century to escape from invading Normans, jumps into a lake, and finds himself transported to the 20th century. He goes back in the last episode of series 1, but repeats the procedure in Series 2.
-   In _Charlie Jade_, certain people can move between alternate universes by covering themselves in water.
-   In the _Charmed (1998)_ episode "Enter the Demon", a Zen master can jump through any water surface (usually of a pool) to enter the plane of limbo.
-   Subverted in the _Doctor Who_ episode "The Curse of the Black Spot". The "siren" is initially thought to enter the ship through standing water, so everyone hides in the driest parts of the ship. She actually uses reflections to travel and she's really a misguided computer simulation doctor from an alien ship.
-   In one _Fringe_ episode set back in the 1980s, Peter Bishop, recently kidnapped from another universe, tries to invoke this trope, almost dying in progress.
-   _Ik Mik Loreland_: Mik travels from Loreland to Kratermaan by jumping into the town well and emerging from a water-filled krater on the other side. It's sort of implied that Karbonkel used his magic to create this portal.
-   The Lost World at the bottom of the waterfall in _Land of the Lost (1974)_.
-   _The Magicians (2016)_: The Neitherlands is just many fountains leading to different worlds.
-   Perhaps more a stylistic similarity than Playing with a Trope, but _Stargate SG-1_ simulates the rippling water for the Stargate. Needless to say, it _does_ take you to other planets at least. Stargates placed horizontally have a much closer resemblance.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In "The Bewitchin' Pool", the last-aired episode of the original series, two children from an affluent broken home escape through their back yard swimming pool to a rural paradise overseen by a Cool Old Lady.

-   In the highly disturbing (NSFW) music video for DyE's "Fantasy", the bottom of the swimming pool leads the protagonist to an alien dimension.
-   Invoked in the music video for _She-Ra: Princess of Power_'s "We Have The Power" song, wherein a lake of water is alluded to transport Adam to Etheria.

    Myths & Religion 

-   In Celtic Mythology, the entrance to Annwn — the Otherworld — could be located in a number of places and appeared or disappeared on a whim. One of these is a real island off of Ynys Gwales that only appears when the tide lowers in just the right way. In the Second Branch of the Mabinogion, another portal is located in a lake in Ireland. The giant Llasar Llaes Gyfnewid and his even more gigantic wife, Cymidei Cymeinfoll, emerge from here carrying the Cauldron of Rebirth.
-   In Mayan Mythology, the Xibalba was a gloomy, watery underworld inspired by the cenotes that lead to flooded underground caves that dot the Yucatan peninsula. These cenotes were believed to be portals to Xibalba, and offerings were thrown into some.
-   Celtic and other British isles tribes believed that lakes and other bodies of water were portals to the spirit world. Archaelogists occasionally encounter finds of worked silver cauldrons, containing many valuable artifacts, that were deliberately dropped in lakes or bogs as offerings. Both cauldrons and lakes also pop up frequently in the preserved Celtic and Welsh legends that have survived to today as portals to the underworld.

    Video Games 

-   In _Age of Mythology_ the Well of Urd, is one of the many ways of reaching the underworld that you encounter through the game, and the one you use in the nordic campaign.
-   In _Alan Wake_, Cauldron Lake is a portal to the Dark Place.
-   _Clive Barker's Undying_ uses an enchanted pool to teleport the player between the modern-day ruins of an ancient monastery, and the medieval monastery itself. Bonus points for each side of the pool reflecting the other: in the present day, the pool's reflection shows the past, and vice versa.
-   Not exactly the same thing, but old-school hilarious adventure game _Eric the Unready_ featured a magical banana which could be summoned out of any body of water by speaking a magic word.
-   The Jade Passage in _Final Fantasy II_.
-   _For the King_'s Unlockable Content includes Alluring Pools that serve as a Warp Whistle. One is generated in each map biome, allowing a player character to enter and emerge from any other Pool they've already discovered.
-   Your first trip through one in _The Game of the Ages_ kills you if you lack protection. You later find two further pools.
-   Sort of present in _Half-Life_. Glowing pools in the "border-world" Xen are capable of literally teleporting you from alien point to alien point.
-   While not literal, Sora's dream sequence in the beginning of _Kingdom Hearts_ evokes the same sort of imagery as he plummets into the ocean and lands in a surreal, foreshadowing, tutorial sequence. It also happens to Roxas and Ventus in the opening movie cutscenes for _Kingdom Hearts II_ and _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_ respectively.
-   This sets the plot in motion for _King's Quest VII_, as the pond in the Daventry castle gardens somehow magically transports Rosella and Valanice to the realm of Eldritch.
-   The _Lunar_ series employs this with Springs of Transmission which teleport the player between locations. _Lunar: Eternal Blue_ even involves discovering that the huge star-shaped pool in front of the palace in Pentagulia is a Spring of Transmission in disguise, with the alien demi-goddess/love interest blasting the railing off the balcony and leaping in, followed by the rest of your party.
-   In _Neverwinter Nights_, a pool in Neverwinter Wood allows access to the realm in which the forest's guardian spirit dwells. Rather than simply jumping in, however, the player must acquire a special knife and then it _stab it into his/her own heart_ while kneeling therein.
-   _Ōkami_: The Mermaid Pools serve as the game's Warp Whistle. You need to toss a Mermaid Coin into it to enable the portal, but a secret brush technique unlocked in Dragon Palace allows you to enable it without tossing anything.
-   _Super Mario 64_:
    -   The entrance to the Hazy Maze Cave and Dire Dire Docks (in this case a vertical wall of water).
    -   The entrance to the Metal Cave in Hazy Maze Cave, which turns out to be behind the suspicious waterfall outside the castle.

    Webcomics 

-   Alice from _Cheshire Crossing_ uses mirrors as portals to Wonderland, but once used a puddle of water as a mirror.
-   _Erma_: Erma and her mother, as Stringy-Haired Ghost Girls, can use disconnected pools of water as portals to quickly travel from one place to the next, including kitchen sinks, though this can result in unexpected messes.
-   _Waterworks_: The "Spatial Transport" ability of Slick's suit allows him to use any puddle as a portal to any other puddle. "Spatial Transport II" extends this to any body of water.

    Web Original 

-   _SCP Foundation_ has SCP-354, a lake filled with a red fluid. If you lock yourself into a submarine and keep going down, and down, and down, the fluid will keep getting thicker and thicker... until you finally reach a whole new world.
    
    -   They also have SCP-120, a pool that cycles through 11 different destinations. To choose a particular destination, Class D personnel have to be used. Why? Five of the eleven destinations are the Lagrange points. Which are in space. And the pool only works with living, awake humans.
    
    This destination is on a relatively flat section of the Sea of Rains on the lunar surface. Through vast expenditure of money and D-class personnel, a small outpost has been established there, and is considered one of the Foundation's safest locations.
    
-   Subverted in a _Choose Your Own Adventure_ article on Magicthegathering.com. In it you journey through the horrible world of Shadowmoor, a Bizarro World of the idyllic world Lorwyn. At one point you encounter a pond in a cave and the description suggests it might be a portal pool to Lorwyn. If you enter it however, you are promptly ripped apart by vicious Merrows, and the game calls you a naive idiot.

    Western Animation 

-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_, "Operation P.O.O.L.": In fact, in this episode, any swimming pool combined with the proper Applied Phlebotinum can become a portal between the real world and the Mirror Universe.
-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_: "Queen of the Black Puddle" featured a sea witch of sorts who used puddles of rainwater to transport back and forth in between her magical lair, to which she tried to lure Eustace so she could eat him.
-   The _Cow and Chicken_ episode "The Laughing Puddle": people are disappearing one by one into a creepy laughing puddle, until Chicken is the only one remaining. With great trepidation he jumps inside — and lands in a bar where Boneless Chicken is doing a stand-up (pun definitely not intended) show.
-   _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ parodies the Twilight Zone episode in "Puddle Jumpers", when Grim's scythe turns Billy's inflatable pool into a "cosmic sinkhole" that leads to several different worlds, including a bayou inhabited by a kindly old grandmother... except she wants to bake Billy into a pie.
-   Peter Potamus' hot tub in _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_ somehow turns into a portal to prehistory.
-   In _The Owl House_, a journal of a long-lost researcher who is also a human who was transported to the Boiling Isles long before the protagonist Luz was describes "wild portals" between realms that form when Titan's Blood, an extremely powerful magical substance, leaks into pools of water. It's how Philip first traveled to the Isles.
    -   On a smaller note, Darius the head witch of the Abomination Coven demonstrates the ability to use said creations to teleport individuals, such as sending the B.A.T.T.s from the woods to a cell in the Conformatorium.
