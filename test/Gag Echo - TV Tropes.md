A subtrope of Meaningful Echo, the Gag Echo is a pretty common trope in fiction and although it's found in works outside the comedy genre, it's always Played for Laughs. The line of dialogue will often appear in the form of a Brick Joke, but it can pop up pretty soon after the first line. Usually the line will be repeated by another character and part of the fun comes from them not knowing someone else has already said the same thing. It can overlap with the Ironic Echo but differs from that since the Ironic Echo isn't usually played for comedy and the Gag Echo doesn't need the irony. May also overlap with Strange Minds Think Alike.

Compare Ironic Echo Cut when something like this happens straight away as a cut to another scene.

-   _Ascendance of a Bookworm_: Myne, the protagonist, is a modern-day bookworm who reincarnated as a poor girl in a world that is in its pre-printing press era and has a large price tag even on materials used to make books. As a result, books are luxury items that only the wealthiest can afford. Some time after having introduced cheaper to produce plant-based paper to her new world, Myne finds out someone she knows is to going to have a baby and decides to make a picture book for the child. The reactions of Myne's best friend who helped make her first batch of paper, the merchant selling said paper and Myne's mentor in a job she took for easy access to the town's only library to the notion of a picture book are all similarly bemused in the source material. In the anime's Compressed Adaptation, those reactions are all shown in a small montage that is followed by Myne internally reponding to her mentor's words with the feeling she's hearing an echo.

-   _8 Simple Rules_:
    -   The episode "Secrets" makes a Running Gag out of the family lying about who's on the phone, saying it's someone selling long distance. Then someone selling long distance actually calls.

(despite being **on the radio**) and when she reads the review it says "Lisa is an entertaining reporter and a classy dresser". Slater is awful on the radio and the gang are wondering how they tell him and Screech suggests "wave a skunk in front of his nose". Guess what the review says about Slater.
-   The _Saved by the Bell: The New Class_ episode "Private Peterson" has this line: "I was born on a cold October day." Mr. Belding says this sentence earlier in the episode when Nicky expresses interest in becoming a school principal, leading to Mr. Belding taking Nicky into his office, which results in a Nap-Inducing Speak for Nicky. Near the end of the episode, Liz asks Mr. Belding how he became a principal, and Mr. Belding utters the sentence again while escorting Liz into his office, heavily implying that he would give her the same speech that he delivered to Nicky earlier.

    -   The _Angel_ episode "Lonely Hearts" makes a Running Gag out of people not knowing what the logo on the Angel Investigations business card is (it's meant to be an angel). When Angel hands Kate a card at the end of the episode she says "What is this? A duck?
    -   The _Firefly_ episode "Jaynestown" opens with Kaylee and Simon bantering about whether or not Simon uses profanity.

Guess what Simon does upon seeing a statue of Jayne standing in the town square on Higgins' Moon.
-   During the second-season episode "Me And Mr. Joad" in _Boy Meets World_, when Mr. Turner learning that Feeny lives next door to the Matthews:

    **Amy**: It's not something we brag about.
    
    **Turner**: (heading outside) George? You live next door to Matthews?
    
    **Feeny**: It's not something I brag about.
