_Beyond Reality_, Freydoon Rassouli

_"Ours is the wisdom to weave the fabric of reality... Ours is the power to create!"_

The power to create. That marvelous ability to make something under your own power.

It can go one of two ways in fiction. The first and more frequent type is simply having the power to take something (a basic material like atoms, dirt, rock, Mana, etc.) and create something else with it (a more complex object). The other version has the character make something out of thin air, or, more accurately, nothing. The created object in question may be permanent or temporary, depending on the character's ability and/or intention. Likewise, the scale, complexity, and other traits of what was created varies as well.

More advanced users may also be able to create life, which might or might not make the character a Mook Maker.

Contrast The Power of the Void. Compare and contrast the Reality Warper, whose power is "merely" altering realty, rather than adding to it. Though there is some overlap if the Reality Warper can shape reality into more complex structures, or make it whole cloth for those who are exceptionally powerful. An Imagination-Based Superpower is closely related to this one. Often the mark of a god. The Maker always exhibits this as well (they "make" after all). Often related to The Power of Language.

Please note: This is only for people who have this as a power. Someone who creates something in a mundane fashion may have access to a Matter Replicator.

    Anime and Manga 

-   The most powerful Rewriting Reality character in _Princess Tutu_ is able to make characters spring out of existence through his stories.
-   The thing that distinguishes _Haruhi Suzumiya_ from Yuki and other Data Entities is that she can create data (which translates to physical matter and energy) from nothing, while they can only alter existing data. So she's a Reality Warper with The Power of Creation.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has the Lifemaker, former leader of Cosmo Entelecheia. Also known as "The Mage of the Beginning", his known accomplishments include creating Fate Averruncus, fathering the Ostian royal family millenia ago, and... creating the whole of the Magical World and almost all of the people who live in it. Said people are intelligent, alive, and even possessed of souls. He also appears to be immortal. Some characters even go so far as to call him the god of the Magical World.
-   Rustyrose from _Fairy Tail_ uses the Arc of Embodiment which allows him to materialize anything from his imagination to use as he wants.
-   The Kais and lesser gods in _Dragon Ball_ can create mundane objects, most often clothes, from nothing. It's stated to be a form of magic and is specifically called Magic Materialization/_Busshitsu Shutsugen Majutsu_. Angels have been shown to have the same power. The Kais' counterparts, the Gods of Destruction, have the opposite power: to destroy anything at will.
-   Sakura Kinomoto in _Cardcaptor Sakura_ using The Create can... well... create.
-   In _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_, Spiral Power can be this, provided that the user is Hot-Blooded enough.
-   In _Claymore_, Dae claims that Priscilla's powers go far beyond a mere Healing Factor. She is actually creating her body anew.
-   Hajime Nagumo from _Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest_ gained access to Creation Magic after clearing the Great Orcus Labyrinth, which he primarily uses to create materials and basic components that he uses in his Guns, Machine Guns, missile launchers, Attack Drones, various vehicles, and at least one Kill Sat which he uses to fight with.
-   In _Hunter × Hunter_, Conjuration type Nen users can create objects using their Nen. Notable examples include Shizuku of the Genei Ryodan (conjures a demonic vacuum cleaner that can suck up and store anything she considers non-living) and Gon's inspiration Kite (conjures a snarky clown slot machine that turns into a random weapon).
    -   One of the main characters, Kurapika, also discovers that he's a Conjurer type after awakening his Nen, and provides the audience with a crash course in how Conjuration can be incredibly powerful...but only by Min-Maxing. He used his Nen to create multiple chains with powerful abilities by imposing equally powerful limitations on them. Any object created via Conjuration _without_ imposing some sort of limit will be inferior to an item of the same time that was made by mundane means. The best example is Chain Jail, which imprisons a target and is absolutely inescapable because it's both incredibly strong and nullifies the Nen of anyone caught in it. The limits he imposed are that it will _only_ work on members of the Genei Ryodan (of which there are never more than 13), and Kurapika will instantly die if he tries to use it on a non-member.
-   Sancho in _Lets Bible_ appears to have this power at first, until everyone figures out that his power instead is to teleport anything in the world to his general location. When Vulcan is empowered and supposed to be given the same power as him, he instead gets the _actual_ power of creation by being able to teleport things in that don't exist.
-   In _Castle Town Dandelion_, Kanade has this as her Royalty Superpower. _Heaven's Gate_, allows her to create _anything_ she thinks of. Stops short of being a Story-Breaker Power by one thing: anything she makes immediately gets assigned a in-universe pricetag to it... which is _then_ immediately deducted from her savings account. Ouch.
-   Momo Yaoyorozu from _My Hero Academia_ can create any non-living object she wants so long as she knows the exact molecular formula of said object.
-   In _Naruto_, Kaguya Otsutsuki, the Mother of All Chakra, has the power to create entire dimensions, as well as having the ability to manipulate them during battle.
-   Kunikida Doppo from _Bungo Stray Dogs_ can create any object by writing the name of it in his notebook, provided he's seen it and understands its form and function, and it's no bigger than the notebook itself.
-   Sana, and most of the Dreams of Alice, from _Alice & Zoroku_ have the power to create from nothing. Most are limited to single types of objects, but Sana can create anything, including living beings and extradimensional spaces.
-   Averted in _Overlord (2012)_: The guardians _think_ Ainz and those like him have this kind of power, no matter how much he tries to convince them otherwise. While it's true that the guardians were created by Ainz and his guildmates, it was simply a matter of using a game feature to custom-design an NPC and its abilities, with their backstory and personality that was flavor-text only (as Ainz discovered when he jokingly rewrote a guardian to be in Mad Love with him, and discovered this was now the case). As they're no longer in the game itself, Ainz doesn't have access to that ability.
-   In _A Certain Magical Index_, the power of the #2 Level 5, Teitoku Kakine is to be able to create Dark Matter that he can give any properties he wants, including properties that defy the laws of physics. Combine that with the ability to freely shape his Dark Matter into any form he wants, and he can create all manner of mundane objects to more complex things like human flesh and organs.
-   Gremmy, in _Bleach_, combines this trope with Imagination-Based Superpower; one of his skills is to conjure up anything he wants. If this alone sounds incredibly overpowered, it's counterbalanced by an equally crippling drawback: complete Power Incontinence, as anything _detrimental_ to him he thinks of will be conjured too.
-   Clara from _Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun_ can create anything she has seen before.
-   _That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime_
    -   Rimuru _appears_ that he has this at first glance from his synergy of Skills, though it's closer to Matter Replicator in function.
    -   Yuuki Kagurazaka has the Unique Skill Creator, which allows him to manipulate a strange form of energy that can change form into whatever he needs for his current situation. It's what initially allowed him to create his Anti-Skill, can analyze and copy Unique Skills used in his presence, which he used to ultimately steal the Unique Skill Greed from Maribell Rosso after he killed her, and even forcibly evolved his own body permanently into a Saint.
    -   True Dragon Stellar Dragon King Veldanava possessed the Ultimate Skill Creation King Ahura Mazda, which allowed him to make _anything_ as long as he had sufficient power (and he's the strongest being in _The Multiverse_) and knowledge (which made his Origin Skill Information King Akashic Records a useful Required Secondary Power). Using this Skill, he created the multiverse and the living beings within it. A late-story reveal is that Yuuki's Creator is in fact a degraded version of Ahura Mazda, which he does succeed in evolving Creator into.
-   In _The Savior's Book Café Story in Another World_, "God" gives Tsukina a pendant that allows her to magically conjure literally anything she wants, using it to stock her Café with everything it could need.

    Comic Books 

-   All of the _Green Lanterns_ have the ability to create anything with their power rings, only limited by their will.
    -   Kyle Rayner when he became Ion the first time. It was implied that he had pretty much became a Reality Warper.
    -   Possibly even worse in the original Silver Age comics. At least one story had Hal Jordan overcome a force that was simply too strong for his ring alone by creating a dozen clones of himself out of thin air, power rings and all.
-   In _Shadowpact_, Nightshade is shown to be able to imbue the shadow creatures she creates with a degree of sentience. She has created two ravens named Hugin and Munin after the ravens belonging to Odin and created two shadow homunculi named Alan and Paul after some boys she dated in high school.
-   _Watchmen_: Dr. Manhattan can create things out of thin air, or the sands of Mars. At the end he leaves Earth for a less complicated realm, and to try to create new life.
-   The Beyonder from Marvel Comics can create anything he imagines.
-   Captain Atom has the ability to create and manipulate energy and matter. In one story arc, "Quantum Quest," he took these abilities to their logical conclusion and created his own universe. He does a terrible job governing that universe, unfortunately.
-   Michael Demiurgos from Vertigo's Lucifer has the power of creation out of nothingness. He can't give it form though, only his brother, Lucifer can. As such, together, they can create an entire universe.
-   Wonder Woman, and as of _Wonder Woman (1987)_ usually all the other Amazons as well, were made out of clay and brought to life by a group of Olympian goddesses.
-   Billy Kaplan of the Young Avengers discovers some utopian paradises that he creates in the future. Spoilers abound while hopping through dimensional gateways.

    Fan Works 

-   _Ages of Shadow_: At some point during her long imprisonment, Jade learns how to create matter by compressing the shadow energy of the Shadow Realm and forcing her will on it. Not only does this work for solid matter (i.e. her palace and the Floating Continent it sits on), but she later learns how to turn it into liquid shadow as well, giving the illusion of water.
-   The Muchourin in _BlazBlue Alternative: Remnant_ allows Luna, Sena, and Trinity to materialize any non-living matter they can think of. The drawback for Luna and Sena specifically is that more complex objects require greater concentration, meaning even after over a month of training, they can only manifest simplistic objects like stone slabs.
-   _A Certain Droll Hivemind_: As seen in "Entry 3", this is what the "Dark Matter" power does, and can break physics with it as well, such as creating impossible things like non-conductive, magnetized metal. A power which Eiko uses for the Mundane Utility of being a fraudulent currency.
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: Dungeon Hearts when powered by Mana or Cast from Money, can create anything the user can think of, barring extremely rare things like Adamantine.
-   _Equestria Girls: Friendship Souls_:
    -   Captain Starswirl's Shikai allows him to produce any chemical structure he's aware of be it solid, liquid or gas, and he knows not only of nearly every Earth-based chemical but many Spirit-World native ones and quite a few unique compounds he's made himself. His Bankai expands this power to include reishi particles and massively ups the production speed and volume, allowing him to do things from mimic the Quincy's ability to form reishi constructs by creating all manner of spirit-based weaponry (such as machine guns and missiles) to producing fasimiles of Kido spells to even mimicking Hollow energy to fire Ceros.
    -   Filthy Rich's Schrift, The Mason, allows him to transform reishi or reishi-imbuded materials into other solid materials at will. He normally prefers to use it to create and repair large fortifications, completing with bristling weaponry like cannons, but can even use it, at least in Vollstandig, to transmute his own blood into large chains.
-   _Not the intended use (Zantetsuken Reverse)_: The fourth chapter has the Waiter Skeleton soul, whose power is to make any food so long as it can be described as a curry dish.
-   In the _Pony POV Series_, Alicorns possess this. While Draconequi can only manipulate matter to give the _illusion_ of this, Alicorns can create entirely new material. In fact, Celestia causally mentions how she created her first _species_ at one point. Their Mother, Fauna Luster, is also the creator of all souls.
-   In _The Powers of Harmony_, one of the abilities granted by the Element of Generosity to its bearers is the power to create anything from thin air just by thinking about it.

    Film — Animated 

-   _Moana_: The Heart of Te Fiti is imbued with with the power to create plant and animal life, meaning that all manner of dangerous beings wish to steal it so they can have its power for themselves.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   This comes as a natural part of _Bruce Almighty_'s omnipotence, with him creating things such as a spoon, a plague of locusts, and a Columbian man.
    -   Possibly Averted for the last example, as its implied that Bruce simply summoned the Columbian man instead.

    Literature 

-   The disciples of Aldur from the _Belgariad_. Technically, they can do anything _but_ destroy<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , but they create a lot. Creating something out of nothing, however, is far more tasking, since the energy comes entirely from the sorcerer rather than the environment, but it's also more spiritually satisfying.
-   _Daniel X_: Daniel has the power to create real objects with his mind, including people. Some of his creations include his own dead parents.
-   In the _The Last Dragon Chronicles_ series, people on Co:pern:ica can "imagineer" objects.
-   _Discworld_
    -   _Eric_: The Creator, who creates the Disc itself, and also created Rincewind a sandwich ("Let there be egg and cress, sort of thing").
    -   _The Last Continent_: The Man Who Carries The Universe In A Sack, who added FourEcks to the Disc later, including kangaroos as a sort of trademark.
    -   _Sourcery_: Sourcerers also have The Power of Creation, being able to conjure things with just a thought which would take wizards ("mere" Reality Warpers) _exactly_ as much effort and time as it would take to get them normally.
-   The madwoman of _The Girl Who Drank the Moon_, given time on her hands in solitary confinement, develops the ability to perceive objects down to the molecular level and transmute them at will. She uses this to manufacture paper to fold origami and later to degrade the material of her prison cell to escape.
-   Little Pete from the _Gone_ series.
-   The "Reality Breaker" ability from _Rolitania_ is exactly this. The owner of this ability—Samuel, also shows traits of being a Reality Warper, but he is the only known Esper who is able to create matter from nothing.
-   _The Magician's Nephew_\- chronologically the first book in _The Chronicles of Narnia_\- depicts the moment when Aslan 'sung' Narnia into existence, bringing life to everything and everyone that lived in it at the beginning of the world. As a side-effect, even objects 'planted' in the earth at this time will grow into larger things, such as an iron bar becoming a replica of the lamp-post it was torn from or a few coins becoming literal money trees, but Aslan makes it clear that this new life will cease after a few days and Narnia will be a more normal world from then on.
-   Ella from _Shade's Children_ can either create or summon objects she envisions.
-   In _The Stormlight Archive_, the power of Soulcasting to transmute substances verges on this: it can form objects literally out of thin air, providing an essential source of food on the inhospitable planet Roshar. The fabrials that allow it are considered holy artifacts, which causes some consternation when a strident atheist takes up Soulcasting. That person is secretly a Surgebinder and had learned to soulcast without a fabrial.
-   Poncho the dog from the _Young Wizards_ series. He can create whole universes.
    -   Wizards can give some active spells "virtual mass" to grant them a tangible form.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Soulfire, which is normally used by angels but is also gifted to the title character partway through the series as a means of Heaven keeping things balanced with Lucifer's actions. While using it, he can rework simple spells into more complex constructs. For example, using it on a pushing spell crated a large silvery hand that could be controlled by thought, and using it on a fire spell turned it into a slicing heat ray. A fallen angel specifically calls it 'the fires of creation' at one point, indicating that it may have also played a role in the creation of the universe itself.
    -   While not specified exactly what he knows, Bob a spirit of intellect residing in a skull, has knowledge of magic meant for the creation of things and other magics. Bob considers these pieces of information superior and more important to what his evil counterpart may know, which is likely, as Bob says, "limited to much destructive, poisonous, dangerous stuff. Nothing important".
-   In _Malazan Book of the Fallen_ Azathanai make things. Amongst their hobbies are the creation of different races, magic systems or flying mountains.
-   In _Renegades_, Nova's father could summon wisps of some sort of energy and transform them into metal, allowing him to create pretty much any object. His power was so coveted, it eventually led to his death.
-   In Tolkien's Legendarium (and in greater detail, in _The Silmarillion_), the Secret Fire, or the Flame Imperishable, that Gandalf namedropped is explicitly this trope: It is Eru Illúvatar's power to create life and substance, and it is also what souls are made of—meaning also men, elves, dwarves, etc. are capable of Creation through their free will and imagination. Indeed, the dwarves were initially created illicitly by the Vala Aulë, but these were not sapient beings at all until Eru imbued them with souls of their own. Morgoth coveted the Flame, but could not find it, _"for it is with Ilúvatar"_, who eventually sent forth the Flame to become the heart of the World. A recurring theme in Tolkien's stories is the Creative Sterility of the forces of evil, in contrast to this trope.

    Live Action TV 

-   In the _Twilight Zone_ episode "A World of His Own", anything the protagonist, Gregory West, says into his dictation machine becomes real, including living beings. If he destroys the tape onto which they are dictated, they vanish. The end has a funny Breaking the Fourth Wall scene with Rod Serling.
-   In _Supernatural_, God having this power while Amara, his sister who embodies destruction and darkness, lacks it is why Lucifer claims Amara is _weaker_ than God.
-   On _Star Trek,_ anyone in a holodeck can conjure literally anything into existence just by asking for it. These items are illusions and cannot ever leave the holodeck, but inside, anything goes. You'd think this would have interesting effects on the _minds_ of the users over time, but this it's rarely touched on in the series.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Every. Single. Creation Myth. It's kind of necessary.
-   In monotheistic religions, God (and only God) typically has this exact power. It even has a cool Gratuitous Latin name: _causa prima_.
    -   In Islam, it's _kun fayakun_.
    -   In Hinduism, it's Brahma ('the Godhead') who has this power. In some schools, it's believed that he created the whole cosmos 'for fun'.
-   In many polytheistic religions, it's The Old Gods who have/had it, and the current pantheon 'merely' rule over what the old gods created.
    -   In Shintoism, it's the Power of _Pro_creation. Lands, living beings, all of them came to be because Izanami birthed them. Izanami eventually died due to miscarriage, and the world became plagued by death. Fun fact: the Western scholars who translated _Kojiki_ had some difficulties translating the book to their puritan audience.
-   Alchemy has this as something of an ultimate end goal, along with immortality. While transmutation is a key thing, it's believed through some sources that with the Philosopher's Stone, one can channel the Azoth, the Ultimate Lifeforce (and possibly the power of God) to create from nothing (or rather from energy.)

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Prestidigitation allows the user to create small crude objects that last a hour. In 3rd edition, the Creation sub-school of Conjuration is all about this trope, and the Transmutation spell Fabricate is one of the game's economy breakers, allowing the user to instantaneously transform multiple cubic feet of base materials into products commensurate with their skill as a craftsman.
-   _Exalted_: The Primordials (this settings' Titans) created Creation by hot goddess-on-goddess action. Amongst the Exalted, only the Green Sun Princes —pawns of the shattered Primordials— have this power: they are nascent Primordials and they can create worlds inside their own being.
-   _GURPS_: The Snatcher Advantage, by default, snatches objects from alternate universes. With the "Creation" Enhancement, it actually creates objects from thin air.
    -   The Create Advantage, from GURPS Powers, also creates matter (though only elements and simpler compounds than what Snatcher is capable of).

    Toys 

-   The Mask of Creation worn by Artakha in _BIONICLE_, which works under the first type. Creation is one of the three fundamental forces of the Bionicle universe, along with Time and Life, and all three are considered extremely powerful - and dangerous, if the wielder isn't strong enough to control them.
    -   In the 2015 series reboot, there is a different Mask of Creation, worn by the Mask Maker Ekimu. Along with his brothers Masks of Control and Ultimate Power, it was lost somewhere on the island of Okoto, driving the story once the Skulls Spiders invade and the new Toa arrive.

    Video Games 

-   In _LittleBigPlanet_, _every_ Sackboy has this thanks to Create Mode. This is more like the case of World of The Power Of Creation.
-   Amaterasu in _Ōkami_ has this ability, though since she's been Brought Down to Badass at the start of the game, we don't see the full extent of her power. One of the first things she does, though, is recreate a river where one has disappeared.
-   _Geneforge_. A Shaper is an army.
-   The first _Black & White_ game includes miracles to create food and lumber for the player's villages. The sequel removed these options but added the power to fabricate buildings from their raw materials in seconds.
-   Arceus from _Pokémon_. Although you cannot actually use the ability in the games, it did create the entire Pokemon universe.
    -   And that one event in _Pokemon Heart Gold And Soul Silver_ allows you to use it, in a limited sense, in-game, and gives you a Level 1 Palkia, Dialga, or Giratina, holding its respective Orb no less, as a bonus.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_, the et'Ada ("original spirits") of the early universe can be mostly divided into two groups based on their actions during the creation of Mundus, the mortal plane: the Aedra ("our ancestors" in Old Aldmeris) and the Daedra ("not our ancestors"). To note:
    -   The Aedra are the et'Ada who sacrificed much of their divine power in creating Mundus. The sacrifice has left them weak, having lost their Complete Immortality. As such, they prefer a lighter touch in dealing with mortal affairs, at most typically acting through mortal agents while reserving any acts of direct Divine Intervention for the most dire circumstances, such as averting The End of the World as We Know It. Despite their weakened state, the Aedra are known to have somewhat more direct power in Mundus, such as when they made a pact with St. Alessia to light the Dragonfires, which prevent the Daedra (see below) from manifesting in Mundus at full power.
    -   The Daedra are the remaining et'Ada who did not make any sacrifice during creation, and thus retain their full divine power. According to some sources, the Daedra in fact lack the ability to create and can only alter what already exists. However, as with most Elder Scrolls lore, there are contradictions abound. There are several notable examples of Daedric Princes having "children", which either take the form of lesser Daedra or Demiprinces. There are, however, other divine entities in the series who have "children" which consist of "fragments" of their own beings, so less procreation and more "splitting off parts of yourself". Additionally, this only applies to Mundus. Within their own planes of Oblivion, the Daedric Princes are essentially Omnipotent, able to create and change at will. Adding further ambiguity is the presence of Daedric artifacts within Mundus. These are items associated with the Daedric Princes and are often given to the mortal agents of the Princes as rewards and means of empowerment. Some sources paint these artifacts as fragments of the Princes themselves, given how they act as Empathic Items which can leave an unworthy holder and find a new one.
-   This is how the "Wish" spell in _Dominions_ works, with the mage imposing his will on the Principe of Beginning to have the process of creation answer his wish, with some limits.
-   _Tales of Innocence_: The power of the Primordial Giant, creator of the world and its inhabitants, which manifests as a small glowing orb. The Fan Translation calls it "The Manifest". None of the characters possess it, so it's more of an artifact of stored power sought by the antagonists. The one who uses it can create the worlds of Devaloka and Naraka anew, impart blessings or curses on the world, or destroy everything.
-   _Nocturne: Rebirth_ has Ristill, who can create clones of herself and Maxwell familiars out of nothing, and the latter can function as an infinite source of mana while possessing dead and living beings. This interferes with Khaos's Combat Clairvoyance abilities, since her ability creates too much uncertainty for him to predict the future.
-   Builders in _Dragon Quest Builders_ and its sequel are defined by having the ability to use raw material to construct new things. Within the first game, the player character is the only person in the world capable of doing so, as the very concept of creation had been robbed from the rest of humanity by the Dragonlord, but they're more widely found by the time of the sequel.
-   _Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers_ reveals that the Freudian Excuse for the long-running Ascian antagonists is the destruction of their original, utopian society, in which _everyone_, even small children, had the power to create with a mere thought. This power was fundamental to their society, to the point that there was a government bureau just for reviewing "concepts" to be archived for convenient reproduction in the future. Unfortunately, due to the aforementioned destruction of their society, and Hydaelyn sundering Zodiark—and thus the world itself—into thirteen reflections and one Source, the souls of present-day mortals are far too weak to perform Creation themselves. It is, however, still possible to mimic it, though it requires a truly staggering amount of magical energy, usually in the form of crystals, and intense focus and specificity, which is usually derived from faith, hence the creation of Primals. Deep devotion to another person, love for one's family, or reverence given to an object can all induce accidental summoning.
-   _Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia_ eventually reveals that the "Light" which all the recruitable characters possess is this, which they can use in various ways—some of which, like opening Torsions as portals, can be dangerous. The party's second airship is obtained when Golbez creates it for them, while Ignis uses it to restore functionality to the cell phones he and his friends carry.

    Visual Novels 

-   There are two kinds of such beings in Nasuverse (_Fate/stay night_, _Tsukihime_, _The Garden of Sinners_), the lesser such as Shirou Emiya poses the ability to temporarily create almost perfect replica of an existing object out of nothingness, but Reality will correct this by destroying such object as it defies it laws. However , Emiya Shirou's projections last indefinitely due to his Reality Marble. The second kind is a Sorcerer capable of First Sorcery - The Denial of Nothingness - which allows the user to bring into existence any object without using anything in return and without giving a damn about the laws of Reality.
-   In _Umineko: When They Cry_ this is the ability of the Creator witches who can create things out of nothing (it is described as "creating ones out of a sea of zeroes"). Maria the witch of Origins is one of these due to still being pure, childlike which allows her to keep the imagination needed.
-   Powers of creation is part of the standard power set for the Hegemonic Gods of the _Shinza Bansho Series_ once the individual reach ascension and they gain dominion of all of creation. Creating things such as stars, galaxies or even whole universes is just another day for these characters. Hajun however is an exception.

    Webcomics 

-   _A Beginner's Guide to the End of the Universe_: Spending CREATIVITY points allows the Everyman to create objects out of thin air. Near the end he regains his full abilities, which spoilers gives him infinite CREATIVITY. The high priests of the cult of the Icosahedron can do so as well, thanks to having drunk from the fountain underground.
-   _Girl Genius_: Only people born with the Spark (simply called Sparks, or Madboys/Madgirls) are capable of constructing functionally miraculous technological devices. Agatha, the heroine, has the unique gift to create constructs, _which can create constructs_ (i.e. also have the Spark), which can create constructs etc. Each generation is a bit worse than the previous though.
-   _minus._: minus herself is a literal creator, and could probably do anything. Unfortunately, many of her doings caused problems.
-   _El Goonish Shive_: Susan has a natural talent for this. In fact, confirmed two spells, one borrowed power and one synergy effect she had so far were all about spawning magical constructs out of thin air.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   Roxy can use The Power of the Void to do this, in that she "steals the nothingness" from something to make it stop not existing. It's just as confusing to her.
    -   The Space aspect is also tied to the power of creation, and its associated players generally responsible for breeding the Genesis Frog, which contains a new universe.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_:
    
    -   This is the lost Black Art — the power to create matter and life out of nothingness. There are no living practitioners, and it's something of an Awesome, but Impractical goal, since anyone capable of grasping it has developed their Enlightenment Superpowers to the point that they're beyond such petty concerns.
    -   This is the true power of the Key of Kings, a magical Amplifier Artifact. Each Key is a tuning fork for the voice of God, and therefore gives its user a measure of Their power over creation. Unfortunately, the people granted such artifacts tend to be grasping tyrants who use their infinite potential to kill people, and not even imaginatively at that.
    
    _Behold! The awesome fires of God. The limitless power of pure creation itself. Look carefully! Observe how it is used for the same purpose a man might use an especially sharp rock._
    
-   _Sam & Fuzzy_: The Tar is essentially concentrated creation as a physical substance. It responds to the brainwaves of nearby sentients, by taking the shape of whatever is being imagined by them. Humans discovering it is what caused the Fantasy Kitchen Sink of the webcomic's universe. If directly applied to anything made from it (or any of their biological descendants), The Tar instantly dissolves it, or in the case of humans, instantly drains all available brain waves from the subject.

    Web Original 

    Western Animation 

-   Everybody with an imagination in _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_, but mainly the kids. Once an imaginary friend is created, their existence is permanent, and it's implied that at least one of them has outlived his/her creator. A particularly extreme case can be found in Goo, who has a hyperactive imagination and created friends constantly. She later learned to control herself, but she still creates some imaginary friends by accident.
-   Aelita, in _Code Lyoko_. Her power is even called "Creativity".
-   Twilight Sparkle from _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ can create solid (though presumably temporary) objects with her magic.
-   In _Winx Club_, a standard power for magic users is to turn objects into something else, such as turning a rock into a goblet, or just creating objects from nothing. Living creatures can also be created, but that takes either a group effort or someone with a lot of power.
-   In _Miraculous Ladybug_, Ladybug's Miraculous holds the power of creation while Cat Noir's has the power of destruction (he uses it for good, though. Messy good.). This manifests in her Lucky Charm, which spawns a seemingly random mundane item that is nonetheless the key to defeating the Monster of the Week once she figures out what to do with it, and the Miraculous Ladybug, which undoes all damage caused by the battle.
