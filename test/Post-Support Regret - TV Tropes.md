_"Look, I always stick up for you. Whenever people say, 'Aw, that-that Damone, he's a loudmouth,' and they say that a lot, I always say, 'Hey, you just don't know Damone.' I mean when they call you an idiot, I say 'Hey, Damone's not an idiot, you just don't know him.' Well, you know something, man? Maybe they do know you. Pretty good. Maybe I'm just finding out now."_

It's Bob and Charlie versus the world — at least that's what Charlie says. Other people don't really like Bob all that much because Bob often acts like a Jerkass to others, even to Charlie. But Charlie doesn't seem to care, and even stands up for him when people trash-talk him, to his face or behind his back, like an All-Loving Hero. Even then, Bob is an Ungrateful Bastard and never shows appreciation for Charlie sticking up for him.

A lot of people ask Charlie why he defends Bob and puts up with his shabby treatment. But Charlie insists that Bob is really a Jerk with a Heart of Gold and that the others just don't know him well enough to see it. But Charlie does. Charlie says he knows Bob better than everyone else. Charlie knows who Bob really is.

Until one day, when Bob does something so awful, so detestable, and so unforgivable, at least in Charlie's eyes, that Charlie's perception of his best friend is shattered, and he starts to believe that all the haters were right — Bob has no Hidden Depths, no Hidden Heart of Gold. He is just as much of a jerk as he behaves as.

With his new view of his old friend, Charlie will give Bob a "Reason You Suck" Speech and sever his friendship with Bob, declaring that "This Is Unforgivable!" about what Bob has done, and that he was wrong to believe in him and defend him against his naysayers.

When that happens, it will often result in a Plot-Mandated Friendship Failure that will drive the story along. If Bob has anything salvageable in him, losing his Only Friend and staunchest defender will be the wake-up call he needs to have his Heel–Face Turn and start to become a better person to win Charlie back. If Bob is Beyond Redemption, he will simply brush it off as Charlie being just another hater and continue down his path of jerkiness. Even if losing Charlie does give him doubts, he will quickly shove them aside.

If the unforgivable act in question that makes Charlie snap is a betrayal of his best friend, this will overlap with Et Tu, Brute?. Compare Love Forgives All but Lust, where the unforgivable act is cheating on a partner. This happens fairly often as a result of Charlie being an Extreme Doormat or Shrinking Violet, at least until the act of cruelty, upon which he finally Grew a Spine. Charlie might have Selective Obliviousness until Bob's final unforgivable act is too much for him to Turn the Other Cheek, or he is Believing Their Own Lies about Bob until the betrayal shows him the Awful Truth.

This is often what awaits anyone who is Loving a Shadow or a Horrible Judge of Character. It is also Laser-Guided Karma for the False Friend and Toxic Friend Influence. This could also lead into Backstabbing the Alpha Bitch if Charlie decides that just a tongue-lashing isn't enough justice against Bob. Bob and Charlie's friendship itself can be a Karma Houdini Warranty that expires once Charlie leaves Bob, as without Charlie to defend or protect him, Bob has no one to turn to in his hour of need, and he truly becomes Hated by All without Charlie as a friend.
