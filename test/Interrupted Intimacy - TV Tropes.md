_"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse?"_

A couple is about to have sex, or are in the midst of the act, but another person interrupts somehow. They have to stop to deal with the interruption. This trope can be played for comedy, drama, or both. Can often lead to a Relationship Reveal. If they choose to keep going, it's Coitus Uninterruptus. If they try and keep things secret (if there is a knock on the door), it could lead to a Closet Shuffle. If the idea of the sexual encounter is that another person _is_ there, that'll be Sex in a Shared Room. In a pornographic work, the interrupting person may join in.

A subtrope of Moment Killer. Often followed by a "Don't you people know how to knock?", because no one ever locks their door when they're getting intimate.

The best thing about Interrupted Intimacy is said to be that you can lose your virginity only once—but you can use Interrupted Intimacy many, many times.

Compare to Caught with Your Pants Down for the solo version of the trope, Chaos While They're Not Looking for the violent version, and Almost Kiss for a PG-rated version. A supertrope of Primal Scene, Bedroom Adultery Scene and Parents Walk In at the Worst Time. Sister Trope to Sorry to Interrupt.

    -   _The Secret of Twilight Gemini_: About midway through the film, Sadachiyo and his men burst into their hotel room to assassinate Lupin, just as he and Fujiko were getting started. Which forced him to bail in his underwear and left Fujiko stark naked, with nothing but a bedsheet to defend herself!
    -   _The Columbus Files_ begins with them meeting over a candlelit dinner to discuss the contents of the stolen Columbus Egg, in Fujiko's possession. The discussion makes its way into the bedroom, where once again, they get interrupted just as they're about to shag. This time, by way of Macross Missile Massacre!

    **Mr. Nagasuki:** _\[angrily at Karino\]_ GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!

-   Invoked in _School Days_ (adapting a possible event from the original visual novel). Sekai's friend Nanami Kanroji and her sempai/boyfriend try to get some "quality time" in the middle of a school festival, so they end up having sex in the rest area booth. They're not interrupted but they _are_ filmed by Otome's Girl Posse, who are such _nasty_ bitches that they _show the tape to the whole school_. The upperclassmen think this is funny, but poor Nanami has an Heroic BSoD.
    -   Double invoked, as almost immediately afterwards, we see that Makoto was caught on tape too... having sex with _Otome_. And this is how Sekai learns that, after she and Makoto cheated on Kotonoha, _she_ is now the one cheated on.
    -   The first part is expanded on in other media (namely, the game's Updated Re-release), and it's even worse. One: Nanami and her boyfriend weren't filmed by Otome's Girl Posse, but by Nanami's sempai and rival Chie Ashikaga; she releases the video out of spite against her.. Two: we see that _they're actually quite kinky in regards to sex_ (into master/servant, sex roleplaying, etc.) No wonder poor Nanami completely shut down: not only she and her boyfriend were caught doing the deed, **but their kinks were exposed to everyone in the school**.

Either someone opens up a portal to another world (at which point they don't have time for sex) or a bunch of Date Peepers fall out of the closet (at which point they're not in the mood). For bonus points, everyone else _wants_ Sato and Krystal to have sex for important magical reasons, they just have absolutely terrible luck.
-   _Variable Geo_: Reimi and her personal assistant, Washio, finally get some "alone time" halfway through episode 2, where they have a romantic rooftop tryst in her private rose garden. At least, until Chiho ruins it for her, by interrupting them during her escape attempt. Which annoys Reimi, sparking an improptu match between her and Chiho.
-   Happens near the beginning of _Vitamin_. The protagonist's boyfriend forces himself onto her while they're in school, and a classmate sees them.
-   _Cowboy Bebop_: in the episode "Jupiter Jazz", Faye bursts in on two guys in bed because one of them has some information she needs.

    Standin' six foot four!

    With my daughter no more"!

-   From the Cheech & Chong album _Los Cochinos_, Man in "Pedro And Man At The Drive-Inn" goes over to the next car over in order to get something to open the trunk with, only to find a guy making out with a girl inside the car.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Invoked in _Teenagers from Outer Space_. The referee is explicitly instructed to use every variant of this trope they can think of in the event of two PCs (or a PC and an NPC) trying to have sex. Why? Rule of Funny. Two people having sex is dramatic, boring, and awkward. Two people trying desperately to have sex, only to be thwarted by spaceship accidents, alien control officers, and unexpected surprise parties is hilarious.

    Theatre 

-   In the BBC production of _Henry IV, Part 1_, Hal and Doll deliberately create one of these moments.

They don't want him to search the house and arrest Falstaff.

    Video Games 

-   _Baldur's Gate III_: The player can discover a male bugbear and a female ogre having sex in a barn.

-   _Cyberpunk 2077_: If on Panam's romance path she and V consumate their relationship while test driving the war machine they stole.

-   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_: In the Iron Bull romance path, Cullen walks in on the Player Character and Iron Bull while the latter is quite casually naked in bed. Played for Laughs when the rest of the party follows him in; for drama if the Player Character tries to brush it off, which prompts Iron Bull to end their relationship on the spot; or for heartwarming, if the Player Character confirms their Relationship Upgrade.
    
    **Cullen:** I-I-I am so... sorry.  
    **Josephine:** I cannot move my legs.

-   _Red Dead Redemption II_: During "A Quiet Time", Arthur Morgan can open the door to Room 1A while drunk and see a couple having sex with each other in bed before they start screaming, leading him to close the door and chuckle.

    -   There's a random event in Valentine where you can stumble into being The Peeping Tom. There's a man lying on the bed being spanked by a woman. If he sees you, he'll tell you he'll kill you if he sees you.

-   _The Wolf Among Us_: While investigating the Open Arms motel, Bigby can accidentally walk in on a couple having comically loud sex, causing Beauty (who's showing him around) to grouse that he's gonna get her fired if he keeps it up.
-   _Yes, Your Grace_: At some point, King Erik and his wife Aurelea are very obviously trying to produce a male heir behind the closed curtains of their canopy bed. Two of their daughters show up because of prank played by the older on the younger one. The single bump behind the curtains separates into two distinct figures, parenting happens, and the daughters leave the room. Eryk then quips that this is the reason he doesn't have a heir yet.

    Visual Novels 

-   Played for Laughs in _Katawa Shoujo_. In Emi's route, at one point Rin walks in on her and Hisao right after the end of their first sex scene, requesting to use Emi's window to look at a specific cloud.

-   Subverted in _School Days_. Kotonoha comes to Makoto's house while Makoto and Sekai are having sex and walks in on them. At first it seems like she caught them in the act, but then it's revealed that Makoto invited her there for a threesome.

    -   It is more or less a Running Gag that if Matt has sex, no matter with whom, someone may well walk in and interrupt them. He seems to be unable to lock doors. Given his love of danger and hints of exhibitionism, this may be deliberate on the part of his subconscious; he certainly doesn't seem too bothered by it.
    -   There are also moments such as the scene where Erik and Jim walk in on a four-way lesbian orgy... involving their respective girlfriends.
-   In _Misfile_ Ash and Emily end up walking in on Kate and Harry having sex. Oddly enough Kate is only mildly embarrassed and glad that it was at least someone she knew. Ash on the other hand looks like she could use a jug of brain bleach.
-   _Paradox Space_: In "The Inaugural Death of Mister Seven," Crowbar walks in on Clover and Itchy "doing a jig;" which is to say, doing a dance that's part of Leprechaun courtship. Crowbar reacts as one would in the equivalent human situation while the the other two show no shame.

After he realizes that it's Zuko rather than Suki who entered the tent, he nervously sits up and speaks to Zuko.

He prepares for a fight and bursts in, only to find his mother and father sitting comfortably in the middle of a destroyed living room. Super-Speed probably had something to help with speedy redressing.
-   _The Modifyers_: Zigzagged in the unofficial parody. Just as Baron Vain has gotten off from dry humping Lacey, Rat fishes for a compliment for capturing her and bringing her to him.
