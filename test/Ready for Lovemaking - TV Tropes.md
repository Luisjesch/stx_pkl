Just being a proper courtesan.

**Saffron:** I've made the bed warm for you.  
**Mal:** It, uh, looks warm.  
**Saffron:** And I've... made myself ready for you.  
**Mal:** Let's ride right past the part where you explain exactly what that means.

Ready for Lovemaking is when a character presents themself in a way that shows this character is totally ready to have sex. Usually applies to ladies, but can be guys as well, and for any sexual orientation. Often, the character is lying on a bed and/or wearing something skimpy or nothing at all, but there are plenty of other ways that characters can present themselves. Sometimes it's in anticipation of sex, and sometimes it's outright seduction.

If it's anticipation, the likelihood of this character actually getting some is inversely proportional to the amount of time we see this character getting ready.

If it's seduction, we rarely see any preparation. We just see the target walk into a room, and the seducer is right in there. The success rate is inversely proportional to the targets' moral fiber, or willpower (if the seducer has some other methods to enhance the seduction).

Used a lot in Sit Coms, usually played for comedy with an unsuspecting man coming home to find a sexy woman waiting for him. Having prior knowledge of the woman is optional. Having his wife or lover catching him with the seductress… less so.

Naked in Mink can be a form of this.

A Super-Trope to Sexy Coat Flashing.

Compare Slip into Something More Comfortable, Bathe Her and Bring Her to Me, Go-Go Enslavement, Coy, Girlish Flirt Pose (a less direct Sister Trope).

Contrast Really Gets Around, Ignore the Fanservice.

Absolutely not to be confused with "Getting Ready for Bed" Plot, which is about going to bed in the perfectly innocent sense of sleeping.

Sister Trope to the Feminine Leg Swish.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Peorth is all decked out in lingerie, lying in Keiichi's bed with a bottle of wine in an episode of _Ah! My Goddess_, though Keiichi somehow detects this through the wall, and manages to sneak off and stay with Belldandy. Peorth spends so long absently sipping on the wine while waiting for him that by the next time we see her she's drunk and wondering when the hell Keiichi is going to go to sleep.
-   _And You Thought There Is Never a Girl Online?_: In Episode 5, Hideki visits Ako's house and is about to enter her room (Ako's mother gave him the key a few minutes earlier). Ako frantically tells him not to enter yet, but he opens the door anyway, finding she's only wearing her undies. He immediately gets out and waits until she's "ready" so he enters again... only to find her _completely naked_ and asking him to be gentle.
-   _The Familiar of Zero_:
    -   Louise did this for Saito when she was under the influence of a Love Potion, wearing a rather transparent nightgown.
    -   She did it again with a catgirl outfit when only for Saito to awkwardly invite all their friends back to the hotel room, not knowing about any of her plans.
-   _Gate_:
    -   Itami is captured by Piña's knights under Bozes and gets the crap beaten out of him (they didn't get the message that the JSDF were now their allies). Terrified that this will cause another Curb-Stomp Battle, Piña orders Bozes to sleep with him as reparations (this apparently being a custom in their world). Bozes changes into an extremely skimpy nightdress, pulls herself together and opens the door...only to find Itami, face still roughed up from earlier, having a tea party with his squad and the Little Bit Beastly Meidos of the castle they're staying in. Seeing this, a humiliated Bozes marches into the room and slaps him instead—to Piña's horror, as she learns the next day.
    -   Princess Pina goes through an extended makeup and dress montage, ending up attracting a lot of civilian attraction as they wonder who she'll be sleeping with. All for Nothing, as it was done essentially on a dare (her brother Diabo told her he'd help her against their brother Zorzal if she slept with him, but that was just to get rid of her, having no intention of committing Brother–Sister Incest).
-   In the sixth chapter/third episode of _Urusei Yatsura_, Lum crawls into Ataru's futon and calls him to come to bed, even waving her tiger bikini in the air to prove to him that, yes, she _is_ naked under the covers and perfectly willing to have the wedding night. Ataru _refuses_, instead telling her to Please Put Some Clothes On.
-   Happens a few times in _The Wallflower_. The first time, Kyouhei purposely does this to foil Sunako's assassination attempt on him. The others are set up by Sunako's insanely rich auntie so that Kyouhei and Sunako can "deepen their relationship".

-   In _Robin (1993)_, Ariana Dzerchenko tries to take her relationship with Tim Drake to the next level with this. She doesn't succeed (although her guardians are still scandalized when they see Tim and Ari kissing with her dressed in lingerie, although in an innocent context).
-   _Spider-Man_: Mary Jane and Felicia (a.k.a. Black Cat) often do this after Peter defeats his enemies and gets to it.

    -   In _Astonishing X-Men_, Kitty Pride — recovering from Cassandra Nova's Mind Rape and dealing with The End of the World as We Know It (potentially) — steps out from behind a changing room curtain, completely naked in front of Peter Rasputin. "Whoof", indeed!
        
        **Kitty:** Wait, not done with "whoof".
        

    Fan Works 

-   _Being To Timelessness_: Rose in chapter 32, which covers the encounter with Elton and the Hoix in Woolwich. The Doctor is intending already to take Rose on a romantic getaway to Barcelona for a week, but the TARDIS chooses to detour them to Woolwich. Rather than ruin the sundress she's donned for the occasion, Rose changes into more appropriate alien-hunting attire that she also deliberately chooses to be sexually provocative: jeans, and a denim jacket over a plaid shirt open just enough to show a hint of cleavage. Sure enough, the adrenaline high of the subsequent fight with the Hoix is enough that Rose and the Doctor begin passionately making out once they're back in the TARDIS, with things getting heated enough that they're unbuttoning each other's shirts. After that heated snog, she doesn't want to wait a minute more, and she's telepathically able to get the Doctor to give in as well.
    
    **Rose Tyler:** _\[telepathically\]_ Take us into the Vortex, Doctor, and then take me to bed. _\[He moved jerkily to do her bidding, but she could still feel his confusion\]_  
    **The Doctor:** Barcelona…  
    **Rose Tyler:** Will wait. I don't need a fancy hotel or flowers every morning. I just need you. _\[The time rotor chugged up and down, and Rose dropped her clothes to the grating\]_ Take me to your room and make love to me.
    
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfic _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_: Let's just say Italy _'definitely_ was ready for both Germany and Japan when he Cosplayed as Sailor Moon.
    
    "Hey guys!" The sight that greeted the pair dropped two mouths into oblivion, their blood rushing south faster than the speed of light; impossibly short skirt which showcased voluptuous hips and crimson calf-high boots on legs that stretch on for miles, that cute little red bow on a white blouse that hugged all the right places and elegant gloves which encased lithe arms...it was a miracle upon the holiest upon holiest and merciful of miracles that the ship did not spontaneously detonate in a gory explosion of blood and guts at that very instant. Wink. Two-fingered salute. "Sailor Vene reporting for duty!"
    
-   In _Kara of Rokyn_, the main character walks in a dressing room wearing nothing but a towel, and runs into her rival Jasmine, who is wearing nothing but a short robe and a hungry look on her face.
    
    Kara entered the dressing room, and found that she was not alone.  
    Jasmine was there, clad only in a short robe. She was looking straight at Kara.  
    Kara Zor-El dropped her towel and her jaw at the same time.
    
-   In the NSFW _RWBY_ fanfic _Love Hurts,_ after Yang gives Weiss the idea to use her binding glyphs for bondage, Jaune returns to his room to find that Weiss has trussed herself up naked on his bed. He promptly faints.
    
    **Weiss:** Dammit.
    
-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_, Shinji is putting away groceries when Asuka comes into the kitchen, wearing barely any clothes, struts towards him with an absolutely predatory leer and asks if he is just going to stand there and stare at her.
-   _The Night Unfurls_: In the original version, Grace puckers up towards Kyril when he is about to inform her of her duties as his retainer. When asked about this, Grace says she thought she has to "warm his bed". Kyril, the Celibate Hero he is, rejects her offer and quickly gets back to the main subject.
-   Kaworu attempts this on Rei in _Nobody Dies_. When she joined the Ikaris on a business trip to Switzerland, he had her hotel reservation changed from an ordinary room to the honeymoon suite and arranged to be in the room waiting for her when she arrived. The only problem is when she _does_ arrive, she is so tired, her sole interest is sleep, and may God have mercy on anyone foolhardy enough to stand betwixt her and the bed!
-   A _Pokémon_ fan comic has Dawn in the Galactic Headquarters naproom reading the "Please make sure the bed is unoccupied before getting in" sign. She turns around, and Cyrus beckons for her to join him. Dawn is unamused.
-   Parodied in _Pyro's Night at Freddy's,_ with Chica lounging, er, "seductively" against a stack of pizza boxes with a pizza slice in lieu of a rose held in her beak while Sexophone music plays in the background. She beckons for Pyro to come closer so she can kill him with the pizza cutter hidden behind her back, but Pyro simply waves back and wanders off. Bonnie gives Chica a "seriously, what the hell was that?" gesture, to which she can only shrug sheepishly in response.
-   _The Second Try_: The night before the final battle, Asuka asks Shinji to stay with her, unbuttoning her gown so the meaning of her words is clear and unmistakable.
    
    "Shinji...?"  
    Stopped by her quiet call, he looked back to hear what she had on her mind. She let him wait though. Her eyes downcast, she was apparently contemplating whether or not she really wanted to say what was on her mind.  
    "Would... would you stay here for the night... with me?" She didn't leave much doubt to the deeper meaning of her request, exposing her chest a little more than it already was.  
    Shinji swallowed hard as he slowly walked back to her. Technically, it was hardly their first time, but it had been so long that it almost felt like it.
    
-   In _Tickles your fancy_ (NSFW), after Beast Boy explains to Raven he is quite willing to help her You Need to Get Laid problem, she thinks for a few minutes, and then teleports right into his bed, doing her best to take a sexy pose before he realizes she's there.
-   _I Hope You're Prepared For An Unforgettable Wedding!_: After Superintendent Chalmers reveals to his new husband Principal Skinner that he was wearing sexy lingerie underneath his tuxedo throughout the entire wedding, he lays down on his bed in a sexy pose and makes a beckoning gesture with his finger, suggesting that he's ready for sex. It works, as the sight alone causes Skinner's penis to "embiggen" and he dives into bed with Chalmers.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Against All Flags_, Spitfire visits Hawke on the _Scorpion_ while he is doing the accounts, and positions herself provocatively on the couch, saying she is ready for him. She is more than a little indignant when he rebuffs her advances.
-   In _The Big Sleep_, Marlowe comes back to his apartment to find Carmen Sternwood waiting for him — though because of the Production Code she's still dressed. (In the novel, she's naked.)
-   Mandy Moore's character tries this on her Bodyguard Crush in _Chasing Liberty_, but he is horrified and requests that she Please Put Some Clothes On.
-   In the _Coneheads_ movie, Prymaat sets up a scenario like this after consuming mass quantities of women's magazines looking for advice on how to keep Beldar interested in her. The resultant interlude sounds (to the eavesdropping FBI dudes) like violently mating cats.
-   In _Death Ring_, Skylord arrives back at his apartment to find his girlfriend waiting for him in new lingerie and with only one thing on her mind. Unfortunately, he has just got a lead on Matt and Lauren's location and has to leave immediately, which severely pisses her off considerably.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons: The Book of Vile Darkness_: While she's preparing to offer Grayson sex, Akordia dresses herself in a very skimpy outfit which just barely covers anything.
-   _The Girl_ (1987). When seducing Franco Nero's character, the Fille Fatale removes her dress to reveal she's got nothing underneath except a pair of stockings. The man is married and she's underage, so he doesn't respond. She then walks into his bedroom saying, "Aren't you being a bit naive?" He goes to leave, then follows her in.
-   Played for Laughs in _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom_, in which Indy and Willie have an argument over their Belligerent Sexual Tension. Each one is certain that the other is hot for them (and they're both right), but their egos won't allow either to "submit". Thus, they retire to their individual rooms and the audience is treated to a montage as they prepare themselves for a wild night of raunchy sex, only to (angrily) realize that neither one is biting. Then, the trope is played its straightest after Indy is almost assassinated in his room and barges into Willie's to check for another assassin, with Willie reclining on the bed, positively _giddy_ to see a crazed Indy busting her door down.
-   In more than one _James Bond_ movie, he returns to his hotel room to find a naked woman waiting for him.
    -   The classic example being Tatiana Romanova in _From Russia with Love_, who sneaks through the window of Bond's hotel room while 007 is getting ready to take a shower, and climbs into Bond's bed wearing precisely one black velvet neck ribbon and a pair of black silk stockings. (When Bond asks Tatiana if she wore anything at all when she snuck into his room, she replies, "This!", pointing to said ribbon. (Incidentally, this very scene is used to audition both future Bonds and Bond girls.)
    -   Bibi Dahl does in _For Your Eyes Only_, but Bond declines the offer due to her being underaged.
    -   Used with the roles reversed in _A View to a Kill_. After snooping around the villain's estate, Bond is unable to get back to his bedroom before they check if he's there (blowing his cover as just another rich idiot guest). So, he uses this ploy to explain his absence: when May Day returns to her room she finds Bond naked in her bed. She ends up going along with it in order to not blow her cover.
    -   Played with in _Diamonds Are Forever_, in which Bond comes up to his room with Plenty O'Toole, strips her down to her very bare essentials, she excuses herself to "freshen up" but a band of mooks restrain him and drop her out the window. She lands in the hotel pool wearing nothing but her panties and her high heels. A mook later remarks that he didn't know there was a pool. And then he goes into the bedroom to find Tiffany Case scantily clad in the bed.
-   In _John Tucker Must Die_, John Tucker sneaks into what he thinks is Kate's hotel room and gets on the bed in a pink thong. Unfortunately for him, it turns out to be his _teacher's_ hotel room. She drags him out by the ear.
-   Oddly, Delia dresses like this and reclines on the bed while _telephoning_ Bowles-Ottery at the television studio in _A Jolly Bad Fellow_. It is _very_ obvious what is on her mind.
-   In _Killers_, Spencer and Jen are talking when Jen gets onto the bed in her underwear. However, Spencer has his back to her and doesn't notice, and keeps talking until she falls asleep.
-   Subverted in _Lolita_ (1997). Charlotte waits for Humbert in bed dressed in a silk nightie, but Humbert (who's only married Charlotte to get close to her underage daughter) has already drugged her. After testing she's unconscious by shaking the bed, turning up the radio (which is playing "I'm in the Mood for Love") and waving a flashlight in her face, only then does he get into bed. Unfortunately, she then wakes up, so Humbert has to perform his "husbandly duties" anyway. And find a more powerful sleeping pill.
-   _Lord of War_: When Yuri visits Liberia, he finds two African prostitutes, Iman and Naomi, dressed in lingerie waiting for him in his hotel bedroom. He figures this is a cruel joke on the part of the dictator who's hosting him, since he doesn't have a condom and the part of the world he's in means he would be flipping a coin on getting HIV if he went for it. Despite getting quite turned on, his big head prevails over his little one and he tells them to get out.
-   _Mackenna's Gold_: After Inga (briefly) leaves the group, Hesh-Ke makes a beckoning sign at Mackenna, pointedly picks up her bedroll, unrolls it, and sits down, staring at Mackenna intensely.

As he follows the trail of clothes she's left behind, he ends up in his parents' bedroom, where Daisy is, wearing his father's shirt, and standing seductively by the bed.
-   _Norbit_: On her honeymoon, Rasputia leaves the bathroom and enters the room wearing her red lingerie, smiling at her husband Norbit. However, this does not excite him at all, because she is morbidly obese and he was forced to marry her against his will. And then, to make matters worse, she jumps on him, breaking the bed and smashing Norbit, who screams in pain.
-   Both parodied (in the styles of James Bond) and played straight in _The Pink Panther Strikes Again_. The Soviet spy (woman) is seduced, not by the protagonist, but by the Egyptian (man) spy, also sent to Munich to kill Clouseau. The Egyptian ends up getting killed and Clouseau finds her in this position, in the dark. She ends up falling for him instead, in the mistaken assumption that he was the man who seduced her earlier.
-   Samantha got in a big fight with her boyfriend after she did this in the _Sex and the City_ movie, and he came home really late.

    **Girl:** _\[rolling out of bed naked\]_ I've been waiting for you, Billy Ray.  
    **Billy Ray:** Get your clothes on and Get Out!.
    
-   Since it was released in 1955, the Alfred Hitchcock comedy _The Trouble with Harry_ couldn't show anything like this, but one character does describe it quite well:
    
    **Jennifer:** I was in the hotel room alone. I put on my best nightie. You understand?  
    **Sam:** Perfectly.  
    **Jennifer:** Although I had no true feeling for Harry, I worked myself into an enthusiasm because I thought he loved me.  
    **Sam:** Must have been hard work.  
    **Jennifer:** There was a full moon, and I sat by the window because I thought it would show off my new nightie to advantage.  
    **Sam:** Naturally.

    Literature

-   _Mindstar Rising_ by Peter F. Hamilton. The heroes burst into the villain's lair to rescue a Damsel in Distress, only to find she's been brainwashed with drugs and is lying naked in bed, saying she's ready to begin. Everyone starts sniggering...until she realises they haven't come for an orgy and attacks them in a Berserker Rage.
-   _The Patchwork Girl_. A Luna woman decides to sleep with the protagonist who's from a Free-Love Future Earth.

-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Ser Arys Oakheart goes to break off his illicit romance with Princess Ariane Martell, but changes his mind when she appears stark naked except for some jewelry.
    -   Cersei Lannister tries this with Jaime, though rather unusually, it involves the wearing of full-on clothes. She wears a peasant's outfit like she wore to sneak off and have sex with Jaime long ago. It doesn't work, but the outfit is not to blame for that.
-   In _The Twisted Thing_ private eye Mike Hammer finds a completely naked woman in his bed but doesn't take up her offer. He later says she went about it the wrong way, as he likes to be teased a little.

She decorates her entire room for the occasion and continues to misread his actions until Kei walks in on them, disappointing the girl when she realizes this was far from what she thought would happen. And if that wasn't enough, Hata unintentionally twists the knife by stating that he wanted to talk to them both about something concerning Ringo. In response to that, Minori hides under her sheets as she tells Hata to go "die in a fire and rot in hell", confusing the boy, with Kei warning him that she'll eventually stab him one of these days.
-   Happens due to a misunderstanding in _Sword Art Online_. Kirito and Asuna share a tender moment after they save each other from Kuradeel, who tried to murder them, and they confess their feelings for one another. After Kirito tells Asuna that he wants to spend the night with her, she takes it to mean it this way, so after dinner she turns the lights off and unequips her clothes, leaving herself in her underwear. Kirito awkwardly explains that he didn't mean it that way, and Asuna becomes embarrassed and angry before punching him. The later scene all but states that they did go all the way in the end, though.
-   Subverted in _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_. After he defeats the Black Knight and saves everyone, Leon heads for his room and finds Angelica and Olivia sleeping in his bed, both of them only in their underwear.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   The Emperor of the Centauri grants Londo the boon of divorcing two of his three wives (all of them being arranged marriages with women he can't stand).

    -   Anya employs a more direct method — walking into Xander's bedroom, then dropping her dress. It works.
    -   Buffy-under-Xander's-accidental-Love Spell in "Bewitched, Bewildered, & Bothered" shows up _in the library_ wearing only a (very short) raincoat and a smile. Xander knows what's going on, and heroically resists.
    -   Late in Season Seven, Faith finds Spike awaiting her in this manner in Buffy's basement. Funny since there's no way he could have known who was coming down the stairs.
-   _Criminal Minds_: In "Fate," Ellen's boss Sarah lies on her bed in a nightgown, calling out that she's ready for her boyfriend to come in, then asks if he wants to do it in the kitchen when there's no reply. What happens next combines this with Sex Signals Death.
-   Bree with her fur coat and red lingerie in _Desperate Housewives_.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Amy Pond does this at the end of "Flesh and Stone". Amy lies back on the bed as the Doctor gets an epiphany, thinking that he's submitted to her... ahem... demands. Of course, he just drags her back to the TARDIS to run off and go find her fiancé, Rory to dispel all the sexual tension.
    -   Done _again_ in "Amy's Choice". Only this time, it's the Dream Lord (a.k.a. the Doctor's dark side). It's not that nice a sight.
-   In _Firefly_, Mal finds Saffron waiting for him in his bed. She says she's "made herself ready for" him. She has if you can count knock-out lipstick "being ready". It doesn't end well.
-   _Frasier_:
    -   Spoofed in one episode, where Roz thinks Bulldog is being nice to her, but he does this at the end, showing he just wanted sex with her.
    -   Done several times in another episode, only no-one's gotten it right. Frasier's trying to do this with Daphne's friend Annie, who's trying to do it with Niles, who's having to fend off a male skiing instructor, while Daphne's after the ski instructor. Frasier goes the extra mile of stripping naked and waiting in Annie's bedroom with some champagne.
    -   And in another episode, Frasier does this in a hotel room while Lilith's in the bathroom... with Niles, who she just spent the night with (Frasier doesn't know this, and is determined to get with an exasperated Lilith).

Unfortunately, at the last minute she and her mum switch bedrooms without giving Niles a heads-up, so he gets quite a shock. Fortunately, he figures if he can survive the shock of accidentally leaping into a bed with Daphne's mum in it, he can survive anything.

    -   In "The One With Rachel’s New Dress", Rachel did it for Joshua at his parents' posh townhouse.

She tried to pass it off as the latest European fashion and even went out to dinner with them (un)dressed like that.
    -   Implied in "The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS", just after Chandler and Monica get together when their relationship is still a secret. Rachel goes into Monica's room after knocking (and hearing a rather seductive "I've been waiting for you" in response) and comes out screaming a moment later. When Monica claims to have been taking a nap, Rachel replies that no one takes a nap "in that position", suggesting that Monica as she was getting ready for Chandler to arrive, seemingly in a suggestive position. This quickly forces Monica to come up with a story that she is seeing a guy at work and was waiting for him. When Chandler walks into the apartment with some champagne, which is now also currently occupied by Joey and Ross, he quickly makes up an excuse that his office has just got wrinkle-free fax paper and he's come over to celebrate.

    -   "...After the Phantoms of Your Former Self": Lestat de Lioncourt anticipates consummating his Metaphorical Marriage to Louis de Pointe du Lac, so he quickly strips off all of his clothing, lets Louis appreciate his nude, muscular figure for a moment before settling down inside his coffin, and then entices Louis to come over with "It's okay. You can be on top." Louis confirms to Daniel Molloy that he and Lestat made love in that coffin.
    -   "Like Angels Put in Hell by God": In the Ponchatoula hotel room, Lestat is lying naked in bed while waiting for his mistress Antoinette Brown to join him, and it's implied that they have sex off-screen.
-   _Malcolm in the Middle_ had Hal lounging on the couch in the nude, twirling a rose in his hands and lip-synching along with a sexy song when Lois comes in. She then reveals that she has just been to the doctor and was told that she cannot have intercourse for a week. Cue Record Needle Scratch and Hal talking about getting his clothes back on.
-   _Married... with Children_: This happens to Al when a "shoe groupie" (played by Jessica Hahn) with a crush on him tries to seduce him by waiting in his bed dressed in sexy lingerie. Even more amazingly, he turns her down, unwilling to cheat on Peg. (Al may have considered adultery from time to time, but for all his faults, he never actually did it.) Peg herself tries this in the Season 1 episode "Thinnergy", but Al simply walks right past her and heads into the bathroom.
-   Happens in _Misfits_ in the fourth episode, between Curtis and Alisha. Though not exactly for sex in the proper sense of the word; It Makes Sense in Context.
-   Brooke's first introduction to Lucas in _One Tree Hill_ involved her naked in the backseat of his car. Later on in the series, Rachel tries it as well, and the actress hired to play Brooke in a movie based on Lucas' novel pulls it on Brooke herself, to see if she got Brooke's "signature move" right. Even Owen did it to Brooke once...
-   _Obliterated_. In the first episode The Squad's "Tech Chick", Asian and Nerdy Maya Lerner, works up the nerve to seduce Mr. Fanservice Chad McKnight by walking into his hotel room naked except for whipped cream covering her naughty bits. Unfortunately she discovers her female boss already there in a state of undress, which proves a severe Moment Killer.
-   In _The Secret Life of the American Teenager_, Adrian, wearing a formal black dress, attempts this on Ben, because she's trying to get pregnant again. However, he's aware of her plans, so he turns her down.
-   Tasha Yar did this to seduce Data in the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "The Naked Now". Of course, she had been under the influence of the polywater intoxication, and after recovering, told Data that it "never happened", and he never dwelled on it. (Despite this, Data always had feelings for her later, keeping a holographic photograph of her in his quarters after her death, something that Picard used as evidence in the much later "The Measure of a Man" to prove that he was capable of emotion.)
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_. Captain Janeway enters her quarters to find an enormous double bed with red satin sheets and twin heart-shaped headboards. Enter Q in a red dressing gown, holding a champagne glass. She's not impressed; even less so when Q reveals he wants her to be the mother of his child.
-   In _Twin Peaks_, Special Agent Dale Cooper returns to his hotel room to find Fille Fatale Audrey Horne naked and eager in his bed.

    Music 

-   Bonnie Tyler: "My Guns Are Loaded" is about Tyler being more than ready for the moment when she has her partner in the bed to show him all her affection.
    
    My guns are loaded  
    You're in my sights  
    I'm gonna love you tonight  
    My guns are loaded  
    They're pointing at your heart  
    All I need is your loving and a full time place in your heart
    
-   "Coalmine" by Sara Evans:
    
    _Ain't gonna have nothin' but the supper on  
    Gonna keep him busy 'til it's time  
    He goes back to that coalmine_
    
-   Flight of the Conchords have a song about this called "Business Time".
-   Nelly Furtado and Timbaland play two people of this kind in "Promiscuous".
    
    **Timbaland:** _Wait, I don't mean no harm, I can see you with my T-shirt on._  
    **Nelly:** _I can see you with nothin' on, feelin' on me before you bring that on._
    

    Pinballs 

-   _Elvira and the Party Monsters_ has Elvira adopting this pose as well on the side of the cabinet.
    -   In the sequel, _Scared Stiff_, she does this on the backglass.
-   Done with a humongous Fembot on the side cabinet art in Williams' _The Machine: Bride of Pin\*Bot_.

    Video Games 

-   The initial sex scene with Anden in _A Dance with Rogues_ has the Princess crawling into his sleeping bag nude.
-   Parodied in _Mario Party 3_ when Bowser (a turtle-ox-dragon monster) occasionally lays down like so before telling the player about some misfortune he or she is about to receive — while Bowser canonically has a thing for Princess Peach, he'll pose this way for anybody.
-   At the end of _Sexy Parodius_, when the villain octopus tries to escape, he does so past a naked woman (back to the camera) in this position. The player's ship startles her, and she turns over to cover herself... crushing the octopus.
-   As in the picture, one of the endings in the _Princess Maker_ games is a courtesan, and the third game shows this scene.
-   _Record of Agarest War_: If you max out the relationship of one of the three Love Interests of the current generation protagonist in _the Agarest series_, they show off this trope.
-   While the art style and tone of _Stardew Valley_ don't really allow for anything graphic, marrying Haley gets you treated in the evenings to one of a number of lines implying she's pulling this, like an offer "to make you feel better" or her being "ready to have some fun".

    Visual Novels 

-   Multiple times in _Daughter for Dessert_:
    -   Amanda tries to get the protagonist’s sexual attention in increasingly blatant ways. It’s only when Kathy tells him about Amanda’s secret crush on him that he reciprocates. After the secret comes out, this trope resurfaces in a downplayed fashion. Amanda, wanting to impress the protagonist, makes changes to her appearance that are very subtle for a man. He notices so little that Amanda herself has to lampshade it to open his eyes.
    -   Olivia dresses in skimpy clothes, and is quick to invite the protagonist into the back of her shop alone, and then flirt aggressively with him.
-   _Double Homework_: All girls have had this at least once, but it's particularly invoked and exploited by Tamara. Trying to discourage Johanna from having any kind of sexual relationship with the protagonist, she arranges for Johanna to see the protagonist and herself when they are apparently about to have sex. It almost ends up tearing the three siblings apart.
-   _Melody_:
    -   Melody, Isabella, Amy, and Xianne all have these moments.
    -   Exploited by Bethany in order to cement her alliance with Steve.

    Webcomics 

-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_ contains a subversion that is Played for Laughs. At the end of the "Katurday" chapter, Kat finds Paz with her eyes closed reclined on her bed with candles lit... only to reveal a new video game for Kat to play.
-   _Housepets!_: When King went to his room after a dog pageant, Duchess appeared on his bed, laying in a suggestive pose with a whip and a set of pink cuffs, asking for King to snuggle with her.
-   _Juvenile Diversion_ has Jenny attempting this so she can make up with Kyle. It works.
-   More than one character tries unsubtle modes of seduction in _Ménage à 3_ (it’s that sort of comic). Notably, Sonya goes for the classic naked-in-bed version, with a bit of prior camouflage but an entirely NSFW execution, in strip #641 (September 04 2012).
-   _Kevin & Kell_:
    -   Fiona suggests she is ready to finally get with Rudy by telling him to wait until the next day to do dishes after dinner.
    -   In some funnier, more general versions of this trope:
-   In _The Order of the Stick_, strip #752. That's quite a lot of hair.
-   Akila, the resident Nature Spirit of _The Noordegraaf Files_ has been drawn doing this on a couch in supplemental art - but in-canon she's known to do this to motivate friends to sleep with her. She's that kind of girl.
-   _Questionable Content_ has... this.
-   In _Scandinavia and the World_, King Europe to seduce Norway. It Makes Sense in Context.
-   Since _Sunstone_ is a story focusing on two BDSM lesbians who are exploring their sexuality, this is not an unusual occurrence. However, there is also an unusually tragic example when Alan's then-girlfriend Marion decides to seduce him by tying herself into a bed, spread eagle, with a gag on. This would've been a standard seduction, except that she tied her arms up too high and didn't have a backup plan to free herself. This became a problem when Alan didn't come home as soon as she'd expected him to. The bonds cut off circulation in her hands, which ultimately required surgery to save. She could've died if Ally hadn't known how to deal with the situation. Moral of the story: Kinkiness is fun but think it through first and always have a fail-safe plan.

    Web Original 

-   DeviantArt has an emoticon that's supposed to represent lust. It consists of said emoticon in a little bed, winking and indicating the empty space next to it.
-   Memetic Mutation:

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ episode "The Southern Raiders", Zuko goes to see Sokka and finds Suki about to enter his tent; she acts flustered before leaving. When Zuko enters, Sokka is posing seductively in a lovenest of candles and roses, obviously having expected Suki. The next morning, Sokka is wearing a floral necklace, for no particular reason except to indicate that he got lei'd. And, assuming that Suki gave it to him, that she's been de-flowered.
-   Played for Drama in one _Bojack Horseman_ episode. Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter are staying at a hotel on a road trip. While Mr. Peanutbutter is gone, Diane lights candles, puts on a skimpy negligee, and poses seductively on her side in bed. Unfortunately, Mr. Peanutbutter spends so much time outside talking to fans that Diane falls asleep in the pose, underlining a key issue in their relationship of how Mr. Peanutbutter prioritizes being friendly and shallow relationships over really getting to understand people around him.
-   In _Daria_, after discussing their relationship, she decides that she's ready for sex with Tom. On the big night, he actually pulls all the stops: music, chocolates, flowers, candles, etc. Unfortunately for Tom, Daria gets cold feet, decides she isn't ready after all and stands him up.
-   Madam Lorraine does this while attempting to seduce Jonah (so she can kill him) in _DC Showcase: Jonah Hex_.
-   In one of the episodes of _Family Guy_, Brian gets a new girlfriend but, convinced that having sex with her straight out of the gate would be a bad idea, takes it glacially slow. However, it's obvious that the girl is VERY interested in having sex, and one of the cutaway gags features Brian asking her "What do you want to do tonight?" while she lies back on the bed with her legs spread open, flashing lights pointing toward her crotch, and one of those guys from an _airplane runway_ waving those little light sticks in her direction, while she says suggestively, "Oh, I dunno...."
-   _Futurama_:
    -   Zapp Brannigan tries this on Leela on his first appearance in "Love's Labours Lost In Space". She's not impressed, and only ends up sleeping with him out of pity. Big mistake.
    -   In "Parasites Lost", Fry wins Leela's affection thanks to intestinal parasites that make him awesome, but then leaves to get rid of the worms to see if she really loves him, or just what they're making him. When he returns to her apartment, she's fallen asleep on the bed wearing slinky lingerie, obviously with this trope in mind...
    -   In "Why Must I Be A Crustacean In Love", Edna, the Decapodian that Zoidberg is interested in, develops a crush on Fry and invites him over to her place, greeting him in this manner.
-   Spoofed in a more child-friendly manner on _The Looney Tunes Show_ when Daffy Duck enters his room and finds Lola in this position on his bed. His reaction is to have the towel around his waist drop to the floor in justified surprise. A more straight example is Elmer Fudd doing this at the end of the "Grilled Cheese" music video.
-   Played for Laughs (we hope) in an Eye Catch for _Mega Man (Ruby-Spears)_ using _Rush_, of all characters.
    
    **Diabetus:** Ah! Dogs should not pose like that!
    
-   _Moral Orel_: Although not on a bed, Principal Fakey's wife is shown to await his return from work, putting on candles and applying make-up to her face. He claims he's not in the mood due to being tired and bored from work. ("Want to make it not boring?") The real reason he's reluctant to have sex is that he feels guilty about cheating on her.
-   Parodied in the _SpongeBob SquarePants_ episode "Jellyfish Hunter". During the "More!" montage and right before the "Moar Krabs", Mr. Krabs is lying on a table at the Krusty Krab on his side with one claw on his head and says "More!" in a seductive tone of voice.
-   In _Star Trek: Lower Decks,_ Mariner is convinced that Boimler's new girlfriend is some kind of alien succubus threatening his life. When she follows them to the satellite where they're working together, the girlfriend is temporarily absent and Boimler is waiting for her without any clothes on, seductively turning around in his chair and then freaking out to see Mariner instead.
