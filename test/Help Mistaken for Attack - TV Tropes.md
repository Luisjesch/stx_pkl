This is for when a character, or group of characters, intends to help another character, or group of characters, but because of what it seems like and the reputations of those who happen to be offering the help and any other circumstances, the very characters whom they are trying to help mistake it for intent to cause harm.

Not to be confused with Stab the Scorpion, as that's typically associated with giving the audience a misleading first impression as well. Can result in Made Out to Be a Jerkass. Compare Don't Sneak Up on Me Like That!.

Terrifying Rescuer is a subtrope.

    Anime/Manga 

-   In _Boarding School Juliet_, some thugs from the Black Dogs ambush Juliet Percia of the opposing White Cats, blinding her with pepper spray and tearing open her shirt <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to intimidate her. It is at this point that Romio Inuzuka (who is also a Black Dog, but significantly more honorable, _and_ secretly in love with Percia) notices what's going on and intervenes, picking Percia up, and running. So when Percia's vision clears a few minutes later, what she _sees_ is her hated rival on top of her while she's half-undressed.
-   _Hitomi-chan Is Shy with Strangers_: After Hitomi saves Himari from falling down the steps (and scares away the guy who was harassing her), Himari's friends see her on her knees (actually getting up) in front of a standing Hitomi and assume Hitomi is forcing her into a dogeza.

Assuming they are bandits as well, he defeats them too, only to learn afterwards that they were actually samurai sent by the princess to help him.

    Fan Works

-   _The Desert Storm_: In _Fever_, after Aayla gets infected with Temple's Bane, Quinlan uses the Dark Side to purge the virus from her body. This creates a brief misunderstanding with the other Jedi, who hear Aayla's screaming and—sensing the Dark Side—assume Quinlan is attacking her.
-   _Rosario Vampire: Brightest Darkness Act IV_: In chapter 25, Jacqueline blows up Tsukune's house right in front of him just because she can, apparently killing Tsukune's mother inside as well.

-   _Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K_: Occurs during First Contact between the Galactic Republic and the Imperium of Man. The Republic first met the Imperium when one of their fleets encountered a lone Imperial refugee ship. Before they could communicate, a Brainwashed and Crazy clone captain (secretly acting under Palpatine's orders) rammed his Star Destroyer into the refugee ship at lightspeed, killing thousands of its passengers. The Republic fleet is naturally horrified by this and the Jedi General in charge immediately deploys hospital ships to board the attacked vessel and save as many lives as they can. When the rest of the Imperial fleet arrives looking for their lost refugee ship, they mistake the Republic's rescue attempt for a slave raid and attack, sparking off a major war between the two galactic powers.

    -   In the fifth book, Harry and Dudley get attacked by Dementors who drain their happiness and energy. Harry fights them off and pulls Dudley to safety.

-   At the climax of _Mr. Men: Adventure With Monsters_, Mr. Jelly meets up with a friendly Sasquatch and when Little Miss Scary sees the aforementioned Sasquatch, she ends up believing that the Sasquatch had kidnapped him until it turns out that the monsters they had spent most of the story running away from just wanted the Mr. Men and Little Miss to have tea with them.
-   In _The Wheel of Time_, some adherents of the Prophet assaults some riders, believing that the men were pursuing the women riding in front of them with hostile intent, when they were in fact friends and members of the same group, and were just riding behind them.

-   In _Lord of the Clans_ Thrall is doing some combat sparring in Durnholde (because of his skill, he fights several men at once) when an orc prisoner breaks free and angrily charges the group yelling something in orcish. He's quickly slain and Thrall is confused what grievance the orc had towards him. When he recounts the story to Grom Hellscream, Grom translates the orc's cries as him telling Thrall to flee while he distracts the guards and Thrall is humbled to realize that from his perspective the unnamed orc saw a young orc seemingly being menaced by humans and tried to give his life to save him.
-   In _The Dresden Files_ book _Summer Knight_, Harry gets his ass beat after following a group into an alley.

One of the people he was following, in his panic, assumes Harry is trying to cast a spell, and one of the others throws him into a dumpster.
-   At least twice in _The Horse and His Boy_, Aslan appears and chases the horses (they don't know he's their Big Good, as even Bree thinks "the Lion" is just a metaphorical title). Each time he's trying to either get them to work together or give them a push when they most need it, but they panic as if he's actually going to kill and eat them. Eventually he meets them face to face, and they understand what he was doing and why.

    -   When gang-rape leader Todd Manning attacks his victim Marty _again_, her friend Luna happens upon the scene and whacks him on the head with a pipe.

    Video Games 

-   In _X3: Terran Conflict_ and _X3: Albion Prelude_, the player's space suit is equipped with a repair laser for patching up hull damage (otherwise you have to pay a shipyard to have it fixed, and that can be prohibitively expensive in the early game).

-   In _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ episode "A Visit to Anthony", after the eponymous Anthony is beaten up by a bully, Ren and Stimpy try to help revive him, but his dad sees them and assumes they beat Anthony up.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_:

This results in Porkchop being condemned as a mad dog and nearly sentenced to being put to sleep. Fortunately, Porkchop was able to prove himself innocent when Bebe ends up falling through the thin ice and he saves her life.
-   In _The Flintstones_ episode "Dino Disappears", this is what lead to the main plot. When Pebbles crawled on the edge of her bed and caused it to wobble over, Dino races over and catches her before she falls.
