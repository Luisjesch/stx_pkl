Two, Four, Six, Eight, who gets every guy that's straight?

_"I'm sexy! I'm cute!  
I'm popular to boot!  
I'm bitchin'! Great hair!  
The boys all want to stare!  
\[...\]  
We cheer and we lead! We act like we're on speed!  
Hate us 'cause we're beautiful, well we don't like you either  
We're cheerleaders! We! Are! Cheerleaders!"_

— **The Rancho Carne cheerleading squad**, _Bring It On_

In almost no movie or TV show from the USA that has one will you find a male character who finds cheerleaders anything other than a turn-on. This, despite the fact that the cheerleaders are almost universally presented as shallow, bitchy and led by the Alpha Bitch.

It might have something to do with the (greater or lesser) element of sexual titillation in many of the cheers, the athleticism they display or their often revealing outfits that expose their midriffs and legs. Besides being a lifesaver for people who hate sports but like girls, a little sexual excitement can boost the transient testosterone of the competitors, or at least remind the crypto-warriors of 'what they're fighting for', as well as who they don't want to be embarrassed in front of...

This is part of the same syndrome that leads to Hollywood Homely. Most American television also banks on the idea their viewing audience may not have gone to college but did go to high school, where cheerleaders were prominent, attractive, and unattainable.

It is worth noting that Reality Is Unrealistic in terms of the girls' outfits. Fictional cheerleaders often perform in uniforms that wouldn't be allowed in a high school. In real life, sleeves are optional (and usually reserved for colder weather), but bellies are covered and skirts are fingertip-length. Not that it really matters, since cheerleaders on screen are usually played by adults anyway.

It should be stressed again that while cheerleaders are universally seen as _sexy_ in American TV and movies it is by no means a certainty that the male lead will end up with them; indeed they will often be depicted as a vindictive Alpha Bitch or shallow Brainless Beauty who will be dumped in favor of a Girl Next Door or any array of Hollywood Homely or Endearingly Dorky unpopular girls.

    Anime and Manga 

-   In _Cardcaptor Sakura_, Syaoran and Yamazaki both have Love Interests on the school cheerleading squad, but their love for Sakura and Chiharu (respectively) has pretty much nothing to do with that.
-   Suzuna, the head cheerleader for the Deimon Devilbats in _Eyeshield 21_ took the place of Sena's love interest (To a broad extent) after the writer seemed to want Mamori and Hiruma. Though this is a bit of a variation as Suzuna is the least developed of the cheerleaders along with the fact that, as a shounen series about football, the romance between the two isn't very developed either.
    -   Although she's the lead's love interest, in a subversion, it's the team's manager who's wanted by most of the guys.
-   Lina from _Heroman_ doesn't conform to the usual stereotypes, being neither an Alpha Bitch nor a Brainless Beauty, and actually shows a liking for Joey. And the only people who object to any interaction between these two are Lina's brother and his friends.
-   In _My Hero Academia_ during the School Festival Arc, Mineta and Kaminari manage to trick their female classmates into wearing cheerleader uniforms by claiming it's one of the events at the festival. The girls get pissed off when they find out, except for Hagakure, who gets into it.

    Comic Books 

-   In _All-Ghouls School_, two of Becca's friends at her old school state that having a cheerleader's uniform lets you get away with anything.

-   In the _Archie Comics_, multiple covers have Archie (and some boys) showing interest for cheerleaders, often Betty and Veronica, or being easily distracted by them during the games, as in the trope image.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Luann_ has Tiffany, Alpha Bitch head cheerleader, be the object of Luann's crush Aaron's affections. Might be an aversion, but maybe not. Rumors circulate that the writers originally meant to reveal that Aaron was gay and was not interested in any of the supposed love interests, but fears that the strip was not popular enough to survive this scrapped that plan.

    Fan Works 

-   The Eds fall head-over-heels in love with some college-aged cheerleaders in the _Calvin at Camp_ episode "A Stalker's Life", much to the ire of the Kanker sisters.

    Films — Animation 

-   Subverted in _ParaNorman_. Mitch is gay and has no idea Courtney has been trying to flirt with him.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Played with in _A History of Violence_, where Tom Stall's wife decides that since they didn't grow up together, he deserves a night with a cheerleader. Turns out she can still fit into her old cheerleading uniform, or had one specially made...
-   Played straight and subverted in _American Beauty._ Kevin Spacey's character becomes infatuated with his daughter's cheerleader friend, Angela to the point of having weird fantasies about her in the middle of her routine. However, one of her classmates pointedly ignores her in favor of depressed, introverted Jane. Jane, ironically, is also a cheerleader, but so far from the stereotype that she doesn't really count.
-   Parodied in _Animal House_. Budding playboy (and future gynecologist) Otter subverts the main cheerleader's romance (such as it is) with the college jock by cheating with her (and getting further than he does). True to her archetype, she casually blows him off and dismisses his performance, the only blow to his persona that occurs. He consoles himself by seducing and satisfying the wife of the Dean of the college.
-   _Bottoms_: The cheerleader characters (Brittany, Isabel, and Stella-Rebecca), are universally seen as beautiful and desirable by people around them, especially by the female protagonists PJ and Josie, and frequently indulge in fanservice of their own volition. Isabel is also dating star quarterback Jeff. And while Josie is able to genuinely connect with and romance Isabel, PJ's interest in Brittany is implied to start and stop at how she's a hot, popular cheerleader.
-   Double Subverted with Brian Flagg in _The Blob (1988)_. He doesn't show much interest in Meg at first, but they end up together by the end of the movie.
-   Mocked in _Bowfinger_. Eddie Murphy's main character keeps getting in trouble for exposing himself to the LA Lakers cheerleaders. It's how they blackmail him into doing the movie at the end.
-   _Bring It On_: Most notably Cliff from the first movie, but a _lot_ of men across the franchise. This is the reasoning behind the bikini car wash as a fundraising effort in the first movie.
-   In _But I'm a Cheerleader_, Megan is a cheerleader and is dating a football player. When accused of being gay, she uses her being a cheerleader as proof of her heterosexuality. Subverted in that she actually is gay (although in denial about it) and seems to quite enjoy being around the other cheerleaders herself.
-   _Can't Buy Me Love_ from 1987... can a nerd find true love with a cheerleader?
-   Main selling point of _Cheerleader Camp_.
-   In _Dead Poets Society_, Chris is a cheerleader, and while this doesn't seem to make a difference for Knox, it probably has something to do with why she's with Chet, a football player.
-   Played for laughs in _DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story_: the teenage member of the gym is in love with a cheerleader at his school - however, his response to try and win her over is to join the cheerleading team himself. It's subverted, however, that the cheerleader is clearly in love with him as well, but he's a little too geeky to actually realize this.
-   _Fired Up!_ plays this for comedy. Two of the most popular guys in school ditch football camp to go to cheer camp, originally for no other reason than to score with all the female cheerleaders. In the end, they end up _enjoying_ being male cheerleaders, and for one of them, lust is replaced by love.
-   _A Face in the Crowd_ presents the 1950s version of this trope when Lonesome Rhodes returns to his hometown of Pickett, Arkansas to judge the local high-school girls in a baton-twirling competition. Near the beginning of this scene, the drum majorettes are doing an old-fashioned Scatting-like cheer with some not so old-fashioned bumps and grinds. Lonesome makes a corny introductory speech extolling baton twirling as "an honest-to-God American art form" and knowing "just how hard it is to do it right." The camera angles during the contest itself suggest rather less wholesome intentions in mind, not to mention his immediately subsequent elopement with the contest winner, a curvaceous seventeen-year-old by the name of Betty Lou Fleckum.
-   Played with in _The Gals Of Galaday_ in that more attractive girls aren't cheerleaders to begin with, but still get most of the attention.
-   _The Goonies_: In Brand's case it’s a girl who happens to be a cheerleader.
-   Somewhat lampshaded in _Grosse Pointe Blank_, as the character played by Jeremy Piven confesses that despite all of his successes, he feels worthless without gaining the attention of the Alpha Bitch from high school.
-   Averted in _High School Musical_. There aren't any major cheerleader characters until #3, and even then, the only reference we get to a date with a cheerleader (in this case, Jason wanting to date Martha, the hip-hop loving nerd) is in a deleted scene.
-   _Gregory's Girl_: Dorothy immediately becomes the most popular girl in school when she joins the soccer team, gaining her a lot of attention from the boys, much to Gregory's frustration.

-   Heather from _John Tucker Must Die_. Kate later joins the cheer leading squad in order to get John's attention.
-   Inverted in _Juno_: the titular character observes that guys are secretly more attracted to the edgy oddball girls than the generic cheerleaders. This is perhaps wishful thinking from Juno, who is an oddball girl herself.
    -   Although it's pretty understated, Steve the cool kid is seen staring at her a couple of times during the movie.

-   A deleted scene from _The Last Seduction_ has Bridget dressing up as a cheerleader for Mike.
-   In _Little Giants_ Kevin exploits this to convince Becky to become one instead of a player in order to attract his attention.
-   In _Lord of War_, Andre Baptiste, Jr., the Ax-Crazy son of an African dictator, has a troupe of women in tow with him dressed as the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.

-   Subverted in _My Best Friend is a Vampire_. Blonde cheerleader Candy is nowhere near subtle about being interested in Jeremy, who is completely indifferent to her and fascinated with nerdy Darla.
-   _The New Guy_ has this, with a few twists along the way.
-   In _Quantum Apocalypse_, Leo's girlfriend Lindsey is a blonde cheerleader whose creepy ex-boyfriend Sean is still obsessed with her.
-   _The Replacements (2000)_: Shane falls for the gorgeous head cheerleader for the Sentinels but in his defense, she's sweet, funny, and probably knows more about football than he does...even if she does drive like a maniac. She's also a cheerleader who owns a sports bar. That _has_ to be a Geeky Turn-On for sports fans.
-   The less nerdy nerd in _Revenge of the Nerds_ finds a compatible girlfriend, a quietly pretty girl-next-door who shares his love of computers. However, the Chief Nerd will not rest until he has had the Chief Jock's Cheerleader, who also happens to be the Alpha Bitch of the story. Breaking not only the trope but also a few laws of the universe; _he actually wins her over in the end_.
-   Subverted in _Saved!_ in that Patrick is willing to hang out with the Alpha Bitch but is really interested in very non-cheerleader Mary.
-   Averted in _Sky High (2005)_ with Penny. Nobody in the film seems to consider her particularly attractive, at least not in comparison to the more "preppy" Gwen.
-   On almost a stalkery level in _Sugar & Spice_.
-   Subtle, but there in _Unfriended_. The main character, Blaire, is a cheerleader and apparently good enough to win a trophy, which you can see in the background during some shots of her room. She highlights her bruised knees and does a flirt based cheer with Mitch after she promises to have sex with him after prom during the opening of the film. Mitch's best friend, Adam, also secretly likes Blaire and already had sex with her behind Mitch's back, twice.

-   Averted by Mox in _Varsity Blues_, who actually turns down a cheerleader because he prefers his girlfriend.
-   Essentially the premise of _The Wrong Cheerleader_. Despite being physically attractive and likeable, none of the male students are interested in the protagonist Becky until she makes the high school cheerleading team - which gets her noticed by a crazed stalker.

    Literature 

-   Averted by Ethan in _The Caster Chronicles_, who couldn't want a cheerleader less.
-   In _Confessions of Georgia Nicolson_ when Georgia goes to "Hamburger-a-gogo land" (America), Dave asks her to bring him back an American cheerleader.
-   In the first book of _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_, Greg wants to be elected treasurer so he can use his power to do favors for the cheerleaders.
-   Petula's endless number of admirers (as revealed in _ghostgirl: Lovesick_) basically defines this trope.
-   Subverted in _Ghost Roads_. Gary wanted Rose, and the queens of the school couldn't understand what he saw in the poor girl wearing thrift store clothes.
-   Invoked in _In a World Like Ours_ by Kenneth in an Imagine Spot featuring Allison in a cheerleader's outfit.
-   _Let It Snow_: Skimmed over in The Jubilee Express and addressed in A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle.
-   _Seasons of Love_: Josh used to date Stacey before he met Vanessa, and Kent falls for Jessie shortly after meeting her.

-   _Spellsinger_: Jon-Tom had a crush on Flores Quintera, the stunningly beautiful cheerleading captain.
-   In _The Squad_ Toby's transformation into a cheerleader causes her to be adored by most of the male student population.
-   Hilariously subverted in _1632_. Alexander Mackay is intrigued by Julie Sims when he sees her in full cheerleader mode, waving pompoms and throwing jumps. But it's not until he sees her dropping mercenaries like flies with a sniper rifle that he _really_ loses his heart.
-   Averted by Jalil in _Everworld_, or so Christopher claims.
    
    **Christopher**: When you go to the library, you actually do research instead of downloading pictures of naked cheerleaders, don't you? You are a very, very disturbed young man.
    
-   _Sweet Valley High_'s Jessica Wakefield was head cheerleader and had a different boyfriend every book. The other members of the squad did pretty well too.
-   Played as background in _John Ringo_'s _Troy Rising_: several characters are doing a background analysis on Tyler Vernon in order to get him to agree with their plans. One of their points is confusion over Tyler's relationship with Dana Parker, who they thought was his girl-friend but actually isn't. Part of their analysis is that Tyler, who is the richest and most powerful business man in the Solar System by several orders of magnitude, perceives Dana as socially superior to him because "back in high school, Tyler was a low status nerd and Dana was high status as a cheerleader".

    Live-Action TV 

-   On _Boston Legal_, senior partner (and senior citizen) Shirley Schmidt admits during a heart-to-heart with Denny Crane that when she's depressed, she tries on her old cheerleading uniform to cheer herself up. Denny find this to be quite exciting, as does his friend and fellow Shirley-admirer Alan Shore when Denny shares this information with him. In a later episode, the two men find the uniform in a box (presumably left there by Shirley herself to cheer them up), and they dance with it while making alternatingly affectionate and lewd comments about it. To be fair, both Alan and Denny were sexually attracted to Shirley long before they knew about her cheerleading tendencies.
-   In _The Brady Bunch_ episode _Greg’s Triangle_ Jennifer Nichols knows _exactly_ how to play Greg's sweet spot and weakness for hot-looking chicks, especially when she is so wanting that head cheerleader spot.
-   _Buffyverse_:
    -   Subverted. Oz and Xander are watching the cheerleaders practice. Xander comments on how attractive they are, to which a bored Oz replies "Their spelling's improved." Eventually Oz, a popular young musician, ends up going out with computer-nerd Willow and Dorkish Xander gets Cheerleader Cordie.
    -   Angel is this. Buffy and Cordelia, his two major love interests, are former cheerleaders.
    -   Everyone except Giles in _The Witch_.

        **Willow**: You were pretending that seeing scantily clad girls in revealing postures was a spiritual experience.  
        **Xander**: Who said I was pretending?
        
    -   In _Him_ RJ's friend hears about the cheerleader tryouts and asks if the girls are going to be jumping up and down a lot. And later...
        
        **Buffy**: You shredded my outfit.  
        **Dawn**: I'll buy you a new one.  
        **Buffy**: That's not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit.  
        **Xander**: Now, now, let's not be hasty...
        
    -   In _Storyteller_ it turns out everyone hates them instead.

-   _Degrassi: The Next Generation_:

She does the "We got spirit, yes we do!" chant while straddling him. The fact that this doesn't make him "rise to the occasion" seems proof that his condition is really bad.
-   Laura Winslow from _Family Matters_ is a cheerleader and an insanely popular Dude Magnet.
-   On _Flash Forward (1996)_ Tucker starts off with a crush on Kerry.
-   Referenced in _Frasier_ when Niles is given the opportunity to meet a cheerleader for a basketball team. Roz says in annoyance that not all guys want cheerleaders, while Niles' response is "Is she the _head_ cheerleader?"
    -   In another episode, Frasier dates the woman who was the head cheerleader when they were in high school- and finds her shallow and repellent. Niles still drools over her.
-   Subverted in _Freaks and Geeks_ When Sam learns that cheerleader Cindy and him really have nothing in common and break up. Played Straight by his friends, who think he's nuts for doing so.
-   On _Friends_, Rachel claimed that she had never failed to score when wearing her cheerleader uniform, leading to her donning it at a party in a desperate attempt to win the attention of one particular guy. It almost doesn't work, he's newly-divorced and Rachel's coming on way too strong, but at the end of the episode he agrees to go to her place for coffee. As she lets the guy into her apartment Rachel turns to Chandler, waves her hand over the uniform and points out that it worked again.
-   Subverted on _Glee_. Finn the star quarterback is dating 'Cheerio' Quinn, however not only is he attracted to Genki Girl Rachel but he is also sexually frustrated due to Quinn also being president of the celibacy club. It should also be noted that all the female celibacy club members are cheerios and all the male members are guys just trying to get into their pants. Furthermore, the point of the celibacy club seemed to be more about teasing the guys, rather than staying celibate for religious or moral reasons.
    -   Terri Schuester was once a cheerleader.
-   Damian and Lindsay in the "sexuality" main challenge of _The Glee Project_.
-   Naturally on _Hang Time_. It gives Julie some competition.
-   An episode of _Happy Days_ revolves around Richie, Ralph and Potsie wanting to date cheerleaders "instead of the girls we usually date," and staging a beauty contest with fake prizes to get the shallow cheerleaders to participate.

    **Radar**: Oh, no sir, we didn't have cheerleaders.  
    **Hawkeye**: My condolences to your libido.

-   Played for Laughs in an episode of _My Babysitter's a Vampire_: Ethan and Benny are more than happy that Sarah's the only one who can wear a cheerleader's uniform. The happiness fades, though, when the guys have to go along and _'Suit up!'_ just like Sarah - when Rory shows up, and likes what he sees...

-   Subverted in _My Name Is Earl_, where, in a desperate move, Earl has to seduce a cheerleader who had been mauled by a rabid badger. Since she's so flexible, no matter what position he takes, he's always looking at her horribly scarred face. Eww.
-   In an episode of _NUMB3RS_, Megan and Colby are searching the dorm room of an impostor university student. Remarking on his suspiciously stereotypical college-boy belongings, Megan makes conversation by asking Colby what he was into in school. His response: "Cheerleaders".

-   Subverted in _The Office (US)_, where Jim is sort of embarrassed by Katy's past as a cheerleader.
-   Lucas with Peyton and Brooke on _One Tree Hill_.
-   In _Perfect Strangers_, Cousin Larry once noted, "Sure, the girls in the Math Club were all right, but just once, just _once_, I wanted a cheerleader."

-   Kelly from _Saved by the Bell_ was _the_ wanted girl in school, thanks to being a cheerleader - her counterpart on _Hang Time_ as well.

-   \* On _Teen Angel_ Steve gets a crush on Jessica Fishman, a popular cheerleader. He winds up dating her for most of the series. Granted, the series lasted 17 episodes...

    Magazines 

-   _MAD_'s parody of _Glee_ had the Sue Sylvester stand-in loudly explain that the only reason for the gratuitous sexy cheerleader scenes is to appeal to the straight male demographic that doesn't care about the musical numbers. "They are not tuning in to hear a 'Liza Minelli tribute.' They want T and A!"

    Music 

-   The Cheer Up, Charlie Daniels song "Pig Tails" is about one of these guys realizing that his girlfriend's a Cruel Cheerleader. (She's already a cheerleader, but as far as personality goes.) He notes that she "used to be sweeter", indicating that she may have been nicer before.
-   Averted in _The Midnight Beast_’s "Booty Call", they'd rather engage in a Ho Yay\-filled slumber party.
-   Subverted in OMI's "Cheerleader." While the lyrics make it seem like this trope applies (the chorus does "Oh I think I found myself a cheerleader"), the rest of the song makes it clear she's a metaphorical cheerleader, in that she's supportive and roots for him no matter what.
-   Takeuchi Saki of _SKE48_. From her third year of elementary school to her first year of middle school, she was part of the Cheer Dragons, the official cheer leading team for the Chunichi Dragons (baseball team). She also danced in Nagoya Dome with her cheer team.

-   _The Trents_: The original song "Green River Reflections" is basically this trope.
-   Inverted with Toni Basil's "Mickey". The song was originally recorded by British glam rockers Racey as "Kitty" and told from a guy's viewpoint. Basil, being a dance choreographer (and a former high school cheerleader), put her own unique cheerleader spin on the song. The rest is history.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   _Stacy Keibler_: Enforced during various gimmick matches. She _had_ been one for the Baltimore Ravens NFL football team, though.

    Theater 

-   Subverted by Sandy in _Grease_. She has a brief stint as a cheerleader, in order to attempt to catch Danny's eye. It turns out she's horrible at it and is dropped from the squad. It doesn't make her any more attractive to Danny, either.
-   Almost all of the boys in _13_ have crushes on a cheerleader. This is justified by the fact that it's a small school and the only girl who's _not_ a cheerleader is the geeky Patrice who later ends up dating The Hero Evan, subverting this trope.
    -   Although it seems the one cheerleader everyone wants is Kendra. When Lucy dates Brett, he just seems to want to have Kendra back as his girlfriend.
        -   This could be because Lucy is a jealous Mood-Swinger while they're dating.

    -   Subverted with self-proclaimed, preteen cheerleaders Clem and Crystal, who everybody openly admits to hating because of how annoyingly peppy they are. Which may make them all feel guilty when it comes out that they're suicidal Stepford Smilers.

-   Played with in _Viewtiful Joe_. Guess the motif behind Silvia's henshin form. She even has the corresponding pom-poms and a few cheerleader-themed animations, and can subtly weaponize the universal appeal of cheerleaders by striking a seductive pose during VFX Zoom.<small>◊</small>

-   Gregg Easterbook, a writer for ESPN.com, takes time out of his football column every week to draw attention to some NFL cheerleader that he finds interesting (contrary to the stereotype, many of them are very well-educated), which he jokingly rationalizes as an excuse to run their picture in the column. Taking it further, he repeatedly complains that ultra-thin fashion models are terrible standards of beauty and holds up athletic cheerleaders as a better one.

-   _Street Fighter High_: Guile and Ryu both certainly want Chun Li.
-   In _Survival of the Fittest_ v4's pre-game, this is part of the reason why Rizzo Vitoria sleeps with a drunken Janet Claymont (who is, as you might have guessed, a cheerleader).

-   Subverted in _Teen Girl Squad_, where football star, Quarterman, has no interest in Cheerleader and even seems to find her annoying. Further subverted by the fact that the object of his affections is none other than The Ugly One.

-   In _Danny Phantom_, Danny Fenton is smitten with Paulina, much to Sam's annoyance. Every minor, two-second appearance she is treated with displays her in an extremely negative light, ignoring any and all chances of redemption, until it culminates in revealing that she is also the school's head cheerleader. Paulina is also a Rich Bitch and Alpha Bitch who (as usual) only has eyes for the mysterious superhero, Danny Phantom. Much like _Kim Possible_, it's all about getting dates and making out. All a result of Butch Hartman's less-than-pleasant high school experiences.
    -   Danny averts this later on by moving beyond her because of Character Development (and First Girl Wins).
-   _Daria_'s universe tends to show this as quite common at Lawndale High where the student body is largely superficial. Then again, most of the guys who date cheerleaders are also shown to be _dumber than dirt_ and characters the audience is intended to _like_ are shown to scorn them.

-   On _El Tigre_ Manny keeps trying to impress a bunch of reoccurring girls. He usually fails.
-   In _Garfield and Friends_, Garfield the cat and his owner, Jon, once quarreled about which TV show to watch. Garfield favored "Wonder Cat", while dateless nerd Jon wanted "Cheerleader High".
    -   In the comics, Jon mentions that in high school, he had a mad crush on the head cheerleader, which didn't end well: "Ever had a pom-pom shoved up your nose?"
    -   Jon did manage to get a professional cheerleader named Tami to fall for him when they met at a pizza parlor. Later, when Tami called to give Jon her phone number, Garfield destroyed the answering machine, saying, "I can't _believe_ he had pizza without me!"
-   While the eponymous star of _Kim Possible_ is her school's head cheerleader, and by all standards (especially Ron's) a Magical Girlfriend, she's also an Action Girl and part-time super-spy, and points out to her friends that No Guy Wants an Amazon. Thus she spends three seasons dating just one guy, actually even less than her supposed-sidekick, Ron Stoppable, did.
    -   On the other hand the cheerleaders Bonnie and Tara were rarely unescorted, dating the star quarterback, the cool new foreign exchange student, and even laid-back Josh Mankey (after he and Kim realized they were not meant for one another).
