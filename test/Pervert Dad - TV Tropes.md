_"Come on, Karin, leap joyously to your father's bosom!"_

— **Isshin Kurosaki**, _Bleach_

Some girls in fiction have it bad. Those whose fathers aren't useless, abusive, perfectly fatherly, or overprotective, will instead have Pervert Dads. These dads, while (usually) not going as far as outright incest, look at their beautiful daughters with hungry eyes, liberally comment on their physical features (usually their breasts), or, in rare cases, even do... _things_... with their pictures. They have to be carefully kept away from any and all school activity and visiting classmates (thus also providing an alternative for dads with male children, or those not content with leering at their own daughters).

Compare with Creepy Uncle, Parental Incest and Lecherous Stepparent. Also see Incest-ant Admirer, which this guy usually is.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Ao from _Ao-chan Can't Study_ is the daughter of an erotic author who, upon suspecting his daughter crushing on a boy, pushes for her to get together with Kijima. There are a few times where he tries to record the two of them and does other embarrassing things to hook them up. One notable example is him using a fishing rod to lift up his daughter's shirt to expose her breasts to Kijima. He's also aware of what bra size his daughter uses, but it may have been, at best, because of him buying her clothes in the past.
-   Gender-inverted in _Ayakashi Triangle_, where Matsuri's mother is the one who gets very inappropriately affectionate to her child. Oddly, though she was always a Doting Parent, Matoi only seems to have gotten so touchy-feely to Matsuri after he was changed from male to female — something his mother confirmed via Crotch-Grab Sex Check.
-   Tomo's dad in _Azumanga Daioh_ is briefly hinted to be this. Apparently, he and his daughter play a game (called the "You Know You Like It" game in the manga, and the "Oh Please, Little Lady" game in the anime's English dub) involving pulling the sash on her yukata to make her spin around quickly, which would also undress her if taken to conclusion. Tomo's friends understandably find this to be odd.
-   This is pretty much the summary of Dark Schneider's relationship with Arshes Nei in _Bastard!! (1988)_. Arshes is DS' adoptive daughter, but he never misses the chance to grope her anywhere that's meaty — and even though she acknowledges their family bonds, she's still visibly aroused when he does it to her.
-   _Bleach_, quoted in the description, also provides an example in form of the main character's dad, as Dr. Isshin Kurosaki speaks about panty-peeks and even slides under his daughter Yuzu, commenting on something under her skirt. However, this is _at least_ partially a case of Obfuscating Stupidity: Isshin _is_ quirky, but a very competent and powerful Shinigami as well, and the gags pretty much disappear as he's shown more in such a role.
-   _Cheeky Angel_: The main character's father, only referred to as "Megu-papa", has created numerous trap doors and secret entrances to his daughter's room, constantly fantasizes about at the very least, lewd situations with her and even goes to mock Megumi's... stalkers (but they're good guys really) in that they'll never see her sleeping like he has.
-   Mink's father Rouce in _Dragon Half_ hits on everything that moves. Mink is not an exception. Princess Vena's father, King Siva, is much the same.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_: Izumi's dad likes making his daughter do cosplay as a form of punishment and jumps at any other reason to see her in a costume. A flashback also reveals that he was just a little too pleased when his kindergarten-age daughter innocently stated that she wanted to marry him.
-   Izumi and Mitsuki's father in _He Is My Master_, who openly lusts after them and states that he wants to love them the same way he loves their mother. This also includes Karin, his 5-year-old daughter.
-   In _His and Her Circumstances_, Yukino's father Takashi makes some comments that come across like this when Yukino starts to look just like her mother Miyako did at a younger age. Fortunately, it’s actually just fond nostalgia.
-   In _Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl_, Hazumu's father takes pictures of her, wants to bathe with her, and even declares that he wants to marry her. Hazumu's mother is not amused.
-   While Zenzou Kotoura of _Kotoura-san_ is Haruka's grandfather, she was raised by him, so he also falls into this trope. Downplayed and played for laughs, since it's barely serious. He fantasizes about Haruka constantly... but between being a genuinely loving and doting grandfather and Haruka being a mind-reader, there doesn't seem to have ever been an actual problem with his behavior (and Haruka isn't shy about berating him about it).
-   Izumo's father in _Kunisaki Izumo no Jijou_ fits this trope perfectly, if not for the fact that Izumo is actually _his son_.
-   _Lucky Star_ gives us a fairly obvious example with Konata's dad, though he tends to at least feign diverting attention to her classmates rather than his daughter. This also alleviates somehow because Konata was brought up to be an Otaku Surrogate, and so was desensitized to porn — this does not help alleviating Konata's thinking her dad as a potential criminal, though...
-   Yurika's father, Admiral Misumaru, from _Martian Successor Nadesico_. He's very interested in her... growth, and while he's clearly a father who's proud of his Genius Ditz daughter, sometimes that pride is rather inappropriate.
-   King Cobra of _One Piece_ has a bad habit of peeping at young-ish girls, including his 16-year-old daughter Vivi.
-   Creepiest version ever: the Dirty Cop in _Paranoia Agent_. He takes compromising pictures of his daughter changing and has the prostitutes the Yakuza are bribing him with call him "Daddy". At one point, while hopped up on drugs and robbing a house... the daughter comes home. It ain't pretty.
-   In the first _Sailor Moon_ anime, Rei "Sailor Mars" Hino lives with her Shinto grandfather, who makes lewd remarks about her friends.
-   In _Sankarea_, Rea's father is this, and a rather disgusting one at that. He takes a naked picture of her daughter every year "to observe her development", and it's implied that he sees her as a sort of replacement for her mother. His behavior is largely the reason why Rea is so unhappy, which makes him a darker take on this trope.
-   Spirit Albarn from _Soul Eater_ tends to choose rather inappropriate ways to talk about how lovely he thinks his daughter Maka is. It seems to be less that he lusts after Maka than, as a gigantic womanizer, he can't describe his daughter outside of terms he's used to looking at women in.
-   _Youkai Gakuenki_ gender-inverts the parent so that it's a perverted mom lusting and acting possessive over her daughter.

    Comic Books 

-   Inverted in _Love and Rockets_. Hopey confesses to Janet that when she was in her early teens, she found a photo of her mother, at fifteen, in a swimsuit. It turned her on so much she fantasized about doing her mom at that age and even started wearing it inside her panties.

    Fan Works 

-   Papa Smurf toward Smurfette in _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_, at least up to "Papa's Big Crush". In the alternate timeline of "Papa Smurf & Mama Smurfette", however, it proceeds to a romance with a big age difference.
-   At one point in _Forbiden Fruit: The Tempation of Edward Cullen_, Tiaa's foster dad Dave comments approvingly on the size of her boobs.

    Film 

-   Jenny's father in _Forrest Gump_ is heavily implied to be one, which causes Jenny severe emotional issues as an adult, but Forrest, innocent as he is, doesn't fully pick up on it and only describes him in retrospect as a "very loving man" (although he's still aware that Jenny has no fond memories of her childhood, and bulldozes her old home to the ground years later).
-   _The Glass House_: After adopting the siblings, Terry Glass, whose wife Erin is frequently depressed and hooked up on painkillers, starts to signal to his new stepdaughter Ruby (who's 16, by the way) that he's interested in her in _that_ way. Ruby is completely freaked out by this, and this leads her to uncover further wrongdoings on the part of the Glasses.
-   In _Heart of Darkness (1958)_, Kurtz is strongly implied to have an unhealthy fixation on his daughter, Maria. Another character hints that the reason Kurtz ran off to the Congo was to avoid a slide into full-blown Parental Incest. Once he's there, he accumulates a harem of African women and renames all of them "Maria".
-   In _La Roue_, the main character is tormented by his attraction to his adopted daughter. When she's swinging, the shots from his POV are close-ups of her legs.
-   In the slasher comedy film _Wacko_, Mary's father, Mr. Graves, is always peeping at her through the window while she undresses or sleeps, trying to grab her breasts, or get a look up her skirt.

    Literature 

-   Gender-inverted example: Mamako Oosuki from _Do You Love Your Mom and Her Two-Hit Multi-Target Attacks?_ clearly does not see her son Masato in a romantic light, but she often makes jokes about panties and seems to like looking sexually attractive to her son (in fact, a Running Gag is him complaining about not being able to enjoy fanservicey situations involving her because she's _his mom_).
-   In the _Elemental Masters_ novel _Unnatural Issue_, the father, a necromancer, intends to call back the spirit of his dead wife, place it in the body of his grown-up daughter, and... well, you probably get the idea. He gets his comeuppance at the end, though.
-   In _The Hippopotamus_ by Stephen Fry, the narrator feels the need to mention that he's never been attracted to his daughter — "the gods be thanked, in these unforgiving times".
-   In _I Never Promised You a Rose Garden_, Deborah realizes during one therapy session that her father had acted aggressive toward her, with "almost-lust", over a conflicted attraction to her. This marks a turning point where Deborah starts to see reason in the real world and realize her parents were human and fallible.
-   _Inukami!_: Youko's father, the kitsune Dai Youko, keeps a picture diary of his daughter's everyday life — including pictures of her coming out of a bath. One of the first things he does after being released from his seal is to eagerly ask Youko if she would like to take a bath with him. Granted, this is more acceptable in Japanese culture, but since she is already the equivalent of a teenager by this point, it still comes across as squicky.
-   In _Parable of the Talents_, Asha Vere's dad (actually adoptive) is like this.
-   In _Perfume_, Antoine Richis is secretly (and almost subconsciously) sexually attracted to his daughter.
-   Henderson Dores of _Stars And Bars_ by William Boyd fantasizes about the shape of his teenage stepdaughter's bosom. He reaches the point of actually fondling them as he lays her drunk self to bed, moreover feeling her pubic hair, which he terms soft as cilia as he changes her into pajamas.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Carnivàle_, this is Felix "Stumpy" Dreifuss's _actual job_. He heads a family-operated traveling strip show, and he doesn't 100% _stop_ outside of business hours.
-   In the _Doctor Who_ two-parter "The End of Time", the way Joshua Naismith and his daughter act with each other seems a bit... off. He's an Eccentric Millionaire who revives and kidnaps the Master to force him to fix a device that will give his daughter immortality; right after explaining this, he steps close to her and touches her under the chin, and she tells the Master, "Abigail. It means 'bringer of joy'." It doesn't help that the actors don't look as far apart in age as they might.
-   In _Extras_, Bunny manages this despite (well, probably partly due to) being in a very Transparent Closet. Having pushed his now-adult daughter into theater from a young age, he's repeatedly seen performing with her in ways that make other characters cringe and look away. For her part, she's in complete denial about her own unhappiness with the unnaturally tight rein her father has kept on all aspects of her life.
-   _Law & Order_:
    -   In an episode of _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_, the Victim of the Week is a sex addict. Her brother swears that their father never laid a hand on her, but still frequently spoke to and about her in a way no father should with his child. The psychologist the detectives speak to uses the term "cover incest".
    -   Also seen in the _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_ episode "Family Values". Paul Devildis is an evangelical Christian tormented by sexual feelings for his aspiring actress daughter. He goes on a killing spree culminating with his wife and intends to finish by killing her and himself. Goren manages to save the daughter's life by playing on his suppressed guilt.
-   In _Mad Men_, during Don's disappearance in California, he falls in with a group of "Eurotrash" types and sleeps with a woman half his age. The next morning, amidst the rumpled bedsheets and partial nudity and all, her father comes in and they all have a chat which includes the father openly hitting on Don. (Another, less creepy episode has Betty's father, disoriented after a stroke, mistake her for her deceased mother and feel up her breast.)
-   In an episode of _Make Room For Daddy_, the titular Daddy's daughter comes home from college having matured into a breathtaking woman, and Daddy is infatuated with her just a bit too much. At dinner, Daddy politely helps her into her chair; then a bit later, he almost leaps out of his chair to make sure he does it for his wife, too. Later in the episode, the daughter gets a belly ache and reverts to the former girlish behavior that Daddy misses, namely calling for him to come in and hold her, which he does, and doesn't exactly hide that he's thoroughly enjoying it — and this is a show from The '50s.
-   In Episode 5 of _Mortal Kombat: Conquest_, Kitana has to repeatedly remind Shao Kahn that she is his daughter, even if adopted against her will. She goes as far as to suggest he... "admire" the picture of her in her mother's room. His implications are explicit enough that it crosses into Villainous Incest. It does explain, however, why over the course of over 11 games Shao Kahn never has a "no daughter of mine is gonna dress like that" reaction to Kitana's Stripperiffic clothing. Extra Squick when you realize that Kahn commissions an Evil Twin of her in Mileena.
-   _Too Old to Die Young_: Theo makes a number of sexually charged comments about his newly-turned-18-year-old daughter Janey, such as rating her a "10". He gets to the point of suggestively joking, "If she weren't my daughter..." at her birthday party. In a later scene, he outright masturbates while thinking about her. All of this makes it very suspicious how he convinces her to pass up the offers from Ivy League schools to work closely for him.
-   In _The Walking Dead (2010)_, Carol mentions that her dead husband Ed "looked at Sophia in ways a father should never look at his daughter". Confirmed by Word of God.

    Music 

-   Aerosmith's song "Janie's Got a Gun". The music video strongly emphasizes this, with the father looking in his daughter's bedroom before raping her.
-   "Magdalena" by Frank Zappa is about a Canadian father lusting for his teenage daughter.

    Radio 

-   _This American Life_ has a story about a girl whose father was a sex therapist and how creepy she sometimes felt he was. The crowning example is that when she lost her virginity as a teenager, she told both of her parents, and while her mother said, "Were you safe?" and "Did you love him?", her father said, "Was it good?" and "Did you orgasm?"

    Video Games 

-   Mr. Potsdam for Stephanie in _Harvester_, going so far as to watch her undress through a hole in the hole while masturbating.
-   In _Higurashi: When They Cry_, Keiichi's dad is a little too interested in Keiichi when he's Dragged into Drag in a Meido costume in the visual novel. He later can ogle Shion at Angel Mort and isn't at all deterred when Keiichi (who thinks she's actually Mion) tells him she's a friend of his from school. In a different route, he also suggests that Rena cook him and Keiichi dinner while in a maid uniform and briefly throws out the idea of marrying her after realizing that she and Keiichi aren't in a romantic relationship.
-   Hilariously done in _Mortal Kombat 11_ in one of Cassie vs Johnny pre-fight inros. When Cassie understandably acts disgusted to how flirtatious Johnny came on, he immediately realizes what he said and acts equally horrified.
-   In _Seihou_'s backstory, engineer Erich lost his daughter Vivit in a tragic accident, and so built protagonist VIVIT as a replacement... a replacement who's dressed as a maid and programmed to be utterly obedient, helping her master "in every matter".

    Webcomics 

-   Ash's father in _Misfile_ is a variant. He isn't a pervert _per se_, but he is a gynecologist and recognizes women by... other features... more readily than faces.
-   _Sexy Losers_:
    -   Gender-inverted with the storyline of Kenta, whose mother actively lusts after and tries to titillate and seduce him but is never going to get it (whether Kenta's oblivious or disgusted varies per seduction attempt).
    -   An in-universe comic artist tries to capitalize on the popularity of "Kenta's Horny Mom" by gender-flipping the story into "Keiko's Horny Dad", and is violently opposed for it, despite protesting that the theme is just as inappropriate regardless of gender.

    Web Originals 

-   _Can You Spare a Quarter?_: The boy Jamie was sexually abused/raped by his father, to the point that he elected to run away. When the boy meets him again at the climax of the story, his father almost rapes him to death.
-   Zeus in _Thalia's Musings_, to his sons as well as his daughters. He mocks Apollo for not making the Muses his harem and shapeshifts as Apollo to seduce Calliope.

    Western Animation 

-   Princess Clara's father from _Drawn Together_ openly French-kisses her while groping her behind, groaning about how similar to her mother Clara is. Clara is so naive that she accepts it as innocent parental love.
-   _Family Guy_: Quagmire finds out he's a father when his infant daughter is dropped off at his doorstep. He names her Ana Lee (Anal for short), and doesn't hesitate to fantasize about meeting her again when she's of legal age.
-   Simon Stagg in the _Justice League_ episode "Metamorphosis" is implied to be this towards his daughter Sapphire.
-   Papa Smurf from _The Smurfs (1981)_ is like this at one time to Smurfette, who is basically old enough to be his daughter. (The original comic books are an aversion, though: while there still is some attraction on Papa Smurf's part in Smurfette's debut comic album, Smurfette is completely unrelated to him, being an alchemical/sorcerous creation of Gargamel.)
