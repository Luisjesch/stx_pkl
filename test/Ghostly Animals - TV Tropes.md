_Listen young friends, for what I say is true  
You must treat your pet hamster as you would have him treat you  
Or fear that one day you'll hear a ghostly voice exclaim  
"wooo... someone forgot to clean my cage..."  
Ghost Ghost Ghost Ghost Ghost Ghost Hamster_

Just because it's predominantly humans who appear as ghosts in fiction does not necessarily mean that animals can not appear as ghosts, too. Ghost animals are ghosts that appear, manifest, or materialize as animals. However, this can also occur when an animal is stated to have died and become a ghost.

These specters usually appear as sidekicks to other ghosts in Ghost Fiction, although they can appear on their own as well. They may be used for world-building purposes or, in fiction which depict ghosts as malevolent entities, to provide an extra threat to the heroes. After all, a vicious-looking animalistic spirit can be more ferocious than a normal human. Often, they may also show up as a pet animal (often a cat or a dog), either seeking revenge or otherwise acting as a companion. To make it clear, for this trope to apply, the creature in question must be no higher than Talking Animal on the Sliding Scale of Anthropomorphism. May occur as a result of an Astral Projection.

See Raising the Steaks for the zombified variant. More malicious examples of this may fall in Animalistic Abomination. A sub-trope to Our Ghosts Are Different. For other forms of undead non-human life forms, see Non-Human Undead and Dracolich. For a more mythical take on the concept, see Asian Fox Spirit and Bakeneko and Nekomata.

-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _Wyrd Sisters_, the new ghost King Verence makes the mistake of visiting the kitchens where he sees the ghosts of all the animals whose meat had ever been prepared and cooked there:
        
        One day he'd given in...and had followed the smells of cooking into the big, hot, high domed cavern that served the castle as kitchen and abattoir. Funny thing, that. He'd never been down there since his childhood. Somehow kings and kitchens didn't go well together.
        
        It was full of ghosts.
        
        But they weren't human. They weren't even proto-human.
        
        They were stags. They were bullocks. They were rabbits, and pheasants, and partridges, and sheep, and pigs. There were even some round blobby things that looked unpleasantly like the ghosts of oysters. They were packed so tightly that in fact they merged and mingled, turning the kitchen into a silent, jostling nightmare of teeth and fur and horns, half-seen and misty. Several noticed him, and there was a weird blarting of noises that sounded far-off, tinny and unpleasantly out of register. Through them all the cook and his assistants wandered quite unconcernedly, making vegetarian sausages.
        
        Verence had stared for half a minute and then fled, wishing that he still had a real stomach so that he could stick his fingers down his throat for forty years and bring up everything he'd eaten.

-   In _The Hound of the Baskervilles_, the eponymous hound is said to be a large black ghost dog haunting the moors. It is actually just a "Scooby-Doo" Hoax by the real murderer to cover up his murders as supernatural, painting an actual dog with phosphorus to make it glow in the dark.

These spirits of dead animals do not exist independently of the shamans and spirit-warriors who have taken them up, however, except at the very end when the shaman or spirit-warrior dies. At that point the animal spirit needs to be separated from the human ghost, or else both are Barred from the Afterlife.

    Live-Action TV

There were a few exceptions, however, mostly Dire Beasts and Legendary Animals. There was also a Ghost Brute template added in another book that was specifically there to create ghostly animals and other low-charisma creatures. Note that there is still one group of animals that can never become ghosts — insects and the like, as they are classified as Vermin instead of Animal, and neither Ghost nor Ghost Brute can be applied to Vermin.
    -   _Forgotten Realms_: Rashemen has telthors, spirits of particular animals that were exemplary examples of their species in life, and appear as ghostly versions of themselves.

-   In _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_, the Dragonborn can complete the optional side quest "Kyne's Trials," in which they must fight with the ghostly spirits of a number of animals, including a bear and a giant mudcrab. These ghosts are not malevolent in and of themselves, however, as they will not attack nor even appear to anyone who is not actively attempting Kyne's Trials. They merely serve Kyne, who is one of the Old Gods of the game setting, in testing the mettle of someone seeking her favor.

He is a shark ghost dressed in pirate garb who attacks by possessing his boat and making parts of the floor into a mouth he tries to eat Luigi with.

-   _Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer_ takes place mainly in Rashemen, where telthors, the powerful spirits of exemplary animals, often stick around after the animal dies due to their bonds to the land. These can be eaten by the PC's Spirit-Eater curse: the Knight-Captain eats a direwolf telthor while escaping the previous Spirit-Eater's tomb, provoking the bear telthor Okku to lead an army of spirits after them. If defeated and spared, Okku becomes a party member.
-   _Pokémon_: There are several Ghost-type mons that fit the bill:

    -   Frillish and Jellicent are Ghost-types that resemble jellyfish and have a habit of dragging prey to their doom underwater.

    -   _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_ introduces Greavard and its evolution Houndstone, Ghost-types based on sheepdogs.
-   _Pokémon Insurgence_: Several Pokémon lines which don't normally fall into this trope become these thanks to the existence of their delta variants:
    -   The cat-like Purrloin line becomes a Ghost/Fairy type.
    -   The monkey-like Aipom line becomes Ghost/Normal.
    -   The fish-like Feebas and serpentine Milotic becomes pure Ghost-type.
    -   The anglerfish-like Chinchou line becomes Ghost/Fire type.
-   In _The Secret of Monkey Island_, the ghost pirates' ship contains ghost chickens and ghost pigs, which, like the human pirates, resemble glowing blue skeletons with outlines of their former bodies. They behave as they did in life, with Guybrush being disgusted by the view of the slop moving through the pigs' translucent bodies. They also produce items that are needed to proceed (a feather and lard, respectively).
-   While not traditional ghosts, The Predators in _Them's Fightin' Herds_ haven't quite escaped their prison realm after their banishment by non-carnivores, and they can only manifest themselves into the real world as ghostly shadow-like versions of themselves since they're kind of trapped between worlds.

    -   In _World of Warcraft Shadowlands_, animals end up in the afterlife (the Shadowlands) after death just like the humanoid races of Azeroth. In one particular case, a NPC horse, Old Blanchy (who had recurring appearances from the original game to _Wrath of the Lich King_ then was murdered along with her owners in _Cataclysm_) ended up in Revendreth, the Shadowlands corner for sinners. Her exact "sins" aren't expanded upon (supposedly she was a jealous and gluttonous horse), but her red and misty ghostly form can be obtained as a mount by players, after tending to her for six days with various objects.
