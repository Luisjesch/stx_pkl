_"Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face. Forever."_

There's a reason why it's Kick the Dog and not **Hit** the Dog.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  While Violence Is Disturbing, there's something about a character using their feet to hurt someone that makes viewers especially uncomfortable. Attacking someone on the ground (or in a similar helpless position) is already seen as uncalled-for<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , but this moral disgust seems to be magnified if the person uses their feet to do it.

Tropes like Hand Stomp, Kick Them While They Are Down, and Finishing Stomp are almost always acted upon by villains, Anti-Heroes and Nominal Heroes. If a hero does something like this, they can very easily become Unintentionally Unsympathetic or a Designated Hero. _Punching_ someone who's on the ground is sometimes okay, but stomping someone's face or throat is usually not. Oftentimes, other characters will react with shock and even horror to this.

There are three main aspects of this:

-   **Power Imbalance:** For one thing, feet are widely viewed as symbols of power in most cultures, but not so much _creative_ power like hands are. Hands are associated with control, strength, and manipulation, but are also associated with art, expression, gentleness, peace, and so on. Feet are almost exclusively seen as symbols of authority and destruction, as well as submission to power.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   **Brutality:** Another aspect of this is the obvious fact that it's a lot easier to physically hurt someone with your feet than other unarmed methods, especially if the victim is on the ground. Depending on the size of the person (and what kind of shoes they're wearing), engaging in this trope in Real Life can easily lead to death.
-   **Humiliation:** And of course, your feet are on the ground almost all the time, giving the implication that the act of cruelty is also an act of humiliation, making the motivation similar to Dominance Through Furniture. There is the implication that their victim is not worth their time, as if they are nothing but a bug to them. Oftentimes, this trope accentuates a villain's pettiness and disdain when they do this, as well as their cruelty.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Naturally, this can be considered a Sister Trope of Kick Them While They Are Down, but the difference is that the act of cruelty has to _literally_ be committed by the character's feet. The power imbalance is key here. Kicks being used in a fight scene is not an example unless one of the characters is on the ground or otherwise helpless. Compare and contrast Finishing Stomp, Curb-Stomp Battle, Dismissive Kick, Kick the Dog, Trampled Underfoot, Weapon Stomp, Agitated Item Stomping, Crush the Keepsake, and Hand Stomp, which can all be considered Sub-Tropes of this. Also compare Giant Foot of Stomping and I Kiss Your Foot, which can be an example of this if the intention is to humiliate or bully someone. Also see Dominance Through Furniture, which is similar thematically. Not to be confused with Agony of the Feet, which is when one's own foot gets hurt from stepping on something.

As this is a trope related to morality, No Real Life Examples, Please!

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Akame ga Kill!_, sadistic Esdeath's Establishing Character Moment is her forcing the Prince of the North to lick her shoes while he's naked, and then when she's bored of it, she kills him with a casual kick to the face. There are several other points in the anime where she takes clear sadistic pleasure out of doing harm with her boots, which the protagonist notices when she slowly kills an animal with her heel.
-   Levi in _Attack on Titan_ _exploits_ this trope to save Eren from execution. When Eren's about to be shot during his trial, Levi starts _savagely_ kicking him and even stomping on his head, which shocks everyone into demanding that he be left alone. Levi questions why everyone is so upset when they were just about to have the boy shot. This doesn't make Mikasa any less outraged by Levi's cruelty, especially as she has to watch the brutal assault and can't stop it without making things worse for Eren.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
    -   In the climax of the first major battle in the series, Raditz gets to stomp an already brutalized Goku after deceiving him to release his tail. He underscores this villainous act by telling Goku how stupid he was in letting go of Raditz's tail.

    -   Frieza has three during his fight against the heroes at the end of his saga; he personally stomps on Gohan and grinds his feet on his head, causing Gohan to scream in agony whilst Frieza laughs about the situation. Keep in mind that Gohan is _no older than five_. Later on, he does it again to Vegeta in his effort to physically and mentally break him out of petty sadism. Finally, he tries to drown Goku by holding his head with his feet and dipping Goku into Namek's waters.

The Alpha Bitch of the trio even stomped on Rinne's phone when it rang. The next day, Rinne was in no mood for trifling, as she'd missed a call that her grandfather, on his deathbed, had wanted to see her one last time. She made short work of the Alpha Bitch's cohorts, then used an arm bar to put the bitch's head on the floor, whereupon Rinne stomped on it. One busted iPhone equals one fractured skull.

    Comic Books 

-   _Secret Wars (1984)_: As Molecule Man and Volcana traverse part of the villains' fortress, the Wrecking Crew makes snarky comments.

    Film — Animation 

-   A rare _heroic example_ in _Anastasia_. When Rasputin has Anya and Dimitri at his mercy, Anya's dog manages to knock Rasputin's Soul Jar reliquary out of his grip and sending it in Anya's direction. Anya _knows_ that destroying it will kill Rasputin. So, she casually stops the reliquary with her foot and slowly crushes it, doing it slowly enough that she can emphasize to Rasputin that she's avenging her family. The way she goes about it is very similar to how a villain would, but Anya stays sympathetic because this really was the only way she could stop Rasputin, and because he really did have it coming after everything he did.
-   _How to Train Your Dragon 2_: Drago Bludvist, who is abusing the captive dragons in his command and has committed many atrocities, is often seen forcing the dragons to submit by brutally kicking them while they're down. This is in sharp contrast to the other dragon riders in the film, who gently approach the dragons by offering their hands and treat them more as trusting companions.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Mixed with Dominance Through Furniture in _300_. Xerxes is introduced being carried on a massive throne that puts him at least ten extra feet off the ground. He then uses the backs of his slaves as stairs to get down to speak to Leonidas, clearly to show him how much power Xerxes has.
    -   When the emissary of Xerxes visits Sparta to demand they accede to the Persian Empire, Leonidas refuses. The emissary is horrified, not only because the Persians number in the tens of thousands while Sparta could not muster more than one thousand, but because this breaks Sacred Hospitality. "This is blasphemy!" chastens the emissary, "This is madness!" Leonidas responds, "Madness? This. Is. Sparta!" and kicks the emissary in the sternum, toppling him into the city well to his death. Usually, a kick would not be an example, but the fact that the emissary is completely helpless makes this an example.
-   _Aladdin (2019)_: Instead of trying to stab Aladdin as soon as he gives him the lamp, as per the original film, Jafar replies to Aladdin's plea for the Vizier to give him his hand with "How about... my foot?" and steps on Aladdin's fingers so that he falls back into the Cave of Wonders. Abu still steals the lamp from him anyway.
-   The infamous curb-stomping scene from _American History X_ where Derek Vineyard, in full Neo-Nazi hate mode, forces one of three would-be car thieves to bite the curb and then stomps down hard on his head with horrifying and fatal results. His younger brother is left in total shock by the scene.
-   _The Batman (2022)_: Selina Kyle holds a corrupt cop involved in the murder of her friend hostage on a roof, and attempts to shoot him, but Batman stops her, telling her that killing bad people will make her just as bad as them. She responds by nonchalantly planting her foot on the cop's chest and pushing him off the ledge. Thankfully, Batman stops him from falling to his death.
-   Poison Ivy in _Batman & Robin_ crosses the Moral Event Horizon when she murders Nora Fries by casually unplugging her life support with her boot.

The young man recognizes Rollergirl as Brandy from high school, and Rollergirl recognizes him as the bully that drove her to quit high school and subsist on porn loops. When this doesn't work out well, the man grouses that Horner's films suck, which triggers Horner to pounce on him on the sidewalk. Horner's associates pull him off, but Rollergirl approaches the bully, and begins stomping on his face _with her skates on_ as payback. Even Jack Horner helps pull Rollergirl off her victim and into the limo. Hell hath no fury.
-   A particularly brutal example in _Brawl in Cell Block 99_. After Bradley reaches his breaking point, he shows no qualms about using his feet (and by extension, his mass) to commit _devastating_ acts of violence. The most notable example is when he knocks out a prisoner in a fight, stomps on the back of his head, and threatens to finish him off. When the villain of the film doesn't do what Bradley says, he then _scrapes the guy's pressed down face against the concrete_, needlessly killing him slowly and painfully. He then rolls him over to show the guy's buddies that his face has been peeled off. Even the hardened gangsters are absolutely horrified.
-   _Cliffhanger_: Delmar, one of Eric Qualen's terrorists, is a former soccer player. He tells Hal this right before roleplaying a soccer game and kicking Hal around as if he were a ball. He manages to kick Hal off the cliff, leaving him dangling off the ledge while stomping on his fingers and laughing sadistically over his torment.

Without hesitating, Angel puts his feet on Dieter's throat and presses down, killing him.
-   The Made-for-TV Movie "A Cry for Help: The Tracy Thurman Story" starring Nancy McKeon is based on the true account of a battered wife. The worst thing her husband does to her is knock her down and stomp on her head while she's lying on the sidewalk. This causes her to be partially paralyzed on one side and she ends up suing the local authorities for "failure to protect" since she'd been begging them to take her seriously.

-   _Jurassic World_ shows the _Indominus rex_ using her huge feet this way, first by dropping Katashi Hamada onto a puddle and splashing her foot where he is struggling to get up, which instantly kills him. She also steps on an _Ankylosaurus_ and pins it underfoot, ensuring it has no way out before she snaps her jaws directly on its head.
-   In _Kill Bill_, after the Bride plucks out Elle Driver's remaining eye, she drops the eyeball on the floor and squishes it under her toes. It seems to just be for her own satisfaction, since Elle can't see her doing it, and it's used to show how much of a Sociopathic Hero the Bride is.

-   Two examples in _Oldboy (2003)_.
    -   Early on in Oh Dae Su's captivity, he tries to beg the guard bringing him food to tell him why he's there, and the guard responds by wordlessly pushing his face back through the metal slot with his feet, then shutting the slot with his foot. The scene is done in one shot and only shows the guard's shoes and the protagonist's face, highlighting the fact that the people holding him prisoner have a complete Lack of Empathy and see what they're doing as any other mundane job. This makes it especially satisfying when Oh Dae Su comes back after escaping and beats the living tar out of every guard there.
    -   After the villain of the film reveals that he tricked the protagonist into having sex with his own daughter, Oh Dae Su tries to beg him not to tell her by licking his shoes. The villain laughs at this.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the _Black Mirror_ episode "USS Callister", the Decoy Protagonist is revealed to be a petty, sadistic creep when he chokes the simulated version of his business partner and then forces him to be his footstool. All sympathy he had from the audience before this point instantly evaporates.
-   _The Boys_
    -   The audience already knows that Homelander is likely a sociopath and narcissist, but what reveals him to be a sadist is him slowly crushing a helpless terrorist's skull under his foot for kicks. He smiles at the results.
    -   After boxing Blindspot's ears so hard that it causes his ears to gush blood, Homelander shows how little he cares about the young supe's excruciating pain by casually stepping over him as if he isn't there while reprimanding Ashley for even considering "a cripple" as a new member of the Seven.
    -   In "Herogasm", Homelander kills a shrunken and severely burnt Termite by squashing him under his heel on his way inside the mansion. While it may appear like an Accidental Murder at first, the fact that Homelander has super hearing implies that he could hear Termite's cries for help.

-   In _The Devil Judge_, Sun-ah does a version of this to the President of South Korea, seemingly for her own satisfaction. She sneaks into his room and takes over for his masseuse, switching from a standard massage to ashiatsu. Almost out of nowhere, she interrupts the President by stepping on his head and pressing his face into the bed, showing that she could easily suffocate him if she wanted to. She stops before he really notices what she was doing, and convinces him that it's just part of the massage. She then harshly steps on his face under the guise of it being a facial massage, but it's clearly causing him a lot of pain. It's implied she does this out of the sadistic satisfaction this trope gives her, and the fact that she can get away with doing this to someone so powerful.

    -   In the same season, Jason tortures one of Eddie's friends by having his goons hold him down while he steps on his hand and threatens to break it. This is the first real hint to the audience that Jason is _not_ a heroic character, no matter how much he acts like he is.

-   In the first episode of _The Young Pope_, Lenny uses the tradition of Archbishops kissing his feet upon coronation as an excuse to force one that he dislikes to humiliate himself by doing it, going as far as to needlessly force the old man's head down with his other foot.

    Mythology & Religion

    **Eagle Bearer:** You will die just as you lived, as a coward.
    
-   _Assassin's Creed: Valhalla_: The unscrupulous raider, Birna, is introduced trading insults and threats with her Saxon attackers. One of which is a threat of her doing this to one of them.

This drops the player's honor level by a significant amount, more so than any other decision the player made up until that point.
-   _Tekken_: Nina and Anna Williams have a stomp attack they can only use against prone opponents. If this stomp connects with the opponent's torso, they'll automatically grind their heel into the opponent for extra damage. Morally, the Williams sisters are two of the more openly sadistic characters who enjoy humiliating and brutalizing their opponents.

    Web Animation 

-   _DEATH BATTLE!_: In the final moments of Black Adam vs Apocalypse, En Sabah Nur repeatedly stomps on Teth-Adam's face leaving it increasingly more bloody before lifting him up into the sky to show him that he failed to protect his people when they needed him the most.
