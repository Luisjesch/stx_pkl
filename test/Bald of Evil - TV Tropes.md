The chrome-dome of DOOM!

_"Did you know that bald people are 300 times more likely to commit burglaries and blow up empty warehouses than people with hair? Here at Stark Center for Advanced Rejuvenation Sciences, let us help you keep your hair, and in turn, help keep you out of prison."_

In fiction, baldness often equates with lack of moral fortitude. Many, many villains are recognised as such by the audience by their shiny, shaven noggins. It might be the Corrupt Corporate Executive in a political thriller, the sinister evil sorcerer, unholy priest, cult leader, or Evil Overlord in sword-and-sorcery, or a thuggish Giant Mook readying to crack the hero in two. However, it is most commonly applied to the Evil Chancellor, Mad Scientist and the Evil Old Folks.

Where the hero has his flowing golden locks or a boyish, tousled mop of red or brown hair to indicate his youthful purity, something about the complete _absence_ of hair makes a bald villain look particularly nefarious, especially while he's slouched on his throne, steepling his fingers and delivering a Breaking Lecture while the ominous backlight shines off his gleaming chrome-dome.

This might be a throwback to ancient belief in hair as a symbol of health and virility, as exemplified by the Biblical story of Samson; it may also be more primal still, as a shaven head more closely resembles a skull and, combined with the natural tendency for us to lose our hair as we grow old, is therefore symbolic of aging and death. As a matter of fact, in ancient Rome, baldness was considered a gross deformity. Somehow, that didn't stop the very bald Patrick Stewart from being called "The Sexiest Man on TV" in 1992.

A very specific villain stereotype that provides an example of this is the shaven-headed racist or neo-Nazi skinhead.

Another possible explanation is that narrowing the silhouette of the top of the head visually emphasizes the jaw and teeth, making the character look "brutish".

Whatever the original reason, Hair Hates Evil, and about the only times you'll see a kind and moral character without his (or her) hair will be when it's an egg-headed smart guy (who's probably also in a wheelchair), the Littlest Cancer Patient, and some versions of Bald Mystic, Bald of Authority, and Bald Head of Toughness.

The only other good guys who go shaven are badass Anti Heroes, so if a hero shaves his head as part of an Important Haircut or a Traumatic Haircut, it is a sure sign he's about to get Darker and Edgier.

The tendency is, indeed, for the moral decay of a character to be inversely proportionate to the length of their hair, with innocent, virginal princesses practically drowning in their romantically flowing locks while the hard-bitten badass sports a spiky military crewcut. The most frequent aversion of this trope is the White Hair, Black Heart, whose usually long and luscious tresses exist as a _symbol_ of his evil, not in spite of it.

For the ultimate combination, supply a bald villain with a Beard of Evil. This trope is also a function of Good Hair, Evil Hair. Creepy Hairless Animal and Circling Vultures are animal equivalents.

Taking this trope way beyond its logical extreme, occasional _very_ mad scientist will also shave off their skin and the top of their skull, leaving their brains completely exposed.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Nearly all of the major villains have no hair: Pilaf, both Piccolos (though the latter one has a Heel–Face Turn later and joins the good guys), Frieza, Cell, Majin Buu. They're not exactly bald, though, they just have no hair — with the possible exception of Pilaf, none of them are mammals.
    -   Toriyama might be playing with this a bit. Tenshinhan is a bald villain, but becomes a good guy when he finds out people respect it more. Nappa was a classic "bald" villain (and a classic villain in many respects), but gets trumped by the true hero in mere seconds and replaced by a preferable, haired antagonist.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: The first Big Bad Lordgenome, the Spiral King. Also has the villainous goatee.

-   Ivan the Terrible (or Ivan of Russia, in the Japanese version) from _Giant Robo: The Day The Earth Stood Still_ is bald, though he's not the most nefarious of the evil group he's a part of, even though he may be one of the biggest nutcases in the entire anime. Though, to be fair, one of the guys dead-set on doing good is bald as well.
-   Gluttony of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ looks like an oversized baby, baldness and all, and is a Psychopathic Manchild.
-   All over the place in _Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo_. The Big Bad is Czar Baldy Bald IV, head of the Chrome Dome Empire, and his Mooks are generally bald as well. In fact, their Evil Plan is to make _everyone_ bald.
-   Both played straight and inverted in _Kinnikuman_. Buffaloman, originally introduced as the most powerful Devil Superman in the series, reveals himself to be bald in the following arc. However, the reveal only happens when he officially pulls a Heel–Face Turn.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Vargus, who was initially introduced as a thuggish bully of a Giant Mook that attacked Negi in the Magic World for no reason, though it's later shown that he's actually a lot nicer than he first appeared.
    -   There's also the leader of the Bounty Hunters later on, but he is more of a Punch-Clock Villain; he meets Negi in a bathhouse later "off the clock" and comments that he has no intention of pulling anything.
-   _GaoGaiGar FINAL_: Palparepa, the lead protagonist's evil counterpart, is completely bald.
-   _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_:
    -   In the film adaptation _Do You Remember Love?_, all the Zentradi are bald (though their morality varies considerably).
    -   In the original TV series, Bodolza is very bald and very evil (or at least so mission-oriented as to not care about insignificant things like planetary omnicide).
-   In _Legend of the Galactic Heroes_, three morally questionable characters are bald, though _most_ morally questionable characters are not.
-   The evil school inspector in _Gokusen_. Some villains can make their Scary Shiny Glasses gleam menacingly; this man creates the same effect with the top of his head.
-   In order to illustrate their pre-series Face–Heel Turn, _Tokyo Tribe 2_'s Mera and Skunk both shave their heads. Kai even comments on Mera's shaven head before he becomes aware that he's one of two people that Mera vowed to kill.

-   Inverted with the Kongo twins in _Eyeshield 21_. Unsui's baldness is meant to reflect his monk-like attitude and he's a generally swell guy. His brother, on the other hand, has a huge mane of dreads and is a total jackass. In fact, Agon shaving his head is seen as a mark of improvement in his character.
-   Kazundo Gouda, the Big Bad from _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex: 2nd GIG_, combines baldness with being a Complete Monster and Smug Snake for a formidable trifecta of nastiness.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    
    -   The Paradox Brothers from Duelist Kingdom were evil bald _twins_.
    -   Zigzagged with the Rare Hunter Strings, whom Yami fought to win Osiris, seeing as he was little more than a Meat Puppet for Marik.
    -   Odion was a straight example. As Mai put it on the dub, in his duel against Joey:
    
    Mai: \[Joey\]'s gone too far to lose it all to a creep with a bad attitude. Not to mention a bad hairdo. It's more of a hairdon't.
    
-   _Yaiba_:
    -   Onimaru Takeshi, the Big Bad, sports one.
    -   Also, the fallen monk Seikai Miyoshi.
-   In many H-doujinshi featuring rape, the men are mostly featureless, which includes making them bald.
-   Rikkudo in _Saiyuki_ is a Buddhist monk turned moral-less demon-killer.

-   Kriem when she appears in Episode 18 of _Tiger & Bunny_. It makes sense, really, when you consider that her hair enables her to control inanimate objects to wreak havoc. The hospital staff probably shaved her head so that she wouldn't be able to when she woke up.
-   In the _Ace Attorney_ manga, Robin Wolfe has a bald head that is quite shiny and catches Maya's attention as soon as they meet. The "evil" part comes when it turns out he called an arachnophobic employee to his home, restrained him in a chair in a guest house full of spiders, and left him there for hours, leading him to be Driven to Suicide.
-   In _Fort of Apocalypse_, the main baddies at Shouran are all bald;Hitotsukabuto Kiyoharu and Nakazaki Hitoshi and Kyouichi.

    -   MacDonald "Mac" Gargan, the Scorpion, has always been bald, but it became more noticeable during his stint as Venom due to him being shown bareheaded a lot more.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Lex Luthor is a classic example, particularly considering his Silver Age motive for villainy was _revenge against Superman for making him bald_. And it wasn't really Supes' fault, but Lex blamed him after one of his experiments went wrong. Naturally, this has had fun poked at it several times, such as by Larfleeze during the events of _Blackest Night_. Also, in an episode of _Justice League_, Lex, accompanied by Supergirl and Steel, revealed that he had a secret laboratory... fronted by a _barbershop_.
        
        **Steel:** Gotta hand it to you, Luthor; _nobody_ would think to look for you here.

    -   Bizarro Lex Luthor is bald, as Bizarrogirl points out in her eponymous story arc. She finds it sexy, much to Kara's disgust.

    -   _Superman vs. Shazam!_: Karmang is a completely bald mad scientist and evil sorcerer who intends to obliterate two parallel Earths.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Professor Xavier is _almost_ a textbook example of the "kindly eggheaded Professor" aversion, as he's sometimes portrayed as being morally ambiguous and slightly sinister, and let's not go near his various Super Powered Evil Sides.
    -   Apocalypse had hair in his youth, but as soon as En Sabah Nur went from slave to conqueror, his standard look became bald.

-   _Ant-Man_: Egghead, a foe of The Avengers, an Evil Genius and leader of the second Emissaries of Evil and the third Masters of Evil.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Flash Gordon_:
    -   Prince Barin sported a clean-shaven pate in his first appearances — but when he did his Heel–Face Turn, his hair grew out with astonishing rapidity.
    -   Ming, however, is bald as...someone who is bald. (Although there is a story arc in which he was temporarily turned good by a Mirror Morality Machine he'd intended to use on the heroes — and he too suddenly had a full head of hair for the duration.)
-   In _The Phantom_, many baddies sport bald pates. In General Tara's case, it is possible that the baldness is a choice to indicate virility, since he augments his intimidating dome with a large bushy handlebar moustache (gleamingly waxed) and matching goatee. To indicate his self-indulgent lifestyle, the fat buffoons in the Phantom strips (Tara included) always carry an extra bulge of flab at the base of their shiny skulls.
-   Charles Addams' depiction of Uncle Fester in _The Addams Family_ is utterly bald, without even eyebrows. Like most of the Addams characters, Fester is a bit more on the "demented" side than actually "evil" _per se_.

-   _SnarfQuest_: The Evil Sorcerer Suthaze combines bald of evil with Wizard Beard.

Stand-ins in the form of two of his bald, nameless Mooks from the film (here named Tejada and Sergeant Travis respectively). It's subverted with Tejada and Travis, since the former pulls a Screw This, I'm Outta Here and ultimately ends up helping Monarch, and both of them are quite Affably Evil.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   How do you make Dracula creepier? Give him rat-teeth, long spidery fingernails, bald him up, and call it _Nosferatu_. "Graf Orlok" is so distinctive and has been aped so many, many times that the Nosferatu-type vampire is a trope unto itself.

    -   Renard from _The World Is Not Enough_, and also several of his mooks.

    -   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_: Downplayed and Played Straight. Alan Jonah, the Eco-Terrorist leader and Not-So-Well-Intentioned Extremist Misanthrope Supreme, has a bald spot courtesy of being played by a 71-year-old Charles Dance at the time of filming. Some of Jonah's Mooks who stand out (including a woman) both have bald scalps.
-   Imhotep in _The Mummy Trilogy_; justified as it was the standard hairdo for Egyptian priests. Also, many, many Egyptian villains.
-   _Nadja 1994_: A new version (more or less) of _Dracula's Daughter_. The titular character, Nadja Dracula is a vampire and the daughter of Dracula. In a scene, she is slapped by other character and her wig fails, revealing her bald head.
-   _A Nightmare on Elm Street_: Freddy Krueger rarely ever takes off his battered, old fedora, but when it does, it's obvious he's bald (hair lost in the fire that killed him).

-   In _The Pit and the Pendulum (1991)_, Sinister Minister Torquemada has a shaved head save for an extreme tonsure.
-   Kobras of _The Pumaman_. The guys on _MST3K_ never let him forget it either. Played by Donald Pleasence who was also Blofeld.
    
    **Tom Servo:** Set it to BALD!
    
    -   Pleasance has been a villain many times, and _MST3K_ has also dealt with him in _Warrior of the Lost World_.
-   The Nazi mechanic Giant Mook in _Raiders of the Lost Ark,_ whom Indy fought in a Punch! Punch! Punch! Uh Oh... scenario.
-   In _A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die!_, Telly Savalas plays Major Ward, the insane commander of Fort Holman and personal nemesis of Colonel Pembroke. He intends to rule the area around Santa Fe as his personal fiefdom if the Confederacy wins the war.

-   It's not a big surprise when General Chang from _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_, spear bald with an Eyepatch of Power, turns out to not be the trustworthy advisor to the Chancellor he presents himself as. In fact, he's one of, if not the head architect of the pro-war conspiracy.
-   Nero in _Star Trek (2009)_ pulls this off, combining it with a variant of Tattooed Crook.
-   After the events in _Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith_, both Vader and Sidious are bald and balding, respectively. As was Maul. (In Maul's defense, most men of his entire species are bald, and not all of them are evil.) Conversely, most of the Jedi have long hair.
-   In _Stiletto_, Krieger and Englehart, the head honchos of a neo-Nazi biker gang, both sport shaved heads.
-   Apparently averted with the Lex Luthor in _Superman: The Movie_ (1978), until he's thrown into prison at the end of the movie and removes his toupee during an angry rant.
-   In _The Thirsty Dead_, the mooks the cult sends to Manila to abduct women for Human Sacrifice all have shaved heads.

-   Colonel McCollough shaves his head in _War for the Planet of the Apes_.
-   Fletcher in _Whiplash_ is an over-the-top Sadist Teacher who runs his jazz band like a boot camp. He's willing to verbally and physically abuse his students in the name of pushing them past their limits, and it's suggested that this treatment caused a former student to commit suicide.
-   _Wild Wind_ has an evil bald Nazi officer, and also a heroic bald Russian partisan.
-   Bevan the butler in _Would You Rather_. He's a former MI 5 operative, skilled in torture techniques, and has absolutely _no_ qualms about shooting people dead.
-   _X-Men Film Series_:
    -   _X-Men: The Last Stand_: The Juggernaut keeps his head shaved, probably so his helmet can fit.
    -   _The Wolverine_: Viper after she sheds her skin and looks more evil and like a viper.
    -   _X-Men: Apocalypse_: The title villain, of course, although it's hidden by his helmet. Caliban isn't _evil_ per se, but he works in the black market, and there isn't a hair on this criminal's head.

    Literature 

-   _A Poison Dark and Drowning_: Callax is an Ancient from another world who is said to spirit away and eat children. Henrietta describes his head as perfectly round, bald, and smooth like an egg.
-   Voldemort in _Harry Potter_, to play up the whole reptile angle. To be fair, in his case, Voldemort was so far gone from anything remotely human that having hair at all would have been an accomplishment.
-   Big Bad Vorbis from the _Discworld_ novel _Small Gods_ deliberately shaves and polishes his scalp. Invoked Trope?
-   Lord Tywin Lannister and Varys the Spider are this in _A Song of Ice and Fire_.
-   Something of a subversion: Matilda's father (who has plenty of hair and happens to be unscrupulous) believes that smart people have good, strong hair and that, therefore, bald people are dumb. (Matilda points out that William Shakespeare was bald.)
-   _Harap Alb_, a Romanian folk tale, has "Spânul', "The Bald Man", as the primary Sadist villain. The main character is told that the only thing worse than a bald man is a red haired one...Guess whose daughter he is forced to win over later?
-   Although he was not described specifically in the stories, Sherlock Holmes's Archenemy Professor James Moriarty was presented as being bald in the earliest illustrations of the character. In many later illustrations, he just has a very badly receding hairline, which also makes him look more professorial.
-   Rare female example: in Ian McDonald's _Desolation Road,_ Arnie Tenebrae becomes a psychotic, sadistic warlord. At one point, it's mentioned: "She was busy shaving her head."

-   Darth Bane (the legendary Sith Lord who began the "Rule of Two" tradition among the order) in Star Wars Legends has this all the way down.

-   In _The Dead Zone_, Johnny sees Greg Stillson becoming President and this leading to a nuclear holocaust. In the vision, Stillson has lost almost all of his hair. This leads Johnny to believe it's far enough in the future that he can just wait and see how things develop, rather than take action immediately. Until, that is, Johnny learns he has a brain tumor and won't be around to take action for much longer....

-   Diabolus Darkdoom and his son, Nigel, in _H.I.V.E._, a series about a school for villains. Lampshaded by Nero at one point.
    
    **Nero:** Darkdoom? Oh, _why_ is it always the bald ones?
    
-   _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ has the man with a beard but no hair, who's apparently so evil that Lemony Snicket won't even tell us his name, and the bald man with a long nose, one of Count Olaf's henchmen. In the illustrations, Olaf himself has a noticeable receding hairline.
-   The title character in the _A to Z Mysteries_ book _The Bald Bandit_, who steals from a bank.
-   Sadi, one of the evil eunuchs at Salmissra's court in _The Belgariad_. In fact, most Nyissans shave their heads, if for no better reason to keep out the lice. In _The Malloreon_, Sadi allies with the heroes, takes a level in badass, and later subverts the trope by completing a Heel–Face Turn. Even in the _Belgariad_, by about midway through when Sadi no longer stands to gain anything by opposing the protagonists, having him as the _de facto_ ruler of Ny-Issa is about as welcome a development as could reasonably be hoped for (and certainly better than when Salmissra was in charge in any meaningful way).
-   In _Blood Meridian_, the monstrous giant Judge Holden is utterly hairless, lacking even eyebrows and eyelashes.
-   The Satanists in _Mr Blank_ and its sequel _Get Blank_ deliberately invoke this trope out of their desire to look as evil as possible. Vassily the Whale is also bald and evil, though it's less self-conscious and more about him looking as close to a cetacean in a shiny suit as possible.
-   A rare female example in _The Legendsong Saga_. Coralyn follows the traditional Iridomi practice of shaving her head and wearing wigs or headdresses. Despite supposedly being common practice, Alaude (her minion) is the only other person shown to do this; Iridomi in general are seen as being more evil in general due to association and their poison industry.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: Orcs are usually the other trope, but Eric meets the exception to this rule in _A Mage's Power_. Tahart Ligo is gluttonous, specist, commits unlawful action and is a rapist. "Brute" associations are appropriate here. Eric himself believes him to be a monster.
-   King Septimus from _Sebastian Darke: Prince of Fools_ is revealed to be wearing a wig. He is not proud, to say the least, of his being known as "Septimus the Slaphead."
-   Mostly averted in _The Bad Unicorn Trilogy_, where the sorcerers of the Wizard's Tower, good or evil, often lose their hair as a result of practicing magic. Because of this, there is an entire Guild of Toupee Makers who sell toupees made from the fur of fluff dragons to wizards. Played straight with Evil Sorcerer Rezormoor Dreadbringer, who is one of their customers.
-   Brutus from _The Hunger Games_. However, he just wants to get out of the games alive, which calls his "evil" status into doubt.
-   _Six of Crows_: Although Matthias convinced Nina to spare Jarl Brum, she did leave him "very bald".
-   In _The Lies of Locke Lamora,_ the Falconer, who is The Dragon, is a ruthless, sadistic multiple murder. He is still in his twenties but "his hair was already beating a retreat to the back of his head" — also making him Prematurely Bald.
-   In _Momo_, the Humanoid Abomination Men in Grey are all completely bald.
-   Menacing gangster Sluggsy Morant in the _James Bond_ novel _The Spy Who Loved Me suffers from such severe alopecia that even his nostril hair is absent._
-   In _Ruslan and Ludmila_, the evil wizard Chernomor, who kidnaps the daughter of Prince of Kiev on her wedding night, is completely bald.
-   _Bazil Broketail_: Gog Zagozt is completely bald and just as evil.
-   In his collection of fairy tales from Italy, Italo Calvino mentions in the notes how the characters affected by tigna (a skin illness which causes baldness among various things, though "tignoso" is also a pejorative name for a poor or unimportant person) are either humble but cunning good people or ruthless villains, with their bald head serving as a Red Right Hand. A notable example is the nameless tignoso villain from ''A Ship full of...", who hides his baldness under a black wig to trick and impersonate the protagonist.
-   _De Griezelbus_: After returning as a vampire, Onnoval loses all his hair. He retains this appearance after he becomes a ghost.
-   Stripped of disguise, Qwarm assassins in the _Humanx Commonwealth_ novels are not only bald-headed, but completely hairless all over. Justified as a forensic countermeasure, to ensure they never leave a stray hair or eyelash behind at a murder scene.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Walter White, Mike, Gus and the entire Salamanca family from _Breaking Bad_. Walt's is an Important Haircut shortly after he starts taking treatment and his hair begins to fall out anyway. Walt arguably fluctuates in his 'evilness' exactly in synch with the length of his hair. At his most evil, he even sports a goatee! At the end of the show when he partially redeems himself, he grows back his hair.
    
    **Walter Junior:** _\[seeing Walt bald for the first time\]_ Badass, dad!  
    **Jesse:** _\[ditto\]_ Jeez. You look like... Lex Luthor.
    
-   _The Hexer_: The knights of the Order of the White Rose keep their heads clean-shaved. They are all bunch of bigoted, religious fanatics that are busy with genocide and then work for the Nilfgaard empire.
-   Lex Luthor in _Smallville_ after he turns bad, obviously.

-   Although _Star Trek_ usually averts this trope the Borg were more often than not depicted as bald, especially when fully assimilated.
-   Speaking of Patrick Stewart, he's the Big Bad in The BBC John le Carré serials _Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy_ and _Smiley's People_. When playing the villain in _I, Claudius_, however, he's got hair — either for the above-mentioned 'deformity' reason or because his bald head had not yet become famous.
-   Rare female example: as _Battlestar Galactica_'s president Laura Roslin loses her hair to cancer treatments, she also becomes increasingly totalitarian.
-   _Black Hole High_: Victor Pearson, the series' antagonist, is bald in the present day, but in the 1987 time zone, he has a full head of hair. Almost everything we see of him in this period is sympathetic. He also manages to keep his hair in an alternate timeline where he's a slightly dotty science teacher. The final kicker: in the series finale, which reveals Pearson's ultimately noble motives, Victor is starting to grow his hair back.
-   The Technomages of _Babylon 5_ all shave their heads, for easier access to the brain and spinal column. Their evilness varies from person to person.
-   Subverted with John Locke in _Lost_, but played straight in the season 5 finale, when it is revealed that Locke had been dead since several episodes and that the one who had taken his shape was the Big Bad.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ has a number of bald demons, the most famous of them being The Master, Season 1 Big Bad, and The Gentlemen, from "Hush", the silent episode. Snyder was this to the point where he demonstrated deriving pleasure from Buffy in pain, something not even who he worked for would have much appreciated. There was also Forrest, after being transformed.
-   _Stargate Atlantis_: regular Wraith are evil and have long white hair. In one episode, the heroes confront a Wraith Evil Chancellor, who is extra special evil. And bald.

-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   The Token Evil Teammate of the good guys' side, Roose Bolton, has a receding hairline, instead of his way more over-the-top villainous appearance in the books which included more or less every possible visual cue _aside_ from baldness.
    -   Regardless of his actual morality, Ser Ilyn Payne is terrifying executioner with a shiny dome.
    -   Polliver, the sadistic soldier and Torture Technician.
    -   Theon's brutish crewman Black Lorren.
    -   Styr and the other Thenns combine this with ritual scarification to make them Obviously Evil.

-   _Air Crash Investigation_: David Burke, the man who crashes PSA 1771 to get back at his employers.
-   _The Flying Cestmir_: Mr Blecha is a villainous greedy barber and the antagonist. He's a bald man, but apparently doesn't like it. One of the magical plants "cures" him — his hair grow back for a time.
-   _Masters of Horror_:
    -   In "Incident On and Off a Mountain Road", the primary villain Moonface is a bald albino serial killer.
    -   In "Cigarette Burns", Dalibor is a bald snuff film director. He demonstrates this by murdering someone in front of the protagonist.
-   The Observers who appear for the first four seasons of _Fringe_ avert this, for the most part, ranging from goodhearted to slightly weaselly. Their colleagues the Invaders from season 5 play it straight.

-   In this _Studio C_ sketch, both Bane and Voldemort pretty much admit that the insecurity of being bald makes you evil.
-   Zachariah in _Supernatural_ is a bald angel who regards humans as at best cannon fodder in an Apocalypse he's manipulating for his own ends.

-   _Imposters_: The Doctor is a ruthless crime boss who's also bald.

    Music 

-   In My Chemical Romance's concept record _Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys_, the prominent antagonist, Korse, is obvious bald in both music videos and promotional posters. His character is generally portrayed as an apathetic villain to the story's heroes, who are played by the band.

-   Doctor Steel is bald, and wants to take over the world. (On the other hand he just wants to promote fun, and loves children.)
-   In Joe's Garage, there is a man named Bald-Headed John that repeatedly rapes Joe.
-   One of the visual indicators of the Bond-villain homage protagonist's villainy in the video for _Genghis Khan_ is his completely bald head. (His Tuxedo and Martini inspired enemy turned love interest has a full head of thick hair.)
    -   From the same artists (and with the same actors), the music video for _My Trigger_. The American President has a nice thick head of hair, the Russian leader is bald.
-   Onyx was a Trope Codifier for the "baldhead" look that became synonymous with Hardcore Hip-Hop after _Bacdafucup_ dropped, and their focus on raw, dirty beats and extremely aggressive rapping and lyricism made them one of the hardest acts of their day and fed their image as the hip-hop ensemble that people didn't fuck with.

    Pinballs 

-   The only hair that the villain of _Airborne Avenger_ has is his small handlebar mustache.
-   While not specifically a villain, the Time Machine\-inventing scientist of _Time Machine (Zaccaria)_ combines this with a Kubrick Stare to give an aura of menace.

-   Ming the Merciless from _Flash Gordon_
-   Dr. Evil from _Austin Powers_

    Puppet Shows 

-   _The Mr. Potato Head Show_: Baldness, combined with Beard of Evil and his _name_, Bully-Boy McPherson, are all that's needed to establish Mr. Potato Head's new supervisor as bad news the moment he's introduced.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   King Kong Bundy was the greatest example. Apart from his eyelashes, he was completely hairless.
-   La Ruda Amapola has been shaved bald multiple times in CMLL alone.
-   WWE wrestler Kane became bald when he lost his mask in a match. By no coincidence, this is also when he started getting really, _really_ evil. Like, cackling horror-movie-villain evil.
-   Genki Horiguchi of _Dragon Gate_ calls himself H.A.G.E of Evil (hage is Japanese for bald).
-   The Straight Edge Society in the WWE is a whole stable of these. Inverted in the leader, CM Punk, whose mane is the whole selling point of the gimmick... Punk lost to Rey Mysterio at Over the Limit 2010 and got shaved bald, but it's defied in that he covered it up with a black mask.
-   Randy Orton went bald for a time while he was heel in 2009.

-   Celtic Championship Wrestling has two particularly evil characters who are bald — Dark Messiah Xavier Burns and Ax-Crazy Bedlam Billy.
-   Discussed at the 2016 _Aftershock_ when Long-Haired Pretty Boy Matt Taven stated Christopher Daniels insulted God by shaving his head, unable to understand why someone would throw away such a beautiful gift.
-   For some reason, nearly all of the evil "Russian" wrestlers of the 70s and 80s, most famously Ivan and Nikita Koloff, sported shaved heads (and beards) — Nikita was explicitly told to shave his head "to look Russian" before his first match. What baldness has to do with the USSR remains unclear; it's possible that wrestlers and promoters were simply copying Ivan's appearance, as he was the Trope Codifier for Soviet heels.

    Radio 

-   This even shows up in _Adventures in Odyssey_, a radio show. For a long while during the Novacom saga, Mr. Charles was informally known as "the bald guy."
-   Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo even made up a rule about it (when reviewing _Prince of Persia_).
    
    "Never trust a bald man with mascara."
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   _BattleTech_: This is a common look for bandits and pirates, as they have no militarily justified reasons for their actions, which include pillaging, massacres, and slavery. Perhaps the most well known was Helmar Valsek, a Gonkish Fat Bastard of a man who was a thorn in the side of two of the setting's Great Houses for thirty years and responsible for more than is share of crimes against humanity.
-   _Bleak World_: The Obviously Evil Primal Vampires are completely hairless.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
-   _In Nomine_: As part of his tightly controlled, professional front, Fleurity usually manifests with a smoothly shaved head.
-   _Paranoia_:
    -   Played with in the 2nd Edition art; the "Ultraviolet-Clearance" section contains pictures of a "typical GM", an evil-looking robed fellow who is usually seen cutting up the rules or cracking a whip and is completely bald.
    -   The generic High Programmer depicted in the art of the original edition likewise bears more than a passing resemblance to Uncle Fester of _The Addams Family_.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Artwork of various Chaos leaders, especially sorcerers, usually portrays them as bald, with various Chaos symbols worn on the scalp.
    -   Orks don't have natural hair, but some use specialized hair Squigs as topknots.
    -   This is the universal defining trait of Genestealer Hybrids; regardless of age or gender, they never sport **any** body or facial hair. It's the one trait they just can't inherit.

    Theatre 

-   In _Margin for Error_, Consul Karl Baumer's glistening bald pate makes Moe's line "I get sacked off the force, if a hair of your head gets touched" a bit ironic.

    Theme Parks 

-   Concept art shows that the haunted house _Insanity_ from Universal Studios' _Halloween Horror Nights_ had a scareactor with the thuggish variant, coupled with a wifebeater, a lot of tattoos, and a large knife.

    Video Games 

-   _Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning_ has the Titular Baldi trying to beat you to death with a ruler.
-   _Command & Conquer_:
    -   Kane is an example of the aforementioned bald-with-goatee combo.
    -   Yuri from _Red Alert 2_ also counts and, like Kane, has an evil beard.
    -   Both Raveshaw and later Dr. Petrova after her Face–Heel Turn from _Command and Conquer Renegade_ go bald after becoming genetically warped NOD Super Soldiers.
-   _Finding Light_: The Final Boss and Big Bad, Zamas, is a bald god who wants the genocide of all mortalkind for being too chaotic. The baldness is a hint that Gi is actually his human incarnation.
-   Kratos in _God of War_ is bald with an _antiheroic goatee_, which should tell you everything you need to know about him at a glance.
-   Dr. Baldhead from the first _Guilty Gear_, obviously. Part of the tendency for bald villains to be doctors as well.
-   The same could be said for Agent 47 from the _Hitman_ series, only replace antiheroic goatee with antiheroic barcode on the back of his head.
-   The sorcerer from _Intrepid Izzy_ is bald.
-   A few villains from _Mortal Kombat_. Quan Chi, naturally, and Kano (but only in _MK3_), plus Hsu-Hao, the Dumb Muscle henchman of Mavado. Also, Shao Kahn, although it isn't obvious, seeing as he rarely removes his helmet. Baraka is bald too, but so are all the Tarkata; but then, _all_ of them are evil creatures. D'Vorah from _Mortal Kombat X_ and Kronika from _Mortal Kombat 11_ are female variants.
-   _Sentinel: Descendants In Time_ has Doba, who's holding one of Beni's friends hostage to make him explore Tomb 35. Subverted in the end when we learn Beni's really Ramirez.
-   Two of the entities who pursue you in _Smile_ have no hair. Of course, one of them is missing the top of its head.

-   Doggy Doug from _2Dark_ is bald and evil
-   _Star Trek Online_ gives us Colonel Hakeev, a senior officer of the Romulan Tal Shiar and Big Bad of the Romulan storyline. Obisek, leader of the Reman Resistance, plays this earlier on, but averts it when it's revealed that he and the player are working towards the same goal.
    -   Slamek is this in his sole appearance for non-Romulan players, of a sneaky 'pretends he isn't until the end of the mission' sort. For Romulan players, he is the same in that appearance, while it is only _implied_ that he is this in his earlier appearances. But then, he and Obisek, and many mooks on multiple sides (and quite possibly _you_), are Remans, who are _all_ (including the women) bald, regardless of morality, awesomeness or affiliation.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   _Knights of the Old Republic_ has several examples, including the Big Bad Darth Malak, his apprentice Darth Bandon, and Sith Academy headmaster Uthar Wynn.
    -   Darth Malgus, a prominent Big Bad in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_, is also bald. The similarities between these various Star Wars villains and one of the playable classes can be seen here.<small>◊</small>
-   Calypso in _Twisted Metal: Black_. (He has hair in the rest of the franchise.)
-   _World of Warcraft_ has Garrosh Hellscream. Oh boy, is he a real Bald of Evil...along with Kil'jaeden, who is basically WoW's version of Satan.

-   _Mega Man_: The _Mega Man (Classic)_ series gave us Dr. Wily (who, admittedly, had rather wild hair on the side of his head) and Flash Man (who is not too happy about it in the Archie Comics Adaptation). _Mega Man X's_ Sigma also qualifies.
-   _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_ has Arkham, the sinister cultist helping Virgil in summoning the diabolical Temen-ni-Gru and open up the portal on the Demon World. Complete with giant freaking scar over half his face, in case you had remaining doubts.
-   Bald Bull from _Punch-Out!!_ is a bad guy _built_ around this Trope. As he says in one of his pre-fight quotes, "My barber didn't know when to quit. Do you?"
-   _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_ gives us Master Xehanort, who mixes this with a Beard of Evil and the same outfit that Xehanort's Heartless wore in the first game. He's a good guy, really.
-   _Legacy of Kain_:
    -   Moebius, servant of the Elder God, is a conniving manipulator who eschews hair of any sort and is notably bald even in thousand year old murals depicting his younger days when he led the rebellion against the vampires who ruled over humanity in the past.
    -   Minor characters Azimuth and Marcus, both antagonists, are also bald.
-   The Helghast in the _Killzone_ series are all bald. Apparently, this is a side effect of having emigrated to a Death World.
-   Mr. Big from the _Art of Fighting_ series: a crime boss who kidnapped a teenage girl to blackmail her father and force both her brother and her best friend to fight him.
-   Both Sarevok of _Baldur's Gate_ and Jon Irenicus of _Baldur's Gate II_ had shaven heads.
-   Bitores Mendez, one of the villains of _Resident Evil 4_, was both bearded and bald. In fact, he looked a lot like Rasputin.
-   Both Earthquake and Gen-An Shiranui in _Samurai Shodown_. Granted, Gen-An has two or three hairs, but he's still an overall baldie.
-   _Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin_ has Brauner, who seems to be an Orlok double. Still second fiddle to Dracula, though.
-   Neff, the main bad guy from _Altered Beast (1988)_.
-   Dr. Elvin Atombender, the Mad Scientist from _Impossible Mission_, making this Older Than the NES.

-   Every bad guy in _inFAMOUS_.

-   _StarCraft_: The Dark Templar was a definite subversion. On the first game, they were largely regarded as a bunch of dark, shady heretics. One of their defining traits is that they don't have tendrils on the backs of their heads (the protoss equivalent of hair), making them essentially bald. Zeratul is the most obvious example. It turns out that they are actually one of the most heroic characters in the game. This, in turn, makes the Dark Templar a straight example of Important Haircut.
-   _Both_ the male Geniuses in _Evil Genius_.
-   _Assassin's Creed_:
    -   Robert de Sable is the bald Big Bad (mostly) of the first game.
    -   The Priest from _Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood_ is a bald Templar.
-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   Hot Coldman from _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_, and he's quite evil, all right. Coincidentally, he is also voiced by Mugihito, who voiced Sigma.
    -   In _Metal Gear Solid 2_, we have Fatman, who, aside from, well, what he is named for, is also bald (the script implies that his baldness is the result of severe burns). Similar to Coldman, he is a very horrible person.
-   In _Jade Empire_, all of the Lotus Assassins shave their heads.

-   The Chaos Cultists and Big Bad Lord Zymran from _Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate_.
-   Patches from _Demon's Souls_ and _Dark Souls_. He's hairless, seems pretty nice but will inevitably backstab the player and attempt to kill him, especially if he/she happens to be a cleric.

-   A receding hairline/shaven head is a fairly reliable identifier of evil (or at least antagonistic) characters in the _Dragon Age_ series:
    -   Uldred, Caladrius, and Zathrian from _Dragon Age: Origins_ all fit the trope.
    -   Ser Alrik from _Dragon Age II_.
    -   Solas, your Evil Mentor, from _Dragon Age: Inquisition_.
-   _The Adventures of Lomax_ has Evil Ed, the game's Big Bad. He does have some hair on the sides of his head, though.
-   In _Dishonored_, the Royal Spymaster is bald. The High Overseer's head is shaved as well.
-   _Fire Emblem_, having a huge cast, has several bald villains. The series also has a recurring pair of bandits, both of whom have shaved heads in every appearance.
    -   Medeus, the Dragon Big Bad of _Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon_ and _Mystery of the Emblem_ has a hairless head in his human form, likely due to his age.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, there's Cervantes, one of Walhart's generals. He makes up for the baldness with a _glorious_ mustache. It's a tad downplayed though, as compared to Walhart and his other generals, Cervantes is played in more a comedic light.
    -   In _Fire Emblem Fates_, Hans is an Ax-Crazy soldier of Nohr with a shaved bald head and a desire to get ahead in life, no matter who he has to kill or torture. He also was a former criminal who committed many offenses before King Garon pardoned him. Fittingly, he's of the Berserker class. Fuga is a subversion though: yes, the Avatar has to fight him in all three paths, but it's more because of a Secret Test of Character rather than him being evil (and misunderstandings due to Nohrian trickery). Once the Avatar proves his/her worthiness to Fuga, he becomes more helpful, providing the army with valuable information in all three paths, an ally in his adopted son Hayato in _Birthright_ and _Revalations_ and eventually joins the army himself in _Revelations_. As a monk, he fits the exception to the trope.
-   _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ has Officer Frank Tenpenny, a corrupt police officer who often abuses his position as the officer of the law by making profits off of drug trades and manipulate the gangs of Los Santos by making business with the main character's rival gangs. That doesn't even mention the fact that he even threatens to frame the main character for homicide by compelling him to do his dirty work and murders anyone who attempts to expose him.
-   Pretty much every single Mook in _Hotline Miami_ and _Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number_ is bald. In particular, members of the Russian mafia all appear to be mandatorily clean-shaven; this is however inverted by the mafia bosses in both games, who have long, unkempt hair.
-   _Rides With Strangers_, Donald McArthur (The Father) is a 51 year old priest who's actually a serial child rapist/torturer/murderer and wants to "purge" the world of "whores" and "heretics". He has no head hair other than sideburns.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, prior to siding with the good guys due to his actions as The Atoner, St. Jiub the Eradicator, who drove the much reviled Cliff Racers from Vvardenfell between the events of _Morrowind_ and _Oblivion_, led a very sordid life as a skooma addict and freelance assassin, fitting this trope instead.
-   _Moshi Monsters_ has two of the evil creatures known as Glumps be bald: Rocko and Bruiser.
-   Masayoshi Shido from _Persona 5_ qualifies for this big time. He's a corrupt politician leading a conspiracy that plans to use an alternate world to manipulate others for their own gain, and just an unlikeable prick in general. He's directly responsible for the protagonist's circumstances, as he sues Joker after he attempts to stop Shido's drunken assault on a woman. Given the reach and influence he has in the justice system, this gets Joker branded as a delinquent and put on probation. He also left his girlfriend after she became pregnant, fathering Goro Akechi in the process, who he treats as a (albeit useful) lackey.
    -   A minor example in the same game is Kobayakawa, the principal of Shujin Academy. He doesn't care about anything other than the reputation of the school, going so far as to turn a blind eye to Suguru Kamoshida's constant abuse to his students. He's also a low-ranking member of the conspiracy, and tries to force student council president Makoto Niijima to expose the Phantom Thieves' identities.
-   Martin Bormann, a prominent Nazi functionary and one of the most likelt successors to Hitler in Nazi victory Alternate History mod for _Hearts of Iron_ called _The New Order Last Days Of Europe_, was already balding in the last years of his life in OTL. By the start date of the mod in 1962, he is completely bald.
-   _Creature Crunch_ has Wesley get transformed into a half-boy/half-creature by a bald Mad Scientist named Dr. Drod, who gloats that he is putting together an army of creatures to take over the world.
-   Sorsley Ende from _Triangle Strategy_ is a greedy racist who oversees Hyzante's salt harvest and shipment. He takes salt off the official records and sells it illegally to line his own pockets, and he treats the Rosellan slaves who produce the salt like garbage; at one point, Sorsley casually orders his attendant, Booker, to kill a Rosellan who was begging for water. Naturally, Sorsley is also the only one of the Saintly Seven (Hyzante's governing body) who is shown to be completely bald.
-   _Uncharted_:
    -   Big Bad Zoran Lazarevic from _Uncharted 2: Among Thieves_. A murderously insane Serbian war criminal with plans on conquering the world by discovering the lost city of Shambhala and its formidable Cintamani sap. The first thing we see him do upon being introduced to the game is knife one of his men to death for stealing from him before bellowing about how he's _surrounded by traitors and fools_.
    -   Subverted by Charlie Cutter from _Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception_. Initially, he appears to be your average hardened Cockney thug, attacking Nate and Sully in a London bar, but he's actually working with Nate and Sully all along, and is implied to be in a relationship with Nate's other friend, Chloe Frazer. What makes this even more surprising is that Lazarevic and Cutter are both voiced by the same man, the equally-bald but really nice guy Graham McTavish.
-   _Whiplash_: Genron is an amoral company that specalizes in cruel, over the top Animal Testing. A good large portion of the male Genron employees are bald.
-   _The Twins (2020)_: Bob is completely bald and a murderous cannibal and robber. Of course, his brother Buck who does have hair is just as bad.
-   _Joe Dever's Lone Wolf_: All Vordaks, in virtue of being seriously decomposed, lack hair, as well as pity and morals. Warlord Gunzar, the Big Bad, is almost entirely shaved, except seemingly for a long mane of gray hair around his nape which is hard to spot. Almost all the other Drakkarim at his service have a similar, but less extreme haircut, or full helmets.

    Visual Novels 

-   Although Mafia boss Bruto Cadaverini never actually appears in the third _Ace Attorney_ game, his profile picture<small>◊</small> reveals quite an impressive Bald Of Evil.
-   _Famicom Detective Club: The Girl Who Stands Behind_: Genjiro had no strand of hair on his head in life and was such a scummy con artist and Loan Shark, he drove Teruhiko Uchida to suicide after taking away his factory.
-   Vigagi and Sikalog, both of the Inspectors from _Super Robot Wars_. The first shaves his head bald (or so he says, and doubles as a Berserk Button), and the second was apparently born that way.

    Web Animation 

-   The Mastermind's bald head is just one of the many contributing factors to his evil appearance.

    Webcomics 

-   _Bronze Skin Inc._: Raimundo Marvires is the recurring antagonist of the series, and has a bald head.
-   Dr. Steve from _Sluggy Freelance_ fits this trope so closely he may or may not be a Lex Luthor parody.
-   _Everyday Heroes_
-   Vilrath from _Dominic Deegan_. Even though it was just Jacob wearing Vilrath's skin.
-   Richard from _Looking for Group_ is most likely bald, since one statue depicting a hoodless near-lookalike of him was bald, a glimpse of him having his head healed didn't show any indication of hair, and an early page where we see an x-ray version of Richard didn't show any hair outlines. Also, we get a few "up-hood" shots, and the fact that the scarily-similar Sisters have little-to-no-hair themselves does not help matters.
-   _The Law of Purple_: Silver is bald.
-   _Dr. Nonami_: Aside from his mustache, Mechano is bald.
-   _Trevor (2020)_: Downplayed: Dr. Smithe has a combover, and wistfully admits that he will miss the sound of Trevor’s screams.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, "Scarf" the aberration doesn't appear to have any hair on his head, though it's covered up by a hat.
-   Vehemence (aka Kevin) in _Grrl Power_. He's bald, and evil in that he started a fight with ARCHON at a restaurant (which caused a bit of damage to the building, parking lot, and at least one vehicle); he also roped more than 50 other people into joining in, largely because his powerset worked better the more people around him fought. A few of his 'recruits' ended up being arrested, mainly due to pre-existing warrants, and he ended up in a specialized holding cell to reduce the chance he could power up again.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: The comic has only two major characters who are bald, and they're both members of The Seven. Solomon David is a brutal God-Emperor whose baldness is accentuated by his massive, luscious beard, while Jagganoth is an omnicidal Destroyer Deity who has no hair whatsoever, neither on his head nor a beard, presumably as a side-effect of his body heat being strong enough to melt stone on impact.

    Web Original 

-   _SCP Foundation_, SCP-973 ("Smokey"). He appears to be a balding Caucasian male. He ruthlessly kills speeders in horrible ways, including evisceration and rape.

    Web Videos 

-   Dr. Phineas Waldorf Steel, complete with a Beard of Evil. Arguably a nice guy, but definitely Evil Overlord\-Mad Scientist themed.
-   _The Adventures of the League of S.T.E.A.M._: In "Dead End", it's revealed that the heroes are opposed by a league of bald-headed villains. Their penalty for failure is to have a wig glued to one's head.

-   _SuperMarioLogan_: In "Cody's Evil Twin", both Cody and Junior's look-alikes are completely bald just to make sure that you know that they are Evil Twins.

-   _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ foe Sedusa became this after she lost her hair. (In fact, that was the motive for her Roaring Rampage of Revenge.) It didn't seem to hurt her skills as a Femme Fatale, however, as she was able to use her charms to coerce the Gangrene Gang into working for her.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_
    -   Zuko was at his most evil when he had the least hair. (Maybe his ponytail is symbolic of his inner goodness.)

-   Asajj Ventress from _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_, one of the few female Balds of Evil and surprisingly good looking.

-   _The Venture Bros._ has Baron Ünterbheit. The show, however, also subverts this trope in that Rusty Venture is bald and Brock shaves his head at the end of Season 3. On the other hand, it might not be so much of a subversion, when you consider the fact that it would be difficult indeed to ever see Rusty or Brock as anything close to being _good_ — one's a Jerkass and the other is a Sociopathic Hero.
-   In the _Superman: The Animated Series_ episode "Prototype", a cop who's Drunk on the Dark Side as the result of using a thought- controlled Powered Armor shaves his head to "ensure conductive contact".

-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_: Eustace can lean towards this trope at times, especially in the infamous episode "Ball of Revenge", where he hired Courage's past foes to murder Courage and would even go as far to use Muriel as bait to do so.
-   _American Dragon: Jake Long_: While being masked for most of the series, once The Huntsman reveals his face (in his last five or so minutes left of screen time before he gets Killed Off for Real), he fits the bill.

-   Big Bad Bowser in _Super Mario Bros. (DiC)_, unlike in the video games.

-   Abraham Kane, the Big Bad from _Motorcity_, who also has a Beard of Evil.

-   Zaheer in _The Legend of Korra_ is a Noble Demon but nevertheless a dangerous anti-goverment anarchist.

    -   Downplayed in _Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get A Clue!_ with the show's main villain Dr. Phineas Phibes, who's scalp is barely covered up by his comb-over.

-   Inverted on _Total Drama_ with Heather, the Alpha Bitch main antagonist of the first season . She frequently shows off her long black hair while mocking the other contestants. In "I Triple Dog Dare You!" her hair is unwillingly shaved off as karma for her actions, leaving her bald during the second season. Ironically, after losing all her hair, she's less of a villain and becomes _more_ sympathetic and borderline pathetic, and desperately seeks out opportunities to wear wigs.
-   In _PAW Patrol_, the main antagonist, Mayor Humdinger, is balding (likely due to age, seeing that all the other antagonists are much younger and have full heads of hair).
