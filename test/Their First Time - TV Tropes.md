_Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest,  
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again, ooo  
I wouldn't change a stroke, 'cause, baby, I'm the most  
With a girl as fine as she was then._

Related to Will They or Won't They?, Their First Time is when a couple decides to have sex for the first time. Or at least talk about it. The more planning they put into it, the less likely it is to happen.

The fact that the fictional sex act tends to happen in a spontaneous moment is the Unspoken Plan Guarantee in action. When someone spends time researching sex, thinking it over, or talking about it with her intended partner, this lessens the odds it will actually happen. This usually ends with the couple calling a halt until they're "ready." On the other hand, when circumstances have put the two together with no warning, "ready" happens in about 30 seconds — just enough time to ask "Are you sure?" before then going for it. What's implied is that the less conscious thinking about it, the better. (Or perhaps all the thinking they've already done has only heightened their anticipation.)

With teenagers, this could well be the entirely unintended reaction between the opposite approaches to sex among teenagers; writers who depict it as harmless and are willing for the characters to have sex won't require the incessant talking beforehand, while those who are less comfortable (or whose audiences are) will be sure to avoid it, or depict it as bad, but either way be sure to have _lots_ of angsty talking about it.

Keep in mind, the trope is _Their_ First Time. It doesn't necessarily have to mean that either party is a virgin, only that it's the first time for those two particular people.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Chapters 137 to 139 of _Ai Yori Aoshi_ are dedicated to Aoi and Kaoru finally being able to have sex, after they're able to say "screw you" to their families and stay together.
-   Tatsumi and Mine are implied to have done the deed together in Chapter 50 of _Akame ga Kill!_, having started dating a few chapters prior. It's confirmed that they did in the final chapter, where Mine is revealed to be pregnant.
-   Promiscuous (only in theory) Yamada of _B Gata H Kei_ tries to do this, failing miserably in hilarious ways. The entire show revolves around it; there's a reason one of the alternate titles is "Yamada's First Time."
-   Guts and Casca of _Berserk_ have their first time at the end of Volume 9 in Chapters 46 and 47 (also in the third episode of _Berserk: The Golden Age Arc_). Neither of them are very experienced in the act, Casca being a virgin, and Guts having a very ugly prior sexual experience. When Guts flashbacks to his rape at the hands of Donovan in the middle of the act, it very nearly results in Casca getting strangled to death. But after Guts comes to his senses and bares his soul to Casca, Casca gives herself to him, and the two more than proceed to make up for how it started.
-   _Bloom Into You_: Touko and Yuu have sex in the penultimate chapter, in which Touko invites Yuu over to her home while her parents are away.
-   _Bokura no Hentai_ doesn't present these too positively:
    -   Tamura's first time was while he was crossdressing, because his crush was straight and wasn't attracted to boys. Tamura ends up passing out due to the pain.
    -   Ryousuke and his girlfriend Hacchi have their first kiss which leads into this, but Ryousuke kept thinking of Marika the entire time.
    -   Subverted with Marika and Tamura. She stops before anything happens. Though earlier in the manga Tamura did touch her, which depending on your definition counts.
-   Subverted in episode twelve of _Btooom!_. After Taira dies and Himiko confirms to Ryota that she is indeed the girl he fell in love with online, they kiss and start foreplay. However, Ryota realizes that Himiko, while willing, is _terrified_ because of her PTSD from Attempted Rape, so he stops and just cuddles with her. This is treated as part of Ryota's maturation.
-   _Cross Ange_: In Episode 22, after Tusk returns from his Disney Death in the previous episode, Ange gives him a Slap-Slap-Kiss, then, just to convince herself that he is indeed real and not dead, she mounts him and orders him not to go anywhere, as the tune of "Necessary" kicks in. They proceed to make love next to the ocean, finally ending the Unresolved and Belligerent Sexual Tension that had been building since Episode 5. It is notable for being the one sex scene in the show that isn't solely fanservice or a rapey form of Fan Disservice, and the entire scene is wholly tender and romantic. According to Tusk when he later fights Embryo in Episode 24, he and Ange went on for three days and nights.
-   A plot point in _Crying Freeman_. Both Yoh Hinomura _and_ Emu Hino are virgins, and since she witnessed one of his murders, she's his soon-to-be victim. When Yoh goes to her Big Fancy House, Emu tells him that he _can_ kill her and she won't refuse... but as her last wish, she asks him to do it with her. Yoh tells Emu that he's a virgin too and accepts to be her first and last - and not only do they "deflower" each other, but he falls for her and takes her in.
-   Surprisingly, it's the Beta Couple of _DARLING in the FRANXX_ Mitsuru and Kokoro who end up in bed together first instead of Hiro and Zero Two. In episode 17, having found a book on childbearing in Ruins of the Modern Age in an earlier episode, Kokoro propositions Mitsuru. He initially rebuffs her, but after the group is confronted by the Nines and their COs, who insist their reproductive organs and emotions are just needed to pilot the FRANXX and an inconvenience otherwise, the pair sleep together in what is as much an act of defiance as an expression of their love.
-   The very first page of _Domestic Girlfriend_ starts with Natsuo and Rui losing their virginities to each other just for the experience. Neither of them is particularly impressed. When Natsuo starts dating Rui's sister Hina and they have sex, she is surprised that he actually knows what he's doing because she doesn't realize he's already had sex (and learned his lesson from those mistakes).
-   Subverted between Clara and Mei in _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_. Their first time together was in _"Honey Hold me Tight's"_ first chapter, except Clara was possessed by a parasite at the time. Once the parasite was destroyed, they lost all conscious memory of the event. So as far as they're aware, their first time wasn't until the third chapter - when Clara gives Mei her virginity.
-   In _Fushigi Yuugi_, Miaka and Tamahome decide to just go for it (Miaka's Virgin Power be damned!), because they're about to face Nakago and don't know if they'll survive to do the deed again. So they get started... and Miaka's stomach growls, which embarrasses her and turns off Tamahome. They finally do the deed on their honeymoon later, and Miaka gets pregnant. Which is VERY important in the _Eikoden_ novels.
-   A minor subplot in _Futari Ecchi_ has Makoto Kawada's teenage sister Jun and her sexual self-discovery, which of course includes this. Not to mention, Makoto and Yura _were_ both virgins in their wedding night (which was hilariously awkward), and pretty much the whole manga is about having this as a starting point to improve their sex life.
-   Pretty much the whole chapter 52 of _Future Diary_ is dedicated to Yukiteru and Yuno "becoming one", the "happy end" foretold by Yuno's future diary at the start of the series. Twisted soon after, as Yukiteru decides this peaceful afterglow is the best time to confront Yuno about Akise's dying message and she goes Ax-Crazy. Which is to say, she's still in her underwear, but now she's chasing him and literally trying to kill him with an axe.
-   In _Girl Friends (2006)_, Akko tries to have her first time with a guy at a party. However, he's unable to get it up, and it never ends up happening. The two are both so embarrassed by it (him that he failed to perform, she that she wasn't able to turn him on) that they both agree to pretend they did go through with it. In reality, Akko's first time is with Mari after they get together, and goes by much more smoothly.
-   _The Great Snake's Bride_: Miyo and Daija have a difficult time consummating their relationship since Miyo is an average human woman and Daija is a snake the size of a house.

-   _GTO: The Early Years_: In Chapter 135 ("Night of the Young Lovers"), Ryuji and Nagisa do it for the first time (with their friends sleeping just on the other side of a curtain).

-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_:
    -   It's hinted at multiple points throughout the series and outright confirmed in chapter 138 that Kashiwagi and Tsubasa slept together for the first time during summer break.
    -   Kaguya and Shirogane have their first time in Chapter 220 when Kaguya stays the night at Shirogane's apartment while his father and sister are out. It wasn't fully intended, however. While Shirogane at first definitely wanted to do it with Kaguya, her anxiousness led him to asking if they should wait. They settled for holding it off before sharing a kiss... and then Smash Cut to next morning where Kaguya and Shirogane are laying under the covers naked. According to Kaguya, their kissing got them excited to the point of having sex, anyways.
-   _Maison Ikkoku_: Godai and Kyoko finally sleep together in chapter 149.

-   Subverted in the _Sword Art Online_ anime adaptation. At the point in the web novel and the books where Kirito and Asuna trade virginities, in the anime they spend the night in bed together but don't actually have sex: Asuna is willing but they're both too nervous to actually do the deed.

-   _Spider-Man_: The first openly sexual relationship Peter had with any of his girlfriends was with Mary Jane Watson and the end of _The Amazing Spider-Man (1963)_ #149 is generally acknowledged as the consummation of their love, albeit via a Sexy Discretion Shot:
    
    **Peter**: Mary Jane! Lady, am I ever glad to see you.

    **Peter**: Come here...and I'll show you. _(Shuts door to the reader)_.

    Fan Works 

-   _Advice and Trust_: After getting together Shinji and Asuka spent a while trying to define the limits of their Secret Relationship. During a talk Shinji told Asuka that, even if making out was nice, he was willing to take it slow because their relationship was special and he did not want to screw it up. Later, after nearly getting killed by Leliel, Asuka tells Shinji that she wants to bond with him completely because they might get killed at any time and she does not want to have any regrets. So they have sex that night.
-   In _Angel of the Bat: Times of Heresy_, after some build up and a particularly good date, Cassandra's girlfriend Sadie attempts to initiate the couple's first intercourse.

-   _As Fate Would Have It_: Following their Relationship Upgrade and several subverted attempts, Nate and Yancy finally do it for real in Chapter 13.

After some time spent together dancing, they end up making love after some Tickle Torture. While the act is not shown, Akio and Ryuko are shown laying in bed together, under the covers and fully naked, the next morning.
-   In _Best of My Love_, it's subverted at one point after Meng Yao, who is on the ace spectrum and thus is very infrequently interested in sex, loses interest midway through after initiating and then panics. Lan Xichen immediately stops and calms him down. Their actual first time, later in the fic, is a mixture of funny and heartwarming when Meng Yao is _finally_ comfortably ready to do the deed and texts Lan Xichen — who was at breakfast with his family and hurries across town.
-   In _Black Sky_, Xanxus and Dorea's wedding night is that, as Dorea used a bridal ritual to bond with her groom and it wouldn't have been efficient if both parties hadn't been virgin.
-   _Bridge to Terabithia 2: The Last Time_ ends its final chapter with Jess and Leslie, both 18 at this point, finally doing it, the day before they're leaving Lark Creek for university.

-   The _My Hero Academia_ fanfic _burn it all down_ uses this as a plot device.
    -   There is special attention given to Hawks and Dabi's first time, as Hawks is a Technical Virgin (he only had intercourse with a woman before and it's unclear how far it went as he realized for sure that he's gay, and never had sex with a man before). Dabi, who was originally just planning for a quick fuck, is completely taken aback by this casual admission, and asks Hawks repeatedly to clarify _exactly_ how much experience he has with men (none). Afterwards he completely switches gears and becomes incredibly attentive while taking it slow and checking for consent and discomfort every step of the way. This becomes a turning point for the rest of the fic, as Hawks' Moral Dilemma about losing his virginity to the villain he was supposed to spy on leads to a long series of Disaster Dominoes that leads to torture, uncovering a huge Government Conspiracy, and a truly astounding level of property damage. On a less disasterous note, Hawks takes the lessons of that first time to heart, which comes in handy when Dabi opens up about his past of being raped, as Hawks refuses to engage in Dabi's horrible coping mechanisms of dealing with that trauma, making it clear that being kind and attentive was the standard _he_ set and he was going to stick to that.
    -   Shouto and Bakugo's first time is also briefly mentioned (though not shown in any detail due to the two of them being underage), but also becomes plot critical. The location they pick is Hawks' apartment, which as a result of the Disaster Dominoes mentioned above is bugged by the Hero Commision after they become suspicious of Hawks. This leads to them attempting to kidnap Bakugou to use him as leverage.

In chapter 43, after considerable soul-searching, healing and counseling and spending a while opening up and reaching out each other Asuka asks him if he can promise her he will _never_ leave her. They talk for a while, baring their souls, and Shinji promises, assuring her that he loves her and he is hers. Then they make love.
-   _Displaced (The Legend of Zelda)_: Up until chapter 48, Link and Zelda have refrained from having sex since Link believes it will damage Zelda's reputation; Zelda points out everyone knows they're a couple (some even think they're married), and already assume they're having sex and don't care. They proceed to do the deed.

It takes them having a talk about it for Ash to finally take the step and do it, knowing that she wants it too.
-   The _RWBY_ fanfic ''The First Times'', unsurprisingly, deals with this. It starts with Nora relating the time she took Ren's virginity, which involved her on top, candles that were not merely scented, and the entire building being a disaster zone when they left. Everyone is horrified when Ren confirms it's all true. Team RWBY then decide to tell their significant others about their own first times. Yang used a transfer student for practice due to knowing he was leaving the next day; it wasn't horrible, but it shows how freaked out she was that despite being impulsive and flighty, she planned the entire event down to the second. Blake was sold into prostitution for a few months following a surge in anti-Faunus racism; despite both the pimp and the john being surprisingly compassionate about the entire situation, she hardly enjoyed herself. Weiss secretly hooked up with a lesser noble girl at a homophobic rich kid retreat; when the girl got outed and dropped off the face of society, Weiss cut her out of her life with hardly a second thought—she's more worried that it means she's a sociopath. Ruby actually didn't have a first time at this point, but after hearing Weiss' story, she and Weiss make love for the first time. While Yang, Blake, and Team JNPR play games in Team JNPR's room. Yang wears noise-cancelling headphones that don't seem to help.

Each story is meant to be a Sex Comedy involving Bizarre Alien Biology and/or Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex, with Robin being made into both a Sex God and an Iron Butt Monkey.
-   _Nobody Dies_ plays with the trope in all sorts of interesting ways. Shinji and Asuka are in love, but due to several complications (Shinij's concern over Asuka's fragile mental and emotional state, lingering doubts on Asuka's part as to Shinji's deeper feelings toward her, etc.) have been avoiding taking that step. It takes an encounter with Lilith to get them to do it. While Yui is furious with Shinji (since they're still 16, and despite the rather logical and mature attitude they took toward it), the rest of NERV is quietly celebrating the Relationship Upgrade.

Bridgette also discovers Geoff is a million times better than Alejandro, if you know what we mean.
-   In the backstory of _Risen_, Scott Summers and Jean Grey had sex for the first time the night they got together.
    
    She found herself remembering the first time they had danced and the subtle transformation he had undergone, becoming more self-assured, less nervous; she had realized at that moment that this was \*love\*, that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with this man and die in his arms. Later that night he had told her how he felt, and she knew it was right; without hesitation she had taken him into her heart and her bed and had never looked back.
    
-   Played for Drama in _Scar Tissue_. After Third Impact, Asuka and Shinji were left alone with their respective traumas.

He felt horrible about the experience but did not stop Asuka in an attempt to make up for his past actions.
-   _The Second Try_: After getting together in the post-apocalyptic world, Shinji and Asuka's relationship progressed slowly and steadily.

So he would wait until she felt ready. In chapter 13, Asuka finally decided going a little further and she and Shinji bonded.
-   The Marvel Cinematic Universe fic "Tingle" features a polyamory relationship between Peter Parker, Kate Bishop and Yelena Belova, with one of their first rules being that they will only have _sex_ when all three of them are ready even if they have no problem with two going on dates without the third.

-   _Above the Shadows_: Holly has never had sex, which given that she's invisible to most people isn't too surprising, as she confesses when getting intimate with Shayne. In fact, she isn't even sure what to do (this seems less believable). Regardless, she loses her virginity to him offscreen.

-   _Juno_: In the first couple minutes of the movie via flashback exposition. Less about love, though, and more about two teens just being bored. In an interview in BUST magazine, Diablo Cody said that it was only Paulie Bleeker's first time but not Juno's. That much is implied in Juno's narration: "I hate it when adults use the term 'sexually active.' What does that even mean? Can I deactivate someday, or is this some sort of permanent state of being? I'm guessing Bleeker went live that night we did it, and that's why he got that look on his face."
-   _Lady Bird_: Lady Bird's first time with her Jerkass boyfriend Kyle is awful and unsatisfying. He doesn't try to guide her, makes no effort to really please her, and ends up climaxing extremely quickly.

Kyle's unapologetic when she voices her dissatisfaction and then outright mocks her for thinking he would try to make her first time special.
    
    **Lady Bird:** I just wanted it to be special.  
    **Kyle:** Why? You're going to have so much un-special sex in your life.  
    **Lady Bird:** I was on top! Who the fuck is on top their first time!?

While neither of them are virgins and they've already had oral sex at least twice at this point, it's nonetheless a big step in their relationship, especially since it's the first time Alex has been with a man in such a fashion.

This contributes to Raymond's growing sexual frustration and the later sexual encounter he has with his mother.
-   Happens in _The Spectacular Now_, and plenty of cast and directors interviewed about it discuss how they sought to make it more natural and less idealized. A deleted scene reveals, though, that it wasn't Aimee's first time, which was when she was 14 and the guy was 20.
-   _Stealing Beauty_ has a scene midway through the film of the younger members of the cast talking about their first times over drinks and weed.

Main character Lucy is a virgin and partly visited Tuscany hoping to meet back up with the boy who sent her an unsigned love letter after a previous visit. She nearly has her first time twice (she has a panic attack the first time, with Niccolo, because the setting resembles what her mother wrote in her diary about when Lucy was conceived out of wedlock, and the second time the man is too drunk and passes out on her sofa).

At a total loss, she used the shoebox her bridal shoes had come in and stuck it under the bed.

Or Xander's _actual_ first time with Faith, to whom he meant nothing to and got his feelings hurt. Then she nearly killed him when he came back for seconds. Not to mention Dawn, who never had sex but tried to with a hungry Vampire and a jock who'd accidentally brainwashed her with his jacket. Anya's first time with Xander didn't go as planned either because he was still in her system and he was still acting like a jerk to her.

She apologized to Kenny afterward, ending the spell. They then parted ways on good terms.

They were making out when she reached over his head to get some condoms. This reaching pushed her boobs into his face, and she kept wiggling on top of him to get to the condoms. They were quickly unnecessary. Ephram is embarrassed beyond words and extremely upset, and quite realistically, unable to talk about it with anybody. It is implied the next try was successful.
    -   Amy is very insecure about her first time ever with Ephram whom she imagines is very experienced from his relationship with Madison. Her cool grandma assures her it is new and strange every time you have a new partner.
-   _Farscape_: In one episode Crichton and D'Argo have to prove they aren't possessed by an energy being so they share personal details such as when they lost their virginities. Crichton claims he lost his when he was 16 to a girl named Karen Shaw, but a later episode reveals that "Karen" was actually a time-travelling Chiana. Young John assumed that her grey skin was part of a Halloween costume.
-   _Felicity_'s title character played out this trope with David, her boyfriend at the time, complete with spontaneous reversal.
-   _First Kill_: In the first episode Cal and Juliette lose their virginities together (or Juliette does at least-Cal had a girlfriend before).
-   _Friday Night Lights_ had the episode "I Think We Should Have Sex", a Title Drop that briefly summarized the mindset of Julie Taylor. It's widely regarded by fans as one of the best episodes of the first season.
-   Lucky Spencer and Elizabeth in _General Hospital_.
    -   For that matter, can we mention how long it took Dillon Quartermaine and Georgie Jones to finally manage to have sex?
        -   And among their many issues was that during that interim, he lost his virginity to Sage Alcazar, who was a virgin herself until they slept together.
    -   Also done with Jason Quartermaine and Keesha Ward. After she confessed that Their First Time would be _her_ first time, he admitted that it was his first time too, prompting her to wonder how they would know what to do.
    -   Stone and Robin, though the only obstacle was simply that she wasn't ready. He respected her decision to wait, and after nearly a year of dating, she was.
-   _Gilmore Girls_ has had a few examples:
    -   Rory and Dean's first time had no discussion at all (any talk would have probably stopped it, him being married and all) so of course they just did it. After putting it off until marriage (a value Lane didn't even know she had), Lane and Zack's first time was well-planned, long coming and supposedly really romantic. So of course on par with the trope it was horrible — illness, wetness, dirt and discomfort were all present and she got pregnant with twins.
    -   Paris, who lost hers off screen and then talked to Rory about it...and then believed it was the reason she didn't get into Harvard.
-   _Ginny and Georgia_:
    -   Ginny early on has sex with Marcus as her first time, and loses her virginity this way. It later turns out he'd also been a virgin at the time, to Ginny's surprise.
    -   Later, Max's first is with Sophie.
-   _Glee_:
    -   This was a subplot of the first season episode "The Power of Madonna", in which three couples (Emma and Will, Rachel and Jesse, and Finn and Santana) attempt to get it on. Emma and Rachel balk at the last minute, but Finn goes through with it. He then instantly regrets it, because it was totally meaningless and he's really in love with Rachel. (That Santana hates him and is a closeted lesbian can't have made the experience any more enjoyable.)
    -   In the third season episode "The First Time", Artie, who is directing the high school production of _West Side Story_, tells Rachel and Blaine that they're too virginal to play Maria and Tony to his satisfaction. This kicks off a plot full of Aesops about having sex for the right reasons and waiting for the right moment with the right person, and the episode ends with scenes of Rachel and Blaine having (clearly very happy) first-time sex with their respective boyfriends, Finn and Kurt.
-   _Good Omens (2019)_: Anathema and Newt in Episode 4. He'd never had sex because he's hopeless with women, while she'd been instructed to stay a virgin until then by Agnes' prophecies.
-   _Gossip Girl_:
    -   A twisted example on the first season Blair and Nate have been together for a long time, but Blair wants to put off losing their virginity. Nate, however, has already lost his - to Blair's best friend, Serena, an act that partly causes Serena to leave town in shame. Blair seems to have a feeling that Nate likes Serena, because the instant she learns Serena has returned, she drags Nate upstairs from a party for Their First Time - which gets interrupted by Serena's arrival. Soon afterward, Blair plans Their First Time again, only for Nate to choose that moment to tell her about cheating on her with Serena. This leads to more discord between them and they eventually just break up, and in a matter of hours later, Blair loses her virginity to Nate's best friend Chuck in the back of a moving limo. But wait! A few episodes later, Blair and Nate are back together and they actually do have sex. However, when Nate finds out how Blair's First Time actually did happen, he breaks up with her for good. Phew!
    -   This was also done with Jenny in season 3. Jenny's first time was going to be with drug dealer Damien. Then she had The Talk with Serena and watched _Dirty Dancing_. When Damien is about to sleep with Jenny, she asks him how he really feels about her. He is unable to give her a straight answer, so she decides losing her virginity to him wouldn't be right (though for some reason, she feels she has to lie and tell everyone they really did sleep together). What happens in the season finale? Her real first time ends up being with Chuck, whom she means nothing to at all. It is this very action that results in Jenny being Put on a Bus.
-   _Hanna_: Hanna has her first time with Anton, a boy she meets through Sophie. However, this then leads to a rift as Sophie also likes him.
-   _House of the Dragon_: Rhaenyra nearly has sex with Daemon after he takes her to a brothel in King's Landing, but he pulls out and leaves at the last possible second. She eventually loses her virginity later that night to Ser Criston.
-   The _How I Met Your Mother_ episode "First Time in New York" revolves around the gang reminiscing about their first times as Robin tries to convince her little sister not to lose her virginity casually. They range from horrible (when Ted confessed to his high school girlfriend that he was in love with her, she lied that she loved him too and then casually abandoned him immediately after he put out) to sweet (when they were college freshmen, Marshall and Lily lying in bed planning a gloriously romantic first time wound up with them having hurried sex in the heat of the moment) to awkward (Robin's boyfriend barely entered her before rolling over and telling her "Yeah, I'm gay.") to humiliating (Barney lost his virginity at the age of 23 to his mother's 40-year-old friend).
-   _I Am Not Okay With This_: Sydney and Stan at the end of episode two. Stan falls in love with her because of it; Syd, on the other hand, simply regards it as a one-time thing. Despite this, they still end up being close friends. It was doomed, given Syd's realized she's a lesbian, describing having sex with him as "really awkward".
-   _Impulse_: Jenna and Zach lose their virginities together. Jenna's also attempting to be straight through having sex with him.
-   _In From the Cold_: Anya and Faina have sex in "Little Bird" after much obvious sexual tension.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: In "In Throes of Increasing Wonder...", after wooing Louis de Pointe du Lac for a few months under the guise of friendship, Lestat de Lioncourt invites his Love Interest to enter his home and join him for a nightcap, and they engage in passionate lovemaking soon after. During their post-coital bliss, they share a Held Gaze that silently communicates their love for each other.
-   Subversion (even if it might predate the trope's existence as a trope): Lance Kerwin and Melissa Sue Anderson's sleeping bag liaison in _James At 15_.
-   Shows up in _Lie to Me_. Lightman's worried that his daughter Emily is about to have sex with her new boyfriend, when he catches them making out. He obsesses over it for most of the episode, until they finally sit down and have a talk about the issue. Turns out, Emily broke up with the guy without sleeping with him. But she's already lost her virginity months ago to someone else.
-   _Lois & Clark_: The episode _Soul Mates_ (right after the wedding one) revolve around this. Justified as Lois and Clark had to explore time and anterior lives to lift a curse, then properly having their first time.
-   _Lovecraft Country_:
    -   Leti lost her virginity to Atticus while at a party with him.
    -   It turns out that Atticus' first time was with Ji-Ah, a woman he met in South Korea.
-   _Manhattan Love Story_: Dana and Peter lament how something always comes up and interrupts them or ruins their night before they actually do the act. They finally manage to after many hurdles.
-   _Motherland: Fort Salem_: Tally loses her virginity through hooking up with Garit during the Beltane festival. She's ecstatic about it later.
-   _My Left Nut_: Because he thinks he's going to die, Mick tries to rush his relationship with Rachael because he doesn't want to die a virgin. But this ends up getting Averted since by rushing things, he ends up screwing it up alienating Rachael just as they're about to have sex. But by the end, he also ends up _not_ having cancer and patches things up with her and they have a Relationship Upgrade, but now taking the relationship slow since he no longer has to worry about dying.
-   The _New Girl_ episode "Virgins" has the group reminiscing about their first time. All the stories were incredibly awkward and cringe inducing, except for Cece, who lost her virginity to Mick Jagger.
-   Averted in _NewsRadio_ when Jimmy is telling Dave about a chance reunion with an old flame. Jimmy thinks Dave is referring to this trope. Dave clarifies and wishes he hadn't.
    
    **Dave Nelson**: Was it the first time?  
    **Jimmy James**: No, I've had sex before, Dave.  
    **Dave Nelson**: I mean was it the first time with her?  
    **Jimmy James**: Oh. Yes, it was. We started out kinda slow...  
    **Dave Nelson**: Um, could you hold that thought...forever?
    
-   Seth and Summer on _The O.C._. In fact, their first _two_ times were awkward, for very different reasons.
-   _One of Us is Lying_: Nate and Bronwyn have sex finally in Season 2 after confessing their love for each other.
-   _Outlander_: Brianna and Roger, after handfasting (an old Scottish custom in which a couple get temporarily married outside formal proceedings), tenderly have sex in a closed up shop (it's also her first time, period, as she is a virgin before this). Unfortunately, they have a fight afterward, which causes Brianna to leave.
-   _The Outpost_: Janzo, who's established as a virgin earlier, loses his virginity with Wren and they later become a couple.
-   _The Republic of Sarah_: Bella and Tyler arrange to have their first time together, but at first it doesn't work out as a result of the pressure. However, later they have sex-multiple times, in fact.
-   _Roseanne_:
    -   The show subverted this well in the episode where Becky timidly appealed to her mom for help getting birth control pills. It is revealed that not only did she _already_ lose her virginity to biker boyfriend Mark entirely offscreen, but they had been having sex for quite some time and simply wished to stop using condoms.
    -   Darlene's was more typical. After putting off her otherwise nice but pressuring-for-sex boyfriend, the first time she finally proposed Their First Time, he 'failed to perform', and took the whole episode to get over his self-imposed pressure.
-   Will and Emma's first time in _Scream: The TV Series_ happens prior to the show, but is used as a plot point - not only did Will only do it because he'd been dared he couldn't get Emma to put out, but it was also filmed for proof he'd succeeded, and later accidentally e-mailed to everyone in the school.
-   In _Smallville_, Clark finally has his first time with Lana in a Season 5 episode where he lost his powers, only to be chewed out by his parents when they find out. He calls them on it.
-   _Special Ops: Lioness_: Cruz and Aaliyah have sex after they establish a mutual attraction for each other.
-   _That '70s Show_:
    -   The show had several early episodes that centered, partially or fully, on Eric and Donna preparing to sleep together, and then backing out at the last minute. They're finally able to do the deed about midway through the second season (one episode ends with them about to do it, and the next episode begins with them already finished). More realistically than most TV "first times", it didn't go all that well, leading to angst the morning after. This leads Eric to the very logical conclusion that what they need is "Practice, _and lots of it!_"
        
        **Hyde:** If God had intended for virgins to lose it to each other, he wouldn't have invented middle-aged hookers, man!
        
    -   Fez's attempts to lose his virginity are pretty much a Running Gag, and his friends constantly tease him for it. He finally loses it off-screen in the fifth season to his older co-worker Nina. It was... _aaaaaaawkward_.
        
        **Fez:** Well, our faces didn't line up right, so I kept bumping my chin on her nose. And then there were some sounds.  
        **Hyde:** What kind of sounds?  
        **Fez:** Well, I will say this, it was not applause. There was no romantic music like in the movies, so I had to hum. And then Nina told me to stop humming. And, uh, then I started again without realizing it. And then she got mad. And then I think she got sad. (...) And then afterwards, I went into the bathroom, and, uh... And cried a little. And then I snuck out the back door.  
        **Donna:** Poor Fez. Well, you know, at least it couldn't have been any worse.  
        **Fez:** I left my underwear in her bathroom.
        
-   _True Blood_:
    -   In season two, Hoyt and Jessica lose their virginity to each other. Then later, they later found out that vampires who die with their hymen intact will continue to regrow it and so had to find alternative ways to express their love. This is probably a good demonstration of why the realistic, loving relationship between the two characters saved Jessica from the Scrappy heap.
    -   Sookie loses her virginity to Bill in season one. It's a positive experience for her, especially so after she reveals that she was molested as a child by an uncle.
        
        **Sookie:** I never thought I'd be able to...  
        **Bill:** I am honoured that you chose me.
        
-   _What I Like About You_ has a different spin on this for every single character. The most prominent versions were the straight-play with Holly & Vince in "Halloween" (an episode full of angst from both, followed by the "30-seconds-later" thing) and the subversion with Val & Vic throughout season 4 (they probably did it on their drunken wedding night, but Val doesn't remember; either way, they don't go again until after their "formal" wedding in the finale, by which time both are _more_ than ready).
-   _The Wilds_:
    -   Shelby and Toni resolve their sexual tension offscreen by having sex (which is at least Shelby's first).
    -   Her flashback has Nora and her boyfriend Quinn decide to lose their virginities together.
-   _Yellowjackets_:
    -   Jackie convinces Travis to have sex with her as she doesn't want to die a virgin.
    -   Apparently the case for Taissa and Van, who get it on out in the woods, although they might have earlier.
-   _Zero (2021)_: Omar and Anna have sex, which is at least his first (not hers).

    Music 

-   The All-American Rejects' "Dance Inside" is a good example of this.
-   Sparks' "Amateur Hour" is about how the first time will always suck because of inexperience.
-   "De Eerste X" ("The First Time") by Dutch band Doe Maar in which someone is deflowered by a woman, but feels he can't live up to her expectations. Then he leaves her, but feels regret afterwards.
-   The _Zenryoku Shounentachi no Toriai_ song "First Experience" recounts a tale of this from the woman's point of view, and also addresses how awkward it can be while trying to play it up for all the sexiness it can muster.
-   Meat Loaf's "Paradise by the Dashboard Light" from _Bat Out of Hell_ is about a high school couple, "barely seventeen" making out in a car, then having sex when the boy swears he loves the girl and will marry her. He grows to hate her over the years.
-   "Christians in Love" by comedy band Dead Cat Bounce details the first intimate exchange between a newly-wedded Christian couple, playing up both of their inexperience with crass imagery. It turns out that the band themselves are actually watching it happen from outside the couple's hotel room, and are demanding their payment for having performed at the wedding.
    
    _Like a shithouse door in a force-9 gale  
    They're banging hard 'til their hinges fail  
    With no real discernible sense of rhythm  
    Like Keanu Reeves in the movie Speed  
    They're scared that slowing down might lead  
    To some sort of explosive cataclysm  
    Taking Dennis Hopper with them_
    
-   "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)" by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is about a man fondly remembering his first time having sex with a women way back in "December, 1963".
    
    _Oh, what a night  
    Late December back in sixty three  
    What a very special time for me  
    As I remember, what a night  
    Oh, what a night, you know I didn't even know her name  
    But I was never gonna be the same  
    What a lady, what a night_
    
-   "Will You Love Me Tomorrow?" by The Shirelles deals with a woman's concern about whether her boyfriend will still love her the day after giving up her virginity to him.
    
    _Tonight you're mine completely  
    You give your love so sweetly...  
    ...Is this a lasting treasure  
    Or just a moment's pleasure?  
    Can I believe the magic of your sighs?  
    Will you still love me tomorrow?_
    
-   "Night Moves" by Bob Seger is about a guys "first time" in the back of his car with his girlfriend.
    
    _Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy  
    Workin' on mysteries without any clues_
    
-   Mystery Dance” by Elvis Costello is also deals with a mans very awkward first time using the euphemism "Mystery Dance" to refer to first time sex.
    
    _Well, I remember when the lights went out  
    And I was tryin' to make it look like it was never in doubt  
    She thought that I knew, and I thought that she knew  
    So both of us were willing, but we didn't know how to do it_
    

    Theatre 

-   Tacked on as almost an afterthought for a quick joke in _Heathers_. After singing one of the best songs in the show about having sex with J.D., Veronica caps off the next scene with this.
    
    **Veronica:** Oh, and, uh... by the way... _(awkwardly pats J.D.'s shoulder, clicks her tongue)_ ...You were my first. _(walks away, leaving a bewildered-but-flattered J.D.)_
    
-   The second act of _Jasper in Deadland_ opens with a flashback of Jasper and Agnes talking about their feelings for each other before having sex for the first time.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Being A DIK_ has this show up quite significantly for the MC and all Main Girls, along with some others.
    -   As discussed with Isabella in the flashback in "100%", the MC lost his virginity to his best friend Zoey in high school while fooling around with her; though they remained Friends with Benefits for a long time, both of them seem to have realized their deeper feelings for each other by the time she left for San Diego. Things do not get any simpler when she comes back, having realised her feelings for him...at the end of Episode 8, by which point the MC may have committed to a Main Girl relationship.
    -   Josy's first time with the MC happens in "Maggot Brothers" if he stays at her place, and is interrupted by Pete and Monica returning home, leading to him having to escape through the window.
    -   Maya's first time with the MC in "The Initiation" is interrupted when it turns out to be a prank by Quinn, with the former grinding on him (and starting to get into it) before he is tased by the latter. Their actual first time in "100%" is also somewhat sensitive, given that it is Maya's first time with a man.
    -   While Isabella does sometimes engage in sexual activity with the MC throughout Seasons 1 and 2, they do not go all the way till he commits to her in Episode 8, which is also the first time she is having sex with anyone since James. Notably, it is played as being extremely cathartic for Bella as a sign of her starting to move on from James.
    -   Especially notable for Jill, who starts the game as a _virgin_ and whose tendency to believe that her life is like a romance novel means she attaches a great deal of importance to her first time; the arc words for her path, aimed at the MC, are "Are you my destiny?". Unsurprisingly, she does not engage in sexual activity unless the MC commits to her in Episode 8 by confessing his feelings for her at her third date with Tybalt (and kissing her in front of him), after which she loses her virginity to him in his room and affirms that they are now together.
-   Shown with all the girls in _Daughter for Dessert_ in a similar way, in which the protagonist seduces each one with a different masculine quality.
-   Has a different character with each girl in _Double Homework_:
    -   One of the rules of the protagonist’s, Johanna’s, and Tamara’s ménage a trois is that when two of them do anything sexual together, they need to tell the third person. The two girls also let the protagonist choose which one he wants to bed first. He chooses one of the two after Dennis starts blackmailing Dr. Mosely, fearing that he may not get another chance. He does, and sleeps with the other one soon afterward.
    -   Lauren passes the protagonist a note in class telling him a plan to get out of class, and then asks him if he would consider them to be "dating." She seduces him if he says he does.
    -   When the moment hits between the protagonist and Morgan, Morgan says that they should get straight to the point, since "we're both fairly experienced."
    -   Amy seeks out sex with the protagonist on the yacht, and allows him to do whatever he wants when he finds her in the hot tub.
-   _Fate Series_:
    -   Happens in each route of the original _Fate/stay night_, but it's most prominent in the _Unlimited Blades Works_ route, where Shirou's and Rin's first time is Played for Laughs due to the awkwardness of the whole situation... and it works, because Rin is tsundere _even in bed_. She actually refuses to take off her shirt at first, and Shirou eventually has to make her compromise with stockings. Not helped by the fact that Shirou's... size makes Rin _even more nervous_. In fact, this is a rare case of, after the act, the girl bitching the guy out because she didn't like it. So much for the afterglow...
    -   Shirou and Rin do have a _much_ better time having sex together in _Fate/hollow ataraxia_, where they don't have the pressure of a Mate or Die scenario looming over their heads and they've become comfortable enough with each other for Rin to let out more of her "dere" side.
-   Happens in each route of _Katawa Shoujo_:
    -   The most glaring example comes in Hanako's route, where not only are neither she nor Hisao emotionally prepared, but despite Hisao's tries, Hanako is _very_ much in pain. (Not helped by how the body tissue from her scars _severely_ limits her flexibility).
    -   Goes more smoothly in Lilly's route, where Hisao notices some drops of blood when he penetrates Lilly and gets nervous — but she tells him it's okay, and their sex scene is relatively pleasant aside of this.
-   This is the basic premise of _Kindred Spirits on the Roof_: Sachi and Megumi are ghosts and are very much in love with each other. They wish to take it to the next step before passing on to the afterlife but they don't know _how_. So they rope Yuna, the only person who can interact with them, into a plan: Find possible girl-girl couples in the school, help them get together and hope that the ghosts will learn from their experiences.
-   In _Melody_, this takes on a different flavor with each of the various girls that the protagonist can be involved with:
    -   Melody: The two of them get off to several false starts due to Melody's virginity being on her mind, or just being in public when the "right moment" comes. However, it eventually hits when they're in the bedroom together.
    -   Isabella (her path only): Isabella starts coming on to the protagonist as soon as they see each other, but they can’t do anything yet due to Tim being there. At night, after Tim is drunk and (supposedly) asleep, they pick up where they left off.
    -   Becca (her path only): Becca holds off with the protagonist, not wanting to appear easy. She reaches the point where she wants it, but stops the protagonist because he doesn’t have a condom on hand. Soon after, he gets a condom, and they go all the way.
    -   Amy (her path only): Amy tries to seduce the protagonist in her hotel room, but he resists for Melody’s sake. However, when she invites him in for the second time less than a week later, they fool around, but Amy passes out from alcohol before they consummate their relationship. Soon after, however, they have sex.
    -   Sophia (her path only): The protagonist and Sophia know pretty early that they’ll be having sex, and they do on their first meeting alone after Sophia offers him a “discreet” relationship.
-   Happens in both the main story and after story routes in _Princess Evangile_, when Masaya and his respective love interest of that route decide to consummate their relationship, depending on the situation and circumstances. Notably, in the main story routes, these usually happen before the Big Bad enacts an Evil Plan on either Masaya or his Love Interest, while in the after story routes, it's simply there for a combination of fanservice and the fact that Masaya and his Love Interest are finally comfortable with one another.
-   The good ending of _Sable's Grimoire: Man and Elf_ has Sable and Lisha consummate their new relationship.
-   In _Sunrider_, flashbacks show that Kayto Shields and Ava Crescentia had their first time back in high school, days before Ava’s graduation. It was very much a spur-of-the-moment thing, as Ava was leaving for the military right after graduation and the two of them had just admitted their feelings for one another earlier that evening.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Doc Rat_, Ben and Daniella's first time together is something the lead-up to was particularly dramatic. Both were already experienced,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  but Ben's insistence on waiting for the right time gave Daniella the false impression that their relationship was souring. Once they got engaged, they finally had sex after a dinner date at Ben's house. The premonition is a Sexy Silhouette of Danni leaning forward on the dinner table, looking like she's about to jump Ben over it.
    
    **Ben:** Did you bring dessert?  
    **Daniella:** Did I ever.
    
-   Due to taking place during college, a number of characters and couples have sex with each other for the first time in _Dumbing of Age_ and shown in the Slipshine comics.
-   Seen in flashback in _Everyday Heroes_: Marko (Mr. Mighty), reveals to Jane the Heroes' most-guarded secret - the existence of the power-suppressing drug Nylvarrine - and even gives her a sample as a sign of trust. He's then moved to go all in and propose to her. Jane (who had some serious trust issues from her time as a villain) reacts by popping the Nylvarrine pill into Marko's mouth and taking her top off.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    **Jane**: That was "yes", by the way.
    
-   _Evon_: Evon and Hero finally consummate their relationship between comics 1011 and 1015, after some prodding of Evon by her clone/sister Evee, who plays matchmaker despite loving Hero almost as much as Evon.
-   _Kevin & Kell_'s premonition for the first time for Rudy and Fiona, after a quarter century of Comic-Book Time (roughly a decade real-time) of dating? Fiona telling Rudy that dishes from a special dinner can wait until morning. That next morning, Rudy wakes up in bed with her. But they agree that marriage can still wait a bit longer.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_ opens with the protagonist Allison preparing to lose her virginity with her boyfriend Zaid, having scheduled the date and time with him beforehand. Allison is reluctant, Zaid is being pushy, and everything goes to (a) hell before they can actually do it. Allison’s _actual_ first time is never shown, as the next time her sex life comes up is after a Time Skip, during which she started dating Cute Monster Girl Cio and picked up plenty of experience (especially regarding no longer being so awkward she needs to _schedule_ when she’ll have sex).
-   Comics in the _Ménage à 3_ universe play first times all sorts of ways, sometimes averting the trope and sometimes not — mostly, it seems, because they're Sex Comedies and will do whatever gets a laugh.
    -   In the original comic, the sex between Gary and Kiley is the first time for him, though not for her, and is realistic enough to avert the trope, in that he suffers Premature Ejaculation. (Then things get less realistic.)
    -   In _Pixie Trix Comix_, the first-time sex between Julian and the virgin (and previously not-consciously-bisexual) Aaron fits the classic trope pattern, being spontaneous to the point of rashness and yet apparently very satisfying for both parties.
    -   _Sandra on the Rocks_ is all over the place on this subject; the attempt at first-time sex between Marie and Ingrid is abortive, mostly because Marie realizes that she's entirely straight, while Alex's first time is just plain confused, thank to the dubious machinations of Eloise and Nadine.
    -   _Sticky Dilly Buns_, however, ruthlessly averts the conventional TV view of unprepared sex being good sex, twice. (It may be relevant that the couples involved aren't naive teens.)
        -   The first time between Jung and Ramona takes place off-screen, but it's very clear that Jung's scrupulous preparation makes the sex about as good as it can get for Ramona (and probably for him too).
        -   When Ruby thinks that Andy is proposing sex, she is initially nervous, but talking to friends calms her nerves. The fact that actually getting to the sex itself turns out to be more complicated than expected is just one of those things, but when it happens, Ruby turns out to be mentally and physically ready, and enjoys it.
-   This plays out in _Sunstone_ when Ally and Lisa finally meet, but subverted as they've both had sex before; it's their first time trying out BDSM with each other and naturally they are quite nervous about it.
-   _Tripping Over You_: Milo and Liam consummate their relationship in Chapter 5, with only a short break to consult the Internet for advice when they realize neither of them has sexual experience with another man. They're pleased enough with the results.

-   Literotica has an entire section titled "First Time," which is about exactly this.
    -   Playing with the trope, however, stories in this section don't necessarily have to be about the characters losing their virginities - more that it needs to be the first time for that particular couple.
-   One of the first internet hoaxes was supposed to be a live deflowering at a site called _Our First Time_. It followed two "teen virgins," Mike and Diane, as they chose condoms, informed their parents, and got tested for HIV, with their actual first time broadcast live in August 1998. However, when people started to notice that the two didn't look like teenagers, the entire plan was revealed as a hoax, and the guy behind the whole thing said that he intended Mike and Diane to abstain at the last minute (after charging a $5 viewing fee, intending to use the money to fund a Vanity Project named "Heart of the Beholder" in which the two actors would get the starring roles.) Strangely, it seemed like nobody at the time noticed that "Diane" had been a cast member on _Road Rules_ the previous year under her real name, Michelle. Details.

-   _Big Mouth_: When Val and Leah sleep together for the first time in "Sugarbush", he's quick and clumsy. When they're done, Val collapses next to her and claims it was amazing while a clearly unsatisfied Leah hesitantly lies to assuage his ego. Bonnie sums it up with "It was pokey and fast and chaos. He promised you a happy cry, but left you feeling crappy and dry." They do it better the second time, when Leah becomes more comfortable telling him about what she likes.
-   Parodied in _Bob's Burgers_ except it's about eating lobster.
    
    "When you get married, just _pretend_ you've never eaten lobster before."
    
-   After Tom falls asleep at Daria's house (during a perfectly innocent study session) and gets caught sneaking out the door at four in the morning, a rumour begins going around that the two had sex. Daria begins to wonder if maybe it says something about their relationship that they're not sleeping together and tells Tom she wants to start. She changes her mind after they've agreed and, worried that Tom will think she doesn't really like him much after all, writes him a breakup note. He forgives her and life goes on.
-   In the _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_ episode "Peanut Puberty", which plays the Puberty Superpower trope for parody, Peanut at one point asks Black Vulcan about his first time...fighting a supervillain. Apparently both he and the villain were nervous about it, exchanged small talk first, and then had a cigarette afterward. Peanut would later come into Harvey's office and introduce his 'villain friend', implying that he had his first time.
-   An episode of _Pepper Ann_ mirrors this plot, except that the first time in question is a First Kiss.
