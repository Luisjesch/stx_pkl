TV Tropes does not endorse using this line in a job interview.

_"Facing death every day is a tough job for any man. But his hours are flexible, and he's got a great dental plan."_

Characters in fiction sometimes have a specific job not because they like the job or something, but the job just has some very specific benefit that they want. Health plans, especially dental, are popular.

For our non-US readers: the United States does not have a government-sponsored health insurance system except for veterans, elderly (Medicare), and extremely poor (Medicaid)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  - for most Americans, most or all of their coverage is from private companies or organizations. For healthy working-age adults, health insurance is a common benefit at a workplace (due to wage restrictions during World War II encouraging benefits in place of offering higher wages) and can vary greatly in quality between jobs. Dental insurance plans are usually separate items from regular health insurance, which is why "dental" is commonly said instead of "health".

This trope can also encompass other things too, but normally, it's just small things that they want.

Makes it even more hilarious if the character who wants that specific benefit has no way to use it. (Such as a life insurance plan for an immortal being.) See also Healthcare Motivation, Working for a Body Upgrade and I Control My Minions Through.... May be also a perk of a Weird Trade Union. Compare Only in It for the Money for cases where a fictional character took a job because it pays well, as well as Money, Dear Boy where a real-world actor or work creator took a role primarily for the payday.

    Film — Animated 

-   Averted here in _Shrek 2_, where Shrek gets into the Fairy Godmother's factory by claiming to be from the Union of Magical Workers both Evil and Benign and asks the receptionist if he feels degraded or oppressed (when we just heard the Fairy Godmother yell at him to get coffee and pastries). The receptionist turns the speaker tube the other way before admitting they don't even get dental.

    **Vince Ricardo:** Why not?  
    **Cab Driver:** I don't know. I mean, you know, I thought, like, James Bond.  
    **Vince:** No, no. They all look like me. I'm the classic agency type; muscular, low to the ground, compact. Are you interested in joining? I'll tell you, the benefits are fantastic. The trick is not to get killed, that's really the key to the benefit program.
    
-   _Men in Black II_: Zed explains to Frank that he'll get better dental as Zed's assistant than as a field agent. Since Frank is canid (at least in appearance while on Earth), this works for him.

-   In the shower scene of _Starship Troopers_ various characters explain why they joined the space marines; including one woman who joined up to be able to get a license to have a child. At least one of the characters joins for the more mundane reason of the government paying for him to go to Harvard afterwards. All this of course in addition to the core benefit of joining: Service Guarantees Citizenship! In the book the slogan is explained more thoroughly; military service isn't the only path to full citizenship, just the easiest and most certain.

-   _Angel_.
    -   Wesley is told there isn't any when he joins Angel Investigations. He says he'll floss.

-   In _Get Smart_ Agents from CONTROL and KAOS would occasionally put their gunfights on hold in order to compare benefits packages. Sadly, the KAOS agents often seemed to have the better deal.
-   In the _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ episode "Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack", Mac and Charlie seek employment at a corporate office. They're content to share a single paycheck (minimum wage) because they're only there for health insurance.

-   In the _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ presentation of _Time Chasers_, Crow attempts to improve Mike's life by going back in time and preventing him from taking the temp job that eventually lands him on the Satellite. As he tries to persuade the younger Mike, Crow is briefly tempted to try temping himself when Mike explains the benefits of temping, including Blue Cross.
-   _Monk_: Sort of a plot point in "Mr. Monk Goes to the Dentist," where Dr. Oliver Bloom is on most SFPD cops' dental plans, which is the whole reason why an ex-cop who broke a tooth during a deadly armored car robbery came to him to get it fixed.
-   In _The New Adventures of Beans Baxter_ one of the henchmen says he joined the evil organization for their dental plan.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Shadowrun_, joining the military is one of the few legal ways to get a valid (national) SIN. As the SINless are usually treated as "probationary citizens" without any actual rights or legal protections, this possibility can be very tempting, although having a valid SIN also means the government that issued it knows intimate facts about the holder.

    Video Games 

-   _Arknights_: A lot of playable characters are people signed up for operator duty to fund their Oripathy treatment at Rhodes Island. Reasons include losing their job due to the rampant discrimination of Infected, poverty or otherwise inability to pay for their health care the normal way.
-   Exaggerated in _Control_:
    -   After Jesse defeats FORMER, the Board explains that it’s trying to set itself up as a competitor to them but advises her not to sign up with it, as the Board offers a better bonus package and health plan. Both the Board and FORMER are Eldritch Abominations from beyond the plane of reality; health plans aren't what you should be concerned with when dealing with them. But given what it says after, this is more of a Deadly Euphemism, where Health Plan is "Living":
        
        < We provide/offer better Bonus Package/Health Plan >  
        < If you leave, you will be sorry/dead and you will never work/exist in this Torn/Cosmic Reality again\>
        
    -   A much more mundane instance of this trope is mentioned with Frederick Langston, the supervisor/warden of the Federal Bureau of Control's containment sector for supernatural artifacts. He's qualified enough for his job and admits he's fond of the crazy artifacts he has to overlook, but he also admits that were it not for the Bureau's health benefits, he'd probably be working at the postal service.
-   In _The Darkside Detective_, McQueen asks a monster what brings him to Twin Lakes, and he claims it's because the city has great dental — even though, as McQueen immediately points out, he doesn't have any teeth.
-   In the second _Descent_ game<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the Material Defender is bound and determined to complete the mission(s) and not die because not only does he want his money - he _will_ get that dental plan...
-   In one of the _Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories_ bonus missions, Prism Indigo mentions that he's part of the Prism Rangers only because of the salary and insurance benefits.
-   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, Ser Jory sought to join The Order of the Grey Wardens to seek personal glory, although he did agree with their goals as well. This went poorly for him when he learned about the group’s dangerous Initiation Ceremony and tried to back out in a panic, only to be killed to keep the secrets.
-   _Dragon Ball Fighterz:_ Captain Ginyu reveals the various benefits Freeza offers them in return for their Undying Loyalty. They include some of the best healthcare the whole galaxy has to offer and entire planets to rule as a bonus for good performance.
-   Thanatos, god of Death from _Kid Icarus: Uprising_, mentions the unbeatable health insurance that comes with working in Underworld's forces.
-   In _Marvel: Avengers Alliance_, Constrictor switches to the heroes' side after he won a lawsuit against Hercules. When he teams up with you in Spec Ops 10, though, we have this:
    
    **Constrictor:** Sorry, sweetheart, I got out of the mercenary biz. I'm full-time now.  
    **Madame Masque:** With S.H.I.E.L.D.? How disappointing. What did they offer you?  
    **Constrictor:** Decent vacation time. Good dental plan. Redemption. Couldn't say no.
    
-   The fourth _Metal Slug_ game introduced a new character, Nadia Cassel, a budding model-turned-soldier who joined the army in order to lose weight.
-   Parodied in _Rage 2_, where a data log mentions that the Goons, a bandit gang of Ax-Crazy Boisterous Bruisers, have free dental. Meaning they'll knock your teeth out and let you replace them with whatever you want for free.
-   In the opening scene for a Templar character in _The Secret World_, the woman sent to recruit you mentions an excellent health plan among the many benefits of joining the Ancient Conspiracy.
-   In the _Star Wars: The Old Republic Knights of the Fallen Empire_ expansion, a bonus chapter has you infiltrate the Shroud's base, and meet a blind janitor (using an MSE droid as a service animal). The blindness was a necessity for employment, which he knew, but he nevertheless went through the agonizing 20-interview process to get hired because the benefits package is _amazing_.
-   Alluded to in a waiting-for-the-elevator-to-arrive moment in _TimeSplitters Future Perfect_, as Sergeant Cortez tries to make small talk with Agent Chen, his current ally.
    
    **Cortez**: So… Been in the agency long?  
    **Chen**: Uh… Yeah… Three years in May.  
    (Beat)  
    **Cortez**: You get dental?  
    **Chen**: Yeah… Yeah…  
    **Cortez**: That's good…
    
-   _WarCraft III_:
    -   The Acolyte "builder" unit of the undead has, like all the other units in the game, many funny quotes if you click on him repeatedly without actually giving him an instruction. One of his quotes is "Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny ... and you get dental."
    -   Subverted by Tichondrius, who complains that the Legion's dental plan isn't good enough and his fangs are killing him.
-   Early in _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_, a trio of soldiers from the Empire of Mor Ardain are attempting to recruit Drivers at a recruiting stand in Torigoth's town square. In addition to the usual talk you'd expect to hear from a military recruiter, the lead soldier makes a point to emphasize that the position also comes with a pension and benefits, and unlike most other examples, this isn't Played for Laughs. Jac, the Gormotti man who successfully bonds with a Blade, can be encountered by the party later in Mor Ardain where they learn that he has completed his training and is now on active duty with the army, and he is sending the extra bonus pay he gets for being a Driver back home to Gormott to provide for his younger siblings.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original

-   _A Crap Guide to D&D_'s video on the Warlock class:

-   In _Gargoyles_, Matt Bluestone finally tracks down one of The Illuminati and upon confronting him, notes that he looks unusually young for a man in his 90s, and comments on the generosity of the Illuminati to provide special life extending drugs for their senior members.

-   In a variant, Shipwreck on _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero_ once exclaimed in surprise that Cobra mooks have a dental plan, when he and some other Joes were ransacking some files in a Cobra facility.
-   _Jackie Chan Adventures_: Tohru's reason for his Heel–Face Turn: "Tuesday is donut day at Section 13."

It's also a Call-Back, as, a couple episodes prior, Jackie offered this as a reason to defect while fighting him.
-   _Kim Possible_: According to the producers this was the reason Shego kept coming back to be Drakken's sidekick. Fans who suspected other reasons were eventually proven right.

Jim reminds him he only signed up for the dental.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: When Heinz Doofenshmirtz was declared a minor threat in relation to The Regurgitator, he decided to meet the new villain, who assumed Doof was applying to work for him and showed him application forms.

    Real Life 

-   All too Truth in Television in nations like the USA that don't provide government health insurance.
    -   A TV report once mentioned that only three major industrialized countries do not have some form of public health insurance: The US, Mexico and Turkey.
    -   In the USA, in addition to taking a job for the health insurance, people have gotten married for it. Joining the military to get health care for yourself and/or your family is also done.
        -   In the American military, junior enlisted members who are single live in the barracks, and are expected to eat most of their meals in the chow halls. _Married_ junior enlisted members are given additional pay allowances to get an apartment and buy food to put on the table<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Inversely, a civilian might marry a military member for benefits to include a steady source of income, medical coverage, additional money for college, and of course, getting the heck out of their dump of a home town.
        -   Additional benefits include a college education. Aside from money provided specifically to pay for college classes, military members can get college credit for their job training as well. In addition, most military officers in the US enter via various programs that pay for their college costs in return for a service commitment (typically either one of the Military Academies or a regular college while enrolled in the Reserve Officers Training Corps).
        -   Other perks for active service members and retirees include being able to purchase household items and groceries at a discount and tax-free in base exchanges and commissaries, usage of on base entertainment facilities, and offer discounted leisure opportunities for them and their families. Members also receive unofficial perks from businesses off base offering military discounts.
    -   It isn't just limited to the US or the Third World either. While the other major industrialized countries usually DO have government health care, little things like scarcity and system blockages tend to mean that many get jobs that can at least more readily access said government health care.
-   Strangely, this is the case with the Surete (civil police) and Gendarmerie (military police) in France. Both are actually standard law enforcement organisations that handle just about everything police-related from traffic tickets to Homicide (though the Surete tends to have a heavier presence in cities and Gendarmerie in the country)... not just on military bases. It's just that if you sign up with the gendarmes, you'll get the same pay as Surete cops, but they'll throw in three squares a day, uniform allowance, and free accommodation at the barracks. Not so for the Surete (but then, you'll stay under civilian discipline).
-   The Canadian military also has a good benefits package for things not covered under public health care, such as a complete set of replacement teeth, and on one occasion, a sex reassignment surgery.
    -   Hilariously, it can be a fight to get _out_ of some health benefits packages for Canadian military members. Paying for provincial health care is mandatory in some provinces, and convincing them you no longer need it because you're on the military's health plan can be difficult.
    -   British service personnel stationed in higher-cost countries like Germany were given an extra pay allowance to compensate for the higher cost of living in the host nation.
    -   Provincial health insurance generally only covers expenses related to visiting a hospital or family doctor. Other medical expenses like dental, prescription drugs <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and glasses aren't covered, so many employers offer supplemental insurance coverage for these things as part of their benefits.
-   Many people joining foreign armed forces do this in order to get their host countries' citizenship.
-   This is part of the deal the Gurkhas of Nepal have with the Brits. Being a British soldier pays very well by Nepalese standards, but the medical services are a major incentive, primarily the dental care and the vaccinations we in the western world take for granted.
-   Many marry someone from another country in order to get citizenship and be able to live there. This is very common in the US. Whilst technically illegal, it is usually unpunished provided the couple live together throughout the time required for citizenship.
-   In many totalitarian countries (Nazi Germany and Saddam's Iraq spring to mind) a lot of the people joined the ruling party less out of ideological fervor and more out of the fringe benefits they provided - the Wall Street Journal once interviewed a policeman who joined the Ba'ath Party to get its relatively decent health-care program.
    -   In the Soviet Union, entering a university without joining the Komsomol was next to impossible. High-ranking jobs (and their benefits) also required party membership.
    -   This has been taken to absurd levels in some cases. E.g. in modern day China the party decides whether you can join them as a lot of Chinese just join in order to get ahead economically.
