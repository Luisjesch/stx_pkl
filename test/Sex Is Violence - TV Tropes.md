_"I start hitting him and I think 'Jeez! He's breathing funny! Does he have asthma?'"_

Sometimes, when a combat scene becomes a bit _too_ vocal and noisy... it stops being fighting. But sometimes, for some characters, the fighting itself actually does become a sexual turn-on. The character's heavy breathing, grunts, and groans are caused by the fact that they are really, truly — and literally — getting off on the violence (though not necessarily on actual injury to themselves and / or their opponents).

Truth in Television to an extent: Agonophilia is the proper term for the real-life fetish, and at least some animals, such as cats, can opt to mate to relieve violent impulses.

Related to Cat Fight (and the possible cause of the ensuing Fanservice, In Love with Your Carnage, and Foe Romance Subtext). Often involves characters who are Too Kinky to Torture. Can end in Destructo-Nookie. May also overlap with Pain Mistaken for Sex. Compare Crazy in the Head, Crazy in the Bed and I Didn't Mean to Turn You On. A subtrope of the similarly-named Interplay of Sex and Violence. Compare and contrast with Lacerating Love Language, which is not inherently sexual and instead focuses on the use of violence to express affection.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Akeno Himejima from _High School D×D_ enjoys fighting so much that the expressions she does while battling go well beyond Not Safe for Work.
-   Karasuba from _Sekirei_ likes combat so much she has to kill someone to lose steam and even declares she's "On fire" to her Ashikabi. Yomi is another example, getting turned on during her battle with Musubi. She's quick to deny it when called on being a pervert.
-   Hidan from _Naruto_ is implied to have an orgasm every time he finishes his opponent off during his sadomasochistic stabbing ritual.
-   Genkaku from _Deadman Wonderland_ is shown getting _really_ turned on when he watches Nagi crush some poor sap's skull.
-   In _Black Cat_, let's just say that Creed... _really_ likes being hurt and beat up by Train (especially while they're fighting). One round of fisticuffs between them quickly turns creepy when Train ends up in a compromising position on top of Creed, who breathlessly cries out that Train is "the best". Pretty sure he got off from that.
-   In _Full Metal Panic!_, Gauron's idea of consummating his love for Sousuke is apparently to have a bloody double suicide — namely, in the form of their Humongous Mechas beating each other up and grappling each other and having his self-destruct. Not to mention that in the novels, it's made pretty clear that, during Gauron's fight with Sousuke in Khanka, Gauron was getting off on the idea of violently killing Sousuke and then raping his dead body. In case the anime didn't make it blatant enough, the manga has him yelling out while he's fighting Sousuke, "Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! Ah, what a rush!" He is also shown to get sexual arousal from violently cutting up and killing people as well as choking them.
-   Tatsumi Saiga from _Speed Grapher_ worked as a war photographer. In one flashback he gets a hard-on when he's taking pictures of dying men during a battle. One soldier even notices and calls him a pervert.
-   Ira Gamagoori from _Kill la Kill_ is a blatant masochist, and his uniform grows stronger the more pain is inflicted on him.
-   Basically any time that Tsukuyomi (pictured) ends up dueling Setsuna in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_. One featured Tsukuyomi panting, blushing and drooling...while talking about how she was losing control and asking Setsuna to fight harder and 'satisfy' her. Not many were surprised when the battle climaxed with her straddling Setsuna and slowly slicing her clothing off while basically openly declaring intent to rape. Chapter 293 has her getting all hot and bothered during a fight with Negi; the poor lad was rather unnerved by it.
-   A central theme of the _Witchblade_ anime series. As stated outright by the show's creators, the point isn't "sex and violence" so much as "sex _is_ violence."
-   In episode 185 of _Sgt. Frog_ while Dororo was in a giant robot fight with Robobo, of the Shurara Corps. For the final blow, he cuts Robobo in half. Right before blowing up, he looks incredibly happy, and says "It feels GOOD!". And the icing on the cake is when Dororo bows his head and states that he's happy to have found a strong opponent.
-   Bryan Hawk from _Hajime no Ippo_ seemingly gets sexual pleasure when he fights. After severely beating down Takamura, he remarks that he's about to cum.
-   In _Battle Angel Alita_, Alita begins to take pleasure in combat and killing when she's employed by Tiphares. In her own words, she wants "More and more, until everything goes all white!"
-   Fasalina from _GUN×SWORD_ whenever attacking inside her Dahlia of Wednesday, usually inserts some orgasmic sounds alongside some drawn-out words. All while pole-dancing. Well, she is a former prostitute...
-   Takuma Fudou from _Get Backers_. His greatest desire is for Ban to "give his body to him," "meet his desires," "quench his thirst" and "let him enjoy himself" - which pretty much means getting ripped apart by Fudou as they fight. But Fudou shows numerous times that he doesn't get pleasure simply from sadistically cutting up Ban - he actually likes it more when Ban cuts him up and puts up a fight as well. He also shows his masochistic tendencies when he mentions that he kept his own rotting arm with him, reminding himself of what Ban did to him, which gave him "incredible chills rising up throughout his body." As well as an instance where, when Ban wasn't putting up enough of a fight, Fudou started cutting himself on the chest, screaming at Ban to "make him bleed" and "push him to the edge."
-   Jan Valentine of _Hellsing_ declares that he has a hard-on while killing Hellsing personnel. It's hard not to laugh.
-   Hisoka from _Hunter × Hunter_ is an Axe-Crazy Blood Knight and Combat Sadomasochist adrenaline-junkie who gets very... uh... _excited_ when fighting powerful people, his interest in and Orgasmic Combat with Gon makes him look like a pedophile and his letdown after he learns his boss can't fight him resembles a _very_ eager guy being friend-zoned by his girlfriend at the last moment.
-   Not combat, but Teru "Sakujo" Mikami from _Death Note_ probably qualifies. He loves passing "God's judgment" on the people he kills. During the warehouse scene, he had what would be hard to describe as anything but an orgasm after he wrote the SPK members' names in the Death Note.
-   The monstrous rapist Captain Continental of _Legend of the Blue Wolves_ gets _aroused_ at the thought of both raping and breaking people. It's also heavily implied that he got turned on while fighting Jonathan.
-   Arthur of _Air Gear_ is Too Kinky to Torture and _really_ enjoyed it if Agito managed to hit him during their fight. This is to the point where he nibbled on Agito's ear, dry-humped him, and started breathing really heavily as he was stabbing Agito, almost like he was getting off from the whole thing.
-   Belphegor of _Reborn! (2004)_ made some rather...orgasmic noises during his fight with Gokudera. And towards the end of their fight when both were trying to steal the others ring half's, Belphegor straddles Gokudera and all the struggling they're doing makes it look like they're having sex or that Bel is raping Gokudera.
-   _Highschool of the Dead_: Saeko is psycho and literally gets off on violence, regardless whether she's the one doing it, or receiving it. Best seen near the end of episode 9, when Takashi squeezes her breast to the point of almost crushing it, to keep her from allowing herself to be killed. Saeko blushes and her back arches as she moans as if having an orgasm. Once she regains her composure, she proceeds to cut through the attacking horde of zombies. In her internal monologue, you can hear the arousal in her tone as she builds towards an even bigger one<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   While _Durarara!!_'s Vorona is normally a straight-up Blood Knight, her encounter with Shizuo Heiwajima is, uh, _special_. The rise she gets from facing him is described as both like the feeling one gets when one has a continental missile pointed at their face and straight-up sexual arousal.
-   _The End of Evangelion_ has a rather unsettling variation on this trope involving the MP Evas. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  This is foreshadowed at the beginning with Fuyutsuki's comment that SEELE's attempt to hack the MAGI was "merely foreplay," before it becomes more Squick-inducingly obvious throughout the movie. The aforementioned Lance of Longinus has its repeated phallic symbolism. The subtext it adds to Asuka's death scene where she's **speared in the face** with it is particularly creepy, especially when you consider that most of the movie focuses on Shinji's desire for her.
-   The first segment of _The Animatrix_, _Final Flight of the Osiris_, begins with a blatantly sexual (and really cool) fight scene between a man and a woman. Turns out it's all in good fun.
-   There's lots of this in _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_. Pretty much everything that comes out of Ryuuko's mouth has to do with this trope. Kuroda takes a break from blowing up stuff (and students) to try to rape the meganekko with his gun. Fortunately, Inugami interrupts him. And now Haguro decides to up his freakiness by beating up Chiba and then kissing him, taking that opportunity to tear out his tongue, and then rape him. All because Inugami (whom Haguro is obsessed with) happened to run into him in the street earlier. Also, Haguro topped himself after Aoshika got released from her chains, with him fighting Inugami he got to slice two of Inugami's fingers off, then Haguro eats them and gets a boner for managing to injure Inugami.
-   _Kagerou Project_: The series' main antagonist, the Wide-Eyed Snake, seems to be in a perpetual state of arousal during any scene involving violence and/or suffering - particularly when they're possessing Konoha, and their... 'enjoyment' becomes a lot more overt.
-   Xiaomei from _EDENS ZERO_ is a variation who gets aroused by watching _other people_ fight, because—as someone nigh-omnipotent—the outcome of a battle is the one thing she can never know beforehand. Her slobbery expression as she trembles and rambles about the pleasures of "the collision of muscle on muscle" and "blood and sweat flying everywhere" says it all.
-   This is the explicit fetish of Darkness from _KonoSuba_, and is one of the reasons she chose a tank class when she decided to become an adventurer. While she does turn out to have a genuine heroic streak and is legitimately invested in the Crusader ideals of being a warrior of the divine who protects the weak and helpless, the primary reason she gets involved in any fight less serious than "an entire town will be destroyed if we fail" is to get herself off from the beating she'll receive during the fight (to the point where she _never bothered to become proficient with a Crusader's primary weapon_, and literally can't hit anything with her sword, because she's invested all of her points into being able to survive any kind of damage instead). It doesn't seem to matter what's doing the beating, either - she's gotten off to being flicked repeatedly by a massive golem, to being stampeded by a bunch of animals in rut, all the way up to being _pummeled by a horde of flying cabbages_. She also repeatedly suggests _herself_ as the epicenter of powerful explosion magic cast by her own teammates (because she'll both survive it and thoroughly enjoy the experience, while whatever they're fighting will almost certainly be completely incinerated). Oddly enough she turns out to be _terrifyingly effective_ in _bare-handed_ fighting, to the point where she only loses after being successfully convinced that she'd enjoy what would happen if she lost more than what would happen if she won (and proceeds to deliberately throw the fight).

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_: The Joker looks like he's seriously getting some whenever Batman starts to beat him up, and in most of those fights, it sure looks like Bats is thoroughly enjoying himself... 70 years of rotating authors means Joker veers back and forth between this and In Love with Your Carnage based on whether he's currently trying to cause general destruction or to harass Batman in particular in the comic in question.
-   _The Invisibles_ has an issue starting with a woman getting shot and coming as she dies.
-   Seen in _Watchmen_, in the fight scene between ex-superheroes Laurie and Dan and the unfortunate criminals who tried to mug them. After trouncing their assailants, Laurie and Dan are shown panting in a rather suggestive way, and it's stated explicitly that one reason why they and others became costumed adventurers is because of the arousing feeling of dressing in spandex and beating people up. In the comic, they mention a masochist named "Captain Carnage", who only dressed up in a costume in hopes of getting beaten up. And then Rorschach shoved him down an elevator shaft, and that was the end of that. Hooded Justice also gets aroused by fighting, if we're to believe the Comedian.
-   In the second issue of _Global Frequency_, we meet Captain Richard Quinn, a test subject for cybernetic augmentations, and discover that "They took my genitals away... There's a wire in my brain that simulates sexual pleasure when I kill people. That's all I have now." Of course, what does he do when he wakes up from his last operation and accidentally catches his reflection in a mirror? Go Mad from the Revelation and embark on a massive killing spree.
-   _Ultimate Marvel_: The Ultimate Hulk is described by Banner as being just as horny as he is angry. He's implied to have raped at least one person to death. Taken literally in _Ultimate Hulk vs. Wolverine_ when Hulk and a Hulked-out Betty Ross stop punching each other's lights out and start having angry, angry Hulk sex.
-   One issue of _The Spectre_ from the mid-80s shows a remarkably explicit (for a title not part of DC's "mature" _Vertigo_ line) ... _something_ ... going on between Spectre and Madame Xanadu. The action for the first several pages alternates between Spectre doing his normal grim work and Madame X, obviously nude and surrounded by the fog that indicates Spectre's presence in incorporeal form, writhing in apparent ecstasy. It's strongly implied that all of this is happening simultaneously.
-   _Birds of Prey: Dead of Winter_ has a couple of examples when the Birds fight the Secret Six.
    -   There's this line from a gory fight:
        
        **Big Barda:** Do you know what they call _this_ on Apokolips, harridan? _\[snaps Knockout's wrist\]_ _Foreplay._
        
    -   Knockout's teammate Ragdoll getting sexually aroused after Barda's teammate Manhunter beats the shit out of him, much to the latter's disgust.
-   This was played very seriously in the mini-series _Sachs & Violens_ by Epic Comics (a line of titles by Marvel meant for mature audiences, and yes, the name was a pun). One of the protagonists, "J.J." Sachs, is a model for softcore porn magazines; the other is her friend Ernie "Violens" Schultz, her photographer for said magazines. Ernie seems at first to be a shy and timid fellow, unlike the energetic Sachs, and she doesn't feel any romantic feelings for him... _However_, when he shows his violent side when criminals producing Snuff Films target Sachs and other models, the two become lovers. Sachs seems to find this side of him attractive.
-   The first issue of _Young Terrorists_ features several panels of various people reacting in sexually aroused ways immediately after viewing a webcast of a brutal underground fight.
-   A flashback in _Batwoman (Rebirth)_ shows Kate Kane sparring her girlfriend Sophie Moore when the two were cadets. After Sophie ends the fight by punching Kate across the jaw, Kate immediately makes a suggestive joke about not being able to perform oral sex anymore.

    Fan Works 

-   _Avatar: The Abridged Series_ Episode 3- "All this physical violence is turning me on!"
-   Korra in _Project Voicebend_ has no idea what sex is, but she gets _very_ excited whenever the subject of violence comes up. Every time she fights, she constantly gasps and screams in ecstasy. Katara likes to watch.
-   Vegeta accuses Freeza of getting off on beating up Gohan in _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_. Freeza responds with "Oh, unbelievably." The primitive Saiyans literally have sex via violence. One gets pregnant by getting kicked in the stomach.
    -   Cell, being an amalgam of both Freeza and several Saiyans, has this to an even greater degree. When Gohan threatens to kill him if he snaps, Cell is genuinely turned on.
        
        **Perfect Cell:** At first you had my curiosity. Now, you have my _erection._  
        **Gohan:** You mean, your attenti—?  
        **Perfect Cell:** _You all know what I'm about!_
        
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_ has many minions being genuinely aroused by inflicting or suffering pain in battle. Such as dark mistresses and horned reapers.
-   While in the original _Hellsing_ it's only implied, _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_ makes it quite clear that Alucard, Jan, and Father Anderson find violence arousing.
-   _Rosario Vampire: Brightest Darkness_: From Act V onwards, Kurumu gains a Super Mode, physically presented by her wings, tail, and claws being enveloped in purple fire, that makes her powerful enough to go toe-to-toe with Tsukune after his Restraining Bolt has been removed. However, her sex drive increases in proportion to her strength, and if it goes on for too long, she'll try to get it on with anyone (while she prefers Rason when it gets to that point, she's also tried to force herself on Rin and Sun).
-   _Metroid: Kamen Rider Generations_: This chapter showcases Gandrayda's tendency to get turned on while fighting high-ranked Ganma Mooks, much to the ire of her rival, Samus; as well as Mitsuzane.
-   Used repeatedly in the _Super Smash Bros_ fics _Flinch_. Samus and Zelda are attracted to each other, but there's no romance there as Samus is too deeply troubled and only ever hurts Zelda. The one time they do have sex it's Rape by Proxy as Zelda's Split Personality Sheik seduced Samus without Zelda's consent. Thus, Zelda and Samus take out Unresolved Sexual Tension by beating each other up.
-   _Vale's Underground_: Cinder is outright stated to be sexually aroused by violence. When Mercury has sex with her, she reaches orgasm when he talks about how they'll brutalize their enemies. Even in the middle of having a threesome with him and Emerald, she is still thinking about the stripper that she and Mercury skinned alive from earlier. The reason she was in the threesome was that she was so turned on by the gruesome act and needed to relieve the tension.
-   _RWBY: Scars_ depicts Tyrian in this manner. The fic ups Tyrian's creepy factor by making her Villainous Breakdown scene sexual-laden. In the scene where she tells Salem that she failed at killing Ruby, she begins smashing her head against the ground in repentance after Salem calls her a disappointment. When a Beowolf attacks her, she stabs it repeatedly then starts grinding on it. The scene cuts off after Tyrian rips the Beowolf's heart out and licks it. It freaks Cinder out but all she can do is stare. It doesn't matter to Tyrian what species she's beating up, as long as it involves violence.
-   In _Eight Count_, Harley and Pam have sex for the first time after Harley's first boxing victory, which she won by knockout.
-   West Point cadets Kate Kane and Sophie Moore have sex in the locker room showers after beating each other up for an academy boxing championship in _Well-Matched_.
-   _Temporal Anomaly_: While trying to kill each other in their first battle, both Sougo and Zero get turned on to the point of having sex in the forest they fought in after Sougo gets rid of the Flower in Zero's eye.
-   Implied in _Vow of the King_. After her battle with Ichigo, Unohana is stated to have a considerable glow about her which multiple characters comment on. Bambietta outright asks if Ichigo had sex with her, stating Unohana had "that post-dicking glow".

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _GoldenEye_, Xenia Onatopp clearly enjoys killing her victims a little too much. This is especially true during her fight with Bond himself.
    
    **Xenia:** _\[getting slammed into walls\]_ Yes!... Yes!... **Yes!**  
    **Bond:** _\[pulling a gun on her\]_ No, no, _no_. No more foreplay. Take me to Janus.
    
-   _Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)_: After setting off a bomb in her husband's pocket, Jane slams into her husband's car to prevent him from getting in the driveway. Then they have a Gun Fu Battle ranging all over their house. Then after John uses the gas line to blow up his wife, he jumps through the flames and they proceed to have a fight full of Ass Kicking Poses, using weapons like silverware, liquor bottles, walls, headbutts from Jane, Jane tossing from John, a Groin Attack by Jane and many other dirty, dirty fighting moves. Luckily, they are both made of iron and love each other, so the fight spirals down to, of course, sex.
-   _Demolition Man_ spoofs this with Huxley offering to have sex with John Spartan because the fight induced a "heightened physical state". She even lampshades the "known connection between sexual arousal and violence".
-   _An American Werewolf in London_: Alex and David are both shown biting each other as a form of foreplay.
-   _Deadpool (2016)_ invokes this when the Merc with the Mouth caps three goons with a single shot, inhales the smoke from his guns' barrels, then announces: "I'm touching myself tonight."

    Literature 

-   _Lord of the Flies_: The scene in which Jack and the other hunters attack and kill a nursing sow. The language is... somewhat incongruous with what they're doing.
-   In Orson Scott Card's short story "Closing the Timelid", collected in _Maps in a Mirror_, teenagers project temporary bodies into the past to get hit by cars. One girl, returning, says dying is sex.
-   In the _Hyperion Cantos_, Kassad gets superpowers for a while and, as he slaughters a bunch of enemies, the reader is treated to a description of how much he's getting off on it. Actually, he's implied to connect sex and violence for most of his life.
-   In _Crash_, the characters are car accident fetishists and seek orgasm by deliberately crashing their cars. They often end up seriously injured as a result and cause the death of other people.
-   In James Tiptree Jr.'s "The Screwfly Solution", there's a worldwide epidemic of men murdering women. It's suggested that for men, sexual desire and aggression are similar to begin with, and now, for some reason, when a man is turned on at all he becomes murderous. Aliens are manipulating our hormonal drives to cause our extinction.
-   In one of _The Dresden Files_ short stories, Jenny Greenteeth tries to drown Harry in a punchbowl while getting herself off on him at the same time. There's also a scene at the end of _Turn Coat_ where Madeline is killed by her cousin, Lara.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, Jaime Lannister states that the only times he feels alive are when he is either having sex with his sister or fighting. He also dryly notes that the aftermath of his fight with Brienne looks like they've been screwing rather than knocking the shit out of each other. The connection between sex and combat is also noted several times by various other characters, unsurprisingly given the Rape, Pillage, and Burn that frequently happens after a fight.
-   Lynn Kurland's _The Very Thought of You_ has the hero and heroine sparring with swords (it's the twelfth century, he's trying to prove a point, she's not having any, you get the picture) that ends when they drop their swords simultaneously and wind up snogging the living daylights out of each other.
-   Shayla from _The Wrath Of Ambar_ feels most alive when she is killing. She admits to becoming aroused by bloodshed and her own cruelty. In one of her first POV chapters, she goes into vivid detail about how orgasmic it feels to crunch skulls under her boots.
-   In the V. C. Andrews novel _My Sweet Audrina_, the title character and her husband get into a huge verbal and physical alteration, with her enraged at his infidelity and for perpetuating the that it's SHE who was gang-raped as a child instead of some non-existent older sister. Somewhere along the line, the fight turns into, as she described it, "the greatest passion of my life, brutal passion that devoured and demanded."
-   _Serge Storms_ : Some of Serge's less healthy relationships (most notably with Sharon and Rachael) involve the couple hitting or threatening each other before and during sex. Coleman thinks Serge and Sharon's lovemaking is too mutually violent to count as actual rough sex and is more of "an alley fight with a quickie worked into the choreography."

_Across the street, Serge and Sharon were in their bedroom breaking lamps, throwing ashtrays, pulling knives, and otherwise making love._

    Live-Action TV 

-   At times, it seems this trope is deliberately invoked or explored in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_.
    -   The series often presents a link between combat and the sexuality of Slayers and Vampires. When the characters discuss fighting, they sound like they're talking about sex. Notably, Faith gets off on both combat and sex and tries to get Buffy to enjoy it as she does. Also, many vampire attacks have extended rape metaphors. Most obviously done in "Bad Girls" and "Fool for Love".
        
        **Joyce:** Honey, did you ... somehow, unintentionally, lead him on in any way? Uh, send him signals?  
        **Buffy:** Well, I... I do beat him up a lot. For Spike, that's like third base.
        
    -   The first time Buffy and Spike have sex is in "Smashed", in the middle of a fight. They go from bashing each other to pieces to kissing to having sex all in the same 30 seconds.
    -   In the Season Eight comics, when realizing his identity of Twilight, Buffy repeatedly attempted to beat the crap out of Angel, but under the influence of Twilight, she soon after began having passionate sex with him.
-   Look no further than "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", series 2 of _Torchwood_, John Hart vs Jack Harkness. Snog, fight, laugh maniacally. Rinse and Repeat.
-   An episode of _Chuck_ has Casey fighting it out with Gertrude Verbanski, a business rival of the eponymous character's Carmichael Industries. Needless to say, the fight got a bit _passionate and intense_ as it wore on if you know what we mean.
-   _Burn Notice_: Fiona is like this the whole series. She comes on to Michael after knocking a man out. Michael is not receptive. Changes later in the series were a workout/sparing session resembles a makeout session.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_: When Matt dated Elektra in college, sparring as sexual foreplay was par for the course.
-   _Cobra Kai_: It seems to run in the LaRusso genes.
    -   Played for Laughs in season 1, when Daniel has refurbished his home dojo and wants to spar with someone. He asks his daughter Sam, but she's not interested after receiving a harassing message from her former friends. So he goes to his wife and proposes that she spar with him after he joins her for spin class. Amanda is hesitant, remembering that the last time they sparred, their son Anthony was born nine months later.
    -   Sam inherits it from her dad.
        -   In season 1 episode 7, her first date with Miguel sees her do a flawless leg throw takedown on him, visibly turning him on. Then she straddles him before kissing him.
        -   In season 2 episode 7, this happens in her hookup with Robby, where they hook up after circular sparring training in a meat locker.
        -   In season 3 episode 8, Sam is back together with Miguel, and toasting to saving the All Valley Tournament in the Miyagi-Do backyard. After some teasing over Johnny's unorthodox forms of training vs. Miyagi-Do's, she challenges him to a bit of sparring. They spar for a bit, with her getting the upper hand on Miguel, who counters by pulling her against him and getting her in a loose headlock, with her ready to go in for the kiss. But before they can do so, they're interrupted by the arrival of Robby.
        -   In season 3 episode 9, Sam shows Miguel the drum technique. He counters with some moves of his own, sweeps her off her feet, lays her on the mat, and they passionately kiss...which is how they're caught by Daniel moments later. After Daniel's talk with Miguel, he leaves, though warns them to "keep the sparring to a minimum."
    -   Miguel has a moment of this during his relationship with Tory in season 2. When their first matchup in the dojo gets a bit hot and heavy, Johnny tells them to do their "hide the plantain" routine in their own time.
-   _Kingdom (2014)_: Alicia and Ryan's first grappling session clearly gets both of them gears going, and they have sex later that day.

    Music 

-   _Meaning of Life_ by Disturbed is often confused for battle music. Listen to the lyrics. You'll hear it.
-   "Poker Face" by Lady Gaga.
    
    'Baby when it's love if it's not rough it isn't fun.'
    
-   Florence + the Machine's "Kiss with a Fist", although the singer says it's meant to be metaphorical.
-   Defied by the band _Bush_ in their song "Everything Zen".
    
    'There's no sex in your violence. There's no sex in your VI-O-L-E-E-E-E-E-E-NCE!'
    
-   Kanye West makes an interesting pun about gang-banging in "Hell of a Life."
-   Jane's Addiction's "Ted, Just Admit It" takes this view. It should be noted that the song depicts the viewpoint of Real Life Serial Killer Ted Bundy.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Egyptian stories say that during his final battle with Horus, the god Set sometimes said things that may have a few meanings. Horus also ripped off his balls.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Wrestlers will sometimes get very obvious erections while wrestling.
    -   Renee Dupree would sport a very obvious erection when he wrestled, which he would show off during his prancing finisher move.
    -   Though to be fair, it's possible (and common) for men to get erections without any sort of arousal.
    -   In the case of _professional_ wrestling, this may not have all that much to do with "violence" _per se_.
    -   Wrestling is hard, rough exercise, involves a lot of close contact, and gets the blood flowing. Most if not all of your muscles will get an increased blood flow... and although the penis is not exactly a muscle, it does need increased blood flow to become erect. It's also entirely possible that some wrestlers just get off on pain. These have been written on this subject before (boxers, wrestlers, and other "rough" fighting sport practitioners may have unwittingly gotten into the sport because they subconsciously enjoy the pain associated with it), but their validity is a discussed matter.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Two examples from _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Dark Eldar who refused to give up their (incredibly) hedonistic lifestyle, and continue to exist by consuming the souls of others through their suffering. This means their entire existence is based on sadistic torture for their own pleasure and feeding the God of Pleasure to stave off the god's hunger.
    -   Followers of Slaanesh, the God of Pleasure, in general do this as well. Writhing in _ecstatic pleasure_ when engulfed by a flamethrower is noted as being something they do — and many will fight over being the first to be hurt in such a way.
-   _Exalted_ has the Sapphire Veils of Passion Style. Sidereal Martial Arts are all based on expressing various universal principles and concepts through the medium of Supernatural Martial Arts. Sapphire Veils of Passion's theme is, well...sex.

    Video Games 

-   _Unreal Tournament 2004_ has three announcers — "Male", "Female", and "Sexy". The latter seems to enjoy combat a bit too much.
-   In _Knights of the Old Republic 2_, the Echani hold that only through combat can one truly communicate. A male player character can seduce the Echani party member by defeating her repeatedly in training (among other things). And the Echani fights in her lingerie (and asks you to do the same), to boot. Oy!
-   The Tainted Coil faction in _Brütal Legend_ fits. They often express joy while being harmed or killed, and their attacks tend to self-mutilate and/or involve Gorn. Not to mention the bondage gear and spraying of blood and organs as a weapon.
-   _Bayonetta_, all the way.
-   Ivy Valentine of _Soulcalibur_.
-   _No More Heroes_: For many assassins, violence is arousing; Travis even recharges his Beam Katana by shaking it vertically, as if he was masturbating. The trope is even more evident with Bad Girl.
-   The Dark Mistresses in _Dungeon Keeper_. They happily jump headlong into a fight, even against completely overwhelming odds.
-   Gray Fox from _Metal Gear Solid_, particularly when he begs you to "Hurt me more!"
-   Two examples from the _Devil May Cry_ games:
    -   The boss battle with Nevan in _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_. The pre-fight cutscene looks more like a prostitute propositioning a john in a brothel, she taunts Dante by calling him "sugar", makes noises that sound like she's climaxing whenever she takes a hit, can replenish her health by kissing Dante and their post-combat dialogue sounds oddly like a post-coital conversation, with Dante even holding her in a lover's embrace.
    -   Gloria's first appearance in _Devil May Cry 4_. Someone who posted the scene on YouTube actually said: "I hope I don't get in trouble for posting porn." Then there's the Lucifer acquisition scene. "First, I whip it out! Then I _thrust it_!"...
-   Dolores, Luong, Mature, Shermie<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and Vice from _The King of Fighters_.
-   Litchi Faye-Ling from _BlazBlue_ makes some... interesting noises when she gets hit.
-   Silver Mantis from _City of Heroes_ is a metal fetishist and sidekick to Black Scorpion. She gets quite excited during your fights with her. Her dialogue during the battle with her in the Statesman Task Force is quite blatant about this for a teen-rated game.
    
    Start of combat: "C'mon, Heroes. I'll take you all at once!"  
    75% HP: "Mmmmm! You hurt me so good!"  
    50% HP: "The pain! The anger! Yes! You really know how to treat a girl!"  
    25% HP: "Oh yes! OH YES! This is a battle!"  
    When defeated: "That's it... I'm spent. Take the code, you earned it."  
    Defeating a player character: "Done already? I hoped you'd last... longer."
    
-   Han Juri of _Super Street Fighter IV_
    
    "Give it all you've got. Try and break me."
    
-   _Mortal Kombat X_ has Mileena. When she's not laying down the threats, she's _embracing_ them with all the gusto of a hungry she-wolf. As this lovely exchange with Sub-Zero can attest:
    
    **Subs:** You will know the sting of winter.  
    **Mileena:** Come, let me warm you...
    
-   In _Blaze Union_, it's revealed that due to their demonic heritage, fighting is extremely physically pleasurable for both Gulcasa and Emilia. Gulcasa is _usually_ not outwardly enthusiastic about it, but Emilia is a different story entirely. This is something of a plot-relevant metaphor in one route.
-   The Four Guardians in _Megaman Zero_ seem to _really_ enjoy fighting Zero... to quote Harpuia (who's practically tame compared to Leviathan):
    
    **Harpuia:** I enjoy the sensation. I love the pain. You are worthy.
    
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_: Ghirahim, whose dialogue, sound effects, and battles strongly evoke this trope for him. He licks his lips before summoning his sword and also licks the blade at times.
-   _Senran Kagura_: None of the shinobi seem to get off explicitly from fighting, but Ryona and Haruka do get turned on from getting beaten up and will make it very clear whenever their clothes are torn off.
-   _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_ has an Easter Egg conversation if Tibarn and Nailah somehow make their way to each other in Part 3's endgame. They talk about how they've 'wanted this' for some time, openly flirt with one another, and agree that other characters wouldn't understand their 'urges', before immediately trying to tear each other to pieces.
-   _Darkstalkers_: Morrigan Aensland literally lives through pleasure, either sexual or combat-oriented, sometimes both.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Slow Damage_: Protagonist Towa considers inflicting and receiving pain rather pleasurable, with many sex scenes involving him practically begging to be punched, scratched, or bitten. Even lampshaded by his narration in the _Brother_ chapter, when Towa and Kirihara are beating the daylights out of each other, mentioning how both of them were clearly being turned on from the violence.
    
    _Listening to our labored breathing and the rustling movement, you might have thought we were having sex._
    
-   _Togainu no Chi_: Shiki's preferred method of pummeling Akira into submission.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   There was a genuine example in _Tales of MU_ between Mack and Sooni:
    
    "Stop having orgasms while I'm defeating you!"
    

    Web Videos 

-   The Nostalgia Critic practically molested That Sci-Fi Guy a few episodes after said Guy bombed him to smithereens. Also, in Critic's crossover review of _FernGully_ with the Chick, the scene cuts from the two of them violently fighting each other to dancing around in different clothes, something the fans speculated about for a while before Word of God eventually confirmed that they'd had sex.

    Western Animation 

-   _Drawn Together_:
    -   In an episode, Pokémon stand-in Ling Ling and his girlfriend "do battle" repeatedly, but seem dissatisfied. Eventually, they suggest, "how about we just drop the metaphor and have sex?"
    -   In a variant, another episode depicts Princess Clara _clearly_ getting off (to the extent of dialogue of the "ooo, yes... _yes_... ohh, **yes!**" variety) on watching car crashes.
-   In the _Futurama_ movie _Bender's Game_, Leela is forced to wear a shock collar to control her temper. Instead of becoming more docile, she ends up getting used to it and finding it pleasurable because she associates it with the fun of beating people up. In one fight in the movie, she ends up on the ground writhing in pleasure.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_ had Roxy Rocket, a stuntwoman/thief who pulled off high-altitude heists with the aid of a rocket. When Batman pursues her, Roxy starts laughing more and more, and eventually... well, she shows her O-face.
-   Lady Deathstrike moans in ecstasy in _Hulk Vs. Wolverine_, as she's digging her razor-sharp blade-fingers into Wolverine's back.
-   _The Venture Brothers_ featured Brock and Molotov Cocktease engaged in a violent brawl that plays like foreplay - and nothing but, to Brock's frustration.
