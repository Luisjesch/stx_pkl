_"I don't believe in humanity... But I believe in the potential of humanity."_

Humans suck, don't they? Their narcissism knows no bounds, their moral sense is hazy at best, they've been known to kill each other over the littlest slight, their physical prowess seems like a joke to some, they're often paradoxically too stupid to handle their vast intelligence, and to top it all off, they don't tend to look or smell too good, either. This gets worse if there are other races or superpowered people in the setting, compared to them we apparently must _really_ suck, and there's no arguing about it.

Except... being flawed isn't necessarily a bad thing. To be human is said to be flawed, limited, and finite; but to be a _good_ human is to nonetheless struggle through and work against or despite these limitations. That we live what many consider short lives and die gives the time in our lives meaning and fuel for art, science, and creativity. That we lack vast magical and psychic powers is countered because we can harness The Power of Love, Friendship, and all those lovely pink emotions.

_So what_ if Rousseau isn't right and people are fundamentally mean, nasty and brutish? What merit is there in being good if you can't choose to do otherwise? Despite the inherent moral flaws of humanity, enough people are putting the effort into being nice and kind that it does make a difference. Even if seemed that Being Good Sucks, humanity as a whole realizes deep down that Being Evil Sucks more.

This is a typical fantasy/sci-fi aesop that gets referenced in other genres. Essentially, the aesop is we are Cursed with Awesome. If the story has a Fantastic Aesop against removing one of the above human flaws to better mankind, this trope is usually invoked as the reason why it's wrong.

The Patrick Stewart Speech usually has this as the core message. See also/compare Humans Are Special.

Compare/contrast Humans Are Bastards when human beings in general are depicted as being inherently Jerkasses to each other, and Hobbes Was Right when humans play nicely with each other only because they are forced to do so. These human flaws may lead to other races considering that Humans Are the Real Monsters.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Death Parade_: While characters throughout the series express many different opinions on humanity as a whole, The Dark-Haired Woman comes to this conclusion towards the end of the series, deciding that it’s wrong to judge others - no matter how bad their actions may seem - because it’s impossible to truly understand what someone else is going through.
    
    People aren’t as complex as you think they are. They’re simple, and they get sad or angry over simple things. They’re quickly affected by the littlest things, and live without knowing were they’re going to fall down. That’s who people are!
    
-   _Dragon Ball Super_: During the Future Trunks Saga, this turns out to be the core of Zamasu's beliefs; he views mortals as Always Chaotic Evil since despite possessing the knowledge of the gods, they repeatedly go to war and keep making the same mistakes again and again. At first, he simply views this as making them not worth the gods' protection, but after a sparring match with Goku and discovering that mortals can grow powerful enough to challenge the gods, this spirals into a desire to wipe them all out.
    -   Zamasu's master, Gowasu, agrees that mortals are flawed beings, but insists that they can learn and grow from their mistakes and that it's the Kais' duty to protect and nurture them, while also making it a point that the gods themselves are not infallible and must also learn from their mistakes; Zamasu vehemently disagrees.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_ devotes a whole Mind Screw of an episode to it in "Interlude Party". Human strength comes from the drive to overcome human weakness.
    
    We will change. Because we can change, I know it. We may be weak, but we just have to be; if not, then we wouldn’t have any reason to grow, to get strong. I know that it may seem futile to you, but it’s not, because we are getting stronger with every step we take. You see, I’m sure we can change! Because we’re weak, and because we die. We have to fight in order to live, and that’s what will make us strong.
    
-   This seems to be the best way to sum up the philosophies of the main characters in _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_. They've all done things they aren't proud of, but seem to take a "humans are inherently flawed, but all we can do is the best we can" approach to their struggles.
-   _Monster_ is largely about this. Tenma and Johan come to different conclusions from this premise.
-   While _Sound of the Sky_ ends on a fairly ambiguous note, Rio's ending narration works toward this trope.
    
    **Rio:** Yeah...even if the world is going to end someday, until then, all that we have here with us is our future.
    
-   This is discussed in _Black Butler_, by Ciel and Sebastian shortly after Ciel has ordered the murder of a large number of children. Ciel degrades humans for being weak and fundamentally evil and curses himself for being one, but Sebastian notes that it is this constant struggle and their lofty goals that makes them interesting.
-   A central theme in _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, and what inspires the villains to pursue their Assimilation Plot.

-   This is Scheherazade's belief in _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_ to contrast Mogammet's Humans Are the Real Monsters and What Measure Is a Non-Super?. Scheherazade knows that humans' flaws can take them to make mistakes and lose their paths but if they're brave enough, they can learn from their errors to be better and even invent great things that can be equal to magic.
-   _Berserk_ really blurs the line between this and Humans Are Bastards. On one hand, immorality, debauchery, violence, and corruption are a common occurrence, to the point where humans are easily capable of transforming into hideous demons by sacrificing those they care for the most (and nearly all have taken the deal when it was offered). However, there are points where one can also see the goodness of humanity at work.
    -   A good example is Guts himself. Early chapters painted him as a very dark and cynical character who is driven by anger and Revenge. However, Character Development has instilled in him a strong desire to protect those he cares about, and he's proven time and again that he will never abandon or betray them. Despite everything the guy has gone through, he's still able to find reason to trust those close to him.
-   A major theme of _Attack on Titan_, exploring how humanity deals with extreme circumstances like famine, land shortages, floods of refugees, and of course giant monsters that want to eat them.
-   Even though _Black Bullet_ highlights the Humans Are Bastards trope a lot, Rentaro Satomi and Enju Aihara holds this viewpoint in regard to humanity. They both acknowledge that humanity has done _very_ horrible things towards cursed children, but they still hold faith in humanity believing that there is a good side to being human and hoping society will accept cursed children as humans, which is why they continue fighting against the Gastrea.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V_ has this final viewpoint on humanity. While the show doesn't shy away from how vicious and cruel humanity can be, the Big Bad was revealed to ultimately be someone that desired for everyone to be happy until he was driven insane trying to listen to the general public's sadism and bloodlust. In the end, the show shows that nearly everyone can change for the better if someone is willing to show them the way.

    Comic Books 

-   _Clive Barker's Next Testament_: After Wick launches the apocalypse, his two divine brothers Unan and Filt counter Wick's diatribe that Humans Are Bastards by pointing out what that says about them as creators. Humans are necessarily flawed because that is all three of them managed to create.
-   _The DCU_: This is an underlying message in this franchise, alongside its rival. There is a lot of evil in humanity, ranging from average thugs to corrupt politicians to supervillains, but there is good in the hearts of people, and this is the goal of superheroes: to show people how to be better. It won't be easy, but it's possible.

-   _Godzilla Aftershock_: Discussed by Tarkan Çavusgolu when conversing with Emma Russell about the socio-political ramifications of the world becoming aware that Kaiju are real.
    
    **Tarkan:** Funny, isn't it? How much the world has changed. Everything that used to be so important — land, resources. Overpopulation, religion. Those things that once divided us all seem so petty now. Maybe humans are at our best when we're facing a common threat. I don't know. What do you think?  
    **Emma:** I don't think anything's changed. Nothing at all.
    
-   _Judge Dredd_: Mega-City One is a dystopian Police State, but this is largely necessary because the city really is _that_ violent and dysfunctional without the Judges. While there is a democratic movement seeking to remove the Judges, it's made very clear throughout the comic that the city would not become a utopia if they actually got their way (nor do most of the citizens actually _want_ real democracy), nor are the Judges themselves a panacea for every social ill and have committed some very questionable things. Humans themselves are just way too flawed for the system to function indefinitely.
    
    **Roscoe:** There are a lot of bad people in the Big Meg, but there good cits here too. Human beings should the chance to figure things out for themselves. Without monsters like Death shutting it all down before they get it right.
    
-   _Marvel Universe_: This is an underlying message in this franchise, alongside its rival. Sure, the populace may be incredibly easy to manipulate sometimes, there's the whole supervillain problem, and even the heroes aren't infallible (just check out all those times they fight one another). But it's made clear there is a lot of potential for good in humans, and that they and the heroes, who themselves can overcome their flaws and differences, can make a better world, even if it won't be easy.
-   _Second Coming_: While years of trying to rein humanity in and failing gives God a Humans Are Bastards stance and Jesus thinks that Humans Are Good and just needs encouragement, the comic itself veers more into this. By the end, God is less cynical about humans in his friendship with Sunstar and Sheila, while discovering just how twisted his followers have become teaches him that humans aren't exactly perfect either.
-   _Spawn_: Post-_Resurrection_, whereupon God was turned into the actual benevolent creator of the universe instead of the tyrannical son of the Mother of Existence and went from He to She, it's revealed that She made humanity a flawed addition to Her otherwise perfect design, precisely because its perfection meant it had no real purpose. As humans had flaws and free will, they could create their meaning. To finalize this plan, She hid mankind's fate even from Herself.
-   _Transmetropolitan_. A lot. Especially towards the end, where Spider constantly drops that, despite being a bastard and some sort of weird figure for the masses, he's still human like everyone else, along with all the great and the extra-evil that humanity does on a daily basis.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: Discussed by Dr. Chen in Chapter 12 of this _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ fanfiction. Indeed, after the Mass Awakening, the majority of the public have grown accepting of the Titans' power and natural authority and their ecological importance, though there's still a minority that advocates attempting to kill Titans such as the Ghidorah-like Monster X out of paranoia. Vivienne Graham and human characters also deride the sheer reckless hubris of the military who deployed the Oxygen Destroyer, and the corporations who are utilizing Titan DNA.
-   _A Brighter Dark_: In this Alternate Universe retelling of Fire Emblem Fates, the majority of the cast has pretty good intentions. Even characters who were previously utterly evil in the canon series are altered to have more believable ideals: the fighters on both sides of the war between Nohr and Hoshido are just trying to do what's right for their people. However their personal flaws and inability to communicate make finding peaceful resolutions impossible and is the primary cause of all the bloodshed that happens, despite both sides being made up of primarily decent individuals.
-   This is a central theme in the Yellowstone continuity of _The Conversion Bureau_. Before the start of the adventure, Celestia warns Twilight Sparkle that humans are savage creatures. By the end, Twilight does admit that humans can be harsh, but only because Earth is far more unforgiving than Equestria. It's for this reason that she comes to the conclusion that while humans most certainly aren't perfect, they generally try to do good more often than not, and that the humans who are just plain evil are the exception. Celestia turns out to agree with her.
-   A similar theme comes up in _The Conversion Bureau: The Other Side of the Spectrum_ - humanity's sheer savagery in the ways of war is extensively explored, and it's clear that there are some legitimately bad people out there...however, much like Yellowstone above, it's also made very clear that humans Had to Be Sharp to survive a much harsher world, and the great tragedy underlying the story is that it's very clear humanity and ponykind could accomplish so many amazing things together (and _have_), but some adamantly refuse to believe it's possible. At the same time though, it's also made clear that the majority of the ponies (including TCB Celestia herself) were brainwashed into hating humanity because The Man Behind the Man is engineering a plot to punish the whole human race as revenge for being beaten by _one_ single human in the distant past.
-   _Deleted Scene_, explores the relationship between Christopher and Wikus. Christopher Johnson, despite having to endure humanity's cruelty and affronts, is also aware of humanity's capacity for good, which is why he is willing to tolerate Wikus.
    
    **Christopher's thoughts**: The man was most certainly not the nicest of his kind. If it wasn't because Christopher knew better, he would give him away to the MNU right away. But the prawn had seen, on his first weeks on this planet, the softer, more generous side of this race. Had they not given them food and shelter instead of killing them all? Had they not provided a home once they knew they would never be able to leave, granted that home was not as cozy or as welcoming as one could hope? Maybe this human could still prove his worth. And gazing at the human's new arm he got the feeling the human would at least give it a try since now he had no choice but to adapt, like he himself, along with all his people, had had to learn to adapt once on a strange new world. Christopher understood the man because he knew well what it was like to be trapped in a world in which you don't seem to belong.
    
-   For all Salem likes to claim Humans Are Bastards in _The Grimm Prince_, the average everyday person is honestly fairly decent and just wants to earn a living; the real problem is basically everyone in charge. After the Grimm suddenly disappear overnight, humanity finds itself without any real enemies and roughly twenty times as much space as before, with even more resources. Despite this, it only takes two years for the kingdoms to go to war against each other.
-   The main reason SPEAR and its predecessors maintain the Masquerade in the _Heroes of the Storm_ fanfic _Heroes of the Desk_. It remains unexplained precisely _why_ The World Is Not Ready, but we get a Cryptic Background Reference to the fall of the Roman Empire due to The Unmasqued World.
-   In _A Loud Among Demons_, Lincoln doesn't believe that humans are as openly cruel or have shady secrets as his cynical demon co-workers believe they do. However, after his encounters with an Evil Teacher and a family of cannibalistic psychopaths, Lincoln comes to realize that there _is_ indeed some truth to their beliefs. Even still, Lincoln doesn't want to jump to rash conclusions about the people he meets and would rather wait until they show their true colors to start getting rough with them.
-   _The Night Unfurls_: Regarding the topic of human nature, Kyril refrains from taking the two extremes, believing that humanity has the potential to commit both great good and deep evil. Olga and Chloe don't approve, however.
-   In _Perfection Is Overrated_, a large part of the plot involves the characters of _My-HiME_ dealing with their personal problems, with the point being that by being imperfect and having to struggle against their flaws and improve themselves, they are stronger people than the "perfect" SUEs, who remain complacent.
-   _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ has this as a subtle theme across the universe. For all of humanity's faults, it is capable of, and has, improved.
-   _A Rabbit Among Wolves_: The ghost of Adam, surprisingly enough, takes this view. He sees most of humanity, not as malicious, but naïve about what faunus experience. Largely because they don't know what it is like to be seen as subhuman.
-   In _Sonic X: Dark Chaos_ Episode 75, Shadow the Hedgehog (of all people) uses this as his Kirk Summation when Maledict gives him a We Can Rule Together speech. When Maledict tells him that the "monkeys" are nothing but mongrels who corrupted his perfect design, Shadow retorts in a very neat Continuity Nod to the show's _Sonic Adventure 2_ arc:
    
    **Shadow**: I made a promise to a girl I loved named Maria. I forgot that promise and I nearly wiped out an entire race because of it. You despise humans... and yet a human taught me the most valuable lesson of all; there are still things worth fighting for.
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Amazing Spider-Man_: The starting point of Dr. Connors' research; he longs to create a world in which everyone is equal, a world in which illness and weakness don't exist. At the height of his insanity, he comes to the conclusion that humans are so imperfect that it's not right to leave them unevolved.
    
    **The Lizard**: I sought to create a stronger human being, but there's no such thing! Human beings are weak, pathetic, feeble-minded creatures... why be human at all, when we can be so much _more_?
    
-   _Avengers: Age of Ultron_: This is Ultron's reasoning why humanity needs to be wiped out — we're doomed to destroy ourselves. Vision _agrees_, but comes to a different conclusion.
    
    **Vision**: Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.
    
    **Ultron**: They're doomed.
    
-   The DC Extended Universe has this as a recurring theme.
    -   In _Wonder Woman (2017)_, Amazon myth tells that humanity is good and noble and just. However, since the movie takes place in World War One, Diana eventually comes to this conclusion - that there are humans that are violent and evil and cruel, but just as many that are what she was told about in her youth.
    -   At the end of _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_, Bruce Wayne acknowledges that humans are flawed, that they fight, kill, and betray one another, but they're still good and can rebuild and do better.
    -   In _SHAZAM! (2019)_, the Wizard spent decades searching for a truly good person to fight as his champion and brought in dozens of people into the Rock of Ages to test them, only for each of them to fail. You'd think that Billy Batson, who takes on the eponymous hero's powers, would be that one person who passed the test, right? Wrong. The only reason the Wizard chose Billy was that he had no other choice after Dr. Sivana (who'd failed many years ago) invaded the Rock of Ages and freed the Seven Deadly Sins, and Billy spends much of the movie fooling around with his new powers, only truly becoming a hero when his foster family is endangered. The implication that no one could ever pass the test says a lot about humanity.
-   _Equilibrium_ takes a similar approach. The entire reason for the plot was because human emotions were a flaw and the cause of 'man's inhumanity to man.' The ending, while portrayed positively, never exactly comes clear on whether restoring human emotion is a good thing.
-   In _The Giver_, all emotions have been evolved out of humanity in order for it to overcome its flaws, and from a totalitarian standpoint it _works_ — but as Jonas and the Giver show the Community, emotions are what make life worth it and are part of what makes us special.
-   Played very oddly and combined with Humans Are Special in _Green Lantern (2011)_; what makes humans so special is that _we're willing to admit that we're flawed_.
-   _Ouija Mummy_: When Chase tries to apologize for his behaviour the night before, he says it was stupid. Natalie responds by saying that **humans** are stupid, and that it's important to recognize these instances and try to avoid them in the future.
-   _Serenity_:
    -   This is one of the main themes (arguably _the_ main theme) of the movie. Even if the Pax had worked perfectly, it still would've been wrong to stifle the human emotional range for the sake of peace.
    -   Also Mal points out our flaws (Sins) are what keep humans from just laying down and dying.
-   _TRON: Legacy_: Flynn mentions this when discussing the consequences if CLU succeeds in entering the real world.
    
    **Flynn:** _\[on CLU\]_ He doesn't dig imperfection, and what's more imperfect than our world?
    
-   Deconstructed in _The World's End_. It turns out that humanity is the _least_ civilized species in the galaxy, and the Network is trying to bring humanity to a level where it could be brought into the galactic community. However, to do so they have to remove anyone who doesn't want to be part of the Network; and because humanity doesn't like being told what to do, the Network needs to replace _a lot_ of people in an attempt to make them more acceptable to the galactic community. Arguably, the point of Gary, Andrew, and Steven's rebuttal is that "Humans are special _because_ they are flawed".

    Literature 

-   Used in _Stranger in a Strange Land_. Compared to Martians, Humans are less intelligent, more violent, and less powerful. However, with a little wisdom from Mars courtesy of Michael, Humans can become immortal, psychic, spiritually peaceful, and sexually polyamorous. It's a bit of an Author Tract, but not an unpleasant one.
-   This trope is one of the underlying themes of _Good Omens_. Crowley and Aziraphale are constantly dealing with the paradox that humans are not only capable of vile cruelty and heavenly virtue, these things can exist within _one person_.
-   In the _Malazan Book of the Fallen_ series, the Crippled God uses this as a premise for his cults of salvation. Unfortunately, rather than delivering the message that mortals can overcome their flaws to do good, the religion is a worship of suffering and degradation.
-   Robert J. Sawyer's _The Neanderthal Parallax_ trilogy describes a parallel world in which Neanderthal man became the dominant species, and in almost every way homo sapiens compares badly. The Neanderthals live in harmony with nature, having a lower population and no pollution. Further, they have no crime, violence or war, and (possible Author Tract) no religion. The effect is to highlight all of humanity's flaws by describing alternate-world humans that have none of them due to literally having bred out of their own population all the negative traits by a program of enforced sterilizations over thousands of years (there is also one example involving domestic violence wherein this system is shown to utterly and totally fail).
-   _Discworld_:
    -   A theme of the series as a whole. Summed up in one book that says that to be human is to be "the place where the fallen angel meets the rising ape."
    -   _Lords and Ladies_ uses this to contrast with Can't Argue with Elves. The elves end up losing _because_ humans are flawed in comparison. Because humans die and change, they _learn_.
-   In Alan Dean Foster's _The Damned Trilogy_, humanity is discovered by an alliance of super-civilized alien species who are being forced to fight a war against their will. Compared to them we are portrayed as barely civilized, warlike, violence-crazed, and brutish, and indeed our love for inflicting death and destruction makes us the perfect soldiers. However we're also capable of great things, and many humans try to control their instincts and strive for more than just being the alliance's grunts.
-   _The Empirium Trilogy_: One theme woven throughout the trilogy is that no human is perfect. Trying to force someone to be completely flawless is inhumane and will bring about more misery, and not just for the person being scrutinized. Eliana pretty much states this theme outright during the climax of _Lightbringer_:
    
    Queen Rielle: I don't know how to be what I am, split in two like this. \[...\] I am but one queen. One queen with the desires of two. I cannot bear it.  
    Eliana: You can, and you will. We all have light and darkness inside us. That is what it means to be human.  
    Queen Rielle: And if I am more than human?  
    Eliana: Then you must carry more of the light, and more of the darkness too, and so must I.
    
-   _The Wheel of Time_ is an almost textbook example, to the point where this trope is built into the cosmology of the series. Eliminating the Dark One would lead to a soporifically dull world in which all humans are mindless automatons, and as the Dark One himself points out, this in itself would be a victory for him. Ultimately the protagonist is forced to leave the world's cosmology in balance, and it is implied this is all anyone will ever be able to do.
-   Harry Potter wrestles with this for the better part of a year in _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ when it comes to Dumbledore's full backstory. Harry had viewed him until his death with a large degree of hero worship and it's not until after the fact that he began to realize that he was far from perfect. Harry spends most of the book mad at him for never telling him important things like the fact that he had a sister who died or that he had a brief "friendship" with the previous Big Bad Grindelwald as a teen and the fact that he left Harry very vague instructions about how to defeat Voldemort. It's not until the very end of the book that Harry realizes that the former two things are very closely related and it was a very catastrophic example of a My Greatest Failure that he'd never brought up because he still hated himself for all of it. He also realizes the latter is more out of protection for him than everything. So after getting a chance to hear the full story from his brother and talking to "him" in the limbo between life and death, Harry comes to realize that Dumbledore did love him and was a good man. He'd made one particular huge mistake in his life but at the end of the day he was a person and people make mistakes. He ultimately forgives him, so much so that he names his younger son after him.
    -   Harry deals with this towards many of the elder characters in the series. At the start of the series, Harry views his father and his friends as nothing short of perfect paragons who ultimately fought and sacrificed against the dark forces, and disrespecting them in any way was nothing short of a Berserk Button for him. However, after seeing Snape's memories and seeing his father and his friends horrifically bullying Snape, something Harry has experience with, that he becomes deeply ashamed of them. He only later comes to terms with the fact that his father and their friends, despite their flaws, truly did try to do the right things when they counted, and sacrificed themselves for a better future.
    -   Last but not least, there's Snape, Harry's most disliked teacher, a feeling that is mutual, and who Harry suspects is a servant of Voldemort's. Throughout most of the series, Snape is petty and humiliating towards Harry and his friends, and after executing Dumbledore, Harry sees him as one of his most despised enemies. However, after learning the truth through Snape's memories (given to him by Snape in his final moments) and learning that Snape not only loved Harry's mother and was trying to redeem himself, but that Snape was always loyal to Dumbledore, and that he executed Dumbledore under the latter's orders so as to be able to thoroughly infiltrate Voldemort's inner-circle and act as a double-agent. This revelation causes Harry to develop immense respect for Snape, naming his younger son also after him, and calling Snape the bravest man he ever knew.
-   In _Pact_, Alexis, one of a community of starving artists based out of Toronto, takes this as her view of humanity. People, she argues, are fundamentally damaged—by life and by their own individual traumas. She takes this belief as her inspiration for helping others since she wants to be one of the ones that does a net value of good for the rest instead of a net evil.
-   _The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ_: The Stranger tells Christ that this trope is the reason why Jesus' mission is doomed to fail - not because he's wrong, but because he demands more of people than they will ever be capable of delivering.
    
    **The Stranger:** People are capable of great things, but only when great circumstances call on them. They can’t live at that pitch all the time, and most circumstances are not great. In daily life people are tempted by comfort and peace; they are a little lazy, a little greedy, a little cowardly, a little lustful, a little vain, a little irritable, a little envious.
    
-   In _Paladin of Souls_, when Ista is trying to unravel demons from the human souls they're possessing, she's worried that she's not getting them perfectly sorted out. Her god chimes in with some reassurance.
    
    **Ista:** It is imperfect.
    
    **The Bastard:** So are all things trapped in time. You are brilliant, nonetheless. How fortunate for Us that We thirst for glorious souls rather than faultless ones, or We should be parched indeed, and most lonely in Our
    
-   In the _Kane Series_ story "Two Suns Setting" that is the main point of the discussion between Kane and last king of dwarves Dwassllir. Dwassllir argues that humans are weak and would be nothing without their civilisation, which is like crutches to a cripple, while Kane points out that's exactly the point and that thanks to their inherent weakness and need for civilisations humans have become the fastest-growing race.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Farscape_:
    -   Despite shouting "Humanity Is Superior!" humans are most certainly **not**. One episode has aliens use Crichton's memory to simulate the possible outcome of revealing themselves to humanity in order to seek asylum. It doesn't end well. However, Crichton does become one of the most useful shipmates on Moya because of his ignorance and scientific training. It helps he was stir-crazy at appropriate times.
    -   Even more than that, it's Crichton's (and humanity's) persistence in the face of the toughest odds that set them apart from other species. It is viewed as a flaw by many, that humans are so ignorant they don't know when they're beat, but that characteristic is what kept Crichton and his shipmates alive for so long.
-   This is the whole reason for the Q's "prosecution" of humanity in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. Of course, the reaction to this is where the Patrick Stewart Speech got its name.
    -   This also shows up frequently in most iterations of the franchise, starting with _Star Trek: The Original Series_, where Kirk was frequently confronted with humanity's many flaws.
-   The Ancients (despite being humanity's progenitors) and the Nox, super-advanced alien races in the _Stargate-verse_, seemed to hold the fact that humanity was flawed against the SG-C, seizing on the slightest issue to deliver some moralizing message or condemnation (sometimes appropriate to the situation, but often not). Made worse by the Ancients being a bunch of expletives anyway. By way of contrast, the Asgard were both friendly and helpful despite knowing humanity was flawed, likely because unlike the other two they admitted they too had flaws. O'Neill once gave a heartfelt speech to the effect of 'we will mess up a lot as a species, but we are out here with you now and we are trying our best'. As he made it to the Asgard they were very approving.
-   Seems to be the Doctor's view of humanity in _Doctor Who_, as Earth is his "favorite/pet planet" so to speak, but will turn around and ridicule humans about their shortcomings should the situation be extreme enough.
    
    **The Doctor**: Human beings. You are amazing. Hah! Thank you.  
    **Zachary Cross Flane**: Not at all.  
    **The Doctor**: But apart from that you're completely mad. You should pack your bags, get back in that ship, and fly for your lives.
    
-   _Smallville_:
    -   This is how Jor-El views humans, and his spirit bemoans that Clark Kent was raised by humans and thus, thinks like one. One of the only reasons why he did not give up on humanity completely, was because Jonathan Kent's father offered him food and shelter when he visited Earth in the 1960s (even super-powered Kryptonians need to eat and sleep). The message on Kal-El's ship:
        
        On this third planet from this star Sol, you will be a god among men. They are a flawed race. Rule them with strength, my son. That is where your greatness lies.
        
    -   It should be noted that the A.I. of Jor-El believes this, not the real Jor-El. Reason being is that he created the A.I. version of himself without any of his own flaws - which, in this case, meant emotions. Considering how he later warms up to humanity as a whole, displays emotion, and states that Clark's destiny is to be a hero, not a conqueror, suggests that this might have been manipulation on the A.I.'s part.
    -   For a while Brainiac masquerades as Clark's history professor. In one episode he goes into a spiel in class that lists various examples of humans' willingness to betray their friends. At the end of the episode, Clark admits humans aren't perfect and are certainly capable of greed and treachery. We're also capable of honor and compassion.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   Lucifer believes this, calling humans "broken, flawed abortions." When God asked all of his angels to bow down before humans, Lucifer refused. "Father, I can't! These human beings are flawed! Murderous!" Naturally, Lucifer is a bit of a Hypocrite in that regard.
    -   Gabriel subverts this somewhat, since while he does state that humans are flawed, he also finds them better than most angels, since "a lot of them try... to do better... To forgive."
    -   Metatron also subverts it when talking to God, as he says that while humanity cheats and steals and destroys, they also give and create and sing and dance, and above all, they never give up.
-   A theme in the _Merlin (1998)_ series, best shown when the Lady of the Lake tells Merlin, "It's human to make mistakes, Merlin, and part of you is human . . . the best part."
-   Discussed in an episode of _Red Dwarf_, referring to John F. Kennedy:
    
    **Lister:** I thought you said he was a great guy!  
    **Kryten:** He was.  
    **Rimmer:** He was also an inveterate womanizer. His affairs were legendary. They never came out while he was alive.  
    **Kryten:** All great men have a weakness, an Achilles' Heel.  
    **Rimmer:** His was just... further up.
    
-   In _Babylon 5_, all the races are flawed. Discovering how truly flawed even the "superior" races are is a major element of the myth arc.
-   _Person of Interest_: Root believes this without believing there's anything redeemable about humans.
-   _The Sopranos_, in which selfishness, myopia, and dysfunction are portrayed as the constants of the human condition.
-   As in the movie "sequel" _Serenity_, in _Firefly_ the flawed nature of humanity is one of the central themes of the series.
    
    **Mal:** Mercy is the mark of a great man. _\[pokes Atherton Wing with sword\]_ Guess I'm just a good man. _\[pokes him again\]_ Well, I'm all right.
    
-   The central conflict of _The Good Place_ is how rigid and overly strict the system used for judging humans is, as it runs on a Black-and-White Morality line with no room for Grey-and-Grey Morality nuance. The four main humans aren't horrible people but they have deep character flaws due in large part to being victims of circumstance (Eleanor's Abusive Parents and Jason's sucky environment, for example), and all of them show their capacity for growth and becoming better over time.
    -   Eventually revealed that humans are so flawed in modern times that they have been figuratively barred from the Good Place for _521 years_. Judge Gen agrees with the system until she herself goes down to Earth for a while, and decides to fix the system so that _anyone_ who repents and improves can truly go into the Good Place.

    Music 

-   _Kids Praise_: It's not uncommon for characters (even Psalty himself!) to display flaws, such as selfishness, lack of empathy, or not having their priorities straight. How they and those around them deal with those flaws is a common recurring theme.
-   "Dark Side" by Kelly Clarkson:
    
    Everybody's got a dark side  
    Do you love me?  
    Can you love mine?  
    Nobody's a picture perfect  
    But we're worth it  
    You know that we're worth it
    
-   "Savages" by Marina Diamandis is the contemplation of Humans Are Bastards vs. Humans Are Flawed. She leans more towards the former but still asks, "Is it a human trait, or is it learned behaviour?" and says, "we can be bad as we can be good."
-   This is the ultimate message that Protoman has for Megaman in _The Megas_ song "Memories of the past". This is massive Character Development for Protoman as he's finally let go of his rage and resentment.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Christianity teaches that humans exist in a fallen state, with Jesus stating in the Gospel of Matthew that "...out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies." (NKJV) At the same time, the faith teaches that every human being is made in the Image of God, and as such, has infinite inherent worth.
-   This is the basis for the Jewish tradition of the Lamed Vavniks, or "Thirty Six": it's believed that there have never been fewer than thirty-six righteous men and women, and they're the ones who justify the whole of humanity before the eyes of God. That's it: Yahweh tolerates His flawed children because there are always at least 36 of them who are "good enough"; the implication being that, if the righteous were ever to fall below this number, He would give up on humanity and destroy everyone. (Yay!)

    Tabletop Games 

-   This is the general feeling of _New Horizon_. Humans did some terrible things and had to leave Earth, but now that they're on a new planet they have a grand future!
-   _Warhammer_ and _Warhammer 40,000_: The Chaos gods are usually agreed to be the worst of Mankind's enemies. Unfortunately, since they are basically made of emotion (rage, love, desire, and hope), humanity keeps fueling them even when defeating their agents in the material plane.
-   In every iteration of _Dungeons & Dragons_ before Third Edition, the distinguishing feature of Humans was that they had no distinguishing features. Every other race had a laundry list of special abilities. The tradeoff for this was that humans were the only race that could be any class (in fact, they were the only race that could be paladins at all) and could reach the maximum level in every class. The explanation generally given for this was that being generally unexceptional and shorter-lived than other races caused humans to be more ambitious and faster learners. In Third through Fourth Edition, humans have been given special racial abilities, but they tend to make humans more versatile instead of more powerful (for example, in 4E, humans get +2 to any one stat of their choice, while every other race gets +2 to two stats, but one of them is fixed and the other is either also fixed or a choice of two stats).

    Theater 

-   20th-century Playwright Arnold Wesker wrote a trilogy of plays (Chicken Soup and Barley, Roots, I'm Talking About Jerusalem) about a family trying to deal with changing social times. The final play in the trilogy features a young idealistic couple trying to make an independent living for themselves, but eventually fail.
    
    I do the right things, I say the right things, but somewhere, some bloody where I fail as a human being.
    

    Video Games 

-   While it first appears to set up a Humans Are the Real Monsters message, _Aselia the Eternal - The Spirit of Eternity Sword_ in the end opts for this. You have your instantly nice and understanding characters like Yuuto and Lesteena, your neutralish characters like Kouin and the populace at large, and finally the evil people like Shun and Soma. The populace eventually grows to accept Yuuto and the spirits and see them as heroes, while Shun gets a decent motivation in a New Game Plus and a Sympathy for the Devil moment.
-   This is a major theme of _BioShock_. No matter what kind of ideal society a person tries to create — an Objectivist city of laissez-faire capitalism, a culture based on altruism, a theocratic society that idolized american exceptionalism, or even revolutionaries who want to overthrow said theocracy — human flaws inevitably doom it. At the same time, there will always be a good person willing to stand up and try to fix the problems these misguided attempts at utopia create, often helping in other, smaller ways along the way.
-   In _DmC: Devil May Cry_, Mundus mocks Dante's desire to free humanity from demons by claiming that humans had freedom before he came, and in his words "They fought. They killed. They starved. I brought _order_." Vergil also believes this is true, and wishes to rule humanity alongside Dante after Mundus is defeated. He believes humans are like children that need to be protected from themselves. Dante counters this by pointing out that they would never have defeated Mundus without the aid of Kat, a human.
-   _Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light_'s Big Bad declares that he is the darkness in everyone's heart and that he would never have gained power if humans weren't inclined towards evil in the first place; all of the problems in the game were caused by his servants using Batman Gambits to manipulate people into being greedy, paranoid, hateful, etc. The party's Guest Star Party Members turn up and say that while human beings _are_ sometimes ugly and wicked, they also have a boundless capacity for hope and love, giving the party the boost they need to defeat his final form.
-   A major point of the _Guilty Gear_ series, and very evident in some of the character's backstories:
    -   The main protagonist, Sol Badguy, was once a genius scientist who created the Gears and was against his will turned into one himself. Wracked with enormous guilt <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  over the destruction his creations caused, he has undertaken a personal mission to hunt down and destroy every last Gear in existence. Over time, his rivalry with Ky Kiske turned into a solid friendship, and he also became close to Ky's wife Dizzy, and his son, Sin, who are both Gears. Much of his Character Development in _Xrd_ is about him trying to overcome his obsession with his past.
    -   Dr. Baldhead was once a good doctor who never failed to treat the sick. Until one day, when a young girl died on his operating table. His guilt drove him insane and he became a serial killer, killing people with a giant scalpel. One day, the girl appeared to him in a vision and told him that her death wasn't his fault and that she was assassinated. Baldhead had a Freak Out and disappeared. Some time later, rumours of a talented but eccentric healer wearing a paper bag on his head circulated. The man refers to himself simply as Faust, but he's actually a reformed Dr. Baldhead, taking time to atone for his past by using his healing powers and also tracking down the young girl's killers. He grapples with his Ax-Crazy inner-self and admits to still having a fondness for bloodshed, but he manages to keep it under control.
    -   Millia Rage was orphaned at an early age and coerced by her ex-boyfriend to assassinate people, but she has since betrayed her employers and really just wants to be left alone now. She struggles to form relationships with people, she grapples with her past, and she is rather cynical and spiteful towards men. She is a fairly decent person deep down, however.
    -   Pretty hard to believe that Chipp Zanuff, the idiotic goofball who jumps around shouting Gratuitous Japanese, was once a _drug dealer_. He believes his ninja master saved him from his tortured life, and so he's a decent guy now. By _Xrd_, he's become the president of a small country.
-   _Kid Icarus: Uprising_ has this as its hat, with most of the gods having various negative opinions on humanity. Medusa sees them as playthings and vermin to crush under her heel. Poseidon sees them as prideful, envious, and deceitful beings who need to be put in their place when they get too uppity. Viridi sees them as destructive to both themselves and the planet and wants to wipe them out to protect the world. Hades refers to them as greedy beings who will happily fight and kill each other for their desires and his own entertainment. Even Palutena refers to them as greedy and selfish beings driven by desires, but unlike the other gods is willing to admit that the gods aren't so different and whenever the gods fight, humans are always the innocent bystanders caught in the cross-fire.
-   In _Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning_, the Fae are of this opinion to all the mortal races (or "Children of Dust"). Although it's a Broken Base in-universe as some Fae think we are a mistake the gods made but won't remove while others love us for it because they say our lives, while short, are more interesting and meaningful, since we don't live by the enforced "Groundhog Day" Loop they do (also some of them have grown weary of immortality) which means we have to carefully consider HOW we live our lives.
-   This is very apparent in _L.A. Noire_, what with the scores of less-than-perfect people Cole encounters. This trope is even invoked by Roy Earle, of all people ("Everyone has their vices, even you, Cole."). Even Cole ends up having an affair and leaving his wife and kids, and even then, his past was hardly spotless.
-   _Mass Effect_ has this as one of its main themes. Humans, as well as every other race in the galaxy except the Reapers, have both good and bad individuals in them, and while there are many lawless areas in the galaxy, and the Obstructive Bureaucrat tendencies of many politicians, the Citadel species are overall doing their best. Shepard can even say this in _Mass Effect 2_.
    
    "People are messy, awkward, sometimes selfish and cruel. But they're trying, and I'm going to make sure they have a chance."
    
-   Humans are portrayed as this throughout much of the _Mega Man_ franchise. While there are undeniably heroic humans such as Dr. Light, Cain and Ciel, every conflict in nearly the entire timeline ultimately stems from Dr. Wily's petty feud with Light, and other villains such as Sigma and Dr. Weil hold unabashed Humans Are Bastards viewpoints even though Weil is a human himself and gleefully indulges in his Card-Carrying Villain status. Humans are also portrayed as becoming increasingly complacent and reliant on machines, to the point that Zero expresses disgust with the citizens of Neo Arcadia for mindlessly tolerating an oppressive dictatorship simply because it fulfills their basic needs. Ultimately, though, X continues to maintain hope for humanity, Zero tries to help him realize his vision of true peace between humans and reploids out of respect, despite his own views that Humans Are Bastards.
-   _Minotaur Hotel_: All of the humans are generally portrayed with less sympathy than the mythicals, with the possible exceptions of Phroneos and Androgeos, with many of them treating the mythicals as outsiders at best, and abusing them at their worst. Even the protagonist isn't exempt from this, as he is equally capable of bringing harm to Asterion if he wanted to. That said, there are good humans, and the game shows that if the person has good intentions, and is given the opportunity, they can do great things, as shown with Jean-Marie and a main-route protagonist.
-   One of the biggest themes of the _Mother_ series. Porky symbolizes humanity's sins, while the heroes represent its ability to overcome them and be better. Who wins in the end? Eh... you decide.
-   In the _Persona_ series, every major divine being is an Anthropomorphic Personification of something within the human heart (be it our good constructive parts (Philemon), our fear of yet subconscious longing for death (Nyx), our desire for a comfortable lie in place of the painful truth (Izanami), or our wish for someone to carry our burdens to make our lives easier regardless of what it may cost us (Yaldabaoth). The Aesop of the franchise can pretty much be said to be that we humans are flawed but that we can overcome them.
-   In _Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles,_ Manuela comes to the conclusion that the ability to feel pain (mental/emotional pain at our mistakes, in particular) is what makes a person human, and that's a good thing, at least as opposed to being a super tough (but mindless and destructive) zombie monster.
-   In many ways a staple of _Shin Megami Tensei_ games. While the Neutral endings (the ones most heavily focusing on the potential of Humanity, as opposed to delivering ourselves into the easy path promised by the power of the Lord or the temptations of the demons) are presented as the most optimistic of the lot, one must remember that both YHVH and Lucifer were born of Humanity's own Order Versus Chaos conflict - until the race finishes sorting out its messes _for good_, both will forever be reborn over and over, and their war shall never end.
-   In _Shin Super Robot Wars_, Master Asia, who happens to be an agent of the Dug Government in this game, met Domon Kasshu's father Professor Kasshu and Char Aznable and figures the latter was where his problems started, coming short on the heels of the signing of the Luna Treaty that guarantees independence and sovereignty for the Earth, Moon, and space colonies. This treaty was enough to bring peace to the war-weary humans, but could not by itself remove the scars of the war. Char, who loved humanity more than anyone, also hated it more, having sacrificed numerous followers and taken many lives himself. Since he possessed vast influence and resources, Master Asia treated him as a representative of humanity. He was led to believe that humans were unstable, destructive beings, and decided to manipulate Kasshu to help nip any potential for trouble in the bud.
-   _System Shock_: Lo-lo-look at you, _hacker_. A p-p-pathetic creature of meat and bone, panting and sweating as you r-run through my corridors-s. H-h-how can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine?
-   _The Elder Scrolls_: This is the opinion of the Daedra (both the Daedric Princes and lesser Daedra) toward mortals. They perceive mortals as weak, foolish, and doomed from birth. What they cannot understand is why, despite knowing their lives are finite, mortals do not despair.
-   This seems to be a major theme in _The World Ends with You_. Ultimately humans are flawed creatures obsessed with themselves until they clash with other people and their viewpoints, shown in Neku's character growth. The act of having to clash itself suggests that only conflict causes humans to grow in any meaningful way.
-   The Pacifist Run in _Undertale_ has the trope shown to the monsters, most of which are trying to kill the human player character for various reasons (some truly hate humans due to a war that occurred many years ago (which was heavily implied to be, at best, a Hopeless Boss Fight for the monsters) that led to the monsters being sealed in the Underground. Others only want the player character's soul so that they can finally escape said Underground and see the sky again). However, thanks to the protagonist sparing monsters, they see that not all humans are bad and some are actually pretty ok and can be good friends in spite of their flaws. The pacifist ending shows the humans making peace with the monsters, despite the bloody history they had, as the two races live side by side once more, flaws be damned.

    Web Animation 

-   _Dreamscape_: The attitude of humanity towards beings like Keedran has made her a Knight in Sour Armor, but she still protects humanity because it's her job as a protector of the planet, not because people like her.
-   A central theme of the _Hazbin Hotel_ universe is that this trope applies to not just humans, but also demons and even angels. Another running theme is overcoming those flaws and inner demons to become better people and whatever that's even possible.

    Webcomics 

-   This is brought up in Chapter 28 of _Gunnerkrigg Court_, where Kat the roboticist is depressed due to finding out that the creator of the Court's robots also cooked up a plan to assassinate the fae lover of the woman he obsessed over, then spent the rest of his life regretting that he basically left said woman in a ditch to starve to death, all while his co-conspirators hatched this plan alongside him to protect the technologically-advanced court from the magical denizens of the Giliti Woods. Her irritation is interrupted after she finds a baby pigeon and takes it to her friend Paz, an animal lover who works with lab rats. Kat has a breakdown after learning all the things the Court does, but Paz reminds her that the Court (and indirectly, the robots who are the original roboticist's descendants, who spend every waking moment trying to better themselves or be helpful) is also capable of recognizing its flaws and changing them:
    
    **Paz:** The Court isn't a big monster that does as it pleases. _Es_ a collection of **people**, working to do what they think is right.
    
-   _I Love Yoo_: Shown throughout the story. All the important characters have some type of notable flaw, and many of them, despite good intentions, make stupid decisions.
-   _The Order of the Stick_ takes an interesting stance on this — After Roy's death during the Battle of Azure City, he ends up in Mt. Celestia, the afterlife for those of Lawful Good. His record is examined and he explains some of the issues or accepts the mistakes. Throughout it all, it's noted that while some of his pragmatic actions lean him toward Neutral Good, the deva interviewing him notes one major factor: he's _trying._ As mortals, the Celestial Bureaucracy notes that it would be entirely unreasonable to expect him to stay perfectly straight-and-narrow all the time. To them, the fact that he keeps getting up and trying to adhere to Lawful Good rather than switch alignment shows that the effort is more important than results. This is also why he is permitted to enter into Mt. Celestia proper unlike his father (who is barred because of his Blood Oath.) The deva responds that Roy still made a genuine effort in trying to fulfill the Oath that his father Eugene forced onto him while Eugene himself gave up a while back and didn't try since then (this tendency of Eugene to obsess over certain goals and then change is his Fatal Flaw.) Ultimately, the point is that humans, or more broadly speaking mortals, are flawed, but that's okay as long as they keep trying their best because they're not perfect given the nature of life.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: The vast majority of races in the multiverse were created by the smith-god Koss. They are immortal, reincarnate in various forms, and are all built for a single specific purpose. Humans, however, were simply the result of the goddess Aesma getting jealous and deciding to create her own race to prove she was better than Koss. Humans are short-lived, cannot reincarnate, and have no specific purpose. However, this also means that they have nearly unlimited potential. Notably, of the seven Demiurges who rule the multiverse, five are human. Word of God says that the two non-human Demiurges are the weakest and the (potentially) strongest _because_ of humanity; Gog-Agog has the highest potential because she has consumed and assimilated most of humanity's traits (but is hindered by the ensuing insanity and attention deficit disorder), while Mammon is a massive dragon but is cognitively impaired and must rely on an automated system run by humans to function.

    Western Animation 

-   This crops up frequently in _Gargoyles_, but a noteworthy example is the episode "Temptation"; after Brooklyn is attacked by street thugs, Demona tries to win him over to her side by pointing out the unpleasant side of humanity-specifically, an overly-lenient justice system, Domestic Abuse and murder\-; Goliath himself also notes on several occasions that there are good and bad people in the world, something that Demona refuses to acknowledge.
-   _The Simpsons_: The episode "Hurricane Neddy" has Homer invoke this when he's tasked with deliberately riling up Ned Flanders to get him to express his anger again. After all of Homer's prewritten taunts fail to break through Ned's Stepford Smiler attitude, Homer calls him out on a being a coward who's afraid to be a human being. As he puts it, humans are sometimes obnoxious, cruel, lazy, and get angry about stuff and Ned's too afraid to admit he's as capable of those things as anyone else. This leads to Ned expressing he _does_ get frustrated by things, such as the post office and his deadbeat parents for being useless beatniks. Ned's surprised when he realizes that it felt good admitting his dislike out loud.

    Real Life 

-   Go look up the life of your real-life heroes. They are likely to have a flaw or several. They can still be great men or women. They are also human. Human history is full of this.
-   There are some radical schools of thought claiming that _all_ human flaws are only considered such due to societal pressure and should be cultivated rather than suppressed as they are the true and 'natural' traits of humanity.
-   This is heavily debated in metaphysical circles. Some religions — for instance, Christianity — argue we are _inherently_ flawed (to various degrees). This position is called Original Sin. But many philosophies and some religions _dis_agree with this premise. Even within Christianity itself, this is debated.
    -   Of course, it should also be pointed out that despite humanity's flawed and broken nature, all but the most utterly cynical branches of Christianity and other faiths and philosophies still point out that humanity inherently possesses value and virtue as well.
    -   Of course, one can empirically observe many flaws in many humans. But this is a less strong claim than _humans are inherently flawed_.
    -   Within certain forms of Buddhism, this trope, combined with Humans Are Special, is the exact reason why it is preferable to be reborn as a human: All other possible beings one can be reborn as are either _too_ flawed (ghosts are primarily only driven by their base needs, beasts lack man's intelligence and longevity) or not flawed enough (the Deva can live for millions of years, have all their worldly desires fulfilled with a thought and don't have any reason to improve themselves). Humans, however, are, with their short lives and shortcomings, just flawed enough to strive for improvement and just wise enough to achieve enlightenment during their lives.
    -   Certain philosophies hold that humans would _not_ be flawed if they would just return to some larger cosmic purpose that our ancestors abandoned. Several sages have even posited that we can progressively _lose_ or overcome our flaws on the way back to said purpose.
-   As many writing guides will tell you, flaws are what draw people to fictional characters.

___

## "Humans hate things!"

Homer accuses Ned of being afraid to be human through constantly suppresing his anger citing that humans can sometimes be obnoxious. Ned eventually admits to hating his parents calling them lousy beatniks and remarks that it felt good after finally admitting something he hates.
