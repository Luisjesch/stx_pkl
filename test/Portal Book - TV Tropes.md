_"This book is made to order, but it isn't to be read;  
When they open up this book, they're sucked inside instead!"_

We've all heard the metaphor that books are a gateway to other worlds. Sometimes, this stops being a metaphor and becomes the literal truth. A book is an ideal object to turn into a Cool Gate to a Magical Land. Portal Books usually come in one of three varieties:

1.  As a literary version of Trapped in TV Land: The characters rapidly move from book to book, with the shelf or the library functioning as the Portal Network, creating a chain of shout outs and parodies of well-known genres and/or famous works along the way. Most of the books visited will be The Theme Park Version of public domain classics.
2.  As a literary version of Portal Picture: One book functions as a portal into the world of the story told in its pages. You usually can't escape until you reach the end of the story. This one is far less likely to be a real book in "our world."
3.  As a literary version of Set Right What Once Went Wrong or Wayback Trip: Characters get Applied Phlebotinum that allows them to enter the setting of one or more previously completely mundane, non-magical books. The conflict often centers on how their interference threatens to screw up the plot, and they have to get the original story back on track to resolve the "right" way.

Any of these three may or may not overlap with Refugee from TV Land, when literary characters come through a Portal Book into "the real world." The best candidates for such reverse travel are villains.

Chances are 10 to 1 that there will be An Aesop about the value of reading. Nobody is more likely to fall into a Portal Book than someone who dislikes books. A Bookworm's best hope of getting to experience this trope is if the Aesop is "Be Careful What You Wish For," and he must learn to stop withdrawing into the fantasy world of his books and "live in the real world." (Of course, _either_ lesson runs the risk of being a Space Whale Aesop, given that books in the real world don't work like this.)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

For help finding a Portal Book near you, see your local Magic Librarian. Compare Portal Door, for doors that lead someplace non-adjacent, and Television Portal for the higher-tech version. If the book triggers the plot then it's a Plot-Triggering Book.

Not to be confused for the behind-the-scenes digital book of _Portal 2_.

    Comic Books

    Web Original 

-   The Book in _The Book of Stories OCT_.

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_ episode "Flush After Reading" shows Roger has the ability to enter books, which he reveals to help Francine evade Stan at the library. Their actions in a book retroactively rewrites it in reality, their misadventures in Pride and Prejudice turning it into a a story about diarrhea, which carries over to any depiction of them in other books. The problem comes in because Roger never learned how to leave, trapping them in books a pyromaniac librarian is beginning to burn. They work out an escape by having Francine put into instructions on how to make a pipe bomb in one of Stan's self-published books, making it entirely unpublishable and erasing it from under them, dropping them back into reality.
-   The _Animaniacs_ episode "Video Review" is an updated homage to the _Looney Tunes_ shorts below, particularly "Book Revue", applying the same concept to a rental store full of videocassettes.
-   An episode of _The Fairly OddParents!_ called "Shelf Life", where anyone in the books can use the fairies' wands to rewrite words and change the book with them. This causes the interesting complication that altering anything in non-fiction books will alter whatever it's referencing in the real world, which the protagonists have to work to prevent when a disgruntled Tom Sawyer cons Cosmo out of his wand and seeks to escape to other books.
-   In the _Futurama_ episode "The Day the Earth Stood Stupid," the Chief Giant Brain trapped Fry and Leela's minds into such books as _Tom Sawyer_, _Moby-Dick_, and _Pride and Prejudice_. Fry finally defeats it by trapping his mind in a book of his own writing, "a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors."
    
    The Big Brain am winning again! I am the greetest! Mwa-ha-ha-ha! I will now leave Earth for no raisin!

-   _Fushigi Yuugi_ - Miaka and Yui fall into the Book of the Four Gods, and their adventures can be read by anyone who picks up the book in the real world.
    
    This is the story of a girl who gathered the seven seishi of Suzaku, and acquired the power to make every wish come true. The story itself is an incantation. Whoever finishes the book shall receive this power. As soon as the page is turned, the story will become truth and begin...
    
-   This trope is what kicks off the events of _The Rising of the Shield Hero_ by transporting Naofumi to Melromarc when he opens a book about the four cardinal heroes. The other heroes come to the country by slightly different means though.
-   In _Soul Eater_, Noah/ Fake Eibon enjoys doing this.
-   _Tamagotchi: Happiest Story in the Universe!_ has Mametchi and his friends travelling into books for fun. Then, Kikitchi travels into a book called "The World's Happiest Story", where his actions come close to affecting the real world; Mametchi and the others go in to get him out and save Tamagotchi Planet as well as the world in "The World's Happiest Story".

    Comic Books 

-   _Douwe Dabbert_, in the album _The Ship of Ice_, Douwe and Domoli enter a book so they can watch the story play out in front of them. However, they are merely there as spectators, and as such cannot interfere with the events in ways that would alter the course of the story.
-   _Monica's Gang_: In the story "Fables", Franklin's dog, Blue, disdains the book of La Fontaine's Fables his owner was reading, arguing that his own solo stories also have Talking Animals and it's just humans who can't understand them.

He loses a bet after betting on the hare from "The Hare and the Tortoise", gets chased by the wolf from "The Wolf and the Lamb", gets tricked by the fox from "The Fox and the Goat" and in return tricks her into tasting castor beans in "The Fox and the Grapes", until he finally returns home.
-   In _Oz (Caliber)_, Peter, Kevin and Mary (and their dog Max) are sucked into the Land of Oz by a tornado that emerges from a strange book they find in an old trunk Kevin bought for $50.

    Fan Works 

-   Played quite literally in _Sonic Generations: Friendship Is Timeless_ , although in a bit of a subversion, the Daring Do book leads to the Lost World.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Beauty and the Beast (2017)_ has a variation that ties into its Adaptation Expansion: The Enchantress left one of these behind for the Beast on top of his magic mirror and enchanted rose. What does it do? It allows the user to travel anywhere they wish in the world. Belle and the Beast use it to visit her childhood home in Paris, and the sad backstory of her Missing Mom is revealed in the process. See also Literature below.
-   The pirate movie _Magic Island_ has a boy named Jack get sucked into his book. He ends up saving a mermaid and some treasure from Blackbeard the pirate.

    Literature 

-   There's a kids' series called _Alice in Bibleland_ that centers on this premise.
-   The _Angel_ novel _Book of the Dead_ had a variant of type two, where Wesley was sucked into a book and trapped in its pages-he to help the other trapped people and defeat the people-eating worm demon hunting everyone before he could escape.
-   The _Beauty and the Beast (2017)_ Expanded Universe novel _Lost in a Book_ has Bookworm Belle, during her stay in the Beast's castle, discover a magical book (_Nevermore_) in the vast library. And she can enter and leave its Magical Land freely..._at first_. An unusual example in that Belle's "real world" is already quite magical.
-   _The Inkworld Trilogy_
-   _The Land Of Stories: The Wishing Spell_ (and presumably the other books in the LOS series) by Chris Colfer focus on two kids who enter a magical land through a book.
-   The various books in _Magic Tree House_ seem to work this way. It's unclear whether they actually send the protagonists inside the book's setting or transport them directly to the historical era depicted in the book. The former seems more likely, however, since Jack and Annie also use the books (especially later on in the series) to travel to fantasy worlds.
-   _The Neverending Story_

    Live-Action TV 

-   Done twice on _Are You Afraid of the Dark?_:
    -   A microwave oven turns a comic book into a Portal Book in "The Tale of the Ghastly Grinner." It ends with the hero going inside said comic book to stop the Emotion Eater villain that had escaped earlier in the episode.
    -   A video game junkie learns how (dangerously) exciting reading can be in "The Tale of the Bookish Baby-sitter."
-   Done in the _Charmed_ episode "Charmed Noir," where Paige and Kyle get trapped in a book written by two of the Magic School's students. Important to the drama of the plot, because the world of the book technically isn't inside the school, it bypasses the enchantment on school grounds that prevents anyone from dying. This makes a mystery when bodies start showing up.
-   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_: Rita and Zed trap three of the Rangers in Kimberly's favorite childhood book. When that plan backfires, they turn the book's villain into the Monster of the Week.
-   El Exprimidor de Libros (The Book Squeezer) in _Odisea Burbujas_, a device that allows the main characters to travel inside books, often use to teach kids about literature, as the show is educational.
-   Done with Alex's diary in an episode of _Wizards of Waverly Place_.

    Music Videos 

-   In the music video for A Ha's "Take on Me", the (handsome) lead singer who is in a comic book, invites a (very cute) woman who is reading it to join him. She does, and becomes a black-and-white drawn character. When he stands behind a mirror, on one side he (and her) are three dimensional, in color, but on the other side, they're line-drawn black and white. When some mooks start chasing them, he runs and pulls her along, then pushes her back out to the real world. Then later, she returns the favor and invites him out of the comic and into her world. The official video is here.

    Pinballs 

-   In _Tales of the Arabian Nights_, the _Arabian Nights_ serves as one of these; the player must enter seven of the Tales and retrieve a magic jewel from each one in order to confront the evil genie of the game.

    Tabletop Games 

-   An old _Dungeons & Dragons_ monster is the Palimpsest, a sheet of rune-inscribed parchment that has become a carnivorous predator. If it senses prey that has mistaken it for something benign, the Palimpsest absorbs the reader into its page, after which an illumination of the frantic victim appears alongside the normal text or sigils on the parchment. After a few days the unlucky victim will be "digested" completely and vanish from the paper, at which point only a _wish_ spell can revive them, though before that point a specific sequence of spells - _remove curse_, _abjure_, and _resurrection_ - will animate the illustrated victim, remove them from the Palimpsest as a colorless, lifeless paper doll, and then restore them to normal. Alternatively, lightning magic like _shocking grasp_ has a chance of making a Palimpsest regurgitate someone from its page, at the risk of also zapping the victim.

    Theatre 

-   The Z book in the Cirque du Soleil show _ZED_ initially drew its two clowns into another world when they jumped into the book. They come back out at the end, but the denizens of the other world seemed to have followed them and have no desire to go back, despite needful protests from the clowns.

    Video Games 

-   _Curse Crackers: For Whom The Belle Toils_ has the Cursed Book, a series of not 5 but _10_ particularly difficult levels that Belle has to go through after getting trapped inside a book, without Chime to help her. There doesn't seem to be a story going on, though; instead the book seems to function as an alternate dimension.
-   The plot of _Disney's Magical Quest 3_, as well as _Mickey's Ultimate Challenge_. In the former, Huey, Dewey and Louie are sucked into Storybook World by the evil "King Pete" after they open an old book in the attic and Donald (or Mickey) has to enter the book in order to get them out. In the latter, Mickey (or Minnie) falls asleep while reading a book of fairytales and ends up within the book's world, and must find the source of the kingdom's problems while finding a way home.
-   This is the plot of _Doki Doki Panic_, the game of which _Super Mario Bros. 2_ is a Dolled-Up Installment.
-   _Dress Up! Time Princess_ transports the player character into a role within the storybook she reads, obliging her to live through the story and try to reach a happy ending through her choices. The "Queen Marie" book, which is the first story available, dips into Type 3 since it's the story of Marie Antoinette, whose historical fate is something the player character would very much like to avoid.
-   _Final Fantasy Tactics Advance_: This is literally the plotline of the game.
-   The plot of the edutainment game _I. M. Meen_ involves an evil wizard sucking "bookworm" kids into his magic labyrinth with a magic book.
    
    This book is made to order, but it isn't to be read  
    When they open up this book, they're sucked inside instead
    
-   In _Final Fantasy Fables Chocobo Tales_ the demon book Bebuzzu transforms a storybook into one of these.
-   The main plot of _Puyo Puyo Chronicle_ consists of Arle and Carbuncle (as well as several other characters) getting sucked into a book leading into another world where they're the prophesied "Great Hero" who will bring love to everyone. Then it's revealed that Satan arranged for the whole thing so that he could live out his fantasy of Arle rescuing him as well as being the Final Boss of her journey. Suffice to say, Arle was not impressed to say the least. Then the whole story gets thrown Off the Rails, first when Satan leaves the Colour Tower early to face Arle and Co., and second when Ally's pendant (that she got from Ecolo) ends up creating an Evil Twin bent on destroying everything...
-   The titular book of _Rakenzarn Tales_, which is used to transport Kyros and Kyuu into the world of Rakenzarn to start the game proper.
-   _Super Lucky's Tale_: The book of Ages which Lucky is trapped and also springs the plot of the game. And managed to connect the worlds and reuniting with fellow Guardians.

Anyone who enters the room will enter a random location in the book's setting. Any actions the explorer takes will be reflected in the book after they leave it.

    Western Animation 

-   The _Challenge of the Super Friends_ cartoon in 1978 had episode 13, "Fairy Tale Of Doom", where the Toyman develops a device that can project anyone into the pages of a storybook. He forces Hawkman to chase him into Jack and the Beanstalk, Cheetah forces Wonder Woman to chase her into Alice in Wonderland and Brainiac forces Superman to chase him into Gulliver's Travels and the three villains trap the three Super Friends in the three treacherous fairy tales. The other Super Friends must rescue the trapped heroes before the clock runs out and the books vanish forever.
-   Certain episodes of _Dora the Explorer_ where Dora and Boots are shown reading a story at the beginning has them jump into the book to start the adventure. One episode does a variation where they jump into a video game, and "Dora Saves the Crystal Kingdom" combines this with Type 1 when Dora, Boots, and Allie have to travel from story to story to find the missing crystals.
-   The _Garbage Pail Kids Cartoon_ episode "A Rhyme in Time" had the Garbage Pail Kids enter a world of nursery rhymes through a book after noticing that Jack and Jill are missing from the illustration of their nursery rhyme and decide to enter the book to investigate.
-   Most episodes of _Gumby_ involve this.
-   Adventures of the Week on _Muppet Babies_ frequently took the kids into books, including _Around the World in Eighty Days_, _Peter Pan_, "The Pied Piper of Hamelin", and numerous Fairy Tales. Interestingly, the episode specifically about books and libraries _didn't_ use this but rather put the kids in the setting of _Labyrinth_ searching for Piggy's lost _Alice in Wonderland_ book.
-   The _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "Power Ponies" has Spike and the Mane Six learn the hard way that this kind of book is apparently a freely available specialized comic book retail item when they are sucked into it and have to play out its roleplaying game scenario in order to leave.

-   _The Incredible Umbrella_ and its sequel _The Amorous Umbrella_ by Marvin Kaye.
-   In Woody Allen's "The Kugelmass Episode" Persky the Great invented a cabinet that can transport the occupant into whatever book is placed inside when he taps on the door three times.

-   To link books together in _Myst_, the world has to be described in its pages (in an archaic, chinese-like form of D'ni), but once completed, the books on the shelf act similar to a Portal Network.
    -   The whole premise of the _Myst_ game is this trope. Initially type 2 but with the return averted. The main story/adventure is slowly revealed by the puzzles you solve and this part is more like a type 1.
-   In the _Nevertales_ series Travelers can use any book as a portal into another world.
