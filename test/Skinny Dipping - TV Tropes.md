"_You shed the city and lots of other things during the drive. By the time I see that water, I'm good._"

— **Newsanchor Wendy Rieger** on skinny dipping in the Chesapeake Bay

Skinny Dipping is swimming, but without the swimsuit. In the nude.

Usually, this is used in fiction for several reasons:

-   Fanservice, of course. Because nothing turns people on more than water! Sometimes it's a way to get away with a nude scene without being too erotic.
-   Naked People Are Funny and Gone Swimming, Clothes Stolen, the latter of which is a sub-trope of this. Together, they can make a humorous situation.
-   Sometimes a common element in Slasher Movies, where a female skinny dipper is usually killed by the murderer.
-   Samus Is a Girl. A great way to reveal her secret, right?
-   To be Truth in Television.

As mentioned above, Skinny Dipping is Truth in Television. It was a common practice back before the 1950s or so, when swimsuits were impractical. It is still done today, though. As a matter of fact, some nudist camps which are otherwise clothing-optional make their pools no-clothing. (It's a little known fact that suit fibers just mean something extra to clean out of the filter system.) However, skinny dipping in public places other than nudist areas can be illegal and bring charges of public indecency or even second degree sexual assault.

Related to Naked People Are Funny. Often the prelude to a Two-Person Pool Party, a Sexy Surfacing Shot, an Outdoor Bath Peeping, Naked People Trapped Outside and A Party, Also Known as an Orgy. Super-Trope to Gone Swimming, Clothes Stolen. Contrast Non-Nude Bathing. For anime, see also Furo Scene and Hot Springs Episode (which is not _always_ naked, only _often_). Compare Waterfall Shower, which can overlap or be a prelude to this at times, and Slippery Swimsuit, where the swimmer started off clothed but wound up naked anyway.

    Jokes 

-   An elderly man in Florida had owned a large farm for years. He had a large pond in the back, fixed up nice; picnic tables, horseshoe courts, and some orange and peach trees. The pond was ideal for swimming, although he rarely did that anymore. One evening he decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it over. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket with which to bring back some fruit. As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond. He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. One of the women shouted to him, "We're not coming out until you leave!" The old man frowned, "I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or to make you get out of the pond naked..." holding the bucket up he said, "...I'm here to feed the alligator."
-   "Why do elephants have trunks? Because they're too shy to swim naked."

The scenes are kept pretty faithfully in the film adaptation _Standing Up_.
