_"Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."_

When a writer tells a story, it usually involves some sort of significant change in the universe of the story, some kind of conflict which finds a resolution. After all, if there's no conflict, there's no story! We like reading about evil emperors getting overthrown and seeing their 100-year reign of oppression come to an end; reading about a peaceful nation with a peaceful king and citizens who are smart enough never to get into any trouble would be just as fun as watching paint dry.

But the story has to end somewhere, usually soon after the big climax and resolution. Thus, we are left to imagine how the world and its characters will live on after the story is over. The end of the story is the beginning of a new era.

For some reason, writers just _love_ to point out this fact wherever possible. Expect a lot of them to mention "the beginning" with some sort of heavy significance.

Oh, and to make it even better—by the same token—sometimes the beginning of the story is referred to as "the end". It can get quite confusing.

See also: My Death Is Just the Beginning and It Has Only Just Begun. If the story undergoes this kind of shakeup and _doesn't_ end there, it's Nothing Is the Same Anymore. Bears only a passing relation to the B-Movie _Beginning of the End_. When it really is the end, see The End.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Alien Nine's_ final anime episode was literally titled this trope, and it makes sense considering that, despite the series coming to a close, it reveals little pieces of what could be a possible intergalactic conspiracy.
-   In _Arachnid_, Alice spent most of the story stuck on a Carnival of Killers inside her school. Even after the Big Bad is killed, Japan is cast into a rape-powered Zombie Apocalypse of all things and Alice starts aimlessly fighting them while chasing The Syndicate. The last pages are her monologuing that "the "Arachnid Hunt" isn't over" and that to survive she has no choice but to keep killing.
-   Chapter 5 of _Himenospia_ is named "End" and features a squad of policemen exterminating a school's student body to get at the misguided wasp-mutant protagonist, who is then driven to take over her town with brainwashing powers to survive. Chapter 35 in turn is named "Beginning" and starts to reveal that Himeno had been manipulated by her former bully and right-hand Nagisa, who was a fellow Queen the whole time.
-   The final episode of _Noein_, in which Haruka and Yuu defeat the titular Noein and reclaim their right to a future without his influence, is titled "The Beginning."
-   At the end of _Princess Tutu_, the series narrator states that Fakir is writing "a new story full of hope." (However, the title card shown right after this says "the end".)
-   This trope is invoked in _Macross: Do You Remember Love?_. At the end of the film, Britai and Exsedol are discussing the fact that they won out over two massive Zentradi and Meltrandi fleets, but that there are still 1,000 fleets of Boddol Zer and Lap Lamiz's type roaming the galaxy. Britai calmly states that with them and the humans in possession of culture, things will turn out all right.
-   _The Lucifer and Biscuit Hammer_ doesn't _truly_ begin until Hangetsu Shinonome is killed by the third Golem. Since he was a major reason why the protagonists began to improve their fighting skills and became someone that they were glad to call an ally, his death was considered to be the equivalent of the curtains falling on the prologue of their story.

    Audio Play 

-   The Grand Finale of _We're Alive_ uses a Distant Finale to show the world 14 years after a Zombie Apocalypse that is beginning to rebuild society while still dealing with the zombie threat. It also features Saul and Lizzy's now 14-year-old son, Nicolas, taking his first full steps into that world by choosing to become a guardian.

    Comic Books 

-   At the end of Chapter 8 of _The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck_, Scrooge was busy shooing off intruders of White Agony Creek, when his arm suddenly gives way from the weight of a big rock he is lifting.
    
    **Scrooge's thoughts:** Great honk, this rock is _heavy!_ how could it weigh so much unless...  
    **Scrooge:** ...Unless it's _gold!_ Gotta rinse off the mud! A nugget this _big_ would make me the richest man in the Klondike!  
    **Scrooge's thoughts:** But if it _is_ gold, that will mean my quest is finished! I'll be _rich!_ I'll never be the same again! Will clean air smell any sweeter? Will sunny days be ever brighter? Will starry nights hold any more wonder? Or will I _lose_ all that? Do I _really_ want to be... _rich?_  
    _(Beat Panel...)_  
    _(he gains a glint in his eyes...)_  
    **Scrooge: YES!!!**  
    _(he rinses off the mud; the rock is indeed a huge nugget of gold.)_  
    **Scrooge:** It's _gold! Solid_ gold! As big as a _goose egg!_ Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! _I'm_ _**RICH!**_  
    _(zoom out on as the last word echoes throughout the creek as Scrooge skips about in excitement)_  
    **Narration Box:** The Beginning...
    
-   Marvel enjoys using "The Beginning!" whenever they can.
    -   Examples include the _Season One_ graphic novels, and the story in _Marvel: NOW What?!_ detailing how Doctor Octopuppet decided to become the villainous... Doctor Octopus! \*gasp\*
    -   The _Killraven (2002)_ miniseries ends with the cast gathered around a campfire, their foes defeated.
        
        **Volcana:** Now that we are free, what do we do next?  
        **Carmilla:** The same thing we always have done.  
        **M'Shulla:** The only thing anyone can ever do.  
        **Killraven:** Right, we _live!_ We live for another day.  
        **Caption box:** _The Beginning._
        
-   _Watchmen_: "Nothing _ends_, Adrian. Nothing ever ends."

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Star Trek: Voyager_ Parody Fic "The Killer Dame", the EMH disguises himself as Winston Churchill while in a WW2 holodeck program, and this quote becomes an Overly Long Gag.
    
    "Now this is not the end. It is not even, the beginning of the end. It is not even the end of the beginning of the end of the end. But it is perhaps, the end of the middle of the bit that comes after the end. Or perhaps the start of the end of the beginning of the middle of the end..."
    

    Films — Animation 

-   At the end of _Anastasia_: "It's a perfect ending!" "No. It's a perfect beginning."

    Films — Live Action 

-   Oliver Stone's _JFK_, ends with "What is past is prologue." The phrase is taken from William Shakespeare's The Tempest, and is engraved on the National Archives building in Washington, DC.
-   The sci-fi B-Movie _The Phantom Planet_ ends with the narrator stating that, as humanity continues to explore the cosmos, they'll discover even more amazing wonders. "This is only the beginning!" In the MST3K episode on this movie, Mike and Bots lament that this means they have to watch the movie over again.
-   Literally: At the end of the apocalyptic/time-travel sci-fi B-Movie _Millennium (1989)_ (not related to the eponymous TV series), a solemn voice-over proclaims: _"It is not the end! It is not the beginning of the end! It is the end of the beginning!"_ This is in reference to the Adam and Eve Plot ending.
-   The Affectionate Parody of sci-fi B-Movies _The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra_ has The End, then the credits continue rambling on in this fashion.
    
    THE END? OR IS IT? ISN'T IT MORE LIKE A KIND OF BEGINNING IN A WAY? LIKE A NEW BEGINNING? FOR EVERYONE? HM... I WONDER... OH WELL.
    
-   Jerry Lewis' _The Nutty Professor_ ends, after a fake ending, with the words "the beginning", when Professor Kelp and Stella finally get together.
-   _Star Trek: First Contact_ closes with the first meeting between humanity and the Vulcans, starting a brand new era in human history and marking the beginning of the Trek Verse.
-   The ending of _The Dark Knight Rises_ (and _The Dark Knight Trilogy_, for that matter) has Bruce Wayne retiring as Batman and passing the mantle on to Robin John Blake. With the Bat-signal restored, it is implied Bruce thinks Gotham will still need a Batman.
-   The final line of _Attack of the Clones_ is, "Begun, the Clone War has", spoken by Master Yoda.
-   The British WW2 propaganda movie _The Way Ahead_ (1944) concludes with the soldiers advancing into the attack with the words THE BEGINNING. One assumes the producers wanted the audience to believe our heroes were just getting started in defeating the Nazis, as opposed to marching off to their END.
-   _Screamers: The Hunting_ ends with a shot of the Fetus Terrible sprouting a killing blade and a title card saying THE BEGINNING, implying that the events shown on Sirius 6B will now take place on Earth.
-   Quoted verbatim near the end of _Kingsman: The Golden Circle_ along with the implication that Churchill was a founding Kingsman.

    Literature 

-   The final book in the _Animorphs_ series was titled "The Beginning." The story concerns the end of the Yeerk war on Earth, and the beginning of a new war against an unknown enemy. Depending on how the reader interprets Jake's final order, the series could end on a cliffhanger, a Bolivian Army Ending, or the start of a new and exciting journey.
-   The first chapter of the first book of _The First Law_ trilogy is titled _The End_. The final chapter of the last book is titled _The Beginning_.
-   The final chapter of _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ was titled "The Beginning".
-   This was how _The Last Battle_ (last book of The Chronicles of Narnia) ended.
-   _Shadow Thieves_ by Anne Ursu, is in four parts: "We begin in the middle", "Now the beginning", "The end of the beginning" and "The beginning of the end."
-   The _Star Trek Expanded Universe_ novel _Imzadi_ commences with a page reading "The End," then goes through "The End of the Beginning," "Epilogue," "The Beginning," "The Middle," and finally "The Beginning of the End." This comes of a story with a nonlinear narrative that also involves time travel.
-   The final chapter of the third book in the _The Han Solo Trilogy_ features Han sitting in a cantina on some backwater planet and worrying about their financial debt to a crime lord. Chewie walks over to his table and tells him that he may have found the solution to their problems in an old man and a kid who need passage to Alderaan. Where most books say "The End," it says "The Beginning."
-   At the end of the first Dark Tower novel, the Man in Black tells Roland "You haven't reached the end of your quest, merely the end of the beginning."
-   The first chapter of _The Extraordinary Education of Nicholas Benedict_ is titled "A Beginning at the End." The last chapter is "An End at the Beginning."

    Live Action TV 

-   The final episode of _Bizaardvark_ is aptly titled "The End of the Beginning". Specifically Vuuugle has been sold, Frankie, Paige and all their friends have to go their separate ways, and it doesn't matter where they are as long as they keep making videos with each other.
-   In _Doctor Who_, starting with the Third Doctor's final serial "Planet of the Spiders" most outgoing Doctors get a Grand Finale storyline. They usually face a threat greater than any they've previously come up against, often end up making a Heroic Sacrifice, and always have a denouement that treats their "death" and regeneration into their next incarnation as this trope. The revival series gives them a Final Speech as well and takes the trouble to tie up _some_ loose ends of their Myth Arc. (The exceptions are Six, Seven, Eight, and War: Six and Seven meet their demises at the _start_ of stories that are really about the new guys, Eight's regeneration is depicted in a short prologue to "The Day of the Doctor" and reveals it to have been under far more bitter circumstances than usual, and the special case of the War Doctor means his regeneration is only briefly seen as just one part of "Day"'s much larger story.)
-   The first part of the Grand Finale of _Henry Danger_ is called "The Beginning of the End", fitting as it's the beginning of the end of the show. It's also the episode which Henry realizes he can't be a sidekick forever after finding out he's not graduating because of all his missions as Kid Danger, and is called by another town to be _their_ superhero.
-   The first episode of _Lost_'s fourth season is entitled "The Beginning of the End". Fitting as it was the first season to premiere after the announcement of the show's 2010 end date.
-   The pilot of _Red Dwarf_ said "The End" at the beginning of the episode and "The Beginning" at the end of the episode. This is because it's the end of everyone on Red Dwarf (except for Sole Survivor Lister) that causes the setup for the rest of the series.
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise_ ends with a Distant Finale in which the Enterprise is decommissioned. But the point is made that Archer and his brave crews exploits laid the foundations for the Starfleet (and later ships called _Enterprise_) to "boldly go where no man has gone before..."

    Music 

-   The final song on Forgive Durden's album _Razia's Shadow_ is titled, "The End and the Beginning" in this fashion.

-   Mentioned in "Closing Time" by Semisonic: "Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end."

    Newspaper Comics 

-   The Newspaper Comic _Flash Gordon_ kept going for _decades_ after Ming the Merciless was overthrown, while the characters continued finding new and mostly non-Ming-related adventures to have.

    Video Games 

-   End of the Beginning is level 1-10 of the Impetus area of _BIT.TRIP RUNNER_, which signals the end of the tutorial levels. This is mirrored by Middle of the Middle and Beginning of the end in Tenacity and Triumph respectively.
-   This is word-for-word the title of the first BF in the C path of _Blaze Union_.
-   "This isn't the end. Another dream is waiting to begin."
    -   Which interestingly, it's similar to the quote Firion says at the end of Final Fantasy II
-   All of the _Mass Effect_ games do this:
    -   _Mass Effect_: Sovereign is just the vanguard of the coming galactic invasion. Shepard, after being hailed as a hero by the powers that be, vows to find a way to stop the invasion and walks off, continuing his/her quest.
    -   _Mass Effect 2_: The Collectors are defeated and the Reaper plot thwarted for now, but the Reapers are descending upon the galaxy—the battle is not over yet.
    -   _Mass Effect 3_: The Reapers are defeated, but at great cost to the galaxy. However, Shepard's actions through the third game set the stage for the futures of all of the races and characters.
-   Subverted in _The Reconstruction_. By the end of the story, the world is almost completely annihilated and has to be rebuilt practically from scratch — it is _definitely_ the beginning of a new era. However, it's never actually said anywhere that it's a new beginning — even the phrase "reconstruction" is never mentioned.
-   In _Resident Evil 2_'s ending, the main characters exchange this dialog:
    
    **Leon:** "It's finally over."
    
    **Claire:** "It's not. I've got to my brother."
    
    **Leon:** "You're right... _this_ is just the beginning."
    
-   The _Gears of War_ Trilogy has invoked this, They defeated the Locust and the Equally as destructive Lambent Locust. However it's made clear that they are still far off from a happy ending. But for now they have earned their "Tomorrow".
-   _Star Wars: Battlefront II_ has this occur with the final two missions on the Republic campaign, with the Utapau mission being the final mission where you fight the Separatists as the Clone Army while the following mission on Coruscant is the last Republic mission period with the Clones executing Order 66 and attacking the Jedi Temple.

    Visual Novels 

-   In the "Blooming" ending of Saya no Uta, where Fuminori narrates how Saya dies in his arms, as she releases spores that will mutate every human into beings of her species:
    
    "......Is this goodbye?" I ask her, careful to keep the sorrow out of my voice.
    
    "——No, it isn't. This is——the beginning——"
    
    Saya's pain must have already left her, for her expression is infinitely peaceful and content.
    
    "The beginning——of our world——"
    

    Web Original 

-   After the Deathly Hallows title was released, the following episode of Muggle Cast was called "The Beginning Of The End". When they got the release date, Andrew states that it was "the end of the beginning of the end".
-   The final panel of _The Order of the Stick_ prequel book _On the Origins of PCs_ simply says, "The Beginning."

    Western Animation 

-   The final season opener of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ is called "The Beginning of the End". Note that this is a Double-Meaning Title; not only does it mark the beginning of the end of the era of the Royal Sisters, before Twilight becomes their successor at the end of the series, it's the beginning of the end of the show all together. It does it again in the first part of its Grand Finale, which is titled "The _Ending_ of the End".

    Real Life 

-   What Churchill is referring to in the above quote is that the worst part of World War II appeared to be over at that point; the threat of invasion of the UK by Germany was over, the United States entered the war full bore and a powerful alliance of those nations with the Soviet Union was established to give the Axis what for.
-   Apollo 17 astronaut Gene Cernan frequently invoked this phrase motivationally during training for the final moon landing mission, believing that it should not be thought of as the end of the moon program, but just the "end of the beginning" of such exploration. Technicians would frequently tease him about this ("Hey, Geno, I keep forgetting — is this the end or the beginning?"), and the phrase was humorously inserted (along with variations and subversions) at strategic points into the checklists Cernan would use on the lunar surface.
