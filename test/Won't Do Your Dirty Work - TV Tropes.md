_I'm a fool to do your dirty work  
Oh yeah  
I don't wanna do your dirty work  
No more_

For when you're tired of Just Following Orders.

There are lines many of us won't cross, whether it's being told to shoot an unarmed victim, assault a woman, cheat to win, or be an unfaithful spouses bit on the side, attack some kids, help someone die, terrorize old people, and so on. If enough trauma and bad blood builds up between asker and asked, no matter how much invective or vitriol is used, the latter simply won't take that final leap. Rather, the underling gets tough and says: "You know what? If you want it that bad, do it yourself."

Not necessarily restricted to more heinous actions. Being asked or forced to cater to someone's whims for an extended period of time for no good reason can invoke this trope as well, depending on how grating the person is. Once the last straw is placed, it can be the fuse-lighting event for a glorious comeuppance where the haughty and overbearing are made to live by their own rules, and much enjoyment is had by everyone else.

Goes well with rants of all shapes and sizes. Saying "That's an Order!" may no longer work after this trope is invoked. May lead whoever was asked to do the dirty work to Resign in Protest or otherwise say Screw This, I'm Outta Here. Might also be the cause of a Mook–Face Turn.

Compare with They're Called "Personal Issues" for a Reason, which can justify this response, Bad Guys Do the Dirty Work, when someone villainous does the deeds because the hero won't stoop to that level, Not What I Signed on For, where the underling is pushed to a line they won't cross, and This Is Something He's Got to Do Himself, a more positive variant. See also Dirty Business, when the acts themselves are the main focus, and Villain No Longer Idle, when the bad guy gets the message and acts accordingly.

Contrast Spare Them The Dirty Work when someone takes it upon themselves to do the dirty work so that someone else won't have to.

She winds up being taken captive aboard Marco's ship, and after she manages to thwart one of Marco's plans, he orders her Thrown Out the Airlock. The problem is that Marco gives that order to Filip and Cyn, (who is Marco's Token Good Teammate and regards Naomi as practically like his daughter) who at first are so dumbfounded they can't even really respond, and when Marco repeats the order, Cyn furiously refuses, an extreme rarity since Cyn regards Marco as a visionary and generally goes along with Marco's orders even when he doesn't like or understand them.
    
    **Marco:** Space her.  
    **Cyn:** _\[stares at Marco in disbelief\]_ What?  
    **Marco:** You heard me. We treated her with respect. And she betrayed us, gave aid to our enemies, _tried to take my life!_  
    **Cyn:** I know, but... it's _Naomi_.  
    **Marco:** You will do what I tell you to!  
    **Cyn:** DO IT YOURSELF! If it has to be done, _you_ can do it. I'm not going to let Filip be part of this. Unless you think you can make me, hmm? Maybe I finally got old enough, huh?

Later, when the soldiers rise up and try to hold the Angosian leaders hostage, Nayrok pleads for Picard's help, but Picard points out "In your own words, this is not our affair.", and he leaves, having seen enough of Angosia's hypocrisy and respecting the soldiers' right to decide their future against their government.
