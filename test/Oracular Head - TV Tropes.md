A preserved head or skull that can speak on its own, usually to answer questions of a divinatory nature.

As a trope, it is at least Older Than Feudalism — it goes back to the Greek myth of Orpheus's singing head.

A common variation in medieval lore was the Brazen Head, which could answer any question and make oracular pronouncements. The Brazen Head crops up in the stories surrounding many medieval magicians, including Roger Bacon and Faust.

See also Losing Your Head and Brain in a Jar for other cases of living beheaded creatures. If it comes down to just being a skull, it starts to overlap with Dem Bones.

-   _Kingdom Come_: Deadman has a talking skull head.

-   _The Last Unicorn_: A skull tells the main characters how to find the Red Bull's lair. This was changed to an entire skeleton for the movie, probably to make for more interesting animation.
-   _The Magic Goes Away_: The necromancer Wavyhill has cast immortality spells on himself. However, that backfires when his body is hacked up and all that is left is his skull, which, due to his magic, he is trapped in and can talk.
-   _Magic, Inc._: An African sorcerer consults the Shrunken Head of his grandfather.
-   _The Master Of All Desires_: The titular character is one of these — it's a severed head in an ornate box that has the ability to see the future (making later historical references that mystify the other characters, it being set in the 16th century).

-   _Myth Adventures_: In _Myth Fortunes_, the living crystal ball of the Golden Hoard manifests as a female head of whatever species she's currently addressing, much like the Haunted Mansion example under 'Theme Parks'.

Their heads are removed upon death and placed in a preservative solution, along with small insectoids that latch on to the head's severed nerve endings, along with an air bladder to facilitate speech. The insectoids are able to stimulate the brain, inducing anything from pain to pleasure to an intense need to go to the bathroom, providing incentive to speak the truth to those who ask questions of the head. This happens to the protagonist's father and is how she forces him to finally disclose the secrets he's kept from her all his life. Tellingly, it's said that a former Emperor used to subject his ex-concubines to this and put them in his bedroom.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Dresden Files_: Bob is a human ghost who "lives" in a skull and comes out when Harry needs his to plumb his considerable arcane knowledge... or whenever he feels like it.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   Zordon, the franchise's original mentor figure. He's actually a humanoid being communicating from a pocket dimension Rita stuck him in, but we only ever see him outside his prison in the Non-Serial Movie. When he's released from the prison at the beginning of _Turbo_, he apparently _becomes_ the floating head for real. Unfortunately, this makes it easier for the bad guys to imprison him during _Space_.
    -   Zordon's pupil from _Megaforce_, Gosei, is this also but has taken the form of a Tiki head.
        -   Gosei's counterpart in _Tensou Sentai Goseiger_, Master Head, also resembles a Tiki.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Face of Boe, a billions-year old giant-head-in-a-jar. No one knows how he's lived so long - unless he really is Captain Jack Harkness - but he's had a very long time to gather knowledge and wisdom.
    -   Additionally, the head of Dorium technically fits this, although he doesn't exactly have much of the characterization (i.e., he has his head wired to surf the internet, and complains of boredom the instant you remove him from a wifi hot-spot).
    -   In "The Time of the Doctor," the Doctor has obtained the head of a Cyberman which he uses as a databank.
-   The _Night Gallery_ episode "Logoda's Heads" featured as its antagonist the witch doctor Logoda who had the power to make a bunch of Shrunken Heads tell him their secrets. British authorities accuse him of murdering an explorer but are unable to find enough evidence against him. A local young woman who knows that he is guilty takes matters into her own hands by revealing that she is an even more powerful witch doctor who can make the shrunken heads _kill_, after Logoda's body was torn apart off-screen. The episode ends with the camera zooming in on the heads and the traces of blood and flesh on their teeth...

    Myths & Religion 

-   Celtic Mythology: The Celtic god-hero Bran the Blessed, whose severed head continued to speak after his death and, according to one legend, is still buried under the Tower of London.
-   Greek Mythology: Orpheus lost his head to a ravening pack of Maenads, and continued to sing for a while afterwards.
-   Norse Mythology: Mimir was originally the guardian of the Well of Knowledge, and supposedly all-knowing - after he got himself decapitated, Odin had his head preserved with special herbs and rune-magic, to serve as his adviser. Unfortunately, he's a bit of a prick and makes Odin pull one of his own eyes out.

    Pinball 

-   _No Fear: Dangerous Sports_: Skull the Bone Head, though he's strictly for the snark.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Call of Cthulhu_ supplement _The Asylum and Other Tales_, adventure "The Auction". A magical Brass Head could animate and answer questions if it were covered with burning blood. It was a trap: it contained a Servitor of the Outer Gods which would try to trick the user into releasing it.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The _Planescape_ campaign setting features Mimir: 'Living' encyclopaedias that take the form of floating, animate skulls and recite any knowledge they contain on demand. Mimirs are magical constructs and typically not sentient in and by themselves (this varies depending on the creator and the Mimir's intended use, however, and sentient Mimir do exist).
    -   The bugbear deity Hruggek sends omens to his followers via this trope, and is known to keep a large collection of severed heads that plead endlessly for mercy. Rumor has it that each head can also mentally influence members of its original race via _suggestion_, or utter _power word_ spells, if Hruggek commands it.
    -   A demilich is a lich that has grown so powerful and ancient, and spent so much time mentally exploring other worlds rather than within its body, that its remains have dwindled and decayed to nothing but a skull. Which _eats souls_.
    -   One type of druj, a powerful class of undead creatures from CD&D, takes the form of a skull.
-   _GURPS: Fantasy_ features the mythological Orpheus, who still has access to powerful magic.
-   _Hunter: The Vigil_ gives us the Aegis Kai Doru and their most prized possession, the living head of John the Baptist. It's implied in some places that the Aegis Kai Doru went through a period of decapitating _any_ prophet they heard of in hopes of adding more living heads to their collection; this actually _worked_ a couple of times, but the failure rate was enough to make them stop.
-   _Ironclaw_:
    -   The announcement for the Second Edition directly mentions "the brazen head" towards the end, referring to the designer/publisher.
    -   In-universe, Phelan legend has Finias (presumably a lupine fusion of Orpheus and Bran the Blessed), a bard who was decapitated by a gang of his paramours' jealous husbands and whose severed head continued to sing. The people took this as an omen and built a city on the location, burying his head under the royal hall. Sometime later a queen of the tribe they founded famously sought counsel from the head.

    Theatre 

-   The witches use an apparition of an armed head to tell the future to Macbeth.
-   Robert Greene's play _Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_ dramatizes the legend of the Brazen Head.

    Theme Parks 

-   Madame Leota, of _The Haunted Mansion_ at the Disney parks, is a particularly ironic case, as she's a ghostly spirit medium who appears as a head inside her own crystal ball, rather than a human gazing into it to see.

    Video Games 

-   _Avernum_ had the Xian Skull, a skull that would randomly talk while carried around in the party's inventory.
-   Baphomet from _Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages_ is a rare modern work that depicts him as the older idea of being a head rather than the more popular 19th-century hermaphrodite satyr created by Eliphas Levi. In this game's backstory, Baphomet was able to have the testimony of Osiris's murder that groups like The Knights Templar and The Priory of Sion passed down through the generations.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_ expansion, Bloodmoon, a guy sends you to find his friend, who's an oracle. The friend, it turns out, is a skull.
-   The Brazen Head of the Vault Dweller appears in a humorous Easter Egg in _Fallout 2_. It's a huge stone head like the ones at the village. You have to "argue" with him (read say "are to" to his "are not") for twelve hours for him to concede that you are the Chosen One. He gives you a chunk of rock as a parting gift and tells you to get lost. If your Steal skill is less than 95% and you try to snag a few more he dishes out 14,000 hit points of damage and instantly vaporizes you.
    
    "Damn tourists..."
    
-   In _God of War (PS4)_ Mimir is decapitated by Kratos, at his own request, as he's trapped in a tree when first encountered, and then revived and carried around to provide advice and commentary.
-   Gerry of _Graveyard Keeper_ is this as a talking skull, though he's a particularly ineffective one as he barely has any useful information due to having amnesia, sends you off on trips to get alcohol for him, and drives you to do terrible things like cutting off flesh from the corpses you autopsy and selling it for money.
-   _Kingdom of Loathing_ has a number of examples:
    -   The Detective Skull is an off-hand item that gives a vague estimate of the remaining HP of a monster. There's also a joke item called the Defective Skull, which gives useless "information" like "I deduce that this monster is one jive turkey" or "I deduce that this monster has approximately eleventy-seven hojillion hit points."
    -   A side quest in Little Canadia has a Shrunken Head that guides you through a maze in a direct Shout-Out to _Secret of Monkey Island_.
    -   A revamp of the Naughty Sorceress quest in January 2015 included a floating skull named Frank who gave adventurers advice on how to get through the many tricks and traps of the Sorceress's tower; the Tower had previously been a serious case of Guide Dang It! for new players.
-   _Monkey Island_:
    -   _The Secret of Monkey Island_ has a severed navigator's head that leads you through the Bloody Bowels of Hell.
    -   The third and fourth instalments include Murray, a talking skull left behind after Guybrush destroys the rest of his skeletal body. He's necessary to the plot in the third game, but just a cameo in the fourth.
-   _Myth: The Fallen Lords_ had a talking, severed head show up in the cutscenes, serving as an adviser to the sorcerer-generals in charge of the war against Balor. Turns out that the head is more interested in sowing chaos and discord among the good guys then actually helping them win. Given the amount of stuff that was based on Celtic lore, he's probably based on the aforementioned Bran. The prequel established that the head is actually from a previous incarnation of the Big Bad.
-   Subverted in _Nox_. Talking to a recently-deceased mook's skull results in the skull responding, "I'm dead, I can't hear you."
-   Morte the sentient Mimir from _Planescape: Torment_ (see Tabletop Games), who looks even more skull-like than other Mimir. Mainly, this is because Morte ultimately turns out _not_ to be a Mimir, but a piece of the Pillar of Skulls from the first layer of Hell. Morte doesn't just talk, he snarks and jibes and is pretty much 'alive' in every sense of the world but the purely physical one.
-   Bonehead, one of the most memorable characters in the _Quest for Glory_ series (and that's saying something), was - as his name suggests - a skull of this nature, one of many skulls surrounding the hut of Baba Yaga. One of the few things he _doesn't_ complain about is not having Eye Beams like his boneheaded kinsmen, apparently considering sentience a valid trade-off.
-   Postie Pete in _RuneScape_, a talking skull that delivers letters to NPCs. Also one of the Holiday items was a severed Zombie head that you could hold and talk to.
-   _Stellaris_ has the mummified Head of Zarqlan, an alien prophet whose tomb you can excavate with the _Ancient Relics_ expansion. The head never talks to _you_, but any Holy Guardians in your galaxy will see your possession of it as proof that you are Zarqlan's chosen and grant you permission to settle their Holy Worlds, and will even periodically gift you fleets of their advanced warships.
-   Urien's ending in _Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike_ has this with Urien looking down at the head of Gill, the series' Big Bad and his older brother.
-   _Too Human_, being a Cyberpunk adaptation of Norse Mythology has Mimir as the Aesir corporation's data decryption and information specialist, he's not much for field work though seeing how last time only his head came back.
-   _Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus_ contains one prime example where William Blazkowicz's head is kept preserved in a jar developed by Set. It remains there a short time until it can be reattached to the headless body of a captured Nazi.

    Webcomics 

-   In the "Rise of the Funsnake" story arc of _Oglaf_ Morag The Immortal gets her head bitten off by the Funsnake. She can still talk, but only if somebody blows air up her neck.

    Western Animation 

-   The Party God from _Adventure Time_.
-   In _Disenchantment_, there is a character in the freak show who appears to be one except that she has a body, just hidden in the cabinet her "severed" head rests on.
-   _Futurama_ is known for having contemporary celebrities appear in the show as heads preserved in jars and fully animated.
-   Tarakudo, the Big Bad of _Jackie Chan Adventures_ season 4 until he gets a body in the season finale.
-   _The Simpsons_: in Bart Gets Famous, Kitty Carlisle‘s head appears in a floating ball
-   _Transformers: Animated_: Megatron spends all of Season 1 as one due to damage sustained in the pilot movie. He gets his body back in the season finale.
-   This is how Moses is portrayed in _South Park_, parodying the design of the MCP from _TRON_. A Running Gag is Moses stammering at a question he doesn't know the answer to.
