The Good Shepherd sure knows how to party.

_"First, I want to walk into a bar and drink it. And then I'm going to start a fight with five men and win. And then I am going to make use of a truly staggering number of prostitutes. Some of whom I may have once been married to. Following which, I will buy drugs. I will, in fact, show them a large pillowcase, and tell them to fill it with drugs. And I'm putting it all on the goddamn expense account."_

A typical way to show that some characters have fallen into decadence is to show them being highly promiscuous and doing lots of drugs. Sometimes this can even lead to a character's downfall (if the protagonist), or outright death (if a villain or supporting character).

This became an especially popular thing in The '80s because other displays of excessive wealth were considered a good thing (even Fur and Loathing didn't signify decadence all the time). But with an awareness of AIDS and the message of Drugs Are Bad, this trope became a great way to show characters falling from grace.

The term is common slang for what some politicians, celebrities, and Corrupt Corporate Executives like to have at parties.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Wine, women, and song is an older, related term.

For extra depravity, have the cocaine snorted off of the hooker's ass and/or breasts.

Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll is a Sub-Trope where this happens to rockers. A Binge Montage is a common way to portray a night like this.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the '80s anime, _The Professional_, Golgo 13's target in San Francisco, Bernart Muller, is an ex-Nazi who is partying with hookers in a penthouse sealed in bulletproof glass.
-   In _Naruto_ Jiraiya takes Naruto's money, claiming he wants to protect Naruto from this trope. Naruto later finds him in a bar, drunk off his ass and entertaining two prostitutes.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  This is an especially jarring example because Jiraiya is actually a very wealthy man, yet he stole Naruto's money to fund his vices (and Naruto is very poor).
-   Rod Ross' mafia gang in _Death Note_ was involved with selling drugs, and had a steady string of women implied to be prostitutes snuggling up with the higher-ups (except Mello, who wasn't interested).
-   When Caesar Clown in _One Piece_ realized that the gigantification experiments Big Mom asked him to do were impossible, he started using the money on "alcohol and groupies" instead. This was as bright an idea as one would expect embezzling from one of the Four Emperors to be.

    Comic Books 

-   In the indie comic _Pirate Corp$_, two characters on their way into a Mega Mart jokingly yell "ALL THE WHORES AND OPIUM WE CAN CARRY!"
-   In the _Earth X_ trilogy, it's implied in _Paradise X_ that this is Johnny Storm's ideal afterlife.
-   In the _Serenity: Better Days_ miniseries, the crew steals a fortune. The book contains Daydream Surprise panels showing what each person says they'll do with their share. Zoe and Wash buy a cruise ship and raise a family on it, Kaylee opens an engine part shop that stocks entirely compression coils. River does... something interesting,<small>◊</small> etc. When they get to the Shepherd's, it's not exactly what one would expect from a man of God.<small>◊</small> After seeing the crew's shocked looks, he explains that he was joking.
-   As evidenced by the quote page, the better-off characters in _Transmetropolitan_ much prefer this lifestyle. Heck, it's easier to count the pages where Spider isn't on drugs, hard for him to get laid though, while his filthy assistants have been known to order gigolos.
-   X-23's pimp, Zebra Daddy, in _NYX_ is a drug dealer and sex trafficker in the Flat-Iron District. The book establishes that he samples both his products.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   A common trait amongst Martin Scorsese's movies:
    -   _Goodfellas_. Henry Hill is portrayed as having various mistresses and, towards the end of the film when he's become a large-scale drug dealer, as having degenerated through getting high on his own supply.
    -   _Casino_. In his voiceover, Ace Rothstein comments that Nicky Santoro and his crew became careless and sloppy through booze, "broads" and coke. The latter is illustrated by a famous shot from inside a giant straw hoovering up a line of Bolivia's finest.
    -   _Gangs of New York_, when they aren't fighting.
    -   Early in _The Wolf of Wall Street_, Jordan's boss recommends a steady dose of "cocaine and hookers" as necessary for a successful Wall Street career. The remainder of the film more than delivers.
    -   Used liberally by Frank Costello in _The Departed_. Subsequent journalism revealed that "snort cocaine off hooker's ass" was on Jack Nicholson's real-life cinematic bucket list.
-   _Scarface (1983)_ pretty much runs on this trope, given the nature of Tony Montana's work and... leisure activities.
-   Used in _Lord of War_ - though, mostly, secondhand. After a particularly bad bit of business, the eponymous gunrunner's brother and business partner runs away and is later found in a hotel room having made a map of Ukraine out of cocaine, while two hookers lie passed out on his bed. Yuri Orlov himself also does an occasional line of coke, but never to the point of addiction.
-   Charlie Wilson (a Member of Congress from Texas), in _Charlie Wilson's War_. He's indicted and later acquitted of doing cocaine with strippers and a playboy model in Vegas. In Real Life he was known for his laid-back ways and liberal social views (and lifestyle — hey, it was The '70s!) before he latched on to the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan as a worthwhile pet issue.
-   _RoboCop_:
    -   In _RoboCop_, OCP executive Bob Morton is seen doing cocaine with A Lady on Each Arm shortly before getting blown up in his house. The assassin in question tells the ladies to leave first, though.
    -   In the sequel _RoboCop 2_, the baddies include an organization that seems to be a hybrid illegal drug manufacturer and religious cult.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean_, though these _are_ pirates we're talking about here.
-   Jimmy, the dwarf actor from _In Bruges_, makes good use of these in his free time. He's not rich or famous, but he's not a nice person either.
-   Part of Brian Slade's downfall in _Velvet Goldmine_; he even gets a shot doing the standard snorting-blow-off-a-groupie's-ass technique.
-   _Suite 16_ revolves around an Amsterdam hustler who, after breaking into a hotel suite occupied by a rather depraved paraplegic man, agrees to act as the other man's proxy by indulging in all the tastes the other man used to indulge in (but now no longer can) while the other man watches him on a hidden network of cameras. At one point this involves a montage of the hustler having vigorous coked-up sex with a number of oblivious attractive women.
-   _American Psycho_ rolls in this like a pig in slop.
-   _Saint Laurent_: Yves Saint Laurent's life descends into decadence that includes plenty of coke-fueled dalliances with rent boys and gigolos. The rival film about his life, _Yves Saint Laurent_, is less focused on this period in his life but still portrays it.
-   _The Social Network_'s version of Sean Parker really enjoys partying with drugs and girls who may or may not be underage; the cops eventually catch him about to snort cocaine off a sorority girl. The rest of the Facebook team (with the possible exception of Eduardo Saverin) gets a certain amount of this too, although even Eduardo uses Christy for sex.
-   In _Smokin' Aces_, mobster and magician (no, seriously) Buddy "Aces" Israel, is shown ankle-deep in hookers and cocaine as he hides out in a Lake Tahoe hotel waiting for his lawyer to agree to a deal with the authorities for Israel to inform on other Mafiosi in exchange for his freedom. Word of God has it that the character was inspired by Frank Sinatra's dealings with the Mafia so it may be that Israel's lifestyle was informed by Sinatra's, which featured lots of hookers (but no blow).
-   In _Very Bad Things_, hookers and blow (or, more specifically, _a_ hooker and blow) at the bachelor party is what kick starts the Plethora of Mistakes that drives the plot.
-   In _The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans_, the Dirty Cop protagonist has a Hooker with a Heart of Gold for a girlfriend, uses his position to extort sex, and spends the entire movie high on Vicodin, heroin, marijuana, crack cocaine, regular cocaine, or more than one of those at once.
-   In _Horrible Bosses_, Kurt's boss Bobby is a cokehead who brings prostitutes to work and has them at his house (one of which is a man).
-   In _Pain & Gain_, Paul during his addiction to cocaine does this with Sorina as the hooker.
-   This is the lowlife villain's idea of the perfect Easter party in _Easter Bunny, Kill! Kill!_.
-   A hooker snorts drugs off her client's penis in _Hanger_.
-   Noburo Mori in _The Wolverine_. Okay, just hookers, but the principle is there.
-   _Underground_ has the World War 2 Serbian gunrunners Marko and Blacky supplying the Communist resistance with their weapons, but using the money purely on booze and hookers.
-   In _Downfall (2004)_, after Hermann Fegalein, Eva Braun's brother-in-law, is tracked down to be executed for abandoning his post during the battle of Berlin, he's found in a hotel used by soldiers and civilians throwing a wild party. The room he's occupying he shares with a nude woman has booze bottles strewn about, and there are several lines of cocaine on a nearby dresser.
-   In _Son of a Gun_, the party thrown by Sam to celebrate Lynch and Sterlo's escape from prison is literally full of hookers and blow. JR gets very uncomfortable and ends up joining Natasha for a trip to town for Chinese dumplings.
-   In _Stiletto_, the bikers hold a celebration full of cocaine and willing women. Raina tries to take advantage of their distraction to attack, but the party turns out to be a ruse to lure her into a trap.
-   _The Demoniacs_: The morning after they loot the wreck, the Salvage Pirates are at the local tavern celebrating with wine and whores.

    Literature 

-   Bret Easton Ellis and the rest of the 1980s "Brat Pack" of young authors write/wrote frequently about extremely decadent characters. Ellis, in particular, portrays his characters (especially Patrick Bateman) as decadent to point of making Caligula look prudish.
-   In the Lorenzo Carcaterra novel _Sleepers_, one of the guards from the reformatory later becomes a crooked cop and it is strongly implied that womanizing and snorting coke are his primary pastimes.
-   In _Layer Cake_, the protagonist, a cocaine dealer, generally restricts his use of the drug as an "aphrodisiac" and mentions attracting female partners with the appeal of high-quality cocaine. His associate Morty pretty much has this as his hobby.
-   _Wicked Lovely_: The Dark Court likes to do this by their very nature as the "court of temptation."

-   In the Left Behind book _Glorious Appearing_, the Archangel Gabriel repeats Joel 3:1-3 (see Myths & Religion below) in the Lord's judgment of the nations at the Valley of Jehoshaphat after Jesus' return.
-   _Repeat_ features protagonist Brad Cohen repeating his life on an infinite loop; having gotten the hang of profiting from his knowledge of the future, he spends at least one later iteration indulging in seemingly nothing but vice. As he reveals to the FBI, he's spent the last twenty years having sex with both male and female prostitutes, usually while doing coke and having things rammed up his backside. Bonus points for not only sorting coke off a stripper's breasts, but also for rubbing it into his penis while masturbating!
-   _The Stand_: Shortly before the Superflu outbreak, aspiring musician Larry Underwood finally hit it big with his single "Baby, Can You Dig Your Man?", and threw a massive party in a beach house he rented that lasted three days, and ended up putting him in debt with the drug dealer who supplied weed and cocaine for the party, because Larry had just told him to "keep it coming", so when the drugs ran low, he just showed up with more. The coke alone cost more than the advance Larry got from the record company, leading to Larry moving to his mother in New York to avoid the dealer until he had the money to pay him back. Of course, during his time there, the Superflu took hold and wiped out most of humanity, making the whole issue moot.
-   In _Mermaid Moon_, seventeen-year-old Baron Peder has no interests besides seducing peasant women and drinking wine. His mother, the witch Thyrla, has encouraged his tendencies towards shallow hedonism while discouraging any interest in anything practical or intellectual so she will always be able to control him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Workaholics_ the characters are often drinking heavily and smoking pot, but tend to avoid hard drugs. In the episode "High Art" however, Ders and Adam have a night where they're given cocaine, and then spend the next day doing more cocaine and setting American flags on fire as they try to make one unburnable.
-   Charlie on _Lost_ falls into this in flashbacks. Before that, he was a good Catholic boy who just wanted to make some music.
-   Happens in _Supernatural_ to an _angel_ no less. Dean is flung a few years into the future to see the outcome of his choice of action. They lost. Castiel is seen arranging orgies and doing drugs like there's no tomorrow. Because there might not be. He's also been turned mortal.
-   Played with in one episode of _House_ that featured the main patient purchasing cocaine from a drug dealer... in his sleep. His very specific form of somnambulism turns out to be one of the clues to what ails him, rather than a specific fall from grace. During that same scene, Thirteen is shown to know her blow, to the surprise of her partner in the investigation.
-   Not exactly blow, but "Hey, now!" Hank Kingsley in _The Larry Sanders Show_ has been known to soothe his troubles through boozed-up sex marathons with prostitutes when the going gets tough.
-   Following his father's death, Hank Moody of _Californication_ goes on a bigger bender than usual, finally crossing 'snort cocaine directly off a hooker' off his to-do list. Also, Lew Ashby on season two would literally die after spending the wrong moment with, you guessed it, hookers and blow. Also, Atticus Fetch on season six was pretty well in touch with this trope.
-   _Real Time with Bill Maher_ — "Be More Cynical"
    
    **Bill Maher:** George Bush's policy in South America was "crop replacement": Instead of growing cocaine, they should grow bananas and chrysanthemums. I don't know if you've ever tried to lure a stripper to your hotel room with a banana and a chrysanthemum, but let me tell you folks — It's slow going.
    
-   In one episode of _Dead Like Me_, Daisy says something about Mason having snorted "blow off a dead hooker's stomach". He doesn't deny it and basically gets a look about him as if he doesn't wish to incriminate himself.
-   _Battlestar Galactica_. After a year in office, President Baltar is shown surrounded by bottles of pills and attractive female "interns" dressed in lingerie, signifying the corruption and incompetence of his administration.
-   _The Colbert Report_:
    -   Invoked by Representative Robert Wexler at the 4:15 mark of this clip when asked to say something that would lose him his upcoming election (he was uncontested). This was inexplicably cited by actual journalists as an example of why politicians should be wary of going on the _Report_ (and by extension _The Daily Show_), as if Wexler had been the victim of Manipulative Editing. Colbert asked him _on camera, in character_ to say that he liked cocaine and hookers. That was the joke. In a rare example of Colbert going "out of character" as it were, he took the time to call out the media for essentially doing exactly what they were accusing him of doing.
    -   In another episode, he asked Congressman Dan Maffei (playing his own Evil Twin) to finish the following sentences: "I enjoy cocaine because..." and "I enjoy the company of prostitutes for the following reasons..."
-   Chuck Bass after being dumped by Blair Waldorf on _Gossip Girl_.
-   Referenced in _Utopia_ as one of disgraced scientist Donaldson's vices.
-   At least one episode of _Satisfaction_, which focuses on a group of Melbourne High Class Call Girls, depicted this trope from the prostitute's point of view after one of them was hired to spend an evening with a booze-and-drugged up rock star.
-   _Peaky Blinders_: Episode 2.04 has Arthur taking a bath (after taking over Sabini's club) with two prostitutes, and he snorts lines of cocaine off the rim of the tub. All the more remarkable for being set in 1922.
-   _Law & Order_ once had a (male) murder suspect's alibi turn out to be this. Offers a mild deconstruction, in that cocaine's Real Life tendency to interfere with the ability to sexually perform meant that several prostitutes had to be called in, thereby giving the man a surprisingly airtight alibi.
-   _Jessica Jones (2015)_. The episode "AKA A Freak Accident" has Jeri Hogarth hire three prostitutes and get drunk and high on cocaine with them while coming to terms with her ALS diagnosis and threatened ouster from the firm.
-   _The Punisher (2017)_. After Pilgrim's brutal fight with his former colleagues in a neo-Nazi group, the previously pious hitman falls back into old habits, drinking and snorting cocaine to cope with the pain during his After-Action Patch-Up. He then hears someone doing this trope in the next room of the seedy hotel he's staying that, goes next door and drives off the man at gunpoint so he can make use of his hookers and drugs.
-   _The Good Place_: Mindy St. Clare, the sole inhabitant of The Medium Place, was an Amoral Attorney in life, who mostly spent her money on cocaine, strippers and sex. However, during one particular cocaine-binge, she had a personal epiphany and drew up plans for a huge charity fund, then died almost immediately afterwards by falling on a subway track. After Mindy's death, her sister used her money to make the fund a reality, leading to Mindy getting the afterlife "credit" for the good it caused. Since this setting only rewards good actions performed selflessly, this led to a kind of glitch in the afterlife system where neither the Good Place or the Bad Place had definitive claim on Mindy's soul. Since her situation was unique, both sides gave her an afterlife where she was neither rewarded, nor punished (and while not addicted, she still has a craving for cocaine. Forever.)
-   _The Beauty Queen Of Jerusalem_: Mercada notices Gabriel and Rosa's marital troubles, and hints he should visit Beirut on a business trip, giving him the name of a hotel his father used to visit there...that also happens to be a brothel/strip club/drug den. It works a little _too_ well, and Gabriel starts spending far too much money on frequent trips to Beirut.

    Music 

-   "2 Hookers and an 8 ball" by Mindless Self Indulgence; the name should make it pretty clear.
-   The music video for The Prodigy's "Smack My Bitch Up" includes the main protagonist, from whose eyes we see the action of the video unfold, eventually pick up a stripper and 'party' with her in this fashion. In a rare example of a gender inversion of this trope, the protagonist is eventually revealed to be a woman.
-   The Song _Wenches And Mead_ By Alestorm celebrates this particular lifestyle choice:
    
    _When I come back from a mighty quest  
    I have no need for sleep or rest  
    I head to a tavern for a drink  
    And get so drunk I cannot think  
    A wench by my side, a jug of mead  
    These are the things that I most need  
    So I sit back and sing this song  
    And drink and party all night long_
    
    -   "Treasure Chest Party Quest" features this choice lyric:
        
        _Well you know we sold out a long time ago  
        Now we're here for the money, the hookers and the blow_
        
-   In Cage's "Grand Ol' Party Crash", this is partly how we know that The Dubya (voiced by Jello Biafra) has fallen from grace.
-   The music video for the Turisas cover of _Rasputin_ has one of the singers in such a position, dressed in full pimp gear.
-   Glam Rap usually features this or implies that this is the source of the speaker's wealth.
-   "Slow Down" by Brand Nubian is a What the Hell, Hero?, directed at the speaker's ex-girlfriend. She became addicted to crack cocaine at some point in the relationship after experimenting with "gateway drugs." When her addiction got out of control, and she was stealing his money and selling his possessions (like his new sneakers) to get crack money, the speaker broke up with her. He is shocked at the number her addiction has done on her looks and personality...and the fact that she has been selling her body for crack money.
-   "Bitches n Marijuana" by Chris Brown & Tyga featuring ScHoolboy Q is about... take a wild guess.
-   Mentioned in Poison's "Nothin' But A Good Time":
-   The Bee Gees' "Wine & Women" has the line "Wine and women and song will only make me sad" at the very beginning.
-   The music video for Ghost's cover of the Genesis song "Jesus He Knows Me" has the Greedy Televangelist main character indulging in a whole lot of decadence of this fashion when he's not doing sermons.

    Myths & Religion 

-   In _The Bible_:
    -   The first several verses of Proverbs chapter 31 are King Lemuel's mother's warnings to her son not to spend his strength on women and not to give himself over to wine.
    -   Mentioned by God about Israel in Hosea 4:10-11:
        
        _They shall eat, but not be satisfied;  
        they shall play the whore, but not multiply,  
        because they have forsaken the LORD  
        to cherish whoredom, wine, and new wine,  
        which take away the understanding._ (English Standard Version)
        
    -   Mentioned in God's judgment against the nations in Joel 3:1-3.
        
        _At that time I, the Lord, will make Judah and Jerusalem prosperous again. Then in Judgment Valley, I will bring together the nations that scattered my people Israel everywhere in the world, and I will bring charges against those nations. They divided up my land and gambled to see who would get my people; they sold boys and girls to pay for prostitutes and wine._ (Contemporary English Version)
        

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The House Of Truth's first Ring of Honor incarnation was a Power Stable of hedonist party animals, whose leader, Truth Martini, was frequently seen smoking. The "hoopla hotties" he deployed were officially entertainers, and really little more than errand runners, distractions, and in the case of Seleziya Sparx, a deceptively powerful enforcer, but as Sparx later revealed, the women Casanova Wannabe Matt Taven was frequently spotted with had been hired by her, suggesting hookers were among the benefits the HOT provided if one lacked Martini's charm.
-   What Herb Abrams of the short-lived UWF spent his free time on. His last moments of life were spent naked (or only in his underwear) with two prostitutes and a mountain of cocaine. He even used this trope as a _recruiting tool_ for a manager he ended up hiring.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Exalted_:
    -   The Green Sun Princes (who are often referred to as the rock stars of Hell) are often said to be partially kept in line by their Yozi masters with the equivalent of demon hookers and blow (the other part being by their Urge and Torment). It's been noted that this is pretty ineffective in the long run; even if a Prince _is_ primarily motivated by Hookers and Blow, they'll eventually realize that they can easily acquire it for themselves.
    -   Also a common result of associating with the Guild.
    -   Sesus Naghezzar is also widely known for this as the ultimate mark of his hedonism. Or rather, widely supplies such proclivities in the rest of the Scarlet Dynasty to secure his own powerbase (he still indulges, but not as severely as his image suggests he does; it's used to help people underestimate him).
    -   A certain iconic Solar character had this as in his backstory. In fact, his abandoning of that lifestyle was the reason he was exalted; into a priestly class at that.
    -   A certain Sidereal charm (a charm is a magic power) allows him or her to avoid official summons (and thus avoiding intrigues they're not interested to be entangled in)... as long as they spend most of their days drowning in an orgy. Squick.
-   Daemon Prince Doomrider of Slaneesh, from _Warhammer 40,000_ (specifically its earlier editions), was basically this trope taken to the absolute highest Grimdark levels, with an equal dose of Drives Like Crazy. Now with more song!

    Video Games 

-   Shows up in the _Grand Theft Auto_ games. Trevor from _GTA5_ appears to be the deconstruction of this concept. He's a successful bank robber who earned wealth by scoring big in the heist game but by throwing away his money on the aforementioned Hookers And Blow (he's definitely a meth addict and his personality suggests he probably pays for sex on top of it, though he's also all but stated to be a rapist), he's relegated himself to a rather pathetic existence by the time the events of the game roll around (stuck in the middle of a dusty nowhere town living in a disgusting trailer).
-   _Saints Row 2_: When Johnny Gatt and the Boss discuss turning an underground section of an abandoned building into a new HQ for the Saints, the Boss tells Johnny that they're convinced once he mentions installing stripper poles. Insuring that there are plenty of strippers around seems to be a major priority, as every Crib that you over the course of the game gets one or more stripper poles installed in it.
-   When the Avatar is in the dream realm in _Ultima VII Part II: Serpent Isle_, he comes across Stefano, who is sitting on a throne surrounded by naked women (some of whom are playing tag). After discussing plot points with the Avatar, Stefano tells him/her to lighten up. If you have a ranged weapon you can kill his dream form and force him to wake up; he is not amused.

    Web Animation 

-   In the _Camp Camp_ episode "Into Town", Nikki speculates that David might secretly be interested in this.
    
    **Neil:** Just what exactly do you think he's into?  
    **Nikki:** Hookers and blow!  
    **Neil & Max:** WHAT?!  
    **Nikki:** I don't know what it is, but my dad and his friends always said they wish they could do that for fun. And then they would laugh... maybe that's what David likes.
    
-   Referenced in the Zero Punctuation review of _Mafia 2_, where he snarkily lays out the typical plot of a story about the Mafia.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   Bennett the Sage invokes this as a joke regarding _Gundam_'s status as a Cash-Cow Franchise for _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz_ as a little girl asked why there's still war, Bennett, for a skit as her grandfather, said "Because Bandai needs that coke and whore money," before he corrects himself and adds, "I mean, milk and cookies money."
-   Internet comedy duo Britanick have a hilarious short video called "Taint Monopoly" where Nick calls Brian, asking him if there's going to be cocaine at his party. Brian responds of course not, to which Nick wonders what they're going to do with the "girls" ...
-   _Nobody Here_: "Hermit" has Jogchem bring a hermit crab to the city, only for it to hide behind drugs, religion, money and lust. It contains a little interactive animation of the crab dancing behind beer, a pack of Marlboros and some Prozac.
-   This trope will sometimes come up in The Nostalgia Critic's show. In what is a nice change, though, he doesn't act like there's only female prostitutes and realizes how difficult it is to get out of that life.
    
    **Buzz The Bee:** Maybe I can tempt you with the delicious taste of honey and nuts?  
    **Nostalgia Critic:** Did you say Hookers and Blow?
    
-   Spoofed in _The Onion_ article "Mac Arthur Genius Grant Goes Right Up Recipient's Nose":
    
    "As soon as that first check arrived, Kim was on the phone with his dealer, and two hours later, he was in a hot tub full of strippers."
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Family Guy_:
    -   The episode "The Thin White Line" has Brian accidentally becoming addicted to cocaine. Next thing you know he's introducing the family to his "girlfriend" — a bony, washed-up prostitute.
    -   In another episode, a commercial parody for _Samuel Adams Boston Lager_ features three businessmen having lunch. One orders a Sam Adams, and the others remind him of his outstanding DUIs, but he insists he needs something to wash away the taste of weed and hooker-spit. One of the other businessmen then changes his order to a Sam Adams as well.
-   In _Metalocalypse_, the band tricks Rock N' Roll Clown Dr. Rockzo (he does cocaine) into coming to an intervention by promising him "hookers and ice ka-ka-ka-ka-ka reeeeeam!"
-   In _Archer_ this sums up Sterling Archer's hobbies in his spare time — and sometimes on the job as a secret agent. It's constant enough that his beleaguered butler Woodhouse claims he has repeatedly given Archer a Tap on the Head and passed it off as Archer having an accident born of intoxication and prostitutes.
-   _Brickleberry_:
    -   Smokey The Bear, a Depraved Kids' Show Host (and Steve's childhood hero), who turns out to be an alcoholic drug-addict who sleeps with anything that moves, ends up getting Steve addicted to crack and sleeps with Ethel (who Steve is in love with) before dying of a heart attack.
    -   Woody, the Head Ranger of Brickleberry Park, indulges in this whenever possible, including using park funds for a Christmas party where the fake indoor snow is cocaine. Ironically, it's actually LESS bad during the shows present day, when he's at least a Functional Addict. His drug use started during his days as a porn star (his full name is Woody Johnson, and he's VERY well endowed), which eventually led to his career being ruined due to one of cocaine's unfortunate side effects. After some time as an Addled Addict, he joined the army, which... well, that caused other issues, but he can at least invoke this trope and still go to work the next day.
-   _American Dad!_ have no less than _three_ characters who embrace this trope.
    -   First off, Roger, the Smith family alien. Though he's mostly The Alcoholic, he's an unabashed hedonist who does drugs whenever the opportunity arises, and occasionally indulges in weird sex (despite not having human genitals).
    -   Director Bullock, the local chief of the CIA, is a depraved drug addict who indulges in every vice imaginable to deal with the stress of his job. He favors chubby Asian callgirls.
    -   Finally, Principal Lewis, who's not only an open drug addict, he used to run cocaine for Noriega, and at one point, wishes that he was back in that job.
