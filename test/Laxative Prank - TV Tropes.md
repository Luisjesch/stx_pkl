**Richard:** Northwestern, I am the shit.  
**Gwen:** You certainly will be.

Sometimes people want revenge on someone or to cheat in a contest. One thing they do is put laxatives in their drink or food. Why laxatives? Because ideally one of two things will happen:

1.  They will suffer a Potty Emergency and forfeit the contest/run away to use the bathroom.
2.  They will soil themselves and completely embarrass themselves. Even better if it's in a stadium, especially with something like the Jumbotron.

In fiction this is normally Played for Comedy, but occasionally it is Deconstructed to emphasize the dangerous dehydration element of it.

A frequent variation is using something that induces vomiting rather than defecation. Or maybe both, so that it comes out \*both\* ends!

Do Not Try This at Home. Seriously, _don't_. This is illegal and incredibly risky in real life; even over-the-counter laxatives are by definition a type of medicine, and misapplication of medicine can have severe consequences (and a "prank" is _absolutely_ misapplication). The victim could end up seriously ill, hospitalized or even worse... **the victim could die!** Dehydration is also not the only risk: the person could be allergic to the laxative or its inert ingredients (particularly soy, an _extremely_ common allergen that is often used as a binder) or could even suffer a ruptured appendix or internal bleeding. The induced vomiting variant can cause internal bleeding, and is actually far more likely to do so than a laxative. Consequently, administering even such a seemingly-trivial pharmaceutical drug to someone without their knowledge is classified as a serious criminal offense in many jurisdictions—the perpetrator of the prank could face serious criminal charges—and in most jurisdictions this act would also constitute civil battery, or at least gross negligence (or the local equivalent), opening up the possibility that the victim could sue for damages (including, in many places, punitive damages). This could also fall under laws that criminalize adulterating or tampering with food.

There is also a variation involving over the counter eyedrops that ostensibly have the same effect. This is even more dangerous as ingestion of the active ingredient in the drops can cause a range of dangerous symptoms up to and including sending the victim into a _coma,_ with diarrhea being the _least_ likely symptom.

A subtrope of Tampering with Food and Drink. Compare Slipping a Mickey, which is basically this trope but with drugs, and Medication Tampering, which is basically this trope but switching drugs with _other_ drugs, and Revenge Is a Dish Best Served, which is putting other gross stuff in food.

Not to be confused with a Prank Gone Too Far (which despite its name, doesn't involve laxatives).

Okuda prepares an extremely powerful laxative (Which she dubs "Victoria Falls" with a rather worrying face), and has the class's snipers shoot it into the couple's coffee cups. A disguised Nagisa and Kayano deliberately occupy the café's only toilets, forcing the couple to run to a nearby convenience store, with more students cutting branches right above them, causing them to fall onto the boy and girl; leaving them drenched and disheveled from the rain, and bickering to each other the rest of the way. It was a resounding success, leaving them humiliated and none the wiser about Class E's involvement.
-   In the _Black Butler_ manga, Ciel has Sebastian slip laxatives into a meat pie and feed it to the opposing team before a cricket match.

-   In _Dragon Ball_, Bulma does this to Oolong when he refuses to cooperate with her in helping find the Ox-king.

You think this metal man is fun, but who built it? The Russians? The Chinese? Martians?

(_his stomach gurgles_)...Hold that thought and stay right there!

    Film — Live-Action 

-   This is one of the ways the _3 Ninjas_ defend themselves against a trio of bumbling kidnappers. Not exactly what you expect from "ninjas," but this is an early 90s kids' movie, so there we are. Then again, ninjas were historically known for Combat Pragmatism.
-   In _The 51st State_ or if you live in the US, _Formula 51_.

You can guess what happens next when the drug takes effect.
-   _American Pie_ has this cruel prank played on Finch.

-   Misfired in _Bringing Down the House_. When Mrs. Arness comes over for dinner, Charlene, who was convinced to act like the maid, puts milk of magnesia on her dinner, but Peter takes it and eats it. Luckily he was able to reach the bathroom as it took effect.

-   Used in the first _Mission: Impossible_ movie as part of a distraction to infiltrate Langley, albeit with an emetic, rather than a laxative.

-   In _Van Wilder,_ one character does this to her Jerkass soon-to-be-ex boyfriend by pouring what appeared to be half of a large bottle of "Colon Blow" into a special shake.

-   Done on an epic scale in the original _Mistborn_ trilogy; Breeze puts laxatives in an entire _army's_ water supply to delay them (which Tagalong Kid Spook finds amusing, as expected).

-   An apparently rare serious use of this in _The Regulators_, by Stephen King (under the Richard Bachman pen name). Seems Tak doesn't like being in a host body while that body is defecating, so Seth gets Audrey to put Ex-Lax in his chocolate milk to get Tak out of him long enough to carry out his plan to permanently solve that problem.
-   Done seriously in _A Song of Ice and Fire_ - Tyrion is too busy trying to save the city to struggle with Cersei's schemes so he uses a mild poison to get her out of his hair for one day.
-   Done seriously in the children's novel _Sparrow Hawk Red_. The child protagonist is trying to infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel's compound in order to steal a plane that's being used to smuggle drugs into the US.

    Real Life 

-   For the record, laxatives usually don't work this way in real life anyway, because there are of course many _types_ of laxative. Most laxatives don't actually make you have to go; they loosen the stool and/or the bowel muscles, usually by adding water or other matter to the stool or by causing a chemical reaction of some sort, all with intent to make the stool easier to pass. Stimulant laxatives, the kind that would actually induce the sort of reaction Hollywood depicts, are of course dangerous to use as described above.
-   Before the Fascists came to power in Italy, their paramilitary wing, the _Squadristi_ or Blackshirts, liked to force their political enemies to drink castor oil, sometimes in doses that turned out to be lethal.
-   Alfred Hitchcock did this to one of his cameramen in Real Life. Originally, the thing started as a bet over a week's salary with the cameraman over whether he could spend a night in the studio handcuffed to his camera. On the night of the bet, before he left, Hitchcock gave the cameraman a bottle of brandy, claiming that it would help him get through the night. What Hitchcock didn't tell the poor man was that he had laced the brandy with strong laxatives. The cameraman was found by the studio personnel the very next day, standing in a puddle of his own diarrhea and suffering from severe dehydration.
-   The vomiting variant of this (as well as its use in the eating disorder bulimia) is why syrup of ipecac is no longer produced or sold at least in the US. Originally intended as a poisoning antidote, ipecac turned out to be almost worse than useless for that, and unfortunately very useful to bulimics and pranksters. The only problems were that ipecac itself was cardiotoxic, and the vomiting it induced was often so violent it _frequently_ produced Mallory-Weiss tears with severe internal bleeding as the result. Some corrosive poisons can also do more damage coming back up. Ipecac got removed from the market around 2009, none too soon.
-   This is actually what got the Marquis de Sade sent to prison. He was trying to get prostitutes to fart on him, messed up the dose, and poisoned the women.

    -   In 2018, a woman confessed to murdering her husband by adding eye drops to his water for several days. She was initially arrested after the autopsy found high levels of tetrahydrozoline (the active ingredient in several brands of OTC eyedrops) in his body.
-   A certain brand of sugar-free gummy bears was noted to give people diarrhea, due to the sugar substitute being notable for its laxative effects. As such, reviews for the candy suggest using it for revenge pranks, and some have discussed supposed actual pranks committed with said candy.
-   An episode of MTV’s _High School Stories_ dealt with this; it was a recounting of an incident where three boys pulled the laxative prank on a few students with donuts, but somehow a _teacher_ got a donut and got very sick. What was worse, was that the teacher ingested a _suppository_. Thankfully, the teacher recovered but the boys ended up in serious trouble and were _expelled_, which was the very least of what could’ve happened to them according to the officer interviewed.
