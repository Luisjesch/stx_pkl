_"Some fake happiness, some fake sadness, and some fake an orgasm."_

—**Dominic Riccitello**

A Fake Orgasm is, plainly speaking, when somebody pretends to have reached a sexual climax without actually experiencing one.

In fiction and media, this activity is most commonly depicted in one of three ways:

1.  **During sexual encounters**, where a character in the act of lovemaking experiences Anorgasmia and is generally compelled to simulate the act of climaxing, usually either to avoid hurting the feelings of one's sexual partner or because they just want to get it over with.
2.  **During non-sexual activity**, such as when one or two characters in a room will imitate sex noises in order to convince other people listening in that sex is occurring when nothing of the sort is actually happening.
3.  **Through dialogue or conversation**, where a character confesses to having engaged in this behavior, often spoken of when one is in the process of breaking up with a romantic partner or dissing an ex-lover with a clear insinuation that the other person is not particularly very good in bed. Alternatively, someone may openly accuse or suspect their partner of putting on this ruse.

Most frequently, characters presented as engaging in this activity are female. While men in Real Life are also known to take part in similar deception (Especially when using condoms), male references to this practice in fiction and media are more regularly Played for Laughs or are otherwise suggested to be much less convincing than when a woman does it.

Seducer archetypes like the Femme Fatale, the Trophy Wife, or sex workers in general will fake orgasms to stroke the ego of their marks/clients, whom they ultimately don't really care about.

May overlap with The Immodest Orgasm, when a faker hams up their performance, or The Modest Orgasm, when it's downplayed.
