It's hard to imagine how he's even standing.

**Crow:** So, so what do you think? Am I buff or what? Am I blue twisted cold rolled steel or what?  
**Mike:** You're sure you've lifted already, you're not planning to lift at some future date or anything, are you?

An image of a person flexing the biceps, but with the muscular bulge missing. Sometimes this is a comedy act, in which the flexer seems incredibly proud of their (apparently non-existent) muscles, or else hopeful that the muscles will miraculously appear, only to be dismayed. In cartoons, the upper arm may actually _droop_ when the subject flexes, in a U shape, and swing back and forth like a hammock.

Otherwise, the bicep pose is used as a symbol of strength, achievement, and victory, just without the direct connection to muscular strength. The more symbolic use goes back as far as Rosie the Riveter, if not further, and is often found in advertisements aimed at women and children.

The main rule is that the person has to be flexing, and that the biceps brachii is not developed enough to show a bulge. If there is any bulge, then it doesn't count as an example of this trope.

Compare Pathetic Drooping Weapon, which is this trope applied to weapons by having them go limp to display that they are relatively useless. See also Bicep-Polishing Gesture and Fat Flex.

And for the record, in modern English usage, "biceps" is both the singular and plural form. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

    Advertising 

-   Political advertisements
-   Walgreens loves this trope, for instance here<small>◊</small> and here,<small>◊</small> and some elderly people that are unavailable on your average Google image search, and ultimately (and just barely) averted here. Ripped off by other advertisers, as seen here.<small>◊</small>

-   Sarah Haskins shows off her comedic muscle here in a promotional image that was circulating with her interviews.
-   The classic Charles Atlas cartoon adverts in the back of newspapers and comic books, in which a nerd with prominently absent musculature has sand kicked in his face then, after doing the Charles Atlas bodybuilding course, proudly flexes impressive biceps. Some adverts used "before" and "after" cartoons of the flexed bicep to illustrate the point. These have been around since at least the 1950's and probably before.
-   The mascot for cleaning product Mr. Muscle used to be an ironically weedy, geeky-looking guy who'd show off his non-existent muscles like this — the slogan being that the product "does the hard work, so you don't have to". They seem to have since decided it was unclear whether the guy represented the _product_ or the _user_ (was he "Mr. Muscle", or not?), and their mascot is now a CGI superhero in a labcoat.

-   _Hercules_:
    -   Shortly after she meets Hercules, Meg flexes her twig arms and nothing bulges. They remain little twigs.<small>◊</small>
    -   Herc himself back when he was a scrawny teenager. During the early parts of the "One Last Hope" training montage, Phil has him flex while he measures Hercs bicep with a tape measure, and poor awkward Herc can barely muster a tiny bump despite his Super-Strength. Cut to some 5 years or so later of Training from Hell, and Herc repeats the scene, except now he's a hulking adonis who _snaps_ the tape measure when he flexes.

    Films — Live-Action 

    Live-Action TV 

-   In one host segment in _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ after the movie _Space Mutiny_, Crow is inspired to start lifting weights by the movie's handsome bodybuilding hero. He has a barely noticeable and kind of pathetic bicep bump by the end of his workout, and he's inordinately proud of it. Then in comes Servo, who has become incredibly large and muscular after one leg press. Despite not having legs. And come to think of it they're both robo-you know what nevermind.
-   In the pilot episode of _Game of Thrones_ ten-year-old Bran does this when the king asks him to "show us your muscles".
-   Sponge does this in _Salute Your Shorts_ when he and Donkey Lips are being weighed when they're signing up for the wrestling team. For added humor, Z.Z. attempts to squeeze it, and Sponge exclaims, "Ow! I got a bruise!"

    Newspaper Comics 

-   In _Agnes_, Agnes ignores Trout's legitimate description of her arms as "like angel hair pasta."
-   In one _Beau Peep_ strip, Dennis says he wants to get a naked lady tattooed on his arm, so she'll do a belly-dance when he flexes his biceps. Beau replies "Dennis, have you _seen_ your biceps? She'd be hard pushed to do a slow foxtrot."
-   _Calvin and Hobbes_ - Calvin is often drawn in this way, flexing his arms, and the upper arms are drawn with two parallel lines with no curvature whatsoever, for example on the cover of the Tenth Anniversary Book. All of the main characters are drawn like this unless camouflaged by Calvin's imagination.
-   In _FoxTrot_, the weedy Jason draws battleships on his biceps, so they can bob up and down when he flexes. When Paige points out they aren't moving, he wonders if he should have started with a lighter ship.
-   The ever-self-deluding Jon in _Garfield_ has done this a few times.
    
    **Jon** (to mirror): Arbuckle, you are a Greek god.  
    **Garfield**: More like geeky god.
    
    -   Garfield himself has an aversion, he gives a ridiculously impressive flex. "Did you know you can flex fat?"
-   In _Get Fuzzy_, Bucky boasts an arm hard as a rock. Satchel feels it and says it's all bone.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Steven Regal used to do a routine where he'd flex, nothing would happen, and then he'd use his finger to push a "bicep" up (he didnt actually flex at all, but instead relaxed his arm to make himself seem unfit). The funny part being that Regal was only non-muscular as compared to the other wrestlers (who commonly stuffed themselves with steroids), and that he was legitimately tougher than almost all of them.
-   British wrestler Muscles Mansfield would often do this. His in ring pose had him flex his rather scrawny arms.
-   Red Velvett falls into the Kid-Appeal Character version, being promoted to kids on Caribbean shows, and has even done the same "pushup" gesture as Regal.
-   Heels typically do this to get heat (an Intended Audience Reaction of hatred) from the fans. John Tenta is a notable example of this.

    Video Games 

-   In _Crusader Kings II_, the character icon for the "Weak" trait is a flimsy bicep flexing.
-   In a scene from _Team Fortress 2_'s _Meet the Scout_, the Scout "flexes" his arms and acts very proud of his muscles even though there's literally no bulge whatsoever. He does this in attempts to attract women in several supplementary comics as well (with accompanying Unsound Effects like "PAINFUL FLEX".) It never works, unfortunately for him, even though it sometimes does make him look suddenly a lot more muscular.
-   _Punch-Out!!_'s Glass Joe would do this if he won, but he never wins. Unless you're using the Power Glove.
-   _Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy_ will sometimes pull this one with Daxter when the player acquires a Power Cell. He also tries to impress Keira with it, but of course to little effect.
-   _Kingdom of Loathing_ uses a little icon of a stick figure<small>◊</small> with a drooping biceps to represent the effects of Wussiness<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and Extreme Muscle Relaxation<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The difficulty-selection screen in _Monster Bash_ has Johnny flexing his muscles with different amounts for different difficulties. This trope applies for the image for Easy difficulty.

-   _Popeye_ cartoons (before the point Once per Episode where he eats his spinach and his biceps grow exaggerated peaks).
-   _Spongebob Squarepants._ In the episode "MuscleBob BuffPants", he shows off his "muscles" (Actually stick-thin bone and skin arms) to Sandy after working out with stuffed toys as weights; she then shames him by flashing her own massive guns. Hilarity Ensues when he buys inflatable arms to look buff.
-   Goofy in the Classic Disney Short _Goofy Gymnastics_. At one point the only way he can get a bulge on his arm is to transfer it from a Cranial Eruption.
-   Harold from _Total Drama_ starts flexing his scrawny arms while talking to his crush LeShawna; fortunately for him, she finds it more amusing than pathetic.
-   The rail-thin Sokka from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ can't help but flex his "muscles" every time he sees his reflection. Even Suki, who knew him for literally a day notices it, and on their second encounter teasingly asks if he's been working out lately to provoke this reaction. Of course, he falls for it.
-   _The Flintstones_ used the drooping version again - Fred would flex his bicep and declare it to be "like a potato!", then Barney would attempt to do the same and copy the catchphrase, it would droop and Fred would comment "Mashed potato, maybe..."
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   While being interrogated by Pinkie Pie in "Party of One" (it happens), Spike confesses to flexing in front of a mirror and saying "Lookin' good, Spike. Lookin' _real_ good."
    -   Spike does this again in "Read It and Weep", and even kisses his non-biceps. Silence ensues, so he leaves in disgust.

Somewhat downplayed because Chat is actually in pretty good shape (being a superhero and a professional model), he just has a slim and wiry body type so his biceps don't bulge at all.
-   An episode of _The Simpsons_ has the family visiting a boardwalk circus selling off its assets. Homer contemplates buying a weight from a strongman, noting that he could use a bit of toning. He flexes an arm, with no result, then pokes the arm, causing his _whole body_ to jiggle. Homer ends up buying the weight, but only works out one arm, leaving him with one massive arm and one arm just as out of shape.
-   In the _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ episode "Sleepover", Marco attempts to impress his crush Jackie by flexing his right arm. Despite being fit (he practices martial arts), his bicep doesn't bulge.
-   In "Teacher's Pest" a kid Bimbo flexes his non-muscles for a cat-eared child version of Betty Boop, a fly lands on the tiny arm bulge and the weight of it causes it to rescind<small>◊</small>.
