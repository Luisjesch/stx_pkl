Dogs are some of the animals most commonly associated with police work, guarding, and general law enforcement-associated professions in modern culture. This is due to a number of reasons. Firstly, police dogs are often used by real-life law agencies, usually for the purpose of tracking contraband, drugs, and fleeing subjects. Secondly, and relatedly, the common use and depiction of dogs as trackers capable of uncovering traces and trails undetectable by humans lead to an obvious comparison with detectives and bounty hunters tracking their quarries through literal or metaphorical trails. Thirdly, dogs also have strong cultural associations with service, obedience, and loyalty, which harmonize fairly well with those given to civil law and those who uphold it.

As such, it's very common for fictional dogs to be depicted as taking part in law-enforcement professions such as policemen and private eyes. In more realistic settings, nonanthropomorphic Detective Animal are also very commonly dogs for these reasons.

Physically, these characters tend to be or resemble breeds such as bulldogs, bloodhounds, and German shepherds. In settings dominated by anthropomorphic dogs, this trope is still reflected in the tendency of police and guard roles being taken by these breeds in particular.

Subtrope of Animal Occupation Stereotypes and Dog Stereotype. Compare Police Pig; generally speaking, policemen tend to be depicted as pigs in negative portrayals and as dogs in neutral or positive ones. Compare Firehouse Dalmatian, and contrast Angry Guard Dog.
