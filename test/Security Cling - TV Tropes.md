**Chief Wiggum:** There are ghost cars all over these highways!  
**Homer:** Hold me...  
**Chief Wiggum:** Only if you'll hold me.

Something is scary. Something is terrifying. Something makes one character desperately afraid.

What better response than to grab a hold of someone bigger and stronger than you to protect you?

The original version has a woman glomping a man in fright, and it's Truth in Television; why do you think guys want to take their girlfriends into Haunted Houses or to horror flicks? Heck, why do girls want to go to haunted houses or horror flicks with their boyfriends? They want to invoke this trope. Also a way to Ship Tease and play up Will They or Won't They? and get some Ho Yay in for characters of the same sex. Occasionally both characters are scared and cling to each other.

A common variation is to have a larger, stronger character hold on to a weaker, smaller character (the man is scared and wants the girl to protect him) or for the braggart who claimed to be brave to be the more terrified.

Another variant is a child hiding behind a teenager or adult (typically their parent or older sibling) and peeking around their leg fearfully/suspiciously. This last one is played more for adorable factor than Fanservice.

Sometimes, an impending danger will approach and disturb fighting/arguing characters into hugging each other in fear. Bonus points if the characters were mortal enemies or are normally very tough and fearless.

In extreme cases, the scared person will leap into the other person's arms or onto their back (usually catching them by surprise). Going in the other direction, a more restrained form of this might have the fearful person reach out and hold tightly onto the sleeve of their companion. A Clingy Child might do this all the time with their parents or any other older figure.

Cry into Chest is a sister trope.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the _Blood+_ manga, Haji notes that it's something Saya has a habit of doing whenever she's nervous.
-   In episode 8 of _Dagashi Kashi_, Saya clings to Hotaru during the scary stories. She does this instead of grabbing her not-at-all-secret crush Kokonotsu for obvious reasons.
-   In a late episode of _Digimon Adventure 02_, Ken runs to Daisuke and grabs onto his arm while the group is facing down the Big Bad.
-   _After War Gundam X_: When Dr. Farzenberg recites a poem about Lorelei, a siren-like figure who caused men to shipwreck, Kid shuts off the lights as a prank. When they come back up, Toniya is clinging to Sara, Garrod is clinging to Tiffa… and Witz is clinging to Roybea, who isn't too pleased.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_: Haruhi does this to Kyon when trapped in the sealed reality. Kyon lampshades it by suggesting that if she's really that scared she should just hold onto his arm. Haruhi's response? "Idiot!"
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_:
    -   Nagi does this several times, mostly to Hayate. Hinagiku is another favorite target for this, sometimes even when Hayate is also present. Most often it's someone hiding behind one of them for protection but the clinginess is definitely there.
    -   Hinagiku does it at one point to Hayate, but she's just kidding and is messing with him due to her intense dislike of losing (triggered by getting scared earlier and getting saved by Hayate). Hayate even makes a Call-Back to this around 200 chapters later. Though he claims that he was also kidding, it's a cover for it actually being a Security Cling, but instead because _he_ was scared and wanted to protect _her_ from Tama.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    -   When Russia comes to visit, (North) Italy and Romano (South Italy) are shown clinging to each other in fear.

-   _MegaMan NT Warrior_: Yai and Chaud ride an elevator, and when the lights go out and the elevator stops, she grabs his arm. His comment? "You're cutting off the circulation to my hand."
-   Gau from _Nabari no Ou_ has a rather cute tendency to cling onto Raikou's arms when he's nervous.

-   _Sailor Moon Crystal_: Cyphrine and Ptioil do this just before their first death.
-   _Rebuild World_: Sheryl, after being held hostage by The Mole Sebla, and Akira saving her via a Distract and Disarm gambit, clings to Akira’s arm like this since the moment she's free.
-   _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_: In the Alternate Timeline Marie Route Side Story series, Marie has a habit of hiding behind Leon and clinging to his arm or sleeve when scared, such as when Jilk approaches threateningly, or they’re facing a Torches and Pitchforks mob.

    Art 

-   The couple in _Fugitive Love_ by Auguste Rodin are in clear distress as they strangely embrace for comfort. It also seems like they're being torn apart. Given they were included on _The Gates of Hell_ as an adaptation of a couple eternally blown apart by a whirlwind, odds that's what Rodin was going for.

    Comic Books 

-   _Robin (1993)_:
    -   Ives grabs Tim's arm and pulls him back a little so Ives is in front of him when they're confronted by bullies, but hesitates to let go of Tim's sleeve.

    -   Ives and Hudson cling to each other's arms when they run afoul of Steeljacket in the ruins of a laundromat that was damaged during the earthquakes and then ruined during _Batman: No Man's Land_.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Dr. No_: Honey Rider clings to James Bond's arm when riding the elevator to Dr. No's lair. In a variation, Bond readily admits that he's as scared as she is (given that it's the first Bond film, he's not as used to the idea of villains inviting him to dinner instead of just shooting him, so is feeling rather creeped out).
-   _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_: Hermione gradually goes down Ron's arm when Harry is about to approach Buckbeak.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_: As Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee sit on a rock in Mordor after the destruction of the Ring, fully expecting to die in the rising lava, they put their arms around one another, comforting one another in a variation of this trope.
-   _When the Last Sword Is Drawn_: In the film's present day, Chiaki Shizu is shown clinging tightly to her husband Ono in her sleep, which his Internal Monologue attributes to Shizu losing both her father, main protagonist Yoshimura Kanichiro, and her brother Kaichirou to the Boshin War.

Sentient spaceship ART points out she's simply taking comfort in 'his' presence, so Murderbot raises its body temperature and pretends to sleep until she eventually rolls over to her own sleeping pad.
    -   Because it Hates Being Touched, Murderbot being willing to let someone hug it is presented as a Friendship Moment.
-   In _Xuthal of the Dusk_, Conan the Barbarian is not amused when a Beautiful Slave Girl does this trope while they're searching a Ghost City, as grabbing hold of his sword arm when he might need to use it could get him killed.
-   In The Indian in the Cupboard, when the tiny toy-sized Boone and Little Bear, who had been enemies up to that point, are suddenly frightened by a full-sized adult who shouts in disbelief at the sight of them being alive and moving, they do this.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the _Angel_ episode "That Old Gang Of Mine", Cordelia gets Fred to go out to a bar with her and Wesley, after spending all her time inside, fearing the outside world because of past bad experiences. The bar gets attacked by a gang of demon hunters, and Fred spends most of the rest of the episode clinging to Wesley's arm.
-   The pilot episode of _The Astronaut Wives Club_ has a very mild example, since the character doing the clinging is Louise. Although she refuses to let any of the other wives in to watch Alan's first launch with her, Max is there because he has to be for his job. He tries to discreetly leave the room, but Louise grabs his hand, and they remain that way for the duration of the mission.
-   Kara Thrace and Lee Adama during a particularly tense moment in _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_, when they've just decided to take on a joint secret mission to assassinate an Admiral, and know they'll probably die for it.
-   _Bones_ Brennan does it to Booth when she sees a snake in one episode. Later, in another episode, she’s not afraid and remarks that she’s only afraid of snakes when Booth is around to be jumped on.
-   In the _Broad City_ episode "Hurricane Wanda", Bevers grabs onto his older sister Marla in a panic when the power goes out.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: In "Graduation Day, Part 2", Coredlia flings herself into arms of the much shorter Jonathan when Sunnydale High is blown up. According to Danny Strong, who played Jonathan, the moment was Charisma Carpenter's idea, as it was her last episode and the two had never had any significant scenes together.
-   A variation in the classic series of _Doctor Who_: Sarah Jane occasionally clings to the Fourth Doctor's ridiculously long scarf when the two are in danger.
-   In _Emmerdale_, Robert Sugden clings to his love interests for comfort in two particularly emotional moments.
    -   He clings to wife Chrissie after returning home from holding his secret lover Aaron hostage and threatening to kill him when Aaron tried to force his hand and reveal his secrets.
    -   He clings to husband Aaron after Aaron tells Robert that he would like to try to forgive Robert for sleeping with Rebecca while he was in prison.
-   Played for Drama in _Forever Knight_. In the pilot episode, Nick Knight gives a scare to a woman who then asks to be hugged. He does so, but finds himself struggling with the urge to feed with her neck so temptingly close.
-   _Kamen Rider Ex-Aid_: Nico nearly always clings to her doctor, Taiga, when creeped out. This is justified behavior on occasion, like during an encounter with a psychopathic god wannabe. While their relationship is played ambiguously, they get called out on the Ship Tease vibes it gives off anyway.
-   In _Smallville_, Chloe Sullivan does this to Clark Kent on occasion.
-   During the final moments of _Supernatural_ Season 4, in the episode "Lucifer Rising", Sam and Dean react to Lucifer's imminent appearance this way. Especially heartwarming considering all of the crap their relationship has been going through, all the lies and mistrust and whacked-out junkie behavior in the past season, and the fact that Sam is actually directly responsible for freeing Lucifer and betrayed and abandoned Dean to do it. However, their first instinct when they're desperate and terrified is still to cling to one another.
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
    -   Awaiting the impact of a possibly deadly missile, Kirk feels Yeoman Rand at his back and reaches behind to put an arm around her. (This is especially notable as, according to David Gerrold, there was a preproduction memo saying this _shouldn't_ happen on _Star Trek_.)
    -   In "And the Children Shall Lead", a frightened Kirk, under the influence of the brainwashed children and going on full-on panic mode, clings to Spock's arm in the elevator. And the Vulcan who Hates Being Touched has no problem with practically hugging him back reassuringly. Ho Yay, anyone?

-   In _Final Fantasy XIII_, Hope does this a few times with Vanille early in the game—he shyly takes hold of her wrist before they follow Snow to the Pulse Vestige; he fearfully grabs her hand as PSICOM attacks the Vestige, and then the terrified Hope hides behind Vanille while holding her arms after the door to Anima's Throne opens.
-   _Love & War_ has an example played for laughs. When Ryan and Lavie have to explore Blackwater Park, Lavie hears animal sounds, probably those of a hooting owl, and is instantly scared. She grabs hold of Ryan's arm, but he is far from pleased:
    
    **Lavie:** _\[almost in tears\]_ But I'm scared!  
    **Ryan:** _\[deadpan\]_ I know, but how is twisting my arm off going to help?
    
-   Nanako is introduced in _Persona 4_ peering shyly around Ryotaro Dojima's leg at you, and it's about as adorable as you'd expect.

    Web Videos 

-   Channel Awesome: In three of the anniversary movies (_Kickassia_, _Suburban Knights_, and _To Boldly Flee_), The Nostalgia Critic (a six-foot man) hides behind and clings to The Nostalgia Chick (a five-foot-two woman). In these instances, he really _does_ think she's stronger and braver than him, so that's why he does it.

-   On _Critical Role_, this is a regular reaction of the players to something stressful or frightening happening in-game — most often between Taliesin Jaffe and Marisha Ray, though all of them get involved at some point or other.
-   On DanAndPhilGAMES, for Halloween 2023, the guys played _Don't Scream_, a horror game that's connected to the player's mic and has one simple rule: if you scream, you lose. Since they were desperately trying to keep quiet in the face of several jumpscares and terrifying imagery, Dan and Phil defaulted to clinging to each other when things got especially spooky.

    Western Animation 

-   The Joker does this to Batman in the _Batman: The Animated Series_ episode "Beware the Creeper". There's no deception or ulterior motive on the Joker's part, he's legitimately relieved that Batman showed up — the Creeper is too crazy even for him.
-   Invariably, Mabel and Dipper from _Gravity Falls_ reach for each other's arms or hands in frightening situations. This even leads to a heartbreaking moment in "Gideon Rises" when Gideon's Giant Mecha forcibly pulls them apart, breaking their grip on each other's hands.
-   In the _Kaeloo_ episode "Let's Play Frosted Christmas - Part 2", Kaeloo holds on to Mr. Cat's arm when they are Exploring the Evil Lair.

-   In _Steven Universe_, Pearl clings onto Garnet's arm when the former feels stressed (which is more often than you think). And then there's this moment of strong Hypocritical Humor from "An Indirect Kiss".
    
    **Pearl:** _\[clinging onto Garnet's arm\]_ Our memories of Rose can't be tainted by some overgrown brambles! _\[chuckles\]_ Look at them. They're a mess without her guidance. Directionless, pathetic, _\[yanks Garnet by her arm\]_ _clinging_ things. _\[lets go\]_ It's going to be okay, Garnet.
    
-   In _Total Drama Action_, a reluctant Courtney is forced to cling onto Duncan while they're balancing on a very narrow column during one challenge.
-   In one episode of _Transformers: Prime_, Bumblebee briefly grabs onto Ratchet's arm as they inspect an empty scraplet trap. Poor 'bot just had a close shave with one of the little beasties, so you can hardly blame him, even if he is a giant robot.

    Real Life 

-   Humor writer Dave Barry describes watching a horror movie that made him whimper and cling to the person next to him: horror writer Stephen King, who in turn was whimpering and clinging to his wife.

## Examples of a simple glomp (they grab onto the person):

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _A Centaur's Life_, Hime and Sasasul cling to each other during a scary movie. Notably, an Antarctican (like Sasasul) is the villain and a centaur (like Hime) is the victim, and Hime was previously afraid of Sasasul due to watching the same movie as a child. And everyone learned an important lesson that chapter.

-   Kirie from _Girls Bravo_ often does this to Yukinari whenever she's afraid.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   Played for Laughs in _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_ — Allenby and Rain glom onto each other when Domon starts talking about rats, and then look really embarrassed when they realize that he's talking about the metaphorical kind.
    -   After Dr. Farzenberg recites a Ghost Story poem in _After War Gundam X_, Kid messes with them by killing the lights. When he turns them back on, Toniya has glommed onto Sara, Garrod is holding Tiffa protectively... and Witz has grabbed onto Roabea with all four limbs.
        
        "I should have stood next to the girls."
        
-   _Hanaukyō Maid Team La Verite_: In episode 7, after Konoe regains consciousness in an underground room, her terrified assistant Yashima Sanae runs into the room and performs a full-body (arms _and_ legs) frontal glomp on her.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_:
    -   Mikuru does this to Kyon during the Mysterique Sign episode in response to seeing the giant cricket that's about to attack them.
    -   There's a moment in "Remote Island Syndrome" where Mikuru clings to Yuki after hearing Haruhi speculate that the former will be a murder victim. This was censored in the anime.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_: During the exploration (and escape from) the ruins of the Sanzenin Mansion in the Golden Week arc, Hayate holds onto Nagi and Ayumu's hands, claiming that they're "frail girls", leading Hinagiku to think that Hayate likes frail girls. But Fridge Logic dictates that this is actually the opposite; Hayate himself is clinging to the girls because they're frail and it's important that he knows that they're alright, and Hinagiku, who he knows is strong enough to take care of herself, doesn't need to be protected for him to know she's safe. Much Ship Tease leads and follows in the arc.
-   America does this to Japan in episode 51 of _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ while watching a scary movie.

-   In _Ouran High School Host Club_, while the club is at Kyouya's (or Nekozawa's in the manga) private beach, Tamaki and Haruhi have an argument. Things are quickly patched up after Haruhi first grabs the bottom of Tamaki's shirt when he turns to leave the room after she hears a clap of thunder. She then climbs into a nearby armoire, and Tamaki opens the doors trying to coax her out. Cue another loud crash of thunder to send Haruhi right into Tamaki's arms.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   Jessie and James. Fandom calls it the "Fear Hug".
    -   Misty does this with Ash and Tracey a few times.
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   Akane glomps onto Ranma when she becomes scared by ghosts in The Cursed Tunnel of Lost Love. It also gets discussed earlier in the arc.
        
        **Man:** It's really scary in there, you know. Your girlfriend will squeeze you for dear life!  
        **Ranma:** Well, I don't want to be hugged by Akane. That's for sure!  
        **Akane:** Who would want to hug you, anyways?!
        
    -   In the manga, when Ranma and Akane are cornered into a wall by a tiger, she grabs onto him. He has a major fear of cats, so he isn't doing too hot either.
    -   Played for Laughs shortly after. The tiger Gosunkugi used to scare Ranma is in return scared of Ranma's Cat-Fu. The tiger's so terrified that it jumps into Kunō's arms, which makes Kunō think it's attracted to him, then clings to and hides behind him.
        
        **Kunō:** I'm sorry, but my heart belongs to another.  
        **Random guy:** I don't think it's asking you for a date!
        
    -   Invoked in the Battle Dogi arc. While Ranma tries to seduce Akane in a closet to prevent her from wearing a powerful suit, Genma and Sōun attempt to help things along by throwing some snakes and frogs at Akane. It works, until the suit itself interrupts.
    -   Invoked but subverted in the Lenses of Invincibility arc; Mousse buys tickets to a horror-themed waxworks exhibition, hoping that when he brings Shampoo there, she will cling to him in fright. Instead, she just finds them disgusting and beats Mousse up for bringing her to such a place.
-   _Rebuild World_:
    -   Sheryl has a frequent habit of doing this for hours after Akira becomes her Living Emotional Crutch since giving her a Cooldown Hug, due to the pressures of being a Supporting Leader of their slum gang. Sheryl does this particularly ardently when repressing the cocktail of negative emotions she feels after seeing Akira get along with Carol and being consciously desperate to avoid being seen as a Clingy Jealous Girl.
    -   While the Lovable Coward Hikaru is serving as The Handler for Akira while he’s on an Escort Mission of a Big Badass Rig, she does an Overly Long Hug like this to Akira when going to see the sunrise from the dangerous roof, since Akira’s Powered Armor has Sticky Shoes. Leads to a Not What It Looks Like situation with Shirou and Halmers.
-   In _Roll Over and Die_, Flum does this quite a bit with Milkit.
    -   After preventing Milkit from being raped and killing her attackers, Flum clings into her while assuring her that nothing that happened was her fault. Flum reflects on how fortunate it is that Milkit is alive.
    -   After rescuing Milkit from the deprivations of Satils, Flum has Milkit sleep in her bed and clings to her as much as humanly possible, so she's never taken away again.
-   One episode in _Sailor Moon_ has Usagi going to an arcade with Mamoru, Ali, and Ann. (Ali and Ann are actually aliens, Ali has a crush on Usagi, and Ann has a crush on Mamoru). Both Usagi and Ann cling to Mamoru, and when things get a little scary inside, Usagi freaks and is thrown out of the ride and into the arms of Ali, who was thankfully nearby.
-   _She's My Knight_: Mogami hugs Ichinose tightly when she hears a scary noise (it turns out to be a cat) and when it starts thundering.

-   _All-New X-Men_: X-23 does this to a time-displaced teen Cyclops after Stryker reveals to her that Arcade released his Murderworld footage on the internet. Including, quite prominently, imagery of Laura in a trigger scent-induced rage. The moment shows just how badly she's struggling to keep herself together after the one-two punch of Murderworld and her previous torture at Stryker's hands.

    Fan Works 

-   _Child of the Storm_ has Harry prone to an after-action variant of this, with his being fond of snuggling with people he cares for, often for comfort — however, one example, with Thor (his dad) and Wanda (his godmother and maternal substitute), after the hideously traumatic events of chapter 72 is a) more conventional and b) overlaps with Cry In To Chest.
-   _Evangelion 303_: In Chapter 6, Asuka clings to Shinji because she's frightened of losing him when they engage the enemy since he doesn't value his own life.
-   Happens to Kyon three times at once in _Kyon: Big Damn Hero_, with Haruhi taking Mikuru to see _Saw_ specifically to invoke this trope. Mikuru ended up in Kyon's lap, with Haruhi and Miyoko clinging to either arm.
