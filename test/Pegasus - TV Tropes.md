"Pegasus" is the name of the winged horse in Greek Mythology, born from the blood that flowed when Perseus slew Medusa. He was then used by Bellerophon to slay the Chimera. Since then, the image of a horse with wings has persisted in stories and culture, whether these horses are named Pegasus or another name. "Pterippi", a portmanteau of the Greek words "pteron" ("wing") and "hippos" ("horse"), is fairly common, and is in fact a redirect to this page.

By far the common appearance these creatures have is that of an all-white horse with bird wings, following the original mythical incarnation, sometimes with colored highlights on their feathers for visual variety. These are typically noble and benevolent beings that live away from common society, but may serve as steeds for particularly good-hearted heroes. Less commonly, they may have batlike or draconic wings; these tend to have black fur and are more likely to be evil or "perverted" beasts.

Such stories may turn Pegasus into a whole species, even though there was only ever one of them in legend — although descriptions of entire species of winged horses, termed "pegasi", turn up as early as Roman bestiaries and geographies.

    Fan Works 

-   A.A. Pessimal: Pegasi(i), long thought extinct, return to the Discworld after a gorgon policewoman is swiped across the face by a troll and gets a bad nosebleed. Lord Vetinari and Sir Samuel Vimes take advantage and upgrade the Air Watch with the resultant marvellous flying horses. These are placed in the care of the Air Witches. Later on it is discovered that whilst created by magical accident, they are capable of breeding with normal horses. Thus creating more Pegasi in the natural run of things, and as time passes, allowing the Service to expand and recruit more Witch-Pilots. Vetinari is in favour of this and makes the necessary funding and facilities available, including purpose-built air bases.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Piloted by Witches and navigated by attendent Feegle, a Pegasus can get a rider plus load _anywhere_ on the Disc via the Feegle magic of the craw-step... in a matter of _minutes_. This builds on the canonical use of the craw-step by the City Watch Air Police in _Snuff_. Pegasi appear in several stories by A.A. Pessimal, including _Gap Year Adventures_ and _The Price of Flight_.
-   _Tiny Sapient Ungulates_ reinterprets pegasi as having lobed, membranous and somewhat bat-like wings due to some x-rays in _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ revealing that pegasi have bones in their wing feathers.
-   _With Strings Attached_: George becomes one twice. His doing so is the first indication that his shapeshifting ring is more powerful than it seems.

    Films — Animated 

-   Barbie movies:
    -   _Barbie: A Fairy Secret_ has the Pega Ponies, which, like the Flutterponies from the _My Little Pony_ movie, have wings more akin to butterflies.
    -   _Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus_, naturally, stars a pegasus named Brietta. In reality, Brietta is Annika's long-lost sister, who was turned into a pegasus after refusing the Big Bad Wenlock's hand in marriage.
-   Disney:
    -   _Fantasia_: The "Pastoral Symphony" segment features a whole Pegasus family: a white mother, black father, and foals that yellow, blue, and a black baby Pegasus who is always last. A few adult pegasi that are blue are seen as well. The manner in which they fly down to a pond, and then move around in the pond, is very reminiscent of swans.
    -   _Hercules_: Pegasus is Hercules' ride in this film, despite the fact that this never happened in actual Greek Mythology, and was created by Zeus out of clouds.
    -   _The Three Caballeros_ has a segment about a flying donkey.
-   Pegasi are the focus of the sixth _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_ film, _Meet the Pegasus_, where the goats must write a happy ending for a story starring the Pegasus Prince, who lives in a cloud city populated by humanoid pegasus people.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Clash of the Titans (1981)_ and _Clash of the Titans (2010)_ both have Pegasus as only one of a species of flying horses.

In the remake, Pegasus himself is marked by being bigger, Darker and Edgier, more aggressive and black.
-   In _The Thief of Bagdad (1924)_, the thief's quest for rare treasure brings him to the Abode of the Winged Horse, which he must ride to the Citadel of the Moon.
-   _Thor: Ragnarok_: The Valkyries are seen riding winged horses in a flashback. A pegasus shows up again during _Avengers: Endgame_ being ridden by Brunnhilde, the last surviving Valkyrie, in the final battle against Thanos.

    Literature 

-   _Alex Verus_: One of these shows up in the first book as the mount of an older diviner.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_: The horse Strawberry, originally from Earth, is given wings by Aslan and takes the name Fledge. Fledge deserves special mention since he began his life as a non-speaking cart-horse and was one of the first animals given speech by Aslan, and was then given wings to help Digory on his quest. He is also the only pegasus to appear in the series, although final book implies that, as revered and majestic as unicorns are considered, pegasi are even more so.

-   _Discworld_: In _Snuff_, the Amkh-Morpork City Watch makes the discovery that Air Watch pilots can use the Feegle magic of the "craw-step" to take a pilot from Ankh-Morpork to Howondaland in a matter of _minutes_. The Feegle magic is a close-guarded secret, but it is believed to exploit the ability to enter a parellel dimension of space-time and then to return to the "real world" at a location chosen by the navigating pilot — potentially crossing thousands of miles of real-world space within minutes. Feegle pilots navigating birds of prey — who are Air Policemen under Sam Vimes' command<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  — use this for recconnaisance and communications flights.
-   _Dracopedia_: Pegasi are depict in _Dracopedia: The Bestiary_ with feathers on their tail, mane, and legs to complement the wings. They resemble purebred horses, in contrast to the rangier mustang traits of hippogriffs.
-   _Dragon Rider_: Pegasi are intelligent and can talk. They are descended from the original Pegasus who sprung from the blood of a gorgon, and are now a critically endangered species, with an unusual life-cycle. They are oviparous, laying eggs which are initially no bigger than a hen's egg, which the mother pegasus has to lick to enable the eggs to grow (ultimately to ostrich-size), so that the foals within them can develop up to the point of hatching (when they are the size of a hen).
-   _Everworld_ features the mythological Pegasus and his sons living on Olympus; as far as we're told there aren't any other winged horses in this world. They can also talk, and are used to firebomb the Hetwan.
-   _Harry Potter_: Winged horses are a common species of domesticated magical creatures, and several distinct breeds exist.
    -   Abraxans are gigantic palomino pegasi, and the strongest breed. The Beauxbatons delegation to the Triwizard Tournament arrives at Hogwarts in a gigantic carriage drawn by a team of Abraxans that drink single-malt whiskey.
    -   Aethonans have chestnut coats and are native to Britain and Ireland.
    -   Granian are grey<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and incredibly fast. The legendary Pegasus was a Granian.
    -   Thestrals, such as those that pull the Hogwarts coaches, are skeletal, black-furred and bat-winged, and are completely invisible to those who have not witnessed and accepted death.
-   The crest of Valdemar in _Heralds of Valdemar_ is a rampant white pegasus trailing broken chains, which one character calls Windrider. Valdemar's best-known feature is its uncanny white horses called Companions. One in-universe song (since made into filk by the author) refers to Windrider as a winged Companion. All other Companions just look like beautiful white horses, so whether or not the wings are a metaphor is unknown.
-   _The Neverending Story_: In the story's second part, when Balthasar becomes ashamed of having a mule following him around but doesn't actually want to tell his faithful follower Yikka to get lost to her face, he plays on her desire to have children despite her sterility by imagining a beautiful, long-maned pegasus stallion into existence and convincing Yikka to go and meet him. The narration notes that they were rather happy together, and ended up having a winged mule child named Pataplan, who became a notable figure in his own right.
-   _Ology Series_: In _Monsterology_, winged horses are native to the eastern Mediterranean, can be used as steeds and are a favorite food of griffins.
-   In _Pegasus (2010)_, there's an entire species of pegasi, who co-exist peacefully, though they can only communicate via specially trained Speaker magicians. Each member of the human royal family has a pegasus companion.
-   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ and _The Heroes of Olympus_: Percy, who is able to speak with horses due to being a son of Poseidon, befriends a winged horse named Blackjack, who is his Cool Horse during the big battles thereafter. The original Pegasus is said to exist as the immortal sire of all the rest. Uniquely, his brother Chrysaor shows up, jealous at being overlooked in favor of his brother, as a pirate.
-   _The Spectral Chronicles_: In addition to Moon Shadow, Demetrios' flying mustang, the Stone Cutters have flying horses of their own, which look like thoroughbreds with albatross wings. Some have pure white or pure gold coats, and others have coats resembling those of plains zebras.
-   _Stravaganza_: In _City of Stars_, winged horses are a mutation that occurs periodically among normal thoroughbreds. They are seen as a sign of good luck, especially in Remora (the fantasy counterpart of Siena). They grow much faster than normal horses, and are capable of flying with a rider by the age of a few months.
-   _A Swiftly Tilting Planet_: Gaudior. However, when he takes flight, he hardly ever moves in _space_, but only through _time_. (The movement of the planet Earth itself throughout time is not accounted for.)
-   _Tortall Universe_: A number of winged horses appear in the later books. They're never referred to as pegasi, and come in a variety of forms, including little insect-sized ones and the carnivorous hurroks. The herbivorous kind play a big role in the _Trickster's Duet_ as the symbol of the raka royal family, the Haimings. All of them are explicitly stated to have bat-like wings because they're mammals.
-   In _War of the Dreaming_, they are called dreamcolts and serve as steeds to the Guardians of Everness.
-   _The Witches of Eileanan_, by Kate Forsyth, has a number of winged horses appear.

-   _Pee-wee's Playhouse_: Cowboy Curtis has a pegasus mount.
-   _Super Sentai_: Two series have had warriors with Pegasus motifs, _Dengeki Sentai Changeman_ and _Gosei Sentai Dairanger_. Both of them are the Blue Rangers of their teams.

    Music 

-   Asia: Winged horses appear on the cover of the _Then & Now_ album.
-   African music group Osibisa took this motif a step further by using winged _elephants_ as the band motif; the flying elephant mascot appears on all their album covers.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Classical Mythology is the Trope Namer and Trope Maker. Pegasus (_Pegasos_, in Greek) was owned by Bellerophon, until Zeus struck them down. Far less famous than Pegasus was his brother, Chrysaor, who depending on the source is a giant or a winged boar. Later on, the Roman writer Pliny described a kind of winged horses with antelope-like horns that lived in mountain ranges south of the Sahara, which he named Pegasoi Aithiopikoi — "Aethiopian pegasi". These creatures would go on to feature in Medieval bestiaries for quite some time after that.
-   Hindu Mythology: Uchhaihshravas is a seven-headed flying horse.
-   Chinese Mythology: The longma, or dragon horse, is a kind of winged horse with dragon scales that typically appears an omen. The flying horse Tianma is also often translated as a pegasus, though it lacks wings and instead flies via magic.
-   In Arabic folklore, _Al-Buraq_ ("lightning") was a magnificent winged white horse presented to the prophet Mohammed by the arch-angel Gabriel.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Chris Benoit used the names Wild Pegasus and the Pegasus Kid in Japan and Mexico.

    Roleplay 

-   _Fire Emblem Tropera_: Pegasi are an option for units with the Flying Mount feat. A generic unit mounted on a pegasus is usually Fragile Speedster, though all of those in the party have fallen into the Lightning Bruiser or Stone Wall archetypes.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Pegasi are staples of the _Monster Manual_ in most editions. They're portrayed as shy but intelligent Chaotic Good creatures that serve as steeds for those who can gain their trust; they're highly intelligent and often serve and revere good deities associated with nature. In early editions, despite being primarily mammals with a few bird parts tacked on, pegasi reproduce by laying eggs. 5th changes this to them giving live birth like normal horses. 5th Edition also establishes that nightmares — Hellish Horses with fiery manes, capable of flying without wings — are created from pegasi by means of an agonizing, humiliating ritual in which the pegasus' wings are amputated and its mind corrupted by evil.
-   _GURPS Fantasy Bestiary_ describes pegasi chiefly based off of the Greek legend, noting that the effects of giving winged steeds to players mean that pegasi may be best introduced as very rare, difficult to tame and/or as a temporary asset for players.
-   _Palladium Fantasy_:
    -   Pegasi are extremely rare creatures only found roosting on high mountains far from civilization. They used to be a lot more common and were often used as steeds by the elves, but they were almost completely exterminated during the great dwarf-elf war in the distant past.
    -   There are also the dragondactyls, essentially pegasi with clawed feet and draconic tails and wings; additionally, male dragondactyls can breathe fire. They are more common than the nearly-extinct pegasi, although not particularly numerous in absolute terms, and despite their monstrous appearance are relatively even-tempered beasts and no more difficult to domesticate than most horses.
-   _Pathfinder_: Pegasi conform to the traits of their _D&D_ counterparts in most respects. However, most rulebooks also make mention of a "champion" variety that is faster and stronger than the stock pegasus and also possesses resistance to fire, poison, and petrification — traits that would make it quite ideal as a steed for fighting legendary monsters like the Chimera.
-   _Res Arcana_: The Celestial Horse is a winged white horse. Its noble nature is hinted at by its ability, which can generate any basic essence except Death.
-   _Shadowrun_: Pegasus (singular and plural) appear in _Paranormal Animals of Europe_ as winged horses native to the Balkans, Italy and southern France. They're not common, and extensive poaching for racing stock is rapidly wiping them out.
-   _Warhammer_: Pegasi appear in several armies. Empire and Bretonnian heroes and generals can ride them, and the Bretonnians can also field an entire unit of Pegasus Knights. In general, pegasi are stated to differ from true horses in several respects — they have hollow bones like birds, although their ability to fly is still assumed to be chiefly magical in nature, and are omnivorous as well. They prefer to live in mountains and along high plateaus and are very widespread, and a number of specific variants exist in various corners of the world.
    -   Royal pegasi are found exclusively to Bretonnia and are famed for their extreme intelligence and loyalty.
    -   Dark pegasi are highly aggressive creatures tainted by Chaos, and are marked by their batlike wings, jagged horns, sharp fangs and purely carnivorous diets. Most live in the mountains of Naggaroth, and are often taken by the Dark Elves to serve as flying mounts.
    -   Radiant pegasi, described in the _Storm of Magic_ supplement, live in the highlands of Araby and spend long periods of time basking in the sun and absorbing its light and heat. When attacked or threatened, they can release their stored energy in a blinding flash of light.
-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_: Pegasus is the tribal totem of the Black Furies, and demands that those who serve him protect females and their young.

    Video Games 

-   _Age of Mythology_ has both the ability to raise Pegasi (_Equus pegasus_) and the hero Bellerophon, who rides Pegasus and has a special leaping attack allowed by his winged horse.
-   _Balacera Brothers_ have hostile pegassi as airborne enemies, probably one of the very few examples of the pegasus being depicted in a negative light.
-   _Fire Emblem_ has the recurring Pegasus Knight class. Pegasi are known to not like letting men ride them, making the class and its promotions female only. The only exception to this comes in _Fire Emblem Fates_, with the reason given being that the pegasi living in Hoshido are a different breed to others.
-   _Digimon_: Pegasusmon is an orange-furred, winged equine with a face-covering metal mask.
-   In _Gems of War_, one of the non-centaur troops from Divinion Fields (the centaur homeland) is the pegasus. Whether they're intelligent like the centaurs or are simply used by them (albeit not, presumably, as mounts) isn't stated.
-   _God of War II_ gives Pegasus Hot Wings.
-   _Hero of Sparta_ have you releasing the pegasus in one level in order to travel from Sparta to Egypt. The moment pegasus is released, you then hitch a ride on it to escape a Collapsing Lair.

-   _Master of Magic_ gives the High Men access to pegasi as a unique flying mounted unit.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   _Mega Man Zero 4_: One of the bosses is the Reploid Winged Humanoid steed, Pegasolta Eclair.
    -   _Mega Man X5_ has Spiral Pegasion/the Skiver.
    -   _Mega Man Star Force_: One of the three versions is named after Pegasus Magic.
-   _Minecraft_:
    -   While _The Aether_ has no actual horses (flying or otherwise), there are flying cows and phygs (flying pigs), both of which have wings.
    -   _Mo' Creatures_ includes pegasi as one of the breedable horse types. They're obtained by giving an Essence of Light to a bat horse (itself a bat-winged example of this trope) above cloud level. Giving a pegasus an Essence of Darkness above cloud level will turn it into a fireproof dark pegasus. You can also make a zombie pegasus with an Essence of Undead, which will rot into a skeletal pegasus over time. It will still fly.
-   _Phelios_ is an arcade shooter where your titular character, rather than piloting a spaceship, instead rides a winged horse and fire energy blasts at enemies like dragons, harpies, and other airborne fantasy monsters.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Nightbound_: A premium scene with Nik in Chapter 13 has him say that not only do pegasi exist in the bayou, but he was hired to wrangle one. They have a much better disposition than unicorns do.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   _Codex Inversus_: Pegasi are winged horses that fly thanks to a natural anti-gravity property in their bones. They descend from celestial horses that soared through Heaven before the Collapse. In the modern day, the Angelic Unison has spent a great deal of effort in maintaining careful breeding programs to prevent the pegasi's surviving bloodlines from being corrupted by the realities of earthly ecology like other heavenly animals were.
-   _SCP Foundation_: SCP-042 is a pegasus that somehow lost his wings, and, because of that, he is now suicidally depressed and tries to get Foundation personnel to put him out of his misery.
-   _Thalia's Musings_: Pegasus is featured as a gift from Athena to Thalia and the other Muses.
    
    "I created him to be used in battle, but I made him such a brilliant tactician that his riders can't get him to cooperate. He thinks he knows better, and he usually does. But he doesn't know anything about the arts or sciences. He'll get along great with you and your sisters."
    
-   _UniCreatures_: Two of the creature families are pegasi. There is also a winged _zebra_.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse_: The eponymous foursome have been traveling through the forest for a while when the horse drops a surprise on the others out of nowhere: he can fly. Sure enough, he magically sprouts wings, then flies his companions to the village the boy has been searching for.
-   _Corn & Peg_: Of the two title characters, the latter is a Pegasus, with the former being a Unicorn.
-   _The Mighty Hercules_: Hercules has a pegasus that started out untamed until Herc tamed it and made it an ally.
-   _My Little Pony_: Pegasi have appeared throughout the history of the franchise as one of the "standard" variants of ponies alongside unicorns and unadorned earth ponies.
    -   _My Little Pony: The Movie (1986)_: The Flutter Ponies are an unusual example, as they have iridescent wings like those found on insects and not the feathered, birdlike wings of pegasi.
    -   _My Little Pony (G3)_ has both the regular Pegasus Ponies and the insectoid Breezies.
    -   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Pegasi are one of the main three races of ponies, along with unicorns and good old earth ponies. Aside from flight, pegasi possess a natural ability to control the weather and walk on clouds; they're consequently responsible for managing Equestria's day-to-day weather, and a large number of them live in the floating city of Cloudsdale, built entirely out of clouds.
        -   Two of them, Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy, are part of the main cast. Rainbow Dash in particular is an incredibly talented flier, most notably being able to easily break what is depicted as the sound barrier, to the point of doing it as for Mundane Utility. Fluttershy, on the other hand, is (usually) a fairly poor flyer who happens to be deathly afraid of heights, though this is compensated by her great skill with animals (something more commonly found in earth ponies) and the powerful Stare.
        -   Scootaloo is one of the Cutie Mark Crusaders and an example of a flightless pegasus; her wings are seemingly underdeveloped, and she cannot manage more than a few seconds of hovering. However, she's also depicted as being able to use her wings to propel herself at very high speeds on her scooter.
        -   The changelings are a rather creepy variation. They are vaguely equine, love-eating, shapeshifting monsters with fangs, bodies full of _holes_, and torn, insectoid wings. In other words, they are horseflies.
        -   The breezies also reappear, although their insectoid wings, very small size and more stylized and slender bodies than their G3 incarnations had make them more like an equine take on fairies than anything else.
        -   _My Little Pony: Friends Forever_: One comic includes a "pigasus", a green pig with feathered wings.
    -   _My Little Pony (Generation 5)_: The pegasi live in the mountaintop city of Zephyr Heights alongside a variety of animals resembling regular ones but with feathered wings, and are the only group with a significant military presence in the form of guards in Greco-Roman armor. They lost their ability to fly with the fading of magic from the world, with the exception of their royal family in theory; in practice, the royals also can't fly and use wires, staging and lighting to pretend in order to keep up morale. At the end of the movie, the return of magic restores their flight.
-   _The Smurfs (1981)_ character Blue Eyes, who appears in a few episodes as Smurfette's friend, is a pegasus allegedly voiced by an uncredited Patty Maloney.
-   _South Park_: Pegasus appears as a character in the _Imaginationland_ trilogy, among the fictional characters.
