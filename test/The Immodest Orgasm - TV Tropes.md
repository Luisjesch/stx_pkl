**Lt. B'Elanna Torres:** How the hell do you know when we're having "intimate relations"?!  
**Seven of Nine:** _\[deadpan\]_ There is no one on Deck 9, Section 12 who _doesn't_ know when you are having intimate relations.

When a woman has an orgasm, it can be very, very loud. As in, loud enough to break glass and drown out any other sound on the audio track. The louder the noises she makes, the more she's enjoying it, and hence the better the sex. Can result in hilarious moments when other people start taking notice of the noise.

The inversion of The Modest Orgasm. Often combined with Calling Your Orgasms. Compare The Grunting Orgasm, the Spear Counterpart. Most examples involve either a Rapid-Fire "Yes!", a Big "YES!", or a Big "OMG!" (in fact, the caption for the page image used to read, "The ultimate Big "YES!"").

This trope is almost ubiquitous in hentai and, especially in H-manga and doujins, is often paired with an exaggerated O-face called _ahegao_ (アヘ顔).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

As a trope, The Immodest Orgasm is a bit logistically easier to write than The Modest Orgasm because there's just more to describe. Moaning and groaning and screaming are good to keep the action moving, whereas The Modest Orgasm needs the author to relay the lover's more subtle cues.

May overlap with a Fake Orgasm, when a pretender particularly hams up their ruse.

Truth in Television for some people, but particularly over-the-top examples may result in Anatomically Impossible Sex.

    Advertising 

-   In one commercial a woman is shown a place by a real estate agent, and she proceeds to test it out by screaming and moaning loudly as if she was having an orgasm, which confuses the agent to no end. Apparently, she was testing the thickness of walls, as the neighbors immediately start complaining. She shrugs it off and decides not to buy the place.
-   This condom commercial demonstrates the _other_ reason why you don't want to have sex around your children.
-   The old Herbal Essences commercials used the phrase 'A totally organic experience' and showed a woman shampooing her hair (or having it shampooed by one or more hunky guys) and shouting 'YES, YES, OH!!' In one spot, as the hunky guys are leaving, the woman reminds them that 'the bottle says repeat'.
    -   On the flip side, in one commercial a man tries the shampoo out, resulting in a quick Grunting Orgasm.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Gender inverted in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    -   The one who gives the scream is Japan, a male. China hears him _from the other side of the sea_! One can just imagine how LOUD the sex was...
        
        **China:** You're just way too loud, aru!
        
    -   A possible other male example in France, who seems to give a scream for pleasure at the end of the talking portion of his Image Song, after sounding increasingly...excited while speaking. For an extra bonus, he talks about "our mutual feelings rising with wine" and "the beginning of the show".
-   In the second 2012 Golden Age movie of _Berserk_, we hear Princess Charlotte get pretty loud when Griffith takes her virginity. The manga implies that she was really loud during her first time as well.
-   One episode of _Bikini Warriors_ features the girls getting covered in eels at one point. Paladin get one squirming around in her panties, leading to this reaction.
-   In _Black Blood Brothers_, getting bitten by a vampire induces incredible pleasure which results in an immodest orgasm.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_:
    -   It's how Athena chose to defeat her sister, Artemis, during their duel in chapter 9. Since they were evenly matched in direct combat, Athena gains the upper hand by suddenly making out with her. Then capitalized on Artemis' shame and confusion by 69ing with her 'til her sister climaxed. It gets a full page spread, complete with lightning bolts in the background, amidst Artemis' screams.
    -   During the _"Amazing Eighth Wonder Vol.1"_. Clara gets possessed by a phallic parasite that causes its host to seek out strong, fertile women. It ends up choosing her mother, Athena. Clara uses her super-speed to create physical copies of herself to gangbang her and ultimately gives the MILF of Steel the mother of all orgasms; causing both of them to pass out from it.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Ghost Talker's Daydream_: It was inevitable, given Misaki's line of work, but she had her first one on the job when one of her regulars took her by surprise and went down on her. Judging from the montage of images, including a close-up of her fingers entwined in the straps on the back of Shimamura's mask, and ends with her screaming, while arching her back... it was a good one. She even thanks his ghost for it, at the end of the chapter.
-   _Haganai_:
    -   Rika is shown to have a fetish for machinery as well as being the resident Lovable Sex Maniac. In her introductory episode, she demonstrates her fetish by presenting a doujin with lookalikes of ZZ Gundam and Evangelion Unit-02 battling each other in space — and reading it out loud like she was doing voiceover for yaoi. At the end, one of the combatants is destroyed by a BFG and Rika screams "**UNIVEEEEERSE!**" at the top of her lungs.
    -   There's also when she has a yaoi fantasy about Kodaka and Yukimura, ending with Rika crying out "**EXCALIBUUUUR!**". Or when she imagines _herself_ in progressively skimpier swimsuits, ending with imagining herself completely naked; cue "**PRIDE-OH!**"
-   _Highschool of the Dead_: Saeko either had one — or was close to it — near the end of the 9th episode. She becomes sexually aroused by Takashi nearly crushing her breast, during his speech to keep her from allowing herself to be killed. Then takes his words to heart and embraces her true nature, where she proceeds to cut a swath through the attacking horde. In the end, she smiles and exclaims, **"YES!!"**<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In the first episode of _Irresponsible Captain Tylor_, Tylor somehow manages to cause a psych-evaluation AI to have an orgasm, and as a result fries a fairly large-sized defensive mainframe.
-   In _Kaiba_, a woman named Parm is escorting the amnesiac hero somewhere, but borrows his body (not him, in this universe people can be put in and out of different bodies). She uploads her own memories on him and...uh, yeah. She is _very loud_. Then she explodes!
-   Kanna, from _Koe de Oshigoto!_ has these whenever she gets into her eroge trance, which lends to her becoming a talented eroge seiyuu, but causes extreme embarrassment as her co-workers know full well that her orgasms are both immodest _and_ genuine.
-   _Maken-ki!_:
    -   The unnamed waitress featured in the 70.5 omake chapter has one when Love Espada sucks spilt tea off her fingers. It draws the attention of the entire cafe; especially when Espada asks the waitress if she'd like to return the favor.
    -   The 103.5 omake chapter takes place at a bathhouse. Wherein, Usui and Minori play a prank on Ms. Aki by pulling a bath towel back and forth between her legs, until Aki squirts and collapses from it. But when he tries the same stunt on Minori, she kicks him just as she's on the brink of orgasm, herself. It snaps Usui awake, revealing he had fallen asleep in the furo.
-   _Manyu Hikencho_: Kagefusa forces Kaede to have one, during the first episode, as punishment for choosing to side with Chifusa against the Manyuu Clan. The camera cuts away to a shot of the night sky as Kaede screams, after which, she faints. The scene ends with a shot of Kaede's raised hindquarters to show that her fundoshi is soaked, along with a matching damp spot on the ground.
-   Near the end of _My Balls_, young!Michael and Satan have sex with the purpose of purifying her; this trope happens, including a Pillar of Light.
-   _Monster Musume_:
    -   Just a little over two minutes into the first episode, Miia has an enormous orgasm after Kimihito continuously rubs the end of her tail (which happens to be her sweet spot); Later, in episode 6, she almost has another while Kimihito helps her shed her old skin.
    -   Suu has a habit of giving these from female characters whenever she's feeling thirsty or aggressive by wrapping herself around her chosen victim and raping them.
-   _Naruto_: Karin can replenish others’ chakra and also heal even serious injuries by letting others bite her. The use of this technique arouses her, but that might just be because she is bitten on-screen only by Sasuke, the target of her stalking/crush.
-   _Negima Magister Negimagi_:
    -   The series has this during an I Didn't Mean to Turn You On moment involving Chachamaru. When Negi starts replenishing her power by winding the key in the back of her head, he overdoes it and she's unable to contain the feel. The key winding makes a reappearance in chapter 263, with even more subtext than there was the first time. Naturally, Negi is still completely oblivious to what he's doing. It doesn't help that after the fact she says:
        
        **Chachamaru:** Still... Th-that sensation was the real thing... Negi-sensei's magical power... was so... so...
        
    -   Asakura, on the other hand, knows exactly what she's doing, and appears very Semeish in doing so. Sayo just looks embarrassed, like she's walked in on them.
-   In _No Game No Life_, Jibril lets Sora rub her wings (an erogenous zone for flugels). Her response echoes loudly throughout her giant library.
-   Occurs in the _One Piece_ anime, Boa Hancock gets glomped by Luffy (not for the usual reasons) and the result is... Interesting.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_'s original soundtrack has the tracks "Pantscada" (used in the teaser trailer) and "Juice".
    -   Used very frequently with Panty. Gender inversion with Brief in the last episode, yelling Panty's name.
    -   Another song from the second soundtrack has the track ''Beverly Hills Cock Part 2", which consists entirely of a man going, "Fuck, oh", with the occasional gasp.
-   _Queen's Blade: Vanquished Queens_: Leina is forced to have several, after being captured by Werebella, who inserts a spider-like symbiot into Leina's vagina which turns the victim's shame into sexual arousal<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Then stripped Leina naked and paraded her around on a leash in front of Lilliana's crewmen, so they could ridicule her. Leina's attempts to feign indifference at being humiliated in such a manner caused the symbiote to rapidly change color, which brought her to orgasm several times in their presence. The last was so intense, she nearly passed out from it, which added to her shame and briefly caused her to lose the will to fight.
-   In _Rosario + Vampire_, during Tsukune's training with Ruby, the two of them were chained together and, anytime Tsukune lost control over his power, the excess would get siphoned off into Ruby causing a very painful experience. She loved it!
-   _Sengoku Basara_: The image at the top is Kasuga's usual reaction when she gets congratulated for her achievements by Kenshin. It's parodied in the second season of the anime when Masamune and his crew can see the explosion of glowing rose petals a mile away.
-   _Shimoneta_: From episode 4 onwards, this happens to Anna with such regularity that it quickly becomes one of the defining aspects of her character. Each instance is accompanied by drooling, blushing, and squirting.
-   Mio has several of these in episode 2 of _The Testament of Sister New Devil_ while under an arousal curse by Maria. Afterwards, Maria mentions "9 times" while wiping a wet spot off the floor after she forced Basara to grope her to make her submit.
-   Ayana from the ecchi-bordering-on-hentai<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  manga _Kagaku na Yatsura_ is _very_ prone to these, given her enormous, super-sensitive breasts and frequent encounters with tentacle monsters, living clothes, tentacle monsters, rampaging massage devices, roving packs of horny guys in the street, roving packs of horny _girls_ in the street, her pervy sister, horny earthworms, and more tentacle monsters. She usually has at least one per chapter, often several.
-   In _Pop Team Epic_, Popuko's voice actor randomly has one of these during the "I grow when given attention" skit, repeatedly moaning and saying "Marilyn Monroe" over and over. Meanwhile, Popuko herself remains perfectly still. Don't ask.
-   _Tales of Wedding Rings_: Implied in chapter 61. The rest of the party clears out so Hime and Satou can have a private Pre-Climax Climax. When the two of them rejoin the party the next morning, Hime's sister Morion quips that last night was something else, making Hime realize, to her embarrassment, that everyone could hear her.

    Comic Books 

-   Carina and Korvac, during _The Korvac Saga_, two Energy Beings with human form, mixing together. Carina's head was still human and seemed so... see for yourself<small>◊</small>. All this was still under the rule of the infamous Comics Code, mind you.
-   Empowered, also thanks to the fact that her super suit gives her multiple orgasms at the drop of a hat.
-   World star soprano Kriemhild Nastrowa in _Wie Die Karnickel_ by Ralf König screams the usual "oh yes" thing during the procedure, and her orgasms are marked by her uttering snippets from arias. The trope is then played with: turns out Nastrowa has just as little restraint in an opera backstage locker as home — but after she has loudly finished, she defies the trope from her partner, warning him not to even peep lest someone hears.
-   In _Justice_ it is briefly suggested that Black Canary's orgasms are so loud, Green Arrow routinely wears earplugs during sex. (Canary's voice is a weapon, you see...)
    -   Also shows up in Paul Dini's _Black Canary/Zatanna: Bloodspell_. Canary screams so loud while having sex with Green Arrow that she shatters a vase.
-   Played for the lulz by French cartoonist Gotlib. A woman calls a doctor because her boyfriend rha-lovely'ed so loud that it cracked her eardrums. She explains that "it happened during sex because her boyfriend has such a large organ". Misunderstanding ensues... (Original pun is in French, naturally, but it more or less works in English and German translation too.)
-   _X-Men_: Kitty Pryde and Colossus finally consummated their relationship, Kitty's phasing powers kicked in mid-coitus and she ended up in the TV lounge...which was full of other students.
-   In issue 2 of _Friday The 13th: Pamela's Tale_, Claudette, when she and Barry are having sex:
-   _Fine Print_:
    -   When Heureca tries to hold in her orgasm during the "ritual of crowning", it ends in a bright pink explosion that leaves a pink, geode-like crater.
    -   Lauren screams in pleasure when Merryl has sex with her, as it's the best she's ever had (the latter being a sex goddess, this isn't too surprising). Other sex scenes earlier also imply that she's loud generally when climaxing.

-   In _Glorious Shotgun Princess_, after Shepard crashes on an ice planet but survives thanks to becoming Exalted, she explores her strange new abilities, such as the power to "punchsplode" people, chop spacecraft in half with her bare hands by accident, and run up the side of an avalanche. One other improvement that she discovers after the geth with Legion — er, no, _Wuffles_ — find her and begin helping involves a jury-rigged hot tub and a discarded thermal clip. The geth outside register the results as a _seismic event_, and she dents the metal in the hot tub with her bare hands and feet, and the orgasm lasts an _hour_. Shepard is...embarrassed when Wuffles starts asking questions.
-   There's a short _Supernatural_ fanfic floating around that ascribes this trait to Castiel. Attempting to quiet him — even _gagging_ him — doesn't work: it's not his human body that's doing it, it's his true form, which interprets sex as something akin to religious ecstasy.
-   Thanks to them forgetting to use soundproofing spells in _TD the Alicorn Princess_, Celestia and TD's newfound relationship instantly gets discovered by all the palace staff.
-   _From Bajor to the Black_: The only-vaguely-described (PG-13-ish) sex scene between First-Person Smartass Kanril Eleya and her soon-to-be-boyfriend Jerrod Dalton includes a reference to her "screaming aloud as he takes me."

-   Referenced in _The Lovers Left Broken_ when Thea reveals to Oliver she's always been able to hear things through the Queen Mansion walls.
    
    **Oliver:** Wait a minute, does that mean you've always been able to hear... things?  
    **Thea:** Yes. Just out of curiosity, who was the screamer? Laurel or Sara? Or, I'm sorry, was that you?
    
-   In _Thousand Shinji_, Asuka isn't quiet _at all_. When she and Shinji were about to make love for the first time she demanded loudly to be taken.
    
    **Asuka:** HOLY FUCK! Sweet merciful! Don't... do... don't... holy SHIT! Oh wow... oh wow... oh fuck! Fuck Shinji, you keep this up and sex will be a letdown!  
    **Shinji:** I doubt that. It will just be one more appendage to work with.  
    **Asuka:** Oh God! Oh God, you're a fucking octopus already! Oh, sweet Khorne take me now!
    
-   Genkan the yuki-onna has one in Chapter 96 of _Freakin Gensokyo_.

-   In the _Total Drama_ fanfic, _Courtney's Crusade for Redemption_, the older Courtney comments that she lives very close to Heather and Alejandro, and that she's unlucky enough to hear whenever they have a heavy argument or sex, both of which happen frequently.
-   In the _How to Train Your Dragon_ fanfic _A Thing of Vikings_, this is used to the point of being a Running Gag. Evidently Hiccup and Astrid are quite vocal during their lovemaking sessions after they get engaged, with Stoick reflecting that some nights the only hope he has of getting any rest is if he falls asleep before Hiccup and Astrid go at it. Once Wulfhild joins them in bed, she turns out to be as loud as they are.
    
    **Astrid:** We're taking you home.  
    **Wulfhild:** And we're going to make you make us sing your praises.  
    **Astrid:** Are we done, chief?  
    **Stoick**: _\[laughing\]_ Far be it for me to suggest otherwise! Take him away, ladies!  
    **Hiccup:** But I have a terrible singing voice!  
    **Astrid:** That's all right. We have other uses for your mouth.
    
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   Both Vegeta and Bulma do this in episode 34 — Vegeta even fires his Galick Gun through the roof during it!
    -   Revisited in a deleted scene from their Abridged version of _Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks_, with Gohan and Bulma doing it this time. Gohan fires his Masenko through the roof.
    -   And again in episode 55 with Goku and Chi Chi. Goku fires his Kamehameha through the roof — is anyone noticing a pattern here?
    -   To end off episode 60 part 3, Krillin and Android 18. Krillin launches his Scatter Bullet through the roof of Kame House. It ends up destroying his Owned Counter, just to show how lucky he's gotten.
-   In the first chapter of _The Eternity Effect_, Glinda's parents not-so-subtly bring up the topic that she and her girlfriend Elphaba are too loud.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: The night before the final battle, Blake, Pyrrha, and Ruby all show up at Ren's room and ask to sleep there. Why? Because it's the farthest from Jaune and Yang's room.
    
    **Blake:** Let's just say that Yang has a healthy pair of lungs.
    
-   In the Harry Potter story _The Chosen Six_, Sirius and his fiancée Diane make love for the first time after he had proposed to her. She proves to be so loud, that Vernon as their direct neighbor calls the police due to nightly disturbance. Once the Bobbies in turn realize who is so loud (these two are their co-workers) they decide it's to better ignore the matter.
-   In the NSFW _RWBY_ fanfic _One Night in Atlas,_ Yang appears to believe that the point of sex is to make absolutely sure that everyone within a mile knows who you're having sex with. Weiss is only slightly quieter, and soon after she and Jaune have Their First Time they have to deal with Penny knocking on the door asking if they're okay. On the other hand, Genki Girl Nora is _shockingly_ quiet, to the point that no one noticed when she and Ren started having sex (though everyone figured it out quickly).
-   At the end of _At Odds_, once Beast Boy returns from his Earth-saving mission, Raven wastes no time before teleporting them both to her room. The rest of the team immediately decides to take the T-car and go search for a quieter place.
-   In _This Means War_ by Jeconais, once Voldemort is defeated at the end, Harry states he needs Ginny to help him with getting out of his very tight dragonhide pants and they walk away. The rest of the fic is people being impressed and annoyed at them not putting up a Silencing Charm.
-   _The Simpsons_ fanfic _Lay All Your Love On Me_ contains a Rare Male Example with Waylon Smithers. For years, he had been pining after his boss, Charles Montgomery Burns, and one night, Burns finally returns his affections and makes love to him. The resulting orgasm is so overwhelming and so intense that it's described as "mind-shattering" and "a sensation that man was not meant to feel, but one that years of intense longing finally paying off would inevitably result in", is punctuated by a _very_ loud scream followed by eight consecutive hearts, and results in a brief Heroic BSoD.
-   _A Well-Intentioned Blocking_ ascribes this trait to Lan Xichen, who is apparently loud enough that most of the Unclean Realm knows that the Venerated Triad are lovers.
    -   Jin Guangyao is apparently also...audible for a distance.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Sausage Party_: This is how the Sex Montage, er, climaxes. Loud enough to scare a whole flock of birds off the roof.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _About Alex_, this is played for laughs. Sarah's first tryst with Josh is clearly audible to everyone in the house, and is both cringe-worthy and contributes to the tension when nobody can sleep because of it.
-   As Tina and Rod climax in _A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)_, Glen has to listen to it through the walls after he and Nancy decide not to have sex.
    
    **Glen:** Morality sucks.
    
-   From Hong Kong, the early Stephen Chow movie _All's Well Ends Well_, already chock full of blatant references to Hollywood movies manages a subtle but effective one of the 'I'll have what she's having' scene from _When Harry Met Sally..._. An Immodest Orgasm that resulted from _a foot massage_, no less.
-   _Amélie_:
    -   Amélie wonders how many women are having an orgasm at a particular moment (_"Quinze!"_).<sup>Translation&nbsp;</sup>  This is represented by a montage of women moaning and wailing loudly — all except the last, who quietly mutters "ooh!"
    -   Georgette and Joseph having sex in the cafe's lavatory room thanks to Amélie "accidentally" spilling coffee on Georgette. They are doing it so intensely that the electric lights are flickering and the glasses on the bar are shaking. There is a loud, sustained high-pitched scream like a boiling kettle, too. Noticing some elderly patrons staring with concern at the lavatory door, Amélie turns on a cappuccino steamer to camouflage the noise.
-   In _Antonia's Line_, at one moment in the house, all couples are extremely loud at the same time, resulting in the young Therèse walking into the hallway in the middle of the night, rubbing her eyes, and yelling "I can't sleep!"
-   Jody and Yvette's sex scene in _Baby Boy_. She nearly brings the roof down, compared to him making a few soft grunts.
-   In _Beetlejuice_ the ghosts are trying to scare the mother by dressing in sheets and moaning loudly. The daughter in the next room yells to her parents to quiet down.
    
    **Lydia:** Knock if off, I'm a child for God's sake!
    
-   _The Big Wedding_:
    -   Don and Ellie enjoy _forty minutes_ of sex together, after which they both loudly orgasm, with the guests nearby hearing.
    -   Nuria and Jared also later get very loud as they climax, with other people hearing from outside.
-   Mel Brooks loved exploiting Madeleine Kahn's singing chops to achieve this trope with great effect:
    -   In _Blazing Saddles_, Lily Von Schtupp breaks into one of these during her Sex–Face Turn with Sheriff Bart. A cut line reveals she was sucking his elbow. There's probably a good reason they cut that.
    -   Parodied in _Young Frankenstein_ by Elizabeth when the Monster first... well, _assaults_ her, and so pleased is she that she exclaims _**"OHHHHH, SWEET MYSTERY OF LIFE, AT LAST I'VE FOUND YOUUUUUUU...."**_ At the end of the movie Inga gets her turn when Frederick reveals what he got from the monster during their transfer.
-   The Spanish horror film _The Blood Spattered Bride_ includes a scene where two lesbian vampires make love very loudly.
-   At the beginning of _Cabin Fever_, the cliche horny couple retire to the bedroom for some horizontal aerobics. As the man's countdown gets close to blastoff, the woman flips on top of him. Though not explicitly shown, it's implied she does some finger-spelunking to the guy from behind. She asks him if he likes it until he very loudly responds in the affirmative. Later inverted during the far more vigorous second sex scene.
-   In _Catch Me If You Can_, the stewardess Frank Abagnale bangs cries "YES!" very intensely...the sex is so intense, things fall off their shelves.
-   _Children of the Corn (2009)_ features a ceremonial sex/conception scene in which a young woman lays upon a church alter and gets screwed by her lover/husband, in front of the entire village congregation. As the scene progresses, she moans louder and louder until she's just about shouting herself hoarse. Meanwhile, the village of mostly barely-pubescent boys who are watching it dance and jump around excitedly.
-   _Compulsion (2013)_: Amy is quite loud while having sex with Fred, her fiance.
-   In _Delicatessen_ (1991) a couple is having sex on very creaky, noisy bedsprings in a large decaying wooden apartment block. The rhythm is infectious and as the camera (discreetly) jumps from room to room we see other activities, such as painting a ceiling, all take on the same beat. The climax comes in an orgasm audible throughout the building, loud enough to knock the painter right off his ladder.
    -   The rhythm-imitating activities include a man pumping a bicycle tyre, an old woman knitting and rocking on her rocking chair, the butcher's daughter playing the cello, and two brothers making sheep-imitating toys.
    -   The Grunting Orgasm: And it's Big Bad Clapette doing the epic scream.
-   _The Dirty Dozen_: Discussed trope. Maggot is surprised infiltrating the chateau by the lady friend of one of the German officers. She tries to seduce him, but unfortunately for her, Maggot is the resident crazy misogynist of the bunch. She screams, he stabs her slowly, every German soldier in the house hears... but they all assume someone's having fun and laugh about it.
-   Played with in _Enemy at the Gates_; during the sex scene, Rachel Weisz's character is clearly experiencing a powerful orgasm which would normally lead to one of these, but because she and Jude Law's character are having sex in a crowded barracks surrounded by hundreds of soldiers it would be somewhat inconvenient and embarrassing for her to 'release' it, so he covers her mouth with his hand.
-   Cynthia Van Damme in the obscure softcore flick _Emmanuelle's Magic_ does an over-the-top scream complete with an echoing Effect.
-   _The Fifth Element_:
    -   Played for laughs when Ruby Rhod plays an audio clip of a bit character noblewoman's "talented voice" (his words).
    -   A flight stewardess's screaming climax at Ruby's hands syncs up with the spaceplane's engines igniting and Zorg blowing up Right-Arm.
    -   The huge beam of light shooting out of Leeloo's mouth to stop the dark planet. It turns out that the fifth element is not (as many assumed) the Power of Love; it was revealed by Word of God that the fifth element is in fact sex.
-   In _Fight Club_, Marla begins to shake the house when she screws Tyler. She hadn't been fucked like that since grade school.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Forgetting Sarah Marshall_, Peter and his new date, and the titular Ms. Marshall and her new beau, try to outdo each other in loudness. It's also subverted towards the beginning with Peter's one-night-stand woman who just goes, "Mm. Mm. Mm," in a monotone, then says flatly, "I just came." She's not being sarcastic, she's just not that excited about it.
-   _Friday the 13th (2009)_: Trent and Bree (particularly the latter) do a lot of shouting and moaning as they near the conclusion of their sex.
-   In _Friends with Benefits_, when Dylan goes down on Jamie, she screams so loud that it freaks him out:
    
    **Dylan:** What's wrong?
    
    **Jamie:** NOTHING!
    
    **Dylan:** Well, when women scream, it can be misconstrued!
    
    **Jamie:** JUST KEEP GOING!
    
-   In _Gunmen_ starring Christopher Lambert and Mario van Peebles, Lambert's character has sex with a prostitute who is very, _very_ loud. She is also credited as "Orgasmic Hooker". What, you think I'm lying?.
-   _The Hour of the Pig_: Maria gets very loud when she comes to climax while having sex with Courtois.
-   _Judas Kiss_: When Coco and Junior have sex immediately after the kidnapping, Coco's orgasmic cries can be heard by the rest of the gang no matter where they are in the house: to the extent that Lizard puts on headphones in an attempt to drown her out.
-   _The Little Death_: Rowena screams when climaxing multiple times with Richard as he's crying, which is her fetish.
-   The _Mädchen Mädchen_ films feature this:
    -   In the first movie, Inken (who has, at this point, never had an orgasm) discovers that her bike has a serendipitously high seat.
    -   The second movie has this happen to Inken again: after being thoroughly unsatisfied by a neighbour, she invokes this (by yelling and banging herself against the wall) to trick him into thinking she's having the best sex ever.
-   _The Miseducation of Cameron Post_: Coley, Cameron's girlfriend, gets pretty loud while Cameron is having sex with her. Later on Cameron also gets loud herself while having sex with Erin.
-   _Modern Problems_ has Fiedler acquire telekinetic powers by accident. After a session of so-so sex, he goes to the kitchen to make himself a sandwich. While there, Fiedler uses his powers to bring Darcy to climax several times. The goofier Fiedler's face, the more intense Darcy's orgasm.
-   In the hip-hop comedy, _House Party 2_, Play closes the record store he manages early just so he can have sex with a random woman he met earlier in the same day, under the false pretenses that he’ll let her sing backup on his demo record in return. The sex results in a screaming orgasm so loud and manic, that it literally causes an earthquake. When they stop so he can answer a call from Kid, regarding his lost scholarship check — the woman stops moaning as does the earthquake. Once he hangs up and resumes having sex with her, the earthquake starts up again in sync with her moaning. She later comes to regret this, when she reappears again late in the film and angrily confronts Play about not getting her chance to sing like he promised. She is not seen or alluded to again after that.
-   In _My Super Ex-Girlfriend_, the sex scene at the end finished with a hole in the wall.
-   _Nekromantik 2_ plays with this a little, as the main character works in a studio that is dubbing grunts and orgasmic screams onto porn movies.
-   The events of _Pleasantville_ take place in the world of a TV show. This world is rather flexible and responsive to strong human emotions, so when a female character has an orgasm for the first time in her life (it's a very tame show), a tree outside of her house _spontaneously combusts_ (and the fire department knows not what to do, since there was never a fire on the show). Funnily, she never actually _says_ anything dirtier than "Oh my goodness!"
-   In _Porky's_, Ms. "Lassie" Honeywell (Kim Cattrall) earned her nickname for a reason. She _howls_. Loud enough to disrupt class, even.
-   _Ruthless People_: The prostitute having sex with Chief Benton. When they proceed to "get it on", her screams are so loud that Earl Mott — who's _expecting_ to tape a woman being murdered — is squicked.
    
    **Chief Benton:** I like a woman who makes a lot of sound.  
    **Prostitute:** Well, I'll scream my head off if I want to, honey. It's your money.  
    **Chief Benton:** Yeah, my wife just lays there like a gunnysack.
    
-   In the early Michael J. Fox film _The Secret of My Success_, Fox's character Brantley has moved to the city and is living in a crappy apartment, complete with incredibly loud, horny neighbors. At one point, when they're getting it on while he's trying to work, he goes to the fridge for a beer, grabs a stick, taps a few times on a desk, and begins conducting them as the man begins thrusting hard into his partner. He can mouth along with their dirty talk, and cracks his (overflowing) beer right at the moment of climax. Then he sits down at his desk and says, "You guys were good tonight."
-   The two lovers in the airplane lavatory in _Snakes on a Plane_. Then the snakes attack and her screaming is for a different reason.
    
    **Stewardess:** Man, he is _good_.
    
-   Stu and O.T. and the girls in the Corvette in _Spring Break_
-   Creepy (or hot) in _The Stepford Wives_, given that the woman in question was a robot.
-   _Warm Water Under a Red Bridge_ by Imamura Shohei features a woman whose orgasms are so spectacular, her vaginal fluids pour out like flowing water (hence the title).
-   In _What Lies Beneath_, the next-door neighbors are having what Norman refers to as "Sexual Olympics".
-   _When Harry Met Sally..._: Sally proves to Harry the ability of women to effectively fake orgasms by doing one of these while she's eating lunch with him. This elicits stares from the rest of the patrons. Then Sally casually returns to eating her meal, and one woman (played by the director's mother) tells her waitress "I'll have what she's having!" A line now ranked #33 in the American Film Institute's list of the Top 100 Movie Quotations in American cinema. When Estelle Reiner died at age 94 in 2008, _The New York Times_ obituary for her called her "the woman who delivered one of the most memorably funny lines in movie history". Katz's Deli, where this scene was filmed, has a sign above the table that says, "Where Harry met Sally... hope you have what she had!<small>◊</small>"
    -   In late 2013, Improv Everywhere, the New York City initiative behind the annual No Pants Day in the subways and various flash-mob stunts, convened and filmed a re-enactment of the scene in Katz's Delicatessen. While a look-alike couple performed the scene, 30 others joined as if it was contagious. Surprised staff and customers responded in appreciation.
-   In _100 Girls_, Patty has very loud orgasms, complete with screaming "Sweet leaping Jesus!".
-   Brazilian movie _De Pernas pro Ar_ has it twice. First, when the protagonist, an unhappy workaholic, uses a bunny sex toy to get her first orgasm (complete with a dream sequence where she is a roller coaster with said bunny!). Then, when she goes to her son's soccer game wearing panties that vibrate with music. (starts at 2:02)
-   In _I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell_, the cops are called to a report of sounds of animal abuse. When they arrive, they find Tucker Max having sex with a deaf girl.
-   Spoofed in _Easy A_. Brandon wants people to think he's straight, so he asks Olive to fake having sex with him at a party. This involves making funny sound effects, Olive hitting him repeatedly with a book, and doing jumping jacks on the bed.
    
    **Olive:** Ready for the big finale?  
    **Brandon:** What— _\[Olive punches him in the gut\]_ Ohhhhhh!
    
-   In _Network_, Diana emits a bizarre _squeal_.
-   A couple of them occur in _Hysteria_, including to an opera singer who hits some very high notes.
-   The main plot of _Bruce Almighty_ is a mortal man (Bruce) being given all God's powers, so long as he doesn't tell anyone or affect free will. Naturally he uses this power for sex. Whereas most people would simply get laid, Bruce is a bit more creative and uses his powers to give Grace the greatest spontaneous orgasm in history by chanting the word "pleasurable" to her over and over. If that wasn't enough immodest orgasming, she then literally jumps him, and we see the outside of their home as she moans loudly.
-   Discussed in the film _Watch It_:
    
    **Michael:** Was she vocal?  
    **Rick:** _Vocal_? She should have been a carnival barker, for crying out loud!  
    **Michael:** Are you telling me you weren't listening outside my door?  
    **Rick:** Well, sure, to a reasonable hour, but 3 am? "Oh my God, Michael. Oh my God, Michael! Oh, Oh, Oh, OH OH!" I mean, what are you **doing** to these girls, for Chrissakes?
    
-   Horribly juxtaposed in _Antichrist_ where the couple has an orgasm the second their infant son jumps out a window. That's only the opening scene, and things get even worse.

-   Xenia Onatopp in _GoldenEye_. She's very vocal in bed when she's killing an admiral by crushing his ribcage between her legs. It happens again during her fight with Bond in a sauna. She even is visibly orgasming loudly when massacring the Severnaya staffers with an assault rifle, treating her gun like a sex toy, and prompting General Ourumov to show a moment of concern. Her death scene involves her trying to subject Bond to this in the Cuban jungle, until Bond shoots down the helicopter that she's harnessed to, causing her to be whip-lashed backwards and crushed against a tree while emitting a scream that seems to blur the lines between a scream of orgasm and one of terror.
-   In _Middle Age Crazy_, The main character's wife screams out _Bingo!_ every time she comes while they're having sex.
-   In _The Addams Family_, while attending a charity auction, Gomez and Morticia became excited while bidding (on an item they themselves donated) and commence a spectacular grope-fest. The audience sees the auctioneer watching in apparent disgust as they paw at each other and the pair can be heard moaning uncontrollably off-camera.
-   _The Millennium Trilogy_: In _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo_, Lisbeth is very audibly enjoying herself when she and Mikael first have sex, although there's no screaming. This is in sharp contrast to her reactions to being raped by her legal guardian Bjurman earlier in the film.
-   The protagonist of _Turn Me On, Dammit_ can be very vocal when she masturbates (which is often). It is later revealed that her mother has heard her many times, much to the embarrassment of both of them.
-   _Soul Food_ features one from Lim. After summoning her, they head to the bathroom for a quickie. He's so loud when he's about to cum that Bird actually _stuffs her panties into his mouth to shut him up!_
-   _The Ugly Truth_: Mike gives Abby a pair of vibrator panties, and she wears them to a business meeting but loses the remote. A curious kid finds it and so Abby finds herself trying _very_ hard to converse and pass off her gasps casually.
-   The Swedish film _Together_ has one.
-   _The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie_. Right when the Senechals are going to make love, they hear their guests arriving downstairs. Alice says that the guests can wait five minutes, but her husband tells her that they can't make them wait because "You scream too loud."
-   _Rough Night_: Blair gets quite loud while Lea is eating her out.
-   _Winter Kills_: When she and Nick are having sex, Yvette moans so loudly that Nick covers her face with a pillow (though not a Vorpal Pillow) so she won't wake up the neighbors.
-   _Naomi And Ely's No Kiss List_: Naomi and Bruce 2 are tentatively getting engaged in foreplay before (Boy) Robin and a girl in the next room over start loudly having sex, stopping them.
-   _I Want You Back_: Emma and Peter hear Emma's roommates Paul and Lisa having sex through the wall, which only gets louder as both of them approach climax, including Paul loudly yell-asking where Emma wants "his love".
    
    **Peter:** ...I think that was the finale.
    
-   _Better Than Choclate_: Maggie, Carla and Lila all get pretty loud when they climax.

    Literature 

-   The Brinker-Smiths in _A Prayer for Owen Meany_ fit this to a T, with Owen quipping that sex makes people crazy.
-   In Michael Moorcock's _Gloriana_ (and in the loosely related _Hawkmoon_ series, where a Multiversal alternate of "Gloriana" is a central character) the titular queen is forever bemoaning the fact that she can't have orgasms, and because of the palace's peculiar acoustics the entire court can hear her. Of course, when she finally _does_ the entire court gets to hear that as well.
-   In John Irving's _The Hotel New Hampshire_, there is a Running Gag about "Screaming Annie", the hooker who fakes very loud orgasms. It would later come out they were not fake.
-   In John Irving's _The Cider House Rules_ another prostitute, Mrs. Eames ("rhymes with screams!"), is famed for her loud orgasms. (This seems to be a thing with Irving.)
-   Laurell K. Hamilton's _Anita Blake_ series is all about the immodest orgasms. This woman shrieks like a banshee every time a man so much as looks at her, and it's amazing nobody near her home or the Circus has complained yet about the bloodcurdling orgasm screeches.
-   Hinted at in _Red Dragon_. We never get to see the orgasm itself, but judging from the way Reba reacts to the _start_ of the sex, God alone knows what was happening at the end.
    
    **Reba:** _Come on. My God, man. That's so sweeet..._
    
-   In the _Culture_ novels, the titular Culture's members sometimes have body modifications that allow them to intensify their orgasms, sometimes drawing them out for tens of minutes to _hours_. One man who had only recently joined the Culture and was learning firsthand about their promiscuity was horrified by the protracted writhing and screaming, imagining that his semen acted like some kind of acid to her species.
-   Frank Yerby's novel _The Voyage Unplanned_ has a hilarious bit of comic relief when the hero's love interest accuses him of having induced this in another woman the night before. But the supposed other woman was a terrorist who tried to murder him, and the orgasmic screams actually came from the hotel room _**next**_ to his. He proves this by banging on the wall and calling:
    
    **John:** Hey, kids! Time's a-wasting! Or are you going to let one night wear you out?!  
    **Unnamed girl:** Eric! Oh my Gawd! The man next door! He — he _heard_ us!
    
-   Anne McCaffrey's _The Rowan_ gives us a telepathic variant: The Rowan and her lover, Jeff Raven, are having "a late breakfast" in her quarters. Then Afra, her second-in-command, discreetly informs her that she's "broadcasting". (Most Primes like The Rowan live and work in the same complex.)
-   The whore near the end of Michael Crichton's _Pirate Latitudes_ uses this as a signal when she is being used to distract the villain.
-   One of the interviewees in David Foster Wallace's _Brief Interviews With Hideous Men_ is compelled to shout "VICTORY FOR THE FORCES OF DEMOCRATIC FREEDOM!" whenever he achieves orgasm.
-   The title character of F.M. Busby's _Rissa Kerguelen_ series is prone to this with her husband, and a bit self-conscious about it. At one point, she refuses to make love with him because someone else is bedding down fairly near to them. She tells hubby something along the lines of, "Only you have heard me in full response," and she means to keep it that way.
-   _In Death_ series: _Innocent in Death_ has Eve and Peabody being told that Craig Foster, a murder victim, and his wife, Lissette, had a lot of sex, and Lissette tended to do this a lot!
-   For someone who is normally shy and reserved, Sarah, the main character in _Educating Sarah_, doesn't hold back when she's having an orgasm, even with a guy she just met.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_ has a few examples (unsurprising given how much sex there is):
    -   There's Ygritte when Jon Snow decides to "kiss her there". Afterwards, she rather shyly (very out of character for her) asks him if he'd give her "the lord's kiss" again.
    -   When Littlefinger marries Lysa Arryn, she tells him in front of everyone that she expects him to make her scream. He does, apparently with no effort whatsoever, and the rest of the household is killing themselves laughing.
    -   Apparently, Prince Baelon Targaryen's trysts with his sister-wife, Alyssa, were so passionate that Alyssa's screams could be heard as far away as Tyrosh, becoming a source of ribald humour among the courtiers of the Red Keep.
-   Simona Ahrnstedt combines this with The Grunting Orgasm in her sex scenes, and she's got plenty of them!
-   The fourth book about _The Witcher_ called _The Time of Contempt_ has Yennefer and Geralt share an intimate moment, causing the people in the nearby rooms to either swear or applaud.
-   _The Bronze Horseman_ by Paullina Simons. Tatiana's inability to stop herself from moaning loudly whenever Alexander is fondling her or making love to her is a Running Gag. Given that there's a shortage of privacy in the Soviet Union this is a problem.
-   _Patience and Sarah_: While staying at a lodging until they can find a farm to buy, Sarah notices that Patience won't sleep with her anymore. This makes her worry that Patience doesn't love her anymore, but the actual problem is that Sarah is too loud. Patience once had to make an excuse to their neighbors that Sarah was prone to nightmares.
-   _Serge Storms_: Serge's various romantic partners tend to loudly and expressively indicate when they near the end of lovemaking while Serge himself is distracted watching sunrises or chatting about local trivia.
    
    **Rachael** from _Atomic Lobster_: Yes!...Yes!...Faster!...Faster! Hurt me with your hot cock!
    
-   In _Shadow of the Conqueror,_ Taigo and Luciana go about their "cleansing ordinance" with wild abandon, which Daylen picks up from several kilometers away with his Super-Hearing.
-   Siri is forced to fake one in _Warbreaker_ because she's required to produce an heir to the God-King, who doesn't even approach her. Since the priests are listening but not watching, she jumps on the bed and moans loudly. It becomes Hilarious in Hindsight when it turns out that the God-King doesn't know what sex is and is mildly alarmed.
-   In _Always Coming Home_, the teller of the Visionary’s story talks at one point about her sister and her husband making a lot of noise in their lovemaking every night.
-   Whateley Universe: Any Poe girl who forgets to turn on the sound-dampening system before using the 'special features' of the Hydroflux showers is likely to get teased about it for a week.
-   _The Chronicles of Dorsa_:
    -   Tasia exclaims loudly as she climaxes while Joslyn goes down on her in their first time, despite wanting to keep quiet so no one nearby notices.
    -   At the end of book two, this happens again as Joslyn and she have sex when they had been apart a long time, despite wanting to keep quiet.
-   _The Change Room_: Eliza howls when Shar makes her climax in her apartment the first time, it's so good.
-   _Something to Talk About_: Emma screams when she climaxes while finally having sex with Jo. She's glad Jo has nobody close by her house so no one will hear her.
-   In the French short story "Le crime au père Boniface" by Guy de Maupassant, the postman goes for a delivery at the mayor's house and comes back frantic for help, claiming the man is torturing his wife. But when the sheriff checks on the house, he realizes the mayor's wife isn't screaming in _pain_.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Aside from the specific examples below, it's worth noting that the depiction of orgasm (immodest or otherwise) has become much more common in the rise of adult-themed programming produced for streaming and cable, but it's even finding its way into mainstream network offerings (in both US and UK) more often, particularly in post-watershed (or equivalent) programming.
-   _Boardwalk Empire_: In "Gimcrack and Bunkum", Margaret wakes up to a scream in the middle of the night. Her maid, Katy, denies hearing anything. As it turns out, it _was_ Katy, who was in the midst of having sex with Owen. The next morning, Margaret confronts Katy and warns her and Owen to be a bit more considerate since there are children in the household.
-   On one episode of _QI_ (first episode of season B) Alan Davies had this sound effect as his buzzer, in that show's tradition of (almost) always giving him the embarrassing buzzer sound effect.
-   Occurs at various times on _Sex and the City_, usually with Samantha (_also_ played by Kim Cattrall, making this a possible Shout-Out to her infamous _Porky's_ scene) who hit a high note that transitioned into an Opera scene. Something of a male version occurred when Charlotte was seeing a guy who, when coming, shouted "You FUCKING bitch, you FUCKING whore!" He was actually completely unaware of doing so until Charlotte pointed it out.
-   In _Farscape_ John bangs on the wall and makes shouting sounds to annoy Rygel. Aeryn tells him he was actually louder than that. There's also the time John walked in on D'Argo and Chiana while she was screaming (he might not have made that mistake if the walls on Moya were thinner).
-   Played with in _Rome_:
    -   Where Titus Pullo and Cleopatra are both pretty noisy during sex — but they're completely drowned out by Cleopatra's slaves, who set up an incredibly loud ululation to celebrate the occasion (and, presumably, to drown out the noise).
        -   According to the DVD Commentary, it's also to drive off evil spirits during conception, which is Cleopatra's goal.
        -   What really drives home the noise level is Lucius Vorenus trying to get some sleep in a nearby tent.
    -   Atia is also quite loud. Her daughter imitates this at least once when she's gotten irritated with her mother's shenanigans. There's also at least one scene where the camera cuts to different rooms of the house and the various house members reacting to her moans and screams.
        
        **Mark Antony:** _(To Atia)_ She has you exactly.
        
    -   Even funnier when you realize that she was just chastised by her mother for not making small talk with Antony at dinner, which Octavia follows up by asking Antony "Do my mother's screams (when he's having sex with her) irritate you?"
-   There's a variety show in Taiwan with a cooking segment, where the guests' reactions upon tasting the good food is accompanied by a romantically-charged Korean theme song. It's more of a ploy to get O-faces out of the predominantly attractive female guests.
-   Hilariously spoofed on _Spaced_ when Tim and Daisy make fake "sex noises" in order to keep up the ruse that they're a couple.
    -   At one point, Tim starts doing this while Daisy is on the phone with her long-distance boyfriend from Hull.
    -   It's been spoofed on numerous shows when the couple in question (often faking that they're in a relationship) for whatever reason wants others to think that they're having sex. Example: _Beverly Hills, 90210_. David and Valerie are pretending to get back together in order to make Donna and Noah, respectively, jealous enough to want them back. So they take her headboard and spend what seems like hours banging it against her wall. _Married... with Children_ does this also when Kelly's date wants to make his ex jealous, taking her into the bathroom and banging the garbage can against the wall. Kelly actually shows a sliver of self-respect by being thoroughly annoyed and disgusted at this and storming out, leaving the guy looking like an idiot.
-   Speaking of _Married... with Children_, there was also the scene in "Banking on Marcy" where she has an orgasm while giving a speech about economy. It must be seen to be believed.
-   _Spin City_:
    -   Slightly Downplayed when Mike apologizes to Stacy that his amorous neighbors can be heard Right Through the Wall. We hear said neighbors for a second. Stacy is filled with pity when she says "You think that's loud? Oh, Mike."
    -   Played straighter when Caitlin boasts that her own screams once set off three car alarms.
-   In _The Newsroom_ episode "Slow Leak", it is revealed that Jim Walcott's fiancé has such loud orgasms she lost her apartment due to noise complaints.
-   Happens often in _Rescue Me_. Of particular note is the episode in season 5, when Tommy and Janet make so much noise that everyone in the bed-and-breakfast comes out to the hall to see what's going on, just in time to see them break down the door.
-   The self-censorship of Ted in _How I Met Your Mother_ results in the description of The Immodest Orgasm with the Unusual Euphemism of "playing bagpipes". So instead of loud grunts and headboards hitting walls, the audience just hears bagpipes.
    -   "Shut the bagpipes up!"
    -   In a Season 1 episode, Barney meets up with his ex-girlfriend Shannon and boasts to the gang that he had sex with her. Lily didn't believe it and thought that he was making it up just to cope with the loss until Barney showed them a video as proof. Though the video is not shown on camera obviously, you can hear the sounds.
-   In a _Caroline in the City_ episode, Richard complains that he hasn't gotten any sleep for a week because the couple in the apartment above him has been having loud sex practically nonstop. He finally gets to talk to the man who lives above him and asks if he and his wife can tone the volume of their sex down a bit because he hasn't gotten any sleep for a week. The man replies that he's been out of town for a week. One dawning realization later, Richard scampers away embarrassed while the now angry man goes back into the apartment to confront his wife.
-   In the _Star Trek: Voyager_ episode "Someone to Watch over Me", B'Elanna catches Seven making notes about her relationship with Paris, and demands to know how Seven knew when they were having "intimate relations". Seven replies that everyone in that section of the ship knew. Makes sense since Klingon sex is supposed to be so rough that broken bones are common, and B'Elanna is known to be more in tune with her Klingon side.
-   Played with by Commander Ivanova in the _Babylon 5_ episode "Acts of Sacrifice" when she needs to fake having sex with an alien ambassador. Cue Ivanova in a sexy piece of eveningwear dancing in circles around the confused ambassador singing nonsense before screaming "**YES YES YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS!**"
-   In _Doctor Who_, River Song alludes to this when she claims in "The Impossible Astronaut" that she can be quite a screamer, adding "Now there's a spoiler for you."
-   On an episode of _Black Books_, Fran finds out that Howell, an old college friend — who's "a total arsehole" but nonetheless has a very sexy, deep voice — is doing the shipping news on the radio. That night, when his segment comes on, Fran takes the phone off the hook for masturbating, but the segment is over before she can finish. Luckily, thanks to a Chekhov's Gun, she has his phone number, so she just calls his house. The result is a very, very flummoxed Howell listening to Fran, who invokes the _hell_ out of this trope.
-   _Friends_:
    -   Ross is implied to be an offender:
        
        **Monica:** _\[To Rachel, wanting to distract Ross from something they did\]_ The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go _"reeee!!"_  
        **Rachel:** _\[Talking about how Ross refuses to check out of a hotel early\]_ One time Ross and I were at a hotel and we got a late checkout. Ross was so happy, it was the best sex we ever had! ...That is until he screamed out "RADISSON" at the end.
        
    -   Phoebe seems to be this as well. They actually overhear her with the guy upstairs at one point, much to their discomfort.
        
        **Rachel:** Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
        
    -   Monica once did it without any stimulus whatsoever when teaching Chandler about erogenous zones:
        
        **Monica:** Four-seven... five-seven... six-seven... seven... SEVEN... SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN **SEVEN**! _\[She ends this by mouthing "seven" with an exhausted and very pleased face\]_
        
    -   In that same episode, Chandler is worried about pleasing his new girlfriend, who is Joey's ex-girlfriend, because he used to hear her "agree" with him all night long, loudly.
    -   Vice versa too, Joey was often seen to be teasing Chandler about this, mimicking the sounds that his girlfriend Janice would make. When Janice tried to befriend him, she insists that they spend the day together because "that's how long it takes to love me".
        
        **Joey:** _\[Mutters under his breath\]_ I know. I live in the next room.
        
-   _Seinfeld_. George gets to hire a secretary. Despite choosing the least attractive applicant for the position, they end up having sex behind George's desk anyway. _"I'm giving you a RAAAAAAISE!"_
    -   As revealed in "The Mango", Elaine's orgasms with Jerry were like this — except she faked them.
        
        **Kramer:** You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.  
        **Jerry:** How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep, this woman.
        
-   _1000 Ways to Die_: Whenever there's a sexy female in "interesting" activities, this will happen. This is deconstructed in one sequence, featuring a girl named Lucy with Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. While she was still a very attractive girl, we see that going into these on a regular basis due to her problem _is_ very much a liability in her normal life... even more so when Lucy's abusive boyfriend Seth took to provoking her into having those for his own amusement. Needless to say, Seth became the Asshole Victim of the case: when he sent Lucy into a spasm while atop a flight of stairs, Lucy accidentally hit him across the face and sent him down to a Death by Falling Over.
-   An episode of _Penn & Teller: Bullshit!_ was all about orgasms and how to achieve them. Needless to say, this episode was littered with this trope.
-   _2 Broke Girls_:
    -   The episode "And the Pearl Necklace" implies that Sophie has these, even when she's alone.
    -   Caroline has one in the episode "And the Attack of the Killer Apartment" during a massage a broke massage therapist gave to her as a tip. Oleg has one too just from watching them.
        
        **Oleg:** _(After repeatedly slamming his hand on the bell)_ I just had what she's having.
        
-   In the "A Scandal in Belgravia" episode of _Sherlock_, Irene Adler gets a hold of Holmes' phone and sets this as her text alert. It's heard quite frequently thereafter.
-   Apparently, Penny from _The Big Bang Theory_ does this. According to Sheldon, who has the misfortune of having the room next to her boyfriend's, she makes "loud appeals to a deity". He buys noise-canceling headphones because of her (they don't work well enough).
-   _Game of Thrones_.
    -   "First of His Name." When Lysa Arryn marries Littlefinger, she says she will "scream loud enough to be heard across the Narrow Sea." That night, we see Sansa lying in her bed listening to her make good on that claim.
    -   Early on in Season 1, Ros and another prostitute were moaning so loud that Littlefinger snapped and told them, "Do you know how ridiculous you sound?!" He then instructs them in a more subtle approach that will convince the customer he's actually a great lover.
    -   It became more hilarious in Season 2 when Ros got in charge of Littlefinger's brothel and scolded another prostitute with the same question.
    -   Myranda is quite enthusiastic when we see her having sex with Ramsay.
    -   When training in secret, Jaime asks Bronn if their chosen training spot is good for privacy. Bronn replies that he's having an affair with another man's wife in that spot, and she's a screamer. Bronn reckons if they couldn't hear her scream from there, they won't hear them spar.
-   Carrie from _Homeland_ has this a lot, particularly in a Season 2 episode where she and Brody are having sex and Saul and Quinn are _listening_ to the whole thing. While Quinn finds this a waste of time, Saul insists that they must give Carrie more time to deal with Brody. Then, Quinn increases the volume with Carrie moaning just to prove his point.
-   Apparently in _Wings_, in which Lowell and ex-wife Bunny's lovemaking was so loud that roommate Brian cracked that HE needed a cigarette when they were done.
-   _Another Period_ has had several instances so far.
    -   In "Senate," Sigmund Freud diagnoses the Bellacourt women as suffering from "hysteria," and prescribes that their...lady bits...be stimulated with feathers. By the maids. Played straight with sisters Lillian and Beatrice; subverted by their mother Dodo, who barely reacts.
    -   Male version: in "Lillian's Birthday," Chair and the Commodore sneak off for a mid-day roll in the hay — until Chair stops and demands that the Commodore finishes himself. It goes on for minutes.
-   _The Kids in the Hall_ has a variation on this trope thanks to their recurring character, the Chicken Lady, whose orgasms are marked by an _**explosion of feathers.**_
-   _CSI: NY_: In the B-plot of "Time's Up", the Victim of the Week suffers a fatal immodest orgasm while seated in a deli due to someone having tampered with her asthma inhaler.
-   _Designing Women_ has Mary Jo and Charlene describe to Julia a couple who would have sex in their apartment complex hot tub every Saturday night. Julia is not amused.
    
    **Mary Jo and Charlene:** Oh Eric. Oh Eric! OH ERIC! YES _YES_ **YES!**

-   _NCIS_: When Tony is trying to deal with neighbors complaining about excessive noise from his apartment, Ziva assumes he's bragging about this and says she has a similar problem. Turns out Tony's just talking about his entertainment system. Ziva, though?
    
    **Ziva:** I'm a screamer.
    
-   _A French Village_: Hortense gets quite loud while having sex with Müller, shouting "Encore! Encore!" at him.
-   _Dickinson_:
    -   Sue is shown loudly crying "Yes" as Austin gives her oral sex in the barn.
    -   Lavinia gasps loudly in pleasure as Joseph fingers her under the table, which makes her claim it's expressing emotion at other things to cover the fact.
    -   Implied by Emily as she and Sue lie in the garden post-coitus in 2x10, saying "I feel sorry for the dead today".
-   A weird example, very much Played for Laughs from _That Mitchell and Webb Look_, where Rob plays an actor only pretending to have sex for a scene, yet can't resist shouting "Now we know!" as he gets into it, much to the confusion of the director, his co-star and _himself_.
-   _Miracle Workers_: Ezekiel and Prudence both get very loud while having sex.
-   _Doom Patrol (2019)_ sees Elasti-Woman use Flex Mentallo's powers to get herself off — and being so loud it summons a sex demon, Shadowy Mister Evans.

-   _Hightown_: Several of the women whom Jackie sleeps with get very loud when climaxing. Jackie does as well the one time Leslie goes down on her. One is _so_ loud while Jackie's eating her out that it makes Jackie stare with surprise.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: In "In Throes of Increasing Wonder...", before Lestat de Lioncourt puts Lily to sleep with his vampire abilities, he ensures that she experiences an orgasm with his Psychic Powers, and possibly clitoral stimulation through her undergarments (at least based on the position of his hand in one brief shot). She moans loudly a few times before slipping into slumber.
-   _Vida_: Lyn gets very loud while having sex with Jonny on the stairs and at his workplace.
-   _Fellow Travelers_:
    -   During their first sexual encounter, Hawkins Fuller gives Timothy Laughlin a handjob, and the latter moans so loudly that the former has to cover his lover's mouth with his hand so that the other residents of the apartment building won't hear Tim's orgasm. Hawk then notes, "That was nice, Skippy, but you need a radio." The next time Hawk comes over to Tim's place, he brings a radio; it's playing music while they're engaged in anal sex, which drowns out Tim's cries of pleasure.
    -   The first time Tim visits Hawk's apartment, the former performs oral sex on the latter, and Hawk exclaims, "Oh! Oh yeah! Oh! Oh Jesus!" before the scene cuts.
    -   Hawk is the "receiving" partner when he and Tim have anal sex in 1957, and he moans noisily, "Oh! Oh shit! Oh God!"

    Music 

-   Serge Gainsbourg incorporated some in his songs.
    -   Most of the lyrics in "Je t'aime... moi non plus" are not so much sung as they are moaned orgasmically by Jane Birkin.
    -   "Love on the Beat" is something of a more hardcore counterpart to the softer "Je t'aime... moi non plus". Gainsbourg said he incorporated real orgasmic sounds of his then-lover Caroline Paulus aka Bambou (and it sounds like they had some rough sex at that).
-   "I'm So Excited" by The Pointer Sisters. They want to wrap around you and squeeze you before they sing:
    
    _If you move real slow, I'll let it go!  
    I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it!_
    
-   "∞" ("Infinity") by Aphrodite's Child. Five full minutes of actress Irene Papas chanting and moaning and screaming in ecstasy. (It's supposedly edited down from a 37-minute continuous take!) "I was, I am, I am to come," indeed.
-   In "Love to Love You Baby", Donna Summer moans, sighs, and screams ecstatically as the song reaches its climax; the album version of the tune runs for _17 minutes_, most of it featuring this. "Twist" by Goldfrapp is a similar case.
-   "I Touch Myself" by Divinyls contains a breathy spoken repeat of the chorus that ends with a lot of cooing followed by suggestive musical vocalization.
-   One of the songs from Cradle of Filth mixes a woman having an I.O. with the same woman screaming in terror, all with a bunch of gothic music playing in the background. That's Venus in Fear. The concept album, on the whole, was about Countess Bathory, who, as rumours have it, was a bit inclined to her own gender. She was a mass murderer for sure.
-   Kanye West's _I'm In It_
    
    _Then she came like AAAAAA-A-A-A-A_
    
-   Pink Floyd's "The Great Gig in the Sky" is considered to be one by a few people, including David Gilmour, who flat-out admitted that the band was going for this effect.
-   _Stab Me in the Back_ and, of course, _Orgasm_' by X Japan. Toshi primarily on lead vocal for either of these songs and more so on Stab Me In The Back. That said, in live performance, hide could definitely hold his own on backing vocal for either of these songs. Though the panting on the recorded track of "Orgasm" is actually Yoshiki's. Yoshiki also did the "honors" for _White Poem._
-   The full version (the 18-minute take) of _Blind Dance_ by Violet UK combines this and Cluster F-Bomb.
-   "Black Sunshine" and "More Human Than Human" by White Zombie
-   "Whole Lotta Love" by Led Zeppelin. It has an orgasm section with the moans of Robert Plant which, according to Wikipedia, begins at 1:24 and lasts until 3:02. Really, at least 1/4 of Led Zeppelin's songs could be considered to contain this.
-   "The Whipping Haus" by William Control; the song has an orgasm going on constantly in the background. The same "ongoing orgasm" thing was revisited in the song "All Due Restraint" in the second album.
-   DanceDanceRevolution actually has a few of these sprinkled in if you listen carefully...
    -   "Oh Nick Please Not So Quick" by E-rotic is full of moaning and breathy vocals ending with an orgasm cry of "NICKY!"
    -   "Sexy Planet" by Crystal Aliens uses female orgasm cries as a musical instrument over synthesizers
    -   "So many Men so Little Time" by Me & My is punctuated by suspicious gasps and moans between vocals.
    -   "Do it all night" by A-Team, oh yeaaaaaaah.
    -   The slow part of INSERTiON has this.
-   Guns N' Roses' "Rocket Queen" features actual orgasmic moans, by a woman having sex with Axl in the studio. The one responsible for the recording is jokingly credited in the album's liner notes as "Victor 'the fucking engineer' Deyglio".
    -   As does "Welcome to the Jungle", cut from the same recording session (though with Axl's moans).

-   "The Astronomer" by Vermillion Lies has the singer do an Immodest Orgasm at the end. Especially funny because she's getting off on thinking about the solar system.
-   "Horny As Hell" by The Neon Judgement has a male, somewhat distorted Immodest Orgasm at the end.
-   Any given live version of "Ghost of You" or "You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison" by My Chemical Romance. Also, the "crying" at the end of most live versions of "Mama" turns into those kinds of noises too.
    -   The studio and live versions of "Destroya" have moans similar to this.
-   The last two minutes of the song "HEROIN" by the Jrock band Vidoll are basically this.
-   On Blue Amazon's _Javelin_ album, "The Runner" and the beginning of the title track have orgasmic moaning. By the way, the album title is a potential euphemism for the male private part.
-   One of the most erotic recordings ever made prior to 1970 is "You're the Boss" by Elvis Presley and Ann-Margret in which Ann-Margret purrs like she's having an orgasm throughout the song. Little surprise RCA refused to release it until the 1990s.
-   German Punkrock band Die Ärzte have a song called "Sweet Sweet Gwendoline" which basically is about bondage and has a woman expressing pleasure in loud screams throughout the second half (click here for the song).
    -   A tiny squeal of lust occurs also on their Geschwisterliebe.
-   Duran Duran's "Hungry Like the Wolf". It starts by inserting some heavy breathing in the middle of the song, then it goes into full-blown background moans.
-   Women moaning suggestively appear throughout the Nanowar of Steel song "RAP-Sody"; there's also "King", where the queen explains how much fun the eponymous king gave her, and expresses it with the appropriately suggestive sound.
-   Gianna Nannini "America". OK, she has only a very short orgasm at the end of the song, but in return, the whole song is about _fammi volare_ (let me fly).
-   When she sings her Cover Version of the Mickey & Sylvia song "Love Is Strange", K.T. Oslin mimics an orgasm at the end of the song.
-   "Breathe On Me" by Britney Spears, although she makes moaning orgasm noises in most of her songs.
-   Green Day has orgasm sounds that are planted throughout "Fuck Time".
    -   In their live _Bullet in a Bible_ performance of "Hitchin' a Ride", Billie Joe conducts the audience to say various sounds, which escalates to orgasmic noises. Then he puts his hand in his pants...
-   Hawkwind's _Spirit Of The Age_ sees a robot doing this:
    
    Your android replica is playing up again, it's no joke; when she comes she moans another's name...
    
-   One-Hit Wonder Sylvia really shocked the charts with the breathily orgasmic _Pillow Talk_ in 1973. This was explicit enough to be banned by many radio stations and was one of the first "parental advisory" songs ever recorded.
-   The Stranglers' _Peaches_ gets pretty uncompromising towards the end, when singer Hugh Cornwell lets it out concerning the attractive and underdressed women on the beaches all around him. The BBC were definitely unhappy with this song and Cornwell's unambiguous rhythmic grunting towards the end.
-   The Rolling Stones' "Star Star" implies the starfucker Mick is singing to is prone to those: "If I ever get back to New York, girl\\Going to make you scream all night".
-   Imelda May gets poetic about Intercourse with You on "How Bad Can a Good Girl Be?":
    
    An ancient voice escaped my mouth  
    And it screamed out in primal pleasure  
    My spirit soul, my animal  
    Came together in every measure...
    
-   The intro and break of K5's aptly-named "Passion" feature distorted moans and gasping cries of "Yes! Oh yeah!"
-   On the instrumental version of "Foe tha Love of $" by Bone Thugs-n-Harmony has a woman moaning around the 1:31 mark and again at 3:09 in between an electric guitar solo.
-   Janet Jackson made something of a _habit_ out of doing this on at least one song per album, from 1993's _janet._ album (where "Throb" got this treatment mid-song) to, most recently, the title track of 2008's _Discipline_. Given that her lyrical content from that span of her career leaned very heavily towards Intercourse with You on the vast majority of the songs, it's not too surprising.
    -   Additionally, "My Need" from _The Velvet Rope_ features constant moaning, groaning, and gasping looped as part of the music itself (as did "Throb").
-   Wall of Voodoo: "Struggle" from their less-known first album is a short instrumental with accompanying moaning. (Maybe the heroine just fights with a renitent immersion heater...)
-   The Runaways: "Cherry Bomb", during the second half of the guitar solo and right after the Truck Driver's Gear Change.
-   Garbage: "#1 Crush", right from the beginning.
-   Berlin: "Sex (I'm A...)" ends with a short but sharp one.
-   2 Live Crew's "Me So Horny" features moans sampled from a sex scene in the 1977 Richard Pryor film _Which Way Is Up?"_, interspersed with the refrain lyrics sampled from _Full Metal Jacket_.

    Music Videos

-   Stern Pinball's _Playboy_ includes numerous "ooohs," "aaaahs," purrs, and moans in its sound effects.

    Roleplay 

-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, the Sarquil lieutenant Lamashtu al-Khadra ends up moaning loudly when she has an orgasm while having sex with Captain Razoul. It turns out that Lamashtu is, in fact, the succubus Lust and that she intends this act of pleasure to boost her magic which she intends to unleash on the Alentian populace to turn everyone in the city into lunatics who will be driven only by their passions.

    Theater 

-   A piece in _The Vagina Monologues_ was about various ways and means women moan during sex, featuring an array of all orgasms immodest—and modest, given that the impression of a WASP woman was to make no sound at all.
-   _Avenue Q_: "You can be as loud as the hell you want when you're making love." Also contains an example of the male variant, as hilariously demonstrated by Princeton and Brian themselves.
    
    **Princeton:** _\[to Kate\]_ You can't put your finger there — Ooooouuuooohhh! — PUT YOUR FINGER THERE!!
    
-   In _Out Of Gas On Lover's Leap_, the sex happens entirely off-stage, but the audience knows what's going on thanks to this trope.
-   In _The Well of Horniness_, every time the title of the play is mentioned—which is often—the line goes, "The Well—\[immodest orgasm noise off-stage\]—of Horniness."
-   In _Legally Blonde_: "It feels oh...oh...oh-oh-OH! Much better."
-   In _Heathers_: The ending of "Dead Girl Walking. "Love this dead girl — yeah! Yeah! Yeah!" "Ow!" "YYYYYEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
-   In _Young Frankenstein_, Elizabeth's tryst with the Monster culminates in an entire musical number called "Deep Love", with Elizabeth singing and fireworks going off. Afterwards, both she and the Monster are smoking, and Elizabeth comes out looking like the Bride of Frankenstein.

    Video Games 

-   One of the early mods for _Unreal Tournament_ allowed you to change the nature of the Announcer's voice. One of which was "Orgasmic", which consisted of a lady getting more and more excited as your 'performance' improves...
-   In _Grand Theft Auto IV_: "OH NIKO! TELL ME INTERESTING THINGS!" We later find out that she's a spy working for the CIA and was assigned to befriend Niko due to his illegal entry into the country, and his ties with Organized Crime and Terrorism.
-   In the _Æon Flux_ game, Sithandra is somehow altered by Trevor Goodchild so that she interprets pain as pleasure. The lethal electric shock Aeon gives her a long, loud orgasm.
-   During one of the missions in the final chapter of the Aribeth's Redemption _Neverwinter Nights_ module series, Aribeth (the player's wife) is forced to fake being raped by an undercover agent by making very loud noises to keep up both their disguises.
-   In _Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven_, player character Thomas Angelo is tasked with visiting a brothel and performing a hit on the brothel's manager and one of its girls. Players who approach locked bedroom doors closely may hear... interesting things.
-   The 1987 Apple Macintosh game _Crystal Quest_ has a surprisingly loud female moan when you exit the level by taking your ship through the open gateway. Some people objected, especially since all the other sound effects are comparatively innocuous.
-   Madison fakes one of these in _Heavy Rain_ in order to prevent a guard from entering the room where she's interrogating their boss. The sound, combined with the face made by said boss.
-   A cut line in _Dragon Age: Origins_ has Leliana insulting Morrigan by suggesting that the Grey Warden is attracted to her because she "screams like a genlock being murdered", presumably during sex. During the player's relationship with Zevran, Wynne will also comment that half the camp hasn't been getting any sleep.
-   The _A Week in Paradise_ version of _Postal 2_ includes a semi-hidden porn clip. If you go to the college and enter one of the offices, a TV showing a clip of Tera Patrick having sex can be seen (and heard). The clip is taken from the interactive DVD _Virtual Sex with Tera Patrick_ and the volume of the TV (which the player cannot control) is set high enough that Tera can be heard down the hall and even outside when one approaches the room where the video is playing.
-   One Optional Sexual Encounter in _The Witcher_ occurs in a supposedly-haunted mill at night. The woman is loud enough that we get a scene of a couple of dockhands speculating on what sort of monster has moved into the mill, and whether they should send a Witcher in after it.
-   _Deus Ex_: In a rundown hotel, someone having a moaning good time can be heard behind one of the doors. Not even the sounds of explosions and pitched battle (caused by the player) seems to affect this. If you go back and re-visit that same area the final time you're in New York City, nothing changes.
-   In _Haunting Ground_, if Fiona is done-in by Daniella's impalement attack, you get treated to this game over screen. Unlike the other examples here, it's Nightmare Fuel, what with the blade and flesh sounds and all.
-   The censored cutscene when walking into a prostitute's room in _Jagged Alliance 2_.
-   _Portal 2_:
    -   After returning to the present-day Aperture Laboratories and being press-ganged into performing tests within the now-crumbling complex by Wheatley, the completion of the test chambers has Wheatley outright moaning and remarking on the experiences, later saying that the player character needs to do more tests because he's not "feeling it" after a while. GLaDOS explains that the main computer is programmed so that any A.I. placed into it experiences a euphoric high for completing scientific testing, complete with addiction and a gradually increasing tolerance that requires testing to more extremes to reach the same high. She claims that she was "only in it for the science" and that she has the intellect needed to resist it.
    -   GLaDOS's "YEAH! YEAH! TAKE THE LEMONS!" during Cave Johnson's epic lemon rant.
-   The Announcer (Helen) in _Team Fortress 2_, during the end of a Payload map. "_YEEEEES! THE CART HAS ALMOST REACHED THE FINAL TERMINUS! HAHA!_"
-   A very creepy version of this occurs in _F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin_. As Alma is raping a restrained and hallucinating Becket, she makes sounds that are somewhat like these, but hideously distorted and inhuman sounding. Listen here and then go change your undies.
-   In _Klax_ the female A.I. would react this way to certain moves sounding more orgasmic for each subsequent response.
    
    **Klax:** _\[at 4\]_ Ooh!  
    **Klax:** _\[at 5\]_ Yeah!  
    **Klax:** _\[at 6, or a crossing the board X formation\]_ OOOH YEAHHHH!!!!
    
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_, if you stand next to Joker for a few minutes, this sound starts playing from his speakers, prompting him to sheepishly note that the sound was _supposed_ to go to his earpiece.
    -   In _Mass Effect 3_, Shepard in a romance with Tali hints at this during some Casual Danger Dialogue. With the third member of the away team remarking on it in various amusing ways.
        
        **Shepard:** Let me know if it gets too quiet on the Normandy and I'll find you someplace _louder_.  
        **Tali:** Hmmmm...
        
    -   Lampshaded in _Mass Effect: Andromeda_. During one piece of random dialogue that can be heard while driving around in the Nomad, Peebee begins faking having sex with the protagonist's character, Ryder, in order to prove that squadmate Jaal, who has been annoying her with his snoring, is in fact only pretending to sleep. He is. Becomes more of a lampshade if Ryder is engaged in an optional sexual relationship with Peebee by the time this exchange occurs.
        -   Also implied by Jaal if Ryder is in a relationship with him. During the scene after the final mission, Jaal will loudly greet Ryder with his pet name for them, leading Ryder to joke that Jaal's "affections are so loud sometimes." Jaal will immediately quip that Ryder's are as well.
-   _Final Fantasy XIII_: Vanille using Hecatoncheir's finisher move "Gaian Salvo". She enjoys it a bit too much.
-   _Fallout: New Vegas_:
    -   In the expansion pack _Old World Blues_, The Courier is able to provoke this reaction from Think Tank Dr. Dala by... breathing deeply, sighing, and stroking your face. Yep. She has a _big_ fascination with the human body.
    -   Stand around in some areas of the Gomorrah casino- you'll definitely notice some of the more vocal patrons and employees.
-   _Max Payne 2_:
    -   Max has a fever dream that features the disembodied voice of Mona Sax having a really good time with someone (likely Max himself, as at this point in the game the sexual tension between the two has pretty much reached its breaking point, and Max literally can't stop fantasizing about her, even while suffering from near-fatal gunshot wounds).
    -   Most of the "lady noises" come when the TV in an abandoned room is broadcasting an advert for an adult TV show. So since he's in a dream, it's quite possible the sound was merely lodged in his subconscious.
-   This sound. If it sounds a bit off, that's because this was taken from _Silent Hill 4_. (Warning: think about what this trope means before clicking the link without headphones on.)
-   The checkpoints in _Electronic Super Joy_ are _very_ enthusiastic about your progress.
-   In one of the romance paths of _Queen at Arms_, following the Optional Sexual Encounter, protagonist Marcus ruminates sheepishly on the fact that she hadn't been able to keep quiet and hopes she wasn't overheard.
-   In _Fate Extra CCC_, Kiara's Noble Phantasm involves her _raping the planet_ and absorbing the desires of all living beings, which she blasts you with. It must be seen to be believed.
-   In _Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth_, giving a character the "Sultry" voice option makes them, upon leveling up a skill, sound less like they're studying adventurer techniques and more like they're in someone's bed:

    Web Animation 

-   In _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, when the Emperor outlines his vision of perfect mankind, Descius has a _very_ loud orgasm, to the discomfort of others present.

-   In _The First Word_, a female cavewoman has an orgasm so powerful that in it she creates humanity's first word: "Good!"
-   One morning in _Fans!_, Rikk and Rumy try fingering. Cut to Ally in the next room, being woken up by "OOOOOOH! OHHHH!" and deciding to go to work early that day.
-   _Girls with Slingshots_: Chris starts dating Melody, who is deaf. Since she's normally quiet, he assumed she'd be quiet during sex. He was wrong. Since she can't hear herself, she has absolutely no filter for the sounds she makes, and they get interrupted more than once by the police who assume something is horribly wrong.
-   _Looking for Group_: In this page, Richard and Dorel overhear Cale and Benny having sex in the woods, and Richard misinterprets it like only he can.
    
    **Richard:** It sounds like he's hurting her.  
    _\[Beat\]_  
    _\[Dorel laughs and walks away.\]_  
    **Richard:** Good job, Cale! I'll help you bury the body!
    
-   _Ménage à 3_: The effervescent DiDi is prone to (as it turns out) faking loud orgasms, driving her two roommates out to an all-night coffee shop at least once. Other cast members are sometimes overheard through doors, if not quite so loudly. The spin-off comic _Sticky Dilly Buns_ also uses that joke.
-   _Muh Phoenix_: Scarlet Witch has one after being wrapped by Magik's Phoenix Fire Tentacles. The panel is even edited to give her a blush.
-   Parodied by _Oglaf_, many times over.
    -   The shapeshifters in "Fresh Horses" have _no clue_ how the human orgasm (or any sexual function) works, which is bad news for their attempted brothel.
    -   The bordello in "The Pink Haze" bans berserkers for this reason.
    -   Subverted in "Scabbard"; the namesake accessory's vocalizations when a sword is inserted are the product of a talented ventriloquist salesman.
    -   In "The Rudiments" and "Haystacks", Oglaf the shepherd and Goat Girl's shenanigans result in mountains blowing up (and in one case, an actual volcano).
    -   In "Ungulation", the female partner's orgasm summons wild horses, prompting the male partner to assume his other partners have been faking it.
-   Discussed in one _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_. After a mother explains to her son that sex is for having babies, he retorts with a statistical analysis of all the times he's overheard her and Dad having sex for "mysterious non-baby reasons".
-   _Skin Horse_: The water cooler AI<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  can only say "Service is my only joy". So she says 'Joy' very, very loudly.
-   _Vampire Cheerleaders_:
-   _waiting for the trade_: Emma Frost is attempting to keep a lid on her greatest weakness, her "secret fetish for people who are just broken deep down inside." Cue Scott Summers:
    
    **Scott**: Hello Emma. Do you have time to talk? I have some issues I need to sort out.  
    **Emma**: hngh
