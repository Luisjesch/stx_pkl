_"I get up, put on the light, dreading the oncoming night_  
_Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again"_

Some dreams are heart-warming visions of hope, filled with cute and cuddly creatures, so delightful they make you want to fall asleep right away. Other dreams...aren't.

There are nightmares that chill your soul. They are a journey through a warped mirror of reality where Transformation Horrors abound and Primal Fears are on public parade. All our comforting certainties melt away, and chaos reigns supreme. Quite frankly, after a dream like that it would almost be a relief to encounter the Outer Gods dancing to the eldritch music of blasphemous flutes.

These nightmares can show off the emotional confusion and torment affecting a character. An effective way to show a character is having bad dreams is just to go into them and show the nightmarish sequence itself. Each bizarre image can dissect the issue facing them, showing the distortions the mind puts on them.

These dreams are often, though not always, associated with Deranged Animation. Hallucinations and supposedly funny nightmares also fall under this trope.

It may overlap with Catapult Nightmare, if the character having the nightmare wakes up by flinging themselves up from the bed in fright. Flashback Nightmare is a subtrope of this (and Past Experience Nightmare) where the nightmare is shown as a flashback the character's Dark and Troubled Past. See also Irritation Nightmare and Guilt-Induced Nightmare.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Tetsuo's series of nightmares and hallucinations in _AKIRA_. These dreams vary from giant stuffed animals attacking him, to visions of his horrifying future, to having his intestines burst out of him from simply falling. We don't even want to mention the further horrors that this poor kid goes through during the latter half of the story (even though to a degree, he does partially deserve it).
-   At the beginning of _Attack on Titan_, Eren experiences a very mysterious and disturbing nightmare complete with Titans eating people, a decapitated statue, a child's dolls spread out in the same positions as a group of dead soldiers, and a grainy shot of his mother being picked by a Titan. He wakes up in fright with Mikasa nearby and tells her that he felt as if he had an extremely long dream but couldn't remember any of it. Mikasa then notices Eren crying and asks him why, and Eren couldn't answer that either. This was a change from the original manga where Eren only saw a seemingly older Mikasa with shorter hair telling him that she'll see him later before waking up.
-   Downplayed in _Azumanga Daioh_, when Osaka dreamt of meeting Chiyo's dad. It was mostly super bizarre because of Chiyo's dad's presence, but at the short end of the dream, Chiyo's dad suddenly threatens to rip off Osaka's tongue for her saying that she got cat's tongue, unlike him. The effect is doubled in the original version, where Chiyo's dad is voiced by Norio Wakamoto, famed for his roles as many villains, and while he's using his more wacky normal voice throughout the dream, when he threatened, Wakamoto dipped into his villain-voice (albeit a Large Ham one), making it feel like he was serious in ripping Osaka's tongue.
-   Guts of _Berserk_ has these quite often, both from his childhood trauma and from the monsters that constantly torment him post-Eclipse.
-   Happens several times in _Chrono Crusade_. Chrono has a nightmare where he's surrounded by dead bodies as Aion tempts him back to his side (hinting at his backstory). Rosette has a nightmare at the start of the Darkest Hour that serves to recap some of the trauma she's been through as well as gives a clear idea of her psychological state. And in an early episode of the anime, Rosette has a nightmare that's half a flashback, half a nightmare about her brother's kidnapping by the Big Bad.
-   _Diamond Daydreams_, in itself a rather subdued Slice of Life series, has Karin's often rather scary nightmares.
-   _Digimon Tamers:_ During a Mind Rape\-induced dream sequence (seen here, starting at 0:53), one protagonist experiences herself as a child running through a hospital and right into a razor-toothed, eyeless version of herself, with a snarling, drooling, oddly grinning version of her favorite sock puppet sewn onto her arm. The fact that this is how she equates her mother's death does NOT help matters in any way/shape/form. The true psychological impact can't be had without seeing her slow degeneration throughout the series from using the puppet as a cute way to talk to people into being actively controlled by the puppet, but the images are arguably worse for sheer Nightmare Fuel out of context.
-   The Stand Death 13 has this ability in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_, killing people when they fall asleep. The worst part is that even if you wake up before it can get to you, you have no recollection of what happened in the dream...
-   The premise of _Nightmare Inspector_ is Hiruko the Baku's entering into people's nightmares with them in order to figure out what they mean.
-   _Lucy-May of the Southern Rainbow_: In one of her dreams, Lucy encounters Kate, Clara, Annie, Arthur, Ben, and Tob who turn away from her and show their backs. They pretend not to know her and no one tries to help Lucy-May as she struggles underwater. In a severe case of Mood Whiplash, next, the scenery changes to a field, and she's running alongside the Princeton's cat Prospero. Prospero suddenly turns into Little, and Lucy there's something familiar about it's face.
-   Himeno from _Prétear_ has these in an episode of the anime. It's actually caused by Takako/Fenrir, who wants to communicate with her.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_'s first sequence is this trope, complete with Deranged Animation, Alien Geometry, a wrecked landscape, and an Eldritch Abomination. Oddly enough, as horrific as it was, Madoka didn't wake up startled, just confused. As it turns out, it was a Flashback Nightmare from a previous timeline.
-   An episode of _Yes! Pretty Cure 5_ features nightmare sequences for four of the main characters, induced by The Dragon for a pretty good reason. The idea is to cause the girls to despair.

    Arts 

-   _Medici Chapels_: Implied with "Night", as she is clearly sleeping —closed eyes and head nested in her arm—, but sports a troubled expression. We don't know what she's dreaming but it's clearly unpleasant.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: Near the end of _Happy Diary_ episode 46, Wilie has a bad dream where he finds that his parents have returned to their castle, only to find out shortly after that they were taken away in chains by an invisible hand, leaving Wilie stranded in the black void.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Adventures of Tintin_: The dream sequences in "Tintin" will never be surpassed in terms of creepiness. Yet, for the sake of this article, let's just mention the nightmare scenes:
    -   In "Tintin: Cigars of the Pharaoh" Tintin is locked inside an Egyptian tomb and put to sleep with sleeping gas. He then dreams several strange images combining recent people he met and Egyptian artwork.

    -   In "Tintin: The Seven Crystal Balls" Tintin and his companions all have the same nightmare: that they are visited by the Inca mummy Rascar Capac who enters their bedroom by night and then throws a poisonous crystal ball on the floor. This is even more terrifying in the animated series.
    -   In _Prisoners of the Sun_, Tintin dreams that Calculus is admiring an "Inca Tree" whose flowers are skulls while a real Inca menaces him with a spear, next Tintin asks the Inca, who now has Haddock's face if he has a licence for the rifle over his shoulder, upon which the Inca turns into a mysterious Indian who has been following the heroes and blasts Tintin with fire for blasphemy.

It's during another one that the Nightmare Forces kidnap Rarity and take her to the moon. In the following issue they are confronted by the same nightmares, but overcome them thanks to each other (with the exception of Rarity, who's still kidnapped, of course).
-   Nero: Nightmare sequences occur quite frequently in the series, among others in _“Moea Papoea”, “Beo De Verschrikkelijke”, “De Gouden Vrouw”, “De Ark Van Nero”, “De Paarse Futen”, “Zwoele Charlotte” and “De Draak van Halfzeven”_.
-   _Prince of Persia: The Graphic Novel_:

    -   Shirin's nightmare is a dust storm raising up giant boys made of dust, who carry off Ferdos, claiming him as "one of us."
-   Dream of _The Sandman (1989)_ curses a man who kept him locked up for decades with the never-ending nightmare, where every time he thinks he's woken up, the nightmare continues. The few panels of this we see are horrifying.
-   Several of them in _Supergirl_ storyline _Bizarrogirl_:
    -   The story starts out with Kara reliving her final battle against Superwoman. As she is hitting the supervillain, accusing her of destroying her planet and causing a war, Superwoman retorts the Kryptonians were not blameless, Alura was far from innocent, and Supergirl killed her. Then her flesh melts off her face, and a legion of skeletons -including Supergirl's dead parents'- move in on Kara to drag her down with them.

-   Suske en Wiske: The album _"De Bokkenrijders"_ starts off with Wiske telling a nightmare she just had and Tante Sidonia explaining its symbolic meanings. Of course, as the story progresses Wiske's nightmare turns out to she was Dreaming of Things to Come.
-   In _Transmetropolitan_, Spider Jerusalem has one after he stuffs himself with drugs (again) when he realizes he has become a Japanese-like anime, a cheesy live-action TV series, and a porn movie. Sadly, he has a fairly good dream at the beginning.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: After Hippolyta's death, the reader is treated to a series of Diana's nightmares in which Hippolyta's burnt and dying form asks why Diana didn't save her. When Diana learns her sister is having the dreams as well she realizes they're being inflicted on them by Circe and hunts the witch down.
    -   _Wonder Woman (2006)_: After Diana is trapped in a dreamlike state by Stalker she has a nightmare within it in which she loses her compassion and soul and sees herself as a heartless Amazon queen with her old friends and mother forced to bow to her and her villains heads displayed on pikes before her throne.
-   Yorick in _Y: The Last Man_ suffers from constant nightmares, usually involving his girlfriend Beth. So much so that when Yorick finally does meet her his first reaction is to storm off in the belief that he's just having another cruel dream.

    Films — Animation 

-   _All Dogs Go to Heaven_ had a disturbingly vivid sequence that is mostly recalled for putting the fear of divine punishment and existential dread in its young audience. Our protagonist, Charlie is sucked into Hell, where he gets trapped on a ship slowly sinking into a lake of lava while being tormented by demon rats and a gigantic devil thing. Charlie screams for help covered in demons as the end of the ship he's on slowly descends into the lava... and then he wakes up.
-   Anya/Anastasia has a nightmare on a stormy night at sea. While things start off with her family swimming around happily in the water beckoning her to join them, they then suddenly turn into Rasputin's demon minions. It's made even more horrible by the fact that Anya is a sleepwalker, so when she watches her family's swimming from a cliff she's actually standing at the railing of the deck, and the demons are trying to make her fall into a certain death. Rasputin instigated the dream in the first place, and the sleepwalking, as well - he was trying to use his dark magic to make her commit suicide in her sleep. When Dimitri stops her from throwing herself into the water, the spell is broken and the dream becomes a nightmare.
-   _The Brave Little Toaster_ features a nightmare sequence where the titular Toaster is menaced by a horrifying Monster Clown in a fireman outfit, then falls to his doom into a bathtub.
-   The "Pink Elephants On Parade" segment of _Dumbo_, a rare instance of hallucinations.
-   The dreams in _Felidae_ are perhaps the most twisted animation ever created. Those dreams are just freaky, specifically the one involving Gregor Mendel giggling demonically "EXPERIMENTS WITH PLANT HYBRIDS!" while putting on some kind of twisted marionette show using the decomposing corpses of gutted cats, with their entrails as the marionette strings.
-   _A Goofy Movie_ has a bit at the beginning where Max has a nightmare in which he's in an idyllic scene with the girl of his dreams, and suddenly turns into a giant lumbering copy of his dad.
    -   _An Extremely Goofy Movie_ features one in the middle of the film where Goofy falls asleep in the middle of taking a test. It starts of idyllic with him hanging out with Max, only for Max to turn into a hulking, brutish monster and dump Goofy into an abyss while Max yells at him to get his own life. The whole thing leaves Goofy shaken and causes him to fail the test, resulting in a Heroic BSoD for a while.
-   _James and the Giant Peach_ has the eponymous character dream that he's a caterpillar eating the peach in the title. Suddenly, his wicked aunts appear and spray a pesticide cloud at him... which then morphs into James' greatest fear — a rhino that killed his parents — that proceeds to pursue him and shortly after corner him under a bridge. All the while, his aunts chant in mock singsong voices "The rhino will get you!" in the background. Not to mention that the dream itself is presented in unsettling cut-out animation that resembles a deranged, nightmarish _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ sketch.
-   In _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_, Simba has a nightmare where he tries and fails to save his father from falling to his death in the wildebeest stampede, and is then thrown into the gorge himself by Kovu. Made even worse by the fact that, in the dream, Scar first stops Simba from reaching Mufasa, and then _morphs_ into Kovu.
-   Considering that _Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland_ is All Just a Dream, the entire climactic scene with the villain could be considered a Nightmare Dream, but the sequence with a subtler horror is a Dream-Within-A-Dream where Nemo goes to the kitchen, to find his mother washing the dishes, except that a train's coming, barrelling ever closer and closer towards them while Nemo's mom does not budge, just says, "Don't be silly, Nemo," as the whistle screams and—
-   The "Heffalumps and Woozles" nightmare scene from _Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day_. See it here. The insane laughter of the honey pot is probably one of the worst bits.
    
    _"...they tie themselves in horrible knots, they come in stripes and polkadots!"_
    
-   _Moana_ has a nightmare in which she imagines her parents being buried by an erupting volcano.
-   _Shrek the Third_ contains a sequence where Shrek is back home, safe and sound... until he's suddenly near-crushed by a literal flood of babies. Plus "Baby Donkey" and "Baby Puss n' Boots". "**DADA!**"
-   _Toy Story 2_ has a dream sequence where Woody is thrown in a garbage can, and when he tries to crawl out he is pulled back by a mass of discarded toy parts working together to form a giant _AKIRA_\-style tentacle. They were originally going to use this in the first movie as well. There's also an episode of the Toy Story Shorts that is based around this entire trope.
-   In _The Prince of Egypt_, Moses has a hieroglyphic-depicted nightmare of himself being in the village where the Hebrews reside and he sees the Egyptian guards taking the newborn sons away from their mothers. He also sees his biological mother, Yocheved, and siblings (Aaron and Miriam) running to the Nile while hiding from the guards. He follows them and he sees his mother putting a baby in a basket. That baby is him, and he realizes the truth about his heritage. Then, he runs away from Egyptian guards who are chasing him and he falls down into the crocodile-infested river along with the infants.
-   _Turning Red_: Mei's nightmare involves some very disturbing imagery and Jump Scares, which are all shown through a Red Filter of Doom with green lighting. Some of these include:
    -   Merman!Devon flopping around, then a close-up of him doing a Thousand-Yard Stare.
    -   The 4\*Town members appearing as flowers and doing a split-second Nightmare Face.
    -   A dead bird next to shattered eyeglasses.
    -   A folding fan that shows Ming’s distressed face on it.
    -   A horse coughing up... something. Possibly a worm, since the next frame shows a worm split in half.
    -   Finally, a couple of evil-looking red panda spirits pouncing at the screen.
-   In _Twice Upon a Time_ (which is about a Dream Land), the fool heroes Ralph and Mum are briefly trapped in a _waking_ nightmare in which they are attacked by sentient office supplies — making matters worse, the heroes are only inches tall...

    Literature 

-   _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_. The original book is a single extended dream sequence, and the various film versions do not skimp on the horror.
    -   The original might or might not count, but _The Nursery Alice_ most assuredly does. The text is the classic Carroll story, but the illustrations were apparently created by a morbid impressionist while on a bad acid trip.
    -   In the 1985 adaptation the White Queen, played by Carol Channing, turns into a sheep, just like in the book, but here the sheep's face is so ghostly and its bleating so unearthly that it's terrifying just to look at. Alice even has a terrified reaction towards it!
    -   Similarly, the scene where the Duchess' baby transforms from a wailing human child to a writhing, screaming piglet.
    -   And then there's the Jabberwock scene<small>◊</small>, which seems to be cruelly engineered to traumatize children. Watch if you dare. It looks as though Alice has made her way home, but she's actually still stuck in the world Through the Looking Glass. She can see her parents on the other side of the mirror and cries for their attention, but her mom and dad can't hear or see her and she's left to wander the limbo-like mirror room. She comes upon the _Jabberwocky_ book and starts to read it — and then the monster (which could have been co-designed by H.R. Giger and Wayne D. Barlowe) comes charging into the room to eat her and then... that's the cliffhanger ending of the first episode of the two-part special!
        -   In the original publishing, an illustration of the Jabberwock was intended to be the frontispiece, but was deemed too fearsome.
    -   How can one babble about Alice in Wonderland being nightmare fuel without including the American McGee version? She is an asylum patient in the game After her parents burned alive in a house fire!
-   _Battle Royale_: Several characters have nightmares, usually in the form of dreaming about discovering their classmates mutilated corpses. In the manga version, Shogo Kawada says that a nightmare is the brain's way of working through the experienced horror.
-   _The Berenstain Bears_:
    -   "The Bad Dream" focuses on Brother and Sister having nightmares about a cartoon villain.
    -   In "Learn About Strangers", Papa's story where a goose gets eaten by a fox gives Sister nightmares.
-   The title character of _The BFG_ is a giant who travels to Dream Land to catch dreams, and then blow the nice ones through the windows of sleeping humans. He generally makes it a policy to destroy the nightmares, but his human friend, Sophie, convinces him to make a specific nightmare to send to Queen Elizabeth II, warning her about the other giants and their people-eating ways. They feel very bad about it, but it's the only way they can prepare the Queen to believe them when they ask for her help in getting rid of the giants.
    -   There's also a bit earlier in the story when the BFG blows a nightmare into the mind of one of the other giants. He starts screaming in his sleep about someone named Jack chasing after him with a giant pointy beanstalk. Both the movie versions move this incident to the climax of the story, where it becomes a kind of Chekhov's Gun to save Sophie, rather than the one-off prank it was in the book.
-   _Chrysanthemum_: Chrysanthemum has a nightmare where she's a _real_ chrysanthemum, and Victoria tears out all her petals and leaves until "there was nothing left but a scrawny stem."
-   In the Star Wars Expanded Universe novel _Death Star_, a trooper transferred to the titled battle station starts having nightmares, some of them about his own death. They make it hard to sleep. Medical staff is short, so a surgeon reluctantly looks him over, takes his blood, and gives him medication. Then the Death Star fires on a prison planet, the trooper wakes up screaming, and his dreams get exponentially worse. The surgeon tells him that it turns out he's Force-Sensitive. His dreams come true.
-   From the Deryni books.
    -   While being held captive by Caitrin and Loris in _The Bishop's Heir_, Dhugal has a vivid nightmare about facing divine judgement for failing to save Kelson, whose gory corpse rises up from its bier to point an accusing finger at him.
    -   When Kelson reads Loris' mind during questioning late in _The King's Justice_, he learns that Camber appeared to Loris in a dream (later speculation attributes this to his possession of Duncan's episcopal ring, which was originally made for Henry Istelyn from an old piece of altar plate associated with Camber himself). Reliving the experience through Loris's eyes, Kelson knows that while Camber spoke of tolerance, Loris so demonized all things Deryni that for him it was a nightmare.
    -   During his preparatory meditation for Conall's triggering ritual in _The Quest for Saint Camber_, Morgan gazes on the unconscious and frail Nigel, dressed in Haldane red court robes with one of the state crowns on a pillow above his head. Suddenly, Morgan vividly imagines himself standing in the Haldanes' royal crypt gazing down at Nigel's body on his funeral bier.
-   _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_:
    -   In "Dog Days", Rowley has a nightmare where there is a chicken under his bed.
    -   In "Double Down", Greg has several nightmares: in one he has a tail and is being mobbed, in another he has been kidnapped by zombie pirates, and in another, his teeth are falling out.
-   _Dilly The Dinosaur_: In one story, Dilly sneaks out of bed and watches a horror movie where humans are evil. He then has nightmares about humans attacking.
-   _Dirty Bertie_:
    -   In "Mud!", Bertie has a nightmare about playing soccer with a team of Miss Boots.
    -   In "Pants!", Bertie has a "Not Wearing Pants" Dream that counts as Anxiety Dreams because he's afraid due to having lost a bet that means he has to go to school in his underwear.
-   In _Dragons of Winter Night_, the protagonists suffer through a particularly horrific nightmare.
-   In _A Game of Thrones_, Eddard Stark has recurring dreams about the death of his sister Lyanna, including a particularly infamous flashback that still continues to inspire Epileptic Trees about the circumstances of her passing. Near the end of the book, while imprisoned, he sees a dream of his dead friend Robert mocking him, only for Robert's visage to crumble away, revealing Littlefinger's face beneath.
    -   In _A Storm of Swords_ Jaime dreams of a woman (implied to be his mother) who laments about how her family has fallen down. The dream turns quickly into the late Kingsguard and Prince Rhaegar blaming Jaime for the death of Rhaegar's family, something that has been haunting Jaime for years.
-   Constantly used in the _Goosebumps_ books, _I Live In Your Basement!_ having the most by far.
-   The nightmare in _How to Eat Fried Worms_.
-   _Harriet the Spy_: Harriet has a nightmare about Ole Golly the nursemaid disappearing.
-   _The Hunger Games_: Katniss' dreams are usually a horrifying mishmash of bad memories and fear-gripped imagination, like everyone getting their tongues cut out or all her loved ones screaming in agony.
-   _Laughing Jack_: The mother has a nightmare occurring in an Amusement Park of Doom, which is implied to be the realm of the titular Monster Clown, where she's led into a circus tent and torn apart by disfigured children before she wakes in a cold sweat.
-   In Geoph Essex's _Lovely Assistant_, the first brief Time Skip starts off with a very weird (and, this being Geoph Essex, initially humorous) situation which rapidly degenerates into a Nightmare Sequence before Jenny wakes up. A lot of the bad dream is stuff she already knows (or thinks she knows), but there's enough Foreshadowing (some subtle, some not) to also qualify it as a bit of a Dream of Things to Come.
-   _Manifestation_: One of the main characters, Tock Zipporah, suffers from a vivid nightmare about a figure from her past.
-   _Max & the Midknights: Battle of the Bodkins_: In chapter 4, Max has a nightmare where she's kicked out of knight school, and her friends leave her for her Bodkin. Max wakes up from her nightmare by sitting right up and going "GAH!".
-   Midway through _Midnight’s Children_, Saleem has a nightmare of his time in the Widows' Hostel, with the Widow depicted as a grotesque, green-and-black monster who tears children in half. The narration for the scene is suitably confusing and chaotic, just like a real dream.
-   _Mog_:
    -   In "Mog the Forgetful Cat", Debbie has a nightmare where a tiger wants to eat her.
    -   In "Mog and the V-E-T", the vet has a nightmare where his office is full of wild animals.
    -   In "Mog on Fox Night", Mog has a "cross dream" where Mr Thomas her owner has thrown out all the eggs in the world.
-   In the _Rainbow Magic_ series, sometimes Jack Frost's mischief causes Rachel and Kirsty to have these.
-   The protagonist of E. F. Benson's "The Room in the Tower" has increasingly ominous dreams about paying a visit to... someone, who keeps sending him off to sleep in that room in the tower. Then, one day, he gets an invitation from a chum, and things go From Bad to Worse.
-   In _The Silver Codex_, Xarissa's dreams are these she has to dream about horrible things happening in town.Tevan has one where his mom blames him for being put in an asylum, and his abusive father say he will turn into him.
-   The _Stories of Nypre_ series mixes this with Dream Within a Dream when Nypre gets trapped from the mind altering effects of the Night Land.
-   In _Those That Wake_, the main characters each have nightmares before their lives are altered.
    -   In the sequel, Mal has recurring nightmares of Man In Suit.
-   _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_: The island where dreams come true. When the sailor joke about what they would find, the man who had been trapped there screams that it's not daydreams, it's _dreams_. Which inspires a proper panic in them. Even after their escape, the man they rescued is in a state of collapse from the horror.
    -   Apparently, everyone saw different things, based on nightmares they'd had. Like a boggart from _Harry Potter_, except it's a whole island.
-   Neshi the Tech Detective in _The Wandering_ has one in the beginning of the story, where he enters a city where people are feasting on one another, and on his exit from it, an army approaches and he gets stabbed by a spear, with a voice calling "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how I weep for thee." The nightmare is later revealed to be shared by various members of the Jerusalemites, who believe that it is actually a prophecy.
-   The authors of _Warrior Cats_ seem to like horrific blood filled nightmares considering how many there have been in the books. Some even feature the characters _drowning in blood_.
    -   A notable example is in _Yellowfang's Secret_, in which Yellowfang is forced to watch kits inflict damage upon each other that is _far_ beyond what even an adult cat could. Some kits are so young that they haven't even opened their eyes yet.
    -   Also, Lionpaw frequently experiences nightmares where he unknowingly kills his friend Heatherpaw.
    -   The trainees in the Dark Forest are subjected to brutal combat training in their dreams each night, and their injuries carry over into the waking world. And if you die in your dream, you die in real life.
-   In _Wet Goddess_:
    -   After leaving to Evergreen State College, Zack has a nightmare of dolphins being confined in wooden boxes and rotting alive. It later turns out to be a message sent by Ruby.
    -   Zack conjures one up himself to show Ruby the taboos of human sexuality.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Big Bad Beetleborgs_ had an episode centered around this trope, in the episode "Booger Man" there was a monster called Booger Man (also known as Booger) who was a boogeyman that came to Hillhurst and gave the house monsters nightmares. Flabber has a nightmare involving the ghost of Edgar Allen Poe. At the end they send him over to the Crustaceons lair to give Les Fortunes nightmares.
-   Played for laughs in the _Blackadder The Third_ episode _Ink and Incapability_ where Blackadder has a nightmare which starts off with Baldrick "waking" him up and ends up with Baldrick turned into an Alsatian. Then Baldrick wakes him up.
    
    "Hang on a second, if we go on like this you're going to turn into an Alsatian again."
    
-   One episode of _Bones_ cold-opens with the titular character having a nightmare related to a recurring Big Bad. After a few very well-crafted snap-cuts and surreal rapid-fire imagery, however, the impact is somewhat reduced when the sequence cuts to a shot of hundreds of versions of the Big Bad, each holding random case-related objects.
-   _Boy Meets World_'s "And Then There Was Shawn". The entirety of the episode, as Shawn had fallen asleep during detention, and it depicted a Slasher Movie scenario where the gang was trapped inside the school with an unknown killer.
-   _The Brittas Empire_: Gavin has one of these in "Gavin Featherly R.I.P", dreaming that the staff is finding him guilty for copying a cassette tape, leading to psychotherapy sessions with Helen.
-   _Criminologist Himura and Mystery Writer Arisugawa_:
    -   Himura suffers from recurrent nightmares where he commits the "beautiful" murder that he's often fantasised of. The sensation of his victim's blood on his hands is so intense that he can still feel it after he's forced himself awake.
    -   Himura's partner, Arisugawa, has nightmares where he fails to stop Himura from falling to the dark side and committing murder, symbolised by Himura falling off a cliff while Arisugawa fails to grab him in time.

    Real Life 

-   Known to be truth in television. Casual nightmares can be horrifying to the extreme, overshadowing the goriest of gratuitous horror films. Reports of dreams such as watching a person being skinned alive, or worse _doing the skinning_ in hyper-realistic detail. What is truly baffling about these dreams is that they can and do occur to people who are well adjusted, and don't reflect reality to a great extent. In other cases, intense horrifying imagery is one indicator of repressed emotions, trauma, and emotional baggage. Even then, the nightmares may seem disproportionately frightening. And God help you if you have nightmares 5 times per week. That'd ruin the relief of rest.
-   Rarely, nightmares can happen so often or become so severe that they escalate into a full-blown illness known as nightmare disorder. People who suffer from it may be frightened of going to sleep again for fear of the horrific imagery their brain will conjure up.
