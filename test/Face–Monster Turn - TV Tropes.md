_"Ma-ya... hurry... run! Before... I change...!! Hur... rry..."_

— **Ulala Serizawa**, just before transforming into a Joker, _Persona 2: Eternal Punishment_

Basically this is when one of the good guys becomes a villain not out of choice, but because they were transformed into one one way or another (this makes it a supertrope to several tropes as outlined below). This can also apply to non-sapient entities, such as computers that go nuts, mons that are Turned Against Their Masters because someone else is giving them orders, and so on. As long as it was happy with its allegiance and something other than its own whims changed it, it fits.

## Subtropes include:

    When a protagonist who has been fighting monsters is literally transformed into one such monster (assuming their allegiance changes).
