_"They ruled the high school. Decided what was in, who was popular... it was kind of like the Soviet Secret Police if they cared a lot about shoes."_

In a High School series, there's pretty much always a jerkass, if not evil, popular girl. We'll call her the Alpha Bitch and give her an entry of her own, otherwise she might tell all the cute boys that we have smelly man feet <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Older girls might count if they're part of a sorority.

She always has a posse of well-dressed, mean girls with her (two to four girls at the minimum), who don't really say anything except to parrot her opinions and attitudes—sort of the high school version of Evil Minions meets Satellite Character. If the posse members are slightly more developed, expect at least a devoted second-in-command (who may or may not be an insecure mess), a pretty but dimwitted follower (who occasionally overlaps with the second-in-command), and possibly a new girl, who will be briefly suckered in by the Alpha Bitch.

The posse members might be just as nasty as the leader (if not secretly more so), because Popular Is Evil. Or they could be a Peer-Pressured Bully who joins in on the harassment of less popular students to stay on the queen bee’s good side, and thus keep her school status.

They are often Gossipy Hens as well. They are very unlikely to be A Friend in Need, even to each other. May also overlap with Terrible Trio<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Nice, Mean, and In-Between (If the Brainless Beauty is a Token Good Teammate and Kindhearted Simpleton), and always a Freudian Trio.

It's also possible for a Girl Posse led by a Lovable Alpha Bitch to be portrayed positively, or at least neutrally, although this is pretty rare. If sorority women are portrayed as an older Girl Posse, see Sinister Sorority Sisters.

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Chieko has a pair of them in _All-Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku_ _TV_. Except for one Lower-Deck Episode, all they did was pop up behind her saying, "Yes, what Chieko said is right." They had names, but it only highlighted how unimportant they were; "Hidariko" and "Migiko" translate to just "left-girl" and "right-girl".
-   _Beastars_ has Mizuchi the harlequin rabbit and her two friends. They torment Haru constantly for her pride and promiscuity.
-   Asai Yuriko, Yamano Minako, and Ayuhara Erika from _Boys over Flowers_, though they don't have nearly the popularity or influence that the F4 does.
-   In _Candy Candy_, Eliza has a two-person one in the Boarding School arc. It's formed by Beta Bitch Louisa and a redheaded fat girl who is never named in the story.
-   Megumi Furuta and Miyuki Sonobe from _Dear Brother_, companions to Aya Misaki. Episode 30, however, gives them some Hidden Depths since they truly like and support Aya... and the Sorority seniors try to use their affection for her to their own benefit.
-   Akina Shinozaki of _Don't Become an Otaku, Shinozaki-san!_ was part of one in her middle school years. Her hopes to become part of a new one in high school were dashed when she was ill the first full week and all the cliques and posses had already formed by the time she could attend. She instead befriends otaku Kaede with the intent of making her "normal" only to become more of an otaku herself.
-   Subverted in _Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure_, where Mitsuki Rara's posse are nice girls, they even perform a Heel–Face Turn later in the series.
-   Yuki's fanclub in _Fruits Basket_. The president of the club is Motoko, the Alpha Bitch. They're intensely jealous of main character Tohru since she's friends with Yuki and constantly plot to get rid of her, but their schemes never get very far since they're scared of Tohru's friends Uotani and Hanajima.
-   Miyabi's teacher-hating schoolgirl gang in _Great Teacher Onizuka_.
-   The very first _Hell Girl_ episode deals with this topic, as the Alpha Bitch Yoshimi Kuroda uses hers to make her rival Mayumi Yamaguchi's life total Hell.
-   Subversion: Julie and Charlotte attempt to become Layla's Girl Posse in _Kaleido Star_ to get back at Sora for being The Fool, but thanks to some bits of Character Development midway through the first season, not only they start being nicer to Sora, but they start helping Layla for _selfless_ reasons and not to suck up to her.
-   _Little Witch Academia_: Academic Alpha Bitch Diana Cavendish is usually followed and surrounded by her roommates, Hannah England and Barbara Parker, who are very loyal to Diana and tend to mock and bully anyone they perceived as being below them and Diana, Akko being their most frequent target. In fact, in the TV series, they're often worst than Diana. Daryl Cavendish, Diana's Evil Aunt, also has a posse of her own via her daughters, who are just as bad as their mother.
-   In the beginning of the series, Sae from _Peach Girl_ basically has the _whole school_ under her finger. Most of the guys are head over heels for her, and some of the girls would frequently compliment her and follow her around.
-   In _Powerpuff Girls Z_, the Princess' only friends are these, and once she ditched them over a fight. They then received powers from the dark Z rays, which made them posse anyone they wanted, inflating their ego and making them selfish, and when using their powers in conjunction with Princess' they actually made her stronger.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_:
    -   Nanami's trio of flunkies, although they are more independent than usual (specially Keiko).
    -   That's for the anime only. Nanami doesn't appear in the manga in person (only in a photo), and the role of the posse is taken over by some real bitches.
-   Natsumi, Minami and Kumi, the "partners-in-crime" of the Unlucky Childhood Friend Otome Katou in _School Days_. Otome herself is a subversion (she's popular at school, but is more of a sportswoman than a cheerleader or Rich Bitch), but boy do these four act like school bullies when they're together and poor Kotonoha is near...
-   Mihaya, Miyoko and Hiroka from _Shadow Star_ are under the "orders" of one _really_ nasty Alpha Bitch named Aki Honda. When one of their victims, Hiroko, gets sick of it and acquires a "mon" named Oni... Aki and Mihaya die in very gruesome manners, Hiroka gets thrown out a window, and Miyoko survives, but loses a leg.
-   Kafuko from _Space Pirate Mito_ has a two-girl posse, who not only carry out her orders, but occasionally carry her and/or props for dramatic effect, and in one instance even gave a Noblewoman's Laugh for her.
-   The Gambee pilots of _Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry_.
-   Even though they were clearly created with this trope in mind, Tenjouin Saki of _To Love Ru_ and her two followers are not left out of the characters given backgrounds to create decently well-rounded characters by themselves. Saki starts out as an Ojou antagonist, and then develops into her own character with her love interest outside of the main Unwanted Harem even.
-   Subverted in _Toradora!_. Ami picks up a posse as soon as she transfers to the school, but they're both nice girls who get along with the protagonist clique, and even tell Ami to dial it back when she gets bitchy.
-   _Umineko: When They Cry_: Ange's classmates during her time at St. Lucia Academy.

    Fan Works 

-   The Brat Pack from 72 Hours.

Ermine responds with a Roaring Rampage of Revenge that ends with two of the posse members dead and a third one maimed.
    -   _The Lumberjack and the Tree-Elf_ features a non-bullying version in the 57th Games when Blight's district partner Charlie teams up with two other outlier girls, Bobbi and Qin Li, dubbed "the three princesses" by the Careers, throughout training and the Games. None of them are particularly skilled combatants (except against a few mutts) and at least one (Charlie) had a relatively upper class upbringing (being the Mayor's daughter). They manage to avoid playing the Games and lay low until the field is narrowed more than halfway down and Bobbi tries to betray and poison the other two's soup, only to end dead herself when Charlie pours some of her soup into Bobbi's bowl out of concern that she isn't eating enough.

    Film — Animation 

-   In _The Barbie Diaries_, Dawn and Regan serve as this for Barbie's Alpha Bitch rival Raquelle, being her cronies who follow her around everywhere. They're portrayed slightly more sympathetically than is usual for the trope: Barbie briefly befriends them, and when they call her out for discussing their confidences to her on air for the school news report, it serves as Barbie's wake-up call to reconcile with her own friends.
-   _Lilo & Stitch_ gives us Mertle Edmonds and her droogs. Further showcased in _The Series_.
-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks_:
    -   Main antagonists the Dazzlings look and act like one, with Adagio Dazzle as the Alpha Bitch, Aria Blaze as the Beta Bitch, and Sonata Dusk as the Brainless Beauty. However, they're actually extradimensional Emotion Eater sea creatures, so they're more sinister than usual for this trope. They're also Ambiguously Related and might be sisters.
    -   Photo Finish and Trixie Lulamoon have two cronies each respectively, and are also antagonistic in this movie, although this is mostly the result of the Dazzlings' Hate Plague. Without this, they are more or less ordinary girls.
-   In _Turning Red_, Stacy Frick and her friends are setup to be this but when she and her friends come across Mei in red panda form in the bathroom, she doesn't bully her, and even finds her panda form adorable, leading her to inspire the main four to raise money for concert tickets.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Tiffany and Brooke are this to Alpha Bitch Danielle in _Badgirls From Valley High_. Tiffany is the Beta Bitch, while Brooke is the Token Good Teammate who is kind but is easily intimidated and manipulated by Danielle and Tiffany.
-   _Blame (2017)_: Sophie and Ellie follow Melissa around, doing as she does at all times. Ellie however abandons her after being wronged by Melissa.
-   _Boy Eats Girl_: Shallow popular girls Cheryl, Glenda and Charlotte generally stick together both before and after the Zombie Apocalypse starts.
-   _Bring It On_ (and more of its sequels) have the protagonist move in and out of this sort of clique.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Buffy and her fellow boy-obsessed, academically challenged mallrats Nicki, Kimberly and Jennifer. The group breaks up due to the secrecy Buffy has to engage in and her own character growth.
-   _Candyman (2021):_ Candyman attacks a clique of five unpleasant popular girls in the bathroom, although they're less stereotypically Girly Girl than most examples of the trope (one of them dresses kind of like a Tomboy and another is an androgynous stoner with a shaved head).
-   _Can't Hardly Wait:_ Amanda hangs out with a trio of shallow, pop-culture fixated girls who date Dumb Jocks. They aren't exactly True Companions, but they at least make an effort (telling Amanda they think she's prettier than Gwyneth Paltrow, then admitting that isn't true once she's out of earshot).
-   Shelby's "ladies-in-waiting" in _A Cinderella Story_ seem to include the school's cheerleaders, notably Caitlyn and Madison, as well as Sam's stepsisters.
-   In _The Craft_, Nancy's posse subverts this trope in terms of their low social standing, but plays it entirely straight in terms of organizational structure and clique mentality. While Nancy is the clear Alpha Bitch and Sarah is the obvious Naïve Newcomer, neither Bonnie or Rochelle fit any obvious tropes connected with The Ditz - another position usually utilized with this trope - and instead share the spotlight as dual Beta Bitches; one of which has a severe case of I Just Want to Be Beautiful, and the other just wants to give a racist bully A Taste of Her Own Medicine.
-   This dynamic was affectionately parodied in John Waters's _Cry-Baby_. Despite coming from rather damaged backgrounds, the "Drakes" are completely tolerant and well-meaning while the "squares" border on sociopathic. Accordiing to John Waters, there actually were both "Squares" and "Drakes" in Baltimore around that time.
-   Arguably deconstructed in _Dance Together_: Main character Holly is part of one with some of her fellow dance students, but they don't seem to bully anyone except Holly herself after she hurts her leg and has to stop. Alpha Bitch stand-in Zoey is motivated by jealousy and feeling pressured by her parents to get a scholarship that Holly seemed like a shoe-in for while their friends Tiffany and Tia are revealed to feel highly conflicted about the whole thing due to their long-term friendship with Holly and want to break ranks with Zoey, but realize that it would also break up their dance team before a competition. In the final act, one by one, they ultimately reconcile with Holly, and also start hanging out with Holly's new friends.
-   _Darby and the Dead_: Bree, Piper and Taylor were Capri's friends (though it turns out they didn't care too much about her), following her around everywhere while she was alive.
-   _The Final_ has the bitch trio of Heather, Bridget and Kelly. Heather is the ringleader and main tormentor, Kelly is her just-as-bad Dragon (although she is redeemed by the end, killing herself -or at least trying to\- over what happens to her friends), and Bridget eventually turns out to be much more sympathetic than the other two.
-   The Pink Ladies in _Grease_, to a degree. This movie had _two_ sets of such posses (actually four, if you count both male and female). On the one side for each sex was the contingent of more prototypically 1950s kids who dress like model students, act (superficially) polite, and suck up to all the authority figures they can. Then there are the Pink Ladies and their male counterparts, the T-Birds, who wear tight pants and pink jackets, smoke, swear, play mean-spirited pranks, and generally act rude. Both cliques are shown to be flawed, but it's implied that the Pink Ladies are somewhat less flawed because they're at least honest about their shortcomings. The lesson, I guess, is that it's not really fashion or attitude that makes you cool, but a lack of hypocrisy.
-   _Heathers_ is named after the girl posse in the film, of which three out of four girls all have the given name "Heather". H. Chandler is the Alpha Bitch, H. Duke is jealous of Chandler's power, H. McNamara is a meek follower, and Veronica is the newcomer who actually hates being part of the group and did it solely to become In with the In Crowd.
-   _Holidays_: Heidi in "Valentine's Day" has a gaggle of followers who never initiate the teasing of Maxine, but always join in once Heidi starts.
-   _Jawbreaker_ is about how one of these fell apart.
-   A majority of the plot of _Mean Girls_ (who provide the page image) deeply delved into the phenomenon. Manipulative Bitch Regina George rules over the school, with Professional Butt-Kisser Gretchen and Dumb Blonde Karen as her sidekicks.
-   Kirsten, Ginny, and Kristen from _Never Been Kissed_ are dumb, mean, interchangeable popular girls.
-   _The New Guy:_ Cheerleaders Danielle, Courtney and Carmen hang out together a lot and serve as lust objects for most of the boys. Danielle is a subversion of the Alpha Bitch type in general, being actually level-headed and humble from the get-go. Courtney and Carmen are a little less smart and a lot more flirty, but ultimately pleasant enough and even at their worst don't actively bully anyone.
-   In _Prom Night (2008)_, the blonde Alpha Bitch Crissy has a pair of brunette side girls who follow her everywhere.
-   _Prom Wars_: Diana, Jen B., Jen L., Tess, Meg, and Alex are beautiful and popular student government leaders who hang around each other a lot and can get the entire senior class to follow their lead in strange activities. There is some dissent between them about which of the rival boys’ schools they favor, but the six girls usually get along and all of them have Give Geeks a Chance moments. Tess, Meg, and Alice seem to have their own smaller posse within the group and are sometimes seen hanging out and enforcing contest rules without their leader Diana or the Jens.
-   The A Group from _Romy and Michele's High School Reunion_. Sadly, only one of them actually made something out of herself. When the leading Alpha Bitch tries to embellish the success of her and the other members, the one who is successful lets out a You Keep Telling Yourself That.
-   _Safety Patrol:_ Hannah is often accompanied by her fellow cheerleaders who don't get much development and have a tough air about them. Unusually for the trope, Hannah and her friends are heroic characters who stand up to the local bullies. They're also the middle school's Goths.
-   _The Sisterhood of Night_ gives us Mary Warren's Sisterhood.
-   Penny from _Sky High (2005)_ is an entire Girl Posse unto herself (she can make copies of herself).
-   _The Woods_: Alpha Bitch Samantha is sometimes followed around by five or six scowling cronies when she bullies Heather. Interestingly, Samantha is shown to have been Good All Along and secretly resisting the witches who control the school, whether or not her cronies are as well is unclear.

    Literature 

-   _4 Kids in 5E and 1 Crazy Year_: Destiny, Ah Kum, Ashley (who some students compare to a Disney Princess), Amber, Chelsea, and later Natalia,Carmen, Dalma, and Tiffany are a close-knit group of popular girls who spend a lot of time gossiping about stuff like crushes and fashion, passing notes, and (before coming to 5E and find a teacher and subject matter they can respect) cutting class, although they are a multicultural group who enjoy art and writing and don't bully anyone, even if some of their classmates initially find them annoying.

-   In Judy Blume's _Blubber_, Alpha Bitch Wendy turns the entire class against overweight, awkward Linda, but appoints a Girl Posse of Beta Bitches, including Caroline, Donna, and narrator Jill, as Linda's principal tormentors along with herself. Later on, Jill, after challenging Wendy's authority, is demoted to the class's Butt-Monkey and Linda takes Jill's place in the Girl Posse, more than willing to participate in bullying her former bully.
-   Among the minor vampires in the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ novel _Mortal Fear_ are a trio of of former cheerleaders who spend most of their brief page time insulting each other's weight and ogling a pile of shoes.
-   _Charlie's Story_, by Maeve Friel, has Charlotte "Charlie" Collins, a student in an Irish girls' school, bullied and harassed in exceptionally cruel ways by pretty, smart, and popular Alpha Bitch Lorna and Beta Bitches Tara, Natalie and Monica, who single Charlie out for torment simply because Charlie's mother abandoned her as a baby and Charlie's family is allegedly the Irish version of white trash.
-   Sherrie Adams in _Circle of Three_ is the alpha girl of "The Graces," though the group slowly breaks apart throughout the series.
-   The whole point of _The Clique_, also known as The Pretty Commitee with Massie Block as the leader with her friends, Alicia Rivera, Dylan Marvil, and Kristen Gregory.
-   Melodía of _The Dinosaur Lords_, as a princess of Nuevaropa, is forced to have one, composed of her fellow noblewomen. While they're not quite stereotypical (one's a Drama Queen, the other's The Cynic, yet other a Conspiracy Theorist), she's not happy to have them.
-   In _Don't Look Back_, Sam and her deceased friend Cassie had this in the form of Veronica, Candy, and Lauren. Their personalities are slightly more varied than the typical example: Veronica is a Jerkass and Candy is a Brainless Beauty, but Lauren is a kind Shrinking Violet and the only one to continue being friends with Sam, even after she disavows the other two.
-   MacKenzie, the Alpha Bitch of _Dork Diaries_, has one, the most prominent member being her best friend Jessica.

-   In _Nighttime Is My Time_ there were a group of seven girls in the same graduating class at Stonecroft Academy, who were close friends and sat together at lunch every day. Most of these girls were considered some of the brightest and most popular students at Stonecroft; unfortunately some of them were also bullies, especially ringleader Alison Kendall and her best friend Laura Wilcox. Over the past twenty years, the Owl has been killing each girl in the order they sat at the lunch table and now there are only two remaining.
-   _Chrysanthemum_: Victoria is the most vocal about teasing Chrysanthemum for her long name, while her friends Jo and Rita follow her example.
-   _The Secret Circle_: Faye, Deborah and Suzan (the later two of whom are Adapted Out of the TV adaptation form one of these, although their more feared than popular due to their witch powers and mischievous streaks. Unusually, rather than being their own unit, the three are part of a larger circle of friends/fellow witches who are a lot more down to Earth, and Suzan (and eventually Deborah) show nicer sides to the protagonist. Cassie, the protagonist, joins a second trio of girls from the circle, who are more ethereal and kind-hearted (although no less feared by their normal classmates), although she ends up being caught between the two groups.
-   _The Secret Runners of New York_ features a quartet of psychopathic prep school girls who engage in time travel for thrill-seeking. They kidnap classmates who get them mad (a friend of theirs who outshined the eldest girl in a debutante showing, a girl with Down's Syndrome who the Beta Bitch got into trouble for bullying, etc.) and strand them in the Bad Future to be killed by cannibals. They have several male friends, but the boys don't know about the murders. The narrator (a New Transfer Student) becomes the Token Good Teammate of the group's female members.
-   _Secret Santa (2007)_: Each book features a beautiful but insufferable Alpha Bitch with a couple of more likable sidekicks. Typically, the posse breaks up near the end of the book when the sidekicks assert themselves (due to Character Development in the first two books and Backstabbing the Alpha Bitch for her boyfriend in book 3), leaving a vacuum open for a new girl posse to show up in the next book.
-   _Spy School_: From Ben's old middle school, Elizabeth Pasternak and her friends Kate and Chloe seem to have one, although they aren't bullies and don't seem particularly shallow.
-   Jessica Wakefield and her pals in the _Sweet Valley High_ books and TV series, and more specifically The Unicorn Club in the _Sweet Valley Twins_ book series.
-   _These Broken Stars_: Lilac is well-known in the tabloids for travelling with an entourage of similarly well-dressed girls. What's less well-known is that they're bodyguards. And that they report back to her father.
-   In _Two Can Keep A Secret_ (by the author of _One of Us is Lying_) there's Katrin, Brooke and Viv (a Blonde, Brunette, Redhead group no less), who hang out together shopping a lot, cheerleading and are the homecoming queen front runners. Interestingly, Viv is arguably the most bitchy, and that's more from insecurity about being less popular than the other two. The three are the most catty with each other instead of the unpopular students). By the end of the book it's revealed that each of the three has a Dark Secret. Brooke is having an affair with Katrin's dad and witnessed him commit a hit-and-run, for which he later killed her. Katrin suspects that her dad killed Brooke and is protecting him. Viv is behind some malicious graffiti, vandalism and threatening notes simply to provide a news story for herself to write about in the school paper.
-   In Lauren Kate novel _Unforgiven_ the most popular girl at school, Chloe King (daughter of a media mogul and generally a Rich Bitch) has a bubblegum pop band "Perceived Slights", whose members Kara, June and Teresa are always around, wear similar clothes (eg. suede minidresses of different pastel colours) and generally follow her lead.

    Live-Action TV

-   _The Amanda Show_ skit, The Girls' Room has Amber (the popular Alpha Bitch leader), Sheila (the tough mean girl), Tammy (the exchange student from - whom she was born in - Tennessee and moved to a new state), and Debbie (a girl who likes eggs and is a dumb brunette).
-   _Amber Brown (2022)_: Hannah, the school's Alpha Bitch, is always seen with four other girls doting on her. One even repeats back what she says to other girls.
-   _The Brady Bunch_: The Boosters in the Season 4 episode "Today I Am a Freshman," the group Marcia wants to join. She ultimately doesn't—in part because she failed her initiation (thanks to Peter's volcano) and because she ultimately saw that this Girl Posse isn't whom she wanted to be associated with.
-   Cordelia in early episodes of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ had a group of yes-girls, the Cordettes, which included future vampire Harmony. As shown in the quote, Angel later likened them to the KGB, but with nicer shoes. Cordelia's "friends" give her a taste of her own medicine when she starts to date Xander.
-   _Community_ gave this trope a great sendup in the episode "The Aerodynamics of Gender". Britta, Annie, and Shirley decided to take a Women's study course for some girl time, but are taken aback when Abed says he wants to go too. A Girl Posse of 3 Alpha Bitches (One of which is played by Hilary Duff) start harassing them, and Abed quickly zings them back without breaking a sweat. Rather than thank him and call it a day, Britta, Annie, and Shirley decide they can use this to their advantage and send Abed to insult every girl in school that has ever been mean to them. Eventually, Britta, Annie, and Shirley's egos completely swell and they become the ruling Girl Posse of Alpha Bitches themselves.. Also, because it's Abed, there's a parody of Robocop in there. But Britta thinks he's saying "Rowboat Cop".

-   Christine, the Alpha Bitch of _Dead Gorgeous_, has a band of loyal sychophants.
-   Nicely subverted on _Freaks and Geeks_. Vicki Applebee is the show's resident Alpha Bitch, but even most of the other popular girls at McKinley High (including Cindy Sanders) have a problem with her. And Cindy, probably one of the most popular girls at McKinley herself, is nice to everyone on the social totem pole.
-   _GCB_: "The Foxes" are the popular clique at the High School. When she was younger, Amanda was the head of the Foxes. The current generation of Foxes is lead by Cricket's daughter Alexandra. Amanda initially worries that her daughter might be labeled a "Javelina" (ugly) by the Foxes, but it turns out she's welcomed into their group like her mother.
-   Some of these appear as one-off characters in _The George Lopez Show_. One of the earlier ones were a trip of girls whom Carmen and her friend Toby tried to befriend—they were mercilessly cruel to Toby and even made Carmen turn against her so she could be popular like them. And no, they weren't even nice to Carmen either.
-   Paris in _Gilmore Girls_ had her two sidekicks, Madeline and Louise, whilst she and Rory were at Chilton High.
-   _Glee_ had the Terrible Trio version. In Season 1 when Quinn was the Alpha Bitch, Santana (Beta Bitch) and Brittany (Brainless Beauty) were her main right hand bitches. When Quinn became pregnant and kicked off the Cheerios, Brittany and Santana got their own distinct personalities and became beloved characters in their own right.
-   _Gossip Girl_ both plays this one straight (Kati, Isabel, Hazel, Penelope) and subverts it (The bespectacled Asian nerd who routinely receives the highest test scores of anyone in the school eventually becomes one of Blair's henchmen).
-   Trisha Yates, Pamela Cartwright and Susi Mac Mahon in _Grange Hill_
-   Kate and her one-dimensional interchangeable cheerleading squad from _Lizzie McGuire_.
-   Played with in _Pretty Little Liars_: the four main characters were the girl posse to Alison DiLaurentis, who is, of course, dead. Now, the other four effectively remain this, but without a clear leader. Also, the four of them increasingly become social outcasts as the story progresses.
-   In _renegadepress.com_'s "Giving Yourself Away", this is Deconstructed; Crystal is torn when she discovers that in order to join the cool clique in school, she has to perform oral sex.
-   Libby and her one-dimensional interchangeable goon squad from _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_.
-   _Schitt's Creek_: In Season 4, Klair, an old acquaintance of Alexis, shows up in town with her posse of sycophants. Klair is manipulative and even downright abusive to her posse, but she offers Alexis a PR job and the chance to join the posse and live in New York. Alexis sees Klair for what she is and decides to stay in Schitt's Creek.
-   Conversational Troping: Given the name "Blonde-tourage" in an episode of _Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony_.
-   _Summer Heights High_ has its version of the popular Alpha Bitches who dubbed themselves "The Hot Girls".
-   Alana Rivera in _That's So Raven_ and its spin-off _Raven's Home_ has her number-two follower Muffy, and the gigantic Large Ham Loca.
-   Gigi's friends in _Wizards of Waverly Place._ They suck up to Gigi so much that they actually get plastic surgery so that their noses will look like hers.

    Podcasts 

-   The _Cool Kids Table_ game _Creepy Town_ has one dubbed The Plastics and consisting of Katie, Stacey, and Veronica (though Stacey is somewhat nicer than the others).

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew, The Radiant Rain and The Lovely Lacey, perhaps putting on their best display of this trope SHIMMER where they picked up a third member in "Coventry's Loudest" Jetta and became the International Home Wrecking Crew. Rain, Lacey and Jetta each think of themselves as the closest thing to perfect in all possible ways, and in fact have fought about it several times, so what exactly holds their friendship together, or keeps them coming back together, varies from promotion to promotion(in IWA Mid-South it was hatred of Mickie Knuckles, in FIP it seemed to fatigue with fighting one another, in ROH it was the betterment of society through Jimmy Jacobs and his Age Of The Fall, in SHIMMER it may have been lesbianism or habituated attachment, etc). This _didn't_ apply to their WSU expansion into Rain's Army, as Rain was apparently off her meds and seemed more intent on battering WSU's roster until no one was left than tormenting people, though when the army disbanded after Mercedes Martinez got Rain to calm down, the crew returned to form. For years Martinez mistook "no longer trying to kill me" with "close friends", as they still disliked and talked bad about her.
-   The Home Wrecking Crew would later encounter a rival Southern Belle posse in Team Blondage, made up of Amber O'Neal, Krissy Vaine, Lollipop and GeeStar. They were the first in pro wrestling to be based on _Mean Girls_. Luckily for those sharing locker rooms with them, Blondage are rarely encountered in larger numbers than two. (O'Neal and GeeStar don't always get along)
-   Vince's Devils, Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle were already hanging out like best friends by the time they moved to _Raw_ (from _SmackDown!_) and underwent a Face–Heel Turn. They teamed up with Victoria for the sole purpose of tormenting the new girl from the Diva search, Ashley Massaro. There was some Ho Yay between Victoria and Candice and Torrie bought a dust mop dog, so she could rub its ass in the faces of their opponents. When not acting as a bully posse they also served as mistresses to the boss, hence the name.
-   In a rare example of a gimmick that TNA has done to perfection, The Beautiful People are a stunning example of the trope in wrestling. Started with Angelina Love as the Alpha Bitch, Velvet Sky as the Beta Bitch and Madison Rayne as their personal butt kisser (Omega Bitch perhaps?). Later Love got deported so Sky and Rayne became co Alpha Bitches with Lacey Von Erich in the role of the Brainless Beauty who follows the other two. A pornstar sorority whose mission is to eliminate the ugly, they were initially baby face duo Velvet Love Entertainment until they attacked Roxxi Laveaux for turning down their offer to give Laveaux a makeover.
-   Though it's only two people, this is still more or less the gimmick of Team LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool) in the WWE. They make fun of everyone's "flaws" and then question their lack of friends
-   Essentially what Team Bella became, after the twins, who were dedicated to holding down every other woman around them, more or less making Alicia Fox their minion.
-   Fellow Diva revolutionaries Team B.A.D. and Team PCB could count as well, as they were put together as "counter balances" to Team Bella but only the latter turned out more likable.
-   Following in the wake of power stables like Valkyrie, Valifonria and C4 was the Cutie Pie Club, Shine Wrestling's first girl posse. Not only did they immediately prove to be less threatening than the three groups that came before them, they also proved to be one of the most dysfunctional girl posses in pro wrestling. All the same, Candy Cartwright is an alpha bitch through and through. A screaming Attention Whore, she is primarily concerned with her own looks, advancement and whatever luxuries she can indulge in. Kiera Hogan, whom the group is technically named after, is firmly in the role of the beta bitch, being the only person Cartwright seems to genuinely consider a friend but usually happy to go along with whatever Cartwright is doing and not assertive enough to voice contrary opinions when they do become apparent. Aria Blake is the omega bitch, whom Cartwright seemingly keeps around to abuse and belittle but _is_ sometimes willing to speak against her and Dementia D'Rose is The Brute who is basically there because her singles record in SHINE wasn't very good.

    Roleplay 

-   The Sisterhood of _Survival of the Fittest_'s Bathurst High, most of them probably having about the same Alpha Bitch levels. V3 character Melina Frost's profile refers to her having been the leader of a similar group at Southridge, but this never came up.

    Theatre 

-   Charlotte, Cassie, and Molly in _13_ serve as this for Kendra and Lucy
-   _Cyrano de Bergerac_: This play is not set in high school, but De Guiche has the Spear Counterpart to the Girl Posse: The Cool Crowd, a crowd of hangers-on who bow to his every whim and help him victimize whomever he decides to pick on (or, in the case of Viscount De Valvert, they at least try to help De Guiche victimize Roxane and Cyrano). Lampshaded by the Marquises in Act I, Scene III, when one of them recognizes they don't like De Guiche, but it's best to make their bow to him:
    
    **First marquis:** (_watching De Guiche, who comes down from Roxane's box, and crosses the pit surrounded by obsequious noblemen, among them the Viscount de Valvert_) He pays a fine court, your De Guiche!  
    **Second Marquis:** Faugh!... Another Gascon!  
    **First Marquis:** Ay, but the cold, supple Gascon — that is the stuff success is made of!  
    Believe me, we had best make our bow to him.
    
-   _Heathers_ has the Heathers and Veronica, with Heather Chandler as the Alpha Bitch, Heather Duke as the Beta Bitch until Heather Chandler is murdered and Duke takes her place as the alpha and Heather Mcnamara as the Brainless Beauty. Veronica has shades of the Beta Bitch when she is tempted into joining the Heathers, but later she subverts it when she ditches them.
-   The bird girls in _Seussical The Musical_ are Mayzie's girl posse as well as being a Greek Chorus

    Video Games 

-   Raspberyll has one of these in the form of Asuka and Kyoko in _Disgaea 3_ - Of course, since _Disgaea_ demons believe in Bad Is Good and Good Is Bad, the posse's decided that they'll earn their delinquency points by being the biggest goodies-two-shoes they can hope to be.
-   _Growing Up_ has one of these in Alicia, bully who leads the popular clique around.
-   _Yandere Simulator_ has Musume Ronshaku and her group of friends, Kokoro Momoiro, Kashiko Murasaki, Hoshiko Mizudori and Hana Daidaiyama. They're a group of popular Gyaru Girls, with the same style of clothing and accessories, who bully unpopular students. More specifically, Musume is the one who actively bullies someone while the others point out and laugh.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Little Busters!_ has the softball juniors for Sasami. Each time Rin fights with Sasami, she must battle them first: they're weak, and hold half-eaten food owned by Sasami to heal themselves. Apart from this and, at one point, kicking a cat to enrage Rin, they do exactly nothing plot-worthy. Riki even refers to them as minions at one point.

    Web Animation 

-   In _The Crazy Kids Of Grade 5_, Kelly is surrounded by her posse of Shelley and Nelly.
-   In _EVERY SIMS MACHINIMA EVER (Parody)_, the posse consists of Madylynne, her explicitly token black friend Jessica, and Ella's former best friend Chloe. They all just make mean comments at Ella's appearance, to the point where she gets plastic surgery and a tan.
-   _The Most Popular Girls in School_:
    -   Mackenzie, Brittnay, and Trisha.
    -   Shay, Cameron, and Mikayla.
    -   Tanya, Taylor, and Trisha 2.

    Webcomics 

-   _Alice and the Nightmare_ has Elsie, Tillie and Lacie of the "mean girl" variety - they latch onto Alice as the Queen's protege and practice Fantastic Racism against Edith.
-   _Bittersweet Candy Bowl_: Daisy briefly falls in with one of these, but is dumped by them later on. Subverted in that a few members of the group later reveal that the "leader" of the posse was not much liked by THEM either, so they continue to hang out with Daisy.
-   Subverted in _Cheer!_ twice: The Ekaltsew Cheer team, who are shown as buffoonish and stupid would-be enemies of the Tandy Cheer team, and with Sarah and Karen, who eventually abandon their leader, Tamara, after one hare-brained revenge scheme too many.
-   _Drowtales_: from left to right: Kyo, Chrys, Naal, Shinae, and Kiel. Subverted when Chrys and Kyo are wrongfully imprisoned, Naal turns out to be ill, Shinae is shown to be a Jerkass Woobie, and Kiel's dream job is to be the series' Knight in Shining Armor.
-   _Eerie Cuties_: Melissa Hellrune (pictured here) is the leader of her own clique at Charybdis Heights. As seen, she antagonizes Layla Delacroix, by trying to dethrone her as the school's most popular girl and plots to steal her boyfriend while she is at it.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Lucy and Rhoda are flunkies to queen bee Diane at Moperville South HS as seen here. Mildly subverted in Lucy's downright flippant and sarcastic manner towards Diane and Diane actually caring about Rhoda.
-   In _Everyday Heroes_, Goldie was the queen of Jane's high school. The trope is somewhat subverted in that Goldie seemed to be a benevolent despot. Jane was set to inherit the title during her senior year until she dropped out of school.

-   _Penny and Aggie_ has Penny's group consisting of Sara, Michelle, and later also Katy-Ann and Brandi, who Subverts the trope since the girls actually care about each other. It is however Played Straight with Karen's Meg, Samantha, Charlotte and Cyndi.

-   Before her fall from grace, Morita in _Red String_ had a couple of lackeys — one with pigtails and one with short black hair. They followed her around and almost never said anything, but giggled and smirked at Morita's cruelty.

    Web Original 

-   Sooni of _Tales of MU_ got her Cat Girl Girl Posse the old fashioned way: daddy bought them for her.
-   Ami, Emi, Umi, and, at least in the beginning, Aki in _Sailor Nothing_.
-   _Whateley Universe_ examples: at Superhero School Whateley Academy, Solange has her Girl Posse of Flicker and Fade. Hekate has her own posse of Spellbinder and Conjure until she's forced to flee from a Sidhe curse, and the Yellow Queen has the rest of the Whateley Martial Arts Cheerleaders (even though Whateley has no intermural sports teams).
-   _Worm_ has Emma, Sophia, and Madison, three girls who managed, through a prolonged campaign of abuse, to drive the protagonist Taylor into a nervous breakdown and Traumatic Superpower Awakening before the events of the story, and continue this abuse throughout.

    Web Videos 

-   _Youth & Consequences_: Lovable Alpha Bitch Farrah leads one with Plain, Jayne and Hurley. Stacey was a former member and forms one herself later.

    Western Animation 

-   _Amphibia_ made the interesting choice of being a series about a girl posse, with Sasha Waybright being the manipulative, bossy and mean Alpha Bitch, Marcy Wu being the smart Beta Bitch that ends up being a betrayer of the group and main character Anne Boonchuy being third member who is neither particularly smart or mean.
-   The show _Angela Anaconda_ has Nanette Manoire and the Copy-Cat Clone Club, who, whenever Nanette came up with a plan, the first would typically say, "That's a great idea!" And the second would parrot, "Well, I think that's a great idea EVEN MORE".
-   In _As Told by Ginger_ things are turned on their heads a little, while Courtney Gripling is the leader of the Lucky Junior High girl posse it is her second-in-command, Miranda Killgallen, who acts like the Alpha Bitch. Courtney herself is the Lovable Alpha Bitch who has several satellites following her around. Mipsy Mipson counts as a Beta Bitch who usually fills in for Miranda when she is unavailable, though ironically she's even _meaner_ than Miranda is.
-   _Atomic Betty_'s Penelope Lang has her own posse in the form of two girls named Megan and Sarah who sycophantically toady up to her all the time.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ both uses this and subverts it.
    -   Princess Azula's posse are fully realized characters in their own right, and Mai and Ty Lee are not exactly enthusiastic supporters. In fact, they _have_ largely been told by the would-be-future ruler of the world that they have no choice, Mai's boredom with life aside. Despite this, and their eventual, perhaps inevitable break with her, they _are_ a terrifically efficient fighting force, and are wise enough to keep their ruthless leader happy, as far as she can be. To their opponents, their front must seem incredibly unified and as intimidating as any group of mindless minions, even when the target is not cornered by a locker or such.
    -   Another (very minor) Girl Posse appears in the episode "Tales of Ba Sing Se", where they pick on Toph and call her ugly. Though Toph and Katara deal with them and send them packing in the end.
-   The Cute Dolls from _Bump in the Night_. All of them are pretty stuck-up and snobby.
-   The Fashion Club from _Daria_ is an atypical example, for a few reasons. For one, Divergent Character Evolution kicked in so that each of the four girls eventually had a distinct personality, and to a degree, Character Development (especially Quinn, who is the title character's sister, and in the last season Stacy). Furthermore, they usually had their own subplots instead of being antagonists; instead of bullying less popular students, they tended to focus on each other.
-   The Glamazons in _Detentionaire_, led by Alpha Bitch Kimmie. Her Beta Bitch, Brandy, actually turns out to not be so bad and a good friend, and even Kimmie gets developed later.
-   _Get Ace_: Tina DeVeer and her two friends, the Single-Minded Twins Emma and Gemma. The twins act like servants to Tina at times and always agree with whatever she says, only rarely showing independent thought, mostly because it's implied they're afraid of upsetting her.
-   Paige Logan from _Grossology_ is usually accompanied by a pair of sidegirls. In one episode, she orders them to floss her teeth (to their credit, they refuse).
-   Subverted with The Misfits in _Jem_. Pizzazz is clearly the musical equivalent of the Alpha Bitch and Roxy is the Beta Bitch, but all three of Pizzazz's band mates have characterization beyond being her lackeys.
-   _Kenny the Shark_ has this with the Phoebes, with the blonde Phoebe being the leader.
-   Averted in _Kim Possible_ — there, neither the Alpha Bitch Bonnie nor head cheerleader Kim has any kind of girl posse. Though some fanfics tend to place the cheerleaders Hope<small>◊</small> and Jessica<small>◊</small> as Bonnie's posse.
-   Gender Inverted in _King of the Hill_: When holding the Villain Ball, Dale Gribble acts as the Alpha Bitch leading a clique and even commanding his cronies with a snap of his fingers and a “S’go!” In these scenarios, Bill Dauterive acts as the Beta Bitch who parrots Dale and mirrors his body language, while Boomhauer does little more than stand next to Dale and look handsome.
-   _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_: Mertle has possibly the youngest posse, who take the "parrot her opinions" duty to the extreme - Mertle insults Lilo, they say in unison, "_Ye-e-e-ah._"
-   Portia, Gwen and Penny from _The Mighty B!_.
-   A darker, more sinister than usual example in _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks_ is antagonist trio the Dazzlings; with Adagio Dazzle as the Alpha Bitch, Aria Blaze as the Beta Bitch, and taco loving Sonata Dusk as the Brainless Beauty.
-   _The Owl House_ features a deconstruction: Academic Alpha Bitch Amity Blight has a posse of several other girls, but most prominently Boscha and Skara, and Amity's first appearance sees her being mean to her nerdy, less-skilled ex-best friend Willow. However, the more the audience sees of Amity, the more it becomes clear that her mean attitude is a façade that she genuinely feels bad about, and she doesn't seem particularly enthused about being in the company of her posse. In "Understanding Willow", it's revealed that Amity's high-society parents coerced her to end her sincere friendship with Willow against her will, under threat of making sure that Willow could never attend magic school if Amity didn't, and instead made their daughter become "friends" with Boscha and Skara (whom Amity dislikes because they actually _are_ mean) because they're more "suitable companions" for a Blight. Essentially, Amity only has her girl posse because her parents forced her to, and has to silently endure their company while watching them mistreat people she actually likes and would prefer to be friends with, luckily Luz's influence eventually gives her the courage to ditch them for _**real**_ friends.
    
    **Boscha**: "You just destroyed your social life."
    
    **Amity**: "Na, I think I made it better."
    
-   In _Pixel Pinkie_, Alpha Bitch Suzi has a pair of side girls whose sole function is to attempt to agree with Suzi more than the other.
-   Eve and Tori are the Girl Posse of Beth in the _Polly Pocket_ animated movies. The pre-cutant ones, at least. While they don't have any ill feelings towards Polly and her friends and even question Beth on why she hates Polly, they let her boss them around. To their credit, when Polly's band got to play on a school event despite Beth's efforts to prevent it from happening, they decided to enjoy the show instead of put up with Beth's rants. Too bad it didn't keep them from helping her in subsequent movies.
-   The Ashleys in _Recess_, with Ashley A. (usually) as the Alpha Bitch.
-   Sierra leads one of these in _The Replacements_.
-   _Sabrina: The Animated Series_: Gem is usually accompanied by a group of girls, and likes to yell orders to them.
-   From _Sofia the First_, Amber, Clio, and Hildegard are almost always seen together in school or at hangouts. Clio and Hilde are just as prissy as Amber, and they join her in bullying Sofia. However, they grow to become Lovable Alpha Bitches over the course of the series.
-   The Cheerleaders (including Kimmy) in _Sym-Bionic Titan_. Ilana attempts to join their cheerleading squad, to which they snide at her. She ends up being the one to help them hide when a Mutraddi invades the high school. Kimmy is still mean to Ilana, but her friends point out that Ilana _is_ helping them. After Kimmy hooks up with Octus, some of her posse also gradually acts nicer toward the trio.
-   _Total Drama Island_: Heather's alliance with Lindsay and Beth qualifies as one, although unlike Heather, Lindsay and Beth are very nice girls who largely follow Heather in hopes of making it to the final three. Both of them ultimately leave the alliance at different points after realizing Heather does't really care about them.
-   _Totally Spies!_: Mandy and her two best friends, Dominique and Caitlin. Mandy didn't seem to have any friends outside of them, because whenever she wasn't with either one or both of them, she didn't really hang out with anyone else (Dominique and Caitlin seemed closer to each other than to Mandy). Dominique and Caitlin got written out of the series after the first episode of the fifth season (due to high school graduation), and got replaced by Mandy's cousin, _Mindy_, who's basically just like Mandy, except she's a dark-skinned blonde with a Southern accent.
