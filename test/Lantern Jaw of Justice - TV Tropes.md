It doesn't get more heroic than this, folks.

**Butt-Head:** Huhuh, look at his face!  
**Beavis:** Heh, look at that crack in his chin!  
**Butt-Head:** I think it's a **butt**crack!  
**Beavis:** Well I guess that would make sense, since like, there's just a bunch of diarrhea coming out of his mouth.  
**Butt-Head:** Yeah. Uhuhuhuhuh, it's like when God was passing out buttcracks, this guy got in line twice.

A square jawline. A protuberant chin. A manly cleft. Somewhere along the line (possibly around Superman's time), artists decided that these, more so than anything else, were _the_ defining facial feature of really heroic (or really strong and dumb) characters. Perhaps to an even greater extent than broad shoulders, barreled chest, and absurdly large biceps, the surest sign of a character's strength and manliness lies in his chin.

Parodies of superheroes will take this trope to its illogical extreme, giving heroes jawlines large enough to logically prevent them from _looking down_ — and possibly, a ridiculous "butt chin". Some artistic conventions also render the cleft as a "swirl" on the chin. While the gluteus chinnimus can affect non-heroic, not-so-strong characters, "chin swirl" is generally reserved for only the _manliest_ of manly.

If a character with a jawline like this crops up in an American Western Animation production, there's a really good chance he'll be voiced by Patrick Warburton. Also common in Captain Space, Defender of Earth!.

This has some Truth in Television, as scientists have noted that there is a definite correlation between jaw size and testosterone production (though cleft chins are very much unisex). Plus, exaggerations aside, a well-defined jawline is considered by many to be an attractive trait in a man, which is why this trope is Always Male.

This is mostly a hero trope, but villains occasionally have chins like this.

Sister trope to Manly Facial Hair, where facial hair is a sign of toughness and masculinity. In fact, many men who _don't_ have a strong jawline will grow a beard to conceal it. Compare Beauty Equals Goodness, Top-Heavy Guy. Contrast Villainous Cheekbones and Thin Chin of Sin (where angular faces characterize a bad guy).

## Examples:

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Major Alex Louis Armstrong of has a mighty chin _that has been passed down the ♥♥♥ Armstrong line for GENERATIONS!_ ♥♥♥
    -   Alphonse actually has one built into his armor if you look closely.
    -   Hohenheim also has a pretty big chin, which admittedly is mostly blocked by his beard. On the flip-side, so does Father.
-   Gaav from _Slayers_. He is a Badass Longcoat, he has the Heroic Chin... but he is a villain! Well, he's a villain because he's trying to kill Lina. When Amelia accuses him of being a villain, he's quick to turn the tables and point out Lina is technically a villain, and so is Amelia by association, causing a short Heroic BSoD on Amelia's part.
-   Bonaparte, Leona's _tank_ from _Dominion Tank Police_.
-   Bean Bandit from _Gunsmith Cats_ features a truly massive jaw. It's not just aesthetic though. One might notice that Bandit NEVER leaves any bones left over after a meal. And he eats walnuts with the shells on.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_, famous for being very Rated M for Manly, has no shortage of this trope, especially in Stardust Crusaders. The most prominent example is the part 3 protagonist Jotaro Kujo (and, by extension, his stand Star Platinum), who never loses his heroic chin even as the manga's style and character designs grow more and more androgynous.
-   Argo Gulskii from _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_ is the operator of Neo-Russia’s own Bolt Gundam, and he has a very strong jawline.
-   _Lupin III_:
    -   Inspector Zenigata is drawn with a squarish face, befitting his role as Hero Antagonist.
    -   In the Manga, his opponent, the titular thief, is at times depicted with one of these, as is Goemon. Chalk it up to artistic Early-Installment Weirdness, because they're more commonly depicted with pointed chins.
-   _My Hero Academia:_ All Might, whenever he’s able to use his Quirk, has a western-style heroic jawline.
-   _One Piece:_
    -   Though an antagonist, Bartholomew Kuma is decidedly on the side of "Justice," and appropriately has a very, very manly jawline, as Sanji finds out the hard way when he attempts to kick it and nearly breaks his leg. Of course, it _is_ made of metal...
    -   Meanwhile, Whitebeard has one of the most impressive jawlines ever, and while being a pirate supposedly puts him on the side of more chaotic-minded free spirits opposed to the law, he's definitely one of the most honorable and dedicated characters in the series.
    -   Interestingly enough, Shiryu of the Rain has a massive chin, and while he once served as The Dragon to Magellan in the defense of Impel Down, he eventually joins Blackbeard as his new Dragon after his Ax-Crazy tendencies go a little too far.
-   Inverted in _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_, where the character with the huge cleft chin is the Big Bad, Fae Wong Reed.
-   Goh of _Godannar_ is a rare Super Robot pilot example.
-   Wide Load in _Transformers: Robots in Disguise_, though he isn't as heroic as he thinks he is.
-   Takahata and Gateau from _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, highlighting Asuna's preference for masculinity over boyish charms and androgyny.
-   Kamina from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_.

-   Ivica Tanović from _Eureka Seven AO_, though he's unusually slender for The Big Guy.
-   _Ravages of Time_: Lu Bu has what can only be described as chin buttcheeks.
-   Subverted in _Irresponsible Captain Tylor_. The gung-ho and by-the-book Lt. Yamamoto has a formidable chin, yet his superior officer, a Mildly Military goofball with a chin barely half his size, is the hero of the series.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V_:
    -   Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon has a long, thin-shaped, and pointy chin that is described as the fang of rebellion. Dark Rebellion charges electric power in its chin and pierces or slices the opponent's monster with it, the attack being called _Hangyaku no Lightning Disobey_. The dragon also represents Yuto's will to revolt against Academia, which invaded his homeland.
    -   Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon, the evolved form of Dark Rebellion, has also the same chin and attacks in the same manner, with its attack being called _Shinkon no Disaster Disobey_. The dragon represents Yuto's grief over the "deaths" of his comrades he left behind and his growing hatred of Academia.
    -   Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon, the combined form of Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon and Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon, has even two chin fangs that look edgier than Dark Rebellion's chin. Like Dark Rebellion, Odd-Eyes Rebellion attacks with its double chin fang, but is far more aggressive while doing this, usually cracking the floor or the wall with the chin before hitting the opponent, the attack being called _Hanki no Gekirin Strike Disobey_. Despite its overall brutal appearance and its crazy attack behavior, Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon represents Yuya and Yuto's bond and their wrath against evil.
    -   "House Cricket" Hibiki and "Sia ferox" Riock.
-   Gohzo Kamata in _Hungry Heart: Wild Striker_ is even nicknamed "Sergeant Chin" by Kyosuke due to his very prominent chin, fitting for his role as being The Big Guy as Jyoyo Akanegaoka's main defender. He inherited it from his father.
-   The 24th episode of the _PaRappa the Rapper_ anime features three policemen with prominent chins.

    Arts 

-   The Moai of Easter Island.

    Comic Books 

-   Superman, as stated above, has had one for such a long time that he may well be the Trope Maker. Superman's chin is taken to a ridiculous extreme in Grant Morrison's _All-Star Superman_ artwork, in which the Chin of Steel becomes ludicrously inflated.
-   But, if anything, Batman's is even _more_ dimpled and protuberant. It's certainly more prominent, at any rate, given that it and the lips are all we actually see of his face.
    -   In _Joker_, The Joker rants about this. He demands to know why Batman leaves that tiny window of manly perfection for all the world to see when he tries so hard to cultivate his image as a Terror Hero. Batman's glorious Shut Up, Hannibal! response: "To _mock_ you."
-   Captain Marvel has sported an absolutely enormous and manly chin since his conception, due in part to his being modeled after actor and real-life example Fred MacMurray.
-   _Judge Dredd_: Judge Dredd's suitably heroic chin is the only part of his face ever seen. He inherited his chiseled features from Chief Judge Fargo, his clone father. His mutant relatives in the Cursed Earth have developed even more exaggerated chins after the fall-out.
-   Gladiator from the Marvel Universe, who is a sort of half-Take That! and half-Affectionate Parody of Superman.
-   Side-character Arcadio in _Groo the Wanderer_ had one of these chins, and female characters would occasionally swoon over it.
-   _normalman_:
    -   Captain Everything. As a parody of Superman and Captain Marvel, it's to be expected, but he takes it to new levels as the series progresses and his appearance becomes more exaggerated. The same goes for the even more exaggerated Megaton Man.
    -   And Sergeant Fluffy. Of course, the villainous Ultra-Conservative also has a very strong chin...
-   Even as a gangly teenager, Steve Rogers had a bit of this going on. As Marvel's foremost Cape, Captain America tends to have a strong chin no matter who was drawing him. Lampshaded a little when a new love interest, Bernie Rosenthal, was introduced in the '80s — she had a chin cleft, and the first thing she said to him was that he had one too.
-   Ironically enough, the Green Lanterns tend not to have prominent jaws, Kilowog<small>◊</small> aside.
    -   Silver Age Green Lantern Hal Jordan is another exception — he was supposedly drawn to resemble actor Paul Newman.
    -   Played straight with Hal in the animated series<small>◊</small>.
-   _Preacher_: The Saint of all Killers. His lantern jaw rivals that of Clark Kent's, but there's nothing good about him.
-   From the Swedish comic _Illustrerad Djävulskap_ we have Dr. Alabander Modul. He is also the local Villain Protagonist.
-   The Tick, naturally, has such a heroic chin. Even more heroic a chin is possessed by his ally Paul the Samurai, who actually cites his chin to convince a guard that he is a hero and should be allowed in. The guard accepts this argument.
-   _Suske en Wiske_: Tante Sidonia has a Gag Nose and a huge chin, which make her look unattractive, but she does have a heart of gold.
-   _Jommeke_:
    -   Subverted with Kwak, a villain, who has a long, pointy chin.
    -   Implied with Arabella, a good character, who also has a huge chin.
-   _Agent 327_:
    -   IJzerbroot's chef of the Dutch Intelligence Service has a huge jawline.
    -   Subverted by the villain Boris Kloris has a huge lower jaw, literally bigger than his face.
-   _De Kiekeboes_: Firmin Van De Kasseien, Kiekeboe's corrupt boss, has a brawny chin, symbolizing his arrogance.
-   Discussed in _MAD_'s "Superheroes" special: it has a foreword by Adam West which revolves around nothing but this trope.
-   The titular Hellboy has always been shown with a monstrously thick chin, even when he was young. Given his Made of Iron tendencies, he could probably knock someone out with it.
-   Even as a duck, Dr. Cliff Carlson from Doug Gray’s _The Eye of Mongombo_ sports a very manly chin.
-   While he was generally an Anti-Hero at best in the modern sense due to his truly antiquated sense of morality the Post-Crisis/Pre-Flashpoint version of _Hercules Unbound_ had a huge prominent squared-off jaw and was unquestionably a hero in the Ancient Greek sense.
-   Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias in _Watchmen_, another deliberately archetypal example.
-   Being a superhero parody, just about every male heroic character in _Captain Biceps_ has one. Biceps himself has a lower jaw around three times as wide as his entire _skull_.

    Comic Strips 

-   Dick Tracy _invented_ the heroic chin.
-   _Popeye_: Popeye's chin is colossal and he fights for justice all the time!
-   _Nero_: Subverted with Ricardo, the main antagonist, who has a hook nose and brawny big chin.
-   British comic hero Bananaman, as a parody of the genre, naturally possesses one of these.

    Fanfiction 

-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: In _Interrupted Plotting_, Ami references this trope when thinking of her first horned reaper:
    
    With his large, jutting chin he had - and he would have hated this assessment - looked almost heroic.
    
-   In _Ma Fille_, while it's a point of weakness in his origin series, Joe's oversized jaw indicates his heroism here, via his kindness to others and love of his daughter (and later, his husband and second daughter).

    Films — Animation 

-   Lawyer Brom Bones in the _Legend of Sleepy Hollow_ segment in _The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad_.
-   Kronk from _The Emperor's New Groove_ also has a lantern jaw.
-   _The Incredibles_: Mr. Incredible, as yet another purposefully archetypal superhero. It's considerably more prominent in the prologue of the first movie before he gains weight after a decade and a half without superheroing. Syndrome has one as well, but he's evil.
-   Even the more obscure films out there subscribe to this notion. Superhero-in-training Rod Rescueman from _Twice Upon a Time_ had his career pretty much determined by genetics — he has a barrel chest and a Lantern Jaw Of Justice.
-   Buzz Lightyear in _Toy Story_ (and the defictionalized _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_) has one of these, replete with "chin swirl". Which is actually _there,_ considering that he's an intentionally stylized toy.
-   _The Princess and the Frog_:
    -   Prince Naveen has one to match his cocky personality, though it's less exaggerated than the other examples.
    -   Facilier has one too, though that's probably because he was partly modeled on Captain Hook.
-   Parodied in _Heavy Metal_, most prominently with Captain Sternn, who looks more than a little like Superman. His behavior however, is as far away from heroic as you can possibly get. When we meet him, he's on trial for twelve murders, fourteen armed robberies, twenty-two counts of piracy, eighteen counts of fraud, thirty-seven rapes, and to top it off... one moving violation. And the man he paid to testify on his behalf says he's done _even worse._
-   _How to Train Your Dragon_: Gobber the Belch.
-   _Cars_ featured an automobile version of Jay Leno named Jay Limo, who is a large limousine with an oversized bumper.
-   Gaston from _Beauty and the Beast_ is an inversion: he has a chin to match his brawn and penchant for boasting, but he's the Big Bad of the film. It's even mentioned in his Villain Song (No-one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston!).
-   Brad in _Wreck-It Ralph_ — just a little exaggerated. Particularly noteworthy in the flashback sequence. The title character has one too.
-   Ronin from _Epic (2013)_ has one. Lampshaded by Grub.
-   Dracula in _Hotel Transylvania_.
-   Manolo Sanchez from _The Book of Life_ has one. A given because he's the hero.
-   Mitch from _ParaNorman_
-   Hercules in _Hercules and Xena – The Animated Movie: The Battle for Mount Olympus_.
-   Metro Man from _Megamind_ has one, befitting his status as The Cape and Superman Substitute.
-   Cale Tucker, the protagonist of _Titan A.E._. Played with since he's more of an anti-hero than a straight-up hero.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Possibly the main reason why Aaron Eckhart was cast as Harvey Dent in _The Dark Knight._ A subtle nod to the standard heroic archetype? Or maybe he's just a damn good actor. Possibly both. Nolan _did_ comment on Eckhart's facial features making him look like a movie hero from the '50s, after all.
-   _Batman_ movies: One of the few good things to be said for George Clooney's turn in the cowl is that his lantern jaw fit the physical requirements better than his predecessors.
-   In the heart-warming (?) ending of _Me, Myself & Irene_, it is revealed that Jim Carrey's alternate personality had one of these surgically implanted on him. Everyone is amused.
    
    _"Look here, Daddy; now you can blow your nose and wipe your ass at the same time!"_
    
-   Bruce Campbell, especially in _Evil Dead_. His (hilarious) autobiography is even called _If Chins Could Kill_.
-   Referenced in Fantastic Four (2005). When reflecting on why their relationship failed years prior, Reed tells Sue he always thought she wanted "a stronger man", while using his stretching powers to give himself a Lantern jaw for a few seconds.
-   Parodied in _Bullshot_ (1983) where actor Alan Shearman is constantly thrusting out his jaw whenever his Comedic Hero character appears on the scene. Lampshaded in the trailer: "There was a time when heroes were straight-limbed, lantern-jawed, well-bred, and British!"
-   The comic-book Iron Man was never drawn with chin on his helmet but the movie version from the Mark II armor up has a protruding chin that does make him look more heroic.
-   Johnny in _Starship Troopers_. Seriously, his jawline steals half the scenes in that movie.
-   _Judge Dredd_:
    -   Love him or hate him, but Sly Stallone had the perfect chin for the title role.
    -   Played for Laughs when Fergie encounters an unmasked Dredd on the prison shuttle; he confirms the identification by covering Dredd's face and comparing his chin with the one he remembers.
-   Josh Brolin's character Sergeant O'Mara in _Gangster Squad_ has a jaw of granite and a stare to match.
-   _DC Extended Universe_:
    -   In _Man of Steel_, once he loses the beard, the audience is treated to Superman's very strong jawline. Gen. Swanwick's is even more impressive.
    -   In stark contrast to Michael Keaton and Christian Bale, _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ finally gave us a worthy Batman chin,<small>◊</small> provided by Ben Affleck.
-   David Hyde Pierce, best known as his role as Niles Crane, has a quite prominent cleft chin.
-   While still on the comic book heroes, Joss Whedon explains in his commentary on _The Avengers_ why Chris Evans' jaw<small>◊</small> is the reason that he is a superhero, and Joss is not.
-   Lampshaded in _Unbreakable_. When showing off a piece of comic book art to a prospective client, Elijah Price explains how the square jaw is common to superheroes, while supervillains have more pointed facial features. Later when David Dunn does an anonymous act of heroism, the newspaper the following day shows a sketch artist's rendering of the mysterious rescuer with a jawline to rival Dick Tracy.
-   Eggsy from _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ has a jawline sharp enough to be considered a weapon in its own right.
-   _12 to the Moon_. While the other eleven astronauts pass quickly through the checkpoint to their rocketship, the American captain stops to give us a profile shot of his classic hero looks and impressive chin.
-   _James Bond_: While all of the actors who play Bond have fairly impressive jawlines, George Lazenby's chin is the most exaggerated.
-   In any live-action Spider-Man movie, you never directly see Peter Parker putting on or taking off his mask because the actor always wears a prosthetic jaw with the costume. If they didn't reinforce the jawline, the mask would just hang between the jaw and the neck and look like a cheap Halloween costume. Even cosplayers will wear a prosthesis because the mask just won't look right without it.
-   Colin Firth in _The King's Speech_ has a good solid chin, featured prominently in one minimalist poster featuring a close-cropped shot of his mouth and chin addressing a microphone.

    Literature 

-   _Chrysalis (RinoZ)_: Beyn's first impression of the newcomers to the village of Renewal is that their leader's "shoulders were broad, her arms thick and her jaw could possibly cut bread." Anthony later thinks to himself that her jawline could probably cut _steel_.
    
    Whoever her parents were, they had some serious jaw genes going on.
    
-   _A Court of Thorns and Roses_: Since Tamlin is wearing a mask for much of the first book, Feyre makes mention of how masculine his jawline is.
-   In _Me, by Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente_, a parody of the life of Jesse Ventura, Garrison Keillor makes reference to a part of Navy SEAL training where "a Naval Surgeon gave us cleft chins."
-   In _Tour of the Merrimack_, dim-witted Vice-President Sampson Reed is described as having one so dramatic that his nickname is "The Chin".
-   A rare female example: Eldest Whistler is described as tall, lean, broad-shouldered, and iron-jawed.
-   Commissar Ciaphas Cain's (**HERO OF THE IMPERIUM!**) chin accounts for a good 15%<small>◊</small> of the heroism his posters exude<small>◊</small>.
-   Joked about in _A Memory of Light_, where Mat observes that the Deathwatch Guards have all traded their senses of humor for oversized chins.
-   _Warren the 13th_ notes that his father, Warren the 12th, had a strong jaw. It serves to perpetuate his kindly-but-strong appearance.
-   The capitalist/industrialist heroes in Ayn Rand's novels are often described as having sharp angular features.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Almost Human_: DRN, a detective, who's also known as Dorian, has a prominent one<small>◊</small>.
-   _America Unearthed_: Scott Wolter.
-   Flabber from _Beetleborgs_, who some people think was based on Jay Leno.
-   Helo, who provides both the strongest jaw and strongest morals on _Battlestar Galactica_.
-   _Burn Notice_'s Sam Axe. The guy's played by _Bruce Campbell_. In _Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe_, the Columbian rebels even nickname him "The Chin" in Spanish.
-   _Chuck_: under Pentothal, Chuck tells John Casey, "Your jaw was sculpted by Michelangelo himself."
-   Nick Stokes, _CSI_.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   A Running Gag with the Eleventh Doctor. Apparently, it's the inspiration for the Easter Island Statues.
        
        **The Doctor:** _\[feeling his face after regenerating\]_ Chin... _blimey!_
        
        -   In an introduction to the 3-D Movie of "The Day of the Doctor", the Tenth Doctor can't resist getting in a dig at how Eleven's chin will be enhanced accordingly.
            
            **Tenth Doctor:** Here it comes... get ready to duck.
            
    -   Captain Jack Harkness from his appearances on the show and on _Torchwood_.
-   Seeing as Adam Baldwin plays John Casey, that means Jayne Cobb of _Firefly_ also has a Lantern Jaw Of Justice, although it is partially obscured by his goatee.
-   _The Flash_, who had a lantern jaw that was the only thing that showed when he was in his super suit. In fact, nearly _every_ live-action iteration of the Flash has been played by an actor with a prominent or at least distinctive chin and/or jawline.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Brandon Stark was a heroic character with a jaw like an anvil.
-   McGarrett (Jack Lord) from _Hawaii Five-O_.
-   Christopher Meloni, who plays Elliot Stabler on _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_, nicknamed "The Chin of Justice". (He also has the habit of thrusting said chin towards a suspect while questioning them.) The same goes for Olivia Benson and Alex Cabot.
-   Robbie Rotten (played by square-jawed Stefán Karl Stefánsson) from _LazyTown_ has a really big chin that he's quite proud of, but he's not at all "manly" in other ways... and he's the villain. But you knew that.
-   Both futuristic journalist Edison Carter and his A.I. counterpart _Max Headroom_ have lantern jaws, though given Max's preference for snark and mischief over heroism, the "justice" part usually only applies to Edison.
-   _The Middleman_ has a particularly spectacular one of these, nicely complementing his broad shoulders and washboard abs.
-   _Misfits_ actor Iwan Rheon is a very attractive example of this trope. A pretty pertinent one too, as his character ultimately takes a level in badass and becomes The Hero of the series, despite spending the first two seasons as a put-upon nerd.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_
    -   Dr. Clayton Forrester, villainous Mad Scientist, had a chin cleft and was quite proud of it. He even invented "chinderwear" in one episode. Interestingly, after Clay's departure, Mike and the Bots would mock the male leads of films like _Devil Doll_ and _Time Chasers_ for their chin clefts: "Ugh, his chin-butt is engulfing her!"
    -   Mike himself has a rather large face that has also been commented on by the Bots. He plays more to the dumb aspects of the trope, though.
-   _Spitting Image_: The puppets of Benito Mussolini, Quentin Tarantino, John Cleese, Prince Philip, Bruce Forsyth, Brian Mulroney were all depicted with large chins.
-   Commander James Fitzjames of _The Terror_. While Tobias Menzies sort of has this going on by default, the costumes _really_ emphasize it, which suits Fitzjames' blustering self-appointed hero status.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   Agent Fox Mulder's prominent cheekbones definitely fit the trope.
    -   Sheriff Hartwell from "Bad Blood" counts as well. However, considering that he's a vampire, albeit of the friendly kind, he's a borderline example among this trope and the Villainous Cheekbones.
    -   Agent Doggett, a rugged manly-man type from seasons 8 and 9, has an angular face as well.

    Music 

-   Toshimitsu Deyama, vocalist of X Japan.
-   Freddie Mercury
-   Peter Steele of Type O Negative fame had one, as he looked rather like the Gothic Metal version of Gaston.
-   Satchel, lead guitarist of Steel Panther has an impressive jawline and chin.
-   Eminem's distinctive cleft chin was put to good use when he began to adopt Smug Super imagery as part of his Slim Shady persona, particularly in the music videos for "Without Me" and "Superman".

    Pinball 

-   Unsurprisingly, _Judge Dredd_ features the character's jaw prominently featured all over the cabinet and playfield.
-   _Dr. Dude_. While his chin is not particularly wide, it's _definitely_ prominent.
-   "Elvis" in _Earthshaker!_ has a prominently protruding jawline with cleft chin.
-   Captain B. Zarr of _The Party Zone_ has an impressively large chin, complete with heroic cleft.
-   Dudley Do-Right in _The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends_.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   During the 1950s NWA Texas and Florida Champion ladies champion Mars Bennett was known as "The Girl With The Iron Jaw".
-   Antonio Inoki has a weapons-grade lantern jaw.
-   A running joke that crops up every time Sargent Slaughter appears is a commentator reference to his chin always preceding him. This is more of an Informed Attribute, seeing as his chin is actually pretty normal.
-   The All-Pro Wrestling/WWE's The Great Khali.
-   John Cena always does the right thing, borders on Boring Invincible Hero, and has a chin that borders on cartoonish.<small>◊</small>

    Tabletop Games 

-   Bruce Campbell is such a good example that it's a feature of Ash's character in the _Evil Dead 2_ RPG rulebook.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Space Marines tend to be designed this way...which, given their enhanced skeletons, wouldn't be that surprising.
    -   Orks already have massive underbiting jaws that would shame a Neanderthal, but take it even further via Iron Gobs, a great big piece of curved and jagged metal that gives them an even more impressive jawline. However, due to the Orks being Ax-Crazy Blood Knights, their large bottom jaws are much less heroic.

    Video Games 

-   The titular _Tin Star_. It's even addressed in-game, with Maria saying that "no one with a chin like Tin Star's could be a bad guy!"
-   Captain Falcon of _F-Zero_ and FALCON PUUUUUNCH fame.
-   Captain Henry Fleming of _Code Name: S.T.E.A.M_ sports one of these. Quite fitting for a patriotic war veteran.
-   Captain Qwark of _Ratchet & Clank_—Fake Ultimate Hero, onetime Dragon and onetime Big Bad—has one of these. Ratchet even mentioned it when eulogizing him.
-   _Freddie Hardest_ from the obscure self-titled MSX games had as his only distinguishing feature a chin the size of a pair of melons.
-   Double H from _Beyond Good & Evil_ has one of these. Funnily enough, his original, Dummied Out (still visible in one MDisk) model had an even _more_ dramatic, neck-engulfingly huge chin, but it was replaced with a more "normal" one. Not by<small>◊</small> much though.<small>◊</small>
-   _Disgaea_:
    -   And now we present you your regular mention of _**Captain Gordon, Possessor of Lantern Jaw!**_
    -   The Wood Golem monster type also has an impressive jawline.
-   _Granblue Fantasy_: Tyre is a thoroughly upstanding guy, and his chin is _huge_. This led to Vyrn calling him "Clefty".
-   The title character of the Apple Macintosh game _Power Pete_/_Mighty Mike_ possess a chin nearly the size of the rest of his head
-   All three main characters on the TV show-within-a-game _Republican Space Rangers_ from _Grand Theft Auto IV_.
-   All classes in _Team Fortress 2_ (except Pyro) has one of these, further exaggerated by their underbites — yes, even Bratty Half-Pint Scout has a hatchet chin that can kill. The Soldier class epitomizes this, being a great, big, yelling, murderous chin. THIS MAN'S CHIN WAS SCULPTED BY GOD.<small>◊</small>
-   _World of Warcraft_:
    -   King Varian Wrynn is famous for having one, earning him the moniker "King Varian Chynn"
    -   Neltharion/Deathwing from the upcoming Cataclysm expansion is an inversion — his lower jaw would not be out of place at a construction site, yet he is going to _break the world_ when he shows up. Also, he's a dragon. Slightly justified: Deathwing needs his armor plating because his body is being torn apart. Without his massive chin, his lower jaw would eventually _fall off._
    -   The unnamed human from the opening cinematic for _Mists of Pandaria_ has one as well as a beard.
-   _Warcraft 3_:
    -   The Knight unit has a very large chin. There's no cleft, but there is manly stubble.
    -   Grand Marshal Othmar Garithos has his unit model based on the Knight and combines said unit's large chin with a mustache. He is, however, a subversion - he's fighting for a good cause, which is liberating Lordaeron from the undead Scourge, but he's also a racist Jerkass.
-   _Wolfenstein_: B.J. Blazkowicz has a truly _colossal<small>◊</small>_ lantern jaw.<small>◊</small>
-   _Punch-Out!!_: Super Macho Man sports an impressive jawline, but Glass Joe doesn't. Soda Popinski is only slightly less impressive in this area but still boasts some serious chin cleft. Mister Sandman has one in all his appearances, being the game's token Scary Black Man, and it's a chin of iron, too—he'll take punches to the jaw all day if you let him.
-   Ash in the _Evil Dead_ games.
-   Playable character from _TimeSplitters 2_, Hank Nova is described in his gallery info as having "the squarest jaw the galaxy has ever seen."
-   For a nonhuman counterpart, _Monster Hunter 3 (Tri)_ has the Uragaan, whose chin is its most prominent feature. The chin can even be broken, but don't expect it to go quickly.
-   _Parappa The Rapper_: Joe Chin is never an outright hero — or an outright villain, for that matter — but he is _definitely_ aptly named.
-   _Samurai Warriors_ gives us the astounding and noble badass Honda Tadakatsu, whose in-game model gives him quite a square jaw to go with his powerful physique.
-   _Sengoku Basara_, of course, gives Tadakatsu a chin so pronounced _it gets its own armor covering._
-   _Full Throttle_, **Full Stop.** You can see that chin from the tiny, tiny page art.
-   _The Lost Vikings_: Baleog the Fierce, being the offense class out of the trio, has a particularly large chin.
-   _Warriors of Might and Magic_: In cutscenes, Alleron is shown to have a huge chin.
-   Duke Nukem is a parody of the generic musclebound action hero. Which means he, of course, sports a Lantern Jaw Of Justice in addition to his trademark Balls of Steel.

-   _Fire Emblem Fates_ has Arthur, whose square jaw goes hand-in-hand with his pursuit of _justice_!
-   _Metal Slug_'s Marco Rossi and Tarma Roving have pretty impressive chins.
-   Guts Man, both in _Mega Man (Classic)_ and _Mega Man Battle Network_, quite literally has the squarest chin in existence. It's so square as to be perfectly rectangular and often looks like a box attached to the bottom of his face, giving him an enormous underbite. Whether he's actually _heroic_ or not depends largely on the universe and circumstances, but there are at least two instances of Guts Man being on Mega Man's side.
-   Guard-Captain Aveline of _Dragon Age II_ is a rare female example.
    -   Hawke's younger brother, Carver is another example. There are several jokes about his chin, mostly from Isabela.
-   Virtually any game that allows customization of the player character's face can prompt this. Some can take it to absolutely preposterous if not deeply unsettling levels.
-   Captain Walker of _Spec Ops: The Line_ - a grizzled veteran with a prominent square jaw and heroic Perma-Stubble - enters Dubai to try to save as many people as possible after the world left it for dead, though it's inverted when he begins committing atrocities left and right for "justice" and vengeance as he breaks down.
-   In _Five Nights at Freddy's 3_, we're shown that the\]\] Murderer has a cleft chin. In fact, it's the _only_ thing that's identifiable about him inside the Spring-Bonnie suit. Very obviously an inversion.
-   _Blasto_ is a third-person shooter on the PS1 starring the late Phil Hartman. It stars the eponymous Captain Blasto, a Top-Heavy Guy, Casanova Wannabe, Idiot Hero, and overall dim bulb (imagine Johnny Bravo with a laser gun and you're most of the way there). He has a jaw that can easily be described as mostly neck, but it's actually so huge that when his mouth is closed, his chin qualifies as half of his face.
-   Very noticeable on the Xbox port of _Serious Sam_ and any version of Serious Sam 2, both of which have a more cartoony art style than the rest of the series. His chin's size and squareness toned down in the more realistic games in the series, though it could still qualify as a more grounded example.
-   _Army Men_: Sarge. As ever, lampshaded in the Play Station versions' cutscenes.
    
    **Plastro:** Well, well, well, if it isn't Sergeant Hawk. How very nice of you and your jaw to join us.
    
-   Every playable character in _Broforce_. Even the women.
-   _Power Pete_: The heroic titular character sports one.
-   The Detective of _Disco Elysium_ has a prominent chin with a cleft. It is extra notable as being the only remaining vestige of his once rugged-good looks back from his youth, that his years-long alcohol and substance abuse haven't been able to wear away. Perhaps deconstructed: while not visible in the game itself <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , his jaw's prominence is due to it having slight paralysis and lopsidedness as a complication from childhood polio, and it sometimes causes him to slur his speech. According to some characters, the Detective made a bit of a joke about it and used to call it his 'law-jaw'.
-   This is _Deep Rock Galactic_'s take on what dwarves have underneath all those bushy beards: square, steely, and very prominent chins that usually have a friend or two. Especially prominent with the default Driller, since his armor's cut below the chin and his headgear ends at nose level.
-   _Doom_ has the Doomguy, whose sprite portrait reveals his huge, square chin (apparently a family trait, as John Romero and Tom Hall indicate he's a direct descendant of _Wolfenstein_'s B.J. Blazkowicz). This also goes for his appearance as the Doom Slayer in _Doom (2016)_ and _Doom Eternal_.
-   _Gotham Knights (2022)_. Renee Montoya visits the memorial statue for the late Commissioner Jim Gordon and complains that they've given him a straight jawline that he never had in real life. After she leaves, a bemused Batgirl comments that her father seems just as she remembers him.

    Webcomics 

-   Prince Ossomer of _Erfworld_ has one by necessity since his appearance is a Shout-Out to Superman. His brother Ansom has a less pronounced (but still pretty manly) chin. Their brother Tramennis has the cleft, but his chin is quite narrow, so it's not as noticeable. Their father King Slately probably has one as well, underneath that King-of-Hearts beard.
-   Mimic in _Rusty and Co._
-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    -   One character takes a missile in his chin, and when it's rebuilt he has one of these. Legs remarks that it looks heroic like it belongs in a comic book... and then the narrator insists that, for the sake of the Fourth Wall, the chin has to go.
    -   Surgical reconstruction and Fourth Wall damage aside, there's a ton of lantern-jawed heroes in the comic: Kaff, Nick, Shep, Andy, Hob, Brad (after bulking up), Pranger, Doyt Gyo/Doythaban, hell, even _Kerchak_ has the gorilla version...
-   _Tweep_ brings us Captain Stone from the Show Within a Comic _Space Force_.
-   Art from _Sequential Art_ is drawn with about half his face being square jaw and chin. He had also saved the planet a minimum of 3 times. The trope is played with here because he's just a graphic artist, and is often dragged into these situations against his will; he's pretty much Resigned to the Call because it's either the only way he can survive when these problems pop up or one of his friends gets involved and he has to go and help. He would call the police, but he knows they would never believe the story (he gets involved in some weird shit).

    Web Original 

-   In the web-novel _Domina_, occasional mention is made of Derek's "strong chin."
-   In _Worm_, this is one of Brian's more prominent features — although, entertainingly, he is actually the super_villain_ Grue.
-   _Whateley Universe_: This is common, going along with the Heroic Build of many Exemplars. An extreme example is 'Captain' Bravo, who has this to a laughable degree. As said in VAMP:
    
    The guy was tall, with broad shoulders, a barrel chest and powerful arms, and a long handsome face with a powerful chin. Yet for all that, he was frickin’ ridiculous. He was like a live–action version of a cartoon parody of the ‘All–American Hero’, with a chest that was too large for his frame, bulging arms that would have been impressive on a man six inches taller and a hundred pounds heavier, and his CHIN! It must have taken up at least a quarter of his face!
    
-   _Welcome to Night Vale_: Carlos is continuously described by Cecil as having, among other attractive qualities, a "strong, square jaw". He is also kind, brilliant, and uncommonly brave if a bit awkward and anti-social. Since it's supposed to be a community radio broadcast, we never actually get visual confirmation, although the fans are more than content to reinforce this.
-   In the _Video Games Awesome!_ LP of _Dragon Age: Origins_, Becky and Fraser end up making a female dwarf noble with a ridiculously large and square jaw who they name 'Chinderella'.

    Western Animation 

-   _My Little Pony 'n Friends_: In "Through the Door", Prince Charming, Paul Bunyan, and Hercules all sport tremendous, block-shaped, and visibly cleft chins.
-   Popeye: His jawline is very huge and he fights for justice all the time.
-   Parody: Captain Kremmen of the Space Corps (animated shorts) from _The Kenny Everett Video Show._
-   The Crimson Chin, from _The Fairly OddParents_, takes this trope to ridiculous new heights. Just look at the picture. Seriously — the man has _chin-based superpowers._ And on top of that, he's voiced by Jay Leno!
-   _Drawn Together's_ Captain Hero, another superhero parody, also sports one.
-   Buck Tuddrussel from _Time Squad,_ who is both super-heroic and super-dumb.
-   The Tick, people!
-   Pretty much all the guys in the DC Animated Universe have these, except the Flash. They're not pronounced, but they're there. Thank Bruce Timm's drawing style for this.
    -   In _Batman: The Animated Series_, a (momentarily) reformed Harley Quinn encounters Bruce Wayne in a clothing store and recognizes him by his chin...
-   From _The Super 6_, only five of them (Super Scuba, Magneto Man, Granite Man, Elevator Man and Captain Zammo) sport Lantern Jaws of Justice. The only one who doesn't is the scrawny Super Bwoing.
-   Every (male) Cybertronian in _Transformers: Animated_ has a _giant_ chin, even Shockwave, who _doesn't have a face_. Sentinel Prime is probably the most prominent example. He was an Expy of The Tick, modeled after Townsend Coleman was cast as his voice actor. Lead character designer Derrick J. Wyatt lampshaded this on one of his blog-posts (titled "Chin On!") where he assured us the characters in season three will have no lack of chins:
-   Samurai Jack started out with a prominent chin...that grew bigger and bigger as the show progressed. Eventually, it took up exactly half the length of his entire face.
-   The Hacker from _Cyberchase_ had a huge chin for no good reason. Inverted in that he is a villain character (but not a very good one).
-   "The Big Story": The gag in this short cartoon is that all three characters, workers at a newspaper, look like Kirk Douglas. Kirk Douglas's lantern jaw, with the prominent dimple, was his most distinguishing feature. Naturally all the Douglases have lantern jaws, and the young reporter and the editor bump jaws when glaring at each other.
-   Commander Feral of _SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron_ has the lantern jaw as well, though he is not the primary heroic figure on the show.
-   _Dexter's Laboratory_: Major Glory of _The Justice Friends_ clearly invokes this in his DCAU-style design.
-   "Simon Belmont" from _Captain N: The Game Master_.
-   Jay Ward gave archetype hero characters _Dudley Do-Right_ and _George of the Jungle_ prominent chins — while making them dumb as fenceposts.
-   _Family Guy_: Joe plays it pretty straight.
-   Stan Smith from _American Dad!_ is perhaps the most ridiculous, exaggerated example in all of Western Animation.
-   Aquaman has an OUTRAGEOUS one in _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_. In fact, most of the characters in the show have one. Including the women. It's kind of weird.
-   _The Batman_:
    -   Fan outcry at Batman being drawn with a pointed chin was so great that it was squared off starting in the fourth season.
    -   Superman has one, and Martian Manhunter has a huge one<small>◊</small> as part of being a Rubber-Forehead Alien.
-   _Space Ghost Coast to Coast_: Space Ghost once advised Mike Judge that he should draw Beavis and Butt-Head with "large, lantern-like jaws... like mine!"
-   Launchpad McQuack of _DuckTales (1987)_ and _Darkwing Duck_ has a lantern _bill_ of justice. Also, Recurring Character Comet Guy. It's subverted with "Major Courage" — He has a heroic beak, but he's really a Dirty Coward.
-   Subverted with Major Man in _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_. He has the jaw right, but he's a big phony.
-   _The Ren & Stimpy Show_: POWDERRRED TOOOOOAST MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
-   Perry the Platypus of _Phineas and Ferb_ also has a lantern _bill_ of justice.
-   Jim Gordon in _Batman: The Animated Series_, but not quite so much as Batman himself.
-   Freddie in _Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated_ — he's not a superhero, but the chin fits the bill.
-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_: Eustace Bagge, even though he's a complete jerkface.
-   In _Voltron Force_, it's Hunk's _lion_ that has this. Recall that the lion is a _robot_. This is part of an overall trend of the lions looking more individual, rather than Palette Swaps of each other.
-   Harvey from _Thomas & Friends_.
-   Frosty superhero Man Arctica from _Fanboy and Chum Chum_.
-   _Ben 10: Omniverse_'s design of Alien X feature this. So does Paradox. So do the Galvan (especially when they are fat), despite their species being clearly portrayed as lacking a chin in the previous installments. And Kevin's chin, who was already tall in _Alien Force_, is even more prominent now. In fact, so many examples can be listed that somebody made a meme about it.<small>◊</small> Then again, Derrick J. Wyatt of the aforementioned _Transformers Animated_ is the art director.
-   _Wakfu_:
    -   Very fittingly, the Justice Knight, another parody of superhero, sports a square jaw.
    -   The Mmmmmmmmmporpg has a monumental chin. He's more of an antagonist, but he's certainly manly (if you disregard his girly true name).
-   In the _Duck Dodgers_ episode "Pig of Action", the Eager Young Space Cadet (Porky Pig) is turned into a muscle-bound action hero by Green Rocks, with an exaggerated "butt cheeks" chin.
-   _The Mighty Hercules_ basically played Herc as an ancient Superman and gave him this treatment. It's every bit as bad as it sounds, and only worth mentioning because it's so hilariously bad that it's absolutely _wonderful_.
-   Alfred Pennyworth sports one in _Beware the Batman_, to go along with his stronger, street-tough characterization.
-   The title monster from _Godzilla: The Series_ has a _very_ prominent chin. Which is odd, considering he's a giant lizard monster.
-   The title character of _Uncle Grandpa_ has one.
-   It's hard to call him a hero in the traditional sense (maybe a schmuck protagonist at best), but Johnny Bravo has one, and he at least _tries_ to do right. Sometimes. Even if he mostly spends his time being a Casanova Wannabe.
-   Captain Atomic from _Atomic Puppet_ had one. Even as a sock puppet, he still has a little bit of it.
-   _The Venture Bros._:
    -   Brock Sampson has a chin befitting his reputation as a "Swedish murder machine" (and yes, he's voiced by Patrick Warburton).
    -   Shore Leave ("with a body like Arnold and a Denzel face") has a very impressive cleft chin.

-   Rubble of _PAW Patrol_, being a bulldog, has a large jaw, and is a heroic puppy.
