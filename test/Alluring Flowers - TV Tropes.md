All across the meadows, many poppies blossomed, and that were so hypnotic and brilliant in color they nearly dazzled Dorothy's eyes. "Aren't they beautiful?" the girl asked her companions, as she breathed in the spicy scent of the big, bright flowers.

Flowers are often seen as beautiful and attractive things, and have a lot of cultural baggage in this regard. This is typically borne from a simple sense of aesthetic appreciation, but in certain cases, this will be described in terms of a literally supernatural allure. Fictional flowers, rather than simply looking and smelling nice, are the sirens of the vegetable kingdom, exerting powerful and potentially dangerous mental influences on other beings.

Usually, this manifests through flowers being given entrancing or hypnotic scents. These plants may possess outright narcotic, intoxicating, or otherwise drug-like effects, which will be experienced by those who consume their flowers or nectar or even simply smell them. Simply catching a whiff of their scent may be enough to put the unwary in a catatonic state or to set them on a dazed, single-minded search for the source of the smell.

These flowers are very often linked to sexuality in some manner, something ultimately derived from how real flowers mimic insects in order to get them to "mate" with them to spread their pollen. In some cases, the plants, especially if animate or humanoid, will exert an almost sexual attraction on humanoid or otherwise animal targets. In others, they may instead serve as aphrodisiacs when consumed or just be associated with beauty and sexuality in a more abstract manner.

These flowers often turn out to be outright carnivorous. In these cases, their attempts to attract animal life don't occur to favor pollination, but serve as a way to lure prey and render it dazed and insensate for the plant's consumption. Here, the flowers may end up being conflated with the elaborate traps of real carnivorous plants.

Finally, these plants are almost always exotic things; it's quite rare for a common garden posy to possess such supernatural allure. They will typically be found in distant and wild locations, usually fertile, tropical, and trackless; equatorial jungles and swamps are common locations for these things, as are more openly alien settings. Physically, these plants also tend to take after tropical flowers in appearance, with bright colors, large blooms, and waxy petals. Tropical orchids are a common base model and often serve directly in this capacity, a trend that was particularly common in literature written during and after the orchid manias of the 1800s.

Since she's a scientist, however, she's able to upgrade her abilities or develop new pheromones that compel a person regardless of sexual orientation or target.

    Literature

-   "The Flowering Of The Strange Orchid", by H. G. Wells, describes a reclusive orchid collector who acquires an exotic orchid bulb that grows into an orchid of a species unknown to science. When it eventually blooms, the flower produces a powerful sweet odor that overpowers every other scent in the greenhouse.

-   _The Pollinators Of Eden_: A group of extrasolar explorers comes across a planet populated by sapient flowering plants that produce a perfume so enthralling that the team's botanist opines that, were it released on Earth, it would devastate its ecology in months. The plants ultimately seduce members of the crew into mating with them to serve as pollinators, in a manner compared to how Earth plants trick insects into "mating" with their flowers to spread their pollen.
-   The short story "Rappaccini's Daughter" has a man who finds himself living next to a beautiful garden tended by a beautiful young woman. No matter how many times he's told not to go into the garden or deal with the young woman, he cannot take his mind off either.

This often proves fatal, as the tree drains Essence from creatures that drink its nectar in order to fuel the production of its own demonic offspring and is entirely capable of draining its entranced victims to death.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   Alraunes are carnivorous, intelligent plants resembling large, ambulatory flowers.

-   Plants that depend on insects for pollination often have flowers with patterns that are much more visible in UV light to make them easier to spot by insects that can see in the UV spectrum (such as bees). Others have evolved parts that look like the female of an insect species, causing males to attempt to mate with it and coating themselves with pollen in the process.
