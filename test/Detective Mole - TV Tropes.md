Among the various cops, forensics people, etc., working on a crime scene in fiction, there's a good chance that one person on the team will know a _lot_ more about what happened than everyone else present... because they _committed_ it.

In real criminal investigations, it's not uncommon for the offender to somehow attempt to insert himself/herself into the investigation to keep tabs on it, or for ego's sake. In this trope, it happens that the offender is actually an official part of the investigation, and is quite probably cheerfully leading Detective Patsy astray as much as possible.

This applies to any crime. The defining characteristic is that one of the investigators is in fact the perpetrator, whether the audience knows it or not. Compare Bruce Wayne Held Hostage, Hired to Hunt Yourself. When the Detective Mole is very high-ranking, see Mole in Charge.

No connection whatsoever to Hanna-Barbera cartoon star Morocco Mole, who is an assistant detective who happens to _be_ a mole.

This was explicitly banned in Ronald Knox's "Ten Commandments" of the Fair-Play Whodunnit story, although some authors viewed the prohibition as only applying to the main investigator and still wrote stories unmasking a secondary member of the investigating team as the criminal.

-   _24: Live Another Day_: Ken, a Detective Inspector with the London Metropolitan Police. He is on the CIA's payroll, providing them with classified police information that pertains to their activities and investigations.
-   Happens several times on _Babylon 5_, due partially to the fact that the eponymous station is where folks go (at least earlier in the show) when they get Reassigned to Antarctica.

The most notable example, however, would be Garibaldi's assistant Jack, in the first season.

-   In _Bäckström (2020)_, Bäckström is offered money by the Russians to feed them info, or else be killed. He breaks down and, begging for his life, literally grovels at Boris' feet, before pulling out a gun and making short work of them... and then takes the money for himself anyway.

    -   In "Working Girls," Danny and Jackie are assigned to protect a witness scheduled to testify against a Russian mobster who killed an associate's wife, due to Erin's previous star witness (said associate) being killed off by the mobster's henchmen. They hide her in a hotel room, but the room is compromised when Danny realizes that the repairman sent to fix a broken air conditioner is actually a hitman. Danny realizes that there's a leak from the task force. He has Jackie stash the witness at her apartment, while he goes over the files of everyone on the task force to look for the mole. With nothing turning up, he and Gormley leak a false address out to the task force, hoping that the mole will react accordingly. Sure enough, he sends two hitmen to the address, and break into an empty apartment occupied by an ESU team. The hitmen quickly give up the mole who fed them the information.
    -   Subverted in "Above and Beyond". Steve Tomlin, an undercover detective, is killed after the drug kingpin he's investigating finds out his true identity. When Gormley and Danny go to empty Tomlin's locker, they find it's been emptied and it's suspected that the dealer may have a mole. Turns out there isn't a mole, and Tomlin's locker was emptied early at his request because it was going to be discovered that he was cheating on his wife with another woman, with whom he'd fathered a kid. And it was his wife who accidentally blew his cover, calling a guy in the dealer's crew mistaking him for Tomlin's mistress.
-   Michael in _Burn Notice_ does this often when he gets hired by the bad guy to find out who is after him (more often than not being Michael himself). One notable one is when he is hired to be a Spy Hunter and pretty much has a blast suitably suggesting it could be him to the mark.
-   In one episode of _The Closer_, a man who killed two of his girlfriends in the late '90s (but was never convicted because the bodies weren't found) is murdered. The man who lead the first investigation, a Detective Olin who has since retired, is asked to come in and help them with the new murder, because of his insight into the original case and his close relationship with the families of the victims.

The series finale virtually confirms it, pointing to Annie.

    -   In fact he was called in when someone mistakenly tried to copy Dexter and ended up in several trash bags. Actually looking over his own crime scenes happens a lot.
    -   Oh yeah, and then there's the _entire second season_, which Miami Metro PD and the FBI spent looking for the Bay Harbor Butcher and Dexter spent evading them.
-   _The Doctor Blake Mysteries_: In "The Visible World", the murderer is Inspector Llewellyn Sullivan of Special Branch. He claims to have come to Ballarat to supervise the investigation because of the political sensitivities surrounding the case.

It turns out that the other detective set him up for a chance to get at his own victim (It's Personal), who lives near where the investigation is taking place. Foyle's efforts to clear his own name and get back to work conveniently lead to a "Eureka!" Moment about the other detective.
-   _Furuhata Ninzaburo_:
    -   Furuhata makes his superior in "The Final Greeting" believe he is this. In fact, Furuhata knew he was the killer from the beginning.
    -   The terrorists in "The Most Dangerous Game" pretend to be detectives trying to catch the terrorists.
    -   The bomber in "Red or Blue" is an electronics student who gets coincidentally pressed into replacing an injured bomb investigator. Unlike the previous examples, this wasn't part of his plan and actually interferes with it, since being in investigation headquarters keeps him from making further threatening phone calls as he'd promised he would, putting Furuhata on is trail.
-   In _Granite Flats_, CIA agent Jim takes over Project Madman under the pretense he's looking for KGB moles. Guess who was the mole?

-   FBI agent Robert Hanssen, who sent enormous amounts of intelligence to the Soviet Union and later Russian Federation during a career as a spy that lasted over twenty years, was at one time head of a task force charged with ferreting out the suspected mole in the FBI—himself. The film _Breach_ is based on this story.
-   FBI agent John Connolly was involved in helping mobster James J. "Whitey" Bulger get away with his crimes for as long as he did. Colin Sullivan in _The Departed_ was loosely based on him, while Frank Costello from the same movie is based on Bulger. _Black Mass_ is a more direct treatment of Connolly and Bulger's partnership. Connolly is currently in a Massachusetts prison for a 40-year sentence after serving a 10-year sentence in federal prison. It was partially thanks to him that Bulger was able to escape as a fugitive for as long as he did.
-   Kim Philby was head of the counter-espionage section MI6 for two years, while all the time he was a spy for the Soviet Union, and thus charged with stopping himself before he defected.
    -   Philby and his colleagues blew the cover of several British intelligence officers, one of whom would go on to write spy novels under the name John le Carré. _Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy_ is a fictionalized version of the whole affair.
-   CIA agent Aldrich Ames was tasked with attempting to make contacts with Soviet double agents, then later assigned to the counterintelligence section, searching for Soviet moles. Instead, he became a double agent for the Soviets (not for ideology, but because he "wanted a nicer car"), passing along information on American-controlled double agents, many of whom were subsequently executed. Not only that, but he blew the cover of a high-ranking KGB agent, Oleg Gordievsky, who was secretly working for the British, who barely managed to escape across the Finnish border in the trunk of a car, and who still lives in hiding under an assumed name.
-   Dennis Rader, the B.T.K. Killer, took a job for the security firm ADT Security Services shortly after beginning his series of murders. Part of his job was installing home alarms, and they were sometimes touted as helping protect people from B.T.K. He once reported one of his own murders to the police from a phone box just a few blocks from his offices. In addition, during this time he was studying for a degree in Criminal Justice- he wanted a thorough knowledge of law enforcement procedure.
-   In 1978-1979 in France, a series of various felonies (five assaults, one murder, car thefts...) in the same region was eventually attributed to Alain Lamare, a gendarme who was part of the persons who investigated this crime spree. Lamare was diagnosed schizophrenic and declared non-responsible, so he was never tried.
-   Non-fiction essay _Jack L'Eventreur démasqué_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  by French writer Sophie Herfort postulates Jack the Ripper was Melville Macnaghten, one of the Scotland Yard investigators who worked on the cases. Among other clues, Herfort points out Macnaghten's hatred of prostitutes, his own skills in taxidermy (_i.e._ Macnaghten actually had the skills needed to disembowel the victims), and his conflicted relation with police chief Charles Warren, the latter clue being his direct motive. According to this theory, Macnaghten's series of gruesome crimes was supposed to raise a ruckus to harm Warren's career, and indeed the murder series stopped once Warren resigned.
