Of course, seeing how the three of them are proud Card Carrying Villains, don't expect this to last. (They are even still wearing their Domino Masks, for Pete's sake!)

_"The game ain't in me no more._ NONE _of it."_

Once upon a time that guy lived on the wrong side of the law. Whether a thief, a highway robber, or other outlaw, he had a Heel–Face Turn and through various circumstances, decided to reform his ways. Or perhaps he was a Justified Criminal and didn't even need to have a Heel–Face Turn, only a chance to be accepted. Now he puts his experience as a former criminal to the service of the law.

Compare Recruiting the Criminal, when the character works for the law while still remaining a criminal, and Boxed Crook, when he's coerced or blackmailed into cooperating with the law. It may even become The Atoner in some cases. Compare and contrast Retired Outlaw, who may never have reformed and may have simply stopped. Falsely Reformed Villain is a subversion, when they pretend to reform but are just using it as a ruse to commit more crimes. If the reformation is on a societal level, then it is a Heel–Face Town.

-   Gauche Adlai from _Black Clover_ is reformed in the loosest meaning of the word - given that he is still as vulgar, violent, and unpleasant even after being arrested - and only stays out of prison thanks to his status as a Magic Knight.
-   A side chapter of _Fairy Tail_ reveals Bisca Moulin to be one of these. Said chapter reveals that the person in question had pretended to be part of the eponymous guild while committing crimes, which drew Erza's attention, resulting in her beating some sense into Bisca.

    -   In fact, it emerged in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ that Hayate still sometimes gets flak from being at the heart of the incident, despite it having taken place a decade in the past. She works as hard as she does in a bid to shake off the stigma.

Post Flashpoint he's been hovering somewhere near anti-hero, and his past of trying to murder his little brothers because he was pissed at their dad is apparently still cannon.

While he's gone completely straight, Arrio makes comments alluding to his checkered past, such as his history of being in car chases and "only" giving Rick a black eye when they fight. But Arrio hasn't lost all of his old habits, as he cheerfully steals Nathan's car when given the chance.
-   Serena Linnen from _Tower of God_ used to be a thief until her group got her annihilated by a Ranker. Full of despair, she sought to improve herself and thus landed in the Inner Tower.

-   _Dino Attack RPG_ has this role filled by Silencia Venemosa, previously a ruthless bounty hunter before she began trying to redeem herself and became involved with the Dino Attack Team. Montoya could also be considered an example due to his background as a small-time criminal, though he never actually joined the team.
-   _Fire Emblem on Forums_ has a few examples:
    -   _Liberation Of Izzarra_: Roux, Bertholt's bodyguard, is this, having reformed after Bertholt successfully healed her mother when she ransomed him to try to get money to do the same thing. However, she is very much Reformed, but Not Tamed.
    -   _Whereabouts of Drink and Coin_: Lastelle, L of the Warriors, used to be a petty thief for the thrill before finding gainful employment as a Warrior when the Boss noticed her skills.
-   _No Boys Dorm_ has this in the main character Lara No, who moved away from Toronto to escape her criminal past but returns when her apartment burns down, and her best friend Alba Armada. Additionally, Cyrus, a member of the Shadow Order, seems to be reconsidering his job choice.
-   Blake Belladonna from _RWBY_ was an operative of the White Fang in the backstory; she defected from the group in her introductory trailer upon becoming disillusioned about its ways and soon enrolled in the Beacon Academy to become a huntress.

-   _Ben 10_/_Ben 10: Alien Force_: Kevin Levin, once a troubled (but still deadly) kid turned arms dealer, is convinced as a teenager to fight for good after a Plumber (meaning a member of the secret alien police) saves his life at the cost of his own.

    -   Viper, the cat burglar that Jackie and Jade encounter during their search for the snake talisman, turns up as an ally in season 2, having reformed her criminal ways and now working as a security consultant.
    -   The Dark Hand Enforcers, Finn, Ratso, and Chow, decided to go straight in the Season 4 episode, "The Good Guys." It didn't stick, though in several appearances afterwards the three were seen trying to reform themselves, sometimes as part of a scheme, though sometimes with genuine aspirations to leave a life of crime behind.
-   Rubberband Man began as an adversary of Static in _Static Shock_, but he eventually turned himself in to the authorities. When he was released from prison he became an ally to Static.
-   Parodied in the _SpongeBob SquarePants_ episode "Hall Monitor", where Hall Monitor SpongeBob tries arresting Patrick for the sole offense of littering ice cream.

-   Terry in _Batman Beyond_ was, by his own admission, a real bad kid and even ended up in Juvie for a while before he became the new Batman. The tricks he didn't get from Bruce he picked up in the course of his bad behaviour. Being Batman, as he explains in _Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker_ is his way of trying to undo the damage he did.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   Princess Celestia stresses she wants Discord reformed of his own free will so he will become this and be willing to use his God-Tier powers for good rather than just being a dick. Other than one major snag, it ultimately works.
    -   Starlight Glimmer in season five also follows this route.
    -   In fact, many of the show's villains are reformed after a Heel–Face Turn and being Easily Forgiven. Nightmare Moon, aka Luna, Sunset Shimmer from The Equestria Girls spinoff, the Changeling race, save for a Queen Chrysalis. Not surprising, as it's a major theme of the show.

    -   Fillmore's former partner in crime, Penny Madrid, had also turned her life around by the time she and Fillmore meet again, now working for Winston Cotter, the son of a Canadian ambassador, and helping him organize charity events.

    -   Linus Santiago used to be a petty thief and was known for disrupting school events and being a thorn in Principal Folsom's side ever since his start at school. After walking out of detention and discovering street magic, he had changed his ways.

    Real Life 

-   A famous Real Life example is Vidocq, a French thief who ended up chief of police, and later became the first private detective ever.
-   Frank Abagnale Jr, both in real life and in the film _Catch Me If You Can_, went from passing millions of dollars worth of fraudulent checks to working as a fraud and security consultant for the FBI. Except none of that was true: further investigation showed that he didn't steal anywhere near the amount that he claimed to, and he never worked for the FBI.
-   Several hackers (convicted and otherwise) have found gainful employment in the computer security field.
-   One former Canadian marijuana smuggler advertised the fact that he'd started up and ran a successful smuggling business before eventually being caught as qualification for why legitimate companies should consider hiring him due to his demonstrated organizational and management skills. It worked, thus neatly avoiding the trap that many former criminals face (a criminal record prevents you from getting a legitimate job).
-   Plenty of pirates fall under this trope.
    -   Zhou Tai, and Gan Ning who are featured in Dynasty Warriors. Both were former pirates before they joined Wu. Although Gan Ning was still a killer deep down.
-   French writer and director José Giovanni was part of a collaborationist French fascist party during the Occupation of France. He took part in the crimes of a gang within that party that killed some Jewish people and embezzled their money. He served 11 years in prison from 1945 to 1956, then was pardoned and started a career in writing. He incidentally wrote crime novels, some of which got famously adapted on film (such as _La Scoumoune_, which he directed himself).
-   Danny Trejo used to be a criminal when he was younger. Nowadays, he's an actor who said that him playing bad guys is meant to show that Being Evil Sucks, and that he's apparently quite nice despite his background.
-   Robert Piché, a Canadian private pilot, was imprisoned for sixteen months for smuggling marijuana into the US from Jamaica. Despite his criminal record, he was hired by the Canadian airline Air Transat - which turned out to be a good thing for 305 passengers and crew when he skilfully glided an Airbus A330 that ran out of fuel on a transatlantic flight to a safe landing in the Azores.
-   Larry Lawton was once the most notorious jewel thief in the United States until he was finally busted. After doing his time, he became an author and motivational speaker dedicated to helping troubled teens steer clear of the life of crime. He's even been made an honorary police officer! He has his own YouTube channel where he shares stories about his former life of crime and reviews heists in fiction.
-   Michael Franzese was a former captain of the Colombo crime family and lived through many of the events covered in Scorsese films; he knew the real Henry Hill and even saved his life on several occasions. Many of the mobsters arrested in Donnie Brasco were his personal acquaintances (in fact, Donnie was originally going to target Michael's family before switching to the Bonannos). The Jimmy Hoffa incident happened during his time and he knows for sure what truly happened, but has declined to divulge any detail. Much like Larry Lawton above, Michael is now a motivational speaker and has his own YouTube channel, which he uses to talk about the Mafia life and reviews mob movies.
-   Huey Morgan of Fun Lovin Criminals was involved in a number of crimes in his youth living in New York, which resulted in him being given the choice of joining the marines (a branch stationed in Paris) or going to prison (as noted in the song "The Grave And The Constant"). He chose the former, and eventually pursued a career in music, for which he had particular success in the UK (to which he later moved). He's now considered something of a national treasure due to working as a presenter on radio and tv for years.
-   Judge Greg Mathis of _Judge Mathis_ used to be a delinquent and a teenage hoodlum, before he turned his life around and became a judge.
    
    "Troubled kids? I was one. Gangs? Jail? I was there. Second chances? I got one. I went to law school, became a lawyer, and then a judge. Now I get to _give_ second chances. It's time for hard decisions and tough love. Justice that makes a difference; _that's_ what I'm about!"
    
-   An episode of _Tiger King_ features Mario Tabraue, the former kingpin of a multimillion dollar drug empire whose exploits are said to have inspired parts of the movie _Scarface (1983)_. After being arrested and serving his time in prison, he was paroled for good behavior and now lives quietly with a private zoo of exotic animals, by all accounts a reformed character. Indeed, compared to the antics of the other zoo owners in _Tiger King_, he comes across as practically the Only Sane Man.
