**Rarity:** Post-apocalyptic donuts. Interesting choice.  
**Twilight Sparkle:** I know. But there's gonna be plenty of time for all the challenges and struggles and adventures to come. For now, I just want to spend a quiet moment with the six best friends I've ever had.

A work ends by showing a light-hearted scene where the hero and his friends grab a bite to eat and have a cold beverage. May or may not include a final conversation to wrap up a few loose ends in the plot, but generally just as often the plot ends right at the invitation or decision.

If it's a guy inviting a girl out to dinner (or vice-versa), it can be used to show that their relationship has progressed beyond Just Friends or "merely professional."

Title is a play on the term "Good End" sometimes found in video games. See also I Was Told There Would Be Cake. Compare Dance Party Ending, where the work ends with a similarly light-hearted scene, but with dancing rather than eating.

**Spoilers ahoy.** Please note this is an **ending** trope.

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _K: Return of Kings_, the series ends with Kuroh, Neko, and Shiro who has returned to his original body and become a teacher in the school, eating around their table in their same dorm room - an echo of the ending of episode 2 of season 1 (when they had all just met), as well as _many_ other moments with that trio. Food is such a symbol for them, they even named their Clan "Hakumaitou" - _hakumai_ means "white rice".
-   The first chapter of _Naruto_ ends with Iruka giving Naruto his headband and thinking that a ninja's life is hard, but he'll tell him over ramen.
-   _One Piece_: Major arcs often end with a large feast. The first few arcs ended in the relatively low-key way that this trope describes — the Straw Hats simply went to a restaurant and had a meal. Since the Arlong arc, all of the good guys (and sometimes even the former villains who are left), which may easily be thousands of characters, get together for a huge, over-the-top party where they eat, drink, dance, shout "PARTY!!!", and generally mess around.
-   _Snow White and Seven Dwarfs_ ends with most of the (surviving) characters gathering together for a group meal, in a Group Picture Ending.

    Comic Books 

-   Just about _every_ Asterix book ends with a Gaulish village banquet.
-   _Empowered_ caps off her epic victory at the end of volume 6 by raiding the Superhomeys' stash of snacks.
-   With the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ love of pizza it is no surprise that several stories end with this.

    Fan Works 

-   The _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Empath And The Golden Magic Bird" ends with the Smurfs eating their annual Harvest Feast meal, which is their version of Thanksgiving.
-   _The Final Sword_ ends with the Citadel throwing a party to celebrate Rebora's coming back to life.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Care Bears: Adventure in Wonderland_ ends with Grumpy embarking on an _epic_ fridge raid, having been denied food for the entire movie. Rap and pickled beets ensue.
-   The last lines of _Kung Fu Panda_ are Po asking Shifu if he wants to go get something to eat. The Stinger has them do precisely that.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   One of the final scenes in the first _American Pie_ film shows Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eating breakfast at their favorite diner (appropriately named "Dog Years") while they discuss the life-changing events of the night before and raise a toast to the future.
-   _Batman_: At the end of _The Dark Knight Rises_, Alfred sees Bruce and Selina dining at the café in Florence.
-   _Big Daddy_ ends with a feast of buffalo chicken wings for most of the movie's characters. There's even a "YEAH!" Shot for the fade-out, with the protagonist's sister-in-law getting caught in the act of greedily reaching for a wing.
-   _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ ends with Willy joining the Bucket family for dinner, and Mrs. Bucket gently scolding him and Charlie for talking about business matters at the table.
-   _Dragonheart: Vengeance_ ends with a feast with lots of food and folks, fulfilling the dragon's earlier-expressed yen for a party.
-   Several of _The Fast and the Furious_ movies, notably _Fast & Furious 6_, _The Fate of the Furious_, and _F9_, end with Dom and his family about to have a large feast.

-   _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_ ends with the two families feasting on a roast turkey — which was blown up to ginormous proportions by Wayne's shrink-ray technology.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   Played with in _Iron Man 2_ when Tony Stark _thinks_ he's spending his last minutes eating donuts.
    -   Towards the end of _Thor_, Asgard holds a feast as their way of mourning Loki's Disney Death.
    -   The post-credits scene of _The Avengers_ has the team eating shawarma in awkward silence. Played With in that it chronologically takes place between the climactic final battle and the events of the closing scenes of the movie proper.
-   _Pineapple Express_ ends with the three heroes eating in a diner while recapping their adventures.

    Literature 

-   The _A to Z Mysteries_ book _The Falcon's Feathers_ ends with an ice cream party for the heroes.
-   Virtually every version of The Brothers Grimm's "Sweet Porridge," a.k.a. "The Magic Porridge Pot" will end with the villagers cleaning up their town by eating all the porridge (or whatever other food the retelling uses) that's swamped it.
-   Seems to be a bit of a tradition in the _Ciaphas Cain_ books (including many of the short stories). The only novel that hasn't used it so far is _Cain's Last Stand_.
    -   In _For the Emperor_, Cain is invited to dinner by Inquisitor Vail, and she tells him Jurgen's secret.
    -   In _The Caves of Ice_, Cain reciprocates and treats Amberley to her favorite and himself to a well-deserved ambull steak.
    -   In _The Traitor's Hand_, Cain invites his Valhallan True Companions to dinner to celebrate their victory.
    -   In _Death or Glory_, after being trapped on an Ork-infested continent with a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits, the second thing Cain asks for upon linking up with the main friendly army (after medical supplies) is tea.
    -   In _Duty Calls_, Cain and Vail share a few glasses of amasec on the flight out of the warzone after reacquiring a stolen artifact and dealing with a genestealer mob.

    -   _Choose Your Enemies_ ends with Cain and Amberley discussing the aftermath of the novel's final battle and the Inquisition's plans to clean up the remaining mess over dinner.
    -   For a short story example, _The Little Things_ wraps up with Amberley calling an interrogation team to deal with her would-be kidnapper, while Cain lays dinner out on the table.
    -   In _The Smallest Detail_, Jurgen helps himself to some of the ration packs being stolen by the black marketers he helped catch before returning to base.
    -   In _A Mug of Recaff_, once Jurgen kills the Chaos cultist hiding in the kitchen while trying to summon a daemon, he finds a kettle and brews a pot of recaff for his boss.
    -   In _Traitor's Gambit_, Cain and Jurgen share a bottle of amasec while they're waiting for someone to pick up their escape pod.
    -   In _Old Soldiers Never Die_, Cain is drinking with a fellow officer while they discuss where they'll be posted next now that their current mission is over.
    -   _Sector 13_ ends with Cain at an award ceremony where the heroes of the hour (which includes him) have all the food and drink they could want.
-   Seems to be Author Appeal for Roald Dahl:
    -   _Danny, the Champion of the World_. Danny and his father have a few pheasants in the freezer, and their life will improve greatly now that they can afford to buy an oven.
    -   _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_: The book ends with Charlie, now heir to the titular chocolate factory, and his family heading there to live in it. Grandma Josephine asks "Will there be anything to eat when we get there?", as the poor family has been in desperate straits all winter, and Charlie replies "Just you wait and see!" (This ending gets an override in the Immediate Sequel, as the trip back is the start of a variety of further adventures.)
    -   The bittersweet ending of _The Witches_ is made sweeter by the fact that the protagonist, now a mouse, has access to Norwegian goat cheeses bigger than he is.
    -   _The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me_. The protagonists, now living on the Duke of Hampshire's estate, are allowed to fish for trout in his personal river, and their old headquarters is converted into a fantastic sweet shop which sells Wonka products.
    -   _The BFG_ no longer has to eat the awful snozzcumbers, and will be given all the bacon and eggs he desires. There's also a peach tree growing in his yard.
    -   _Fantastic Mr. Fox_ ends with a banquet and an assurance that many more banquets are to come, when Mr. Fox's network of tunnels allows him to safely raid all three farms.
    -   _Esio Trot_. Alfie the tortoise is given to a kind little girl who feeds him all the lettuce he could ever want.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ ends with the heroes heading off to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe for a bite.
-   The ending to _How the Grinch Stole Christmas!_ has The Grinch carving the rare roast beast with the Whos. As a side note, most Christmas stories end with a feast.
-   Pretty much _every_ _Redwall_ book ends with the woodlanders heading off to a feast.
-   _Strega Nona_ ends with Big Anthony having to eat all the pasta by himself as punishment for misusing the magic pot.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Blue Bloods_ frequently ends with the Reagan family seated around the dinner table.
-   Happens frequently on _Bones_ — first season a Chinese restaurant run by Heavy D, and after that a local diner or watering hole. In addition, many episodes end with Booth and Bones eating Thai and doing their paperwork.
-   Every once in a while, _CSI_ ends on various members of the team eating in their favorite diner, and the way they interact shows the Character Development they've undergone and the shifts in relationship dynamics.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Battlefield" ends with the retired Brigadier bringing the guest hero, an extradimensional Arthurian knight named Ancelyn, and the Seventh Doctor home to meet the wife—who then drives off with Ace, suggesting the Brig keep himself busy mowing the grass and maybe have supper ready for when they get back. The Brig then turns and asks Ancelyn if he's any good with a lawn mower, and the Doctor grins and says, "I'll cook supper."
    -   At the end of their first adventure off-world, the Ninth Doctor asks Rose Tyler whether she wants to keep traveling with him. As she nearly got killed, Rose hesitates... but then asks if he wants fish and chips. Even though she's delaying her decision, we know then that she's going to stay.
    -   Likewise, when the Doctor regenerates into his Twelfth persona, he worries whether Clara Oswald will stay with him, so at the end of the episode he asks her out for coffee. Or chips. Or something with chips and coffee?
-   The very last episode of _Everybody Loves Raymond_ ends on a low-key note with the very last shot of the Barone family being of them all sharing a meal together; Ray has just conceded the need for a bigger kitchen table. Instead of closing music the credits fade out on the everyday small-talk of an Italian-American family at dinner.
-   The final episode of _Friends_ ends with the titular group (who are separating due to marriage or career choices) deciding to spend their last hours together in the coffee shop where they all met ten years ago. It becomes a Tear Jerker ending when the camera then pans across the (now-empty) apartment that fans have spent the past decade visiting every week.
-   Ditto for _Law & Order_, though it's generally a bar where Team Dad Jack McCoy is feeling sorry for himself again.
-   _Mimpi Metropolitan_:
    -   After Bambang spends most of episode 8 being angry at Alan and Prima, the episode ends with them all making up and Bambang sharing his fried rice.
    -   Episode 30 ends with Bambang, Alan and Prima eating the cake Pipin make for them, a consolation for them losing their job.
    -   In the ending of episode 45, Bambang takes Melani to dinner to cement his apology. Bambang is just happy to see Melani happy; Melani meanwhile feels her heart beats stronger than usual.
-   Many, many episodes of _Quincy, M.E._ ended with Quince and his buddies discussing the case's conclusion at their favorite Italian restaurant.
-   Series 7 of _Seinfeld_ ends with George being told his fiancée Susan has just died, at which point he says to the group, "Let's go get some coffee."

-   The Distant Epilogue of _War and Peace_ shown has Pierre, Natasha, Marya, and Nikolai enjoy a picnic with their households (including Sonya) and children.

    Myths & Religion 

-   The Bible:
    -   In the Gospels, Jesus and his disciples catch fish for breakfast in the final chapter of John's Gospel.
    -   The Book of Revelation ends with access to the Tree of Life, which Adam, Eve, and all humanity were prevented from eating of in the Book of Genesis, granted to those who overcame the world in Jesus Christ.

    Roleplay 

-   Occurs, of all places, in _Survival of the Fittest_. In version four a member of STAR mentions that they'd get Happy Meals for each person who'd escaped. One of the post-game threads show that yes, they did indeed get McDonalds. Given the setting, however, it's more of a Bittersweet Ending at best.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _The Muppet Christmas Carol_ ends with everyone singing around the Cratchit family's table (and in the doorway, and outside the door — Scrooge apparently brought all of London with him), ready to enjoy the prize turkey dinner Scrooge bought for them.

    -   "You Say Potato", revolves around the kids getting ready for a picnic and ends with them having it.

-   In _Cactus Flower_, after Julian finally walks out on Toni, Igor goes into her bathroom to get dressed. She asks him if he's free for dinner together, and he says, "Great. I'll go out and get some Chinese food." She answers by offering to make some chicken cacciatore (which was splattered all over her stove when he first found her), and he emerges from the bathroom smiling. This is the last the audience sees of them.
-   In _The Sorcerer_, the second act, like the first, with Sir Marmaduke hosting a feast, this time without the Love Potion.

    Video Games 

-   _Bad Dudes_ ends with the rescued president offering to take the heroes out for some burgers.
-   In _BlazBlue_ a couple of Tao's endings and Ragna's joke ending have them eating (Ragna's joke ending naturally involves Tao). Parodied in Noel's Gag Reel in _Continuum Shift_, in which her cooking renders everyone in the cast except Terumi unconcious.
-   _Escape From St. Mary's_ begins with a quest for food, shifts to several layers of crazy and then ends with... food.

-   _8-Bit Theater_ has a Food End for the epilogue amongst Red Mage, White Mage, and the Dragoon.

    Web Original 

-   Many of TESSHI-e's escape-the-room games end with the protagonist getting something delicious to eat or drink to celebrate having gotten out of the locked room, either alone or with a friend (often the one who locked them in there in the first place). Overlaps with Food Porn, given the downright gorgeous photos of the meals in question that accompany the text.
-   The fourth Phase novel of the _Whateley Universe_ ends with Phase joining his team for Thanksgiving dinner and thinking how he does really have things to be thankful for.

    Web Videos 

-   _Outside Xbox_: Andy's Sharpie rewrite of _Heart of Darkness_ ends this way.

-   Early _Scooby-Doo_ episodes tended to wrap up at the "Pizza Palace", or some similar place.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Sketches and early episodes often had Homer taking the family out for "frosty chocolate milkshakes". This resulted in a Call-Back in a _much_ later episode when Homer kidnaps some children (it's a long story) after lulling them into complacency by saying they're going out for... you guessed it.
