Sometimes characters are unwilling to listen to the protagonist, or vice versa. They continue on with their previous activities or simply walk away from them. Occasionally the character will say something that strikes a chord within the listener, intentionally or otherwise. This can cause the listener to stop dead in their tracks, as indicative of a sudden appreciation of events or to highlight the shock they feel.

This trope is commonly Played for Drama or horror but can be Played for Laughs too. An Armor-Piercing Question and/or Wham Line can result in a stunned stop, their back turned away from the character, the audience grasping their reaction from their Stunned Silence. Sometimes the camera will focus on their shocked face to really seal the impact. When Played for Horror, rather than dialogue an eery noise may result in this trope. It may also involve a Dramatic Pause and/or Beat before a subsequent reaction.

There can be a variety of reactions following this stop (it'd be pretty awkward if they just stood there). The most common ways are as follows:

1.  They turn back, immediately siding with the protagonists, or at least showing a willingness to listen.
2.  They make no response, instead continuing what they were doing, albeit noticeably slower with an air of awkwardness and/or fear.
3.  They react in overt shock, and demand the speaker to explain themselves.
4.  They look behind them at the striker, brushing them off forcefully, reiterating their previous point, or simply giving them a scathing look.
5.  They make an Armor-Piercing Response that shuts the questioner up.
6.  It induces a state of Tranquil Fury and may or may not result in a fight right there and then.
7.  They mutter a deadly 'what?'
8.  They run away crying.

Truth in Television, as many do in fact stop what they are doing abruptly when faced with some armor-piercing words, contemplating what to do next. Even more common are those who walk away from situations they don't want to face. Consequently, most instances of this trope throughout media follow this general type. The stop must be given prominence to qualify, it can't just be a single frame where the character pauses. It can be a precursor to The Reveal, so **expect mild spoilers**.

The Super-Trope to Armor-Piercing Question and Armor-Piercing Response as the collective natural reaction to these, although they do not have to be. Related to and commonly overlaps with Double Take and Stunned Silence, particularly in the first example, as the impact of the question is left entirely to body language. Can overlap with Symbolic Distance where the stop is used to achieve this. Sister Trope to Battle-Interrupting Shout and A Truce While We Gawk, where two parties in active conflict stop as a result of a "STOP IT!" or a jaw-dropping sight.

The question/statement could be, intentionally or not, a Devastating Remark, which generally triggers the Trauma Button. Might also precede a moment of Tranquil Fury.

Can result in a Dramatic Drop, or if they are driving, braking angrily —sometimes accompanied by a Screeching Stop sound effect. The internal version of a Spit Take. The aftermath of this may include looks of guilt and reconsideration of their actions. Compare Explain, Explain... Oh, Crap!, when a character stops speaking (instead of doing something) about a particular topic when they realize something wrong or alarming. Compare Deer in the Headlights as someone freezing in fear of being attacked.

    Real Life 

-   This trope is so old it's evolutionarily hard-wired into the human system. The fight-or-flight response also includes the 'freeze' element, which causes a person to stop everything they are doing in response to a potentially threatening noise. This was a naturally-selected trait, as was the rest of the response, as it allows us to analyse our environment and potentially avert a conflict, resulting in greater rates of survivability.
