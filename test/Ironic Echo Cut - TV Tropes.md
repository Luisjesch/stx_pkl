**Karen Gillan:** The Doctor bites my arm, and I'm not really sure how we're going to do that. Is he actually going to do it?  
_\[cut to Matt Smith grinning broadly\]_  
**Matt Smith:** _Absolutely!_ I'm going to bite her arm!

Related to the Gilligan Cut and the Description Cut, this is a comic device that brackets a hard cut with two versions of the same line. The first may be straight or even deadly serious, but the repetition ends up being funny:

"Jilly must be freezing her butt off!"  
_\[Hard cut to Jilly in the forest\]_  
**Jilly:** I'm freezing my butt off!

Or, on occasion, there will be a bit more irony present:

**Mayor:** _\[of the preparations of a ceremony\]_ This is the day that will put our town on the map! This is it!  
_\[Cut to much more sinister happenings in some sort of evil science lab\]_  
**Antagonist:** This is it.

Note that when used in anime, this bit usually includes a Sneeze Cut from the referred person, because the Japanese are allergic to being talked about behind their backs.

This is Older Than Steam, being a classic trope of farce for several hundred years now.

Often used in the delivery of Hypocritical Humor. Compare with the plain old Ironic Echo, which comes several scenes later, and Strange Minds Think Alike. Another form of Tempting Fate. Not to be confused with Description Cut. Compare Immediate Self-Contradiction. Contrast Twisted Echo Cut, where the echoing scene is unrelated and the echo is coincidental.

    Advertising 

-   Two commercials for State Farm use this to demonstrate that moments of joy usually have a moment of misfortune to go with them:
    -   In one, a teenage girl discovers that her father bought her a car and talks about it with excitement. Her scenes are intercut with a businessman who's discovered that his own car has been stripped. The scenes with the girl and the the scenes with the businessman have the same dialogue delivered in different tones.
    -   In the other, a pair of women talk about the couch one of them just bought. When that sequence ends, we see a pair of burglars in the same room talking about the same couch which they're about to steal. Their conversation is exactly the same as the women's.
-   One commercial for Smorz cereal is basically a succession of this. One boy has a terrible experience trying to make s'mores at a campfire in the woods while another boy enjoys Smorz cereal in his kitchen. They say the same things, but in different contexts.
-   An anti-smoking PSA uses this for grim effect, cutting between smokers explaining how addicted they are and people suffering from smoking related illnesses (except for the last one):
    
    **Smoker:** I can't go more than two hours without a cigarette.  
    **Emphysema patient:** I can't go more than two steps without my oxygen tank.  
    **Smoker:** The last time I tried to quit, I gained five pounds.  
    **Cancer patient:** I've lost twenty-five pounds.  
    **Smoker:** I can't get out of bed without a cigarette.  
    **Emphysema patient:** I can't get out of bed.  
    **Smoker:** No, I don't think I can quit.  
    **Doctor:** _\[looking at medical scan\]_ I don't think I can operate.

-   _Buso Renkin_: In their attempt to infiltrate Ginsei Academy, Tai and Shi, a pair of large homunculi with limited intelligence, talk about how perfect their disguises are before the scene cut to the students saying how suspicious the two massive guys wearing badly fitting school uniforms are.

    **Aria:** Whoa! Are you satisfied already?

-   From _City of God_:

-   Used straight in _Fright Night (1985)_, when Charlie tries to reveal what's moved in next door. In this case, the humor comes from the tone of voice: his mother's response is perplexed, as if she isn't even certain what a vampire _is_, whereas Amy's is outraged that he'd expect her to swallow such an apparent load of hooey. The possibility that he might actually know what he's talking about doesn't even occur to either.

    **Steve:** I've got to play this one perfectly.
    
-   _The Slipper and the Rose_: The morning after the ball, Cinderella's stepmother and her stepsisters Palatine and Isobella, still in pajamas, are dizzily gushing and bragging about their fabulous time.
    
    **Palatine:** _\[stares dreamily\]_ I wonder what The Prince is doing today?  
    _\[cut to an angry Prince Edward at his castle\]_  
    **Edward:** _I'll_ tell you what The Prince is going to do today...!

-   _Moving Pictures_ has a scene where a cinema owner is imagining what two film stars are doing, unaware that they don't _know_ they're stars, and the male lead is now working as an assistant horse holder.
    
    Prob'ly eating caviar off of golden plates, and lounging around up to their knees in velvet cushions, you bet.  
    \*\*\*  
    "You look up to your knees in it, lad," said the horse holder.
