**Almost everyday I see beautiful** young women carrying big signs that say **"LOVE ME."**  
But below, in smaller print, they say "No. Not _you_."

So there's this one woman. You know the one. The one who Really Gets Around. She'll jump into bed with just about anyone who asks. She… well, she just really likes having the sex. You get the point.

But this woman, who will schtup men, women, and most species of plants, is utterly unobtainable for this one character. That character doesn't have to be The Protagonist, and, in fact, rarely is. Most of the time this is used to demonstrate that the character's sad and pathetic—after all, if Betty Bangs-A-Lot won't kiss him, he must be pretty crummy at this life thing. This is almost always used as a comedy gag, largely because it's too depressing to contemplate under any other circumstances. Think of it as Even Sluts Have Standards.

More rarely, on the other hand, it can be used to demonstrate quite the opposite. Sometimes the reason the promiscuous character refuses to have their usual mindless, consequence-free sexytimes with one target is that just this once, she's holding out for something more meaningful.

Can cross over with Entitled to Have You, when the rejected dude feels that because the woman in question sleeps with "everyone" she has an obligation to sleep with him. Compare Emasculated Cuckold, which also draws humiliation from a character's love interest sleeping with other people. Contrast Single-Target Sexuality, the polar opposite of this trope.

Note that, pronoun-laced description aside, this trope is _not_ Always Female and also works perfectly well with man whores.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Rare Male Example occurs in _Boy's Abyss_ as the protagonist Keiji is manipulated by several women into sleeping with them, but holds off on doing it with his Childhood Friend Romance Chako because he hates himself and feels that she deserves better than him despite her insistence otherwise.
-   In _Chainsaw Man_, Sexy Mentor Himeno was an Ethical Slut who Really Gets Around, but felt she Can't Act Perverted Toward a Love Interest with her apprentice Aki, the only man she truly loved. The only reason Aki didn't reciprocate her affection was because he had the hots for Makima as a result of her Mind Control.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_:
    -   The _"Amazing Eighth Wonder"_ epilogue chapters finally reveal why Clara gets upset over Athena's habit of sleeping around. It's because Clara is secretly horny for her own mom, and is jealous that everyone gets to screw Athena _except her_. Clara finally gets her chance after being possessed by a phallic-shaped alien parasite, which causes her to act on her repressed sexual urges.
        
        **Clara**: _(maniacally)_ "Now! I'll make you MY woman, MOTHER!!"  
        _(creates speed clones and thoroughly gangbangs Athena)_
        
-   _Maken-ki!_: Miyabi was Ouken Yamato's personal secretary and was often seen lusting after him. Not that Ouken ever seemed to notice, nor did he care to, since he had entire harem of concubines. In chapter 32, he had an orgy with several of them while Miyabi watched. Even so, witnessing his virility firsthand was still enough to satisfy her.
-   In _Ookii Onnanoko Wa Suki Desu Ka?_, Kaoru ropes Souta into becoming the manager for her volleyball team, where he promptly sleeps with all of the members except her. Justified as the two of them are siblings. That doesn't stop the rest of the team from shipping them, though...
-   In _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_, Panty has sex with nearly everyone but Brief. She did offer him sex once, but Brief thought it was going too fast. Panty dropped the option right then. She does try and do it with him once she finds out that he's Beautiful All Along, but by then her hymen's rebuilt and damn-near impenetrable. They finally do the deed in the last episode, which restores her powers.

    Comic Books 

-   In Neil Gaiman's 2006 relaunch of _The Eternals_, Sprite, while explaining that his motives boil down to being really sick of being stuck in a prepubescent body, notes that he's the only male Eternal with whom Sersi hasn't slept.
-   In _Venerdì 12_, this is the dynamic Aldo had with his ex Bedelia (who had so many lovers that in high school she already referred to them with the number she had them tattoo on their inner thigh next to the "best before" date) before she brutally dumped him and stole his car. It was hinted, and eventually confirmed, it was completely Aldo's fault: whenever _she_ tried he'd either miss the hints or gross her out, and when she went at his home to give him a whole night of sex the day before she planned to dump him she flat-out told him she wanted to have sex... And he locked himself in the bathroom out of shyness.

    Fan Works 

-   The Evangelion H-fanfic _The A.L.I.A.S. Vignettes_ has Asuka finding a really creative way to torture Shinji: whenever she has a date, she drags the poor shmuck back home, throws Shinji out of his room then does the deed in there, knowing full well that Shinji is within earshot. And she's not doing this because she's a slut, she's doing this purely out of sadism.
-   In the Sherlock fanfiction series _The Art Of Seduction_, Sherlock is a gay "seduction consultant" and John is his gay flatmate. Sherlock goes to gay bars with John to pick up men and have sex with them (for one time only) so he can perform experiments about seducing people. It is mentioned many times that Sherlock has had sex with most of London's male population... at least, every man but John. John believes this is because Sherlock lives with him and just doesn't want to make things awkward with sex. Sherlock later explains that when he started living with John, he was doing an experiment about having sex with someone who had time to know more about him as a person and not just a good shag. After some time had passed, Sherlock abandoned the experiment because, despite wanting to have sex with John, he was afraid he may treat John, his Only Friend, like all the other men and lose interest afterward.
    -   During the events of the second story in the series, after Jim's attack on John, Sherlock goes on the offensive about finally having sex with John. When the third story starts, they are in the midst of doing the deed, and by the end of that story, they have a Relationship Upgrade.
-   The _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Smurfed Behind: The Other Side Of The Mirror" has the Mirror Universe version of Smurfette willing to sleep with just about every adult male Smurf in her world except her own world's version of Empath. Being a telepath, that version of Empath doesn't take kindly to this rejection and subjects her to all sorts of Mind Rape as payback for her refusal. Eventually, the Mirror Universe Empath loses his telepathic abilities for good when confronted with his world's version of the Psyche Master, sparing Smurfette of any further torment from him.
-   _Please Stop Eating The Hell Butterflies_: Kurosaki Ichigo is a massive man whore who has slept with just about every character in the story...except Gin. To be perfectly fair to Ichigo, that has less to do with him personally, and more to do with how Gin's attempts to get into his bed leave _much_ to be desired. Yamamoto himself outright states on the list that if Gin stopped being a creepy Stalker with a Crush, Ichigo probably _would_ sleep with him.
-   A major plot point of the _Naruto_ fanfic _That Look_, in which Anko sleeps with everyone in Konoha but Naruto, and even reacts violently whenever he so much as _touches_ her... After she gets him drunk and climbs naked into bed with him. And she seems to believe that he's in the wrong when he disapproves of her actions.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Boogie Nights_: Little Bill's wife is caught three times by her husband having sex with another man. He complains about not having sex with his wife and eventually kills her, hew new man, and finally himself.
-   In _Dangerous Beauty_, courtesan Veronica Franco sleeps with a very high percentage of the Venetian aristocracy, but refuses Maffio Venier, since he cannot afford her. He resents this, which becomes very important to the plot later.
-   In _Dr. Minx_, David is convinced that Carol is a slut and shows up on her doorstep expecting her to have sex with him. She dismisses him, but shortly after starts an affair with his friend. Unable to accept that a woman would choose Brian over him, David convinces himself that Carol is a murderer and spends the rest of the film trying to prove it.
-   _Fear Of A Black Hat_, a rap music Mockumentary in the vein of _This is Spın̈al Tap_:
    
    **NINA BLACKBURN**: What, if any, is the difference between a ho and a bitch?  
    **TONE DEF**: A ho fucks everybody.  
    **TASTY TASTE**: Right, but a bitch fucks everybody EXCEPT YOU.
    
-   Becomes a major plot point in _Hangin With The Homeboys_. Johnny, the naive member of four when it comes to dealing with women, falls in love with a seemingly Girl Next Door type. He convinces himself that she's innocent and virginal. Later in the film, he discovers that she does porn films and has quite the reputation with guys in the community. It seems like every guy in the know, including Vinny, knew about her and possibly had sex with her in the past. What makes it worse is that Johnny actually runs into her at a party and catchers her dancing erotically with Vinny which pisses him off. She lets Johnny know that he was only in the friend zone, before his outburst of jealousy ruined even that.
-   In the movie _Innerspace_, nebbish hero Jack Putter's dysfunctional love interest Wendy idly remarks on the irony of her sleeping with just about everyone he knows except him when he's the one guy she might actually like. At the end, after he's taken a level in badass and she tentatively suggests they start dating ("Jack, I think we should try dating. Maybe not exclusively at first, at least for me, but... "), he brushes her aside with a quick "not a chance" before moving on to his next adventure.
-   In what's essentially a Running Gag of the _James Bond_ series, despite occasionally flirting with her, Bond never sleeps with MI6 secretary Moneypenny, even as he beds a plethora of women throughout each film. (though this might not be in Daniel Craig era, as at least two scenes heavily imply that that they _have_ had sex, and if not, it's _she_ who's rebuffed _him_.)
-   In _Jingle All the Way,_ Sinbad's character, a mailman, complains about having to pay alimony to his ex-wife, who slept with everyone at the post office except for him.
-   _Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_: Harmony slept with everyone except Harry when they were in school together. (Even Chook Chutney!)
-   This is a major plot point/source of gags in _The Man with Two Brains_. After Steve Martin marries Kathleen Turner's Gold Digger, she won't consummate the marriage, but she'll do just about anyone else.
-   _Legion_: Cafe owner Bob berates his son Jeep's mooning over the pregnant (not by him) waitress Charlie for "hanging around for hind tit while she gives it away to everybody but you" (just after Bob has explained how he is really fond of Charlie).
-   _A Million Ways to Die in the West_ takes this trope to ridiculous levels with Ruth, a prostitute who sleeps with 10 guys on a slow day, but won't have sex with her boyfriend Edward because they're Christians and she wants to wait until marriage.
-   In _Trucker_, Runner calls Diane out on this fact, although her reason for not sleeping with him is a pretty damn good one considering he's married, but his frustration comes from her blatant refusal to acknowledge that they have a thing for each other, not simply because she won't sleep with him.
-   _Vixen! (1968)_: Vixen is a nympho who'll sleep with anyone she can grab (and she does). Gender or consanguinity are not concerns for her, but she is a huge racist and makes it abundantly clear she'll be damned if she ever sleeps with Niles, the one black guy in the area.

    Literature 

-   _The Culture_
    -   In _Use of Weapons_, Diziet Sma, The Handler, is definitely a Good Bad Girl (which makes sense, since the Culture is the epitome of Fetish-Fuel Future). That being said, the one person she won't sleep with is the novel's other protagonist, the sociopathic badass Zakalawe. It's hard to tell if this is because she wants to keep the relationship professional or is somewhat turned off by him. But it's not for lack of trying on his part.
    -   This is part of what drives the protagonist of _The Player of Games_ so nuts that he embarks on the epic journey that constitutes the plot. It should be noted that this is in the Culture, which is ridiculously sexually liberated (the hero is widely considered a bit odd because he has never changed sex!), which makes the snub even more annoying than usual. She does at least give him her reason when he asks, and he has trouble denying it; she gets the feeling that he's such an obsessive gamer that he treats their relationship like one, and thinks of her more as a piece to be taken than as a person he wants to have sex with. When he returns home at the end, she's ecstatic to see him and hints that she missed him so much she might have changed her mind
-   There's a short by Fukazawa Shichiro with this premise. The main character is a Jinmu (a derogatory term for second born son), in a village where second born are treated like livestock (they aren't even allowed to have sex, ever). One man who feels guilty for killing a Jinmu once, leaves a will behind before dying declaring that his wife must sleep with every Jinmu in the village. Guess who's the only one left out.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   A side character (whose face is covered with boils) reminisces about his boyhood in a small village. As a teenager, he spent hours gathering flowers for a girl in the village who had the "town slut" reputation. When he presented them to her, she laughed at him. So he killed her, and was exiled to the Night's Watch.
    -   Cersei Lannister shunned her husband Robert Baratheon to the point where he considered her frigid. She has been having an affair with her own brother for nearly two decades and also sleeps with her much younger cousin Lancel and several knights.
-   In _The Sun Also Rises_, this is true between Brett (the girl) and Jake. Zigzagged in that they are in love with each other, and Brett would very happily jump his bones if he hadn't lost them to some sort of war injury.
-   In the novel _Super Folks_, David Brinkley's ex-crush is known to have slept with every superhero except him. In this case, however, it wasn't because of any sort of disgust (indeed, it's implied she would have, if he'd tried) so much as him never thinking to go for it.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Ally McBeal_, Ally's secretary Elaine is notorious for her oozing sexuality and flirting with every men around. She is sued by her friend nicknamed Peanut who feels she intentionally humiliated him. Eventually his issues are revealed — he's in love with her and thinks everyone is her type but him. They manage to patch things up and he drops the lawsuit, though she doesn't like him back in that way. Interestingly, later seasons imply Elaine doesn't sleep around and has problems finding a relationship.
-   The title hero of _Arrow_ has slept with nearly every eligible female character—except Felicity. This seems to lean more towards the "actually caring" side of the trope:
    
    **Oliver:** _\[to Felicity\]_ Because of the life that I lead, I just think that it's better to not be with someone that I could really care about.
    
-   Penny from _The Big Bang Theory_ has slept with dozens of men, including Leonard and almost Raj (they get drunk and wake up together, but it's later revealed he was too drunk to actually accomplish the deed), and even Sheldon has at least seen her naked. Even she, however, refuses to sleep with Howard, who fancies himself a Casanova. However, eventually she settles down and gets Happily Married to Nice Guy Leonard.
-   Occurs in the _Cold Case_ episode "Rampage". A boy calling his crush out on this (after she was sexually assaulted, yet still expressed interest in the lead rapist) led her to egg on a pair of Spree Killers.
-   An episode of _Criminal Minds_ features a Big Bad who is frustrated because the girl he likes is rather promiscuous but doesn't show him even a passing interest. When he decides to make the first move and tries to kiss her, she vehemently declines. He angrily questions why, citing that she slept with every one of his friends. She answers that she got pregnant at a rather young age and that she is in fact his mother. Cue the Villainous Breakdown and Roaring Rampage of Revenge against everyone who knew the truth but didn't tell him.
-   Subverted on _Frasier_. Roz gets all over every man as soon as she sets eyes on him, but doesn't get with Frasier. However, both of them know this is because they're ultimately Better as Friends and don't want to hurt each other's friendship. In fact, when she finally _does_ have a fling with him, both of them panic about it the next day.
    -   This is explored in one episode when Roz starts a relationship with a psychiatrist who mentored Frasier through college and who is similar to him in many ways, prompting Frasier to be uncomfortable around him after he inadvertently catches them together at her apartment one night. He comes to realize that he's actually sublimating his jealousy about this trope (although she gets tetchy when he initially tries to phrase it in these terms), since he'd previously been able to comfortably rationalize the situation with the assumption that he simply wasn't her type but has now received confirmation that he _could_ be.
        
        **Roz:** Frasier, did you ever stop to think there may be something special about not being picked?  
        **Frasier:** Roz, that didn't work when I was cut from pee-wee football, it's not gonna work now.
        
-   Madalena's taste in _Galavant_ is pretty much anyone but Richard.
-   Gina from _The George Lopez Show_ will sleep with anyone... anyone, that is, that can get past the initial nausea. At one point, Ernie decides he's finally gotten desperate enough to make a pass at her, which she turns down.
    
    **Gina**: I guess I have standards. Hey, I'm as surprised as you!
    
-   The Waitress in _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ will slip into anyone's bed when she's drunk, even Frank's. Anyone except Charlie (inverting Romance on the Set, since they're married in real life.) Partly because Charlie refuses to take advantage of her and partly because he's her creepy Stalker with a Crush. Eventually rectified in Season 12, when Charlie tells her that for him, there is no one like her.
-   In _Lexx_, Zev/Xev is a love slave with an unshakeable libido - but she refuses to have anything whatsoever to do with Stanley, whom she sees as repugnant. Ironically, she herself fails to bang anyone, since her choice of lovers tend to be killed, are already dead, is a disembodied robot head, or is Stanley.
-   On _M\*A\*S\*H_, Hawkeye flirts with just about every nurse in the camp, but he completely ignores the overweight Nurse Kellye. In the last season premiere "Hey, Look Me Over", she calls him out on this and accuses him of avoiding her on purpose. Later, after secretly watching her, he sees her in a new light, but by then it's too late because she's moved on.
-   A victim on an episode of _Psych_ would have sex with everyone but the killer, who was more or less a Stalker with a Crush, resulting in said murder.
-   In _Queer as Folk (UK)_, Stuart will sleep with anyone (once) except Vince. Vince's mother says it's because Stuart's "saving him" for when they're both old. They do eventually settle down with each other, but it takes the run of the show to get them there.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_: Jadzia Dax actively dates men of all species (also a woman in one episode) but will not sleep with Dr. Julian Bashir, who has a huge crush on her. Julian coming on very strong very quickly doesn't help; she seems to prefer the strong silent type to the overeager schoolboy type. Ezri Dax, who inherits Jadzia's memories, at one point tells him that if Jadzia hadn't married Worf, she would have given him a shot, which lends credence to the theory that it is his approach more than anything that puts her off and she is more interested in him once he stops trying so hard.
-   Laurie from _That '70s Show_, after marrying Fez, refuses to sleep with him. She'll sleep with everyone else during this time and he calls her out on it. Ironically enough, she did sleep with him once and only once, before they married.
    
    -   Big Rhonda, also towards Fez, but of the "holding out for something more" variation. She's been with a lot of guys, but Fez is more special and she wants to wait. Fez...does not.
    -   When Donna is concerned that Eric might be cheating on her with the girl he's tutoring:
    
    **Fez**: I have bought many a Slurpee from her, and from what I can tell, she'll sleep with anyone.  
    **Donna**: Did she do it with you?  
    **Fez**: No, no, she has way too much self respect for that.
    
-   On _Toast of London_, Mrs. Purchase sleeps with pretty much anyone (to the point that she advertises her number on a billboard saying "Call for sex"), but she refuses to sleep with her husband unless he pays her. Considering her husband is a massive jerk, it's kind of justified in a way.
-   Male example in Owen of _Torchwood_. He sleeps around quite a bit, even having affairs with two of his coworkers (one of whom was in a relationship at the time), but never even notices Tosh who is madly in love with him. He even calls her on it in "A Day in the Death."
    
    **Owen**: For some reason you want me. You know I don't know why, but you always have — always looking at me, watching me screw all those other women, your heart breaking.
    
-   In the first season of _True Blood,_ Jason Stackhouse will pretty much bang anything female... except Tara, who has a huge crush on him. Of course, considering what happens to the rest of his conquests, that may not be a bad thing for Tara.
    -   It might be more that Tara's his sister's best friend and they grew up together; it would feel like bedding Sookie.

    Mythology & Folklore 

-   Classical Mythology (and all variations thereof) gives us the Aphrodite who was widely known for bedding gods/mortals/anything with a penis EXCEPT her husband Hephaestus. Zeus dodges this by taking the "Sleeps with Everyone AND You" approach when it came to Hera (though it didn't help much in Hera's eyes as it is unclear if they ever had anything going on after their 300-year wedding night). Of course, Zeus still didn't sleep with Thetis, due to a certain prophecy stating that she will only bear sons stronger than their fathers. He instead did the smarter and married her to a mortal- as she is a deity, any child she has with a mortal will by default be stronger than the father.

    Music 

-   The Blue Öyster Cult explore this trope, memorably, on the album _The Revölution by Night_, in "Eyes On Fire":
    
    At the stroke of midnight, staring at the phone'  
    For the millionth time I'm all alone;  
    I'm the guy she turns to, when her lovers leave,  
    I'm the wild card she's got up her sleeve;  
    But she don't look at me with  
    Eyes on fire, glowing like coals in the night;  
    Hungry eyes, burning with love and desire...
    
-   The Hush Sound "I Could Love You Much Better" in which the singer complains about this. Set to an upbeat tune, with a hint of Tsundere.
    
    While you kiss everybody but me  
    I just sit back and watch  
    Oh but one day soon I'm gonna grab you by the collar  
    And kiss you all I want
    
-   In "Sexy Soda Pop", Cindy Margolis explains this to a guy who's trying impress and seduce her with cocaine. She then does the coke with the guys she actually has sex with.
-   Ninja Sex Party's song "Dragon Slayer" is about the singer trying to go home with a girl at a party by telling outrageously Blatant Lies, such as that he won the Super Bowl all by himself, that he cured all diseases last week, and that he's killed a dragon. In the end, the girl decides to go home with everyone except the singer.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Chris Jericho cut numerous promos regarding Stephanie McMahon being a slut, one promo suggesting that she had slept with "three quarters of the locker room, and the lighting crew, and the camera crew, and the sound technicians, and the stage hands, and the prop guys, and the merchandise sellers, and the popcorn vendor in the 15th row! Congratulations, Louie!", followed with saying she'd slept with everyone on the planet Earth, before bringing out members of Planet of the Apes (2001). 'Everyone', however, did not include Jericho, leading to some sexual tension.

    Tabletop Games 

-   A very special porn star in _Unknown Armies_. Often referred to in the fandom as TWECHBY - The Woman Everyone Can Have But You.

    Theatre 

-   In _Seminar_, the only guy Izzy doesn't sleep with (at least during the course of the play) is Douglas. This is rather ironic, first because Izzy is using Douglas for his connections in the literary world, (and you'd think a little action would make that easier) and because Douglas is probably more attractive than the other guys in the play. (And unlike the teacher she sleeps with, isn't old enough to be her father).

    Video Games 

-   In _Dark Seed II_, Mike Dawson discovers his murdered ex-girlfriend has slept with pretty much every man in town except him. Admittedly, this is an awful thing to find out about your significant other, but he still doesn't have a very mature reaction to this.
-   During Act 3 in _Dragon Age II_, Hawke encounters Emile De Launcet, a disgusting little man who claims to have escaped the Circle so that he can have sex with a woman. Hawke can offer Isabela's services in exchange for his return to the Circle, at which point Isabela refuses, saying that she does have some standards.
-   Played for Drama in Max's Nightmare Sequence in _Life Is Strange_. During one section, visions of Max's best friend and potential Love Interest Chloe appear before her, flirting and making out with Warren, Nathan, Victoria and Mr. Jefferson while Max is Forced to Watch.
-   This is the gist of Shaundi's romance scene in _Saints Row IV_; when the Boss asks why he or she was the only person Shaundi never gave a tumble, her response is "You never asked for one." This is very quickly remedied.
-   In _Too Human_, Freya (Goddess of Love) rightfully has a reputation for jumping in bed with just about anyone, and indeed goes to some length to lure the main character to her bed (unsuccessfully, but that's mostly because he's too busy trying to avenge his recently-dead wife). The only one who actually calls her out on this, however, is the ever-brash Thor, who refers to her as 'The whore of the Gods', and accuses her of having 'been' with every man in the hall (it was during a council-meeting of the entire Aesir Corporation.) To this, she snarkily replied "Aye, I've been with every man here, but I've not been with YOU. Not that you'd know what to do with me." The hall is leveled with laughter as Thor splutters angrily.

    Web Animation 

-   In Red vs. Blue: The Shisno Paradox this becomes the basis of a conflict between Sister and Tucker. In their time together, it gets revealed that Tucker was lying about them having sex at Blood Gulch. Tucker also manages to ruin their time travel sex tour adventures with his shenanigans and his ego. This eventually culminates in Sister getting fed up with him after he insults her unwillingness to sleep with him; and giving him a "The Reason You Suck" Speech where she calls him out for being a narcissist who is clearly pursuing sex only to soothe his obvious insecurities. In another conversation, Sister does admit to having had romantic feelings for Tucker, but his attitude ended up ruining whatever chance he had.

    Web Comics 

-   Lorraine to Bud, in _1977:The Comic_. Although they put this right when they meet again in later life, long after 1977.
-   "Union" Jackie in _Fans!_, towards Will. Since Jackie was also something of an Attention Whore, she _also_ had a tendency to try and monopolise Will's attention while practically rubbing it in his face that he wouldn't get anywhere with her, to the point where she at one point showily rejected him in front of everyone only to also showily start flirting with someone else in his presence. Unfortunately, this ended up backfiring on her, since his friends — who, since she was deep down rather lonely, she'd also started to think of as her friends — bluntly pointed out that they didn't like her very much as a direct result of this cruelty, and when she did try to seriously pursue him (albeit still more for her own narcissistic reasons than a genuine interest in him) he eventually overcame his initial feelings and rejected her for someone else, leaving her alone.
-   _Karin-dou 4koma_: Lovable Sex Maniac Elza refuses to have sex with Mifi because of Mifi's Virgin Power as shaman of her perished tribe. The result is an extremely sexually frustrated maid who constantly begs her master for sex, with the occasional _attempted rape_.
    
    **Elza:** That tribe perished, leaving Mifi as the last priestess. That said, she must stay pure, or else her powers will disappear. If she loses her purity, just to satisfy myself, Mifi's tribe will perish in a different meaning. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be showing any restraint...  
    **Seren:** (Why is she a good person under _this_ circumstance?)
    
-   Jodie in _Loserz_ has slept with virtually every person her age, of both genders, in the entire zip code. _Except_ for her two best friends, Ben and Eric. Oddly enough, this isn't even used to lampshade how pathetic they must be (although they are both geeks): Even at their horniest and loneliest, even if they're all _stoned_, neither of them seems to even _think_ of asking Jodie for sex, or vice versa. Its just not in their mental universe at all. All three of them are just _that deep_ in each other's Friend Zone. At least it's mutual.
-   _Magick Chicks_: Faith has a raging libido and has slept with much of the student body at Artemis, excluding her secretary, Sandi, who's been permanently friendzoned. Plus, Faith is also dating/banging Ash and she's fallen in love with Tiffany. With all of the competition in the way, Sandi doesn't have a chance.
-   _Mr. Boop_: Sonic the Hedgehog is deeply hurt when he finds out Alec and Betty Boop had an orgy with everyone except him.
-   In the backstory of _Shadowgirls_, teenaged Charon (pronounced "Sharon") was portrayed as going through every bad boy in Innsmouth, while using her best friend, Jackson, as an emotional backstop when those flings inevitably went sour. When Jackson finally has enough and tells her off, Charon tells him that she would've turned to him... eventually. It's implied that they do actually get together later... just in time for Charon to disappear and return, amnesiac and pregnant.
-   Used several times in _Something\*Positive_ to emphasize how ugly Davan is supposed to be.

    Web Original 

-   This is Frollo's plight in _The Frollo Show_ - he loves Panty, who is well known to have slept with at least 1000 men, but Frollo is apparently below her total lack of standards.
-   The _Real Time Fan Dub_ version of Dr. Eggman was on the bad end of this. In his drunken rant at the end of the game, he points out that he took measures to ensure the safety of his wife Martha, all in the hope that she will actually sleep with him for once, but discovered throughout the game that she had sex with the entire anthropomorphic Sonic cast yet still wants none from him.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Clerks: The Animated Series_, Caitlin Bree chases anything that moves — even a Ferris wheel in the final episode — but still won't give Dante the time of day.
-   _Clone High_ has great fun with this with Cleo's many references to sexual escapades, yet Abe has to jump through several incredibly difficult hoops to get anywhere near sex, even after he becomes her boyfriend.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Seemingly, every teen-aged boy in Quahog will sleep with any teen-aged girl... except Meg Griffin, who is portrayed as so hideously ugly that boys will go out of their way _not_ to have sex with her; several have taken extreme measures to avoid the humiliation of having "scored" with Megan. Usually this is implied, such as the hunk who, after Meg asks him to a dance, _kills his own little brother_ just so he can use the funeral as an excuse to avoid going with her.
    -   Quagmire, who's even made multiple passes to Meg, refuses to have sex with Peter's boss Angela.
-   Gigi from _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_. Harvey becomes frustrated that this continues even after they marry. Not that it stops Gigi from claiming Harvey fathered her baby.
-   Michele of _Hey Joel_.
    
    **Michele**: Oh God, why do I always sleep with my friends?  
    **Joel**: Maybe you just wanted to take your friendship to the next level?  
    **Michele**: Some friendships are already at the perfect level.
    
-   A variant in _Metalocalypse_. Dethklok, being Dethklok, is besieged with women who will do unspeakable sexual things with every member of the band... except Murderface, the bass guitarist so ugly and unpersonable that being in a band that can raise mythological monsters and change the very nature of reality still isn't enough to get him laid. Not even the female roadies (who are all loyal to the band) will sleep with him.
-   In _Sealab 2021_, (white) Debbie will sleep with anyone and everyone... except good-looking but idiotic Stormy. Apparently she once told him she was saving herself for marriage.
-   _Titan Maximum_: Sasha sleeps with just about everyone. And yet, she finds team nerd Willie utterly repulsive. He worships her and dreams about one day touching "her left, or, even better, right, boob!"
