Whatever's coming, it isn't good news.

When humans cry, their tears are used to convey various emotions — most commonly, anger, happiness, sadness, and when having a breakdown. But tears also fall if people are scared out of their wits. If this happens, it may or may not be an indicator that they are slipping into insanity or panic as a result of the fear.

Can be used in a serious sense to show a character becoming emotionally broken or a comedic sense to show the character as a big baby. Never used as a form of Manly Tears. For many, this is Truth in Television.

Not to be confused with '80s New Wave band Tears for Fears.

    Anime and Manga 

-   In the final scene of the last episode of _Monster_ we are treated to a flashback of Nina's and Johann's childhood where their mother is forced to give one of them up for an experiment. The two hold onto their mother's hand begging her not to let go, and their mother hesitates before handing over Nina who proceeds to scream "No!" in horror as tears spring from her eyes.
-   _Lovely★Complex_: Risa was either crying or was _close_ to crying when she was threatened by Mimi.
-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, Shinji often indulged in this, especially in _The End of Evangelion_. Asuka sheds those as well, during her Mind Rape.
-   Nina in _Code Geass_ does this during her spectacular Freak Out.
    -   Also Kallen when she's about to be shot in her prison cell.
-   _In Final Fantasy: Lost Stranger_, tears well up in Shogo's eyes upon witnessing Byblos' full monstrous form after running out of options to fight him.
-   _Serial Experiments Lain_: Happens quite a bit with Lain and Alice being the main suppliers of fearful tears. Special mention goes to the final episode where Masami Eiri turns into a grotesque gooey fleshy monstrosity that uses its giant tongue to try to eat Lain and Alice. Alice is so freaked out by this point that her sanity takes a sharp nosedive and she hits Lain out of fear while tears stream down her face.
    -   In episode 2 a suicidal drug user does this constantly.
-   Gohan in _Dragon Ball Z_ until about the Frieza saga. Used also in Dragon Ball for weak villains, bystanders, and sometimes a character encountering the next level of Training from Hell.
    -   Then again, Gohan is _four_ to _five_ during the above-stated time period. A better example would be Vegeta when he finally realizes he can't defeat Frieza. In the manga, the narrator even points out this is the first time Vegeta has actually cried out of fear.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   Being a six-year-old girl at the time, Vivio did this a lot in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_, such as when the scary Belkan Knight suddenly appeared with weapons drawn, or the first time Nanoha-mama needed to leave her to go to work, or the period when she fell into the hands of Jail Scaglietti.
    -   The glasses-wearing bully from _ViVid Strike!_ can be seen crying right before Rinne smashed her face into the lockers as part of her Roaring Rampage of Revenge.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    -   (North) Italy will start crying when he gets scared, which happens fairly often. His brother, Romano (South Italy) is prone to this as well, just not as frequently.
    -   America did this when he was little because England's expression scared him. As an adult, he got teary-eyed from fear while watching horror movies with Japan one night.
    -   Russia can only sob and make futile cries of "Go home!" when his sister Belarus literally tears down his door to demand that they get married. Proof that even Yanderes can fall into this trope when there's an even _bigger_ Yandere in the room.
    -   This is usually Latvia's, Estonia's, and Lithuania's response whenever they have to deal with Russia.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_: Envy does this when reduced to his true form and Roy prepares to kill him in one shot.
    -   In his final appearance, Father, begins to weep as he is dragged back into the Gate of Truth.
    -   Also, Falman's eyes are _streaming_ as he refuses to open the doors to Central HQ for Fuhrer Bradley. It's the exception to the rule that these are not Manly Tears - he's obviously just this side of wetting his pants, but standing up to a man who just totaled a tank with nothing but a sabre and a hand grenade takes brass ones, however pathetic you look doing it.
    -   A scientist involved in creating the immortal legion cries as he is about to be eaten by his own creations.
    -   In the 2003 anime version, when Barry the Chopper threatens to kill Ed after capturing him, Ed sheds a few tears of fear as he tries to escape. Winry, having been captured by Barry and at his mercy, does this too.
-   _Ghost Stories_: In episode 11, the normally brash, foul-mouthed Satsuki breaks down in tears of fear and despair after a good time being stalked by Merry Mary. It probably has something to do with the fact that Mary is a living doll that never goes away and is bent on torturing her for fun.
-   _Hellsing_: Rip van Winkle's fight against Alucard was unique for a number of reasons, not the least of which being that she spends half the fight sobbing uncontrollably in sheer terror.
    -   Not quite unique, given that Luke Valentine had the same reaction to Alucard removing one of his restrictions.
    -   In the 7th OVA Seras is Mind Raped into reliving her horrible childhood. She cried out of sadness and fear as she was forced to watch her mother's corpse being raped and she cries as she is reliving said memories in the present.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean_: During the final chapters Emporio spends most of it crying in sheer terror, and it's no wonder why: Enrico Pucci has just succeeded in killing all the heroes, including the previously undefeated Jotaro, using a stand which accelerates time, causing the Earth to start completely eroding and changing, eventualy leading to _the whole universe being reset_ with every living being being unaffected and conscious about the whole thing. So, from a group that included a convicted killer that can destroy his victims from the outside out and someone who can freeze time, the Sole Survivor is a kid with a power that has no combat use, and he's being chased by a villain who doesn't want to leave any loose ends.
-   _Karin_: A little girl does this in chapter 13 when confronted with a serial killer who escaped from the Creepy Doll Boogie-kun.
    -   Karin does this when asked by Anju if she wants to listen to her tell the history of her collection of creepy dolls.
-   The eponymous character from _Kaiji_, along with other people, did this while crossing a beam bridge. As a matter of fact, this is a recurring trope in this series. We get to see a lot of men breaking into tears as they face the despair derived from the Absurdly High Stakes Games.
-   _Future Diary_: Yukiteru does this a lot, especially in the beginning.
    -   The other Yuno does this in chapter 53 after she's been stabbed by the first Yuno, as she's writing "Help me" on the wall with her own blood.
    -   Minene does this in the anime as she's getting her bad eye pulled out as torture.
    -   Eighth does this as she faces death by Yuno.
-   In the anime of _Umineko: When They Cry_, Rosa Ushiromiya is terrified to the point of a torrent of tears while she is being forced to eat her own daughter Maria's living, laughing, disembodied head.
-   Keiichi from _Higurashi: When They Cry_ combines this with Tears of Remorse and Berserker Tears in the first arc.
-   Minoru of _Karate Shoukoushi Kohinata Minoru_ does this during the two times he is almost raped by Pedro.
    -   And Minoru's friends do this as he gets his ass kicked by Kevin. Additionally, Minoru _and_ his friends when they realize Kevin really intends to kill Minoru.
-   In _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_ Kuroda takes a break from blowing up stuff (and students) to try to rape Student Council President Noriko with his gun. When Kuroda announces these intentions, poor Noriko reacts by wetting herself and crying to the point where her face is a mess. Fortunately, Inugami interrupts him.
    -   Later, Haguro starts crying and shivering in pure fear when Inugami shows him his werewolf form. Then he starts Laughing Mad and things just go downhill from there.
    -   Aoshika does this as she's being gang-raped.
    -   A guy Inugami threatens as to Haguro's whereabouts does this.
-   Tsuna of _Reborn! (2004)_ does this at times.
-   _Gankutsuou_: Two men who are going to be executed do this during the public execution scene.
-   Makoto does this in the last episode of _School Days_ as he's being stabbed to death by Sekai.

-   _Naruto_:
    -   Sakura does this when she's frightened by how much Sasuke has changed as a result of the Curse Seal which makes him act more violent and sadistic.
    -   Sasuke did this when he was younger after he found out his beloved brother was the one who killed their entire clan and is terrified his brother will kill him.

    -   Haku also does this in the anime, when his father just killed his mother and is about to kill him.
    -   Sakura does this in episode 5 after Kakashi hit her with a genjutsu that made her see an injured Sasuke.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Omaeda as he's being chased by Barragan. It's an understandable reaction considering Barragan has the power to _age flesh and bone into nothingness._ Even more justified in that if even a bit of his black flame touches you, you'll have to remove that part of your body, or you'll die without Barragan needing to put _all the flame around you_.
    -   Dondochakka frequently does this.
    -   Keigo in chapter 413 as he's running for his life from Aizen.
    -   Hiyori after Hollow Ichigo nearly strangles her to death.
    -   A notable one comes from the Sternritter Robert Accutrone in Chapter 603 when he realizes that Yhwach is about to unleash his Auswählen on all Quincies that were left on the battlefield.
-   Poor Tetsunosuke of _Peacemaker Kurogane_ is prone to enduring traumatic situations such as running for his life so he occasionally lapses into this.
-   Lenalee does this in chapter 88 of _D.Gray-Man_ as the Millennium Earl terrorizes her.
    -   Allen also gets these as he's taking a glimpse at Kanda's horrific childhood memories, though "tears of simultaneous fear, frustration, betrayal, and rage" might be a better description.
-   _Perfect Blue_: Mima during the rape scene, during her Freak Out moment after returning to her apartment, and as she's running for her life from Rumi.
-   _Betrayal Knows My Name_: Yuki during episode 13 when his best friend Kanata reveals himself as Big Bad Reiga, tries to kill him with ice spears and he notices Reiga's stabbed Takashiro with the ice slabs because he shielded him.
-   _Sukisho_: Sora as he's suddenly bombarded with memories of his horrific childhood, as he's struggling not to stab Minato after being mind raped into doing so, and as Minato decides to walk into the knife as his way of atoning for his past sins.
-   A lot of characters in _Highschool of the Dead_ do this, what with all the scary zombies running around. A notable example occurs at the beginning when a schoolgirl gets attacked by a zombified student and she starts crying profusely. Her friend soon gets attacked as well and cries in the same fashion.
-   Sousuke of _Full Metal Panic!_ breaks down in tears when he is left behind to be killed by an atomic bomb heading his way, sobbing "I don't want to die." Out of all the horrific things he's seen and near-death experiences he has been through, this is the only time it happens.
-   Numerous ship passengers do this in chapter 55 of _Black Butler_ as they're being chased by zombies.
-   Used in _Claymore_, the source of the current page pic.
-   Happens at least twice in _Franken Fran_: to the female spy from chapter 5, and to officer Kuhou in chapter 13. Both times, Fran was about to operate on them, which make the young women's tears more than justified.
-   The class rep does this when being scared in an episode of _Ouran High School Host Club_.
-   In chapter 13 of _No. 6_ Safu has been kidnapped and is in the correctional facility against her will about to be operated on and feels tears come to her eyes upon learning this.
    -   Shion does this in episode 3 when he is being taken over by the "wasp".
-   In chapter 16 of _Koharu no Hibi_ Mika does this as she's confronted by Koharu.
-   In _Deadman Wonderland_ Ganta does this understandably as he's being forced to watch the Carnival of Corpses.
-   In _SHUFFLE!_ Asa does this as Kaede is threatening her with a knife.
-   _Speed Grapher_: A woman does this as a Depraved Dentist approaches her with his "instruments".
-   _Fruits Basket_: Takei does this after being threatened by Black Haru. Tohru also does this in the woods when she thinks someone ominous is sneaking up on her and she hits the person with her bag but it turns out to be Kyo.
-   _Devil & Devil_: In volume 1, a young girl has them as she's being transformed into an infant.
-   Casca of _Berserk_ gets these during the Eclipse as she's being confronted by demons as well as when she is raped to insanity.
-   Skuld does this in _Ah! My Goddess_ when Aoshima tries to take her away to rape her.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: Two guys do this in chapter 38 of the second manga season after Akuha threatens them.
-   When the Arc Villain Master Hades in _Fairy Tail_ finally manages to lure Big Bad Zeref out of hiding, his pissed-off expression alone is enough to render what remains of the Quirky Miniboss Squad paralyzed and crying in terror.
-   In _Gakuen Babysitters_, all the toddlers have displayed this for comedic effect at one point or another. Kazuma has these the most, being the resident crybaby.
-   Sakuya Kumashiro from _Tenchi in Tokyo_ lets out a mix of this, a brief Big "NO!" and Broken Tears when she's about to be reabsorbed into Yuugi, her creator.
    -   During a flashback, Yuugi's backstory has her screaming and crying as Empress Hinase seals her away for wreaking havoc around, despite her pleas and her (true) claims that she's terrified of the darkness. In the final episode, Yugi again cries in terror when a fully empowered Tenchi confronts her, screaming "NO, NO! I DON'T WANT TO BE BURIED! NOT AGAIN!".
-   A common response to impending death in _Attack on Titan_, like it happened to Carla Jaeger right before she was at the receiving end. Quite a few soldiers break down crying at the mere _thought_ of having to actually face the Titans in battle, well aware that they are members of a Redshirt Army.
    -   Sasha is prone to this but still manages to be a Cowardly Lion when the chips are down.
    -   Krista can barely contain her tears, she's so terrified of what is to come when she enlists in the Survey Corps.
    -   Bertolt weeps hysterically both times that Mikasa tries to kill him. One would hardly blame him.
-   Mami had these in Episode 10 of _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ when during an earlier timeline, the others found out about the Awful Truth about the fate of the Magical Girl after seeing Sayaka transform into the Witch Oktavia von Seckendorff. After managing to put Sayaka out of her misery, Mami has a Freak Out upon realizing that if that is the fate of all Magical Girls, then it would have better to die as a human (or at least humanlike) rather than suffer as a Witch. The tears she cries after shooting Kyouko were a mix of this and utter despair at being alone again.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_: Chimchar's 'battle' with Paul's Ursaring. Seeing Ursaring bearing down on him with a Hammer Arm not only drives Chimchar to terrified tears, but also makes him _pass out_. One can hardly blame the little monkey: as if a grizzly bear ten times your size trying to smash him like a pancake isn't bad enough, he's also under the influence of the fear-inducing Secret Power attack. Through the eyes of Chimchar, the already-intimidating Ursaring appears downright nightmarish.
-   _Mekakucity Actors_:
    -   Episode 11 shows us a flashback of Ayano's suicide two years ago, and she's shown breaking down into tears just before she goes through with it.
    -   Hiyori cries every time she's killed in Episode 4. While she's also shown to be smiling, the horror of each death (hit by a truck, impaled multiple times, falling a great distance) and the fact that she's just a child makes it obvious that she's crying out of fear.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Caesar Clown gets these right before Luffy finishes him off.
    -   Usopp, Nami and Chopper are prone to comedically doing this.
-   _EDENS ZERO_
    -   After being horribly abused by a gangster named Sibir, E.M. Pino would start crying with terror whenever she thought about what would happen if she didn't follow his commands.
-   _Sakura no Ichiban!_: A would-be victim of "The Jack The Ripper" in the second chapter sheds tears of fright while he is pursuing her and before he almost kills her, Asami jumps to her rescue.
-   Played for Laughs in Chapter 10 of _Asteroid in Love_. Mikage gives out this when Ao gives her a huge Death Glare when she raises the possibility of Mira moving to the Geology Group.
-   Dorothea of _Akame ga Kill!_ breaks down massively in the face of death where she is about to be killed by Leone. With her body starting to undergo Rapid Aging to reveal the old woman underneath her childish facade, her eyes are full of terrified tears as she begs for Leone not to kill her. Her begging goes as well as you'd expect, and she ends up Squashed Flat with a boulder.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2016)_, Ilia and Colin cry in terror when encountering King Bulblin and his forces.

    Comic Books 

-   Near the end of _Infinite Crisis_, Alexander Luthor Jr. nearly kills Nightwing with a blast of antimatter. Batman is so enraged he's willing to throw away his principles by _drawing a gun_ and presses the barrel right into Alex's forehead, seconds away from blowing his brains out. Forced to face his own mortality after all of his delusions of godhood, Alexander starts tearing up in fear.
-   In _All Fall Down_, Portia weeps at the climax— not for her own sake, but for what the Modern Prometheus could do to her friends.
-   _Spider-Man_: During one of the first appearances of Venom in _The Amazing Spider-Man (1963)_ #300, Mary Jane Watson underwent this after the former freaked her out. Later Spider-Man, dressed in his black suit (which resembled Venom's of course), was approaching her and she mistook him for the villain. Peter lampshaded this, commenting that Mary Jane was a tough girl and wouldn't easily be scared, so whatever freaked her out like that must have been something truly frightening (as he himself would eventually find out).
-   Issue #20 of _The Powerpuff Girls,_ "Bow Jest," has Blossom losing her hairbow during the girls' battle with Princess Morbucks. Her eyes well up with tears, then she freaks out before going after her bow.
-   Various characters in _Fables_ do this when their lives are in danger or they're badly wounded. Even characters who are recognised badasses do this, and they don't get belittled for it; the comic treats war, violence, and death very seriously, and nobody suggests that crying when faced with a horrible death or in terrible pain is the mark of a coward.
-   Happens in _Empowered_ quite a few times. Usually to Emp, but it happens occasionally to others. Despite the generally light tone of the comic, it actually treats trauma very seriously and being absolutely petrified when in danger of death or mutilation is not considered to be embarrassing by any character who isn't a total moron/asshole<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   _Figment (Disney Kingdoms)_: When separated from Figment, Blair, and Fye in the Nightmare Nation, Chimera curls up and starts sobbing after being reminded of her (unrevealed to the audience) fears.

    Fan Works

-   _Child of the Storm_ has, in the sequel, Carol Danvers' little brother, Steven 'Stevie' Danvers, after they're kidnapped by vampires, on the entirely reasonable grounds that he's a thirteen-year-old boy - and unlike his older sister, is not a combat-hardened Super-Soldier - and they're monsters that don't particularly need him alive and have quite seriously speculated about _eating_ him, and only aren't as part of a deal Carol made to come quietly.
-   _Loved and Lost_: Fluttershy, who is terrified of dragons, sheds these when she and Rainbow Dash are exiled to the Dragon Lands by Prince Jewelius.

-   _the superhero game_: Kyle Rayner used to _induce_ this reaction back in his heyday as the White Lantern, and more than a few shed these when he shows up back in his prime, spoiling for a fight.
    
    Villains used to _cry_ when they heard Kyle Rayner was in town.
    
-   _Naru-Hina Chronicles_: Sakura has this kind of tears when Sasuke, while talking about wanting to train some more in order to defeat Evil Sasuke, gives her the same look he gave her during the infamous night where he left Konoha. That look reminds her of her biggest fear, which is to lose him again.

-   In _To Kill a Mockingbird_, Atticus Finch is implied to cry after the lynch mob departs. It's likely that he was reacting to the fear of the mob hurting his children. As Scout describes:
    
    _I turned to Atticus, but Atticus had gone to the jail and was leaning against it with his face to the wall. I went to him and pulled his sleeve. "Can we go home now?" He nodded, produced his handkerchief, gave his face a going-over and blew his nose violently._

-   In _The X-Files_ episode "Pusher", Scully tears up while trying to desperately pull Mulder from his trance induced by a crazy man who can will people to do things with his mind. Actually, both Mulder and Scully are near tears in that scene, as Mulder is forced to include Scully in his and Modell's game of Russian Roulette.
-   In the _Quantum Leap_ episode "Another Mother", a teenage boy is kidnapped. He's already displaying this trope, but it kicks into high gear when one of the kidnappers starts coming towards him with an incredibly creepy look on his face, leaving little doubt as to what he has in mind.

    Mythology & Religion 

-   _The Bible_:
    -   The _Book of Revelation_ starts it off with a prophecy concerning Jesus:
        
        _Look! He is coming with clouds,_  
        _and every eye will see Him,_  
        _even those who pierced Him._  
        _And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him._  
        _Even so, Amen._ (Revelation 1:7)
        
    -   In Revelation chapter 18, the merchants of the earth weep at the destruction of the city of Babylon, realizing that the end of the earthly kingdoms ruled by man has come and the Day of the Lord is at hand.

-   On Day 5 in _NEO: The World Ends with You_, Fuya Kawahara weeps profusely after his trap is defused pre-emptively and his last resort destroyed. Nagi attributes it to deep-seated insecurities, while Rindo believes it's his fear of death talking through his tears. On Day 7, after he and the Deep Rivers Society finish the Reapers' Game in last place - not helped by being wiped out by Susukichi to the last man - he starts bawling again... and for good reason, seeing as the punishment for finishing the Game in last place is having your entire team erased, something he knew was going to happen.

    Visual Novels 

-   Overlaps with Broken Tears and Villainous Breakdown during V's route of _Mystic Messenger_ when V tells Rika that he never actually loved her in the first place and that, on his end, their relationship was just him trying to figure out who he was through her. She completely breaks down, clutching at her chest with tears streaming down her face, frantically trying to figure out why she was never good enough for him and what she must have done wrong to make him stop loving her, hysterical at the thought that she's never been truly loved by anyone.

-   This probably explains Karkat's reaction in _Homestuck_ to seeing Gamzee apparently advance upon him while holding the Warhammer of Zillyhoo.

Ozai is about to burn him as punishment for talking back to him, the camera shows a Zuko who turns to look at his father while about to cry in complete _terror_... These are simultaneously tears of _absolute heartbreak_, given he's being forced to face the fact that his father doesn't love him at all. He goes back into denial about it for a few years afterward, though.
    -   Another example is Toph (who is blind) crying when she and Sokka are hanging from the airship. With only Sokka's hand for contact - and her grip slipping - she cannot see a thing, and only knows she's high in the air.
