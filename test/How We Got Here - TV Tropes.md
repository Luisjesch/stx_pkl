_"Well, this is where you came in..."_

A type of In Medias Res/Whole Episode Flashback, where the story opens at a point at the middle or near the end of the story, and the bulk of the story is spent showing how the character got to this point.

See also Back to Front, Death by Flashback, Foregone Conclusion, Starts with Their Funeral, Framing Device, Little Did I Know, and This Is My Story. Goes very well with Private Eye Monologue. Can often be used as a highly effective Driving Question. Can often overlap with Once More, with Clarity if and when the introductory scene in question reappears. A specific variant is How Dad Met Mom. Can take the form of Flashback B-Plot if a character's story alternates between the past and present but is not primarily a frame story.

    Advertising 

-   There's one amazingly funny NASCAR themed commercial for Diet Mountain Dew out there. It starts with the #88 racecar being driven through a street. The driver does an amazing skid and comes to a stop in his driveway. The driver gets out:
    
    **Kid:** Whoa, dad! Where'd you get that?  
    **Father:** Oh you won't believe what just happened!  
    _(Cuts to him pulling a Diet Mountain Dew bottle off an empty shelf. He turns and finds Dale Earnhardt, Jr., in full fire suit, looking at him in disbelief)_  
    **Dale Earnhardt, Jr.:** Don't tell me you got the last Diet Dew.  
    **Father:** Yeah.  
    **Dale Earnhardt, Jr.:** I love the taste of Diet Dew. Whaddaya want for it?  
    **Father:** Uhhh... _(glances at Earnhardt's car outside in the parking lot)_  
    **Dale Earnhardt, Jr.:** Deal.

    -   Done in the weirdest way possible (by courtesy of a Lemony Narrator) in an episode. The story begins with our heroes falling down in a pit, which is a different situation than the one the chapter before ended with. Then...
        
        **Narrator:** Whoops! Smart enough readers should have noticed that this has nothing to do with how the last episode finished! Let's go back in time and maybe you'll finally get what's going on.
        
    -   And when the flashback is over:
-   _X-Factor (2006)_:

Sapphron is beginning to fear the worst until she is approached by Cardin Winchester, who claims to work for her brother and that he can take her to him. When she finally does find him, not only is he alive and well, but living it up in a penthouse in one of Vale's ritziest neighbourhoods, wearing a nice suit and sipping on a glass of expensive whiskey. Naturally, after letting him have it for leaving she and their parents sick with fear, Sapphron wants to know why Jaune has been radio silent for almost a year, how and why he apparently has the likes of Cardin Winchester on his payroll and how he could possibly afford to live such a luxurious lifestyle.

-   _Truth and Consequences_ opens with Marinette and Adrien arguing in the ruins of the Agreste Mansion, both their Miraculouses gone, Gabriel apparently dead, with it apparently being all Marinette's fault. The story then cuts back three months to explain exactly how things reached this point.

    Manhwa 

-   The sixth volume of _Witch Hunter_ opens on Tasha _somewhere_ (most probably in England), fighting a guy whose face we've only seen once and whose name is yet unknown (Lancelot), and apparently in a tight spot, what with his right arm having been ripped off and Halloween being nowhere in sight. That's the first few pages; the chapter then goes on to show Tasha being sent away in a mission. Two volumes later, he's still only on his way to the place where this all is supposedly going to happen...

    Music 

-   The video for Bronski Beat's "Smalltown Boy" begins with Jimmy Somerville leaving town by train, then flashes back to the homophobic bullying incident that forced him to leave home, before returning to him and his bandmates on the train.
-   Gorillaz's album _Cracker Island_ starts with the song of the same name, which vaguely talks about the plot of the album after the fact. Meanwhile the music video shows how the arc is going to end. (2D and Noodle in a hospital being interrogated by the cops for something that happened at the Hollywood Sign, Russel seemingly waking up from a coma in that hospital, and Murdoc wearing cult leader robes seemingly bringing a dead body back to life and then kissing her).
-   Moby's video for "Run On" (from the album _Play_) is this.
-   Pink Floyd's concept album _The Wall_ begins with the song "In The Flesh?", sung from the perspective of the main character Pink: "_If you want to find out what's behind these cold eyes / You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise._" From there the album goes into a long flashback of Pink's entire life, beginning with the sound of a baby crying leading into the next song "The Thin Ice". The narrative of the album finally returns to where it began with the sort-of Dark Reprise "In The Flesh".
-   The Slick Rick song "Sittin" In My Car" begins unsurprisingly with Rick sitting in his car. Rick then proceeds to tell the tale of debauchery and intrigue that explains why he is waiting in his Jeep outside a club for a particular girl.
-   The Vocaloid trilogy _Shinseiki ~New Millenium~_,_Risoukyou ~Utopia~_,_and A Faint Wish_. The first video is chronologically the last, and the second two are basically flashbacks telling us how the story led up to the first video.
-   Watsky's video for "Stupidass" starts with Watsky dirty and naked, then rewinds until the audience sees what happened.
-   The Who's Rock Opera, _Quadrophenia_, opens with the main character stranded on a rock off the coast of Brighton, in the pouring rain, with no means of egress, and goes on to explain how he ended up there.

    Podcasts

-   On _The Thrilling Adventure Hour_, the "Beyond Belief" episode "Love Love Me Doom" parodied this. It opens with Frank and Sadie yelling at each other and wanting a divorce and then the narrative goes back to before the fight. However, when time catches up, they only _act_ the fight because it was heard at the beginning, though they still love each other.

    Roleplay 

-   On _The Gungan Council_, "It's Not That I Keep Hanging On, I'm Never Letting Go" slips into three different flashbacks to explain how and why Bianca and Darth Apparatus were separated for over two decades.

    Theatre 

-   Many Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals begin at the end and are told in flashback: _Evita_, _The Phantom of the Opera_, _Aspects of Love_, _Sunset Boulevard_ (of course, the source material for this one did, as well). _Love Never Dies_ opened this way as well in the original London staging (and the cast album), but by the time the Australian production was filmed, the prologue was dropped.
-   _Ang Huling El Bimbo_: The musical opens with the three men being given news of Joy's death before flashing back to The '90s, when they were all friends in university.
-   _Anne of the Thousand Days_ begins with Anne awaiting execution while Henry steels himself to sign her death warrant.
-   In _City of Angels_, Stone begins his Private Eye Monologue after being wheeled into a hospital with a gunshot wound in his shoulder. It's left ambiguous whether or not Stone survives ("No great loss if he don't," an orderly remarks). The rest of the Show Within a Show unfolds in flashback, culminating in the three gunshots heard at the start of this scene.
-   _Fiorello!_ begins with a short prologue in which Fiorello, as mayor of New York City, reminisces about the very beginning of his political career.
-   _Grey Gardens_ begins in 1973 with Big and Little Edie playing a record of "The Girl Who Has Everything", which segues into the 1941 flashback for the first act. At the end of the 1973 second act, the story returns to the opening scene.
-   _The Haunted Through-Lounge and Recessed Dining Nook at Farndale Castle_, supposedly an accident-prone amateur production, gives a meta twist on the structure. The curtain comes up to reveal the cast on stage still rehearsing the final scene of the play, with the protagonists anxiously awaiting an ambiguously-described fate. They break off and head backstage, then the show-within-the-show begins at the first scene, shows everything leading up to the scene glimpsed at the beginning, and finally proceeds to the end of the story.
-   The musical _Merrily We Roll Along_ does this to the point where it's told in entirely reverse order.
-   In Noah Smith's stage version of _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, the first act proceeds linearly, while the second act has this structure; it opens with Utterson arriving at Jekyll's house for the final showdown, then recounts his investigation in a series of flashbacks, before continuing on to the showdown itself.
-   The off-Broadway run of _Vanities: The Musical_ followed this format, with a prologue in the mid-80's/early 90's, which the story returns to in the Distant Finale.
-   _Waterfall_ begins in 1945 just after World War II, when Noppon's wife Pree discovers the painting made by his late love interest Katherine, before flashing back to the 1930's for the main story, then returns to the opening scene at the finale.
-   The musical _Wicked_ follows the same format as the novel, with the added twist that it turns out Elphaba faked her own death.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_, the prologue of the fourth case starts with Phoenix on a hospital bed looking over a report about a case handled by Mia. After learning what transpired during that trial, Phoenix mentions on how an incident occurred that made him remember another important incident from his past. The first act of the fifth case shows why he ended up on that hospital bed.
    -   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies_ begins on December 17 with a trial for a courtroom bombing that happened the previous day. After Case 1 is over, Athena spends half the game flashing back to the events of the previous months (April in Case 2 and October in Case 3). After the narrative finally arrives to December 16, the day of the bombing, two days are glossed over as this timespan is already covered in Case 1. Then the second half of Case 4 is told, followed by the final Case 5. It's important to note that a good deal of Dramatic Irony comes when the end of the first case reveals how a certain character apparently turns their back on the rest of the gang — the player is left wondering what led to this decision, and finds the answer through the aforementioned flashbacks.
    -   In _Ace Attorney Investigations_, the second and third cases are flashbacks occuring before the first case, and the fourth case is a flashback _seven years back_ from the third case. It's less confusing in context.

-   _CLANNAD_ starts with the first part of the final Illusionary World sequence, which isn't fully played until the end of the game.
-   _ef - a fairy tale of the two._ starts with the ending, and jumps to two different points in the middle, before starting at the beginning.
-   _Fate/stay night_ plays with this. It starts with a scene from the the third day, before starting on the first, but from the perspective of one of the heroines. The rest of the prologue plays out from her perspective until an event shortly after the first scene, with one of the characters from that scene holding her up at swordpoint. After the opening movie and starting the game proper from the menu, it goes back to the first day, this time from the Protagonist's perspective.
-   _Goodbye Volcano High_: The game begins the night the meteor is doomed to hit Earth and wipe out the dinosaurs, and the player (as Fang) as to make their Big First Choice of whether or not to burn the yearbook. Once a choice is made, the game flashes back to Fang's first day of senior year eight months prior, and the story begins.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_: The first arc begins with a long monologue and a black screen, with someone apologizing... as a wet and sickening THWACK noise sounds repeatedly in the background. This is Keiichi apologizing to Rena and Mion after bludgeoning them to death. This is likely where the anime adaptation (see above) got the idea of opening some arcs (including this one) with a clip from the end, or a suitably dramatic point.
-   During Emi's route in _Katawa Shoujo_, a week after Hisao angers Emi enough for her to throw him out of her house, he is approached by Misha, who asks him what's wrong. If he tells her, she tells him to go apologize to her. He does so, then discusses this trope in an attempt to save the relationship he and Emi have. It works.
    
    **Emi:** Determination? What do you know about determination?  
    **Hisao:** I know that there's a girl so determined to take care of a total stranger that she'd steal his food at a festival. I know that there's a girl so determined to help me with my own problems that she'd draw up a complete dietary and exercise plan, and that she'd not only draw up the plans but she'd follow them with me even when she couldn't run. Determined enough to keep me at arms length that she'd put herself through emotional pain if she thought it was the right thing to do. Although, there's one thing this determined girl didn't quite plan for, which was that I might feel the same kind of determination to keep her from being hurt. I fell in love with you and I refuse to let that be thrown away because you're afraid of losing me.
    
-   _Kira☆Kira_, over and over again. You're dropped in the middle of a scene, and the next five minutes are spent explaining what happened before then.
