It can't be insanity if your best friend sees it too... Right?

The French call it Folie à Deux, "the madness of two". This trope happens when two people begin experiencing the same delusion or hallucination together, a shared version of Through the Eyes of Madness. Often it happens with one going mad first, and the other slowly but surely experiencing Sanity Slippage as a result. Often, they will begin distrusting other friends and loved ones who don't experience the delusion (ironically viewing _themselves_ as the sane ones). In cases where Insane Equals Violent, this may be a cause of a Big Bad Duumvirate.

In Real Life, this condition is known as Shared Psychosis or Shared Delusional Disorder (SDD).

Often overlaps with Infectious Insanity, but not always; two people might go mad in the same way but independently, rather than one being "infected" with madness by the other. See also I See Them, Too and Contagious Cassandra Truth.

-   _The Killing Joke_: The Joker heavily implies that this trope is the reason he and Batman are destined to continue battling each other forever. Illustrated by a joke he shares with the Dark Knight at the end:
    
    **Joker:** See, there were these two guys in a lunatic asylum... and one night, one night they decide they don't like living in an asylum any more. They decide they're going to escape! So, like, they get up onto the roof and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town, stretching away in the moonlight... stretching away to freedom. Now, the first guy, he jumps right across with no problem. But his friend, his friend daren't make the leap. Y'see... Y'see, he's afraid of falling. So then, the first guy has an idea... He says 'Hey! I have my flashlight with me! I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings. You can walk along the beam and join me!' B-but the second guy just shakes his head. He suh-says... he says 'What do you think I am? Crazy? You'd turn it off when I was half way across!'

Or maybe a supernatural curse from Winslow killing a seagull causes it... Or maybe Winslow is hallucinating the whole thing... Or maybe...

His wife Samantha tries desperately to help him because his mother has schizophrenia. However, at the end, Sam is trying to help him recover by going to a beach house. It closes with a POV shot from Sam's perspective that reveals a storm coming over the beachfront. It ends there, leaving it ambiguous whether his vision has come true or whether Sam is experiencing a shared hallucination with Curtis.
