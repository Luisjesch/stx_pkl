The main characters stand in a tight circle and stretch their arms around their two nearest neighbours. Tends to happen fairly often and for lots of reasons such as supporting one character who just went through something difficult or emotional, the final group action before splitting up or carrying out a big plan, or as part of the denouement.

Often times there will be one character who is reluctant to participate in a group hug whenever they occur. That character usually warms up to the idea by the end of the series.

It's both heartwarming and tearjerking at the same time, especially since Opal never returns for the second half of the season and is only mentioned once.
    -   Outside of season finales, "Dr. O: Party Time, Excellent" has Dr. O, set to leave Precinct 13579 for the Odd Squad Space Station, shares a hug with Olympia, Oprah and Oona after it's revealed that she loved the disastrous goodbye party Olympia and the other agents threw for her.

Red's first act is to disband the club.
