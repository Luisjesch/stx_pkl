**Quinn:** So you'll do it?  
**Daria:** Right after I change into my fur bikini. _\[Tom smiles at this\]_  
**Quinn:** Daria!  
_\[Quinn storms out of the room\]_  
**Tom:** Hmm, maybe you should make it easy. Give the poor kids a break.  
**Daria:** I lied about the fur bikini.  
**Tom:** Damn!

— _Daria_, "Lucky Strike"

A two piece bikini, or some close variant, that is covered, trimmed, and/or lined with fur (either real or fake), or even feathers. Usually worn for Fanservice.

It's an uncommon, but highly pleasing costume. And unless it's heavily adorned, it's a bit more usable than a typical Impractically Fancy Outfit — at least for running around in warm conditions.

Could count if there is just fur trimming. In this case if the bikini is red, and the fur is white, it overlaps a little with Sexy Santa Dress (or even some Happy Holidays Dresses).

If the bikini is actually used for swimming, the way water acts on fur will be ignored or the fur will somehow be waterproof — though let's face it, a woman wearing one of these is trying to show off her body, not her high dive.

Everyday wear for a Nubile Savage or female Barbarian Hero. If you are a Jungle Princess, this is your Ermine Cape.

Typically worn by female characters, because Bare Midriffs Are Feminine. However, this trope even avoids a Double Standard, as men can have Loin Cloths instead, the favorite impractical outfit for northern barbarians across the realms of fantasy.

There's a notable variant with the more risqué works involving Beast Men (or, even more scandalous, Little Bit Beastly people) — where their _actual fur or hair_ grows in exactly this kind of shape to cover their naughty bits while exposing as much of everything else as possible.

Sometimes the wearer also has a Feather Boa Constrictor.

A Sub-Trope of Pretty in Mink.

A Sister Trope to Seashell Bra, Going Fur a Swim (when the bikini and fur are separate garments), Fur Is Clothing (in which a Funny Animal has removable fur, which might result in this trope).

Compare An Ice Suit, Sexy Sweater Girl, Sexy Santa Dress, Playboy Bunny, Pelts of the Barbarian.

Contrast Happy Holidays Dress, Stylish Protection Gear.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   One of the most famous is Raquel Welch's Nubile Savage outfit in _One Million Years B.C._, even though it's more hides than fur. As a side note, the ads for the film even said "Raquel Welch wears MANKIND'S FIRST BIKINI!" Recreated<small>◊</small> by Heather Graham.
-   One of Jane Fonda's outfits in _Barbarella_.
-   The Ringo Starr comedy _Caveman_ had future wife Barbara Bach in one — "good girl" character Shelley Long was more conservatively dressed.
-   The Amazons in _Frankenstein Island_ are dressed in what are supposed to be animal skin bikinis (but, due to the lack of a budget, look more like animal print bikinis).
-   In _Jungle Goddess_, Greta wears a fetching leopard skin halter top and miniskirt ensemble, with a matching leopard skin cape for those chilly evenings.
-   Publicity shots for the film _Love Happy_ shows Marilyn Monroe in an ermine bikini: Full View,<small>◊</small> Closeup 1,<small>◊</small> Closeup 2.<small>◊</small> This wasn't in the actual film, but publicity-exclusive outfits were actually pretty common for films.
-   Worn by Samantha, the adopted human daughter of the eponymous ape man in _The Mighty Peking Man_.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original

-   In _Tales of MU_, Mackenzie wears a fur bikini as part of her female barbarian costume for a Halloween-esque party.

    Western Animation 

-   _Daria_'s title character once sarcastically claimed she would put one on (which made Tom suddenly perk up). Jane also wears one in one of her alter egos.
-   Diana from the animated _Dungeons & Dragons_ was stuck with this outfit.
-   Lois Griffin on _Family Guy_, wore one when she starred in the porno film _Quest for Fur_.
-   _The Legend of Tarzan_ has Queen La sporting one with a Badass Cape, since she rules over an army of leopard men. This is actually more modest than the original novels, where she was bare-breasted.

-   Happens in the _Tom and Jerry_ short _Of Feline Bondage_. Jerry invisibly torments Tom with a pair of scissors, cutting off his fur until it resembles a tank top and boxer shorts. The invisibility wears off while he's laughing about it. Tom sees Jerry, grabs both him and the scissors, and cuts _his_ fur to look like a bikini(or maybe a bra and panties) and a bob cut. Both of them see how ridiculous they look, and dissolve into raucous laughter.
-   As does Kitty Katswell in episode "Hot Dog" of _T.U.F.F. Puppy_.
-   When asked to provide something "fierce" for Aisha and Bloom to wear to a conference between the royalty of the planets of the Magical Dimension in a Season 5 episode of _Winx Club_, Stella conjures up a couple of these. She's more than a little disappointed when these outfits get vetoed by the other two.
