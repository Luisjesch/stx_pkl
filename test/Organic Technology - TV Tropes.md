There's a good reason why that helicopter looks like a whale.

_"They've got technology, sweetheart. They just build it in different ways."_

If a society in Science Fiction isn't either following Technology Levels or magic, then you can rest assured that they're making use of organic technology.

Cars, planes, phones, computers, buildings, spaceships, weapons (including artillery and war vehicles) and everything else required for a proper sci-fi story will be provided in the form of something that is warm, moist, skooshy and drips goo everywhere. Often, this will go so far as to include a convenient thought-based interface. Manipulation of organic matter may be part of the technology as a whole, or even what enabled the tech in the first place. Advanced nanotechnology, when not depicted as the classic blobs of liquid metal, will often be depicted in a similar but decidedly more synthetic fashion.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

This type of tech is a common feature of sea-dwelling sapients. Not only are cities entirely made out of cool-looking coral, it's a technological evolutionary path that does not start with the step "set something on fire" or "throw wheels on it", which for a species that lives entirely underwater would be, respectively, impossible and generally useless. Likewise, excessive humidity wouldn't cause important stuff to short out.

Civilizations who use this technology are also frequently users of Sufficiently Advanced Bamboo Technology. Depending on the aesthetic choices of the depiction, the organic technology may seem Ambiguously Robotic as well. Organic technology is sometimes portrayed as especially advanced. If the organic technology is a staple of the setting or theme, compare Bio Punk.

Often crosses over with LEGO Genetics and is depicted as a Sculpted Physique. Often used by a Horde of Alien Locusts. See Living Ship for one specific example. Compare Bio-Augmentation, which could be Organic Technology applied to the human body in new and fun ways. Contrast Mechanical Lifeforms, which are organisms that happen to be mechanical in nature. Often creates the Womb Level in games. A Hive Caste System is based on using naturally evolved biology rather than technology made from biology. Applied to agriculture, the end result of this trope is often a Multipurpose Monocultured Crop.

This is becoming an actual thing. Interestingly, Real Life synthetic biology _seems_ to be going the reverse direction of this trope: making biology look more like chemistry and nanotechnology, rather than making technology more like biology. Whether we'll get our meaty jetpacks remains to be seen.
