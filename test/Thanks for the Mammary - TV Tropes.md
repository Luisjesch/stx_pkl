_(Sheldon is keeping his eyes closed while helping an injured Penny get dressed)_  
**Penny:** Okay, now you're gonna help me get my arm into the sleeve.  
_\[beat\]_  
**Penny:** ...is that my arm?  
**Sheldon:** ...it doesn't feel like an arm.  
**Penny:** Then maybe you should let it go.

Alice is perfectly fine. She's walking along, enjoying herself. Out of nowhere, Bob bumps into her and, by sheer accident (probably), grabs her boob. Alice may forgive Bob, but at the same time she could resent him (even hate him) or use this as an opportunity for blackmail. More often than not, however, she will hit him.

The Accidental Pervert is contractually obligated to have this happen at least once, if not Once per Episode.

Subtrope of Suggestive Collision. Somewhat related to Funbag Airbag. See also Not What It Looks Like. Compare and contrast with Skinship Grope.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ah! My Goddess_:
    -   In the manga:
        
        **\*SQRSH\***  
        **Keiichi:** (_reaching for an off-panel bag of chips while studying_) Huh? Doesn't feel like chips. Did I throw some buns in that bag?  
        **Urd:** Oh, MY. ♥ Gently, honey... gently.
        
    -   In the OVA video, Urd grabs Keiichi's hand and _**forcefully presses**_ it against her breast.
-   In the manga _Aoharu × Machinegun_, Hosokawa Haruki did this accidentally toward the main Heroine, when he was pulling her into his room and fell on top of her. This also led to him knowing her true gender and used it to blackmail her.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: Rochka freezing the ground under Suzu causes her to fall over and brace herself by accidentally grabbing Matsuri's breasts. As Matsuri was originally male, he's embarrassed both by the actual grabbing and the high-pitched squeak he made in response.
-   In _Bakemonogatari_, during one of the times that Araragi is fighting with Mayoi, he gets an accidental handful. She doesn't notice at the time, but is pretty freaked out when he mentions it later ("You stole my first touch!").
-   _Black Clover_: When they enter the Shadow Palace, Mimosa falls on Asta with her breasts landing on his face. She's quite embarrassed by this.
-   _Bleach_: Yoruichi sticks her hand between Orihime's breasts while holding it up to stop her from apologizing for her new outfit's Cleavage Window.
-   _Blue Dragon_: When Bouquet is eavesdropping on the others while invisible (and _nude_), she is doing some voice-throwing from next to Marumaro when he ends up slamming a fist upon her chest much to his pleasure.
-   How did the police find out that _Cat's Eye_ was a gang composed of women? Easy: in the first chapter Toshio managed to get the jump on Hitomi during a heist, and, while unable to see her face due to darkness, he accidentally groped her breast.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_:
    -   Touma wakes up from his latest misadventure to find his hand grabbing the breast of Little Sister Misaka. At first he freaks about the fact that he's such a pervert that he'd do such a thing in his sleep, only for Little Sister Misaka to inform him he only grabbed her hand, _she_ put his hand on her chest (she was measuring his vitals). Touma then realizes that, due to anesthetic, he can't actually _feel anything._
    -   Later, when Touma mistakes Mikoto for a shape-shifted Thor, he tries to dispel the "illusion" and grabs her chest. She is so shocked that he is able to leave before she snaps out of it.
-   _Chrome Shelled Regios_: Layfon to Naruki, after falling on top of her in a sparring match. Unlike most girls in anime, she understands it's an accident and jokes about it.
-   _Creo the Crimson Crises_: Suou wakes up on a morning and grabs something warm, and soft, and then realizes it's Creo's breasts, who Sleeps in the Nude and claims she had to sleep on Suou's bed since it was the only one around. Suou doesn't buy it.
-   _Don't Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro_: In one chapter, Nagatoro's friends are mocking Senpai for "never touching a girl's boobs", and decide to force him into it. Gamo then reveals she was actually hiding a couple of anpan buns in her blouse, which was what he touched, but the scene clearly triggered Nagatoro's anger forcing them to run. Once she finds out, she decides to pull the same stunt on Senpai, but it backfires when one of the buns slips out of her blouse and he grabs her boob for real, much to her embarrassment.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Muten-Roshi, the resident Dirty Old Man is easily distracted by any female that catches his eye, and will cop a feel at every given opportunity.
    -   In the first non-canon movie, Yamcha (again) accidentally grabs Pasta's breast in a fight.
-   In the first chapter of _Dusk Maiden of Amnesia_, Teiichi doesn't quite believe Yuuko is a ghost, so he reaches out to grasp her shoulder, reasoning that a ghost will be insubstantial. That's just when she turns to face him, though, so he gets a handful of **quite** substantial breast. Yuuko is totally unfazed by this. She **is** a ghost, however.
-   This happens a few times in _Elfen Lied_.
    -   The first example is when Nyu starts fondling Yuka to sexual excitation.
    -   After Kohta accidentally gropes Nyu early on, she sees it as a action of endearment, like a hug. And then she apparently starts to innocently rub herself on his hand, since it apparently felt so good. Cue Kouta's cousin walking to the room.
    -   Nyu also gropes and nearly rapes Nozomi because she misunderstood something that Kouta said, making her believe that it was OK to do it to big-breasted people.
-   _Fairy Tail_
    -   During a fight with Juvia, Gray freezes her in ice and realizes a second too late that his hand was latched onto her breast when he froze her. Juvia is embarrassed and delighted; Gray is equally embarrassed and utterly baffled by her reaction.
    -   In chapter 298, Jellal trips and grabs Erza's breasts. They are both embarrassed but Erza accepts it was a mistake.
    -   In chapter 331, Lucy gets magically stripped by a dragon and sent flying right into Natsu. After the initial shock, Natsu declares that he has no choice but to cover her up himself... and puts his hands on her bosom. Cue reaction punch from an already EXTREMELY embarrassed Lucy.
    -   In the omake _Welcome Back, Frosch_, Sting, Rogue, Yukino and Lector have been looking all over for Frosch who has gone missing. When they finally find him, Sting and Yukino try to head directly for Frosch, but Rogue tries to stop them, accidentally groping Yukino's breast. Yukino's too embarrased to do anything, so Sting punishes him instead.
    -   During the final arc, when August tries to anihilate Natsu and Lucy, Natsu manages to partially dispel his magic saving them both, but he lands on top of Lucy and once more grabbing her boobs (at least this time around she's dressed). Funnily enough, Natsu takes a while to let go of her even after Lucy asks him to get off of her.
-   Saito's done this a few times in _The Familiar of Zero_ with different girls that often tease him. He's also tried doing it to Louise, who's often not happy with it. With the introduction of buxom Tiffania, it becomes a recurring Boob-Based Gag. One example of this is when she asks Saito to check if her chest is real by touching them.
-   In episode 10 Fullmetal Alchemist (2003), Edward pins down Classy Cat-Burglar Psiren, only to accidently cup his hand around one of her breasts, to which he gets flustered and immediatly jumps off her shouting "I didn't mean that!" which allows her time strike back and escape from him.
-   Early in _Full Metal Panic!_, Sôsuke performs a Diving Save to prevent Kaname from being hit by a truck... and ends up with his hand on her breast. She actually doesn't notice until Sōsuke gives her a reassuring squeeze... Made at least ten times funnier by the fact that her first reaction is apparently pure delight — which thoroughly shows on her face — for about three seconds. After which she realizes what's going on, resulting in one of the funniest expression changes ever...
    -   In _Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu_ Kaname walks into the groping hand of a Poor Little Rich Kid, who asks if her breasts are real. Cue Megaton Punch. "They're real!"
    -   Also in _Fumoffu_, Sousuke has a Bedmate Reveal this way, when he wakes up and puts a hand on Tessa's breast, Tessa having 'accidentally' wandered into his bed while sleepwalking.
-   _Freezing_: Roxanne gropes Satellizer _The Untouchable Queen_ in their first appearance, much to the participants of West Genetics' shock/horror, and accuses her of implants.

-   Shino of _Girlfriend, Girlfriend_ has the bad luck of having her boobs and butt grabbed accidentally by Naoya several times. In the anime, she even lampshades this in one of the transitions to commercial.
    
    **Shino**: Why is it always me getting my t and a grabbed?
    
-   In _Gintama_, Tsukuyo offers to let Gintoki grope her breasts, he declines, ends up doing it accidentally anyway, and gets a suplex for his efforts.
-   _Girls Bravo_: Fukuyama molests Kirie so often, that hardly an episode goes by without at least one scene of him groping her. Whether it be through her clothes, or going so far as to yank up her shirt so he can fondle her boobs directly. It usually last several seconds as she seemingly stands there letting him, until she finally flattens him for it.
-   In _Girl Got Game_, Chiharu trips and his hand lands directly on Kyo's chest. Since Kyo is pulling a Sweet Polly Oliver, her reaction is not embarrassment, but panic about her secret being uncovered (she had just removed her chest wrappings because she thought she wouldn't need them that day). Thinking quickly, she claimed that her chest was bruised and swollen.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_: While preventing her from running into a wall of water and drowning, Noboru accidentally grabs Anko's breasts. She's too terrified at almost dying to give him an Unprovoked Pervert Payback.
-   How Sano found out Mizuki's secret at the beginning of _Hana-Kimi_. Mizuki had been knocked out playing soccer with Nakatsu, and guess what Sano accidentally touched when he picked her up? When Mizuki found out at the end, she was understandably distressed. In another chapter, Sano tried to put a hand on her shoulder, but missed.
-   Haruhi Suzumiya gets the computer club president to grope Mikuru against his will (Mikuru does not approve either). Kyon is an accessory to the fact, since he photographs the whole thing so that Haruhi can use the photos for extortion. This was modified in the animation by having Haruhi take the pictures instead, which is terribly amusing since Kyon has absolutely no reason to be in the room when this is going on _except_ to take pictures. As a result, he just stands there acting all disgusted at Haruhi's actions.
-   _High School D×D_:
    -   A variation is invoked early on. After Rias promised Issei the chance to grope her for completing a contract, she springs it on him so suddenly she counts to five before he can even touch her, leaving him incredibly disappointed. She compensates him by letting him feel them with his chest as she hugs him instead. Issei's goofy smile and transparently half-hearted objection show he's more than okay with doing it that way.
    -   The series is notable for how sparingly this trope is used, considering _Highschool DXD_ is a fanservice-friendly series with a boob-obsessed Lovable Sex Maniac for a protagonist. Most of the time, when Issei cops a feel, it's because he was _invited_, or he's using his mind-reading magic (don't ask). When he does accidentally grab the chest of a girl he knows better than to touch, like Asia, he's horrified with himself for enjoying it and apologizes profusely.
-   In _Hundred_, Hayato Kisaragi's fight with Claire has him crash into her at high speed, and then get a handful of her huge breast.
-   Happens to Iria in _IRIA: Zeiram the Animation_ by a kid that fell on top of her.
-   In _The Irregular at Magic High School_, Mizuki trips and Mikihiko jumps up to catch her, accidentally groping her in the process.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: While posing as a boy aboard Captain Tennille's ship, Anne is revealed to be a girl when she gets knocked overboard and Jotaro jumps in afterward to rescue her from sharks. Upon pulling her out of the water, he accidentally grabs her chest, and then after a _very_ awkward pause between the two, Jotaro takes off her cap to reveal her long hair underneath.
    -   _Golden Wind_: Fugo falls onto Trish's chest face first when the vehicle they're in makes a sudden turn.
-   Shirogane ends up grabbing Kaguya's breast in a panic in chapter 15 of _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ when he gets scared by a cockroach, leading her to bite him in retaliation. This event would become a plot point 152 chapters later when Kashiwagi wrongly comes to the conclusion that they've already gotten to second base after finding out that they recently started dating.
-   _In Another World with My Smartphone_: Bell Flora, the terminal gynoid in charge of the Babylon Alchemy Ward, invokes this on herself as her compatibility test, by grabbing Touya's hand and forcing him to fondle her huge breasts. Him backing off means he passed it.
-   _Karakuri Circus_: In a manga-only arc, Masaru gets accidentally drunk on saké and ends up groping one of the three older girls in the room with him, mistaking her breast for a door pommel. Soon enough, his male friend tries to make him vomit out the alcohol by jamming his finger in his throat while another girl holds him, but Masaru drops his head and he ends up poking the girl behind him right in her cleavage line.
-   _The Keeper Wants to Build a Zoo in Another World, so He Tames Monsters_: Ikuhara's first meeting with Merou, combined with Suggestive Collision and Crash-Into Hello.
-   _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ does this trope in the form of the _Ma-style Memory Recovery Technique_ which is essential grabbing Miu's boobs in order to snap her out of her Unstoppable Rage or Brainwashed and Crazy state. The first time it's used, it works. The second time...not so much.
-   In both the anime and manga version of _Ladies versus Butlers!_, Akiharu is confronted by Selnia who is convinced from his appearance that he is up to no good. When he decides to ignore her she takes a swing at him, both of them trip and he ends up with his hands on one of her breasts. It wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't so stunned that he was still touching her when she recovered her wits. And this is just the beginning.
-   In _Lord Marksman and Vanadis_, Tigre has a pair of magnets active even when he's _sleeping,_ and has groped five of the seven Vanadis and Limlisha already.
-   Keitaro of _Love Hina_ has been theorized to have breast magnets in his hands considering how often this happens to him. What usually follows is either a punch (Naru), an innocently/happily surprised "Oh my!" (Mutsumi), a scream (Shinobu), or a blush and an excited giggle (Kitsune).
-   In _Love Live!_, Nozomi will not hesitate to grope the other girls as a form of 'punishment' when they act out.
-   Erio and Caro's first meeting in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ had Erio's hands end up in two embarassing places when they crashed in a heap after he caught Caro when she tripped. In a subversion of the usual reactions, the two of them simply disengaged efficiently after a short moment of embarassment and the incident was quickly forgotten. It probably helped that they were both only ten. However, this lead to a Running Gag for the Fan Artists & Doujin Writers.
-   _Maken-ki!_:
    
    -   Due to the nature of the series, Takeru's hands and face repeatedly end up in Haruko's melons. He ends up groping her with such regularity that she can hardly be blamed for thinking he's doing it on purpose; since at least half the time, _he is._
    -   In chapter 29, it's revealed that Haruko has an unexplained habit of ending up in other girls' beds and groping them _in her sleep_. Which is lampshaded by Ms. Aki in the anime's corresponding episode (13):
    
    **Ms. Aki:** _(amused)_ "I've heard of a sleepwalker, but never a sleep-_MOLESTER_."
    
    -   Averted in Aki's case, in the series proper. But during the second OVA, she gets drunk and offers to let Takeru feel her up. She didn't have to ask twice.
-   In _Mayo Chiki!_, this is how Jiro finds out that the resident Chick Magnet is a Bifauxnen and later he does the same to Usami. It should be noted somehow their shirts came undone when he did it.
-   In _Minami-ke_ when Natsuki, one of Touma's older brothers, gets pushed into Haruka resulting in a grab. Haruka knows perfectly well that it was accidental and does not hold it against Natsuki. _However_, the incident occurred in front of Haruka's class, so for the sake of appearances she still has to punch him out.
-   The main character in _Miss Machiko_ has this happen to her both accidentally and purposefully Once per Episode... among other things. Kenta is the major offender; for him it is like say "Hello!".
-   A curse shared by Kimihito Kurusu of _Monster Musume_, Mamoru Onodera of _Deadline Summoner_, and Eita Touga of _12 Beast_. It's like their hands have a magical magnetic attraction to breasts.
    -   In addition to the numerous times the standard version appears, a variation occurs in an early chapter of _Monster Musume_: Miia burns her hands in a kitchen accident shortly before she's due to shed her skin. Because of this injury, she needs Kimihito's help but requires that he be blindfolded while she gives him verbal directions due to the intimate location. He confuses her directions (thinking she meant his left when she meant her left) and accidentally touches her "intimate location."
-   _My Hero Academia_: Snipe accidentally touches Hagakure's breasts with his elbow after he's beaten in the end of the final exam.
-   Inagawa Goro, a recurring character in _My Lovely Ghost Kana_, frequently expresses a desire to encounter the supernatural. In one issue, he wishes that he could "reach out and touch it," and grabs at the air—while the titular Cute Ghost Girl is floating right in front of him.
-   Subverted in an early chapter of _My Monster Secret_: Asahi runs into Youko and appears to accidentally grope her chest, but the next panel zooms out to reveal that he actually grabbed her shoulder.
-   In _Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water_, this happens when the mobile island the protagonists are atop start shaking violently, and Herton fall on top of Grandis. She naturally responds to this with a Megaton Punch.
-   In _Nagasarete Airantou_, Shinobu challenges an unsuspecting Ikuto to a sword fight. Before she can land the first blow, she stumbles and Ikuto rushes to catch her. He inadvertently gropes her _and_ ends up winning because shortly afterwards she was consumed by "a warm feeling in her chest" and is unable to battle.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has Negi do this to Asuna _a lot_. It helps that most of the time it genuinely _is_ accidental. Lucky bastard gets away with it scot-free most of the time, due to his age. Humorously, the one time he gets socked for it is when he does it while magically aged-up.
-   _Omamori Himari_
    
    -   Happens to Amakawa Yuuto, mostly with Himari. He seems to have mixed feelings on this...
    
    **Yuuto:** Himari's are big after all... (Gah, what am I saying!?)
    
    -   On at least one occasion, he wakes up with her in his bed, with his hand full of boob. Unlike the standard "OHCRAPIHAVETOSTOP!" reaction, he briefly considers massaging it. Then she wakes up.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Luffy's introduction to giant mermaid Princess Shirahoshi. Apparently they feel like pudding.
    -   He also accidentally does it to Empress Boa Hancock when she is trying to smuggle Luffy on board a Navy ship, hiding him under her coat. Had it been anyone else, she probably would've minded.
        -   It happens again during the filler _Carbonic Acid King_ arc, when Luffy meets Hancock... by burying his face into Hancock's chest. Again, had it been anyone else, Hancock probably would've punished the guy.
    -   Variation in Punk Hazard as while fleeing Smiley Sanji clutches his heart... while being in Nami’s body at the time — he even gets a excitement induced speed boost over it.
-   In episode 5 of _Panzer World Galient_, Redd Windu grabs Hilmuka's breast as hugging her. In reaction, she slapped him.
-   The first episode of _Parasyte_ involves Shinichi unconsciously groping his childhood friend's breast. At this point, though, Migi had replaced his right hand so this was done more by Migi than Shinichi.
-   _Ranma ½_. This may take some time...
    -   When Ranma first comes to the Tendō Dōjō, Nabiki proves Ranma's (apparent) gender by first poking her/him in the breast, then rubbing it. She later emphasizes her point by grabbing her/his breast again. And, when it seemed Ranma's bust size had increased in a late manga story, she proved it by... you guessed it! Groping hir again.
    -   During Tatewaki Kunō's introduction, he plunges into a pool alongside Ranma. His first hint that something was _amiss_ is when he holds onto the latter and accidentally grabs her breast and squeezes.
    -   An anime-only scene in the first season has Sōun try and break up a fight between Ranma and Genma, both in cursed form, by pushing them apart with a hand on each chest. He then promptly realises he's cupping Ranma's breast, and his daughters have seen him doing so. He tries to claim that it's Not What It Looks Like, and promptly catches a fist in the face from Ranma due to not letting go.
    -   In another episode of the anime, male Ranma stands up, half-faints, and braces himself. On Akane's chest.<small>◊</small> As expected, a Megaton Punch follows.
    -   Sometime in the late manga (and an anime OAV), Ranma has to confront a ki draining teacher, Miss Hinako, whose technique can only be sealed away by hitting three shiatsu points on her chest and two on her back. Not much of a problem when Miss Hinako is in the body of a eleven-year-old girl... a very big problem when she inevitably absorbs his Battle Aura as he's hitting the points, causing her to grow up into a tall and buxom woman, and he gets a handful of breast for all the school to misinterpret.
    -   Ranma tried to grapple Ukyō when they fought, near the end of her introductory arc, but accidentally wound up with a handful of her melons instead. Which is how he _finally_ realized she was a girl.
-   In _Rave Master_ Elie is running towards the rooms where Haru is fighting just as an explosion destroys the door and sends Haru flying towards her. He lands with a hand on her chest. She is not amused.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_:
    -   In the bonus chapter of the first season of Kurumu gives Tsukune the usual Marshmallow Hell treatment after seeing him looking drained after Moka sucked his blood. Tsukune tries to reach up to push her away... only to grab the wrong spot.
        -   In season 2 of the anime, Kurumu use this twice to seduce him.
    -   An occasion in Season 2 has Tsukune do this to Kurumu's mom twice. The first made by she herself for tease him, the second accidentally when he fall on her and Mizore's mother.
    -   Gin, who wants to grope one of the girls at any chance. When in the manga he save Tsukune from Kuyou, he grope Kurumu claiming that this is his reward.
-   Done in a surprisingly abrupt manner by Itoshiki-sensei in _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_ (the episode with the roads signifying different excuses for avoiding responsibility). Occurs with absolutely no lead-up, and his "victim" Chiri tries to pressure him to marry her in order to "do things properly". Worth noting that she demanded marriage even earlier when both she and Itoshiki went to rest in nurse's office unaware of each other and she rolled on his bed in her sleep. She's... pathological (but aren't they all).
-   Meliodas of _The Seven Deadly Sins_ does this and and other lewd things to Elizabeth quite often.
-   In _Shinjuku D×D_, the male protagonist Inui does this to the female protagonist Maria in their first meeting. However, this is because Inui is a doctor and he thought Maria was developing breast cancer. Although he was proven to be wrong, he did tell Maria to visit his clinic just to make sure she wasn't developing one and Maria didn't mind after that.
-   Happens a couple time by Gourry to Lina in _Slayers_.
    -   Once when they are laying in a field — Gourry falls asleep and rolls over, his hand landing on Lina.
    -   And then in the second season where Xellos grabs Gourry's hand and makes him grab Lina to test a theory. Naturally, pain is involved both times.
-   _So, I Can't Play H!_:
    -   Seen in episode 2, when Ryosuke tries to stop Lisara and her cousin, Quele, from fighting. He unintentionally ends up with one hand on each of their breasts, but couldn't resist giving 'em a squeeze. Quele is mortified by it and backpedals away from him. Lisara belts him for it.
    -   Ilia inverts it, by purposely allowing Ryosuke place his hand down her cleavage, to distract him while she gauged his life energy to determine whether he was "The One".
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie_, Tails grabs hold of Sera after being scared and one of his hands mistakenly grabbing onto one of her breasts. Knuckles reads him the riot act.
    
    **Knuckles:** TAILS! Get off!  
    **Tails:** _\[Immediately leaps off her with an embarrassed look\]_ I'm so sorry!  
    **Knuckles:** I never thought you'd stoop that low!
    
-   In _Soul Eater_, while Death the Kid is complaining about how everything around him is asymmetrical, he grabs Liz and Patti's breasts and screams, "Even your boobs are different sizes!" Liz angrily punches him out.
-   _Sword Art Online_:
    -   Happens to Kirito in the Aincrad arc, where Asuna teleports in and has a Crash-Into Hello with him. Subsequently the oblivious Kirito pushes his hand right into her breasts and squeezes while wondering what he's holding. Predictably, she screams and gives him a slap that sends him crashing into a pillar.
    -   Kirito is even more prone to this in the gameverse where his hand is practically a boob magnet. He's ended up groping Asuna, Leafa, and Sinon to name a few, all without choice.
-   In _Tenchi Muyo!_ OVA episode 3, after Ryoko's little prank on Ayeka, she ends up flying backwards towards Katsuhito, he gropes both her breasts. In anger, she turns around to punch him, only to have him block it. It's a clue that Katsuhito isn't who he says he is.
-   In _To Heart 2_, Takaaki falls on Karin and has his hand on her breast. Karin uses this to blackmail Takaaki into joining the UFO Research Club.
-   _To Love Ru_:
    -   Rito also seems to have breast magnets; he does this with nearly all the female cast (always accidentally). Although he must have one in his head too, leading to a lot of accidental Marshmallow Hell.
    -   Also a rare variant where Rito accidentally grabs Mikan's _butt_ (Thanks for the Glutes?). It proved very popular among the fanbase and lend to a second chapter with more of Mikan getting her ass grabbed by him.
    -   One of the times Rito was turned into "Riko", Nana accidentally groped _his_ breasts (with a little Funbag Airbag along with it), leading to a fit of jealous rage. In another case, Riko ran his breasts into Yami's face and then he ended up prone with her hand on one, causing him to echo Yui's cries of being "shameless" to Yami, who seemed either confused or offended.
-   _Tomo-chan Is a Girl!_:
    -   At the start of the Middle School Flashback Arc, Junichiro playfully punches his old playmate/rival/sparring partner in the chest over showing up to the first school they attended together in a girls' uniform, only to recoil in shock over the 'squish' as Tomo admits she had been strapping her breasts flat since they started developing a couple of years ago but her mom finally insisted on her getting an actual bra.
    -   Mizusu at one point tries to invoke a Suggestive Collision by pushing Jun down a set of stairs into Tomo's arms. He reflexively dodges and ends up knocking Carol flat with a handful of _her_ bosoms.
-   In episode 32 of _Urusei Yatsura_ when Ataru is carrying the female assistant librarian who turns out to be Wendy from Peter Pan, while Lum is throwing books at him to make him put her down he fondles her breast.
-   _Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!_: Given Hana's tracks of land, she obviously gets subjected to this every once in a while (sometimes with Marshmallow Hell, too). Unusually for this trope, most of the time it comes across as Laser-Guided Karma for her own antics, given her penchant for making fun of Shinichi.
-   In the first episode of _Vandread_, Dita crashes her dread through the hull of the Male fleet's flagship, and right into Hibiki, throwing her on top of him and knocking them both out. When Hibiki comes to, he's unaware that Dita is still laying on him unconscious and his face is covered by her chest. He grabs a breast and squeezes and exams it for a few seconds, curious as to what it is (Men have had no contact with women for generations in the series). Dita apparently woke up only after he was done, or just wasn't bothered by it. In Dita's case, the later is actually possible.
-   _Variable Geo_: Yuka and Satomi both wind up on the receiving end from Yuuki and Manami respectively.
    -   During the opening exchange of Satomi's first match, Yuuki restrains her with an arm lock, then slips her hand down Satomi's vest and fondles her. She shrugs free and tells her to knock it off, but Yuuki ignores her and proceeds to shred Satomi's uniform to expose her breasts and panties.
    -   Whereas Yuka gets a mysterious phone call telling her to come to Osaka, where Manami startles her by grabbing her breast from behind and giving it a squeeze. After which, she introduces herself and reveals she was the caller.
    -   And _"The Complete Visual Collection"_ artbook for the OVA includes several pictures of Manami groping her. Including one where the girls are all in lingerie.
-   A non-mammary example occurs in _Video Girl Ai_. Being played in Yota's broken VCR made Ai's breasts smaller.

    -   _33 & 1/3_: Drebin is at the store squeezing grapefruits to test for ripeness while looking the other way.

-   This trope is a Running Gag in all the _Scary Movie_ parody films.
-   Wally (Richard Pryor) does this to the Femme Fatale Eve (Joan Severance) in the movie _See No Evil, Hear No Evil_ when he tries to capture her, probably as an strategy for her to move her hands for him to know where they are, as he’s blind… or that’s his excuse:

He is a twelve-year-old who (because of his unusual smallness) is playing baby Jesus in a Christmas play, and the person playing Mary (who just happens to be the prettiest girl in the class, who he has a crush on) is bending over him. He reaches up out of the manger and grabs her breast.
-   In _Spies Like Us_, Chevy Chase's character is masquerading as a surgeon claiming that his hand has no feeling in it, hence why _he_ couldn't perform surgery.

    **Hermie:** It felt like a boob.

    **Hermie:** Why would it feel like an arm?  
    **Oscy:** Because it _was_ an arm.

-   Jack Nicholson's character does this to Michelle Pfeiffer's character in _Wolf (Mike Nichols)_ after he almost faints in front of her, weakened by the changes he's suffering. Is totally unintentional on his behalf, albeit maybe motivated by his new wolf instincts.

    Game Shows 

-   This happens to poor Alex on _Taskmaster_ during the Series 4 task "Hide from Alex". Mel Giedroyc hides in a closet and when Alex reaches in to move clothes out of the way you _immediately_ see the horror on his face when he realizes what he's grabbed.
    
    **Alex:** (Nods)
    
    **Alex:** Yeah, I found you after two and a half minutes and then felt embarrassed for three days. I didn't feel Lolly's boobs though, just for the record.

-   Terry Pratchett really likes this one, as it happens a couple of times in Discworld:
    -   In _Carpe Jugulum_, the witch Agnes Nitt awakes after the fight with the vampyres in Escrow, to discover the villagers have taken the appropriate local precautions against her waking up as a vampire (these are many and varied around the Discworld). She complains about poppy-seeds being poured into her bra, and adds that whoever took her stocking had _better_ have been a woman.
    -   In _Hogfather_, the newly-created Oh God of Hangovers joins Susan on the horse Binky, and innocently puts his hands around her at an inappropriate height. As he's only existed for a few hours, she doesn't smack him for his ignorance, just corrects his position very firmly.

-   _The Cuckoo's Calling_: Robin and Cormoran have a Crash-Into Hello when he barrels out of his office on the run and runs right into her.

Their relationship is awkward for a while after this.

-   In the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ novel "Q-Squared" by Peter David, mischievous Trickster Trelane causes blind engineer Geordi LaForge to be instantly relocated into the shower of Counselor Deanna Troi. In his disoriented state, he slips and, as Troi put it, "naturally you grabbed onto the nearest thing for support, which happened to be my...".
-   In the second _Xanth_ novel, a female centaur offers to give Bink a ride. While she was jumping across a chasm, Bink loses his balance and would have fallen off completely if not for a desperate attempt at grabbing onto whatever he could hold — which, of course, turns out to be her (bare) breasts. She forgives him, saying that she felt him losing his balance and it obviously wasn't deliberate (adding that if it _had_ been deliberate, she'd have dropped him in the chasm).

    _\[Beat\]_  
    **Penny:** Is that my arm?  
    **Sheldon:** It doesn't feel like an arm.  
    **Penny:** Then maybe you should let it go.
    
-   _Blake's 7_. Jan Chappell (Cally) accidentally does this to Sally Knyvette (Jenna) in the episode "Orac" and has to reposition her hand. Likewise Paul Darrow (Avon) wrestling with a female guest star in "Mission to Destiny" — perhaps that's why she hits him in the groin immediately afterwards?
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Buffy turns invisible. Xander reaches out to find Buffy. His hands are at chest level. He quickly ascertains that Buffy's clothes are invisible too as he hurriedly explains to Anya.
-   In _The Drew Carey Show_, Drew accidentally does this to Mimi. His reaction is screaming in horror and dousing his hand with alcohol.

Once again, Sybil comes along just in time to see Basil's unfortunately placed hand print.

-   On _Home Improvement_, while driving his attractive female mechanic home, Tim makes a hard stop at a stoplight and reaches out to stop her from going forward, grabbing the wrong area in the process. When she asks why, he says that since he has three kids, it's basically a reflex.

    **Cuddy:** Are you screwing with me?  
    **House:** That depends on your answer.  
    (_Cuddy says everyone knows that this is going somewhere, and that they're supposed to kiss now_)  
    (_House says that they already did that and grabs her breast instead_)  
    **House:** Seemed like the logical next step.  
    **Cuddy:** Really? I'm an idiot for being surprised.

-   Naturally, this happened in _Married... with Children_. In an episode that's a parody of old fashioned "whodunit" mysteries, in the scene where the lights go out right before the murder happens, the Femme Fatale character angrily snaps, "Who touched my breasts?". Later in the episode, where Al is questioning all the suspects, he recreates the scene, and the exact same thing happen. This time it's _obvious_ who it was. (And she slaps him for it.)

A moment later the assistant screams and Sam apologizes, claiming he was "looking for a doorknob".
-   Angie Harmon does this to Sasha Alexander in the Hilarious Outtakes for the Season 1 DVD of _Rizzoli & Isles_. The ladies were making fun of the show's blatant Les Yay subtext and when they finally broke down in laughter, more laughter followed when Angie accidentally grabbed Sasha's boob while they were hugging. Of course, this did nothing to cool the show's rampant Rizzles shippers.

    -   According to Patrick Stewart, during the filming of an episode of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ he was supposed to help Gates Mcfadden's character (a.k.a. Dr. Crusher) out by pulling her out of a rock (specifically, by holding her arms). Because of certain circumstances they were in some kind of rush to do the scene, and so when the director said "Action!", Patrick, as he put it, "put both my hands on her breasts", and freaked out ("I screamed!"). However, at the end he did admit that "I'm really glad it happened".
-   _Taskmaster_: During the hide-and-seek task, Alex reaches blindly into a closet and, er, encounters Mel Giedroyc. Played for Laughs given Alex's portrayal as preternaturally bashful about any physical contact with women.
    
    **Greg**: My first question is for Alex, and that question is, did you accidentally feel Mel's boobs?  
    _(Alex is too mortified to speak, just nods miserably)_  
    **Mel**: It was a drive-by, both of them. And possibly in the Pennyfield area as well.

-   _Chrono Trigger_: Ayla does this unabashedly to Marle during Marle's Side Quest. Ayla claims that Marle isn't "ready" to have her own kids yet (of course, Ayla was comparing Marle's chest to her own, so the bar is a little high).
-   Potentially happens in _Dead In Vinland_. Angelico tries to pull Kari out of the river he's accidentally dropped her in - and accidentally picks her up around the breasts. She's pissed. He's utterly mortified and wracked by guilt (not made better by the little matter that he's a monk who took a vow of chastity, and is distressed that the Devil put the sin of lust in him).
-   Done for only fanservice purposes in an ending to _Dead or Alive 4_, since the girls are only there for fanservice anyway.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   In _Final Fantasy IX_, Chivalrous Pervert Zidane grabs Garnet's butt just after she starts to (slowly) climb a ladder, intending to follow her up.

    -   In _Tales of the Abyss_, this happened to Guy after Luke (under orders from Jade) kicked him into the girl's area of the spa (it should be noted that Guy is _very_ gynophobic). The girls were angry at first, but then realize that he was the least likely guy to grope them. Then Anise asked him who was bigger: Natalia or Tear. After he said Tear, they got angry and called him a pervert again, netting him the new title "Naughty Devil".
    -   In _Tales of Xillia 2_, Milla trips while walking on a rather treacherous path near some lava, at which point Ludger is given the choice of catching her fall or doing nothing. The former option results in the trope and earns him a punch (And some affinity), though she apologizes for it quickly. She ends up being fine in the latter option, but she gets mad at him for letting her crash into the ground instead.
-   After he wakes up but _before_ he gets a face-full of Asuka's chest for about ten seconds, Kazama does this in his ending in _Tekken 5_. Considering certain other girls got stripped in their endings, it's normal for _Tekken_.

-   In _The House in Fata Morgana_, Michel accidentally grabs one of Giselle's breasts while she was cleaning the bookcases in his manor and fell over him.

He's so distracted that he then proceeds to spend a good minute thinking about it (Mio having passed out from the fall) and when Kurugaya appears and starts talking to him about it, he actually _forgets_ to take his hand back. When Mio awakes a couple of minutes later, she is not particularly impressed by this, but admits it was her fault they ended up falling over in the first place.
    -   It happens again in Haruka´s route where Riki slips on a magazine in her room while moving some boxes and accidentally lands on Haruka, although she doesn´t really mind.
