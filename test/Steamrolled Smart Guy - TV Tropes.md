**Greg:** We're burglars!  
**Wirt:** No no, no no no! We're not... we're not! We just-we just needed to get out of the rain and we thought this place was abandoned, so...  
**Greg:** So we came here to burgle your turts!

This character is extremely logic driven. They constantly come up with safe, law-abiding approaches to every problem. Too bad they are paired with a character or characters who have their own ideas on how to do things.

Typically a supporting character in a Duo, Power Trio, Comic Trio, Ragtag Bunch of Misfits, Super Team, or other group of heroes, this character is established as the voice of reason. A Type A personality, they believe strongly in a so-called right way to do things, and every decision they make is based on a set of rules that they follow to the letter. Those rules can come from an outside source, or it can just be their own personal philosophy.

When faced with a problem, they decide on a course of action based on those rules. They then share their ideas with their friends and allies, hoping to get them on board. Unfortunately for them, for better or for worse, their plans are almost never enacted. Their dumber or more instinct-driven companions prefer a more reckless and rebellious approach. They casually blunder ahead and ignore their ideas, leaving them struggling to regain control.

When things don't go their way, this character makes sure everyone knows it. There is a lot of complaining loudly about how the situation is going from beginning to end. There is a ton of blustering, yelling, crying, and/or panicking about how nobody listens to them. These tactics are ultimately unsuccessful.

This trope is a subset of The Smart Guy, The Finicky One, and Nervous Wreck. In a Straight Man and Wise Guy duo, this character is always the Straight Man. More often than not, they are a Cloudcuckoolander's Minder to one or more characters. Often, the characters around them will tune out whatever they say or pull a Leeroy Jenkins and charge ahead before they are even finished talking. Sometimes, they have a big old case of Big Brother Instinct, and their stress comes from a genuine worry for their companions. Other times, they are only concerned with saving their own skin. If the character is a villain, this would be a variant of Surrounded by Idiots. If enough frustration mounts, it could lead to a case where The Smart One Turns Traitor on the allies that ignored them.

They often view themselves as the Only Sane Man, The Cassandra, or an Ignored Expert. However, this is often an unfounded assumption. Despite their confidence, they are often wrong, and things usually work out for the group in the end anyway (or at least often no worse than whenever they _do_ stick to their rule laden approach). By the end of the scene/chapter/episode, it usually appears to the main characters and to the audience that they overreacted.

Hilariously, it is common for the situation to work out flawlessly for everyone except them. Every other character improvises their way through the problem easily, while they struggle, making them an effective Chew Toy. It may be a case of all their rules and strategies not working well in action as on paper, their own finicky attitude complicating the approach, or just simple bad luck. More generous works may offer a compromise and show there is a time for planning and rules and simple initiative. After all, these rules often exist for a reason.

Sub-Trope of Anti-Intellectualism. Also compare with No-Respect Guy, Only Sane Man, The Complainer Is Always Wrong, and Butt-Monkey. If they're the smart guy on a Planet of Hats, then it's Klingon Scientists Get No Respect.

Has no relation to an actual version of The Smart Guy being literally run over by a steamroller.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Sooner or later, all of the other crewmembers of the Straw Hat Pirates in _One Piece_ get their turn serving this role to Luffy. Luffy himself is prone to spontaneously charging in to fight enemies or punching anyone he sees is abusing someone else and won't listen to his crewmates' advice to find some easier way. This happens particularly often with Nami and Usopp, both of whom would prefer to avoid fights, or if unavoidable, plan out as much in advance as possible, and both of whom would rather Luffy be less impulsive. One instance of this is when Nami discovers a loophole in the rules for a competition in which Luffy could win a fight with Foxy the Silver Fox by default by forcibly recruiting Foxy into his crew using the competition's rules, but all other people present, including the other Straw Hat Pirates, accuse her of being a bad sport and violating a taboo of this competition.

    Board Games 

-   The video sequences from _Trivial Pursuit DVD For Kids_ features a character named Lewis, who serves as a 'game show host' for the players watching. He constantly tries to maintain an air of professionalism when presenting. But to his chagrin, his three co-hosts, Mitch, Brad, and Bobby, are too dumb, vain, and immature respectively to follow his example.

    Comic Books 

-   In IDW Comics' _Transformers_ 2005 comics continuity, Prowl is a deconstructed example of this. A cold, logical, and largely asocial 'bot in a faction led mostly by daredevil mavericks who value strength of personality as much as (if not more so than) tactical acumen, Prowl finds himself growing increasingly frustrated with Autobot command's refusal to just _listen to him_ and do things that would end the war faster and with fewer casualties (at least in the long term). This frustration, combined with a somewhat-shaky moral compass and a firm belief that the ends justify the means, causes Prowl to take increasingly extreme and unethical actions behind the other Autobots' backs in order to win the war _his_ way. By the end of the comic's run, nearly every one of these actions has backfired on him horribly in one way or another.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _The Lion King (1994)_, Zazu tries to teach a young Simba about the responsibilities of being a king. Simba is completely disinterested in these lessons. Zazu shows his frustration with birdlike screeches and squawks as he tries to keep Simba's attention.
-   In _The Little Mermaid (1989)_, King Triton assigns Sebastian to keep watch over Ariel. However, Sebastian is repeatedly unable to keep Ariel from sneaking off to visit humans.
-   Marlin from _Finding Nemo_ is rule and safety oriented to a fault. While traveling with Dory to rescue his son Nemo, he constantly worries about the various dangers the ocean poses. Typically, Dory either doesn’t understand his instructions, forgets them, or decides that she knows a better path.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   C-3PO from _Star Wars_ frequently makes confident proclamations about how one course of action is foolhardy and fraught with risk, which characters like R2-D2 and Han Solo then ignore. It is especially prevalent in the opening of Episode IV, when he argues with R2 in the desert over where to go and the legitimacy of his "mission" to find Obi-Wan Kenobi.
-   In _Bringing Up Baby_, David Huxley is a meticulously organized museum curator who has plans to secure a huge donation. When Susan Vance comes into his life, however, he falls into a whirlwind adventure despite his constant protests.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Josh from _Drake & Josh_ usually disagrees with Drake on which course of action to take. Josh presents the responsible and mature solution, which Drake then usually ignores, despite Josh's protests.
-   Chidi from _The Good Place_ overthinks every decision. Whenever he suggests a logical course of action, Eleanor or Jason act impulsively instead, leaving Chidi with a stomachache.
-   _The Cry of Mann_ and the sequel, _The Call of Warr_:
    -   Berry takes on the role of trying to keep her family from falling apart _and_ keeping the business from going under. Unfortunately for her, her quirky brothers slowly undergo Sanity Slippage, and nobody will ever listen to anything she says, whether it's trying to keep Jouglat and Courtney respectful at Jack's art show, or getting Jack to stop ruining Jouglat's funeral. She gets increasingly frustrated as time goes on and undergoes Sanity Slippage of her own because of it, eventually loudly complaining that nobody listens to her and threatening to hurt people if they don't.
    -   In _Warr_, Prince is a very by-the-book soldier who follows the rules very strictly. When the rules call for the execution of Prisoner Sarah, he relentlessly tries to get Gravesite to go along with it, to no avail. As the series goes on, he gets more and more frustrated with Gravesite's lack of action and eventual disinterest in his leadership, and is constantly begging to just kill Prisoner Sarah. Of course, everyone else finds his attitude grating and don't trust him with any actual authority, for good reason, as when he gets it he attempts to kill multiple people.
-   This is one of Sheldon's recurring fates on _The Big Bang Theory._ He often comes up with extremely convoluted plans and schemes to solve problems, much to the chagrin and eventual dismissal of the rest of the group. It's a combination of his being an Insufferable Genius who thinks he's smarter than everyone and lords his intellect over others, having No Social Skills so he can't deal with impromptu events, and his total inability to lie and subsequent need for an elaborate cover story before telling even a small fib.
-   In _Kamen Rider Gaim_, Mitsuzane is the team tactician and usually comes up with plans for whatever he and his friends are facing. However, while his friends do respect him and his skills, his plans tend to be coldly pragmatic; and in the heat of the moment they tend to abandon the strategy in order to step in and help people right now. The fact that Kouta does this all the time and gets _praised_ for his heroism eventually turns Mitsuzane into a Green-Eyed Monster, and he deludes himself that he needs to kill Kouta so that his world-saving plans can actually _work_ before Kouta's recklessness dooms everybody. Not that his plans were likely to work anyway, as Mitsuzane overestimates his intelligence; he considers himself The Chessmaster but doesn't realize that his "pawns" are the show's _real_ Chessmasters leading him on.

    **Dennis:** This calls for a classic flanking maneuver! We'll surround {Kat} in—  
    **Coop:** _\[charges off with a rake in hand\]_ KAAAAAT!  
    **Dennis:** _\[exasperated\]_ Or we can try a reckless frontal assault, as usual.
