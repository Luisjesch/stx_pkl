How confusing...

A guileful hero can often avoid unnecessary fighting by disguising himself as a Trojan Prisoner, walking into an enemy base and planting explosives, rescuing the princess and laughing on the way home as the base blows up. See also The Mole.

However, some enemies can't be fooled by first rate acting and good costuming. Some, like zombies, virus infected or robots, can instantly tell others of their kind on sight, smell, sound, taste, touch, Aura, or WiFi. Anyone attempting to traipse by through a throng of them will quickly be found out and eaten. There is one catch to this "foolproof", friend-or-foe recognition though. Basically, it assumes _everyone_ who is one of their kind has the same agenda and interests, and when you go about infecting, robotizing, or metamorphosizing normal humans to your side, at least one of them is going to slip through the cracks, avoid or reject the Hive Queen's influence, and refuse to sell out humanity and become a Pro-Human Transhuman.

These Sheep In Wolf's Clothing use their early stage zombification/monsterhood to slip by enemy hordes and help their still-human allies however they can. This is usually a Heroic Sacrifice for a number of reasons: firstly, these Doomed Protagonists know the change is irreversible, and he or she will either die outright from the infection or suffer Loss of Identity once it finishes. Some heroes may infect themselves voluntarily to avoid detection, especially if the enemy is so well defended that only a suicide mission can end their threat.

If he succeeds, the hero can have one of three ultimate fates: become a monster and die (hopefully after succeeding in his mission), become a monster and live (which usually leads to What Have I Become?, but might not be so bad) or become human again thanks to a miracle antidote or No Ontological Inertia on the transformation.

Surprisingly not connected to A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, but related to Faustian Rebellion. Compare Personality Remnant, which doesn't need to have a tactical advantage.

-   The titular Kabaneri of _Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress_ have somehow stopped the infection process of regular Kabane (aggressive zombies with steel-hard bones) retaining their intellect and humanity but gaining enormous strength, reflexes and resilience. Unfortunately, it also causes them to hunger for blood, and if they go too long without drinking blood, start trying to feed on the closest humans.

    -   Ripley in _Alien³_ survived a Xenomorph attack thanks to having a Xenomorph embryo inside her. She later uses this to her advantage when confronting it later.

-   _Terminator Salvation_ has an interesting case. Though he is always a cyborg, Marcus was attacked by all Skynet robots when he believed he was "human." But after being outed in the resistance base he manages to infiltrate Skynet central in San Francisco because, thanks to this realization, the machines registered him as "Active".
    -   It also helps that he'd since taken enough damage to reveal his robotic endoskeleton.

    Literature

-   In _Mistborn_, Marsh impresses the Inquisitors so much that they turn him into one of them, not bothering to investigate his false background. They also warn him about their primary weakness (removing one spike on their backs will kill them), and he kills them all in their sleep.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In episode 5 of _Supernatural_'s sixth season, Dean gets turned by a vampire seeking "pretty boy" recruiters for its army. He manages to use this to his advantage in infiltrating the nest. This is less Heroic Sacrifice and more What the Hell, Hero?, as afterward Dean realizes that his brother Sam _let him get turned_ just for this purpose, because Sam Came Back Wrong a year ago and is currently a Soulless Shell. Mind you, he had an antidote back at base that he was like eighty percent sure would work so long as Dean didn't bite anyone. Not that he told Dean. Sam is kind of a dick without his soul.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_: In the two-parter "Unimatrix Zero", three of the _Voyager_ crew members try to infiltrate a Borg cube by trying a standard attack and getting assimilated, which turns out to be what they actually wanted as they're using an inhibitor to prevent being taken over by the Hive Mind while sabotaging the Borg. In the series finale, Admiral Janeway from the future intentionally lets herself be assimilated in order to spread a Borg-destroying pathogen throughout the Hub in the present.
-   In an episode of the first season of _Angel_ the titular character used his condition as a vampire to infiltrate the demon supremacist army, the Scourge. The Scourge at first despised him due to the human origin of vampires, but he convinced them that he loathed that aspect of himself and wished nothing more than to see humanity wiped out.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Adversary in _Forgotten Realms_ is a figure of dread in illithid myth. The legend holds that a larva that undergoes ceremorphosis will take on all of the host's personality and memory. This "Adversary" would still be the host, but with all the powers of an illithid. Illithids that inherited little quirks from their hosts hide them so they are not mistaken by their peers for being the Adversary. The Adversary is no mere myth. A scholar found a way to interfere with ceremorphosis and retained his mind and soul despite becoming an illithid. He acts as a mole within illithid society, doing what he can to be as subversive as possible. Such as spreading the legend of the "Adversary".
