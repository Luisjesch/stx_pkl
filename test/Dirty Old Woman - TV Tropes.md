_"How silly of me! I should have tied you to my bed."_

THIS is one lady that menopause didn't totally turn off.

The Distaff Counterpart to the Dirty Old Man. Although the occasional swat or pinch on the bottom is not out of the question for the Dirty Old Woman, it's uncommon for her to grope or otherwise make lewd contact in the way that her male counterpart would. Instead, she'll do things like make Double Entendre\-laden references to an "adventurous" past. In some cases, such a character will be played by a guy in drag. This is also a popular characterisation of a brothel's madame.

This character is almost always Played for Laughs, often as an Abhorrent Admirer of some sort. When they show up in a Darker and Edgier show, which is rare, they're often used to show the unfortunate fate of women who let their sex drives lead their lives or, inversely, the result of too much prudishness.

Compare with Mrs. Robinson who is younger, prettier and still sexually active and doesn't have much problem seducing a younger guy.

    Advertising 

-   This Sprite commercial. (NSFW) Watch if you dare... After that, in Communist Poland, Brain Bleach will need YOU!!
-   The Agent Provocateur ad, with Kylie on a mechanical bull, GIVING A REALLY OLD WOMAN A LAPDANCE. The old woman is...worryingly into it, and then when Kylie says "If there are any men in the audience, can they please stand up?" the old woman cackles, saying "I THOUGHT SO!"

    Anime & Manga 

-   Otome's grandmother in _Cherry Juice_ would qualify for some simply for being committed to getting Otome and her step-brother together romantically. She cements her status in one scene where she and Otome are trying to listen through Minami's door after he brought home a girl from school, expecting that something racy was going on. When Otome leaned on the door too hard and fell into the room, Granny was standing at the ready with her camera in hand.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_ has Dante, but it’s not Played for Laughs in the slightest. Dante, who has been using Philosopher’s Stones to switch bodies with far younger women, tries to get it on with Ed just to one-up his father and her former lover Hohenheim. Considering her body is rotting due to Possession Burnout and she plans to possess Rose to accomplish this, it’s not sexy in the slightest.

**Dante: I want to be loved by the son of Honenheim…**

-   Dama from _Haré+Guu_ is a ridiculous example of this.
-   In the film adaptation of _Howl's Moving Castle_, the Witch of the Waste is this. Young men are so cute, indeed.
-   The Stripping Hag from _Hozuki's Coolheadedness_ not only likes young men, she also promotes her own photo collection. **Nude one**.
-   Iono from _Iono the Fanatics_ isn't actually that old, but fits this trope to a T, other than the fact that the objects of her affection are girls.
-   In _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_, Joseph accidentally peeps into a bathroom stall on a woman like this, who instantly becomes obsessed with him and tries to seduce him. Hilarity Ensues.
    -   "**OH MY GOOOOOD!!!**"
-   Shizuku in _New Game!_ is a slightly younger than usual example; but she is still the oldest lady of the principle cast who openly lusts after her younger co-workers, often **right in front of them**.
-   Rose from Nebraska to a small degree. She has no trouble talking about her torrid past, calling her husband's dead sister a whore, or flashing an old boyfriends tombstone.
-   Sumire Ryuzaki from _The Prince of Tennis_ is often portrayed like this in doujinshi. The Beach Episode OAV also toys with the idea, for a mix of squick and laughs. (Though to be fair, she _was_ pretty when young, and otherwise is an excellent and well-respected Team Mom and Stern Teacher).
-   _Ranma ½_ anime, Dr. Tofu's mother gropes most buttocks of his son's potential brides to check if they have strong-enough bones that are worthy of her family's name.
-   Charlotte B. Lord, the school principal in _Unlimited Fafnir_ is one. Made much more hilarious because she resembles a ten year old girl. But she has no qualms about telling Yuu, the main hero, to go peeking at the girls with her while they're having a physical exam. She is usually kept in check by her assistant Micah.

    Architecture 

-   The Sheela-Na-Gig is probably another early example of this. PJ Harvey later wrote a song about it on _Dry_.

    Comedy 

-   Cloris Leachman makes this part of her act. This was exemplified in the Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget - "I am not here to roast Bob Saget. I am here to fuck John Stamos!" She wound up getting a full-on kiss from him.
    -   Her bit as a whole fell under this as well, since she got her start from the bottom, doing nothing but improv - "Just me and the donkey."
-   Stand-up comic Grandma Lee's act revolves around this, as seen on _America's Got Talent_. She made several lewd advances at the male judges as part of her routine.
-   A lot of dirty-old-woman routines owe a great deal to Jackie "Moms" Mabley.
-   Jo Brand. It's particularly obvious if you watch _QI_, since she's frequently the one making the most dirty jokes.

    Comic Books 

-   White-Dwarf Starlet cum Cool Old Lady Danke Scoen in _Lori Lovecraft_. She makes no secret of her fondness for handsome young studs, and one of her first remarks to Lori is to ask her what her boyfriend Allen is like in bed.
-   Mystique is a definitely not-Played for Laughs case as she frequently shows depraved sexual interest in characters far, far younger than herself such as X-23. In _Worst X-Man Ever_ she forcefully kisses the protagonist Bailey who’s underage, making it a case of sexual assault upon a minor.
-   Granny Goodness, Darkseid’s minion Depending on the Writer is either: the squick variation of this when she gets clear sexual pleasure out of torturing and fighting people while coming up with pet names for them like an actual grandma (she called Harley her “little lamb love dove chestnut of my heart”), or the softer variation of just lightly hitting men like Scott who are physically young enough to be her grandsons though the latter can still be seen as creepy given how vile she is the rest of the time. Her relationship with her Furies whom she raised and gave Training from Hell is also often _way too_ close for comfort.

    Comic Strips 

    Fanfiction 

-   This _Wolf's Rain_ fic portrays Toboe's grandmother as this towards Kiba. Needless to say, Kiba is far from amused.
-   In _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, Blaine installed anti-peeping measures on _both_ sides of the hot springs of the Big Riddle Inn. According to his granddaughter, he did so because it was an old woman who tried to sneak in a screwdriver to peep on the other side.
-   _A Rabbit Among Wolves_: This is brutally deconstructed with Elizabeth Tanner, the owner of the SDC Lumber Yard Jaune infiltrates. Her actions-forcing herself on Faunus employees and using the Fantastic Racism of the setting to get away with it-is as horrific as possible, and Jaune is deeply hurt after falling victim to her advances.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Cars_: Lizzie is an old Ford Model T who slaps stickers onto the rear bumpers of unsuspecting male cars, refers to Lightning McQueen as a "sexy hot rod," and at one point is quite obviously enjoying the show of watching McQueen toil as he's repairing Radiator Springs' main street.
-   In _Mulan_, Mulan's grandmother, who's a jokester and snarker in general, also has shades of this. When she first sees Shang, she yells "Sign me up for the next war!"

    Films — Live Action 

-   _Bananas_: An old woman (who had been threatened by two thugs) reads Mellish's discarded copy of porno mag Orgasm with a huge smile.
-   Rose Delvecchio in _Desert Heat_ enjoys peeping on threesomes through windows, shooting liquor straight from the bottle, and praising the lord.
-   There is, of course, the Professor's elderly grandmother in the Eddie Murphy remake of _The Nutty Professor_, who goes into anecdotes about her uhhh... _past_, over dinner. And then there's _that one scene_ in the sequel...
-   The old lady that Jack fondles in the London carriage in _Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides_. "Is that it?"
-   Max Bialystock's nameless "client" (credited as "Hold Me-Touch Me") in the opening scene of the original version of _The Producers_. Estelle Winwood, the actress who played her, was later quite vocal in stating her displeasure with the role and the movie.
-   In _Yes-Man_, there's an old woman in the protagonist's apartment complex who seduces attractive men by asking them to fix something at her house. Despite her appearance, she apparently gives very good head.
-   All of Mae West's roles in her later films.

    Jokes 

-   It seems that three old ladies were standing at a bus stop when along came a flasher and opened his raincoat. Well, the first old lady had a stroke. The second old lady had a stroke. The third old lady tried to have a stroke but her arms were too short.
-   A college student was low on cash, and saw no other way than resorting to prostitution to make a quick buck. He advertized his services in a newspaper, saying 1 go with him on the bed costs $100 , 1 go on the couch would cost $50, and 1 go on the floor costs $25 . An elderly and lonely lady saw the advert, and went to the student's home with 100 $. The young man asked her "So, it will be one go on the bed?" The old lady replied with a snicker: "Not at all, handsome, make it 4 steamy times on the floor!"
-   A man is walking through the forest when he encounters a crone. "Oh, my", says the crone, "I guess you're gonna ravish me now, sonny?" "Wasn't dreaming to, granma", answers the man, "have no fear." "Don't reckon you've got much of a choice, sonny." says the crone, leveling her double-barreled shotgun on him.
-   Did you hear about the two old ladies who went for a tramp in the woods? He ran away.
-   Two older ladies go to the greengrocer and ask for two green bananas.
    
    "Sorry, ladies, I can only sell them in bunches. But I do have one with only three bananas on it."  
    The ladies look at each other, one shrugs and says "Well, I suppose we can always eat the third one."
    

    Literature 

-   The old woman in Voltaire's _Candide_ fits this pretty well, somewhat more so in the musical than the novel.
-   The ur-example in English is probably the Wife of Bath from _The Canterbury Tales_, who is five times married. It is a bit hard to tell her exact age, though, as her first marriage was at 12 or so. Potentially, she might be more like some of Mae West's characters who lean in the Mrs. Robinson direction. We do know that she was twice the age of her last husband — but it's possible he was in his teens and she was in her thirties.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Nanny Ogg is a perfect example of this and arguably has some inspiration from the Wife of Bath. Her favorite conversational topic is the "single entendre."
    -   Topsy Lavish from _Making Money_ is practically Nanny Ogg on crutches. She tries to reassure Moist "I don't bite," but Moist can tell by the look in her eye that if one is into that kind of thing, just let her know and give her a few minutes to put her dentures in...
-   Iris Wildthyme in the _Doctor Who Expanded Universe_, although whether she physically matches the description depends on the incarnation. The Beryl Reid incarnation certainly fits the bill, the Barbarella and Shirley Bassey ones not so much, and the Katy Manning Iris is more of a Mrs. Robinson.
-   The titular character in Roald Dahl's _The Landlady_ is heavily implied to be this. The bad kind. Poor, poor hapless Billy Weaver.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: The _The Hutt Gambit_ has a grotesquely funny scene of a young Han Solo being leered at by an elderly Twi'lek bag lady when he and Chewbacca first arrive on the "Smugglers' Moon" of Nar Shaddaa. Apparently, Han was sickened more by the woman's advanced age than by the fact that she was a head-tentacled alien, since Humans and Twi'leks can successfully interbreed in the _Star Wars_ universe.
-   Grandma Mazur in the _Stephanie Plum_ books. When a man exposes himself to Stephanie and Grandma Mazur, Grandma offers to try touching the rather excited man. He _wilts_.
-   Queen Tatiana from _Vampire Academy_, is in her sixties and has maintained relationships with men forty years younger than her.
-   _Dark Shores_: Teriana's aunt Yedda is an elderly sailor who likes watching young legionnaires exercising on board of her ship and making them uncomfortable by whistling at them. Teriana is appalled.
-   _Always Coming Home_ mentions Marigold, who used to dance the Moon (an annual orgy festival) almost until her death, usually picking some young boy afraid to approach a woman he actually liked.

    Live-Action TV 

### **In General:**

-   British comedies seem to love the concept of the rapacious landlady.
    -   In _Gimme, Gimme, Gimme_ there is Beryl, a retired prostitute who never misses a chance to be crude.
    -   _Spaced_ has Marsha, a raddled alcoholic who has an arrangement with one of her tenants.

### **By Series:**

-   Betty the Auld Slapper in the Scottish sketch show _Chewin' the Fat_. Usually seen relating her experiences of wartime life to a local historian, who was hoping for more about coping with rationing and the Blitz, and less about sleeping with G.I.s. She also has a tattoo that reads "I love Willie".
    
    **Care worker**: Who's Willie?  
    **Betty**: Anybody's willie.
    
-   _Doctor Who_: The bus full of old people in "The End of Time". Minnie "The Menace" Hooper in particular; she even gropes the Doctor.
    -   Lady Cassandra counts, considering she enjoys feeling herself when she possesses The Doctor and Rose.

-   _'Allo 'Allo!_ has its fair share of perverts and the female characters are no exception. Madame Fanny la Fan is often known to make randy comments and on one occasion, when her daughter pulls up her bedsheets to prevent her from watching the British Airmen undressing, she pushes her out of the way with her cane to get a clearer view.
-   _Family Matters_: Elderly Mama Winslow takes daughter-in-law Harriet and Harriet's sister Rachel to a Chippendales-like establishment, and is greeted cheerfully by several of the waiters and dancers, indicating that she's a regular customer.
-   _Frasier_: As part of her community service, Roz works at a retirement home where she bonds with an elderly woman who reveals she hacked the computer system so she'll get sponge baths from a young and attractive male nurse. When the guy shows up for her next bath the woman shoos Roz out of the room so she can have him to herself.
-   _Friends_: While clearing out the closet in Monica's spare bedroom Chandler finds a pair of black, fluffy handcuffs and, eventually, pictures of them being used by Monica's grandmother (the original occupant of the apartment). On seeing the pictures Monica loudly declares that "Nana liked it _rough_!"
-   An episode of _Full House_ had a trio of old ladies gawking and leering at a pants-less Danny.
-   The comedy sketch show _Harry Enfield and Chums_ featured a pair of characters officially named "The Lovely Wobbly Randy Old Ladies". Catchphrase: "Young man! At our age!", said in response to anything that can even vaguely be considered a Double Entendre. They are even shown ravishing the men on a few occasions - and working for a sex line. All played for laughs, naturally.
-   In the TV series of _Game of Thrones_, Olenna Tyrell seems to enjoy giving this image, best exemplified by this conversation with Varys (who by the way is a eunuch). She is also very fond of reminiscing about her seductive days.
    
    **Olenna**: Are you here to seduce me?  
    **Varys**: A little obvious perhaps...  
    **Olenna**: Oh no **please**, seduce away! It's been _so_ long. But I rather think it's all for naught; what happens when the non-existent bumps against the decrepit _(Varys looks down at his groin and up again in shock)_... a question for the philosophers.
    
-   None of the leads on _The Golden Girls_ are averse to talking about their sex lives (or, with the exception of Sophie, having sex), though Blanche Devereaux takes the part further than anyone else.
-   One episode of _House_ involves an old lady who hit on House throughout the episode. Another involves a couple of ostensibly Dirty Old People, although the both of them later came back individually to ask House to do something about the other's libido.
-   An episode of _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_ had the detectives investigating the rape and murder of an elderly woman who turned out to have had _several_ lovers—one of whom was only 20-something—thus revealing her to be this.
-   The _Legends of the Superheroes_ special "The Roast" has Captain Marvel's enemy Aunt Minerva accompanied by shirtless, muscular men as well as attempting to get one of the male superheroes to be her husband. She picks Captain Marvel (apparently unaware that his true form Billy Batson is just a boy), but all she gets from him is a kiss that enables her to take on a more youthful form after saying "Shazam".
-   Agnes Brown the titular Mrs. Brown of _Mrs. Brown's Boys_ is one, and is played by series creator Brendan O'Carroll in drag; her best friend Winnie McGoogan is one as well, though she's played by O'Carroll's real life sister.
-   Paula Deen, or at least her television persona, often embodies this, especially on _Paula's Party_. She even flirted with Clay Aiken _after_ he was out of the closet. And then there's the time she rode Robert Irvine like a horse...
-   In _Saved by the Bell_, a lot of older women went to the beach to check out A.C. Slater work as a lifeguard.
-   In the _Smallville_ episode "Crusade", both Lois Lane and an old woman enjoy the view of a naked Clark Kent.
-   In _Supernatural_, Gertrude Case spent her whole debut flirting with and groping Sam Winchester while the Winchester brothers were attempting to steal an artifact from the Pine Seas Maritime Museum.
-   _Thanks_: Grammy gets excited when she talks about women being raped by pirates. Later, she refuses to marry Burnaby without first finding out how good he is in bed.
-   _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_"
    -   This was one of the "Weird Newscasters". The (female) improviser said, "You make me feel like a nubile teen," to which Colin replied, "You're..._you're kidding yourself._"
    -   In one of the 'Party Quirks' games, Wayne Brady's role was 'determined little old lady who likes tight butts'.
-   In _Waiting for God_, Diana explains that this trope is a symptom of women living longer than men, that when you have passed sixty five men are a rare commodity and if you touch hers then that is the only way you will perceive him for the rest of your life, does she make herself clear?

    Music 

-   This parody of Katy Perry's "I Kissed A Girl."
-   "Grandma Got a Facebook".
-   At least some versions of "Does Your Chewing Gum Lose It's Flavour on the Bedpost Overnight?" by Lonnie Donegan:
    
    One night old Granny Stead  
    Stuck gum around her bed.  
    Plastic rollers,  
    All that chewing without molars.  
    A prowler in the night.  
    Got stuck on gran's bed, right?  
    Ol' granny leapt up in the air  
    Shouted out Tonight's the night!!
    
-   Deine Lakaien's _Cupid Disease_ is about that:
    
    do you know your age  
    what an extravagance  
    you are nearing the end  
    am i feeling too well  
    yes you have to be ill  
    nobody loves you  
    nobody loves you  
    nobody loves you when you are old  
    and hot  
    

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The late Mae Young in the WWE, who died at the age of 90, made regular attempts to expose her breasts (and succeeded at the 2000 _Royal Rumble_), made out with any male wrestler she can get her hands on and even gave birth to a HAND she conceived with Mark Henry, which eventually led to one of the most shocking Brick Jokes in WWE history. It was a pretty sad and even unfair presentation, since Young had been reasonably attractive when she started wrestling in her teens in the 1930s. Not surprisingly however since WWE gave their Fabulous Moolah, their first women's champion, the same gimmick (though not to the extremes taken with Young)

    Theatre 

-   Aristophanes sometimes used such characters, such as in one notable instance where women take over the government of Athens and institute a rule that a young man must sleep with an older woman in order to be married, and thus a young male character is chased around by a crone. As Aristophanes lived in Ancient Greece, this makes it Older Than Feudalism.
-   Gilbert and Sullivan, inspired by the dame figure of pantomime which is played by a man, frequently featured repulsive older women chasing after young male characters.
-   William Shakespeare's _Romeo and Juliet_ tends to present Juliet's nurse this way, potentially inspired by the Wife of Bath. However, the text's references to her biography, particularly the fact that she was a wet nurse for the 14-year-old Juliet, establish her as actually in her mid-30s. Thus, she was almost certainly intended as a "saucy maid" stock character rather than a crone.
-   In Stephen Sondheim's _Sweeney Todd_ (the musical, not the movie), the character of the Old Beggar Woman is an especially dirty example, though she is most likely not doing it because of sexual attraction, but because she figures out that being a hooker probably earns her more money than simply begging. She has such memorable lines as
    
    _"Hey boy, sailor boy,  
    Want it snuggly harboured?  
    Open me gate, but dock it straight,  
    I see it lists to starboard!_
    
-   Berthe from the musical _Pippin_.
-   Brenda from _Road_.

    Video Games 

-   Wendy Oldbag of _Ace Attorney_ is an elderly woman who has the hots for Miles Edgeworth, Jack Hammer, and Juan Corrida, all men in their 20s or 30s.
-   Sharma Salsa, the \*ahem\* amateur film producer who gives Ajay all the racing sidequests in _Far Cry 4_. She thinks he's very attractive and lets him know about it with some very suggestive gestures, despite the fact she's probably old enough to be his mom. Also, it's all but outright stated that she's a former porn star. What? You're honestly naive enough to believe Sharma Salsa is her birth name?
-   Pipra from _Infinite Space_, who constantly mentions to Yuri about "paying with his body". A bartender even notes this in one of the jobs.
-   In _Love & Pies_, Amelia's great-aunt Esme is too "interested" in her and Joe's first date and assumes that the birds and the bees happened between them. Amelia reprimands her for wanting the dirty details right in front of her kid daughter Kate, when the date itself was actually innocent. When Joe tells Esme that he wore nothing to the date, she immediately assumes that he and Amelia had "the birds and bees" going on when Joe meant that he wore "nothing _important_", meaning that he didn't dress fancy for the date.
    
    Esme also thinks that Edwina is "intelligent, successful, and pretty sexy" when she finds out that the latter once dated Joe, who's much younger than her since she's around Amelia's mother's age, to Amelia's disgust.
    
-   As per the page quote, Nurse Edna from _Maniac Mansion_. Not only does she deliver the quoted line when capturing one of the boys (and "You're lucky you aren't a boy" to the girls), but she also responds to an apparent prank phone call with "There's no heavy breathing. Let me show you how to do it." This behavior persists in _Day of the Tentacle_, where she's an Abhorrent Admirer to the college-aged Bernard.
-   Matriarch Aethyta from _Mass Effect 2_, the bartender on Illium. Especially when she says "Sorry, no sex; just cleaned the bar!"
    -   And in the third game has several gems where, among other things, she uses the phrase "useful as tits on a Hanar" and mentions that she's had at least one daughter with one, and her starry eyed reminiscing about Benezia's amazing rack, complete with a Wolf Whistle. And when she makes Liara's infatuation with Shepard (which may or may not be reciprocated), sound "tawdry" in Liara's words, she says that if you're doing it all civilized then you're not doing it right.
    -   Samara is a downplayed example, but she freely admits that she's had lots of carefree sex before her days as a Justicar. If Shepard asks about a romance with her, she turns him/her down, but is flattered by the idea and thinks about it.
-   In the Delta episode of _Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire,_ Zinnia's grandmother tells the player that she sees Steven as a "silver haired dreamboat" despite Steven being in his _mid 20s._
-   In _Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic_, some of Kreia's dialogue is downright filthy by the standards of the GFFA, especially if you're playing a male.
-   _Wolfenstein: The New Order_ and prequel _The Old Blood_ both have a Nazi character who crosses this with The Baroness. _The New Order_ has Frau Engel, who is a concentration camp warden with a much younger, meeker and submissive male lover she dotes on. _The Old Blood_ has Helga von Schrabbs, who gets very flirtatious with the player character at one point, and who is also an incredibly foul-mouthed raging Lady Drunk.

    Webcomics 

-   _Digger_ has Boneclaw Mother, the elder leader of the local tribe of hyenas. She's a fan-favorite character because of this trope, and her general irreverence for her tribe's traditions. "I'm not getting any younger here!"
    
    **Boneclaw Mother:** Shadebones here has this _one_ nephew, and _Hare's Ghost_, if I were thirty years younger...  
    **Shadebones:** You're _blind_. You can't even see him.  
    **Boneclaw Mother:** He _smells_ adorable.  
    **Shadebones:** You're a vile old woman.
    
-   From _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_, we have Kria Soulstealer, and the defense offers these as evidence.
-   _Girl Genius_: When Tarvek, disguised as a servant, makes a joke about his grandmother whipping him for impertinance, she cheerfully states that he sounds "just like his grandfather" making Tarvek wish for Brain Bleach. Simon Voltaire calls her a "scheming flirt" as an Insult of Endearment, implying she's always been like this.
-   _Something\*Positive_ has this little gem.
-   Hazel's former neighbor in _Girls with Slingshots_ apparently has BDSM-themed Christmas parties with strippers.

    Web Original 

-   The character "Granny\_Bacon" fulfilled this role in _Shadow of Israphel_, having a crush on Simon Lane's Honeydew alter-ego and sleeping with him off panel. During her funeral, Father Braeburn mentions that in her last confession she admitted to sleeping with Honeydew constantly.
-   Hoops and Dumbbell's neighbour fits the bill, asking without a hint of shame if it's true what they say about a Pegasus' wingspan. Then giddily congratulating Dumbbell when he suggests that yes, it is.
-   In _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_, the Queen of England is said to have been in a relationship with Alucard back in World War II, which she immediately confirms upon seeing Alucard again after almost 70 years. And then she starts filrting with him, right in the presence of Integra, Maxwell, and Sir Penwood.
    
    **Queen:** _(with Alucard kneeling before her)_ Well, well, well. If it isn't Allie. Your skin is still as smooth as the day I felt it on my own.  
    **Alucard:** You know it. Reminds me of when I'd keep your bed warm during the Blitz.  
    **Queen:** Those were better days. I was younger, beautiful...  
    **Alucard:** Ah, shut up you old hag, I'd still wreck you like Diana.  
    **Queen:** _(soft laughter)_ Oh, you know _exactly_ what to say to moisten me up.  
    **Sir Penwood:** _(offscreen)_ ARGH! I CAN NEVER HAVE SEX AGAIN!
    
-   Lunch Lady Belinda from _The Most Popular Girls in School_; think Wendy Oldbag from the above example, but a bit younger, way cruder, and bisexual.
-   _Dream Machine_: Priscilla De Marco in 1.03. _Change or Die_. She hits on Ryan rather aggressively, though he’s still struggling with his shift to appealing mostly to the older generation.
-   Lucahjin isn't quite Grandma age yet, but she is in her 40s. She also looks like she's in her 20s and has the sense of humor of a 13-year-old boy. She _loves_ to take completely innocent situations and dialogue in games and twist them into being raunchy, is rather shameless in using nameable characters to invoke Video Game Perversity Potential (such as naming any horses she has "My Balls"), will often give characters who _aren't_ nameable crude nicknames anyway, and is definitely not afraid to admit when she thinks a character is hot (which, due to the vast majority of video game characters being idealized and Lucah being pansexual, happens quite often).
-   This Tumblr user describes helping a 70+ lady at Gamestop who'd played through _The Witcher 3_ to 100% completion, despite hating the mechanics, solely because she was attracted to Geralt and now wanted something else with a hot male lead. The submitter suggested _Uncharted_.

    Western Animation 

-   Gorgeous Gal in the Woody Woodpecker cartoon _A Fine Feathered Frenzy_. She takes out an ad in the paper saying she is beautiful, rich, has plenty of food and desires to meet and marry a young man. She even includes the pocket change needed to call her in the ad. Gorgeous Gal seduces Woody with her sexy voice on the phone and assures him she loves woodpeckers. So he agrees to come over and plans to marry her. Unfortunately it turns out she's an overweight and elderly anthropomorphic bird. Finding Woody cute, Gorgeous Gal kisses him repeatedly and flirts with him nonstop while he flees in terror. She still forces him to marry her and takes him on their honeymoon on the same day since she couldn't wait to make love to him.
-   The "World's Oldest Woman" of _Histeria!_ has frequently flirted with younger men.
-   Grandma Butternut From the Canadian cartoon _Numb Chucks_.
-   The grandma in Tex Avery's _Red Hot Riding Hood_, pursuing poor Wolfie when he's clearly not interested. What do you expect? She runs a brothel! She locks him in her apartment and chases him with puckered lips. The same thing happens to the Wolf in "Swing Shift Cinderella" with an elderly Fairy Godmother that tries to jump his bones. The Wolf does kiss her on the lips once by mistake, only intensifying her lust.
-   Ms. Buttloaves from _The Ren & Stimpy Show_, Ren is usually the object of her desire.
-   Granny from _Squidbillies_. She built a monster out of human corpses to keep as a friend with benefits, and forged an ancient love letter and faked a coma to try and sleep with the ghost of Robert E. Lee.
-   In _Robot Chicken_, the grandmother from _Little Red Riding Hood_ is reimagined as this. Apparently, Little Red was a _prostitute_ that she ordered. When the Big Bad Wolf shows up instead, she assumes he's the prostitute and forces herself on him.
-   _The Venture Brothers_ in the episode "Guess who's coming to State Dinner" Mrs. Manstrong is an example of this.
-   Dolores-Day Crocker, the mother of Denzel Crocker from _The Fairly OddParents!_. She's single and often flirty and aggressive towards some of the male characters she tries to date.

-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_: In "World Wide Wabbit", Mac tells Eduardo that if Mr. Herriman finds people in their Funny Bunny Merchandise, based on a video of him dancing, he will explode. He runs down the hall, yelling 'Take Off Your Clothes' The elder Madame Foster unquestionably obeys, jumping on the stairs, waving her shirt.
-   _Rocko's Modern Life_: Bev Bighead is frequently portrayed as one, especially in the first season (doesn't help that she's married). "Canned" shows that she calls sex hotlines, an entire episode ("Leap Frogs") revolves around her trying to seduce Rocko, and when Heffer threw a nudist party in "Bedfellows" (the sister episode to "Leap Frogs", no less), she eagerly watches them when Ed points it out to her.
