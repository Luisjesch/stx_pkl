_"Your heritage is known to me. Half dragon, half basilisk, raised by a human. An alchemy of contradictions. Where, I wonder, does your loyalty lie?"_

A character is a Half-Human Hybrid ('Human' being used loosely,) but the parent races of the two 'halves' are at war, or generally don't get along well. This can present a problem depending on how much the character looks like either one. If he looks nothing like one, he may be able to fit into the other group with ease. If he looks like a mixture of both, however, he likely won't be able to fit in with either group. At best, he'll be teased or shunned for it, possibly becoming an 'evil' loner. At worst, he'll be exiled or possibly even killed. This could even be the villain's Start of Darkness, if he's hated by both sides enough to plot the eradication of both.

If the two parent races are _actually_ at war, the character will eventually be forced to choose a side to fight for. Depending on what they are, the choice may simply be between good and evil. Other times it may come down to 'the ones that shunned me' vs 'those that accepted me'. Occasionally, the decision is a difficult one, especially if they have friends from both sides. Depending on the cause of the mix, the character may be actively trying to become one side or the other, using the local Phlebotinum.

Related to Hunter of His Own Kind, for most hybrid characters. See also Half-Breed Discrimination and Child of Two Worlds. Depending on the situation, a Monsters Anonymous group may help reconcile or control the warring natures.

For a character whose conflict is _internal_, rather than between parent species, you may be looking for The Corruption, Enemy Within, Fighting from the Inside, or occasionally Viral Transformation. The character probably has Heroic Willpower. May be a Child of Forbidden Love.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Astro Boy_, there was a cyborg (half human, half robot) that was detested by both the robots and the humans, back when they weren't on so good terms. He resented that, and plotted revenge.
-   In _Beastars_ children resulting from an Interspecies Romance can have this. Legoshi's mother Leano was a komodo dragon/wolf hybrid and struggled with this for most of her life, until she killed herself once she started losing her fur and became scaly as her reptile heritage began to take over. Hybrids of carnivores and herbivores have it even worse, as shown by Melon whose leopard/gazelle genetics give him a complete loss of taste, an inability to digest meat, shunning away from large predator-species by default, and the involuntarily desire to utterly slaughter any herbivore he lays his eyes upon.
-   Inuyasha is a half-demon, who demons tease and humans fear. He originally plans to use the Shikon Jewel to become a full-fledged demon, but the priestess guarding the jewel tries to convince him to use it to become fully human instead. Circumstances conspire to prevent him from using it, though.
-   _Kyo Kara Maoh!_: Demons vs. Humans. Conrad and Josak choose to fight for the Demons.
-   _Violinist of Hameln_: Hamel's human side and Mazoku side are in constant conflict. He identifies as human and tries very hard to keep the Mazoku's murderous nature under control. It turns out that the constant struggle increases his magical power.

    Literature 

-   _The Beginning After the End_: Sylvie is the daughter of the dragon Sylvia of the Indrath Clan (who in turn is the daughter of Kezess, the leader of the Indrath Clan and the ruler of the Asuras) and the basilisk Agrona of the Vritra Clan (himself being the leader of said clan). Both sides of her heritage are engaged in a Divine Conflict that started when the former clan banished the latter from Epheotus for uncovering the fact they committed genocide in the distant past. Despite both sides of her heritage being no better than the other, especially when it comes to their callous attitude towards lessers, Sylvie is the White Sheep of both clans. This is because she was raised by the human Arthur Leywin after he was given her egg by Sylvia shortly before she sacrificed herself to save him from agents of the Vritra. As a result, Sylvie was raised away from the influence of either clan and has avoided being indoctrinated into the ideology of either, having borne witness to the worst atrocities of both clans and remaining firm to her adoptive father and his people who have suffered much at their hands. While she is committed to helping her adoptive father bring down both the Indrath and Vritra, she hates the latter more as the Vritra were not only responsible for murdering her mother but for invading and conquering Arthur's homeland of Dicathen (on top of killing much of her adoptive father's friends and family, including turning her adoptive mother and Arthur's Love Interest Tessia Eralith into the vessel for the Legacy). She is also willing to leverage her position as Kezess's granddaughter when it comes to dealing with the Indrath and the rest of the Asuras, which is especially useful when Arthur learns Kezess has occupied Dicathen under the pretext of protection while Arthur was in the aether realm for two months trying to bring her back. Case in point, when she and her adoptive father come across some of the dragons her grandfather has sent down to Dicathen, she defends him with her authority when one of them is hostile towards Arthur and orders said dragon to back off or face the consequences.

**Sylvie**: With Arthur, as it always has. Dicathen is my home, its people my people. Its enemies my enemies.

-   In Rob Thurman's _Cal Leandros_ series, Cal is half-human, half Auphe (really really really evil fairy). What are the most despised races in the world? Take a guess.
-   Esmer of _The Third Chronicles of Thomas Covenant_ is the son of a _Haruchai_ (a race of super-strong Lawful Neutral warriors) and a _merwife_ (Chaotic Neutral siren-like creatures). Hybrid Vigor gave Esmer extraordinary access to Earthpower. And the conflict between his _haruchai_ and _merwife_ natures make him batshit insane and potentially as harmful as any of Lord Foul's minions.
    -   In Esmer's case, his warring natures apparently mean that whenever he helps someone he is compelled to balance this out by screwing them over somehow, and whenever he screws someone over he is compelled to balance this out by helping them somehow. Linden takes advantage of this at one point, when Esmer is hanging around to prevent her and her party from escaping from deadly peril (his presence blocks the magic that would let her teleport out). Linden realizes that, since he is actively screwing her over by blocking her escape, she can force him to in turn help her by answering her questions.
-   Changelings in _The Dresden Files_ are half-human, half-fae. They are able to Choose (once) which one they want to belong to and when they do they become either fully fae or fully human. But until they make that choice, they're mortals with fae features and traits.
-   _The Fionavar Tapestry_: Darien. Between that coming from his mother's, and that of his father's.
-   In the _New Jedi Order_, Tahiri has this problem after a failed attempt to turn her into a half-Jedi half-Yuuzhan Vong Super-Soldier leaves her with two distinct personalities who are on opposite sides of the war. She finally resolves the issue near the end of the series, integrating both personalities to form, in effect, a completely new one with the strongest traits of both.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The villainous Scorpius in _Farscape_ is half-Sebacean, half-Scarran, and most of villainous actions are due to his seeking to aid the Sebaceans against the Scarrans by getting whatever technology he can.
    -   This conflict is reflected more literally in his biology: Sebaceans have an extreme intolerance for heat, while Scarrans produce heat in huge amounts - thus, maintaining equilibrium is something that has always preoccupied Scorpius.
    -   A large part of his hatred of the Scarrans is due to having been created as a prototype for a hybrid slave-race. By raping his mother. And keeping her alive for the _years_\-long pregnancy as she begged to be killed.
-   Michael of _Stargate Atlantis_. It doesn't work out very well for him.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_: Cardasssia's occupation of Bajor resulted in many Cardassian-Bajoran hybrids. The Bajorans see them as reminders of the atrocities committed during the occupation, and at least some Cardassians see them as evidence of infidelity to their spouses back home. One of them the daughter of the main villain becomes a minor recurring character for a while.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_: B'Elanna Torres struggles with the impulsive, combative instincts that come with her Klingon half. The episode "Faces" actually has her literally split into a human half and Klingon half.

    Video Games 

-   _Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits_ had this as a driving plot - a pair of twins, Half Human Hybrids, had been divided at birth. One had grown up amongst the humans, and was fortunate enough to not have any visible signs of his demonic side (At least at first...), while the other one grew up amongst the Deimos, and was visibly half-human, causing him to be ridiculed as a 'Wannabe Deimos'. However, they both eventually rose to lead their respective factions in a war against their other side...
-   Toward the beginning of _Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django_, you get turned into a vampire. Although Django is eventually purified, he is stuck as half-vampire, half solar child. He continues his fight against undeads and immortals.
-   Seymour in _Final Fantasy X_. Half-human, half-Guado prince that was supposed to unite the two races, but winds up being ostracized by both because of his mixed race.
-   One of the possible party members in _Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords_ was Cyrus Darkhunter, half-elf, half-human and not really welcomed by either race.
-   In _World of Warcraft_, there's at least one half-Draenei, half Orc NPC. He's a questgiver for both factions.
    -   There's also Garona, a half-orc, half-draenei. She was mind-controlled to serve evil, but eventually got over it and helps out both factions now. Her in game model is pure orc, but her official artwork elegantly combines both features of each of the races more attractive females. She was a genetic creation, so it's plausible that she was made to be pretty.

    Web Comics 

-   Glon, from _Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic_, is half-human, half-orc. He seems to be accepted by the monsters of Black Mountain, but that might be more out of respect and/or fear of his mother , orc matriarch Maula Bloodhand.
    -   It's established that all orc-human hybrids in this universe suffer this to some extant. They have a tendency to slip into a berserker rage if they lose control of their tempers (its all part of the Orc-God's plan to breed a super-warrior to conquer the world in his name).

    Western Animation 

-   In _Voltron: Legendary Defender_, Keith is half human and half Galra, two races, which during Season 7, are at war with each other. At one point, Lance discusses how as the child of a human man and a Galra woman, Keith represents a peaceful future.
