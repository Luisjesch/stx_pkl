An evil born in fire, laid to rest via pyre.

**Huey:** Colonel Stinkmeaner had no family, and no friends. He lived a life without love, or companionship, or even pets. He was a horrible, awful human being, and in truth, the world was better off with him dead. Still... he was a brother.  
**Granddad:** _\[to God\]_ ...Please forgive us for taking this man's life.  
**Riley:** Why you sayin' "us"? You killed him!  
**Granddad:** Shut your ass and pray, boy.

At the end of a journey, The Hero manages to kill the Big Bad or Arch-Enemy. Though we as the audience are conditioned to forget about the antagonist's remains afterwards, sometimes we will see a memorial service being held where the hero ends up paying their respects to their deceased foe anyway. There are several reasons for this.

The first and most understandable reason is that the villain has familial or mutual relationships with either the hero themselves or the hero's party. Even if they wanted to unleash The Plague or blow up the world, the villain was their best friend, father, mother, sibling, comrade in arms, or other kin. You just hoped it wouldn't have to end in the hero taking the villain's life and severing their bonds in the process.

The second reason is mostly out of respect, given the fact that they had to go the extra distance to foil the evildoer's plans. Because of all of their efforts, the hero respects the villain for giving them the fight of their lives, making them a Worthy Opponent in their eyes so the hero returns the favor by offering their slain nemesis a memorial in their honor.

The third reason could be because, now that the villain cannot do any more evil deeds, they can try to remember the positive aspects of the villain prior to their Face–Heel Turn. In some cases, it may involve Redemption Equals Death.

The final reason is simply that the heroes themselves just have really big hearts and don't want the person to be forgotten or go unloved.

It may involve Due to the Dead, but because most fictional media don't incorporate this or believe that the villain shouldn't be focused on after their demise, usually the villain's remains are forgotten and their fate is unknown. This is also generally done as a means of closing a story-line and ensuring that everything is finished.

Sub-trope of Alas, Poor Villain. Contrast And There Was Much Rejoicing for when character deaths (which commonly include villains) are met with praise than sorrow, often denying them a proper memorial. Also contrast Villain Respect where the villain will offer sincere praise to the hero they're up against.

No inverted examples, please! There's already a trope that covers villains paying their respects to the deceased heroes: Antagonist in Mourning, so any inversions should go there instead.

## **WARNING: Since this is a Death Trope, spoilers will be unmarked.**

-   _Inuyasha_: Kanna, in her last moments, refuses to march towards Inuyasha's gang to destroy them, as Naraku wants. He explodes her to smithereens, but a tiny shard of Kanna enters Kagome's eye; through that link, Kanna tells her that light can kill Naraku, taking revenge on him for killing her and Kagura. Inuyasha puts Kanna's mirror standing up with some rocks, as a memorial for her.

    Comic Books 

-   _AXIS_: When Carnage — who'd had his morality inverted — seemingly sacrifices himself to smother the X-Men's gene-bomb, Cletus Kasady makes Spider-Man promise to build a rhinestone-encrusted statue of him in the middle of New York City, draped in the Confederate battle flag and blaring Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird". The final issue shows Peter keeping his promise and building the statue.

    Fan Works 

-   _Miraculous Escalation_: Echidna isn't the main villain, but she is the only one that Chat Noir is forced to Cataclysm, and her situation was a very tragic series of events happening to an otherwise ordinary teenager like him.

-   _The Negotiationsverse_: In "Useless", Applejack and Rainbow Dash, now members of a terrorist cell called the Equestrian Freedom Fighters, are gunned down while preparing to make their Last Stand.

The reasoning is part as a thanks for saving her life from Fjordell genocide at the cost of his own life and part as a recognition of Hrathen as Worthy Opponent and Anti-Villain that genuinly wanted Arelon to join Fjordell and convert peacefully. Sarene even says during service that, in a way, Hrathen saved Arelon.

Rose tries throughout the episode to convince Mrs. Claxton to help save the tree, but when the miserable old biddy finally insults Rose one too many times, Rose finally loses her patience and yells at her to "drop dead". Which Mrs. Claxton promptly does, out of shock. Rose feels so guilty about what happened - especially after it's revealed that Mrs. Claxton had no friends or relatives to give her a proper burial - that the other girls decide to all chip in and pay for a funeral themselves. Unfortunately, Mrs. Claxton was so hated that no one but the girls (and a woman who mistakes it for a different funeral) attend.
