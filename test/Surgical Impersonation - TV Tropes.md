_"He's the most brilliant and dangerous criminal mind I've ever known. For years, I've been watching him, tracking him, studying his every move. I know his every mannerism, facial tic, gesture. I know him better than he knows himself. And now, after all this time, I've figured out a way to trap him — I will become him."_

A Sub-Trope of Magic Plastic Surgery, this is when a person, whether by accident or on purpose, ends up with the face of another through reconstructive surgery. Usually, some kind of big accident is involved (or staged) that leads to the fateful operation, or the person might just disappear for a while and come back with the new face. However, as mentioned, this is a Sub-Trope of Magic Plastic Surgery: it is not enough that the person has a new face, it is a _specific_ face, the face of someone else that is known to the other characters, perhaps even a character who's a participant in the story. Also, this isn't _literally_ having the other person's face (usually...), just having surgery to look like the other person. Bottom line is this: the person's new face is not a random or unknown one, it is a face well known to the other characters. Also, this is not the same as Latex Perfection: while that might be another way of impersonating someone, it is not at all permanent like Surgical Impersonation is, nor does it have as many dramatic options.

Many interesting phenomena can happen from a character changing his/her face like this, resulting in tropes that have good synergy with this one:

-   Becoming the Mask: The character, in adopting someone else's face, actually starts living that person's life, and might even start to enjoy it and not want to go back to his previous life.
-   Identity Amnesia: A very interesting combination: a character suffers amnesia and is given someone else's face. This can lead to a Tomato in the Mirror situation in which the character eventually finds, to his horror, that he's not the person everyone claims he is. A Mining Accident On Troy might also play a part here. If the author wants to hit the character with the full whammy, he might go for Amnesiac Dissonance, too.
-   Dead Person Impersonation: One of the more common tropes associated with this one: the person is impersonating a deceased person for some motive or another, usually revenge. If the impersonator CAUSED the original's death, it's Kill and Replace. It can also be a case of My Sibling Will Live Through Me: the person receiving the surgery takes this trope to the extreme, becoming physically identical to the dead relative.

Sub-Trope of Magic Plastic Surgery. Compare Latex Perfection. A form of Acting for Two.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Jack_ has done this at least twice:
    -   Once to save the life of a guy who's been sentenced to death as a scapegoat for a car accident caused by a rich guy's asshole son (by making him look like the son in question).
    -   Once to help a nurse get revenge on the incompetent boss who ruined her career (by making her look like the singer the boss is obsessed with). In the latter case, Black Jack's ability to perfectly replicate the singer's face is justified by saying that he'd done plastic surgery on the singer too — or, to be more precise, he "made her face" as well.
-   In one case in _Case Closed_, the murderer receives surgery in order to make his face look like Shin'ichi's, in order to pin the murder on him and get revenge on him. He fakes his voice by claiming that he's sick with a cold — ironically, Shin'ichi actually does have a cold.
-   In one _Crying Freeman_ story, an organization trying to infiltrate the 108 Dragons takes two agents and reconstructs them as identical clones of Freeman, down to his body tattoos, mannerisms and even _genitalia_. Freeman returns the favor by managing to get one of them killed and impersonating him, so he infiltrates the other organization in return.
-   _Durarara!!_: Mika Harima was badly injured and had her face remade to look like Celty's original head, which she was trying to destroy at the time, so she could get closed to Seiji, who is obsessed with said head.

-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable_: After being discovered by the heroes and making an escape, Yoshikage Kira kidnaps a random man off the street and forces a Stand User to use her powers to give him the man's face, then kills both his victim and the Stand User to hide from the heroes once more by living his victim's life.
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_, Meer Campbell — a Lacus Clyne fangirl who possessed a singing voice not unlike hers but was _very_ different looks-wise — agrees to have surgery (and probable DNA manipulation) that turns her into an identical twin of Lacus. This is later revealed to be an attempt to abuse Lacus' political influence by Gilbert Durandal, since Lacus herself refused to work with him; Meer, a Broken Bird who's strongly implied to be a war orphan, went along with it because she is desperately lonely.
-   In _Pretty Face_, the protagonist is in an accident and the surgeon reconstructs his face with a picture of the protagonist's unrequited crush. His face ends up identical to the girl's long-lost twin sister.

-   In _Über_, Josef Goebbels has plastic surgery to replace Adolf Hitler after he is murdered. This is achieved through a superhuman with extremely delicate and accurate disruption halo powers.
-   _XIII_: The eponymous protagonist utilizes this trope in conjunction with Dead Person Impersonation to draw out members of a government conspiracy. After the titular conspirator kills the president, the rest of the group has him killed. His wife, another conspirator as well as The Mole, hires his rival from his old army unit to impersonate her late husband so the rest of the group will come out of hiding to try and finish him off.

While all his friends are surprised at the resemblance, conniving Neely is the one who suspects something, getting into a catfight in a pool with Allison. She tells Mitch that the fight was an excuse to get a closer look and feel the scars by Allison's ears and hairline that show she had some plastic surgery, and this "resemblance" is no coincidence.

-   _Dark Matter (2015)_: One is revealed to have taken the identity of a notorious criminal by changing his face (and voice) with plastic surgery when he's captured by the same criminal.
