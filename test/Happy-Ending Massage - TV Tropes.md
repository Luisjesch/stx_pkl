**Josh:** I loved them so much...  
**Alex:** You loved who?  
**Josh:** The girls of Madam Camae's Filipino Palace...  
**Alex:** You've been spending our rent money on Filipino hookers?  
**Josh:** They're not hookers, they're massage therapists.  
**Mover #2:** Yeah, she'll massage your cock for money.  
**Mover #1:** There's a word for that, I think it's hooker.  
**Josh:** YOU'RE A HOOKER!

Massages are good fodder for comedy because the near-intimate touching is uncomfortable or can create an uncomfortable situation.

However, sometimes this "uncomfortable situation" is exactly what the customer is looking for. Beyond that, in fact, the customer is paying for sexual acts under the guise of getting a massage. When this happens, the customer will almost always be male, and the masseuse will almost always be an Asian female.

Truth in Television; many massage parlors, especially Asian massage parlors, have been discovered to be fronts for prostitution or offer prostitution services on the side. Sadly, human trafficking tends to be involved. This is why "massage parlor" is sometimes used as a euphemism for a brothel.

A recent variant in fiction has no "happy ending" offer after a massage, but rather the massage itself has that effect. The masseuse, with or without realizing it, is actually so incredibly skilled that (s)he can bring a client unbelievable pleasure with a massage that's never shown to involve anything remotely sexual.

Not to be confused with a hero who gets a massage as a reward for his hard work of saving the day, which is likely a Massage of Love. Also contrast Miserable Massage, where the massage is anything but pleasurable.

    Advertising 

-   A now-banned commercial for the NFL has a guy getting a massage from an attractive-looking nurse and appearing to make this request (she objects, insisting she'd be fired if she did). Eventually, she gives in and turns the television in the room on to football (what he had actually wanted).

    Anime & Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Momiji is an amateur masseuse whose massages leave people in extreme ecstasy. She also has a fondness for fondling sensitive body parts and anything soft.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_:
    -   After Matsuri wonders if it'd be better if he stayed a girl, Suzu asks him to massage her arms and thighs. It was a way to demonstrate Matsuri wasn't comfortable touching girls, and thus still a boy at heart, but Suzu was also enjoying it sexually.
    -   Suzu tries the same tactic to break Matsuri out of hypnosis that made him believe he was always a girl. However, Matsuri turns out to be an excellent masseuse when not distracted like he was last time. End result: Suzu collapses in sexual ecstasy without Matsuri being any the wiser.
    -   Matsuri performs an exorcism on Suzu's brother Ritta while claiming he's giving him a pressure-point massage. Matsuri's verbal and body language are so unknowingly sexual, Ritta thinks he's being seduced. Afterward, Suzu asks for the same treatment, getting a Dope Slap from Shirogane.
-   In _MM!_, Mamiya Yumi specializes in giving massages that make the client or, more often, victim feel more than a little too good. She doesn't just specialize in this though, she has a deep (and later demonstrably perverse) love of doing this to cute girls, whether the girls in question want it or not.
-   In _Softenni_, rival team manager Leo is descended from a family that specializes in massage, and he's known to be a remarkable talent that comes around once every hundred years or so, able to bring his clients to severe climax in a matter of a few minutes just by rubbing their backs and shoulders. Comically Missing the Point, Leo insists he's in need of further training because anytime he gives one of the girls a massage she winds up even more exhausted when he's finished.
-   In _Tenchi Muyo: War on Geminar_, main character Kenshi is taught the art of massage by Mexiah. Afterward, anytime he receives a signal he becomes a "massage machine" who makes the women massage feel so much pleasure that they can be trapped on the edge of orgasm for days.

    Comic Books 

-   The titular character from _Dark Reign: Mister Negative_ is a crimelord, who among many other criminal businesses owns a brothel masked as a massage parlor. In one scene inside it we see a guest that just asks for "happy ending" - seconds later both he and girl are killed by a supervillain working for The Hood, who had just declared a gang war on Negative.
-   A fully consensual example happened in the _She-Hulk_ graphic novel, where Jen gets one from her current boyfriend Wyatt Wingfoot at the end. It was only implied that a "happy ending" would occur; if it did, given the Hell they both went through during the story, it might have also counted as Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex.

    Comedy

    **Gabriel:** _\[suddenly interested\]_ Felipe, you hear that?  
    **Felipe:** Fool, I'm inside!
    
-   Daniel Tosh has turned these into something of a running gag; Japanese chiropractors, little old ladies, "pleasure coaches," chickens...
-   Rodney Carrington on massages:
    
    I don’t understand the whole concept of a massage. You get a woman to rub all over every single part of your body except the one part you really want rubbed on. And it's not like she didn't know what part I was talking about. I kept pointing at it and clearing my throat.
    
-   Craig Ferguson has a bit on this in one of his standup routines. He says that every time a man goes to get a massage, he knows it's not going to be a Happy Ending Massage... but in the back of his head, he always thinks it might turn into one. He logically knows it won't. But it miiiiiight.
-   Bill Engvall has a bit where his wife sends him to a massage parlor to help relieve him of stress. His struggle to maintain his Seduction-Proof Marriage when greeted by the Ms. Fanservice masseuse only leaves him _more_ stressed.
-   Dara Ó Briain tells an anecdote about needing to get a sports massage to help him recover from an injury. Unfortunately, due to some confusion on the part of the person he asked for directions, he ended up at "the wrong sort of massage parlour".

    Fan Works 

-   _The Life and Times of a Winning Pony_: Rarity _inadvertently_ sets up one of these for Cloud Kicker when arranging a spa trip for her as an apology for tricking her into foalsitting the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Rarity had no clue she had set up _this_ kind of massage until Cloud Kicker told her. For the record, the twins only agreed to it because it was Rarity their most loyal, long-term customer (who had saved the world three times, to boot) asking.
-   In the _Star Trek: Voyager_ Parody Fic "The Voyorgy Conspiracy", this is one of the routine tasks of the Emergency Medical Hologram, with a spoof of the Doc/Janeway massage scene in "Scientific Method".

    "It certainly is now," moaned Janeway as she neared orgasm.

-   _Kitsune no Ken: Fist of the Fox_: The story's twenty-first Gaiden chapter gives an example of the "massage itself having the effect" variant, when Mabui's employee Okyo gives Sumire, a married mother of two, a foot massage during the overall massage therapy session. Because her feet are sensitive, Sumire feels the effect much more strongly when Okyo starts applying the spa's signature Pressure Point technique, and she winds up experiencing a quiet orgasm (for which she tips Okyo generously afterward).
-   _Us and Them_: The side-story "D-List Celebrities" has Sephiroth coming home from work, looking forward to a massage from his wife, Aeris, and the subsequent happy ending. Since he spent the day doing paperwork, instead of the usual merc work, she's not inclined to oblige him with the massage or the happy ending, much to his chagrin.
-   _Love Can Surprise You At Any Time In Your Life_: In Chapter 5, Leela, sick and sore from pregnancy, has an Erotic Dream about her late baby daddy Lars giving her a Massage of Love that turns sexual.

-   In _Smelly Fourth Year_ Fred and George create a brochure for the imaginary "Happy Ending Resort" and claim it fell from Dumbledore's robe.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Full Body Massage_: A rare female example of this trope. It's clear from the beginning that there's a sexual element to the massages that Nina gets once a week from Douglas. She's obviously disappointed when Douglas doesn't show and a guy named Fitch arrives for her appointment instead. Eventually she admits to him that while she doesn't have sex with Douglas, he gets her off with his hands.
-   In _Full Frontal 2002_, Gus (played by David Duchovny) asks for a happy ending to his massage — and wonders if he can wear a plastic bag on his head while doing it. The masseuse refuses but blames herself later when he's found asphyxiated in his room. And this is all played for laughs.

-   In _War, Inc._, Yonica heavily implies that she has given these before.
-   _Couples Retreat_ includes a scene where a bickering couple gets massages. The husband is aroused by his female masseuse and hints to her that he wants her to finish the job. She tells him, "I'm sorry, but THAT will not have a happy ending."
-   In _2 Days in the Valley_, Vice Officers Strayer and Taylor are busting "happy ending" massage parlors.

-   Played for Laughs and subverted on _Four Sisters and a Wedding_. The Bayags have a chain of male-only spas that promise "happy endings" to their customers; the sisters suspect that it's a cover for, if not prostitution, another illicit activity. Teddie goes to investigate; it goes awry when she calls the cops on a masseuse, mistaking the activity for something sexual — it turns out to be completely wholesome; "happy ending" means "happy thoughts".
-   Played for Laughs and subverted in _Somewhere_. A masseur attends to Johnny in the absence of the woman who usually sees him. Johnny is laying face down on the table in his towel when the masseur himself starts to undress. Once Johnny sees the man’s shorts fall to the floor, he jumps up in surprise. The man explains that he thought Johnny was familiar with his technique because it was on his website: if the client is naked, the masseur feels it’s more comfortable if he meets the client at the same level.
-   _Venus Beauty Institute_: The Venus Beauty Salon does _not_ give these out, being a legit beauty salon—but a man who comes in seems to think that they do. When Marie is running through the list of massages they give, the man keeps asking if they include "finishing touches." Innocent Marie does not get it, but her older coworker Angele certainly does and Angele throws the man out.
-   _Young Lady Chatterley II_. The lady of the house gets stimulated by her lesbian masseuse while describing the ideal lover she's looking for. Afterwards the masseuse has to remind Lady Chatterley about the shoulder injury she was originally treating.

    Jokes 

-   A man goes to a massage parlor and asks masseuse about if it's true you can pay for a sexual version there. The masseuse confirms it, and once they've haggled on the price, takes the money, leaves the room... and comes back five minutes later asking if he's done masturbating.
-   One joke has the masseuse offer a Happy Ending - only to bring out the client's Disappeared Dad. And then the _father_ says "Okay, get your pants off and lets get this over with."

    Literature 

-   At one point in _A Dirty Job_, the main character had too much "sexual energy". Even though he ended up at a massage parlour, he didn't ask for a "happy ending" but instead later went to an "official" hooker. This led to trouble, as the girl he chose turned out to be a crazy incarnation of Death. Even the cop who saved him said that he should have just chosen the happy ending.
-   Mass murderer Kevin Olmstead in _Alex Cross_ novel _Cross My Heart_ targets parlors that offer these.

-   Red Grant's masseuse in _From Russia with Love_ doesn't go out of her _way_ to do this with her clients, per se, but... it apparently turns out that way a lot. Grant stands out in that (among other things) he doesn't react at all.
-   In the second _Bardic Voices_ novel, as the church starts grabbing more and more control of the city that most of the book takes place in, they impose more and more religiously based rules on the populace, including shutting down all the brothels. However, that just drives them all underground, with some of them being covered as massage parlors where one can pay extra for a "special massage".
-   Played with in a _very_ disturbing way in Tennessee Williams' short story "Desire and the Black Masseur": the client finds himself getting a sexual charge from when the masseur hits him too hard. It escalates to broken bones and eventually cannibalism.
-   In _The Dresden Files_, Gentleman John Marcone, the crime boss of Chicago, owns a fitness center/massage parlor that's blatantly a front for a brothel. He also gives Harry a complimentary Platinum Membership and run of the facility, for two reasons. One, he's hoping to keep Harry Distracted by the Sexy, and two, he's very well acquainted with Harry's reputation as a Person of Mass Destruction and figures that since Harry's too powerful to be stopped if he decides to break into any of Marcone's properties, it's much cheaper to simply give him free access instead of having Harry blast his way through. Harry, being a Screw the Money, I Have Rules! person, never takes advantage of the former benefit.
-   Inverted in the German novel _Gottes Bodenpersonal - eine unwahrscheinliche Liebesgeschichte_: The protagonist has to promise his lover that it will _not_ be one of _those_ to get him to accept a massage.They are emotionally very close, but sex is a problem.
-   In Irvine Welsh's _Porno_, this is the way college student Nikki Fuller-Smith makes good money: she knows she's not great at the job, but she's a much more conventional beauty than her colleagues and some customers ask for her based on looks alone. Arguably, it gets worse.

One of the other main characters (Mr. Justice Sir Guthrie Featherstone, a stiff-necked, somewhat conservative type<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) _thinks_ that he has been going to that parlour for actual massages, not realizing what was going on. He finds himself presiding over Rumpole's client's trial, and of course recusing himself would be incredibly embarrassing (effectively admitting that he had attended a house of ill repute if the accused were convicted), so he spends much of the trial siding with the defense, to Rumpole's delight and confusion. As it turns out, he was going to a totally legitimate parlour with an almost-identical name; good for him, as the accused was found guilty.

-   Carlos _accidentally_ gives one of these while working as a masseur (his job while he was blind) on _Desperate Housewives_.

-   _Barney Miller_:
    -   In one episode Fish goes to a massage parlor which had just recently been busted for prostitution. His wife is justifiably worried, but he really did just go for a massage.

He decided that, since he caused the man a lot of stress, Earl would book him a massage with "Camden's only legal masseuse." She's a bit worried because many guys in Camden (including, apparently, Randy) would attempt to invoke this trope. Of course, they find that Josh has died in an unfortunate Murphy's Bed incident, and (as Earl puts it) "there was _no one_ who could massage the stiffness out of him now."
-   Played With once on _NCIS: Los Angeles_ when Sam tracks down a shady businessman at a massage parlor. He silently takes over for the masseuse, and then sticks his gun into the back of the businessman's neck and promises a very _un_\-happy ending if he doesn't start talking.

Patrick is mortified, as he didn't intend that to be part of the gift and only left the masseur an envelop of cash and instructions to take very good care of David. Thankfully, David and Patrick are a solid couple and talk it out, and David even tells Patrick that he is his "happy ending" during their vows.

It doesn't help that Laharl is a Prinny in the cameo.
    -   She makes a Prinny massage her in the Drama CD as well. If you don't know what is going on it sounds just like what you would think it would sound like.
-   In each of the Game Boy Color remakes of _Dragon Quest_ and _Dragon Quest II_, the hero has an opportunity to get a "puff puff massage" from a flirtatious young woman.
    -   Hilariously played for laughs in VIII: You finally find out what a "Puff Puff" is supposed to represent (Marshmallow Hell) AND what it actually is (two slimes and a con woman suckering the hell out of your heroes) AND you can get Jessica to grudgingly try one, which she's not amused at because she THOUGHT THAT THE "PUFF PUFF" SKILL SHE LEARNED AND USED ON LECHER MONSTERS REALLY WAS ABOUT FLASHING HER BOOBS LIKE THOSE HARLOT SUCCUBI\]
-   _Final Fantasy VII Remake_ has a non-sexual(?) version of this during the beat where Cloud needs to get Madam M's assistance to get into Don Corneo's manor, and she coerces him into getting one of three different types of hand massages (as in Cloud's arm). Choosing the "Poor Man's" option will give him an experience so rough it'll deal damage to the health bar, while the "Standard" option is a pretty relaxing, slightly sensual, but otherwise normal experience. The "Luxury" option, however, provokes very immodest reactions and puts him in a fuzzy, trance-like state once it's over, leaving very little to no doubt on how he _really_ felt during the whole thing.
-   _Saints Row 2_ game has an activity where the player has to save their favorite massage parlor from going out of business. How do they do this? By delivering truckloads of sex workers to the place that the Boss rescues from abusive pimps working for the rival gangs.

With enough leveling, he even gets a "special bonus" every time he buys one.

The person then clarifies that he means a real one, telling Wei to get his mind out of the gutter.

    Visual Novels 

-   Xianne offers the protagonist of _Melody_ one of these when she takes care of him at the massage parlor, citing a policy.

However, when Xianne apologizes for her “mistake,” she offers the protagonist private massages that go far beyond handjobs for happy endings.

    Web Animation 

-   An animated _Cyanide and Happiness_ short has a customer at a massage parlor asked if he wants a happy ending after it's over. He responds by saying that for a change, he wants a _sad_ ending.

-   _Sealab 2021_: when the other Debbie went on vacation, she insisted on getting one of these.
-   In _King of the Hill_, Dale's wife cheats on him with John Redcorn, all under the guise of a massage treatment to help with her headaches. It is later revealed that John really does have a legitimate massage office, but it's strongly implied that his therapy works as a sort of foreplay.
    -   Played for Laughs when Hank, who is suffering serious back pain, goes to Redcorn for a massage. The office is clearly set up for seduction, with dimmed lights and romantic music that can't be turned off. The two heterosexual men are both incredibly uncomfortable, and just as John is about to touch Hank he says that he might try yoga instead, which John agrees to with obvious relief.
-   This quote from Otto the bus driver on _The Simpsons:_ "Man. I guess this story had a happy ending after all. Just like my last massage."
