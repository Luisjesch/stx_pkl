_"My son, herein lies my faiths, my beliefs and my unfoldments. A complete diary of my experiments, charts and secret formulas. In short, the sum total of my knowledge, such as it is. Perhaps you will regard my work with ridicule or even with a distaste. If so, destroy these records. But if you like me burn with the irresistible desire to penetrate the unknown, carry on. The path is cruel and torturous, carry on. I put secret after truth, you will be hated, blasphemed and condemned. You have inherited the fortune of the Frankensteins, I trust you will not inherit their fate."_

A Sub-Trope of Spin-Offspring specifically for relatives of the Mad Scientist Victor Frankenstein (or Henry Frankenstein in a case of Adaptational Name Change in the _Universal Horror_ series), sometimes referred to only with titles like Dr. Frankenstein or Baron Frankenstein. It does not refer to just any relative of him featured in a story, but specifically those that have also chosen a career in Creating Life or continuing experiments on the original Frankenstein's Monster.

Although sometimes the story will focus on a descendant of Frankenstein who actually knew him and for whom Frankenstein's actions and legacy actually meant something, many times they are a character that outside of a throwaway mention of their ancestor has no relation to him other than being a mad scientist that creates flesh golem abominations and has the Frankenstein surname. These characters will pick up the monster making family business after being inspired by their ancestor's work and trying to prove him right. Most often they will meet the same fate as their progenitor and end up slain, either by their own creation or by the protagonist of the story.

Most often this trope is used because the writers have a character similar to Frankenstein and wanted to use his name in the title but either due to it being set after the nineteenth century or because the characters were too different from Victor for the audience to accept, they simply made their own deranged doctor a descendant of him. It's no coincidence most of these examples come after Hammer Studio's Frankenstein series of the '60s and '70s reinvented Victor as a Darker and Edgier Villain Protagonist.

    Web Videos 

-   YouTuber Dark Corner Pictures attempted to make a Frankenstein Family tree, which became convoluted once examples of this trope started popping up. He sums up this trope quite well:
    
    _"For generations, the Frankensteins have gone into the family business of stitching together the dead, electrifying them, and being killed by the result. Never letting the lack of any real success or high mortality rate stand in their way. But the truth is, as horror fans, we appreciate their boneheaded and pointless self sacrifice. Where would horror be without the clan of Frankenstein, at once so smart and yet so apocalyptically dumb. Never learning from their mistakes, each new generation charging in, with contempt for their forebears and misplaced optimism as they commit what amounts to needlessly elaborate suicide in the name of our entertainment."_
