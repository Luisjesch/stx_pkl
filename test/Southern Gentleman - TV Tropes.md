Now boy, ah say boy! Get us one of them captions over he-are. And a mint julep while you's at it.

The Southern Gentleman is the Spear Counterpart to the Southern Belle.

Common virtues: Well-dressed, well-spoken (even when swearing up a blue streak), charmin', suave and invariably polite to the opposite gender.

Common vices: Racism (including, in the appropriate period, actual slaveholding), drinking, smoking pipes and/or cigars, gambling, pride.

Other attributes: White suit of light material (especially in summer), corncob pipe that nevertheless manages to look dignified, mint julep.

Habitat: Romance novels, westerns.

Notes: Subject to severe Values Dissonance for modern audiences, as, depending on time period, he usually either owns slaves or is nostalgic for the era of slavery (even if he doesn't harbor any actual racist views, the romanticism of the south's "golden age" is what matters).

Associated tropes: Dixie accent, Officer and a Gentleman. Villainous portrayals include Fat, Sweaty Southerner in a White Suit and Villain in a White Suit, and may overlap with Southern Gothic Satan. May be Affably Evil or Faux Affably Evil as well, if the character is a villain.

Status: Nearly extinct. Some are still known to moonlight as simple country lawyers or fast food mascots.

Compare and contrast The Friendly Texan.

## Examples:

    Anime and Manga 

-   Guin Rhineford from _∀ Gundam_, a literal Southern Aristocrat with a penchant for fine white suits and luxury airships. The trope is somewhat played with in that he's a) Ambiguously Brown and b) one of only seven canonically LGBT characters in all of _Gundam_ (the others being Tieria Erde, Alejandro Conner and Ribbons Almark of _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_, _Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn_'s Angelo Sauper, and Yamagi Gilmerton and Norba Shino of _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_), two things which almost certainly wouldn't fly in the Old South, as opposed to the post-apocalyptic future South.

    Comics 

-   Gambit from the _X-Men_ books counts as this. His dark past aside, he has a very genial personality, especially towards women, he dresses well and he's from The Big Easy. Fits in with him also being a Gentleman Thief and a Lovable Rogue.

    Films — Animated 

-   "Big Daddy" La Bouff from _The Princess and the Frog_ is something of a reconstruction of one. While he may be a sugar baron and one of the richest men in New Orleans, he's nothing short of a gentleman and treats anybody who works for him with the utmost respect. He is nothing but courteous and kind to Tiana the whole time.
-   Lotso, the Lots-o-Huggin' Bear from _Toy Story 3_, as voiced by Kentucky native Ned Beatty.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Django Unchained_ (being set during the Antebellum South) features two particularly vicious deconstructions: Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett and Calvin J. Candie. Both are plantation owners and slavers, and Deliberate Values Dissonance is in full effect with their monstrously brutal treatment of slaves.
    -   Big Daddy (pictured above) is seen having young girls whipped for accidentally breaking eggs, and heads a gang of proto-Klansmen called the Regulators. Also, he's Don Johnson in a white suit.
    -   Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) manages to be even worse: his hobbies include the study of the racist pseudo-science of phrenology and forcing his slaves to fight each other to the death in "mandingo" fights for his amusement. His civility is an act, as he is nowhere near as cultured or intelligent as he believes himself to be. We also see him having a slave unwilling to fight torn apart by hungry dogs.
-   Like Hatfield, Sergeant Beaufort in _Fort Apache_ is a "fallen" example. A former Confederate officer, he enlisted in the U.S. Cavalry as a private after the Civil War. While not exactly conforming to the stereotype visually — he is played by Pedro Armendáriz — he is easily the most polished of the regiment's non-coms (some of whom had been officers in the Union army).
-   _Gone with the Wind_: Rhett Butler is the Trope Maker, but also a subversion, just as Scarlett O'Hara does for the Southern Belle trope. The whole point of the character was that he wasn't exactly a gentleman.
    -   Ashley Wilkes, the other object of Scarlett's affection, is a more conventional example of the trope.

-   In _Gun Fury_, Frank Slayton used to be an officer in the Army of Northern Virginia, and still fancies himself as a southern gentleman. However, he becomes increasingly paranoid and murders three of his own gang for various real and imagined offenses.
-   Buck Cantrell from the Bette Davis film _Jezebel_ is a classic example. Amongst other attributes, he is a skilled duellist and Julie attempts to goad him into fighting a duel against Pres, the suitor who spurned her.
-   Lionel Barrymore plays one in _The Little Colonel_, which is set in the 1870s. He's a Grumpy Old Man nostalgic for the Old South and full of hatred for "Yankees". Then Shirley Temple comes along and cheers him up.
-   Lots of this is lampshaded throughout _Maverick_.
-   Jeff Custer (full name Jefferson) from Hitchcock's _Mr and Mrs Smith_.
-   _Murder in Coweta County:_ Sheriff Lamar Potts is a blue-collar version of the trope, being a dutiful, well-spoken man who is always polite and courteous toward women, doesn't gloat about his victories and cares deeply about justice.
-   One of Walter's daydream personas in _The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947)_ is that of a riverboat gambler. Not the most respectable profession, perhaps, but in his manners and appearance, he's a true gentleman.
-   Hatfield from _Stagecoach_ is a down-on-his-luck example. After the end of the Confederacy he went west and makes a living as a gambler, but recognizing Mrs. Malory as the daughter of his late commanding officer, he immediately starts to fuss over her. In a slight deconstruction of the trope, he is very class-conscious and thus his courtesy to women emphatically does not extend to Dallas (implied to be a prostitute). He also has a marked difference of opinion with Doc Boone, a veteran of the Union Army, as to how the, um, late unpleasantness should be referred to.
-   _Thank You for Smoking_ brings us "The Captain," who is this trope made flesh, right down to the mint julep. He's described as "the last great man of tobacco."
-   John Henry Holliday, better known as Doc Holliday from _Tombstone_ and other films. Also a real-life example.
-   A modern and heroic example is Benoit Blanc from the _Knives Out_ films. He has the (possibly embellished) accent, the stylish dress, and the charm and politeness, but without the associated prejudices.

    Folklore 

-   In a lot of black southern folk tales, especially from closer to the time of slavery, the Devil often takes the form of one of these guys. For obvious reasons, considering they were usually also the cruel masters under whom slaves suffered.

    Literature 

-   In _Auntie Mame_, Mame's husband Beauregard Burnside, as the name suggests, is a filthy rich oil tycoon from Georgia.
-   Several, most notably Colonel Sherburn, in _Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_.
-   Drake Morrell from Louis L'Amour's _Bendigo Shafter_.
-   _The Caster Chronicles_: Macon is a kind-hearted, immaculately dressed man who is quite courteous and eloquent, both when he wants to be friendly and when he's being snarky to his enemies.
-   Quincey Morris in _Dracula_ is one of Lucy Westenra's suitors and a very Friendly Texan. Even after Lucy turns down his proposal Quincey remains on friendly terms with Arthur Holmwood (who she agreed to marry).
-   Several patriarchs from the upper-class Sartoris family from the works of William Faulkner. While there is much to admire about these men, they are still clearly presented by Faulkner as racist and, often, lost in the past.
-   Atticus Finch of _To Kill a Mockingbird_ fame is a Simple Country Lawyer and a shining example of this trope. Unfortunately, _Go Set a Watchman_ reveals that he does have the racist views common to this trope — though that book appears to take place in an Alternate Continuity, being an early draft of _To Kill a Mockingbird_ that Harper Lee considerably changed before it became the finished product.
-   Most of the major Southern characters in _Victoria_ are some variation of this; for example, General Laclede is a classic type, while Colonel McMoster is a somewhat more rugged middle-class example.
-   O. Henry was very fond of depicting this type. Notably, in "The Duplicity of Hargraves," the eponymous actor makes a study of Major Pendleton Talbot, a real, stereotypical Southern gentleman (whose characteristics, including literally every one of them listed above (except the corn-cob pipe, for which he substitutes a clay) are specifically cited) in order to caricature him on-stage as "Colonel Calhoun."
-   _Holmes on the Range_: Julius Horatio Riggs from the short story "Bad News" is a well-dressed man with a thick Southern accent and a gracious, good-humored manner. The "Southern" part outweighs the "gentleman", though, as his demeanor can quickly get colder (although still relatively civil) toward anyone who disagrees with his politics, which includes sitting around a saloon with a Confederate flag proudly displayed in it.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Lucas Buck masquerades as one in _American Gothic (1995)_.
-   In _Boston Legal_, the prosecuting attorney who argues against Alan Shore when he visits New Orleans.
-   Blanche's father, who was known as 'Big Daddy', on _The Golden Girls_. Interestingly enough, one episode reveals that he had a long-term relationship with a black woman.
-   Occasionally, on _Good Eats_, if the recipe has definite Southern roots (fried catfish, for example), Alton Brown will dress and speak like one of these, an Affectionate Parody of Col. Sanders. (Brown is, of course, from Georgia — and despite his studied neutral "General American" newscaster accent, he comes from true old Southern stock — "Ma Mae" Skelton, who appeared in his original biscuits episode, was his actual grandmother, and his recipe is an updated version of hers — and all its culinary traditions.)
-   The _Kirby Buckets_ episode "Kirby to the Max" has Kirby go to a maximum-security Saturday detention program run by a Southern Gentleman known only as "the Colonel". Turns out, the Colonel is actually a Faux Affably Evil Corrupt Corporate Executive in a white suit who forces students to compete in the "Tickle Pit", a for-profit underground fight club where people have to tickle each other until one of them laughs. If you lose, you instantly become less respected amongst your peers, while if you win, you're stuck competing in the pit until you lose. This makes the Colonel easily the most evil character on the entire show.
-   A couple of times, _The Nightly Show_ has poked fun at this trope. When discussing Mississippi's attempts to maintain a ban on gay adoption, Beechum Grady (played by Rory Albanese) personifies this role during an interview in which he explains Mississippi's "pro-yesterday" policies. This is later extended in a different segment about a state senator's Christmas cards featuring the Confederate flag that features an entire table full of Southern Gentlemen (including one who doesn't seem to realize slavery's been abolished) going over Christmas card designs that all feature Confederate flags, with Mike Yard playing the Only Sane Man at the table.
-   _The Peripheral (2022)_: Corbell Pickett, the drug lord who controls the small town of Clanton, very much _wants_ to be this, always being immaculately groomed (including, naturally, elaborate cowboy boots) and usually speaking in a friendly, fatherly tone. None of this changes the fact that he's a sadistic killer who is happy to crucify his enemies and mutilate his own men in public.
-   Don Johnson plays one of these as "Sir" in _A Series of Unfortunate Events (2017)_. The photo above is _not_ from that role, as he appears to have a penchant for this type.
-   _Sharpe_: Captain Leroy in _Sharpe's Eagle_ is an unusual example, being an American Loyalist fighting for Britain in the Napoleonic Wars. His family made its money on "slaves, cotton and molasses". The working-class Sharpe calls him out on the first of these near the end of the episode.
-   The _Sports Night_ episode "Six Southern Gentlemen of Tennessee" includes two characters discussing that this trope as it relates to the Confederate flag and the history of the south. When Isaac points out to Danny that their CEO, Luther Sachs, is a southerner who likes to consider _himself_ a Southern Gentleman. As Isaac puts it, "the difference, Danny, is all the difference"; the implication being that Sachs confuses his own wealth and elitism with the class and personal nobility that is associated with the trope.
-   Dr Leonard McCoy from _Star Trek: The Original Series_. Jerk with a Heart of Gold, genuinely compassionate and dedicated to his role as a healer, but also considerably more prejudiced than the other crew members, especially towards Spock and Vulcans in general. Played with when one considers that Spock gives back as good as he gets, McCoy engineered a way out for Spock when Spock was double-crossed by T'Pring in _Amok Time_, and the two of them would willingly sacrifice their lives for each other. Spock even goes so far as to leave his _katra_ in McCoy when he dies at the end of _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_ even though Scotty was also available.
    -   _Star Trek: Discovery_ brings us Captain Gabriel Lorca, who is a considerably nastier take on the trope, as a domineering and manipulative officer only interested in what people can do to help him achieve his goals.
-   Asmodeus, one of the Princes of Hell in _Supernatural_, likes to evoke the image. He wears an entirely white suit, has a well-trimmed beard, and speaks with a sophisticated southern accent. Dean refers to him as Evil Colonel Sanders.
-   Bill Compton from _True Blood_ is a variation, he's probably the most polite vampire ever.
-   Yancy Derringer, the gambler-hero of the western _Yancy Derringer_.

    Music 

-   Satirised in Tom Lehrer's "I Wanna Go Back To Dixie", from _Songs by Tom Lehrer_, where the phrase refers to the Ku Klux Klan:
    
    I wanna talk with southern gentlemen  
    And put my white sheet on again,  
    I ain't seen one good lynchin' in years!
    

    Puppetry 

-   The Southern Colonel from _The Muppets_.

    Radio 

-   Senator Beauregard Claghorn of Charleston, South Carolina from _The Fred Allen Show_; the character who would be the inspiration for Foghorn Leghorn. Most of Foghorn Leghorn's catchphrases (Like "That's a joke, son") originated with Senator Claghorn.

    Theatre 

-   Edward Rutledge of South Carolina in _1776_. His refined mannerisms are a veneer over his iron control of the Southern delegations, and he forces the removal of the Declaration of Independence's anti-slavery clause after singing the damning "Molasses to Rum," where he correctly points out that _Northerners_ are the ones sailing the slave ships.
-   Big Daddy for _Cat on a Hot Tin Roof_. Dignified, chivalrous, and autocratic.

    Video Games 

-   In _After the End: A Post-Apocalyptic America_, the evolution of this trope, combined with a dash of misremembered history, has led to the rise of a new knightly warrior elite in the post-apocalyptic American Southeast.
-   Sinclair from _BioShock 2_, one of the Voices With An Internet Connection who helps you throughout the game. Atlas from the first game was originally meant to be one, but they decided to make him Irish instead.
-   Wainwright Jakobs from _Borderlands 3_ plays this trope straight and goes against it in several ways. On the one hand, he speaks with a strong Southern accent (despite being from an alien planet), wears a light grey suit that looks like a white suit, runs a family business, and cares about tradition in both behavior and the guns he makes. On the other hand, Wainwright is not big on adventure and excitement, is a terrible shot, is eco-conscious, cares a lot about the well-being of his employees, and (most damning of all) is gay and dating a black guy.
-   Captain Keyes from _Halo_, though not explicitly said to be from the Southern United States, he fits this trope in his accent and manner of speaking.
-   Frank "Hitman" Hennessy from _Jagged Alliance_ is a friendly smooth sweet-talker and notorious for enjoying Charlene 'Raven' Higgens' company a tad too much for Ron "Raider" Higgens, her husband's liking.
-   In _L.A. Noire_, Dr. Harlan Fontaine speaks with a noticeable Southern accent and is a polite, sophisticated, highly respected member of society. He's actually a Faux Affably Evil Villain with Good Publicity who's part of a Big Bad Duumvirate.
-   _Mafia III_: Remy Duvall, the leader of the Southern Union, has a public persona as a businessman and radio host. On his program, he comes across as a charming and avuncular fellow, if you ignore his blatant racism and classism. As the player tears down his criminal empire, the gentleman act goes out the window and he reveals himself to be a vicious madman.
-   John Marston of _Red Dead Redemption_, despite being a former outlaw, can actually fit into this trope, with the clothing being the only other concern (in which case, you could put him in the gambler outfit or the duster).
-   Arcturus Mengsk of _Starcraft_ is portrayed as one, with him going so far as to wear clothes resembling a CSA general's outfit. Ironically, the corrupt government he overthrows (only to replace as equally-corrupt) is called the Confederacy, and its flag looks exactly like you'd think.
    -   Mengsk's right-hand man and former Confederate general, Edmund Duke, also has a touch of this trope.
-   Clem from _The Suffering_.
-   Calm, polite, multiple PhD-having Engineer from _Team Fortress 2_.

    Webcomics 

-   Colonel Sassacre of _Homestuck_, as a Mark Twain Expy, fits this trope.
-   John Henry Hunter of _Next Town Over_ certainly has the trappings of this trope.

    Web Video 

-   In his "Groundhog Day Explained" video CGP Grey tells about Georgia's resident groundhog seasonal predictor "General Beauregard Lee, who one must assume has stylish facial hair and fans himself on the veranda of his plantation home while drinking mint julep and pining for the day when the South will rise again."

    Western Animation 

-   Foghorn Leghorn is a parody of such.
-   Gilbert Dauterieve, Bill's cousin on _King of the Hill_ is a parody, with the added twist of being Ambiguously Gay. Modeled on Tennessee Williams.
-   Colonel Shuffle from the _Looney Tunes_ shorts "Mississippi Hare" and "Dog Gone South". "Ah, magnolia!"
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   The unnamed Southern Colonel, the last person cocky Homer challenges to a duel in _The Simpsons_ episode "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)".
    -   In "Homer vs. The Eighteenth Amendment", Southern gentlemen request bootleg mint juleps at Moe's Speakeasy.

    Real Life 

-   Colonel Sanders cultivated a Southern Gentleman persona for the latter part of his life, and this image now adorns KFC materials all over the place.
-   You'd be hard-pressed to find a version that's more recognizable or admirable than Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain.
-   During The American Civil War, one Union general invoked this trope to protect his written orders from spies: he sealed them in a fancy envelope, daubed them with perfume, and had them signed by a female hand. His orders were reportedly never intercepted, because he'd guessed correctly that no southern gentleman would _dare_ be so uncouth as to open, never mind _read_, a lady's love-letter.
