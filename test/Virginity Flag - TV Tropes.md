Where a person's virginity or absence thereof can be confirmed by some sort of sign or symbol immediately visible on them (that is to say, definitely not requiring a gynecological examination<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ). This can work through magic, Applied Phlebotinum, or simply social convention.

It's the Sister Trope of Bloodstained Defloration.

Compare Did You Just Have Sex?, Nerds Are Virgins (nerdiness as a Virginity Flag), Sex Dressed, Virginity Makes You Stupid, Virgin Power, Virgin in a White Dress (clothing as an actual or alleged Virginity Flag), Virgin Vision (the unjustified form of this).

    Anime & Manga 

-   Reika from _Futari Ecchi_ can just tell if a person is a virgin or has already had sexual intercourse by merely looking at them. This allowed her to know instantly that Old Maid Kyoko is still a virgin and Shoko was experienced, though still shocked because she was more concerned about such a young-looking girl to be at a bar.
-   Everyone in the world of _Loveless_ has kitty ears and a tail that fall off when they lose their virginity. This connection is conveyed through social cues within the story, and exactly what point defines 'the outer border of virginity' is never really defined. For all the sexually charged atmosphere, the lead is a twelve-year-old boy. A grown woman with ears is teased about still having hers, and having already _lost_ their ears is a sign of some enemy characters' pitiful depravity, but the wider social implications, for example in high school or religious orders, aren't explored, with the most it's addressed being one female high school age character having fake ears that she wears in public.
-   _Hellsing_: Played with. When a vampire fatally drains an opposite-sex human and that human is a virgin, s/he also becomes a vampire. If not, s/he becomes a ghoul. While this makes it easy to tell which opposite-sex victims were virgins or not after the fact, most vampires can't tell which humans are virgins or not before they drink. This leads to some vampires who don't want to sire children (like the starter villain) personally ensuring that their meal is a non-virgin before drinking. Millennium-made vampires are different in that drained victims can only become ghouls whether the victim was virgin or not (something Hellsing learned from victims who were far too young to have sex lives).
-   _Fairy Tail_: Larcade's Brown Note ability has no effect on virgins...unless he specifically focuses it on one person.

    Comic Strips 

-   The creator of Dilbert can’t exactly announce when the titular character has sex thanks to newspaper censors, but he explained to curious fans that he’d show it in-universe by drawing Dilbert's tie uncharacteristically limp.

    Fan Works 

    Films — Live-Action 

    Literature 

-   In the SF shared world of Medea, the resident alien females _lose a pair of legs_ after having sex.
-   In Madeleine L'Engle's _Many Waters_, only "innocents" can ride unicorns. (Otherwise, they disappear.)
-   In _Nineteen Eighty-Four_, a scarlet sash is the emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, which advocates celibacy.
    -   Invoked by one of the protagonists, who while wearing it has slept with plenty of men, and simply wears it to _act_ like the good patriotic Party member
-   In Mercedes Lackey's _Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms_, unicorns are attracted to virgins of the opposite sex. This can cause...complications when someone does not want their virginity (or gender) disclosed. (It doesn't help that unicorns — rather dim under most circumstances — turn into squealing wrecks in the presence of a virgin, meaning that there's really no way to keep it quiet).
-   In _The Bible_, after King David's daughter Tamar is raped by her half-brother Amnon, the poor girl tears her garment that was reserved for the King's virgin daughters. Her full brother Absolom immediately realizes what happened when he sees her, and it does NOT end well for Amnon.
-   The thranx of the _Humanx Commonwealth_ look a lot like giant praying mantids. Unlike praying mantids, male thranx only lose their vestigial wings the first time they have sex.
-   _Song at Dawn_ It is customary for a bride to wear her hair up after consummating her marriage (i.e. losing her virginity.) Estela doesn't do it after her marriage because John isn't interested in doing it with her. Instead, she does it after a traumatic experience with a stable hand that she doesn't want to admit to herself was a mistake.
-   In _The Black Company_ short story "Tides Elba", the city's religion the company is stationed in includes that women permanently shave off all the hair below their neckline after losing their virginity. The Black Company being a mercenary outfit full of men with too much time on their hands, this gets discussed at length.
-   In _The Red Tent_, it's mentioned that among the Canaanite wives that Jacob's sons took, the morning after the wedding night, the mother of the bride would run into the tent and steal the bloodstained blanket <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , to save just in case Jacob wanted "proof" that the bride was a virgin (and therefore that he had paid a fair price for her). The women of Padan-Aram think this is Squick, and their Ritual of Opening is designed to make it so that there won't be a bloodstain so no one will know whether they're virgins or not and judge their worth by that.
-   In the world of _Touch,_ sex causes people to get a dark patch around one eye called the Mark of Purity. Since the protagonist is a twelve-year-old boy dealing with the aftermath of being raped, this obviously presents a problem if he doesn't want to advertise his issues to the world. When we first meet him he's covering it with his mother's makeup, and he talks to his therapist about options like skin-tone patches or cosmetic surgery. The therapist notes that even under normal circumstances the Mark's appearance can be pretty awkward.
-   In _The Handmaid's Tale_, "Daughters", that is, the virgin daughters of Gilead's wealthy men, who will one day be given in Arranged Marriages to other wealthy men, wear white dresses, to show that they are virgins.
-   As a variant, in _Always Coming Home_, taking on a sexual partner is the stage where a person starts wearing dyed clothing.
-   In _Heaven Official’s Blessing: Tian Guan Ci Fu_, Jun Wu has a magic sword that repels the blood of virgins. He uses it to help Xie Lian prove that he cannot possibly be the father of Lan Chang's child.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the fourth series of _Misfits_, there's a minor character who has the power to make the number of sexual partners a person has had appear on that person's forehead. How the power defines sex for this purpose is not fully specified — but judging from the effect on characters with known sexual histories, receiving oral sex apparently doesn't count.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: In "Teacher's Pet", the mantis demon prefers to mate with virginal human males (and bite their heads off, pursuant to mantid custom). Her targets include a jock who, after rescue, threatens to sue if word gets out.
-   _Angel_. In a flashback scene, evil vampire Angelus is able to tell that three sisters are virgins just by looking at them. As one of the sisters is a seer, she turns to look at him in horror. It's Drusilla, the woman he will turn into a vampire after driving her insane by slaughtering her family.
-   _Motherland: Fort Salem_: Literally. All witches have a birthmark-esque mark on them that turns shiny once they've had sex.

    Music Videos 

-   The fan-made video for TISM’s “Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me” with everyone’s number of either sexual partners or number of sexual escapades written on their shirts. And yep, there’s one poor fellow with a “0” on there. And one with “3.5”.

    Tabletop Games 

-   A variation in _Ravenloft_, where women in one multicultural area use hairscarves to denote whether they're single or married. Problem is, one culture uses scarves to indicate singlehood and another indicates marriage, leading to a lot of brawls.
-   _Starfinder_: Ikeshti that fail to mate during their once in a lifetime rutting season transform into large, muscular, and mindless "riveners" that other Ikeshti consider kill-on-sight.

    Theater 

-   In _Me and My Dick_, the virginal Sally's Miss Cooter wears a flower prominently, since she has yet to be "de-flowered".

    Web Comics 

-   The strip called "Preserves" of _The Perry Bible Fellowship_.

    Western Animation 

-   While not outright stated (it _is_ a kids' show), _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ had a scene where Sokka comes out of his tent in the morning wearing a flower lei Suki had been wearing the previous night (and he had been seen in a Ready for Lovemaking pose). So he got lei'd, she got deflowered, geddit?
