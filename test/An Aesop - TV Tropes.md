## This trope is under discussion in the Trope Repair Shop.

_"I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit."  
"Perhaps it hasn't one," Alice ventured to remark.  
"Tut, tut, child!" said the Duchess. "Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it."_

The episode ends with a moral _à la_ _Aesop's Fables_. Either the last line of the episode summarizes the whole point of the episode, or it leaves the viewer with the issue that the writers want them to ponder. 1950s sitcoms often end on the "Gee, I learned my lesson," type of moral, while _Law & Order_ leaves you pondering. Since some shows seem to contractually require one moral per episode, you often end up with a Broken Aesop.

A lot of kids' shows go out of their way for this, especially Disney-animated shows. Writers often call it the "Object Lesson", and write the episode around it. This is particularly noticeable in programs made in The United States during the late 1970s through the early 1990s, as the FCC at the time<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  required that all networks airing children's television broadcast a certain amount of "educational" content, and this was the simplest way to meet its requirements.

What's more, this trope can also make various media like shows and so on, become an immersive experience in giving helpful advice to the audience, which makes it very popular and very unique in terms of use.

For times when a lesson is learned through a moral conflict, see Moral Dilemma.

In some quarters An Aesop delivered to another character, often a child, directly is referred to as a "You See, Timmy" from the frequent use of that line to deliver the Aesop in the television show _Lassie_. This definition was put forth originally in the movie _Speechless_.

Ironically, the Greek storyteller Aesop probably doesn't deserve the dubious honor of having this trope named after him. In their original forms these stories likely did _not_ end with heavy-hitting moral anvils. The listeners (for Aesop would have been an oral storyteller) were probably left to sort out the meaning for themselves; the one-liner morals (such as "slow and steady wins the race") were likely tacked on by modern compilers, and were often used as rhetorical devices by later orators to make a point. Highlighting a moral truth is indeed, however, one of the main characteristics of the Fable, which for centuries have taught lessons to live by through allegories, often using animals and other non-human characters. These short tales can teach how to see through deceit, lead with difficult situations, not be overtook by arrogance etc., but they almost always have a value arised from the story.

An Aesop is among the Tropes of Legend. Almost every work can be considered to have an Aesop, so only put series-wide examples, or examples that have no sub-trope here.
