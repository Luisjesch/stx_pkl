The more the merrier.

_"What are you?"  
"I'm an otter."  
"And what do you do?"  
"I swim around on my back and do cute little human things with my hands."  
"You're free to go."_

Otters are rather funny-looking animals, what with their long, slender bodies, cute faces, and the way they crack clamshells on their bellies. But what makes them even more adorable, is their playful demeanor. Otters often wrestle, slide and play with their food — actually, they mostly use those fun activities as a way to improve their survival tactics. But still, it's a fun way to do it!

When used in fiction, otter characters are usually Fun Personified. They are usually depicted as playful, energetic, kind-hearted, optimistic and laid-back, sometimes even mischievous. Otters spend a lot of time in water, so expect them to be good swimmers, who love to have fun in water. Sometimes this overlaps with Surfer Dude (but otters are usually much more clever, rarely The Ditz). Often there can be a playful antagonism with beavers such as the boistrous otters getting in the way of the workaholic rodents engaged in their usual serious labors.

To recap, if an otter is portrayed in fiction with a joyous, playful or mischievous personality, it's this trope. Truth in Television, except for the Surfer Dude part.

Also, they sound like squeaky toys.

Compare Sweet Seal, Warm-Hearted Walrus, Weasel Mascot, and Frisky Ferret.

## Examples of this trope:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Episode 2 of the _Kemono Friends_ anime gives us Small-clawed Otter, who employs this trope in full. She's an otter, she plays with everything she can get her hands on, tries to find the fun in everything they're doing, among other things that make her a full-blown otter.
-   In _Killing Bites_, Yui Okawa is an otter beastwoman who runs an eating show channel on Youtube. She's cheerful, ditzy and energetic, but enters the King of Killing Bites tournament to eat the other competitors as she fights them. Faced with a giant alligator-man, she suffers from incontinence out of _happiness_ and keeps getting distracted while striking goofy poses but outwits him at every turn and chokes him out cold after further transforming into a psychotic-looking _Siamogale melilutra_ giant otter.
    
    _"Killing Bites is much tougher than I figured. At least it lived up to the promise of a live all-you-can-eat buffet. I imagine my subscriber count has exploded by now. \*makes a "Silly Me" Gesture\* Somehow, this is very Meshiuma TV~!\]\]"_
    
-   Mr. 13 of _One Piece_ subverts this trope. He's a small brown otter in sunglasses and a white onesie with purple spots... who also happens to be an agent of the criminal organization Baroque Works. He's at his most dangerous with his two bladed shell weapons and his partner the violent vulture Ms. Friday at his side.

    Card Games 

    Film — Animated 

-   _Animalympics_ features among its athletes a Surfer Dude otter named Dean Wilson. His chosen style in freestyle swimming involves surfing on his own tail, and he turns springboard diving into a Disney Acid Sequence. Fer shyuuuure!
-   _Finding Dory_: Towards the end of the film, Marlin, Nemo and friends enlists the help of a bunch of friendly otters to start a "cuddle party" in the middle of the streets, in order to stop the Marine Institute's Transport from taking Dory away. It works.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The 1969 film _Ring Of Bright Water_ features an executive (Bill Travers, of _Born Free_ fame) whose life is transformed when he acquires a pet otter, Mij. This otter is rather mischievous and adventurous, which leads to many adventures.

    Folklore and Mythology 

-   In Japanese folklore, otters are capable of shapeshifting and performing other tricks to play pranks on humans, much like Kitsune and Tanuki.

    Literature 

-   The absolutely adorable (and mischievous) fenlings of _The Belgariad_.
-   The Mad House of Otter in _The Book of the Dun Cow_ are careless, sloppy enemies of the fierce but courageous weasels.
-   The protagonists of _Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas_ are of course, otters, who are playful and kind-hearted folks, and sing really well to boot. The Jim Henson puppet adaptation is a Christmas special with a huge following.
-   Otter of the _Franklin_ books and Animated Adaptation is shown as being this.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_ Hermione learns her patronus takes this form when she manages to produce a corporeal one and it happily bounds around the room.
-   In Hector Hugh Munroe (aka "Saki")'s short story, "Laura," the merry-hell-raising heroine is reincarnated as an otter, and continues to raise merry hell.
-   When Mercer Mayer created the _Little Critter_ Spin-Off _LC and the Critter Kids_, one of the critter kids was a Surfer Dude otter named Slick Rick (no, not _that_ Rick).
-   _Oona_: Oona's closest friend is Otto, an otter she saved from an oyster net when he was a pup. Otto accompanies Oona on her treasure hunts, and knows tricks such as sit, roll over, walrus (where he stuffs long objects in his mouth to look like walrus tusks), and pufferfish (where he holds his breath and swells up his cheeks).
-   Every book in the _Redwall_ series features several otters. Usually led by one named Skipper, they tend to dress and talk like local Seafaring People. The Redwall wiki describes them as playful. The most playful one would probably be Cheek from _Mattimeo_. They also have a penchant for using ambushes and javelins, and are absolutely _not_ to be trifled with. Of the various good species, otters are probably the third most dangerous (after badgers and hares).
-   _Ring of Bright Water_ again; the original autobiographical book by Gavin Maxwell, who also wrote a children's version called _The Otter's Story_. Incidentally, Mijbil turned out to be a previously unknown subspecies, now known as Maxwell's Smooth-Coated Otter, or _Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli_.
-   In the Norwegian children's book series _Samson & Roberto,_ in which the cast is comprised of Funny Animals, one of the main characters is a female otter named Olli, who works as the resident repairwoman — at least when she's not fooling around and acting hyper and silly just for the hell of it. She is a supreme repairwoman, though.
-   Mudge, the Loveable Rogue in the _Spellsinger_ novels, and (in later books) his family. In one book it's mentioned that one otter can focus on something serious for a while, but two or more otters is a permanent party.
-   _The Treasure Tree_ is the name of a book showing the four personality distinctions of (roughly) Leader, Scientist, People Person, and Fun Guy. These are shown with the animals of, respectively, Lion, Beaver, Golden Retriever, and Otter.
-   Kylie in _Windfall_ has her moments, though the trope is more often reserved for her younger cousins.
-   _The Wind in the Willows_: Otter is probably the Trope Codifier, always willing to lend a hand and always friendly except if you screw over his friends as a rabbit found out when he was braving the wildwood. The only other character to brave the wildwood is Badger.
-   In the _Winnie-the-Pooh_ book _Return to the Hundred Acre Wood_, the only new character is an otter named Lottie, who was described in a preview article as "feisty".

    Live-Action TV 

-   Pip and Pop, the rather playful otter duo from _Bear in the Big Blue House_.
-   The uncut version of the _MythBusters_ episode "Ping Pong Ball Flotation" featured a scene where the progression of the attempt to raise the sunken boat was slowed further when a nearby otter swam up into the boat and stole one of the ping pong balls.

    Radio 

-   _Linda Smith's A Brief History of Timewasting_ has urban otters colonizing London. Their natural cheekiness has developed into criminal behavior such as pickpocketing and blagging money by claiming to be a neighbor who was locked out of the house.
-   _Cabin Pressure_: As per the Alphabetical Theme Naming of each episode, Douglas, Martin and Arthur find themselves visiting Ottery St. Mary, and, as per the Running Gag, start playing games to entertain themselves — namely, trying to work out how many otters they could use to fill up their plane. That said, the "playful" aspect is played with in a story Douglas makes up to impress Arthur: he claims that the Saint Mary the eponymous town is named after was consumed alive by wild otters, but in the more modern, family-friendly artistic depictions, the otters are just gathering around her feet lovingly.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Mystara_ has the Jorries, otters with fish-like tails. While sapient, they're described as generally behaving like ordinary otters, relaxing in fair weather and frolicking in storms. They tend to have a good rapport with sailors, and come to the rescue of those in danger on the open sea.

    Video Games 

-   _Jak and Daxter_ has Daxter who was turned into an Ottsel (half otter, half weasel). He's a funny bumbling sidekick and a major Butt-Monkey whenever he gets a bit annoying.
-   Oshawott, the water starter in _Pokémon Black and White_ and the sequels. Although it does fight if attacked, it still has a playful side as well. Its evolutions, Dewott and Saumurott, avert it, because they're tougher and stronger and not playful.
    -   Buizel and Floatzel, introduced in _Pokémon Diamond and Pearl_, are also based on otters with a bit of weasel thrown in.
-   Digital Media had a line of games starring an excitable young cartoon sea otter named Ozzie and a gang of other international critters. Their games were mainly used to teach children about foreign culture (the _Ozzie's Travels_ line, but there were other games in the field as well, including a science one and an environment one.
-   _Spyro: A Hero's Tail_: Spyro meets an otter Surfer Dude who needs his help to refill a drained pond with water so he can surf again.
-   _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_ has the Juggle Pup and R&R Seal Dream Eaters, who are a otter-seal mixture with gambling as their theme. They're always happy chaps who treat the battlefield as a game, and their Limit Break has them and Sora play a game of dice.
-   Sylas in _Armello_ is an inversion of the archetype. In a game that is already easy to describe as "_A Song of Ice and Fire_ but with cartoon animals instead", Sylas the otter has by far the darkest backstory, which has left him as a hollow, hateful husk motivated solely by a desire to murder the one responsible for his cruel fate.
-   Amar from _Mythic Ocean_ is an otter-like deity of joy and friendship, with the playfulness, cheer, and bit of a well-meaningly mischievous streak one would expect from a god with their domains.

    Webcomics 

-   Matt, the Dogged Nice Guy of _Hodges Pond_.
-   Bayshore from _Dogs Days Of Summer_.
-   A Sunday strip of _Kevin & Kell_ showed an otter doing a boring office job, with the punchline that this was his _vacation_ from being a Playful Otter.
-   Scrambles the Tequila Monster from _Questionable Content_, an alcohol induced hallucination that haunts the cast in the form of a giant purple otter.

    Web Animation 

-   _Happy Tree Friends_: Russell the sea otter started out as an inversion of this, keeping to himself and rarely interacting with other characters. As time progressed, however, he became more social and joined in on fun activities every now and then.

    Western Animation 

-   _Doki_: Fico the otter is described as the "wild card" of the main cast.
-   In _Franklin_ there is a female otter named Otter, who is friends with Franklin and characterized as a silly, fun-loving goof.

-   The animated series version of _Little Bear_ has a group of playful otters that show up occasionally.
