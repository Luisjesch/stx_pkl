_"From the night of Brad's stage dive. All of a sudden, I'm getting electromagnetic readings up the wazoo. For some reason, it's a legit haunting now."_

When they're not tormenting humans or scaring pets, ghosts are interfering with technology, appearing on video screens, making radios and TVs crackle and playing with the lights. Alongside cold spots, EM interference is one of the "recognized" signs of a haunting. One variation, known as EVP (electronic voice phenomena), specifically involves anomalous voices or other sounds on electronic audio recordings. Ghosts also appear on camcorder screens, night vision cameras, and of course, infrared cameras.

An electromagnetic ghost may be a Walking Techbane if the interference is strong enough.

Not to be confused with Virtual Ghost (which is a "ghost" projected by technological means); Haunted Technology, (when the ghost is actually inhabiting a machine); or Ghost in the Machine (which is nothing to do with ghosts at all). This trope covers any supernatural activity that makes electrical systems malfunction as a side effect of their presence.

Compare Magic Harms Technology, when magical forces rather than supernatural creatures is the cause of technological interference.

    Advertising 

-   A commercial for Esurance implies this. A man is walking past a house at night and sees all of the lights flashing and believes that something terrible is coming. In truth, the family is out to eat and the son is playing with a light control app on his parents' smartphone.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _White Noise_ is about "electromagnetic voice phenomena", where voices from beyond appear on audio and video recordings.
-   In _The Sixth Sense_, Bruce Willis's character discovers the ghosts actually exist when he can hear them on a tape recorder.
-   _The Innkeepers_ has Claire and Luke using recording equipment to pick up EVP and find the ghost that they think is haunting the hotel.
-   The 2010 movie _Ghost from the Machine_ (_Phasma Ex Machina_) has the protagonist build a device that creates an intense electromagnetic field in order to bring ghosts closer to the land of the Living, in an attempt to resurrect his dead parents. However, it also brings back his neighbor's dead wife, and the psychotic murderer/suicide who used to own his house...
-   In _Poltergeist (1982)_, the ghost researchers use this sort of equipment to monitor the ghostly activities in the house. After one supernatural occurrence, one of them even notes "It's electrical - you can smell the charge."
-   Samara Morgan in the 2002 adaptation of _The Ring_ imprints images on a blank videotape (cursing it in the process) and can manipulate televisions when someone's week is up, up to and including emerging from the screen. Before her death, she had similar abilities to psychically imprint images on electromagnetic film. In fact, unlike the original Japanese version which includes weird stuff like communicating with germs, _all_ Samara's powers seem to be magnetism-based. Tampering with videos and surveillance cameras, levitating metal objects, even causing fatal seizures are things that can be done with sufficiently precise EM waves.
-   _The Frighteners_: When the ghosts haunt a house, light flickers and objects move by themselves.
-   In _Scarecrow Slayer_, the presence of the Scarecrow causes mobile phones to fill with static and stop functioning.
-   The ghost in _Lemon Tree Passage_ interferes with electronics; causing Sam's car radio to start blaring, switch channels, turn off, etc.
-   In _Savaged_, Zoe's presence at the mine causes the lights to flicker and various pieces of machinery to malfunction.
-   In _The Gravedancers_, the presence of the ghosts in the mansion causes the lights to surge and dim wildly.
-   In _Our House_, the ghosts are sometimes presaged by flickering lights and interference with the TV displays. Then again, as often as not, it's the fault of Ethan's machine, which has tremendous power requirements.
-   _Come Play_: Larry's presence tends to short-circuit all the lights in the area, since he needs power to sustain his presence in this world.
-   _Eternal_: When Wildcat drives on to the ground of Elizabeth's mansion, the radio in her car suddenly cuts out.
-   _Don't Listen_: When the ghostof the witch who was executed 300 years ago begins haunting, electronic devices tend to get screwy, like the child psychologist's radio flickering before the ghost possesses her and kills her. There's also Eric hearing his by-then-dead son's voice calling for help in a recorded message he sent to his wife.

    Literature 

-   _Johnny Maxwell Trilogy_: In _Johnny and the Dead_, the Dead are able to manipulate, damage, or generally mess around with radios, telephones, televisions, arcade games, jukeboxes, computer networks, satellites, and radio telescopes. Justified because one of them was an electronics genius in life, while another is Albert Einstein's distant cousin.
-   Tim Powers is fond of this trope.
    -   In his trilogy that consists of _Last Call_, _Expiration Date_, and _Earthquake Weather_, ghosts can cause interference with compasses, call people up on phones and appear on TV talk shows (at least, on the version being watched by the person they're haunting) to gain important information.
    -   In _Alternate Routes_, ghosts can make their voices heard on radios and their faces appear in the static on an untuned analog TV set (although since the story is set after the switch to digital TV signals, the only character who _has_ an analog TV set is a ghost peddler who keeps an old one around specifically for communicating with ghosts with).
-   In Richard Matheson's _Hell House_, the haunting is _literally_ electromagnetic, as ghosts are essentially an energy field which survives the death of the body. As a consequence, they can be destroyed by a good, hard degaussing unless they are protected in some fashion.
-   The ghost from _The Haunted Air_ makes a clock radio's LED display run in reverse, and causes a television to show programming from The '80s twenty years later, even when it's unplugged and had its internal components removed.
-   In the Latin-American horror novel _Ghost Radio_, the protagonist Joaquin runs a radio station where people can call in and describe ghost stories on the air. His dead friend Gabriel gets to him mid-broadcast through one of these calls, and messes with him in general by hijacking phone lines, making televisions show him strange imagery, and eventually causes him to visually hallucinate what Joaquin's callers are describing, all out of spite for how Joaquin survived multiple near-fatal accidents that Gabriel did not. Gabriel comments at one point that radio is a major conduit for spirits to reach the human world.
-   In _The Night's Dawn Trilogy_, the Possessed — human souls returning from death via Demonic Possession — disrupt any nearby 27th century equipment. When the Possessed take over a planet, they must rely on archaic mid-20th century technology as modern equipment ceases functioning or is bugged beyond usability.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Ghosts (US)_: Thorfinn was killed by a lightning strike, so he can make the lights flicker.
-   Robin the caveman, the above's UK counterpart, can do the same thing although it hasn't been explained why. It does require conscious effort on his part, however, rather than his presence alone.
-   In _Supernatural_, ghosts and other supernatural beings can cause electromagnetic interference by flickering lights and making them explode.
    -   When not causing interference, normally invisible ghosts show up on camcorder screens and the EMF detectors used by ghost hunters.
-   Averted in _The Stone Tape_ despite the wide array of electronic equipment used to study the ghost. Eventually the scientists realize what they hear and feel is the brain's reaction to whatever is imprinted into the walls; this is why some people are more sensitive to paranormal phenomena than others.
-   In _The Sarah Jane Adventures_ serial _The Eternity Trap_, this is exploited to detect the presence of ghosts more scientifically, and prove the house really is haunted. Although - as Sarah Jane is quick to point out - they aren't technically ghosts. (Or at least, that's how it seems until the final moments of the episode...)
-   Of a sort in _Ghost Wars_ in that the ghosts in question are warded off by electricity of any sort.

    Music Videos 

-   The song and music video for "White Noise" by PVRIS are about a frustrated ghost that wants to communicate with the living but can't do anything other than cause interference.
    
    _It's hard to be what you need through a static screen  
    Been trying to speak for weeks and weeks  
    Open my mouth, all that comes out  
    Is white noise and incomprehensible sound  
    And all you ever do is turn me down_
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Geist: The Sin-Eaters_ affords ghosts several Numina that allow them to do this, such as Ghost Sign (imprint a message in a medium) or Left-Handed Spanner (make technology go haywire). As such, several Sin-Eaters have necromantic Ceremonies that rely on these tropes, like Spectral Photography (take a photograph of an area, get a glimpse of the most dynamic ghost activity that happened in the last few days) and Dead Voices on Air (leave a specially-prepared camera behind, and it will capture whatever ghostly activity occurs in the meantime).
-   _Orpheus_ gives characters the Shade Haunter, which allows them to create and control electronic interference as part of their abilities.
-   Exaggerated (or drawn to the logical conclusion) in _Blades in the Dark_: _all_ ghosts are electromagnetic phenomena, by the virtue of ectoplasm (or rather "_electro_plasm") always carrying electric charge in this setting, which its residents have learned to exploit in order to launch an industrial revolution.

    Video Games 

-   In response to a supernatural event in _F.E.A.R._, the lights go wild (most of the time they just flicker, but in some instances, they overload and shatter or just mysteriously break), your radio crackles and "unknown origin" is shown as the source of the transmission. Alma also appears on monitors occasionally, like a visual equivalent of an EVP. Her contractions cause an EMP like effect in _F.E.A.R. 3_.
-   While most supernaturalness in _Dead Space_ and _Dead Space 2_ is inside Isaacs head _something_ is interfering with RIG transmissions.
-   Many of the powers in _Ghost Master_ are electrical in nature such as Blow Fuse, Blackout, Wild & Crazy, and Strange Behaviour. Technology is also one the 'fetters' or places ghosts can be anchored.
-   The ghosts of dead miners in _Kentucky Route Zero_ appear as flickering images through the sparking of the electrical rail, but only if the lights are off.
-   _Silent Hill_
    -   A staple of the series is a pocket radio that, while seemingly dead, blasts out static in the presence of monsters. At certain points in certain games, it can pick up mysterious broadcasts.
    -   In _Silent Hill: Shattered Memories_, you can only see ghosts by looking at them with Harry's cell phone camera, and "echo memories" — lingering traces of emotionally-charged events — cause the phone to give off weird static and feedback.
-   In _Sengoku Basara 3_, Oichi has a similar "static effect" sometimes when she speaks, in a reference to this phenomenon.
-   Taping EVPs and scanning for electromagnetic signs of ghosts is a crucial part of _The Lost Crown: A Ghost-Hunting Adventure_.
-   Played in all 3 _Dark Fall_ games. In the first one, sometimes ghosts talk to you through the reception phone, Polly and Nigel's surveillance system occasionally flickers into showing dark splotches, or how various rooms appeared in the past. And distorted audio files on their computer can be edited to reveal voices. The second, _Lights Out_ has an old World War 2 radio that's been rumored to be haunted, and tuning it to a certain frequency and using ghost-hunting goggles reveals an evil voice talking to you. A haunted TV appears in _Dark Fall: Lost Souls_, displaying cryptic images that provide clues to the code for the ring mechanism.
-   Happens in _AMBER: Journeys Beyond_, complete with gadgets to track what happens. Two examples center around a TV in the master bedroom. At one point, a camera in the room shows a ball of white light coming out of the TV and morphing into a key, dropping itself into a drawer. Then, if you actually use the TV, it shows a creepy POV shot of someone running through the house, screaming and eventually coming up the stairs and knocking you out.
-   All ghosts in the _The Blackwell Series_, including Joey, can interfere with radio-based devices simply by getting close to them. This is crucial to solving several puzzles throughout the games. Also Rosa notes that she had to install cable just so she could watch TV with Joey around.
-   The "ghosts" from _Oxenfree_ speak through heavily distorted radio messages, and their control over time causes ominous visual glitches. Tuning the radio finds new broadcasts from them and forces them out of possessed characters. It's played with, as they're not _technically_ ghosts (and they themselves mock the term) but the crew of nuclear submarine that was transported to another dimension after its destruction.
-   Detecting electromagnetic disturbances ghosts generate around them with an EMF meter is a significant part of investigations in _Conrad Stevenson's Paranormal P.I._, and strange EMF readings can be used to 'track' ghosts. Manifested entities will also sap battery power from your equipment if you try to walk through them.
-   While White Face from _Imscared_ is never stated whether to be a ghost or not, it does have the appearance and behavior of one. And it does interfere with technology; your computer.
-   The ghosts in the _Fatal Frame_ series tend to cause radios, tape players, televisions, telephones or other kind of electronics to act up.
-   The EMF reader in _Phasmophobia_ is used to detect ghost activity. Higher levels mean a stronger presence and more activity, and only the most aggressive ghost types can trigger a level 5 reading. All types of ghost can make lights flicker and turn radios and TVs off and on, and they will always make your flashlight flicker when they're about to hunt. In addition, certain types of ghost can respond to your questions on the Spirit Box, an FM radio device that can pick up ghost speech. Raiju in particular interact very dangerously with any electronics in the area: They'll react every time, be it the lights in the room or your own equipment (which makes them easier to track), but the Raiju will react as well, moving faster and being much more eager to hunt you down.
-   Signibble from _Yo-kai Watch_ is a mischievous Mysterious Tribe Yokai who likes to mess with cell phone reception and change the channels on TV sets.
-   _JR's_: If the ghost is possessing an animatronic, the camera they're on may begin flickering. The animatronic's stability counter in the control panel can also start glitching out.

    Web Animation 

-   Lewis from _Mystery Skulls Animated_ has caused the group's van to shut down at least twice and unknowingly shocked Arthur through his metal prosthetic arm when Arthur tired some desperate percussive maintenance. Not that Lewis would mind electrocuting Arthur since his goal since coming back seems to be murdering him.
-   _The Cyanide & Happiness Show_ had one scene in "Now That's What I Call Spooky" where wrestler ghosts can only be shown infrared thermal camera screens and are invisible to night vision cameras.

    Web Original 

-   _The Magnus Archives_:
    -   It is implied that this is why the "bizarre" statements (i.e. all the ones the audience hears) come out distorted when the archivist tries to record them on a computer, so he has to use an old tape recorder. Some of those making statements seem to have come across similar distortion.
    -   In the episode "Growing Dark" it is hinted that something supernatural is causing the lights to stop working in the narrator's girlfriend's flat. They replace the bulbs, check the fittings and call in an electrician but can find nothing apparently wrong. Then subverted when it turns out not to be supernatural, merely bizarre - someone (presumably his girlfriend's strange flatmate) keeps unscrewing all the bulbs just enough to break the connections.
-   The Slender Man is often shown to muck up electronic equipment, causing static, audio and visual distortion, missing frames, added frames, and general horror. A video camera is also a way to see him when he is otherwise invisible. In _Marble Hornets_, trying to film him tends to make it worse.
-   Jay Are's backpack in _The Adventures of the League of S.T.E.A.M._ is supposedly a device for picking up EVPs.

    Webcomics 

    Western Animation 

-   The _Adventure Time_ episode "Beyond This Earthly Realm" has Finn getting stuck in the Spirit World, where it seems he can't interact with anything in the physical plane and no one can even see him but Ice King, who has "wizard eyes", then gets stuck there itself. It turns out they _can_ effect things subtly, which Finn discovers when he moves around near a television and sees the static start to change.
-   In the _SpongeBob SquarePants_ episode "Graveyard Shift", Squidward tells SpongeBob the story of the Hash Slinging Slasher to scare him. He tells him that there are three signs heralding the arrival of the Slasher, and the first one is the lights turning on and off. Later, the lights at the Krusty Krab do start to turning on and off, which Squidward at first dismisses as cheap wiring, but then the other two signs occur, and a mysterious figure approaches the door. Fortunately, it's just the night fry cook Krabs had just hired, but that didn't explain the lights. Then they see the real culprit: Nosferatu.
