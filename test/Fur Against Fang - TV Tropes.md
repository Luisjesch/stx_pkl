**Crange:** Werewolf don't look good on a resumé?  
**Utarefson:** Not for vampires, dude! The vampire has always had an enemy in the lycanthrope.  
**Crange:** Like _what_ throat? (SFX: wap!)

In many ways, the legends of werewolves and vampires spring from similar sources, but modern popular fiction has fleshed them out, made them into _species_, and given them cultural traits.

-   Werewolves are nature unleashed, a physical force of howling fury and emotion, savage and primitive.
-   Vampires are dead yet moving, shadows behind you, sneaky and manipulative, aristocratic and stylish.

Total opposites.

Like Elves vs. Dwarves (or Pirates vs. Ninjas) they probably don't like each other. Wouldn't it be awesome if they fought each other?

And they _did_. And it was _awesome_.

_Old World of Darkness_ popularized this trope, but there were some earlier examples. Compare Monster Mash, where they're cooperative, if not friendly. A subtrope of Cool Versus Awesome. In many cases, the most powerful vampires and werewolves could end up locked in an Arrogant God vs. Raging Monster rivalry.

May result in a Vampire-Werewolf Love Triangle, the result of which will be a Hybrid Monster... or a childless marriage. If such a work aims to appeal to the fantasies of those attracted to men, then further contrast is likely to be employed by making the werewolf a handsome hairy bear, while making the vampire a lithe Bishōnen pretty boy. If it's meant to appeal to those attracted to females, the vampire is likely to be The Beautiful Elite while the werewolf will probably be something like a Badass Biker or Amazonian Beauty, and likely to take wearing clothes more as a suggestion than a rule (because Shapeshifting Excludes Clothing is probably in effect). Both male and female extremes play into another pair of opposed stereotypes about the two groups, Vampires Are Rich and Working-Class Werewolves. This might be played as allegorical class struggle, with vampires as "The Man" keeping the werewolves "in their place."

As a whole, this trope might be Newer Than They Think. In many legends and folklore that mention both vampires and werewolves, the two are not only not antagonistic to one another, they are often _connected or are one thing_, such as one belief that an improperly-disposed-of werewolf would actually come back as a vampire. Even Dracula had many werewolfish traits, such as hairy palms and, well, the ability to turn into a wolf, and yes, we know werewolves have fangs too. We just like the alliteration. Plus, just as how you don't think "zebra" when you hear hoofbeats, you don't think "werewolf" when you hear "fang". Also, vampires may have fur depending on how bat-like they may be, but that's just stretching it at this point. Anyway, on to the examples...
