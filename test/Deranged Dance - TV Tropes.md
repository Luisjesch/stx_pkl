Dancing can signify many things, be it love, desperation or hopelessness, anger, or even happiness. It can even convey insanity — which is the scope of this trope.

A character performing a Deranged Dance usually signifies his/her failing sanity, if it hasn't been compromised entirely before. Their dancing will usually be erratic and/or uncoordinated, and may involve screaming, crying, frightening stoicism, or any combination thereof.

While playing this trope seriously or for drama is more common, hilarious examples do exist — for example, having the character dance naked or in their underwear.

Compare and contrast Dance of Despair — with which the trope has a strong overlap, especially if desperation is the cause of the insanity. Expect Dancing with Myself, as it's a rare occurrence that someone else sees the character, at least openly. Compare also Tuneless Song of Madness — _singing_ as a sign of failing sanity — which sometimes overlaps with this trope. If the mad dancing resembles (or _is_) ballet, it may fall under Creepy Ballet as well. Similarly uncoordinated to I Can't Dance, but that trope is because the character can't dance in the first place. If it's unplanned in addition to the above, it also falls under Involuntary Dance. Due to its nature, is heavily intertwined with Sanity Slippage. May be paired with a Sanity Slippage Song.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Batman: No Man's Land_, there is Alvin Kothers, AKA the Death Dancer, who is a Serial Killer who does a little tap dance in front of his victims right before "liberating" them from their suffering via knife to the throat.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Joker (2019)_ has Arthur Fleck dancing in the bathroom after killing the three men who assaulted him in the subway, dancing down a long stair path, _and_ dancing on top of a car in the midst of a riot, all as a sign of his descent into madness.
-   _The Silence of the Lambs_ features serial killer Buffalo Bill dancing in the buff and in makeup to "Goodbye Horses" in his disorganized basement, a scene that highlights his Psychopathic Manchild and Sissy Villain traits.
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)_ it's Played for Laughs. Dr. Robotnik dances to "Where Evil Grows" at one point. While he feels confident in his ability to catch Sonic at the moment, and his dancing is pretty smooth, his chase for the hedgehog is slowly taking a toll on his sanity, and it's telling how he openly (if silently) acknowledges that he's evil in this moment. And then he gets startled out of the dance by his lackey, Stone, showing up to offer him a latte.
-   In _Black Swan_, Nina's final dance as the Black Swan shows her as being truly Driven to Madness, but for that, it's noted as being "perfect". Made even more so by how she stabbed herself, maybe to death, just before it.
-   A rare example when the dance doesn't involve the protagonist dancing (necessarily; it's at least ambiguous) in _Mulholland Dr._. Betty's journey into Hollywood begins with an intercut of people dancing the jitterbug while she watches. When the film cuts back to what may be reality, Betty's doppelgänger Diane is increasingly menaced by dancing people and visions of sinister people dancing. One theory for this is that one of Diane's few accomplishments is winning a jitterbug contest, _perhaps_ while her Abusive Parents or grandparents watched.
-   In _Us_, rather than trying to defend herself actively when Adelaide aka the real Red comes at her with a sword, Red aka the original, real Adelaide simply dances away from her and avoids the blade. The closer Adelaide/Red gets, however, the more deranged Red's movements become, especially as it's intercut by Red's Involuntary Dance for the other Tethered.
-   Towards the end of _Alps_, as Monte Rosa's sanity declines, she bursts into a dance class and forces one of the patrons to dance with her.

-   In _Climax_, the dance troupe grows more and more insane as they continue drinking the LSD-laced sangria and their dances become more demented and horrifying in turn.
-   In _Kingsman: The Golden Circle_, one of the main symptoms caused by the toxin Poppy has added to her widespread drugs is uncontrollable and disturbingly erratic dancing before the victim starts completely losing their minds.
-   Nellie LaRoy in _Babylon_ dances wildly and confidently during the opening party scene, which gets her noticed by some executives and gets hired on the spot as a replacement for an actress who overdosed at the party. Way later in the movie, she dances away into the night after having second thoughts about leaving Los Angeles with Manny.

    Literature 

-   In _Heralds of Valdemar_, Lan jigging in savage joy over the deaths of enemy soldiers — when only an hour earlier he had felt extreme revulsion at the idea of killing anybody — is a sign that he's been Driven to Madness.
-   Invoked in _Shogun_; Toranaga is travelling in disguise, and in order to prevent his identity from being revealed Blackthorne feigns madness and dances a hornpipe to distract everyone.
-   In _Lords and Ladies_, the people of Lancre are subjected to an Elven invasion. The Lancre Morrismen are surrounded by elves as they rehearse. They are terrified, but it occurs to Jason Ogg that humans can cast a counter-enchantment on Elves: they can dance and sing. Dancing buys the Morrismen time to fight to safety: the Elves are compelled to watch and the humans realize they have no choice but to keep up the dancing, singing and music . For _hours_. Without rest. (Every so often, an Elf gets close enough to kick or fell with a wooden staff).

    Live-Action TV 

-   A perfect example would be The Swede aka Thor Gunderson from _Hell on Wheels_, in which the Hell on Wheels settlement burns to the ground thanks to an Indian raid caused by the Swede, who's by now become a crazed murderer and gleefully dances with himself while the town burns down around him. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Twin Peaks_, Leland Palmer begins sporadically dancing with no one at inappropriate moments as his sanity dissolves after the brutal death of his daughter Laura and his worsening possession by BOB.
-   A-Yan in _The Untamed_ after having her soul restored after it was forcibly taken is mentally and spiritually damaged from the experience. She would occasionally start dancing much to the distress of her surviving family and attendant. It actually was a sign that she was possessed by the Dancing Goddess statue but they didn't know that so they just though she was deranged.

    Music 

-   The Peter Gabriel song "Moribund the Burgermeister" is told from the point of view of a Medieval magistrate observing the crazed dancing of his town's people, possibly a symptom of ergotism.

    Mythology And Religion 

-   Greek Mythology features Eris, the infamous goddess of discord and conflict, who often danced in the ruins of burning cities like Troy while wearing hair decorations dripping with human blood. Thus, this trope is Older Than Feudalism.
-   Also the infamous Maenads of Greek Mythology, the female followers of the God of Merriment and Madness Dionysis, who were known for roaming mountains and forests performing frenzied, ecstatic dances and were believed to be possessed by the god. While under his influence they were supposed to have unusual strength, including the ability to tear animals or people to pieces when encountered, with the mythical hero Orpheus being a famous victim of that practice.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_ _Forgotten Realms_, the Menzoberranzan boxed set has Menzoberranzan, an underground city of the drow (dark elves). One of its prominent merchants is the halfling Myrip Minstrelwish, who is considered half-mad by the drow because he dances and sings while he works.
-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ has the Black Spiral Dancers. Their initiation involves dancing across a seemingly innocuous spiral shaped pattern on the ground. But doing this brings you face-to-face with the madness of the Wyrm. And you do not want to be face-to-face with the Wyrm.

    Theatre 

-   Perhaps the most famous example in the Western literary canon is Ophelia dancing and strewing flowers all the way through her Sanity Slippage Song in _Hamlet_.
-   _Be More Chill_: At the end of the song _Halloween_, Rich's dancing becomes more and more erratic as he fights the SQUIP.
-   In _Elektra_ by Richard Strauss, Elektra goes completely insane in the finale, after learning that Klytaemnestra, Aegisthus and their followers were massacred by Orestes, and starts dancing wildly. Then she drops dead mid-dance.

    Web Videos 

-   In _The Cry of Mann_, Courtney's Dance of Despair occurs while she's undergoing Sanity Slippage and sinking into a deep state of existential depression. She asks her callers for different dance moves she can perform and staggers around trying to do them, before collapsing on her bed, her mood taking a downward spiral. This is one of the first signs that something is _very wrong_ with her, before she eventually covers her face in rhinestones trying to look beautiful.
-   In the short film _2 AM: The Smiling Man_, an adaptation of the similarly-named creepypasta, the protagonist encounters what appears to be a madman with a strange rictus grin, dancing on the sidewalk in the middle of the night. Then the man stops dancing and chases after him...

    Real Life 

-   Dancing Mania, which are cases of mass dance hysteria occuring in Europe between the 14th and 17th Centuries. In these cases, people danced until they collapsed from exhaustion. Even though theories have been proposed as to why these freakish events happened (one of the theories states that people broke into mass-dance hysteria to release pent-up stress from the poor living conditions in those eras), little progress of understanding them have been made and the phenomenon is a mystery even today.
-   A propaganda video from World War II showed a delighted Adolf Hitler dancing a ridiculous jig in delight at the surrender of France. It was used throughout the war to emphasize that the Allies' foremost enemy was a ridiculous but dangerous lunatic, and the film circulated worldwide as part of the British propaganda effort. It was only after the war that it was revealed that the Hitler Jig had never happened — a sequence of his walking normally had been copied backwards and forwards on a recurring loop to give the impression of Hitler dancing madly.
