They all produce venom that causes instant death by anaphylactic shock to anyone they sting, and those who are turned into queens by the red wasps can also convert other women to do their bidding.

-   There are actually some people in the _Furry Fandom_ who enjoy artwork and stories about people with the ability to increase the size of their genitals and sometimes butt, breasts, or muscles to the point that they outgrow and destroy planets, stars, galaxies, universes, and even multiverses, often while the rest of their body stays at normal size.
-   Stories and artwork that focus the vore fetish sometime depict characters swallowing victims using body parts other than their mouths, such as sucking a victim up their urethra and turning them into semen, which is often but not always lethal.
-   Another strange fetish you can find on the internet is absorbing a victim by turning them into your penis. The victim may or may not remain conscious. Many scaly fans like characters with snakes for penises, which is often the result of two characters fusing this way.

Then Danny recited an ancient prayer, and Odin gave his balls the powers of thunder and lightning for real.

-   In _Spinnerette_, it's mentioned that a superheroine named Ms. Venus gets her superpowers from her Venusian bosom (specifically, she was a scientist who got powers from an alien artifact found on Venus).

She changed her name to Super MILF, and got an even _more_ cleavage-y outfit, claiming that she needed it to cool the heat radiated from her Venusian bust.
-   In _Super Stupor,_ Mind's Eye has the power to make anyone tell the complete truth — even if they're mind-controlled — but has to have his penis inside them for it to work.
