**Brain:** Come, we have work to do.  
**Pinky:** Oh, right, taking over the world, and all...  
**Brain:** No, Pinky — tonight, we must _save_ the world!  
**Pinky:** Egad, Brain — _save_ the world?!  
**Brain:** YES! So it is available to take over _tomorrow_ night.

While villains want to Take Over the World or cause The End of the World as We Know It, the heroes are most likely motivated by the polar opposite, saving the world. A fairly simple plot/motivation related to For Great Justice and what not, this trope is pretty broad and _very_ common for many stories not focused on character interaction only. Frequently, this means the main character(s) preventing a preventable apocalypse, such as from the Undead or a natural disaster.

Most of the time, this is the result of The Call, or occasionally may be someone who Jumped at the Call and is just trying to be able to do this. Note, this doesn't always _happen_ and it's entirely possible for the bad guy to win and the Earth to be destroyed. Sometimes, the villain will actually help with this goal, as what's the point in taking over a pile of rubble after all? (Especially if it's Not Me This Time.)

Extremely common in some genres, such as High Fantasy, soft Science Fiction, and The Epic.

If the plot escalates to this, it's "Save the World" Climax.

-   Yugi Muto from _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ is constantly dueling to save the world from demons and evil sorcerers — much to the exasperation of Seto Kaiba, who spends most of the story refusing to believe in all the "hocus-pocus magic".
    
    **Kaiba:** Why don't you stop "saving the world" and _get a hobby_?
    
-   _Attack on Titan_: It starts off with the basic premise of the last remnants of Humanity fighting man-eating giants in the hope of one day reclaiming the world they lost. A massive Deconstruction ensues when the "last remnants" find out that they were living on an isolated island the whole time and the rest of the world is fully populated. This fully populated world openly hates the inhabitants of the isolated island, referring to them as a race of devils who deserve extermination due to the atrocities committed by their ancestors using the power of the Titans. Seeing that any prospect of peace was impossible, Eren Yeager initiates the long-feared Rumbling in response to the world's hostility to save his _own_ world from further attacks.

    Comic Books 

-   Superman and Supergirl are determined and committed to save the world and protect people for reasons that go beyond simple justice or righteousness: they are the only survivors of a dead world.

    -   In _War World_, both cousins fight a planet-buster, star-sized killing satellite to save the whole universe.

    -   In _Red Daughter of Krypton_, Kara explains why worldwide genocide and planetary destruction are very personal issues for her:
        
        **Supergirl**: How could anyone make it their mission in life to murder whole worlds? Can you imagine what an abomination that is to an orphan from a dead planet? \[...\] This world-killing stuff... it hits a nerve. It makes me furious, and the ring just fans the flame!
        
    -   In _Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures in the 8th Grade_, Supergirl manages -with help of Supragirl and Lena- to save all dimensions from being turned into energy fuel for Mxyzptlk.

    **Ritsuka:** Matou Shinji. You want to prove to everyone that you're worthy of becoming the Matou successor? Then help me. Together, we'll save the world. There's no better way to prove it than doing something so grand, right?  
    **Shinji:** _\[staring before laughing\]_ Saving the world? What do you think this is, some sort of anime? This game wouldn't threaten the world!  
    **Ritsuka:** _\[dead serious\]_ When Chaldea's involved, the stakes are very rarely any lower.

-   The plot and motivation of nearly every single _Super Sentai_ and _Power Rangers_ series _ever_. Be it from some evil witch or wizard, space pirates, warlords, demons, or mutants, boasting about saving the world means very little to any ranger, as they've _all_ done it.

    Pinball 

-   Featured in the very title of _Popeye Saves the Earth_.

    Theme Parks 

-   In _Space Fantasy: The Ride_ at Universal Studios Japan, guests are sent out on a mission to save the _entire universe_ by restoring life to the sun.

    Video Games 

-   In _Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts_, one of the characters, Klungo, creates a horrendous 8-bit arcade platforming game (which he proclaims to be the best ever), titled _Hero Klungo Sssavesss Teh World_, in which you save the world by _holding it over your head_.
-   In _Black Sigil_, your ultimate goal is prevent the world from being destroyed by The Forbidden.
-   Crono from _Chrono Trigger_ wants nothing more than to go to the Millennial Fair, but ends up roped into a time traveling quest to save his planet from annihilation at the hands of an incomprehensible Eldritch Abomination.
-   _Deus Ex_ subverts this — while your inevitable goal is to prevent Big Bad from taking over the world, you can't actually save the world. It's in ruins and your choice is who to hand the reconstruction contract to an AI who wants to assimilate with you, a "compassionate conspiracy" leader that keeps his mentor in cryogenic almost-stasis in his basement, or a well-intentioned ally who thinks that the Big Bad's technology is more trouble than it's worth and wants to destroy it and send the world into anarchy. If any of that counts as "saved" is largely a matter of opinion (or, as the game would put it, choice).
    -   _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_ goes one step further and allows you to pick any faction, even the until-then Bad Guys, and hand the world over to them. Or kill them all. According to canon, none of these choices prevent _Deus Ex 1_ from taking place.
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_ plays with this trope. While _technically_ you are saving the world by stopping the Blight (i.e. a vast horde of evil monsters led by a corrupted Dragon-God), the game's codex makes it quite clear that failure on your part will not actually lead to the end of the world. Blights reoccur every few centuries in Thedas, so people who dedicate their lives to stopping them have created a military organization, the Grey Wardens, just for that purpose. If you do not succeed, then one of the other members of your organization, which is thousands strong, would finish it in your place. By stopping the Blight, all you really do is keep the country that you live in from being destroyed before the other Wardens could act. Your victory simply means that the threat ended before the rest of the world noticed the problem.
    -   _Dragon Age II_ averts this: Templars and mages _will_ end up fighting one another, but how that comes about is up to Hawke.
-   _Drakengard_ is notable here in that, while the first and fourth endings employ this, the second ending straight-up tells you that Failure Is the Only Option, the third ending is mildly ambiguous as the world still needs saving, and the fifth ending... well, it's hard to tell really.
    -   According to Word of God, the fifth ending caused the downfall of another world...
        -   And in _that_ world, Nier ultimately destroys the last hope for humanity, driving them all to extinction within a generation.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_ usually have this present in their main quest. It may start out with something smaller scale, especially in the first few games of the series, but by the end, there is usually some force threatening to bring about The End of the World as We Know It, if not destroy it entirely.
    -   In _Arena_, the Evil Sorcerer Jagar Tharn has usurped the throne of the benevolent emperor Uriel Septim VII and is allowing the Empire to fall apart (and even helping it along). Naturally, you must defeat him and restore the rightful Emperor to the throne. (Later games reveal that Tharn was in league with Mehrunes Dagon, see below.)
    -   In _Daggerfall_, you initially start off investigating the haunting of the eponymous city by the ghost of a former king as a favor to the Emperor. Naturally, this escalates until you are retrieving the key to an ancient superweapon and must decide which of several parties to give it to. One of the Multiple Endings has you activate yourself, with cataclysmic results.
    -   In _Morrowind_, you initially start off as an agent of the Empire investigating local superstitions. Naturally, this escalates until you are stepping up to face the Big Bad Physical God Dagoth Ur, who is using the power of the heart of the dead creator god to spread a Mystical Plague and, eventually, will use the power of said heart to activate a copy of the superweapon mentioned above, with the goal of Taking Over The World. (And, according to some deeper lore, also imprinting his twisted and broken mind on reality itself.)
    -   _Oblivion_ plays it completely straight, with the entire world of Nirn being threatened by the Apocalypse Cult and Legions of Hell of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of Destruction, whose chief desire is utterly destroy Nirn.
    -   _Skyrim_ again plays it straight with return of the dragon Alduin, the Beast of the Apocalypse in Nordic tradition, who prophesied to "eat" the current world in order to make room for the next one. Naturally, you must stop him in order to save all of existence.
    -   In _The Elder Scrolls Online_, an MMORPG prequel to the main series, the world is threatened by Molag Bal, the Daedric Prince of Corruption and Domination, and one of the closest beings to a true God of Evil in the series. He's attempting to perform a "Planemeld", merging his Oblivion realm of Coldharbour with Mundus, the mortal plane. Naturally, you must prevent this.
-   Frequently the case in _Final Fantasy_ games. The trope is played straight in I - V, VII, and VIII and invoked in VI, IX and XIII by the villains and in X by the heroes.
    -   XII has the team of heroes trying to save the kingdom/city-state from becoming the battleground between two rival empires. Not the same scale, but played for just as much drama.
    -   FFVII actually deconstructed this, as it did with many other JRPG tropes. The line gets thrown around a lot, but as we learn more about the characters it becomes clear that there are more personal matters that drive them. Indeed, it almost becomes an excuse; an easy answer that people use because they don't want to admit to their real reasons, or can't explain. In the End, Cloud breaks RPG tradition and admits that the reason he's going after Big Bad Sephiroth isn't due to some higher cause. For him it's a Personal matter, a fight that was started years ago that he intends to finish. Saving the Planet just happens to be a part of that.
-   Subverted in _Goodbye Volcano High_. When the dinosaurs discover that a massive asteroid has entered the solar system and may collide with the planet in eight months, social media becomes littered with ideas of how to stop it, or at the very least survive the impact, or hopes that it'll miss and the panic was pointless. But it gradually becomes clear the asteroid _will_ hit and there's no way of stopping or surviving it, forcing the dinosaurs to figure out how they'll spend their final days, leading to Apocalypse Anarchy and, ultimately, Do Not Go Gentle.
-   In the RPG parts of _Half-Minute Hero_, saving the world is so mundane task that while the hero is busy killing the boss to prevent it from catching world destruction spell, he will do other things like put out forest fires in the meantime.
-   The original _Halo_ trilogy is primarily about Master Chief, Cortana, and friends trying to prevent the galaxy-killing Halos from firing. The other games have been a mix of world-saving and more small-scale stories.
-   Particularly galling in _Illusion of Gaia_, where your goal is generally exploring ancient ruins and collecting mystic statues.
-   _Jak and Daxter_: Jak does this every game. Not that he ever gets a "thank you" lasting more than 30 seconds into the next game...
    -   Actually, he does get _some_ respect in the third game, mostly from your allies and commoners, but it's easy to miss because literally everyone (yourself included) is preoccupied with the three-way war that's slowly reducing the city to rubble.
    -   Also, the fact that the upper class (reduced to consisting of one guy) still hates you in the third game is a plot point.
-   Despite being rooted in the effort to Save the Princess, most games in the _The Legend of Zelda_ series fit this trope. In _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_, for example, you're trying to prevent the destruction of the world by keeping the moon from crashing into the realm of Termina. Several of the games involve preventing Hyrule from falling under the control of Ganondorf — or, in the case of _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_, wresting it away from his control.
-   Being an epic Sci-Fi trilogy, _Mass Effect_ uses the scaled-up version: Shepard and friends are out to save all sentient life in the galaxy as they have done every 50,000 years for, according to the "Leviathan" DLC for _Mass Effect 3_, at least _ten billion years_.
-   One of the complaints against the plot of _Neverwinter Nights 2_ is that you aren't saving the world, and the titular city isn't attacked in the Bad Ending, because Status Quo Is God in the Forgotten Realms.
-   One of the driving plot points for _Parasite Eve_ and _Parasite Eve 2_. The other point is trying to figure out why a bunch of animals are mutating and attacking people.
-   _Persona 3_'s Wake Up, Go to School, Save the World plot really only involves saving random people in your city, but the heroes act as if they've saved the world. Then it turns out that the entire world really is at stake, the heroes' lives included, and they _freak out_.
-   One of the (many) notable aspects of _Planescape: Torment_ was that the plot had nothing to do with saving _anything_, be it city, world, plane etc. Rather, your main quest involved an amnesiac immortal trying to figure out who he is, who took his mortality, and eventually _die_.
    -   On one occasion you do have to save a town that had literally gone straight to hell. Or, more strictly speaking, it restores itself to its rightful place once you defeat the local villain.
    -   Similarly, _Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of The Betrayer_. While there is a (in the grand scheme, rather small) danger to the world involved if you fail, but the majority of your motivation is that solving the spirit eater curse prevents you from dying, the fact that it no longer terrorizes the world at large is only casually mentioned. This is due to many shared developers.
        -   Averted by the _real_ evil ending which has the player devouring the curse thus _becoming_ the curse itself, getting him/herself expelled from the City of the Dead, then cleansed countless githyanki cities by devouring the souls of all the adults and then delivering their children to their mortal enemies, the _brain-sucking_, _mind-raping_ mind flayers aka Illithids. If that's not enough, he/she devours the spirits/souls inhabiting the land where he/she once helped (or screwed depending on your playing preference), turning it into a wasteland filled with the walking dead. As if that is still not enough, the player then travels to the planes of existence where the souls of his/her dead former treacherous companions are now resting... and eats them. Whoa. Understandably, the gods get so pissed off, they assembled a humongous army to kill the player and guess what? He/she eats some of the gods too!
-   Most of the _Pokémon_ films. And in the _Diamond_, _Pearl_, and _Platinum_ games, replace "the world" with "all existence".
    -   All of the games have this as a major subplot integrated with the main plot of To Be a Master since Gen III, barring the remakes of Gen I and Gen II. It started with May and Brendan in _Ruby_, _Sapphire_, and _Emerald_, and proceeded to escalate from there, up to the above situation.
-   _Shadow Hearts: Covenant_ shows why it's important to save the Save the World element for last. Being told that the end boss is going to destroy the world loses a lot of kick when you've already saved the world twice; even once before the halfway point of the game.
-   The _Shin Megami Tensei_ games twist this around: the world is already destroyed, and you get to "save" it by choosing how the pieces are put back together.
-   _Skies of Arcadia_ spends most of its time as a charming adventure revolving around exploration and piracy... until the final ten hours or so, when The Very Definitely Final Dungeon is raised from the depths of the planet, a devastating superweapon is unleashed, a country is leveled, and Heroic Sacrifices abound.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_: Every core game focuses on the eponymous hero's quest to save the world. Initially from would-be world conqueror Dr. Eggman, later games upped the stakes by having humanity and the world get threatened by Ancient Evils and Omnicidal Maniacs.
-   _Star Ocean_. All of them. _Star Ocean: Till the End of Time_ and _Star Ocean: The Last Hope_ replace "world" with "universe".
-   Many _Super Mario Bros._ games mostly focus on rescuing Princess Peach, but a good handful of the RPG spinoffs have saving the world as the main plot. For example, in _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ Mario is tasked with finding the Crystal Stars before Grodus does, otherwise he will use the Crystal Stars to unlock an ancient power to conquer the world with.
-   _Ultima IV_ averts this entirely, as there is no threat to the world whatsoever. _Ultima VIII_ kind of subverts it, as you wind up doing a great deal of damage to one world in order to have the opportunity to try to save another. The rest of the main _Ultimas_ play this trope to varying degrees of straight.
-   The ultimate goal in the pacifist run of Undertale is saving the world, both the underground and the surface world, from Asriel. Even the final battle theme is called SAVE The World!
-   Every _Wild ARMs_ game.
-   Ironically Averted in _The World Ends with You_. The world never even comes close to being destroyed. The plot of the game is about getting Back from the Dead. The title refers to the fact that Neku needs to expand his horizons and stop being a gloomy loner. That said, Shibuya does come close to being destroyed and the heroes do have to save _that_. Perhaps a more appropriate title would have been _A Small District of Tokyo Ends With You_.
-   Despite appearances of a plotless pretty-looking Puzzle Game, _World of Goo_'s Wham Episode sets you down this path when you have to journey down the Information Superhighway and discover you can thwart the enemy by flooding all their inboxes with spam, and not just any spam, all and any messages deleted in the history of the internet..
-   The plots of three of the first four _X-Universe_ games revolved around stopping two separate Alien Invasions from destroying the Community of Planets. _X: Beyond the Frontier_ saw fish-out-of-water Major Kyle William Brennan join up with the Argon Federation to stop a Xenon planet-killer. _X2: The Threat_ had his son Julian Gardna working to destroy a Kha'ak planet-killer before it could be used a second time. _X3: Reunion_ continued this storyline with Gardna working to stop the Kha'ak warfleet itself.
-   _Xenosaga_ did this in different quantities at the end of each game. Since the setting of the game is universal, the first game, which merely threatens the existence of a planet, can't really be a "Saving the World" scenario. The second game is rather unclear in whether or not the characters are saving the world or just fighting some bad guys. The 3rd game is phenomenally epic in scale.
-   _You Have to Burn the Rope_: In the expository theme ("Now you're a hero, you burned the rope and saved us a-all"). This seems to be the only place in the game where this particular plot-point is mentioned, however. Interesting that the boss was a threat to the world, given that he's too tall to get out of his headquarters.

    Web Comics 

-   _Off-White_: Hugin said Munin's name after the former got blasted by a spell Sköll cast.
-   _Bar'd_: Averted and lampshaded.

-   _Ben 10: Omniverse_: A recurring plot.
    -   The earlier _Ben 10_ series had this as a recurring theme (on several occasions, extending to the entire universe), but _Omniverse_ makes it almost Once an Episode and it seems like The World Is Always Doomed despite this being the Lighter and Softer series.
-   _Danny Phantom_: Danny and all the other ghosts turn the entire Earth intangible so the disasteroid could pass through.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls_: One of its advertisement slogans is _Saving the world before bedtime!_

    -   In the Grand Finale, Drakken and Shego end up helping to save the world from an Alien Invasion, much to Drakken's embarrassment.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Twilight Sparkle and her friends do this at least once a season. They actually save the world by redeeming a thousand year old villain in the first two episodes, defeat a god of chaos at the beginning of the second season and stop an evil queen's plot at the end, restore a long-lost empire in the third season by defeating the evil emperor, so on and so on. By season 5, their friends and family have become used to it; at several points, they are surprised to be given the benefit of the doubt in odd situations, and everyone else points out that they've saved the world half a dozen times already.
-   In _Invader Zim_, Zim saved the earth from the Planet Jackers. Furthermore, Dib and Zim saved the earth from Tak in the episode Tak the hideous new girl. Dib also saved the earth from the various schemes of Zim.
