A character, creature, etc. which is heavily associated with a fictional universe, to the point of being the (official or unofficial) mascot. This can be despite the presence of other creatures, characters, etc. Likewise, it usually features good guys as iconic characters of their franchise. In Video Games, this tends to be a popular enemy (or unit) and can overlap with Mascot Mook or Mascot Villain. In other works, the role can often fall to the Team Pet or another Ridiculously Cute Critter or Sidekick Creature Nuisance.

## "Cute" Series Mascots:

    Anime and Manga 

-   Pochita of _Chainsaw Man_, Denji's adorable dog-like Chainsaw Devil. Unlike most examples, he's mostly absent from the series, as the first chapter has him fuse with Denji and save his life to turn him into the titular Half-Human Hybrid.

-   Agumon is something of an unofficial mascot for the _Digimon_ franchise, being featured as the partner of The Hero in two different anime series and one manga, and a prominent presence in most — if not all — video games and virtual pets.

-   Happy serves as this for _Fairy Tail_. Notably, unlike his fellow Exceeds, Carla and Panther Lily, he doesn't get a power up at any point in the series. Amusingly, a different version of Happy also serves as this for Hiro Mashima's succeeding work, _EDENS ZERO_.
-   Black Hayate (a puppy) and to a lesser extent Xiao May (a baby panda) in _Fullmetal Alchemist_.
-   For _Full Metal Panic!_, there's Bonta-kun, with the entire second season being named after the sounds he makes, "Fumoffu".
-   _Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden_ gets one in the form of Genbu Celestial Warrior, Namame... who's a lovable _8cm ball of rock_.
-   _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ has the Tachikomas, the world's cutest giant spider-tanks.
-   Sadaharu and Elizabeth from _Gintama_. The series also parodies the whole mascot concept with Makoto-chan, the ill-advised, short-lived mascot of the Shinsengumi.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   Haro is this despite not appearing in four of the seven Alternate Universes, as well as the mascot for the company Sunrise. In fact, Haro always shows up on the Vanity Plate for the company in recent titles, making the dotted i in the company name.
    -   Invoked in full force for the _Gundam Build_ continuity with the Petitguys, made in every possible color and even colors homaging a previous season, _Gundam 00_. While they're still in the franchise as of _Gundam Build Divers_, they're in significantly less numbers, with the load shared by the return of Haro.
-   For _Heroic Age_ it's B-Navi. Be careful though, because it actually transforms into a gun used to fire the Cool Ship's main weapon.
-   _Jewelpet_ has Ruby the white rabbit.
-   _Kodocha_ has a ubiquitous bat/rabbit hybrid, appropriately named Babbit. It probably exists _only_ for this trope.

-   _Moyashimon_ has an unusual example: a cutesy, anthropomorphic _Aspergillus oryzae_ spore.

-   _Natsume's Book of Friends_: A lot of merch features Nyanko-sensei or Nyanko-sensei's face, since he's easy to draw and recognizable. In fact, since the protagonist Natsume has a pretty generic design, fanart and illustrations will often include Nyanko-sensei if Natsume isn't holding the Yuujinchou.
-   Pen-Pen from _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ is a quirky penguin that fits the mold as a "cute" series mascot, but is marketed far less than EVA Unit-01 and the two female leads, and is even absent from the third _Rebuild of Evangelion_ movie.
-   _One Piece_: Due to his popularity, Chopper has gradually become an icon for the series, to the point where it seems he and Luffy are the only characters.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   _Pocket Monsters_ has both Red's Pikachu and his Clefairy. The Clefairy is a reference to how Clefairy was the original choice for the _Pokémon_ mascot.
    -   Pikachu is the _de facto_ mascot for the animated series and (slightly less so) for the games.

-   Kyubey from _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_. Its face and catchphrase appears everywhere in the fandom because of how cute and innocent it is. Or at least so it seems... /人◕‿‿◕人\\
-   _Ranma ½_: Genma Saotome's panda form is the most likely to appear for all promotions and merchandising, though Ranma's female form is a close runner-up (toeing the line between "cute" and "hot").

-   Suzuri from _RideBack_. Unusual in that she's one of those rare cute sidekick-type characters who not only dies during the series, but dies rather brutally (we don't see her head getting crushed; that happens off-screen. But we do see the blood on the asphalt).
-   _Seiyu's Life!_:
    -   Futaba's stuffed animal acts as one for, explaining to the audience the inner workings of being a voice actor.
    -   Futaba herself voiced Pipo, the mascot for _Buddha Fighter Bodhisattvon_, before they were unceremoniously killed off in episode 2.
-   _Shimoneta_: Ayame is the (literal) poster girl and face of the series, who also falls under the "hot" classification. She's featured in all marketing material and promotional art, usually in her "Blue Snow" disguise.
-   _Tenchi Muyo!_ has the adorable cabbit (cat/rabbit) Ryo-Ohki, which has the ability to transform into a spaceship.
-   _Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!_ has the "Kuso Cat", a gray cat with a perpetually shocked face that's constantly observing the cast's antics. It also serves as the Author Avatar in omakes and Gag Censor whenever the cast find themselves in compromised situations.
-   _Welcome to the NHK_:
    -   Sato lampshades this trope by saying "Every RPG needs a wimpy mascot character!" while beating up a lookalike for _Dragon Quest_'s Slimes.
    -   The series itself actually contains a _de facto_ mascot in the form of that creepy-adorable dancing purple alien that is used as a personification for "conspiracy".
-   Odate Buta is so associated with _Yatterman_ that when the live-action movie started getting posters, the first one just showed him looking out at the viewer. Nothing else was needed — he's _that_ well-known and associated with _Yatterman_.
-   _Yo-kai Watch_ has Jibanyan, who is an adorable cat youkai who talks and lives with Nate. Jibanyan has numerous Palette Swap yokai similar to him as a result, such as Sailornyan and Tomnyan.

-   _Zombie Land Saga_ has Romero, an Ugly Cute zombie toy poodle who serves as mascot in-series and out.

    Comic Books 

-   Squirrel Girl for the _Great Lakes Avengers_ series. If anyone's going to appear in an "off-stage" comic to recap the plot, it'll be her.

    Film — Animation 

-   Olaf the talking snowman from _Frozen_ is probably the best-known character in the franchise not named Elsa (who is mentioned in the "hot" category below).
-   Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel is the single most iconic character from the _Ice Age_ series, despite having little to no bearing on the plot and seldom interacting with the actual protagonists.
-   _The Secret Life of Pets_ has Snowball as he’s voiced by highest paid comedian Kevin Hart and has been the main promoted character in the franchise because of that. Even appearing on the Illumination logo with the Minions.
-   _Trolls_ has Guy Diamond, the silver glitter troll, being the mascot of the films, though Poppy and Branch are still headliners for being the protagonists. Biggie, Mr. Dinkles and Cooper, being the odd ones out and animal-like, also seem to represent the films and series.

    Literature 

-   The collective works of Dr. Seuss are best represented by The Cat in the Hat.
-   The _Harry Potter_ series has Hedwig, the title character's pet owl.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_: Oddly enough, the cover art for the books in the USA market usually includes a floating eyeless sphere with a large goofy smile, two arms, and a long, protruding tongue; no such creature ever appears in the text (or TV show, or movie, or radio show, or computer game...). Most fans consider Marvin to be the series' real mascot.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_'s robot dog K9, who's lately moved to _The Sarah Jane Adventures_.

-   _Legends of Tomorrow_ has Beebo, a blue stuffed toy who looks like a half-Furby, half-Muppet. Some fans consider him a mascot for the _Arrowverse_ as a whole, since he's cameoed in every show except _Black Lightning_.

-   Johnny Crawfish is this for _The Noddy Shop_, being featured prominently on UK merchandise as well as on the official site. He even has his own song!
-   Eleven is easily _Stranger Things_' most recognizable character.

    Music 

-   A lot of HoneyWorks' music videos and ads feature a pair of bears with heart-shaped ears, originally appearing on the cover of the album _Rokugen Astrology_. Their names are respectively Panmy (a panda) and Kumamaru (a white bear).

    Professional Wrestling 

-   AAA, the longest lasting breakaway from E/CMLL, has an entire mascot division, though in practice it's more of a mixed Tag Team division between mini estrellas and non-mini estrellas. As with Zacarias below, the mini is usually the mascot, although not always...
-   Parodied by CMLL with Zacarias, a mini estrella dressed up as a parrot to serve as Rey Bucanero's "mascot", although in function he was more of a Sidekick. Played straight with KeMonito.

    Puppet Shows 

-   Kermit the Frog for _The Muppets_. He was also the mascot of the Jim Henson Company before Disney bought them out.
-   _Sesame Street_ has Elmo, who is also the mascot for the show's parent company Sesame Workshop. Big Bird used to fill this role before Elmo proved to be a massive merchandising success.
    -   Cookie Monster, Bert & Ernie, Count Von Count and Oscar the Grouch are used as well to represent the show with Grover too especially in the international logo.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _UrbanMech_ in _Battletech_ is an unofficial (and Ugly Cute) example which gained increasing notice in the later years. Despite being a borderline Joke Character with no official presence in any rulebooks, games, or other expanded universe media whatsoever, the fandom loves the "Urbie" and it's arguably the third most well-known 'mech of the franchise.
-   Goblins in _Pathfinder_ are another Ugly Cute example, overlapping with Mascot Mook.

    Theatre 

-   Young Cosette for _Les Misérables_, despite only being in two scenes — but the picture of a young, sorrowful girl in rags is a very good way to get the main themes of a play whose name translates to "The Miserable Ones" across. The most common depiction is taken from an illustration of her sweeping<small>◊</small> from the book, although it's usually zoomed in on just her upper torso and face. The image is so universally associated with the show that advertising for the 2012 movie recreated the poster using the actress playing young Cosette.

    Toys 

-   _My Little Pony_ has many characters, but the major Breakout Character tends to be the mascot of each generation:
    -   G1 had Firefly, a tomboyish pegasus who unusually only stars in the pilot and is literally never mentioned again (though she's a major character in the UK _My Little Pony_ comics).
    -   G3 and G4 have Fun Personified Pinkie Pie as their mascots.
-   _Sylvanian Families_ (_Calico Critters_ in the US) didn't have its own mascot for a period between the 80's and 90's. The rabbit families were the closest the franchise had to having a mascot. It wasn't until the early 2010's that Bell became the main mascot for the franchise.
-   The _Tamagotchi_ virtual pet toys have featured a few of the raiseable breeds of Tamagotchi as their mascot, but the most prominent are Mametchi, a yellow male Tamagotchi who wears a black cap of sorts and vaguely resembles a cat, and Lovelitchi, a female Tamagotchi who looks like a White Bunny. Mametchi's other two best friends, the orange Memetchi and the green Kuchipatchi, are also featured alongside him quite a bit in the franchise's various installments and materials.

    Video Games 

-   Missile the Shiba Inu police dog has become this for the _Ace Attorney_ series, despite initially only appearing once in the main series as an optional character.
-   _Advanced V.G._: Yuka Takeuchi, who also falls into the "hot" category, is both the heroine and the face of the series; including the OVA adaptation. She's usually featured on the cover of each entry and has even made cameo appearances in other fighting games.
-   Twilly for _AdventureQuest_ in particular and all the other Artix Entertainment games to a degree.
-   Red the cardinal serves as this for _Angry Birds_.
-   _Animal Crossing_:
    -   Tom Nook, K.K. Slider, and Mr. Resetti, who are respectively the Tanuki shopkeeper, the canine singer, and the cheat-hater mole.
    -   The player's Shih Tzu secretary Isabelle from _Animal Crossing: New Leaf_ became another mascot for _Animal Crossing_ thanks to her adorable design and fun personality. Not only did she gain a big following in her debut game, but also thanks to _New Horizons._
    -   Rosie, a blue, big-eyed cat villager, is an example as well, getting a fair amount of merchandise and promotional appearances.
-   _ARMS_ has two mascots, and Biff is not one of them. However, Biff is the In-Universe mascot of the ARMS Grand Prix, and looks like a cute kid wearing a costume (the English trailers gave him a deep grown man voice, making him seem more like a dwarf, but left the cute costume intact).
-   The _Atelier Series_ has the punis, colorful slime monsters with eyes, a smiley face and rosey cheeks.

-   _Battlerite_ has Ashka, who is not as cute as most other examples here, but he is still a small, childish character (who just so happens to be a Pyromaniac). His mask serves as the game's logo.

-   The _Borderlands_ series has the Claptrap, who was the star of a web series promoting the first game, is often seen in advertisements, and was eventually made a playable character in _Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!_.
-   _Cities: Skylines_ has the controversial Twitter expy Chirper.
-   _Disgaea_ and other Nippon Ichi games have the Prinnies: penguin suits animated by the souls of sinners and criminals, stuck doing manual labor/good deeds<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  until they atone for their sins. They even got their own spinoff game — _Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?_.
-   The _Dragon Quest_ series has Slimes, the perennial mooks of the franchise that inspired the JRPG trope of adorable low-level blob monsters.

-   Chickens in _Fable_. Hell, _Fable III_ starts with a chicken running around the city as an allegory for the rest of the game.
-   Vault-Boy from _Fallout_, who is a fictional cartoon character in-universe and also serves as the mascot for in-universe corporation Vault-Tec and its products. He also serves as a stand-in for the player character in some respects, almost always having a vault suit with a number matching that of the player character's.
-   _Fate/Grand Order_ uses Fou for this purpose, but it also has Riyo's renditions of Gudako, Mash, and Saber as secondary mascots.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Chocobos and Moogles, and to a lesser extent, Cactaurs, Cait Sith, and Tonberries.
    -   The short, cute, big-eyed plant critters known as mandragora have achieved the status of _Final Fantasy XI_ mascot both in official and unofficial works. In-game, there are numerous mandragora-themed equippable items to find, many of which have the ability to change the character's appearance to a mandragora. Mandragora have a prominent place in much of the official promotional artwork as well. The first and most important fan-made wiki as well the unsanctioned third-party windower program both use the mandragora as a mascot as well. Mandragoras have even appeared as the game's contribution to other games in the same company, such as appearing as a summon in _Dissidia_.
-   Missile the Pomeranian from _Ghost Trick_, who shares the same universe as the identically-named dog from _Ace Attorney_ above, and who is a major character.
-   _Harvest Moon_ has a cow as its mascot. It used to have the original blue-capped protagonist, Pete, as a mascot, but he hasn't been a playable character in years.
-   Rena is considered the mascot of _Higurashi: When They Cry_. Keiichi or really, Rika, is the protagonist, but their friend Rena is the one that appears on most box-arts and in much of the advertising.
-   _Idolish 7_ has two mascots:
    -   Kinako is a pet rabbit-like creature who resides in Takanashi Production.
    -   King Pudding, which is Tamaki's favorite food brand In-Universe.
-   _Just Dance_:
    -   The Panda, who debuted in "C'mon" and "Timber" in _2014_ and has since become a Recurring Character within the series. His likeness is used to promote _Just Dance_ and he's even the protagonist of the All Stars Mode in _2020_!
    -   The Reindeer from "Make It Jingle" in _2018_ has also become a Recurring Character, appearing alongside the Panda.
-   The priring from _La Tale_, which is so cute that it was made into a pet.
-   _League of Legends_:
    -   Teemo, who has become so recognizable that Teemo-inspired plush hats are commonly vended and worn at competitive events. His success has mostly been from his annoyingly cute design, voice, and his skill set, which is rage inducing to face.
    -   Even more than Teemo, the Poros, adorable little critters that look like chubby balls of fluffy fur with tiny stubby limbs, big doe eyes, curly ram horns, and _enormous_ panting tongues. They've made countless appearances as add-ons for certain champion alternate skins, as alternate ward skins, and the card game _Legends of Runeterra_ features a huge number of them as playable units.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   Mega Man himself from _Mega Man (Classic)_.
    -   The recurring Metool/Mettaur/Mettal enemies, who appear in nearly every series in the franchise.
    -   Tron Bonne could also possibly count thanks to representing the _Mega Man Legends_ series in crossovers more than any other character.

-   _Minecraft_ has Creepers, who are so adorable that newer players rush towards them and then realize their mistake the hard way...
-   _Minion Masters_ has puffs. They dominate the in-game emotes. There is even a Mana Puff Plushie
-   _Monster Hunter_ has the Felynes serve as its cute mascot, especially in Japan.
-   The Dogoos are the most common enemies and most featured monsters of the _Neptunia_ franchise. They even have their own line of merchandise.
-   _Overwatch_: Pachimari the Tamanegi-Tako is a non-playable icon of the game, and appears to be a Series Mascot of some kind in-universe too.

-   _Pikmin_ has, obviously, the Pikmin; the little cute race of Plant Aliens that the game centers around. Nintendo likes to feature them prominently in portions of their handhelds and consoles UI, most notably with system transfers for both the 3DS and the Wii U (when transferring original Wii data).
-   _Plants vs. Zombies_ has two different mascots from the Plant and Zombie factions respectively: the Sunflower and the Basic Zombie (the latter being kind of Ugly Cute). Crazy Dave (the only human character seen in the games) also tends to be featured in advertisements.
-   _Portal_:
    -   The very friendly Companion Cube, which will not threaten to stab you. It's so popular that Valve's made plushies and fuzzy dice in its image.
    -   The iPod-esque turrets might even have a stronger claim to the title, appearing in Valve promotional materials even outside the _Portal_ franchise, and getting a much greater and more varied role in _Portal 2_.

-   The _Rune Factory_ series has the adorable sheeplike monsters Woolies/Wooly. They're the weakest and least-aggressive monsters of the series. Micah, the main protagonist of the third installment, is able to transform into a Wooly.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_:
    -   Jack Frost serves as the mascot for both the _Shin Megami Tensei_ franchise as a whole, and the developer company Atlus.
    -   _Persona 4_ and _Persona 5_ have game-specific mascots in Teddie the teddy bear and Morgana the cat, respectively. Both are the only not-completely-humans in their respective game's party.

-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ has seemingly adopted Blizz as their unofficial mascot. He's a rocket launcher-wielding, Jawa, _tanking_ companion of the Bounty Hunter class.
-   Kero the frog and Grey the alien in _Tokimeki Memorial 2_.
-   _Trails Series_:
    -   Poms, bouncing little puffballs with eyes that come in all different varieties. The standout example (and the one that represented the franchise in _Alternative Saga_) is the Shining Pom, which adds wings and a halo.
    -   Mishy the cat, the mascot of Crosbell's Mishelam Wonderland and also considered the mascot of Nihon Falcom overall. A plush Mishy was included as an extra in the Thors Academy Edition release of _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III_.
-   While trailers for _Undertale_ showed Flowey as the mascot, Toriel, who is nowhere near small (easily over six feet) but is definitely cute and lovable, became the most prominently featured of the main cast in outside media. There are even plushies of her!
-   The _World Neverland_ series has Ihms, vaguely rabbit-like blob creatures that the player can adopt as pets.

-   Jibanyan, a talking Cute Kitten, from _Yo-kai Watch_ is the Mascot Mook of the franchise. He appears on box-art, has the most merchandise, and has many clones. He wasn't the mascot originally though, rather being just another yokai. However, the anime made him into a Breakout Character. _Yo-kai Watch 2_ featured him more prominently as a result. The original mascot was most likely intended to be Whisper, the protagonist's yokai butler.

    Webcomics 

-   Lampshaded in _Battle Kreaturez_ with Wally the Platrox, the mascot of the Wyldcard team, a role which he only begrudgingly accepts.
-   Following the completion of _Blue Moon Blossom_, the frog from that story was commandeered by the author as the mascot of _Fifteen Minds_ as a whole, and began to supplant the cartoon astronaut that was previously associated with their Jaho-12 Tumblr in avatars for their social media accounts.
-   _The Order of the Stick_ parodies this trope as it occurs in JRPGs in a strip where Elan and Thog disguise themselves to get aboard an airship, and Thog dresses up as a Moogle.
    
    **Elan:** I'm the famous Treasure Hunter, and this is my marketable (but ultimately useless) recurring mascot character!
    
-   _Twistwood Tales_: Loghead is used as the profile picture for the creator A. C. Macdonald and the series on all sites.

    Web Original 

-   Cuddles the yellow bunny for _Happy Tree Friends_. He's best described as the "Original Happy Tree Friend". Also Toothy, Lumpy, Giggles, and Petunia as well.

-   _Red vs. Blue_ has Caboose, the Idiot Hero bordering on Manchild.
-   _SuperMarioLogan_ has Jeffy, and to a lesser extent, Mario and Bowser Junior.

    Western Animation 

-   Goddard, the titular character's robot dog, from _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_.
-   The main characters' two Team Pets, Appa the flying bison and Momo the flying lemur, from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_.

-   The titular character's pet dog Porkchop from _Doug_.
-   Cosmo and Wanda, the titular fairies from from _The Fairly OddParents!_.
-   _KaBlam!_'s hosts Henry and June. They were even the mascots for their own channel at one point.
-   _Kim Possible_: Rufus the naked mole rat.
-   _My Little Pony_:
    -   Pinkie Pie, and to a lesser extent Minty, were considered the mascots of _My Little Pony (G3)_.
    -   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
        -   Derpy Hooves, who is this to the "brony" community to a larger extent as well. She was a background pony the fandom took to. Eventually she began appearing as a recurring character in the cartoon itself.
        -   Pinkie Pie is also one to the target audience. She inherited this status from her original G3 counterpart.
-   _PAW Patrol_ has Chase and Marshall being the the main mascots as they are the most popular as well as based on Police Officers and Firefighters. Also Skye the only female and Rubble the Kid Appeal being the youngest and getting his own spinoff.
-   Silmer the green, slimy ghost from _The Real Ghostbusters_, depending on your definition of "cute".
-   T.J., the leader of the gang from _Recess_, and to an extent, the tomboyish Spinelli and Military Brat Gus.
-   Rugrats has Tommy, Chuckie, Angelica and Spike and sometimes Reptar representing the franchise.
-   All-star, Casey, Tooter and Occy for _The Snorks_. As All-Star the Hero, Casey Love interest, and Occy the Team Pet appear in the credit poster while Tooter the odd one out is featured on the opening logo poster.
-   Cartman and Kenny from _South Park_ are used to represent the series, especially Cartman, who fills the unique dual role of having a "cute" design _and_ being an endearing over-the-top jerkass like so many other adult animated sitcom mascots.
-   The yellow, animate sponge who is the namesake protagonist of _SpongeBob SquarePants_, who has has also been the company mascot for Nickelodeon since his debut in 1999.
-   Silkie, Starfire's pet mutant silkworm of the _Teen Titans_ animated series.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures_:
    -   Buster and Babs Bunny, who are actually based on Bugs Bunny from _Looney Tunes_, mentioned above.
    -   To a lesser extent Plucky Duck, who is similarly based on Daffy Duck.

## "Hot" Series Mascots:

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ has Rei Ayanami and, to a slightly lesser extent, Asuka Langley Soryu/Shikinami are flagship characters both for the series and for Studio Gainax (later Studio Khara) as a whole, to the point where Gainax was most (in)famous for its use and ubiquitous merchandising of Ms. Fanservice characters. Oddly enough, Rei was actually designed to be a repulsive subversion of the "moe" archetype via her nature and backstory, but it only ended up making her come across as cuter and more sympathetic, and by far the most popular character in the show (at least until Asuka started picking up in her own right).
-   Haruko is featured prominently on most cover art and promotional art for _FLCL_.

    Comic Books 

-   _Star Wars: Legacy_: Darth Talon, a red-skinned female Twi'lek in a Stripperiffic outfit, is likely the most memorable character in the comic and graces several of the covers. Probably as a consequence, making a Darth Talon cosplay toon in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ is _very_ easy: Twi'leks are one of the default race options for Sith Inquisitors, and with the _Legacy of the Sith_ update it's even possible to give her a more comic-accurate Sith Juggernaut powerset. George Lucas even reportedly considered making her a Canon Immigrant in one potential version of the _Star Wars_ sequel trilogy.

    Film 

-   The _DC Extended Universe_'s Wonder Woman, being the franchise's Breakout Character and the most buzzed about by fans and critics. Especially considering the fact that she's historically never been quite as famous as Superman or Batman.
-   Snow Queen Elsa acts as an unofficial mascot for _Frozen_. Almost all merchandise and marketing will work her in somehow.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen from _Game of Thrones_, which is appropriate since they're the resident Mr. and Ms. Fanservice of the series.
-   Cameron is practically the only character from _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ who ever got to appear on publicity images or DVD covers.

    Professional Wrestling (female examples) 

-   For All Elite Wrestling: Riho, Hikaru Shida, Britt Baker, Kris Statlander, Thunder Rosa, Jade Cargill, and Jamie Hayter are the female names most synonymous with the company.
-   GLOW had Mountain Fiji, who never won a title belt or tiara, but was still the most consistent face and defacto face of the brand after Jackie Stallone.
-   For Impact Wrestling: Gail Kim, The Beautiful People (in particular Madison Rayne and Angelina Love), Awesome Kong, ODB, Tara, Taryn Terrell, Havok, Rosemary, Su Yung, Taya Valkyrie, Tessa Blanchard, Jordynne Grace, Kiera Hogan, Deonna Purrazzo, Tasha Steelz, Masha Slamovich and Gisele Shaw are the female names most synonymous with the company.
-   Jim Cornette called Jillian Hall OVW's series mascot until she got implants and they leaked into her head.
-   For Ring of Honor: Sumie Sakai, Veda Scott, MsChif, Scarlett Bordeaux, Maria Kanellis, Mia Yim, Mercedes Martinez, Taeler Hendrix, Mandy Leon, Kelly Klein, Quinn McKay, Rok-C, Miranda Alize, Trish Adora and Max the Impaler all filled this role in the promotion's history.
-   Cheerleader Melissa for SHIMMER's ChickFight, as far as promoting for the tournament/promotion. Also of ClickWrestle, which is what ChickFight's website became after it stopped being its own promotion.
-   WWE:
    -   For the main roster women's division, Wendi Richter, Sable, Chyna, Trish Stratus, Lita, Torrie Wilson, Mickie James, Beth Phoenix, Kelly Kelly, A.J. Lee, the Bella Twins, and Ronda Rousey have all filled the role.
    -   _WWE NXT_:
        -   Paige, Emma, Dakota Kai, Asuka, Kairi Sane, Candice LeRae, Shayna Baszler, Io Shirai, Bianca Belair, Rhea Ripley, Raquel Gonzalez, Shotzi Blackheart, Zoey Stark and Sarray are the wrestlers most synonymous with the brand.
        -   For the U.K. brand, Rhea Ripley, Toni Storm, Kay Lee Ray and Meiko Satomura fill the role.
        -   For the retooled NXT 2.0/White and Gold, we have Toxic Attraction (mainly Mandy Rose), Cora Jade, Nikkita Lyons, Tiffany Stratton, Wendy Choo and Roxanne Perez.
    -   The Four Horsewomen are an interesting case: As individuals, Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch are more known for their work on the main roster, while Sasha Banks and Bayley are more synonymous with their time on NXT. As a collective they can count as mascots for both.
    -   After 2019, Becky Lynch is probably the first example of a female wrestler being a mascot of WWE as a whole rather than just its women's division.
    -   Despite not being part of the Four Horsewomen, Alexa Bliss, Asuka, and Bianca Belair also serve as mascots of WWE Women's Division since they're the only women to win both primary Women's Championships outside of the quartet and Ronda Rousey.
-   Zenjo:
    -   The Beauty Pair, its first breakout native stars.
    -   The incredibly tomboyish Crush Gals or their nemeses, The Atrocious Alliance, are the faces used when someone has to represent Zenjo.
    -   While not as often, if it's not the wrestlers mentioned above, then it will be Manami Toyota.

    Video Games 

-   One of the two actual mascots of _ARMS_ is Ribbon Girl. Her mascot status is from being the singer of the game's main theme, from which most of the music is derived, but that doesn't change the fact that she's pretty.
-   Morrigan Aensland from _Darkstalkers_ is popular enough to be the series' biggest representative in Capcom's various crossover games, surpassing the series' original protagonist Demitri Maximoff (with Felicia coming in a close second).
-   Insofar as any _Deception_ character can be considered "main", Millennia from _Kagero: Deception II_ is often seen in later games as well as any sort of crossover, such as being playable in _Warriors All-Stars_ and available as a costume in various _Dead or Alive_ and _Fatal Frame_ titles.
-   Saber (specifically the one from _Fate/stay night_) is single-handedly the most iconic Servant due to her historical gender flip and her status as a main character, which guaranteed she was given a lot of development. Proof of this is that she appears in several other installments, either as a major player or in a secondary role. And, when not, some Servant that shares her exact same model (aka, all of the Saber faces) is. She may even be seen as one for Type-Moon as a whole.
-   _Final Fantasy_ has Cloud Strife and the Warrior of Light. The former is the most iconic and popular character in the series and frequently represents the franchise in crossovers, while the latter is a modernized personification of the protagonists from the first game in the series and the "face" of the cast in the _Dissidia Final Fantasy_ games.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   Anna, who has appeared in all games to date except _Fire Emblem Gaiden_. Despite being in the series for so long, she's only playable in four mainline games (_Fire Emblem: Awakening_, _Fire Emblem Fates_, and _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, and _Fire Emblem Engage_ (though only as DLC in _Fates_ and _Three Houses_) and two spinoffs (_Fire Emblem Heroes_ and _Fire Emblem Warriors_).
    -   Marth. Being the first Lord of the series, he is well-associated with _Fire Emblem_ even though he isn't featured in all of the games. As far as _Super Smash Bros._ is concerned, Marth representing _Fire Emblem_ is akin to Mario representing the _Super Mario_ series, Link for _The Legend of Zelda_, and Pikachu for _Pokémon_.
-   Link from _The Legend of Zelda_; while mostly known for his "hot" adult forms, his child/Toon forms are clearly "cute" mascots. He's also treated as a secondary mascot for Nintendo as a whole, only behind Mario, and joins Mario as a co-mascot in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_.
-   _Mortal Kombat_ has Kitana and Sonya Blade as its main females. Mileena also maybe counts - she's probably been seen in the most provocative outfits and swimsuit issues of magazines - except her face is explicitly meant to evoke the opposite reaction, so your mileage may vary.
-   _Onmyoji_ has the handsome protagonist Abe no Seimei on its logo.
-   _Overwatch_:
    -   Tracer is the face of the game, being the character most featured in the animated trailers and the only character featured on the box art. Everyone on the development team loved her, and commented about how cute and beautiful she is.
    -   D.Va is also this to a lesser, albeit increasing, extent, mostly due to her explosion in popularity after the game's release.
-   Bella Goth started out as a Morticia Addams expy in _The Sims_ before skyrocketing in popularity and becoming a mascot for _The Sims_ series as a whole.
-   SNK:
    -   Mai Shiranui from _Fatal Fury_ and _The King of Fighters_ is pretty much the female face of the company.
    -   For male characters, the top candidates are _Fatal Fury_ protagonist Terry Bogard, _Art of Fighting_ protagonist Ryo Sakazaki, _King of Fighters_ protagonist Kyo Kusanagi, and the latter's arch-rival Iori Yagami.
-   Ivy Valentine is easily the most recognizable female character from the _Soul Series_, with Taki being runner-up.
-   Ryu and Chun-Li became faces of the _Street Fighter_ franchise. Ken, Guile, Zangief, M. Bison, Cammy, Akuma, and Juri also qualify to a lesser extent.
-   _Tekken_:
    -   Nina Williams is undoubtedly _Tekken_'s best known female character, being the only woman to appear in every game in the series so far.
    -   The next best known after that is probably Ling Xiaoyu, though she seems to straddle the line between the "cute" and "hot" categories.
    -   For more recently introduced female characters, Asuka Kazama and Lili Rochefort count.

    Webcomics 

-   Shelley Winters in _Scary Go Round_. After her introduction, she slowly became the main character and the emblem of the comic. Even after _Scary Go Round_ ended, she still appears in its successor _Bad Machinery_'s banners and the artist's blog.

    Web Original 

-   Lia Marie Johnson was undisputedly the face of the _React_ series in the first six seasons. Since her departure/sabbatical, each of the shows have had at least one (e.g Mikaela, Chelsea, and Tori for _Teens_, or Tom and the original Madison for _Adults_. _YouTubers_ is too much of an All-Star Cast to have one).

## "Recognizable" Series Mascots:

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Attack on Titan_ has the Colossal Titan as the most recognizable character from the series, and used in a lot of merchandise and public appearances. Sometimes, it is played straight as a 60-meter skinless horror. Other times, however, it's either an Ugly Cute chibi or a dude in a costume that behaves in a comical fashion (nicknamed "Kyojin-kun" or "Giant-kun").
-   _Cells at Work!_ uses White Blood Cell U-1146. Whether or not he's the main character of an arc, he's on all of the volume covers. He even serves as the Info Dump narration box in the _Bacteria_ spinoff.
-   In _Free!_, Iwatobi-chan is the protagonists' hometown mascot. It's a distinctive rock-headed bird-like... thing, popular among fans as a decal.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ has Jotaro Kujo, the badass protagonist of the third part, _Stardust Crusaders_, as its mascot.
-   Evangelion Unit-01 is the most prominent icon of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, despite its pilot Shinji Ikari being marketed less compared to the female leads.
-   The resident monster Mooks in _Symphogear_, the Noise, are this.

    Comic Books 

-   Robotman for the _Doom Patrol_; the most recognizable full-fledged member (not counting Beast Boy, who's more associated with the Titans) and the only one to be in every iteration of the team.

    Film 

-   The titular extraterrestrial creatures from the _Alien_, _Predator_, and _Alien vs. Predator_ franchises.
-   Along with Wonder Woman above, the _DC Extended Universe_ also has Superman, as he started the whole thing and is always hyped by the producers and higher ups.
-   Ash Williams for the _Evil Dead_ films, making it one of the few horror movie franchises known more for its hero than its villain.
-   _Ghostbusters_:
    -   The Ugly Cute Slimer.
    -   The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. In universe, it's explained that he's the mascot for a brand of marshmallows and the star of his own cartoon TV series.
    -   The "NO-GHOST" company logo also serves as a mascot.
-   The Tyrannosaurus rex for the _Jurassic Park_ franchise (its skeleton being the franchise's icon proper).
-   Gollum, Gandalf, and the Eye of Sauron are all used prominently in merchandise for _The Lord of the Rings_ movies.
-   _The Pink Panther (1963)_ has an Animated Credits Opening with the titular diamond's flaw visualized as what it's said to resemble — a pink panther. The animated character was so popular that he got his own series of animated shorts in addition to becoming the mascot for the movie series, even as Artifact Title set in.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   Mainly Darth Vader, though mascot duties have also been passed around to Yoda, the Stormtroopers, and (especially in the franchise's early days) R2-D2 and C-3PO. Even the Death Star is something of an icon for the franchise.
    -   The original promotional campaign for _The Phantom Menace_ treated Jar Jar Binks as something of a mascot, which the two subsequent prequels backpedaled away from for obvious reasons. Darth Maul is likely the most iconic character from _The Phantom Menace_ and the prequels as a whole.
    -   _The Force Awakens_ adds Kylo Ren as its resident Vader counterpart, as well as BB-8.
-   For the _Terminator_ series, Arnold's iconic face has been etched into our collective memories. The metallic skull of the T-800 Terminator would also count as iconic.

    Literature 

-   Aslan for _The Chronicles of Narnia_, to the point that some editions of the books even use his face as part of the logo.
-   Despite only featuring in one of H. P. Lovecraft's original stories, and being nowhere _near_ as powerful as the likes of Azathoth or Yog-Sothoth, Great Cthulhu is essentially this for the Cthulhu Mythos.
-   Rincewind, Death, the Librarian, and Great A'Tuin for _Discworld_. Granny Weatherwax doesn't quite make it, possibly because she just looks like a Witch Classic, whereas a wizard with a straggly beard and "WIZZARD" written on his hat is more distinctive.
-   Tolkien's Legendarium:
    -   Smaug, the dragon who guards the treasure the main character Bilbo is after, is this for _The Hobbit_.
    -   Gandalf is often this for both _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_, being the character most likely to appear on any of the covers.
-   Even languages and writing systems have these:
    -   Spanish has the enye Ññ.
    -   German has the umlauted vowels: Ää Öö Üü : and, to a lesser extent, the eszett ß.
    -   The Cyrillic script has Ya and I, better known to Latin-script users as "the backwards R" (Яя) and "the backwards N" (Ии).
    -   The International Phonetic Alphabet has the schwa /ə/.
    -   The Unicode character set used by all electronics nowadays, as a way to fit all of the world's languages into one encoding, has the "replacement character" $ - which started out as a Missingno-type Glitch Entity, but later morphed to a Good Bad Bug, and later an Ascended Glitch.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Barry Allen/The Flash for the _Arrowverse_. He's always front and center in the franchise's promotional materials, not to mention his eponymous show being the most popular and acclaimed.
-   The "Grr Argh" monster from _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, whom you may remember as the badly-drawn monster that appears after every credits sequence. Not only does Tara quote Mutant Enemy's mascot, it sums up the Tear Jerker episode "Becoming" **perfectly**:
    
    "Ooohhh, I need a hug."
    
-   _Doctor Who_'s sentient Cool Ship, the TARDIS. To the point where when the Metropolitan Police tried to trademark the police box and sue The BBC for infringement, the judge ruled that the rights belonged the BBC, since they had been selling merchandise without any complaints for nearly _40 years_!
-   Sitcoms usually have title characters or breakout characters, like Steve Urkel from _Family Matters_.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Direwolves serve as this; they're the sigil of House Stark and commonly appear in the show.
    -   Daenerys is already mentioned above in the "hot" category, but her dragons can count, especially Drogon.

-   Kamen Rider #1 for the _Kamen Rider_ series.
-   Tatiana Maslany for _Orphan Black_. Much of the series' acclaim stems from the fact that she played half of the main cast, _including_ The Hero.
-   Akaranger, who is typically the leader for the Ranger teams, and also Akared, a Physical God embodiment of the former, for the _Super Sentai_ franchise.
-   Ultraman, Ultraseven, Ultraman Taro, and Ultraman Tiga for the _Ultra Series_ franchise.
-   Insofar as a Speculative Documentary can be considered to have a mascot, _Walking with Dinosaurs_ really went out of its way to promote _Liopleurodon_ as its go-to signature beast when it first aired. It didn't really take, mostly because it fell victim to Science Marches On.

    Print Media 

-   _Nintendo Power_ had Nester, a snarky redheaded teen that starred in the magazine's _Howard and Nester_ and _Nester's Adventures_ comics.

    Professional Wrestling (male examples) 

-   For All Elite Wrestling: Cody Rhodes, Chris Jericho, Kenny Omega, The Young Bucks, Jon Moxley, Darby Allin, and MJF are the names most synonymous with the company.
-   All Japan Pro Wrestling had Giant Baba, The Four Pillars (Toshiaki Kawada, Mitsuharu Misawa, Kenta Kobashi and Akira Taue), Stan Hansen (whom they poached from NJPW), Bruiser Brody (more so to overseas audiences than in Japan proper), and Genichiro Tenryu (until Baba banned him from the company). Kazushige Nosawa gets a lot of press in the Americas but is otherwise pretty minor.
-   CMLL:
    -   El Santo and, to a lesser extent, Blue Demon, each having their own "Legend" Tournament annually.
    -   The promotion tried this with Rush the first time he won a body building contest, going so far as to bill him as "Mr. CMLL". It didn't really work out.
-   Jerry Lawler for CWA, Memphis Wrestling and USWA, if hairy chests are your thing. The King made a lot of money selling pictures of himself shirtless in various poses.
-   _ECW_: Tazz, Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Raven, Tommy Dreamer, and Sandman are the ones who people think most when talking about the company. For the revival, CM Punk and Christian were the main faces of the brand.
-   Rikidozan was the big star of the JWA, but the mascots were his successors, the Tag Team known as BI Cannon (Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba). For better or worse they broke JWA in half and founded their own companies (AJPW and NJPW).
-   Ring of Honor: The Briscoes are the long lasting icons of the promotion, no matter the era they compete. Delirious, Caprice Coleman, Rhett Titus and Roderick Strong also apply to a lesser extent. Specifically, we got:
    -   Bryan Danielson, Samoa Joe, CM Punk, Christopher Daniels, Low Ki, Nigel McGuinness, Kevin Steen, El Generico, Homicide, Chris Hero, Claudio Castagnoli, Eddie Edwards, Davey Richards and Tyler Black in the classic era.
    -   Jay Lethal, Kenny King, Adam Cole, Re Dragon (Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish), The Kingdom/The OGK (Matt Taven and Mike Bennett), Dalton Castle, Silas Young, Cody Rhodes and The Young Bucks (both representing Bullet Club first and later forming The Elite), Marty Scurll, Flip Gordon and Jonathan Gresham in the Sinclair era, for the better or worse.
-   Dr. Cube for Kaiju Big Battel. He's the Big Bad, in case you're wondering.
-   While the National Wrestling Alliance World Tag Team Titles were their most disputed belts until the records were wiped in the mid nineteen nineties, pretty much everyone could agree that the faces of the division until then were The Rock 'n' Roll Express. The Ricky Morton trope was based on the fact that the easiest way to earn the ire of the female audience members was usually beating up poor Ricky.
-   _New Japan Pro-Wrestling_: Antonio Inoki, Vader, Shinya Hashimoto, Tiger Mask, Great Muta/Keiji Mutoh, Jushin Thunder Liger (in the US and Mexico), Masahiro Chono, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Shinsuke Nakamura, Kazuchika Okada, CHAOS, Bullet Club (Kenny Omega to an extent), and Los Ingobernables de Japon (especially Tetsuya Naito) are the ones people think most of when talking about the company.
-   Pro Wrestling NOAH is most synonymous with Mitsuharu Misawa and Kenta Kobashi. Not far behind though are Kenta Kobayashi, Takashi Sugiura, Naomichi Marufuji, and Go Shiozaki.
-   Most tag team-based companies of the 1980-90s had their own version of the Rock N Roll Express above to use when the originals were not available. Perhaps most infamous were The Thrill Seekers of SMW, since despite being pushed for their sex appeal they wouldn't actually deliver to ring rats, as one was Happily Married and the other had a type.
-   AJ Styles for TNA, to the point that fans, critics, _and_ wrestling personalities themselves universally agree that the company truly died upon his departure. Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins thought he could save the company with a movie about Matt Hardy, who became unexpectedly popular after Styles left, but he was overruled. Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Christopher Daniels, Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin), James Storm and both of his teammates (Chris Harris for America's Most Wanted and Bobby Roode for Beer Money), Shawn Hernandez, Eric Young, Petey Williams and Sting also count, to a lesser extent.
    -   For the Anthem Era, we have Eddie Edwards, Sami Callihan, Moose, Rich Swann, Brian Cage, Eli Drake, Killer Kross, Josh Alexander and Steve Maclin as the top stars of Impact Wrestling. For the X-Division, we have Trey Miguel, Mike Bailey, Ace Austin and Chris Bey as well.
-   Toryumon and Dragon Gate had Último Dragón and CIMA, Dragon Kid, and BXB Hulk to a lesser extent. Akira Tozawa is often thought of as the MVP of the latter promotion in the US and promoted as such there, but in Japan that was only in 2015. Shingo Takagi, Naruki Doi, Masato Yoshino, and YAMATO may also qualify.
-   _WCW_: Sting, Ric Flair, Goldberg, and the n.W.o, and to a lesser extent Diamond Dallas Page and Booker T, are the ones people think most of when talking about the company.
-   _WWE_:
    -   By era:
        -   Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF Era.
        -   Hulk Hogan and to a lesser extent Randy Savage for the WWE Golden Age Era.
        -   Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels for the WWE New Generation Era.
        -   "Stone Cold" Steve Austin and The Rock for the Attitude Era, with Triple H and Mick Foley rounding out the "Big Four".
        -   Triple H, Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, Shawn Michaels, and Eddie Guerrero for the early 2000s.
        -   John Cena for the late 2000s, with Batista, Edge, and Randy Orton rounding out the "Big Four" of the late 2000s (or "Big Five" if Rey Mysterio is also counted).
        -   CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and The Shield for the early 2010s.
        -   Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, The New Day, and AJ Styles for the late 2010s.
        -   Drew McIntyre, Bobby Lashley and Cody Rhodes for the 2020s.
        -   The Undertaker as an era-transcending icon.
        -   Vince McMahon, for being the longtime head of the company.
    -   By brand:
        -   _WWE Raw_: "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Chris Jericho, Kane, John Cena, Randy Orton, CM Punk, Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins are the wrestlers most synonymous with the brand.
        -   _WWE Smackdown_: The Rock, The Undertaker, Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, John Cena, Batista, Edge, Daniel Bryan, The New Day, Dean Ambrose, AJ Styles and Roman Reigns are the wrestlers most synonymous with the brand.
        -   _WWE NXT_
        -   Competition format: The Nexus and Daniel Bryan are the names most synonymous with the brand.
        -   Black and Gold Era: Sami Zayn, Kevin Owens, Finn Balor, Samoa Joe, Johnny Gargano, Tommaso Ciampa, Ricochet, Aleister Black, The Undisputed Era (featuring Roderick Strong), Damian Priest, Keith Lee, Karrion Kross, Legado del Fantasma (mainly Santos Escobar), Cameron Grimes, Dexter Lumis, LA Knight and Diamond Mine (also featuring the aforementioned Strong) are the wrestlers most synonymous with the brand.
        -   NXT UK: British Strong Style, Pretty Deadly, Ilja Dragunov, Tyler Bate and IMPERIUM (especially Walter) fill the role.
        -   NXT 2.0/White and Gold: Bron Breakker, Tony D'Angelo, Solo Sikoa, Grayson Waller, Andre Chase, Von Wagner, The Creed Brothers, Joe Gacy and Carmelo Hayes are the top names from the retooled show.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Battletech_ has had three over its long run, all three iconic Battlemechs:
    -   The beginning of the franchise had the WHM-6R _Warhammer_ heavy Battlemech as the mascot, featuring it heavily on the front pages of the manual and in much of the early press material. Unfortunately, the _Warhammer_'s artwork was originally licensed from an anime, which has caused _decades_ of legal trouble with the litigation-happy US distributor of the anime, so it was dropped like a pile of bricks in the mid 1990s. Following a redesign of the 'mech's appearance that made it physically distinct from its originator, the _Warhammer_ eventually began showing up in official artwork once more, but became mostly superseded by the below two as mascots.
    -   Following the release of the Clan Invasion storyline and the _MechWarrior_ video games, and the massive upshoot in popularity for the franchise, the _Timber Wolf/Mad Cat_ heavy 'mech became the mascot for both the game series and for most of the franchise set after 3049 In-Universe. The _Timber Wolf_ is still _the_ iconic battlemech for many of the franchise's fans as a result, and also because it is one of the most powerful 'mechs to drop on the table in a match. (And calling it the _Mad Cat_ among the wrong group of fans will get you labeled a stravag freebirth.)
    -   Following the _Warhammer_ being taken out of official artwork, the duty of official mascot of franchise material set before the introduction of the Clans (such as the Star League and Succession Wars era) went to the AS7-D _Atlas_ assault Battlemech, a massive skull-faced, broad-shouldered death machine often depicted ripping enemy battlemechs limb from limb. Its skull-faced visage is part of the logo for the 2018 _Battletech_ video game, with the story mode itself featuring an SLDF Atlas II as Kamea's second 'mech.
-   Warforged fill this role for the _Dungeons & Dragons_ setting Eberron.
-   The Lady of Pain for the _Planescape_ setting; her ominous face with her cold stare is on the cover of every product.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: The Space Marines are the main mascots. Especially the Ultramarines, who appear in most of the promotional artwork and the starter set; they are even called "poster boys" by players of other armies.

    Theater 

-   Cirque du Soleil shows often start with a stylized logo in print ads and at their website, but eventually switch to a memorable supporting character (or representative of a memorable character group) to serve as the show's face. This is particularly important with the Las Vegas resident shows, since as many as eight different shows are running there at one time; a well-chosen mascot helps establish the style/tone that makes the production distinct from its sisters.
    -   _Le Cirque Réinventé_ and _Fascination_ — The King of Fools.
    -   _Mystère_ — The Red Bird (the Ensemble Dark Horse dancer).
    -   _Alegría_ — A Nymph for the original staging, Monsieur Fleur for the 2019 revival.
    -   _Quidam_ — The Target (one of the heroine's sidekicks).
    -   _"O"_ — The Zebras.
    -   _La Nouba_ — The Green Bird (another Ensemble Dark Horse dancer).
    -   _Dralion_ — Yao (one of the four gods).
    -   _KÀ_ — The Twins.
    -   _The Beatles LOVE_ — Sergeant Pepper.
    -   _KOOZA_ — The Trickster.
    -   _Zarkana_ — Tarantula the spider woman.
    -   _Crystal_ — The titular heroine.

    Toys 

-   Croco Bile from _Flush Force_ is commonly used as the lead Flushie.
-   Blow Fly and Trash-A-Pillar from _The Trash Pack_. They're both the main characters of the webseries, too.

    Video Games 

-   Spring Man is one of the two true mascots of _ARMS_, presented to players as an easy character to learn to play with and renowned in the story mode as an exemplary fighter all others are measured against.
-   Ezio Auditore from _Assassin's Creed_. The only character in the franchise to have his own trilogy.

-   The _Borderlands_ series also has the Psycho Bandit, as they tend to be featured on the games' covers. A Psycho is even one of the playable characters in _Borderlands 2_.
-   Capcom:
    -   On the "non-cute" side side of _Mega Man_ mascots, there's Zero and the Sniper Joes.
    -   Ryu, who doubles as the Series Mascot for _Street Fighter_ and the face of Capcom's fighting game division.
    -   For being the original protagonist, Dante is the main representative of the _Devil May Cry_ series, appearing as the usual Guest Fighter in many Crossover events of other franchises. He's also the original face of Stylish Action games.
    -   The _Monster Hunter_ series has the Rathalos as its non-cute mascot. Each game in the series also has a flagship monster that usually plays a significant role in the plot.
    -   _Resident Evil_:
        -   Chris Redfield is this overall, though it's downplayed since he doesn't appear in every game, and this role zigzags with Jill Valentine, his sister Claire Redfield, and Leon Scott Kennedy, depending on the game.
        -   Jack Baker for _Resident Evil 7: Biohazard_.
            
            "Welcome to the family, son!"
            
        -   Lady Alcina Dimitrescu for _Resident Evil Village_.

-   _Civilization_ has an unofficial example in Mahatma Gandhi, or more specifically the "Nuclear Gandhi" characterization that appears in the games, stemming from how his AI's attempts at deterring war in _Civ I_, supposedly due to a programming oversight, boiled down to threatening to nuke anyone who crossed him. So pictures of a wanly smiling Gandhi posing next to ICBMs or boasting how his "words are backed with NUCLEAR WEAPONS!" have become a shorthand for the _Civ_ games and their capacity to make some Alternate History.
-   Bad Mister Frosty in the _ClayFighter_ series, who appears on the cover art for every game and is prominently featured in adveertising.

-   The Green Beret for _Commandos_. Interestingly, he is a rare example of a series mascot who is the main character.
-   David Jones from the _Criminal Case_ franchise, being the most prominent character across all seasons both in-game and among the fandom.
-   _Custom Robo_ has the Ray series of Shining Fighter class robos, one of which represents the franchise in _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_.
-   _Danganronpa_ obviously has its Big Bad Monokuma.
-   Thorn from _Destiny_. An unusual example in that it's a gun, not a sentient being. We think? It's appeared on a lot of posters for _Destiny_ and was highly publicized by the devs before the game's release, up to and including some of them carrying a prop of it across Europe. It's easy to see why they'd use it to capture the public imagination — the thing looks weird, and Obviously Evil. Plus, it captures the Cosmic Horror Story aspects of the game rather well.
-   The Cacodemon for _Doom_, even becoming the official mascot for Doomworld, the biggest _Doom_ fansite.

-   Captain Falcon, the stern (and occasionaly Hot-Blooded) bounty-hunting racer of the _F-Zero_ series.

-   Fulgore from _Killer Instinct_ is the most recognizable from the game, despite not being the main character.
-   The Gas Mask Helghan troopers in _Killzone_.
-   Nugget is the character featured on most of the merchandise for the _Kindergarten_ games. He wasn't originally designed to be this, but got the role when his amusing Cloudcuckoolander personality made him the Ensemble Dark Horse of the first game.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Link and his various incarnations serve as the face of the series, with advertising often defaulting to the Link from the most recent title.
    -   The fairies, Navi and her ball-of-light kin in particular; they tend to be used as menu cursors.

-   _Metroid_:
    -   Series protagonist Samus Aran, who is mainly portrayed as a mysterious masked badass type of character.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   The eponymous energy-sucking, flying, fanged jellyfish aliens of the series as well; very young infants are Ugly Cute, though.
-   _Mortal Kombat_:
    -   The spectral Ninja be seen as Scorpion has gradually become the mascot of the series. Sub-Zero is a close second, being the first "ninja" that the developers created. Scorpy and Subby have been the default fighters for player 1 and 2 respectively since _Deadly Alliance_. As of _Mortal Kombat 2011_, a Scorpion look-alike also serves as the figure on the logo for NetherRealm Studios, making him a company mascot as well.
    -   Liu Kang can also be considered the mascot of the series, being the longest-running protagonist by far. His ability to shape-shift into a dragon evokes the iconic logoa after all, even before said dragon was redesigned from klassic green to chrome black.
    -   In many ways, Raiden can be seen as a mascot for the series as well due to his iconic look and status as the Big Good in almost all the games, including the one where he was the counterpart to the DC Universe's own Superman.

-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Pikachu became this for the franchise as a whole, as well as doubling as the company mascot for The Pokémon Company. Being one of the only available electric type Pokémon before Cerulean City helped solidify its status over the original intended mascot Clefairy. As a nod to Pikachu's status as mascot, every generation since has its own electric rodent meant to resemble Pikachu.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Later on, Breakout Character Eevee started being marketed as a direct counterpart to Pikachu, especially in _Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!_, and as such it seemed to become the secondary mascot of the franchise.
    -   The series also has "Version Mascots", which are the Mons that appear on the front cover of each version. Usually they're the Legendary Pokémon that can be caught in the game.
    -   Gaiden Fighting Game _Pokkén Tournament_ has Pikachu Libre — Pikachu in a Masked Luchador costume — as its de facto series mascot, both because it sums up the hybrid game style, and because it's a Pikachu in a luchador costume.

-   Nightmare for the _Soul_ series, who represents the series' evil sword Soul Edge. Some of this is made nil by the fact that Nightmare is Soul Edge/Inferno's _host_ (and in _SCIII_ and _SCIV_, Nightmare is literally the living incarnation of Soul Edge). Nightmare, however, was featured on the Project Soul logo from _SCIII_ up to _SCV_ (wherein the logo was redesigned to show a re-imagining of the Soul Embrace from _SCIII_, which was then changed back to the original logo starting with the _SCII HD Online_ re-release) and is essentially the central antagonist of the series starting in his _Soulcalibur_ debut (Soul Edge/Inferno being the _de facto_ Big Bad), making Nightmare's claims have a bit more weight to them. Ironically, most installments in the series (and all installments featuring Nightmare himself) are named after Soul Edge's heroic counterpart Soul Calibur.
-   _Super Robot Wars_: The SRX is the mascot of the series and Banpresto in general. It has a head shaped like the company logo, and its Game-Breaker upgraded form is even named _Banpreios_!
-   _Splatoon_:
    -   While the playable Inklings are highly customizable, in the first game, an orange female Inkling takes front and center in several trailers and pieces of official artwork, with her also representing the series in games such as _Super Smash Bros._ and _Mario Kart_. She is sometimes accompanied by a blue male Inkling as her rival as well. Each game would continue to have their own represenatives though: _Splatoon 2_ uses a short-haired pink female inking with a green male rival, while _Splatoon 3_ uses a yellow Inkling with Fashionable Asymmetry and a purple Octoling rival, as well as an additional bespectacled red Inkling to represent the game's Tricolor Turf Wars.
    -   Each game also introduces an idol group who also host a news broadcast detailing in-game events, and collectively serve as additional mascots for their respective games. The first game has the Squid Sisters, consisting of pop singers Callie and Marie; _Splatoon 2_ has rapper-and-DJ duo Off the Hook, made up of Pearl and Marina; and _Splatoon 3_ introduces Deep Cut, a three-person band consisting of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man.
-   _Team Fortress 2_ is represented by The Heavy. He is front and center _everywhere_ in the game. He's the very center in the class selection, he was the first to get a "Meet The" video, with cameos in every single video since, he's right there on the boxart, and his loud, scenery-chewing, BRIAN BLESSED\-rivaling presence draws attention to him even more than his _massive_ size. He's also a company mascot, as he represents Valve in most third-party promotions and crossovers.
-   _Tekken_ has the main trio of Big Bad Heihachi Mishima, his son Kazuya Mishima, and Kazuya's son Jin Kazama.
-   Wild Dog fills this role in _Time Crisis_, taking the role of The Dragon to the Big Bad of each game in the main series, despite every defeat having him seemingly killed by an explosion.

-   Sweet Tooth (Needles Kane) is considered this for the _Twisted Metal_ franchise overall, to the point where he appeared in _PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale_ to represent the series.
-   Because of the mysteries revolving around him and the amount of shit you eat in his boss fight, Sans the skeleton became a fan favorite for _Undertale_ fans. The announcement of his Mii suit in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_ overshadowed Terry's full character release!
-   In _Warframe_, every new warframe (or otherwise) usually gets a turn in the mascot spotlight, featuring in their own promotional or splash screen art when their respective update is released. However, the biggest, most permanent mascot is the Excalibur warframe, which either gets a prominent role or otherwise features in most promotional content (either fully visible or as a silhouette) to show off any non-signature weapons or cosmetics.

    Web Original 

-   Serperior for the _Mario Party TV_ series, because it's Mr. Doom's favorite Pokémon.
-   Newgrounds often advertises with characters from their most popular hosted series, but two faces stand out over the rest:
    -   Pico is a creation of website founder Tom Fulp, who also doubles as mascot of his home series. Nene is often used as Pico's female counterpart in ads, while Darnell ocasionally appears as a mascot for various aspects of the site.
    -   While the Tankman was originally a simple Mascot, logo designer JohnnyUtah eventually created a series of shorts about them, which became the basis for all future appearances.
-   _SCP Foundation_:

-   The WWWF Grudge Match had Mr. T, who won the honor in a match with Mr. Clean, and then kept it in a match with Jesse Ventura.

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_: Roger Smith the alien, is undoubtedly the most recognizable character in the series.
-   For _Family Guy_, both Peter Griffin, the show's Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist, and his megalomaniacal son Stewie seem to be equally recognizable.
-   _Filmation's Ghostbusters_ have Belfry the pink bat; the Ghostbuggy; Prime Evil, the series Big Bad; and Tracy, the gorilla.

-   Bart Simpson was the first big mascot for _The Simpsons_. Remember all the T-shirts from the 90's with "Ay Caramba" and "Don't Have a Cow, Man!", not to mention "Do the Bartman"? Eventually the position was taken over by his father Homer Simpson instead, whose distinctive face will always show up in promotional content and licensed merchandise.

-   Owen is the primary advertising figure of the _Total Drama_ series, partly because he was the first winner, and because kids (the series' target audience) really love him. Chris McLean, the sadistic host of the show, also counts.
-   Optimus Prime, the leader for the good guys the Autobots, is this in almost every _Transformers_ incarnation. Though after the live-action movie, Bumblebee started giving him a run for his money.

## Company Mascots:

    Anime and Manga 

-   _AstroBoy_ alongside _Kimba the White Lion_ and _Unico_ serves as this for Tezuka Productions. A Japanese production company that holds the rights to all of Osamu Tezuka's manga and works, alongside other animated content.
-   Aside from an original dragon creature, Doraemon serves as the mascot for _CoroCoro Comic_.
-   Goku and the Holy Shonen Trinity aka the Big Three (Luffy, Naruto, and Ichigo) for _Shonen Jump_. Though the company's oldest and longest lasting mascot (to the point that it's still used today) is the emblem of a pirate with a beard, hat, and eye patch. The main protagonist (usually) serves as a mascot for their respective series on the issue covers, and promotional material for _Shonen Jump_ as a whole (this is true of other manga magazines as well).

    Comic Books 

-   _2000 AD_ is represented by Tharg the Mighty, a green-skinned alien who claims to be the editor of the Galaxy's Greatest Comic.
-   The title character Archie Andrews represents _Archie Comics_.

    Film — Animation 

-   Disney:
    -   Mickey Mouse is undoubtedly one of the most famous mascots of all time, serving as the face of the Walt Disney Company. His friends Donald Duck and Goofy aren't too far behind either.
    -   To a (much) lesser extent, Tinkerbell; Walt Disney used her as the mascot for _Walt Disney Presents_, as well as the original ad campaigns for Disneyland (this was at ABC's insistence; they didn't want the project to take Mickey down with it if it tanked). She's also used in place of Mickey as the mascot of the 1994-1999 _Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection_ of VHS tapes and Laserdiscs, Disney DVD, and Disney's FastPlay.
    -   Similar to Tinkerbell, Jiminy Cricket also become a secondary mascot and served as the spokesperson for The Walt Disney Company. Jiminy even hosted occasional TV Specials, albums, shows at the Disney Theme Parks, and hosted a few vacation planning videos for Walt Disney World.
    -   Pixar:
        -   Luxo Jr. the lamp, which appears in the studio's Vanity Plate.
        -   Buzz Lightyear also qualifies, being the most popular Pixar character.
-   Universal:
    -   DreamWorks Animation:
        -   The kid on the moon<small>◊</small>, which appears in the logo (and which is also this for DreamWorks SKG<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ).
        -   Shrek also qualifies, being their most famous and recognizable character.
    -   The Minions from the _Despicable Me_ series serve as this for Illumination Entertainment.

    New Media 

-   The 2ch cats, particularly Mona.
-   Ruby Rose is this for Rooster Teeth, given the massive popularity of her show. She's the focus of tons of merchandise, makes a cameo appearance in _Ready Player One_, and is even the icon for their animation YouTube channel.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Captain New Japan, a superhero Tag Team specialist who has the New Japan Pro-Wrestling company logo on his costume.
-   Captain NOAH, an identity "awarded" Mohammad Yone in Pro Wrestling NOAH.
-   Suicide, a wrestling gimmick created for the TNA Impact videogame and became later a Canon Immigrant portrayed by different wrestlers in the roster.

    Toys 

-   Wooser of _Wooser's Hand-to-Mouth Life_ serves as one for Good Smile Company, with him making frequent cameos in shows the company sponsors.

    Video Games 

-   Amstrad's first-party label Amsoft named its mascot after executive Roland Perry. Roland became the star of eight mediocre to awful games, which never established any consistent model for drawing him.

-   Atlus Corporation:
    -   Jack Frost from the _Shin Megami Tensei_ franchise is a recognizable Atlus mascot. While the monsters you meet in _Shin Megami Tensei_ are based on mythologies, possibly because of Jack Frost's status as a mascot, you will meet original Jack Frosts like King Frost, Black Frost, Ichigo Frost, B Hawaii Frost, Lemon Frost, Melon Frost, Mirukin Frost, Frost Five, and Lucifrost. _Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army_ has the dapperest Frost of them all.
    -   In later years, Teddie from _Persona 4_ seems to have taken over Jack Frost as the company mascot. Fitting, considering that Teddie became the in-universe mascot of the local Junes department store.
-   Pac-Man, the face of his own franchise and Bandai Namco Entertainment's mascot for over 30 years. He has had a few redesigns here and there but still manages to be one of their most popular characters.
-   Until he was displaced by Mega Man (Classic) and Ryu, Captain Commando was the face of Capcom.
-   The Japanese mobile game company COLOPL, Inc.'s mascot is Kuma the Bear, who appears in many of their games.
-   Compile's cute mascot, Randar (or Lander), appeared in several of their games before being replaced by _Puyo Puyo_'s Carbuncle during the mid-90's.
-   Kirby can easily be considered the unofficial mascot of HAL Laboratory. Over the years, he also became a mascot for _Super Smash Bros._, being face-to-face with Mario in the first game and being the only survivor of the Big Bad's attacks in _Ultimate_.
-   Hudson Soft:
    -   The company's primary mascot is a tiny bee. The bee has shown up in several of Hudson's video games, including _Adventure Island_ and _Milon's Secret Castle_.
    -   Aside from the logo bee, Hudson usually treats Bonk and Bomberman as their mascot characters.
-   Humongous Entertainment has its four main protagonists of their Junior Adventure series: Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish, SPY Fox, and Pajama Sam (plus Putt-Putt and Freddi’s respective sidekicks Pep and Luther), and _Backyard Sports_' ace athlete Pablo Sanchez.
-   Konami:
    -   They tried in the late 1980s to establish Konami Man as their mascot. He never really caught on, though _Konami Wai Wai World_ gave him the leading part and a Distaff Counterpart, Konami Lady. He still makes occasional cameos in _Castlevania_ games.
    -   Solid Snake and Simon Belmont also qualify, due to being the heroes of some of Konami's biggest franchises. After Konami fully absorbed Hudson Soft, Bomberman also served this role to an extent.
-   Unofficially, Max for LucasArts' adventure games.
-   Nintendo: There's Mario, the main character of the _Super Mario_ series and its numerous spin-offs, who is the mascot for Nintendo as a whole. To a slightly lesser extent, Mario is the face of the cast in the _Super Smash Bros._ crossovers, and is joined by Link in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_. Other characters from the _Super Mario_ series will follow along, and the theme park Super Nintendo World is solely based on the series.
-   Asagi serves as one for Nippon Ichi (along with the Prinnies mentioned above), as she makes a cameo in all of their games.
    -   For a time, the company used Nisa (a Moe Anthropomorphism representing the company in _Neptunia_) as their mascot.
-   Unofficially, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were the mascots for Rare back when it was still with Nintendo, and so was Banjo and Kazooie. In the New Tens, Rash started taking over this role for the company.

-   Sonic The Hedgehog has been Sega's mascot since 1991. Alex Kidd is commonly remembered as having been Sega's mascot before Sonic, though Opa-Opa was actually used more often for cameos back then.
-   In Japan, Sony Computer Entertainment has a mascot known as "Toro Inoue" (the Sony Cat). He's an anthropomorphic cat in a Super-Deformed style. Outside of Japan, Sony has had more than temporary mascots (Crash Bandicoot probably being the most famous) but none have really been their official one.
-   The Giant Intelligent Friendly Talking Spiders (GIFTS) are a company mascot for Spiderweb Software, showing up in every game of the _Exile_ series, the _Avernum_ remake series, and _Nethergate_.
-   Toaplan has Pipiru, who appears at the end of _Zero Wing_ and is hidden in _Out Zone_ and _Truxton II_. Even after Toaplan went defunct, Pipiru briefly appeared in a cutscene in _DonPachi_.
-   Neko-Arc (a comedic miniature catgirl form of _Tsukihime_'s main heroine) is the official mascot of Type-Moon and the _Nasuverse_.
-   Shantae for WayForward Technologies.
-   Xbox tried the cute variation with _Blinx_, but the series ended up being a Stillborn Franchise when the game was criticized for its clunky controls. Master Chief is considered the Xbox mascot now.
-   _Devolver Digital_ parodied the concept of video game mascots in their 2023 Direct with "Volvy the Vole", the supposed mascot of Devolver who was once considered the most popular video game mascot of his time and had even appeared in prior DD works such as _Cult of the Lamb_ and _Hotline Miami_ until an overly edgy 7th Gen version of the character caused him to be retired. Officially, Devolver has no real mascot.

    Western Animation 

-   Bob and Larry from _VeggieTales_ are featured on the logo of Big Idea (the company that made this show).
-   True and the Wishes are the most commonly advertised characters of Guru Studio, even moreso than the studio's biggest hit.
-   Warner Bros. Discovery:
    -   The WB television network used Michigan J. Frog as one.
    -   Most logos throughout the history of Warner Bros. Animation used Bugs Bunny, but starting in 2018, Daffy (with his wackier Bob Clampett persona) started being used.
    -   Hanna-Barbera: Originally, Huckleberry Hound and Yogi Bear served as these for the company. Next it was Fred Flintstone. Now Scooby-Doo and Shaggy remain their best-remembered and most marketable characters well into the 21st century.
-   Woody Woodpecker served as the official mascot for Universal Studios and it's theme park division of the same name.
