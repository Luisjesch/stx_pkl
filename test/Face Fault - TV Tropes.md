Sometimes a character is so shocked or surprised by an absurdity, non sequitur, or incredibly stupid remark from another character that the listener actually faints. The remark is so startling that it, quite literally, _floors them_.

There are usually two variations. One, nicknamed the "flip-take" is very popular in comic strips and animated cartoons. Early American comic strips often used it in the final panel of a gag. Character _A_ says the stupid/shocking line, causing character _B_ to faint by falling over backwards with their legs up in the air. Usually done by only showing the feet up in the air, accompanied by a large thud sound.

The other, also called an "anime-fall", has the fainting character fall over forwards in the final panel of a gag onto his face, his limbs in a twisted mass above him. A device usually limited to humorous anime, though doesn't actually originate from there. In both instances, it includes, and is confused with, Wild Takes.

Frequently, this action is depicted using a single, pronounced frame transition.

Usually, no one is harmed by taking a flying dive face-first into the ground (unless the animator thinks having them pop up with a bruised face would be funny). A less expressive equivalent would be Facepalm; a _more_ expressive one would be a Head Desk.

Only a handful of comedians can _successfully_ pull off a full-fledged Face Fault in live-action performance; notable examples include Jim Carrey, Steve Martin, Dick Van Dyke, and Chevy Chase. Live-action performers are more likely to do The Pratfall instead, which is a similar comedic trick but leaves the character on his rump. The Japanese, however, have mastered the live-action Face Fault as a _art form_, though it also helps that in most live-action performances the actors _don't_ have to _completely_ fall; most Face Faults in this medium have the cast standing on at least _one foot_ while flailing their bodies in either direction.

Closely related to People Fall Off Chairs. Compare Fainting and Loudspeaker Truck, when a passing vehicle makes a very loud noise to indicate awkwardness. Not to be confused with Face Plant, which is when someone hits the ground face-first after tripping or falling. Sub-trope of The Take.

        **Nagisa:** _\[drunk\]_ Tomoya-kun, why are you panicking like that?
        
    -   Also one great scene in 23rd (extra) episode when Tomoya is having an absurd conversation with Nagisa:
        
        **Nagisa:** _\[offering him her bread\]_ Would you like a bite?  
        **Tomoya:** Not really.  
        **Nagisa:** That's a problem.  
        **Tomoya:** You need me to say, "Yes, I want a bite."?  
        **Nagisa:** You want a bite?  
        **Tomoya:** _\[faking\]_ Yeah, I'd _really_ like a bite of it!  
        **Nagisa:** _\[cheerfully\]_ You do? _\[looks away\]_ But I won't let you.  
        _\[Tomoya face faults off the bench\]_

    -   Kyou at one point face faults so hard she _knocks a door down_ in the process.
-   _Crayon Shin-chan_, usually thanks to something stupid Shin has said or done:
    
    **Shin:** You guys fall down a lot when I talk.
    
-   _Delicious Party♡Pretty Cure_: In Episode 15, Takumi face faults to the floor upon overhearing and mistaking that Yui was talking about him when she was actually referring to Kokone's family driver.
-   In episode 18 of the _D.Gray-Man_ anime, the entire science team of the Black order and Lavi does a collective face fault when Allen pulls the giant octopus off his head, to show a smaller one underneath.
-   _Doraemon_ has multiple gags like these in the manga tales. Usually it's caused by Nobita being The Ditz.
    -   _Doraemon: The Record of Nobita : Spaceblazer_ has Ropporu trying to explain the dimension rift concept to Nobita and how hyperspace works in general, by folding a piece of A4. Nobita instead asks if the galaxy were made of paper, wouldn't it be flimsy... cue Ropporu face-faulting.
    -   The remake of _Doraemon: Nobita and the Haunts of Evil_ has the gang doing this when Gian tries giving a Rousing Speech to the gang on "Be proud adventurers like a _true_ man..." only for Shizuka to answer she's a girl. The boys (and Peko, the dog) quickly fall over.
    -   _Doraemon: Nobita's Great Battle of the Mermaid King_ has Doraemon bringing out a bunch of surfboards for battling the main villain, Bulkin. When Nobita assumes it's superpowered gadget-boards, Doraemon only replies they're _ordinary_ surfboards, causing the gang to flip.
    -   _Doraemon: Nobita and the Island of Miracles ~Animal Adventure~_ has Nobisuke (Nobita's dad) telling Nobita and Doraemon his childhood encounter with the mystical golden beetle. As the latter two starts showing interest, Nobisuke later admits he kind of just dreamt it up. Doraemon and Nobita both react with a seated face-fault.
    -   Early in _Doraemon: Nobita and The Space Heroes_ (a Superhero Episode) the gang starts using their superpowers given by Doraemon's gadgets for the first time. Gian has Super-Strength, Suneo's a Gadgeteer Genius who can conjure any weapons at will, Shizuka can fire powerful jets of water from her hands and Nobita... can shoot two strings. Mid-air face fault ensues.
-   _Dragon Ball_ sometimes had scenes such as this.
    
    -   After Master Roshi uses the Kamehameha to put out Fry-Pan Mountain's massive fire, Ox-King awkwardly points out that Roshi _also_ destroyed the entire mountain as well. _(Dragon Ball, episode 8)_
    
    **Roshi:** _(Sheepish)_ Whoopsy! Don't know my own strength! _(Heroes face fault)_
    
    -   The very first audience-wide face fault occurs in the first tournament arc (_Dragon Ball_ episode 21, about halfway through). Just before the main matches begin, the master monk of the temple hosting the tournament (who is a dog) steps up for a few choice words. He takes the mic...
        
        **Monk:** ...WOOF!  
        **Announcer:** Isn't that profound?  
        _WHAM!_
        
    -   Used again during Goku's fight with Nam. Goku spins himself so fast that he becomes a miniature tornado and manages to force Nam to the edge of the ring... before getting dizzy and collapsing right in front of him. In response, Nam nearly face faults _out of the ring_, but he manages to save himself.
    -   At the end of the Tournament saga in _Dragon Ball_ (episode 28), the gang are all watching in astonishment as Goku gulps down plate after plate of food, with the plates eventually piling up. Eventually, Goku stops after eating 57 full course meals while everyone looks on in disbelief. Afterwards, he asks the waiter "Can I have another bowl please?" Cue everyone face faulting. Roshi says Goku has probably had enough to which Goku casually replies "Yeah. You're right. I probably should save some room for dessert!" Cue another face fault by everyone.
    -   Chi Chi entered a tournament in a _Dragon Ball_ arc. She met Goku there, and was pissed at him because he'd forgotten that he'd promised years prior that she'd be his bride. When she reveals this, Goku asks Krillin what a bride is. He, the nearby Yamcha, and Chi Chi all Face Fault.
    -   One of the best face faults in _DBZ_ history is when Trunks tells Goku his parentage... Vegeta is his father, and his mother... Bulma. Goku's reaction was not only faulting — but flat out laughing in sheer disbelief! Meanwhile, far away from this private talk, Piccolo with his acute hearing picks up on the entire conversation, and nearly face faults himself (episode 122).
        
        -   It's also one of the rare examples of this trope being lampshaded:
        
        **Vegeta**: "That guy just pointed his finger and Kakarot fell down!"
        
    -   There were two notable ones during the Afterlife Tournament filler arc. First, a rather easy foe that Goku is fighting suddenly wraps himself in a cocoon, his trainer bragging that he'll eventually come out stronger than before. Unfortunately, he also says the metamorphosis will complete in 1200 years, causing Goku and the referees to face fault (_Dragon Ball Z_ episode 196). Afterwards, Goku wins by default; then, two minor characters, Torbie and Tapikar face off. The latter shows off his blinding speed just before the match, intimidating the former; when the fight begins, Tapikar charges at Torbie, but stops, exhausted, and forfeits. Aside from Tapikar, the only ones who remain standing are West Kai, who states that the ring is biased against short people, and North Kai, who accuses him of being a sore loser. _Everyone else_ in the arena face faults. Including _the audience._ Who face faults in _waves._ (_Dragon Ball Z_ episode 197)
    -   Another one was during the Majin Buu saga (episode 251) when Goten and Trunks first tried to fuse seriously in front of everyone. The first attempt resulted in a very chubby Gotenks. As Gotenks tries to jog in his newly fused body he stops moving for a second... then starts heaving in exhaustion, giving up. _Everyone_ face faults.
-   _Dr. STONE_: Senku causes the entire village to face fault when he ultimately realizes they're going to create another phone after months of collecting materials.
-   There are a lot more of these in _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_ than in the 2003 anime version. Fitting, as it follows the manga's art (and story) much more closely. There are a _lot_ of face faults in the manga. The Australian official release even references it by name.
    
    **Ed:** Is it some weird Xingese culture to face fault at will?!
    
-   Used often in _Full Metal Panic!_, usually as a result of Sōsuke's actions. Two notable ones:
    -   At one point, the invisible mech facefaults.
    -   When Kaname spots Sōsuke following her on the train, his response is a very fake "Funny meeting you here," which causes Kaname to face fault. The noteworthy part is that the camera is focused entirely on Sōsuke. The audience has to infer Kaname's face-fault by the sound effect, and Sōsuke suddenly lowering his gaze.
-   Happens to Mikan in _Gakuen Alice_ with an almost sadistic frequency.
-   In episode five of _Harukanaru Toki no Naka de_ Tenma has this reaction when Akane expresses concern over the possibility of Yorihisa commiting seppuku after she fell into a river because of him; although Tenma then comments that, this being Yorihisa, such outcome _is_ possible.
-   _Hidamari Sketch_:
    -   When the tenants of the apartments are in Miyako's room, trying to come up with reasons why the rent on it is so much cheaper than theirs, Hiro brings up some old nicknames for the apartments: "Chidamari" (bloody) and "Odamari" (be quiet). This latter name is followed by an overhead view of Sae's, Miyako's, and Yuno's legs as they've suddenly lain down in reaction to it.
    -   Yoshinoya-sensei also elicits one from those involved in the Cinderella play. After they'd finished, she burst through the curtains, crying. You might think, as they probably did, that she'd been overcome by the emotion of the moment, but no, she started complaining that the principal wouldn't let her hold a concert for the festival.
-   The first season of _Inazuma Eleven_ has several scenes where one or more characters instantly collapse when they hear something they consider absurd. Though unusually for an anime, they usually fall backwards (the flip-take) rather than on their face (the anime fall). An example is in episode 5, where everybody in the room except Gouenji and Kazemaru has this reaction after Endou reads his grandfather's explanation of the Inazuma Drop, which is total non-sence.
-   _Infinite Stratos_ does this when Ichika is about to do something, only for him to declare that, that's it. Cue everyone in the class face-faulting.
-   _Inuyasha_: Kagome's command of "Osuwari!" ("Sit, boy!") causes Inuyasha to do an automatic Face Fault, though that's more of a mystical means of keeping Inuyasha under control than a reaction to stupidity. Although most of the time, it _is_ because InuYasha has done something extraordinarily stupid. Also, on occasion she has used this command in rapid-fire succession, even going so far in the first movie as to _literally_ drive him into the ground.
-   In _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_, after Jotaro defeats D'Arby at his own poker game, Avdol checks Jotaro's hand, only to find that rather than having a hand that could beat D'Arby's four of a kind with kings, Jotaro had one of the _worst_ hands possible. Avdol and the kid dealer nearly face fault since Jotaro had been bluffing D'Arby for the entirety of the match.
-   _Kaiju Girl Caramelise_ has an example when Rairi is giving her backstory:
    
    _in the past_  
    **Yuu Okada:** I feel like I have the most fun when I'm with you, Rairi.  
    **Rairi:** Huh...? I-if you tell me stuff like that...I'll fall for you, y'know!?  
    **Okada:** That's fine. Go ahead.  
    _in the present_  
    **Kuroe:** Wow...  
    **Rairi:** Well...he already had a girlfriend.  
    _Kuroe face faults out of her chair_
    
-   Yuuta Togashi pulled an epic one in the first episode of _Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!_ that trashes the entire room.
-   In _Lupin III Legend Of The Gold Of Babylon_, upon seeing the Tower of Babel floating in the sky, _The Statue of Liberty_ is so dumbfounded by the sight she just faults while dropping her torch.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_ has one of these in the first episode when Nanoha is trying to persuade her family to let her take care of a "ferret" — cough, cough — that she found injured in the woods. Her father asks what a ferret is, and Nanoha face faults, though at a much lesser extreme than expected from this.
-   _My Hero Academia_: In the Paranormal Liberation War arc, Doctor Garaki experiences many throughout the raid, as his plans are systematically dismantled by the Heroes.
-   _Naruto_: In one filler episode, after spending the whole day trying to get Kakashi to get his mask, he decides to show the trio what's underneath... which is _another_ mask, as Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke fault to the ground.
    
    **Naruto:** ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! WHAT THE HECK KIND OF AN ENDING IS THAT?!
    
-   Ken Akamatsu often uses overly exaggerated face faults that send characters flying around as if standing next to an explosion of some sort.
    -   The page pic is a scene from _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ showing Chisame face faulting to Chachamaru's Accidental Innuendo.
    -   In chapter 108 of _UQ Holder!_, he has Karin perform a truly epic one. She slides several meters _face down on the floor_.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   In the "Koby and Helmeppo's Chronicles of Toil" mini-series, Vice-Admiral Garp gets this reaction from his sailors when he admits that the reason "Axe-hand" Morgan was able to slash him and escape was because he _fell asleep_ during the prison transfer.
    -   A moment of this in a filler arc (the Foxy's Return arc) where Luffy's failure to see through a Paper-Thin Disguise floors everyone in the room. Including the one who was trying to fool him with it.
    -   In Episode 452, Luffy is on a hijacked Marine ship sailing to Marine Headquarters to rescue Ace from execution, and is talking to a member of the Marines. He assures them that he's going to rescue Ace, and they should "wash your potatoes and wait." Most of those on the ship fall down as a result (for those unaware, the phrase "wash your _neck_ and wait" was traditionally spoken to prisoners before their executions).
    -   In the Sabaody Archipelago arc, after Caimie has been kidnapped, Sanji tells Chopper and Brook to wait for Usopp to come and pick them up. By the time Usopp arrives, he sees Chopper and Brook relaxing as if they were on the beach (On the grounds that worrying won't make time go any faster, so they might as well relax). Cue Usopp face-faulting.
    -   In Chapter 823, Igaram is, as usual, overly worried as Vivi is on top of a Marine ship, enjoying the breeze. He nearly craps himself with fear when she jumps off the crow's nest, but face-faults when she nails the landing perfectly.
-   Occurs in the 12th episode of _Ookami Kakushi_ when one girl's grandfather who just put on quite a badass display, asks someone to call an ambulance because he strained his hip.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_ absolutely loves this trope.
    
    -   In early Kanto episodes. When Ash is your standard Idiot Hero when it comes to love, it's either time for a facepalm or one of these.
    -   In an early episode "Haunter vs. Kadabra", Sabrina's father does a Face Fault when Ash concludes aloud that the reason the former knows Sabrina so well is because he's been her photographer all her life.
    
    **Sabrina's father:** _**JUST HOW DENSE CAN A PERSON BE?!**_
    
    -   One episode (The Mandarin Island Miss Match, episode 99) has the Team Rocket trio face fault _out of their balloon while it was in the air_ after they suggested Lorelei to record her lectures on tape and sell them and she _told them the price_ ($18.95, if you're interested). To be fair, Ash, Misty, and Tracey face faulted immediately beforehand.
    -   While Ash is the Idiot Hero, people do this at if it comes to love, he tends to do them _himself_ whenever he gets ignored for something else, especially whenever Professor Oak ignores him in favor of a Pokémon.
    -   Brock does this in the premiere of _The Johto Journeys_ when Ash asks him if he's got any cash in case Johto League registration costs a fee.
    -   Speaking of Brock, his near-constant womanizing has resulted in his allies doing this on more than one occasion.
    -   The _Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl_ episode "Ancient Family Matters!" makes a Running Gag out of characters face-faulting when Byron gets distracted by Team Rocket's exquisite hole-digging skills.
    -   In episode 77 of _Pokémon the Series: XY_ (A Relay in the Sky!), a man named Ornithol offers his expertise on the Pokémon Sky Relay to help Ash when the latter decides to take part. When asked about his previous experience with the event, it turns out Ornithol never participated because he'd never caught three flying Pokémon. Everyone else (save the man's Noctowl) face faults upon hearing that.
-   _Ranma ½_
    -   Face faults are common sight gags in both the manga and the anime. Rumiko Takahashi does it with the characters' hands usually extended, middle and ring (and index?) fingers folded while the pinkie/index and thumb stick out. The hand-sign is basically the familiar "horns", and is used in Japan to deflect evil eye.
    -   The second season of the anime opens every episode with a brief "blurb" describing the premise, that ends with the entire Tendō family face-faulting upon witnessing Ranma's transformation.

-   In _Sakigake!! Otokojuku_, Tazawa attempts to intimidate a thug by speaking entirely in Gratuitous English, causing the whole gang to face fault.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Occasionally seen in the anime; a particular example that comes to mind is the _Sailor Moon S_ episode with Usagi's birthday, where the girls do this twice _in the same scene_: first when Usagi admits that she never told Mamoru about her birthday, and then when it turns out she doesn't know when his is either.
    -   On one occasion the girls were admiring a modern art statue with the Starlights and when Yaten announces its enormous price, Rei faceplants straight onto it, almost knocking it over.
    -   In the episode "Paired With a Monster: Mako, the Ice Skating Queen". A recurring gag is that Sailor Jupiter is always lovesick and always falling for guys who remind her of "the guy who broke \[her\] heart." At the end of the episode, it's been about five minutes since the end of her most recent relationship. Then she turns red ogling a guy who's "nose is just like the guy who broke \[her\] heart". All four of the others hit the dirt.
-   In _Shaman King (2001)_, after driving to Mesa Verdede in search of the Patch Tribe, only to find that it's full of tourists, Yoh and company promptly Face Fault an entire van.
-   _Rurouni Kenshin_: Kenshin politely refuses a lady's offer to stay at her inn. In the manga she says he must be flat broke, while in the anime she calls him a cheapskate, and in both cases he faceplants right away. Then in the anime version another lady appears, and the first tells her to forget about him since he's a cheapskate before he can even stand up, so this time he flip-takes to end on his back!
-   Haruka of _Sakura Trick_ often does this when experiencing a fit of Yuri Fan and/or Yuu Fan madness.
-   _School Rumble_: Everybody, all the damn time.
-   Comes up now and then in _SD Gundam Force_. In the first Clip Show, Shute and Zero pull this when Bakunetsumaru realizes that the "reporters" they've been talking to are Zako Soldiers in a Paper-Thin Disguise..._after_ the Zakos reveal themselves. Then at the very end, Zapper Zaku reveals that his singing janitor routine was just an act, and announces that he's ready to do bad again. Cut to him being surrounded by a small army with their blades pointing at him. Zapper panics and does his routine- pan over to his allies, who have face-faulted.
-   _Sgt. Frog_ is a living magnet of these. Of special note: the Third Movie, which features the new Dark Keroro, whose design practically screams Evil Twin. And what's Keroro's first assumption? It's his long-lost twin brother. His remaining platoonmates nearly flip. Cue the soap-opera parody.
    -   The title sequence for season 6 shows Keroro getting this reaction from an entire Keronian battalion.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie_ has this when the old owl is explaining that he physically traveled all the way to Sonic's residence to tell him something that could have been much more easily communicated by phone.
-   In _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_, episode 10, Kittan does this when Nia, whom he is interrogating under the impression that due to being Lordgenome's daughter she is an enemy, asks what "enemy" means.
-   In _Ultimate Teacher_ Ganbachi and Karima do this when they're charging against each other and get interrupted by Hinako.
-   During moments when he seems Too Dumb to Live, Judai of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ frequently elicits this response from his friends, teachers, strangers, and even inanimate objects like a road sign (see episode 66 for the last one).
-   _YuYu Hakusho_:
    -   In the very first episode, upon learning from Botan that his throwing himself into the path of a moving car to save a kid was a Senseless Sacrifice, making his death, as she put it, "a complete and utter waste", Yusuke face faulted so hard that he fell out of the sky.
    -   In the fourth episode Kuwabara and his gang are pressured to pass their next test and if they don't they will all get kicked out of school. The group talks and explains they need to study to get their grades up. When they ask Kuwabara what he got on his last test he sheepishly responds a Seven. Cue Face Fault.
    -   The Dark Tournament arc features this several times (most memorably when a contestant abruptly leaves the ring in the middle of his power-up to go vomit), but it is usually reserved for the comic relief characters of Koenma and Jorge. The dub hangs a lampshade on this and deconstructs it when Koenma yells at Jorge to get up because "surprise time's over" and Jorge replies that his horn got stuck in the floor.
-   Watanuki Kimihiro of _×××HOLiC_ does this quite often.
-   Played with in an episode of _Zoids: New Century_. At the very beginning of a Humongous Mecha tournament, the judges refer to the Tigers team as the Fuzzy Pandas team (a Running Gag first started by the main character), which causes their _zoids_ to face fault. This freezes their combat system, and thus disqualifies them from the tournament.
-   Elizabeth from _The Seven Deadly Sins_ does this twice when Meliodas lied about why he is wanted by the kingdom.
-   In _Shomin Sample_ episode 3, when stoic super-genius Hakua expresses an interest in Kimito, the first time she'd shown a personal interest in anyone, her personal maid face-faults hard enough to shatter the tiles on the floor.
-   Happens in several episodes of the _Tamagotchi_ animated series. For example, in _GO-GO Tamagotchi!_ episode 3b, Himespetchi does one when she thinks Mametchi has just noticed her, only for her to realize he was looking at Jack the peacock and not her.
-   _Spy X Family_: When Yor suggests to Loid that they actually get married, he Face Plants in shock. They were both running at the time, though, and he quickly recovers.

    Asian Animation 

-   In _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_, the characters frequently fall over whenever they see or hear something dumb.

    Comic Books 

-   _Ultimate Spider-Man_: When Peter said he was Spider-Man, Mary Jane laughed so hard that she fell to the ground in laughter.
-   In a Chilean comic strip called _Condorito_, the punch line would almost inevitably end with the victim of the punch line falling on his/her ass with a loud ¡PLOP!

    Comic Strips 

-   The "flip-take" is mostly associated with Newspaper Comics from the early 20th century. A character says or does something stupid, explains it in the final panel, causing a smart character to faint on the floor with a large thud. Always done by falling on their back with the feet high up in the air. To add effect the reader usually only sees their feet in the air, the rest of the body falls out of frame.
-   Happens a few times in _Thimble Theater_. In one strip, Lubry Kent Oyl is showing his family his rare pet, the whiffle hen Bernice;
    
    **Castor Oyl:** Bernice, a she, eh?  
    **Lubry:** Certainly, a female. In fact, there are no male whiffle hens.  
    **Castor:** You don't mean that, uncle — You don't mean that!  
    **Lubry:** Sure I do — The males are whiffle _roosters!_  
    _\[Oyl family faults\]_
    
-   Characters in _The Katzenjammer Kids_ (or _The Captain and The Kids_) would do this, often after being pranked by the title kids.
-   Occurs after every punchline in the newspaper comic _Jerry on the Job,_.
-   In the Filipino strip _Pugad Baboy_, every time a character makes a pun, the other characters would react by falling to the floor while screaming.
-   Often parodied in _Tom the Dancing Bug_ every time the cartoonist does "Super Fun Pack Comix", which pretty much tackles every single cliches found in daily newspaper comics.
-   Frequently used in the French comic strip _Pif_.
-   _Quick and Flupke_: Also the punchline to a lot of gags. Usually Flupke does something stupid, causing either Quick or Agent 15 to faint down on their backs.

    Fan Works 

-   _Anything for Family_: Erika keels over on her face when Kanade tells her how many of their friends have been kidnapped.
-   _Naru-Hina Chronicles_: Naruto suggests to Hinata they can go eat anywhere, even at some place other than Ichiraku for once. She chooses to go to a teahouse, to which he agrees and he's already on his way to a teahouse. However, he stops walking and sheepishly asks her if she knows where one is, causing Hinata to do this trope.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Twice in the film _Liar Liar_, Fletcher Reede runs into his vindictive boss that he insulted earlier on, and both times pulls off the rare live-action Face Fault as only Jim Carrey can.
-   In a _very_ early incarnation of this, _The Three Stooges_ do one in "Men in Black," reacting to a goofy nurse's absurd definition of a pippin.
    
    **Nurse:** A pippin is an apple with its skin on the outside.  
    _\[Curly facepalm\]_  
    **Moe:** Did you ever see an apple with its skin on the _inside?_  
    **Nurse:** Oh, sure I did!  
    **Larry:** You did? Where?  
    **Nurse:** In homemade apple pie.  
    _\[the Stooges faint\]_
    
-   Likely inspired by the the Three Stooges, the Philippines had this as a staplemark in their comedy films during the '80s and '90s, mostly pioneered by (who some can say is the Filipino equivalent of the Stooges) comedy trio _Tito, Vic & Joey_.
-   Psyche-outs in _BASEketball_ often had this effect on their victims.
-   In _Dirty Dancing_, Johnny face faults after Baby teases him while they're dancing to "Love is Strange"
-   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_, this happens twice during the trial of Miles Edgeworth.

    Literature 

-   At the beginning of the _Captain Underpants_ Spin-Off _Super Diaper Baby 2: The Invasion of the Potty Snatchers_, Mr. Krupp does this when George and Harold ask him what else is there they could write about besides Toilet Humor.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Kamen Rider Den-O_, essentially a live-action Anime, absolutely adores the face fault, but it happened best in episode 15. When Airi learns that her brother is being held hostage, she's totally nonchalant until pressed, at which point she declares her intent to make him some "special hostage snacks", eliciting a Face Fault out of the coffee shop's entire patronage.
-   Happens at least once on _Family Feud_. One question from Fast Money: "Name something people take with them to the bathroom besides soap and a towel." Her answer? A duck. The number of people who agreed with her? 11. Dawson drops face-first onto the floor upon seeing the number.
    -   In another episode, the host asks "Name an animal whose legs are featured on a restaurant menu." No one gives a response, and the host promptly face-faults onto the podium before moving onto the next question.
-   One of the bloopers in _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_ consists of Brad Sherwood starting off a Hoedown with: "I was feeling frisky; I went for a drive./I took all my handguns and shot myself alive...I..." and Brad then slowly face faulted at his own failure to make sense.
-   In _Kamen Rider Wizard_ the donut shop manager and his assistant do this whenever they fail to coax Haruto, their frequent customer, into trying out any kind of donut they make other than "plain sugar".

    Video Games 

-   Anything that startles ANYONE in _Ace Attorney_ becomes this. Ryunosuke Naruhodo from _The Great Ace Attorney_ probably goes the furthest with this as his reaction to having his argument cut down is to _throw himself against the back wall_ of the defense bench then bounce off into a melodramatic faceplant on the desk.
-   In _Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures,_ Edd explains the Tower of Eddy maneuver. After a beat, Ed exclaims, "HUH?!" causing Eddy to face fault.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   In _Majora's Mask_, Link falls flat on his face when a monkey fails to make an obvious connection. Link sneaks into the Deku Palace to talk to the captured monkey, and discover what can be done about the terrible situation of the area. The monkey refuses to speak to Link's Deku form, so Link must talk to him in human form. Midway through the conversation, the monkey needs to teach Link some Magic Music, but the instrument needs to be louder than Link's tiny ocarina. Link must transform into his Deku form, which has a large set of pipes. The monkey enthusiastically says that those will work perfectly before asking Deku Link who he happens to be, despite the fact Link just transformed right in front of him, causing a fault.
    -   _Spirit Tracks_: After the Sand Temple, a cutscene ensues of Zelda asking how to find Malladus. A mere response of "I don't know" from Anjean causes Zelda to crash to the ground, which is pretty weird considering she's still a ghost at that point.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Peach causes _everyone_ (everyone being Mario, Luigi, Wario, Yoshi, and DK) to do this during the intro to _Mario Party 2_ when after everyone starts arguing on who to rename Mario Land after, Peach's idea of a name they can all agree on is _Peach Land_. It also happens to a Koopa Troopa who tries to tell Mario and his friends about Bowser's invasion and then face vaulting when he gets ignored.

    -   Lots of face faulting in _Mario & Luigi_ too, especially in _Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga_.
        -   Done a lot in _Mario & Luigi: Dream Team_, such as one scene where the Mario Bros. and Prince Dreambert use it repeatedly as a Lame Pun Reaction. And Dreambert does this in the ending and then doesn't get up for about half the cut scene.
        -   Both the Mario Bros. and Paper Mario end up doing this in _Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam_ when after going all over Gloomy Woods looking for berries to feed Wiggler to get him out of their way, he then asks for dessert. You can just hear the Bros thinking "Oh, you have GOT to be joking...".
    -   Mario has one in _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ when Professor Frankly doesn't recognize him. He also elicits a second one when he can't figure out what the map means. His final phrase before the face fault was a loud shout of 'I DON'T KNOW'.
    -   It happens in Chapter 4 of _Super Paper Mario_, as well, when Squirps reveals that he doesn't remember how to get to the next Pure Heart. And another one early on, after Bestovius figures out the Mario is the HERO! ...impersonator.
    -   In _Paper Mario: The Origami King_, Mario, Olivia, and Professor Toad have to rotate four ancient statues to solve a puzzle. Each time, the tremors cause them to either fall over or nearly fall. Once they rotate the final statue, however, Olivia remembers that she floats everywhere and didn't need to fall over, which causes Mario and Professor Toad to face fault.
    -   _WarioWare_ series:
        -   _WarioWare: Twisted!_: Fail one of the microgames that Mona hosts, and this is how Sal Out reacts. In the middle of her performance.

    -   In _Pokémon Let's Go_, after beating Lance, he states that you have one more challenger to face. Professor Oak shows up at that moment and Lance hypes him up as the Champion, much to the shock of your in-game character... only to immediately say he's kidding seconds later, with Oak doing a Face Fault.
    -   In the Rescue Team games and the Rescue Team DX remake in _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon_, after you clear Mt Steel, you can choose to say your team doesn't need assistance and then "Two is plenty". Your partner asks if you have a special ability, in which you can choose between your body stretching and flying. Either way, your partner asks you to show your ability, but the options both consist of you saying you can't, resulting in either your partner and the two Magnemite face faulting in the originals or your partner face faulting in the DX remake.
    -   Later, after you clear Great Canyon, your partner asks where the world’s balance is. You can choose to escalate the wackiness by claiming that it’s in space, and if you say that your partner will know when they find it, your partner asks how, and choose the option of flying, your partner is quick to ask Pelipper to fly you and your partner to space, to which Pelipper declines and flies off. When you say that it’s impossible, your partner face faults.
    -   In the DX remake's Japanese exclusive trailer showcasing the Whiscash Pond, Whiscash tells Mudkip and Skitty a fictional story about the Kangaskan statue, when Kangaskan shows up to scold Whiscash for making stuff up. When Whiscash finally confesses that the Kangaskan statue story was false, Mudkip and Skitty face fault.
