_"You know, you have a way of saying 'thank you' that makes it sound more like 'drop dead'."_

Though it sounds understated, it can mark the beginning of a change in a character or relationship.

Alice has always disliked Bob, people in general or is just very proud. But to Alice's dismay, she gets helped out by Bob in a moment when she really needs it. Glumly, Alice accepts and just when Bob is leaving Alice goes:

"Oh, and Bob..." Then a pause to indicate Alice biting the bullet. "Thank you."

This thanks, however grudging, is sincere; insincere ones fall under Embarrassing Rescue. It can often be a Heartwarming Moment.

Compare Think Nothing of It and Does Not Know How to Say "Thanks". If Bob has the same attitude as Alice, he is prone to express it, either because he dislikes the connection it formed, or because he did not act for Alice personally. Sometimes another character may apply a Prompting Nudge to get Alice to express her gratitude.

Contrast Ungrateful Bastard if they're not thankful at all. Also contrast Snarking Thanks if the gratitude is sarcastic.

    Anime and Manga 

-   In _AKB49 – Renai Kinshi Jourei_, Okabe, who was initially introduced as a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing trying to sabotage the protagonist Minoru, thanked Minoru grudgingly after he saved her from humiliating herself publicly in one occasion.
-   Uryu Ishida and Ichigo Kurosaki from _Bleach_ tend to have this kind of interaction often, though they even more frequently hang lampshades on each other's Ungrateful Bastard moments.
-   _Moriarty the Patriot_: Played With: When Louis finally thanks Sherlock Holmes for saving his brother's life, after loathing him for the entire series to that point, he is genuine and sincere with no hesitation at all, but Sherlock wasn't expecting such a heartfelt expression of gratitude from him.
-   _Oreimo_: After taking a literal _beating_ from their father covering for his little sister's hobby, Kousaka Kyosuke goes about his next day like any other. This trope was major character development for Kirino, including the first and so far only time she addresses him as brother and led to Kyosuke proclaiming "My little sister can't be this cute."
-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_: At the end of the Fireworks Festival arc, Nino doesn't quite say the words to Fuutarou, but her "Good. Job. Back. There." after he does his best to reunite her and her sisters definitely carries the intent of this trope.
-   Seto Kaiba from _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, who wasn't happy about losing his World Champion's title to a virtually unknown kid, grudgingly thanks Yugi for saving his little brother Mokuba at the end of the Duelist Kingdom arc. He thanks him _only_ for Mokuba; admitting he had to be saved himself as well would have been a too big blow to his ego.
-   After Zatch saves Kiyo a few times in early _Zatch Bell!_ episodes, Kiyo tries his best to thank him but can't get the words out, settling for "I owe you". This is played more dramatically in the manga.

    Comic Books 

-   King Faraday delivers one (via telegram) to Batman in _Batman_ #314 after Batman saved his life against Two-Face. Batman notes that a 'thank you' from someone like Faraday is glowing praise.
-   Doctor Doom, of all people, in _Doctor Strange and Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment_, thanks Strange for protecting his mother's soul from the wrath of Mephisto. It's pretty much the only hint of gratitude Strange gets during that misadventure, though.
-   In _The Powerpuff Girls_ story "Everything Must Go" (DC run, issue #48), the Amoeba Boys have bought an electromagnet from Mojo Jojo's yard sale, and without any rational thought uses it to draw the moon towards Earth (claiming they were using it to hail a taxi). Mojo averts disaster by reversing the magnet's force and thinks the girls owe him a "thank you." The girls lock him in jail for creating the thing in the first place.
-   In _Transmetropolitan_, after Spider Jerusalem gets knocked out during a severe storm, his assistant Yelena Rossini proceeds to write a critical story in his name to make a deadline. Later, upon admitting the fact, she cringes waiting for his typical reaction (dirty words and violence), but instead he kisses her forehead and quietly replies, "Thank you."

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Rango_ fanfic _Old West_, the second meeting between Rattlesnake Jake and Grace Glossy happens with her farm being attacked by rustlers and him showing up to deal with them. While the notorious outlaw represents everything she resists in the mind of the devoted single mother who respects the law, she reluctantly thanks Jake afterwards for preventing the rustlers from causing more damage to her home and livestock.

    Films — Animated 

-   The turning point in the Disney version of _Beauty and the Beast_, is when Belle is tending to Beast's wounds after he saved her from a pack of ravenous wolves. As Beast tries to shift the blame for getting mauled to her running away, she responds that it was him furiously yelling at her that she tried to escape the castle. As she's tending his wounds, Belle blandly thanks him for saving her life, and Beast gives her a flat "you're welcome." After that experience, Beast's demeanor changes from that of an angry Spoiled Brat to bashful Prince Charming.
-   Shira gives one to Diego in _Ice Age: Continental Drift_, after he brings her some water.
    
    **Diego**: You know, you have a way of saying "thank you" that makes it sound more like "drop dead".  
    **Shira**: It's a gift.
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The Birds_ Lydia, who is always jealous of her son's love interests, thanks Melanie in this way for taking care of her after a nervous breakdown.
-   Corrupt Corporate Executive Zorg in _The Fifth Element_ sort-of gives one of these to Priest Vito Cornelius after Cornelius saves him from choking on a maraschino cherry. "You saved my life. And in return I'll spare yours," and lets Cornelius leave... escorted out by his bodyguards.
-   In _Hellboy (2004)_ Tom Manning and Hellboy can barely stand each other with the former being very bossy and somewhat bigoted towards inhumans and the latter being reckless and disobedient, but after defeating Kroenen together, the two somberly thank each other.
-   Played both ways in _Logan_. Wolverine is only reluctantly convinced to take Laura on a road trip to safety. But halfway through the movie, Wolverine thanks her for taking him to a doctor after he passed out. Laura replies, "De nada." ("You're welcome.") This causes a WTF reaction in Wolverine who up to now _had no idea that she could speak._ Laura responds with a Foreign-Language Tirade that those who speak Spanish will understand is a What the Hell, Hero? to Wolverine for his own attitude.
-   In _Predator_ After the character Mac saves Dillon from a scorpion crawling on his back by pinning it on his knife, Dillon pauses and resentfully says "Thanks".

    Literature  

-   _Artemis Fowl_ to Holly at the end of book two.
-   In Dorothy Gilman's _The Clairvoyant Countess_, Joe Painter finally manages to say "thanks" at the end of their first meeting, after Madame Karitska has stopped him from shoplifting and being caught.
-   _The Dresden Files_: In _Turn Coat_, Morgan starts to give one of these to Harry. He cuts Morgan off, stating that neither of them wants to hear him say that, for which Morgan is more than agreeable with. Earlier, Morgan also gives a grudging "You're welcome" in _Dead Beat_, after Harry happily thanks him for his first Warden paycheck.
-   In the Tom Clancy novel _Patriot Games_, ULA terrorist Sean Grady is temporarily transferred to a cell with ordinary criminals in it. When the cops check on him, he's been beaten and is being raped. The officer pulls the other prisoner off of Grady and gets him to the infirmary, at which point Sean says "Thanks." This is notable in that it's literally the _only_ unnecessary word that Sean says in the presence of the police between the time he's arrested and the time he's broken out (At which point he shoots and nearly kills the officer who saved him).
-   In Isaac Asimov's _The Robots of Dawn_, Elijah Baley receives one of these from the Chairman of Aurora, after the Chairman was prompted. The Chairman rarely thanks _anyone_; thanking an Earthman was... impressive.
-   Inspector Cramer does this to Nero Wolfe in _The Silent Speaker_. Sort of. He buys Wolfe an orchid after Wolfe saves his job.
-   In the first book of _The Thrawn Trilogy_, Mara Jade takes Luke Skywalker prisoner while walking through Myrkr and then has to protect him from the Force-hunting predators native to the planet. She _hates_ him and is also Force-sensitive and reads as prey to the vornskrs, so she tries taking stims to go without sleep. When a vornskr does finally get past her defenses and goes for her, Luke takes back his lightsaber and saves her with considerable difficulty. She has him drop the lightsaber and back off before _very_ grudgingly thanking him and saying that now they're even for when she did not kill him immediately after finding him. But she still hates him.
-   One of the invading rogues on _Warrior Cats_ gives this to the Clan cats and Tribe cats when they saved them from an eagle.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Buffy to Spike at the end of "Intervention". She's understandably squicked out by his possession of a sex doll in her likeness, but after tromping all over his attempt to justify it, she follows up with:
    
    _"That ... thing, it ... it wasn't even real. What you did, for me, and Dawn ... that was real. I won't forget it."_
    
-   In _Friends_, the episode after Ross and Rachel break up (that is, the first time they broke up), Ross helps the others out after they get stuck on the road with no gas, and gets a rather reluctant 'thank you' from Rachel before they go.
-   In the _Jessie_ episode "We Are So Grounded", Jessie gives Emma a teeth-clenched "thank you" for curing her of a poisonous bite.
    
    **Emma:** Where's my thank you for sporking you back to health?  
    **Jessie:** THANK YOU!!! I HOPE I GET TO DO THE SAME TO YOU SOME DAY!!!
    
-   This happens in _Misfits_ when Nathan gets rescued from a totally ridiculous situation by Kelly. He doesn't actually utter the words "thank you", but he mumbles and gestures awkwardly until Kelly asks if he's trying to thank her, and he admits: "I guess I am". Cue awkward silence rife with UST.
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
    -   In the episode "Bread and Circuses", Bones gives Spock a Grudging "Thank You" and receives a Think Nothing of It in return.
        
        **McCoy:** Spock, er, I know we've, er, had our disagreements. Er, maybe they're jokes, I don't know. As Jim says, we're not often sure ourselves sometimes. But, er... what I'm trying to say is...  
        **Spock:** Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be brief?  
        **McCoy:** What I'm trying to say is, you saved my life in the arena.  
        **Spock:** Yes, that's quite true.  
        **McCoy:** _(indignantly)_ I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin!  
        **Spock:** Oh, yes, you humans have that emotional need to express gratitude. "You're welcome", I believe is the correct response.
        
    -   There's another one in "Let This Be Your Last Battlefield". One of the aliens of the week is set up as someone who's hotheaded and difficult but ultimately at least somewhat sympathetic. Viewers get a hint of that second half coming when in his first exchange with Kirk and McCoy, after reacting very angrily to their (perfectly accurate) accusation that he had stolen a Federation ship, the alien visibly pulled himself together enough to thank them quite sincerely for rescuing him.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_: In "Soldiers of the Empire", the Klingon general Martok gives one to Dr Bashir for patching him up. Bashir then roasts Martok for getting blood on the carpet. Martok realises he's being trolled and can't help smiling.
-   A subversion occurs _That '70s Show_ when Red "thanks" his son Eric for staying at home to help support the family instead of going to college after Red had a heart attack and couldn't work for a while. He expresses it by ordering Eric to go out and mow the lawn, awkwardly adding that the "lawn...thanks you for staying home." Red legitimately appreciates Eric's helping to pay the bills, but he's just extremely uncomfortable expressing his emotions except for when he's angry.

    Video Games 

-   In the end of _Bug Fables_, during the final ceremony, when Team Snakemouth talks to Mothiva and thanks her for helping them in the Giant's Lair, she accepts the gratitude in her usual way, and then thanks them back, but the variety of faces she makes before thanking clearly indicates she does that _really_ begrudgingly.
-   _FTL: Faster Than Light_: In the Abandoned Sector, you may encounter the Slug ship begging to be saved from Lanius consuming them. Should you save them, and, provided they didn't bail while you were fighting, they may, well...
-   In _Hyperdimension Neptunia_, at the conclusion of the Lastation Tech Expo story arc, Neptune faces off against a giant Killer Robot out to destroy her. When she defeats it, CPU Black Heart arrives on the scene, telling her things wouldn't have come to this if she (Black Heart) hadn't been so negligent, while also having another of her tsundere moments when she actually goes to thank Neptune for her help.
-   _Kingdom Hearts II_:
    -   Seifer when he gives his trophy to Sora after the latter saved his life. He follows it up by saying he'll win it back.
    -   Auron. Sora even asks him to be grateful, to which he answers "thanks for meddling".
-   _Knights of the Old Republic_: You can get Bastila to apologize for her earlier rudeness, but according to the text it sounds like 'pulling teeth'.
-   In _The Last of Us_, Joel scolds Ellie for breaking the normal plan of regrouping despite the fact she saved him from a Hunter that was drowning him, making it necessary in the first place. Later when he finds her a rifle to help him shoot some Hunters outside before going off he says "And for the record, it was either him or me." to which Ellie responds "You're welcome." after he jumps down outside of hearing distance.
-   Strangely enough, an _inversion_ shows up in _Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X_. After the intro stage where Zero saves X, Zero starts to walk away, but X stops him to say thanks. Zero _ignores him_, apparently uncomfortable with the implication, and literally jets off.
-   In _Overwatch_, one of the commands the player can input is having their character say "Thanks." Reaper's sounds like he'd really rather not admit he needed the help.
-   _Resident Evil 5_: in the "Mercenaries" mode, Wesker's most common response to someone helping him is "I _suppose_ I should thank you," said in the most disdainful way possible. Although in "The Mercenaries 3D", he says "Thanks for the help" in a slightly more sincere way.
-   _Star Fox 64_ has this in a few of Falco's comments, such as "I guess I should be thankful."
-   _Super Robot Wars: Original Generation Gaiden_ had this after Axel had saved Lamia, even though he was formerly an adversary (but got a Heel–Face Turn). And then the next time they meet, they help out each other and just before Axel can leave, Lamia stops him:
    
    **Lamia:** Before you leave, can I say something, Captain?  
    **Axel:** Sure. Go ahead.  
    **Lamia:** ... Thank you.
    
-   _Tales of Hearts_. Hisui's been at odds with Shing the entire game, owing to a solid string of misunderstandings involving Shing and his sister Kohak. When Shing pulls a dangerous Big Damn Heroes and saves Kohak atop a rumbling mountain, Hisui berates him, but calls him "Shing you idiot!" in the process. When Shing points this out, Hisui cracks: "S-so what about it? ..but I guess it's true that you did save Kohak. I'll say it once: Tha, thanks."
