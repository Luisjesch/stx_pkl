It's just a banana.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"You women be careful when you're standing in front of that Häagen-Dazs, because God damn it,_ we're watching _— and God damn it, we're_ thinking_."_

When a character eats something really slowly and suggestively, as a phallic or a yonic metaphor, or licks it or moves it in and out of their mouth in the same way. Bonus points if whatever they're eating drips on their lips, chin, and/or chest.

**Common items are:**

-   Bananas
-   Sausages or hot dogs
-   Long, thin sweets or pastries (i.e. chocolate fingers, éclairs, or candy bars)
-   Frozen desserts (especially popsicles and vanilla ice cream)
-   Lollipops, which are part of the reason Catholic School Girls Rule
-   Peaches
-   Strawberries
-   Cherries: not just popping them, but tying the stems with one's tongue to show _considerable_... dexterity
-   Oysters
-   Personal-sized pudding cups (particularly when eaten without a spoon)
-   Drinking anything through a straw
-   Anything covered in or stuffed with whipped cream, honey, jam, mayonnaise, or melted cheese. Other thick, sticky foods or sauces can easily substitute. Extra points if it ends up all over his or her face.
-   Chocolate in general <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   And of course, any food or drink that can easily be spilled on a shirt

Specific type of Visual Innuendo; some carefully crafted situations may end up being the visual equivalent of Innocent Innuendo. A common subversion is biting down _hard_ at the end. Contrast with Food Porn where the food itself is the object of desire. Not to be confused with what happens when the turn-on is what happens afterward. And especially not to be confused with vorarephilia.

See also: Body Sushi and Orgasmically Delicious. Similar to Food and Body Comparison, wherein it's rare for food representing the body to actually be shown being consumed on screen.

    Advertising 

-   Basically every chocolate commercial has a woman orgasming in it.
-   The "girrrrrrthy" commercials that Ball Park Franks ran a while back.
-   Just about every commercial there has ever been for Cadbury's Flake, a stick-shaped chocolate bar, has shown a woman slowly peeling back the wrapper, biting off a chunk, closing her eyes and going into blissful raptures. They weren't allowed to be broadcast before the watershed. Bill Bailey parodies this in a stage show, involving the Flake jingle and some footage of animals copulating.
-   Parodied in the Carl's Jr. commercial where a gorgeous girl in a bathing suit is shown soaping a car and herself while sensuously eating a giant hamburger. The ad was pulled after protests from Moral Guardians. Carl's Jr. later tried again with another beautiful girl, this time eating a chicken cranberry salad in bed and in her bath.
-   A Diet Pepper Cherry commercial shows Fergie (of the Black Eyed Peas, not the British royal family) tying a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue. The kicker here is that Fergie had just drank a can of the soda, implying that it has so much cherry flavor it... er... well, has cherry stems, apparently.
-   _Häagen-Dazs_ had adverts which featured women (and men) having an orgasm while eating their ice cream.
-   This Hardees commercial.
-   Eliza Dushku's Hulu commercial. Enjoy.
-   This Jerry's Subs & Pizza commercial has a sexy blonde suggestively eating a sub.
-   There was a doozy of a Life Savers commercial in the late 60s-early 70s. A beautiful girl in a low-cut Southern Belle dress showed us her basket full of fruit, talking about how authentic the flavors in Life Savers candy are to the real thing. And as she held up each piece of fruit, a hole appeared in it. Including the cherry.
-   _All_ Magnum ice cream ads are this to varying degrees. They even have actors describing ice cream as if it was sex with the cream dripping off their lips...
-   The _Long Long Man_ series of commercials for Sakeru Gummy candy take this trope to its (il)logical conclusion, as a couple's marriage comes under threat from a mysterious, handsome stranger with an affinity for all things... _long_.
-   An old commercial praised the ability of a girl who could unwrap a Starburst with her tongue. Then she met a guy who could not only unwrap a candy, but fold the wrapper into an origami crane.
-   Tums has a series of ads where food literally fights the would-be eater. It takes on a whole new meaning when the food is a mustard-slathered corn dog. His date covering her stuffed toy's eyes confirm the commercial's makers knew exactly what this looked like!
-   Several ads for York peppermint patties consist entirely of a hot girl nibbling her way through one; the camera jumps around her face while she makes suggestive expressions. One wonders exactly what "sensation" their tagline refers to.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Air Gear_ makes good use of this through a sweaty Ton-Chan and a popsicle. This is all after screaming in fear of rape.
-   _Akikan!!_ plays the "drinking from a can" version for all it's worth.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: Suzu's highest sexual fantasy involves combining her love for Matsuri with her Sweet Tooth. She gets to play it out in a dream where she covers the Matsuri with condensed milk that she licks off. By the end of it, Suzu looks as if she's performing cunnilingus.
-   Played straight in _Azumanga Daioh_ with Sakaki and a popsicle.
-   _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_: In episode 3 of the anime adaptation, whilst fleeing from Miharu's throwing forks and holding a plate with two bites of crepe on it, Yoshii runs into Kubo. The crepes end up all over Kubo's face, and Yoshii's face ends up in his crotch. Kubo gets up and says, "Yoshii... you've dirtied my face," before licking up some of the cream.
-   _Bleach_ has Orihime eating a hot dog rather... oddly during the X-Cution arc. In the Thousand Years Blood one, she's seen munching on a kinda phallic-looking potato.
    -   Rangiku is caught very, _very_ enthusiastically licking a popsicle during the Beach Episode.
-   Kanade and Yukino from _Candy☆Boy_ do this using cake.
-   _Chocotto Sister_ has a scene wherein Choco eats a chocolate-coated banana, completely oblivious to the effect it has on Kakeru.
-   Kyou from _CLANNAD_ when she was slowly sucking a lollipop.
-   _Dead Leaves_ kicks off with Pandy sucking furiously on a hot dog... for no apparent reason.
-   _Death Note_:
    -   L does this constantly. He licks donuts, spoons, and his own fingers; he goes through strawberries and a banana; and once he ties a cherry stem with his tongue. The cast (well, apart from Light) has more important things to do than notice any of this.
    -   Misa does this. Intentionally played, as well, since she was starring in a lipstick commercial that involved her biting the skin off a banana.
    -   Mello does this when he eats chocolate bars.
-   Akari in _Domina no Do!_ does it with a sausage.
-   The _Eiken_ anime did this in the second episode. One of the events in the school competition was to swallow a chocolate-covered banana, and the announcer noted that the Eiken Club member in the event obviously had experience doing this sort of thing... Not to mention the club president is rarely not seen eating food like bananas and sausages in very suggestible ways.
-   Anemone of _Eureka Seven_ pulls this with strawberry jam. Which may or may not actually be blood.
-   The opening sequence (pictured) of _Excel♡Saga_ has Hyatt eating a banana _very_ suggestively.
-   _FLCL_:
    -   Episode 4 gives us Haruko and Naota's father eating _eggs_ rather suggestively.
    -   In Episode 5, while Naota is talking with his friends about how he saved the town in the previous episode, Ninamori can be seen looking unimpressed as she eats a popsicle in a suggestive manner. Takes a quick dip towards horrific when she stops sucking it and... _chomp!_
-   In the manga _Futari Ecchi_, this is how the just-married Yura is taught oral sex by her Good Bad Girl sister Rika, who uses a chocolate-covered banana.
-   Miharu in the _Girls Bravo_ anime did this, not to _one_ banana, but to a fruit vendor's _entire stock_ in quick succession, while he was telling a story about the experiences that inspired him to sell bananas. To multiple _highly suggestive_ camera angles!
-   This is featured in episode 6 of _Gourmet Girl Graffiti_ when Ryou and Kirin eats ice cream popsicles in a hot, steamy bathtub.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_:
    -   Nishizawa's consumption of a coated strawberry was gag-censored for being too suggestive.
    -   She's done this on at least one occasion with a culpable popsicle.
-   _Hell Girl_:
    -   _Hell Girl: Three Vessels_: In the first episode, Ai Enma licks a ''moist'' cherry in front of Hone Onna. She also places a cherry in her mouth and pushes it out with her tongue during the opening credits of the first season.
    -   The way she eats wieners is also pretty impressive. One of those scenes is even in slow motion and with lots of FX.
-   Shion Sonozaki from _Higurashi: When They Cry_ seems to get a little _too_ much enjoyment from eating a popsicle while plotting her deceit and subsequent murder of the village chief and Keiichi.
-   Discussed in chapter 37 of _Horimiya_ by the girls as they talk about the different ways that messy eating would look attractive on a dude (except for Sakura, who is baffled by the concept). They do mention that most of the boys they know (and crush on) eat politely, much to their dismay...except Miyamura, who eats quite sloppily with ice cream and licks it lewdly without a second thought. We get a more direct version of this when he eats the orange peel off of Hori's finger, and the camera shows how intimate that would look.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_: The way he licks cherries really suggests something.
-   _Junsui Adolescence_ has one instance of this. It involves Nanao licking cake from Matsumoto's finger.
-   In episode 6 of _Kanokon_, Nozomu eats a Candied Apple in an indecent fashion, complete with hentai-style drool. Chizuru does not take kindly to being upstaged, however, and it soon turns into an actual Erotic Eating Competition, with many types of carnival food being drafted for the festivities.
-   Kanna from _Koe de Oshigoto!_ is encouraged to try this with various foods, including a banana, to improve her technique (she's an eroge seiyuu, who are expected to provide their own sound effects, among other things). This fails completely and is shown as a throwaway gag, rather than used for fan service. The finger sucking on the other hand goes way beyond Does This Remind You of Anything? territory.
-   Subverted in _Kyo no Asuka Show_. Asuka wants to buy a popsicle, but forgot her wallet. The vendor offers her one free if she can eat it in three minutes. A moment for a bystander to imagine this passes, only for Asuka to decline, recognizing where that would lead. She was tempted to anyway, but her good judgement kicked in and, besides, she much prefers to _chomp_ into popsicles. The vendor then gives her one, no strings attached.
-   _Loveless_'s Kio and his lollipop fixation. Lampshaded. At one point he offers to, er, demonstrate for Soubi. Who is also a guy.

-   Kyouko Okita, the lovely and busty housewife from _Okusan_ in chapter 12 tries to eat a very spicy and hot bowl of soba. The combination of her huge breasts (preventing her from bringing the bowl close to her mouth properly and causing soup to slobber all over her cleavage), the spicyness and the hotness of the food itself (prompting her to sweat pant and moan while eating) and the fact she was going braless (making her shirt cling to her breasts while being transparent and sticky because of the soup) turn her attempt into an unwilling erotic show.
-   Judar from _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_ is formally introduced sitting in a tree eating peaches while the juice dribbles all over his face and bare chest.
-   _Majikoi! Love Me Seriously!_ has the mushroom-shaped lollipops in episode 6, which _actually represents what they look like_. Momoyo evens lectures the other heroines on how to "eat" the lollipop, while lots of guys watch them as if they could actually feel it themselves. Then she tells them to take a bite off. All the guys immediately collapse in pain. A little later, Fushikawa tries to pull off the exact same thing. She succeeds just as spectacularly.
-   _Manabi Straight!_ also uses ice cream... this time it's Mutsuki with a popsicle.
-   _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ has a Les Yay example in the OVA when Saikawa offers Kanna some homemade Valentines Day chocolate, resulting in Kanna sucking on Saikawa's fingers. Given Saikawa's _massive_ crush on Kanna, she suffers a Cuteness Overload.
-   Lesbian example from _Mnemosyne_: A woman orders a drink at a bar, but instead of sipping it normally, she dips two fingers into it and then licks the liquid off them.
-   _Monster Musume_ has Papi eating Kimihito's popsicle. Since she dropped her icecream cone, she insists that _he_ should hold it with obvious results. Onlookers assumes he's being a perv who's doing it on purpose.
-   _Noir_ had Kirika doing the Les Yay version with ice cream at one point.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_: The sensual yet vicious manner with which Akio devours a flower in one of the later episodes tells you pretty much everything you need to know about his relationship to women and sex.
-   The final _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_ ED has Nozomu on a night on the town with his fellow teachers and shows Hot Teacher Chie eating a strawberry. There's also a manga chapter where Nozomu is eating a large sushi roll. Nami notices Yaoi Fangirl and doujin creator Harumi smirking and asks why. Harumi says that she doesn't plan to use it for future reference.
-   _Seitokai Yakuindomo_ does this on several occasions. It's never actually sexualized though, but rather used as yet another case of the series' signature Vulgar Humor.
-   _Shin Koihime†Musou_ has a gratuitous scene with what happens to be a primitive form of glowstick in episode four.
-   While it doesn't actually show up in _Steins;Gate_, it gets referenced.
    
    **Makise:** I'm going to eat this banana.
    
    **Hashida:** Can you say that again...but sort of whisper it?
    
-   The _To Love Ru_ manga has a disproportionate number of images of Mikan eating popsicles or licking ice cream cones, sometime near her brother's crotch. In the sequel _To Love-Ru Darkness_ the erotic part is more blatant.
-   The boys of _The Wallflower_ all get popsicles at one point.
-   In a chapter of _You're Under Arrest!_, Ken Nakajima is watching _very interestedly_ what is implied is an AV, but the only scene we can see before he is interrupted and had to hide the "evidence" is a close-up of a cute girl licking an vanilla ice cream cone.
-   _07-Ghost_: Those candy things Castor gives Teito and Razette in episode 4.

    Comic Books 

-   Watch Green Lantern Corps member Arisia demonstrate Yum Yum to Po-Po while waiting for Hal Jordan.<small>◊</small>

    Comic Strips 

-   This trope has been known to occur in the bonus story sections of _Dykes to Watch Out For_ collections, which could devote more space to such things than the regular instalments. For instance in _Hot, Throbbing Dykes To Watch Out For_ Sydney prepares a tiramisù to entice Mo on one of their early dates (once Mo overcomes her misgivings against dairy, sugar and chocolate, things take off quite satisfyingly), and in _Post-Dykes To Watch Out For_ Clarice and Toni can be seen cavorting in bed with vanilla ice cream and maple syrup.
-   _Liberty Meadows_: Brandy can tie a cherry stalk in a knot with her tongue. This revelation renders Frank incapable of coherent speech.

    Fan Works 

-   The _My Hero Academia_ fanfic _Flashback (MHA)_ has Midnight deliberately attempt this with a hotdog during a friendly Double Entendre battle against All Might during a meeting. Unfortunately, the hotdog was slathered in Blazing Inferno Hellfire Sauce, so it fails and leaves her sulking with a carton of milk for the rest of the meeting.
-   This _Gargoyles_ fan art shows Angela's first experience with ice cream.

-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS_ fanfic _Ransomware: Give Me Back My Heart_: Ryoken invoked this trope on Yusaku by eating the hot dogs he bought from Yusaku in an...interesting manner. Yusaku _definitely_ got the gist of the action.
    
    "..." Yusaku swallowed while Ryoken continued to eat in a manner most people wouldn't, _but he wasn't like most people, now was he?_ A pink tongue swirled around the piece of meat, licking up the sauce that happened to smear across the sides of pale lips. Yusaku couldn't stop swallowing _even though he wasn't the one eating_. Smoldering sapphire scorched entranced emerald behind a curtain of snow white lashes.  
    Chew, swallow, chew, swallow, chew, swallow...neither noticed the actions taking place until the morsel was at last gone. "Thanks for the food." The words oozed out like honey.
    
-   In _Heat of the Moment_, Sunset Shimmer gets turned on by watching Twilight Sparkle lick the whipped cream from her finger....then things happen.
-   In _If They Haven't Learned Your Name_, according to Sam Wilson, his partner (both in the Air Force and romantic) Riley was very good at oral sex, and he used to fellate and deepthroat any food item that looked even slightly phallic, from popsicles to corn on the cob, just to watch Sam squirm. The corn on the cob apparently happened at Riley's Fourth of July family barbecue, and as a result, Sam can no longer look Riley's mother in the eye, nor eat corn on the cob.
-   A _KanColle_ fancomic by Wangphing plays it for drama. All the other men Kashima knew saw her as a sexpot, so when the Admiral innocently asks her to try his candy bar, she anticipates the same intent and deliberately starts eating in this manner to get it over with.
-   _Kingdom Hearts II_: Axel. Roxas. Sea salt ice cream. If something combining all of these things doesn't appear here, then Yaoi Fangirls aren't doing their job. Or are... otherwise occupied.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   In the epic _Of Love and Bunnies_, an order of fries drops down Kim (the original Pink Ranger)'s bra after Tommy (her ex-boyfriend and former White Ranger), driving the jeep they're in, hits a pothole. Tommy finds he can see down her shirt through the rear-view mirror and starts swerving off the road. Kim realizes this and starts eating the fries as suggestively as possible and making a few... choice comments.
    -   From another _Power Rangers_ fic, albeit an original one named _Power Rangers GPX_, the Yellow Ranger Maria Aparicio eats a chocolate cake so suggestively it's almost an homage to _When Harry Met Sally..._. In her justification, however, it is stated to be some damn good cake.
-   A common request on the Phoenix Wright Kink Meme, usually involving popsicles, though it was horribly subverted for laughs in at least one instance. This TF2 comic<small>◊</small> illustrates the subverted version.
-   _The Power of Seven_: When Harry is temporarily trapped in his own dream, Luna uses the environment to give them both the opportunity to eat liquid chocolate off each other.
-   _Small Problems_: After Steven and Amethyst are left alone in the house, they start eating pancakes together. When there's only a few bites left, this trope ensues and eventually, so does G-Rated Sex.
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_ Kink Meme:
    -   Also, this which involves Kirk invoking this in front of Spock.
-   _Weightless_: After Kaidan's death, Shepard isolated and starved herself in her cabin, Garrus tried to get her to eat some chocolate. When she finally ate them, she did it while laying on her bed, completed with moaning and fingers-licking. Thanks to it, Garrus, who've been carrying the flame for her for months, kinda lost control and things went downhill from there (not in a good way).
-   In _When Reason Fails_, Himiko does the "eating ice-cream in a seductive manner" version with Geten's _torn-off hand_. Izuku is ashamed to realize that it's working with him.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Rare male example. Jaune, upon eating ice cream for the first time, _really_ likes it. Ruby promptly tells him to never, ever make those sounds again.
-   Aimo's _Dragon Age_ fan comic "Wonderland" here, (though you need a DeviantArt registration to see it) uses peaches, hard candy, milkshakes, cotton candy, and various things with cherries as a hilarious multifaceted metaphor for cunnilingus. Some of her other fan comics feature erotic eating as well, including "Strawberries and Cream" (of course) and "Curiousity" \[sic\].
-   One _The X-Files_ fanfic features Mulder daydreaming to kill time during an insanely boring meeting. It works...until he sees Scully munching on a banana. His daydreams get to the point of needing cold water.
-   In the Alternate Universe, All Human _Maleficent_ fic _Your servant, Mistress_, Diaval eats chocolate cake in an erotic way. Out of Maleficent's hand. And of course he doesn't leave any crumbs on her fingers.
-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Empath's Honeymoon", Empath and Smurfette start licking each other when they both fall into a chocolate mud pool and are covered in chocolate.

-   _Hot Shots!_: Topper and Ramanda sit in front of an open refrigerator, eating. First there was a grape, after a while, a pizza slice, and then it gradually progressed to Topper using Ramanda's stomach as an over and cooked eggs and bacon. All the while, Ramanda looked like she was enjoying it. It gets better. At the end, he holds up two rashers of bacon at her suggestively. But she smiles coyly and lifts up two enormous steaks.
    -   This is one of the many parodies of the scene in _9½ Weeks_, mentioned above.

    -   In a variation, where Rose McGowan's character Courtney suggestively asks her boyfriend to eat a popsicle, and mimics him. Yes, that way.
    -   Earlier on, Marcie jokes that Liz's suffocation was caused by her "practicing" on the jawbreaker the girls choked her with.
-   A literal and unpleasant version happens in _Killer Joe_, with a chicken leg the title character puts in his crotch.

-   In _Other People's Money_, when Kate allows Lawrence to feed her a cracker with mushroom dip, she leans forward (bear in mind that she's wearing a _very_ low-cut dress), opens her mouth more than necessary, sticks her tongue out, and allows him to place the cracker on her tongue before she takes the entire morsel into her mouth. It's a very suggestive scene.
-   Spoofed but good in _Pootie Tang_. Pootie woos the Sheriff's daughter by grabbing handfuls of the cherry pie she baked for him and seductively spreading it over his chest. It's hilariously silly, gross and unsexy, but still gets her so aroused that she tackles him through a window on the spot.
-   _Private Parts_: The girl who took an entire sausage all the way in and out of her throat.
-   Marvel Ann does this with a banana at the start of _Psycho Beach Party_ at the cinema while flirting with a boy, he responds by doing this to an ice-cream sandwich, which turns into a mess. Fortunately she's still happy.

-   _Tampopo_, the Japanese "noodle western" combines this with some serious fetishes:
    -   An egg being passed from mouth to mouth between lovers in one scene, for starters...
    -   Then there's the scene where the Gangster licks honey from his girlfriend's lips, strongly suggesting he's licking a different body part. In fact, roughly a third of the movie is this trope.
-   _The Theatre Bizarre_: "Sweets" is the story of Estelle and Greg, a pair of food fetishists whose entire relationship is based on this.
-   _Tightrope_ (1984). A stripper sucks suggestively on a lollipop each time she's being interviewed by Clint Eastwood's character.
-   One scene in the film _Tom Jones_ has Tom and a buxom woman consuming their dinner rather... suggestively to each other. Notably, this scene was lifted straight out of the original 18th-century novel. It's also parodied by a 1970s Dave Allen sketch, in which they're too busy throwing up afterwards to think about sex.
-   _El Topo_: This truly bizarre Mexican Western has a scene where eating fruit becomes a visual metaphor for lesbian sex.
-   Alluded to in _To the Bone_ when Luke first tries to coax Ellen into eating the Goo Goo Cluster.
    
    **Luke:** You know you want it.  
    **Ellen:** Okay, don't make it a sex thing.  
    **Luke:** It is a sex thing. Don't pretend it's not.
    
-   _Walk Hard_: Dewey and Darlene do this with ice cream cones during the montage for the innuendo-laden _Let's Duet_.
-   From _Women in Love,_ the fig.
    
    So it explodes, and you see through the fissure the scarlet. And the fig is finished, the year is over. That's how the fig dies, showing her crimson through the purple slit.
    
-   Parodied in Gene Wilder's _The Worlds Greatest Lover_, when Rudy's dressed like The Shiek and trying to avoid seducing his actual girlfriend. He lies on a bed and tries to eat a few grapes while talking to her, but neglects to lift the veil covering his mouth first, meaning he just messily smacks on them between two layers of cloth.
-   Andy Warhol did a film consisting entirely of a drag queen eating a banana in a suggestive way. It can be seen here

    Literature 

-   _Black Star Rising_ by Frederik Pohl takes a rather unusual approach to this trope. "Comrade, do you have a fascination with eating bananas, carrots, and juicy red sausages? Then comrade, you can be certain that to your work and study regimen we will be adding plenty of cold showers."
-   _Black Sunday_ has terrorist Faisal sensuously licking the melted chocolate off his fingers and realizing if the Israelis knew how much he adores Swiss Chocolate they might be able to figure out a way to find him.
-   Kurt Vonnegut's _Breakfast of Champions_ brings new meaning to Food Porn with a story about a planet where people were hungry all the time, and good food was hard to get. A "Prostifood" tricking on the street claimed to offer fresh vegetables and fruit for sale, but all she really had was stuff that tasted like coal. A porn flick started with a short of a woman eating an apple, and the "hard core" porn showed a family eating a turkey dinner, with the "Money Shot" showing them so stuffed that they threw half the food away. The perverts in the theater go berserk with approval.
-   _The Bronze Horseman_ by Paullina Simons. The protagonists Meet Cute when the man (a soldier on patrol) sees the woman eating an ice cream at a tram stop and is instantly smitten by her.
-   The day after the Princess Renn seduces Jerin in _A Brother's Price_ she comes to the kitchen to watch him cook. He gives her a spoon dipped in maple syrup, and she licks it off, deliberately reminding him of last night.
    
    "It's sweet, but not as sweet as you."
    
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Parodied when the wizards' housekeeper is "daintily eating a banana, a feat which is quite hard to do."
    -   Don't forget Nanny Ogg's cookbook, _The Joye of Snacks_, containing recipes which are blamed for all sorts of indecorous goings-on—all off-screen, so we never find out exactly what makes "Bananana Surprise" so surprising. The chocolate pudding, however, is shown to act like an Aphrodisiac, making 2/3 of the men that eat it very hot around the collar and desperate to run off for buckets of ice water (and the other 1/3 goes ramrod straight and completely rigid). The only one unaffected is the Big Eater, on account of it 'not touching the sides' in Granny Weatherwax's words.
        
        "Maids of Honor?" "Welllll... they starts off as Maids of Honor... but they ends up as Tarts."
        
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   In _Turn Coat_, a woman in the nightclub Zero is "doing a thing with her tongue and an ice cube that was ... distracting as hell."
    -   In _Proven Guilty_, when Maeve (a faerie queen of Winter) is drinking lemonade through a straw, Harry hears crunching noises coming from her mouth and realizes the lemonade freezes when it passes her lips. Which makes Harry _very_ glad he had already bluntly turned down her advances moments before.
-   Older Than Feudalism: Herodotus' _Histories_ book 2 contains a description of an affair in which the narrator (Lucius) gets very hot over the way she drinks wine, and says so. Then they...get on with it. This doesn't make much sense, until you realize that wine was served in oval-shaped bowls called kraters: sometimes with one side tapered into a spout. To drink neatly from such a device without loudly slurping, it is often necessary to lap the drink with one's tongue.
-   _Lolita_ The eponymous character, Lolita, who's real name is Delores, manages to seduce/distract/seriously mock her Stepfather by sucking on a banana.
-   Subverted in Neil Gaiman's _Neverwhere_, with Anasthesia making "the least erotic show of eating a banana ever".
-   A recurring location in _Sebastian_ by Anne Bishop is a cafe sandwiched between houses of prostitution and serving mostly suggestively shaped entrees. A rather hilarious scene describes the title character's reaction to watching a girl dip a "Phallic Delight" in cheese sauce and lick the sauce off.
-   In Marya Hornbacher's memoir _Wasted_ a woman with an eating disorder says that she's "making love to" an apple she's eating.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _30 Rock_: When Cerie gets engaged, Frank asks her if it'll "change the way you dress or eat lollipops". To his relief, she says it won't.
-   _Bottom_: Rik Mayall didn't even need an excuse to get pervy: "I could have been watching Sophie Grigson peeling a banana, or washing a cucumber..."
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_
    -   Bloodsucking is repeatedly used in this way throughout.
    -   In the episode "Fool For Love", Drusilla (a vampire) sucks on Spike's bloodstained finger after he kills a Slayer. As Slayer blood is supposedly a powerful aphrodisiac, this might also qualify as foreplay.
    -   In the least subtle example, Riley got sucked off (his wrist!) in a House of Vampiric Pleasures, with the camera angle and sound effects making it rather... confusing at first just where the sucking was taking place.
    -   When Buffy meets up with Angel in the crossover episode "I Will Remember You" they are shown in bed after a make-out session with Buffy sensuously eating chocolate and licking split peanut butter off Angel's chest.
-   In the _Chuck_ episode "Chuck Versus the Fear of Death," the current Greta and her Subway sandwich. Though it doesn't actually _show_ her eating, the scene in question is, _ahem_, very suggestive.
-   _The Daily Show_: Stephen Colbert does this _a lot_. The most famous on-screen instance involves a banana, but there have also been cases with ice-cream, coffee and (repeatedly) _pizza_ (which resulted in a Pizza Boy Special Delivery that did not go how you thought it would).
    
    **Jon Stewart**: _\[watching Stephen eat Crazy Bread\]_ Oh, that is disturbing!
    
-   Subversion in a Dave Allen sketch: Dave's date erotically toys with and licks her breadstick... then suddenly and viciously bites the end off, triggering a Spit Take.
-   _Dickinson_: In "You cannot put a Fire out" Sue feeds Emily a grape quite suggestively.
-   _The Drew Carey Show_: The crotches of Lewis and Oswald's pants explode when they witness an attractive woman suggestively eating a popsicle.
    -   Drew and his ever-fattening girlfriend Nicki had a low-rent version of the infamous sexual eating scene from _9½ Weeks_.
-   _Fellow Travelers_: In 1957, Timothy Laughlin stares seductively at Hawkins Fuller while purposely drinking milk in such a way that it spills from his mouth and drips from his chin. Hawk is so aroused by the sight of this that he licks the milk from Tim's neck and chin, and then kisses him.
-   _Firefly_: The un-aired original Pilot had Kaylee (Jewel Staite) eating a strawberry in such delight that her eyes roll back in their sockets. A toned down version was put into the later episode "Shindig". Lampshaded in the DVD commentary for the pilot.
-   One episode of _Frasier_ includes the title character eating a frozen treat with a friend of his, a girl he had a crush on in high school. He says to her, "There was a time when I'd have paid a thousand dollars to watch you eat a popsicle." Then she bites it off.
-   _Fresh Meat_ has an instance of this with Vod and a piece of celery, although this is more played as Squick.
-   _Friends_: Rachel attempts to flirt with her current love interest with the "I can tie a cherry into a knot with just my tongue" line but almost chokes on the cherry instead.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Subverted at the end of Season 3; Ramsay Snow eats a sausage in a decidedly suggestive manner, but there is nothing erotic about it for two reasons: 1) The eater is not exactly unattractive, but is extremely creepy-looking, and 2) the man he's eating in front of had his penis and/or his testicles cut off in a previous episode by the eater, making it yet another round of psychological torture.
    -   In "The Lion and the Rose," Prince Oberyn Martell and Ser Loras Tyrell sensually chew on food to signal their sexual interest towards each other.
    -   In "Book of the Stranger", the wildling Tormund manages to seductively eat a whole chicken while making eyes at Brienne.
-   In an episode of _The Golden Girls_, at one point Blanche does this by tying the cherry stem while men watch her at it at the bar she frequents. The first performance is fine, but the second one gets derailed when Dorothy, who had secured newfound popularity after singing to the bar attendants earlier in that episode, shows up at that moment, resulting in all the men there immediately turning their attention to her and leaving Blanche alone, who nearly chokes on the cherry stem due to the sudden shift of attention focus.
-   _The Gong Show_:
    -   There was an act on the original show called "Have You Got A Nickel?", much better and more appropriately known as "The Popsicle Twins". Two girls just sat on stage in shorts and t-shirts and suggestively sucked on Popsicles. The audience _loved_ it; the judges, not so much. They weren't gonged because Jaye P. Morgan was the only judge that approved, and she physically prevented the other two from gonging it. She stated "That's how I got started in show biz!" It was apparently that was put in just to be censored, so that the censors would be distracted enough to let other real acts sneak by, and it was let through unexpectedly.
    -   Also appeared in some manner on the new _Gong Show_, in which a lacklustre musical group had a Sexy Schoolwoman sucking on a lollipop whilst they performed (and indeed, the song included lines precisely to this effect such as "suck my lollipop, baby")
-   _Gossip Girl_s Serena van der Woodsen with some strawberries dipped in chocolate. On the jitney.
-   During the Ko No Mono episode of _Hannibal_, there is a scene where Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham are eating whole roasted ortolan birds. The entire meal is shot as erotically as possible to imply mutual seduction, complete with extreme close-ups of tiny birds between open lips, swallowing throats, and an orgasmic haze.
-   _Horrible Histories_: In "Ridiculous Romantics", Anne Boylen provocatively sucks an olive off a toothpick in front of Henry VIII during the "Historical First Dates" sketch.
-   _Howard Stern On Demand_ has "deep-throat contests" where girls see how far they can take a hot dog without gagging.
-   _iCarly_: Bananas and ribs are the usual subjects. Spencer hides the banana he's eating under his blanket while "sleeping", and ribs is one of Sam's choice of meat.
    -   In the iCarly episode _iToe Fat Cakes_ Sam does some suggestive licking of a Canadian Fat Cake, and later, she puts the nozzle of the Fat Bag (creme injector) in her mouth, erm, suggestively.
-   _Legend of the Seeker_: Cara eating raw liver of the Shadrin she just killed, in "Princess".
-   On _Lost_, Kate tasting chocolate for the first time in a month.
-   _Married... with Children_ had a case where Al and his neighbor tried to rig a beauty contest for Kelly by being the judges. This fails when one of the other contestants unveils her talent entry, _"Eating a banana."_
-   _Misfits_: The infamous "bottle scene". Actually, Visual Innuendo is a common feature of the show.
-   When Red Hot Chili Peppers presented an award at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards, Anthony Kiedis ended the already Ho Yay\-laden intro by eating a banana in a single bite.
-   Parodies of Nigella Lawson's cooking shows. Nigella herself just occasionally tastes things, while coincidentally being good-looking, but comedians tend to blow it out of proportion.
-   _Oz_. Simon Adebesi's prag is seen doing this with a banana during a party he's throwing in his Luxury Prison Suite.
-   _Plebs_: Averted. It looks like Flavia is going to eat the banana in an erotic way, especially when she asks Stylax to look away while she's eating, but she then proceeds to hold it horizontal and nibble on it like corn on the cob.
-   _Queer as Folk_: One guess for the _teaching tool_ used in for Oral Sex.
-   Inverted and parodied on the _Saturday Night Live_ sketches featuring Kristen Wiig as a sexy redhead named Shana. On the first sketch (which appeared on the season 34 Christmas episode hosted by John Malkovich), she tries to eat a banana suggestively — and ends up gnawing at it like a dog with a raw steak. The second sketch (on the season 35 episode hosted by Charles Barkley) had Shana suggestively suck cream off the top of a mug of hot chocolate. She keeps coughing and spitting it out. The third (on the season 36 episode hosted by Bryan Cranston) had Shana trying to suggestively drink a protein shake, only to spit it back in the cup.
    -   Played straight in this sketch from the season 30 episode hosted by Luke Wilson, in which two guys (played by Luke Wilson and one-season feature player Rob Riggle) on a double date with their girlfriends (Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph, who coincidentally starred with Luke Wilson in the film, _Idiocracy_) end up alienating their dates when their dares to taste what's on the appetizer platter devolves into a Ho Yay\-laden Erotic Eating session.
-   _Scrubs_ has an...interesting take on this, although Jordan doesn't seem to mind.
    -   JD also gets an Amoral Attorney to lick off cupcake frosting off of her finger. She accidentally gets the potato salad.
-   _Sex/Life_: Brad is shown pouring liquid chocolate on Billie's body and then licking it off in a flashback.
-   One episode of _Smallville_, "Rush", has a scene in which Chloe Sullivan suggestively sucks on a lollipop.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: Deanna Troi shows us the proper way to finish off a chocolate sundae.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_. Jeri Ryan (playing the Doctor inhabiting Seven's body) had an orgasmic response to eating a New York cheesecake, as 'he' has never tasted food before. Given that Jeri Ryan had to fit into her skintight catsuit week after week, the pleasure was undoubtedly not acted.
-   _Sugar Rush_: Les Yay: there are numerous close ups of Sugar eating hot dogs and the like extremely suggestively. It's not just in permanently horny Kim's mind!
-   In an episode of _That's So Raven_ where Raven eats a 3-foot-long hot dog and Eddie comments how tight his pants are. The "joke" is supposed to be that he's eating so much junk food that he's gaining weight, but to anyone outside the show's intended demographic, it takes on a whole new meaning.
-   _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_. _Cameron_. Potato chips, and later, pancakes. When she's eating the pancakes, she's staring at Derek the whole time, and ends it with a pronounced swallowing. Keep in mind, this is the same episode that also ends with Derek watching Cameron do ballet, with a mixed look of awe and horror on his face.
-   Laurie in _That '70s Show_ dips her finger in Hyde's brownie batter and teases Kelso with "I really wish I could eat all this chocolate batter." As he tries to get it, she sucks it off her finger and says, "Guess I can!"
-   _Tipping the Velvet_: An early scene in the involves the heroine hand-feeding her eventual lesbian lover a raw oyster. There is exactly as little sub- in the text as you might imagine.

-   _The Vicar of Dibley_ : Alice does this in "The Easter Bunny" with a stick of chocolate, causing Hugo to get impure thoughts.

-   _Zoey101_: In the Anger Management episode of Lola eats the bowl of nuts.

-   German punk rock-and-misc band "Die Ärzte" dedicated an entire song — "Die Banane" — to the plight of a man who loses his composure and ruins a romantic dinner when his date decides to have a banana for dessert.
-   Played spectacularly, hilariously straight (well, kinda) in the Bloodhound Gang's video for "Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo." Ditto the cover of _Use Your Fingers_.
-   The video for "Angel in Disguise," a 1984 country No. 1 hit for Earl Thomas Conley. Near the end of the video, several exotic models are seen eating various food items usually, fruit in an erotic manner, with a focus also on Conley's reaction.
-   The lyrics of DJ Earworm's "United State of Pop 2021 (Strawberry Ice Cream)" build a sexual innuendo out of several food references from the sampled songs.
-   In the Edguy music video "Superheroes", some of the Playboy Bunnies eat carrots suggestively. So does the (male) lead vocalist.
-   The song "Hot Dog (watch me eat)" by the Detroit Cobras is entirely about this, and not even subtly either!
-   Escape The Fate's "Situations" video. Actually, the whole thing's really three minutes and thirty-two seconds of Fanservice, but one digresses.
-   The music video of "That's Good" by Devo has a scene described as "a french fry fucking a doughnut"
    -   The comment in question was from someone who watched the Dev2.0 version of the song produced by Disney, which veers into terror.
-   The insert for GACKT's "Vanilla" is a young woman letting a vanilla ice cream cone drip onto her nearly uncovered breasts.
-   "Annie aime les sucettes", written by songwriter and professional lech Serge Gainsbourg for 18-year-old France Gall in 1966. It's about a girl who likes lollipops and, of course, the lyrics are laced with double entendres. Gall famously didn't understand the song's second meaning and sang it innocently. Only after _Les Sucettes_ caused a scandal did she realize what she had sung.
-   The music video for "Melodies" by GAM has a rather long sequence where the two girl feeding each other breakfast which is made to look really sexy although it doesn't include any of the foods usually associated with this trope.
-   The video for Groove Coverage's "7 Years & 50 Days", which takes it to _weird_ levels.
-   The music video for INXS's "The One Thing" also features lots and lots of (messy but) suggestive eating, including some rather memorable scenes with a woman eating a fig.
-   Blues singer Julia Lee sings "The Spinach Song" about...eating a certain vegetable for the first time? "Somehow, it's always hittin' the spot / especially when they bring it in hot" and "no longer is the stuff on the shelf / cause now I make a pig of myself." Yeah, sure. Vegetables.

-   Joey Ryan attempted this by rubbing himself down with blow pop he had already sucked on. However, Ryan is a very hairy man, which is sexy to some women but not to many in that combination.
-   After the intermission of Absolute Intense Wrestling's _Hell On Earth XII_, Dick Justice was seen pushing a banana down his throat in an attempt to get notorious Femme Fatale Karlee Pérez away from Space Monkey. Unfortunately for them, it didn't work.

    Standup Comedy 

-   As seen in the page quote by George Carlin, combined with Male Gaze and All Men Are Perverts.
    
    **Carlin:** As long as I'm being a complete pig up here, let me ask you guys a question. Are you ever able to watch a woman eating a banana and NOT think about a blowjob? I can't do it. And I know why: I'm a sick, evil fuck! I admit that! I can't do it! Eating a banana, eating a pickle, licking on an ice cream cone. I'm thinking to myself **"LOOK AT THE TONGUE ON HER! _WOW!_"** So ladies, be careful when you're standing out in front of that Häagen-Dazs. 'Cause God damn it, we're watching. And God damn it, we're _thinking_!
    

    Theatre 

-   _Dangerous Beauty_: In the musical adaptation of the film, when courtesan Veronica is asked how she manages to capture the hearts and loins of every husband in Venice, she picks up a banana, deep-throats it, and then _pulls it out whole_. Then she spouts some crap about education and how men admire powerful women, but screw that, it's clear which way the wind is _ahem_ blowing.

    Video Games 

-   _Agarest Senki_ will always have at least one case of sexy banana eating.
-   In _The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures_, the icon for "Beat It and Eat It" on the level select screen shows a woman seductively licking an ice cream cone.
    -   Or sausage, God blesses them if they ever know what modest is.
-   _Bayonetta_ features suckers that factor as the series mushrooms (natch). Surprisingly subverted in that said suckers resemble Dum-Dum brand suckers as opposed to the exaggerated Blow-Pop or carnival novelty brands Then again, if you can make eating small suckers sexy, then that's impressive. The lollipops might be small on purpose, to fit with the whole dominatrix theme.
    -   At the beginning of the game, Bayonetta briefly licks a lollipop that is thrown to her, and she licks it in a very...suggestive manner.
-   In _Champions of Norrath_ a well-endowed and near-topless vampire maiden sends you on a mission to fetch her a plant that can act as a substitute for blood sustenance. Once she has it she devours it in front of you with orgasmic pleasure.
-   _Fate/Grand Order_: The "Fondant au Chocolat" Craft essence has Arjuna making direct eye contact with the player as he licks the last bits of chocolate from his fingers, holding a plate of lava cake that's been split open and oozing with sauce.

    **Player-kun (narrating):** Plus I will get to watch Moku-chan eat that phallic shaped corn dog ever-so-seductively. I will use my imagination to project my own penis onto the corn dog. Actually, wait. Nevermind that would be kind of terrible. She's going to be taking bites out of the corn dog. That would hurt like fuck.
    
-   Featured in promotional art for the _Neptunia_ series, specifically Neptune and Purple Heart eating a sausage with mayonnaise together, Rom and Ram eating a banana together (while in the bath and covered by Censor Suds), and White Sister Rom and White Sister Ram eating ice cream together.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   _Channel Awesome_:
-   Somehow played straight with the Massive Meat Log episode of Epic Meal Time.
-   The short film _Filthy Food_, with not the smallest trace of shame or subtlety.
-   Played for laughs in this reading of _Fifty Shades of Grey_.
-   _Gaia Online_ has several examples.
    -   Nicolae's oral fixation is the most obvious.
    -   Two of the Valentines given out during the Valentine's Day '09 event have characters holding hot dogs, clearly about to engage in this trope.
    -   Even the back-to-school event is not exempt from this. Behold, the discussion about bullying and humiliation.
        
        **Gino Gambino:** I went to a private boarding school, so we all had to change into our pajamas in the dormitories. All the other boys used to make fun of my sunken chest. One time they held me down and took turns eating soup out of it. How did I deal with it? Oh, mostly by crying, I guess.
        
        **Various fangirls:** ... That's kind of kinky.
        
    -   The Von Helson sisters participated in the Pie Hard pie-eating contest event. The image used for successfully feeding the twins pie was an obvious manip of the twins' seduction from '07, with the addition of... suggestive splatters of pie filling.
    -   There was a Running Gag for a while during announcements for new items, where one of the avatars would be holding the hotdog item or the image of it would be sneaked in some other way, in a clear reference to this trope. It later got officially referenced outside the item announcements with the Valentines' example above.
-   In _I Am Not Infected_ Hartley gets Amanda a popsicle, which she proceeds to eat in the most suggestive way possible. How he thought this would help their uncomfortable situation is unclear, but no one ever accused Hartley of making any brilliant plans.
-   Frequently inverted by many Shock Sites, which use this trope for squick instead of arousal. The fact that many of these clips are taken from pornographic films, meaning that they were intended to play this trope straight and arouse their viewers, only adds a further layer of Fridge Horror for their viewers.
-   This strip of _Surviving the World_ is a pretty obvious example.
    -   And that was the toned-down version!
-   _Tales of MU_: The first book has Puddy grabbing a donut specifically for the lesbian version.
-   The Try Guys eat Subway sandwiches as a substitute for sex when they act out fanfiction written about them. The first story with Eugene and Zach plays things pretty innocently with the eating, but the last story between Keith and Eugene plays the erotic part straight, with Eugene seductively nibbling on Keith's "sandwich."
-   Often time, YouTube fanvids of works of other media will invoke and/or parody this when taking clips of characters eating out of context and/or looping them, such as this looped clip of Applejack eating a s'more, for example.

    Western Animation 

-   Parodied in _American Dad!_, when Roger claims he knows how to teach another character how to please her man then swallows a whole banana. When he notices people staring he hurriedly explains that he wasn't making a point, he was just hungry...
    -   Played for laughs when American Dad deconstructs this in "For Whom The Sleigh Bell Tolls". Francine and Hayley invoke this trope and Hayley does better then the mother, resulting in Francine being offended.
    -   Another episode has Stan undercover as a teenaged girl trying to root out the source of fake IDs. He's charmed by his mark, seducing him by eating a cherry and tying the stem in his mouth in a way that allows him to it through a loop with his tongue.
    -   Invoked when Roger has a wedding cake baked to look like his fiancee, then buries his face in its ass.
-   Used in _The Boondocks_ in the episode "Guess Hoe's Coming to Dinner", when Cristal suggestively licks whipped cream off her fingers while moaning, then whispers "It's edible."
-   Done on _Chowder_ with Endive, who does this to lobster dipped in sauce and sucks on them. Unfortunately, since this _is_ Endive we're talking about its pure Fan Disservice.
-   _Clone High_: Joan of Arc disguises herself as a boy to be on the school basketball team. Cleo attempts to seduce her with Erotic Eating, unaware of who she really is, by using a banana and some milk.
-   Used as a Running Gag in an episode of _Duckman_. Each time the vice principal of Ajax's school takes a bite of her lunch (first with a hot dog, then a banana, and then concluding with a choclate-and-cream-filled eclair), Duckman launches into a train-tunnel-themed Imagine Spot.
-   Parodied/Lampshaded in _Family Guy_ when Death sticks a whole chicken leg down his throat and sucks the meat off the bone, explaining this "talent" by saying "...I did some films in college I'm not particularly proud of..."
    -   Played with/parodied in a recent episode. Stewie chastises Lois for not slicing his banana: "What am I supposed to do, just stick it in my mouth —well, _hello_!"
    -   A parody of the _9 1/2 Weeks_ scene, where Lois sensuously feeds Peter a strawberry, and he responds by shoving a huge watermelon slice into her face.
-   _Somehow_ done in _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ where we get an extended scene of Irwin sucking on a lime to titillate Mandy (of course Mandy reacts with indifference).
    -   Mandy also does this with a lollipop when trying to allure the one-time character "Piff"... you know, so she can crush him.
-   Parodied in _Metalocalypse_, where Murderface explains this as why he refuses to eat sausages, bananas and other similarly shaped food items. He'll also refuse to eat them if they are sliced, because of the castration metaphore.
    -   Later in the episode, when the band is hiding in a dark closet, the lights are turned on to reveal Murderface sucking on a sausage.
-   Done in _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ of all places, when Big Macintosh and Cheerilee are deeply in love thanks to a love potion. The two are holding a cherry in their teeth and almost popping it, while a group of ponies watch in shock and disgust.
    -   A picture's worth a thousand words<small>◊</small>. Scootaloo's wingboner doesn't make it look any less suggestive, either.
    -   The episode "Simple Ways" has the fashionist Trenderhoof having an Imagine Spot with Applejack eating an apple erotically.
-   Spoofed in a _Robot Chicken_ skit, in which a busty blonde is about to eat a corndog, but stops when she realizes that every guy in (and outside) the bar is watching her.
    -   A later sketch parodies Burger King commercials by having Gargamel erotically eating a Smurfburger after stripping down to a bikini by a pool.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Parodied when Grampa and Beatrice flirt by consuming _pills_ in a suggestive manner. Which in itself is a parody of the famous scene in _Tom Jones_, above.
    -   Also on the episode where Selma tries to find a man as per her Aunt Gladys's last request, during a date video taping, Selma chews on a (lit) cigarette and sticks out her tongue where the cigarette is now tied in knots (the only reason she can do that without feeling pain is revealed on season three's "Black Widower" where she told Sideshow Bob that a childhood accident where a bottle rocket went up her nose permanently destroyed her sense of taste and sense of smell.
        
        Then again, so does smoking for a long time, which also happened to Selma when she was a kid, according to the season two episode "Three Men and a Comic Book" in which Patty and Selma take up smoking after telling Marge that she can do their chores for them so she can raise money for an Easy Bake Oven
        
        .
    -   And inverted into Fan Disservice on the Treehouse of Horror episode "Homer^3" (the one where Homer is stuck in a 3D world after trying to hide from Patty and Selma).

    -   After eating dinner, Marge and Ned Flanders both eat strawberries dipped in whipped cream more erotically in "The Devil Wears Nada". Even the promotional artwork for the episode shows this.

-   _Spongebob Squarepants_:
    -   The way Spongebob ate his chocolate bar to piss Patrick off.
    -   And the way Patrick licks a popsicle while investigating the Clamu incident.
    -   The episode "Valentine's Day", when at the end, Patrick bites into a giant chocolate balloon and it explodes, covering the entire area in gooey chocolatey goodness.
