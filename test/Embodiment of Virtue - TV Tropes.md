In some works of fiction, virtue is a central theme. Virtues usually constitute parts of a system, where the individual virtues are regarded as aspects of goodness, and no virtue alone is enough to form a good character. While they complement each other, they may also come into conflict with each other, leading to moral conundrums.

In fictional works dealing with virtue, the author often chooses to assign each virtue in the system to a different character, allowing said characters to allegorically represent their respective virtues through the natural leanings of their personalities. For example, a naturally empathic and compassionate character may be (explicitly or implicitly) assigned the virtue of Compassion to represent, while another may be assigned the virtue of Loyalty on account of his or her personalities' natural affinity for this virtue.

Sometimes this trope is applied to entities other than characters in works of fiction, such as organizations or even inanimate objects. In the latter case the representation has nothing to do with the personality of the assignee, for obvious reasons, but is rather more arbitrarily symbolic. For this reason this is not a strict subtrope of Allegorical Character.

In the specific case of _literal_ personification of a moral ideal in the form of a character, we are speaking about an Anthropomorphic Personification.

The inversion of this trope is Embodiment of Vice. One notable difference between the two tropes is that in the case of characters, the people involved usually are aware of their virtues, and strive to actively cultivate them. Characters that personify vices are usually either unaware of them or somehow unable to overcome them. For example, characters that actively strive to be honorable and courageous are extremely commonplace in fiction, but how many characters have you encountered that strive to be as greedy as possible, for the sake of greed in and of itself? (well, it does happen occasionally). Vice is nearly always motivated by something other than the desire to be vicious, unlike virtue. In the (at least in real life) rare cases where this is not the case, we are dealing with a villain who does evil simply For the Evulz. Compare the Seven Heavenly Virtues.

Like everything else about him, Norius' virtue is hollow; By his Villainous Breakdown, righteousness and belief in justice are exposed for _self_\-righteousness and mad for revenge.

-   In _Quest for Camelot_, the introduction to Camelot itself is accompanied by a chorus of all of the Knights of the Round Table singing about unity of purpose. They go on to take their places at the table, each lifting their shield to honor their king, and then lowering it as they declare the virtue they most embody. There are far more than seven knights at the table, and not all of them get the chance to name their virtue, but "liberty", "justice", "trust", "freedom", "peace", "honor", "goodness", "strength", and "valor" are listed. Note that the main character's father laid down his shield on "valor", and the villain laid his down with a shout of "ME!".
