_"The boy got out in front of the car!" "There was no boy!" "The boy hit me first!"_

This is for when a character says something clearly contradictory, if not completely opposite, to what they literally said right beforehand.

May sometimes happen in the context of a Hurricane of Excuses. Can be caused by a Distinction Without a Difference. When a contradiction seems immediate to the viewer but is not immediate in in-universe time, that would be a Gilligan Cut. See also Verbal Backspace, I Resemble That Remark!, Ironic Echo Cut, Confession Deferred. Subtrope of Hypocritical Humor. For instances where a character is contradicted by someone/something else, see Instantly Proven Wrong. If the speaker waits until their audience is out of earshot to contradict themselves, that's Two-Faced Aside. See also Stereotype Reaction Gag, By "No", I Mean "Yes", Double Think.

This is often the case in Such a Phony situations, when one character talks crap about another but pretends to be nice in their presence.

## Sorry we don't have any examples of this trope for you, but we do have a list of many instances when this trope is applied to works of fiction:

    open/close all folders 

    Animation 

-   _Happy Heroes_: In Season 7 episode 13, Little M. realizes Clown Monster's ability is to use the energy of people's laughs to turn them into stone and he wants to make him laugh, so he confidently states he won't let himself be persuaded to laugh... and then he immediately laughs afterward, thus getting himself pertrified.
-   _Mechamato_:
    -   Pian's mother, who's away from home, tells her son that he needs to get used to being by himself, and for that reason hired 10 bodyguards and 10 butlers to keep him company. However, when Pian tells her he sent them all back, she is impressed.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In chapter 17 of _Asteroid in Love_ (adopted as part of the fifth episode), the Earth Sciences Club caught Sayuri peeking into their own clubroom. When asking Sayuri about her motive, she says "No! No details for you!"... followed by a very detailed Motive Rant.
-   _Aquarion EVOL_: Right in the middle of one of her "boys are disgusting, you should always turn them down firmly" rants, Mix suddenly remembers that she had promised to meet up with Andy, whom she's been very obviously crushing on for some time, and runs off.
-   In the 10th anniversary edition of _Azumanga Daioh_, Osaka overhears Kaorin gushing about Sakaki and asks if Kaorin is gay. Kaorin corrects Osaka, telling her that the correct term is "lesbian"... and then has a panic attack as she denies that she _is_ a lesbian. Whereupon she immediately tries to play off her feelings as a "teenage thing", and when she was gushing over Sakaki she was doing it platonically anyway, and just to prove she's not a lesbian: she wouldn't mind if Sakaki was a guy... Osaka became confused.
-   In _Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo_, Bobobo explains to the wealth-obsessed villain Halekulani that there are things more important than money. Like _money_!
-   In _Dragon Ball_'s Bad Future, Bulma tells Trunks nice things about his father while her thought bubbles reveal she really knew him only as a cold-blooded killer. When Trunks returns with good stories of Vegeta she's genuinely surprised, though she doesn't let Trunks see it.
-   In _Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun_, Wakamatsu aggressively denies to Seo, Nozaki and Sakura that he's a tsundere (specifically for Seo). While doing so, he puts his hand on his hip while pointing with his other hand and afterward he stutters, "So i-it's not as if I like you or anything, Senpai!" The others snark that those are very stock tsundere traits.
-   In _Suite Pretty Cure ♪_, Ellen denies being afraid of hermit crabs, then two seconds later, screams her head off when Hibiki shows her one.

    Comic Books 

-   _Achille Talon_ has a bulldog-faced American general claim, with absolute sincerity, that if there's one thing he hates more than the Chinese, it's racism.
-   _Making Comics_: McCloud concludes the introduction with "In short: there are no rules. And here they are."
-   _Secret Wars (2015):_ As Reed Richards and the Maker (the Reed of Earth-1610) are talking about what to do with Doctor Doom, the Maker first says he wants to defeat him, then in the next sentence says he means to _destroy_ him. Reed decides to move past this in favor of what might happen to the universe they're in if they do.
-   _The Simpsons Futurama Crossover Crisis_: After arriving in Springfield, Bender says he doesn't remember anything and that he reeks of booze. He then adds that he learned his lesson and will never drink again. However, the next panel reveals he's right next to Moe's and he decides to have a few beers to celebrate his new sobriety.

    Comic Strips 

-   Near the end of _The Boondocks_, Huey decides to finally kick off his revolution to overthrow the system and starts recruiting his friends to join him. When he asks Jazmine she tells him that there's no way she can because her overprotective parents don't even allow her to go further from home than the second light post down the street. When Huey offers to be her friend if she does, she instantly agrees without a second's pause.
-   The page image from _Calvin and Hobbes_ comes from this strip.

-   On _Garfield_, Garfield often utilizes this as a form of comedy whenever he's arguing with Jon over how much he eats and sleeps:
    -   In one comic, Jon insists on eating 2 cookies and Garfield only have one. Garfield complains that's not fair. Camera zoom out so we see that Garfield's cookie has the radius of a bicycle wheel while Jon's two are miniature (at least compared to Garfield's cookie).
    -   In one comic, Garfield claimed he's going to cut back on sleeping by taking only 2 naps per day instead of 4. However, he specifically meant 2 four-hour naps when he originally did 4 two-hour naps.

    Fan Works 

-   _All Mixed Up!_ has an example from Chapter 8 that is definitely not played for comedy. Otto is worried about Olive not showing up for work and not going with the rest of the precinct to Mariana Mag's aquarium, and begs Oprah to wait for her. It's not until later that he realizes his partner's been attacked by Mariana herself.
    
    **Otto:** Ms. O, can't we wait just a _little_ while longer? She'll be here soon, I'm sure of it!

For instance, he firmly believes that Izuku is an utter crybaby with no handle whatsoever on his emotions... _and_ that he's a Manipulative Bastard who only sheds Crocodile Tears, acting as though these are both somehow simultaneously true.
-   _Danny Phantom: Fire And Ice_: Played for Drama and combined with Insecure Love Interest. Ember wonders if she's simply too selfish and horrible to ever be worthy of Danny, then notices that he seems unhappy and immediately shoves her inner conflict aside to focus on helping him, seemingly unaware of how her actions don't line up with her fears about herself.
-   In the first chapter of _The Forbidden Drink II: Return of the Titans_, Luz denies that she still has lingering issues with Amity (who scarred her while under the Collector's control in the previous story), and says that if she were to show up at the Owl House's door, Luz would ask her out on the spot.

    -   After the public learns about Minute Maid, Tazmine Girl enthusiastically declares that she _loves_ Minute Maid — right before launching into a baseless conspiracy theory accusing her of causing the Gray Men attacks.
    -   After the Kronos attack, she tells Hiboshi off for suggesting the heroes are to blame for the casualties, declaring that "This isn't the time for a manhunt, it's the time for recovery!" She then instantly pivots into blaming everything on Minute Maid again.

    **Peridot:** I changed my mind.
    
-   _The Karma of Lies_: After Adrien claims that Lila's lies aren't really hurting anyone, Marinette retorts that _she's_ being hurt, only for Adrien to reply that "You're our everyday Ladybug.

When putting on his old suit that he wore when he was a villain, he tries to talk himself out of it by saying that perhaps the suit won't fit him any longer. Seconds later and he finds that it fits him perfectly, much to his chagrin.
-   In _The Prayer Warriors_, Jerry insists that he and his girlfriend Mary are not dating. In the next sentence, he clarifies that they _are_ dating, but they're not having sex yet.
-   In this _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_ fanart, set after a hypothetical redemption arc for Catra, Catra goes straight from insisting that the picture of her as a member of the Best Friends Squad is a fake that she most certainly didn't draw to basically admitting it by being upset that Adora is crumpling it.

    **Ino:** I was totally lying earlier, this hairstyle looks so cute on you! And it's really well done! Did you do this yourself?  
    **Sakura:** No, Kakashi-sensei did it.  
    **Ino:** _(side-eyeing him)_ You could have feathered it a bit more.  
    **Kakashi:** I didn't have any scissors with me to—

    Literature 

## By Author:

-   Dave Barry often uses this. For example, an attack ad claiming a politician had relations with a sheep named Bernice. The politician denies the whole thing, and besides, her name was Jennifer.
-   Marquis de Sade's libertines would often offer contradictory justifications for their crimes, such as claiming that what they did is natural and therefore right, then that morals simply don't exist or are entirely relative. They might also whine that society is cruel to prevent them acting on their desires with its laws, but then say their acts can't be helped since free will is just an illusion-wouldn't that apply to the people "oppressing" them legally as well? Sometimes they were called on this by others (not that it helped them, or at all dissuaded the libertine characters), but usually it goes uncommented on. A reader may find it unsurprising though, viewing these as just rationalizations of their atrocities.

## By Title:

-   In _Devin and the Teacher_ the unnamed narrator _insists_ the title character Devin isn't a troublemaker; then promptly lists all the times he had caused trouble.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _Moving Pictures_, Gaspode the wonder dog speaks in the presence of several of the human characters. One of them asks, "Can that dog talk?" and another answers, "He says he can't." The first is left to confusedly concede, "I guess he would know..."
    -   In _Monstrous Regiment_, one of the characters explains early on that she had a sweetheart who joined the army, and she gave him a sixpence to take to the blacksmith and be cut in half so they could each have a half, like in the "broken token" ballads, in case of No Doubt the Years Have Changed Me, but his regiment must have been called away because she never saw him again... Near the end of the book, she's told that they think they've found him. And she looks at the guy, and the expression on his face when he thinks there might be an advantage to marrying one of the heroines of the hour, and says her Johnny must have been killed. And also, she wants him to give her the sixpence back.
    -   Duke Felmet's string of denials about killing Verence I at the end of _Wyrd Sisters_, which _starts_ "I wasn't even there, and anyway he attacked me", and then _keeps going_ until he eventually concludes "That's it. He tripped and fell on his own dagger in self defence."
    -   In _Men at Arms_, when Vimes is Off the Wagon, he responds to Carrot saying "I think he's a bit drunk" with "Drun'? 'm not drun'! You wouldn' dare call m' drun' if I was sober!"
-   In _Doglands_, Pace does this.
    
    **Pace:** I don't mean to be patronizing-that means 'talking down to someone,' by the way.
    
-   In the _Dragonlance_ novel _Brothers Majere_, a kender taunts an enemy with "I wouldn't tell you if your pants were unlaced, which, by the way, they are."
-   Happens in the narration of _The Eye of Argon_ a couple of times. "Cushioning their bare feet were plush red velvet slippers" - if they're wearing slippers, how are their feet bare?
-   _Harry Potter_: Harry, at the time a 3rd year, has not been given permission to go to Hogsmeade, an all-wizard town. Head boy Percy assures Harry he's not missing anything while listing off a series of cool shops, places, and things Harry will be missing.
-   _The Hunger Games_: Katniss lists three things of why Haymitch's life sucks: he has no wife, children, and he drinks a lot. In the next paragraph, she states she won't get a wife or children either.
-   _Peter Pan_: Wendy wakes up to find Peter crying on the floor. Before she can find out why he's crying, they have to introduce themselves, which leads to them getting sidetracked onto the subject of parents and the fact that Peter hasn't got a mother. Wendy assumes that this is why he was crying, which gets an indignant response from Peter: "I wasn't crying about mothers, I was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn't crying."
-   In _Rob Roy_, Andrew Fairservice expects to get away with stealing a horse because the Scottish judiciary is fair, unlike its English counterpart, and "\[his\] mother's mother's third cousin is cousin to the Provost of Dumfries and will not suffer his kin to be put on trial".
-   _Whateley Universe_: In _No Beast So Fierce_, Jadis notices one of her brother's missing gadgets among the things Belphoebe received from Belphegor. She and Belphoebe start arguing, with Jadis angry over the theft and Belphoebe denying it indignantly. Jobe tries to defuse the situation, but changes tack mid-sentence when he notices one of his _own_ missing devices in the stash.
    
    "Ladies, ladies, LADIES!" Jobe oiled soothingly, "there's no need to get all upset about... HEY! That's my neural-implant splicing-servo that disappeared in November! Why you little..."
    

## Other:

-   A Finnish logic textbook has an example where you have to figure out for yourself why it's a contradiction. The rabbit is on trial and claims not to be guilty, but when the prosecutor claims that if the rabbit did it, he had an accomplice, the rabbit says that that's a lie — whereupon the judge deems him guilty. If the "if" is interpreted as a material conditional, then the only way the claim "If he did it, he had an accomplice" gets the value "false" is if he did it and he didn't have an accomplice. You might even apply some similar reasoning with normal language, but it gets much more uncertain.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The A-Team_, "Chopping Spree". When Hannibal figures out that Tony Victor is planning on killing the D.A. trying to punish him at Judge Holloway's funeral, Face protests that Victor's "not crazy enough" to do something like that. After a brief pause, he admits that, yes, he _is_ crazy enough.

-   _Chappelle's Show_:
    -   In the segment "Ask a Gay Dude with Mario Cantone", a viewer asks if receiving oral sex from a male is better than receiving it from a woman, to which Cantone frustratingly replies that he doesn't know and moves on to the next question, only to shout that it's better shortly afterwards.
    -   And also in the famous Rick James episode, where the _real_ Rick James at first denies grinding his dirty boots into Eddie Murphy's new couch, and then moments later admits it.
-   On _Cheers_, Woody comes to Norm for relationship advice.
    
    **Norm:** Okay, Woods, what you want to do is be honest with Kelly. Honesty is the cornerstone of any relationship.

-   In _Doctor Who_, the Doctor gives explanations for various things, only to immediately say that the explanation is wrong, since a lot of the time, he doesn't seem to have an answer or he thinks his companions need it dumbed down for them. The Eleventh Doctor is especially prone to discarded analogies.
    -   The 11th Doctor tells Amy in "The Beast Below" that they are observers only, never interfering in the affairs of other peoples or planets. Amy starts to ask the Doctor if it's difficult, being detached like that, only to see him on the scanner, talking to a young girl who was crying.

-   _The Election Chaser_: During the 2010 Australian Federal Election, Peter Van Onselen of Sky News called the election for Labor at 8:01pm, before acknowledging three minutes later that this may have been premature - a good choice, since four hours later neither side had a majority and it was clear the result would be a hung Parliament. For this, Andrew and Chas of _Yes We Canberra_ awarded him "Most Premature Election Call", only to immediately change their minds before he could accept it.
-   _Firefly_:

        **Marshall:** No, I wasn't!

It's that kind of show.
-   On _M\*A\*S\*H_ in the episode, "Alcoholics Unanimous", Frank gives Hawkeye and Trapper a quiz about drinking to see if they're alcoholics. They say no to all the questions, but do exactly what the questions ask. For example:

-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_:
    -   From the _Spanish Inquisition_ sketch:
        
        **Cardinal Ximenez:** NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition! Our chief weapon is surprise, surprise and fear, fear and surprise; our _two_ weapons are fear, surprise, and ruthless efficiency! Our _three_ weapons are fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency, and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope! Our _four_— No... _Amongst_ our weapons... _Amongst_ our weaponry are such elements as fear, surprise— I'll come in again...
        
        -   Later in the same skit the Spanish Inquisition have caught an old woman and read her charges:

    -   One sketch had Eric Idle playing a host at a nightclub.

    -   In the "Nudge, Nudge" sketch, Eric Idle plays a guy whose every utterance is a Lampshaded Double Entendre. When Terry Jones, the guy he's talking to, confronts him by asking, "Are you insinuating something?" he responds, "Oh no, no, no, no, no.....YES!"

    -   After Vincent says that girls are obsessed with their bodies, Carl says the following while looking at a magazine:
        
        **Carl:** I don't understand why. It feels like they think that guys like us are only attracted by looks even though frankl... _\[notices the picture of a hot-looking girl\]_ Eh, boy! Have you seen that hottie! _\[Vincent excitedly comes over to look at the picture.\]_

It also says he died with his parents in the Tulsa Massacre while still a child, before he could have sired her father. Being a computer, this discrepancy isn't noted or troubling to it.
-   On _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_, Ryan did this several times in the game "Narrate", in which the action pauses while the characters alternately deliver a Private Eye Monologue to the audience. It also made him an Unreliable Narrator.
    
    **Ryan:** _(to the audience)_ I was scared. But I didn't want to look like I was scared. That's why I put up a tough front.  
    **Ryan:** _(in-scene, sobbing)_ Please don't kill me! What purpose would it serve to kill me, after all these years?!
    

    Music 

## In General:

-   "Accidents Never Happen" is a Protest Song parodying the nuclear industry's reaction to Chernobyl which consists entirely of this, with every line of reassurance followed by "and even if it does" and _another_ line of reassurance, which itself is undercut by the next line. The final punchline is that _even if_ all these things _do_ happen "the death rate's very small. Only one per person, and that's hardly death at all!"
-   Popular folk song "Oh Susannah" can't make up its mind about the weather or even the time of day:
    
    _It rained all night  
    The day I left  
    The weather it was dry.  
    The sun so hot  
    I froze to death  
    Susannah don't you cry._

Because he's afraid of running into her, he moves to Los Angeles and begins writing a screenplay. He says that it's not about his ex, but someone who has the same looks and name.
    
    _I'm moving to LA  
    I'm writing a screenplay  
    But it's not about you or what we were  
    It's about a new girl, you've never met her  
    She's just got your name  
    And she looks exactly the same_
    
-   Kyo ft Sita's "Le Chemin" (The Path) has the singers claiming "I hate you with all my body but I still love you".

    -   Other examples from '90s Alternative include Bush's "Glycerine" ("I'm never alone/I'm alone all the time") and Harvey Danger's "Flagpole Sitta" ("I'm not sick but I'm not well").

        You can't believe a word she says  
        Most times, but this time, it was true_
        
-   Will Stetson's "KING":
    
    _Once again I have a new request to ask of you!  
    It's the same as ever:  
    Watch your back, no warning, warning_
    
-   Played for Drama on the Eminem song "Kim," where, despite his protests, it becomes clear he still loves Kim.

-   In a Sunni Muslim hadith<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (fourth one down on that page), a Jew named Al-Husayn bin Salam converts to Islam (and gets a Meaningful Rename to Abdullah bin Salam, Abdullah meaning "God's servant"). When some other Jews show up, the Prophet asks them their opinion on bin Salam. They reply "He is the most learned person amongst us, and the best amongst us, and the son of the best amongst us." Then bin Salam walks out and declares he has become a Muslim. The Jews tell the Prophet "He is the evilest among us, and the son of the evilest amongst us." Even funnier, bin Salam predicted their reactions beforehand.

To make it even more hilarious, his accent, use of vocabulary, and mannerisms waver between his own and Drumpf's as he talks.
-   _The Goon Show_, in keeping with its generally surreal atmosphere, uses this trope a lot, such as when Bloodnock offers to give Neddie a lamppost 'free, entirely free, for 99 pounds'. Similarly, in "The Spon Plague", a taxi driver stated that the fare was 'four and six, pronounced \*silly high-pitched voice\* ten bob!'.
-   In one of his rants on _The Now Show_, Marcus Brigstocke criticizes climate change deniers, in particular complaining that you can't say the Earth isn't getting warmer _and_ the warming is perfectly natural.

-   _Shadowrun Returns_ and the other standalone games in the series naturally give brief description of the game's races on the character creation page. Regarding Trolls, they mention that they're generally seen as stupid and brutish, but point out for the most part that it's just Fantastic Racism and they're as smart as anyone else. Right below that is the character build, which shows a maximum Intelligence stat for Trolls that's lower than that of Humans, or Elves, say.

        **Doctor:** Exactly! You see, your stress levels are triggering your hair loss. If you want to keep your hair and hopefully see some of it grow back, you're going to need to maintain your composure at all times, keep your temper to a minimum, learn to relax!  
        **Mackenzie:** _Relax?_ I'm sorry doc, but I don't live in a _goddamn_ mentos commercial! I am head cheerleader. Do you have _any_ idea the incredible pressure that I'm — _(a chunk of Mackenzie's hair falls out)_ — Oh my god!

            **Tex:** That's not true.  
            **Tucker:** It's not? I'll give you ten bucks to tear off Grif's arm.  
            **Tex:** Which one's Grif?

-   In the _Dumbing of Age_ storyline "This Was Halloween", Mary's hilariously terrible Hell House includes a bizarre rant about cancel culture, then an assertation that God will never cancel anyone, then straight to the Great Flood. (Yes, the standard theology is that God doesn't do that kind of thing _any more_, but she doesn't explain that because she doesn't see the contradiction; "cancelling" is a bad thing that bad people do, and when Good People do it, it's not that.)
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, after Agent Wolf accidentally gave out more information than he should have, he gives a Hurricane of Excuses, each one contradicting the previous one.
    
    **Agent Wolf:** And that's classified. I said nothing. And if I did, it was the summary of an anime Cranium makes me watch on our dates. Also we're not dating.
    
-   In _Girl Genius_, when Gilgamesh Wulfenbach is going into Mechanicsburg while it's under a Time Stop:

    -   "The Great Money Caper": One of Homer and Bart's cons:

            **Scratch:** But, but how are you gonna get Tails to help you?  
            **Grounder:** Yeah! Tails may be a genius, but he's not stupid!  
            **Robotnik:** I'll find a way! I'll make him cooperate of his own free will, even if I have to force him!
            
        -   In "Zoobotnik", Robotnik teams up with Katella the Intergalactic Huntress to capture Sonic. Katella falls in love with Robotnik, but she absolutely refuses to keep her hands off him.

Momma gets mad at Robotnik when he tells her the truth about Katella forcing him to marry her, saying she raised him to be a liar.

            **Tendi:** It made me realize that life's too short to be hung up on whether _everyone_ on the ship likes me.  
            **Rutherford:** That's great, 'cause I'm sure there's at least a few who don't.  
            **Tendi:** _(chuckles)_ And who cares? Not me. _(angrily)_ So who are these few people? What did they say? Do they not like me? You know what, I don't care. _(grabs Rutherford by the collar)_ But if someone said something, I feel like I should know. WHO WAS IT?!
            
    -   "Kayshon, His Eyes Open": Freeman decides to prove that she doesn't micromanage by refusing to check up on the away team, assuming that they can handle things.

-   _Tangled: The Series_: After learning that Rapunzel has her golden hair back but won't explain how that happened, Eugene urges her not to keep secrets from those she loves. Moments later:

    Real Life 

-   Calvin really _could_ have made a good lawyer: in law you do something called "arguing in the alternative"; e.g., "I didn't do it, nobody saw me do it, and who's to say a crime was even committed?"
-   One of Vice President Dan Quayle's infamous gaffes was, when following up on a statement that "The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history," said (paraphrased by reporter), "No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history." He also said "I believe we are on an irreversible trend towards more freedom and democracy, but that could change."
-   The phrase "I'm not prejudiced, but..." invariably comes before a prejudiced statement. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Similarly, "no offense" is often said just before saying something offensive. While the latter is sometimes an aversion (i.e. having to use Brutal Honesty but not wanting to hurt anybody's feelings), in other situations it's very much this trope.
-   It's also said that the phrase "With Due Respect" invariably comes before a _very_ disrespectful comment.
