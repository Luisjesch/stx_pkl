**Louise:** This smell is worse than when Gene kept a turkey sandwich as a secret pet for a year.  
**Gene:** Steve Turkel. He was my _best_ friend.

Some food is just too good to eat. Maybe someone special made it or it's the only one of its kind. If the love for it overpowers the desire to eat it, then it probably becomes Companion Food.

Companion Food is when someone keeps an item of food for longer than sanitary, necessary or appropriate. Characters who do this usually receive scorn for it, as even through refrigeration or freezing food can't last forever. What's worse is if they _don't_ put in any effort to preserve it; its days are numbered, and sooner or later it'll start to smell.

The word "companion" originally means "someone to share bread with", but in this case for this trope, your com_pan_ion _IS_ the bread.

The trope usually coincides with Anthropomorphic Personification, as the characters who keep the food may give it terms of endearment and talk to it. An even stranger direction the trope takes is when the person has a _romantic_ attraction to the food, and as a result may cross over with Why Don't You Marry It? and Cargo Ship. Characters who engage in Companion Food are often Cloudcuckoolanders with a vivid imagination. They could also be a Big Eater with a passion for food.

The food in question may be a fruit or vegetable that the character is growing. It isn't inappropriate if they spend long amounts of time with it because it isn't decomposing yet, but it's still odd if they love it like their child.

The trope typically ends with people eating it (or at least _trying_ but risking their own health) or throwing away the food. This usually accompanies feelings of regret and grief. Thus they recover from their obsession and realise that food isn't meant to last forever, nor does it need to. If someone _else_ eats the food, it usually leads to an argument despite the absurdity.

If the food is in the form of an animal that has to be eaten, that belongs to its own trope. Subtrope of Companion Cube. Compare Adopt the Food, Anthropomorphic Food, Animate Inanimate Object, It Came from the Fridge.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In one festival chapter of _Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun_, Sakura jokingly offers Nozaki a bite from her candied apple, at that point having given up expecting anything romantic from him. Nozaki, being Nozaki, nonchalantly takes a bite. Cue Sakura going redder than the apple. The fanbook and a conversation with Hori later in the manga state that she ended up keeping that apple.

    Comic Strips 

-   Happens at least twice with Bucky in _Get Fuzzy_. In one minor storyline, Bucky is gifted an entire large dead fish to eat by Rob as a reward for helping to fix Satchel's watch, only for Bucky to end up deciding to treat the dead fish as a pet that he even names Smell before Rob eventually is forced to throw it into the trash to get rid of the stench. And in a second three-strip storyline, Bucky is gifted a dead conger eel to eat for unexplained reasons that he ends up treating as a pet just like he did 'Smell' before eventually being forced to give up the eel as well for similar stench based reasons.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Bao_ is about a middle-aged Chinese-American woman taking care of an animated dumpling as though he were her son. When the son starts outgrowing her and brings a very much not Chinese-anything girlfriend home, they get in a fight, culminating in the woman _eating_ the dumpling. Fortunately it was All Just a Dream, and the film ends with her _actual_ human son (though his head does make him look like a dumpling) making up with her.
-   _Ice Age_: Scrat and his acorn-obsession plays with the concept. He will go to the end of the Earth to get his hands on an acorn... but only intends to bury them. Over the course of the series, it goes from being a basic food obsession to being played like a romance plot.
    -   _Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs_: Manny asks Buck when he went mad from being isolated in the dinosaurs' jungle. Buck responds that it was exactly three months ago when he woke up married to an "ugly" pineapple. He claims he loved her anyway.

-   _The Land Before Time_: Littlefoot, a young herbivorous Long-Neck (an apatosaurus) carries around a tree-star, large (to a young child) star-shape green leaf on his back for 2/3rds of the movie as a Security Blanket and Tragic Keepsake of his deceased mother who gave it to him shortly before dying to a T-Rex attack. This is especially notable because the whole movie takes place during a wide-spread drought/famine which sets the course of the plot of whole dinosaur herds migrating in search of the Green Valley, a rumored paradise of food and peace. The leaf remains in largely great condition for the whole movie, in spite of it being worn on top of Littlefoot's back like a cloak as he travels across the land (including through an active volcano!) and used as a blanket by the whole protagonist group at one point... up until the climatic final encounter with the T-Rex where it gets stomped under its foot and torn to shreds in the process of Littlefoot and his companions panicking upon waking up and finding out they're in danger.
-   _Monsters vs. Aliens_: B.O.B. falls in love with a plate of jello, presumably because "she" resembles him, being a blob and all.
