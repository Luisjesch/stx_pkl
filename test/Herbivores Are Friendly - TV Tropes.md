**Lex:** Sh. Sh. Don't let the monsters come over here.  
**Dr. Alan Grant:** They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals. And these are herbivores.  
**Tim:** That means they only eat vegetables, but for you I think they'd make an exception.

This trope, along with Predators Are Mean, are a fairly common approach to Carnivore Confusion in fiction. Basically, all the villains are carnivores and all the herbivores, particularly if they can talk, are heroes.

Like Predators Are Mean, this trope has been around for such a long time that it may be one of The Oldest Ones in the Book. Herbivores Are Friendly often, but not always goes hand-in-hand with Predators Are Mean.

This trope and Predators Are Mean are so strong culturally that people assume that many Real Life predators (whether omnivorous or carnivorous by nature) are mean, evil, and nasty, and all the herbivores are cute, cuddly, and friendly.

This trope is not Truth in Television for the most part. Herbivores may attack a human to claim or defend their territory, protect their children, drive away a potential predator, or just because they’re in a bad mood. Indeed, the most dangerous large mammals in the world are actually big herbivores; the hippopotamus and the elephant are known to attack and kill humans even without being provoked. In North America, more people are killed by cattle each year than by bears, mountain lions, venomous snakes, sharks, and alligators _combined_. In other words, just because an animal won't _eat_ you, doesn't mean it won't _hurt_ you. Conversely, domesticated dogs and cats, both of whom are inclined to be friendly with humans, are inherently carnivorous. Many omnivores, such as the whale shark, are never a threat to humans.

Temple Grandin's book, _Animals in Translation_, explains that domesticated cattle can be a lot harder to handle compared to most felines (wild or domestic, big, small, or medium). A domestic bovine may attack a person in order to exert dominance or protect a calf, but a tiger will not do so unless its prey drive is triggered, as it is a largely solitary animal that, true to nature of all cats, does not care about social hierarchy.

Some herbivores _are_ portrayed as threatening and aggressive on a fairly regular basis. Boars (technically omnivorous), goats, rams, bulls, stallions, rhinoceroses, elephants, hippopotamuses, kangaroos, and gorillas are especially prone to this. When dinosaurs are concerned, you can expect ceratopsians, pachycephalosaurs (technically omnivorous), stegosaurs, and ankylosaurs to also be portrayed this way. On the subject of insects, expect this to be true of bees and moreso termites. Another common exception, when herbivores are depicted as dangerous, is if they get involved in an Animal Stampede.

Goes hand-in-hand with and opposite of Predators Are Mean. Inverted with Xenophobic Herbivore. Often associated with Carnivore Confusion. Subtrope to Good Animals, Evil Animals, Always Lawful Good, and Virtuous Vegetarianism.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Half of the plot points of _Beastars_ is that the populace is convinced of this while also believing Carnivores Are Mean. Though the truth isn't as black and white.
-   _Oumagadoki Doubutsuen_ subverts this trope with Rodeo, the humanoid horse in the Circus Arc: he embraces the theory that Predators Are Mean to the point of petty racism, calling carnivores dumb and brutal and going all out on them: when Kisazou, whom he previously respected as a fellow herbivore, tries to protect Uwabami (a snake-woman), Rodeo doesn't hesitate to mark him as an enemy too.
-   Zigzagged in _Toriko_: most of the dangerous beasts they encounter are carnivorous and highly destructive, though the backstory of the Battle Wolf mentions how a colossal, herbivorous kaiju known as the "Death Gore" nearly destroyed all life on earth due to their insatiable appetite for whole forests. Played straight among the incredibly powerful Eight Kings: non carnivorous ones like Horse King Herakles and the Deer King Sky Deer are the least aggressive of the eight (though by no mean less dangerous...)

    Comic Books 

-   _Atomic Robo_: Zig-zagged in "The Trial of Atomic Robo". Doctor Dinosaur's latest killing machine is the "omnisaur" — half _Triceratops_, half _Ankylosaurus_ and half _Stegosaurus_. Robo points out that those are all herbivores.
    
    **Dr Dinosaur:** Herbivores. What was I thinking? Oh, right! The super-beams!  
    **Robo:** The what? _\[omnisaur starts glowing\]_
    

    Fan Works 

-   Averted with a vengeance in the _Lost World RPG_ retelling of _The Lost World: Jurassic Park_ set in the Amalgam'verse. While the carnivores such as the _Troodon_ and _Carnotaurus_ menace the expedition and BioSyn hunters, the only docile dinosaurs the team meets are all carnivores such as a _Suchomimus_. The most aggressive non-hybrid dinosaur encountered is a _Mamenchisaurus_ the team uses to destroy the hunter camp, during which released _Triceratops_, _Parasaurolophus_, _Stegosaurus_, and _Pachycephalosaurus_ all join in on trampling or attacking anyone they come across in their dash for freedom.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Bad Guys_: Professor Marmalade is introduced as this. In contrast to the rough-natured predator species Bad Guys, Marmalade is an adorable, soft-spoken little guinea pig and also a beloved philanthropist. Subverted; he's revealed to be Evil All Along and far worse than the Bad Guys ever were, willing to steal from children's charities and attempt murder.
-   Inverted in _A Bug's Life_. The protagonists are omnivorous ants (though they're only shown eating plants), and their allies include predators such as a mantis, a ladybug, and a spider. The villains, by contrast, are herbivorous grasshoppers.
-   Another dinosaur example is the movie _Dinosaur_. The main characters are all herbivores, and even the mean herbivore rivals are only trying to accomplish the greater good.
-   The main dinosaur characters from _The Land Before Time_. Chomper the friendly Sharptooth is an exception. In the sequels and TV series, an _Oviraptor_ (an omnivorous dinosaur) named Ruby joins the heroes.
-   In _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_, Snow White quickly gains the sympathy of a large group of Woodland Creatures, who do everything they can to help her. Nearly all of them are herbivores, with the sole exception of a couple of raccoons.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Mothra is among the most peaceful of all kaiju and happens to be a nectar-feeding butterfly/moth. So long as you don't kidnap her fairy companions or harm her children in any way, she won't hurt you. And if you _do_, you'll find that she wrecks cities as well as any Kaiju.
-   A subversion occurs with Godzilla Junior. Though he is shown eating leaves in _Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II_, his species is actually carnivorous. Though, compared to his more aggressive father, he is quite friendly.
-   _Jurassic Park_:
    -   In _Jurassic Park (1993)_, Dr. Grant calms Alex down when she sees nearby _Brachiosaurus_ by reassuring her that they're plant-eaters.
        
        **Tim:** Veggie-sauruses!
        
    -   Inverted in _The Lost World: Jurassic Park_ — Sarah upsets a _Stegosaurus_ and barely escapes with her life. In this case it was justified, as she accidentally frightened their baby and the adults moved to protect their young from a potential threat.
    -   The _Jurassic World_ website lists almost all of its herbivores as having low aggression, with the exception of the armor-plated _Ankylosaurus_, whose aggression is listed as "medium". In fact, across the series as a whole, not a single herbivorous dinosaur— not even the stereotypically "aggressive" ones like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs— has ever been shown killing a human onscreen.
    -   _Jurassic World Dominion_ averts this trope, though mainly not with the dinosaurs. While the carnivorous dinosaurs are a major threat to the heroes, the danger to civilization as a whole actually comes from genetically engineered locusts created by BioSyn, which are devouring food plants around the world. For the aversion on dinosaur side, we have _Therizinosaurus_, which, while herbivorous, kills a deer that gets in its way and actively pursues the human protagonists for no clear discernable reason. Notably, it was the first time a herbivore was Played for Horror in the franchise, no differently from the carnivores.
-   _Tyranno's Claw_ has several dinosaurs, the only ones which _aren't_ hostile being a pachycephalosaurus who attacks in self-defense (where the sole caveman it killed is an Accidental Murder) and the Gentle Giant triceratops who befriends the main cast. Meanwhile, the pterosaur, giant rodent and ape-people tries killing everything in sight, while the film's main threat is a T-Rex.

    Literature 

-   _Ring World_: Averted in practice — the herbivorous Puppeteers are collectively ruthless, paranoid and deceitful, while Pak protectors are xenophobic killing machines who eat nothing but tree roots — but the Kzinti are under the cultural bias that anything that isn't a carnivore is inherently weak, cowardly, and/or stupid; "you don't need brains to sneak up on a leaf!" They've faced many nasty subversions to this expectation throughout the series; Puppeteers, Pak, the "grass giants" on Ringworld, humanity, and so on.
-   _Redwall_ often shows this. Squirrels (technically omnivores, but mostly eat plants), hares, and other herbivores, and a few omnivores such as badgers, mice, and hedgehogs, are the heroes, where wholly carnivorous species such as weasels, stoats, wild cats, snakes, hawks, ferrets, foxes (actually omnivorous, but still predatory), and the like are the villains. This is rather odd considering the fact that the most prominent species, the mice of Redwall, are omnivores but never eat any meat besides fish. One would reason that they never eat any intelligent creatures, but there has been at least one intelligent talking fish in the series.
-   _Prince Roger_: Discussed in _March Upcountry_: Captain Pahner sees a large herbivore on an unfamiliar planet and tells his troops not to fire. Prince Roger shoots the thing anyway, because he has actually been on safari and knows that herbivores are not harmless (and because he hadn't figured out the com software yet and hadn't heard the order).
-   _Dinoverse_: Played around with. In the first set of books, the _Leptoceratopses_ abduct Candayce and shove Janine around, and Candayce figures out that they were trying to protect her — she's in the body of a _Leptoceratops_ and they don't understand why she's hanging out with a _Tyrannosaurus rex_. Similarly, when they encounter a _Triceratops_ herd, it is hostile in defense of its nests, but is less so later, realizing that a little _Leptoceratops_ and a wounded _Quetzalcoatlus_ aren't threats. The _Ankylosaurus_ met later on is friendly to the boy in the _Ankylosaurus_ body, but wary at best of all the others.
-   _Animorphs_: The Hork-Bajir are, when free from Yeerk control, naturally docile and unintelligent creatures who use the numerous blades on their bodies to strip bark from trees for food. A community of Hork-Bajir who escape the Yeerks become close allies of the Animorphs.
-   _Maddrax_: The hydrites are an absolutely peace-loving species of Fish People and vegetarians.
-   Played with in one Choose Your Own Adventure-style book. Your character is a member of the Space Police hunting an outlaw who's captured rare creatures, and the outlaw turns your android partner against you. You have the choice of opening one of two cages- a carnivorous animal or an herbivorous one. If you open the carnivore's cage, you'll be eaten. If you open the herbivore's cage, the android will preemptively attack it, resulting in it fighting back and enabling you to gain the upper hand.
-   _Prehistoria: The Raptor's Tail_: The _Therizinosaurus_ is portrayed as relatively calm and placid around the protagonist, a comparatively tiny species of raptor, because she is no threat to giant herbivore. The male _Deinocheirus_ on the other hand is a hormone addled brute which attacks any animal he feels is intruding on his territory during mating season, going out of his way to charge the protagonist and later fighting the _Therizinosaurus_ when the two run into one another.
-   _Quest for Fire_ plays this straight with the cave bear and giant apes but averts it hard with the aurochs who are just plain nasty. The mammoths are portrayed more complexly: They are easily befriended by the human protagonists because they have no fear of predation but they can be downright lethal if provoked.
-   Inverted with a vengeance in _The Lost Fleet_. The bear-cows are a herbivore race whose fear of predators manifests as omnicidal mania. Meanwhile, the obviously predatory dancers are quite reasonable and more than willing to engage in diplomacy and trade as soon as the translation problems that make both sides come across as oddly patronizing are worked out.
-   _The Dinosaur Lords_: Subverted, the titular dinosaur mounts are most often herbivores (hadrosaurs, parasaurolophus, pachycephalosaurus, etc.), but no less deadly for it. There are some carnivore mounts, and Deinonychus are used in a manner similar to hunting dogs, but they tend to be Awesome, but Impractical.
    -   One such subversion helps kick off the plot: to counter Karyl's otherwise-invincible Triceratops line, Rob sends a herd of Ankylosaurs their way. It's specifically stated that they'll eagerly fight due to being natural competitors for territory and pasture, not to mention being very good at killing each other (triceratops by flipping the ankylosaurs over with their horns, ankylosaurs by smashing the triceratops' legs).

    Live-Action TV 

-   The herbivore dinosaurs in _Terra Nova_ are shown to be playful in the pilot episode. The main character's youngest daughter even feeds them leaves.
-   Spoofed in _Dinosaurs_ as the herbivores are presented as dinosaur versions of hippie pacifists and marijuana users, which becomes a problem when the son Robbie (think Lisa Simpson's version of the series) becomes an herbivore.
-   _Prehistoric Planet_ averts this with the Dreadnoughtus: contrary to the typical portrayal of sauropods in pop culture they're shown engaging in violent, and often _lethal_ combat with one another during the mating season, involving thumb-claw stabbing, neck-smashing and even raking their teeth on each other's throats.
-   Mix with Our Werebeasts Are Different in _Grimm_: all the herbivore-based Wesen like the turtle-like Genio Inocuo and the sheep-like Seelengut are essentially harmless.
-   Inverted in _Dinosapien_. The protagonist is an evolved dromaeosaur, while the antagonists are evolved pachycephalosaurs.
-   In _Primeval_, a Scutosaurus is considered harmless in the first season because he is an herbivore. However, a few episodes later, he tramples and kills some men who attacked him.
-   On _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, Federation President Jaresh-Inyo is a Grazerite, a sentient species descended from herbivores and averse to confrontation. Since The Federation is in the middle of a Space Cold War with the Dominion, Admiral Leyton fears that he won't have what it takes to fight should that cold war heat up.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Some Christian sects in the United States, such as those behind the Creation Museum (Answers in Genesis) believe that this was the literal truth of life on Earth pre-Fall. It's stated that animals before the Fall were friendly herbivores (one diorama depicts a _T. rex_ chomping on pineapples) and that predation and carnivorism, being based in violence and killing, are by-products of the Fall. The Texas-based Creation Evidence Museum believes the pre-Fall atmosphere made creatures live longer, made them more intelligent and thus made them nicer. This has proven contentious, even among creationists.
-   Depending on interpretation, Isaiah 65:25 states that currently carnivorous animals will become herbivores in the Kingdom of God. This is sometimes treated as literal, but more often interpreted as an allegory for warriors or aggressive people having their spirits made more gentle.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _The Unofficial Hollow Knight RPG_ has this in-universe: A character with the Herbivore trait gains a small bonus to their Cute score, making them better at social interactions where they need to appear friendly and non-threatening. This doesn't necessarily mean that the character _is_ friendly or non-threatening, just that they're more readily perceived as such by others than they would be if they ate meat.

    Video Games 

-   Zig-Zagged in the _Monster Hunter_ series. Most herbivores, like Aptonoths, really are friendly and peaceful. However, the Kestodons and Gastodons from _Monster Hunter: World_ or Bullfangos in the rest of the series will attack if you linger near them for too long. And some of the large monsters are herbivores, like Diablos, which is anything but friendly. It subsists on cacti yet is one of the most aggressive monsters introduced in Low Rank, being in fact one of the postgame bosses in its debuting game (as it's found after Final Boss Monoblos).
-   Most of the dinosaurs shown in _Paleo Pines_'s pre-release footage have been herbivores, and they're all easily approachable and willing to help humans. However, the carnivores completely avert Carnivores Are Mean by being just as friendly and approachable to humans.
-   Inverted and played straight in _Dinosaur King_ where while the heroes normally use herbivorous dinosaurs, one exception is a _Carnotaurus_.
-   Subverted in _Dino System_ Unless attacked, most herbivores are usually quite placid and ignore the player. Which can make it all the more surprising during survivor mode when a calm male _Triceratops_ enters breeding condition and suddenly starts trying to kill the human survivor.
-   _Spore_ has creatures evolving. The first two stages (Cell and Creature) are spent deciding on a creature's diet. Later stages have the creatures evolved more, with their own moralities. Herbivores tend to be nice and social, carnivores tend to be hostile, while omnivores tend to be neutral and economic. _Spore_ plays with this somewhat. When you advance to a new stage, you get bonuses and special abilities depending on how you spent the previous ones. Killing and eating your rivals would tend to give you combat bonuses when you acquired sapience, while socializing with other species and eating plants would give you social abilities instead. So if you began your evolution as a carnivore, you were encouraged to develop into a warlike civilization, while herbivores would be encouraged to play peacefully. However, you could defy this by simply not making use of your bonuses in the Tribal and Civilization stages.
-   Subverted in _Far Cry 3_ and _Far Cry 4_. _3_ has water buffalo that generally keep to themselves, but if you walk through their territory, they'll most likely chase you down and try to ram you. _4_ has yaks which are pretty much just reskins of _3_'s water buffalo, as well as rhinos and elephants. The rhinos basically act the same way as the yaks, only they're faster, tougher, and do a lot more damage. The elephants, on the other hand, will not bother you at all unless you attack them — they'll even let you ride them, provided you have the necessary perk. However, once provoked, these elephants are _very_ dangerous — and you can use this to your advantage, pitting them against your enemies and even riding them into battle. Despite the subversion in _Far Cry 3_, the binoculars identify animals as herbivore and predator, giving a clear distinction on which animals can attack. The identification is based on whether or not they're aggressive as opposed to their actual diet (e.g. Buffalo are tagged as predators).
-   Mammoths in _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ are mostly peaceful, just don't annoy them or their giant owners. Otherwise, it's played very straight: bears will attack you on sight; deer (which are covered on Real Life) flee from you on sight. Unless, of course, you have any active buff preventing animals from reacting to your presence.
-   Downplayed with the gurns, druffalo and brontos in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_. They won't attack if they aren't provoked, but they'll fight tooth and nail if wounded.
-   Averted in _Subnautica_. The Ghost Leviathan is _extremely_ aggressive. Turns out, it's a filter-feeder that eats plankton. It's just _that_ territorial. Played straight, literally, with the Sea Emperor.
-   Downplayed in _Don't Starve_; beefalo are aggressive during mating season (when their hindquarters turn red), but otherwise neutral. If you attack one, all beefalo in the area will fight back.
    -   The underground rabbit folk are militantly vegan. If you carry or pick up any meat, fish, or monster meat product or meat-derived foodstuff in their presence, they will attack relentlessly. This includes rabbits you have "befriended" with carrots.
    -   The release of playable Merm character Wurt reveals that Merms are vegetarian. They remain hostile to any players that aren't Wurt, unless Wurt allies with a Merm King, in which case they become neutral.
-   Downplayed in _ARK: Survival Evolved_: while most herbivores don't mind you unless you provoke them, many will fight back once provoked, and _Therizinosaurus_ and _Kentrosaurus_ will attack you just for being too close. Played laughably straight with _Diplodocus_, as its only "attack" is to harmlessly nudge its target, and the Dino Dossier spells out that it's trying to play (even with predators). It doesn't even _have_ an attack stat.
    -   The _Amargasaurus_ of the Lost Island DLC map is actively aggressive, and part of its taming requires you to help it battle its enemies (without becoming one of them!).
-   Zig-Zagged in the _Jurassic Park_ game produced for the Sega Genesis. The first Triceratops you find is peaceful unless you provoke it by firing a weapon in its presence, but other Triceratopses found throughout the levels will generally attack if you get close (some will even automatically try to knock you into Bottomless Pits). Meanwhile, the Brachiosauruses do nothing but provide obstacles you need to get rid of in order to progress.
-   In _Parkasaurus_, putting a vegetable into an egg's last two item slots will give the dinosaur that hatches the friendly trait.
-   In the first _Jurassic World: Evolution_, herbivores are as much a danger to park guests as the carnivores, which might eat a few humans but don't generally mow down crowds of people like an angry triceratops.

    Webcomics 

-   _Kevin & Kell_ likes to subvert this often. Kevin and Kell's daughter is a rabbit that eats meat. Kevin himself is generally friendly, but is not above punching predators trying to eat him. In fact, for a mini-arc it ended up a problem for Kevin as one of predators sued him for "breach of nature, rabbits should run". And was retorted "breach of nature, predators should eat rather than sue". And it should be pointed out that Kevin's ex Angelique, genetically a rabbit (but posing as a rat), is one of the most vicious characters in the comic.
-   Subverted in _Freefall_; Sam's Bizarre Alien Biology is edible and appetizing even to Terran herbivores (he's been attacked by emu and crickets).
-   Parodied in this chapter of _Manly Guys Doing Manly Things_. It depicts a man expecting this to be the case, and getting stomped flat as a result. The page also shows some examples of highly aggressive herbivores in real life, such as the famous park ranger getting chased by a hippopotamus and a bullfighter getting gored.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_: Double-subverted. When Xeno Team is approaching a group of large stick-like alien creatures that appear to be eating moss, Ebbirnoth warns the rest that herbivores can still be dangerous. And then it turns out the big things are actually carnivorous, digging burrowing animals out of the moss.
    
    **Ebby:** Let's just stick with "everything's dangerous until we've killed it."
    
-   Parodied in the _Housepets!_ storyline "Let's Imaginate Jurassic Park". In the "these are herbivores" scene, Olive/Dr Grant turns to the camera and says "Remember kids, herbivores are _not dangerous_ under _any_ circumstances! Ask your local zoo to place hippopotamuses in the petting area!"
-   _Pet Foolery_: Subverted in the strip "Weak", where two hungry dromaeosaurids are trying to pick out a weak target among several peaceful-looking prey dinosaurs, only for every one they look at to reveal huge deadly-looking spikes or horns (one with a carnivore's skull still impaled on them). And this while one of the raptors was still recovering from an Iguanodon recently gouging out one of their eyes.
    
    **Raptor 1:** Okay, how about _that_ one!  
    **Raptor 2:** Yeah! _All alone._ If one of us distracts 'em, the other can attack from behind.  
    _\[the ceratopsian turns to the side, revealing three_ long _and sharp horns\]_  
    **Raptor 1:** Dibs on attacking from behind.  
    **Raptor 2:** I _hate_ being a carnivore.
    

    Web Original 

-   Jurassic Park Horror: Zig Zag. The herbivores are less prone to attack humans than the carnivores but that doesn't mean they are not dangerous.
    -   A group of _Hypsilophodon foxii_ stalks, hunts and devours a park worker.
    -   A _Triceratops_ fatally impales another worker.
    -   The _Stegosaurus_ is played straight. It not only befriends the farmer and his cattle, it also protects them from a pack of _Velociraptors_ that attacks the farm.

    Western Animation 

-   Something was said about this in the _Magic School Bus_ episode where they went back in time and saw dinosaurs.
-   _The Wild Thornberrys_ Zig Zags it. Eliza easily makes friends with plenty of herbivorous animals, but she also encounters some realistically aggressive, such as hippos and water buffalo.
-   _The Simpsons_ often subvert this trope quite realistically.
    -   In "Little Big Mom", Lisa tried to approach a herd of deer because they look harmless, but when she gets close enough they turn ferocious and try to attack her.
    -   Lampshaded in "Four Women and a Manicure" when the Wicked Witch of Snow White mocks a group of cute woodlands critters, most of which are herbivores. The critters proceed to gang up and tear the witch apart as she screams in agony.
    -   Doubly subverted in a school video starring Troy McClure in "Lisa the Vegetarian",<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  where he convinces Bobby<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  that it's okay to eat meat. McClure warns Jimmy that "if a cow had the chance he'd eat you and everyone you care about," as ominous music plays and the camera zooms in on a cow's face. However, the cow's face is so placid, that the idea of a threatening cow seems ludicrous.
    -   In "The Seemingly Never-Ending Story", Lisa's story-within-the-story has her encountering a goat in the forest, hoping it'll be friendly to a fellow herbivore, until it chases her into Mr. Burns' mansion. It turns out it was trying to bring back her necklace which she'd lost in the woods.
    -   In "Simpson Safari", Lisa expresses disbelief at a hippo _eating_ someone, subverting the trope.
-   Marina's best friend in _Saban's Adventures of the Little Mermaid_ is a seahorse (in a setting where all marine predator animals are evil). It should be noted that in reality, seahorses are predators, albeit of microscopic crustaceans and plankton.
-   Both inverted and played straight in _The Lion Guard_ where Beshte the hippopotamus is the sole herbivore of the titular group as the rest are carnivores (Kion the lion, Fuli the cheetah, and Ono the egret) and an omnivore (Bunga the honey badger). Nonetheless, most of the show's villains are carnivores and it's guaranteed there will be villainous omnivores as well, but herbivores are invariably non-malicious and even ones that are _not_ friendly can be reasoned with. Season 3 finally brings in some herbivore villains: the porcupine henchmen of Mama Binturong.
-   _DuckTales_:
    -   The 1987 series has the _Triceratops_ Tootsie. She is the pet of Bubba the Caveduck who is very sweet to most characters she interacts with.
    -   Tootsie is also in the reboot of the previously mentioned show. However, much like Bubba subverting the stereotype that Neanderthals were stupid, this version of Tootsie is a stark aversion to this trope, being very territorial and aggressive. Bubba does ride on her temporarily as a reference to their original relationship, but it's treated more like a cowboy trying to stay on a bucking bull.
-   _Molly of Denali_: Averted in "Culture Clash." Molly and Tooey warn Trini about the danger of a nearby moose before she can assume it's safe to approach just because it's not a carnivore.

    Real Life 

-   Species living in an environment without predators are indeed often very docile. The Dodo of Mauritius evolved on an island without predators and was noted for having no fear or aggression toward humans, who promptly ate them into extinction. Herbivorous species that are accustomed to the presence of predators, however, often avert this: while some herbivores will flee danger as a first resort, others can be very aggressive, and will often be the ones to attack first if threatened or surprised. Herbivores such as hippos, rhinos, bison and even cattle have well-deserved reputations for being dangerous to approach, and even deer can turn on you if you startle them.
-   Ironically one of the few sizable herbivores to largely be this trope to some degree (other than manatees and capybaras) are gorillas, despite being one of the chief exceptions to it in fiction. If not startled, attacked, threatened, or having their children harassed, they largely are docile and ambivalent towards humans and will go about their business. They can still be dangerous if agitated, especially a Silverback with his children or grandchildren in danger, but a majority of the time they much prefer to bluff-charge and scare a threat away than actually fight. Coincidentally, gorillas are also the most herbivorous of the apes and the meat they do eat mostly amounts to a few insects here and there.
-   Capybaras, which are large herbivorous rodents native to South America, are rather friendly and harmless in general. Capybaras are known to allow many different species of animals (except natural predators like jaguars) to rest by or perch on them.
-   Manatees and dugongs are the only marine mammals to be herbivorous. They are also very docile and harmless, to the point of approaching kayakers and scratching their backs on the canoes. Unfortunately, this also led to them getting injured by boats and people.
-   Some species of herbivore play this straight with _each other_, roaming in multi-species herds. Usually this is a sign that their dietary preferences are slightly different (e.g. grass vs. shrubs), and that each species in the group has a different well-developed sense (scent, hearing, sight) with which to detect herd members' mutual predators. Less competition, more chance to pick up on danger that way.
-   This trope is behind the Japanese "Carnivore/Herbivore" slang. "Herbivore" in this case refers to a docile person who plays the passive role in a relationship, though sometimes it's used as a pejorative in the "Extreme Doormat" sense.
-   The wild deer in Nara, Japan are extremely docile around humans and freely roam the streets. There is debate on how far this goes — they could simply be tame around humans, though the generations of interaction may also have bred out their instinct to be skittish around humans. Either way, they will walk right up to people to beg for petting and treats, and some will even bow.
