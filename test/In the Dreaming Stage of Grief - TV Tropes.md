_"Huh? What? What's all this business about a son? I don't have a son! But now that you mention it, I once had a terrible dream... A dream in which some kind of demon child was born."_

Something horrible has happened to Alice. So horrible that she concludes it's just a bad dream. Not because it's too weird or too improbable — it has to be a dream so that she needn't face it once she wakes up in the comfortable and perfectly normal reality.

This is when the Stock Phrase "I'm just dreaming" or its variant means more than "too bad to be true". The character focuses on how every nightmare has its end and hopes that it will go away at any moment and/or that they will wake up safe and sound. If something traumatic happened to a loved one, they may go on to expect that loved one to be around to tell their horrible nightmare to. Either way, the only thing they're "waking up" to is the realization that it actually happened, and nothing can change it.

They may literally look away from reality with an "I Can't Look!" Gesture or in a Troubled Fetal Position. They may even resort to Self-Harm, believing that it's the Dream Emergency Exit or become Laughing Mad. Most likely the first symptom of Heroic BSoD/Villainous Breakdown, except when they have a Freak Out and spend the rest of their life with the "I Reject Your Reality" attitude.

Subtrope of Cope by Pretending. The trope name comes from Five Stages of Grief, in which model this slots into the Denial stage. For when an event is mistaken for a dream because of other reasons, see Weirdness Censor (the event is too strange) and That Was Not a Dream (they slept after it). The Lighter and Softer version of this trope is Bizarre Dream Rationalization. If someone pretends that _someone else_ is dreaming, see Dream Deception.

Not only is it not a dream, but they've also removed Crichton's clothes so he can be examined.

-   This was a popular trope on _The Golden Girls_, and showed up in a few episodes:
    -   In "The Accurate Conception," Blanche's daughter Rebecca wants to be artificially inseminated. Blanche is upset: "I feel like I'm in the middle of some awful dream, yet I know it _can't_ be a dream because there are no boy dancers."
    -   In "Mrs. George Devereaux," Blanche's husband George comes back into her life, having staged his death after his unscrupulous business partner framed him for embezzlement.

    Music 

-   "Jabberwocky" by RedHook, although "trauma" fits better than "grief". The song is about vocalist Emmy Mack's experience being sexually assaulted on tour in 2019.
    
    Wake me up, 'cause this isn't real  
    It's just a bad dream  
    A cave in my chest,  
    Hell freezes in my bloodstream  
    But it's all in my mind  
    'cause I don't believe  
    In this Jabberwocky, Jabberwocky  
    

    Video Games 

-   After the second chapter of _Deltarune_, Noelle and Berdly are always persuaded that their adventure in Cyber World was All Just a Dream, but this trope is played at full effect in the Snowgrave route, where you transform Noelle into a Tyke Bomb and convince her to kill Berdly, who doesn't wake up after the Fountain is sealed as a result. After the trauma she's been exposed to and the horrible things she did, Noelle tries to convince herself even more that it was a dream... but she's still uncomfortable around Kris (despite both of them being childhood friends) and you can push her even harder if they happen to wear her watch in the Light World.

He eventually defies this in his last appearance, which ironically allows him to function long enough to push his ship beyond its limit. He dies in the explosion screaming for someone to tell him it's just a bad dream.
-   _The Stanley Parable_: Discussed in the _Insane_ ending. Stanley wonders if he's dreaming up the whole story, or if it's just him trying to deceive himself into believing he doesn't have to take responsibility for himself.
-   _Stardew Valley_: When you first manage to gain the trust of Leo, a kid who was shipwrecked on a desert island and Raised By Animals, you can ask him how he ended up there.

"SNOWGRAVE" makes the turning point of the Snowgrave route even creepier: while facing Berdly, Noelle is ordered by Kris (who now has a Nightmare Face) to use Snowgrave, which results in an Ominous Visual Glitch, then on Kris hiding a bird corpse (which is only seen on X-ray vision) in the computer room's closet. Still alive but paralyzed, Berdly tries to convince himself it's just a bad dream and that it will be fine when he'll finally wake up.

-   _The Order of the Stick_: In Strip #182, Elan's response to a black dragon pinning him to the ground with his claws and breathing a cone of acid at the rest of the party is to mumble to himself "Gonna wake up any second now."
