_Iguanodon_ paleoart by Douglas Henderson.

The Ornithopoda clade of dinosaurs are some of the most prominent and famous when it comes to the public's eye. The Ornithopods were some of the most successful dinosaurs during their time living out from the Middle Jurassic all the way to the end of the Cretaceous. They were herbivores, as can be judged by studies conducted by palaeontologists.

What is one of the best-known traits of Ornithopods are their general social nature. Generally speaking, ornithopods are rarely found one at a time; rather, it's more typical to find remains of several individuals at the same site. This indicates that they were animals that usually preferred to form groups with one another, mainly as protection.

Naturally, as dinosaurs are a mainstay in popular culture, ornithopods, especially _Hypsilophodon_, _Iguanodon_ and _Parasaurolophus_ tend to be featured in works focusing on Prehistory. To highlight their nature as peaceful herbivores, they will mostly be seen as herd animals, providing protection and social attachments towards each other and being rather protective of them. Additionally, it is also common to see ornithopods join a herd composed of different herbivorous dinosaur species, such as sauropods, ceratopsians, stegosaurs, pachycephalosaurs and ankylosaurs.

Fossil evidence shows that there's a lot of Truth in Television to this picture. One of the "dinosaur renaissance" discoveries of the late 1970s is the hadrosaur _Maiasaura_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , whose discoveries included a giant herd of around ten thousand individuals, all killed in the same event, and a nesting ground with nests spaced about one dinosaur-length apart, indisputable evidence of nesting colonies. One nest preserved evidence that the young stayed in the nest for a while after hatching, while the parents brought them food. The latter discovery is what gave the species its name, which means _Good Mother Lizard_. _Maiasaura_ may be one of the main inspirations for how ornithopods tend to be depicted as sociable and gentle creatures <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Depending on how much fossil evidence is available, this may also overlap with Artistic License – Paleontology.

While not as common as sauropods, ornithopods are still possible to be Domesticated Dinosaurs considering how they are viewed as peaceful animals. This may or may not overlap with Dumb Dinos, though this may be unlikely, considering that ornithopods are normally shown to be very wary about predators.

Sometimes portrayed as a Fantastic Fauna Counterpart to deer and antelope in the dinosaur age.

Compare Gentle Giant Sauropod where sauropods are shown to be docile and friendly. Similarly, compare Herbivores Are Friendly as ornithopods are usually shown to be non-threatening animals in the long-run. Contrast Tough Armored Dinosaur, Headbutting Pachy, and Temper-Ceratops which depict herbivorous dinosaur clades as territorial and brutish, alongside Raptor Attack and Terror-dactyl which serve to portray raptors and pterosaurs by exaggerating their size and/or aggressive nature. Also contrast Prehistoric Monster where every prehistoric animal, regardless of diet, is depicted as a stereotypical monster rather than an actual animal. Aquatic Hadrosaurs can be a subtrope, as hadrosaurs are a kind of ornithopods.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Daikyouryu no Jidai_: Among the sleeping dinosaurs are a mother _Iguanodon_ with her young and a trio of _Edmontosaurus_ (identified as _Trachodon_) huddled together. Later, a pair of _Corythosaurus_ and another trio of _Edmontosaurus_ watch a fight between two _Pachycephalosaurus_.
-   _Dinosaur War Izenborg_ averts this with the villainous _Iguanodon_, _Edmontosaurus_/_Trachodon_ and _Parasaurolophus_, all of which work by themselves.
-   _Seton Academy: Join the Pack!_ has numerous dinosaur species as being school teachers, with the residential ornithopods being _Parasaurolophus_ and _Iguanodon_. The _Parasaurolophus_, much like the other dinosaurs are good-natured residents who devote their time to educate and interact with their students as much as they could, while the _Iguanodon_ is the school doctor taking care of sick or injured students.
-   _You Are Umasou_: The _Maiasaura_ herd is heavily featured with the family being the primary supporting characters, given that they adopted and raised a _Tyrannosaurus rex_ named Heart throughout the first act of the film.

    Art 

-   The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs contain possibly the Ur-Example, with it's _Iguanodon_ paired together, suggesting the social nature.

    Comic Books 

-   In one issue of the _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_, "Escape From Forbidden Valley", Donald gets taken by a hadrosaur who thinks he is her baby. At the end, the Ducks bring back a dinosaur egg that hatches into another hadrosaur, which they keep in Scrooge's zoo.
-   The critically panned _Marville_ comic run features the protagonist Kal-AOL talking to a hadrosaur named Snorts during his time-travel shenanigans. Kal and Snorts talk about how the latter is able to speak with Snorts stating that hadrosaurs have the most elaborate voice boxes in history, which biologically doesn't make any sense.
-   _Xenozoic Tales_: The residential hadrosaur in Earth after some kind of disaster is _Parasaurolophus_. They are referred to in the setting as _Hornbill_ and are regarded as peaceful animals that are usually found in herds.

    Documentaries 

-   _Dinosaur! (1985)_: One of the major focuses on this Christopher Reeve narrated documentary is a family of _Hadrosaurus_ who are trying to take care of their offspring.
-   _Dinosaur Planet_ exclusively takes place in the Cretaceous Period with two of the episodes featuring hadrosaurs. The first one, "Pod's Travels" feature _Rhabdodon_ (identified as _Iguanodon_) as animals that travel in herds as a means of protection against predators, notably _Pyroraptor_ and _Tarascosaurus_. The second one, _Little Das's Hunt_ feature _Maiasaura_ as the main herbivore dinosaur in the show, with juveniles Buck and Blaze having to find a way to reunite with their herd whilst being stalked by a family of _Daspletosaurus_. The episode also features a flock of _Orodromeus_ being hunted by _Troodon_.
-   The first episode of _Life on Our Planet_ shows Maiasaura travelling in herds with thousands of members.
-   _Planet Dinosaur_ details several different dinosaur species and their reaction towards the environment and other species via fossil detail in 6 episodes. Featured ornithopods include _Ouranosaurus_, _Jeholosaurus_, _Edmontosaurus_, _Camptosaurus_ and _Gasparinisaura_. All of the shown ornithopods are shown as being social animals who live in herds. The _Edmontosaurus_ is a notable case as a juvenile is hunted by a pack of _Troodon_ who seek to separate it from its herd. The adults are alerted and drive the _Troodon_ away... but the juvenile dies from injuries inflicted by the _Troodon_, who come back to scavenge on its carcass.
-   In numerous episodes of _Prehistoric Planet_, hadrosaurs make appearances, and in all appearances they are depicted as herd-dwelling animals which care for and travel with their young. Word of God has confirmed the series intentionally show hadrosaurs with young very often on purpose; dinosaurs, unlike mammalian megafauna, have large clutch sizes and therefore many young.
-   _Walking with Dinosaurs_: _Iguanodon_ and _Edmontosaurus_ (identified as _Anatotitian_) are shown in "Giants of the Skies" and "Death of a Dynasty" respectively, being social dinosaurs that travel in groups grazing for food and looking after one another. The fifth episode, "Spirits of the Ice Forest" is centered on a _Leaellynasaura_ clan as they struggle to survive in Late Cretaceous Antarctica, and also shows a herd of _Muttaburrasaurus_ migrating through the area, stalked all the while by an allosaur.
-   _When Dinosaurs Roamed America_: The fifth and last segment of the show features a family of _Tyrannosaurus rex_ attempt to hunt an _Edmontosaurus_ (identified as _Anatotitan_) who are shown living in groups.

    Fan Works 

-   The Geeky Zoologist's reimagining of Jurassic World features _Parasaurolophus_, _Corythosaurus_, _Shantungosaurus_, _Dryosaurus_ and _Hypsilophodon_. All of them are depicted as gregarious, though the herd sizes tend to vary, with the _Dryosaurus_ living in herds of around thirty individuals while the _Shantungosaurus_ live in groups made of a bit more than half a dozen of individuals.
-   All ornithopod dinosaurs (i.e. iguanodonts, hadrosaurs, dryosaurs, etc.) rescued so far in _Prehistoric Park Reimagined_ have been shown living together in herds, often even managing to live in combined herds together alongside non ornithopod herbivorous dinosaurs.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Dinosaur_ is about an _Iguanodon_ named Aladar who, in a very weird case, lives with a group of lemurs throughout his life. After a comet strike that destroys his island, Aladar is forced to travel alongside a struggling herd of different herbivorous dinosaurs that includes ornithopods like _Parasaurolophus_ and _Iguanodon_. The leader is the latter named Kron who, in a stark contrast to Herbivores Are Friendly, is a Social Darwinist who is rather brutish and rigidly authoritative about keeping his herd intact.
-   _Fantasia_: _The Rite of Spring_ segment features several plant-eating dinosaurs grazing peacefully near a water hole before a _Tyrannosaurus rex_ attacks. Among the herbivores shown are hadrosaurs like _Parasaurolophus_, _Anatosaurus_, _Corythosaurus_ and _Kritosaurus_.
-   The token ornithopods in _Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs_ are _Iguanodon_ that travel in herds. However, they are also among the dinosaurs that surround and menace the main cast.
-   _The Land Before Time_ films feature _Bigmouths_ as the representing Ornithopods in the setting. Bigmouths are usually seen in large groups and herds composed of other herbivorous dinosaurs, with Ducky, a _Saurolophus_ and one of the main characters, being a member of the Gang of Seven, a group of seven infant dinosaurs of different species. Out of the Gang, Ducky has the sweetest and most naive personality, filling the role of The Heart.
-   _Speckles: The Tarbosaurus_: As the film is set in Korea with an emphasis on dinosaurs that lived in Asia ("big" emphasis on Asia), the depicted hadrosaur is _Charanosaurus_, a stand-in for _Parasaurolophus_, and _Hypsilophodon_ also makes some appearances now and then, despite the dinosaur having lived in the Early Cretaceous. Both are shown to be living in groups and are seen travelling with surviving herbivorous dinosaurs after a volcanic eruption that destroys their homeland.
-   _We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story_ zigzags this with a _Parasaurolophus_ named Dweeb who's a mindless beast before being reverted into a ditzy animal who's part of the central dinosaur quartet that's composed of Rex the _Tyrannosaurus_, Woog the _Triceratops_ and Elsa the _Pteranodon_.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Jurassic Park_
    -   _Jurassic Park (1993)_: The _Parasaurolophus_ makes its only appearance in the film with a herd drinking at a large water hole alongside the _Brachiosaurus_.
        
        **Alan Grant:** They're moving in herds. They _do_ move in herds.
        
    -   _The Lost World: Jurassic Park_: The _Parasaurolophus_ returns, being shown as a herd of them are being pursued and captured by a hunting team conducted by Roland Tembo, who is working with InGen under Peter Ludlow, who intends to open up a _Jurassic Park_ in San Diego. However, the Parasaurs, alongside an assortment of herbivores are released by an expedition team led by Ian Malcolm and they all tear up the hunters' camp.
    -   _Jurassic Park III_ once again features the _Parasaurolophus_, alongside the _Corythosaurus_. They are incited into a panic when Dr Grant's rescue team attempt to escape from a pack of _Velociraptors_ whose eggs Billy Brennan had stolen.
    -   _Jurassic World_: The _Parasaurolophus_ return again, this time they graze alongside _Stegosaurus_, _Triceratops_, and _Apatosaurus_. However, there is a Funny Background Event in which two Parasaurs fight.
    -   _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ features the _Parasaurolophus_ as among the captive dinosaurs getting released into the world by Maisie Lockwood.
    -   _Jurassic World Dominion_ has _Parasaurolophus_ being rounded up by Owen and company on horseback and are later shown running with wild horses. The film also features _Iguanodon_ living alongside other dinosaurs.
-   _King Kong (2005)_: While only a dead specimen is shown in the film proper, the _Ligocristus_, a species of hadrosaurid that survived to the modern day in Skull Island is given more emphasis in the companion book, _The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island_. It is mentioned that the _Ligocristis_ are defenceless against predators like the _Vastatosaurus rex_ and thus seek safety by being in groups.
-   _The Lost World_ averts this with an _Edmontosaurus_ (identified as _Trachodon_) browsing through a tree all on its own. It displays some aggression when confronted by an _Allosaurus_.
-   _T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous_: _Parasaurolophus_ is the only herbivore shown in the film, in a scene that is very reminiscent to the aforementioned _Jurassic Park_, a herd gathered around a water hole.

    Literature 

-   _Astrosaurs_: Two of the main characters are an anthropomorphized _Corythosaurus_ and _Iguanodon_ who go on space adventures in a crew led by a _Stegosaurus_ concerning some kind of MacGuffin or help. Each of the dinosaurs are friendly and are more than welcome to aid anyone in need.
-   _The Dinosaur Lords_ features several kinds of dinosaurs as battling mounts in a rather _Game of Thrones_\-inspired setting (something actually said by George R. R. Martin). The featured hadrosaurs include _Parasaurolophus_ and _Lambeosaurus_ who are noted to be placid in their general behaviour and thus make for easy mounts.
-   _Dinotopia_: As befitting for a setting that is essentially a dinosaurian Utopia, most of the Herbivores, ornithopods get along splendidly with humans and establish a social community with another. Ornithopods can be seen performing societal tasks such as carriage, receiving and sending messages, providing trade etc.
-   _Gigantosaurus_: One of the major infant dinosaurs in the quartet is a _Parasaurolophus_, who joins along with the other three (_Triceratops_, _Diplodocus_ and _Ankylosaurus_) in search of the titular _Gigantosaurus_.
-   _Jurassic Park_:
    -   Both Isla Nublar and Isla Sorna have living, breathing dinosaurs cloned by InGen. They are initially created and bred in the latter before being taken to the former, where Jurassic Park is to be established for visitors to attend. Isla Nublar is the main setting for the first novel where the featured ornithopods are _Maiasaura_, _Hadrosaurus_, _Othnielia_ and _Hypsilophodon_. As expected, there is a sizable number of the four dinosaurs cloned, indicating that they must have been social animals.
    -   _The Lost World (1995)_, which takes place in Isla Sorna has the aforementioned _Maiasaura_ and _Hyspilophodon_ as native animals alongside the _Parasaurolophus_. They are witnessed by the expedition team and Dodgson's crew to be docile dinosaurs who prefer to live in herds.
-   _The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution_ is a speculative take on how dinosaurs could have evolved had their extinction not taken place. Along these speculated dinosaurs include the following ornithopods:
    -   _Balaclav_ (_Nivesaurus yetiforme_), a mountain-dwelling thescelosaur that lives in small family groups. Its social preference may have something to do with the fact that it lives in a very harsh environment.
    -   _Bricket_ (_Rubusaurus petasus_), a deer-like lambeosaurine hadrosaurid. It lives in small herds and males tend to become territorial during mating seasons.
    -   _Coneater_ (_Strobofagus borealis_), a large species of hypsilophodont. The dinosaur lives in small herds, but are noted to have been social animals, and this is what contributed to the _Coneater's_ success. They were migratory animals, travelling around depending on the season and were adapted to eating cones and tree barks in winter.
    -   _Gwanna_ (_Gryllusaurus flavus_), a kangaroo-like rhabdodontid that was descended from _Muttaburrasaurus_, meaning that the dinosaur lived in Australia. It was stated to live in family groups composed of 5 adults and several infants and juveniles. It is mentioned that while hadrosaurids dominated the rest of the world, Australia was isolated enough for remaining iguanodonts to still persist and flourish there.
    -   _Hanuhan_ (_Grimposaurus pernipes_), a species of hypsilophodont that lives on the mountainside of the Himalayas. It prefers to live in small family groups, given the dangerous environment of the mountainside.
    -   _Sprintosaurs_, antelope-like hadrosaurs that have adapted to live in grasslands, hence adapting new features like a more slender body build for quick speed and agility. They are herd animals that constantly graze throughout the grasslands in medium to large numbers.
-   _Raptor Red_ takes place in Early Cretaceous North America, from the point of view of the titular _Utahraptor_. Iguanodonts (two species are featured: one more definitely based on _Iguanodon_ itself and another, smaller species that lives in the mountains) are regular prey items for her pack, and they behave more or less like large modern mammilain herbivores: running in herds for protection, prone to stampeding when they detect predators, and - taking a page from Cape buffalo - from time to time becoming so enraged by losing a member of their herd that they try to trample and kill the carnivores.
-   _Ten Little Dinosaurs_ has a weird subversion with a _Saurolophus_ playing a baseball game that also happens to insult his umpire the moment his playstyle is not going in his favour.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Land of the Lost (1991)_: The main dinosaur character is Tasha, an infant _Parasaurolophus_ who is taken in by the Porters after her mother was killed by Scarface while she was still in an egg. She comes to see the Porters as her surrogate parents, especially with the youngest, Annie.
-   _The Lost World (2001)_: As in its original source material, a herd of _Iguanodon_ can be seen migrating to a new area to rest and graze at. In an early scene, Malone befriends a _Hypsilophodon_.
-   _Prehistoric Park_ has a herd of _Parasaurolophus_ shown in the final episode "Supercroc". The herd is shown to be docile and close, though they do get started and don't tend to defend others of its kind, especially after one is killed by the titular _Deinosuchus_. While they are shown multiple times, Nigel doesn't make an effort to try bringing them to the present day.

    Video Games 

-   _The Archotek Project_: As a dinosaur Simulator, there are several different dinosaurs, with the listed ornithopoda being _Anatosaurus_, _Hypsilophodon_, _Parasaurolophus_ and _Thescelosaurus_. While they can be seen alone at times, they would normally prefer to be in groups of 4 or more, making them one of the more social animals in the game.
-   _ARK: Survival Evolved_ features several dinosaurs as potential dossier for players to tame, ride and use for their own benefit. Among these dinosaurs are ornithopods such as _Iguanodon_, _Parasaurolophus_ and _Pegomastax_. The former two are docile with players for the most part, with _Parasaurolophus_ being easily tamed. _Pegomastax_ subverts this by being pranksters of sorts and being annoying rather than sociable.
-   The _Carnivores_ series subverts this trope as while _Parasaurolophus_ is an available animal to be hunted, it is always seen alone, just like the other huntable dinosaurs. And add-on from _Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter_ also includes the _Iguanodon_, that likewise acts like a _Parasaurolophus_ does socially, except it can actually kill you, unlike the other herbivores, save for the _Chasmosaurus_. In _Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD_ and _Carnivores: Reborn_, the _Parasaurolophus_ can now kill you.
-   _Dino Run_: Normally subverted as a _Parasaurolophus_ is sometimes seen alone amongst the many dinosaurs that seen once the meteor collision causes an impending "Wall of Doom", though they can provide the player Raptor with a ride. However, it's played straight in the ending of the Very Hard mode of surviving where the difficulty's Sanctuary, an alien spaceship, houses several different dinosaurs, with one of them being a _Parasaurolophus_ family.
-   _Dinosaur Safari_ features the player going back in time to observe and collect photos of several dinosaurs in different time periods. Duck-billed hadrosaurs are common and would usually be seen with a companion or herd, as does a flock of _Hypsilophodon_.
-   _Jurassic Park_:
    -   _Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis_: The herbivorous dinosaurs are listed as having "friends" instead of "preferred prey" like the carnivores. The featured ornithopods, _Dryosaurus_, _Corythosaurus_, _Edmontosaurus_, _Ouranosaurus_ and _Parasaurolophus_ predictably have other ornithopod members or their own species as friends. It is common to see pre-established maps feature these dinosaurs having herds in their exhibits.
    -   _Jurassic World: Evolution_ continues this trend by featuring many ornithopods, most prominently hadrosaurs as animals that are most happy when they are in groups of one another and don't seem to mind the company of other herbivorous dinosaurs as well, even if they come from another location and time period.
-   _Monster Hunter_ features _Aptonoth_, a _Parasaurolophus_\-like herbivore that is one of the most common bestiaries found throughout the series. They are normally seen in small family herds and usually don't mind hunters getting near their presence... until they're attacked.
-   _Prehistoric Isle_: The games subvert any chances of Herbivores Are Friendly by showing the dinosaurs as hostile threats that shoot fireballs. A _Parasaurolophus_ appears in the Sequel that acts no different from any other dinosaur. Some of the dinosaurs, the Parasaurs included may appear in groups, but it still doesn't change their supposedly vicious behaviour in-game.
-   _Saurian_ is set exclusively in the Hell Creek Formation set at the very end of the Cretaceous Period. There are two residing ornithopods in the game; _Thescelosaurus_ and _Edmontosaurus_ (identified in-game as _Anatosaurus_). The _Thescelosaurus_ is sometimes seen either alone or in small flocks whereas the _Anatosaurus_ is one of the most social dinosaurs in the game, with the animal usually being in herds as a means of social communication and as defence, especially for infants and juveniles. When the devs were considering the _Anatosaurus_ as a playable dinosaur, they cited the "herd" aspect as being one of its major elements regarding its gameplay. Sadly, the _Anatosaurus_ lost out to _Ankylosaurus_ and _Anzu_.
-   _World of Warcraft_ has the "Lost Platysaur" as a pet companion that can hang around with the Player Character should they choose to. It's clearly based on the _Saurolophus_, or more specifically, Ducky in _The Land Before Time_.
-   _Zniw Adventure_: Hadrosaurs and small ornithopods are shown living together in societies with each other and other herbivorous dinosaurs.
-   _Zoo Tycoon_: Downplayed with the two included ornithopods in the "Dinosaur Digs" expansion of the first game, _Iguanodon_ and _Lambeosaurus_. While they do prefer being in groups, it's also listed as being in "small family groups" plus they can still lead a comfortable solitary life if the player wills it.

    Web Animation 

-   _Dinosauria_: The third short "A More Ancient Spring" focuses on a mixed herd of hadrosaurs gathering for the breeding season, with a male _Lambeosaurus_' struggle to find a mate after his original partner is killed by a _Gorgosaurus_ taking up most of the plot.

    Western Animation 

-   _64,000,000 Years Ago_, which is set at the end of the Cretaceous Period in North America has an _Edmontosaurus_ herd where the males are competing with one another before going on to mate with the female members. However, a _Tyrannosaurus rex_ interferes.
-   The _Darkwing Duck_ episode "Extinct Possibility" had Darkwing, Gosalyn, and Launchpad going back to the Cretaceous period and encountering _Parasaurolophus_ that live in a city, with some of them having formed a scientific council. They then have to save the hadrosaurs from a _Tyrannosaurus_ biker gang.
-   _Dink, the Little Dinosaur_ features a _Corythosaurus_ named Amber as one of the members of a group of infant dinosaurs in a prehistoric Slice of Life setting. There are other ornithopods including Ariel the _Parasaurolophus_ who once saved Amber from Tyrannor, most of whom get along with the protagonists and prefer a social circle.
-   _Dinotrux_:
    -   Averted _hard_ with the Poundersaurolophus (part-_Parasaurolophus_, part-piledriver), which are not only solitary but extremely aggressive that they pound everything in sight.
    -   The Liftasaurs (part-_Corythosaurus_, part-forklift) play this straight in that they gather in herds, although they are also stubborn and competitive.
    -   Downplayed with Flynt and Fritz the hydrodons who are half-_Iguanodon_, half-fire truck. Despite living alone they're shown to be pretty friendly fellows who don't mind the company of other Trux.
-   In the _DuckTales (1987)_ episode "Dinosaur Ducks", the kids encounter a friendly baby _Hadrosaurus_ that they have to reunite with its mother. The _Hadrosaurus_, however, look more like sauropods with duckbills and crests, although the baby has a short neck. In an unusual subversion of the stereotype, the mother hadrosaur fiercely fights a _Tyrannosaurus rex_ threatening her young (and, by extension, the ducks). Both the mother and baby, however, are shown by themselves and not in a herd.
-   _Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous_ features _Parasaurolophus_ and _Ouranosaurus_ living in herds.
-   _March of the Dinosaurs_ focuses on a herd of _Edmontosaurus_, alongside a _Troodon_ as they make a migratory travel south. The main _Edmontosaurus_ is named Scar, a juvenile who struggles to keep up with his herd and also struggles to find a mate.
-   _Primal (2019)_ has an aversion with a hadrosaur (presumably _Parasaurolophus_) that is not only all on its own but is a vicious and rampaging beast to boot. Though that's probably because the hadrosaur is infected with a plague, turning it zombie-like.
