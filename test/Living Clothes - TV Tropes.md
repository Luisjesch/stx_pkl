_"'We shall complete you! You shall delight in wearing us!' But who is wearing whom?"_

— **Moderately Co-operative Clothes Colony description**, _Fallen London_

They say that Clothes Make the Superman, and every girl's crazy about a Sharp-Dressed Man, but sometimes an Iconic Outfit can literally take on a life of its own. Whether ordinary fabric brought to life by magic, futuristic technology controlled by an advanced AI, or even an actual living creature that looks and functions like an everyday school uniform, Living Clothes are more than just a bold fashion statement: they can think, communicate, and sometimes even act of their own accord.

Compare and contrast Animated Armor, which can act without a wearer but is generally non-sapient. Also compare Live Mink Coat and Feather Boa Constrictor, where more mundane living creatures are pressed into service as clothing. Can overlap with Equippable Ally, if the ally in question turns into an outfit of some kind; and Bio-Armor, if the clothes are a biological organism in themselves.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Berserk_: Guts wears the Berserker Armor, a shape-shifting armor which brings out the savagery in its wearer. If you pay attention, you'll notice that the armor is not just made of armor plate, but consists partly of a second skin which engulfs the wearer kind of like the _Venom_ costume. The armor has seemingly assimilated Guts's Badass Cape, and when the armor's will is dormant the helmet and arm pieces stay dissolved in the cape's fabric. When Guts goes berserk, the armor's dark garment spreads over Guts's skin, while the helmet and arms materialize out of the cape and enclose him. The helmet emerges in a particularly dramatic manner, as the folds of the cape take on the helmet's wolf-like shape and it crawls up from behind to close its jaw over his face.
-   _Doraemon_ have a gadget in the form of a Wind-up Clockwork Key, that can be attached to anything, even _articles of clothing_. At least one Doraemon comic involves Doraemon and Nobita having an impromptu tea-party with a bunch of animated clothes.
-   _Kill la Kill_ has this as its core premise. The student body of Honnouji Academy is empowered by "Goku Uniforms" made from living threads which grant superhuman powers to their wearers. Higher-ranking students are given outfits containing a higher percentage of these Life Fibers; anything beyond 30%, however, and the wearer ends up dominated completely by the (with the exception of Senketsu, homicidal) will of their own outfit. Kamui are the most powerful uniforms, made of 100% Life Fibers and capable of displaying full sapience; however, they can only be worn by someone who can "synchronize" with them - or dominate them through sheer force of will. It also turns out that most of the clothing in the world has been secretly infused with Life Fibers in a sinister bid for global domination.
-   _Prétear_ is a Magical Girl series starring seven guardians with different elemental powers. When someone merges with their Pretear, the Pretear's essence enters her, while his body becomes her Mini Dress Of Power. When the newest Pretear, Himeno, is told this after her first merging, she blushes bright red.
-   _Undead Unluck_: Clothes is a UMA (a being the represents the world's rules) that embodies clothing, making it a living garment that takes the form of the wearer's desired clothing. It ends up becoming Andy's uniform because it's the only clothing that can survive and regenerate from everything Andy goes through. Which considering Andy constantly subjects himself to dismemberment for his fighting style and strokes of Unluck ranging from magma to meteorites, means a lot.

    Comic Books 

-   A story from silver age in _Action Comics_ had an alien cop and his prisoner both disintegrated by the radiation in a comet passing by their ship. Their will persists past death to animate their clothing and seek people with matching morals to empower and continue their conflict.
-   The archnemesis of _Ambush Bug_ is Argh!Yle!, a sentient sock with a Doctor Doom mask. He hates the Bug because when Argh fell to earth, Irwin Schwab (the man who would become the Bug) left him to die while rescuing what became the Bug's costume suit.
-   Azzarello and Chiang's Doctor Thirteen backup in Tales of the Unexpected featured a pile of superhero costumes attacking the obscure band of characters as a statement about how the company ignores the stranger heroes in favor of big-name heroes that are ultimately nothing but sales icons.
    
    **Doctor Thirteen**: No father wants to see his daughter become a fashion victim.
    
-   The supersuit from _Empowered_ has a personality of its own, a fact which only Demonwolf knows. As Emp is unable to use any of the suit's powers if she's wearing anything over it, and finds the panty lines from underwear even more embarrassing than just wearing the suit alone, Demonwolf notes that Emp will likely not take it well if she ever finds out.
-   In the _Invader Zim_ comic continuation, Zim makes an alliance with the Space Pants, a species of Puppeteer Parasites, who take over the city. This was originally going to be an episode of the series, but it was canned for being too similar to the _Jimmy Neutron_ episode listed in Western Animation below.
-   Tony Stark, _The Invincible Iron Man_, has on more than one occasion created an AI-controlled suit that could think for itself. They almost invariably either turn evil or fall obsessively in love with him.
-   _Judge Dredd_ was issued a new uniform for on-street evaluation that came with an onboard AI that could detect criminals more easily and act as a sort of Powered Armor. However, the fashion designer who created the uniform gave it a personality similar to his own and began executing perps for "crimes against fashion." When Dredd disagreed with this, the uniform removed itself from Dredd's body and went on a rampage until Dredd was able to bring it down.
-   In _Justice League of America_ #35, the Demons Three bring to life the costumes of four of the JLA's enemies (Doctor Polaris, Killer Moth, the Mask and the Pied Piper) and use the animated costumes in an attempt to free themselves.
-   Martian Manhunter and Miss Martian's clothes are actually organic creatures that respond to their thoughts, which explains why they shapeshift with them.
-   In _PS238,_ Cecil's trench coat comes to life after being Touched by Vorlons. Most notably, it can reshape itself into wings and allow him to fly; it also has some vague personality and can play video games better than he can.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Secret Wars (1984)_, Spider-Man gets an all-black costume to replace his red-and-blue one, which has been destroyed. The first indication that it's not _just_ a costume is that it actually responds to his thoughts. As it turns out, none of the other heroes who also got replacement costumes from the dispenser experienced the same phenomenon - Peter Parker's suit, and his alone, is actually an alien symbiote (which eventually takes on Eddie Brock as its host and becomes Venom).
-   One Bronze Age Superman story had the Man Of Steel dealing with his entire Clark Kent disguise having a life of its own. He finds out that he passed through a cloud in space consisting of microscopic sentient beings that got attached to his clothing and he ends up taking them home.
-   The first issue of the _Roger Rabbit_ comic books featured as a villain a sentient set of "fancy pants," which talked like a gangster most of the time but got eloquent when wishing it would meet a pair of "female pants" to end its loneliness. This was pretty much par for the course.

    -   Spawn's suit and the source of his powers is a living demonic symbiote called Leetha of the 7th House of K, or K7-Leetha.

    Fan Works 

-   _Later, Traitor_: Maloof's mental world is a big city run by a mafia that works for him. These mafia members are all animate suits with nobody wearing them. According to Word of God, this is representative of the fact that Maloof internally dehumanizes people because everyone he knows is either a jerk or works for his parents, so they're not important to him. This dehumanization extends to his bodyguard Mikhail because Maloof sees Mikhail as a tool to get back at his tormentors with and not as a person.
-   In _Of Quirks and Magic_, Izuku gets his own Cloak of Levitation from Dr. Strange. It's as feisty and intelligent as Strange's, but also affectionate towards its owner when it isn't bickering with him over their shared mistakes.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfic _A Route Obscure and Lonely_, Spike enters Rarity's dream and finds is populated with dancing clothes. They try to prevent Spike from passing by entangling him, then they get more violent when he finds the key that can wake up Rarity.

-   The Cloak of Levitation from _Doctor Strange (2016)_ is sentient and can move completely separately from its owner.

-   The movie _Legend (1985)_ had a dancing (and possibly evil) dress. When the princess danced with it she ended up wearing it.
-   The film version of _My Favorite Martian_ introduces Zoot Suit, an anthropomorphic talking suit that belongs to Marvin.
-   _Slaxx_ is a Horror Comedy about a pair of killer, possessed jeans, so naturally, there's a scene of them doing this when they hear Shruti listening to Bollywood music. It's actually plot-relevant, as it foreshadows that the ghost possessing the pants is originally from India and connected to the sweatshop labor that went into making them.
-   _Star Kid_ features Cy, a talking alien battle suit.
-   Judge Doom from _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ captures a squeaky shoe, and uses it to demonstrate the effectiveness of Dip to Eddie Valiant. Though the shoe cannot speak, its expression and piteous squeaking indicate that it is aware of its imminent demise.

In particular the wizards notice a full suit running off, followed by another pair of trousers, chased by a man shouting "I paid seven dollars for you!" Ridcully is astonished by this; he didn't know there was a tailor in the city who'd include a spare pair of pants with a seven dollar suit.

The malevolent Ys choose to excessively tighten and constrict - exactly where a man needs neither tightness nor constriction. Penned by writing team Grant Naylor, this sketch was later adapted for an episode of _Red Dwarf_.

    Tabletop Games

A similar monster is the raiment, which is a set of clothes possessed by the spirit of their deceased previous wearer.

-   In _Fallen London_, Polythreme is a place where everything is alive.

    -   The intended function of the Y-17 trauma override harness was autonomous casualty recovery, physically walking for its operator should he become incapacitated. Unfortunately, the prototypes had several design flaws: if they don't have a home base, they unpredictably wander; they cannot detect if the occupant is still alive; and they can replicate their users' fighting ability to effect a fighting withdrawal, but lack IFF protocols. Two centuries after the Great War, Y-17 harnesses still wander Big Mountain as mobile coffins.
