_"I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!"_

How do you motivate The Hero to take the call? Why, you endanger their child, of course!

This trope is about a situation when the hero's main motivation for getting into action is to protect their child. The parent is most often the father, and the child is most often the daughter, but some examples do exist of mothers being the hero or a parent trying to rescue a son, they're considered as Gender Inverted Examples.

The father is question is always Papa Wolf, but while being one can be a trait of any character, regardless of his place in the story, this trope is about the situation where his attempts to rescue his endangered ward are the main driving point of the plot. In other words, Papa Wolf is a character trope, while Father's Quest is a plot type trope.

Also this trope applies in cases where the parent became separated from their child due to accident, circumstance, divorce, imprisonment, or similar; not _necessarily_ a villain need be involved.

A usually Always Male trope, sub-trope of Roaring Rampage of Rescue, Papa Wolf, I Will Find You. Searching for the Lost Relative often overlaps, as commonly, the location of the child is unknown. Missing Child may be one of the causes. Compare I Have Your Wife. Contrast Parents in Distress, where it's the _father_ who needs rescuing.

See also Badass and Child Duo for another plot trope involving lots of action and a child (who's not necessarily the badass' child).
