_"When Judas, who betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 'I have sinned,' he said, 'for I have betrayed innocent blood.' 'What is that to us?' they replied. 'That's your responsibility.' So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself."_

Sometimes, after a traitor makes their Face–Heel Turn, they might, after some time, regret their treachery. The reasons for this may be that things didn't quite go according to plan, they realized that Being Evil Sucks, they were Forced into Evil, Trapped in Villainy, or maybe fate forced them to betray their allies. Whatever the cause, a Regretful Traitor is likely to apologize later on or in rare cases, even ask for forgiveness from their former allies. However, their former allies may not be ready to forgive them so soon.

Compare with Heel–Face Door-Slam, where a villain regrets the wrong they've done, but it's too late for reform. Related to Heel–Face Turn, where a villain (though not necessarily a traitor) joins the good side. Subtrope of Heel Realization and My God, What Have I Done?.

Due to this trope dealing with traitors, be wary of unmarked spoilers.

-   Homura Akemi from _Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion_.

-   _Wonder Woman_:

    Fan Works

-   _All For Luz_ Deconstruction. Riley Stewardson is a teenage mercenary with a Dark and Troubled Past who was forced into working for a Corrupt Church that employs teenage superpower mercenaries. She reunites with her little cousin Luz, whom she generally loves. Then Riley learns that one of the bounties of who she has to kill is her cousin Luz. Riley is heartbroken and horrified by the fact that she has to kill her little cousin but ultimately decides to do the deed; she justifies it by saying that if she doesn't do it, she'll eventually be killed, and Luz will eventually be killed by someone else. While Riley is generally regretful and wants to make at least sure that Luz's mother, Camila Noceda, is spared, she does ultimately betray her cousin in an attempt to kill her, and no amount of remorse makes what she did better. It's implied that Riley has been desensitized to all the killing she previously done and is too afraid to do the right thing and protect her cousin. Ultimately, her betrayal of Luz backfires and adds to another one of the traumas Luz experiences, turning her from a Nice Girl into a hardened villain-in-the-making. When Riley realizes what she has done, she's genuinely remorseful and wants to make up for what she did. It's too late, and Luz does not trust her. Luz kills Riley with her own Quirk, and she dies a traitor, remorseful for her actions, but it's too late for her to make things right.

-   Played straight with Seth Rollins.

BoJack was going to threaten to quit if the network moved to fire to Herb, but the network executives talked/bribed BoJack into standing aside as Herb was fired. BoJack was quite reluctant to do this, but not so reluctant that he didn't do it, and while he had plenty of regrets, it didn't stop him from avoiding Herb for the next 20 years, until Herb was on his deathbed. Hence why, when BoJack and Herb finally talk about it all those years later, Herb rejects BoJack's attempt to apologize. Pointing out what else he could have done and why he ended up not doing it.
    
    **BoJack**: You have to believe me. I did everything I could.  
    **Herb**: Yeah? Then why didn't you call me? Huh? Twenty years, you didn't call me. Do you know what it was like for me? I had nobody. Everybody left! I knew all those showbiz phonies would turn on me, sure. But _you?_  
    **BoJack**: It's not my fault you got fired.  
    **Herb**: I don't care about the job! I did fine, I had a good life, but what I needed then was a friend. And you abandoned me. And I will never forgive you for that. Now get the _fuck_ out of my house!  
    \[...\]  
    **Herb:** Know what your problem is? You want to think of yourself as the good guy. Well, I know you better than anyone, and I can tell you that you're not. In fact, you'd probably sleep a lot better at night if you just admitted to yourself that you're a selfish goddamn coward who just takes whatever he wants and doesn't give a _shit_ about who he hurts. That's you. That's BoJack Horseman.  
    **BoJack:** I don't know why I came here.  
    **Herb:** Yeah... _You do_.

    -   Discord in _Twilight's_ _Kingdom_ also fits the bill.
