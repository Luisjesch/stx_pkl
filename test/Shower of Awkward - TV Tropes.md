A common Sitcom and Anime trope in which one character accidentally sees another character, usually of the opposite sex, in the shower. Usually, Bob will turn on the water, then leave the room for a moment. Alice, oblivious to Bob's presence, steps into the water and closes the shower curtain. Bob then returns, finishes stripping down, and opens the curtain back up, so they each get a view of the other naked.

Notably, Alice will never stop to think something along the lines of, "Wait a sec, I never turned on the shower..."

Often, but not always, the two characters have a history of sexual tension. If so, the incident typically leads to either an Unprovoked Pervert Payback or awkwardness and mutual avoidance, until they decide to pretend That Didn't Happen. If not, it's at least a source of Fanservice.

Alternatively, a married person hears the shower running upstairs and assumes that their significant other just needed a shower. As they strip down and open the shower door to surprise them with a Shower of Love, it turns out that it was _not_ their loved one in the shower, but somebody else entirely.

Any time someone contrives to invoke this trope, they're almost guaranteed to catch the wrong person and suffer for it somehow, often by exposure to Fan Disservice. If producers want to keep the show or film's family rating, they will use Censor Suds, Censor Steam, or a Modesty Towel.

A sub-trope of Shower Scene. Related to Accidental Pervert. Distinct from Naked First Impression in that it's limited to bathroom settings and characters who already know each other. Compare Landing in Someone's Bathtub.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: When Matsuri's female Literal Split Personality visits the Ninokuru household, Soga's sister and father try to hook her up with Soga by sending Matsuri into a bath Soga is already occupying. Soga briefly hides underwater, but Matsuri _asks_ to bathe together because she wants to talk. Soga tries to keep focus as the Matsuri explains she doesn't belong in the original Matsuri's home. Then Matsuri asks if she and Soga should marry, and he angrily ejects her from the bath.
-   Czeslaw, being something of a troll, gets the idea to engineer one of these incidents between his two Twice Shy roommates in _Baccano! 1935A - Deep Marble_.
    
    **Czes:** Weeellll, for the next one, I’m thinking about hiding Firo's clothes the next time he takes a shower. Then, while he's looking all over for them, I'll have Ennis take them to him!
    
-   In _A Certain Magical Index_, Touma catches himself before entering the bathroom of Orsola Aquinas's house, as he hears the shower running (lampshading how cliche it would be for him to fall victim to this trope in the process). However, he then tries the door across the hall... which turns out to _also_ be a bathroom. Both Index and Orsola were showering, and he walks in on Orsola. He further lampshades that he could have avoided all this if he had just thought to _knock_.
-   In _Chrono Crusade_, Rosette chases the Elder out of the girl's showers... completely forgetting that she's naked. Chrono happens to be standing outside of the room at the time, which leads to the following exchange:
    
    **Rosette:** _\[not noticing Chrono at first\]_ Can't let my guard down for a second!  
    **Chrono:** _What_ guard?  
    **Rosette:** You can't come in here, either!  
    **Chrono:** I was just waiting outside!  
    _\[Rosette punches Chrono\]_
    
-   In _Code Geass_, it happens _twice_ to Kallen (who is surprised?). First, with a Lelouch nice enough to try to look away. Second, a Waterfall Shower spotted by Suzaku. Oh, Kallen, it will be quicker finding the shower tropes you _didn't_ fulfill.
-   Happened in _Digimon Adventure_. Tai and Izzy rush into a room to save Mimi who has just been carried off. Sora notices Mimi's dress on the floor and calls for them not to go in there. Naturally, they catch Mimi in the bath and get hit with various bath oil bottles.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Happens a few times in _Dragon Ball_, most famously with Yamcha seeing Bulma.
    -   Happens again in _Dragon Ball Super_ when Goku kept bugging Bulma to get him to train with Vegeta, the last time after she got out of the shower. Then when he accidentally teleported to her home when she got out of the shower.
-   Subverted in _Durarara!!_ when Shinra tries to invoke this on his girlfriend and instead gets the perfect view of his _father's_ naked ass. He is not pleased.
    
    **Celty:** What's wrong?  
    **Shinra:** I have seen the face of hell.  
    **Celty:** Huh? The face of what?  
    **Shinra:** Don't make me talk about it! _I just want to forget!!!_
    
-   In _Fairy Tail_, Gray is searching for Lucy in her house, decides that she might be taking a bath, and imagines a scenario in which he bursts into the bathroom, and Lucy, clad only in a towel, slaps him and accuses him of being a pervert. He then tells himself that it was bound to happen eventually and does it anyway, but not only Lucy isn't there, but Natsu is also in the bathtub.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi_, with the Official Couple. It _was_ an accident, really!
-   This is how Ichika finds out Charlotte's true gender in _Infinite Stratos_.
-   In the manga _Memory of Red_ of _K_, Mikoto is taking a shower. He then spots Anna peeking through the doorway and innocently trying to record it on camera. Mikoto throws her out.
-   After coming to the wrong conclusion that Yasuna bathed with Hazumu in _Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl_, Tomari _drags_ Hazumu to her house, throws her in the bathtub and then enter the bathroom a few moments later, in only a towel, wishing to bathe with her. Obviously, after learning what happens, embarrassment ensues.
-   In _Kekkaishi_, Yoshimori gets an eyeful of Tokine taking a bath when he is skulking around her house looking for her because he has not seen her in three days. He feels really bad about it afterwards — so much so that he began to avoid her, making her think that he was mad at her. They patch it up fairly quickly, but it prompts her to "rely" on him more. In other words, this is when she starts to go after him. So, boys and girls, stalk and peek at girls you like — it will help apparently.
-   _Mazinger Z_: At the beginning of the _Mazinger Z vs Great General of Darkness_ movie, Kouji went to the bathroom and he walked in on Sayaka right when she was taking a shower. She slapped him right away.
-   Occasionally in _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_, Lucia will happen to walk in on Kaito in the shower. Partial subversion in that he doesn't get angry about it.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Often happens to Negi with regards to his female students. Awkward for him anyway; the girls usually don't have much problem with it (some out of shamelessness, others simply because he's ten, and at that age, mixed-gender bathing is not unusual in Japan).
    -   Negi also causes an awkward shower situation when he attempts to do Asuna a favor by enchanting her brushes. She isn't appreciative.
    -   Chisame once gets an eyeful of the very manly Rakan while he is showering under a waterfall, much to the likely horror of the fanboys.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_:
    -   Episode 5 of the anime has Shinji dropping off stuff at Rei's apartment when a naked-except-for-a-towel Rei steps out of the shower. Shinji trips and falls on top of her, his hand landing on her naked breast. Her reaction? Calmly asking him to get off, one of the first clues that Rei isn't normal.
    -   Happens again with Kaworu in the manga, who sees no problem with walking into Shinji's shower stall and borrowing his soap. And wonders why Shinji gets all flustered when he does so. This is, again, a big clue that Kaworu is also not normal. This happens in the anime as well. Here, Shinji just cringes. In the manga, he punches Kaworu in the face and tells him to get out.
-   _No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!_: Tomoki walks in on Yoshida showering at his house in chapter 168. Neither has any idea what the other is doing there.
-   A gender-flipped version occurs in _Otomen_ when Ryo (girl) walks in on a very naked Asuka (guy) in the bathroom. _He_ freaks out, _she_ doesn't even seem to notice.
-   Ryo in _Penguin Revolution_ keeps accidentally catching Yukari bathing or changing clothes, and usually gets things thrown at his head when he does. Ayaori also tends to wander into the bathroom while Yukari is bathing, but since he's Blind Without 'Em, it takes him six manga volumes (and, finally, actually having his contacts in at the right time) to realize that Yukari's not a boy.
-   The first chapter of _Ranma ½_ gives Akane a Naked First Impression of boy Ranma, after he changes from girl form in the bath, and she steps in assuming it was empty. Since Akane has only seen Ranma's girl form, she quietly steps out, gets dressed, then runs scream to find some implement to attack him with.
-   _Skip Beat!_ has Kyouko and Ren spend the first night in their roles as the Heel siblings in a hotel room. Since Ren's taking a long time with his shower and bath, Kyouko assumes that 'her big brother' Ren has fallen asleep in the tub and storms in, pulling back the curtain to scold him. And Ren's still in the middle of showering.
-   Double Subverted in _Toradora!_: Ryuuji walks in on Ami in the shower while she's behind the curtain. When he tries to run away, she stops him and tells him to stay. As he gets flustered, she pulls the curtain aside... only to reveal that she's fully clothed and did it to mess with his head. Ryuuji flees the scene unable to speak due to embarrassment. Eventually, he gets Taiga to fight this battle for him, only Ami actually _is_ showering by the time Taiga confronts her.
    
    **Taiga:** _\[barges in\]_ Hey stupid chihua—  
    **Ami:** **WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!**  
    _\[beat\]_  
    _\[Taiga returns to Ryuuji\]_  
    **Taiga:** _\[with a large slap print on her face\]_ She actually _was_ showering...
    
-   In _The Wallflower_ Sunako seeing Kyouhei in the shower (while she is naked in preparation for _her own_ shower) is the event which inspires her to plan to kill him.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Dennis the Menace_: Dennis Mitchell has walked in on his mother in the bath several times. While this is awkward for his mother, Dennis is solely concerned with whatever matter he barged into the bathroom to discuss and this is more to do with him having no sense of privacy.

-   The _Power Rangers S.P.D._ fic "Facing the Past" features a scene where Bridge is fixing the sink in Z and Syd's room and Z comes out after taking a shower, with the result that Bridge sees her naked before he can turn around or Z can grab a towel. While discussing the incident with Syd, Z learns that Syd has had similar moments with Sky (Syd musing that the bathrooms must be basically soundproof as nobody can hear anything going on in them from outside), although in that case, Syd is less embarrassed as she and Sky are dating, allowing Syd to teasingly confirm that she's sure Bridge "enjoyed the view" of Z just as much as Sky enjoyed his own view of her.
-   In Chapter 29 of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, Ash finds a rather secluded waterfall and decides to wash himself under it.

-   In Chapter 24 of _There and Back Again_, Jon accidentally stumbles upon Sansa taking a bath while warging into his pet direwolf Ghost and ends up Distracted by the Sexy for a bit before snapping out of it when Sansa (who's taking care of Ghost in Jon's absence) notices "Ghost" behaving oddly. Suffice it to say, he feels incredibly embarrassed and ashamed of himself for feeling desirous of his cousin, who was previously raised as his half-sister and had suffered a great deal of abuse at the hands of horrible and exploitative men in their previous life.

    Film — Live-Action

-   Steve Hardman's attempt at Shower of Love with his foreign language teacher Mona Lott turns into this in _Loose Screws_ when he misinterprets what she said in French — to the effect of "I'm in the shower, I'll be out in a minute" — as "I'm in the shower, won't you come join me?" and proceeds to strip down and enter into the shower with her, scaring her and sending him running to the door.
-   A downplayed example in _Piggy (2022)_. Sara appears more annoyed than embarrassed at being seen naked when her mother interrupts her shower. She makes no effort to cover herself.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _21 Jump Street:_ Police officer Judy, while transporting an arrested woman on a multi-day trip, takes a shower in the motel they stay in. When she opens the shower curtains after ending the shower, she finds a gun pointed in her face by another suspect that was still on the loose and that she had no idea was following her; she screams out in terror. This is an inversion in the sense that Judy is so much terrified by the gun pointed in her face, that that totally overwhelms any concerns she might have about being seen naked; while the perpetrator who points the gun at her (the moral of the episode is that some perpetrators actually have a heart of gold), reacts embarrassed/regretful that he has to overpower her when she's naked, and came prepared with a towel which he first hands to her saying "Put this on".
-   Beverly Hills, 90210: David walks in on his step-sister Kelly during her shower and sees her naked, to her horror.

To prove his story, David describes a mole somewhere on Kelly's body, to which Steve reacts shocked: "O my God, you _did_ see her naked".

    -   Phoebe walks in on Piper and Leo in the shower together just after they get married. The incident convinces Piper it's time for the couple to move out. A flashback episode where Phoebe and Paige get sent back in time has the same scene reused only with present Phoebe walking in this time.
    -   In a downplayed example (because it doesn't actually happen in a shower itself): when a very minor earthquake happens (note this takes place in San Francisco and the sisters have lived there all their lives, so they should have some knowledge on how to handle these), Phoebe, who was taking a shower at the time, freaks out so over-exaggeratedly that she runs naked out of the shower into the house. When her sisters later make fun of her because of her freak-out and how that made her run around naked, she retorts with:
        
        **Phoebe:** Hey, _I was wearing slippers!_

Notably, Joey's father is completely unfazed.
    -   Joey comes home from a fishing trip absolutely filthy and smelling terrible but falls asleep before he can shower. He then oversleeps and has to rush to work the next day still filthy. He ends up sneaking into Charlton Heston's dressing room to use the shower, only for Heston to come back and catch him mid-shower.
        
        **Charlton Heston:** Put some pants on kid so I can _kick your butt_.

-   _Grey's Anatomy_:

-   _Home and Away_: Happened repeatedly, at least three or four times in Irene's house.
-   _Hope & Faith_: The title characters, trying to disinfect Hope's daughter Sydney's pierced tongue, head into the shower with her, dressed, so as not to spill hydrogen peroxide on the rug.

-   _Kyle XY_: Kyle walks in on Jessie shortly after she moves in with the Tragers. Jessie responds with exactly the level of embarrassment you'd expect — that is, absolutely none. Kyle, on the other hand...
-   _Living Single_: After moving in with the girls after a fight with Kyle, Overton accidentally walks in on a naked Khadijah in the shower. Regine, who did _not_ want him to move it, considered it karma, especially since he was then becoming a nuisance. _Then_ he accidentally sees Max naked due to her undressing with the window shade up while in her apartment.
-   _Lost_: Has a scene shortly after the hatch is discovered where Jack comes upon Kate in the shower. Although he doesn't see anything, it's still an extremely awkward moment between them.
    -   Earlier, there was a horse bath of awkward when Michael stumbled onto Sun in the woods. It was immensely awkward for both of them and Michael apologised and left immediately, but considering how much of a Crazy Jealous Guy Sun's husband had been up to that point, especially towards Michael, they were both genuinely scared.
-   _Mork & Mindy_: In an episode where Mindy forced to host a gossip show, Mork tries to help out with compromising gossip of his personal friends, including an embarrassing photo of Mindy in the shower with a shower cap, and then hilariously similar one with Mr. Bickley in the same position with the same cap!
-   _Mr. Robot_: Elliot walks in on fellow hacker Darlene, who has broken into his apartment and is taking a shower. This seems only slightly awkward until it is later revealed that she's his sister.
-   _The Nanny_: Fran accidentally catches Mr. Sheffield in the shower. Later in the series, this comes back a Brick Joke (and from the other characters' perspective as a Noodle Incident<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> ), by Fran mentioning that she has seen her boss naked once.
-   _The New Adventures of Beans Baxter_: The opening scene of "There's No Place Like Omsk" has Beans catching Soviet defector Svetlana (played by Miss Universe Shawn Weatherly) in the shower.
-   _Seinfeld_: Jerry's girlfriend walks in on George after he's been swimming, which horrifies George because he had just climbed out of a cold pool. George spends the rest of the episode contriving excuses to walk in on her naked to even the score.
-   _Passions_: Sheridan gets an eyeful of a naked Luis when he comes out of the shower wearing only a smile and a few beads of water.
-   _Personal Taste_: Gae In, intending to take a wash of her own, accidentally walks in on Jin Ho as he leaves the shower. Her excuse is that, since she doesn’t have her glasses or contacts on, she can’t see anything. (Jin Ho later overhears her saying that even though she didn’t have them on, she "saw everything.")
-   _Pretty Little Liars_: Used this trope in season 1 in order to build up sexual tension between Caleb and Hanna. He is secretly crashing at her place after his foster parents gave him the boot. While he is taking a shower she walks into the room in order to fix her make up. She is then forced to step into the shower, while naked Caleb is there, when _her mother_ walks into the room. Romance Ensues by the end of the episode, soon to b followed by more.
-   _Reba_: Reba, in her eagerness to relax, is too immersed in her easy-listening music to notice that her ex-husband was using her shower equipment at the time as she prepares for her own shower. The result only stressed her out more, as she told him: "I'm under strict order to keep my stress to the minimum, AND YOU'RE NOT HELPING ONE BIT!"
-   _Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place_: Johnny's does various attempts to walk in on Sharon in the shower. Unfortunately, he gets Ashley the first and Pete's grandpa the second time.
-   _Ugly Betty_: Daniel walks in on the villainous Wilhelmina thinking it's his love interest. Turns out that they're sisters.
-   _Who's the Boss?_: In an early episode, Tony catches Angela coming out of the shower. This helps set up the series' Will They or Won't They? tension. Allegedly, the director had Judith Light flash Tony Danza for real during the taping in order to produce a suitably shocked reaction, making this an example of Enforced Method Acting.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   Subverted when Marita is talking to Krycek in the shower. The characters have history, but they appear to be quite comfortable.
    -   But played straight with Mulder and Scully themselves in "One Son". There's a brief but spectacularly awkward scene when they have to shower to remove possible contagion. Though there seems to be separate showers for each of them, the dividing wall is not particularly useful, privacy-wise, and they both look very uncomfortable with the situation (and try extremely hard not to check each other out).
    -   Given that it's definitely not the first time in the series they'd seen each other naked, the awkwardness probably comes more from the fact that they're both naked at the same time and neither of them was unconscious.
    -   Averted in the episode "Demons", in which Scully finds a naked Mulder trying to warm up in a steaming bathtub, in shock after being drugged and traumatized.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology:
    -   In Greek mythology, Artemis was the goddess of the hunt, and one of her attributes was her chasteness. A mortal hunter named Actaeon happened to see her while she was bathing the woods. Artemis was so furious that she turned him into a stag, and he was run down and torn to pieces by his own dogs.
    -   One version of Tiresias's myth states that he walked on Artemis's half-sister Athena, also a virgin goddess, when she was bathing. Instead of turning him into an animal, Athena blinds Tiresias; once she calms down and realizes not only what she has done but how _she can't undo it_, she gives him massive seers powers as an apology.

    Theatre 

-   _Brighton Beach Memoirs_: Eugene tries to do this with his hot cousin Nora after being coached on the technique by his older brother, but it backfires on him when she accidentally walks in on him using the toilet.

    Video Games 

-   _Death Stranding_. To ensure they won't be overheard, Deadman gets into the shower with Sam Bridges as there are no surveillance devices there. Apart from the inevitable Homoerotic Subtext, it's also awkward because Porter suffers from aphenphosmphobia and Deadman has No Sense of Personal Space.
-   Happens in the first _Deponia_ game, with Rufus walking in on his ex-girlfriend Toni. She seems more annoyed than genuinely upset with the whole thing (a somewhat odd reaction given that Wenzel was looking on the whole time).
-   The _Fatal Frame_ series have this as cutscenes.
    -   _III_: Rei notices someone near the bathroom door while she showers, but the "someone" is _a ghost_, not Miku (her roommate). Fortunately for her, said ghost doesn't harm or kill her, though the experience still leaves her feeling unnerved by it.
    -   _V_: Yuri is bathing in her tub, but is dragged underwater, and then locked in a submerged box with a ghost. She then flings herself awake, realizing it has been All Just a Dream but feeling shaken by the incident all the same.
-   Happens differently to normal in _Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne_, as you might expect when the two people are a cop and an assassin.
-   _Pizza Tower_: Near the top of the tower is a long hallway with a bathtub that Pizzaface is showering in. When Peppino comes close, the two stare at each other in awkward silence for a few seconds before Pizzahead flees to the tower roof.
-   _Solatorobo_ does it _twice_. Modesty Towels prevented those moments from being even more awkward.
    -   Though Red's "What have we here?" line, screen fade to black, and the subsequent red mark on his face suggest perhaps he _stole_ Elh's towel the first time...
    -   And the second time, it was actually a mental "reward" cooked up by his subconscious for beating the warmup level of the Virtual Training Simulation, suggesting perhaps it wasn't quite as awkward on his end...then he gets a Megaton Punch or two and wakes up with a headache, implying some sense of guilt or that he Can't Act Perverted Toward a Love Interest.

    Visual Novels 

-   A very widespread trope in the _Diabolik Lovers_ VN series, to the point that it shows up in _every_ route in the first two games. Occasionally the heroine will walk in while her love interest is bathing, but the other way around is much, much more common. The later VNs mainly reserve it for newly introduced characters.
-   Subverted in _Fate/stay night_ when Shirou walks in on Saber in the bath. _He_ feels really embarrassed for a bit but she tells him to get over it, she doesn't consider herself a girl anyway. Played straight later when Shirou does it _again_, and Saber uses the moment to start wondering if Shirou thinks she looks too muscular and unfeminine for mutual awkwardness.
-   Sara walks in on her brother Suoh in the shower in _Sickness_ and gets a good glimpse at everything. She freaks, while Suoh isn't fazed at all.

    Webcomics 

    Web Videos 

-   Comically foreshadowed in the Cheeky Moon web video Nudie Moonies, which requires a Rube-Goldbergesque series of events and coincidences for two friends to walk in on one another naked, including noise-cancelling headphones, strange minds that think alike, and simultaneous words of warning unheard by one another because they're spoken in impossibly exact unison.

    Western Animation 

-   Done straight on _6teen_ with Jonesy seeing Jen completely naked and freaking out over it because they're _stepsiblings_.
-   In the _Adventure Time_ episode "Marceline's Closet", Finn and Jake end up stuck hiding in Marceline's bedroom closet when Jake ignores her warning to stay out of her house when she's out, and she comes back at the wrong time. At one point Finn tries to sneak out and see what she's doing... which turns out to be taking a shower. He manages to avoid being detected, but it's heavily implied he accidentally saw Marceline naked.
-   Happens in _Code Lyoko_ episode "Uncharted Territory", where Aelita is tricked by Sissi into entering the boys' shower room. We don't know what she saw since it stays an outside shot with just some surprised yells heard. Ulrich and Odd, wet and wearing Modesty Towels, are prompt to get her out.
-   In _The Cramp Twins_, Miss Hissy is temporarily appointed Lucien and Wayne's mother while their real mother is way, and starts making romantic advances towards their dad. She intentionally barges in on Mr. Cramp while he is naked and showering, which terrifies him to the point that he refuses to bathe again until forced to by his boss. Mrs. Cramp comes home just as Miss Hissy is about to do this again.
-   Referenced in _Family Guy_ when Peter and his neighbors win a trophy for a parade float commemorating the _Who's the Boss?_ scene.
-   _Gravity Falls_: In the episode “Summerween,” a couple of kids look around the Mystery Shack since they want Stan to give them some candy. During their search, they accidentally come across Stan while he’s showering. This makes the kids run away in terror.
-   In the _Home Movies_ episode "Shore Leave", Brendon is staying the weekend at Fenton's house and walks in on Fenton's mom in the shower. As he has his camera with him and shooting a movie, he catches the moment on video. Coach McGuirk ends the show trying to put the footage online.
-   On _King of the Hill_, Bobby walks in on his cousin Luanne. A jealous Joseph then keeps trying to do the same.
-   Parodied in _The Simpsons_ when Marge comes upon a decidedly _un-_sexy Burns in the shower.
-   Seen in _SpongeBob SquarePants_.
    -   In _Neptune's Spatula_, the Roman God Neptune attempts to show Spongebob his reward for beating him at a cook off via a magical cloud, which accidentally opens up to Tom Kenny (SpongeBob's real voice actor) showering. As you can guess, he panics when he realizes he's being looked upon.
    -   In _New Digs_, Mr.Krabs enters his office to see that SpongeBob has hung floral print curtains in his office. Upset, he yanks them down to reveal SpongeBob's mother taking a shower only for her husband to walk in and get upset with him and as usual with the cartoon, all hell breaks loose.
-   Downplayed as a Running Gag in the _VeggieTales_ song "Oh, Where Is My Hairbrush", when Larry the Cucumber - having just gotten out of the shower - is singing about how he can't find his hairbrush. Pa Grape, Junior Asparagus and Bob the Tomato both pop in to offer their thoughts, and are "shocked and slightly embarrassed at the sight of Larry in a towel." Finally the Peach enters to resolve the story, also wearing a towel, leaving both him and Larry "shocked and slightly embarrassed at the sight of... each other".
