A pair of young slackers who provide a steady stream of neologistic slang for the youth of today.

May overlap with Those Two Guys and Heterosexual Life-Partners.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Team Rocket from the _Pokémon: The Series_, mainly with their motto.
    
    **Team Rocket**: _"Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again..."_ \*ping\*
    
    -   Of course, this has been lampshaded by now and variations aren't so unusual:
    
    **Jessie & Meowth**: _"Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off again..._" \*ping\*
    
    **James (currently separated from his team-mates)**: _"I could have sworn someone just screamed blasting off again, but we copyrighted that didn't we? Oh well!"_
    
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: "Who the hell do you think we are!?"

    Comic Books 

-   Rob and Don in _Batman: The Dark Knight Returns._

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Wayne and Garth from the _Wayne's World_ sketches on _Saturday Night Live_ and The Movie that followed.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Joey and Chandler from _Friends_, although arguably Chandler spouts the catch phrases and Joey responds merely predictably.
-   Sam and Dean Winchester.
    
    'Bitch.'
    
    'Jerk.'
    

-   _Wheel of Fortune_ host-hostess tandem Pat Sajak and Vanna White usually sign off with some variation of "We'll see you next time." "Bye bye!"
-   Similarly, Chuck Woolery and Stacey Hayes (later Shandi Finessey) of _Lingo_ would sign off with "It's not just letters…" "…it's Lingo."
-   Community: "TROY AND ABED SAY THEIR CATCH PHRASE!"

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Edge and Christian in the WWF, who were later joined by Kurt Angle.
-   3.0, Scott "Jagged" Parker & Shane Matthews, in CHIKARA. BOOYAH!
-   WOW Women of Wrestling had Caged Heat, Loca and Delta Lotta Pain:
    
    **LOCA**: "Whazzup!!"
    
    **DELTA LOTTA PAIN**: "Whazzup!!"
    
    **LOCA**: "Hey, Delta! What time is it?"
    
    **DLP**: "It's Hard Time!"
    
    **LOCA**: "That's right. Caged Heat is about to lay a beatdown on somebody!"
    

    Radio 

-   Radio 1 DJs Mark and Lard were a two-man catchphrase factory, whose comic nonsense was borrowed by other DJs and requested by listeners regardless of context.

    Western Animation 

-   _Beavis And Butthead_: "Huh huh," "That was cool," "This sucks"...
-   Jay and Silent Bob from The View Askewniverse films and _Clerks: The Animated Series_ (though the catchphrase-spouting was limited to Jay, as Silent Bob, as his name implies, is The Voiceless most of the time).
-   Red Hulk and Skaar attempted to become this after quitting Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and starting their own show. Red's catchphrase was "Here's red in your eye!" and Skaar would respond with "Skaar say catchphrase also". (It's implied he was supposed to say a variation of Red's but didn't quite get it.)
-   Regular Show’s Mordecai and Rigby’s “Hmmm. Hmmm.” and “Ooooooooooooooooooooohhhh!!!”
