Now is _not_ a good time, Mother.

**Mrs. Pinderhughes:** What was that noise, dear?  
**Mr. Pinderhughes:** Oh nothing, honey. Just our son Duncan making it with some sexy babe in his room. Boy was she _stacked_! I'm just so proud of him.

Some youngster over the age of understanding takes a friend to whom they might be sexually attracted to their room. At some point, one parent or both will inevitably find some reason to barge in and will do so.

This tends to play out in a couple of different ways:

-   The two are, in fact, in the middle of doing something sexual with each other or just getting started. The parent(s) in question may also be bringing contraceptives (or a baseball bat or a gun) if this was expected, or a very shocked look if it wasn't. Either way, the parent(s) may decide this is a good time (late, but better than never) to give one or both of these misbehaving kids The Talk.
-   The two are actually doing something innocent, like studying or playing board games, and the parent(s) walked in expecting to find that they _were_ making out or worse. With the thoroughly chastened parent(s) subsequently out of the room, one youngster may turn to the other and ask "So, wanna make out?"
    -   Alternatively, though what the couple are doing is indeed innocent, the suspicious parent(s) may _just happen_ to barge in during a Not What It Looks Like moment, often prompting one or both youngsters to say something along the lines of "I Can Explain."

Yujiro, Baki's father, barges in, loudly boasting and ranting that Baki and Kozue should have sex, they should do it as much as they can even if society says the opposite, that Kozue should take pride in leaving Baki always wanting and never be fully consumed by his desire, and that they've got both the duty to give the Hanma's family strong children to surpass the incredible physical prowess of Baki and him. He then goes away, casually telling Baki to get a better lock. The mood utterly spoiled, Kozue and Baki end up making out at a different date, without interlopers in the same room.

-   Bookend to a Primal Scene moment earlier in _We Can't Rewind_, though the youngsters in question were _eight-and-a-half_ and _nine_ and in their parents' bodies at the time; it's complicated.
-   Downplayed example in _Knights of the Borrowed Dark_, when Vivian Hardwick walks in on Denizen kissing Mercy and is horrified, though this is less due to the makeout and more to the fact that Mercy is essentially an other-dimensional demon. Becomes a Brick Joke later when Vivian is missing and Denizen considers attempting to kiss Mercy again in the hopes that she would magically materialise.

    Live-Action TV

-   _Eureka_ - in the third-season finale, Jack and company enter Lucas' garage to find him kissing Zoe. Cue Lucas holding a pillow in front of himself.
-   _Roseanne_:
    -   Played with brilliantly on two episodes. In the first, Roseanne and Jackie come into the dark living room and hear the sound of two kids making out on the couch. Roseanne assumes it's Becky, and decides to turn on the lights to ruin the moment. She turns on the lights...and it's _Darlene_ making out with one of her classmates (Darlene hadn't shown much interest in this previously).
    -   In a later episode, Roseanne tries to do the same thing when she thinks it's Darlene and David making up after a fight - except it's _Beverly_ and one of the guys from the retirement home she lives in.
-   In _That '70s Show_ episode about Jackie's lodge, Kitty and Red walk in on Eric and Donna doing the horizontal tango on the kitchen table. The next scene shows Kitty and Red scrubbing the table furiously to cleanse it, eventually deciding that it would just be best to get a new table.

-   _Forever_: Deliberately averted in-universe by Henry when he starts to enter the living quarters he shares with Abraham above the antique store, but discovers his son Abe and Abe's ex Maureen dancing romantically. Grinning, he turns around and quietly leaves them to it.
-   In a third season episode of _Friday Night Lights_, Coach Taylor walked in on Julie and Matt having sex when the former came to the latters house to pick up Julie to take her home. Unlike most examples of this trope, this wasn't played for laughs, and became the focus of the episode as both Coach and Tami tried to figure out how to talk to Julie and Matt about what happened.
    
    _\[Coach Taylor enters Matt's house to pick up Julie\]_  
    **Coach Taylor:** Jules?  
    _\[shot changes to outside of Matt's house, silent for a few seconds, then a scream is heard\]_  
    **Julie Taylor:** _Ahhhhhh!!!_ Dad!? Get out!!  
    _\[Coach Taylor then walks straight out of the house in blank shock and gets in his SUV\]_
    
-   On _Gilmore Girls_, Luke offers a book to Lorelai and mentions that it's upstairs in his apartment, which is right above the diner. When Lorelai walks in, she comes across Rory and Jess making out on the couch. It's uncomfortable for all three of them. When Lorelai demands an explanation from Luke, he admits that he goes up to the apartment every 10 minutes with flimsy excuses in order to make sure that nothing gets past the kissing stage.
    -   Played straight in a later season, when Lorelai walks in on Rory and Logan during a party at the Gilmore house. This is mortifying for both mother and daughter, made worse by the fact that both Luke and Christopher are determined to kick Logan's ass once they find out. And that Rory is in college and is an adult at the time.
-   The American version of _Shameless_ has a brilliant example where Mickey's homophobic, drunken father, walks straight into Mickey's room to use the bathroom - right past a naked Ian and Mickey post-sex.

(Miguel having pocketed a hand drum while Sam was showing him the drum technique moments earlier)
    
    **Samantha LaRusso:** Look, I'm sorry, Dad. I should've told you that I invited Miguel over.  
    **Daniel LaRusso:** All right, new rule. If you're gonna bring boys over to the dojo, leave the door _open_.  
    **Samantha LaRusso:** Come on, Dad, it's not 1984...  
    **Daniel LaRusso:** Look, you're grown up. You're a young woman now, okay? I get it. I just feel like in this past year there's been Kyler, and Miguel, and Robby, now back to Miguel? Seems like you're adding more drama to your life than you need. And just imagine if Robby knew Miguel was back in the picture. _\[Sam grimaces, and shifts nervously on her feet\]_ Oh no. Sam, really?!  
    **Samantha LaRusso:** ...He came by last night when I was here with Miguel.  
    **Daniel LaRusso:** And he saw you two...\[kissing\]?  
    **Samantha LaRusso:** _\[disgusted\]_ NO! God, Dad!  
    **Daniel LaRusso:** What, I saw it!  
    **Samantha LaRusso:** I know, it's been a lot. But can you _please_ try to remember that I'm still your daughter, and that you can trust me?  
    **Daniel LaRusso:** It's not _you_ I don't trust, Sam.  
    **Samantha LaRusso:** Miguel's changed. He's a good person. He's not Cobra Kai's #1 bully; he's not even in Cobra Kai anymore!

-   _Sisters_. Middle sister Georgie and her husband John walk in on their older son Trevor and his girlfriend in _their_ bed. Already stunned, they are even moreso at his completely matter-of-fact reaction as if this is perfectly normal.

-   _Kate & Allie_: Jennie and her boyfriend Jason are sitting on the fold-out bed in his living room, clearly preparing to take things to the next level when his mother returns home.

-   _Ill Fly Away_. Oldest son Nathan and his girlfriend Diane are caught by her parents.

-   _Knots Landing_:
    -   In the series' very first scene, Sid comes home from work early because of a bad cold and finds his daughter Annie in his and Karen's bed with a random guy.
    -   A variation in Season Eight. In "Brothers and Mothers", Eric walked in on his younger brother Michael cuddling with their stepsister Paige and quickly came to the obvious conclusion. Eric was furious as he thought that it would have an adverse effect on the family, especially Karen and Mack's marriage, and the two of them got into a fistfight.
    -   There was a more straightforward application two episodes later. In "A Turn of Events", Karen entered Michael's room late at night to pick his clothes off the floor and discovered him and Paige in bed together asleep. Or so she thought as it turned out that Paige was only pretending to be asleep.
-   _Special Ops: Lioness_: Joe comes home and finds Kate, her oldest daughter, on the couch making out with a boy whom she then orders to leave. Kate is mortified and tells her off about it.

-   In _Questionable Content_, Faye's sister Mandy came out as lesbian to her mother because of this trope.
    
    **Mandy:** That's when I learned there's no way to remove your face from another girl's crotch in a nonchalant manner.  
    **Marten:** At that point you may as well say "Do you mind? I'm kind of in the middle of something here" and go back to what you were doing, because you know it can't get any worse.
    
-   In _Red String_, Hanae's mother finds out her daughter is a lesbian this way. She doesn't take it well.

Aside from the fact that she's in an _amazingly_ Transparent Closet (and that her parents — already hinted to be a pair of old hippies — are quite tolerant), these flashbacks also suggest that she has a very impressive dating history.

    Web Videos 

-   In this video by sWooZie, two of his friends tried to do....something to him involving ice and one of their mothers walks in on it. He then discusses the trope, wondering why parents only seem to walk in on you when you're doing something scandalous and never something good, while also pointing out that the blame in such situations is on the parents if they simply barge in without getting the ok to enter first.

## Not What It Looks Like

    Advertising

Cue Midori's mother entering the room to see Seiji apparently groping her comatose daughter's bare chest. She faints, Seiji is lucky to escape alive.
-   _My Bride is a Mermaid_: When mermaids get splashed with water, it causes their legs to revert back to being fish tails. Naturally, since Nagasumi's Love Interests (Sun and Lunar) are both mermaids, he has to dry their tails off to turn them back into human form. Unfortunately, it can end up looking rather sexual to anyone who walks in on the act including other mermaids. Coupled with the fact that both Love Interests have very overprotective Boyfriend-Blocking Dads, Hilarity Ensues whenever they do walk in on Nagasumi in the act.
    -   During the Festival Episode, Sun accidentally gets splashed with water, forcing Nagasumi to take her into a secluded area to dry her off without anyone noticing. Unfortunately for them, Sun's parents pass by and do end up noticing them. While Sun's mother is bemused about the fact that "kids these days will do it anywhere", Sun's father naturally goes berserk and attempts to kill Nagasumi, only being stopped once he sees that Nagasumi was merely trying to revert her legs back.
    -   When Lunar accidentally splashes water on herself, she orders Nagasumi to grab a towel and dry her off. Then her Terminator Impersonator of a father (that is not just a description of his character) walks in at the exact moment that she reverts back to her legs, making it look like Nagasumi is grabbing her butt with the towel. As punishment for getting "acquainted" with her daughter, instead of killing him right on the spot (which he wouldn't give a second thought to), he forces him into a Shotgun Wedding.
-   _Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!_ has the Not What It Looks Like variation in episode 4. Mahiro finds out that his mother is coming home (in just under a minute) and quickly attempts to throw Nyarko and Cuko out so she doesn't think that he's the kind of son who invites girls over when his parents are out of town. The girls struggle with him and when mother Yoriko opens the door, she sees Nyarko on her back in the foyer, Mahiro on all fours above her, and Cuko clinging to his back. Thankfully, Yoriko actually listens to her son's explanation and realizes what was going on.
-   In _Ouran High School Host Club_, when the hosts are visiting Haruhi's apartment and are about to be taken by her to the "commoner's supermarket", Tamaki slips on a Banana Peel from nowhere, and falls on top of Haruhi, just as Ryoji Fujioka, aka Ranka, walks in. About a second later, a sign pops up showing that Tamaki instantly understood what her father believed was happening.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_ has a variation. When Tsukune goes back home for a few days, the harem follows him. Moka shows up as the girlfriend. However, the rest of the harem managed to get into his room without his mother noticing. When his mother shows up bringing tea for the two, she ends up seeing a Lover Tug of War.
-   _Seitokai Yakuindomo_ has this happen to Suzu and Takatoshi when they're working on papers for the student council.

-   Subverted on _One Life to Live_. While teen couple Jessica and Christian are indeed making out in the stairwell of his house, that's _**all**_ that they're doing. But despite them being fully dressed and standing, when her father and his mother walk in, both parents fly into a rage as if they had in fact caught them in the act of having sex.
    -   Played straighter in another scene from the same show, Kevin (Jessica's brother, incidentally) and his girlfriend Rachel get together to watch movies and eat junk food. The next morning, their parents walk in on them, having fallen asleep. Once again, the father flies into a rage about their supposedly immoral behavior and all but orders Rachel out of the house (the fact that she's black and Kevin is white adds some major unfortunate implications to his attitude). His mother, thankfully, is much calmer, believing that nothing improper was happening and only being concerned that Rachel's parents don't know where she is.
-   _Any Day Now_. M.E. finds her daughter and her boyfriend Ajoni in bed together. However, out of all four parents, her husband, Kelly's father, is the only one to believe that they were literally only sleeping together (Ajoni had needed someplace to crash after a fight with his parents). Although several months later, when Kelly ends up pregnant, it becomes obvious that they _were_ having sex, just probably not that particular night.

-   _The Beginning After the End_: Shortly before their Class Trip, Arthur attempts to help Tessia integrate the Beast Will that he gave her into her Mana Core. However, the attempt gets derailed by playful teasing between the two of them which leads to Tessia tackling Arthur to the ground. At that moment, Tessia's grandfather Virion walks in on them and remarks that while he wanted them to get closer (Arthur and Tessia are Childhood Friends who have reunited after years of being apart), he didn't expect to be walking into something that he thought was far more intimate. This causes Tessia to realize that she is straddling Arthur in a rather compromising position, causing her to jump off him in embarrassment.
-   _My Daughter Is A Zombie_: Jeonghwan and Yeonhwa (both in their thirties) lie down on the mattress and reminisce about playing in the sheets when they were children. Meow-meow the cat knocks a blanket on top of them and an empty vitamin packet on the floor just as Jeonghwan's mother Bamsoon walks in. Bamsoon tells the two to continue whatever they were doing.
