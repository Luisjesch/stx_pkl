_"Discord may be reformed, but he's not **that** reformed."_

When it comes to characters turning from evil to good, you would assume that their character and personality have changed. This isn't always the case, and the change isn't always complete and these characters still have the same ruthless attitude and behavior.

This trope is when a character goes from evil to good while still retaining the characteristics they had as a villain. There are plenty of reasons for why their immoral or unpleasant behavior remains the same despite changing their alignment:

1.  The reformed character may still harbor some form of resentment or disdain for the good guys, particularly The Hero.
2.  They are still hung on the ways of villainy, and they were very "sour grapes" on joining the heroes. Perhaps they may have been a Well-Intentioned Extremist who's now realized that their actions caused more harm than good, but they still hang on to their ruthless ways as long as it doesn't hurt others, or maybe their evil powers have enlightened them a lot, but they now agree to use it for the greater good instead of their self-serving reasons.
3.  They may be just naturally mean due to some Freudian Excuse or other reason and they will be an example of Good Is Not Nice for years to come.
4.  They are simply all too aware that they can never be a model of Incorruptible Pure Pureness. They'll still play dirty if it comes to that.
5.  They have changed their allegiance and goals without modifying their ruthless hardcore mindset.

Very common in a setting of Black-and-Gray Morality. This type of character is more likely to become The Hero's lancer, especially when the former is an Ideal Hero or The Cape. When it comes to this trope, turning over a new leaf is more complex than people thought it would be, which can invoke the thought that Humans Are Flawed or even bastards. Meta-wise, this can be done for the benefit of viewers who find the character interesting and entertaining as a villain and would get bored out by clear-cut goody guys.

Also see Token Evil Teammate, Combat Pragmatist, Above Good and Evil, Good Is Not Nice, or Vigilante Man. Subtrope of Quirky Good. Compare Hazy-Feel Turn and Heroes' Frontier Step. Not to be confused with Reformed, but Rejected, where a character turns for the better, but others don't acknowledge it.
