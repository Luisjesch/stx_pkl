_"I want to sleep until the pain stops."_

— **Moth Flight**, _Warriors: Moth Flight's Vision_

This character is a Sleepyhead, but it's not a simple quirk. They're in too much mental pain to do anything but sleep. Maybe they've suffered a recent tragedy or maybe they suffer from (often untreated) mental illness, but this character spends a lot of time sleeping. There are also those who use sleeping, or more specifically dreaming, as escapism from their waking stress.

There is Truth in Television to this. A common symptom of several mental illnesses, including clinical depression (and atypical depression in particular), is lethargy and sleepiness.

Angst Coma is a more extreme version of this. Contrast with The Insomniac, who oftentimes are also depressed or otherwise not of sound mind yet have the opposite issue with sleep. Compare to Heroic Safe Mode and Asleep for Days. This trait is often seen in hikikomoris.
