_"A man who doesn't know how to do anything goes to work as a guard. A woman who doesn't know how to do anything goes to work as a prostitute. Both jobs are basically the same thing; sleeping for money."_

A Narrative Device especially common in film and TV, though not limited to them.

This is the job where a once-famous, successful or admired character is "reduced to this!" More dire than a day job, this is a stereotypical last-resort job to which has-beens, people who got fired or laid off from their regular jobs, Impoverished Patricians, or Fallen Heroes have resorted, just to pay the bills. The Fallen on Hard Times Job is often the starting point for a protagonist's Redemption Quest, or attempt to chase after their Lifelong Dream (with accompanying Gonna Fly Now Montage). It can also serve as a recruiting station for a Ragtag Band of Misfits or Putting the Band Back Together. Such jobs include:

-   Party organisers for actors (_Party Down_)
-   Hotel lounge musicians for musicians (_The Blues Brothers_)
-   Being a Street Musician for professional musicians who are laid off.
-   Dinner theater or background work for trained theater actors (_Team America: World Police_, _Soapdish_, _Auto Focus_)
-   Personal-injury work for lawyers (_Erin Brockovich_, _Legal Affairs_)
-   Cheesy ice capades shows for kids for figure skaters (_Blades of Glory_)
-   Circus sideshows for characters with unusual abilities or attributes (_X-Men Origins: Wolverine_)
-   Enforcer, Bouncer, or Dumb Muscle for boxers (_On the Waterfront_, _Daredevil_, _Rocky_)
-   Youth coach for athletes or former professional coach(_The Bad News Bears_)
-   Rent-a-cop or mall security for police or secret agents (_National Security_)
-   Entertaining kids at birthday parties (_Ghostbusters II_)
-   Really any blue collar work (taxi driver, cook, retail, fast food, etc) for various commando/spec ops military officers and immigrants whose merits (university degrees, positions, nobility) in their country are worthless in this country.
-   Ghost-writing or producing Extruded Book Product for down-on-their luck authors.
-   Hosting low-end talk shows for former news anchors or serious journalists
-   Scullery Maid for runaway Fairy Tale Princesses
-   Governess or nanny for Real Life Fallen Princess
-   Stripper, phone-sex operator, prostitute, or other sex worker for a poor single mother.
-   Japandering
-   Appearing on D-List Reality TV shows and/or porn for a washed-up celebrity or Former Child Star.
-   Working at Burger Fool, a Soul-Sucking Retail Job, or some other menial position for people who have A Degree in Useless, or Tragic Dropouts.
-   Primary care, or becoming a Back-Alley Doctor or "wellness practitioner" for doctors who are disbarred or laid off.
-   Giving tours of the family chateau and its grounds for the Impoverished Patrician.
-   Golf instructor, ski instructor or local fitness club tennis coach for former sports pros.
-   Delivery driver for former racecar drivers.

Compare Former Regime Personnel, when a lot of secret policemen, commandos, spies, and similar people end up fallen on hard times at once. They may work as mercenaries or bodyguards. The most common Fallen-on-Hard-Times Job for them is mafia soldier or security mook. Also compare Worthless Foreign Degree, in which highly educated immigrants end up in menial jobs. Contrast Waiting for a Break which is about aspiring actors and film writers doing a day job as a server or barista whilst _attempting_ to make it big. Can lead to a Scrap Heap Hero if the person is called back to duty. See also Loser Protagonist, Acceptable Targets.

-   Andy Kaufman did an extreme parody of this trope in his 1980 appearance on David Letterman's morning show, claiming he was no longer doing _Taxi_, was having trouble even finding work in dinner theater, and had lost everything in a divorce. He ended his "set" by actually _panhandling_ in the front rows of the studio audience before being led out by stagehands. (In truth, while his mainstream career _had_ peaked owing to the backlash against his wrestling Heel persona in particular, he stayed with _Taxi_ through its entire run, and even as his career went into further decline was still able to parlay recognition into smaller gigs — and had he not died in 1984, probably would have found ways to keep doing so and turn it into a whole new phase of his work, as he was fascinated by performers past their peak.)

In later seasons the boys are separated again and Dean works construction, but that might be less of an example since he's a high school dropout who likes working with his hands.

    Miscellaneous, Real Life 

-   In Japanese media, paper-flower vendors are stereotypical emblems of hard times, indicating that someone is one step away from beggary.
-   In 19th- and early 20th-century Europe, the match seller was a stock "hard up" character. It was an especially popular depiction of impoverished WWI veterans, especially the wounded and disabled. Famous examples are _The Little Match Girl_ and Otto Dix's painting _The Match Seller_.
-   During the American Great Depression, hawking pencils or apples was an equally common stock job in media.
-   Nowadays the Traveling Salesman job is seen as this. George Orwell wrote descriptions of such people in his essays of the 1930s and Spike Milligan portrays an encyclopaedia salesman in _Puckoon_.
-   Slowly becoming this in the United States, thanks to the Great Recession, is people being snatched off the street and paid to wave customers into businesses that can't afford other forms of advertisement. "WE BUY GOLD" places do this all the time, and the poor guy or girl usually has to wear a Goofy Suit.
-   Up to WWI, female teacher or lady's companion were synonyms of an impoverished woman of good social standing.
-   Actress Nikki Blonsky started working at a salon after movie roles dried up.
    -   Similarly, Gary Coleman worked as a security guard when his career fizzled out. In fact, it's not all that uncommon for actors to have a second job if they don't have a long-term contract or can't find regular short-time roles.
    -   Following photos of him working at a Trader Joe's going viral in 2018, actor Geoffrey Owens (Elvin on _The Cosby Show_) began getting roles after being "job shamed".
    -   After his career was utterly destroyed by disturbing abuse allegations, Armie Hammer ended up selling timeshares in the Cayman Islands.
-   Louise Brooks was at first a Hollywood star in the '20s and '30s but faded into obscurity in B-movies before quitting acting altogether. At one point among other jobs, she worked as a call girl. She would later enjoy Career Resurrection as a novelist.
-   One specific to recent college grads who can't find work in their degree field is working in coffeeshops. At least, it's seen as this by more "marketable" graduates and by some of the coffee shop workers themselves. Ironically, despite the stereotype that "what the English major says to the business major is 'do you want fries with that'", coffee shops are somewhat more likely to hire graduates than fast-food chains, who consider them overqualified.
-   Colonel Thomas E. Lawrence resigned from the British Army after WWI, but later found civilian life uninspiring. So he joined the Royal Air Force as an ordinary Airman under a pseudonym to get back into the military, even if as an ordinary rating.
-   Jon Gosselin (_Jon & Kate Plus Eight_) now works as a waiter in Pennsylvania.
-   This photo of a Syrian civil war victim selling pens<small>◊</small> while hauling his daughter made the rounds across the world.
-   From the 16th to the 19th century, working on a slave ship was this for contemporary sailors. While their conditions were practically enviable by the captives on the cargo hold, most of the crewmen had to sleep on the exposed top deck, since there was no space below deck. The raw sewage and deceased bodies meant disease was rampant. If the cargo decided they did not want to be cargo anymore, the crew could literally find themselves fighting for their lives. To top it off, employers offered comparatively low pay for dangerous work, or oftentimes stiffed their employees. Once the slaves were sold off to their new masters\]\], most of the crew were told their services were no longer needed and had to sail back their home countries from the Americas.
-   Sadly many wrestlers employed by TNA also had to get second jobs because the company didn't pay them enough or paid them late.
    -   Taylor Wilde was working a minimum wage job at Sunglass Hut while was reigning Knockouts Champion because of how underpaid she was. After a fan recognized her, she resigned immediately.
    -   ODB had a second job as a bartender because TNA's low pay made it hard for her to make ends meet. She was a multiple-time Knockouts Champion and a Knockouts Tag Team Champion too.
