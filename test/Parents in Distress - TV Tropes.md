Kids have this tendency to get themselves in trouble, often requiring their parental figures to bail them out. Sometimes this goes to the point of violence or physical feats, where Mama Bear and Papa Wolf step up to the plate.

On the other hand, sometimes it's the _parents_ that get themselves in a sticky situation. Then the children will go to any lengths necessary to save their parents (or teacher, older sibling, etc.) from danger. If the characters are just _normally_ protective of their parents, it's Extremely Protective Child.

Any series with a Kid Hero who isn't Conveniently an Orphan is bound to try this. Compare Adults Are Useless and contrast Mama Bear and Papa Wolf. This trope is often a non-Ho Yay version of The Not-Love Interest.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The titular character from _Beelzebub_ has a moment when his wheelchair-bound mother, who has been lied to about her purpose of being with the people she's with, is trapped behind a strong barrier and gets knocked out hard enough to fall out of the chair by a crony for trying to force her way through it. While Oga is no stranger to rage, this is the first time that little Beel has been this angry. Needless to say, Oga's opponent and said barrier did not last long after.
-   In _Berserk_, Casca, rendered almost completely helpless after the events of the Eclipse, is protected from danger by her miscarried and tainted child by controlling the demons that would normally go after her and using them against those who try to harm her. It also uses its powers to warn its father, protagonist Guts, that she is in danger. Much later in the series, a little boy with a startling resemblance to Casca and Guts that may or may not be the Child reborn as a human whom Casca immediately likes, tries to free Guts of his cursed Berserker armor and later gives him a psychic Cooldown Hug when he's in a berserk state.
-   Bumbling Dad Kogoro Mouri from _Case Closed_ has had to be bailed out of trouble more than once by his Action Girl daughter and his Kid Detective (sorta) protegé. i.e, in a filler case Conan once uses his super-powered shoes to kick a rock towards a Dark Action Girl who has Kogoro in a makeshift gallows, forcing her to release him.
    -   The live action TV series reveals that the reason Shinichi and Kogoro were drugged and locked in the white room was because of Ran. The Big Bad kidnapped her mother Eri, and the poor girl reluctanly went along with his plan to save her, even though she expect Shinichi to hate her for it. (He doesn't.)
    -   The London arc relies heavily on rescuing the mother of Minerva (a famous tennis player who's playing in Wimbledon and Apollo (a boy whom Ran and Conan befriended).

Yui _immediately_ jumps into action and tells IR that she will be a Corrector.
    -   In the second season, Corrector Ai's main goal is to find the conscience of her comatose mother Azusa, which was "separated" from her body in an accident in the Net. It turns out it was NOT an accident.

When Future Trunks stood up, he was immediately knocked out by 18 who did Grievous Harm With Vegeta's Body. And when Vegeta was having trouble against Cell, Future Trunks did nothing and waited until his father lost his consciousness because he didn't want to hurt Vegeta's pride - Future Trunks was really, _really_ frustrated about this.

-   _Judge_ reveals this to be the reason why Kazuhiko Asai agreed to become The Mole, after being given a cellphone with instructions and a picture of their mother, whom they haven't seen in years due to personal reasons, held at gun-point and told to follow the instructions lest she be killed.

    A strange fire burned in my stomach. The weirdest thing was: it wasn't fear. It was anticipation. The
    
    desire for revenge. Hades had tried to kill me three times so far, with the Fury, the Minotaur, and the
    
    hellhound. It was his fault my mother had disappeared in a flash of light. Now he was trying to frame me
    
    and my dad for a theft we hadn't committed.
    
    I was ready to take him on.

The children characters realize that the only way to return them to normal is to _kill_ them. (Though after that's all said and done, the kids are sent back to their now healed worlds, where the parents are back to normal and alive).

She's been blackmailed by her boss, Damon Gant, for the past few years, which resulted in her taking on a cold, distant and standoffish demeanor in an attempt to cope.

-   _Danny Phantom_ has the titular hero constantly protecting his parents, Jack and Maddie, from the main villain.

-   Happened once in _Totally Spies!_, when the girls' mothers were kidnapped and then brainwashed into fighting their daughters.
-   _Winx Club_: This trope is recurrent across the series.
    -   Predictably for the main character, Bloom's parents are often on the receiving end of this trope.
        -   The first season's main villains, the Trix sisters, endanger Bloom's adoptive parents, Mike and Vanessa, to lure her into a trap since the effort to rescue them would leave her exhausted and in a bad position to defend herself. For context, they throw Mike and Vanessa into a Pocket Dimension\-like abyss, so she has to catch them in time and then fly them back to safe terrain.
        -   Bloom's biological parents, Oritel and Marion, are trapped as a statue and inside a sword, respectively, courtesy of the villains who caused their home planet's fall. The plot from late-stage season three to the first movie revolves around finding and rescuing them.
        -   Bloom saves her biological parents again in season five. During a royal ceremony to thank the Winx and Sky for restoring Domino, the Trix wait until the Winx are off on a mission to attack. Marion and Oritel are able to fend the Trix off until they are tricked into surrendering; then they are turned into ice statues. After the Winx defeat the Trix, Bloom de-freezes her parents.
    -   There are quite the examples in the third season:
        -   After the Big Bad breaks free from the Omega Dimension, he defeats the mermaids from Andros' underwater kingdom and turns them into his minions. Except for some fortunate souls who are imprisoned — among them, the queen. Princess Tressa evades capture and alerts the Winx to go and help free her mother, Queen Ligea. Tressa is initially fearful and not the one doing the heavy work but, after some words of encouragement, she frees her mother while the Winx distract the Kraken guarding the prison.
        -   Stella earns her Enchantix by pulling one of these. At the very beginning of the season, Stella's father, the king of Solaria, gets Brain Washed And Crazy by Wicked Stepmother, social-climber Countess Cassandra (helped by Valtor). Some episodes later, in a royal event, she does an Heroic Sacrifice to save her father from being burned by a dragon. Then, the transformation song starts. Bonus points because King Radius seems to recognize his daughter for a brief while.
        -   Later, Stella devices a ploy to sneak into and interrupt her still brain-washed father and Cassandra's wedding. This is when she is finally able to lift the curse on him thanks to one of the Enchantix's powers.
        -   At mid-season, the Portal to the Omega Dimension is about to implode because the Big Bad broke it. As a result, Andros, the planet hosting the portal, will be destroyed, starting with earthquakes and floods that worsen as the portal becomes more unstable. Aisha's parents, the queen and king, fight valiantly against the monsters coming from the portal but get ultimately trapped in the flooding Royal Palace. Aisha saves them before they drown.
    -   As Bloom and Roxy are mirror characters, Roxy has had to save her distressed parents too:
        -   Similar to Bloom's storyline, the plot of the fourth season involves rescuing trapped fairies from fallen realms. In this case, it's the Earth fairies — relentlessly hunted by the Wizards of the Black Circle and sealed away to be forgotten by humanity. Roxy, the Queen's daughter is not captured due to being too young to manifest magic. When she learns the truth, she gets determined to the Earth fairies. With the help of the Winx, Roxy goes to Tir Nan Og and opens its gates. It's kind of a subverted example because Roxy only learns that Queen Morgana is her mother later in the season.
        -   Earlier in the season, Roxy has to rescue her father Klaus because the Wizards of the Black Circle captured and impersonated him to lure her into a trap. She is kidnapped but after her Animal Companion and the magical pets locate her and fool the Wizards, she is able to free herself and her father. They are halted when the Wizards realize their mistake and overpower Roxy even after she triggers her fairy transformation. Fortunately, all of these developments provide enough time for the Winx to go to her aid.
