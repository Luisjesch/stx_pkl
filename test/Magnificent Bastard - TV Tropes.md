_"Rommel... you magnificent bastard, I READ YOUR BOOK!"_

If there was ever a villain that deserved to be called "Magnificent", that character _is_ the Magnificent Bastard. Capturing the audience with their charisma, incredible intellect, mastery of manipulation, and boldness of action, this character is a show-stealer, demanding your reverence at every turn. So what makes a character a Magnificent Bastard? Let's break it down:

-   They are brilliant and utterly devious, a smooth operator. They are also savvy and do not fall for obvious traps; bringing them down is no easy feat.
-   They have a goal, and they're not going to stop until they've completed it. Even when the goal is suicidally over-ambitious, they succeed with style.
-   They are charismatic, often charming, their personality is like a physical force. While they exist on the darker end of the moral spectrum, they never take disgusting actions that undermine their magnificence, leaving them diabolical but in a way the audience can't help but enjoy. And they are definitively not cowards. Ever.
