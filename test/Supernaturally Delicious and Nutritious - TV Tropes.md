_"He was irresistible, actually. He was like catnip to enormous, murderous reptiles. One whiff of him drove them into a frenzy, drawing their attention completely. People tended to be quite impressed by this knack. Or, at least, impressed that Skip had survived as long as he had while possessing it."_

A subtrope of Weirdness Magnet and Horror Hunger; it turns out that someone is _literally_ delicious. Either their blood is, or their Life Energy is far more appealing than most people. Vampires be lining up the block, demons give the boutique two clawed thumbs up, and The Heartless are going to come out of the woodwork. Needless to say, this is going to complicate someone's life considerably. It can also be a danger to everyone else if this acts as a Rare Candy and powers the monster up.

Occasionally, it's the very act of having powers to combat these forces that attracts them, because the local monstrous predators think that power-havers are mighty tasty. If this person doesn't have any powers to speak of, anyone who has them as their Protectorate had better be prepared for a _lot_ of protecting.

A variant of this is simply that supernatural beings find it literally pleasant to be around. They're not so much wanting to _eat_ them as... er... "eat" them. Or at least bask in the scent or energies and make their life complicated. Often it's a little of column A and a little of column B.

Do not confuse with Magically Delicious, which is about commercial advertisements.

Compare Evil Tastes Good. It may be inverted by Too Spicy for Yog-Sothoth. Also compare with Cannibalism Superpower, To Serve Man, Spiked Blood, and Super-Persistent Predator. The prey in question might try to convince their hunter that You Won't Like How I Taste, or if that fails, hope the monster will Regret Eating Me. In some cases this may lead to God-Eating. It can also overlap with Picky People Eater.

## Examples:

    Anime & Manga 

-   _×××HOLiC_: Watanuki's subconscious angst made him especially tasty to spirits, causing more angst, in some sort of demonically delicious loop.
-   Suzu of _Ayakashi Triangle_ is a spirit medium, someone born with a huge amount of Life Energy that some ayakashi want to take by eating her. However, most ayakashi drawn to Suzu mean no harm, and are often loyal to her. In a more benign note, this also make her hand-made food taste amazing to ayakashi.
-   _Berserk_: The Brand of Sacrifice makes its bearer closer to the supernatural than normal, and is placed on people sacrificed to the Godhand so that the bearer of a Behelit can become a demon. In the unlikely event that a branded person escapes this fate, spirits will be drawn to them every night and try to eat them. As a side effect the bearer can sense the presence of spirits and ignores anti-Muggle wards.
-   Helpless heroine Misao from _Black Bird (2006)_: “If a demon drinks her blood, he is granted a long life. If he eats her flesh, he gains eternal youth. And if he makes her his bride, his clan will prosper...” So she's constantly at risk from demons who want a bite. Or a marriage contract. Or both.
-   Ciel of _Black Butler_. The events that shaped his life have left his soul in such a state that it is considered the most suculent thing on Earth to demons. Much of Sebastian's loyalty to Ciel comes from the promise of feasting on Ciel's soul when the time comes.
-   In _Bleach_, the more powerful you are, the more tasty you are to Hollows. This is more of a concern for people who have just enough power to perceive them, but not actually _fight_ them.
-   Aisa Himegami from _A Certain Magical Index_ at least _smells_ delicious to vampires...however, they are destroyed by actually trying to drink her blood.
-   In _Dark Gathering_, Ai carries the brand of a god which marks her as his future sacrificial bride. The brand constantly leaks the god's energy which ghosts find irresistible. The only reason she's alive is that the brand also protects her from hostile gods by forcing them to attack anyone nearby.
-   In _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_, some people have "marechi" blood, which makes them supernaturally appealing to demons and grants them ten times the power than if they ate a normal person. Shinazugawa Sanemi, one of the elite hashira, has exceptionally strong marechi, and takes advantage of this by cutting himself in combat and letting the smell of his blood distract the demon he's fighting.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_: Hayate has delicious supernatural blood. It's part of the His Life Sucks package. In fact, his blood when he's half-dying is one of the most mystically infused substances in the world; and can completely power up Isumi or her great-grandmother. The latter has no problem with snacking on him, while the former tends to abstain, but once when Nagi was in danger, she tasted just a little and that gave her enough power to both break a Power Limiter curse that was on her and use her magic powers to teleport Hayate onto a spaceship in freaking Outer Space.
-   _Hell Teacher Nube_ ended up with a Red Right Hand because his latent spiritual powers caused him to be a target for demons (who wanted to eat him) and ghosts (who wanted help from someone who could interact with them).
-   Flea-demon Myoga from _Inuyasha_ once mentioned that Inu-Yasha's father's blood was "especially delicious", and that Inu-Yasha had inherited that from him. Different from the other examples in that Myoga is a demon, but not a villain; in fact, he is quite loyal to Inu-Yasha. The fact that Myoga is only slightly larger than a mundane flea may have something to do with it, of course — as it is, he drains harmlessly small amounts of blood from his "victims", who are annoyed more than anything else.
-   Kouta from _Kanokon_ is the supernatural Chick Magnet version. He smells particularly pleasing to spirits... but rather than putting his life in jeopardy, it results in him acquiring an Unwanted Harem consisting of a powerful fox-spirit, and a slightly-less-powerful wolf-spirit. (As well as drawing 'attention' from a number of other, more-or-less superpowered spirits.) Of course, their warring for his attention DOES occasionally put him in a bad place...
-   In _Karin_, all vampires have humans with particular qualities that they find especially tasty. Karin's father loves arrogant people, her mother favors the blood of liars, her brother goes for stressed people, and Karin herself is attracted to despair. When Karin's little sister awakens, she is drawn to the blood of lonely people.
-   The Karasumori site of _Kekkaishi_ has a Cherry tree that blooms out of season, said to excite the feelings of all around. This makes it a powerful Ayakashi magnet.
-   _Kubera_: Unlike other sura, the Chaos Clan instinctively attack strong prey while they are weakened. Taraka claims that this is the real reason Yuta is interested in Leez; he subconsciously understands she's going to be an unspeakably powerful Future Badass, and wants to eat her NOW, before she gets strong.
-   In _Mnemosyne_, the longer an immortal lives and the more painful memories she has, the tastier her time spore is to Eipos.
-   Ginko of _Mushishi_ is constantly attracting mushi which threaten to devour him if he stays in a particular place for too long. It's outright stated in the show that, eventually, they will catch up with him and eat him alive.
-   _Musuko ga Kawaikute Shikataganai Mazoku no Hahaoya_: The human Chiharu is to eight year-old vampire Lizette. For her part, Lizette has demonstrated incredible willpower and has not drank Chiharu's blood... just adored the scent from afar. She has much more trouble than normal in one chapter, when she runs out of the blood she's normally supplied with and needs every ounce of that incredible willpower not to attack Chiharu. She resolves afterward to _never_ run out of blood like that again.
-   The man-eating youkai of _Natsume's Book of Friends_ often comment on how delicious Natsume smells because of the strength of his power.
-   Evangeline in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ indicates at first that Negi's blood, being the son of the Mage who imprisoned her, would grant her the power to escape her bonds. She started off apparently as the homicidal version of this trope, but after her Defeat Means Friendship, started training him with Black Magic. Her price for the training is some regular Kiss of the Vampire, and she's getting away with it.
-   Tsukune from _Rosario + Vampire_, due to being a human in a school for monsters, almost all of which would love the chance to eat a human. Moka frequently says his blood is "very sweet".
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, Kaneki is apparently incredibly delicious as a result of his hybrid nature. This results in Picky People Eater Tsukiyama becoming absolutely obsessed with him, considering him the ultimate culinary experience. Just the scent of his blood has members of the Gourmet Club moaning in excitement, and eager to sample this rare and delicious meat. Another example is the ghoul investigator Suzuya, who is noted by Kaneki and some other no-name ghouls to smell absolutely delicious — it's because he used to work as a "scrapper" for a ghoul restaurant since he was a little boy, killing dozens of people for their meat before he was finally rescued and reintegrated into humanity.
-   From _Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase_ we have Kouhei: He is the so-called "Vampire's Lover". What this means is his blood, besides being literally delicious for vampires, has the power to undo the psychic oaths of obedience they have towards their masters. That's how Hazuki was able to leave the castle prison she was in at the beginning, and how Elfriede is able to deceive and betray Count Kinkel, her master.
-   The Virus in _Venus Versus Virus_ especially wanted to eat people who could sense them, such as the Main Characters. This put a lot of stress on the new girl; which would shift her into her Anti-Virus Superpowered Evil Side; who would usually easily trounce this. But then _she_ would find her partner "smells absolutely irresistible" and try to ...taste her until her normal personality kicked back in. It is _not_ played for laughs.
-   in _Wild Arms Twilight Venom_, Mirabelle (a Crimson Noble) gets a small taste of Sheyenne's blood and flips out, wanting some more.

    Comic Books 

-   Darklings from _The Darkness_ give this reason for following Jackie.
-   Point-One-Percenter sparks in _Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_ are so-called because of their rarity—just .1% of the Cybertronian forged population (which is itself fairly small) are Point One Percenters, possessed of powerful and special green Sparks compared to the usual pale blue ones. Apparently the sheer brightness of their Sparks make them appealing to things that feed on Sparks, such as Sparkeaters.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Ghosts of the Past_, sequel of _Child of the Storm_, it is heavily implied that Super-Soldier blood is particularly attractive to vampires. Specifically, it can make the likes of Dracula, who's been after it for some time, into a Day Walking Vampire. And no one but Steve, or one of his descendants, will do...
-   An amusing Harry Potter story called _No Competition_ _No Competition_ has Harry being this as a result of Voldemort's killing curse and his mother's spell. It gives him a powerful dark aura that is like catnip to dark creatures, to the point where some of the most powerful dark beings in the world have congregated to be in his presence from the high they get off of his aura. This does not make him evil at all, however. It just attracts these dark beings who want to enjoy the curious mix of his innocence and dark aura. This makes wizards on the light side fear him, but aggravates Voldemort to no end, as he can't seem to recruit the very beings that are congregating around his enemy.
-   _Superwomen of Eva: Treacherous Web_: As a result of killing Gendo Ikari and eating ADAM, Ritsuko Akagi/Spider-Woman ends up with the _very bad_ side-effect that every time she transforms into her superpower alter-ego, any Angels in the vicinity end up attracted to her and will stop at _nothing_ to absorb her into them.
-   In _Survival of the Fallen_, an X-Men (films)/True Blood/POTC/Van Helsing and whatever else crossover, Logan's (Wolverine) blood tastes very strong to Vampires and heals them at an absolutely ridiculous rate. This is because he is among other things one of the nephilim and the son of Gabriel Van Helsing, i.e. the Archangel Gabriel.
-   In _Tales of the Canterlot Deportation Agency_, pony blood suppresses Frenzy in Kindred. The problem is that not only are ponies sentient, but the (recently discovered and closely held) Tremere ritual requires three human sacrifices to get to Equestria _and_ a pony sacrifice to get back.
-   In the _Supernatural/Twilight_ crossover _The Wedding Crashers_, Leah takes Sam and Dean to Renesmee and Jacob's wedding, where about eighty percent of the guests are vampires. A lot of them then go out of their way to tell Dean that he smells really, really good, including the ones who don't eat humans. Castiel theorises that this is due to Dean being Michael's True Vessel, the "most unique and powerful vessel on the planet". Dean's not exactly thrilled.
    -   The vampires also target Sam for this reason; in addition, one of them claims that he has the potential to become one of the most powerful vampires ever seen. Like Dean, Sam isn't exactly thrilled...especially when their choice of words to describe him brings up bad memories.

    Literature 

-   In Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' vampire novels, witches' blood is especially delicious.
-   _Anita Blake_: Blood from people who have supernatural abilities is especially desirable to vampires, although drinking too much of it in a short period can affect them like alcohol. This is revealed when Jean-Claude refuses an offer of blood from a man with Fae ancestry because he had just drunk from both Anita and from a werewolf and anymore would have made him too intoxicated for a meeting he was about to have.
-   _I Hate Dragons_: Skip has the supernatural power of smelling so delicious to dragons that they go crazy with the desire to eat him.
-   _Journey to the West_: Xuanzang is this because his virgin flesh is supposed to grant immortality to demons as it is the flesh of a holy man. This is a Trope Codifier in regard to Eastern literatures.
-   _Peter Pan_: While no supernatural reason is given for it, Captain Hook is apparently pretty tasty. After Peter chops his hand off, it's tossed into the mouth of a nearby crocodile who finds it so delicious it now follows Hook wherever he goes, licking his lips for the rest of him.
-   _The Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries_: Faeries are practically Scooby Snacks to vampires, to the point they act like dogs in a butcher shop when in the presence of one. (Sookie herself is less than pleased when she finds out her own fairy heritage is the reason she's so attractive to supernaturals.) It doesn't seem to work the same way for her relatives, though.
-   _Stardust_: The fallen star, Yvaine, is endangered thanks to her heart being the key to longevity and magical powers, and attracting the attention of the Lilim. Whether heart-of-star is particularly tasty is clarified in neither film nor book.
-   _The Twilight Saga_: Bella evidently smells particularly appealing to vampires, and her love interest in particular. This is a bit of a problem, because Vampire Bites Suck in this series and said love interest is _very_ serious about being a Vegetarian Vampire as a result. It really does suck to be Edward Cullen, doesn't it?

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_:
    -   Marcus Hamilton makes the mistake of telling Angel that great power flows through his veins while making a Badass Boast. Angel promptly decides to see if he's being literal.
        
        **Angel:** Wow! You really are full of it.
        
    -   Also, otters' blood is delicious. Virgin blood also has a unique taste, as one vampire requests it specifically.
        
        **Spike:** Oh, God, it's bloody ambrosia! Is this otter?
        
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Slayer blood is often implied to be better tasting to vampires than normal humans, as well as being both empowering and an aphrodisiac. It was Slayer blood that allowed The Master to break his seal at the end of the first season. In season three, Slayer blood was the only cure for a poisoned Angel. It's most likely the infusion of demonic energy that slayer powers come from.
    -   Glory, a God in Human Form, needs to drain the sanity of others to maintain hers. After inflicting this on Tara, Glory is noticeably giddy and mentions how great "that witch's mind" tasted.
-   _Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency_,:Dirk is noted by the emotional vampire-like "Three" to have energy that tastes really, really good.
-   _Ghost Whisperer_: Melinda is usually chased by ghosts in need of help (whether they want it or not), but there is the occasional guy who collects souls to gain power, and they tend to target her. Her occultist teacher friend told her that "If a dark spirit collects the soul of a light spirit, it's like a hundred points!"
-   _My Babysitter's a Vampire_: Ethan has a rare blood type that vampires consider a delicacy.
-   _Supernatural_':
    -   Season 7 had the year's Big Bad's followers creating food additives that would make any human eating them become tastier, bulkier, more complacent and lethal to any anthropophagous beasties other than his own kind.
    -   Dean seems to make every vampire he interacts with, even the ones who stick to animals, get a little ...hungry. It's been stated several times by angels and demons alike that he's the 'perfect vessel' probably due to him being the human host of Archangel Michael.
-   _The Strain (TV series)_: In the final season, after they have taken over, the Stigoi set up a facility to breed humans with type B blood, which they find particularly tasty.
-   _True Blood_: Fairy blood is unusually tasty for vampires, as well as allowing them to walk in the sun for limited periods.

    Myth and Religion 

-   The basis for what makes vampires so scary is drinking blood by biting into a human's neck with sharp fangs, or at least it is nowadays. In most vampiric lore from the 20th century, human blood is treated as absolutely delicious to vampires. How delicious depends on the work, as well as the attitude a vampire has towards the act itself. A good vampire might try to resist drinking human blood, treating it as a Horror Hunger. An evil vampire will liken chasing and feeding on a human as playing with their food.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   In an April Fools _Dragon_ magazine article about Flaws for Commoners (an NPC character class), this is one of them. Any carnivorous monster will attack the character to the exclusion of everyone else, even if they wouldn't have otherwise attacked the party at all.
    -   All dragon types have something that they consider to be the most delicious thing ever. For red dragons, this happens to be humans. Green dragons have a similar fondness for elves.
-   _Exalted_ has the Abyssal Exalted who, as creatures of death, have difficulties recovering Essence while outside of the Underworld. One way around this is to pop fangs and drain the Essence out of people in the form of blood. Needless to say, enlightened Essence users (such as other Exalted) yield much more return than plain old mortals.
-   _Pathfinder_ has the Ghoran, a plant species that was originally created by druids as a food source but has since been uplifted and become a race of Plant People. One of their racial traits is called "Delicious" — because they were originally meant to be food, anything (regardless of its usual diet) that grabs them with a bite gets bonuses to hold on because they just taste that good.
-   _The World of Darkness_:
    -   In _Vampire: The Masquerade_ and _Vampire: The Requiem_ it's stated that _other_ vampire blood is tastier to vampires than even human blood. But it's a Forbidden Fruit with its own dangers.
    -   _Old World of Darkness_:
        -   In _Changeling: The Dreaming_, changelings especially enjoy artistic people. This comes in both "Wants to be around them" and "Wants to Mind Rape them" forms. And changelings taste especially good to vampires, as well as providing a drug high.
        -   _Hunter: The Reckoning_ has a rule about mortals with more powerful blood than usual. The obvious disadvantage isn't worth the points you get.
    -   _New World of Darkness_:
        -   In _Vampire: The Requiem_, werewolf blood is especially nutritious to vampires, effectively delivering twice as much juice as human blood... but a) it stirs up the Beast and b) you have to deal with a _werewolf_ to get it.
        -   The _New World of Darkness_ has Merits and Minor Templates (think almost, but not quite, supernatural) for mortals that are essentially Weirdness Magnets. Any merit that allows the mortal to see ghosts or spirits usually has the downside that, even if they aren't immediately drawn to you, both such creatures will notice being noticed and at the least pester you and at worst try to possess you.
        -   Mortals with the "Residual Spirit Energy" Merit have spirit Essence in their blood. In theory, this is a powerful negotiating tool with Spirits, who subsist on Essence. In practice, most Spirits are more interested in a quick meal than in protecting the renewable resource, so they're Blessed with Suck.
        -   _Werewolf: The Forsaken_ allows the Uratha to regain Essence by eating the flesh of humans, wolves, or werewolves. However, as all three are extremely akin to them, that counts as cannibalism, meaning they need to make a Harmony check.
        -   _Promethean: The Created:_ Pandorans (essentially misborn and mutant Prometheans) require Pyros to survive, which they can only get by eating the Pyros-rich flesh of Prometheans.
        -   _Princess: The Hopeful:_ The body of a dead Princess is stated to be extremely delicious and nourishing to creatures of Darkness.
        -   _Leviathan: The Tempest_: has Atolls, otherwise normal humans whose presence suppresses a Leviathan's divine and bestial natures. The respite from being constantly torn between these two Warring Natures is quite literally addictive, so much so that many Leviathans will do just about anything (including things like kidnapping and starting wars) to stay in the company of an Atoll once they find one.
-   _Warhammer_: Dragon blood is so filling that any vampire that manages to drink a dragon dry will never feel their thirst again. Naturally, the fact that this requires them to drain a _dragon_ rather complicates things, to the point that only two vampires in history, the legendary warrior Abhorash the Great and the necromancer Zacharias, ever managed this feat. This led to Abhorash's bloodline, the Blood Dragons, becoming a Proud Warrior Race in order to be powerful enough to emulate him. Many Blood Dragons trying to work their way up to dragons have found that other monsters can also satiate them for an extended period of time, with one famously being able to slake his thirst for a century with each giant he consumes.

    Video Games 

-   _Final Fantasy XIV_: The voidsent Orcus sets his sights on devouring the Warrior of Light's "bounteous" soul for being as "blinding as the sun, pure as the snow", which is "\[as\] delectable as a boar slathered in grease" to a creature like him.
-   _League of Legends_: Because of his layers of immense trauma and guilt, Yasuo is a magnet for the supernatural. Demons, who in Runeterra feed on negative emotions, are naturally drawn to him, and Ahri, who is drawn to strong emotions for feeding, tries to keep her distance from him so she doesn't accidentally kill him.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_: As a rule of thumb, be _very_ distrustful of anyone handling any variant of this. There are many such elixirs, all with one thing in common: the basic recipe involves either sacrificing bits of your mind and soul, or ripping them out from someone.
-   _Stellaris_: If your species embraces both the genetic engineering ascension path and the consumption of other sapient species as food, then you can do this to species that you enslave by giving them the "Delicious" trait, meaning that they produce extra food when they are used as livestock.
-   _Touhou Project_: Hermits act as free level-ups for youkai that eat them, at least according to Perfect Memento in Strict Sense.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Akai Ito_: The main character comes from an ancient lineage of these people. Since the other characters are Lesbian Vampires in one way or another, this trait of hers really drives the story.
-   _Ookami Kakushi_: Certain humans, called Temptations, emit a nigh-irresistible scent that drives the Kamibito into a feral lust-crazed frenzy. Main character Hiroshi turns out to be a Temptation with a particularly potent scent, which causes no end of trouble for his Kamibito classmates.

    Webcomics 

-   _Grrl Power_: Succubi regularly mention that tantric energy from super-powered humans is _delicious_, almost to the point of being irresistible. And a vampire almost goes nuts just knowing a member of the exigil species is in town.
-   _unTouchable_: Modern vampires have learned to discreetly feed off humans' energy simply by touching them. Protagonist Sia finds her new neighbor Jiho has the most scrumptious energy she has ever tasted, but he Hates Being Touched.
-   _Transfusions_: The main character, Dylan, seems to be an example of this, with blood that tastes better and lasts longer for the vampire Joa.
-   _Zebra Girl_: Zandra, who the body of a demon but a human soul, is able to get vampires on her side because drinking her blood allows Vampires to actually sleep during the day, which is a big deal for them because vampires in this setting become powerless ghost-like beings during the day. Sam Sprinkles, who is a cartoon rabbit person from another dimension, has blood that causes vampires to become overwhelmed with sexual arousal.

    Web Original 

-   _SCP Foundation_: There are a few SCPs that have the effect of making the flesh of certain humans irresistibly delicious to other humans. One of them is a chocolate-like substance that make any human that eats it smell so good that other people will be compelled to try to eat them. Another is a phenomenon that makes people want to literally Eat the Rich, which has affected Jeff Bezos is starting to spread to other rich people.
-   _Whateley Universe_: Josie Gillman was turned into a girl to protect her from a family curse which grants some males of the Gillman line savant Level abilities in non-Euclidian geometry and "exceptional tastiness" to a Cosmic Horror, inevitably leading them to dabble in things humankind was not meant to know, fall through the cracks in our reality, and wander the dark interstices underlying the universe until they arrive at their inevitable, hideous doom. In short, male Gillmans are the Eldritch Abomination equivalent of delivery pizza.

    Western Animation 

-   _All-Star Superman_: Clark Kent's enormous power allows the villain Parasite to absorb enough ambient energy to escape his cell. Clark spends the next several minutes being chased through the prison, while having to keep Lex Luthor from realizing that he is really Superman and find a way to defeat Parasite.
-   _Crashbox_: The _Eddie Bull_ segment is an edutainment sketch series to teach about animals, with the same framing device for each episode; The titular Eddie works at a zoo, and is considered so delicious that every episode a new animal manages to swallow him, up to and including herbivores and animals much smaller than himself. He describes the animal to the viewer to help him figure out which did it this time.
-   _The Dragon Prince_: Glow toads are considered the best-tasting thing in the ocean to most aquatic creatures. Even giant sea serpents will go out of their way to eat a tiny glow toad because of how good they are. This is why the party's glow toad is named "Bait".
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: "Molt Down" reveals that young dragons becomes this during their molt, as Spike finds out the hard way. The smell they excrete, while repugnant to most other creatures, attract giant predators such as hydras, tatzlwurms or rocs. Thus Spike nearly gets eaten by a very persistent giant bird in the Everfree Forest.
