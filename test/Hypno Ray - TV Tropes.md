_"She looks hypnotized! He must have used that joy buzzer on her!"_

A standard gadget in the Mad Scientist grab bag. The Hypno Ray allows the user to instantly hypnotize an unsuspecting target and make that person do their evil bidding.

Often a Ray Gun, but the magical version usually takes the form of Eye Beams.

The sequence follows a standard progression:

-   The Mad Scientist flashes the Hypno Ray, instantly stunning the victim.
-   The victim displays Mind-Control Eyes and usually starts repeating anything the attacker says, often to his annoyance.
-   The victim hears a suggestion that he must follow (often not what the attacker intended).
-   The Hypno Ray shuts off and the victim wonders what just happened.
-   The Mad Scientist realises a mistake in what he has said and has to flash them again.

The victim later hears the trigger and takes the action, no matter how inappropriate it may be at the time.

This can often be combined with a mass media event to Take Over the World.

Such ray guns in fiction these days are reserved just for comedic works, as it's pretty hard to take it seriously anymore. Hypnotism in general has been getting a lot of scrutiny as a technique since the turn of the millennium. For one, you can only be hypnotized if you _want_ to be hypnotized. And that's if you're not one of the people who can't be hypnotized at all (even if they want to be). Also, hypnotism can't make people do things that they wouldn't normally do, so telling a hypnotized person to (for instance) attack someone they love would just snap them out of it. Finally, the various methods to induce hypnotism usually involve deep relaxation or intense eye focus, things that a ray gun simply wouldn't be able to do. While Mind Control and its various tropes are still around, using a beam from a Mad Scientist to do it has gradually fallen out of style in favor of being parodied, subverted or deconstructed.

A Sub-Trope of Mind-Control Device.

Not to be confused with Hypnotic Eyes.

    Comic Books 

-   _Mickey Mouse Comic Universe_:
    -   The first villains to appear in the comics were a trinity of Mad Scientist apes named Professors Ecks, Doublex (or Duplex), and Triplex who wanted to use one hyptonic beam to Take Over the World. They appeared in the "Blaggard Castle" storyline of daily strips, published in 1933.
    -   A more modern story had the Phantom Blot pretend to be one of the Professors come back to try and rebuild & reuse the hypno-ray, after the castle had been rebuilt as an honor for Mickey.
-   In the story "The Town That Went Crazy", in issue #92 of _Tales of the Unexpected_, these two Nazi scientists with stereotypical accents had a hypno-ray mounted in the side of a large truck and were testing it on an entire town. The main character discovered that its effects were blocked by steel while trying on his old WWII army helmet during a fit of wishful nostalgia.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In the cover of _Action Comics_ #362, Clark Kent is attacked by a hypnotic ray from a device that looks like Superman's head and Mind Controlled into hating his alter ego Superman.
    -   In _The Girl with the X-Ray Mind_, villain Lesla-Lar uses a mind-control ray cannon to take over Lena Thorul's mind.
    -   _The Strange Revenge of Lena Luthor_: After using Kryptonite dust to weaken Supergirl, a crook uses a strobe light to put her to sleep, calling it a "Paralysis beam" to enhance the hypnotic suggestion.
    -   In _The Super-Revenge of Lex Luthor_, the titular villain uses a "hypno machine" to convince Superman that Metropolis was about to be engulfed by a gigantic glacier.
-   _Spirou & Fantasio_: The Zorglonde (Zorglwave) allows the whole range from paralysing people at lower settings to making them highly suggestible, or completely brainwashing them and turn them into obedient automatons.

    Film — Animated 

-   Jafar's cobra headed staff in _Aladdin_, which he uses on the Sultan repeatedly until Aladdin breaks it. It was used twice on _Mickey Mouse_, tricking him to give up the House of Mouse, thus turning the night club into a House of Villains. He was foiled by that exact same protagonist who often defeats him with assistance from Aladdin and Jasmine.
-   Used for laughs in _Meet the Robinsons_, when Bowler Hat Guy attempts radio control of a frog. And later, a T-Rex. Bowler Hat Guy has trouble picking useful thralls.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   In _Close Encounters of the Third Kind,_ the Grey Aliens blast Roy Neary at close range and sunburn half of his face. Sanity Slippage ensues.
-   The Neuralizer from _Men in Black_.
-   In the second _Fantômas_ movie, the eponymous villain abducts a number of scientists and has them construct a Hypno Ray gun. After the heroes thwart his plans and free the scientists, they use the gun to placate a pair of mooks he threw at them, but Fantômas himself escaped before they have a chance to subdue him.
-   Used in _The Return of Captain Invincible_. Mr Midnight (Christopher Lee) steals it and uses it on ethnic minorities in America to force them to move to a particular town so that he can kill them off in one move.
-   The L.O.O.K.E.R. gun from the 1981 film _Looker_ poses as a strobe-light gun, but really hypnotizes its victims so that they would lose all sense of time.

    Literature 

-   The 3-D Hypno Ring from _Captain Underpants_.
    -   A Hypno Ray also appears in _Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot_, by the same author.
-   Not so much a ray as it is an audible tone, the main character of The Chronicles of Professor Jack Baling is on the receiving end of one of these at the beginning of Episode 2.
-   In the earliest issues of _Perry Rhodan_, handheld "psycho-ray" weapons of Arkonide manufacture make for convenient plot devices in helping the protagonist set up his own small but powerful new nation-state on an Earth involved in a three-sided Cold War at the time. As amusing as some of the results may be, the abuse potential becomes obvious early on (an attacking fighter pilot that the user didn't _mean_ to kill nonetheless dies from not snapping out of his trance after a hurried command to "pull up!" in time, causing his plane to stall out and crash with him still in it) and so it's perhaps unsurprising that this particular bit of phlebotinum later quietly drops out of sight.
-   The _Harry Potter_ books have the Imperius Curse.

    Live-Action Television 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ season six episode "Dead Things" features a dramatic subversion, at least as far as the comedic setting goes. Nerd supervillain Warren invents a mind control device and uses it on his ex-girlfriend, allowing the geek trio to dress her up as a French maid and generally be laughably adolescent about the whole thing. Then the story makes a swift plunge into darkness when Warren commands his ex to give him oral sex; she comes out of the trance and accuses the trio of attempted rape, and is brutally killed by Warren when she tries to escape.
-   The Mad Hatter from _Batman (1966)_ had one in his top hat, customized to look like a pair of eyes.
-   In _The Outer Limits (1963)_ episode "The Brain of Colonel Barham", a terminally ill astronaut agrees to become a Brain in a Jar as part of an experiment. Once Barham's brain is freed from its failing body, it somehow develops the power to shoot hypno rays at the people around it, temporarily turning them into Brainwashed and Crazy mental slaves.
-   In one episode of _Power Rangers Time Force_, a Monster of the Week used a bracelet shaped like a snake to make the male rangers fall in love with her. She later uses it to make them fight each other. The spell was broke when the girl rangers broke the bracelet.

    Other Sites

    Video Games 

-   Much used in Telltale Games' _Sam & Max: Freelance Police Season 1_. After all, the story is about Mass Hypnosis.
-   _De Blob 2_ features the Hypno Ray, a planetary-sized hypnotic device under the control of Comrade Black powered by the color energy gathered by De Blob throughout the game. It's used once to take control of the residents of Prisma City. Apparently it also bleaches buildings.
-   _Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando_ has one that works on robots only. Don't even think about using it on Clank.
-   _Fallout 3_ has the Mesmertron, a Pre-War device that confuses and disorients anyone the beams hit. The problem is that it has a 50% chance to confuse them, a 30% chance to throw them into a berserk rage, and a 20% chance of causing "spontaneous cranial eruption".
-   _Transistor_: The Switch() Function fires a projectile in a straight line, that does Charm Person, and one of two phrases that describes the Function is "Hypnotic".

    Webcomics 

-   Used in _Concession_ when the sub-plot villains use mind control for villainy, although they state the possible real-life applications, to the chagrin of the mind-control wielder.

    Western Animation

-   Used at least twice on _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_. Once used by Beautiful Gorgeous to control Secret Agent Man Jet Fusion, but it failed when hundreds of people said the trigger words at the same time. Jimmy also used one to force his parents to think it was his birthday, but they tricked him to teach him a lesson.
    -   They later try to justify it: After Jimmy uses his Hypno-beam to disable the Mad Scientist's Beautiful Daughter, his partner mentions that he didn't think hypnotism worked like that. Jimmy responds that the weak-willed are easily swayed by flashy special effects. Ironically, she hypnotizes Jimmy in a later episode.
-   _DuckTales (1987)_: Subverted in "Home Sweet Homer" as Scrooge McDuck is hypnotized by a huge monster with each head resembling a duck. He was later rescued by his nephews.

    -   Subverted in "The Lesser of Two Evils".
        
        **Fry:** He must've used a sleep ray on me! Sleep rays exist in the future, right?

        **Fry:** Oh. Then I must've fallen asleep.

-   On _WordGirl_, Mr. Big has a mind control ray which is used for farcical reasons - one of which was making everyone in town use huge words in order to occupy the heroine. Even the title character is not immune to this trope, but usually snaps out of it within seconds.
-   In _Dinosaucers_, Quackpot's "Joy Buzzer" is actually a ray gun with many uses. One of them is this, like when he hypnotized Sarah.

        **Mentok:** You're no longer in control of your mind, and your wings are missing too.  
        **Harvey:** I am no longer in control of my mind, and my wings are missing too.  
        **Mentok:** Uh, you don't have to repeat what I'm saying.  
        **Harvey:** I don't have to repeat what you're saying.
        
    -   Come to think of it, Mentok (and Francis X. Shado) both do this several times over the course of the series.
        
        **Potamus:** Must... give... wallet... to... evil leprechaun...

They later explain to a psychiatrist that the Super Adventure Club convinced Chef that having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes _whrrrrrr_.
