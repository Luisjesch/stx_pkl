Typhan-knee finally sees herself for what she's become.

_"Have you noticed that our caps have actually got little pictures of skulls on them? Hans... are we the **baddies**?"_

Few things are more crushing than realizing that you're one of the bad guys. You might exclaim My God, What Have I Done? (or something like it) and perhaps shed Tears of Remorse. Or in some cases, you realize you're even worse than you thought you were. Either way, it's the moment you know you're in the wrong.

It may lead to becoming The Atoner, a Redemption Quest, or Redemption Equals Death, or, if the author is feeling particularly vindictive, to a Heel–Face Door-Slam. Conversely, may turn a Well-Intentioned Extremist Necessarily Evil, or force them to admit that there is No Place for Me There. There's also the possibility to ignore the realization and go for Redemption Rejection, which is what Complete Monsters would always do. Sometimes these people were just working for someone who turned out to be doing horrible things. A common form is to Kick the Morality Pet and/or realize that Being Evil Sucks.

Common when The Dark Side Will Make You Forget or when Big Brother Is Employing You. May be caused by a Corrective Lecture.

Compare Nice Job Breaking It, Hero (when someone has good intentions but harmful execution), He Who Fights Monsters (when someone became a heel by doing a dirty job for too long), Then Let Me Be Evil (when they realise they're a heel — but they embrace it), Jerkass Realization, Regretful Traitor (when their realisation comes after a Face–Heel Turn), Guilt-Induced Nightmare, and Unwitting Pawn (when they've done bad things because someone was manipulating them). Contrast with Knight Templar who often never realize that they are a villain (though there are plenty of exceptions) and Card-Carrying Villain (who never thinks he's a good guy in the first place). Also see Tomato in the Mirror, when one of the good guys realizes he was a sleeper agent all the time.

Compare _and_ contrast Evil Me Scares Me.

For the direct opposite, see Face Realization. Or for the other direct opposite, see Obliviously Evil. See also You Are Better Than You Think You Are for where the character fails to see they are nobler than they give themselves credit for.

-   _Big Finish Doctor Who_: "The Fourth Wall" has a fictional character being brought into reality, and realising that in the world of his TV show (_Laser_, starring Jerkass hero Jack Laser), he's the villain:
    
    **Krarn:** It’s called... _Laser_.  
    **Scullop:** The show, yes.  
    **Krarn:** Why?  
    **Scullop:** Because he’s the lead, he’s the hero.

    Comedy

Brock even says that his Ghostly Goals involve bringing the slaves back to their masters, but he refuses to do that because of how terrible racism is. (Though Brock notes that if he did accomplish his goal, he'd probably be going straight to Hell.) Instead, Brock decided he Must Make Amends and end racism, but then realized that he didn't really have any idea how to do that.

    Films — Animated 

-   In the film version of _All-Star Superman_, Lex Luthor has one of his only heel realizations in any continuity after he finally _gets it_. What is "it"? _Everything_.
    
    **Lex Luthor:** I could have made _everyone_ see! If it wasn't for you, _I could have saved the world!_  
    **Superman:** If it had _mattered_ to you, Luthor, you could have saved the world years ago.  
    **Luthor:** ... you're right.

This causes Carface to reform and help stop Belladonna's plans to hypnotize every dog in San Francisco.
-   _The Bad Guys (2022)_: Diane Foxington is revealed to have had this moment in a flashback sequence. As the Crimson Paw, she was an untouchable master thief, something she thought she was proud of.

Later in the movie, Kuzco is all alone in the jungle, and he realizes what a jerk he's been to everybody... and that he's entirely to blame for everything that's happened to him (even Yzma wanting to kill him). His narration again tells the audience that he's the victim, but...
    
    **Kuzco:** _\[to narration\]_ Hey, give it a rest up there, will ya?  
    **Kuzco's Narration:** What? I'm just telling them what happened.  
    **Kuzco:** Who are you kidding, pal? They saw the whole thing. They _know_ what happened.  
    **Kuzco's Narration:** Well, yeah, but... but...  
    **Kuzco:** Just leave me alone...
    
-   _Home (2015)_:
    -   Oh has a major revelation that his own people themselves are entirely the cause of all their persecution problems.
    -   After Oh saves the Boov using a Gorg Superchip, Kyle realizes that he should have accepted Oh as his friend and sides with him against Smek.
-   Claude Frollo of _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ seems to have one that lasts for about a second or two during his Villain Song, when he sings "God have mercy on her/God have mercy on me" and then follows up with "But she will be _mine_, or she will burn!"
-   Diego in _Ice Age_. He's confronted about the selfishness and brutality in his plans that set up Manny when the mammoth saves him from the lava, and after Roshan chooses to walk to him first.

-   In _The LEGO Movie_, it's no secret that Lord Business is a Control Freak, but it's not him who has the realization.

TMU finally has the realization after he finds out that Finn based an imaginary supervillain on him. Of course, TMU isn't really evil _per se_, but he is, as noted, an Allegorical Character for TMU's own control freak tendencies.

Without a direction for himself anymore, Bowler Hat Guy starts thinking about reforming. The bowler hat, Doris, figures this out (It Makes Sense in Context) and takes matters into her own robotic claws, and it takes the combined efforts of the Robinsons, Lewis, and Bowler Hat Guy to stop her.
-   In _Monsters, Inc._, Sulley gives a scare demonstration to some candidates, badly scaring Boo, which makes him realize how horrible it actually is to scare little children.
-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_: Sunset Shimmer gets one after the climax of the film. Whatever Sunset was expecting the Element of Magic to do once she put it on her head, it wasn't to turn her into a "raging she-demon". Before her transformation, Sunset hadn't been willing to threaten a puppy; after it, she tried to outright kill Twilight. After the Rainbooms stopped her, Sunset understood that she had been the bad guy even before this, and promptly repented. _Rainbow Rocks_ shows us details; she's harder on her past self than the Humane Five are, and directs a great deal of scorn and sarcasm at herself.
-   In _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Friendship Games_, the other members of Crystal Prep's Shadowbolts team are horrified that their determination to win led to the actual human Twilight Sparkle being transformed into the monstrous Midnight Sparkle. So much so that, when Midnight goes on a reality-breaking spree, the girls quickly aid the others in saving those dangling in the holes from falling in. Once everything is set back to normal, the girls are a lot more apologetic and friendlier and no longer care about winning (much to their principal Cinch's fiery disgrace).
-   _My Little Pony: A New Generation_: Phyllis Cloverleaf is the owner and CEO of CanterLogic, a high tech company that specializes in propaganda-based protection gear, since Phyllis believes that unicorns and pegasiare dangerous and want to harm Earth ponies.

-   Jack's realization in _The Nightmare Before Christmas_ crystallises in the song "Poor Jack".
-   RJ in _Over the Hedge_ spends the first half of the film tricking the forest animals into stealing food so he can take it all and give it to Vincent, a bear whose food he caused to be run over.

When she sees her brothers again, she couldn't help but run off in tears, realizing just how ungrateful she was towards her brothers' inventing talents and thinking that she's ruining everyones' summer.
-   _Ratatouille_: Downplayed with Ego. Rémy's cooking and its effect on him forces him to reevaluate nearly everything he's preached his entire career, and makes him realize his criticism should not be taken as gospel like it has been. He was wrong, anyone, even someone from the lowliest origin imaginable, can cook.
-   _The Rugrats Movie_:
    -   Tommy suffers this big time. Having been abandoned by his friends and left to fend for himself and his baby brother, Dil, Tommy finally snaps at Dil's greediness and attitude and plans to give Dil to the monkeys. However, as he's ready to dump banana baby food on Dil, the younger Pickles' demeanor changes to one of outright fear and Tommy sees himself in a puddle's reflection. This and Dil quickly clambering up to hug Tommy is enough to realize what he was doing was wrong. Even the _monkeys_ are close to tears as they sadly look on as Tommy brings Dil back to shelter.
    -   Dil as well gets this during this scene, realizing how much of a brat he was.
    -   Chuckie later realizes he abandoned his best friend to fend for himself in the woods. He gets Phil and Lil to go back for Tommy and Dil because somebody has to take care of them and there's nobody else around.
-   In _Turning Red_, Ming is not an evil person. She never wanted to be a villain, and certainly never saw herself as a villain. But somewhere between getting One-Hit KO'ed by Mei and meeting up with the aunties and Grandma on the astral plane, she realizes that she is, in fact, the villain of the piece. That realization, plus the compassion and forgiveness shown to her by both her daughter and her mother, are enough to bring about a drastic change in her attitude.
-   In _Zootopia_, Judy gets one as she realizes the extent of her patronizing attitude and Innocently Insensitive comments towards predators has worsened the Night Howler situation.

    But the world fought back, punished me for my sins  
    I felt so alone, so insecure  
    I blamed you instead, made sure I was heard

    Myths & Religion 

-   Older Than Feudalism in _The Bible_:
    -   According to Christianity, acknowledging one's own "fallenness" is the first step to receiving salvation.
        -   And in the Orthodox faith, the right way of true living by Christ's commandments is to come to the _state_ of this. And if not, that won't work.
        -   A specific example would be Saul of Tarsus, better known as Saint Paul the Apostle. He began as a notorious persecutor of the earliest Christians, who was knocked to the ground and struck blind by a vision of God on the way to Damascus (_"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?"_). He converted within the week to Christianity and found his sight restored, and "the road to Damascus" would become a popular metaphor for the Heel Realization.
    -   The Gospel of Matthew, 27:54, and the Gospel of Mark, 15:39: a Roman soldier present at the Crucifixion, upon seeing all the things that happen when Jesus finally does die, remarks, "Truly, this man was the son of God."
    -   In the New Testament, when Judas Iscariot realizes that he's betrayed Jesus, he gives back the thirty pieces of silver and hangs himself. (The other account for his death averts this trope.)
    -   David, though beloved of the Lord, was rebuked by the prophet Nathan when he had Uriah the Hittite put on the front lines so he would be killed, and David could take his wife Bathsheba for himself. Nathan tells him that the child Bathsheba was currently pregnant with would not live. Indeed, despite David fasting and clothing himself in sackcloth, the baby died after seven days. (And during this time, David allegedly wrote the powerfully penitent Psalm 51).
    -   According to the gospel of Luke, Jesus was crucified at the same time as two criminals. One of the criminals mocked Jesus, telling Him to save all three of them if He was really the Son of God. The second criminal rebuked the first, telling him that they (the criminals) were getting the punishment they deserved, but that Jesus had done nothing wrong. The second criminal asked Jesus to remember him, and Jesus promised that the second criminal would join him in paradise for his humbleness and for proclaiming Jesus as the Son of God.
-   _The Book of Mormon_: When the Actual Pacifist people of Ammon are attacked and over a thousand of them slaughtered, the attackers eventually realize that they're not fighting back at all, and many are "stung", "their hearts had swollen". Over a thousand of them — more than the number of casualties — throw their weapons down and join the survivors in prayer.
-   According to legend, Joan of Arc's executioner showed up at his church for confession as a babbling wreck shortly after due to realizing he had "killed a holy woman."

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Since pretty much any wrestler who is booed is a heel, outside of some bizarre circumstances like X-Pac Heat, most are well aware of what they are and don't see themselves as being "wrong", "evil" or such. A wrestler who does realize they have been doing wrong and deciding to cut it out may still remain a heel anyway (Mickie James). A straight example, by this page's description, would be at _ROH Fifth Year Festival Finale_ when Colt Cabana tried to remove Delirious's mask. When the fans booed him for it, he stopped and apologized for it.
-   Matt Hardy, whom after losing an "I Quit" to his brother Jeff, realized he was being consumed by jealousy and envy and stopped being such an ass to his brother.
-   The Shield formed together because they really didn't like the popularity contest that is the reality of professional wrestling (or the fact that the in their eyes inferior Ryback arrived on the main roster before them, but that's another topic entirely) and decided to everything they could to ensure fan favorite wrestlers were as unsuccessful as possible, which they viewed as "justice". This led them to work for The Authority in keeping down the always over Daniel Bryan but found The Authority often getting in their way (such as against The Wyatt Family), and when The Authority decided to go after commentator Jerry Lawler, The Shield came to the conclusion The Authority was, in fact, the greatest injustice in WWE and decided to fight them instead.
-   After seeing TNA's locker room empty to ensure that she would not escape from Bully Ray and his table, Dixie Carter came to realize she was the bad guy and scolded her nephew from trying to take action against Bully Ray, the company, and her own personal circle for the incident instead of putting Bully Ray in charge of wrestling operations as an apology for her tyranny.

    Roleplay 

-   _Survival of the Fittest_:
    -   Bobby Jacks, who realizes he's one of the bad guys very early on but then decides that now that he's killed somebody there's no going back. Lenny Priestly also arguably fits this, although he is less somber about it.
    -   In _v4_, Reiko Ishida has one of these after strangling resident Wide-Eyed Idealist and Instant Fan Club member Carol Burke to death in a fit of rage.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The first edition of the _Discworld Roleplaying Game_ draws on _Wyrd Sisters_ (see above) to define a spell that triggers such realizations. If the target refuses to be frightened, this can rebound on the caster...
-   In _Ravenloft_, having a Heel Realization is the only way a darklord can escape his/her Ironic Hell realm. The sourcebook does note that people actually _capable_ of having a Heel Realization and actually admitting that they reaped what they sowed when they committed the Act of Ultimate Darkness that made them darklords would never have become darklords in the first place. Thus far, the only time this has happened was when the writing team lost the rights to Lord Soth and had to remove him in a hurry; he admitted his guilt, causing the Powers That Be to lose interest in torturing him and banish him from the realm.
-   In _Sentinels of the Multiverse_, the villainous AI Omnitron — after a century of defeats at the hands of the heroes — surmises that their success comes from their emotions, and creates a new, tenth iteration with an empathy chip. Omnitron-X then realizes the depth of suffering he's caused and goes back in time to destroy his previous versions as atonement.

    Theatre 

-   At the end of _Anastasia_, Gleb realizes he is no better than his father if he goes through with assassinating Anya/Anastasia.
-   Reverend Hale in _The Crucible_ has one of these and spends the rest of the play trying to make amends — by encouraging victims of the witch-hunt to confess and live rather than dying for continuing to deny witchcraft.
-   Valjean and Javert in _Les Misérables_ — see Literature, above, although the episodes with Petit Gervais and Marius are sometimes omitted, the realizations following directly from the Bishop's undeserved gift to Valjean and Valjean's decision to spare Javert. Here, with Javert having been upgraded from "recurring nuisance" to "deuteragonist", an explicit parallel is drawn, Javert having a solo that's a Dark Reprise of Valjean's.
-   The stage version of _Little Shop of Horrors_ climaxes when Seymour Krelborn realizes what he's aided and abetted for a little fame and a shot at the woman of his dreams. Confronting Audrey 2 he damns them both, "You're a monster, and so am I!" He is then promptly eaten.
-   Both characters in _Macbeth_ experience this in the play — for him, it's an Ignored Epiphany, but Lady Macbeth loses her mind.
-   In George Bernard Shaw's play _Saint Joan_, after Joan of Arc is captured, the English chaplain John de Stogumber pushes relentlessly for burning her at the stake; when he actually sees it done, he goes insane with remorse.
-   Emma, the protagonist of Andrew Lloyd Webber's _Song & Dance_, desperate and discouraged by several failed relationships, finally has an affair with a married man. But when the man knocks on her door one night and tells her he's left his wife for her, she's forced to admit she wasn't serious about the relationship and was only using him. Realizing what she has become, Emma vows that she will change and become the good person she once was again.
-   In _You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown_, Lucy van Pelt has a massive one after conducting a series of surveys to determine how crabby everyone thinks she is. Very crabby, it turns out.
-   In _Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol_, while watching his past and the Cratchits' happy present, Marley realizes how short, cruel, and meaningless his own life was.

    Visual Novels 

-   Part of Kotomine's Backstory in _Fate/stay night_ is his realization that nice people do not enjoy watching others being tortured or that sort of thing. That's fundamentally why he can't actually become a Card-Carrying Villain; he actually has a sense of morality. The end result can be considered an Ignored Epiphany but he _did_ try. For years.
-   In _Katawa Shoujo_, in Act 4 of Shizune's route, she realizes that she has been taking those closest to her for granted and pushing people close to her away. She thus resolves to, with Hisao's help, repair her friendship with Misha, and also says she will be less competitive in the future.
-   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_, Miles Edgeworth starts to have "doubts" after you demonstrate two defendants to be innocent, but it's not until he's the defendant in two murder trials in a row in which he's innocent that he really decides that striving to get every single defendant found guilty to maintain a "perfect record" might be a bad thing. Furthermore, he finds out that although he became a prosecutor because of the fatal shooting of his father, it turns out that the real killer is the senior prosecutor who mentored him, and instilled those beliefs in him to begin with!
    -   Also, in the fifth case, Edgeworth finds that he's already guilty of using forged evidence, and the forged evidence was used to give a death sentence to a serial killer. He wasn't aware of it at the time (he himself didn't forge it, and he was convinced that it was the real deal), but it really came to bite him in the ass when people found it out and started to call him out on it. Even when they find out who forged the evidence and why, sort of clearing his name a bit, he couldn't forgive himself for it... and it's implied that it's one of the many things that pushes him to leave the prosecutors' office for a year, leaving what appears to be a suicide note.
    -   Acro has one in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All_. When the Judge, having realized that he'd intended to kill Regina in revenge for her Deadly Prank that resulted in Acro being wheelchair-bound and his brother bat going into a coma, but accidentally killed Regina's father and Acro's Parental Substitute, asks if he's a victim, he says he's nothing but a murderer.
    -   Downplayed in that he's not the Big Bad or even arguably a villain in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_, but Godot realises at the end of the final case that he both made the situation a lot worse because of his actions (literally engineering a situation where he could be a hero) and was projecting his own insecurities and self-hatred onto Phoenix.
    -   In _The Great Ace Attorney_, The Professor(aka Klint van Zieks) started killing nobles who couldn't be touched by the law, but after the Big Bad, Mael Stronghart, blackmailed him into doing his bidding, he started killing Stronghart's enemies, and by the time he killed his mentor, he realized he was Beyond Redemption. This ultimately culminated in him allowing Genshin Asogi to kill him after the latter exposed him, leaving behind a last will and testament exposing Stronghart's crimes.
-   Major spoilers for _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_. Hajime Hinata learns this during the final trial.

He submitted himself to an experiment by the school board to become the Ultimate Hope, becoming Izuru Kamukura. He then murders the School Council, then urged by the Ultimate Despair, Junko Enoshima, who broadcasts it to the world. This makes all of the Reserve Students commit suicide, bringing about the Tragedy.

-   In _Tsukihime_, Akiha route, you can, at one point, kill Ciel (thus, failing her test of Shiki's humanity), prompting Shiki to assume he IS a natural-born killer, after all, and give in to The Dark Side. Needless to say, it's a bad ending game over.
    -   Part of Kohaku's route has her realize much quicker than in Hisui's route that _maybe_ she should have picked a different hobby than plotting the utter annihilation of the Tohno family, even if Makihasa wasn't the world's nicest guy after his Inversion Impulse began.
-   In the Psychological Horror masquerading as a Dating Sim _Doki Doki Literature Club!_, in the final scene with Monika, you learn that she's self aware and can edit the game's code, and has deleted every other part of the game, other characters included. The player's response is to delete _her_ character file, and for a moment it looks like she's going to go full screaming Yandere before it slowly sinks in that this is exactly what she did to the others and that, even if they were replaceable data and scripts, they were still her friends. She laments how monstrous she had become and restores the characters and the game world before accepting her fate.
-   _Majikoi! Love Me Seriously!_: Miyako, who was originally brought into the Kazama Family for a reprieve from horrible treatment by her family & classmates, becomes troubled by decreased attendance at the Family's Friday meetings, and insists that everyone attend even if they miss events crucial to realizing individual goals. She cannot believe that people who call themselves her friends wouldn't be around when she needs them, and when her pleas lead to vehement arguments which threaten to tear the group apart, she just becomes more resigned to the idea that no one will ever understand her. It takes a Bitch Slap and a "The Reason You Suck" Speech from Chris, her biggest defender in those altercations, for Miyako to comprehend the undue burden she puts on the rest of the Kazama Family by never growing as a person from when she joined. She never tried to make any other friends or pick up any new experiences, and when she felt lonely & unfulfilled she made the rest of the Family her crutch, forever remaining the helpless girl the rest of the Family has to save. She vows to do better, kickstarting her Character Development and the second half of her route.
    
    **Miyako:** ...Friends are your equals... How could I forget that?

    **Marluxia:** Larxene did that.  
    **Axel:** Well, what about that plane that got hijacked?  
    **Marluxia:** _You hijacked that plane_.

    **Marluxia:** That was, and still is Zexion.  
    **Axel:** Wow, we're assholes.
    
-   _Bobwhite_, during a summer story arc, Cleo realizes, "I'm such a terrible employee that I made a child cry."
-   In _Darths & Droids_, the PCs have always been skirting the border between merely Off the Rails and Obliviously Evil, casually trashing the GM's carefully scripted story and messing things up far worse than they were initially. The GM loves to point this out to them, but it isn't until #454 that Pete finally gets it. His reaction subverts the trope: "So we're the bad guys now? Cool!"
    -   Played a little more seriously in #571, where Anakin slaughters the younglings. Jim can no longer sympathize with Anakin. In this continuity, he's probably right.

-   _Erfworld_: Parson arrives at this fairly quickly after arriving (what with his side having all the classic evil minions like dwagons, gobwins, twolls, and giant spidews), but gets chewed out by his new boss and told that the whole "Good Guys/ Bad Guys" concept is just stupid. Comes up again after the climax of the Battle of Gobwin Knob, when the full impact of his plans and actions (tens of thousands of Erfworlders are _**dead**_) hits Parson and he has to wonder how much he was influenced by the spell that summoned him and how much by his own free will and genuine desire to command a battle.

-   In _Exiern_, While Typhan-Knee has some good reasons to hate Theresa (like Theresa's prejudice against Typhan-knee's people), she also hates Theresa for several bad reasons: they are both under a Gender Bender spell (and Theresa sees it as a positive because she was transexual before the change), the guy Typhan-Knee tries to tell herself she's not in love with seem interested in Theresa, and they (Typhan-knee & Theresa) are equally bigoted against each other's cultures. After Denver give her the appropriate "What the Hell, Hero?", Typhan-knee finally realizes she's just as bad as she claimed Theresa was.
-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   Parodied:
        
        **Agatha:** And _I'm_ the evil mad girl with the death ray and the freakish ancestors — and the town full of minions — and the horde of Jägers — and the homicidal castle full of sycophantic evil geniuses and fun-sized hunter-killer monster clanks _and goodness knows what else—_

        **Agatha:** —And you know what? _I can work with that!_
        
    -   In fact, multiply parodied: Baron Wulfenbach gets a few lovely moments too — mostly in the vein of knowing he's the "bad guy" and being all right with that. He's not really the bad guy — but his "heel" turn happened because he was drugged and dragged out of his continent, only to find upon his return years later (and with a new son in tow) that the Heterodynes have vanished, their base was annihilated, zombie-like people are running rampant, and the few nobles alive who still have power are engaged in petty squabbling instead of banding together to fix the utter chaos. The Baron quickly gathers all the allies he can, makes all the death rays he can, and just starts killing everything that is killing something else, until everyone finally bows to his rule. He's one of the only two reasons that the continent has general peace, and the other reason was a woman who made a Heroic Sacrifice to stop the zombie threat from being _worse_ than it had. It hasn't stopped the world from _considering_ him an evil tyrant, but at this point, he's stopped _caring_ what anyone else thinks.
    -   At one point, Gil Wulfenbach goes into a huge rant about how he always tries to be a Nice Guy but all that does is make people think that he is weak and that they can take advantage of him, and so the only way he can ever make people listen to reason is by beating the crap out of them first. And then he realizes, to his horror: "This must be how my father feels _all the time!_"
    -   Tarvek has one while arguing with Gil, about using slaver wasps. _"Of course they shouldn't be used on Agatha! They shouldn't be used on any... oh."_
-   In _Homestuck_, Vriska Serket, who up until this point had been manipulating events in the B1 session, has one after killing Tavros.
-   Steward and Trinket in _Housepets!_ have an enforced one: When they come down from demon mode, it seems like all their rationalisations for their actions have come crashing down. This results in an overwrought "I'm a monster!" phase which even the people they were trying to kill are relieved to hear is temporary, although the understanding thus gained seems to last longer.
-   Though not a villain, _The Japanese Beetle_ had a moment where he realized he's a creep, and set about trying to become a decent person and a real hero.
-   Subversion: Cale'anon of _Looking for Group_ believes he has turned evil after killing a little boy and tries to act accordingly, but really, he isn't made of the right (or wrong) stuff.
-   In _MonsterLands_, The Destructor realizes that going out of his way to start random fights with strangers is a bad idea, as seen here
-   _Poppy O'Possum:_ Between the Fantastic Racism against opossums and her desire to keep peace in Eggton, Petunia Quibble starts the series determined to run Poppy out of town. She changes her mind after confronting Poppy over her past sins when she discovers, via an emotional outburst from Poppy, that the latest one before coming to Eggton was the result of Poppy's daughter being injured. When asked about it later, Petunia admits she _had_ been against Poppy from the start, but that outburst helped her realize that Poppy was a person, one who'd had it rough, and she was on the verge of becoming the next villain in her life.
-   In _The Specialists_, Hartmann, trying to convince the Specialists they can trust him, tries to convince them of this: he tells them that he, the erstwhile Nazi, hates the Nazis -- and himself.
-   In _Strong Female Protagonist_, Alison has a long conversation with her ethics and aesthetics professor in which she attempts to come to terms with her decision to assault and kidnap someone she didn't like, then force him to use his powers to help save a great many lives. Except that over the course of the conversation she finds herself increasingly unable to escape the truth: she didn't do it to save those lives, she did it to save her friend. And that her attempts to portray him as the most selfish and horrible person she's ever known are projecting her own guilt onto him, given that she's lost friends because of her selfish behavior in her earlier years (not to mention her acquaintances with mass murderers and villains bent on world conquest).
-   _unOrdinary_: John is able to justify his attacks to himself by seeing himself as the victim and everyone else as beneath him and complicit in his own suffering due to his society's power based hierarchy, which encourages the strong to lord their power over the weak. Even when he decides that he's a monster, his conclusion is "So what? Everyone is else is just as fucked up as I am!" When he's finally forced to face that he's attacking and endangering people left and right, despite many of them genuinely being decent people instead of faking, he breaks down completely.
-   _It's Walky!_: Sal's fall from grace has led her to retrieve an Amplifier Artifact which she is poised to use to destroy about 2/3rds of the world with. Walky brings her back from the brink by presenting her with her ex-boyfriend Danny, who is the only person she will still let herself care about. Her tough-girl persona collides with her desire for Danny to think well of her and she collapses into a crying heap in Danny's arms. Afterward, she becomes The Atoner for the next few story arcs, resolving to willingly serve out her prison sentence despite her superpowers meaning she can escape whenever she wants. Her Heel Realization is illustrated by having Sal's hair, which had fallen over her left eye and covered it during her entire Dark Action Girl phase to illustrate how she wasn't letting herself see everything going on around her, falling away from her face as she sees and recognizes Danny's presence.
-   _xkcd_: "Listen to Yourself" uses a "Troll Realization" variation on the theme.
-   _Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal (2022)_: Occurs in issue #7 when Ziggy Pig abruptly realizes that his Frame-Up scheme has turned him into a villain.

-   Throughout _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_, the titular Villain Protagonist has been a villain in name only, mouthing Well-Intentioned Extremist slogans but too meek to actually do anything really bad. Then comes the challenge from the Evil League of Evil to which he aspires: commit a heinous crime or die. It's not until the very end, when his inability to pull the trigger on his Arch-Enemy Captain Hammer has led directly to the death of his love interest, Penny, that he realizes that the murder will be attributed to him, and thus he _is_ now a villain for real. His final song, "Everything You Ever", is a triumphant dirge simultaneously celebrating his ascension to true Evil and mourning the loss of his soul.
