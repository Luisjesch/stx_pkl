_"Ah ha ha, I put broken glass in your dinner, dear_  
_It's only getting worse from here."_

The act of sneaking inedible or dangerous objects, such as glass, poison, drugs, etc., into an item of food or drink, with the hope that it kills/harms whoever has the misfortune to consume it. As such, it also covers deliberately adding an otherwise harmless ingredient to which the intended recipient is known to be allergic.

The _non-lethal_ version of food tampering would be putting a love potion, sleeping potion/drug, etc. in food or more commonly, drinks; also known as Slipping a Mickey. Another less fatal prank is switching the victim's usual drink with Blazing Inferno Hellfire Sauce or Gargle Blaster. A Laxative Prank is also fairly common. Well-intentioned tampering can also administer a remedy to a patient either unaware of their ailment or unwilling to take the cure. Attempting to do this to several different people at once can overlap with One Dose Fits All.

A variant of this trope is Medication Tampering.

When done with drugs to a large group of people, it's Everybody Must Get Stoned

It is common for the perpetrator to be a waiter/chef and the victim to be a rude customer or food critic who made the perpetrator angry.

If the perpetrator is unlucky, his plans may be thwarted by a Poisoned Chalice Switcheroo.

A character who suspects that the trope is going to be played on him might react with a Discreet Drink Disposal or Discreet Dining Disposal.

Compare Revenge Is a Dish Best Served, when someone puts something gross (but non-fatal) in food or drink to get back at someone (usually a grumpy or bossy customer). Clean Food, Poisoned Fork is when the means of eating the food is tampered for the same effect. Tainted Tobacco is where the poisoner tampers with the victim's smoking material rather than their food. Faked Food Contaminant is when one does this to benefit themself.

Compare the larger scale Water Source Tampering, usually perpetrated by conspiracies and such.

Razor Apples and Slipping a Mickey overlap with this trope. Weaponized Allergy is appropriate when the added substance is safe for most people, but intended to hurt a single person who happens to be allergic. The Master Poisoner is highly likely to practice this art. Lethal versions are often Tricked to Death.

For a milder example, see Trojan Veggies, which involves tricking a child into eating vegetables by hiding them in a different food.

    Real Life 

-   Often referred to colloquially as "slipping a Mickey" (or Mickey Finn) into a drink. In theory, Mickey Finn is supposed to be one specific poison (chloral hydrate, an anaesthetic drug that leaves the victim with the mother of all hangovers if they survive), but the expression is often more loosely applied to any poison in a drink.
-   Women are warned often to not leave their drinks unattended, due to fear of date rape drugs being placed into them. These are also a good reason not to pick up an unattended drink at the kind of place this might happen (e.g. a frat party). More than a few male revelers have accidentally found themselves taking a drink intended for someone else. Also, some delinquents of both genders often slip sleeping meds in the drinks of their dates not to rape them, but to steal whatever they have on them. In Russia, it is somewhat common for prostitutes to rob their johns in such a way. Their drug of choice for that is clonidine, an anti-hypertensic drug known there as clopheline — which in combination with alcohol reliably knocks even a large adult man out, and may even kill if they are not careful with the dose.
-   The Roman Emperor Nero had a particularly devious twist on this: When he wanted to kill his stepbrother Brittanicus, he didn't poison the wine, as he knew that the food tasters would detect it first. Instead, he served hot wine at the banquet, then poisoned the cooling water instead.
-   In 1990, an employee at the Point Lepreau nuclear plant in New Brunswick<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  poured some tritiated water<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in the staff's drinking water. Apparently, he was trying to play a practical joke, by forcing people to give daily urine samples for an extended period. The joke didn't go over too well. In 2009, a "disgruntled employee" pulled the same stunt in the Kaiga nuclear plant in India. Must be something in the water<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   To quench his thirst when he was out giving speeches in beer halls, Adolf Hitler always sent a trustworthy SS guard to seek water in the kitchen to avoid this.
-   In World War II, food shortages in Germany meant that food waste was universally recycled as pigswill, including the leftovers from POW camps holding allied prisoners of war. Naturally, as soon as the inmates at Colditz Castle discovered this, they took to liberally seasoning their table scraps with shards of broken razor blades, despite the German authorities loudly threatening death to anyone they caught in the act.
-   The modus operandi of Black Widow and Serial Killer Anjette Lyles. She killed two husbands, a mother-in-law, and her eldest child via first giving them food with high doses of arsenic-based poison, then slipping them more poison while taking care of them.
    -   A nearly identical mode of operation was used by Blanche Taylor Moore, who would ultimately be charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of first husband James Taylor<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (whose demise was first thought to be a heart attack) and boyfriend Raymond Reid (initially believed to be from Guilian-Barre syndrome; a seldom-fatal ailment) via arsenic poisoning, along with the attempted murder of her last husband, Rev. Dwight Moore, who survived the poisoning attempt; eventually being convinced in Reid's murder and sentenced to death in early 1991<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ; and in addition has been the subject of suspicion in the death of her father (reportedly to have died from a heart attack; with apparently no evidence having surfaced to dispute the initial reported cause of death).
-   Antifreeze is one of the most commonly used chemicals to poison people. Not only is it easy to obtain, but it also has a sweet, syrupy flavor (due to the ethylene glycol in it) that doesn't raise suspicion if mixed in with sweet-tasting food or beverages.. until they drop dead from heart failure.
    
    There are two variants of antifreeze, the other based on _propylene_ glycol, which is almost exactly similar, but non-toxic. It's somewhat more expensive and trickier to use (it oxidizes into mildly corrosive lactic acid on contact with air, and tends to foul up quicker), but can sometimes be _more frequently_ encountered nowadays, specifically because it's so much safer than ethylene glycol<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . So the enterprising poisoner might find their plans unexpectedly failing. Oh, and antifreeze ending up mixed with food or drink is a dead giveaway of criminal intentions. It is also very easy to detect, and there is basically no possible innocent explanation, so using this method of poisoning is impractical anyway; it makes it very obvious that the victim was murdered, and the only realistic shot someone has at a defense is if there is someone else who could also have done it.
    
-   "Aunt Thally" Caroline Grills went undetected in her poisoning tea with Thallium of four family members until she tried to get another. She was part of a rash of women poisoners in '50s Sydney.
-   Thallium was also used by one of the few serial poisoners in the late Soviet Union, Tamara Ivanyutina and her family, who used Clerici solution<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  they obtained from an acquaintance under the guise of rat poison to add to the food they later gave to everyone who (as they perceived) slighted them, or whose death might become a road to material wealth. Ivanyutina was slowly poisoning her husband, and had already poisoned his parents, while her elder sister was already an accomplished Black Widow at the point they were finally caught after several children and adults died in the school Ivanyutina was working as a dishwasher.
-   Poisonous mushrooms of the _Amanita_ genus (the most famous of which is _Amanita phalloides_ or the Death Cap mushroom) are known for their good taste and innocent appearance concealing a deadly poison that will destroy your liver in a matter of hours. Thing is, it affects only the liver — that nausea and diarrhea you get six hours later isn't your GI tract trying to purge itself of the poison, but rather the first symptoms of acute liver failure. They've been used in assassinations for centuries because they'll fool a food taster and the six-hour latent period between administering the poison and the first symptoms appearing gives the assassin plenty of time to slip out unnoticed. By the way, you can live for several days without a functioning liver, in great agony, until you finally succumb to ammonia poisoning. People who were (accidentally or deliberately) killed by Death Caps include the Roman Emperor Claudius, Charles VI of the Holy Roman Empire, Pope Clement VII, etc.
-   In European courts in the Medieval and Early Modern periods, it was common to offer guests/hostages (the dividing line is often rather slim, Decadent Courts being what they are) boiled eggs and bone marrow, along with any other dishes, the idea being that since eggs and marrow are cooked in the shell/bone, they would be impossible to tamper with. Of course, _actually eating_ the (safe) eggs and marrow, rather than the (theoretically poisonable) other dishes, was a grave insult since it would be an outright accusation that your host/captor was trying to poison you. (There is little recorded on prisoners who ate both the egg/marrow and the other food; presumably, that simply signaled general gluttony.)
-   In 1984, the Rajneesh cult attempted to take over the government of Wasco County, Oregon with a bioterror attack on its largest city, to make non-Rajneeshee voters get sick and stay home on election day so the votes from Rajneeshpuram could carry the election. They sprayed _Salmonella_ cultures onto the food in salad bars in 10 restaurants. The bioterrorists also spiked the water glasses of two county commissioners with _Salmonella_. Seven hundred fifty-one people were afflicted with gastroenteritis, and 45 of them were hospitalized. The plot failed when non-Rajneeshee voters rallied to the polls on election day. While the culprits of the poisonings were exposed, many of the restaurants that were sabotaged ended up closing.
-   Exploiting the "randomly poisoned Halloween candy" urban legend mentioned above, Ronald O'Bryan killed his son in 1974 by putting poisoned Pixy Stix in his candy bag. For verisimilitude, he also put the candy in the bags of his daughter and three other children trick-or-treating with them. The motive was collecting on the insurance policy he took out on his son. He was convicted and eventually executed.
-   Because of this trope, it's generally why you should be careful when accepting food and other edible objects, especially if it's free and from strangers.
-   In Fall 2018, Australia suffered from numerous incidents of strawberries with needles in them, followed by copycat incidents such as also doing it to mangos.
