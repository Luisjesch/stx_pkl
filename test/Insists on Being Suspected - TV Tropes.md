During an effort to identify a killer, a traitor, The Mole, or some other unsavory individual, a character specifically raises the possibility of _themselves_ being the culprit. They may simply be that intellectually honest, or want to impart to the other characters that _no one_ should be considered Beneath Suspicion.

That said, this isn't an actual confession; a character who indulges in this trope does not claim that they _are_ the culprit, they simply acknowledge that they shouldn't be trusted solely on their word.

Can show up in Spot the Imposter or Everyone Is a Suspect situations.

Compare False Confession and Taking the Heat. Contrast The Scapegoat.

-   _Harry Is a Dragon, and That's OK_: Harry's natural magic resistance, the only weakness being his eyes, means he can break the Imperius Curse just by blinking. However, Professor Moody talks to him after class about the risk of a Dark Wizard simply casting the curse on him and ordering him not to blink, so he'd still like to test Harry's ability to resist it. Harry thinks it over, but decides he'd like one of his friends to be present, and Professor Moody gives him house points for being Properly Paranoid.
-   _With This Ring_: When Paul discusses with team leader Aqualad the accusation they've received that there is a mole on the team, Aqualad wants to keep it quiet and investigate everyone covertly, to avoid everyone suspecting each other or tipping the mole off.

It later turned out that he _did_ do it.

-   _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_:
    -   In case 1, Maki reminds Kaede that everyone—including her—should be considered possible suspects for the murder.
        
        **Maki:** ...Am I a suspect?  
        **Kaede:** Oh, no! That's not what I meant—  
        **Maki:** You should suspect me. In fact, you should be suspicious of everyone.  
        **Kaede:** Huh?  
        **Maki:** Someone got killed right after we all gathered here. The timing is too perfect. \[...\] So trust no one, Kaede... Or you'll lose, got it?
        
    -   In the same chapter, Kaito calls out Shuichi (the insecure Ultimate Detective) for excluding him from the list of suspects without a good reason.
        
        **Shuichi:** Ah, don't worry... you're not a likely suspect...  
        **Kaito:** Hey, that's not something a detective should say!  
        **Shuichi:** What?  
        **Kaito:** If you suspect me, you better pursue it to the end. Investigate until you're satisfied. If you don't do that, you'll never reach the truth. Rantaro will have died for no reason. This is where you need to let your **Ultimate** talent shine!

    **Ange:** I am your ally. And an enemy of witches. ......Of course, you don't have to believe it. No one can prove that I really am your ally. On the contrary, it's more desirable that you keep your guard up strongly enough to find me very suspicious. \[...\] I'll offer you advice in a way that works to your advantage. Of course, you shouldn't swallow everything I say. Because no one can provide certain proof that I'm your ally. So I don't need you to unconditionally trust me. You might as well take my advice as nothing more than an opinion to be considered.
