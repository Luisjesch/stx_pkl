_"No cow ever died for a nobler cause."_

There's a reason we call the trope "Draco In _**Leather**_ Pants". There's something about tanned cow hide (or its synthetic or plant-based equivalents) that's cool and extremely sexy to many people.

Leather's badass associations originally stem from leather being the garb of choice for bikers, who wear it for practical reasons (leather is tough and offers some protection against road rash as well as from the elements). One of the quickest ways to show that someone is badass or sexy in a "bad boy/girl" way is to dress them up in shiny black leather. Heroes will typically wear a leather jacket or Badass Longcoat, while villains will more often wear something skintight, with undertones of BDSM.

It _will_ be _black_ leather the vast majority of the time. Other colors just don't have the same effect in most cases, though white and red do sometimes work, as does the traditional brown. For increased badassery, have the black leather lit by a mercury-vapor lamp: Black leather, deep green highlights.

This is also a common trapping of historical epics and fantasy, as clothing made from leather is percieved as being more old-fashioned and primitive. All kinds of leathery gear is also presented as armor, since it looks cool, can be put together pretty easily by the costume department, may be less uncomfortable for actors to wear than the alternatives, and is well-accepted by audiences thanks to decades of The Coconut Effect. There are real examples of leather clothing and armor in certain times and places throughout history, but Hollywood Costuming is par for the course. The popularity of leather clothing and armor in a historical setting is often hugely exaggerated; designs may be anachronistic or completely fictitious; and modern forms of tanning and coloring may show up. Furthermore, items made from soft or flimsy pieces of leather are treated as armor when they'd do nothing to resist blades or arrows in real life. Actual leather armor was often thick, heavy, and specially treated to harden it. Not exactly your casual leather jacket.

This trope often manifests in the form of Badass Longcoat, especially in military settings. See also Spandex, Latex, or Leather, Pretty in Mink, Dominatrix, and Leatherman. Compare its polymer sister trope, Dressed All in Rubber.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Former Badass Biker and now Troubled, but Cute Riki wears a leather jacket and pants in _Ai no Kusabi_.
-   A surprising amount of characters in _Battle Angel Alita_, starting from the heroine herself and Zekka, even though they technically don't really need clothing _at all_, most of them being Hollywood Cyborgs. They usually wear it for its sheer badass appeal — there's the definite correlation between the amount of leather and general badassitude of the character in the series.
-   _Deadline Summoner_ has Mamoru's Werewolf, who dons a leather jacket and not much else.
-   Naomi Misora and Mello in _Death Note_. Interestingly enough, Word of God says that Mello ended up dressing like that because the artist put him in clothes that he likes drawing.
-   Archer of _Fate/stay night_ has some amazing pants. While his breastplate is stated to be some futuristic alloy, the trousers look to be leather (that he purchased at a goth or fetish shop).
-   Edward Elric from _Fullmetal Alchemist_ is never seen without his leather pants and occasionally even leather jackets. He's regularly mocked for his tacky taste and gaudy fashion sense.
-   Motoko Kusanagi in _Ghost in the Shell: Arise_ is decked out in a red leather jacket, red leather pants, and red leather boots. Likewise, her _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ version wears a black leather jacket in the first season and a black leather shawl in the 2nd. Her badassery is never in question, no matter what version of the franchise.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   In _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz_, Duo wore a leather jacket and matching pants.
    -   Kira Yamato often wear leather outfits as his civilian clothes, mainly in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_. They are usually complex designs with zipper sleeves and other strange styles.
-   Clair Leonelli of _Heat Guy J_ wears black leather pants. Like hats in Westerns, they contrast Daisuke Aurora's white jeans.
-   When Yuuta of _Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!_ was under the self-delusion of the "Dark Flame Master", this was his attire, complete with Too Many Belts.
-   Fate Testarossa of _Lyrical Nanoha_ has been fighting in a leather one-piece since she was _nine_. Before her mother Precia was first shown to viewers, many of them wondered why she let her child dress like that. Turns out that, besides being the worst mom ever, she _also_ dresses like that, and her device's most-commonly-used form is a Whip of Dominance, giving her a Dressed Like a Dominatrix vibe.
-   Nico Robin from _One Piece_ wore a very tight, very leather ensemble during the CP9 story, complete with grade-A length high-heeled leather boots. It's since become somewhat of an Iconic Outfit, still showing up in merchandise _ten years_ later.
-   Panty and Stocking's Lawful Evil Counterparts, Scanty and Kneesocks, wear leather during their Transformation Sequence.
-   Joe Asakura from _Science Ninja Team Gatchaman_ wore normal yet skintight clothes in the TV series, but he switches to leather pants and jacket in the OVA. Note that we only said "pants and jacket"...
-   Ban from _The Seven Deadly Sins_ typically dresses in red skintight leather attire.
-   In _Tokkô_, all members of Tokko wear leather jackets and pants except for Ryoko, who wears a standard police uniform.
-   Tsume in _Wolf's Rain_ appears to wear a ripped leather jacket and pants. Of course, that's just part of his disguise (look at the title again).
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Takahashi seems to love this one. Surprisingly enough, though, it's mostly his _protagonists_ that wear leather. Hell Kaiser Ryo in Season 2 of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ plays it straighter than most.

    Comedy 

-   Andrew "Dice" Clay wears a leather jacket as part of his greaser delinquent look.

    Comic Books 

-   As revived by Grant Morrison, Animal Man is a vegetarian animal rights activist who generally averts this trope, but after his family is murdered he suits up in a leather jacket from his punk rocker days to avenge them. Their deaths are later undone by the author, if you're worried.

-   The Black Cat wears a figure-hugging bodysuit of black leather.
-   The Blackhawks are a classic example. Zinda Blake, aka Lady Blackhawk, continues the tradition in _Birds of Prey_.
-   Chassis Mcbain's racing suit in _Chassis_. It's not specified exactly what it is made of, but it certainly appears to be leather.
-   The Batman Who Laughs from _Dark Nights: Metal_ wears this flamboyantly, including spiked visor goggles, several straps, and a set of chains. Compared to his previous suit which is made out of kevlar, his outfit seems to be unsuited for active combat, no less protective enough for him, but not like it matters to him because he's the goddamn Batman (and half-Joker).
-   Ghost Rider wears a leather jacket. From Danny Ketch version on, spikes are also part of it.
-   Grendel Prime in _Grendel_ is literally covered from head to toe in black leather, including his face. This is to hide that most of his body is artificial.

-   Jason Todd/Red Hood wears a leather jacket most of the time, to help illustrate his edgy "bad boy" persona.
-   Pizzazz from _Jem and the Holograms (IDW)_ hates many things. Four of the few things she "loves" are her cat, curly fries, music, and leather. While not exactly a "badass", Pizzazz is the lead singer in a metal band and is the rival of Jem. She has a Hair-Trigger Temper as well.
-   Most of the Front Line in _No Hero_ wear non-porous leather with special masks for protection.
-   _Planetary_'s Jakita Wagner. Black leather bodysuit with red trim. And a bit on the front she leaves unzipped at all times to expose some of her cleavage.
-   The Raven royal family in _Scion_ LOVE black leather.
-   Durham Red in _Strontium Dog_ is certainly fond of leather.
-   The most rebellious Superboy, Kon-El, wears a leather jacket, leather belts, and tea shades with his spandex in his first and second outfits. Kon-El is back to his more traditional personality and back in leather, now with more metal studs, as of _Young Justice (2019)_.
-   _The Ultimates_: The platoon of Giant Men use leather clothes while in giant size.
-   Negan from _The Walking Dead_, along with its television adaptation. Seemingly justified in that the leather he and the Saviors wear appear to be tough enough to withstand Walker bites, making such outfits incredibly valuable in the Zombie Apocalypse.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: After Artemis became the new Wonder Woman following the events of "The Contest" Diana returned to superheroing in a new costume, consisting of a black leather bra thing, jacket, leather shorts, short leather boots and leather gloves.
    -   Wonder Girl Cassie Sandsmark wore a leather jacket with metal studs and metal pauldrons on the shoulders along with goggles prior to joining Teen Titans, giving her a biker aesthetic in some of her many costumes, especially those that included jeans.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Amazing Fantasy_, the Prowler is decked out from head-to-toe in leather and is a master thief skilled enough to elude the likes of All Might, Japan's greatest Hero.

-   _Bait and Switch_: Eleya, a definite Action Girl, has among her civilian clothes a black Klingon-made leather jacket that cost her a month's pay as a lieutenant.
-   In _Child of the Storm_, Maddie/Rachel is referred to alternately as 'gorgeous-in-leather-trousers' and 'Death in Leather Trousers', wearing tight black leather trousers and a black trench-coat.
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_ addresses this, giving us a simple yet absolutely logical explanation for this fashion choice.
    
    "The simple answer is that people like the style. The complicated answer is 'fucking warlocks'. You know how them frockwearers are always finding new ways to use magic to make people's lives miserable? Yeah, one of those wiseguys a few hundred years back got the bright idea that, hey, there had to be a way to see through fabric to the skin below. There was. 'Nuff said."
    
-   _Mario Kart_ AU fanfic Firefly stars a human Bowser whose clothing tastes consist almost solely of leather and spikes, likely inspired by Nintendo's official designs<small>◊</small> and<small>◊</small> artwork<small>◊</small> for him.
-   _The Official Fanfiction University Of Middle-earth_ gave us Elves in Black Leather. (There's some fanart as well.)
-   Part of the Isuten Junior High uniform in _Pretty Cure Heavy Metal_, for both the boys _and_ the girls!
-   _Red Fire, Red Planet_: Pint-Sized Powerhouse Meromi Riyal, the Orion first officer of the IKS _mupwI'_, wears red and black leather. While in that outfit, she curbstomped Hopeless Suitor Norigom, a conscript from Rura Penthe, fast enough he had to watch the security feed to figure out what the hell happened.
-   _The Ultimate Evil_: Nataline "Nat" Homato, a Demon Slaying Action Girl, dresses in black and loose leather clothes.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_: According to Marik, the Pharaoh's power comes from his leather pants. He was half right — apparently, the Pharaoh gets his power from his leather shoes.

    Films — Animation 

-   During the Diary of Adam and Eve segments on _The Adventures of Mark Twain_, the brief glimpse at Adam and Eve's children shows Cain as an unruly biker.
-   Sunset Shimmer in _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_ always wears some form of leather jacket or vest, which has stayed consistent from her "bad girl" days as a villain to becoming a straight-up hero for Rule of Cool.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Austin Powers_: Mimi Rogers in skintight black leather. And her daughter (Elizabeth Hurley), since Mrs. Kensington is a Legacy Character.
-   _The Bank Job_: Both Femme Fatale Martine and Terry the heist crew leader are wearing leather jackets in their first scenes. Averted with Eddie, who also wears leather jackets but is the only member of the heist crew who has no criminal past, and spends the last act as a Distressed Dude.
-   _Bit_: Duke is never seen without wearing her leather jacket in the present. She's a badass lesbian vampire, and leads a group of them.
-   Late-night DJ Midnight Mark wears clingy leather trousers in _The Boat That Rocked_. Later lampshaded by Quentin.
-   Averted with Catwoman in _Batman Returns_, where her catsuit was made out of latex, vacuum-sealed to the point of discomfort, and coated with a wet silicone lubricant to create the illusion of sheen, and to hide the fact that the stitches were not stitched into the fabric, but glued on after the fact because latex is notoriously easy to tear (so much so that the production team had to make more than 40 catsuits). The closest practical way to make this costume is wet-look spandex, but Catwoman's solo film plays this trope straight, as the designers wanted to make it out of leather so it would be easier for commercial costume makers to reproduce.
-   In _Charlie's Angels (2000)_, Alex Munday (played by Lucy Liu) has a room full of computer nerds eating out of her palm thanks to her sexy leather powersuit (that squeaks every time she walks).
-   _Coyote Ugly_ is about a bar run by women who dance on the counter in tight leather pants specifically to pander to male patrons.
-   Heroic characters in _The Deaths of Ian Stone_ generally avoid leather, but the Harvesters seem to have realized its intimidation factor. Medea in particular really works it.

-   In _Eragon_, just about everyone of importance wears leather of some kind. This is extremely inaccurate. An Enforced Trope, in that the wardrobe production was given little time to make the vast number of costumes needed, and someone had bought large quantities of leather; since further expenditures weren't allowed, they had to use what they had.
-   Carla Rainer - the villainess in _Exception to the Rule_ - spends most of the movie wearing a black leather jacket and gloves. As might be expected for a psychotic female assassin.
-   In the _Fantastic Beasts_ series so far, many of the Auror offices of different wizarding governments around the world favor leather in their uniforms - namely, leather trench coats, such as the ones seen on the MACUSA aurors and the aurors of the French Ministry of Magic.
-   _Fight Club_: Tyler Durden wears red leather and goes as far as to say that in an ideal world a man will own just one set of clothes for his entire life, made of leather. He's supposed to be a subconscious representation of the repressed protagonist's idea of masculinity.
-   Emmanuelle Seigner in _Frantic_, in deliberate contrast to suit-wearing Harrison Ford.
-   Once the protagonist of _Freaky_ has her body taken by a serial killer, the ensuing makeover is highlighted by a red leather jacket.

-   _Home Alone: The Holiday Heist_: Jessica is a burglar who wears leather pants and a leather jacket.
-   One of the most distinctive parts of Indiana Jones' wardrobe is his leather jacket, which was based on the A-2 flight jackets issued to World War II aviators. All of the jackets were custom pieces; the original jackets for _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ were made (over a long and arduous process involving many samples and design rights arguments) by Leather Concessionaires (along with a Wilson jacket worn by the stuntman who climbed under a speeding truck).
-   Aragorn in _The Lord of the Rings_ is rarely seen without his leather Badass Longcoat. Then he upgrades to one with the insignia of the White Tree in time for the final battle that's even _more_ badass.
-   In _Mad Max_, the titular hero Max Rockatansky and the rest of the Main Force Patrol wear head-to-toe leather, although by the time of the sequels his clothing is so worn it's more like a Non-Uniform Uniform.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   Johann Schmidt from _Captain America: The First Avenger_ seems to wear nothing but leather.
    -   The Cap himself has a pretty sweet bomber jacket, and wears one a lot during _The Avengers_. Peggy Carter also wears a leather coat. In fact, since the first film is a superhero movie crossed with a war movie, lots of people wear badass leather coats.
    -   Loki wears black (and occasionally blue) leather costumes, loose or skintight, in all five films in which he appears (_Thor_, _The Avengers_, _Thor: The Dark World_, _Thor: Ragnarok_ and _Avengers: Infinity War_).
    -   In _Thor: Ragnarok_, Valkyrie initially wears a black leather costume.
    -   The Ravagers of _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_ are Space Pirates dressed as Space Bikers in red leather. By extension, Star-Lord, who was raised by their leader Yondu, wears a jacket like theirs, as does Nebula once she spends time with the gang in the sequel.
    -   Both Black Widow and Gamora are fond of leather gear, the former crossing with Spy Catsuit.
-   _Masquerade (2021)_: Besides her fencing mask, Rose wears a leather jacket and tight-fitting black leggings for the second half of the movie.
-   Absolutely everyone other than Agents in _The Matrix_ dress in a combination of leather and latex. Originally the iconic Badass Longcoats were meant to be leather, too, but fabric moved better in Bullet Time.
-   The 1968 British-French film _Naked Under Leather_ (a.k.a. _Girl on a Motorcycle_) where the leather catsuit of the eponymous biker is openly played for fanservice.
-   The Serial Killer in _Night After Night After Night_ dresses in black leather and a Beatles wig when he goes out hunting victims.
-   _Pistolera_: Apart from when she is undercover, Pistolera spends the movie dressed in a variety of skintight, Stripperific black leather outfits.
-   _The Quick and the Dead_. The Lady has a nice set of leather pants, which are shown to good effect when Cort grabs her ass during the Wall Bang Her scene.
-   _Razor Blade Smile_: Leather is a popular fashion choice among vampires.
-   Velma in _Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed_ dresses in leather to seduce Seth Green's character. Played for laughs because she sounds like she farts when she moves.
-   _Spears_:
    -   Jeff the conman has a black leather jacket that becomes increasingly more tattered as he tries to distance himself from that lifestyle.
    -   Halfway through the film, Jeff and Cormac recruit Ashaki, a High-Class Call Girl to help them catch Vadik. She wears tight black pants and a purple jacket, both in leather.
-   Red is featured again in the Klingon dinner dress attire in _Star Trek VI_.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   Anakin Skywalker wears a leather tunic (actually more of a tabard, like medieval knights used to wear) and leather boots in _Attack of the Clones_, and in _Revenge of the Sith_ he wears a similar outfit but also has a leather gauntlet (to cover his prosthetic arm). To add to the coolness factor, his wardrobe goes from brown and black to almost all black, too. This foreshadows the iconic black leather and metal suit we all know he'll be wearing for the rest of his life by the end of the movie...
    -   Han Solo has apparently picked up on this trope for _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_, as he's shown wearing a brown leather jacket in place of his iconic black vest from the original trilogy.

-   The 2021 Irish film _Spears_:

-   _Terminator_:
    -   Arnold Schwarzenegger in every single movie — (stolen from a punk in the first, a biker in the second, and a stripper in the third).
    -   _Terminator 3_ also has a female Terminator in a red leather suit.
-   _Top Gun_ is credited with not only popularizing leather aviator jackets in the 1980s, but with the US Air Force begrudgingly reissuing leather flight jackets to its aviators (while the Navy depicted in the film continued issuing G-1 flight jackets with only a short pause from 1979 to 1981, the Air Force discontinued them in favor of cloth jackets in 1943 and only surviving jackets and cottage industry replicas survived into the 1950s).
-   Selene from _Underworld (2003)_ is why leather was invented.
-   Marlon Brando in _The Wild One_. In fact, that iconic image of Brando in the leather jacket is a big reason leather and badass became associated in popular culture.
-   The _X-Men Film Series_ is the Trope Codifier for Movie Superheroes Wear Black as leather vests replace the bright spandex from the comics. However, it was noted by the cast that, although it might not have looked as "silly" as the neon spandex of the source material, it was _not_ good clothing for action sequences, as they chafed and were really tough to move in.
    -   Wolverine is the best example as, besides the X-Men body suit, he often wears a leather jacket.

        -   Scott Summers' leather jacket is mostly artichoke green with some blue on the front.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_: In "The Separation", Rachel is split into "Nice" and "Mean" versions of herself. One of the first things Mean Rachel does is express disgust at her preppy wardrobe and head out to buy some black leather.
-   In _Autobiography of Red_, Bad Boy Herakles wears a black leather jacket.
-   _Every_ male character in J.R Ward's _Black Dagger Brotherhood_ wears black leather when fighting lessers.
-   Sherrilyn Kenyon's _The Dark Hunters_ series: Badass Army protecting the human world from things that go bump in the night.
-   _Discworld_
    -   When Greebo, Nanny Ogg's badass cat, is turned human in _Witches Abroad_ and _Maskerade_, he always wears leather and looks like a pirate.
    -   In _Soul Music_, the Dean falls under the influence of Music with Rocks in It, and makes himself a leather longcoat with "BORN TO RUNE" spelled out on the back in metal studs. He doesn't know what it means, it just seemed appropriate.
    -   Invoked but averted in _The Light Fantastic_, as the Lemony Narrator is very clear that Barbarian Heroine Herenna the Henna-Haired Harridan is _not_ dressed like "the cover of the more advanced kind of lingerie catalogue for the specialised buyer", instead opting for "light chain mail, soft boots and a short sword".
        
        All right, maybe the boots were leather. But not black.
        
-   The Doctor's companion Fitz, from the _Doctor Who_ Eighth Doctor Adventures, has a leather jacket. He also wears leather trousers once or twice.
-   Harry Dresden's distinctive, enchanted black leather duster comes up frequently in _The Dresden Files_, though the badassery of its leather is rarely explicitly stated. It _is_ brought up when Harry needs clearance to enter a decidedly shifty night club, but Thomas is able to get him in because he's "A man in a black leather coat."
-   Geralt is almost never seen out of his favorite leather jacket with _lots_ of silver trim and studs and matching pants. Somewhat justified in that leather indeed was a material of choice for combat wear in The Dung Ages, and silver is useful in his line of work, but we sometimes almost get to _hear_ Dandelion cringe at his friend's fashion sense.
-   Caine, the badass protagonist from _Heroes Die_ always wears black leather.
-   Arya from the _Inheritance Cycle_ wears black leather in combat, presumably for Fanservice. This may seem inappropriate given the characterization of elves as hardcore vegans, but then again they do make use of animals that die naturally (for example, an elf wearing a headdress of swan feathers gathered from dead swans and feathers swans had lost).
-   Jill Kismet wears leather pants for their abrasion resistance: blue jeans can get shredded when you move as fast as she can, thanks to her Deal with the Devil. It makes her ass look good, too.
-   Kate Daniels bought her black leather jacket in her teenage "bravo" days when she was deliberating trying to invoke this trope. Developing into a more mature, sensible adult doesn't stop her from wearing leather at every chance, though, because leather affords some protection from attacks.
-   A Downplayed Trope in the _Lensman_ series, where much is made of the uniform of a Gray Lensman being plain, utilitarian, drab, and, well, gray. But it's only mentioned in passing that it's a gray _leather_ uniform.
-   In her first appearance in Time Scout, Margo Smith is wearing a nigh-heart-stopping tight leather miniskirt. A character later describes her as "doe-eyed one second, hell-bent for leather the next".

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_. When Wesley makes his return as a "rogue demon hunter", he's wearing all leather. He has to change out of them though, as they chafe his... legs.
    -   And Illyria. Oh dear Christ, Illyria.
    -   Angelus's trademark is his leather pants, which Spike makes a hobby out of making fun of.
-   _The Avengers (1960s)_: Honor Blackman and Mrs. Emma Peel in her first season.
-   Parodied in one or more _The Benny Hill Show_ sketches. Benny plays an actor playing a bad boy dressed all in leather while filming a scene. Not only is it not sexy (cause, y'know, it's Benny Hill), the leather squeaks so much whenever he moves that it drowns out recording the dialogue, especially when he sits on a leather-covered chair.
-   _Billy the Exterminator_: Billy and Ricky will often wear combinations of various black leather clothing articles as part of their wardrobe, sometimes with spikes or studs. Billy once explained that the leather is thick enough to protect him from most stinging insects, and the spiked wristbands safeguard his forearms from bites.
-   _Blackadder_
    -   The second incarnation, Blackadder spends most of his series in head-to-toe black leather. According to Word of God, the entire female cast went "pwhoar" the first time Rowan Atkinson showed up on set in costume, including the very lesbian Miriam Margolyes.
    -   Rik Mayall also had his moment with this trope, appearing in season four in pilot's leathers.
        
        **Rik:** I mean, you don't think of World War I as particularly sexy, but when I put on the costume, the leather coat and the lariat and. It. Was. So. Sex. I mean, I was a walking penis!
        
-   Both heroes and villains in _Blake's 7_. Apparently, an S&M shop made the outfits, as they had the most experience in working with leather (there's a cute anecdote about the shopworkers frantically hiding the porn and the nipple clamps when Michael Keating (Vila) turned up for a fitting with his little daughter in tow).
-   If Booth isn’t on the job and wearing his suit, you’ll often see him sporting a leather jacket over his T-shirt in outdoor scenes on _Bones_.
-   Stormfront on _The Boys (2019)_ wears a form-fitting black leather suit with red trim. Given that she's a virulent racist and old-school Nazi (meaning that she's also Putting on the Reich) who murders people of color just for kicks, definitely a villainous example despite her public image.
-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_:
    -   The tough-as-nails, motorcycle-riding Rosa Diaz usually wears a black leather jacket. Hell, for a Thanksgiving dinner with a suit-and-tie dress code, she promises to wear her "formal leather jacket" ("it's the one without any blood on it").
    -   Jake Peralta's default outfit also includes a leather jacket, although he only _thinks_ he's a "bad boy".
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Vampire Willow.
    -   When Willow is worried that Oz is paying too much attention to the sultry Veruca, she dresses up in leather pants to seduce him.
    -   Buffy and Faith are both seen wearing leather pants and jackets on more than one occasion, especially Faith. Angel and Spike both go in for leather jackets. Angel also famously wears leather pants when he turned evil.
    -   _Especially_ Faith. And don't forget: Spike's leather coat is one he took off the corpse of a Slayer he killed. So maybe it **is** standard issue clothing.
    -   Spike and Faith prefer black leather jackets, but change to brown leather on occasions when they're trying to get in Buffy's good books.
    -   At one point Buffy in red leather pants and a black leather jacket fights Faith who also has a leather jacket on.
    -   Leather pants in the Buffyverse are colour-coded. We have the: Black Leather Pants of Evil (worn by Angelus, Faith, Vampire Willow, and Xander). Red Leather Pants of Righteousness (worn by Buffy). Green Leather Pants of Jealousy (worn by Willow). Pink Leather Pants of Enthrallment (worn by Buffy).
    -   Of course Glory is not above this, with the leather dress she's sporting in Family.
    -   This was lampshaded rather hysterically by Arizona filker Nancy Freeman, in the song called (what else?) "Leather Pants of Evil". They're from an evil cow.
-   _Charmed (1998)_:
    -   Humanoid demons would usually be seen in black leather clothes. In "It's A Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad World: Part 1", Phoebe and Paige go to a Mirror Universe where the Charmed Ones are evil, that universe's Darryl assumes they've been going undercover in the Underworld, which is good in this reality, due to the "bright happy colours" they're wearing.
    -   The episode "Ms Hellfire" sees a hitwoman trying to assassinate the sisters, and Prue then impersonates her to find out who sent her. She's naturally wearing a midriff-baring leather top and tight pants to go with it. Prue helps herself to two outfits from her closet - one being a Little Black Dress that also appears to be leather, and a similar set of leather pants and basically a black bra. In the latter, she gets a slow-motion Supermodel Strut in as Bane Jessup begins Eating the Eye Candy.
    -   The episode "Coyote Piper" has Piper being possessed by an evil being, who then pulls an Evil Costume Switch to tight leather pants and does a sexy table dance on the bar at P3.
-   Sarah dons a black leather catsuit in several episodes of _Chuck_. Fanboys were _very_ happy.
-   Britta Perry on _Community_ has an affinity for (and a seemingly endless supply of) leather jackets.
-   Max from _Dark Angel_ even had leather _PANTS_. Hell, the whole X5 Escapees group was hell-bent on wearing leather jackets.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Ninth Doctor's signature black leather jacket. It's a noticeably stripped-down, no-frills look compared to his predecessors, which says a lot about him from the get-go. Specifically, the jacket is a Kriegsmarine Jacket, but oddly enough, absolutely no-one bats an eyelid at him wearing the jacket of a U-Boat Captain in the middle of the _London Blitz_ (aside from Jack Harkness, who lampshades his bad choice of wardrobe).
    -   Several of the new series companions (Rose, Martha, Amy, Clara, and Yaz) wear leather jackets, though only Martha does so regularly.
    -   Parodied in "Smith and Jones", in which a "Slab" slave is supposedly leather all the way through. The Doctor's reaction: "Someone's got one hell of a fetish."
    -   The War Doctor also wore one similar to Nine's, except far more faded and beaten-up.
-   _Drop the Dead Donkey_. On seeing Helen's girlfriend — a lesbian motorcycle courier — Dave provides the above page quote, while Henry is ecstatic when she straddles her motorbike.
-   _Evil_: Kristen's mother Sheryl Luria regularly wears a leather jacket and leather pants, along with animal print tops. All of which may indicate a wild past.
-   _Farscape_. Just... _Farscape_. John and Aeryn's Peacekeeper uniforms (with more than a touch of the Reich), Jool's ab-baring corset, Scorpy's _gimp suit_...
    -   Was described as a "long, hot slog in leather" and Claudia Black has been known to say that all she needed to perk her up when she was tired or burnt out was for Ben Browder to walk in wearing his leathers.
    -   There is a reason Warren Ellis described _Farscape_ as "one American's descent into Australia's S&M scene" (aside from him being, y'know, Warren Ellis).
    -   In the DVD commentary for the third season two-parter "Into the Lion's Den", Ben Browder quipped that the costuming department bought up every scrap of black and red leather in Australia in order to make all the costumes for the Peacekeeper officers aboard Scorpius's Command Carrier.
-   _Flight of the Conchords_: Bret and Jermaine use the budget for their tour to buy matching black leather suits for themselves and Murray, but mixed with accidentally knocking over an amp, they suddenly gain a reputation as troublemakers and lose gigs. Then the suits get wet in the rain and shrink.
-   Ross on _Friends_ tries to look cool for a date by putting on tight leather pants. Then he goes to the bathroom and finds that he _can't put them back on_.
-   Lord Tywin Lannister from _Game of Thrones_ is so fond of black leather jackets that one might confuse him for a Soviet commissar. Similarly, Jaime wears a grey badass leather long coat.
-   This seems to be the standard attire along with the Badass Longcoat for Makai Knights in _GARO_.
-   Bad Janet on _The Good Place_, the Bad Place's Evil Counterpart to the Good Place's celestial assistant Janet (normally clad in vests, skirts, and floral blouses in bright colors), wears a black leather jacket and pants to go with her unhelpful, abrasive attitude.

-   Fonzie from _Happy Days_ is almost never seen without his trademark leather jacket. It's so iconic, it now hangs in the Smithsonian. When the show was entering production, executives were worried about having a character wearing leathers, believing the audience would automatically assume he was the villain - it was initially a requirement that he frequently be shown near his motorbike, in order to explain the wardrobe choice.
-   Future Claire in season 3 of _Heroes_ has quite the black leather ensemble.
-   When Ryu Terui first showed up in _Kamen Rider Double_, he always wore a leather pants/jacket outfit in either red or black. After defeating Weather, he switched to some kind of lighter material with leather patches on the shoulders and joints in red or blue.

-   The Mord-Sith in _Legend of the Seeker_ (and the _Sword of Truth_ novels) are a blatant dominatrix archetype. With Cara a main character in season two, every episode is chock full of skin-tight red leather goodness (and somehow even more cleavage than Kahlan).
-   _Life on Mars_: Sam Tyler wears a leather jacket, which makes a cameo in a late episode of _Ashes to Ashes_.
-   _Lucifer (2016)_: The demon Maze's wardrobe is almost exclusively black leather paired with the occasional corset and chains. She even wears a black leather dress for her wedding.
-   Lampshaded on _Married... with Children_ when Kelly gets dressed for her cousin's wedding.
    
    **Kelly**: Nothing says "Bridesmaids are easy" like short black leather.
    
-   _Once Upon a Time_:
    -   Emma usually wears a red leather jacket.
    -   Killian's entire outfit. When he gets a wardrobe change, he still has a leather jacket.
    -   Rumplestiltskin's leather pants have their own fanbase.
-   Sarah from _Orphan Black_ wears leather jackets, pants, and boots as part of her punk aesthetic.
-   Not by choice, but Neve Campbell's character Julia in _Party of Five_ is forced, along with the rest of the female wait staff, by her employer to wear a leather teddy while serving at a bar to attract customers.
-   _Paper Girls_: Mac, a tough and courageous tomboy, loves to wear a leather jacket.
-   Played for laughs in _Penn & Teller: Bullshit!_; when discussing animal rights group PETA, the titular hosts are adorned in all manners of leather clothing on their set.
-   Stella, _Project Runway_ season five contestant, sure loved her "leatha".

-   _The Rising_: Neve, a Badass Biker, liked to wear a long leather coat when alive.

-   _The Shield_: Vic Mackey is almost never seen without his signature leather jacket.
-   _Stargate Atlantis_ did this increasingly so as the series went on. By season five, virtually the entire main cast is wearing as their standard off-world outfits: black leather jackets (McKay, Keller, and occasionally Sheppard), black leather jacket and pants (Teyla), or black leather trenchcoats (Ronon). Then there's the Wraith...
-   Intendent Kira in the Mirror Universe on _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_.
-   Seven of Nine's first Borg catsuit on _Star Trek: Voyager_ — it probably wasn't leather, but it was plainly meant to invoke this trope.
-   Derek Hale in _Teen Wolf_. His beta wolves seem to be picking up this habit, too.
-   Cameron from _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ has a leather jacket. You really don't want to steal it from her.
-   In one episode of _That '70s Show_ Kelso gets a leather jacket because he wants to look like Brando in _The Wild One_. Instead, everybody laughs at him for looking like Fonzie. When he throws it away in anger Hyde puts it on and immediately becomes irresistible.
-   Eric Northman from _True Blood_ appears to wear a different leather jacket in every single appearance (when he isn't stark naked or wearing a tracksuit). This is especially notable as he wears the _exact same_ singlet and jeans every episode. Most of the vampires fall into this to some extent; justified in that a guy in a t-shirt and shorts isn't very seductive or intimidating, same with a girl in a flowery skirt.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In "Black Leather Jackets", Scott, Steve and Fred wear the titular attire as part of their disguise as Greaser Delinquents.
-   _The Vampire Diaries_ gives us Damon Salvatore, who is the king of this Trope. Stefan tries, but somehow it doesn't have quite the same effect.
-   The Classy Cat-Burglar Alex on _White Collar_ is known to wear a black leather jacket and leather pants pretty often.
-   Z Siggy Sobotka in _The Wire_ celebrates his payout from stealing a crate full of cameras on a $3,000 Italian leather coat which never gets him the respect or admiration he expects. His coworkers hate him for stealing and flaunting his money, and Cheese is nonplussed by the pricetag and says not even a black man could style the coat to look good.
    -   Jimmy McNulty, the Loveable Rogue of the Baltimore Police Department is often wearing his dark brown leather jacket.
-   _Wizards & Warriors_: Seldom has black leather and studs looked better than on Evillll Prince Dirk Blackpool. But it just doesn't work on his brother Prince Geoffrey.

-   Alex Krycek of _The X-Files_ is rarely seen without a black leather jacket. It's rarely the same one from episode to episode, though, since they tend to get ruined when someone (usually Mulder or Skinner) beats him up.

    Music 

-   Black leather is almost an icon for heavy metal music, in particular for the New Wave of British Heavy Metal in The '80s. In particular, the band that popularized it was Judas Priest, and the Trope Namer is their song "Hell Bent For Leather" from their 1978 disc _Killing Machine._
    -   The best part: Black leather became iconic after Rob Halford decked out his band in BDSM fetish outfits and nobody got it right.
-   The name of the first demo by Metallica.
-   Saxon's "Denim and Leather".
-   In their early days, the Blue Öyster Cult tended to the leather look. (Check out the inner sleeve photos on _On Your Feet - Or On Your Knees_.) They had a substantial following garnered from two New York groups - gays and bikers. A stage look<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  that appealed to both was a no-brainer. Bass player Joey Bouchard recalls they got their stage leather from a BDSM boutique specialising in gay bondage.
-   Freddie Mercury wore a lot of it in the late 1970s, around the time of _Live Killers_.
-   Billy Idol's leather vest and blond spiky hair are iconic.
-   Bob Dylan mentions this trope by name in his 2012 song "Early Roman Kings".
-   Halsey mentions this trope in "Ghost":
    
    ''I don't like 'em innocent, I don't want no face-fresh
    
    Want them wearing leather, begging "Let me be your taste-test".''
    
-   Elvis Presley in his comeback special: _Elvis (NBC TV Special)_ (1968).
-   Michael Jackson on the cover and in the music video of _Bad_, and in red leather for _Thriller_.
-   "Leather" is also a Running Gag in Frank Zappa's oeuvre. He even named his triple album _Läther_ after it.
-   Patty Loveless in the video for "Lovin' All Night".
-   Cheryl Ladd when she performs "Just Another Lover Tonight"
-   Tanya Tucker on the cover of her album, _T.N.T_.
-   Glenn Hughes (no,not that one). He was the leatherman in the Village People.
-   Steelpreacher combines this with Spikes of Villainy.
-   Parodied in the "Weird Al" Yankovic song, "Young Dumb And Ugly".
    
    We wear black leather in the hottest weather  
    You can't imagine the smell!
    
-   Similarly, Mitch Benn's song "Stinky Pants", which on his radio series _Crimes Against Music_ he explains is about the fact Jim Morrison appears to be wearing the same leather trousers in all existing footage and photographs, and the difficulty of cleaning leather _assuming you even try_.
-   The Rolling Stones's music video for "Angry" has Sydney Sweeney wearing a leather corset and chaps dancing along to the song in the backseat of a convertible driving down a street.

    Pinballs 

-   The unnamed character in Bally's _Eight Ball_ wears a brown leather jacket, as befitting an unauthorized copy of _Happy Days_' The Fonz.
-   In _Rollergames_, Chuck Skull (the manager of the Violators) has this.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   New England-based promotion WAW Wrestling has a few examples who could count but the most stunning one would be 'Grimm', a violent gimp covered head to toe in leather fetish gear.
-   For much of his career, Adrian Adonis would wear a leather jacket and cap to the ring.
-   Sable would often be seen in leather catsuits, particularly around the time she did a Face–Heel Turn to become an arrogant primadonna.
-   Kevin Nash regularly wore leather pants in the ring, starting with his time as Shawn Michaels' bodyguard, Diesel.
-   Mona started wearing leather pants and corset tops near the end of her time in WCW instead of her usual Mini Dress Of Power.
-   Mandy Rose is rather fond of leather inside and outside the ring.

    Sports 

-   A downplayed example is featured with Canadian figure skater Nicolas Nadeau's long program costume from the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons. Only his right sleeve, right shoulder and two rectangular strips on his sides are made of black leather because it would be uncomfortable for him to compete in an all-leather outfit, but the material is included because he performs to a Depeche Mode medley, and the leather evokes the band's look during The '80s.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Leather armor is, fittingly enough, the armor of choice of rogue classes, especially in _Dungeons & Dragons_. Medieval leather armor actually came in two varieties: the less common type was similar to biker-style garments (which is probably what D&D et al are going for), and the more common one (_cuir bouilli_) was hardened by being boiled into rigid pieces and doesn't look or behave anything like leather clothing.
    -   Par for the course in the _Dark Sun_ setting.
-   The "Leather armor" card in _Munchkin_.
-   In _Vampire: The Eternal Struggle_, the Leather Jacket is an equipment card. It prevents all damage from a single attack and is then destroyed. By comparison, the Flak Jacket can be used every round, but only prevents 1 damage.
-   In _Warhammer 40,000_, leather jackets made from tanned Squig skin are the go-to armour choice for most lower-class Ork Boyz, because it looks tough and it does offer a bit of protection from primitive weapons like spears and arrows. It doesn't do much against most of the massively overpowered firearms of the setting, though, so if they get shot at, they drop like flies.

    Theatre 

-   _Elisabeth_: In the German production, after the casting of Mark Seibert, Death goes from Otherworldly and Sexually Ambiguous to this. The Takarazuka Revue productions follow suit, though the ambiguity remains because all characters, including Death, are played by actresses.

    Video Games 

-   Tequila Yuen sports a brown one and pulls it off. Maybe it's because he is Chow Yun Fat...
-   Rachel from _Ninja Gaiden_ is a Fiend Hunter who dresses in a revealing leotard of black leather.

-   All of Organization XIII in the _Kingdom Hearts_ series wear long, black leather trenchcoats. Perhaps this has something to do with their Draco in Leather Pants status among the fandom.
    -   Also, Riku and Vanitas play this trope... sideways with full bodysuits made of what looks to be _muscle tissue_. Whether muscle counts as leather is left as an exercise for the reader.
-   Etna from _Disgaea_ has an outfit composed primarily of black leather... though she's not wearing a lot of it.
    -   In _Disgaea 4_, Fenrich: black leather pants, a red leather jacket, and not much else.
-   Haken Browning from Super Robot Taisen OG: Endless Frontier. His outfit is a black leather trench coat. He is ridiculed for complaining of overheating during the group's journey through East Elftale.
-   _Fallout_, after _Mad Max_ above. Complete with one arm missing.
    -   _Fallout 3_ has Leather Armor, along with Motorcycle Helmets, both of which have gender-specific variants.
    -   _Fallout 4_ has the cyborg assassin Kellogg, renowned and feared throughout the Commonwealth and some parts of New California and the Mojave for his brutal methods. Unusually, he wears a dark brown coat instead of black. Although, given how old Kellogg is, the coat could have been black when he started his career all those years ago.
-   _Full Throttle_
-   _Angel Devoid_, with a really badass-sounding walkloop to boot.
-   Psycho Mantis. The man is a villain, true, but given that his personal outfit is a few yards of leather away from being a gimp suit does help solidify his place as one of the most badass bosses in all the games. An interesting example in that, going by his death scene, he abhors sexuality.
    -   In _Metal Gear Solid V_, Big Boss gets a sleek motorcycle jacket with the Diamond Dogs logo on the chest. You can craft it and wear on missions as Venom Snake.
-   A lot of the characters in _Brütal Legend_, but the Fire Barons, Zaulia, and Tainted Coil are standouts. The Tainted Coil is noted in the history found during gameplay to have dug up the Titans' old cars and motorcycles just to get the leather!
    -   This trope especially applies to Lita Halford, who wears a sexy outfit that consists of a midriff-baring, cleavage-enhancing leather halter top and skin-tight leather pants.
    -   Special mention to the Baron leader who is modeled after (and voiced by) Rob Halford, the man considered as having brought the leather fashion into Heavy Metal culture.
-   Ezio Auditore of _Assassin's Creed II_ back in his younger years wore leather pants that left only a bit to the imagination. It is actually Lampshaded by one of the bystander dialogues.
-   K' and Kula Diamond from _The King of Fighters_.
    
    **Flustered Lady**: Such _tight_ leather pants.
    
-   Albert Wesker of the _Resident Evil_ _used_ to wear just normal-looking combat gear in the first game and _Code Veronica._ However, he shows up in 5 wearing head-to-toe black leather _complete_ with a leather Badass Longcoat, just in case the viewer still wasn't completely sure about his alignment.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Sephiroth of _Final Fantasy VII_ fame, in black. His Gackt-Expy rival Genesis from _Crisis Core_ shops at the same place, but goes for red.
        -   Vincent Valentine wears some kind of leather suit, which is partially covered by the big red cape.
    -   Squall Leonhart from _Final Fantasy VIII_ has his famous black leather and lion fur jacket and matching pants. On the opposite side, The Rival Seifer wears a white leather trenchcoat.
-   _Soulcalibur_'s Voldo seems to have attended the Psycho mantis School of Fashion. "Siegmare" wears leather pants as well, but he's far easier on the eyes, even with a freak arm.
-   The Dark Queen from _Battletoads_, to the max.
-   Aside from her Badass Cape, Karst's outfit in _Golden Sun: The Lost Age_ is mostly black and red leather. Like the above Etna, she's not exactly wearing a lot of it.
-   Travis Touchdown from _No More Heroes_ is well known for his red leather jacket. He also has an entire closet filled with all different kinds of other leather jackets as well.
-   An option in _Dwarf Fortress_, but not very effective compared to proper metal or even bone armor. One use for it is being one of the easiest ways to provide cheap armor for civilians or more expendable militia-dwarves. Given armor doesn't wear out like clothing does, and the fact that dwarves get unhappy about running around naked, leather armor can mitigate the need to constantly replace tattered clothes.
-   _Star Trek Online_: As befitting a Proud Warrior Race, the Klingon wardrobe has a lot of leather in it, including bi-colored Painted-On Pants and armored corsets for women. The pants are also available Fedside, and most of the free Starfleet uniform jackets have what seems like a leather texture (though it could also be some form of armor weave).
-   While not entirely obvious in-game, Ganondorf's armor in _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ is stated to be made of leather in concept art seen in _Hyrule Historia._
-   The Wasp in _Avengers Academy_ wears a leather motorcycle jacket for her first two outfits, and later upgrades to a full-body Spy Catsuit.
-   _Persona_:
    -   Tatsuya Suou in _Persona 2 Eternal Punishment_ wears red biker leathers.
    -   _Persona 5_: Multiple members of your Phantom Thief, Eldritch Abomination\-fighting Badass Crew wear customized leather biker jackets and pants, including Ryuji Sakamoto, Makoto Niijima and Futaba Sakura.
-   Because it's set on a world with rich animal life but sparse civilization, leather is extremely important in _Rimworld_, as a source of clothing and for other constructions like armchairs and animal beds. The hides of the game's most powerful animals (rhinos, elephants, megasloths and thrumbos) can be turned into dusters that are tougher than a flak jacket and can be preferable even to power armour.
-   In _Splatoon_, standard wear for the Octarians' elite Octoling troops includes a tight black leather ensemble that exposes their midriff. The Octoling protagonist in _Splatoon 2_'s Darker and Edgier _Octo Expansion_ DLC goes even further by ditching the extra chest armor worn by standard Octolings.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_: For a Player Character who's of the Nosferatu vampire variety, the various clothing and body armor sets look like more and more elaborate leather ensembles with Too Many Belts, culminating in a full-body gimp suit.
-   In _Ensemble Stars!_, the default outfit for Undead features black leather jackets with a fur trim and leather pants, in keeping with their cool, badass image. Many of their later event outfits also feature a lot of leather.
-   _Like a Dragon_: Goro Majima's standard outfit throughout the series consists of black, steel-toed leather shoes, black leather pants, black leather gloves and a snakeskin jacket (and no shirt underneath).
-   Christie from _Dead or Alive_ has an outfit that consists of a black leather bustier, long gloves, fishnets and thigh-high boots.
-   Clementine gets a red motorcycle jacket as a farewell gift at the end of _The Walking Dead: Season Three_. It's also featured on the promotional materials for and flashback sequences in _The Walking Dead: Season Four_. In the game proper, however, she ditched it for a jean jacket instead.
-   Due to the rockerboy/rockergirl subculture being an important part of the _Cyberpunk 2077_s setting, plenty of people tied to the movement feature some leather accents in their outfits.
    -   Johnny Silverhand wears leather pants.
    -   Kerry Eurodyne wears a leather vest with studs, a spiked band on his arm and mid-calf leather boots.
    -   In the sidequest "A Like Supreme", Nancy will wear an oversized leather jacket.
    -   The fixer Dino used to be a rockerboy and still dresses like one, wearing a flashy leather vest with many studs.
    -   V can also wear many leather clothes in a similar style that can be bought or found in the world.
-   _Witchfire_: The player character, called the Preyer, is dressed head to toe in brown leather, with the occasional metal accents, such as adornments to his coat, belt buckles and his signature skull mask. As can be seen here, he sports leather boots, pants, a duster, gloves and even a capotain (the stereotypical witch hunter hat), giving him the Coat, Hat, Mask setup.

    Webcomics 

-   Several characters from the Cyberpunk webcomic Aqua Regia are shown dressed this way, but it's most prominently shown with The Protagonist, wearing leather clothing even in his civilian life, before becoming a mercenary.

-   Flash from The Bug Pond constantly wears a leather jacket.
-   In _Miscellaneous Error_, the main feature of Jack's Limited Wardrobe is a leather Badass Longcoat.
-   _Girl Genius_: Von Pinn, lampshaded in this exchange:
    
    **Von Pinn:** I teach restraint.  
    **DuPree:** Oh, so your dressmaker's an A+ student then.
    

    Web Videos 

-   Benedict from _Warlock Games_ is an interesting aversion: although he wears leather, he leaves the one fight he helps in abruptly and eventually dies offscreen.

-   Angry Joe, the most Hot-Blooded member of Channel Awesome, sports a trademark leather jacket that grants him Sith-like powers.

    Western Animation 

-   June the Bounty Hunter from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_.
-   _Dorg Van Dango_: Jet is a unicorn whose human disguise involves a leather jacket and overall greaser look.
-   The Lead Eliminator in _The Fairly Oddparents: Wishology_. No surprise, since he's a parody of the Terminator.
-   Episodic character Sigmund the Sorcerer from _Fanboy and Chum Chum_.
-   Vanessa Doofenshmirtz in _Phineas and Ferb_.
-   Spinelli and Butch in _Recess_ both wear black leather jackets.
-   An episode of _Sabrina: The Animated Series_ Sabrina and Chloe are sent inside a video game dressed in costumes that are an obvious parody of Xena and Gabrielle.
    
    **Chloe:** I think we're bad girls now.
    

    Real Life 

-   Jim Morrison. This was memorably deconstructed by Mitch Benn in the intro to his song "Stinky Pants":
    
    "Given that Morrison seems to be wearing the same pair of leather trousers in every picture there is of him, and given how difficult it is to clean leather properly, assuming you even _try_, I don't imagine you'd have wanted to stand downwind of the Lizard King."
    
    -   Those pants, which allegedly _were_ the same pair for a while, are now proudly displayed at the Hollywood Hard Rock Cafe. Thankfully, in a glass case.
-   Gerard Way from My Chemical Romance used to wear leather jackets until they fell apart. See above for speculation on how bad Jim Morrison's pants smelled.
    -   "I have a leather jacket that could turn your stomach..."
-   Joan Jett is a good female example of this- she's frequently seen in leather pants or jackets, or head-to-toe leather outfits. (Though if the leather flag sticker on her guitar is any indication, this may be more than just a fashion choice.) However, in recent years, she has switched to fake leather, as a result of going vegan.
-   Many metal artists, including Trope Namer Rob Halford with a similarly titled Judas Priest song. Ironically, Halford himself prefers pleather so as not to sacrifice innocent cattle, and the song title itself was originally used in the theme to _Rawhide_, though these days it's more associated with Halford and Judas Priest than anything else.
-   Red Commissars and Chekists of the Russian Civil War era. Their uniform included a black leather peaked cap (replaced with a red headscarf for female commissars), a black leather jacket and jackboots. Particularly Ksanka in the Soviet action movie _The Crown Of The Russian Empire, or The Elusives Again_.
    -   The crew of Trotsky's personal armored locomotive train wore red leather outfits — military-style jackets, pants, jackboots, and hats that looked sort of like ushankas.
    -   Younger panzer crews in Nazi Germany, particularly in regiments that were formed in the middle to late war years, were fond of wearing U-boat crew leathers.
        -   Both of the above had practical considerations, as both train crews and panzer crews were working with hot machinery that could probably set cloth on fire. Plus it really did look pretty badass. So... yeah.
        -   Many steam-locomotive crews wore either a jacket or a vest made of thick black leather, to aid in protection from inclement weather in the open cabin and from searing-hot metal parts. Knowing how dirty one gets when dealing with coal dust and also how dirty is the job of lubricating the running gear of the locomotive with grease guns and oil dripper cans, they were worse than Jim Morrison.
    -   Sappers of the French Foreign Legion wear leather aprons, carry axes and are allowed beards as seen here<small>◊</small>.
-   Los Angeles-based clothing designers Lip Service are quite fond of this, as it's been their longest-running line for about 15 years.
-   Early aircraft pilots wore fur-lined leather jackets for warmth, and this was continued with practically every air force through World War II issuing leather jackets.
    -   The US Army Air Force began issuing the famous A-2 flight jacket in 1927 and they quickly became a status symbol among American military aviators to the point where non-aviators (including infantry) would do anything they could to get one, all the way up to buying replicas made by local European cottage industries. They were discontinued from issue in 1943 in favor of cloth jackets but issued replacements and unofficial wear kept them going in the US Air Force into the 1950s. The Navy never stopped issuing their leather G-1 jacket except for a brief period, however, and the release of _Top Gun_ is credited with the Air Force reissuing new A-2 jackets starting in 1988.
-   Suzi Quatro. Especially here
-   Buzz Bissinger (the guy who wrote _Friday Night Lights_), apparently.
-   Safety-conscious motorcycle riders often elect to wear what amounts to a suit of leather armor, often with layers of kevlar or carbon or other very tough material to protect them when they fall off the bike (commonly expressed in the phrase "Cowhide, not my hide"). Bikers in general seem to like leather and less safety-driven ones may still wear a leather jacket or vest with leather boots simply because it looks awesome.
-   Slash has worn leather pants for decades. In his book he explains they serve a practical purpose: When you piss yourself in leather pants they don't get soaked and you don't get a chill. He also had his original felt top hat wrapped in black leather to keep it from falling apart.
-   The Iconic Outfit for Greaser Delinquents typically involves a black biker jacket, usually Perfecto-style.
