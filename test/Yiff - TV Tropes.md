"Cute" is a strange word. On one hand, you have "cute" as in Fluffy Bunnies. On the other hand, you have "cute" as in Playboy Bunnies. And in the gripping hand, you have yiff.

In a nutshell, yiff is furry porn.

About 99% is produced by the Furry Fandom, who invented the word (which makes sense). WikiFur seems pretty confident that some furry fan named Foxen invented the word, as part of a language called Foxish.

Foxish was an entire made-up language consisting of a grand total of nine words used for fantasy role-playing foxes. Yiff had the original meaning of doubleplusgood, apparently. The word comes from the onomatopoetic rendering of the sound that a happy fox makes. The word became a catch-all for sex acts in the furry fandom somewhere along the line, though it also became a classification of artwork used to specifically refer to any artwork of both an anthropomorphic and adult nature.

It should also be noted that while cartoon porn is considered a fetish known as _schediaphilia_, there is currently no distinction between more common cartoon porn fare and yiff art within fetish classifications.

Note that the actual term _yiff_ is largely a Discredited Meme at this point; it might occasionally be used in private conversations, but expect to get laughed or derided out of the virtual room (by furries, no less, which is saying something) if you use it in a serious — or sexual — context.

No examples, _please_.
