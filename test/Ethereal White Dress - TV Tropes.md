_"Very tall they were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave and beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and the hair of the Lady was of deep gold… but no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of their eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the wells of deep memory."_

This figure is either metaphorically or literally dead, dressed in pale clothing that marks them as having one foot on the Other Side. While this character is rarely a classical ghost (see Cute Ghost Girl or Bedsheet Ghost for more typical ghost depictions), they are symbolically associated with death, often being stuck in the past. It may be difficult to determine if they are dead or alive, or if they are human or spirit. Despite Light Is Good and White Is Pure, these ethereal characters may tend towards a more ambiguous morality. If the dress is stained with blood, better watch out.

Compare Mystical White Hair, Prophet Eyes, and Psychic Powers, which have similar connotations of "a connection to the otherworldly" for a character. Can overlap with Gold and White Are Divine if the otherworldliness is specifically heavenly or godly in nature. Contrast White Shirt of Death, where dressing in white foreshadows an imminent death. In this trope, the white-clothed character has already died, at least metaphorically. Also Undead Barefooter, Magical Barefooter or any other variation, because characters with this kind of dress sometimes ditch footwear. White Is Pure is a positive version as it means the spirit is free of sin and friendly.

This trope has its origins in the legend of the White Lady, a figure in ghost stories throughout the world associated with loss of a loved one or a sense of purity before death. Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl and Yuki Onna are similar legends from Eastern media.

Supertrope to Wight in a Wedding Dress.

Note: white clothing has many different meanings. This is a specific one, and examples should explain the symbolism associated with the character. See Tropes in White for other possible uses of white color symbolism.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Meiko "Menma" Honma of _Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day_. She's a Cute Ghost Girl, and she was wearing a white dress when she drowned and died. She even has white-blonde hair!
-   _Bleach_: Rukia Kuchiki's Zanpakutou, Sode no Shirayuki, is a pure white blade and possesses powers over snow and ice. Rukia's sword and power is based on the legend of the yuki-onna, the ghostly 'snow woman'. Her Bankai activation transforms her into the snow-woman of legend: her hair becomes white, her skin icy, and her dress snow-white. The world around her transforms into one of snow and ice, and she becomes a detached, mystical being that is possessed by an otherworldly beauty. In anime filler, her Zanpakuto Spirit is introduced long before her Bankai reveal and acts as foreshadowing: the spirit is a woman with white hair, very pale skin, and a snow-white kimono; she is quiet, well-mannered even when rebelling, is portrayed in a detached, mystical manner, and also possessed by an otherworldly beauty. Any female Arrancar who wears a white dress or robe would also qualify.
-   _Case Closed_:
    -   Horribly subverted in a filler case, where the woman In white is the actress Akiko Kinoshita... who only wears white clothes either when performing her Star-Making Role as the traditional "Yuki Onna" ghost, or when her lifeless body is found buried in the snow. She was murdered by Yoko Asanuma, her envious Body Double, who also briefly wears white while impersonating Akiko and making everyone believe she was still alive.
    -   In several openings and endings of the anime, however, Ran is seen wearing white dresses and playing the trope straight.
-   At one point in _Fairy Tail_ Erza Scarlet has a dream that she's dead and during the time she's wearing a pure white gown (notable one of the only times she wears white in the series)
-   Sawako of _Kimi ni Todoke_ dons a white dress, pretending to be a ghost during her school's courage test. Combined with her pale skin, black hair, and semi-creepiness/fierce determination to make her peers happy, she manages to look like Sadako.
-   In _Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms_, the Iorph traditionally wear plain white chiton-like robes with a few golden ornaments. This matches their nature as the Clan of the Separated, immortals who live apart from mortals and are destined to fade from the world.
-   In _Peacemaker Kurogane_, although male, Okita Souji plays the woman in white when out-of-uniform, using feminine speech patterns and invoking the innocence aspect of white with his cute pet pig and a fondness for sweets and playing with children. Of course, to those who know him, it's a double-entendre of sorts, with the death-and-mourning aspects of white evoking his deadliness as a swordsman.
-   _Princess Tutu_: The Wili Maiden, the ghost of a woman who committed suicide and now tries to bring young men into the afterlife, dresses in an all-white tutu with white tights. Of course, she's based on a character from a ballet that shares the name of the episode—"Giselle".
-   In _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_, the final episode shows 'Ultimate' Madoka wearing a white dress upon becoming the manifestation of hope to magical girls. Said character ends up being Ret-Gone from existence, making them metaphorically dead.
-   Sailor Cosmos from _Sailor Moon_ is a sailor senshi from a future where Chaos has destroyed nearly everything and she is the last hope. She transforms into Sailor Chibi-Chibi to assist Sailor Moon in the present to prevent her bleak future from occurring. Sailor Cosmos is actually Sailor Moon in the future. Her costume is all white, including her hair. Of course, this isn't the case in the anime.

    Arts 

-   _The Lady of Shalott (Waterhouse)_: As the legend goes, the Lady is going on this boating trip to her death. Symbolically this is represented by the stark white gown she wears in the painting.

    Comic Books 

-   At the end of the first issue of a _Birds of Prey_ series, an Asian woman in white called "White Canary" has shown up. Given her badassitude, two possibilities for who she is spring to Black Canary's mind: Cassandra Cain or Lady Shiva. Oh, Crap!...She turns out to be the sister of the Twelve Brothers in Silk, who Black Canary fought years ago, and in a bit of Fridge Brilliance, wears white in mourning for her brothers, who she killed to uphold their father's honor after their defeat.
-   After her death in _New X-Men_, Jean Grey ended up ascending to the White Hot Room as the White Phoenix of the Crown, doing things like repairing galaxies. During that time, she usually appeared in a white dress or white and gold variation on the Phoenix suit (this was actually the original design for the Phoenix costume until it was realised that the printing standards of the time just meant that text and colour on the other side of the page would be seen through it).
-   Secret of _Young Justice_ wears an all-white costume and a gray cloak. Fitting, as she's essentially a ghost.
-   _Ghost (Dark Horse Comics)_: The eponymous Ghost is a woman who was killed under mysterious circumstances and returns as a ghost dressed in white.

-   _The Wailing_: While investigating a crime scene, Officer Jong-goo meets a strange woman wearing a white robe who throws rocks at him and tells him that the strange Japanese man living alone in the woods is the culprit, before disappearing. She turns out to be some kind of local deity trying to protect the village against the stranger, who might be The Devil himself, to no avail.
-   _King of the Zombies_: The stately but silent Alyce Sangre is dressed all in white when she slips into Bill and Mac's bedroom. Her appearance is so sudden and so silent that Jeff mistakes her for a ghost.

    -   In the _Of Dungeons and Dragons_ arc of the sequel, one of the Undines appears in this form.

    -   In chapter 60 of the sequel, Jean and Maddie appear in Harry's mindscape wearing pure white dresses (their psychic forms having previously merged into a pure white gestalt), emphasising both their unearthly nature and purity. Here, they're unambiguously benevolent, doing their best to help Harry heal.

    Literature 

-   _Great Expectations_: Miss Havisham is an old woman who always wears her white, tattered wedding dress, and she rarely leaves her room. Her character is utterly defined by her obsession with the man who left her at the altar, and she metaphorically died that day, becoming old, bitter, and refusing to grow.
-   Both versions of _The Lady of Shalott_ take care to decribe the white garments the Lady wears before she gets on the boat, knowing she's on her deathbed:
    
    1833: A cloudwhite crown of pearl she dight,  
    All raimented in snowy white  
    1842: Lying, robed in snowy white  
    That loosely flew to left and right—

-   Ravenclaw's house ghost in _Harry Potter_, Helena Ravenclaw, known as The Grey Lady.
-   _The Woman in White_ by Wilkie Collins is a Victorian mystery novel, the plot of which revolves around a mysterious woman in white.

-   _The Ghost In The Third Row_ by Bruce Coville features a ghost called the Woman In White, an actress who had been murdered in the theater fifty years ago. The fact that the protagonists in the book were putting on the play of her origin story gets her attention...
-   Lydia, the mother of Rosilda and Arild and Carolin in Maria Gripe's _...och de vita skuggorna i skogen_ ("...and the White Shadows in the Forest") only ever dressed in white or black, depending on her mood (a trait she took over from her mysticist mother), and usually carried a bouquet of white roses as well. The "white shadows" Rosilda sees in the forest around the castle turn out to be Lydia, who is watching over her children after faking her own death.
-   Kahlan Amnell of the _Sword of Truth_ series. She is introduced as a very mysterious woman who is obviously very important, matching the archetype. It is later revealed that a white dress is the official dress code of the Mother Confessor, the most powerful woman in the Midlands.

-   Perdina and Voile Tricante in _Burying the Shadow_ both wear white all the time, helping their Creepy Twins image.
-   Lissar in her deerskin dress and white hair in, of course, _Deerskin_. The effect is enough to make people think she's not quite human, or even a goddess called the Moonwoman.

-   The elvish queen in _The Arts of Dark and Light_ wears a long white gown, and makes a mysterious, striking impression. Together with her pallor, light hair, serenity, and classical beauty, she reminds protagonist Marcus of some impossibly perfect statue of the ancient heathen gods somehow come to life.
-   Galadriel and her husband, Celeborn, are both noted for their white robes, in _The Lord of the Rings_, alongside their otherworldly qualities even by elven standards.
-   _The Grace of Kings_: The god Kiji sometimes walks the world as a man in a spotless white cloak — an incongruous detail when he's disguised as a grimy old beggar.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Supernatural_: There are all the girls in white nightgowns who get killed by the Monster of the Week, or the girl in the white hospital gown who caused people in her town to act out fairy tales...

-   The mysterious woman from _Ultraseven X_ is dressed in white most of the time.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   A mysterious woman wearing all white and credited only as "The Woman" appears in "The End of Time", giving mysterious messages mostly to Wilfred Mott. She is eventually seen among the Time Lords who turn out to be behind the near-disaster the episode is named for, as one of the two who voted against it. After the last meeting with her, Wilfred mentions her, and the Doctor looks significantly toward Donna. However, Word of God said she was originally planned to be the Doctor's mother - and that we should also pay attention to the _other_ Time Lord who voted against the plan.
    -   River Song, the mysterious woman hinted to play a hugely important role sometime in the Doctor's personal future, first appears in the two-parter "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead" dressed in a white spacesuit. She ends the two-part story dressed in a white gown.
-   _Smallville_, Season 10, episode 12, "Collateral": Chloe Sullivan returns, seemingly with magical powers, dressed all in white. As it turns out, the cast are actually trapped in a virtual world and her white-clad status indicates that she is hacking in from the outside.
    -   That version of Chloe Sullivan appears to herself in "Masquerade", but this time as an illusion of Desaad preying on her sin of Pride.
-   In _Merlin_, Prince Arthur sees the spirit of his mother Queen Igraine wearing a very, _very_ pale gold dress - it's practically white, and the costume colour was no doubt chosen to acknowledge the supernatural aspects of this trope.
-   The ghost in _The Stone Tape_ as she's dressed as a maid from the 19th century, which gives one character fleeing the ghost a nasty shock when he runs into a female character dressed in her Labcoat of Science and Medicine.
-   The ghost of Rosa appears in this in the second season of _Alta Mar._ Deliberately invoked by Cassandra as part of her revenge plan.
-   Merlynn's usual appearance in _American Gothic (1995)_. It's the dress she died in.

-   _Ultra Series_:

-   An episode of _Creepy Canada_ features Darke Hall, an allegedly haunted building on the University of Regina campus. One student sees the ghost of a young woman walking through the building in a white nightgown. This is also implied to be Jacob Marley Apparel; the building was once used as an infirmary during a typhoid epidemic, so if the ghost dates from that time, she could certainly have died in bed while wearing a nightgown.
-   _War and Peace (2016)_: Just before she commits suicide, Helene Bezukhova walks through a hallway wearing a sheer-ish white gown. She overdoses on an abortifacient, so the red blood around her legs stands out against the white of her sheets and dress.

-   In the music video for "Diary of Jane" by Breaking Benjamin, the titular Jane wears a white dress. She was Dead All Along.

    Myths & Religion 

-   The Youkai onryou (better known as the Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl) are always dressed in white, because a white kimono with its collar folded right over left is the customary way the dead are buried in.
-   The Ghost of Resurrection Cemetery - Justice, Illinois, USA. Supposedly the spirit of a young lady killed in the 1930s, who always appears dressed for a white dress party. When offered a ride she usually asks to be dropped off at the cemetery on Archer Road. When they get closer, however, she disappears. This, incidentally, has happened for decades and often still does, especially with people who are not from the city and do not know the story of Mary, as she is called.
-   Princesses of The Fair Folk often come in this form. They do not always have the protagonist's best interest in mind.
-   La Llorona, a Mexican myth about a crying ghost, is also called this. Just about every Spanish-speaking country has mythology related to La Llorona, even Spain. Generally speaking, though, the story is usually the same: she was a beautiful young mistress who tried to permanently win the heart of the man she loved by drowning her own children because she knew he wasn't all that fond of kids. It wasn't until he called her out on it that she realized how horrifying her actions were and promptly drowned herself in an effort to find her children. Naturally, she's a ghost said to haunt riversides calling for her children.
-   There is another myth about white-dressed women, it's about the Mulher de Branco (it means exactly the trope name), in Brazilian North / Northeast. She is the ghost of a bride that died (mostly killed) before entering the church to marry, and now, searches for her groom near the place she died, usually in a dark, creepy forest. If she finds a man she thinks is like her groom, she takes him to the world of dead with her... Unless said man runs like hell, which they promptly do.
-   A more recent one was "la rubia de Kennedy" ("blonde woman of Kennedy Avenue"). In The '70s, a young Chilean woman named Martha Infante died in an accident in said Avenue, and for several years, her ghost supposedly haunted the corner where she perished. The "ghost" was a blonde girl wearing a white coat who would ask for a ride, then tell the driver 'please don't drive so fast' and vanish.
-   Newark, NJ has a local legend about a lady in white haunting Branch Brook Park. Story goes that a car accident killed a girl while her boyfriend/fiance/husband/prom date was driving and she haunts the place to this day.
-   The standard description for female ghosts in the Philippines is a woman all in white with long black hair that obscures her face. Often believed to be virginal and the subject of a violent death (probably rape), she's commonly known as a "White Lady". It has been the subject of many horror films, including one appropriately entitled _White Lady_.
-   In Oberlin, Ohio, there is a story of a woman in white that haunts the lake in a local park.
-   In Bohemia, there's the legend of the White Lady, the ghost of Perchta of Rožmberk.
-   In the Netherlands, there are legends of Witte Wieven, "White Women". They're spirits of women who were kidnapped by other Witte Wieven. Depending on where the story is set, they're either Always Chaotic Evil or just want to be left alone. A version of the tale tells of a drunk farmer walking home through the forest when he meets a woman dressed in white, and he asks her to dance. Which she does, all night long, until daybreak rolls around and the farmer drops dead at her feet.
-   In Wales, there are many different legends of White Ladies or White Maids, variously called things like Y Ddynes Mewn Gwyn ("The Woman in White") or Y Ladi Wen ("The White Lady") or "Mor Wen" ("White Maid"). Some are associated with sacred stones, such as the White Lady who haunted the Sagranus Stone at witching hour, ensuring no-one crossed the bridge after dark. Others are associated with Nos Calan Gaeaf (Hallowe'en) or will be seen near cemetaries, castles, hill tops or sacred spaces, sobbing silently in the darkness for mysterious reasons. Some will punish badly behaved children or ask passers-by for help. One legend associated with Ogmore Castle tells of how Y Ladi Wen once led a man to a hidden cauldron of gold. Although he was permitted to take half, which would make him wealthy for the rest of his life, he sneaked back later to steal more. Y Ladi Wen cursed him with misfortune, causing him to fall gravely ill; he was left suffering and bed-ridden until he confessed to what he had done; only once he had openly admitted to his greed was he finally allowed to die.

-   In _Death Note: The Musical_, Rem wears white robes<small>◊</small>. She's a Shinigami.
-   Many adaptations of _Hamlet_ depict Ophelia (yep, that one) wearing a flowing white gown after she loses her mind from grief, highlighting both her innocence and how she's mentally 'checked out' of the world following her Trauma Conga Line, including her father being accidentally murdered by the man she loves. She wanders around the countryside, singing and gathering flowers, and eventually drowns; it's strongly implied it may have been deliberate.
-   Fantine in _Les Misérables_ is infamously known to fill this trope at the end of the musical. Her spirit comes to greet the dying Jean Valjean wearing the pure white nightgown she died in, making her appear truly angelic.

Some speculate that she is a spirit who wants to protect the granddaughters from meeting their Wolves, while others suggest she is a long-lost sister to the granddaughters or perhaps the grandmother herself. Curiously, while the Girl in White does indeed wear all white and is young, her skin tone and hair color are fairly dark.

-   In _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_, the Jedi Master Arren Kae was believed to be long dead, with her only legacy left to her daughter Brianna being her ornate white Jedi robe. According to Shrug of God she's Not Quite Dead, and has been with the Exile's party the entire time.

Standouts include Rhea of Thoroland, Gwynevere, Dusk and Gwyndolin from the first game, Nashadra from the second, and Irina of Carim from the third (with Filianore from the DLC). All of these characters are mystical, ghostly, and are seen pursuing a fleeting and hopeless quest before meeting a vile fate, though at least one outs herself as a deadly enemy beforehand.
-   Angel in _Sacra Terra Angelic Night_ wears one of these, as she is a ghost haunting the abandoned (and demon infested) Morbile hospital. As her name suggests, she guides the protagonist and uses her holy light to protect him from the influence of the demons you have to defeat to escape this place.

    Visual Novels

-   An unusual male example occurs in _Tales From the SMP_, where many mysterious incarnations of Karl Jacobs are found to be wandering the Courtyard of the Inbetween, the sentient hub world and dimension for Karl's time-travelling adventures. They all wear the white and gray version of Karl's outfit characteristic of being of the Inbetween. What classifies them as this trope is that these alternate versions of Karl have all succumbed to Loss of Identity from staying in and wandering the Inbetween, and are doomed to traverse the dimension for the rest of time, as their loved ones wait for a man who would never come home.

    Western Animation 

-   _Blue Eye Samurai_. The title character is often described as or compared to an onryou, particularly in "The Tale of the Ronin and the Bride".

-   People who want to enter into Yoruba and Santeria "priesthood" must wear white clothes for a full year (minimum) before being officially invested, the only color element being their necklaces. Albeit this is done for both sexes, but women stand out more.
-   Mary Queen of Scots was famous for her frequent use of white within her wardrobe. This is thought to be in part because she was often in mourning for either her father-in-law, mother, husband, or second husband, and in part that she looked very good in white (and apparently wanted to marry her first husband Francis in it, during a time when white was not commonly worn in weddings, red being the preferred choice, long before she entered her period of mourning).
-   Very common in reported Marian apparitions. I.e St. Bernadette Soubirous and the kids at Fátima (Portugal) initially reported seeing "a beautiful young lady all in white"; the people from Knock (Ireland) described Mary as wearing "a white cloak, hanging in full folds and fastened at the neck"; considering there were folk legends about terrible ghost women, it's no wonder their parents got upset, although some people figured Bernadette was seeing a harmless _revenant_ spirit.
-   Although it's well known that the Victorian era had a predominance of using blacks and shades of gray as mourning colours, what's less well known is that it had been traditional to wear white as a mourning colour. This started dying out during the Victorian era but continued to be a colour worn to funerals and to visit the graves of loved ones right up until WW1. However, Queen Victoria, who always wore mourning black while in Britain, would change to all-white attire when visiting France due to the tradition of white being the mourning colour of French royalty. White was resurrected for royal mourning in 1938, when Queen Elizabeth (née Bowes-Lyon, best known to us as the Queen Mum, or as Bertie's wife) was scheduled to make a visit to France five days after her mother's death. Norman Hartnell remade her dresses in a fortnight; they became known as the white wardrobe.
-   In Judaism, it is traditional to wear all white on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year when God is said to judge all souls and decide their fate for the coming year. In order to confront their own mortality, Jews simulate death by fasting and abstaining from bathing, wearing shoes, and having sex - wearing all white contributes to the symbolism. Some Jews take the trope even further by wearing the _kittel_, the pure white traditional _burial shroud._
