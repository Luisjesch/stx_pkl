Hair Colors are an easy way to distinguish one person from another at a glance. At times, it might drive a person to dye or even bleach their own hair to change its color (blonde is a common goal, due to the stereotypes of it being more glamorous). But some people aren't satisfied with just one hair color, their hair has to keep changing colors frequently. The new shade can be common, implausible, or even outright impossible. The changes must happen a number of times, and they may be justified by use of hair dye, or any sort of Applied Phlebotinum — up to and including actual magic (though it's not _necessarily_ a case of Magic Hair). It doesn't even have to happen to real hair, so characters who constantly swap wig colors come under this trope.

The color changes may pass without comment from others in the work, or drive someone up a wall trying to figure things out. Sometimes, even the subject of the changes might not appear to notice or care; in other cases, they might be pleased. The changes can be accompanied by a makeover, but this is less likely if they take place regularly or are a result of mood swings. Hilarity can ensue if the character hates what happens to their hair while being powerless to stop it.

This trope can occur in any medium, but some are more common than others (e.g. video game examples are near non-existent). Naturally, this includes Real Life, though due to the effects of repeated dyeing<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  most people don’t do it. Due to happening many times on a single person, it isn't a type of Expository Hairstyle Change. Usually.

Compare Kaleidoscope Eyes for the same thing in a different place. Of course, the two tropes may overlap sometimes. Compare and contrast Expressive Hair, when the hair changes style. Supertrope to Power Dyes Your Hair, where the color change only occurs due to a transformative power-up.

One of the Common Mary Sue Traits, along with being a way to give someone a Distinctive Appearance. See also Locked into Strangeness, for permanent hair colour changes. May be a result of someone just wanting to be special or Anime Hair. Voluntary Shapeshifters often have this, as can some depictions of teenagers, and it can also be a sign of an unstable or mentally ill character.

    Anime & Manga 

-   PAREO, a member of the band RAISE A SUILEN in the _BanG Dream!!_ franchise has multi-colored hair, which changes on daily base. Often used color combinations are black/white and pink/cyan. But other color combinations are used on special occasions, too.
-   Motoko in _Change 123_ has three Split Personalities. When she switches between them, many of her physical features change, including hair color.
-   When Light and L confront each other in _Death Note_, or meet each other on the street, Light shines a deep, blood-like red, and L an almost naval blue. Sometimes this appears as a tiny aura around their bodies, other times their hair and eyes glow that color. Their hair color can also indicate mood.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   In color chapters of the manga, Karin's fur is never the same color twice. This is never commented upon. (For what it's worth, he was based on a _black_ cat...)
    -   Bulma's hair also repeatedly changed color. The first few color chapters have her with purple hair, while later ones go back to the turquoise color that the anime used most of the time. For what it's worth, _Dragon Ball: The Path to Power_ and the manga's official full-color reprint both consistently depict Bulma with her original purple hair, indicating that this was what was originally envisioned for the character before Toei Animation pulled out their typical Adaptation Dye-Job.
-   Characters in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ are drawn with a variety of hair, eye, and clothing colors in official art, and Word of God says there is no canon color scheme for them. The anime depicts this by changing the color palette of characters and even the scene itself during many key moments, usually for dramatic effect.
-   Fujiko Mine of _Lupin III_, during four TV series, five feature films, and dozens of Made For TV Movies, has gone through various shades of blonde, brunette, and red. Sometimes it's as part of her role as a Master of Disguise, but it usually comes with no explanation other than Depending on the Artist.
-   This happens for no fathomable reason in _Quest Twilight Prince Prophecy Chronicals_. Donna's hair keeps changing from a grayish brown to full-blown pink, while Ebert's can be green or brown.
-   In _Saint Seiya_ and its various spinoffs, Gemini Saints subject to dual personality issues, such as Saga or Paradox, have this happen whenever the personality in charge changes. It also happens to Shun during the Hades Saga when Hades takes over his body.
-   Seika Higashiyama in the _Suite Pretty Cure ♪_ series has hair which is a different color in all of her appearances (sometimes it's even more than one color at once).
-   _Urusei Yatsura_: In the manga, Lum had full-blown rainbow-colored hair that shifted colors. As the manga progressed, Rumiko Takahashi changed Lum's hair color to green to match the anime, since it was changed there for ease of drawing. Green hair has been the standard for Lum ever since, even after the emergence of digital animation made it feasible to depict her original rainbow hair. The 2022 anime does add the effect of Lum's hair changing colors during the sunset or when she's using her electricity powers.

    Comic Books 

-   Midnighter of _The Authority_ supposedly constantly changes his hair colour. This is a mixture of Ascended Fanon and Ascended Glitch: because he was so rarely seen without his cowl, different colourists kept colouring his hair random colours in the very few panels where it was visible, and fans came up with the idea that he keeps redying it.
-   Rick Hunter of _Booster Gold_ has this and Kaleidoscope Eyes.
-   Delirium from _The Sandman (1989)_; her hair color changes depending on her mood. It's also multicolored at any given time.

-   Tank Girl's hair colour changes frequently, while rarely being anything that would naturally exist.
-   _Wonder Woman_: Circe is a witch who often tweaks her appearance and hair color, though in different periods has kept a certain color as her go to, such as in the Post\-Crisis era when her hair was normally purple, but she also tried out blonde, black, magenta and pink. These days, she usually keeps it red.

    Fan Works 

-   _Little Hands, Big Attitude_: Kaia's human form comes with blue-green hair that changes its exact shade depending in her health and mental state. The better she feels the more blue it gets. When Tom first meets her, when her hair was mostly blue but a large part had shifted to green, he assumes that her hair dye is wearing off.
-   The Parody Sue of _Nine Men and a Little Lady_ has changing hair colour; it starts as flame-red but both Sam and Boromir comment on how it changes, Sam even using the excessive adjectives common to Sue descriptions.
    
    _Myrishna (or was it Aelithea?) had eyes like stars,  
    Or maybe emeralds... or were they pale?  
    But her hair was like mithril!  
    Or night... or sunshine... or maybe ale._
    
-   _Queens of Mewni_': Venus the Fairest was born with latent magic that had everyone see Venus as their ideal beauty. As she grew older Venus was able to control her magic and allow her hair to reflect her mood. During the year after she Mercy Killed her mother, she had black hair. Most artwork of her, both In-Universe and out, depict her with rainbow hair, save three: one demonstrating what colors represent what mood she's in, one of her during her 'Black Venus' year, and one where she watches her (very young) daughter use magic to make a model of the universe, with her hair and eyes the dark blue representing fear.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_:
    -   In the later, "Marik's Council of Doom" videos, Dartz's hair changes color between almost every cut (as a parody of the below mentioned Coiffio).

-   Violet from _Ultra Violet 2006_, partially because of how the film is designed to resemble a comic book.
-   In _Werewolf (1996)_, Yuri's hair seems to change color and style in practically every scene due to poor continuity editing. The movie was cobbled together from shoots that happened months apart. And even when his hair _is_ the same, inconsistent lighting makes it look different.

    Literature 

-   Susan, Intrepid Reporter, from the _Archie Sheridan_ series, changes her hair color with each book.

-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Tonks often changes her hair color; it is usually a shade of bubblegum, but can turn ginger when she’s angry, gray for a disguise, or any number of other colors at her every whim. Justified as she is a metamorphmagus.
    -   Her son, Teddy, is also a metamorphmagus. Lupin mentions that Teddy had black hair when he was born, and it turned ginger by the time he'd left. Later in the book, he shows someone a picture of Teddy with turquoise hair.

-   In _Leia, Princess of Alderaan_, Amilyn Holdo frequently dyes her hair different colors. _Star Wars Adventures_ has her hair dyed in a rainbow of hues.

As shown by Siri's character development, it takes a lot of maturity and restraint to keep one's hair the same color for a long period of time.
-   One possible power in _Xanth_ is changing your hair color.

    Live-Action TV

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Oz dyes his hair so often it's difficult to tell what its natural color is.

    -   Anya tends to have a new hair color and style for every episode she appears in.

-   Enforced in _The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis_. Dobie's actor (Dwayne Hickman) was made to dye his hair blonde in order to distance him from a previous role. When the show was well established, he was allowed to return to his natural brown hair color; however, at times he had to go blonde again.
-   _The Mr. Potato Head Show_: In the reality TV episode, Queenie starts trying on various wigs, experimenting with different looks. One of them is neon orange!
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   Astronema of _Power Rangers in Space_ is best remembered for her original purple hair, but it didn't last: she changes its color and style very frequently without comment from anyone else. Mind you, before that, _Tommy_ was always changing _his_ hairstyle during his original run. (When it comes to later appearances, he's had the same spiky hair since the 10th anniversary special, breaking the new-season-equals-new-style streak.)
    -   _Power Rangers Mystic Force_'s Vida has black hair, but there's a streak of a different color that changes from one episode to the next. No indication it's anything other than dye.

He seemingly has Kaleidoscope Hair based on the lighting, length, and dampness of his hair. If it's short and slicked back, and he's in a not so well-lit room, it can look brownish. If it's short and slicked back, but the lighting is better, like in a WWE arena, then it can look like a redhead.

-   _Anon_ character Dani has gone by most of the colors and hairstyles possible.

    Webcomics 

-   K from _Blip_ has hair that varies from brunette to black to pink-ish over the course of the story. At first, it just seems like Art Evolution, until the other characters comment on it.

-   Barney from _Deadendia_ dyes his hair a different color every issue.
-   Ariel from _Drowtales_ can do this thanks to her innate shapeshifting abilities.

-   This happens to Nanase (whose hair turns black when her magic burns out) and Susan (when she goes through an angst-induced awakening) in _El Goonish Shive_.

-   Momo from _Questionable Content_ can do this. (She's a robot.)
-   In _Shinkutokimekisempukaku_ (or just _Shinku!_ for short), Leroy is drawn with a different hair color in every panel. In the first strip where this is evident, the author commentary explains that this is an exaggeration of the real Leroy's habit of frequently dyeing his hair. Similarly, Cary's hat shows a different icon on the front in every panel.
-   For a long time, Peejee from _Something\*Positive_ would have constantly changing hair, until Randy got tired of changing it.
