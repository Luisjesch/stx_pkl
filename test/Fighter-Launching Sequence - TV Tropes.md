"Emergency! Emergency! Incoming! enemy fighters! Prepare for launch!"

Rule of Cool insists that when a bunch of fighters (planes, spaceships, or even Mecha), go into battle, you always have to see them taking off first. _Always_.

There are several reasons for this. One is the _sound_ of the fighters starting up. There is something very evocative about fighter engines — the promise of power and danger right there in the turbine's whine (or the exhausts' roar). Science fiction versions of the trope will have the fighters make a very similar sound despite not running on turbine engines. This isn't always a case of Space Is Noisy (because they're probably still in the pressurized hangar) but it's definitely common.

This is closely related to Red Alert with its attending imagery of lights flashing and klaxons sounding as the pilots in their flight gear race for their fighters while the ground crew calmly preps them for take-off as their commander goes over the PA with something like "All fighters, **Scramble!**"

This can be combined with a Lock-and-Load Montage, with the pilots suiting up and flight crew loading the fighters with fuel and ordnance before they take off.

In anime, you always have to have the commander gesture impressively on the Bridge when they do this. In fact, this usually shows up in the Opening Credits.

Sometimes this trope is subverted, with the pilots attempting to scramble only to have their airfield or mothership disabled or destroyed before they can launch. That would be an example of Sitting Duck.

    Anime & Manga 

-   This trope dates back in anime to what is possibly the oldest surviving anime film, _Momotaro's Sea Eagles_. The cartoon is a Roman à Clef of the attack on Pearl Harbor, with cute puppies and monkeys flying the planes. The trope is played straight, as all the planes take off to attack Oahu—uh, "Demon Island." The monkey co-pilot of one particular torpedo bomber falls out of his plane while taxiing and has to run to catch up.
-   All the time in the various series used to make _Robotech_ (_Super Dimension Fortress Macross_, _Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross_, _Genesis Climber MOSPEADA_), complete with a Stock Footage unfurling of the tail fins from their storage mode.
-   The _Macross_ franchise as a whole has plenty of this.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ does this with its giant mecha.
-   Getting to the robots in _GoLion_, and therefore _Voltron_.
-   _Dairugger XV_, the series that became the vehicle-team _Voltron_, has the fifteen fighters that form Dairugger take off from their "aircraft" carrier at least Once an Episode.
-   Every _Gundam_ series (with the possible exception of _∀ Gundam_) has had at least one launch sequence.
    -   _Gundam SEED Destiny_ gratuitously abuses this — not only is there the launch sequence but the whole lengthy combination phase as well in which the four segments of the Impulse Gundam (three-piece Gundam itself plus the expansion pack of the day) meet up and combine. The full version of this sequence can waste upwards of three minutes. Considering the Troubled Production the show ran into, this was probably intentional to pad out time.
-   The title sequences to the various _Getter Robo_ series pretty much always include a scene with the three machines taking off and going through a tunnel.
-   The first opening sequence of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ did this using Nanoha and Fate in the place of planes and Humongous Mecha, complete with flight strip lined with lights and Hayate gesturing for them to launch. Humongous Mecha series disguised as a Magical Girl series, remember?
-   _Space Battleship Yamato_: The Black Tigers.
-   _GaoGaiGar_ doesn't bother showing GaoGaiGar and its components launching, even ditching the stock "summoning Galeon" scene early on, but it does show pretty much everything else launching regularly: HyoRyu and EnRyu, the Dividing Driver, the Pliers, the individual component ships of the GGG base, etc. etc. etc.
-   With both sides of the conflict in _Star Fleet_ having carrier ships that launch fighters, this tends to crop up in pretty much every episode.
-   A one-time example occurs during episode 14 of _My-HiME_, where an Amazon Brigade made up of most of the HiME is shown heading into battle against the season's Big Bad. Each of the girls (minus Mikoto, who just goes into a blind, screaming charge) emerges from an Elaborate Underground Base, summons her CHILD, and launches into the fray while a Theme Music Power-Up triggers in the background. Midori naturally lampshades it by yelling "TAKEOFF!" when it's her turn.
-   _Martian Successor Nadesico_ features a Hot-Blooded pilot yelling, "MANUAL LAUNCH!" and just running his Aestivalis out of the hangar on foot. This is directly lampshaded.
-   _Tekkaman Blade_ has a Stock Footage launch sequence every time the hero launches up to the space ring.
-   _Strike Witches_ most prominently uses this at the beginning of the second episode of the first season, where Sakamoto and the rest of the Akagi's fighters prepare for takeoff.
-   _Area 88_, which is set in a Quraci Legion of Lost Souls air force unit, has several of these across all continuities, usually sending the fighters off to attack some objective. Actual attacks on the eponymous base are relatively rare.
-   _Eureka Seven_ sometimes has Stock Footage of the Nirvash launching into battle, complete with Transformation Sequence.
-   _Sengoku Basara_ has Honda Tadakatsu who uses a launch sequence reminiscent to that of Gundam despite being in the Sengoku era and just wearing very heavy armor with jet packs and treads.
-   The _Full Metal Panic!_ anime has a scene several episodes into the first series where Kurtz and Mao launch their M9s off the catapult on the deck of the Tuatha De Danann. This sequence is repeated with the Arbalest in the opening credits of _The Second Raid_.
-   _Last Exile_ and _Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing_ have several, the straightest example being the Gracies rocket fighters' launch sequence, complete with lots of smoke and impressive booster jettisoning.
-   A one-episode event in _Science Ninja Team Gatchaman_ episode "Jumbo Shakora, the Ocean Devil King". It's the bad guys, launching from their latest mecha.
-   Happens several times in _Sentou Yousei Yukikaze_. The most prominent one is in the final episode when whole squadrons of planes are taking off from an Airborne Aircraft Carrier thousands of feet in the sky.
-   Episode 15 of _Aldnoah.Zero_ has a major space battle featuring this, complete with a Suspiciously Similar Song to Hell March 2 from _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2._
-   _Dragon Ball_ has this in the episode "Deep Blue Sea", featuring an extended Scramble filler sequence of General Blue's forces preparing to depart by air and sea.
-   The first episode of _KanColle_ includes such a sequence with Naïve Newcomer Fubuki launching into battle for the first time. Because this is her first live battle _ever_, she winds up stumbling out of formation, irritating the rest of her fleet.

    Films — Animation 

-   Used by both sides in _Battle for Terra_.
-   _The Iron Giant_
    -   "Mr. President, we've got a situation sir."
-   Invoked in _Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius_ when the kids take off in their spaceships crafted from amusement park rides, lead by Jimmy Neutron.
-   Done in _Planes_ as Dusty and the other airplane contestants are starting up and taking flight at the start line for the Wings Around the Globe.
-   _Wallace & Gromit_:
    -   Parodied and subverted in _A Close Shave_. Wallace uses a visual feast of overly-elaborate Technology Porn, a clear Affectionate Parody of the sequence from _Thunderbirds_, to get on a bike to go and clean windows. Gromit achieves the same end result by walking through a door.
    -   Then there's the very impressive rocket launch from the first film, which is played more like an actual rocket launch — complete with massive roar, blinding engine flare and slow launch before blasting into the sky.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Star Wars_:
    -   When the ships take off in _A New Hope_ to attack the first Death Star. The 1977 version showed the takeoff from a distance, with the fighters rendered as glowing dots. The 1997 Special Edition replaced these with CGI fighters.
    -   _The Empire Strikes Back_ with the Rebel Snowspeeders taking off in Hoth Base to fly off against the attacking Imperial walkers.
    -   _The Phantom Menace_ has the scene where the Nabooan pilots scramble their N-1 fighters to attack the Trade Federation battleship.
    -   _Rogue One_ has the scene where Rebel forces are being scrambled for the attack on Scarif.
    -   In _The Last Jedi_, it's subverted _horrifically_. As the Resistance are about to launch their fighters, almost all their pilots are killed and their fighters destroyed by a surprise attack on their hanger.
-   The opening of _Top Gun_ is a launching sequence. There are two additional abbreviated launch sequences, one in the second act (right before Goose dies), and one more in the climax battle.
    -   The opening is so iconic an edited version was used at the beginning of US Naval Academy home football games for years.
    -   _Top Gun: Maverick_ reproduced almost the exact same opening scene with a modern aircraft carrier and F-35s, and the exact same Kenny Loggins music. In the climax, Maverick and Rooster escape from enemy territory by stealing a F-14 tomcat and taking off from a reduced airstrip that was battered by Tomahawk missiles, only losing the front wheel.
-   _Tora! Tora! Tora!_:
    -   The scene where the Japanese aircraft took off from their aircraft carriers on their way to Pearl Harbor.
    -   And attempted by the Americans when the Japanese attacked their airfields. Most of the planes are destroyed on the ground before they can take off.
    -   There is one successful scramble by the Americans...in only two fighters.
-   Similar, done thrice in Michael Bay's _Pearl Harbor_.
-   In _The Rock_ when the plane meant to bomb Alcatraz takes off.

-   _The Final Countdown_ starts off with an F-14 Tomcat taking off from the Pearl Harbor airfield, and has many shots of Navy aircraft being launched off the aircraft carrier _Nimitz_.
-   _Battle of Britain_: _Well don't just **stand** there! Get them **up!**_
    
    -   Also features a subversion: throughout the film the pilots at the main viewpoint squadron are repeatedly shown trying to kill time while staying within earshot of the office with the telephone, because reacting to that buys an extra few seconds before the main alarm goes off. Near the end everyone is extra nervous, because the Luftwaffe should have launched their first raid of the day by now. The telephone rings, everyone jumps up... and it's just the canteen announcing that the Tea's ready.
    -   Another subversion comes in a scene in which the pilots are sitting in their planes ready for the order to take off.
    
    **Canfield:** The engine's overheating and so am I. Either we stand down or blow up. Now which do you want?
    
-   The transports taking off in _A Bridge Too Far_. The movie spends a significant time on this one, zooming in on the C-47 tow planes to show that they are piloted by officers and the gliders in tow to show that they are piloted by enlisted men.
-   Used repeatedly in _Transformers (2007)_ (another Michael Bay film — yes, he loves this trope). Each time airplanes are called for an air strike, the camera will cut from the battle taking place to show the air planes take off. Happens first when the A-10s are called in to attack Scorponok, and later, when the Secretary of Defense manages to get an air strike order out, we are treated to F-22 Raptors taking off. Both times the sequences are covered with voice-over of the operators giving the air strike orders.
-   The scene in _Avatar_ where nearly everything at Hell's Gate that can fly is mustered for the assault on the Tree of Souls. Notice the guy on the catwalk whose cap gets blown off by the propwash.
-   A (very) low-tech case could be made for _The Wizard of Oz_ when the Wicked Witch of the West sends her flying monkeys after Dorthy and Co, and we see the monkeys swarming in the sky from the window of her castle.
    
    **The Wicked Witch of the West**: Do take care of those Ruby Slippers! I want them most of all! Now fly, FLY! FLY, FLY!!..."
    
-   Subverted in David Lynch's _Dune (1984)_. As the Atreides troops become aware that their shields have been crippled, they run for their ships... which are blown up in their faces by Harkonnen bombers.
-   A brief sequence in _We Were Soldiers_ when Hal Moore calls a Broken Arrow, diverting all air assets in-theatre to help him: in addition to F-100s and A-6 Intruders taking off from land bases and carriers, there are shots of other aircraft already in-flight breaking off from their missions. Similar in spirit, but with transport Hueys instead of fighters, is the evocative sequence when the first lift leaves the base to go to the Ia Drang valley.
-   Done with B-17s in _Memphis Belle_ complete with an officer shooting a flare-gun to signal the launch.
    -   Okay, this is more bombers than fighters, but it still works as an example of the trope. _The Dam Busters_ does it even better with a long sequence of preparation for the launch of 617 Squadron on the historic raid, culminating in the flare gun, multiple engine starts and formation take-offs.
-   _Pacific Rim_ opens with the Beckett brothers suiting up and deploying Gipsy Danger.
-   In _Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,_ pilots on the Doolittle Raid take off from an aircraft carrier in B-25s, something that had never been done before. It led to this exchange between a pilot and co-pilot.
    
    **Pilot**: Raise the flaps
    
    **Co-Pilot**: (Looks) They weren't down.
    
    **Pilot**: Great. I wonder what _else_ we forgot.
    
-   1944 documentary _The Fighting Lady_ has more than one of these, real ones, as the pilots fly off for bombing runs against Marcus Island and Truk, and then go out for the huge Battle of the Philippine Sea.
-   _Midway (2019)_: Done several times over the course of the film, which is to be expected as one of the major settings is carrier USS _Enterprise_. The first one is a pair of SBD dive bombers taking off for Pearl Harbor the morning of December 7. They run into a flight of Japanese Zeroes. There are several more as various attacks and raids are launched against Japanese targets, and one that shows what happens when the ship isn't moving fast enough to provide enough headwind for a successful takeoff. The last major ones are as the strikes against the Japanese carriers at Midway itself are launched.

    Literature 

-   Throughout the _X-Wing Series_ there are pre-flight checks where characters sound off — "Red Flight, are we good to go?" "Red Two, ready." "Red Three, four lit and ready to burn." "Red Four, nothing's gone wrong yet." Then there's that scene near the end of _Starfighters of Adumar_ where Wedge gives a speech about purpose to the united Adumari nation, then has someone hit the air siren to get people in their fighters, tells Iella the two reasons why nothing is going to happen to him, and gets into the cockpit to lead them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Both _Battlestar Galactica_ series. Each have their Vipers housed in individual launch tubes as their thrusters fire for maximum acceleration as they roar out.
    -   Subverted in season one "Hand of God" the true attacking force is hidden nearby, rather than launching from Galactica
    -   Also subverted in the first episode. Starbuck is in the tube, prepping for launch when a fuel system malfunction is detected, and her Viper is ejected back onto the flight deck amid much cursing.
-   This trope is used in the shows of the _Ultra Series_. Often featured in opening theme sequences.
    -   _Ultraman: Towards the Future_ did this with the UMA fighter jets, in nearly every episode.
    -   _Ultraman Gaia_ featured the XIG fighters launching from their base in the series' opening sequence.
    -   _Ultraman Nexus_ featured the launching sequence of the Chrome Chesters in the series' opening sequence for the first 25 episodes of the series.
    -   The opening sequence of _Ultraman Mebius_ shows the Gun Phoenix taking off.
    -   The opening sequence of _Ultraman Tiga_ is mainly an extended launch sequence for the Artdesei, which takes flight just as the theme song swells into chorus. It's interspersed with short clips of other GUTS vehicles launching.
-   _Babylon 5_ launches fighters by having them drop out of the spinning space station. The follow on _Crusade_ uses a launch rail that extends out of the ship — slightly more compact but no less Rule of Cool.
-   _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century_. Every time Earth Defense Force fighters launched out of their tunnels, whether going into battle or not. It is preceded by a triangular light pattern that moves toward the fighter before launch, probably as a final safety diagnosis for the tunnel to confirm it safe for launching.
    -   The pilot actually subverted this - the outnumbered defenders of Earth saw the enemy ships fly out of their launch tubes only to explode. What they did not know was that our hero was roaming the launch bay shoving munitions up the Draconian ships' tailpipes.
-   _Batman (1966)_ again (the Adam West incarnation): "To the Batmobile!" followed by "Atomic batteries to power, turbines to speed..." (the latter appears as a Shout-Out in _Wing Commander III_, as the fighter start-up while waiting for the mission to load.)
-   _Power Rangers_, a LOT. Especially _Power Rangers Operation Overdrive_.
    -   This goes back to the series' _Super Sentai_ origins, of course, which heavily preferred vehicular mecha in the early years — the first one, _Himitsu Sentai Gorenger_, could do this with _a hot-air balloon._
    -   Early _Sentai_ also had mobile bases which carried their mecha... which first emerged from the heroes' main base. It's a good thing Transformation Is a Free Action, otherwise Tokyo would be gone while the second base was launching.
-   _UFO (1970)_: When Moonbase interceptors or Sky One launched to fight incoming UFOs.
-   An elaborate one in _Space: Above and Beyond_, in which the cockpits descend and attach to the bodies of the fighters before launch.
-   Just about every episode on _JAG_ taking place on an aircraft carrier will feature this trope in some fashion.
-   Not fighters, but the ending of the opening episode of _Band of Brothers_ has the paratroopers getting into the plane, the plane taking off, and then another and another, as the camera pulls back to slowly reveal the whole sky full of planes,and the fleet below, to show just how damn big the invasion was.
-   _World on Fire_: Episode 1x7 has a brief shot of British fighter planes taking off, presumably to take on the Luftwaffe, as it's summer 1940.

    Music 

-   _Iron Savior_ has used this multiple times.
-   "Aces High" by Iron Maiden is the World War II flavor of this.
    -   Judas Priest has "Battle Hymn / One Shot at Glory".

    Puppet Shows 

-   All the Gerry Anderson shows had epic stock launching sequences. They are pretty much the trope codifier. This was because with puppets, they couldn't simply just walk to their vehicles. Anyway, what is the fun in just walking to them?
    -   _Fireball XL5_ blasting down the track on its rocket sled may be the Ur-Example.
    -   _Stingray_ took the trope underwater with the crew of the eponymous super-sub manning the craft to the sound of drumbeats, followed by the boat travelling 10 miles along a fairly narrow tunnel before entering the Pacific Ocean through the Ocean Door.
    -   _Thunderbirds_
    -   The Angels from _Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons_.

    Video Games 

-   Both the original _Andro Dunos_ and it's sequel begins with an FMV of the Yellow Cherry and Red Fox taking off the combat the hostile invasion forces.
-   _Battlestations: Pacific_ features this both in Stock Footage before some campaign missions, as well as in-game, as it takes quite some time for carrier-based aircraft to launch.
-   _Zero Wing_ for the Sega Genesis has sequence of launching. Captain is said "Take off every Zig!" Zig move for great justice as the base which somebody set up the bomb explodes behind them.
-   _Star Fox_ in most games, (the original being pictured above) shows the team taking off before the first mission. In the original, they launch from a base on Corneria, but later games launch them from the Great Fox.
    -   _Star Fox 64_ also had some shortened takeoff sequences (just the ships/submarine leaving the Great Fox) in two levels.
    -   The original Star Fox opening, redone in High Definition.
-   _Rendering Ranger: R2_ have it's levels alternating between on foot, or in a prototype starfighter stolen from the aliens. In the first starfighter-themed level, you hop on the fighter after defeating a bunch of enemies, leading to a cutscene of your fighter launching into space.
-   _Super R-Type_ and _R-Type III_ use it.
-   The player character of _The Guardian Legend_ is always shown to go from Walking to Flying mode in a Transformation Sequence before she tackles a corridor. It's also inverted, where she transforms back once the corridor is complete.
-   Happens in _Kingdom Hearts II_ every time you enter an area with the Gummi Ship. Never mind that it was already in space. Fortunately, it's mostly skippable though.
-   The _Wing Commander_ games like to have mini-cutscenes before every mission, showing you and your fighter being readied for launch. In the first game, it was an animated scene (complete with Red Alert, even for routine patrols) with pilots and technicians racing to the hangar, and a similar scene in _III_ showed Col. Blair boarding his ship as it was being prepped by the deck crew; while in the last, it featured your fighter being loaded into the _Midway's_ massive catapult. _III_ and _IV_ had an optional launching scene which was triggered if you launch your ship using the autopilot (it was skipped if you launch manually by upping the throttle).
    -   The novels and later games also mention a "magnum launch," where a carrier simply takes every available pilot and loads them into every available ride, then dumps them into space as fast as possible, usually when the carrier itself is about to come under attack. Such missions in the games, while usually awesome, are also a bit more challenging because you can't personalize your loadout and are stuck with the defaults.
-   This occurs in the _Ace Combat_ series from time to time, too. Sometimes you have to play through the takeoff as well.
    -   The introduction of _Ace Combat 2_ has the protagonists taking off from a carrier to intercept enemy planes.
    -   The X-49 launch scene from _Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere_. Right before it destroys Megafloat using its laser cannon .
    -   The opening mission of _Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies_ features a carrier launching Mobius One's F-4 if the player chooses that aircraft for the mission; otherwise it is skipped. One could also count the launch sequences from when the player uses the RTB line to rearm.
    -   Another example is the opening to "First Flight" in _Ace Combat 5_, where your home base is under attack from enemy planes, and you're taxiing to the end of the runway so you can take off, while planes, buildings and vehicles explode and fall around the player. Due to the damage sustained during the bombing and the lack of qualified pilots, it falls to your wing of three, and later four, to defend the entire base.
        -   Another occurs during "Ancient Walls" as your squadron launches from the Kestrel. In both cases these are skipped in Free Mission mode unless certain aircraft are used (F-5E in First Flight and any of the carrier-capable jets in Ancient Walls).
    -   The _Ace Combat 5_ example was recycled for _Ace Combat Zero_ when PJ, after Pixy's defection, and Cipher launch from a base that is under attack by the XB-0 super-bomber.
    -   Played straight at the beginning of _Ace Combat 6_ during the opening sequence. It's solely a cinematic like the _AC04_ example, but with the caveat that it actually reflects whichever plane you picked for the level rather than skipping it if you don't choose a specific one.
    -   The opening of "Charge Assault" in _Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown_. As part of the Mage Squadron, Fort Grays is under attack by unidentified bombers, forcing you to take off and engage the bombers with the Golem Squadron.
        -   Another occurs during "444" as you are labeled a convict for killing President Harling and had to defend the base by acting as a decoy to the enemy as a member of the Spare Squadron.
        -   The cherry on top occurs during "Dark Blue" where your aircraft is launched from the Admiral Andersen.
-   In the game _Over G Fighters_, you have to perform the takeoff manually, after _manually taxiing your plane to the runway_. It's possible to botch the taxiing so bad that the landing gear are ruined... in which case, mission failed.
    -   This is taken much further, of course, in virtually every actual combat flight simulator. Many also require a full startup sequence and correct radio communications.
-   _Ace Online_ has a relatively cinematic launch sequence for whenever a player leaves town. There's also a bit of a tradition within the playerbase to send duel challenges while landed and then take off as it starts.
-   Both _Andro Dunos_ and it's 2022 sequel begins with an animated cutscene of the player's fighter jets, Yellow Cherry and Red Fox, taking off from their hangar on earth before launching into the skies to battle the aliens.
-   _X-Wing_ and its various sequels had launch sequences before every mission. However, due to the specific way that _Star Wars_ fighters are launched, the cutscene may be much less exciting than with other games. However, it compensates for this with the subsequent hyperjump directly into the combat zone.
-   _Cloud Cutter_ have the _enemies_ doing this, whereas your titular jet fighter is already airborne at the start of each level. In the background you can often see enemy jets and planes taking off while you're busy battling enemies on the same elevation as you, lining up to be shot, and the Battleship Raid stage where you take on an aircraft carrier have said carrier's planes lining up and lying off-deck in a straight formation to attack.
-   _Creature Shock_ introduces Commander Jason Barr, your Captain Space, Defender of Earth! hero in a Fighter _Landing_ Sequence. And then he heads to space, with several cutscenes depicting his trusty starfighter leaving hangars into orbit.
-   _Final Fantasy XII_ had as many gratuitous take-off scenes as it did airships. It had a lot of airships.
-   Your spaceship from _Galaga '88_ does that at the start of the game.
-   _Ikaruga_ has an equivalent sequence at the start of each level where the player's ship accelerates to intercept the enemies while the music kicks in.
-   _Star Control_: The Ur-Quan Dreadnought's secondary attack is essentially a mini-version of this trope.
    -   "Launch Fighters! Launch Fighters! Launchlaunchlaunchlaunchlaunch Fighters!"
-   Many games in the _Raiden_ series start with the player's aircraft taking off.
-   The _194X_ series of arcade shooters had an initial launch sequence from an aircraft carrier.
-   _Freelancer_ has a skippable mini-sequence every time you enter a planet, station or capital ship.
    -   There is also few better examples in storyline missions. Especialy defense of planet Toledo from Nomads with pilots running and ships launching with sound of alarm. Also the escape from Sprague and other few examples.
-   This is rife in the original trilogy of _Another Century's Episode_, where the player's selected Humongous Mecha lumbers or gets a lift to the catapult of the hero faction's warship. This is most accentuated in ACE 2 where each robot ends up on the catapult with a short musical jingle accompanying them, which gets lengthened if the mecha in question has large thrusters like the Dragonar units. Then, a 3D cut-in of the mecha's pilot appears, requesting for launch, of note is the Prince of Darkness Akito Tenkawa simply saying "Going." with a grin on his face. The logical extreme that went with all this presenation in mind was Domon Kasshu summoning the God Gundam by snapping his fingers and appearing on the Albion's bridge rather than the flight deck).
-   _Gradius III_ has a scene of this if the title screen is left to play.
    -   _Gradius V_ has it at the beginning of the first stage. "Emergency! Emergency! This station at planet Gradius is under attack by the Bacterians!"
-   _Halo_:
    -   _Halo: Reach_: When you get into your Sabre Space Fighter, you get an extended sequence of it taking off from Reach into space.
    -   _Halo 4_: In the first episode of _Spartan Ops_, following the Infinity's Dynamic Entry at Requiem by way of ramming _through_ a Covenant battlecruiser, the massive starship then proceeds to a scrambling sequence that involves mass deployment of Pelicans, Broadswords, and even entire Charon-class _frigates_ from internal bays, immediately engaging the Covenant remnant forces above the shield world.
    -   The launching sequence for a Pelican is a shoutout to the Viper tube launch of _Battlestar Galactica_, so close that it's almost copied.
-   _FreeSpace 2_ usually just starts you in space, but your first mission into the nebula (full of Interface Screw and mystery) starts you and your wing on the wing of your flagship so that you can fly off into the blue in style.
-   _Rescue on Fractalus!_ featured a first-person launch sequence from the player's orbital base to the planet below.
-   _Top Gun_: The plane is seen firing its engines in the opening cinematic, and then you watch your jet take off in first person. You also have to land the thing at the end of the level, much to a generation of players' immense frustration.
-   _Combat Flight Simulator_ always starts campaign missions and one-off missions with the player on the ground, requiring you to start your engines and take off before getting to do anything fun. Ordinary flights usually let you start at altitude, though.
-   _Metal Warriors_ features this for the player's Giant Mecha as part of the first mission's opening cutscene, complete with dramatic switch-flipping.
-   _Terminal Velocity (1995)_ has the launch scene (complete with caution sirens, and launching from out of a rotating space station) when the game is first started (since the player continues flying between each mission without returning to base or even docking).
-   _Fury³_ had such a scene for when the game is first launched (the ship is prepped and launched from a space station), while the next sequel, _Hellbender_ had its launch scene at the start of the first level (where the player's ship is launched from a carrier, where it never returns to after each mission - both the player's ship and the carrier warp independently to each succeeding mission).
-   The opening cinematic of _Silpheed_ for the Sega CD.
    
    "Emergency! Emergency! Bogies approaching! All interceptors scramble now!"
    
-   The first game in the _Galaxy Angel_ Gameverse has a cutscene for the Emblem Frames launching from the ventral hangar of the Cool Ship. It's played at least twice.
-   In _Rogue Squadron_ and its sequels, each mission starts with a cutscene showing your selected craft take off from a hanger (which functions as the Playable Menu) and fly out through space towards the appropriate planet. Including when that craft is a non-spaceworthy snowspeeder.
-   The intro cutscene of _Quake II_ has a squadron of drop pods launching. The pods are knocked out of the sky by an EMP blast, killing most of the soldiers except for the player character.
-   _Raiden Trad_ featured the player's ship taking off from atop the Airborne Aircraft Carrier as an opening to the first stage, and then again as an opening to the third stage. Interestingly enough, the carrier is shown with extensive battle damage for the second take-off.
-   _Battlefield 3_ The start of the level _Going Hunting_ had this as well as all of the pre-flight checks.
-   All of _The Tale of ALLTYNEX_ games do this in some variation or another.
-   _XCOM: Enemy Unknown_ has a dramatic cutscene for interceptor launches, where its launch catapult is primed, and it's shot out of the big double-doors in the ceiling to chase down a flying saucer. It's played in full in the first time of each playthrough, and abridged to 2-3 seconds all subsequent times.
-   _Soukyugurentai_ has a 9.92-second launch sequence before the first level. The two levels after that start with the player ship launching from a floating fortress or carrier.
-   In _MechWarrior Living Legends_, aerospace fighters are assembled in a hangar and must be taxied out before taking off. Some levels like "Stone Rose" and "Kagoshima" have dramatic launch tunnels, which can be harrowing in the large and lumbering _Shiva_ and _Xerxes_ aerospace fighters.
-   _Image Fight_ does this right before the final few stages of the game.
-   _No Man's Sky_ evokes this when you take off from a space station.
-   In _Star Wars: Squadrons_ during single-player missions you get to watch your chosen starfighter start up, hover, and leave the hangar. During multiplayer it doesn't show this whole sequence, but there is a sequence at the start of fleet battles where the squadron forms up and the pilots check in with each other.
-   The opening cinematic of _Assault Suits Valken_ features the player character, Jake, being launched in his Mecha, from the battlecraft _Versis_.
-   _ZeroRanger_: The game startup cutscene features the player's craft's startup and launch sequence, with stills from cutscenes later in the game interspersed.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ had a memorable one in the episode "The Northern Air Temple".
-   The opening of _Batman: The Animated Series_ featured the Batmobile jetting out of the Bat Cave.
-   _Exo Squad_ often had extended sequences showing Able Squad "framing up".
-   _The Fairly Oddparents_: "I LIKE TO SCRAMBLE ZE FAIRIES!"
-   _Rocket Robin Hood_ has one in the opening sequence.
-   _StarCom: The U.S. Space Force_ is another opening sequence example.
-   In the _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ episode "Storm Over Ryloth", the audience is introduced to Blue Squadron as they do their final checks and launch their fighters from the hanger for the initial attack led by Ahsoka.
-   In the _Star Wars Rebels_ season 2 premiere "The Siege of Lothal", Commander Sato orders the launch of Phoenix Squadron's A-Wings to defend the fleet against Darth Vader; unfortunately, Vader damn near annihilates them in just a few minutes.
-   _Star Wars Resistance_: "No Escape, Part II" has one when four of the Aces, Kaz and Yeager launch their ships to defend the Colossus from the First Order.
-   _SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron_ has a one-vehicle version of this in some form pretty much every time the Turbokat launched.
-   _Transformers: Cybertron_, as shown here. They start lampshading the stock footage pretty quickly.
-   _Wing Commander Academy_ featured several such sequences, given that it took place aboard a spacecraft carrier. In contrast to the wildly gesturing commanders in many of the Anime examples, Commodore Tolwyn could be seen standing on the bridge, hands clasped behind his back, as he oversaw the ensuing battle.
