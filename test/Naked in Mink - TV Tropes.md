Going out naked is embarrassing, and could get you arrested. Well if you have nothing else handy, a fur coat, wrap or cape will do. It's stylish, covers up all the naughty bits, and is great fanservice.

Yet, this is quite often a deliberate seduction move, combining with Ready for Lovemaking. Why is this such a turn on? Rule 34, of course. And in many ways it's better at implying actual nudity than a thong bikini (but not a wet T-shirt).

And not even a full coat is necessary. In the early days of Hollywood, glamor shots would often have an actress wear a fur wrap, and be shot in a way that looks as though she wore nothing else. For some reason, the Hays office allowed it, probably because they weren't actually naked. But the allusion in those is still clear.

Sometimes this is a ploy to distract one's husband from the fact that a fair chunk of the family finances were just sunk into this fur coat.

Yet other times, there is no seduction, and the fur coat is just an emergency cover up, just often a sexy one.

Now this trope doesn't count if you actually see any nudity. Then it's just a nude shot with the fur as an accessory.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Peacemaker Kurogane_: Nothing screams "villain" more than having Suzu seductively wearing nothing but a loose, black fur robe.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _42nd Street_ had a really subtle one. In the Busby Berkeley Number, there was a woman in a fur-trimmed dress, with a huge white fur muff. If you paid close attention, you'd see she was actually wearing a fur trimmed skirt with a white fur wrap. The muff was constantly held over her midriff to make it not so obvious that the wrap was the only thing keeping her you-know-what covered. This was before the Hays Office became as powerful as it was (although it was started a few years before), and may have even led to its rise to power.
-   _Breaking and Entering (2006)_: During Will's stake-out of the burgled offices, the prostitute Oana sits in his car because wearing a fur coat with nothing underneath is cold.
-   In _A Fine Mess_, Claudia Pazzo (Maria Conchita Alonso) arrives at Spence Holden's (Ted Danson) apartment wearing a white fox fur coat. Spence asks if he could take her coat and Claudia says, "Sure", while shedding the coat<small>◊</small> and walked into Spence's bedroom wearing only panties.

So he was later picked up by a truck carrying fur coats, and he was forced to wear one to get back into his apartment. Since we now know Rock was gay, this may or may not be Hilarious in Hindsight.
-   In _Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day_, Delysia Lafosse takes off the silk robe she seduced a man in the night before, then puts on a fur coat with nothing else under it just before her boyfriend comes in. And... really enjoys it.
    
    **Delysia:** There is something so sensual about the feeling of fur against skin!

In the next scene he's been fired from the job for harassing said customer; we never learn whether he was correct in either of his assumptions.
-   An interesting example in _X-Men: Days of Future Past_: Mystique seduces a mark while in the form of a woman wearing a cocktail dress under a fur coat. When she shapeshifts back to her nude blue form, the coat remains- apparently, unlike the rest of her clothing, it wasn't shapeshifted from her body. She proceeds to drop the coat and kick the poor sucker's butt.

-   _Murder, She Wrote_: The episode _School for Scandal_ has the character Daphne return from a swim wearing a fur suit, and as shown (though not to the viewer, this being Murder, She Wrote) when she flashes everyone upon retiring for the night, nothing else.

-   When Bill Engvall was discussing the proper meaning of "awesome" he brought up what would truly be awesome to him.
    
    And I started thinking about what would be awesome for Bill Engvall? What would leave me in awe and wonder? And it would have to be if I left this stage tonight and went back to my hotel room. And Shania Twain met me at my door, wearing nothing but a fur coat, holding a note from my wife that said "have a good time." _That_ would be awesome!

    Theatre

-   A few pin-ups of Dita Von Teese featured this.
-   Recounted in _Not Since Carrie_ by Ken Mandelbaum: The musical _At The Grand_ closed before it went to Broadway because its star, Paul Muni, refused to sign a new contract after his preliminary one was up. The other actors were pissed, as the show had been doing good business in previews on the road. By way of revenge, during her curtain call at the final show, Joan Diener turned upstage to face Muni (who hated scantily-clad chorus girls and cleavage) and opened her full-length mink coat "to reveal herself naked but for a long stemmed rose between her legs."
-   British English as spoken Oop North has the idiomatic term _she's all fur coat and no knickers!_, spoken disapprovingly concerning a Certain Type Of Woman Who Is No Better Than She Ought To Be. The "no knickers" part can refer, darkly, to the occupation of the lady in question and explains to the satisfaction of the listener just what she does to be able to afford expensive furs. (And why wearing clothing under the fur is optional).
-   Kawésqar, one of the indigenous people of Tierra del Fuego, traditionally wore nothing but guanaco skin cloaks to survive from the harsh, stormy climate of the Strait of Magellan.
