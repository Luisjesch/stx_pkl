_"When we're launching a new adult science fiction drama, it's kind of inevitable you're going to do the sex monster."_

Superhuman powers are a great way to fight for truth, justice, and the American Way. For the more inventive, they're also a great way to add some extra fun to sexy times. It could give them an extra edge in pleasing their partners, improve their chances at romance, provide different ways to explore their own pleasure, or even, for morally lacking individuals, as a tool for vouyerism, molestation, or even flat-out rape, either by force or manipulation. If any sort of superpowered or supernatural ability gets used for something sexual, it's this trope.

Mind Control, Psychic Powers (Synchronization in particular), invisibility, intangibility, sprouting tentacles, X-Ray Vision, and the ability to stop (or otherwise manipulate) time are especially vulnerable to this. Shapeshifting Squick is a related sub-trope. Fantastic Arousal is when this trope meets unusual body parts.

See Mundane Utility for less perverted applications of superpowers and gadgets. See Video Game Perversity Potential for this trope applied to the creativity of Game Mods. If the use of powers during sex comes with risks to one or both partners, it is Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex. Remember that this is the kind of perversion related to sexual matters, _not_ the sort that would suggest such things as Superpowered Evil Side or Video Game Cruelty Potential.

Please, list examples shown or discussed in-universe only. There are other places on the web to put your erotic fanfic prompts.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Akame ga Kill!_ plays with this in an episode. Mine feels insulted when Chelsea says that she thinks Sheele and Bulat, two members of Night Raid who were recently killed in action, were failures as assassins so she calls Tatsumi and Lubbock to help her plan revenge. Lubbock suggests Tatsumi use his Imperial Arm to turn invisible and sneak up behind her while she's bathing and put a bucket over her head. His real reason for suggesting this was to determine how upset she'd be if they peeped on her.
    -   Earlier on is the Imperial Arm known as Spectator. Clearsight is the ability to see through walls and apparently clothing when Tatsumi sees Mine, Akame, and Sheele in their underwear just before being rejected by the Arm.
-   Early on _Arachnid_, Alice brings a captured Gokiburi home and has her rolled up on Razor Floss 24/7 so she wouldn't try anything funny. When Alice's sleeping, however, Gokiburi sweats a large amount of oil and slips out of the threads without them alarming Alice. She then murders Alice's friend Yoriko, but this detail turns out to be a nightmare and Alice wakes up to see... a sweaty half-naked Goki playing with her panties.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: When Suzu thinks the the merged Kanade and Shirogane are gone, she summons her omokage's Helping Hands to start caressing Matsuri's thighs and breasts in class. Kanade/Shirogane then arrive to Dope Slap Suzu out of her seat.
-   _Berserk_: Griffith applies this trope in one of the most horrible fashions possible upon becoming Femto, the fifth member of the Godhand. As one of the Godhand, he's a Reality Warper who can manipulate causality... and the very first thing he does with this power is to restrain Casca with the help of a tentacled demon and then rape her right in front of Guts, and so brutally that the experience completely destroys her mind.
-   In the _Blue Exorcist_ anime, Rin is demonstrated to be capable of selectively incinerating clothes with his Hellfire without harming the wearer or other pieces of clothing on the wearer in the process. The first time he accidentally pulls this stunt, he leaves only the underwear on the two people involved — one of them being the local Ms. Fanservice.
-   In the anime of _Blue Seed_, Yaegashi's computer program to predict the weakness of enemies was beta-tested by figuring out what kind of panties Momiji would be wearing on a particular day. She was unamused.
-   In the H-manga _Bullied-Revenge Hypnosis_, three girls are the most feared students due to their wanton use of Blackmail and personal insults. When they catch their latest victim skulking in the girls' locker room, they intend to make him their personal punching bag. However, he tricks them into getting hypnotized, and plants the idea that they want to have his children and he turns them into his personal harem. The epilogue shows they have given birth to one baby each, and he's begging them to let him rest as he's too exhausted, though they insist on continuing to have sex because they want to have more of his children.
-   In the manga _Category Freaks_, you have a group of very powerful supernatural entities who are trying to stop humanity being... well, eaten, by everything that it doesn't know is there. The words "abuse of power" aren't exactly unfamiliar to them, and a couple of them have some weird sexual fetishes which they don't mind using off-label use of their powers to achieve. These are the good guys. If you want to know what the bad guys do on a day to day basis by perverting their powers, you'll need a large supply of Brain Bleach, and to have made a detailed reading of all warnings in the Body Horror, Nightmare Fuel, and And I Must Scream entries on this wiki before hand.
-   _A Certain Magical Index/A Certain Scientific Railgun_:
    -   Kuroko Shirai isn't shy about using her ability to spy on her crush and even at one point, while under the effects of an aphrodisiac, teleport Mikoto Misaka's underwear off of her. Mikoto is _not_ amused.
    -   In an omake, some scientists from the Level 6 Project tried to use the super computer Tree Diagram to figure out what kind of panties Mikoto wears. It _refused_, saying, "Don't use me for stupid things."
    -   Touma Kamijou's right hand, Imagine Breaker, contains always active Anti-Magic and, more than once, has inflicted Clothing Damage when used to touch enchanted clothing. It's also speculated (in-universe and out) that it severs people's Red String of Fate, which is why girls constantly fall in love with him.
    -   Aogami Pierce once sold special Indian Poker cards that let the user experience erotic dreams of celebrities that can be fine tuned to fit various fetishes. When Mikoto and Misaki found out that included them, they beat him and his customers up, burned the cards, and erased their memories.
-   In _The Circumstances Leading to Waltraute's Marriage_, Jack Elvan acquires a Dwarf-forged multi-tool that can slice through a Valkyrie's armor, meant to be used to disrobe her. The Dwarves added a feature where the tool transforms into a mass of tentacles that can trap girls and pleasure them. Upon learning this, Freyja expresses a desire to borrow the tool so she can use it on herself. Since Jack is a little boy, it does not occur to him to use it for perverted purposes. Nonetheless, Waltraute confiscates it.
-   Sex Magic is a major part of the worldbuilding in _Crimson Spell_, so this is all over the place. Most notably Played for Drama when Astador first attempts to kidnap Prince Vald. Because he created the curse Vald is fighting, he's able to use the connection between them to paralyze Vald and then magically compel him to experience arousal as he's being groped and taunted.
    -   Played for fanservice in one of the earlier side stories, when Havi uses his expertise to synthesize an aphrodisiac and then temporarily enchants Vald so he can't orgasm unless Havi allows it.
-   In _Cross Ange_, Embryo uses mind control to force Ange to strip naked and then kiss him. When she manages to break out of the control, he next takes control of her senses, making her alternate between several sensations like extreme pain, tickling, and mind blowing arousal. Although this causes her to masturbate in front of him and beg to be touched, it fails to break her will and she manages to escape. In the final episode, Embryo makes Ange's clothes disappear, then ties her up with prehensile vines and prepares to rape her, but her friends show up in time to stop him.
-   In _Doraemon_ there are several gadgets (dogu) with this potential (from stop time to turn invisible). The major example has a Running Gag involving an "Anywhere Door", which lets a person travel anywhere. There are many times Nobita uses it to get to a random place, only to land himself in Shizuka's bathroom.
    -   Some chapters have Doraemon too negative-minded about Nobita using his gadget for perverted things like peek under Shizuka's skirt or while she bathes. However Nobita has NO intention of doing it.
    -   One episode and chapter had the "XYZ Camera", an X-Ray camera. Guess what happens when a person's picture is taken with that camera?
    -   The movie _Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure into the Underworld_ (both the original version and the remake) has a Running Gag with Nobita using his magic power to lift Shizuka's skirt.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Early on, Oolong shapeshifts into a pair of underwear and suggests that Bulma put him on; Bulma promptly slaps him.
    -   Bulma trades her Micro Band (a watch that can shrink the person who is wearing it) to Turtle Hermit in exchange for a submarine. He uses the device as a way to spy on Bulma while she is on the toilet, but it failed as he shows up when she had finished (and Hermit himself falls into the toilet for good measure). Later, he tries to convince Lunchi several times to take a bath so he can sneak in microscopically and see her naked, but he fails.
-   In _Dragon Ball Z_, Elder Kaiōshin says he can use his omniscient vision to spy on girls at any time. Kaiōshin is appalled at such a misuse of power.
-   _Dragon Ball Super_: An accidental (and utterly hilarious) example occurs with Goku. His Instant Transmission allows him to teleport anywhere he wants to go at a moment's notice, but in one episode, due to losing control over his ki-focus (which, among other things, causes him not to be able to turn around in mid-flight when he wants), Goku at one point ends up in Bulma's bedroom instead of his intended destination of King Kai's place... and that happens just as Bulma's coming out of the shower. She, of course, thinks Goku did it on purpose and activates laser-drones in readiness to shoot him. Of course Goku being Goku, he has no such intention. And Goku being Goku, he actually ends up _insulting Bulma_ while explaining the situation.
    
    **Bulma:** Explain yourself right now!  
    **Goku:** I didn't come here on purpose, okay?  
    **Bulma:** THEN WHY THE HELL ARE YOU HERE?  
    **Goku:** Trust me, I'm just as confused as you! Look, I wouldn't come here just to see your boobies — yours are too saggy now!  
    _(Beat)_  
    **Vegeta:** _What's wrong with you?!_
    
-   For the morbidly curious _Durarara!!_ fan: yes, Shinra _has_ considered the potential bondage applications of his dullahan girlfriend's powers in the bedroom.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   DiMaria Yesta of Albareth's Spriggan Twelve is a Master Swordswoman of the highest caliber. She's so good, in fact, she can slice an opponent's clothes off without them noticing _and_ without scratching them. One of her favorite tactics in battle is to do this on female opponents, simultaneously leaving them mortified and giving herself a nice view.
    -   Jacob Lessio uses his magic to make Lucy's clothes turn invisible to try to mortify her and Natsu. He gets freaked out when Natsu is unfazed, then he ironically gets distracted and loses.
-   _Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest_: Hakune can read people's minds and create Snowlems of people they love to seduce them. When she used this ability, the copies were identical to the real thing and were naked.
-   In _The Familiar of Zero_, Osmand takes every opportunity to sexually harass his Sexy Secretary Miss Longueville, which includes having his mouse Familiar look up her skirt and tell him what panties she's wearing, and using telekinesis to grope her.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, Roy Mustang, the Casanova, has the ability to manipulate gases in the air to create flames and explosions. In one Extra, he showed how this power can be used to make women faint so he can play the hero and seduce her.
-   _Futaba-kun Change!_ is what results when you notice the unspoken issues in Gender Bender stories like _Ranma ½_ and _do_ address them. Same basic principle minus the Love Dodecahedron, but plus the 15-rated exploration, so the Gender Bender character gets periods and (because it runs in the family) was birthed by his _father_ — since the transformation is triggered by sexual arousal, all members of the family basically can only have sex as the opposite gender of their birth gender. Although, in this series' case, the Gender Benders are explicitly stated to be locked in female form while having their period, and presumably while pregnant.
-   _Gigant_: When porn star Chiho Johansson gets the ability to become bigger and smaller at will, one of the first things she does is apply this to her work by filming a porn video where she makes love as a giantess.
-   _GTO: The Early Years_: In one Bizarro Episode chapter, Saejima, Kamata, and Tsukai meet Kiyoma, a classmate with Psychic Powers. His first use of them they see? Creating wind to blow girls' skirts so he can see their underwear. At the end, they find out that's the extent of his powers.
-   In _Heaven's Lost Property_, the perverted hero, Tomoki Sakurai, gains access to a reality-rewriting Angeloid slave. One of the _first_ things he does is have her stop time so he can run around sexually assaulting girls. This is only the first episode, just by the by.
-   _High School D×D_: Pretty much all of Issei's non-Balance Breaker abilities are him gleefully abusing the fact even his small magic can do whatever he wants with enough practice. Hilariously, he often finds genuine utility in his spells:
    -   Dress Break allows him to completely shred the clothing of any woman he can lay a hand on. This covers any clothing on a sexy woman. Armor of Invincibility that turned away a teammate's magic swords? Gone. Damsel in Distress strapped into a Fantastic Nuke? As long as he can convince himself she's "wearing" the bondage-style restraints, Boosted Gear takes care of the rest.
    -   Pailingual allows him to communicate directly with a girl's breasts. By touch, no less. While its combat applications are limited, it's very useful for understanding things his harem don't want to say out loud.
    -   Issei later masters one of Ddraig's latent abilities, one that allows his attacks to bypass any barrier. Not only does he immediately christen the ability "Penetrate", he promptly applies it to his own eyes so he can look through girls' shirts.
    -   One time, Issei was in class and everyone was told to shape something out of clay. He unconsciously pours his mana into the clay, then his imagination causes the clay to transform into a tiny sculpture of a naked Rias. His classmates try to get it, but he firmly says it will be his greatest treasure and he escapes with it.
-   _Hybrid × Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia_: This is a given since lust, arousal, and sex is used to generate magical energy.
    -   The Love Room can apparently read its occupant's minds and alter its environment and people's clothes to suit their ideal sexual fantasy, like when it ties Yurishia up in BDSM gear or turns Hayuru into a Cat Girl where the tail was inserted into her butt.
    -   Exclusive to the anime and light novel:
        -   Zelshione hypnotizes girls into becoming her sex slaves. If someone is too strong to be simply mesmerized, she'll whip them while taking control of their senses to turn the pain into pleasure until they break.
        -   To provide power to a ship, Kizuna had sex with Grabel and Aldea while they were touching power-siphoning cables. However, he was provided an implant that lets him control the cables with his mind and feel whatever the cables feel as if they were his own hands. He uses the cables to restrain and pleasure the two.
-   _In Another World with My Smartphone_: When Touya and Leen use the Invisible spell to infiltrate a castle, the latter immediately proceeds to grope Tsubaki's breasts, while pretending that Touya is the one who's doing it.
-   This is more or less the entire premise of _Interspecies Reviewers_. It doesn't matter if we're talking fantasy races with naturally strange anatomy or specially designed magic spells: if it has kinky potential, then there's already a brothel or two based around it. Light elementals have auto-censored public orgies, salamander girls run a barbecue version of the Body Sushi, slimes are famous for their shapeshifting and ability to get deep into _any_ nook and cranny, the list goes on and on. They do at least have some level of morality left, though: for instance, use of the Gender Bender potion is only allowed in specifically sanctioned establishments, because that one has applications that go much further than harmless consensual fun.
    
    **Zel:** What do you think we'd do if we could leave?  
    **Stunk and Kanchal, in perfect unison:** _We'd go to the women's bath!_  
    **Zel:** And that's why we can't.
    
-   In the Hentai, _Jiburiru: The Devil Angel_, the rules are that only women can become Angels that fight Demons and the only way to charge her power is to have sexual intercourse and the only way to gain new powers is by using different sexual positions and techniques. Naturally, the heroine's boyfriend uses this as an excuse to have sex as much as possible. In the sequel, he has to help his step-sister become an angel, and charge her powers in order to rescue his captured girlfriend.
-   In _JoJolion_, Joushuu has the power to screw nuts and bolts onto any object, and then unscrew them to make them instantly fall apart. The first thing he intentionally uses this for is undressing Yasuho when she (mistakenly, while under the effects of a sense-confusing stand) mistakes him for someone else and says something that, out of context, makes it sound, at least to Joushuu, like she wants to have sex with him.
-   _Kimagure Orange Road_:
    -   Kurumi once transformed Kyousuke in a Panty Thief (by accident: she had hypnotized him into obeying any and all orders and forgot to break it, and Hatta and Komatsu jokingly ordered him to bring them female underwear. Then they started doing it seriously); while under the effects of the above mentioned hypnosis, Kyousuke used his teleportation abilities to steal panties and bras _while they were being worn._
    -   Akane's little brother Kazuya can switch bodies with a headbutt. More than once he switched bodies with Kyousuke to perv on Madoka and Hikaru (as much as a five years old child can perv on a high schooler and a middle schooler)... and Kyousuke sometimes went with it willingly to do the same without punishment, as he would be in a child body.
    -   In an early appearance Kazuya use his Telekinesis power to lift Madoka's skirt.
    -   Kyousuke's cousin Akane can make people see her as someone else. More than once she had to stop herself from using Kyousuke's face to get her way with Madoka.
-   In _Kokkoku_ one of Sagawa's thugs uses the Stalled World to... read a porno mag in public. His fellows immediately mock him when he could be seeing the real thing, which they demonstrate by pulling down a Stalled woman's panties.
-   _KonoSuba_:
    -   After learning the Steal ability, Kazuma quickly discovers he can use it to snatch women's panties whenever he uses it on them. He's _delighted_ about it.
    -   Beldia, one of the Devil King's generals, is a Dullhallan, an undead knight whose head is separated from his body. He often used this to his advantage by sending his head rolling between Wiz's feet to take a peek under her dress.
-   _The Legend of Zelda (Akira Himekawa)_:
    -   In the manga adaptation of _The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap_, a shrunken Link is found by the local Cucco-owning girl Anju and taken to her home. While she tends to her birds, Link gets the idea to use his diminutive frame to get under Anju's dress and sneak a peek at her panties without her realizing it. However, his plan is unwittingly thwarted during its execution, and he doesn't make any further attempts.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2016)_, Midna uses her ability to hide in Link's shadow to check him out in the bath, and she makes sure Link knows it.
-   _Love Hina_:
    -   An occasion has Keitaro and Kitsune sneak in Naru's room to discover her real feelings and use invisible tutes created by Su. The power potential is invoked by Keitaro and realized when Naru enter in the room and start to strip.
    -   Su later develops X-ray goggles that let her see through Kanako's disguises... and her clothes... _and_ the clothes of whoever else's in her field of view.
-   An episode of _Lupin III: Part II_ has a woman named Nova and a scientist invent special eye drops that let the user see through any surface with complete clarity. Nova gives it to Zenigata; he discover also the _potential_ of the invention on Nova herself as well his policeman on Fujiko, disguised as a train attendant, later. Naturally Lupin does the same at the end of the episode.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_: Sein's ability to pass through matter is useful to escape (or let her fellow combatants escape) from her enemies — or, as demonstrated in _ViVid_, to play a trick on her friends while they are relaxing in the hot Springs.
-   In _Mahou no Iroha_, Iroha briefly grants Naoki supernatural artistic skill. He promptly uses it to make perverted sketches of famous idols. And Nanako.
-   _My Hero Academia_, being a setting where Everyone Is a Super, lends itself to this.
    -   In-universe, in a flashback, Hitoshi Shinso's classmate clearly has sex on the mind when discussing Shinso's mind control powers, and Tsuyu Asui's long, prehensile tongue makes a 1B student uncomfortable when she uses it to capture him in a joint training session.
    -   The Hot Springs Episode naturally has a scene where Mineta tries to climb the wall to the girls' side using his Quirk.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Naruto's first seen attack, the Ninja Centerfold/Sexy no Jutsu, transforms him into a beautiful naked woman, which he often uses to manipulate the many Dirty Old Men that populate Konoha. When he combines it with the Shadow Clone Jutsu he gets the _Harem_ Jutsu (you can guess what that one does), and later, a male version of the Harem Jutsu which he successfully uses to distract Kaguya.
    -   Early in canon, Naruto transforms into Sasuke in order to seduce Sakura. They almost end up kissing before they're interrupted. It's implied Sakura never catches on to this deception, nor does Sasuke even realize why Naruto tied him up.
    -   Jiraiya created an invisibility jutsu for the purpose of sneaking into hot springs to peek on the bathing women. When the Third Hokage found out, he begged Jiraiya to teach him the invisibility jutsu.
    -   As Konohamaru showed in the beginning of _Shippuden_, all one needs to do is combine the basic transformation jutsu (look like anyone) with the basic clone jutsu. There is the endless capacity to make the image of anyone having sex with anyone else.
    -   While we have yet to see the Byakugan (which allows the user a near-360-degree visual scope coupled with X-Ray Vision) being used this way in any canon material, in _Naruto the Movie: Road to Ninja_ the alternate-universe version of Neji, a Handsome Lech, uses his Byakugan to peek into the girls' bath. Unfortunately for him, alternate!Hinata (a Tsundere of the highest order in this universe) spots him and is ready to kill him for it.
    -   Hinted at with the Sharingan, which gives its user the ability to create illusions and hypnotize targets. In his introductory arc, Itachi uses his Sharingan to cast a random woman under a hypnotic genjutsu in order to make her be attracted to Jiraiya (as a way of distracting the Sannin, who's known for being a Dirty Old Man, while Itachi and Kisame can then capture Naruto unimpeded); however, Jiraiya quickly realizes the woman is under a genjutsu and breaks the spell on her. In _Itachi Shinden,_ a two-part original story which gives additional information about the events leading up to the Uchiha Massacre, Itachi also pulled this on the massacre's first victim, a female member of the clan who'd always been infatuated with him, by subjecting her to the Tsukuyomi technique in which she was given the illusion of them living their lives together into old age as a married couple, which included her bearing his children, which of course would necessitate... well, you know. (For her part, she seemed to realize the whole thing was an illusion, but thanked Itachi for granting it to her even as she died in his arms).
-   Quite a bit of this occurs in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, but the most obvious example is Haruna and her artifact, which allows to make golems that perfectly resemble anyone (or anything) she can draw... and she can modify their personalities and appearances any way she likes. So far, she's created a Nugi golem with a 23.5 centimeter _tongue_ for practice pactios, and a "dark" version of Nodoka. And, proving that she's perfectly aware of the potential for hideous misuse, she was on the verge of creating "Ero Nodoka" before the real Nodoka bonked her in the head with a book.
-   In _Nobunagun_, the powers of a man powered by the enhanced genes of famed war photographer Robert Capa include the ability to create copies of people. While using it in a training exercise for the protagonist, a high school girl named Shio, he "motivates" her into aiming better by threatening to take a peek at "her" breasts. Later, he makes her copies pose for some swimsuit photos, to her understandable displeasure.
-   In _Nurse Hitomi's Monster Infirmary_, Kaminaga-sensei uses her Prehensile Hair to grope Hitomi. Shitara is embarrassed at first by her Overly-Long Tongue, but then starts going out with a boy who has a tongue fetish.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Happened when Sanji met a Devil Fruit user that could turn invisible. A large part of Sanji's anger stemmed from the fact that Absalom, the person with the ability, did _exactly_ that with his powers. The other is that the powers are unique — as long as Absalom lives, nobody else can have the Clear-Clear Fruit's powers. Absalom ends up later killed by Shiryu, who steals his Sevil Fruit and according to a SBS, also uses it to spy on girls bathing.
        
        **Sanji:** If I ever get the ability, I want to use it to **GIRL'S BATH** Ah no, I meant I asked myself **GIRL'S BATH** No, I wanted to use it to benefit the humanity **GIRL'S BATH**.
        
    -   In the eleventh TV special, _Heart of Gold_, upon discovering that the enemy Devil Fruit user Psycho P has the Color-Color Fruit, which can similarly be used to grant invisibility, Sanji goes off on a rant about how Psycho P _must_ be using its powers to peep on girls, whilst making it clear that he'd do exactly that. When the disgusted Psycho P asserts that he'd never think of using his powers to do something so perverted, Sanji gets angry and berates him for "wasting" his gift.
    -   And then Sanji ended up getting a suit that grants the wearer invisibility as a gift from his (_utterly despised_) family. After some internal debating, he has the exact same outbursts as above trying to explain what he'll do with this new power.
    -   Brook learned to use his Revive-Revive Fruit to separate his soul from his body at will, able to go through walls at will. Dirty Old Man that he is, the very first thing was to use it exactly how Sanji would've (and Absalom did) use invisibility.
    -   This is mentioned _a lot_ in the SBS sections, to the point of being a Running Gag — and Oda will always answer very seriously and bluntly. Luffy's penis can stretch (and this was alluded to in series when he was on the island of Amazon Lily), Buggy can make his penis detach and make it fly around, yes, Jozu, who can turn into diamond, can have a diamond penis, and yes, Nico Robin can make copies of her breasts appear on any surface she likes.
-   _The Other World's Wizard Does Not Chant_: Yard Warner uses magic for this a lot. For example, he uses emotion and sensory manipulation to make girls he is talking to become very horny to make it easier to seduce them. When he is not in the mood for sex, he uses shadow manipulation to create Naughty Tentacles to pleasure his partner for him.
-   Repeatedly asked at conventions what would happen if the title character of _Ranma ½_ got pregnant in female form, Rumiko Takahashi finally replied, exasperated "It's never going to happen, so why do you ask?" The interesting part is, whether Takahashi wants to think about it or not, she _did_ address it in the manga (albeit indirectly). The Musk Dynasty story arc describes an ancient culture which ritually tossed strong, wild animals they had captured (such as tigers, wolves, boars, and, at one point, a _dragon_) into the Spring of the Drowned Girl, in order to procure wives. Then they'd magically lock those "women" in human form and mate with them, so their offspring would inherit the traits of the mother's original form. As one might imagine, Ranma fell victim to this at one point.
    -   It is briefly mentioned as an option offhandedly by Nabiki at one point where she mentions that it would keep "the honeymoon interesting". Akane innocently asks what she means by that, and Nabiki slyly smiles and says to not worry about it.
-   _Rebuild World_:
    -   When Akira buys an Everything Sensor on the cheap from his Big Sister Mentor like friends Elena and Sara, his Virtual Sidekick Alpha hacks it and tells him that the two women’s body measurements are in there. Alpha being The Gadfly, she creates a holographic projection of the two naked in front of Akira. This scene was left out from the manga adaptation, but has an illustration in the Light Novels.
    -   Akira’s later sets of Powered Armor have functions to simulate the sense of touch through their gloves. This is naturally used by Alpha to sexually harass Akira by forcing him to touch her breasts, which is possible because she’s imputing the simulated data into the suit.
-   In _Redo of Healer_, Keyaru brainwashes his allies into sex slaves by using his special magic powers.
-   In _Rising × Rydeen_ Aria has a table that can project and manipulate holograms. She shows this to Takara's team by projecting a hologram of Mikan then making it do sexy poses. Unfortunately, Sanagi won't let Takara watch it.
-   _Saki_: In the final episode of season 1, Yumi is sitting naked and alone in a hot springs bath. She is blushing furiously and can barely form a coherent sentence when asked a question. A few moments later, her girlfriend Momo, who has the power of invisibility (well, technically, "unnoticeability") suddenly appears beside her, to the surprise of the other girls in the pool.
-   _The Seven Deadly Sins_: Gowther, wishing to understand What Is This Thing You Call "Love"?, used his powers to modify Guila's memories so that she thought she was in love with him, and she ended up having sex with him in this state. When the others found out, they angrily pointed out what he was doing was rape. Gowther honestly didn't understand why it was wrong, but changed Guila back to normal and apologized. Guila forgave him; she said she would keep the experience of them together as a happy memory.
-   _Shakugan no Shana_:
    -   The spirit of Snake of the Festival, a Godzilla-sized snake, possesses Yuji's body. Bel Peol wonders why her mighty leader would choose a lowly human body as a host. Snake holds her hand, caresses her face, and says he can think of a few _advantages_ to being in a human body. She blushes.
    -   Margery Daw granted Satou temporary Super-Strength so that they could have sex without worrying about her accidentally tearing him apart.
-   In _Soul Eater_, an evil Mummy pharaoh captures Liz and Patti with his prehensile bandages. When Death the Kid arrives, he finds the bandages stripping and molesting the girls, and they seemed to be on the verge of screaming in pleasure.
-   Invoked quite horrifically in _Speed Grapher_, where the Psycho Serum of the setting is a mutagenic virus that grants those who survive being infected with it two powers: a Healing Factor, and a unique ability based on the host's sexual fetishes. From a diamond fetishist who can turn into living diamond, to a Depraved Dentist who can sprout tentacles ending in drills and other tools of the trade; from a foodie who turns into a giant Waddling Head with Hollywood Acid spittle and multiple tentacle-like tongues to an electroshock fetishist who can manipulate electricity, all sorts of horrific displays of powers born from perversion appear in this series.
-   Touka Aizuki, the female lead of _Suki × Suki_, can become invisible. The first thing we see her do with it is hang out in the room the boys are using to change for gym class. The first thing she did upon discovering she had this power was peek under a classmate's skirt. Her most common use of her power is to stalk or otherwise be close to Ryoutaro, who she's otherwise too Tsundere to speak to. The only person who can see her when she does all this is Ryoutaro himself, who can't decide whether he should make her aware of that.
-   _The Testament of Sister New Devil_:
    -   Master/Servant contracts have a magical penalty for the Servant if they will not obey. For contracts brokered by succubi, the penalty is usually the Servant must submit to the Master sexually.
    -   Maria is a succubus who for her own amusement, constantly uses her powers to make the people around her become aroused so they'll have an urge to have sex, masturbate, or otherwise do foreplay.
    -   Maria's mother Sheila teleports into Basara's lap and later teleports him to a succubus punishment ritual so he can spank Maria.
    -   Basara and Chisato take advantage of a pocket dimension where time flows faster than usual to have sex for a year uninterrupted. During this time, Basara made a duplicate of himself so he could give Chisato double penetration.
    -   In the ending where Basara marries and impregnates all the girls in his harem, Chisato casts a protective spell around all the girls' wombs so that they can keep having sex without risking a miscarriage.
-   Kuroi in _Thou Shalt Not Die_ slept with a few women using his hypnotism before the story started. He stopped due to his powers ruining his interaction with people to the point he lived and randomly killed out of habit.
-   _Time Stop Hero_: Kuzuno Sekai has the power to stop time. He constantly uses this to strip and grope girls, then returns their clothes so they don't even notice when he resumes time. He has also used it to spy on bathing women. At the very least, he never kisses or rapes them. His usual method of dealing with female attackers is to freeze time and strip them naked, then resume time, both to embarrass them into surrendering or retreating and to enjoy the view. He does not advertise his ability and pretends he stripped them via "Disarmament Magic".
-   In _Tokkô_, after Itto kills a perverted phantom who was attacking schoolgirls and takes his powers, he discovers to his disgust that the power he gained from the phantom was the ability to sprout dildos from his hands. One can only imagine how the phantom used this power.
-   _To Love Ru_:
    -   There are dozens of potentially perverse uses for many of Lala's inventions as well as technology in general. The teleporter that doesn't take clothes and a device that can control people's bodies immediately come to mind. This is just the tip of the iceberg though... no, really.
        -   Lampshade by Rito in an extra chapter where, thanks to one of Momo's plants, he becomes a pervert and abuses Lala's inventions. Mostly, a pair of glasses with X-Ray Vision.
    -   Nemesis (who has the same powers as Yami) is fully aware of the potential of voluntary shapeshifting.
    -   Yami, in "Darkness" form, find an "interesting" use of her wormholes-power.
-   _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_: The Audio Play produced for the series sees Leon's Robot Buddy Luxion creating a holographic simulation of Leon's main love interests, the Bait-and-Switch Lesbians Olivia and Angelica, bathing together and then beginning a sexual encounter, which gives Leon a Nosebleed as he’s a Yuri Fanboy.
-   In _Type-Moon - T-MOON COMPLEX Congratulations! 10th Anniversary_, a _Nasuverse_ crossover manga, during a trip to the hot springs, Caster Gilles de Rais uses his crystal ball to spy on Jeanne d'Arc bathing. Upon learning of this, many of the boys dogpile him and try to take the crystal ball for themselves so they can spy on the girls bathing.
-   Takahashi plays the trope totally straight in _Urusei Yatsura_. During a trip to the beach, Jariten has these devices called "cores" that can make whatever they make out of sand become solid and even moveable. All three men present immediately make and animate full-size sculptures of the hottest woman they know, the School Nurse Sakura.(With said woman present... and her boyfriend not far behind).
-   _Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches_ is a romantic comedy that revolves around various powers that require kissing to be used. These powers include switching bodies and making someone love you. The characters are all just perverted enough to see the implications. Miyamura for instance suggests that Yamada uses the love power to make all the girls in school into his harem. It should be noted that Yamada actually tends to be responsible with the powers. It's everyone else that sees the potential.
-   In _YuYu Hakusho_, when Botan gives Yusuke the tools of a Spirit Detective, the first item is a set of x-ray glasses. He immediately tries to use them to look through her clothes. Botan clubs him with her oar.

    Comedy 

-   Australian comedian Adam Hills has an artificial foot. In his stand-up shows he brings up that he often gets asked strange questions about it such as:
    -   "Can you still have sex?" His response was, "Yeah, what does your boyfriend do? Does he have a run-up?"
    -   "Do you take it off to have sex?" He lets the audience laugh, then says that's the reaction he normally gets. "Ha ha ha... _do ya?_" He answers, "Yes, I do, but there's no sexy way to remove an artificial leg." He proceeded to mime what would result if he tried a strip show with his leg.
    -   "Have you ever used it?" To this he replied, "Even if I wanted to, at what point are you supposed to bring that up in a relationship?"
-   English comedian Russell Howard said in a stand-up show that if he had a super power, it would be the ability to make people orgasm just by touching them once. In his words, "Not for sexual purposes, but that would be amazing in a fight." 'Kill him, Steve!' 'I'm trying to, but I'm too horny!' Either that, or he'd be "in a zoo, causing a great deal of mischief".

    Comic Books 

## Marvel Universe:

-   _Alpha Flight_: In her first appearance, Kara Killgrave/Purple Girl (later Persuasion) uses her newly manifested powers to try to compel Northstar into being her boyfriend. It doesn't go too far, but the perv potential is there. As a matter of fact, Kara is herself a _product_ of Power Perversion Potential — she's the Child by Rape of the Purple Man and his first, unwilling 'lover'.
-   _Ant-Man_:
    -   Became canon for Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, who have size-altering abilities (as Ant-Man/Giant Man and the Wasp, respectively). One issue after Marvel Comics discarded The Comics Code shows<small>◊</small> Janet writhing in pleasure, apparently all by herself, naked on her bed... only for a miniature, and equally naked, Hank to emerge from the shadows between her breasts and announce "Your turn."
    -   Eric O'Grady, the third Ant-Man, would later use his shrinking to spy on two women showering _on two different occasions_. Unintended versions of this have also popped up with him ending up in the second Black Widow's top as well as being able to get a close up of the Skrull Queen's plans.
-   _Black Panther_ has Vibraxas: Master of Vibration, which was a bit of a Running Gag during the Christopher Priest run, and lampshaded by his girlfriend Queen Divine Justice after she first heard the name.
-   The canonization of this trope actually led to the C-list _Black Widow_ villain "The Mandrill" basically being removed. The Mandrill is a mutant who secretes addictive sex pheromones, turning him into a Living Aphrodisiac that functions like a female-exclusive version of More than Mind Control. He's also an out-and-proud misogynist who shamelessly uses his powers to sexually exploit women for his own pleasure. He also happens to be a humanoid mandrill, for that little extra bit of squick. For obvious reasons, the character's use declined significantly over the years, and he was eventually killed off in the _Hunted_ storyline... for a time.
-   _Fantastic Four_:
    -   In addition to the references in the films mentioned below, _Heroes Reborn: Fantastic Four_ has a scene in which Rubber Man Reed reveals that he's been offered a part in a porn film, but turned it down; Sue comments that now, no one but her will ever know the _real_ reason why he's called Mr. Fantastic.
    -   This appears in the 616-universe main canon as well. Scene: Sue is pissed because a social worker says that the FF's home is an unsafe environment and is trying to take her kids away. Reed comes home and starts putting the moves on Sue to relieve her tension. Cut to sometime later in Reed and Sue's bedroom. Sue is lying on the bed in a daze and says, in very wobbly text, "Have I ever mentioned what a... **wonderful** set of abilities you acquired from those cosmic rays?" Even Stan Lee himself brought this up in an interview with Vanity Fair.
    -   Played with in the _Marvel Mangaverse_, in which Reed Richards bemoans how "useless" his powers are and how he only uses them to stretch his brain to make himself slightly smarter... said to a group of naked women he's in bed with.
-   The Purple Man (originally from _Daredevil_) has super-pheromones, much like Daken, except a lot stronger: he can use them to make people do whatever he wants (and they can last for quite a while before they get flushed out of a victim's system). Being a villain, he uses the power for sex constantly. He's even fathered children with mind-controlled women (the first of whom left him when he fell in love with her and let her free to prove to himself it wasn't just his power forcing her to love him back; he was wrong). In _Alias_, the very first thing he does to Jessica Jones is force her to strip for him. Oddly, she insists that he never had sex with her, though he did compel her to love him and force her to watch him raping other women _while wishing she was them_ (seemingly abusing the low-level superheroine to get back at his main enemy Daredevil by proxy).
-   The Hood: What's the first thing Parker does with his demonic powers? Turn invisible and sneak into the women's locker room at a local gym.
-   _Runaways_:
    -   Karolina is in a relationship with shapeshifting alien Xavin. Xavin tries to seduce Karolina in the form of Nico, a girl Karolina had a crush on. Also, their entire relationship may not have happened without Xavin's shapeshifting, given that Xavin was introduced in a male form. He says that Skrulls can change gender at will and so have no concept of fixed gender, and remains in female form from that point onward. However other Skrulls continue to refer to him as 'Prince Xavin' and near the end of the last run of The Runaways Molly confronts him with the fact that everyone but Karolina can see that he is living a lie to please her.
    -   Chase used a pair of X-ray goggles on Karolina and Nico, and it naturally had the "see underneath clothes" setting.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Chase being Chase, he notably forgets to use the goggles for their intended purpose later, _despite wearing them_.
-   _The Eternals_: Starfox has the power to control the emotions of others. In one _She-Hulk_ arc, a suit is brought against him by some, including She-Hulk herself, who may have been forced into sex with him thanks to his powers. (The man's real name is _Eros_, after all.)
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   Webs. As a matter of fact, Todd McFarlane wrote an implicitly explicit (consensual) bondage foreplay scene<small>◊</small> (between Peter and his wife Mary Jane Watson) into an issue during his short run on the explicitly-created-for-him _Spider-Man_ (no adjective) series from the early 1990s.
    -   In one _Marvel Knights_ storyline, Electro is seen frequenting a brothel with a mutant prostitute who can assume any form a customer desires. She seems to specialize in super-heroines, but mentioned that some customers with fetishes had requested rather unusual ones, even Fin Fang Foom. Her conversation with Electro is cut off by Spidey breaking into the place before he can tell her what he wants, so there's no way to tell.
    -   The Chameleon, a shapeshifter and Master of Disguise, provides a very creepy example. On one occasion when he discovers Spidey's secret identity, he disguises himself as Peter with the intention of committing a Bed Trick on Mary Jane. It doesn't get further than kissing, however, as she is immediately able to tell that he's not Peter (it helps that she deliberately slips him some misinformation that the real Peter would have known to be wrong, just to make sure). When MJ calls him out on it, Chameleon then turns into a stereotypical muscular hunk, and then a sophisticated-looking older man, to show that he can take any physical visage she might fantasize about, before shifting back to his normal form with the intention of taking her by force anyway. Unfortunately for him, though, this is the moment when MJ beats the ever-loving crap out of him with a baseball bat.
-   There's a brief scene in _Thanos Rising_ in which a Skrull shapeshifter is shown being touted as a Sex Slave.
    
    **Slaver:** Spend the night with a genuine **Skrull!** She can be whoever you want her to be! All decent trades accepted!
    
-   _Thunderbolts_: Karla Sofen/Moonstone's powers include, among other things, complete control over the shape and composition of her suit. Which she once happily used while flirting with Hawkeye to instantly strip in front of him.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   In _X-Men_ #111, Beast discovers that Mesmero has abducted the entire team of X-Men and placed them under mind control, forcing them to act as performers and menial labor in a circus for the past several weeks. Jean Grey mentions that she has been "dating" Mesmero during this time. The implication of Jean's repeated rape has never been addressed on-panel. A subsequent story showing how Mesmero managed to catch the X-Men revealed that Jean's Phoenix powers flared up automatically when Mesmero tried to take advantage of Jean physically, threatening to undo his hypnosis and putting her firmly on a "look but don't touch" rule. The other women held captive by Mesmero at the time, however...
    -   The highly debatable Chuck Austen run has the Polaris/Havok wedding, in which a stripper changes shape while X-Men call out well-known female superheroes. The girls are having a similarly good time thanks to Emma Frost casting illusions.
    -   In _New X-Men_, Emma Frost uses her powers to psychically seduce Scott Summers. It is not taken well by his wife Jean Grey, the other resident psychic. Frost also uses her powers to neutralize a hostile group of reporters, male and female, by making them orgasm themselves into a faint.
    -   Another issue of _New X-Men_ reveals that the Hellfire Club employs telepathic dancers who can choose any form requested by their clients. A drunken and depressed Cyclops asks one of the women to transform into Jean Grey, who had recently broken up with him.
    -   Daken is the contemporary classic example of the Depraved Bisexual because aside from the obvious claws/regeneration/bone strength he got from his father, he can also manipulate and release pheromones from himself, making people he chooses aggressive, losing their senses of perception and general thinking, or, more relevant to this trope, _horny as all hell_. He's tried this on female _and_ male targets, some of whom note specifically to him that they're immune to that ability. Magnificent Bastard as he is, it goes without saying that he often uses this power to his advantage. In _Dark Avengers_, he also uses this on Bullseye and Moonstone.
    -   X-23 spent some time after escaping the Facility as a child prostitute. Her specialty was using her claws to cut masochistic clients.
    -   _Uncanny X-Men_ #469 has Project O\*N\*E monitor Rachel Grey as she showers. Their technology scans everything possible, ensuring that her physical vitals are consistent with baseline species parameters. It's also noted that she's cute, too. Colonel Reyes makes an appearance and reminds his staff that they are soldiers and scientists, not voyeurs.
    -   Laurie Collins a.k.a. Wallflower and her father, Sean Garrison, possess a similar pheromone-manipulating ability to Daken. Garrison took full of this, using it to seduce women such as Laurie's mother, which led to her conception. Laurie inherited her father's mutation, and her desire to _avert_ this trope (partially due to Power Incontinence) led to her often isolating herself from other students. However, she _has_ also used it for selfish ends herself, such as trying to make Elixir jealous by using her pheromones to seduce Prodigy into kissing her.
    -   In _Astonishing X-Men_, when Kitty Pryde and Colossus first have sex (after his resurrection), she phases through the bed and floor when she orgasms. Not _quite_ as useful as it could have been.
    -   In one issue of _Dark X-Men_, Norman Osborn threatens Mystique by telling her he knows of an upper-class brothel in Dubai where the men would pay top dollar for sex with a shapeshifter.
    -   One issue of _Uncanny X-Men_ features a brothel staffed entirely by mutants who use their mutant powers to please clients, like a telepathic woman who gives them a mental simulation of amazing sex with whomever they wanted and Stacy X, who, like many other examples on this page, has pheromone powers. This being _X-Men_, another trope quickly comes into play when the brothel is attacked by anti-mutant extremists and all the workers but Stacy are killed.
    -   Siryn/Banshee (Theresa Cassidy) of X-Force/X-Corporation/X-Factor has always had a crush on Multiple Man (Jamie Madrox). When they were working together in Paris, she was shown to be really interested in his self-orgy potential, even asking their teammate M (Monet St. Croix) something along the lines of "Come on, are you telling me you never thought about it?". Of course, snobbish as she is, Monet didn't want to continue the conversation. Later on, when the three of them were part of X-Factor Investigations, it turned out that: A) Monet _was_ actually interested; B) Jamie actually _did_ use his powers to improve his sex life, but in a different and more obvious way... by sleeping with both girls during the same night. Later, after Jamie Madrox married Layla Miller, it was confirmed in at least one issue that Layla enjoyed a threesome with two Jamies.
    -   In _Legion of X_ #4, Zsen comments how Nightcrawler's tail contributed to make sex with him that great.

## The DCU

-   Discussed in the "Bright Lights, Big City" arc of Karl Kesel's run in the first _Harley Quinn_ comic. While Harley and Poison Ivy are staying in Metropolis together, Ivy decides to do some nude sunbathing on the roof. When Harley points out the high probability that Superman might happen to be passing by and catch quite an eyeful of her, Ivy scoffs that he's got X-Ray Vision, and she can't believe he wouldn't use it to get quite an eyeful of her anyway.
-   Superman's X-Ray Vision is actually discussed and deconstructed in _Superman: American Alien_. Clark is jokingly asked if he uses it for perverted purposes, and he explains that bodies don't exactly look sexy when they're crammed into clothes.
-   A scene in the _Harley Quinn (2019)_ tie-in comic miniseries _The Eat. Bang! Kill. Tour_ strongly implies that Vixen (who can mimic the traits of any animal) gives herself the long, prehensile tongue of a giraffe in order to orally pleasure her girlfriend.
-   Conner Kent's first use of his X-Ray vision was to look at Tana Moon with them.
-   One issue of the _Justice League International_ revival mini-series implies that Elongated Man uses his stretching abilities to pleasure his wife.
-   In one issue of _Manhunter (DC Comics)_, Dylan Battles (the techie of Kate Spencer) says that he could alter her suit so that she would "feel like she was in a state of perpetual org—" before being cut off.
-   _JLA (1997)_:
    -   Tommy Monaghan once showed up for a JLA membership drive for the sole purpose of using his X-Ray Vision on Wonder Woman.
    -   Plastic Man poses as Big Barda's dress<small>◊</small>, sending her into an Unstoppable Rage upon discovery. After Grant Morrison's run, Grace once admits to having gone out with him and assures Roy Harper that there were "advantages", and a later issue sees Diana bust him before he can peep on her changing.
-   Matt Cable, Abby's first husband in _Swamp Thing_, eventually gained a kind of limited Reality Warper power, one that he used to create psychic projections that would sexually pleasure him. This eventually led him into the clutches of her evil father, Anton Arcane. There's a reason why Matt later had a lot of bad karma to work off in bird form.
-   The Apokoliptian Sleez may have been the king of this trope (the reason why the story in question is considered a black mark on John Byrne's career). Incidentally, this doubles as a sort of inversion of Cut Lex Luthor a Check. One could say that the adult film industry is, indeed, a profitable — if controversial — business, but if you had powers of brainwashing that could enslave both Superman _and_ Barda, forcing them to star in such a film might not be the most effective way to use them.
-   In _Watchmen_, the god-like Dr. Manhattan can change size, control matter and duplicate himself. There's a scene with him and Silk Spectre where he creates _two_ of himself in the bedroom. This creeps out Laurie, especially when she runs into the lab to find _two more_ duplicates working on an experiment.
-   Clayface and Martian Manhunter can shapeshift into _any_ beautiful, smoking hot woman! Squick indeed.
-   _Legion of Super-Heroes_:
    -   An event similar to the event with Jamie Madrox above showed up during the Mark Waid reboot. Three male legionnaires who have an interest in Triplicate Girl go on dates with her, and one finally asks if she ever considered using her Self-Duplication power during a date. She replies, somewhat surprised, that she already is. The three then discover they'd been on the date with her _at the same time_. All three quickly excuse themselves and head to the nearest bar.
    -   A more innocent variation occurs during the classic stories when Luornu Durgo (then going by the name Duo Damsel) is first dating Chuck "Bouncing Boy" Taine. One issue shows Luornu splitting into two bodies, each one kissing Chuck on opposite cheeks at the same time.
    -   The fourth annual of the 1989 series, which was an installment of the _Bloodlines_ Crisis Crossover, has a teenager from the 20th century named Jamm gain the ability to make anyone do what he tells them to, with two occasions having him use his power to make Night Girl and Shadow Lass disrobe in front of him.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   Her lasso of truth. Gift from the gods. Unbreakable weapon beyond mortal understanding. Really good for making your friends embarrass themselves by blurting out the truth at inopportune moments.
    -   In an issue of _Sensation Comics_, Wonder Woman says there's an entire kink subculture consisting of men and women who want to be punched or smacked by her. She then relates a story about how she once agreed to punch a rich guy for ten million dollars, and then used the money to fund daycare centers in low-income communities.
-   _Teen Titans_: Shapeshifting Team Titans member Mirage once impersonated Teen Titans member Starfire in order to infiltrate the latter team... and to unapologetically sleep with Starfire's unaware teammate and boyfriend Nightwing.
    -   Speaking of Starfire, she learns a language through physical contact with a person. If that person happens to be cute, she prefers to kiss him.
-   In _Another Nail_, a sequel to _The Nail_, Scott Free/Mister Miracle, in order to escape being tortured by DeSaad, wills his body to die and projects his disembodied mind into the Mother Box circuitry incorporated in his wife Big Barda's armor. Later Barda receives a Green Lantern ring, which she uses to give Scott an energy construct body, but for much of the story his mind remains in Big Barda's armor. He implies at one point that he enjoys the situation; while his mind is in Barda's armor, he is in constant contact with her body.
-   The Green Lantern's power ring energy is capable of being used to create simple energy blasts and barriers, but it can also be used to create more complex constructs that the wielder can imagine and sustain through willpower, such as swords, bazookas, or clones of people. Shortly after Kyle Rayner first got his ring, while practicing how to make complex constructs with it, he made a skimpily dressed clone of his girlfriend...right in front of said un-amused girlfriend, who smacked him for being a smart-ass.
-   _Batman Beyond_: The _Beyond Origin_ revealing Micron's origins has a panel of Micron as a teenager using his shrinking powers to commit voyeurism in the girl's locker room by hiding in a box of tampons.

## Other

-   Gadgeteer Genius The Engineer from _The Authority_ has, in Canon, justifiably described herself as a "closet exhibitionist". As a superhero, she parades around buck naked in the Chrome Champion form which she can transform into thanks to the nanotechnology in her blood. During her on-again, off-again relationship with Jack Hawksmoor, she uses her nanotech abilities to split herself into two autonomous copies. This is while _another_ of her bodies that she's mentally controlling is giving a lecture. One could only imagine what would happen if she got her wires crossed.
-   Jules from _Bazooka Jules_ transforms into a superpowered adult version of herself with large breasts thanks to a micro-robotic weapon that fused with her body. While her transformations only happen when she's in danger, her boyfriend hopes that she'll eventually learn to transform at will.
-   Takes a dark turn in _The Boys_, where just about every super is a depraved hedonist with superhuman strength and endurance and the money to cover it up. Jupiter Jack turns himself invulnerable and has prostitutes beat him up, the Professor X expy is a pedophile, the Tek-Knight has a brain tumor that urges him to have sex with random objects (a donut, a cup of coffee, his butler's ear...). And every once in a while the supers announce a major threat to humanity that causes heroes and villains to face the threat together... by which they mean go to an isolated hotel for a few days of nonstop fornication, boozing, and getting high.
-   In the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ Season 8 comics, the entirety of an issue is spent with Buffy and Angel finding various ways to enjoy their new-found superpowers, including the phrase, "Do you want to try it flying now?"
-   _ElfQuest_:
    -   Leetah has healing powers, which are essentially flesh-shaping magic. It's been hinted at (once vaguely by the original authors, once explicitly in a Running the Asylum plotline) that she uses her powers to make sex _quite_ interesting.
    -   Various scenes and lines from the original volumes onward make it clear that elves who can Send (which is almost all of them) do so during lovemaking. It's referenced in a way that implies they consider that kind of mind-to-mind intimacy during sex to be a given.
-   _Empowered_, being a "sexy superhero comedy", has many examples:
    -   Emp's suit enhances her libido.
    -   Mindf\*\*k used telepathy to have a Mental Affair with Sistah Spooky under everyone's noses. They call it "mindfriends with benefits".
    -   Ninjas have disguise jutsus... And are stated to use it for having sex under pretence. In fact, Ninjette, female ninja who is stated to be the best at it, once consummated a marriage _as the groom_.
    -   A superhero who was turned into a robot by alien nanomachines has used his sensors to scan various female superheroes' bodies and then combined their best features in a sexy image for fapping.
    -   Anglerfish said that his son, who had the same illusion powers as him, used them to get laid.
-   _Flex Mentallo_'s final feat before reaching the headquarters of the vanished League of Leagues is to wade through a superhero orgy complete with every possible use of superpowers that crossed Grant Morrison's mind.
-   In the _Invincible_ comic books, Dupli-Kate, whose power is exactly what her name suggests, has a habit of using it to engage in threesomes (or more) with her lovers. In one early issue, Atom Eve accidentally discovers her boyfriend fooling around with Kate and Kate and Kate.
-   In _Ironwood_, Ignagio Pec finds a ... _unique_ use for a hydra's head spell, transforming his member into a multi-headed piece of Exotic Equipment to enable him to pleasure several different females at the same time.
-   Burrows, a psychic from _Irredeemable_, uses his psychic powers to make people imagine themselves naked, and then takes "mental snapshots" when they do.
-   _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ recruits Hawley Griffin/The Invisible Man from inside a girl's school where several girls think they've been sexed by the Holy Spirit, planning to go ahead with their "virgin births".
-   _Red Ears_: Played for laughs in a pinup page parodying _Pinocchio_ where the Blue Fairy suggests that Pinoccchio lie a lot to make his nose grow.
-   _Top 10_ plays a lot with this trope. Imagine what the red-light district of a city where _everyone_ from mayor to stray cat has superpowers must be like. To quote an officer from the eponymous police precinct: "You've got splitters, stretchers, shapeshifters, invisibles, aliens...". There is apparently a huge market for mud-wrestling invisible women.
-   _The Ten-Seconders_: Mach is a very depraved take on this; he's a Super Speedster who enjoys raping women and implies that he uses his power to make it as painful as possible.
-   Already in the second issue of _W.I.T.C.H._ Irma has used the fact the Guardian transformation makes her older and hotter to get a date with an older boy, only to accidentally turn him into a toad when he tried some Auto Erotica. Will's reaction indicates that Irma wasn't the only one to think about it, just the first to actually _do_ it.
    -   _All_ the Guardians later take advantage of this for missions, using their looks to distract people while they do their job.

    Fan Works 

Fans _always_ find ways to pervert powers and the like, for rather obvious reasons, with Kink Memes naturally being particularly prone. Thus only specific examples should be listed.

-   _Harry Potter_ fics:
    -   Cassandra Claire's popular _Draco Trilogy_ features a Polyjuice brothel.
    -   The fanfic _Backward With Purpose_ has a scene where Ginny mentions that some couples "play with Polyjuice Potion."
    -   This Fan Comic: "Polyjuice Potion"
    -   _If Them's the Rules_ has a very creepy example where Harry's stalker uses polyjuice on a prostitute to make him look like Harry.
    -   Harry Potter and the spellbook of desires & Harry Potter and The Legacy of Hogwarts (second and third series from the top DL ONLY), an Epic 40+ chapters of X-rated connected fan fiction, which involves multiple perverse uses of Stupefy spell, Obliviate, Lumos (you just have to read it), polyjuice potion and a few others.
    -   In _Harry Potter and the Charm of Venus_, Hermione, under an Imperius Curse, uses a paralyzing charm on Harry, then proceeds to explain to him in detail a spell she learned on her own that will give her control over his _hormones_ and can only be broken if Harry sleeps with enough other girls in about one month. A fun little spoiler:twins are considered one magical being.
    -   The infamous _My Immortal_ has broomsticks used as a peeping-tom platform, curses used in S&M, and a number of other items.
    -   In _Aspirations_, Ginny comments on checking on whether Parselmouths were more capable with their tongues, and happily confirming so.
    -   Several stories, such as _What's a Little Death between friends?_, point out the advantages of being a metamorphmagus in the bedroom. Though an almost equal number describe how hard it is for a metamorph to find someone that's interested in them for more than their powers.
        -   _For Love of Magic_ takes it further with Tonks changing into fictional characters such as Lady Death and Tyrande Whisperwind.
    -   Harry in _The Havoc Side of the Force_ uses Legilimency to read his partner's mind to figure out what they like in bed.
    -   _Child of the Storm_ has the bedroom based advantages of being a telepath made clear by Betsy.
        -   A more PG version is alluded to with Harry, mainly in terms of Jean-Paul making dirty jokes and insinuations about what Harry and Carol might end up doing with Harry's newly developed Psychic Powers (and later, their accidentally formed Psychic Link). Initially, it only manifests as UST and psychic flirting, but there's quite clearly the potential for more when Harry has to reach through the link and possess her (with her consent). The language in the scene features a lot of words like 'penetrating', and hints that it's rather, ahem, pleasant. This is not lost on either Harry or Carol.
        -   In the sequel, _Ghosts of the Past_, Clark Kent is mortally embarrassed by his X-Ray Vision when it comes through, particularly by the way that Jean-Paul (and later, Harry) will inevitably tease him/bust a gut laughing.
    -   If the reader needed any more proof, after 98 chapters, that _Partially Kissed Hero_ was written primarily as a power fantasy, chapter 98 has Harry receive a magic lamp which can shrink him and more than a thousand women down to fit inside it, and split Harry into as many copies as there are partners, for the sole purpose of letting him have sex with them all at the same time. Keep in mind, he doesn't have anywhere near that many girlfriends, but McGonagall (his teacher!) gives it to him because anything less would be unable to satisfy "his needs".
-   _The Awakening of a Magus_ has Tonks mention she sometimes used her true appearance (extremely beautiful, but one everyone assumed was an artificial one) for a boyfriend who wanted a perfect lover, but ultimately found it degrading to be used like that.
-   _Naru-Hina Chronicles Mini-sodes_: This is the subject of a discussion between Naruto and Hinata. The former asks the latter if she ever used her Byakugan to see through people's clothes. Heavily blushing and having Blank White Eyes, Hinata replies she never did that and that the Byakugan does not even work that way (or at least she doesn't think so).
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ fics:
    -   _Last Child of Krypton_: Shinji has –among other powers- X-ray vision, telescopic vision, super speed… however he makes a conscious effort to not use them in improper ways. So, when Asuka is taking a shower and getting dressed in their apartment he is careful to look anywhere but at the space she would occupy.
    -   _Nobody Dies_ has Lilith's Anti-AT field compelling everyone to have sex with the nearest person of the opposite gender. It's entirely intentional on Lilith's part. Yui even mentions that when she and Gendo found the Geofront, they were trapped in Lilith's chamber for two hours. Nine months later, Shinji was born. Sixteen years later, Shinji and Asuka almost fell into the same situation, had it not for Misato standing by with high-pressure cold water<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
    -   _Superwomen of Eva 2: Lone Heir of Krypton_: When Asuka was still discovering her new powers her X-ray vision accidentally activated right when Shinji was changing clothes.
    -   _Thousand Shinji_: Shinji does this repeatedly with Asuka. He uses his remote viewing to spy on her as she is undressing, and later he uses his telepathy and telekinesis to give her physical pleasure. ("Mmmm... remote viewing, it's a beautiful thing!") After their ascension to godhood, Shinji and their three queens can shape-shift. Misato implies that he uses that power during lovemaking when she states that they can teach someone how "to fuck three girls up the ass at the same time and blow their minds".
-   The _Sith Academy_ fanfic series starts with "Force-driven monkey love" around story #27 and runs wild with it.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ fics:
    -   _Haruna's Most EroEro Adventure_, predictably given the title, has Haruna use her artifact to bring people's fantasies to life as a money-making scheme. Trouble is, she can't resist adding her own touches to them...
    -   Similarly, _Artifact Abuse_ is basically a compilation of Haruna horribly misusing her artifact in various ways.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ has Toph, who is blind but can "see" vibrations via her earthbending. Many fans have noted the voyeuristic potential of being able to see through walls, or even through clothes... as well as the Brain Bleaching downside to her tremor-sense, given that she can't turn it off as long as she's touching solid ground.
-   _Luminosity_ uses this trope to give us a one-line sex scene.
    
    _Among the enhanced vampire senses is touch._
    
-   The _Golden Sun Gag Battle_ doujinshi 4koma anthology goes into Psynergy Perversion Potential a few times, such as using Catch to flip Mia's skirt or Reveal to spy through people's clothes.
-   In _The Life of the Legendaries_, the super-high tech cosplay costumes (which turn the wearers into Pokémon) are mentioned to have been put to use for... unclean purposes. And demonstrated when a cosplayer in a Gardevoir costume uses the costume's psychic powers to remove a waitress's dress in a hotel restaurant.
-   _Dragon Age: The Crown of Thorns_ has a scene where the dwarven noble protagonist and the elven mage Warden (all Origin wardens are recruited) briefly discuss the fact that Alim could use his blood magic on any woman if he wanted to assuage his needs. Alim, fortunately, has a distinct hate for mind control and the demons that use/encourage it.
-   The _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fic _Romance Reports_ not only goes into all the fun ways that telekinesis can be applied to sex, but also demonstrates that a sufficiently talented telekinetic doesn't even need sex toys, and can simulate any of their effects from thin air (much to Cheerilee's delight). Furthermore, several side stories demonstrate that earth ponies possessing greater stamina than unicorns and pegasi doesn't only apply to manual labour (much to Rainbow Dash's frustration).
-   In _Kyon: Big Damn Hero_, Yuki, Mikuru, Kyon and Kanae train regularly for about a year of relative time each night. In order to not overwhelm the trainees with years of memories, only Yuki remembers the events in the training, though all can access the results of their training. When it becomes necessary for them to change their training and Kyon lets Yuki choose what to do, Yuki makes Kyon kiss her, inadvertently training him into an excellent make-out partner.
-   A disturbing NSFW _Super Mario Bros._ short story (12,000+ words) titled "Peach's Double Life", features Bowser using his size-changing power during a sexual intercourse, then healing his partner, Princess Peach, from nearly fatal wounds from the size change with the Green Mushroom. It gets worse...it goes into a detailed account of Bowser Jr's spiky shell, unknowingly, used for the sexual pleasure of Peach, as she births him.
-   In _The Auction_, Luke tells Mara that now he understands why the old Jedi Order forbid relationships... with Force-enhanced sex, no Jedi would ever leave the bed otherwise. (According to Word of God, the Jedi had no problem with sex, just with relationships.)
-   _Death Note_ fics:
    
    -   In _Fever Dreams_ this is Matsuda's fear:
    
    **Matsuda**: Kira can control people. Maybe he's going to make all of us have sex with each other.
    
    -   Inverted in _Sex Note_ where Light Yagami uses a magical sex toy to change the world and put an end to rapes.
-   Discussed in _Final Fantasy VII_ fanfic _The Fifth Act_ when Zack asks Sephiroth and Cloud a question. Since they can track each other and feel what the other is feeling with their S-Cells, would they share sensory input if they had sex with each other?
-   In the _Frozen_ fanfic _Sorry About The Mess_, it's implied that Elsa had some interesting ideas on how to utilize her ice powers in regards to her ability to create living snowmen.
-   In _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ doujinshi _Thanks Kyubey_, Madoka herself remarks that the eternal youth and durability of a Magical Girl would be great for one's love life.
    
    But if you \[Sayaka\] become a magical girl, you can handle rough play and you won't ever get old, right? Isn't that the ideal wife?
    
-   In the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer/X-Men: Evolution_ crossover _Alexander Creed_, a much more hygienic Toad starts licking a bowl of brownie mix. Every girl stops and stares, with one fainting. Later on, one character walks in on Kitty and Toad after they've taken the Super-Soldier Serum. It's not explicitly stated what's happening, but when Toad asks Kitty a muffled question about what was happening, her eyes cross and he has to repeat it with his voice not muffled.
-   The very NSFW _Per-Verse_ by TattleTail offers Xander a choice between worlds represented as different game servers. The Alternate Universe where they're all superheroes is tempting, but he ultimately decides on the kinkiest one available. Completing quests in one universe allows you to import elements of it to others, so he has won the ability to create sexualized pocket dimensions based on any reality he has access to. It's been implied, but not confirmed, that he can enter and transform _any_ story he can think of.
-   In canon, Sailor Venus has the apparent ability to bring couples together by just staying around them for a while. In the Italian version of _Battle Fantasia Project_, it's said she sometimes puts herself near two (or more) people in love who Cannot Spit It Out for some reason to bring them together-possibly in a bed. Has created at least one harem that way.
-   _Beauty and the Beast_, the magic mirror, you will never think of the Beast the same way again.
-   In _Vapors_ it is repeatedly brought up that Hiraishin would make it ridiculously easy to have an affair with someone in another village. When Temari finds out that Gaara has a seal that would let him instantly summon a nubile teenaged girl (Aiko, an original character who is Naruto's sister and the Hiraishin user) she explicitly refers to it as "Booty Call no Jutsu".
-   Generally averted in _Code Geass_ fanfics: the protagonists' Mind Controlling Magic Eye is rarely, if ever, used for this sort of thing in fanfics. While the potential uses for a mind controlling magic eye on a borderline Villain Protagonist are obvious, few if any fans want to even go there.
    -   This is partially attributed to the fact that of his canonical love interests: C.C is naturally immune to it, he uses his power on Kallen early on in the series, and Shirley is generally exempt from a combination of her own geass affliction, and being less popular than the other two.
    -   The fourth chapter of _Experiments_ has a rare example of this in the fandom, with Lelouch using his geass for rather perverted reasons (with some rationale behind them) including, but not limited to: having meek Nina wear push up bras and thongs to make her more confident, have Shirley react to Milly's perverse antics with her own to not only amuse himself but also to train Milly out of the habit before Nunnally gets older, and have the swim club of his school pose for his own swimsuit calendar. However it's revealed at the end of the chapter that these were just ideas C.C was offering and not actual uses: he even points out various faults in her ideas, such as that Nina already wears push up bras and that they make no difference and how he has no use for such a calendar.
    -   In _The Black Emperor_, Milly's used her Geass (which allows her to control emotions) to inspire lust in others, but only as a way to prove her power exists. Nina's Geass lets her upload her mind/soul into computers and accidentally watches some of Lelouch and Milly's "home videos".
    -   After Lelouch becomes immortal in _Darwin_, he notes that his new Healing Factor doesn't so much heal as it resets his body to where he's fully healthy and rested. As a result, Lelouch is inexhaustible during sex as his healing factor simply deals with any fatigue or soreness.
-   _With This Ring_:
    -   Alan Scott comments when he first meets Orange Lantern that he can use his greed powers to take anyone he wants. The suggestion disgusts Orange Lantern. The Renegade OL used his ring to increase his physical sensation which he uses with his girlfriend.
    -   Also subverted as the Paragon OL used his ring to turn off his libido.
    -   Martian J'onn J'aarkn made a career as a porn star using his shapeshifting and telepathy to be anything his partners desired.
-   Why the evil creatures are all Hell-Bent for Leather in _Dungeon Keeper Ami_:
    
    "The simple answer is that people like the style. The complicated answer is 'fucking warlocks'. You know how them frockwearers are always finding new ways to use magic to make people's lives miserable? Yeah, one of those wiseguys a few hundred years back got the bright idea that, hey, there had to be a way to see through fabric to the skin below. There was."
    
-   In the _Reaching for a Dream_ series, once Naruto and Xanna obtain godhood, they spend a decade doing almost nothing but having sex and finding new ways to use their powers for sex. It got to the point that (several hundred years later) when Naruto showed Vala what it's like to have sex with a god, he has to dull her memory of the event lest she be rendered permanently catatonic. He notes that Akitsu needed decades before he stopped having to do that. Earlier, this is played straight and inverted. Minato figured out how to use the swirling chakra principle of the Rasengan to stimulate his wife's erogenous zones. His son Naruto, figured out the Rasengan very easily because he already knew the sexual application of the technique first.
-   In the Peggy Sue fic _I Am NOT Going Through Puberty Again!_, Sasuke and Sakura use the former's Tsukuyomi to have _72 consecutive hours of sex in a few seconds_. Naruto also uses the Sexy no Jutsu to peep on his own transformed clones.
-   _Pony POV Series_:
    -   Prince Blueblood mentions using X-Ray Vision to peep on mares. Since most ponies are naked anyway, he presumably does it while they are bathing or some other private activity.
    -   Film Critique used the power of the blue shard of the Rainbow of Light to become an Evil Overlord and brainwash mares into becoming his Sex Slaves.
-   In another _MLP_ fic (_MLP: FML_), Luna is left in charge of Canterlot and starts abusing her (political) powers, making it illegal for one of the nobles to wear pants.
    
    “Walk around without pants?” asked Fancypants. He looked down at his freshly pressed pants. “I haven’t done that since college…” He smiled and shrugged. “Oh well, you’re the Princess!” Luna watched as Fancypants removed his trousers. “I love this job…” she muttered, taking another drink.
    
-   In _The Zeppo In The Mind_, once Xander and Faith get used to him taking up residence in her mind, they start using their ability to influence each other's minds by giving whichever is sleeping intense sex dreams. Furthermore, at least once a day, Xander takes control of Faith's arms and masturbates her. It's implied that feelings are more intense for them since they're both feeling the sensations and feeling what the other feels.
-   One of the oneshots in _Mysteries of the Seas_ has Monet make an offhand comment about how fun Nico Robin's powers are in the bedroom.
-   In _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_, Cirelle attempts to get in the sack with each of the four to explore how their magic enhances sex. It doesn't work at all with three of them, since John's no longer attracted to human women and Paul daren't have sex with normal women (though he still has urges... unfortunately). The story doesn't go into detail about George, who wouldn't talk about his brief time with Cirelle, but the implication is that she wanted him to assume different forms during sex, and he was repulsed and refused.
    -   Ringo, on the other hand... he and Cirelle have a _good_ time. Twice.
-   In _A Match Made in Frost_, the Cuckoos use their telepathy in two different ways during sex. First, Celeste reads Xander's memories of his time with Faith to copy her technique. Second, since Celeste accidentally transmits her pleasure via telepathy, her sisters indulge in it while feeding her some of the pleasure they're feeling to create a feedback loop.
-   In _Command_, Spock has very few qualms about using his telepathic ability to take control of Jim's body and, eventually, mind. Jim is rather happy to go along with it.
-   In _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, Evanna _loves_ it when Belladonna uses Poison Fang during their make out sessions.
-   In The Stinger for the _Mystery Kids_ fan animatic, Lili uses her telepathy to pick up on Coraline, Dipper, and Mabel's...dirtier thoughts and point out how dirty they are, thoroughly embarrassing the three of them.
-   In _CRME_, Cinder uses her fire powers at a low level to make kissing and sex more intense for her partner. And Emerald is pleased with the results. The author says this idea originated in another fic of theirs which is more explicit.
-   Pauline reminiscences in _25m Distance Between Us_ about a time when her ex-boyfriend Mario turned Super Mario to save her from Donkey Kong. She was curious about what else became bigger thanks to the Super Mushroom.
-   Inverted in _And the Beggar did Ride_. One of Xander's three wishes to a Djinn is the be a physical match for anyone he had sex with<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . As Faith points out, having sex with a Slayer would give Xander the physical abilities of one (until he has sex with someone else).
-   As the Gamer in _Fate: Gamer Night_, Shirou has a body that is immune to exhaustion or fatigue. When he has to hire a prostitute due to a blessing/curse from a succubus, she's completely exhausted long before he is.
-   In _Neither a Bird nor a Plane, it's Deku!_, Mineta and Kaminari bring up the possibility of peeking through the girls' clothes when they learn Izuku has X-Ray Vision. This mortifies Izuku, who is luckily spared the wrath of the girls' Pervert Revenge Mode because they know he's too meek and polite to try something so skeevy.
-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Empath's Honeymoon", Empath and Smurfette are enjoying a honeymoon on Utopia Island when Smurfette gets Covered in Mud and must wash herself off. During her shower in the waterfall, Empath tries to use his telekinetic abilities to cop a "psychic feel" of Smurfette while she is undressed and showering. Smurfette is offended by this and tells Empath "hands off" until she comes out.
-   _The Many Dates of Danny Fenton_: The _Kim Possible_ centered spin-off, _After Many Dates: Danny and Kim_, has Danny overshadow Shego. At first, he takes a moment to admire her figure, but stops himself from going any further because Kim needs his help.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Jaune's Combat Tentacles are mistaken for Naughty Tentacles by basically everyone, partly because he keeps trying _not_ to harm people when he grabs them, which makes it look like he's doing something else. It doesn't help that no one will tell Jaune or Ruby what "tentacle hentai" is.
-   _Least Noticeable And Little Flappy_: Claire is basically a huge, invisible, super-strong teleporting Tentacle Monster. You do the math. Fortunately (for the town of Dunnich), she's _far_ too nice to use her abilities on anyone save a very special someone, and only with that entity's consent. On the evidence so far, she's a virgin.
-   _Eiga Sentai Scanranger_ provides a family-friendly variant: at the end of "The Vengeance of Emperor Toranza" B.C. and Takeshi use their time machine to try their luck with their favorite girls from _Choushinsei Flashman_ and _Space Sheriff Shaider_.
-   In _Worm/DCU_ crossover _Echoes of Yesterday_, Supergirl mentions she has X-Ray Vision, and Assault reacts by stepping between Supergirl and Battery and demanding that the former doesn't use her power to see through his partner's clothes (much to the embarrassment of both women).
    
    **Supergirl:** I can see basically every part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and I have x-ray vision now that lets me see through pretty much anything.  
    **Assault:** Hey now, you better not be sneaking any peaks on Puppy with those see-through eyes of yours.  
    **Supergirl:** Nnonono! I would never— I mean it's not like—! Oh jeez!
    
-   Discussed in _Being Meiling_:
    
    **Meiling:** Apparently, stopping time lets Sakuya do some very interesting things. As does Yuuka's plant control.
    
-   In _The Last Daughter_ rewrite, Taylor admits she's seen naked people by accident a few times.
-   In _Two For All_, Inko and Mitsuki come to the same conclusion when they see Izuku using his symbiote's tendrils to do several tasks at once in the kitchen, with Mitsuki even stating she's "Seen enough hentai to know where this is going".
-   Various _Supernatural_ shipping fics have Castiel make use of his angelic powers during sex (usually with Dean). Said powers include light reality warping and telekinesis, so he can generally remove clothing with a thought, and can banish any post-coital mess to provide optimal cuddling. There's also at least one story out there where he enhances tactile sensations and makes his mouth minty fresh to improve kisses.
-   In _Level Up (MHA)_, Izuku's own quirk appears to be sentient, perverted, and mildly sexist, so this appears often. To wit:
    -   It rates a woman's charisma based on cup size, and increases breast size when a charisma point is added. It also improves shape and relieves back pain.
    -   When they go into the \[Cove of Temptation\] dungeon, it gives the girls skimpy bikinis.
    -   When rating Nejire's flexibility it lists: Autocunnilingus.
    -   Finally, it gives Izuku the involuntary ability to teleport to one of the girls if it would create a perverted situation. Teleporting him to, in order: Itsuka's bed, Nejire's boobs in the _U.A. bathhouse in use_, and Momo's room as she tries on lingerie. The girls even invoke this to teleport Izuku around when he needs to escape.
-   In _Wilhuff Tarkin, Hero of the Rebellion_, Obi-Wan Kenobi admits that one use of the Jedi's empathic abilities is to understand how someone reacts to their touch — and does so in front of a teenaged Luke, knowing that he'd immediately catch on the potential of becoming extremely good in the bed and accept Jedi training. The narration points out that Jedi are indeed _sex gods_ — and that's one of the reasons they are supposed to be celibate, as that "had spread far more chaos than they cared to admit".
-   In _My Miraculous Academia_, when Mina realizes that Izuku can change his teammate's costumes, she emphasizes how he could have put Uraraka in any outfit he wanted. Izuku knows what she is implying and blushes madly.
-   In _Green the New Gold_, the telepathic connection between a dragon and their rider is doubled when they mate with another pair during the dragons' heat. A Weyrwoman laments that although ordinary sex is fine, it can't compare to the intensity of four beings experiencing pleasure at once.
-   The NSFW _RWBY_ fanfic _Love Hurts_:
    -   The fic is largely about how people would use their Semblances in sex. Of course, since this is a Sex Comedy rather than porn, the answer tends to be "not well." Ruby's Super-Speed gives her partner friction burns, Yang gets in a Tongue on the Flagpole situation with Blake's ice clone, Yang's own Semblance has set her bed on fire before (though she mostly got that under control years ago), and Qrow's bad luck gets supercharged and results in every female within ten feet losing their clothes in various improbable ways — and blaming him.
    -   Yang asks Weiss if she ever considered using her Semblance in sex. Weiss snarks that she has no desire to summon up shades of the Grimm she has killed in order to use for sex. Yang clarifies that she thought her binding glyphs would be useful in bondage. Weiss does try this, and for the most part it works... except that when Jaune comes home to find that she's trussed herself up naked on his bed, he faints dead away.
    -   Neo has illusion powers, and her partners often make requests of specific people they want her to become.
    -   Raven once had sex with Taiyang right as she was transforming back from bird form, as the feathers were still becoming skin. This apparently wasn't actually sexy, but points for trying.
    -   Salem has a spell to instantly give someone an orgasm. This might count as an inversion, as rather than using it for pleasure (either on herself or others), she finds it funny to cast it on Emerald at random times.
-   _New Tamaran_: Supergirl is a Sex Goddess thanks to her super-senses allowing each sexual encounter to be made into a perfect one. She's also quite The Peeping Tom.
-   When Danny reveals his powers to Luz in _Saintly Phantom_, her first and only thoughts are coming up with ways to utilize his powers in the bedroom.
-   In the _Miraculous Ladybug_ fandom, the fact that Miraculouses have appeared allowing both Time Travel and Self-Duplication has given rise to numerous Twin Threesome Fantasy fics.
-   In _These Are the Damned_, Tom mentions a British tabloid that was very interested in knowing if one could use morphing to change the size of one's penis.
-   Played for Drama in _Hyrule Warriors_, where Cia uses her magic to compel Link into having sex with her. That he's at least partially aware that he's being controlled makes the experience even more nightmarish.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_, playing Epona's Song near a cow enables Link to get a bottle's worth of milk. The story _Hylian (Milk) Maid_ has Link and Malon discovering that the song works the same way on humans.
-   With her gift, Mirabel in _The Two Seers_ wound up seeing both Antonio's conception and birth. Since she was an adolescent at the time, she describes it as two adults "wrestling naked", leaving Bruno at a loss as to how to explain it to her.
-   In _C Listers_, Mr. Camera is despised by his fellow Gotham villains for constantly using his powers to sexually harass women and take explicit photos of them without consent.
-   MarvelMaster616 loves writing about the X-Men using the Danger Room and their powers for various sexual scenarios. For example, in _Practice Makes Perfect_, Kurt is nervous due to him and Amanda about to have Their First Time, so Jean gives him some practice... by means of a holographic Amanda. She even takes a look into his mind to make the image as authentic as possible.
-   Common with Beast Boy in _Teen Titans_ fic. Sometimes, his powers allow him to do a Bigger Is Better in Bed. Sometimes, he can change the texture and length of his tongue (along with making it vibrate). In other cases, his senses allow him to figure out a girl's sweet spots better.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: Largely enforced by Spectra's backstory. Thanks to her changeling heritage and cursed necklace preventing her from wearing clothes, the only job she can find involves being a circus freak and a prostitute where clients use her to act out their sexual fantasies.
-   _Momentary Weakness_: Apparently Nia's divine-level healing powers can give her and her partners _extreme_ stamina.
-   _Outsiders (xTRESTWHOx)_: Brimir developed the Void-class spell "Teleport" after Sasha's father nearly caught him in her bedroom.
-   _The Future Briefing Island_: Part of Chapter 20 involves the idea of people using Quirks to spice up their sex lives. Izuku confesses to being into this and mentions how some of his classmates can use their Quirks for that.
    -   After Izuku gets Blackwhip, Ochako gives very deep thoughts to how they could be used in bed.
-   _The UA Girls_: After Nejire asks Ochako to use her Quirk so the former can enjoy Zero-G Spot with Izuku, Ochako says she had never considered her Quirk could be used for lewd purposes. The other girls in the chat quickly said they couldn't relate to that, with the exception of Kyoka who, until recently, hadn't considered it either.
-   Mami uses her ribbons for bondage sessions with her wife in _Resonance Days_, though she draws a line when Charlotte suggests using her ribbon clones for a threesome.
-   _Pirate Heroes_: When Izuku develops Blackwhip, his girlfriend Ochako says (with a Nosebleed) that it looks like a _fun_ power to use in the bedroom.
-   _RWBY Kink_: Some of the stories deal with the characters (particularly Jaune) using their powers for fun - Jaune's canon Semblance of boosting others' Auras is noted to be great to boost how much sex he can have in one go.

    Films — Animation 

-   Subverted in _All-Star Superman_; when inviting Lois to his Fortress of Solitude, Superman allows her to take a shower. While using it, she asks him from the other side of the wall if he is using his X-Ray vision to peep at her, commenting that she would hardly escape the temptation if she could herself. But naturally Superman isn't using it, out of respect for her privacy.
-   _The Incredibles_:
    -   One of the headlines reads about Gazerbeam being accused of using X-Ray vision as a peeping tom.
    -   Fairly innocent, but there _is_ a scene that has Helen grab her husband's ass from a distance that makes one think about the possibilities. Also implied in their Witty Banter scene.
        
        **Elastigirl:** I think you need to be more... flexible. _\[whips between Mr. Incredible's legs\]_  
        **Mr. Incredible:** _\[blinks\]_ Arrrrrre you doing anything later?
        
    -   It is also implied that Helen's elastic body operates as a solution to the Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex problem that could arise from having a husband that could literally bench-press a train car, considering that she was able to absorb the impact of an explosion of a missile colliding with their plane and only get partially dazed. One would not have three kids with a man like that if sex was a health hazard.
    -   In her NSA file, Psycwave admits to using her mental manipulation powers to make cute boys in her high school dump their girlfriends and go out with her.
-   In _Megamind_, Titan uses his X-Ray vision at one point to peep into Roxanne Ritchi's apartment.
-   _Starship Troopers: Invasion_. During a rant, one of the male soldiers gives away the fact that he's psychic. A female trooper who's the ship's Ms. Fanservice immediately turns on him. "You son-of-a-bitch! That's how come you always know when I'm in the shower!"
-   In _Superman/Batman: Public Enemies_, when the heroes consult Toyman (the teenaged Hiro Okamura version), Power Girl hangs back and lets the others go in to meet him. He asks them if they've seen her, and asks them to convey his apologies about "the X-Ray goggles" (which are now broken).

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _About Time_: Tim doesn't seem to particularly revisit his sex scenes with Mary apart from the first.
-   _Absolutely Anything_ has Neil giving himself a giant penis, Neil spying on Catherine, Neil trying to get Catherine to sleep with him, Neil making Ray's crush "worship" him, and Grant using Neil's powers to make Catherine want to have sex with him.
-   In _Blue Thunder_, while nobody has superpowers, the Metropolitan Police Astro Division apparently has a reputation for using their helicopters to "peek in" on the citizenry. The hero, Frank Murphy, gets in trouble for taking his new observer to see "the girl in Encino", an actress who likes doing nude yoga.
-   Jim Carrey uses his God powers to give Jennifer Aniston bigger boobs and make her have intense spontaneous orgasms on his command in _Bruce Almighty_. And cause a gust of wind to lift a random woman's skirt. The original script actually had him causing her boobs to grow twice more, and even giving orgasms to his coworker Susan.
-   In _Cashback_ lonely art student Ben can stop time. He uses this power to practice his drawing of the nude female form with unsuspecting supermarket patrons. Not explicitly sexual for him (though he draws only women), but for the audience — who knows?
-   _Chronicle_:
    -   Early in, Matt telekinetically switches on a leafblower and directs it to lift the skirts of a nearby girl.
        
        **Matt:** She's wearin' black today!
        
    -   Steve later implies that he uses telekinesis to subtly spice up his love life — "subtly" being the key word, since the three of them are supposed to keep their powers secret.
-   The four protagonists in _The Covenant_ use their powers for pranks. In fact, they are fully aware that magic is incredibly addictive and that, after their 18th Birthday, it goes Up to Eleven but is Cast from Hit Points, but still do it. In one scene, they are playing pool in a bar and arguing over the color of a girl's panties. One of them uses his power to lift her miniskirt, and victory goes to the one who said she went commando. They also play with cops by driving off a cliff and using their combined powers to levitate the car. The Big Bad also uses the power to win a school swimming competition.
-   Shows up in _Club Dread_. The awesome masseur demonstrates his ridiculous knowledge of the pleasure point on a pretty girl (instant orgasm), then makes another girl fall asleep, then the guy she's tied to (It Makes Sense in Context) pee himself.
-   In _Dogma_, when Rufus, Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob are eating at a breakfast place, Rufus talks about being dead (although it's not really a power).
    
    **Rufus:** You know what the dead do with most of their time? Watch the living. _Especially_ in the shower.  
    **Jay:** (_to Silent Bob_) Dude, I can't wait to die.
    
-   _Fantastic Four (2005)_:
    -   In the first film, a reporter asks if it's true that Mr. Fantastic "can expand _any part_ of his anatomy?", eliciting "oooooh"s from every woman in the background.
    -   In the second film, his fingers expand to twice their original length whilst he explains the big bang to some girls at a club, who look suitably, err, impressed.
    -   Also in the second film, Johnny's current girlfriend says in an interview that dating the Human Torch requires fireproof lingerie and a good supply of aloe (ouch!).
    -   And then there's Johnny asking Ben how he and Alicia...
        
        **Ben:** _That's none of your business!_
        
        **Ben:** I'LL SHOW YOU A ROCKSLIDE!
        
    -   In the deleted scenes, Johnny was shown riding the elevators of the Baxter Building and raising the temperature when attractive women would enter, thus forcing them to remove more and more articles of clothing.
    -   Briefly in the first movie, Reed and Sue have a conversation, where Reed admits his fears that Sue may prefer someone who looked more rugged, morphing his face slightly to give himself a Lantern Jaw of Justice. A deleted variant of that scene in the DVD extras shows Reed's face morphing into that of Wolverine as played by Hugh Jackman.
-   In _Hollow Man_, Kevin Bacon's character uses his invisibility power to rape his female neighbor.
-   Pre-referenced in _If Looks Could Kill_, where Scott Corbin is given a pair of X-Ray glasses by a scientist. By the time he puts them on, the scientist has already moved behind a lead shield.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   In _The World Is Not Enough_, when 007 is visiting Zukovsky's casino, he momentarily switches on the infra-red vision in his glasses, revealing all the women in their underwear. Of course, the glasses reveal that they're all _armed_, too, so he _could_ just be checking out the opposition. But then, it's Bond.
    -   In _Live and Let Die_, James Bond uses the electromagnet gadget in his watch to unzip the dress of a woman he's about to sleep with. The woman, thinking he's using his hand, thanks him for having "such a delicate touch."
    -   In _Octopussy_, James Bond uses the sophisticated camera in Q's lab to zoom in on a woman's cleavage. Vijay snickers; Q gets annoyed and orders him to quit fooling around.
-   In the screenplay for George Miller's unmade _Justice League: Mortal_ movie, Barry Allen uses his vibration and intangibility-based abilities during sex with his wife, Iris.
-   In _Last Action Hero_, once learning that the magic ticket works, Nick the projectionist dreams of using it to visit famous leading ladies like Greta Garbo.
-   There are at least three scenes in _Mallrats_ where discussions of this nature take place. Stan Lee finds one fanboy's obsession with superhero genitalia rather distracting, as he's trying to dispense some very useful advice and Jason Lee will not shut up about The Thing's thing.
    
    "He seems to be obsessed with superheroes' private parts."
    
-   In _The Matrix Reloaded_, The Merovingian reprograms a chocolate cake so that when a random woman eats it, she has an orgasm. And though not directly addressed at all, more than a few viewers has wondered about how the virus Agent Smith, at this point able to transform a guy into an also infectious clone of himself by thrusting his fingers into the to-be Smith's chest, would have dealt with all the... chesty women of the Matrix (e.g. the Merovingian's own wife), considering by the next movie almost everyone in the simulation has been Smithsimilated.
-   In _Modern Problems_, Chevy Chase's character uses his telekinetic power to give his girlfriend a screaming orgasm.
-   _My Super Ex-Girlfriend_ features both flying sex and broken beds — neither of which the male lead seems to appreciate as much as he thought he would.
-   _Pretty Cool_ and its sequel both feature a teenage virgin gaining mind control powers. It's worth noting thought that, despite both of them using their powers for various sexual purposes, such as making girls strip off and have orgasms on command, neither of them actually get laid during the films, except in the Unrated Edition of the original, where Howard does have sex in a few dream sequences.
-   _The Pumaman_ ends with Tony flying with Jane and they talk about making love.
    
    **Jane**: I've never seen a couple make love in the air.  
    **Tony**: But that's how you create little Puma Men.  
    **Mike**: Ugh. And he immediately defiles the holy gift given to him.  
    **Crow**: ♫Now... they're going... to boff in the air.♫
    
-   In _Ruby Sparks_, Calvin writes about a girl named Ruby who comes to life as his girlfriend. When Calvin and his brother Harry find out that anything he writes about Ruby comes true, Harry immediately suggests Calvin write that Ruby has bigger boobs, likes blowjobs, etc. Calvin is disgusted and refuses. Calvin eventually resorts to rewriting Ruby to obey him and be sexier in an attempt to stop her from leaving him, which is incredibly disturbing and plays off like a rape scene, as she's moving against her will and clearly terrified. Calvin realizes how low he's sunk and permanently frees Ruby from his control.
-   _Superman: The Movie_: Lois Lane asks Superman about his X-ray vision... only she was standing behind a lead-lined trellis. Later, after she moved, he returns to the prior subject:
    
    **Superman:** Pink!  
    **Lois:** ... What?  
    **Superman:** (_points at her midsection_) They're pink.  
    **Lois:** Aah! (_moves back behind the trellis_)
    
-   In _The Tooth Fairy_, Tracy (one of several tooth fairies) mentions double-dipping into his shrinking paste while off-duty and putting his feet into an inkwell, then walking all over his wife's body and leaving footprints on her while she's asleep — much to her confusion when she wakes up.
-   _Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets_: Bubble is a shapeshifting alien exotic dancer who uses her powers in her cabaret act to play to a whole catalog of PG-13 fetishes, from Nubile Savage to Hospital Hottie to French Maid.
-   Mel Gibson's character in _What Women Want_ uses his mind reading ability to be better at sex. This ends up backfiring when the woman assumes that the only way he could be that in tune with her is if he was gay. That and the fact that he had trouble getting it up at first.
-   In _When Evil Calls_, Michael wishes that he had x-ray vision, which he then uses to spy on the girls' basketball team; seeing them naked. He then discovers that he cannot turn it off, and is forced to see his teacher, his headmaster, and his father naked.
-   _X-Men Film Series_:
    -   _MAD_ played it for laughs in their parody of _X-Men_. When the team was looking for Rogue after she ran away, Xavier was busy using Cerebro to watch women shower.
        
        **Storm:** We got a phone call from the train station.  
        **Xavier:** Okay, but let me make sure she's not in Anna Kournikova's bathroom... just to be safe.
        
    -   _X2: X-Men United_: Mystique shifts into various women to try and seduce Wolverine. It seemed to be working, too... until she shifted into someone he thought of like a daughter.
    -   _X-Men: First Class_:
        -   Raven tries the same trick on Erik, turning from her teenaged form into a more mature woman (Rebecca Romijn in a cameo) in the belief that he'd prefer her that way. Lehnsherr was not impressed because he wanted "the real Raven." It took her two tries to realize that he wanted her natural blue form.
        -   Charles Xavier uses his telepathy to "guess" the drink orders of the women he flirts with. Executive producer Tarquin Pack lampshades this specific example in the rare "Extraordinary Abilities" featurette.
            
            "If I had the ability to read minds, and I was at university, and I could influence people through my mental powers, I would probably also be a bit of a Lothario. _(laughs)_ Who wouldn't be?"
            
        -   Emma Frost seduces a Russian general by projecting a mental image of herself so he thinks she's having sex with him, when in fact she's sitting a distance away looking bored.
        -   In the same scene, Erik has Emma tied to the bed by manipulating the bars. Granted, it was only so Charles could interrogate her.
        -   Mystique jokingly insinuates that Beast's large, ape-like feet might be an indication that he has a massive penis.
    -   _X-Men: Apocalypse_:
        -   Charles and Alex discuss this as they're heading towards Moira's office.
            
            **Alex**: So you really haven't see her in all these years? You never looked her up? Not even in Cerebro?  
            **Charles**: Alex, what do you take me for, some kind of pervert? Yes, I looked her up once, twice. But not in a long time, alright?
            
        -   Quicksilver's flirtation with Moira in Bullet Time is so brief that she doesn't even know it happened! Peter Maximoff also employs his Super-Speed in this commercial and attempts to impress a young woman so that he can earn a date with her.
-   In _X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes_, Xavier's powers cause him to start seeing through clothing during a party. He looks on very appreciatively before his date drags him away.
-   As befitting a James Bond parody, the X-ray binoculars in _xXx_ are immediately put to use peeking at a female lab assistant's underwear. Notably, in a switch from the Bond format, _both_ the 007 and Q expies are excited about the "alternate" uses of said gadget. The 1981 Filipino Bond parody _For Y'ur Height Only_ has the same gag.
-   _Zack Snyder's Justice League_. Barry Allen does a low key version when using his Super-Speed to save a Damsel in Distress (implied to be Iris West) from a car accident; effectively slowing time for a moment so he can appreciate her beauty.
-   In _Zapped! (1982)_ many scenes have Barney using his telekinetic powers to undress women.

    Literature 

-   Mira, in _The Accidental Superheroine_, notes that forming pockets in her malleable body to carry things feels like a completely different sort of orifice, particularly when cellphones placed in there vibrate. Later, she envelops Giancarlo to rescue him and notes that it's an incredibly intimate and erotic experience.
-   _Aeon 14_: Nearly everybody has a Brain/Computer Interface that lets them access the Link (the computer network of wherever they happen to be) and lets them play virtual reality sims in their heads. Naturally, this is used for sexual purposes. In the case of Rika and her Love Interest Chase in the _Rika's Marauders_ series, cybersex is the only way they can do much more than fellatio, because her cyborgization left her without genitalia or sexual organs (she could get them put back, but it would mean removing several of her internal batteries, compromising her combat capabilities).
-   In _Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero_, Akatsuki uses his super speed to steal girl's clothes while they are wearing them, sticks to walls to watch girls shower, and uses energy manipulation and pressure points to make girls orgasm.
-   _Animorphs_:
    -   An attempt and a subversion happen in "The Solution". At one point Rachel enters her bathroom to take a shower, only to hear the thought-speak voice of David, who has used the morphing power to turn into something small and lurk somewhere. He ends his conversation with Rachel with a snide comment that she should "enjoy \[her\] shower", but she decides to skip it for the day.
    -   This is touched upon in "The Pretender", where Rachel teasingly suggests that her boyfriend, Tobias, uses his default hawk form to spy on girls changing. Tobias sputters indignantly for a moment, then recovers with a quip that he never uses his powers for evil.
-   _The Bone Maker_: Zera mentions that some of her customers use her Magic Enhancement talismans for intimate purposes. It's unclear whether she's telling the truth about Super-Speed\-fueled orgies, but she is about one official whose wife likes some Super-Strength in the bedroom.
-   In _Breaking Dawn_, Edward explains that their inability to sleep allows vampires to bang the whole night long; they also become endlessly horny after the change. After a while they learn to restrict themselves. Before that, they can do it for weeks.
-   _Codex Alera_:
    -   Earthcrafters and firecrafters are able to affect the emotions of other people, the former by outright arousing them sexually. The fact that most "entertainers" are well practiced earthcrafters becomes a plot point.
    -   A much darker example with discipline collars, which give the wearer a thrill after they follow an order and make it painful to refuse one. They were originally invented as a means to subdue powerful furycrafters, but the slave industry soon became the collars’ largest market.
    -   Metalcrafters can use their powers to increase their resistance to pain. Watercrafters can appear to be other people, and at least one has actually used their power for sex. Specifically, Invidia Aquitane becomes a slave girl, her own "present" to her husband. He lends her to Fidelias. She doesn't seem to mind. Watercrafters are also proficient at sensing the emotions of others.
-   The Culture is a hedonistic post-scarcity Utopia where nearly omniscient AI Minds take care of its organic citizens' every need... And as such, the Culture's Bio-Augmentation technology isn't needed to make people stronger, smarter or faster - it's used to allow the experience of minutes-long orgasms instead.
-   _Dead Lies Dreaming_: Eve's thoughts that she can use her telekinesis to mastrubate.
-   In the _Deathlands_ series, Krysty Wroth uses her Prehensile Hair to stimulate Ryan Cawdor as foreplay.
-   _Deathstalker_: Inverted with Valentine Wolfe. This young aristocrat is a hedonistic drug addict, said to have tried every drug under the sun and a few that grow only in darkness, every drug known to man and a few he's had designed special just for him. One of these is a drug that makes one's flesh elastic and almost impossible to puncture; it was initially designed to improve sexual congress, but Valentine saw the combat potential in minor Rubber Man power, and has a cache of it (among others) implanted in his body should the necessity of self-defense arise.
-   _Dreamblood Duology_:
    -   Gatherers who become addicted to dreamblood and don't catch that in time can end up gathering someone against their will and becoming a Reaper.
    -   Sharers are meant to use their power for healing, but the potential to use it for the opposite also exists.
-   One of the characters in _Mind Games_ gains a special Class called "Mesmerist." The System Message the System uses to tell them about the Class _explicitly says_ that this is a new Class, unique to humans, and the people creating the System Messages are horrified by its potential. Among other Class Skills available to the class, they obtain one called "Instant Induction," which allows them to put people in a hypnotic trance and give them post-hypnotic suggestions _whether they want to be hypnotized or not_. Since it's _strongly_ implied the whole reason the character likes hypnosis in the _first place_ is because they think it's hot, the Perversion Potential is off the charts.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Deliberately invoked in _Death Masks_ when Harry uses an enchanted rope to tie up Susan after her vampiric hunger begins to overcome her, and then they have sex to calm her down.
        -   Molly earlier suggests he try something similar with Susan, prompting Harry to be a little disturbed at the fact that her mind went there.
    -   Discussed in regards to Lasciel's shadow in both _Dead Beat_ and _White Night_, with Bob mentioning that Lasciel's shadow could have become _anyone_ in Harry's mind and was fully capable of making everything feel as real as if it were actually happening.
    -   In _Cold Days_, it's revealed that Molly's empath abilities show her exactly what her crush is feeling every time he looks at her.
    -   A werewolf couple in the short story "Day Off" use their alternate forms for bestiality, which attracts some kind of magical parasites to them.
    -   At one point it turns out that Harry's brother Thomas became a hairdresser, using his White Court abilities to 'feed' on his customers. It was actually less dangerous to his job-keeping abilities than being more in the open.
-   Luke from _Duumvirate_ has electric eel DNA. Turns out his girlfriend enjoys electrical play.
-   _The Elenium_: One of the villains in the _Tamuli_ is an illusionist who made his income conjuring up better-than-reality illusionary prostitutes for a variety of degenerates — and this is quite a substantial income when you live in a Wretched Hive.
-   _The Fermata_ is entirely about this. A man discovers the ability to stop time... and uses it almost entirely for voyeuristic purposes.
-   As expectable in a series involving a succubus as the protagonist, the _Georgina Kincaid_ series makes a large use of this trope at several points, though the "potential" has a _very_ annoying side effect: since Succubi and Incubi feeds on their partners' life forces during the act, Georgina is unable to have sex with her Love Interest Seth Mortensen without causing him to lose part of his lifespan at best, and killing him at worst. She still has straight uses however, including sleeping with an Incubus friend in Seth's form (though she regretted this one later), or using her shapeshifting to cause her panties to disappear.
-   Bug from _Gone_, who can turn invisible, hides in Diana's room while she's getting changed. The other characters seem aware of this habit, though; Diana chases him out after she hears him, Penny tortures him with her own powers the one time he tried, and Caine makes some death threats before having sex with Diana to make sure, if Bug's in the room, he evacuates.
-   The Guardians can fly, breathe underwater, teleport to exotic locations and shapeshift. And they do.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   "Mad-Eye" Moody's false eye can see through clothes. There's no evidence that he himself abuses this ability. His impostor, however, in _Goblet of Fire_ is _hinted_ at doing so. As he talks to Harry, Harry notices the eye following a pair of female students down the hall.
    -   In _Goblet of Fire_, Moaning Myrtle surprises Harry by popping out of the water while he's bathing in the (male) Prefects' bathroom. When Harry asks her if she spends her free time doing this (i.e. spying on the male students while they bathe); she replies "Sometimes," with a mischievous grin.
    -   Somewhat deconstructed in _Half-Blood Prince_, where in the backstory Merope Gaunt used a Love Potion or some other magical enchantment to force a rich Muggle she fancied to be with her and getting pregnant from him, essentially date-raping him. This was how Lord Voldemort was conceived, and it's implied to be one of the contributing factors to his psychopathy and inability to understand love.
    -   This trope is also the reason why Animagi have to register themselves at the Ministry, with the punishment for failing to register being imprisonment in Azkaban.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Trilogy_:
    -   In _So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish_, Arthur Dent and his lover Fenchurch have sex while flying. Twice. With a Sony Walkman, too. They were listening to Dire Straits.
    -   The Infinite Improbability Drive allows instantaneous travel to anywhere in the universe. The most popular use of the _finite_ improbability generator? To "break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left".
-   _Hopscotch_ by Kevin J. Anderson (he of the _Junior Jedi Knights_ series) is set in a world where the ability to swap bodies with other people is almost universal. Anderson's explicit about the ways this can be abused. In one section, he's very explicit.
-   _How to Be a Superhero_ has lots of jokes about why having stretching powers will make you very popular with the ladies.
-   In Sheri S. Tepper's _Jinnian_ trilogy in the True Game books, the narratrix quietly appreciates the pleasures of having a Shifter for a lover, and misses his powers when they're gone.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: After a villain collars her with a supernatural device that makes her unable to refuse orders, Annala asks Eric if he's turning into one of those "abusive and controlling boyfriends". He emphatically says "no" and makes sure it cannot happen by ordering her to refuse his orders.
-   The _Known Space_ novel _A Gift from Earth_ involves a telepathic ability called "Plateau eyes". Throughout the novel, the hero uses it (usually subconsciously, when stressed) to contract eye pupils of people looking at him, making himself invisible and forcing them to forget of him. When the ability is discovered, there's a suggestion that the opposite — dilating pupils — will attract attention and may make people fall in love. Near the end the hero tries that on the primary antagonist — in a non-sexual way. This results in a sort of crazy religious fixation. In the last scene, the hero realizes he's still a virgin because he always panicked and subconsciously caused girls to overlook him. He realizes that he can use his powers in... other ways now.
-   _Legends of Laconia_: Either inverted or played straight, depending on your attitudes, in _Halloween Romance_. Selene asks her boyfriend Ferdinand if his body works the same in sexual situations now that he's a vampire. He replies that it does, since his blood (very slowly) flows, but "everything takes longer."
-   Stanisław Lem loved to find perverted uses for new technologies, especially in humorous stories about Ijon Tichy and quasi-medieval robots. Usually this wasn't the focus of the story, but rather an amusing detail.
    -   In _Memoirs of a Space Traveller V (The Washing Machine Tragedy)_, competition between two large washing-machine manufacturers, their Sex Sells ad campaigns, and feature creep resulted in humanoid robotic laundresses, who quickly started providing _other_ services to their owners of any gender. As well as seducing their children.
    -   In _Peace on Earth_, the first use for remote-controlled dolls — "empties" or "remotes" — was sex. Among the major buyers were old prostitutes — no longer good-looking, but _very_ experienced. The legal implications are mentioned: what constitutes infidelity, incest, homosexuality (where still illegal), sadism, pedophilia, etc. where "remotes" are involved. Sex robots with real AI failed on the market, because they were expensive and unpleasantly smart for their users.
    -   In _The Repetition_, one paragraph lists the troubles caused by the possibility of Time Travel. There's a list of "chronoperversions: futurophilia, time fetishism, delectatio temporosa \["being delighted by time"\], autopedophilia, i.e. aged perverts stalking themselves in childhood, and chronanism".
    -   In _Education of Cyfranius_, the second Nested Story outlines the history of a planet where technological progress left the population idle making fornication their favorite activity. This lead to creation of many industries, professions and devices. Most are mentioned only by Punny Names and their exact meaning is left for readers to deduce. Among the ones somewhat elaborated upon are such things as trimaturgy — dramatizing family life by building Love Triangles; bodymaster — a (rich) person controlling multiple gengineered bodies; spiritstove — a device to torture to death a recorded consciousness of a living or fictional person; exterrier — a former dog; piter — a person erased from global information network by mistake and hiding from civilization in a pit (people enjoying sex with anonymous piters employed packs of trained exterriers to search for them).
-   In _The Locked Tomb_, Gideon at least is convinced necromancers use their powers for this kind of thing and given the framing of a scene in which Harrow regrows a character's arm bones is likely not wholly wrong.
    
    **Gideon:** Don't look at her blood, or lick her bones, or do any of the shit necromancers lie and say they don't do the moment two of them get nasty.
    
-   In Randall Garrett's _Lord Darcy_ books any building where people live or work or conduct business has powerful privacy spells put on it, renewed regularly (there are wizards who specialize in this sort of thing), just to prevent this sort of thing.
-   Vampires in _Necroscope_ demonstrate that while going One-Winged Angel may look unpleasant, a writhing mass of holes and parts can give exquisite sensations to its sexual partners. Of course, since this is a horror series...
-   _Night Chills_ by Dean Koontz involves a small town being used as a testbed for a Mind-Control Conspiracy. The Mad Scientist who developed the mind control has serious issues with women, so he physically and sexually abuses various women in the town, which leads to the protagonists discovering the conspiracy when his acts draw attention.
-   _The Night's Dawn Trilogy_: Al Capone says that he can do "amazing things with his wang", as the Possessed can physically alter the bodies they've taken over. Unfortunately this damages the body in the long term — one woman who was given bigger breasts by her former Possessor is revealed to have a chest covered in cancerous growths.
-   _Old Man's War_ has retired septuagenarians recruited into the military, shipped far from home and anyone they knew, and given new bodies complete with peak physical fitness and enhanced senses. Naturally, the first thing they do is have lots of sex.
-   In Mur Lafferty's novel _Playing for Keeps_, one of the Heroes has the power to make his tattoos come to life. Most of them are animals, but two are a nude woman and a nude man...
-   In _Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain_, ex-supervillain the Minx has the superpower to cloud men's minds with lust. She used this to sleep with most superheroes and supervillains running around at the time, meaning nobody knows the identity of her daughter Claire's (the main character's best friend) father. Neither seems to care.
    -   Claire is also disappointed that her powers (she has cuteness instead of lust) don't work that way ("my powers make men want to pinch the wrong cheeks!"), but expresses interest in following in her mother's footsteps, in both villainy and sex life.
-   In _Prophecy_, by Elizabeth Haydon, the title character (for the previous book), Rhapsody, takes a bath. Her lover has the elemental ties to water and takes the opportunity to put them to good use. Once she realizes what's going on, she decides she'd be more comfortable if he was actually in the water with her. She then discovers that he doesn't need to breathe underwater.
-   _Rhythm of War_ (fourth book of _The Stormlight Archive_): One of Shallan's new Lightweavers was a prostitute who was using her illusions to appear as whoever her clients found most appealing. Shallan also considered using a lesser form of this earlier while courting Adolin, increasing her bust size or clearing up her freckles, but dismisses it as impractical for a long-term relationship.
-   In Julian May's _Saga of the Exiles_ and the prequel/sequels (I hate time travel...) _Intervention_ and the _Galactic Milieu_ trilogy, the recreational aspects of metapsychic life are addressed — indeed, one of the characters in the latter series writes a book about sexual behavior in metapsychics (prompting a comment from the narrator that he wasn't mentioned as the pioneer of doing it in the air).
-   _Skulduggery Pleasant_: Saracen Rue keeps the exact nature of his magical discipline a secret to hide the fact that he is a Lynceus, someone with the ability to see through solid objects. Since it's not a very versatile ability in a setting where the average sorcerer only gets one magical specialty, the common assumption is that anyone who chooses to become a Lynceus just wants to be able to look through people's clothes. And Saracen is ashamed because that's exactly the reason why he picked the power as a teenager, only to discover that seeing through clothes means that the clothes squash body parts together and make everything look decidedly unsexy.
-   In the novel _Some Other Place, The Right Place_, Diana uses her ability to hypnotize Day for some... somewhat unethical methods. Once accidentally, and once deliberately when he refused to give her oral, so she hypnotizes him and _makes him do it_, which he doesn't realize she did until afterwards.
-   Naturally comes up in _Super Powereds_, given that we're talking about college students (i.e. horny teenagers) with super powers. Hershel's Super-Powered Alter Ego Roy is a big hunk with a Southern accent, who likes dressing up like a Texan. Naturally, he finds no shortage of female admirers in bars and clubs. Sasha's roommate Julia, who hooks up with Roy, is revealed to have the power of Self-Duplication, which, when coupled with Roy's enhanced endurance, results in many hours of loud fun. While Roy is normally a one night stand kind of guy, this combination means he frequently hooks up with the girl. Nick calls Julia a "walking gangbang". On a less perverted note, Hershel himself, when going to a party as himself for the first time, manages to appear sociable thanks to Roy's experience and his own skills at LARPing. Surprisingly, Alex, a nerd with Psychic Powers, who keeps insisting that he's a Jedi, reveals that he used to get a lot of tail in high school without even trying, thanks to the girls of his small town knowing about his abilities. In college, though, surrounded by dozens of other Supers, he's just a nerd.
-   _Sword of Truth_: In _Stone of Tears_ it's shown sorceresses and wizards can get each other aroused with magic, or it's implied enhance the experience while having sex. Jedediah uses his magic to arouse a sorceress this way, and also before he has sex with her (off page) one does the same for him as well.
-   Jack Fleming from _The Vampire Files_ admits that one of the lesser-known temptations of vampirism is the risk of becoming a compulsive voyeur, what with having so many long nights to fill and the power to invade peoples' privacy via Super Smoke. Also, in _The Dark Sleep_, he and Bobbi make out when he's standing in front of her dressing room mirror, and notice that his lack of a reflection makes for an... interesting... display when she wraps her legs around him.
-   Tanith Lee's _Vivia_ includes a scene which seems to be the author's own take on how a vampire's power to turn into mist can be erotic. He turns into mist, flows around the female protagonist and then materializes only his mouth, in about twenty different locations at the same time... Ian Watson discussed the same thing in a short story about a human who married a djinn.
-   _Vorkosigan Saga_: In _Captain Vorpatril's Alliance_, Ivan mentions finding out that Simon Illyan's eidetic memory chip was once the repository of the largest and strangest porn collection on Barrayar.
-   Pretty common in the _Whateley Universe_, which is hardly surprising given that Whateley Academy has over six hundred horny teenagers with superpowers. One of the characters even writes a sex manual, "Sara's Little Purple Book" (NSFW), to give advice on how to use one's powers sexually while avoiding injury.
    -   One of the early examples was Chaka using her power over Ki to give her girlfriend Riptide a massage that left her pretty much a cooing puddle. "Sara's Little Purple Book" includes a Call-Back on this, stating that it is a crime for a ki master, psychic, or biomanipulator to deliberately get a partner addicted to empowered massages and the like.
    -   Tansy Walcutt uses her telepathy during sex to give her partners an amazing time. And so she can plant psychic hooks in their minds to control them later.
    -   Ayla uses his intangibility powers to take off girls' underwear through their clothes, during fights. He actually has to practice the technique with mannequins before he does it for real so he doesn't Tele-Frag someone in half.
    -   A straightforward in-universe example is Peeper, who uses his X-ray vision exactly the way you'd expect a lecherous outright jerk of a teenager to. (It turns out that he can't turn it off, but his attitude appears to predate his power; in one story, upon being given a computer monitor he can actually _use_ because he doesn't see straight through it his very first thought is that he can finally browse the internet for porn again.)
    -   Oak (who resembles an oak tree — think of something like the Ents from _The Lord of the Rings_) has boasted of pollinating in public.
    -   When debating with Jobe whether men or women enjoy sex more, Sizzle claims that several male telepaths she knows insist on "riding along" with their female partners during sex because of (supposedly) how much better they like the female experience, and even get upset if their partner won't let them.
    -   This is by no means limited to students, however. For example, it is not clear if Captain Courage — better known as "Captain Condom", for his apparent failure to use them — owes his success with women to a super-power or not. What isn't in question is huge amount of child support he now owes to many of those women. Needless to say, the school makes a point of treating this as an object lesson for graduating students.
    -   In "The Final Trump", the Harrow family go to a resort and spa which caters to supervillains. This resort has an onsen which is famous as being a hook-up point. It is later learned that the "water treatment system" used by the spa was actually a Vril Synthesizer, and that a side effect of the Power-Up it gave was a certain increase in libido. Since it was also the MacGuffin of their opponents' Fetch Quest, they steal it with the intent of luring said rivals out into the open, but it's speculated by J.J. that his parents may have taken advantage of it for some personal time, as well.
    -   As par for the series, there are Blessed with Suck forms of this as well.
        -   Quite a few students — and at least one teacher — Can't Have Sex, Ever due to their powers.
        -   Some Animal Themed Superbeings (e.g., Avatars bonded with animal spirits) will experience a form of their spirit animal's mating season, especially if the bond is mismatched. While the school has a protocol to handle this that is supposed to be arranged ahead of time, it isn't always successful in preventing problems, as was nearly the case for Aquerna. In particular, lagomorphs such as Inaba, Iron Bunny, or Lapin seem to fit the Animal Stereotypes for rabbits in this regard, to the extent that it requires special medical treatment to help them control it.
-   In one of _The Witcher_ novels when Geralt reminisce his stormy romance with Yennefer, fond memories include her levitation spells. And in another certain wizard's tower is filled with illusions like flowering orchard or naked servant girl. Geralt himself has been known to use the fact that his witcher mutations make him sterile as an incentive for women to sleep with him.
    -   Two of the effects of witcher mutations are immunity to most diseases and sterility. Geralt and his colleagues take ample advantage of being able to have risk-free no-strings-attached sex in a setting where that normally wouldn't be possible.
-   Rick Cook's _Wizardry Compiled_ inverts this. The heroes desperately need something to slow the flow of time to finish their programming project as soon as possible. Fortunately, a spell is known that doubles the length of a night in the affected room. Some great ancient wizard invented it for his wedding night (but lacked physical strength to perform that long, as he found out). Programmers work night shifts about 24 hours long and rest about 12 hours during the day, which allows them to meet the deadline.
    -   Played straight on a smaller scale in the same novel. One programmer with No Social Skills uses the ability to program demons to creature a "user friendly" interface which consists of an equally nubile and nude demoness that follows all of the user's commands. A Straw Feminist colleague immediately calls him out on it and heads to their supervisor to demand that he's made to change such perverted code. The supervisor, himself busy meeting the employers, initially doesn't even understand how code could be perverted. But then he exasperatedly orders the code changed, over the author's protests that he's willing to make a male version, too. The scene ends with another colleague pulling the man aside to ask for the code for himself for later...
-   In Kelley Armstrong's series _Women of the Otherworld_, the women's species and/or abilities often play into their sex lives. Particularly _Dime Store Magic_, in which a witch seduces a sorcerer by using spells to turn on the radio, light candles, caress him with wind, and most notably, use a modified fireball spell that apparently made her warm fingers particularly stimulating. _Personal Demon_ shows us a chaos half-demon who gets a high off chaotic emotions and adrenaline. Her lover arouses her by deliberating calling up memories of risky or chaotic situations and letting her feel his adrenaline rush. In _Stolen_, the love lives of werewolves are speculated on, but the question remains unanswered.
-   _Worm_:
    -   Heartbreaker using his power (ability to instill extreme emotions in a target) to form a harem is somewhat infamous in the story itself.
    -   Imp also uses her power for peeping. Or to get out unnoticed when accidentally walking in on her brother and Taylor's intimate moments.
    -   The villain Bambina describes how she wants the body-snatcher Pretender to owe her a favor so she can have him possess a celebrity and do all sorts of un-broadcastable things with her. The full speech is treated as Brain Bleach in universe.
    -   Regent has abused his People Puppets power in the past to form a sort of narcissistic one-person orgy.
    -   Coil has a penchant for torture and a Time Master power that lets him erase the consequences. You can bet he indulges.
    -   Averted for Tattletale, whose Hyper-Awareness is a bit too distracting to enjoy anything physical.
-   _Xanth_:
    -   In _A Spell for Chameleon_, the hero encounters a sorceress who is a master of illusion magic. She attempts to seduce the hero by making herself appear as a beautiful and buxom young woman (when in reality she is far less attractive).
    -   A later book had a random character named Feelup with the power to touch at a distance. Three guesses what he was witnessed using his power to do and the first two don't count.

    Live-Action TV 

-   One of the recurring villains in Season 2 of _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ is Carl Creel ("Absorbing Man" in the comics), a former boxer who can absorb the properties of any material he touches. When he tries to get in touch with Team Coulson they briefly joke about his personal life:
    
    **Coulson:** Someone sent a message.  
    **Skye:** A message for us with a phone number to call.  
    **May:** Yeah, could be Creel.  
    **Triplett:** Creel? A phone number? What, is he lonely?  
    **Skye:** I doubt it. The guy is jacked. And he can turn any body part into any material...  
    **Coulson:** Okay. Thank you for that.
    
-   _Alphas_:
    -   Subverted with Rachel's Super-Senses, which make her much more sensitive to stimuli of all sorts, which means that she can orgasm just from being kissed; the subversion is that this contributes to her OCD, such that she cannot bear to be touched, especially not in a sexual way, even just to be kissed. She eventually gets over this after finding a (metaphorically) sensitive boyfriend, with the implication being that her problems were largely down to not trusting any other person enough to allow herself to become so completely vulnerable around them.
    -   Played straight with Danielle Rosen, who uses her ability to manipulate feelings by touch to enhance sex.
    -   Nina has used her mind-control ability to lure her childhood sweetheart away from his wife, and kept using it on him to force him to stay with her for quite some time. It is also implied that Cameron and Nina broke up because she used her ability on him in a way that made him very uncomfortable.
-   _Altered Carbon_: The potentially perverse uses of Brain Uploading are touched upon in different ways:
    -   The wealthy pay less fortunate people to perform Gladiator Games or submit to being raped to death with the promise of having their mind placed into a better body afterwards. This sets off the plot, as the prostitutes had been given special religious coding without their knowledge or consent. This coding makes it illegal to resleeve them or even spin them up in virtual reality, making it impossible to ask them what happened.
    -   One of the main characters infiltrates a hedonist resort, but is very disturbed when a prostitute suggests that he torture her to death. The slimy manager then tries offering him a _child sleeve_ instead.
    -   As a Sex for Services bribe, a woman offers to upload her personality into several identical sleeves and have sex with the protagonist and each other. He later takes her up on this offer. "Multisleeving," it should be noted, is explicitly illegal, though probably less so than all the rape/murder stuff.
    -   One character enjoys having a sexual tryst with one of her bodyguards... while she's wearing a sleeve of _her mother_. The daughter claims her mom equips her sleeves with all sorts of sex enhancements, but she also might have just stolen it for the thrill.
-   _Angel_:
    -   Referred to in "I Fall to Pieces", when dealing with a man who can detach any part of his body and let it wander around independently. He stalks a woman, eventually sending his hands into her house to crawl around under her bed covers. As Doyle notes, "At least it was just his hands down there... Wish I hadn't even thought that."
    -   Angel runs into a demon prostitute who feels him up with her tail. "Look ma, no hands!"
    -   The physics genius who discovered the means to arrest time in a specific area, and tried to use it to freeze himself and his girlfriend at the peak of an everlasting orgasm (he knew she was planning to break up with him that night after pity sex).
    -   Even our hero does it. While in his evil Angelus persona, he mentions using his Super-Hearing to listen in on Fred and Gunn having sex and masturbating to it. Given that it was Angelus speaking, this may or may not be true.
-   _Arrowverse_:
    -   _Black Lightning (2018)_: Jefferson can directly stimulate someone's nervous system with low-level electrical discharges, which he uses when making out and later having sex with his ex-wife. Based on her reaction, it's highly pleasurable.
    -   _The Flash (2014)_ has Barry Allen accidentally vibrating at Super-Speed while making out with his girlfriend Linda. Barry apologizes, but Linda claims that she found whatever he just did extremely pleasurable. Another episode has Hannibal Bates, a shapeshifter, disguising as Barry and kissing Caitlin Snow out of attraction.
    -   In _Invasion! (2016)_, Supergirl meets the Flash/Arrow/Legends teams. When Mick finds out she has X-Ray Vision, he immediately assumes she's looking at everybody's "bits". Kara insists she would never do that, but in the _Elseworlds (2018)_ event, Supergirl uses her x-ray vision to see who Batwoman is under her mask. She comments Batwoman has a _lot_ of tattoos, meaning she saw her naked.
    -   _Legends of Tomorrow_: If what we hear in "Here I Go Again" is any indication, Amaya and Nate use their animal totem and steel powers respectively during sex. _How_ isn't clear.
-   In _Babylon 5_, G'Kar gets a prosthetic eye that relays images into his brain even when removed from the socket. He leaves it on a shelf in Sheridan's quarters just before Sheridan and Delenn have their wedding night. Then again, by Minbari tradition, a wedding night is supposed to have witnesses to the consummation.
-   An episode of _The Big Bang Theory_ has someone bring up whether or not Mrs. Incredible needs to use birth control, as she could potentially use her powers to simulate a diaphragm. They decide that this is proof that they have run out of things to discuss.
-   When one episode of _Bottom_ had Richie and Eddie about to plummet to their deaths from a broken Ferris wheel, Eddie decides to convert to Buddhism so that he can reincarnate as a supermodel and ogle himself. Richie agrees, hoping to become a strip dancer in a room full of mirrors. After that, they both agree to reincarnate as giraffes so that they'll be able to see any supermodels taking topless helicopter lessons.
-   _The Boys (2019)_:
    -   Homelander spies on Stillwell with his X-Ray Vision while she's using breast pumps.
    -   It crops up quite frequently, with Transluscent using his powers to spy on others, Doppelganger using their powers to seduce others and acquire blackmail material, the supe sex club that Butcher and Hughie visit<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and the annual "Herogasm", a super-sex party hosted by a pair of washed-up '70s supes where it's strongly implied that non-supe sex workers are horrendously abused as the supes use their power for sexual purposes. Among other things, we see one supe with ice powers creating an icicle dildo. Lampshaded by Popclaw, who notes that many people have a "Supe Fetish".
    -   Termite is a supe with the ability to shrink himself. We see him primarily uses his power for sexual reasons, such as a cameo in Season 1 where he dives into a woman's vagina and humping a Barbie doll in Season 3. Later on, he attempts to pleasure a male partner by shrinking himself to go inside his penis through the urethra. However, this horrifically backfires when he accidentally kills his partner by sneezing and going back to his normal size _while inside of his penis_.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In one episode, Buffy gets turned invisible. She decides to get into all sorts of mischief, including having sex with Spike. When Xander walks in, Spike says he's just doing pushups naked in bed, and demonstrates with a few more... pushups.
    -   Willow and Tara are shown at least once to use their magic powers while having sex. ("You make me come—plete!") They are on screen levitating a lot, including that one.
    -   Faith bragging to Spike about what she can do with her Slayer muscles. Both Spike and Parker comment favorably on Buffy's stamina in the bedroom, so she's not lying.
    -   A rather dark example occurs when Faith uses a device given to her by Mayor Wilkins to swap bodies with Buffy, and uses it to her advantage to sleep with Riley.
    -   The Evil Nerd Trio are seen trying to use their inventions for various perverted purposes, like an invisibility gun to help them spy on a bikini wax and a mind-control device to pick up chicks. The latter is deconstructed when the girl wakes up early and angrily tells them what they're doing is rape. Johnathan and Andrew are appropriately horrified at the realization — Warren, not so much.
-   _Charmed (1998)_:
    -   Piper Halliwell, who has the special power to stop motion, once mentions that she "freezes" her date when they are... so she can... In another episode Leo calls her out on doing this but in a way that suggests he doesn't actually object to it.
        
        **Leo:** You want to freeze me in bed for your own personal pleasure? That's fine.
        
    -   Phoebe eventually gains empathic powers which cause this to happen unintentionally. She has trouble being around her boyfriend since the combined emotions of herself and him make her think about nothing but sex. It got even worse when she ended up in a room with a guy who was checking out her sister and realized that she was starting to think about how good her sister's butt looked in that dress. Another incident has her feeling a mailman's attraction to her and kissing him, later noting "we're lucky he didn't sue for sexual harassment".
    -   The first-season villain Rex uses his Astral Projection power to spy on Prue changing her clothes. Then, he plants a subliminal message in his lover Hannah to make her take off her dress.
    -   Kieran demons have the ability to shapeshift. Apparently most of them use this ability to work as strippers and transform into whoever the client requests. Cole hires one to pose as Phoebe after their divorce.
    -   Paige at one point admits to sometimes orbing out in the middle of sex due to nerves. She also rather shamelessly threatens Groin Attack to two men, which both Piper and Leo call her on.
    -   When Phoebe is turned into a genie, Chris wants to use one of his three wishes to get Piper and Leo to have sex so that he can be conceived (he's their Kid from the Future). Phoebe is repulsed by this and when she's forced to grant the wish, she employs Loophole Abuse - Chris wished for them to "sleep together" so Phoebe has them fall asleep next to each other.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_: Matt Murdock isn't above using his blindness to get the sympathy of attractive women. His friend Foggy Nelson is confused over how Matt knows the women are attractive; apparently, his Super-Senses give him a pretty good idea.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   In the parody mini-episode "The Curse of Fatal Death", the Doctor regenerates into a woman. She is eager to use some of the sonic screwdriver's "other" settings. The sonic screwdriver has gotten subject to similar innuendo in other New Series stories.
    -   At least a couple of characters, upon learning that the Doctor has two hearts, have asked if he has two of anything else.
    -   In "Journey's End", a clone of the Doctor appears and Donna gets a copy of his mind, meaning that there are now three Doctors running around.
    -   In the minisodes "Time" and "Space", there are two Amy Ponds, who flirt with themselves, something which Rory has "absolutely no problem at all" with. In "First Night" and "Last Night", two different versions of River Song see two Doctors. Both comment, "Two of you? The mind races!"
    -   River Song mentions that she once dated an Auton duplicate. It had swappable heads, which "kept things interesting".
    -   The dastardly Lady Cassandra makes full use of her possession ability in "New Earth" when she takes over both Rose and the Doctor. "Oh, baby!" she coos, as she fondles Rose's body in the mirror, "It's like living inside a bouncy castle!" Moments later, she's got her jacket off and her cleavage out, sneaking perfume down her top, and surprising the Doctor with a huge snog. The Doctor's body is also a source of glee: "So many parts! And hardly used...!"
    -   In "The Girl in the Fireplace", the Doctor reads the mind of historical courtesan Madame de Pompadour, and his dialog makes it rather clear that he's stumbling across some rather kinky memories. She seems to like it.
    -   After the Silurian Vastra mentions how mammals all look the same to her in front of her human wife, she asks, "Was I being insensitive again, dear? I don't know why you put up with me." She then uses her long, prehensile tongue to knock an enemy soldier unconscious from across the room, and the two share a sultry look. Moffat, you do remember you're not writing _Torchwood_, right?
    -   In "Dark Water", one character jokes about filling a swimming pool with the titular substance, which makes anything but organic matter invisible when submerged. The Doctor is genuinely confused as to why.
    -   In "The Return of Doctor Mysterio", Grant Gordon raises the difficulties of having X-Ray Vision when you're a Hormone-Addled Teenager. "I'm in Hell. Naked Hell!"
-   This is basically the whole premise of _Dollhouse_, with "Actives" artificially given memories, personality traits and skills through imprinting technology. There are some clients that want something like an assassin, a hostage negotiator, a bodyguard, a midwife, or what-have-you, but the vast majority of their income is from romantic engagements — in other words, providing pre-programmed Sex Slaves who embody the client's idea of the perfect partner/date/encounter. Beyond what most of the Actives are used for, there's their very existence. You have a technology capable of revolutionizing everything from education to the treatment of psychiatric illnesses, and yet the only time these ideas are even touched upon is in their use as a recruiting tool for potential Actives (most of whom have some trauma before signing their five-year contract; when their time is up, the Dollhouse will restore their original personality _sans_ the melancholy, PTSD, schizophrenia, etc.). However, the company behind the Dollhouse, the Rossum Corporation, apparently never intended the Dollhouse to be its only use, and starts using it for things like advancing immortality through Grand Theft Me and producing Super Soldiers with a Hive Mind.
-   In an episode of _Extras_, Ricky Gervais is talking with Patrick Stewart. Stewart is complaining that he's tired of playing Professor X and wants to focus on his own original character: a psychic who can make womens' clothes fall off.
    
    **Stewart:** Oh, they try to cover up, but I've already seen everything.
    
-   In _Firefly_, River has used her empathic powers to... spy on people, sometimes deliberately, and sometimes inadvertently. And in _Serenity_ she uses her flexibility and stealth to watch her own brother Simon and Kaylee get it on.
-   One of the troubled cases on _Fringe_ is a projective empath: he makes people around him feel what he feels. His first appearance is as a paranoid, depressive (leading to several "suicides", and at least one homicide, thanks to his Power Incontinence). By the next time we see him, he has control of his powers, a much healthier psyche, and a girlfriend. A throwaway line from his girlfriend (while the couple are in bed) suggests that he is not limited to projecting emotional states, but also sense-data. While they are trying to track him down, Walter links Olivia's mind with his. While he goes to a strip club, and projects his lust onto a stripper, who kisses him, Olivia takes his place in the audience's view.
-   _Gen V_:
    -   In the pilot Emma shrinks herself to a minuscule size at her partner's request to slide up and down his penis, as he has a fetish for this.
    -   In "Welcome to the Monster Club" Maverick casually admits to using his invisibility power to spy on both women and men in the showers. He also enjoys being led around in a dog leash by his girlfriend, who just happens to have taken the shape of an alpaca (or _is_ an actual alpaca).
    -   On a less amusing note, Rufus uses his power to induce Laser-Guided Amnesia in an attempt to rape Marie.
-   In one episode of _The Greatest American Hero_, Ralph temporarily gains mind control powers, which he uses on his wife Pam. This being '80s American network television, it was just some window-washing and sandwich-making.
-   _Heroes_:
    -   In an early episode, Matt uses his telepathy to improve his and his wife's sex life.
    -   Near the beginning of the second season, Candice (while taking care of the recovering Sylar) tries to tempt his cooperation with various sexual fetishes — a geisha, twin blonde cheerleaders, and finally, Sylar himself. Unfortunately for her, sex is not Sylar's number one craving...
-   An episode of _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_ involved Wayne's family rescuing him from kidnappers, using superpowers they'd received based on a chameleon. Amy the daughter was invisible due to permanent camouflage, Nick the son had mutated hands and feet that allowed him to climb walls, and Diane... Diane had a long tongue. A _really_ long tongue. The Power Perversion Potential was explicitly stated when, after rescue, Wayne promises his family to immediately reverse their changes but Diane, when the others leave, smiles and says she can wait a bit, and then gives him a kiss that has him wide-eyed.
-   Shown several times in _The Invisible Man_. Surprisingly, Darien, being a thief, rarely uses his new ability to steal, except when specifically assigned to do so. He does this in the series finale, only to leave the stolen money on the sidewalk after having a realization that he doesn't want to go back to his old life anymore. In the pilot, he tries to spy on a soldier and a nurse getting it on. Unfortunately for him (and the audience), his ability is controlled by adrenaline, resulting in him inadvertently becoming visible. The soldier is not amused. After getting his black eye taken care of, he learns some yogic techniques which not only give him complete control over his ability but also allow him to cover only parts of his body with "quicksilver" as well as coat other objects with the substance. He later sneaks into the house of his Keeper but stops short of seeing her in the shower (especially since water would make him visible). A character asks him later if he has ever sneaked into the girls' locker room while invisible.
-   _Jessica Jones (2015)_ has Kilgrave with his Mind Control. Sex is just one of the things that he uses this power for, and it's presented as especially monstrous, especially since getting "Kilgraved" at all is analogous to being raped but he frequently goes even further and adds physical rape through this mental coercion. And the title character was just one of his many victims.
-   _Legion (2017)_: Syd has the power to "Freaky Friday" Flip with anyone she touches, and as a young teenager she once used this to swap with her mom and have sex with her mom's boyfriend, which got him arrested for seemingly assaulting a minor when she reverted to her own form in the act.
-   _Lois & Clark_:
    -   Lois and Clark on the ceiling. Also, the early episodes had few moments where Clark is given the opportunity to use his X-Ray Vision in a less than honorable way and _just_ barely resists the urge to do so. After they get engaged, Lois temporarily gets powers and does the same thing (via "guessing" whether Clark is wearing boxers or briefs). After they get married all the call for restraint is pretty much gone: there's even a bit where Clark flirts by commenting on it.
    -   There's also an episode where a regular Joe is granted Superman's powers. When he tracks the guy down, he finds him sitting on a building using his X-ray vision to look through the building across the way... and into a women's locker room. Superman is not amused.
-   _Lost Girl_: A running theme of the series. The central character is Bo, a succubus who needs to feed upon sexual energy (a process pleasurable for both parties) with the power to temporarily Charm Person others. Recurring/main character Vex has the ability to make People Puppets and, unlike Bo, has no moral compass to restrain its use. That is just the main characters. With a succubus as a heroine, most other powers encountered are viewed through a lascivious gaze, if not outright used as such.
-   In _The Magicians (2016)_, Kady and Penny use their magic to levitate so that they can have sex in mid-air. Quentin and Alice's first time is after turning into foxes in Antarctica, which is why he nicknames her "Vix".
-   In _The Ministry of Time_ episode "Time of Magic", real-life psychic Joaquín Argamasilla appears as a man with X-Ray Vision working for the 1924 Ministry. He makes it clear that he can see through people's clothes and does so constantly, even men. At the end of the episode, the heroes try to recruit him to work for the present-day Ministry. He accepts... after checking out Irene through her clothes (she doesn't seem to mind).
-   _Misfits_:
    -   Alisha's power is to make men ravenously lustful for her.
    -   Curtis and his girlfriend discuss using his time jump power at just the right time...
-   _The Power (2023)_:
    -   Some young women soon discover use of the power in mildly stimulating the vagina can cause them to have sexual pleasure.
    -   Later we learn it can also enhance orgasm if a woman slightly uses this while having sex with a man (or, presumably, a woman).
-   _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_:
    -   Whenever a witch wants something really bad and says it three times, she makes it happen. The aunts call it a Randy Travis spell, because they frequently use it conjure up country singer Randy Travis. The Stinger of the episode has Sabrina first conjuring up Eddie Cibrian and it cuts away just as she starts chanting "Brad Pitt, Brad Pitt, Brad Pitt" (although the novelization then says "some things even witches couldn't do").
    -   Sabrina turns a magician friend invisible and wonders where a teenage boy with invisibility would go. Gilligan Cut to the girls' locker room.
    -   One episode has Zelda creating a helmet that allows the wearer to have X-ray vision. Hilda naturally uses this to spy under the mailman's clothes.
    -   An accidental example, but Sabrina ends up trapped in Libby's brain and in trying to make her sneeze, she makes her start kissing the vice principal on the cheek.
-   _Salem_: Tituba suspects Mary's decision to invade John Alden's dreams to be this, since she repeatedly used them to have dream-sex with him. Although she loses control at one point and gets briefly trapped in a nightmare, she succeeds not only at extracting the information she needed from John, but as a side effect, it makes him lust after every woman he passes by.
-   _Sense8_: The series acknowledges the likelihood of kinkiness coming up when eight attractive non-asexual adults develop a Psychic Link with each other. Psychic orgies crop up no less than three times in the series, one with just four members, one with all eight, and the finale which involves all eight _and_ all their lovers.
-   _Smallville_:
    -   When Clark's X-Ray Vision first begins to develop, one of the first things he sees is the girls changing in the locker room. His reaction goes from confused to happy very quickly.
        -   Less accidental when, under the influence of red kryptonite, he purposefully sees through Chloe and Lana's clothes.
            
            **Clark:** Did you know that Chloe has a birthmark on her cheek?  
            **Pete:** No, she doesn't.  
            **Clark:** Not that cheek.  
            **Pete:** Are you doing what I think you are doing? _\[Clark gazes at Chloe with a dreamy expression\]_ Clark, that is _Chloe_ you are scoping, man!  
            **Clark:** Not just Chloe. _\[camera swerves to show Lana next to Chloe\]_
            
    -   Inverted when Clark is Brought Down to Normal. Since under normal circumstances, a human partner couldn't do the deed without him potentially hurting them, Clark has exploited the opportunity to scratch that itch. He later gets training to avoid that problem.
    -   Lana and Clark go at it after she temporarily gains Kryptonian powers, causing a series of seismic events which cause considerable concern to the townsfolk.
    -   Maxima, Zatanna, and a few others use Psychic Powers, magic, or other talents to seduce people.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   In _Star Trek: The Original Series_, we are introduced to (among other things) Pon Farr, the Vulcans' version of Mate or Die.
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
        -   In "The Naked Now", an intoxicated Tasha Yar confirmed early on that yes, Data is _fully_ functional and has _multiple_ "recreational" techniques programmed into him.
        -   A Ferengi once beamed both Deanna and Lwaxanna Troi right out of their clothes with his transporter. However, this is probably a cultural thing. (Ferengi women are expected to be naked, and Ferengi men are scandalized by women wearing clothes. Betazoids have no nudity taboo, so the two women were only mildly annoyed at this detail.) Unless Gene Roddenberry was writing...
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
        -   Quark's holosuites include programs such as "Vulcan Love Slave" which are very popular with a certain clientèle. He also spends an entire episode's B-plot trying to get a scan of Kira Nerys to make holographic Rule 34 of her for a client, which ends in Kira sabotaging the program so that Quark's head is superimposed on her body.
        -   It's also established that Klingon resilience makes for some extremely rough sex. Broken bones on the wedding night are kind of a badge of honor.
        -   In "Chimera", Odo and Kira make up after a misunderstanding and proceed to celebrate their reunion with the prime time-safe version of sex — Odo transforms into a shimmering golden cloud of light and envelops Kira, who spreads her arms wide, turns slowly around and revels in it with a look of complete ecstasy on her face. (This doubles as a Call-Back to the original series episode "Metamorphosis", in which a happily marooned Zefram Cochrane shares the same experience with his companion.)
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Both the holographic doctor and Tom Paris employ the holodeck to help their resident Vulcans deal with their Pon Farr problem. The Doctor has also explicitly upgraded himself with the necessary equipment for sex. His superior model in the Alpha Quadrant can't help but ask for that particular modification.
    -   In _Star Trek: Enterprise_, Tucker once accidentally cloaks half his arm. Mayweather casually suggests that "It might be helpful on movie night, if you bring a date", only for Tucker to shoot him a look. Then Mayweather clarifies: "in case you want to steal some popcorn...."
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   Sam has always been _less than tender_ with his partners. So when he becomes addicted to the powers that he gets from demon blood, he and his female demon mentor can take advantage of any open wounds she happens to have. Or, they could make some new ones. Hey, it's all _practice_.
    -   In another episode, some teenage loser uses a recently-created wishing well to make himself invisible so that he can spy on girls showering and such. He then gets hit by a car that can't see him.
-   _Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills_: In the episode "Nightmare on Rodeo Drive", the heroes become trapped in a dream world. Swinton figures it out and tells the others that anything they think of comes true. Gordon smiles at Laurie and she is suddenly in her bra and panties. She gets annoyed and wills her clothes back.
-   _True Blood_:
    -   Vampires often use their Super-Strength and Super-Speed on intimate partners. On a couple of occasions, vampires have been shown to screw at "warp speed". They are also prone to abuse their Hypnotic Eyes, as well as the fact that humans that drink their blood develop erotic desires towards them, even against their own sexual orientation.
    -   When Jason finds out that Sam is a shifter, he begins to wonder just what other uses this power has. He once wonders if Sam has had sex with an animal while an animal, because it wouldn't be bestiality if Sam was in animal form, it'd just be nature. Andy is disgusted by even thinking of this. It's unknown if Sam does this or not.
-   Subverted in _The Vampire Diaries_. When Elena becomes a vampire in Season 4, she becomes "sire-bound" to Damon. Not only must she do anything he tells her will make him happy, she wants to. She breaks up with Stefan and has sex with Damon, but at this point Damon is unaware of the sire bond. When he learns that is what is happening, he tries _very_ hard to resist taking advantage of the opportunity — no small feat for a Villain Protagonist.
-   _The Wheel of Time (2021)_: Maksim, one of Alanna's Warders, strongly implies that his Bond with her is used for enhanced pleasure while they and Ivhon have sex, since it lets them feel things the others do.
-   _The Whitest Kids U' Know_ has a sketch about a man who trains himself to be able to use telekinesis... so that he can masturbate while laying back with his hands behind his head.
-   In an episode of _Xena: Warrior Princess_ with a magical parchment that makes whatever is written on it happen, Joxer uses it to make not just one, not just two, but _three_ naked dancing copies of Gabrielle appear, much to her disgust. Of course, he didn't realize that it was a magic parchment, he was just trying to write a sexy limerick to win her affections.

    Music 

-   Tom Smith's "Waking Up Jedi". Two excerpts:
    
    _I had those Jedi mind tricks which were quite the little perk  
    My girlfriend is weak-minded; I was almost late for work._
    
    _And best of all, my girl and I combine our Jedi powers  
    There's lots of ways to use the force. And some can last for hours._
    
-   Several examples of this are featured in the "Superhero Sex Scenes" sketches on Mikey Mason's album _Squedge_.
-   The video for "Whip It" by Devo, in which skills with a whip are naturally used to remove a woman's clothes.
-   The eponymous Mad Scientist in "Dr. Stein" by Helloween clones his assistant "once or twice" for sexual purposes.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Celtic Mythology:
    -   Before the final battle with the Fomorians, The Morrigan uses her shapeshifting powers to turn into a giantess before making love to her husband, The Dagda.
    -   The god Lugh shrunk himself tiny and let himself get swallowed by a woman via hiding in her drink. This resulted in the woman getting pregnant with Lugh’s son Cu Chulainn.
-   Classical Mythology:
    -   Zeus would transform himself into various forms to seduce or rape mortal women.
        -   He impregnated Danaë (producing Perseus) with a "shower of gold." Many artists took the shower of gold as several gold coins falling on Danaë. Of course, "golden shower" kinda means something else these days.
        -   He sired Myrmidon (and thus the Myrmidon people) with Eurymedusa by transforming the both of them into ants (hence the name — _myrmex_ is Greek for "ant").
        -   He carried Europa from the mainland to Crete in the form of a white bull; the myths differ on whether he remained a bull while he and she did the deed; either way, the union produced Minos, the first King of Crete.
        -   He famously seduced Queen Leda of Sparta in the form of a swan. According to at least one form of the myth, this led to Leda laying two eggs, one with Castor and Clytemnestra, the other with Pollux and Helen. You see, the former were the children of Leda's mortal husband Tyndareus (with whom she had also slept that day), and the latter two were the children of Zeus. No, we have no idea how this works either.
        -   Heracles/Hercules was conceived via a Bed Trick — Zeus couldn't trick Alcmene into sleeping him the normal way, so he transformed into her husband. Her _actual_ husband showed up not long after, which is why Heracles has a Muggle twin brother.
        -   Do you know what's _arguably_ creepier than turning into an animal to sexually assault someone? Turning into your own _daughter_ to do it! That's how Zeus knocked up Artemis' follower, Callisto.
    -   Demeter's brief relationship with Poseidon was somewhat similar. It wasn't clear whether it was truly rape or seduction, but she fled from him in the shape of a mare, but he caught her by turning into a stallion. The result was, Demeter gave birth to a foal that grew into a horse _who could talk_.
-   Hindu Mythology:
    -   Krishna once rescued 16,000 (or 16,100 in a couple of versions) women from a demon and married all of them. He proceeded to split himself up into multiple bodies in order to bed each of them on the same night.
    -   The Mahabharata kicks off when Pandu kills two deer having sex, who are actually a powerful sage and his wife shapeshifting for fun. Since he's subsequently cursed that he Can't Have Sex, Ever, he gets kids by having his wives summon gods to impregnate them.
-   Loki from Norse Mythology once turned into a female horse and got pregnant. There was a belief that Loki might occasionally spend several years at a time as a woman, marry a mortal man, possibly give birth to several children and one day disappear. Thus people whose mother went missing were sometimes called "children of Loki".
-   The _Hantu Raya_ of Malaysian Mythology is a ghostly Familiar that is physically identical to its master. One of the stated uses for it is committing adultery, because it can pose as the sorceror while he is off sleeping with another man's wife.
-   The Ring of Gyges is another good example, where a man named Gyges finds a ring that makes him invisible. He proceeds to rape the King's wife, simply because he can.

    Podcasts 

-   Quantus the Tech Priest (David's character from _Fandible_'s long-running series of _Rogue Trader_ episodes) is a cyborg who's mostly composed of robot parts, and can communicate with most forms of technology. His fascination with Xenos technology, and the methods he employs when examining alien archeotech, are... _disturbing._
-   _Plumbing the Death Star_:
    -   In the middle of "Professor Charles Xavier's Crazy Summer," Duscher guesses that Thor wouldn't be scared by Professor X's mind control powers, only for Zammit to respond in his Xavier imitation, "Well let's try. Boop-boop-boop, fist your own asshole. _\[beat\]_ Yes, I think we know who's in charge here." All three burst out laughing and barely manage to continue the episode.
    -   Shanks concludes in "How Dare Wizards?!" that if _Harry Potter_'s wizards were to come out and integrate with normal society, magical porn would immediately become a thing, and that wizards' ability to turn into animals would rapidly see some weird results.
    -   Since "pleasing mum" is part of the metric in "Which Super Smash Bro would Make the Best Step-Dad?", a point is almost made about Yoshi the dinosaur and his abilities, but Duscher mercifully shuts the train of thought down.
-   One of the purposes of "Which Superhero Would Make The Best Lover?" is to discuss how superheroes could use their powers to improve their love life.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In one of the sourcebooks for _Aberrant_, White Wolf's supers game, there is an organization made up of LGBT novas who band together for queer solidarity. This includes activists, crimefighters, superpowered pro wrestlers... and some more bent characters like Tommy Orgy, a musician with duplication powers, and The Master, a hyper-charismatic dominant who specializes in using his powers to "correct" homophobes.
-   _Bleak World_ has the Court of Wine for the Princess race. It's spells cost less than any other spell in the game, but would likely only be used for sexual mischief. Their 10th level spell (which for most other organizations would be a world destroying lightning bolt or summoning an old god) is turning everyone in a city into drunken nymphomaniacs.
-   _Cyberpunk 2020_ has both cybernetic implants (for both sexes) and mind altering chips (giving you skills to seduce and please). Because "it's not not enough to be hung like a horse, you must know how to use it".
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   There is a fan-created rulebook for 2nd edition which concerns sex. In addition to setting out a great deal of information about the copulative habits of elves and whatnot, it also has a section of "New Kinks with Old Spells", which puts a sexual twist on traditional _D&D_ spells. They include _charm person_, _polymorph_ and _unseen servant_. The d20-era _Book of Erotic Fantasy_ has similar content.
    -   The more powerful illusion spells effect all five senses. And you can choose to fail your save to disbelieve... just use your imagination.
    -   Players also like to bring up the fact that Paladins have disease immunity as a class feature. In fact, this is even mentioned in the aforementioned _Book of Erotic Fantasy_ as a bonus for Paladins who decide to play Lawful Good Ethical Sluts.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   On the non-magical side of _D&D_, a character who gets a high enough result on an Escape Artist skill check is capable of squeezing through a four-square-inch hole. 4chan decided to go "spelunking".
    -   The old Mature Topics forum on wizards.com generated some fascinating discussions.
    -   In the _Eberron_ setting, it is repeatedly and explicitly established that changelings can have whatever appearance or gender they like (_including_ genderless or hermaphrodite), as long as it is humanoid and in the Medium size category. And they don't change sex while pregnant.
    -   In _Dragon_ #315, the Prestige Class "Silverhaired Knight" was introduced. Now, it might not be obvious at first glance, but at level 5 they get the ability _Consume Sins_, which changes any evil fey, giant, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid's alignment to Neutral, and it just requires you to maintain physical contact for a number of minutes equal to the target's HD, and the target must be conscious. Given how long sex lasts, it's entirely plausible for you to redeem the Big Bad by sleeping with them. And yes, they do actually have Perform (Sexual Acts) as a class skill. Going by this, it's likely an _intended_ option of using the _Consume Sins_ ability.
    -   Even core spells can be used in this manner. For example, the spell _Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion_ specifies that the extradimensional mansion comes staffed with 100 near-transparent, completely obedient servants that can perform any action a human servant can perform, with the exception of attacking or harming others. Furthermore, the caster decides the appearance and attire of said servants — if the caster (for example) decides they look like big-breasted Catgirls in French Maid Outfits, there's not much the DM can do.
    -   A few core spells can be diverted from their normal usage to become The Nudifier. Notably, a _baleful polymorph_ spell leaves items and clothing unaffected, thus even if dispelled, temporarily suppressed by Anti-Magic, or reverted by a natural shapechanger, the subject will end up stark naked. Even a _disintegrate_ spell can be aimed toward clothes instead of the one wearing them, although it's overkill. The _invisibility_ spell can also be directed at objects, in which case the clothing isn't removed, but the visual effect is the same. The spell _telekinesis_ (and the psionic power _telekinetic maneuver_) can perform a distant grapple, and among the options of grappling is removing items worn, thus telekinesis can be used to strip a subject.
-   _Exalted_:
    -   The Lunars can create empowered demi-humans called Beastmen. To do so, they need to either A) take a human form and have intercourse with an animal or B) take an animal form and have intercourse with a human... keep in mind, some characters have entire armies of these.
    -   There's also a skill they can learn which allows them to swap gender.
    -   And as of _Dreams of the First Age_, Lunars have access to a high-Essence Shapeshifting Knack that modifies their ability to take another human's form. Instead of needing to kill the human and partake of their heart's blood, they just need to have sex with them. Third edition then updates this with a number of low Essence charms that allow Lunars to claim peoples shapes through a variety of contests, deals, and other symbolic 'sacred hunts' that all leave the person alive.
    -   There are two sex-based martial arts styles. The _Scroll of the Monk_ introduced Orgiastic Fugitive Style, although that book is considered Fanon Discontinuity. _Glories of the Most High_ provided the alternative.
    -   Solars have a Performance charm _specifically_ to make everyone present fall in love with them or their cause. It's called "Husband-Seducing Demon Dance".
-   _F.A.T.A.L._, although there, it's not so much "Perversion Potential" as it is "Perversion: The Game".
-   _GURPS_ has fun with this. Flexibility explicitly gives you a bonus on Erotic Art rolls. The _Bio-Tech_ supplement is very aware of this trope with it's "enhanced female secondary and male primary sexual characteristics", "Exotic Genitalia" and "Prehensile Tongue" all giving bonuses to the same skill.
-   _In Nomine_ has what are called songs, which are functionally equivalent to spells in D&D. The songs of Numinous Corpus allow for bodily transformation. The Book of Songs says that the Demon Prince of Lust "is known to share several "ornamental" Numinous Corpus that are best left to the imagination . . .".
    -   Likewise, each Archangel/Demon Prince gives the different types of angel/demon a special abilities, and have additional abilities they can be granted. Naturally, some of Lust's require sex to even function properly. On a more sex positive note, the Archangel of Creation approves so much of (explicitly) consensual sex that when his servants engage in it, they get Essence (the energy source for powers).
-   _Old World of Darkness_/_New World of Darkness_: Considering that White Wolf published an official (though admittedly non-canonical) erotic novel set in the _Old World of Darkness_, we have moved beyond mere "potential" for perversion here.
    -   _Vampire: The Requiem_, full stop. There's Majesty, which is Charm Person, taken Up to Eleven. There's Dominate, which is the classic vampire Hypnotic Eyes. There's Protean, which is the power to change shapes (including partial transformation, with a minor application of Resilience). And then there's the Kiss of the Vampire itself, which is so ungodly pleasurable it can substitute for a sex act (and its damage can be healed with _licking_). And that's just the core book. There's more in the Splats.
    -   _Mage: The Awakening_ has an entire Legacy, the Whipping Boys, that originated when a depressed mage psychically compelled a dominant to _really_ hurt him during a session and found something transcendent beyond the pain.
    -   And beating out the Whipping Boys would be the Cult of Ecstasy from the predecessor game, _Mage: The Ascension_. The cult is made of various ecstatics who find power in the exhaustion of the body. This can be anything from exercise to drugs to fasting, but sex seems to be very, _very_ popular. And they have control over Time, which can lead to some interesting scenarios.
    -   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ has Gifts, magical abilities one can learn from various spirits of nature. Animal Attraction causes a flood of pheromones to act as a very powerful aphrodisiac. Persuasion is used to give credence or imbue greater meaning when persuading someone. Depending on your Storyteller, Persuasion can be used to convince someone to do anything.
    -   _Werewolf: The Forsaken_ has the "Call Human" rite, which explicitly mentions in its description that less-than-virtuous werewolves have used it to summon random humans to their location to rape them. That said, the sexual/spiritual/pheromonal attraction between a werewolf and a wolf-blooded human is strong enough to almost qualify as date rape itself.
    -   _Changeling: The Lost_ has the Spring Court. Every court has a signature emotion they can feed off of and manipulate, such as Anger for the Summer Court or Fear for the Autumn Court. The Spring Court's emotion is Desire, so they can do things like learn someone's desires, alter someone's desires, appear as the person a target most desires, or compel someone to pursue their desires regardless of the costs. Desire isn't just lust, but lust and sexual desires are explicitly included.
    -   Fangame _Genius: The Transgression_ discusses the use of Wonders for funtimes. For the most part, doing such is a minor ding on the karma meter (since you're misusing the power), and getting _really_ kinky might cause a minor sanity break, but there are several things that _will_ result in your Obligation going down hard; any love potions or sosuch are _absolutely_ analogous to rape, and taken just as seriously.
    -   _Princess: The Hopeful_ has the Specchio Charms (signature abilities of the Queen of Mirrors), which are infamous for being this in spades. Examples include making people into your suitors to prove their love to you in a way the Princess specifies, giving bonuses on seduction rolls, and "Through the Looking Glass", which allows a Princess to enter in Another Dimension inside a mirror and carve an invisible hideout inside, and is explicitly mentioned in its description as perfect for Princesses who try to bring a boyfriend home without their mother knowing.
-   _Shadowrun_ is full of this, at least in the setting chapters.
    -   It's a Cyberpunk game, so The Internet Is for Porn is taken Up to Eleven. Simsense is officially so couch potatoes can visit Aspen to ski or climb mountains, but the primary use is detailed in _Strange Days_ — recordings of people screwing, and recordings of people committing crimes. There's interactive virtual reality Visual Novels, so of course there's interactive virtual reality porn. There's Snuff Films, so there's simulations where users can pretend to _die_ — which often drives them insane. The _Augmentation_ supplement has cybernetic genitals. Perhaps most disturbing are "bunraku"; prostitutes with artificial personalities — think Joss Whedon's _Dollhouse_, but used by organized crime on unwilling subjects. Usually these are just attractive men and women with a single brain implant, but particularly ruthless operations will mix-and-match body parts from various subjects to produce an "ideal" and kill the discards.
    -   Magic gets "perverted" every bit as much. Certain mages have been rumored to use Summoned Spirits for... services. The chapter on Sapient Shapeshifting Animals as PCs has a sidebar called "But they look Metahuman!", in which a Jackpoint poster attempts to explain the differences between shifters and actual metahumans (resulting in Fastjack having to edit the explicit sexual content out of the post). To top it all off? _Street Magic_ contains variants on the "Confusion" spell called "Orgasm" and "Orgy". That's not even getting into Seattle's underground sex industry, or the more "creative" uses of various other abilities. The 5th edition rulebook even explicitly states that when anything new is discovered (in the example given, it's the re-emergence of magic) the first two questions asked are "How can I make money off of it?" and "How can I use it in porn?".
-   Followers and daemons of Slaanesh in _Warhammer_ and _Warhammer 40,000_ are constantly seeking new sensations, and while sex is far from the only source it is used frequently. Slaanesh itself was born this way in _40K_, as the Eldar devolved so much into hedonism that their emotions coalesced in the Warp and birthed the Chaos God of depravity.

    Video Games 

-   _Baldur's Gate III_: If the player romances Halsin and chooses to have sex with him, before the act he'll briefly Wild Shape into a bear before switching back, saying he sometimes can't "tame the beast", as it were. The player has the option to ask him to switch back. If you tell him you're into it, he warns you that it'll be quite "untamed, vigorous, and large", but does shift back into a bear for the encounter. We don't see much after he approaches, but judging by the reaction we see from a nearby squirrel he's correct.
-   _BioShock_:
    -   The Scout Plasmid of _BioShock 2_ is, for all intentions, an Astral Projection power set, allowing the user's consciousness to move and effect the world independently of its body. A cut audio diary from the game reveals that a man named Tommy Hanrahan was using it to spy on the ladies' dressing room at the Adonis Resort.
    -   Taken further in _BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea_ with the Peeping Tom plasmid, which allows the user to see through walls and even turn invisible. It's found at an adult bookstore/novelty shop, with the following audio diary.
        
        **Antonio Rodriguez:** Dear Madam, I have received your letter regarding our line of Peeping Tom Plasmids, and wish to respond thusly: Tough. Luck. This is Rapture, miss. What my customers do with my product is their business. If you are feeling uncomfortable, you are more than welcome to line the walls of your home in lead. If you wish, I could direct you to a reputable supplier.
        
    -   _BioShock Infinite_ itself has the Possession vigor, which turns enemies and devices to your side. A kinetoscope advertising it shows a customer amassing a harem of ladies to visit a beach with him.
-   In _Blackwell Epiphany_ this is joked about by Abe Goldfarb, Joey's voice actor, in one of the commentary nodes, noting that because Joey can only lightly blow on things, fellating the living is his power. He thus declares as canon that "Joey sucks a mean dick".
-   _Dark Souls_: What would you do when you have the Force miracle, which allows you to blow away stuff without doing any harm? Pushing the Hollows to bottomless pits? Causing a nuisance around the people? Deflecting the arrows? Or, blowing away the Godiva Hair from the Fair Lady... **What?**
-   _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_ has a sidequest involving a pimp forcing his girls to get augmented.
    
    **Mei Suen:** You can tell your customers to get augmentations themselves so they can go fuck themselves!  
    **Edgar Lee:** I'm sure some of them already have.
    
-   In _Disgaea_, the "Tentacles" Weapon for Monster Classes is stated in its item description to be "good for groping all kinds of places."
-   _Dragon Age_
    -   _Dragon Age II_:
        -   Isabela to Anders, recounting an evening at a Denerim brothel: "Oh! Were you the runaway mage who could do that electricity thing? That was nice..." Hawke or Varric interrupts them before that conversation can go any further.
        -   Isabela gets curious about Fenris' intangibility punch — or, as she calls it, "that magical fisting thing you do" — and speculates he could make a lot of money out of it. Subverted in a later conversation, when she suggests using it to remove sharp objects from people.
        -   In the "Legacy" DLC, if you pursued a romance with Merrill and take her and Anders with you, Anders might note how he saw her poking around his books the other day. She explains that she wanted to find some "dirty spells". Before the conversation escalates, Hawke stops it with a "Please, stop talking."
    -   In contrast to the second game, _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ plays this for drama and horror; while discussing the Rite of Tranquility (a magical process/punishment used to remove a dangerous or evil mage’s ability to feel emotion or make decisions, rendering them harmless), Cassandra mentions cases she’s seen of the Rite being abused, including incidents where corrupt Templars falsely invoked it to turn mages they found attractive into complacent sex slaves. On an equally creepy note, it’s eventually revealed that the reason Dorian’s on such bad terms with his family is because his father saw his homosexuality as a threat to the family’s bloodline and tried to use a blood magic ritual to _rewrite his mind to make him heterosexual_, like a horrific, magic-based version of conversion therapy.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_:
    -   There is a dungeon called Yngvild where a shunned necromancer named Arondil has taken refuge. After he starts resurrecting the bodies in the crypt he finds that all of them are female, and he slowly realizes the advantages of having an army of reanimated women that bend to his will. Then it gets weird. He discovers it feels a lot better to feel up the ghosts than have sex with the bodies, and proceeds to have his zombies go kidnap more women from the town he was shunned from so that he can murder them and bind their ghosts to his will. And yes, this is _exactly_ as creepy and disturbing as it sounds.
    -   If you level up your pickpocketing skill to 100, you can get the Perfect Touch perk, which lets you steal people's equipped items. Like their clothes. _That they are currently wearing_. This leads to many of Skyrim's women suddenly losing everything but their lingerie and continuing their daily lives while almost naked<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , all thanks to one lusty Dragonborn.
-   In _Fallout: New Vegas_, one side-quest has you searching The REPCONN Test Site for a shipment of Stealth Boys. One terminal entry mentions that every employee was required to reread the company's sexual harassment and workplace behaviors polices, implying they were used just this way.
-   There was a Memetic Mutation about Rider (Medusa) having A+ "Riding" skill because she's... skilled. Eventually, it was revealed that an inversion of this _does_ allow Servants to have the "Ride" skill because of it. Two later Servants in the Nasuverse, Meltryllis and Queen Medb _both_ have B-ranked Riding skill because of how much sex they had in their legends.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Mass Effect_:
    
    -   Biotics can be used for... all manner of purposes. Mordin will even point this out if Shepard is pursuing a romance with a biotic, offering some manuals and reading material on helping you get the most bang for your biotic. Doubly hilarious if _Shepard_ is also a biotic.
    -   Gentleman Thief Kasumi Goto takes full advantage of her cloaking, using it to spy on her crush Jacob while he does sit-ups, and offering a few... perceptive observations, like this one if you romance Miranda:
    
    **Kasumi:** I have to ask: how genetically modified is Miranda? Because... wow.
    
    -   Drell's Photographic Memory, according to Thane, is useful for "lonely nights."
-   One of your party members in _Mask of the Betrayer_ is Gannayev, the son of a night hag who has the ability to enter into and travel through people's dreams. Being one of the very few pretty hagspawns in the land and more than a bit of a Casanova, he gleefully abuses this power to hop into the dreams of horny farm girls so he can get laid even in his sleep.
-   Used in the toe-curling hilarious fan-made _Ace Attorney_ H-Game, _Phoenix Drive_ — from what is legible from the awesomely terrible translation, it's shameless about having the characters who are mediums use their powers to, er, change their body shape during... activities. Highlights involve them channeling "sleeping girls" (incidentally, Franziska von Karma and April May), which is a power certainly not exhibited in-game, and keeping their original personality during a channeling (insofar as the characters in the game had their original personalities).
-   _Planescape: Torment_:
    -   When the protagonist learns about Grace's succubus kiss, he takes his time to write down that, as immortal, he can survive it.
    -   One of the optional puzzles in Grace's Bordello is solving the mystery of disappearing lingerie. It turns out to be a mage, shapeshifted into a dresser, to hold all the ladies' underwear.
-   Zoroark is available in _Pokémon Sword and Shield_ via the _Isle of Armor_ Downloadable Content expansion. Its _Shield Version_ Pokédex entry mentions how Zoroark, a Pokémon able to assume via illusion the appearances of other beings, including humans, is valued among "lonely trainers."
-   In _Psychonauts_ one of the campers, Nils Lutefisk, plots to use Clairvoyance on an acorn to spy on girls through a squirrel's eyes.
-   In _Quest for Glory II_ you can buy x-ray glasses from Keapon Laffin. Among other uses the hero can look through walls at women changing clothes. At one point, a girl can be seen fully nude, with nipples in the Fan Remake.
-   _Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon_ has the option to use a Skill Order demon in conjunction with a strand of hair to morph the hero into a woman. In fact, alignment can be freely changed before the locking event by visiting the local bathhouse in that shape, and checking if you can get in.
-   _Splatoon 2_: During the Flight vs. Invisibility Splatfest, Pearl and Marina both discuss the potential applications of these two powers. Marina, representing Team Invisibility, points out some of its perks:
-   Another BioWare appearance of the trope in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_. If a female Jedi Knight is romancing Doc, then Doc hangs a very big lampshade on this by commenting that she _must_ be using Force abilities to spice up sex. The Knight can lampshade right back by asking if that just makes him even more excited, which actually flusters him.

    Web Animation 

-   Sid in _Broken Quest_ uses his Magic Mirror to peep on fat women taking baths.
-   In the _Cartoon Hooligans_ episode "What If Superman Got Sick?!", Superman uses his X-ray vision to peek into the Justice League headquarters' female locker room, with Supergirl, Batgirl and Wonder Woman inside. The three are understandably pissed at him when they find out, along with the rest of the Justice League.

    Webcomics 

-   In _anti-HEROES_, a pair of pervert ghosts discuss who's hotter, the sexy vampire or the naughty tiefling. Frank mentions how a girl with a tail can do kinky stuff, before excusing himself when Keriss, said tailed tiefling, comes closer. Then she confirms to Kaal that yes, Frank is right about the whole tail thing.
-   _El Goonish Shive_:
-   _Erfworld_:
    -   Discussed: by the structure of the setting, all subordinate units are compelled to automatically obey the orders of any superior. That means _any_ order. Maggie even suggests that Parson could order one of the Archons to sleep with him if he needs to relieve stress, which he finds quite disturbing. More specifically, Archons are essentially angels that are hired out by their Private Military Contractor boss. They're hired on a sliding scale of fees, and the most expensive is "full service", where the archons will behave in all ways as units of the hiring side, up to and including fighting against their own faction if so ordered. It's mentioned that warlords who have hired Archons with this contract will often "make use of them" before sending them out to fight. Since they were resurrected by his side, they've decided to treat Parson as if he has hired them in this way.
    -   Another feature of Erfworld is that all non-fatal injuries completely heal at the start of your side's turn. BDSM can get a lot more hardcore when the only limitation is "don't croak your partner".
-   Thanks to all the Mad Science devices that one can purchase on the open market, it is quite common in _Girl Genius_ that the women of Europa wear disintegration-proof metal & leather underwear.
-   _Grrl Power_:
    -   An aversion: there is a poster in the Women's locker room that states that none of the men have X-ray vision and even if they did all they would see is bone and an outline of flesh.
    -   On the other hand, Sydney does consider using her scouting orb to spy on the men's room.
    -   There's a superheroine with the power of Self-Duplication. Her code name is "Harem", and it's for exactly the reason you think it is. A strip with a bonus panel carries the implication that she's experimented by herself before, too.
    -   Mr. Amorphous can stretch any part of himself, including his tongue. "Brook is a lucky girl, isn't she?"
    -   Deus's idea of wanting to make temporary, customizable superpowers available to the masses is represented by a Japanese vending machine selling 8-hour powers for the bedroom, like tentacles, horse-sized genitals, or Jiggle Physics.
    -   Dabbler is a succubus, so of course _everything_ in her repertoire is pervertible, from literally hypnotizing people with her body parts, to a gun which shoots full-body restraints, to a psychic sense for arousal and/or arousing situations (dubbed the "Porno Sense"). When mention is made of a global communication spell, Sydney immediately asks Dabbler if she uses it for sexting, which the latter confirms.
-   _The Last Days of Foxhound_: Decoy Octopus admits to Revolver Ocelot here that he once impersonated Berthold (a wolf) and used the opportunity to watch Sniper Wolf while she was in the shower since she would think it was only her pet. It worked... until the _real_ Berthold showed up behind him.
-   _Peter Is the Wolf_. Humans have lips but short tongues, wolves have long tongues but no lips, werewolves have lips and long tongues. This make them great at giving head.
-   _Narbonic_:
    -   Done offscreen: after Dave and Helen hook up, it's hinted that they use the "gender-swap tablets" seen earlier in the strip's run to... interesting effect (as well as the anti-gravity generator, and the nutrient tanks, and the containment room with the padded walls, and the electrodes, and the Steam Caverns of Mars...) One of Dave's laments after they break up is " **Good Lord, I'll never have lesbian sex again!**"
    -   Another strip has some of the other characters discussing Helen and Dave's relationship. After Helen wanders by, one of them comments "I'm pretty sure that was actually Dave..."
-   _Oglaf_ is half fantasy-comedy, half using fantasy elements in sexy ways.
    -   One of the merchants seen is a "Fucksmith", which really says it all.
    -   One of the _tamer_ things is a knight who hears of a girl with the power to inflict everything done to her onto her opponents instead, making her invincible, and the knight pursues her to experiment with screwing himself by proxy.
    -   Two shapeshifters are shown to use their abilities to open a brothel, but they're apparently a bit out of touch with how human sex actually works.
-   One _The Order of the Stick_ strip heavily implies Nale and Sabine have used the latter's shapechanging abilities to sexually experiment.
-   Randy Millholland of _Something\*Positive_ has several other projects, including _Rhymes with Witch_. One comic combines Ben Grim and a rock polisher.
-   _Special School_ has Manny, a bisexual college student with "super-charisma:" he subconsciously knows people's thoughts enough to intuit what they want to hear. It's not Mind Control or even conscious Mind Reading, but it's enough to get him a lot of sex if he wants it.
-   Subverted: In _Super Stupor_, superhero Magic Eye has a secret power to force anyone to tell the truth... but it only works while his penis is inside the target/victim. He's deeply disturbed by this, not just because it would in most cases require him to _rape_ an unwilling target, but because of the surprising number of people who _would_ willingly submit to it. Not to mention the fact that the discovery of this power led to the failure of marriage...
-   _Sluggy Freelance_:
    -   In "Torg Potter and the Chamberpot of Secretions", Torg is excited at the existence of a magical shop containing every book ever written because it also contains all the smut ever printed. (Then he realises he already has the Internet.)
    -   In the chapter "Falling", it turns out that one of Riff's ex-girlfriends (he has a _lot_ of those, some of them rather unusual, and most of them are not even ever shown on screen) exists as multiple clones. Torg immediately thinks of the possibility of Riff getting it on with more than one at the same time. Riff is offended, but it's implied he may have thought of the same thing. Later on, he's actually made the offer but turns it down due to context.
-   _xkcd_ strip #924 "3D Printer" discusses spam mail containing actual enlarged 3D-printed penises.

    Web Original 

-   Visit any Real Life forum about Lucid Dreaming. At least one person will claim to have used it to give themselves some really _kinky_ dreams. This just gets worse if the person in question is also into superpowers...
-   _Tales of MU_:
    -   At least part of Stef's interest in Mackenzie is because Mack is Nigh-Invulnerable, but still feels pain — and _likes_ it.
    -   Fee Jee also takes advantage of this at one point, as it lets her pretend to feed on a human without consequences.
    -   The side character stories also feature a psychic who enjoys telepathically participating in her neighbor's sex, and using telekinesis for unusual purposes.
-   CollegeHumor's video "Wish I Had a Portal Gun" explores a range of things that would be made possible by possessing the titular gun from _Portal_, including autofellatio.

    Websites 

-   The Dungeon Verse-inspired site _Les Parchemins Anodins_ managed to invert this trope, noticing that a monocle invented to see girls naked can be useful to look for daggers hidden in sleeves.
-   The SCP Foundation often has to prevent both the general populace and its own personnel from using SCPs for such purposes.

    Web Videos 

-   _Atop the Fourth Wall_: During a riff of the Chinese _Dragon Ball_ movie, Linkara asks a question regarding Oolong: Why does he try so hard to peep on women when he can turn into one any time he wants?
-   YouTube channel _Chowdhury Pranto_ has this video which explores the rather perverse potential of the Yamanaka clan's Mind Body Transmission technique. Ino uses it to switch bodies with Sai, then checks out his package (and has a Nose Bleed in response).
-   _Critical Role_:
    -   In their pirate raid, the Mighty Nein find a magic paintbrush that can make anything it paints real. They almost immediately realize that Jester — who has a habit of doodling dicks everywhere — can start making _real_ dicks now.
    -   In an early episode, before his character development, Scanlan once used a Suggestion spell to try and make a female NPC (Kima) attracted to his friend Grog, but the DM shut that down with a extreme predjudice, probably because of the Unfortunate Implications of such a joke. Much later, Scanlan also used a memory implantation spell to make Percy think he had an embarrassing encounter (just a massage) with a group of naked nymphs in the Feywild. The intention behind this was well-meaning, but he didn't need to make it a sexual memory. Still, Taliesin enthusiastically participated in this scene, so it's all cool. (Percy, on the other hand, both hugged and threatened to kill Scanlan when his original memories were restored.)
    -   Vox Machina once gave us this scene, though it was all just pretense in order to squick and get rid of some annoying guards, as well as amuse the audience of course.
    -   Considering the kind of humor the players have and the fact that in the first campaign, they had 1 routinely shapechanging druid, 2 player characters with high level Polymorph spells<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , a Hat of Disguise<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the spell Seeming<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the spell Modify Memory <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  — and most of these spells were part of the repertoire of resident Chivalrous Pervert Scanlan, who is also Charm Person personified ... it's actually pretty surprising how little this came up over the course of over 100 episodes, and that it's only rarely used in fanfic as well.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   YouTube channel _kishinpain_ has this video where Ino switches bodies with Sakura in order to seduce Sasuke, Lee, and Naruto one after the other. Unfortunately for her, though, the guys all prove to have lousy bedroom skills... and in turn, they and Sakura are _not_ pleased when they realize what Ino's done.
-   During Episode 5 of _Madoka Abridged_, Homura uses her powers to do _something_ to Madoka. The lingering focus on Madoka's legs as she vaguely admits to doing something really doesn't help. Homura also at least once threatens to rape Madoka and reset time, just because she can (and has done so multiple times).
-   During the Death 13 arc in _Vaguely Recalling JoJo_, one of the things Kakyoin does in the Dream World is to wish for the appearance of his favorite Anime heroine, but Death 13 shows up and denies Kakyoin's wish. When Hierophant Green is punishing Death 13, Kakyoin asks Death 13 to grant that wish.

    Western Animation 

-   One episode of _American Dad!_ involves Jeff Fischer, along with all sorts of space aliens, being kept as slaves on a spaceship mall. One of the slaves is a horny shapeshifting alien who seduces other aliens by transforming into their dream partners.
-   In the _Batman: The Animated Series_ episode "Mudslide", Batman wonders about Clayface's new female accomplice:
    
    **Batman:** What's her stake in this?  
    **Alfred:** (_deadpan_) Perhaps she enjoys mudbaths.
    
-   In _Batman Beyond_, Terry is told that there's a ghost in the girls' shower (and he has a batsuit that has a built-in camouflage system).
    
    **Terry:** An invisible boy in the showers... Why didn't I think of that?
    
-   Played for laughs in _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_, when the Birds of Prey (Black Canary, Huntress, and Catwoman) went undercover at a private club. The "Birds of Prey" song is loaded with jokes about the problems some heroes have due to their powers. Cartoon Network refused to air that episode, (at least in the US).
-   In the _Danny Phantom_ episode "Memory Blank", when Danny's memory returns, it's shown with a montage of still frames, most of which show him heroically fighting various foes. However, an image of Danny running out the girl's locker room (pictured above) shows up twice.
-   Parodied in the _Drawn Together_ episode "Terms of Endearment". Captain Hero's constant use of X-Ray Vision to check out Foxxy causes her to develop a brain tumor.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   A Cutaway Gag in one episode had Peter say he was once one of the Wonder Twins. When Jayna tells Peter to hurry up, he lets her know he'd be "right behind her". He shapeshifts into the form of Jayna's tampon and plays the waiting game.
    -   Another cutaway used in _Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story_ depicted Lion-O using the Sword of Omens' "sight beyond sight" to spy on Cheetara while she was on the toilet.
    -   A darker example occurred in one episode where the cast is watching a new version of _Superman_. In it, Lois and two other women at the _Daily Planet_ are sobbing in front of Clark after having learned they had breast cancer, the doctor having told them it was as if their breasts had been x-rayed daily for five hours for the past three years.
        
        **Clark:** Wow, first every woman I've ever met, and now you guys.
        
-   The common example of using X-ray vision to see through an attractive girl's clothes is alluded to in the _Freakazoid!_ episode "Next Time, Phone Ahead" when Freakazoid and Bo-Ron use X-ray vision obtained from eating carrots to look at the bone structure of their hands while Steff briefly appears in the background before looking worried and quickly leaving.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   In "Fry and the Slurm Factory'', Fry and Bender use the Professor's F-Ray to see through Slurm cans to find the hidden bottlecap. At one point Bender uses it to perv on a fembot, who is revealed to be transgender.
    -   In the movie _Into the Wild Green Yonder_, Fry gains the ability to read minds and, wanting to utilize his "super power," attempts to sneak into a women's locker room. Cue slapping.
        
        **Fry**: Oh wait, that's invisibility.
        
    -   In "Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch", a Holodeck Malfunction brings the characters within to life. Zapp, upon seeing the rampage, complains that the last malfunction resulted in him being slapped with three paternity suits.
-   _Groove Squad_: Upon learning fruit smoothies serve as fuel for her x-ray powers, Mac tests them by seeing through Zeke's mascot costume. He's upset for it.
-   An episode of _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_ has Zan's alibi be that he was Wonder Woman's bathwater at the time the crime took place.
-   _Justice League_:
    -   The writers hang a lampshade on one no-doubt famous idea in an episode, as Vixen pulls a surprised Green Lantern into an adjoining room for a little quality time.
        
        **Green Lantern:** Don't sneak up on me like that! You know what this ring could do to you?  
        **Vixen:** Promises, promises.
        
    -   In "Dark Heart", Wonder Woman has to carry Ray Palmer to the core of a self-replicating machine, so he shrinks down and she carries him in her cleavage. He doesn't lose the chance to comment on this.
    -   Inverted with the Flash in "Injustice for All", when Hawkgirl speculates that his speed is why he can't get a date. He agrees, but after the beat, he gets what she's talking about. (Ironically, a later episode indicates that he's actually an excellent lover. Though he was in a body without the speed force at the time, so the point may still stand.)
-   _Kaeloo_: In Episode 123, Kaeloo temporarily turns herself, Stumpy and Quack Quack into invisible ghosts who can phase through objects. Stumpy tries to use these powers to watch their neighbor Pretty taking a bath, but Kaeloo stops him before he sees anything.
-   Downplayed in _The Owl House_ when Luz finds herself in a Void Between the Worlds with cubes that let her see through the nearest reflective surface of anyone in the human or demon realms. Her first idle thought upon realizing this (which she doesn't actually follow through with) is to see what her girlfriend is doing.
-   _Rick and Morty_:
    -   Taken to extremes in "Auto Erotic Assimilation", where Rick takes advantage of his lover being a Puppeteer Parasite Hive Mind alien who's taken over a planet to fulfill ridiculously excessive fantasies to the point that it starts to disrupt the functioning of society (not helping is that the sheer amount of drugs is causing Unity to lose control over segments of a highly violent population).
        
        **Rick:** I need a hang glider, and a crotchless Uncle Sam costume, and I want your largest stadium filled end to end with naked redheads, and I want the stands packed with every man who remotely resembles my father.
        
    -   Later in the episode, we get this:
        
        **Rick:** But first, can you assimilate a giraffe?
        
    -   In "Star Mort Rickturn Of The Jerri", Morty and Summer fight over use of Rick's invisibility belt. Both being horny teenagers, they immediately use it for basically the same thing, Summer using it to spy on an attractive male neighbour, sneak into his bedroom, and smell his stuff, while Morty sneaks into the high-school cheerleaders' showers. It's so predictable, Summer immediately guesses exactly where Morty is going to go with it.
-   _Robot Chicken_:
    -   In their spoof of _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_, John does this by proxy: his sexy female Terminator, Cameron, follows his commands to record video in the girls' locker room, beat up his bullies, and...well, she _is_ a sexy female.
    -   In a different sketch "the Nerd" plans to jump into a pool of drowned girl, ALA _Ranma ½,_ and fantasizes himself sneaking into a girl's shower room. He is then reminded that being exposed to hot water turns him back into a boy. He does so and is promptly beaten up by the girls. The Nerd decides it's worth it anyway.
    -   One _ThunderCats (1985)_ sketch shows Lion-O using the Sword of Omens' "Sight Beyond Sight" to look at Cheetara while she's in heat and in another room (similar to the _Family Guy_ gag above).
        
        **Lion-O:** Don't do this, Lion-O...put down the sword...put it—oooohhh, that's so hot...
        
    -   The "Bring a Sidekick to Work Day" sketch has Kid Flash use his super speed to strip Wonder Woman. The Flash reprimands his sidekick's actions, but takes the opportunity to do a super speed high five.
    -   Naturally, one sketch featuring Superman opens with him using his X-ray vision to watch a woman showering in the next apartment over.
-   Referenced in _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_, where dorky Ferguson suggests that having a Prehensile Tail might help him score with the ladies.
-   _Superman: The Animated Series_:
    -   In the episode "New Kids in Town", after the Legion of Super-Heroes travel back in time and rescue a teenaged Clark Kent from Brainiac, Saturn Girl erases everyone's memories to prevent affecting history. She decides to take advantage of this by kissing Clark.
    -   The _second episode_ brings up the "girl's locker room" version of this trope, when a teenaged Clark confides to Lana that he can see through solid walls all of a sudden. Though it isn't brought up in the way one might think. Clark reveals this to Lana by viewing through a wall where an elderly teacher of theirs is putting up decorations for a school dance and Clark being concerned about no one holding the ladder she's perched on. Lana then jokes on how many times he's used this ability to peek into the girl's locker room. Clark doesn't exactly take her kidding around very well (he's freaked out by the strange things that have been happening to him as his powers begin to emerge).
-   In the 12th episode of the cartoon "Tara Duncan", which is based on the French fantasy book series with the same name, Cal uses a spell that freezes time in order to stop the Monster of the Week after giving each of his teammates, Tara and Sparrow, a kiss on the cheeks.
-   _The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat_ had this happen in the episode "Wet Paint", where Felix at one point uses the 3-D paint to create an attractive woman to make out with.
-   The title character of _Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?_ had an X-ray built into his head, which was used for perverse purposes twice.
    -   The Yogman Twins Lenny and Denny trick him into using his X-ray to spy on the girls' locker room in "Electric Boogaloo".
    -   After Robot befriends the girls in "Gender", they use his X-ray to spy on the boys' bathroom.
-   _Young Justice_ has Miss Martian and Superboy engage in a little roleplay scenario where M'gann assumes the form of Black Canary in some _very_ friendly sparring where they eventually end up kissing. When witnessing footage of this Green Arrow finds it very funny but Black Canary is not at all amused. J'onn comments that this is a normal game among the telepathic Martians given that both parties are always aware of the other's true identity.
