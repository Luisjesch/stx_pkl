Captain Snow sure has his priorities straight.

_"The perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility. I admire its purity. A survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality."_

— **Ash** from _Alien_, describing the titular Xenomorph

Most people react to a menacing creature or potentially dangerous situation with some degree of fear, anger, or resignation. This guy reacts to it with _glee_.

Why? Well, they've done a lot of research on it. They've always wanted to see it. They were the one person who believed it existed, and now they've been vindicated. Whatever the case, they're absolutely _thrilled_ that it's here and close enough to kill them.

Of course, the fanboy trance usually fades when they realize the implications of the whole "close enough to kill them" thing. In serious works, their encyclopedic knowledge gives them the means to neutralize the threat, or at least get themselves and their team out of harm's way. In more comedic works or works in which It Can Think, they could even graduate to full-fledged Fluffy Tamer and befriend the creature... or the creature could befriend them alone and continue to be hostile to the rest of their group. Alternatively, the fanboy never realizes he is in danger and skates out unharmed through blind luck.

Obviously, while this usually applies to fictional fantasy dangers, this can also apply to threats someone might encounter in Real Life, especially natural dangers like tornadoes, tigers, or sharks.

Compare Villain Respect, Worthy Opponent, Misaimed Fandom, Nightmare Fetishist, Casual Danger Dialogue, In Love with Your Carnage, Measuring the Marigolds, Ugly Cute, The Xenophile, and Arson, Murder, and Admiration. Contrast Wowing Cthulhu, where the abomination admires you, and Horror Struck, where the character was _not_ expecting the monster to be real, and proof of its existence brings their brain to a screeching halt.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Hange Zoe from _Attack on Titan_ has an unhealthy fascination with Titans and her response to seeing Eren's partially transformed arm is to beg to touch it. Even in their Last Stand against the armies of Wall Titans, Hange couldn't help but to be enamored by their majesty.
-   The 1989 anime _Baoh_ (based on the manga of the same name), features the creation of a humanoid bio-weapon that naturally turns on its creators. Dr. Kasuminome, the head of the project, is Baoh's final victim, and can't help gushing about it's remarkable killing capacity, even while his body's gushing blood when eviscerated by Baoh.
    
    **Dr. Kasuminome:** "Oh Baoh, my beautiful creation, my great work of art- you are truly... magnificent!"
    
-   _Claymore_ gives us Dae, who becomes obsessed with seeing Priscilla in all her glory after discovering her severed arm, which still held an insane amount of power. When he finally does find her, he spends the entire time gushing about her, creeping out his companion Rubel in the process.
-   L from _Death Note_. He only takes on cases that interest him and though understated he finds his Kira suspect, Light Yagami, to be quite fascinating and regards him as a Worthy Opponent. L gets very annoyed at the appearance of a Second Kira, a copycat killer, because it's not _HIS_ Kira and not playing by the same rules. In the live action movies he's clearly entertained to watch Light manipulate Naomi Misora on the monitors.
    
    **Souichiro Yagami:** We have to stop this!  
    **L:** We're _just_ getting to the good part.
    
-   In _Delicious in Dungeon_, Laios is quicker to awe at the dangerous monsters of the dungeon than be actually wary of them. Played straighter when, upon laying eyes on Falin's chimera transformation for the first time (which he has just seen kill several people) his first thought is to admire how cool it looks before he starts worrying about her monstrous state.
-   _Doraemon: Nobita and the Castle of the Undersea Devil_, taking place at the bottom of the ocean has this happen. Nobita, who up until that point has been ridiculed by his friends for telling them of the existence of giant octopus (and he did see it), is overjoyed when the monster appears and smash their undersea camp. The other kids lampshade his improper rejoicing.
-   A Filler scene in _Dragon Ball Z_ has Ginyu (In Bulma's body) watching Frieza's last transformation and fighting with Goku, commenting on how great and powerful he was and confusing the hell out of Gohan, Krillin and Piccolo.
    -   Goku has the tendency to do this with many of his opponents, as he's less concerned about how dangerous or evil they are and more about how much fun it will be to fight against them.
-   _Hellsing_ gives us the Doctor's reacting to Alucard summoning an army of hundreds of thousands of familiars with a combination of euphoria and excitement.
-   _Kaiju Girl Caramelise_: Manatsu grew up as a big fan of Kaiju media, and she becomes captivated by Harugon as a result, praising "him" for his monstrous appearance and even expressing a willingness to be _crushed_ by him.
-   _Lapis Re:LiGHTs_ has Tiara of the group LiGHTS. She loves taking care of plants and has a special fondness for carnivorous and outright dangerous species, like Mandrakes. These can shriek loud enough to paralyze humans and she is especially proud of being able to "listen to their songs".
-   _My Daemon_: While most humans are disgusted by Daemons, Kento, the main human protagonist, tends to see the beauty in them. It mostly shows in his gushing over his personal pet Daemon Anna, whom he frequently calls cute, but he also shows it towards other Daemons.
-   _No Longer Allowed in Another World_: After seeing Zuk's rampage, Sensei becomes fascinated by his fall from grace and voices his intentions of writing a novel about him, even as an unamused Zuk tries feeding him to his wolves.
-   _Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!_ gives us Yoriko Yasaka, who treats the Lovecraftian deities living in her house as normal guests, and even considers their actions adorable, mainly because their job is to protect her beloved son Mahiro (and they've saved both his and her lives already). She even gives her approval to Nyarko (Nyarlathotep)'s romantic pursuit of Mahiro. However, she makes it _very_ clear that if any lines are crossed, deities or not, the forks are coming out — and she has them scared shitless.
-   In _Reborn to Master the Blade_, most people in the world consider Prisma Beasts to be horrifically powerful, possibly country-destroying threats that need to be feared and fled from while the Knights destroy them with extreme prejudice. The protagonist, Inglis, _delights_ in seeing them, because she lives for fighting strong things and enjoys life-or-death battles. Special mention to the Frozen Prisma Beast: it's meant to inspire fear and humility in the Knights that see it, showing them the weight of their sacred duty. Meanwhile, Inglis treats it like the star attraction in a museum and can't stop smiling at it.
-   In _Overlord (2012)_, Ainz gets this reaction a few times.
    -   After being subjugated, the Lizardmen begin to revere Ainz as a god.
    -   Fluder Paradyne drops to his knees and weeps Tears of Joy when his Aura Vision shows him Ainz' immense magical power.
    -   When Ainz summons the Dark Young to massacre the Kingdom's army, most of the Empire's knights are terrified and eventually flee in panic. A few of them stay still however, utterly mesmerized by the sight of such power.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Incredible Hulk_: In _Totally Awesome Hulk_, Lady Hellbender is a Collector of the Strange who is upset that the heroes have shrunk down the various Kaiju they've defeated. She is also in complete awe of Fin Fang Foom (a massive, evil dragon) when it appears and wants to add it to her collection. And once the Hulk proves himself to be as strong as he boasts he is? She immediately captures him and tries to take him away.
-   _Marvel Adventures_: Doctor Strange has one of these moments in one title. ("Such _magnificent_ power. It could destroy us at _whim_.")
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_: In an early issue, Fluttershy watches a fierce battle between a chupacabra and some vampiric jackelopes, commenting "Nature is so fascinating..." while her friends react with disgust. It quickly obtained memetic status, with people combining it with all kinds of strange and abhorrent nature facts.
-   _The Punisher_: _The Punisher MAX_ features Lt. Wood, a Delta Force officer tasked with bringing the Punisher in. He openly admires his ruthless vigilantism, even quoting the below _Alien_ line. Maybe...
    
    **Other Delta soldier:** ...You serious?  
    **Lt. Wood:** Jesus, I hope not.
    
-   _Sin City_: Manute worships his mistress Ava Lord as a goddess precisely _because_ she's such a cold-blooded manipulative sociopath.
-   _Tintin_: In _The Shooting Star_, Prof. Phostle is excited about the upcoming end-of-the-world meteor, saying such absurdities as "It will destroy the world tonight. Tomorrow, everyone will know my name for discovering it!"
-   _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_:
    -   Resident Heroic Comedic Sociopath Whirl's reaction when he eventually encounters his Arch-Enemy Killmaster is a mixture of terror (because despite his claims earlier in the comic he's never actually _beaten_ Killmaster) and a vaguely disconcerting respect for one of the few people in the universe more of a Blood Knight than Whirl himself.
    -   Froid's downfall into full-time a Psycho Psychologist involved his fascination with Sunder, a depraved Serial Killer with a taste for Mind Rape.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: In this _Godzilla_ MonsterVerse fanfiction, Titans evoke awe and reverence in a lot of humans at Monarch like in canon. Monster X, following its second Metamorphosis in Chapter 8, is no exception.
-   _Bring Me to Life_: Discussed when Angel reflects that Dark Willow's flaying Warren Mears alive is an act that Angelus would have truly admired.
-   _The Chaotic Masters_: When Baron Von Steamer bursts into Fred's Bro-Trillion, Entraptra is more focused on gushing over his drill and other steampunk technology than the fact that he's attacking the party.
-   _Child of the Storm_: When the Winter Soldier first shows up, practically everyone in the HYDRA/Death Eater alliance is scared silent... except for Gravemoss, who practically _squees_.
-   _Code Geass: Paladins of Voltron_: From the Britannians' point of view, Lloyd Asplund regarding the Lions and Voltron. First from when he sees the Blue Lion, he’s described as having stars in his eyes, and then later on, he has a major Nerdgasm complete with hearts in his eyes when he sees Voltron in all of his glory.
    
    **Lloyd:** This-This is-! I can't even-! OOOoooOOOoooOOHHHH! This is amazing! I never thought I'd see such a thing in my entire life!
    
-   _Code Prime_:
    -   Lloyd Asplund can barely contain his enthusiasm whenever he’s in the presence of a Cybertronian. Regardless if they're Autobots, who Britannia is at war with, or Decepticons, who Britannia is “allied” with. He's also fascinated with the Spark Extractor in _R2_, prompting Jazz to ask Cecile how she puts up with him on a regular basis.
    -   In the _R2_ chapter _Ghosts_, Dr. Arkeville is the only human who is not horrified by the Driller. While Bartley is frightened out of his mind when Shockwave brings it to the Geass Order and lets it roam around freely, Arkeville meanwhile calls it beautiful.
    -   In the Epilogue of _R2_ Shamna meets with Predaking, and immediately deduces that he’s an intelligent being, and not a mindless beast as everyone else believes. When Predaking transforms into his cybertronian form, Shamna calls him incredibe.
-   _Common Interests_: A mother Pendragon shows up to reclaim the baby Harry and his friends hatched from a stolen egg they found.

-   In _The Contract and the Guide_ Harry refers to Snape's Dark Mark as a "magnificent piece of magic" shortly before removing it.
-   _A Devil Amongst Worms_: Makima certainly has this reaction when she sees the entities during Lung's second Trigger Event, calling them marvelous.
-   _FFS, I Believe in You_: Lightning being as deadly as it is to the zora, Farosh the lightning dragon is quite easily the most dangerous being alive insofar as they're concerned. Despite this, Sidon can't help but be entranced by the dragon's terrible beauty when seeing it for the first time.
    
    _Lightning had always been terrifying to him. The threat of the lynel's shock arrows. Lizalfos raids on his people. Lightning storms. Pain. Death. Every instance he had seen electricity used before had been terrifying. As Farosh twisted and twirled through the wind, however, dancing among its dreadful power, Sidon found himself entranced._
    
-   _A Growing Fire In My Heart_: Downplayed example that crosses with Distracted by the Sexy. When Ember sees Spike's gigantic rampaging form, brought about by a magical potion that was forced on him, she can't help finding him both intimidating _and_ a bit handsome. She briefly wonders if this is close to what Spike will look like in a few hundred years as he grows up naturally, but quickly pushes those thoughts aside, focusing on saving Spike first.
-   _It's Always The Quiet Ones_: Luna thinks the Wrackspurts are kind of cute, when they terrify the living daylights out of everyone else, to put it mildly.

-   _Shadows over Meridian_: As Jade's Oni wrath towards Vera reaches its peak in the Stone Nest, she summons a tornado of shadows and opens massive portals to the Shadow Realm, with the intention of burying Vera in its deepest depths. Everyone present is scared – except for Tyrian, who's practically swooning over the sight of his goddess' might and her realm.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Jonny Quest vs. the Cyber Insects_, Zin spends an awful lot of time caressing the glass of the tank the first Assassinoid grows in, and seems to really find his insectoid creations in general to be things of beauty, particularly the Formicoids and Hymenoptoids, describing them in glowing terms as "fearless and devoted warriors" and "my loyal friends."

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Several in the _Alien_ movies.
    -   In _Alien_, science officer Ash acts like this toward the title creature.
        
        **Ash:** The perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.  
        **Lambert:** You admire it.  
        **Ash:** I admire its purity.
        
    -   Bishop displays this sort of behavior in _Aliens_ when studying a Facehugger carcass, implying that he'll turn bad by drawing parallels to how Ash, the _other_ synthetic person that once came into contact with the Aliens, reacted to the creature. It's a Red Herring; Bishop remains a good guy.
    -   _Alien: Resurrection_:
        -   Dr. Gediman admires the Newborn, as well as the normal Aliens.
        -   Ripley 8 has an odd fascination with the Xenomorphs as well due to being a hybrid clone.
    -   The comics are no better, either. Every single villain is quite willing to escalate from waxing poetic about the Xenos to have many people killed in order to admire the Alien's complete lack of pity as they kill. It is somewhat implied that this is one of the side effects of the Xenomorphs' innate psionic capabilities, but many of them were also established to be sociopathic bastards beforehand.
    -   _Alien: Covenant_: David and one of the Neomorphs have a _very_ creepy moment where David attempts to communicate and stand in awe of it even though he just saw it brutally kill someone. He is _furious_ when Oram shoots it dead, showing that he cares more about the dangerous organisms than he does about humans, which is later revealed to be in part because he indirectly _created_ said dangerous organisms through his twisted experiments and genocidal actions.
-   In _Devil Girl from Mars_: when Nyah unleashes her giant robot and gives a demonstration of its powers, everybody runs away, but Prof. Hennessey hesitates before doing so as he is clearly fascinated by the mechanical monster.
-   _The Fly (1986)_ has a unique example: Seth Brundle, a brilliant scientist, comes to see **himself** in this manner as his inexorable mutation into a fly-human hybrid continues and grows progressively more gruesome. He shows off his ability to Wall Crawl to his despairing lover, dubs what he's becoming "Brundlefly", and stores many of the body parts that are decaying and falling off of him in his medicine cabinet, aka "The Brundle Museum of Natural History". After all, he _is_ becoming something that's never existed before. "Don't you think that's worth a Nobel Prize or two?" It's something of a Gallows Humor coping mechanism for him, as he knows that the transformation is ultimately a sort of terminal illness that's slowly robbing him of his humanity, and unable to be reversed.
-   In the film and the Expanded Universe material, Ray Stantz of the _Ghostbusters_ gets boyishly excited by a lot of the weird, gross, terrifying stuff they encounter.
-   _Glass (2019)_: When Joseph reveals to Kevin that Elijah indirectly killed Kevin's father in the Eastrail 177 train incident, all Elijah can do is marvel at the Beast's creation, despite the latter being an inch from killing him in retaliation.
    
    _"It's all evidence, you see? If that train crash hadn't happened, Kevin wouldn't have been left alone with his mother. If Kevin's mother wasn't allowed to continue to abuse him, then The Beast wouldn't have had to be born. What are the odds that David Dunn and Clarence Wendell Crumb would be together that day? Amazing! I created you as I created David. It just took longer: 19 years. They almost convinced me I was crazy! I create superheroes. I truly am... **a mastermind**."_
    
-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_: In contrast with everyone else's sheer horror, Saruman seems almost fascinated when he sees Sauron's spirit fully manifest in Dol Guldur. It's hinted that this moment will lead to his fall.
-   In _The Incredible Hulk (2008)_, Dr. Samuel Sterns becomes enamored of the power and potential of Bruce Banner's mutation, in spite of the danger. Rather humorously, the actual Abomination (the character) he's quite terrified of.
-   Matt Hooper in _Jaws_ when he talks about the shark: "...what we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution." There are many quick lines like this in the boat with both Hooper and Quint marveling at this particular shark's incredible strength, tenacity, intelligence, and unpredictability.
-   _Jurassic Park_:
    -   Muldoon from _Jurassic Park_ sees the _Velociraptors_ as Worthy Opponents, to the point his last words are complimenting them for sneaking up on him.
        
        **Muldoon:** Clever girl.
        
    -   In _Jurassic World_, Simon Masrani is both terrified and captivated by the _Indominus rex_. And although Hoskins sees Owen's _Velociraptors_ as mere tools of war, he's also shown to be rather awe-inspired by them. He tentatively asks Barry if he can touch a restrained Delta, which he does with all the jittery excitement of a little boy.
        
        **Claire:** Think it'll scare the kids?  
        **Masrani:** The kids? This'll give the parents nightmares.  
        **Claire:** Is that... good?  
        **Masrani:** It's _fantastic._
        
-   In _Komodo_, Oates expresses admiration for the komodos, calling them beautiful animals from a scientific standpoint.
-   _Pacific Rim_:
    -   Dr. Newton Geizsler has an absorbing love for Kaiju as biological masterpieces. So gushing is his admiration that he refers to a Kaiju as "twenty-five hundred tons of awesome" in front of a Jaeger pilot whose brother, as Newt is well aware, was _killed by a Kaiju_. His lab partner, Dr. Hermann Gottlieb, refers to Newt as a "Kaiju groupie", implying his attitude isn't actually that uncommon.
    -   There's also at least one cult who worship the Kaiju, even making their temple inside one's skull. They believe that the Kaiju are The Scourge of God sent to punish them for their sins.
    -   In _Pacific Rim: Uprising_, the Kaiju-worshipping cult has grown large enough to stage a rather nasty demonstration at PPDC Headquarters, and Newt has a kaiju brain in his room that he treats like a girlfriend and drifts with on a regular basis, leading to the Precursors controlling his mind and making him nearly destroy the world.
-   _Pitch Black_: Upon seeing the huge swarms of vicious night-dwelling flying monsters emerging from underground, Riddick can only whisper: "Beautiful".
-   Keyes in _Predator 2_:
    
    **Harrigan:** You admire the damn thing.  
    **Keyes:** Not for what it _does_, Harrigan. For what it _is_. For what we can learn from it.
    
    -   When Bracket first sees one in _The Predator_ she is enthralled by the chance to study it, prompting a flip on a line from the first film.
    
    **Bracket:** You are one _beautiful_ motherfucker.
    
-   Mr. Robinson in _Predestination_ speaks kindly of the terrorist called the Fizzle Bomber and how he helped their organization become better at saving lives. Lampshaded by The Barkeeper: "You sound as if you admire him".
-   _Se7en_: Calling it admiration is a bit of a stretch, but Detective Somerset does recognize that the John Doe killer is an intelligent Worthy Opponent who should be respected as such if the police are ever to succeed in catching him, unlike Detective Mills.
    
    **Somerset:** It's dismissive to call him a lunatic. Don't make that mistake.... This guy's methodical, exacting and worst of all, patient.
    
-   In _Star Trek: Nemesis_, Picard has a healthy level of respect and fear for the _very_ heavily armed Reman warbird _Scimitar_.
    
    **Picard:** She's a predator.
    
-   In _Suicide Squad (2016)_, Waller becomes fascinated about the Enchantress' ability to create an instant army by transforming regular people into monsters. You can just tell she's considering what she can do with it once it's under her control.
-   Dr. Clayton Forrester from _The War of the Worlds (1953)_ could be one of the earliest modern examples. He says of the Fighting-Machine, "This is amazing!"
-   _X-Men Film Series_:
    -   _X-Men: Days of Future Past_: This is how Bolivar Trask views the mutants.
    -   _X-Men: Apocalypse_: At the end, Apocalypse is in awe of Phoenix's powers as she vaporizes him.
    -   In _Deadpool 2_, Deadpool gushes over seeing Juggernaut as he rips Deadpool in half.
-   Dr. Okun in _Independence Day_ can barely contain his enthusiasm for the aliens' technology and anatomy.
    
    **Okum:** The last twenty-four hours have been really exciting!  
    **President Whitmore:** "Exciting"? People are dying out there! I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
    
-   _The Thing from Another World_: Dr. Carrington's attitude regarding the Thing, in a nutshell. Unfortunately, he is so astonished at seeing an actual alien that he assumes the Thing is a being with great knowledge that it could share with mankind (instead of a homicidal brute, which it actually is and all the other characters note), and pulls a number of dastardly acts in an attempt to understand it (and make contact with it).
-   _Resurrection (1999)_: Detective John Prudhomme expresses admiration about the killer's intellect to avoid detection while his more inexperienced partner is just disturbed by how insane such a person would have to be. John changes his opinion after his partner becomes another victim.
-   In _Venom (2018)_, Carlton Drake gets multiple scenes where he rambles about how great symbiotes are and how much humans kind of suck in comparison. Naturally, when Riot bonds with him, he rolls over in record time.

    Literature 

-   In the _Ciaphas Cain_ novel _Caves Of Ice_, the Omnissiah worshiping enginseer who accompanies Cain when he discovers a Necron tomb while searching the mines below the processing plant his unit's guarding can't understand why Cain wants to blow up the entrance to it and call in the navy to bomb the place into oblivion. He changes his mind after he's the only survivor of a group of "Cogboys" who entered the tomb; he eventually gleefully helps drown the tomb in promethium.
-   _Everybody Loves Large Chests_ The protagonist attracts a gaggle of of attractive women, despite being a flesh-eating mimic.
-   Dragon expert Lady Sybil has this reaction to the Noble Dragon in _Guards! Guards!_.
    
    **Sybil:** Do you realise we're very probably seeing something no-one has seen for centuries?  
    **Vimes:** Yes, it's a bloody flying alligator setting fire to my city!
    
-   In _Dracula_, according to Van Helsing, the Count "must indeed have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man: for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the forest'".
-   In _Dragon Bones_, when Ward sees a Basilisk, he admires its beauty, so fascinated that he hardly notices anything else. Luckily, _he_ is not the one about to be fed to the monster, and he does manage to avoid its gaze. A much milder example occurs when Ward sees a live dragon for the first time ... but of course, protecting dragons is his family's (woefully neglected for the past few centuries) _job_, and the dragons are benevolent, usually.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Hagrid is prone to this almost to a fault when it comes to dangerous magical animals. Basically, if he makes a point of professing that it's a very misunderstood creature, then it's probably safe to bet that you should leave the job of handling it up to him lest you lose a few body parts.
    -   The Elder Wand apparently tends to attract this level of fascination. Ollivander mentions that many wandmakers have been fascinated with the idea of studying the wand's unique properties despite its dark past and dangerous power, with Gregorovitch being one such wandmaker.
-   Britomart can't help but stand in awe at the corpse of a sinister giant slain in book 4 of _The Faerie Queene_.
-   Near the end of _The Illuminatus! Trilogy_, the main characters are captured by the Leviathan, a mountain-sized, aeons-old unicelluar life-form.
    
    **Hagbard:** Let it come closer for a while. I want to get a good close look. I've never had a chance like this before, and I may never see this creature again.  
    **Dillinger:** You'll be seeing it from the inside with that attitude.
    
-   In _Meg_, almost everyone who encounters the Megalodon has a mix of this and gut-wrenching fear. The fear usually becomes dominant since being that close to the Meg usually means it's going to try to eat you.
-   In _Momo (1973)_, when the kids play explorers in the South Pacific. The smart boy playing the professor does this with the enormous prehistoric creature threatening the ship ("schum-schum gummilastikum" in the original German text, _Teetotum elasticum_ in the English translation) and protests when the captain wants to shoot it.
-   At one point in _Otherland_, one of the heroes notes that as evil and twisted as Jongleur is, there is something magnificent about a man who's set out to defeat death itself.
-   In _President's Vampire_ Konrad flat-out admires the nauseating and Squicky effects his poisons and viruses have on people, even going as far as pausing his evil plan for a few minutes so that he can admire their effect on one unlucky visitor. He generally loves viruses, and the worse the effects, the more he appreciates them.
-   In H. P. Lovecraft's _The Shadow Over Innsmouth_, the protagonist can't help but admire the alien beauty and intricate craftsmanship of the jewelry produced by the otherwise-repellant Innsmouth people. This foreshadows not only that he is one of them, but also that, at the end of the book, he will accept and even embrace his heritage.
    
    -   Likewise, in Lovecraft's _At the Mountains of Madness_, the narrator can't help but admire and feel a certain kinship to the Elder Things:
    
    They had not been even savages—for what indeed had they done? That awful awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch—perhaps an attack by the furry, frantically barking quadrupeds, and a dazed defence against them and the equally frantic white simians with the queer wrappings and paraphernalia . . . poor Lake, poor Gedney . . . and poor Old Ones! Scientists to the last—what had they done that we would not have done in their place? God, what intelligence and persistence! What a facing of the incredible, just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things only a little less incredible! Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities, star-spawn—whatever they had been, they were men!
    
-   _The Stormlight Archive_:
    -   Shardbearers — nobles who fight in ornate Powered Armor and Soul Cutting BFSes that are believed to be holy relics — are even more dangerous than usual against soldiers who have never seen one before, because they are often tempted to just stand and stare at the awe-inspiring sight, even as they are cut down.
    -   Shallan has this reaction to the chasmfiends, house-sized crustaceans that eat humans and move far faster than should be possible. When she and Kaladin find one in the chasms, he keeps having to drag her away while she tries to get a better look at it for her sketchbook.
-   David from _The Reckoners Trilogy_ is at once an Epic-killing Reckoner and a massive Epic fanboy, frequently gushing over how cool some Epics' powers are while plotting how to assassinate them. At one point, he enthusiastically compliments an Epic on her abilities while they're fighting each other to the death, and shortly thereafter tops that by asking her for an autograph. She's... nonplussed.
    
    **Loophole:** What is _wrong_ with you?
    
-   Done by a biologist during a river cruise in The Witcher novel _Blood of Elves_. Geralt tells him to name the creature after an annoying brat that traveled with them.
    
    **Pitt:** _\[thrilled\]_ What a specimen, what a specimen. Prehensile cephalic limbs, four pairs of chelae... Strong tail-fan... Sharp claws...
    
-   In Diane Duane's _X-COM_ novel, one of the base scientists talks admiringly about the biology of the Ethereal aliens, to the point of suggesting that humans could modify their own genetics in similar ways. This is a tip-off that he's a traitor.
-   Inverted in _The Dresden Files_, as the Fallen Angel Anduriel actually admires how horribly, terribly evil its human host Nicodemus is. Most of the Fallen hosts end up being puppets to their demonic "partners", but Nicky is mostly human still because the eldritch monster he's partnered with for centuries honestly doesn't think it can do a better job.
-   In an omake chapter of _There Was No Secret Evil Fighting Organization_, a very powerful and very crazy telekinetic uses his powers to create _a new planet_, ripping the required minerals out of asteroids and kidnapping scientists to create a horde of bioengineered fantasy creatures. After much shock and disbelief, the US tentatively send a diplomatic team out to the planet, among which is Shiori Kaburagi, who (canonically) lives in Japan and was born there. The implication being that she _fought_ to get on the US team, just so she could risk her life seeing the magical stolen Frankenstein world.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Raina in _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ gives this impression. She appears to work in her incredibly unethical, extremely illegal, and very dangerous field primarily to get the opportunity to be close to and create super-beings. She's thrilled at the chance to get to talk to the Clairvoyant, even though the reason is because he just killed her predecessor, and is very disappointed when he turns out to be just a very well informed person without superpowers, especially because he doesn't share her interests.
-   _Ash vs. Evil Dead_: When Ash brings the _Necronomicon_ to occult book dealer Lionel Hawkins, the man can barely contain his glee. And when Ash comes up with his rather moronic plan to summon a demon for interrogation, Lionel is thrilled at the prospect.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Giles occasionally gets excited over the Monster of the Week. "A werewolf! One of the classics!"
        
        **Giles:** Grave robbing? That's new. Interesting.  
        **Buffy:** I _know_ you meant to say "gross and disturbing".  
        **Giles:** ...Yes, yes, yes of course. Uh, terrible thing. Must... must put a stop to it. Damn it.
        
    -   In "Bad Eggs", Tector Gorch (a vampire) makes the mistake of stopping to admire the Bezoar, thinking it's cute. It eats him.
-   The late Steve Irwin (a.k.a. _The Crocodile Hunter_) always reacted to wild animals, particularly the very dangerous ones, with a blend of respect and boyish glee. Ironically, he was killed by a creature that's largely harmless.
-   An episode of _CSI_ featured a Mad Artist Serial Killer that killed people and used rigor mortis to pose their corpses. At one point the team interrogate another artist played by Jeffrey Tambor who had met the killer at some point. While he thought the killer's regular sketches were trash, when he is shown the photos of the corpses he is in awe at their artistic value. Nevertheless, he helps them catch the killer.
-   _Doctor Who_ does this practically Once per Episode — the Doctor is sort of an intergalactic Crocodile Hunter.
    -   "The Green Death": After the Doctor kills the giant insect that the giant maggot has evolved into, he says that it's beautiful.
    -   "Robot": While battling a robot intent on killing him, the Doctor is able to disable it by putting his hat over its eyes. It suddenly stops moving, and he hubristically goes right up to it, smiling and whispering to himself, "Extraordinary. Extraordinary." Of course, this just leads to the robot karate chopping him in the neck.
    -   This is deconstructed in "Tooth and Claw", when Queen Victoria declares the Doctor to be _persona non grata_ in the British Empire due to his flippant treatment of horrible monsters.
    -   "The Girl in the Fireplace": The Doctor examines the delicate clockwork on elaborately costumed (18th Century French Versailles) killer clockwork robots, and exclaims "You are beautiful!"
    -   "Planet of the Dead": Christina gives the Doctor a What the Hell, Hero? when he expresses his admiration for the all-devouring Horde of Alien Locusts, but then admits that she's impressed too.
    -   "The Beast Below": The Doctor does this to a Space Whale _while standing in its mouth_. He even says he'd love to see the stomach, then hastily adds "but not right now".
    -   "The God Complex": The Doctor simply cannot help but sneak a glimpse of the homicidal Minotaur, even while he and his companions are hiding from it.
    -   A rare non-Doctor example in "Asylum of the Daleks": The leader of the Daleks explains that they don't simply destroy the aberrant (and therefore imperfect) Daleks because they find the hatred born of their insanity to be beautiful. When they add that perhaps one reason they haven't (yet) destroyed the Doctor is similar (they find his hatred of _them_ beautiful), he isn't amused.
    -   The Doctor sums this trope up in "Under the Lake":
        
        _"Every time I think it couldn't get more extraordinary it surprises me. It's impossible! I hate it! It's evil! It's astonishing! I want to kiss it to death."_
        

-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Cersei seems quite impressed with Gregor Clegane's killing power in Season 4 and is keen to ensure he retains it after his near death. She's also very curious about Qyburn's Mad Doctor talents, giving him the patronage the Citadel so emphatically refused, and she's obviously very pleased by the results: Ser Robert Strong.
    -   Cersei seems quite disappointed during a flashback to her teens when Maggy the Frog is an ordinary-looking woman and not a terrifying monster as described.
    -   Qyburn himself is the only member of Cersei's party not paralyzed with horror and disgust when they are presented with an active Wight as proof of the looming Zombie Apocalypse. While everyone around him is suitably terrified, he gets out of his chair and sneaks in for a closer look, as if he's just seen what he wants for his next Name-Day.
    -   Euron is one of the few people to observe the undead Gregor Clegane with admiration instead of horror.
-   _The Jeff Corwin Experience_: Jeff Corwin clearly has a lot of respect and admiration for venomous snakes and dangerous reptiles. However, despite displaying a similar level of Manchild glee, Jeff also tended to be much more cautious than Steve Irwin when it came to the overall handling of certain animals or situations.
-   A downplayed example from _Psych_, but in the Season 4 finale, Mary Lightly finally meets Mr. Yang, the infamous murderer he spent several years tracking when he accompanies Shawn and Gus to get answers out of her regarding Mr. Yin at the asylum. When she acknowledges his presence when he points out someone had to be working with her, he has this gleeful admiration on his face.
-   In _Ripper Street_, Inspector Reid's fascination with technological progress often leads him to express admiration even when said technology has been used for evil purposes. Case in point, the episode _I Need Light_ where the bad guy is exploiting the (anachronistically early) invention of the motion picture camera in order to make snuff films. Reid takes time to point out that the technology is amazing.
-   Sledge Hammer!'s glorification of violence sometimes leads him to approve of the villain's ways, played for laughs. Such as in "To Sledge, With Love":
    
    **Captain Trunk:** These animals are violent and destructive, with no respect for authority.  
    **Hammer:** Don't worry, Captain. I won't be suckered in by their virtues.
    
-   In _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode Babel, the station is afflicted by a Synthetic Plague that a Bajoran geneticist had intended to use against the Cardassians, which first afflicted victims with aphasia and then gave them a deadly fever. It was designed to be adaptable and very hard to treat, and Dr. Bashir calls it a work of genius while he's trying to find a cure.
-   On _Star Trek: Voyager_, the Doctor has a brief moment of this while examining Borg nanoprobes. "They're efficient little assimilators. One can't help but admire the workmanship."
-   Teppei from _Ultraman Mebius_ tends to burst out in admiration of any historical Monster of the Week.

    Multiple Media 

-   _Godzilla_:
    -   _Godzilla 2000_: After Godzilla wipes out both the Millennians, and Orga, Anti-Villain Katagiri, the head of CCI and main human baddie who had spent the entire movie trying to kill Godzilla (and the main human hero) just stares up at Godzilla, allowing the Monster King to kill him. Best described as both a Villainous BSoD and a Dying Moment of Awesome.
    -   _Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters_: The AniGoji trilogy, featuring one of the more villainous incarnations of Godzilla to date, sees rival Human Aliens Metphies and Galu-gu respectively express vocal awe and admiration for the God of Destruction. An interesting case, as both characters are each knowingly supporting a monster which is far more destructive than Godzilla (Ghidorah and Mechagodzilla respectively) and which they know will claim their lives at the end of their service.
    -   MonsterVerse: The Titans tend to attract awe and amazement from human characters, Monarch in particular, at least once per film, although it should be noted that this is mostly directed at benevolent Titans who are humanity's protectors rather than at the more malevolent Titans (though the latter aren't completely exempt necessarily). It should also be noted that some characters, such as Riccio in the graphic novel _Skull Island: The Birth of Kong_ and Emma Russell in _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ leave out the "Abomination" part entirely and act as something of a Psycho Supporter to the Titans which makes said characters a threat to the safety of everyone else.

    Music 

-   Tom Waits' song "Black Wings" (off of _Bone Machine_) is about an Ambiguously Human character who is extremely dangerous, and might actually be a Psychopomp in disguise.
    
    Some say they fear him  
    Others admire him
    

    Podcasts 

-   Invoked and discussed in the _The Last Podcast on the Left_ three-parter about Carl Panzram, a serial rapist and mass murderer from the early 1900s. Marcus Parks says that true-crime authors _love_ Panzram due to his Affably Evil tendencies and well-written confessions. By the end of the series, Henry Zebrowski decides that Panzram is his favorite Heavy Hitter.
-   Invoked in _Fat, French and Fabulous_, on a episode about serial killers Burke and Hare, when Janel clarifies that she is not impressed by the number of victims they killed in the space of a year, merely surprised.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Topaz dragons are deeply fascinated by the undead due to their unique relationship with entropy and negative energy, and often keep undead monsters as part of their hoards as curios.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Urza spent millenia preparing for the war against Phyrexia. But the longer he fought them, the more his methods began to emulate Phyrexia's and the more he came to admire Phyrexian technology. This eventually reached a head when he and his allies ventured into Phyrexia itself to destroy it. As they ventured deeper into Phyrexia, Urza realized that it embodied everything he ever wanted the world to be. When Urza finally entered the heart of Phyrexia, Yawgmoth asked him what he desired. Urza then betrayed his allies and everything he once fought for by bowing down to Yawgmoth, claiming that he only wished to stand by his side.
-   _Mecha Vs Kaiju_: The Cult of the Beast God reveres the giant monsters and attempts to placate them with prayer and offerings. It's a Path of Inspiration — the _real_ objects of its veneration, known only to the inner circle, are the Oni, who are pretty much the bad guys of the entire setting.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Adeptus Mechanicus have a notoriously poor record when it comes to uncovering Necron Tomb Worlds. They become awed by all the shiny, advanced technology, poke a little too far, wake the Necrons up, and die horribly.
    -   Also, radical Inqusitors tend to end up this way. Often used to highlight just how far they've fallen into heresy.
    -   One Eldar philosopher called Uthan the Perverse admired the Orks for being a culture (such as it is) that has found a way to thrive in their crapsack galaxy as, since they are simple and barbaric, they're largely happy being so and aren't bothered by the Big Questions. In contrast, he thinks his own race has already failed miserably and that humanity is also on the road to ruin.
    -   Commander Farsight of the T'au also has a fascination with the Orks, acknowledging that the Orks' own love of battle is not that different from his own.

    Video Games 

-   The Amazons in _Age of Wonders: Planetfall_ lean towards this trope. For them, it's not enough to use genetic engineering to breed a bloodthirsty Tyrannodon from the ground up. It's not enough to tame that Tyrannodon and ride it to war. Clearly, it is necessary to also outfit said Tyrannodon with laser cannons.
-   In the Alien Campaign of _Aliens vs. Predator (2010)_, your character, Specimen 6, is saved at birth by Weyland when she shows special intelligence in dodging the traps for the chestbursters. And once more at the end of the Alien Campaign, Six is captured rather than killed due to the 6 brand on her forehead.
    -   Karl Weyland also states in an audio log that he seeks to be more like the Xenomorphs, admiring their adaptability and survival adaptions.
-   In _Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain_, when Kain comes across the mutants in Dark Eden, while he finds the sight of them horrifying, he admits to having some admiration for the mind that created them.
-   _Crysis 2_ has Jacob Hargreave admiring the Ceph bioweapon currently _decimating humanity_:
    
    **Hargreave:** Cleaning up — it's ingenious, isn't it. Think of the Argentine Cattle Crisis two years ago. Or the British BSE outbreak in the last century. The issue was not slaughtering the animals, that was easily done. The problem was disposal. What do you do with the millions of rotting corpses? Well, there you see the answer the Ceph have evolved. They wipe us out, they break us down, they reduce the environmental impact almost to zero. _Exemplary_.
    
-   General Castor of _Dawn of War 2: Retribution_ openly admires the Tyranid Hive Tyrant, mostly because its head will look perfect on his trophy wall.
    
    **Castor:** Aim low.
    
-   While she's not studying a monster per se, Merrill in _Dragon Age II_ has a moment in the Legacy DLC where she expresses fascination over the magical powers of an altar dedicated to the Old God Dumat. Keep in mind that Merrill is a Dalish elf and the Old Gods were the deities of the Tevinter Imperium, which, according to legend, once crushed the elven civilization of Arlathan and turned them into slaves.
-   In _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, Iron Bull reveals that the Qunari revere dragons for their power and believe that their horns are due to the Qunari having some kind of connection to dragons. At the same time, the Qunari do not hesitate to slay dragons because they embody raw chaotic fury, and the Qun abhors chaos. Bringing Iron Bull with you to fight high dragons is one way to gain approval from him.
-   _EarthBound (1994)_ : Pokey Minch speaks highly of the universal cosmic destroyer Giygas, and eventually becomes his right-hand man. This admiration is short-lived, however, as he pulls the plug on the machine sustaining Giygas's mind and proceeds to call him an "almighty idiot."
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   In _Morrowind_, Mages Guild Master Wizard Skink-in-Tree's-Shade offers a quest in which he asks you to trap the soul of an Ash Ghoul for study. Additionally, he offers several quests related to vampires. While not quite a Nightmare Fetishist, he does have a healthy respect for these creatures.
    -   Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge, in _Skyrim_ practically lures the player into believing this towards him. Sure he's shifty, malevolent, and downright creepy, but in the end he helps you like a best friend.
-   _Escape from Butcher Bay_: After Riddick bombs the elevator a couple of guards are escorting him in, it crashes into a deep, subterranean part of the planetoid inhabited by large and extremely vicious creatures. Both guards only have the torches mounted on their weapons to see with, while Riddick can, of course, see everything with his eye shine. When one of the guards is effortlessly grabbed and ripped limb from limb by one of the monsters, Riddick simply murmurs "beautiful..." in an awestruck manner.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Attack of Darkforce_: Dr. Belhem is in deep admiration of the Bem species. They are an extraterrestrial organism that propagates by assimilating other organisms and slaughtering non-infected members of the host specie. There is already an outbreak of them in Europe, leaving ghost towns behind as their numbers grow. Dr. Belhem has the dangerous idea that the Bem hold the key to human development and always speaks in excitement about how they can shape the future of humanity. You'd think this would make him a clear cut Face–Heel Turn candidate. It doesn't.
-   In _God of War III_, Aphrodite and her handmaidens react this way to Kratos, who has been in a god-slaying rampage across Mount Olympus, yet the look on their faces upon seeing them with Aphrodite proceeding to invite him into her bed.
-   _Ghostbusters: The Video Game_ has Egon admiring Ivo Shandor's work from time to time. He's quick to add that he was completely evil. Ray reminds Egon to "stick to the Light Side." "It's hard."
-   _Mass Effect_ has both Liara and Shiala expressing regret over the destruction of the Thorian as it was an unique and ancient life-form.
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_, The Illusive Man wants you to preserve the Collector Base for Cerberus, in order to study its technology. A base that was liquefying kidnapped humans to turn into a Reaper. One of your followup dialogue options reads 'This place is an abomination'.
    -   Much later, in _Mass Effect 3_ Garrus explains to a handy crewman how perfect the Reapers are as Eldritch Abomination killing machines. When the crewman is horrified, Garrus adds that if you can't respect your enemy's strengths, you'll never truly understand them.
        -   Similarly, the turian primarch remarks to Shepard that the soldier in him admires the Reapers' proficiency at warfare (in particular, that they're better at turian tactics than the turians are). The turian in him knows he's watching the death of 14,000 years of civilization.
    -   Most of Paragon Shepard's teammates repeatedly think that they must have gone off their rocker, since Shepard seems to have a consistant need to seek out, befriend and then earn the loyalty of every ridiculously scary alien race in the Galaxy. Highlights include having a _Geth_ wearing part of Shepard's former armour as a tribute to them, having an Odd Friendship with the _Rachni_ Queen and semi-adopting a teenage _Krogan_.
    -   Inverted with the Reapers, who freely acknowledge that they have come to admire Shepard's uncanny knack of being able to repeatedly thwart them. In the second game, after Shepard was temporarily killed, the Reapers even ordered that Collectors to try to retrieve their body for study, simply because they couldn't fathom how a _single human_ could be so utterly _dangerous!_
        
        **Harbinger:** Shepard! You have become an _annoyance!_
        
    -   A more straightforward inversion comes in the form of the Leviathans, an Eldritch Abomination race that admires Shepard for being the first thing in any cycle to scare the Reapers. It is due to this that they agree to help them in this cycle.
    -   _Mass Effect: Andromeda:_ A logical Ryder will express admiration for the kett's intelligence, drive and hard work, while also acknowledging that everything about it is horrible, as does Dr. T'pero.
    -   Peebee's reaction to first seeing the thirty-foot high robotic killing machine that is a Remnant Architect? Gasping in awe and calling it beautiful.
-   _Monster Hunter 4_ and _4 Ultimate_ has the Guildmarm, who crushes hard on monsters. She especially treats the Brachydios as if it was the man of her dreams.
    
    **Guildmarm:** "Those strong arms! That explosive personality! And he's right there in the Volcanic Hollow...Oh, I could faint! Be a dear, Doodle, and give him a wink for me, okay?"
    
-   In _Octopath Traveler II_, Pom seems to be the _only_ resident of Crackridge who isn't terrified of Tera, the monster dwelling beneath the town. He actually tells Ochette how to find it, and even asks to come with her so he can see it for himself.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Cynthia, from _Pokémon Diamond and Pearl_, loves learning and teaching new facts about the Creation Trio. Especially Giratina.
    -   Iris in _Pokémon Black and White_ thinks Cynthia's Garchomp — a fearsome Landshark and pseudo-legendary pokémon — is 'the cutest thing'. She probably has that opinion about any strong Dragon type, though.
    -   Nemona in _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_ gushes over the Great Tusk/Iron Treads (a giant, prehistoric version of Donphan, or its robotic future counterpart, respectively) you fight in Area Zero when everyone else was startled by its appearance. She also runs off to explore Area Zero (which is said to be extremely dangerous) while everyone else is hanging back and talking, and she comes back saying how awesome it is.
    -   Kieran from the _Teal Mask_ DLC in _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_ idolizes the ogre that the rest of his village shuns. They see it as a vicious monster that attacked three innocent Pokémon; Kieran think's it's cool for being strong and independent. Ogerpon is much less of an "abomination" than the villagers thought... though Kieran's reasons for admiring her _also_ turn out to be a bit off.
-   _Shadowrun Returns_:
    -   Blitz in _Dragonfall_ is downright _impressed_ by the MKVI, a massively cyber-modified troll that's had its sentience and humanity surgically removed by all the chrome and wants you to keep it. All your other party members are disgusted and want it dead.
    -   Racter in _Shadowrun: Hong Kong_ is utterly awestruck by the sight of the Yama King, Quian Ya, and can only marvel at how magnificent the Queen of a Thousand Teeth is. This coming from a guy who's utterly terrified of the Triad boss you spend the whole campaign working for.
-   Inverted in _Super Robot Wars X_. Mazinger ZERO, the Eldritch Abomination, admires Wing Gundam Zero enough to call it an epitome of "design sophistication."
-   From _Warframe_, a good portion of Earth's content revolves around Councilor Vay Hek and his Grineer soldiers attempting to conquer a region known as the Plains of Eidolon. Unfortunately for them, one of the many difficulties of occupying the region are the Eidolon creatures that haunt the area at night. Upon seeing the terrible might of an Eidolon Teralyst for the first time as it slaughters his soldiers:
    
    **Vay Hek:** "It's... beautiful... it's so beautiful... **KILL IT**."
    
-   _World of Warcraft_: During her Warbringer cinematic, Azshara met with the Old God N'zoth and was shown a vision of the Black Empire which one dominated Azeroth. Where most mortals are driven insane on seeing a glimpse of the Empire, Azshara's response was a stunned "Magnificent". She repeats this admiring word later when she sees that N'zoth has agreed to her deal and transformed her people into the naga.

    Webcomics 

-   The Heavy of _Archipelago_, captain Snow, tends to react to all sorts of half-intelligent killing machines with Squee (pictured).
-   _Curse Quest_: An owl-bear hybrid (ulvorn) attacks Walrus, and Avalon seems to be excited to see the fight. After the Owl Hunter kills the ulvorn, Avalon can visibly be seen crying. In a similar fashion he cheers on the ulvorn creatures at the end of the chapter that fight Mogarth.
-   _Girl Genius_: Sparks are known to do things like open city gates so they can take a closer look at the enemy war machines/mutants/etc. that are attacking them at the time.
-   _The Glass Scientists_' main character admires all forms of abominations, be it zombie dogs or werewolves and crusades to make others see them the same way he does, even succeeding at times.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: The Knights Belligerent are Blood Knights in a very literal sense, with a creed that contains phrases like "Let us cut God to see if he bleeds!" Upon encountering the effectively immortal Omnicidal Maniac Jagganoth and basically finding out that the answer to the aforementioned question is _no, and fuck you_, their reaction was to start worshipping him.
-   _Lovely Lovecraft_: Noyes calls the shoggoth trapped at Miskatonic a "glorious beast."
-   _Pixie and Brutus_: Pixie befriends a spider after complementing its web.
-   In _Skin Horse_, when Sweetheart describes the Necropolis to her teammates and Officially Not a Mad Scientist Virginia Lee:
    
    **Sweetheart:** Over the decades, various zombie plagues have spread there, producing its current population of over one million undead. It's an empire of flesh-eating horrors. Any questions?  
    **Dr Lee:** Are all the pathogens biological or has nanotech been introduced? What happens when plagues interact? Have new strains evolved?  
    **Sweetheart:** Do that thing again where you convince us you're not mad.
    
-   _Unsounded_: Ruck is intrigued and enamored over some of the darker interests of the Black Tongues, like Bastion's necromancy, despite Duane being a walking corpse, and Delicieu's First Silver weapon.
-   From _xkcd_: Okay, never mind, what's wrong with scientists is that you _do_ see wonder and beauty in everything. Oh god, it's _moving!_
    -   Randall also posits that a physicist's level of interest in something acts as a handy indicator of whether you should stand near it.

-   When the _Game Grumps_ play the _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ SNES Licensed Game and catch sight of Eye Guy:
    
    **Jon:** _**OOOOOOOOOOOH! EW! EWWWWW! TUMOR-ASS EYE DUDE!**_  
    **Arin:** Aw, that's cute!
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Amphibia_: In "Froggy Little Christmas", the I.T. Gals' response to Andrias' drone turning a giant Santa float into an actual, hostile robot is to thoroughly _geek out_, and they need to be reminded to start driving for their lives when the robot targets their float.
-   _Arcane_: Silco's first office has a glass wall that shows large aquatic beasts swimming around; Deckard calls them monsters while he considers them beautiful. He also has quite a bit of interest in Shimmer, often admiring the liquid when holding it.
-   Not an _abomination_ per se, but Hank Pym gets distracted by all the cool things that Simon Williams can do during their fight in _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_.
    
    **Hank:** You were able to expand the ionic energy! _That's amazing!_
    
-   A Running Gag on _Kim Possible_.
    
    **Ron:** That would be so cool if it wasn't going to hurt us.
    
-   From _South Park_: Cartman only works with Cthulhu because of his ability to strike terror and misery into people he hates... and his friends. Actually, it's implied that _Cthulhu_ is the one admiring _Cartman_.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_:
    -   When Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Luminara are captured by Genosian zombies and about to be mind-controlled by brain slugs, Obi-Wan is far too interested in the process.
        
        **Obi-Wan:** No, wait, I want to see how it works!  
        **Anakin:** I don't think Luminara wants to see how it works.  
        **Luminara:** No, I don't.  
        **Obi-Wan:** I'm curious. The more we know, the better!  
        **Luminara:** _\[recoiling as the worm is brought to her\]_ I disagree!  
        **Anakin:** So do I.  
        **Obi-Wan:** Come now, the ear or the nose? Which will it enter?  
        **Anakin:** _\[sigh\]_ I'd say the nose.
        
    -   Captain Tarkin admires the design of the Citadel, a brutal Separatist maximum-security prison, even as the Jedi are helping him escape from it. Ahsoka calls him out on it, but Anakin concedes that he has a point.
    -   Maul hates and fears Sidious, but once Order 66 is issued, and he realizes the full scope to which his master manipulated the war, he can't help but acknowledge the genius of the old man.
        
        **Maul**: (giggling madly) Brilliant! Brilliant! I was not privy to my master's plan, but now I see it! He turned the Jedi's own army against them!
        
-   When Captain Rex gets his first look at an AT-AT in _Star Wars Rebels_, he takes a moment to admire its combat capabilities before Ezra reminds him that three of them _are_ on the attack.
    
    **Rex:** Huh. Reinforced armor plating, heavy cannons, and anti-personnel blasters. Hmm.  
    **Ezra:** I'm glad you guys are so excited, but those giant death machines are on their way to blow us to bits!
    
-   _Steven Universe_: In "Alone at Sea", Jasper points out that Lapis' treatment of her was quite inhumane, though since Jasper only appreciated strength, she actually _admires_ it.
    
    **Jasper:** _\[to Lapis\]_ I thought _I_ was a brute, but _you_... you're a _monster._
    
-   From _Turtles Forever_: The original animated incarnation of the Shredder absolutely _gushes_ with unrestrained admiration as he watches a video file on the much more powerful and deadly Utrom Shredder, Ch'rell, from the then-current version of TMNT. Then he actually gets to _meet_ Ch'rell. Let's just say it doesn't bode well for 1987 Shredder. In fact, by the end of the movie, it's not good for every single existing universe within the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle multiverse.
-   The _Ultimate Spider-Man (2012)_ incarnation of Norman Osborn is in awe when seeing his son turning into Venom and trying to kill him.

    Real Life 

-   Biologists LOVE finding new and creepy things. They also love finding OLD and creepy things. This is not an attractive fish. This is not an alien. It is a squid. This is not a xenomorph, it is a shark with detachable jaws.
    -   It is fun to go on a walk with a group of biologists. If someone mentions that there's a _really_ big spider in that bush over there, everyone will come running and admire it — about the opposite of the reaction you get from the average person.
    -   Many biologists would freely admit that they were inspired by monster movies like _Jaws_ or _Jurassic Park_ to partake in these fields of science. While some would lament on the scientific inaccuracies of the films, especially if it leads to public hysteria against the actual animal like _Jaws_ did with sharks, they still acknowledge that the films did inspire them to learn more about the real deal.
-   Winston Churchill had this attitude towards Adolf Hitler for his role in Germany's economic recovery.
-   Storm chasers can often do this (and it's even gotten the derisory nicknames "stormgasm" and "tornadogasm" from their almost-orgasmic sounds on seeing a tornado). The reason for it is from the storm chaser's perspective is that they have invested time, money, and more into getting the perfect video of a tornado + the adrenaline rush of seeing one, especially a historic one = this reaction. Unfortunately, however, it's often taken for/seen as self-indulgent disrespect to the victims of tornadoes and severe storms, even if no disrespect is intended.
    -   Similarly, volcanologist David Johnston's last words before being killed in the eruption of Mount St. Helens— "Vancouver! This is it! This is it!" have been described as being said with as much awe and excitement as shock.
-   Expect to be looked at as if you're doing this if you like spiders, and are called upon to remove some particularly big and beautiful specimen. Especially weird if you live in Europe and there are no spider species venomous enough to really endanger humans. (Of course, a biologist may have this attitude to a real dangerous animal, too, see above.)
-   For some longtime residents of New York City, its time as the Big Rotten Apple is missed since the cost of living was lower then and the proliferation of corporate domination of its public space has robbed the city of some of its singular character.
-   Why do movie villains like Putting on the Reich? Of course it is a very easy shorthand to show how Obviously Evil they are, but there has to be some admiration for the Nazi aesthetic, even if only for the Forbidden Fruit aspects of it. Everybody knows Nazis are evil, but _damn_ those uniforms tailored by the actual Hugo Boss.
-   "Rubber-necking" while passing an accident scene can be considered this.
