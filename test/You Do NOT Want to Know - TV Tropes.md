_"Trust me on this: you don't wanna know. Audrey, don't tell him. You shouldn't've told **me**, but you did, and now I'm telling you, **you don't wanna know!**"_

Some secret about Character A is mentioned, either by the character himself, or by somebody else. When queried, someone replies "You _don't_ want to know. Just trust me on this." Or words to that effect. Whether _we_ actually find out what it is varies — if we don't, it can turn into a Noodle Incident and be left to the viewer's imagination entirely, or it might be set up for one or more un-reveals. The characters who _do_ know will usually try to avoid talking about it. More often than not, this phrase can just end up as Schmuck Bait.

In other cases, we do find out. If played for comedy, the secret will turn out to be relatively innocuous — or at least, not nearly as far-out as what the other characters — and probably the audience — have _imagined_ it might be. If played for drama (as in horror movies) it'll turn out that the secret is, indeed, quite bad, and that the others would, in fact, have been better off not knowing. Either way, this may well end in someone frantically grabbing for the nearest container of Brain Bleach.

A smart person can start to ask, and then conclude that no, they're better off not knowing. If curiosity gets the best of them, it will be followed with "I'm afraid to ask, but..."

And sometimes, it's just Too Much Information.

Other stock phrases include "I don't want to know, but at the same time, I _really_ want to know...", "That means you do _not_ want to know, trust me," and "Don't Ask."

If said by a mentor, it is likely to be an Awful Truth. If they experience enough such events, it can lead to a character who has Seen It All.

Not to be confused with These Are Things Man Was Not Meant to Know... even if, in some cases there may be some overlap. However, it can be used to invoke Nothing Is Scarier.

See also Don't Ask, Take Our Word for It, I Have My Ways. Compare Plausible Deniability, for when your sanity could probably handle it, but you still don't want to know because your legal standing maybe couldn't. Also Cassandra Truth, if you know that they won't believe it, because of cognitive dissonance.

    -   When Calvin asks if he can use gasoline to write flaming letters on the lawn so airplanes flying overhead can read it, his dad's second thought (after "_No_, you can't do that! Don't be ridiculous!") was that he didn't even want to know _what_ Calvin was going to write.
-   _Garfield_:
    
    -   In a strip, Garfield looks at the box of the cat food he's eating, and sees that it reads: "Ingredients: You're better off not knowing". He keeps on eating, thinking: "What you don't know can't hurt you, right?"

        **Garfield:** There's a gambler in the house!
        
    -   Another one involving Irma:

        _\[Jon looks at it for a minute\]_  
        **Jon:** Have an egg, Garfield.  
        **Garfield:** Too late, I already thought about it.
        
    -   In a 2012 Sunday strip, Garfield takes a Snow-Cone container outside when it is snowing. The snow then fills up in the container, until it reachers snow-cone-like levels, to Garfield's delight.

        **Liz:** Where'd he get the bucket of cherry syrup?  
        **Jon:** Some things are better left unknown...
        
    -   Jon gave Garfield some food claiming not to know what it was because the label came off the can. Garfield said sometimes that was a blessing.
    -   Jon returns from his date and tells Garfield he doesn't want to know how it went. Garfield decides this means the opposite. In the next day's strip, he tells Garfield about her nostrils. He warned him...
        
        **Garfield:** _\[to reader\]_ Make him stop.
        
    -   In one strip where Garfield, Jon, and Odie went to a restaurant while vacationing on an island, Jon asked the waiter what the only item on the menu, 'Unguah', was.

    -   At the end of a month long arc in which Garfield and Odie are lost, the pair end up in a pet shop where Jon finds them, leading to this exchange:
    
    -   Liz wonders why it takes so long for Jon to organize his sock drawer and Garfield tells her she doesn't want to know. The next panel shows Jon using two socks as puppets.
        
        **Jon:** Hello, Mr. Red Sock! Have you met Mr. Blue Sock?

        **Asuka** (sighing): _"I don't know yet. I'm hoping for a triad, I don't think I could cope with a vee if the fulcrum was someone else. And how do you even know what those words mean?"_

    **Harry:** Why not?  
    **Hermione:** Knutsack might just answer you.

    (Wedge insists, and Wes ends up giving a very accurate, very logical explanation for the girl's behavior. Then…)  
    **Wedge**: Wes, you were right.  
    **Wes**: You didn't want to know.  
    **Wedge**: I didn't want to know.
    
    -   Played for Black Comedy in the New Jedi Order novel _Rebel Stand_. A commando team is on Coruscant and learn that Emperor Palpatine had special programming put in the atmospheric processors so he could suffocate whole sections of the planet on a whim. Face Loran remarks:
    
    **Face:** Somehow, every time I learn something new about Palpatine, I wish I hadn't.
    
-   _The Outcast of Redwall_ features a hare nicknamed Jodd. His full name results in this trope, and in the end we only hear _part_ of it. According to the official website's "Ask Brian" feature, it's "Wilthurio Longbarrow Sackfirth Toxophola Fedlric Fritillary Wilfrand Hurdleframe Longarrow Leawelt Pugnacio Cinnabar Hillwether Jodrellio".
-   _The Golden Globe_ by John Varley averts Forbidden Fruit in this regard: to show that you don't want to know how Charonians have sex, you're given a description of their coming-of-age ceremony. For context, Charonians regenerate quickly and worship pain, and the ceremony itself is either Narm or Nausea Fuel.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Used in _Thud!_ when Vimes asks about the worst of dwarven signs, the Summoning Dark, and is informs he does not want to know. When he asks again, he's told that no, he really doesn't. He starts to ask again before deciding that in fact that's correct, it's mystical stuff that he doesn't believe in, and drops it.
    -   In _Going Postal_ the ancient messenger golem Anghammarad recounts his motto:
        
        **Anghammarad**: Neither Deluge Nor Ice Storm Nor The Black Silence Of The Netherhells Shall Stay These Messengers About Their Sacred Business. Do Not Ask Us About Sabre-Tooth Tigers, Tar Pits, Big Green Things With Teeth Or The Goddess Czol. \[...\]  
        **Moist**: The goddess Czol?  
        **Anghammarad**: Do Not Ask.
        
    -   The modern Ankh-Morpork post office declares that neither sleet nor snow nor gloom of night shall stay these messengers about their business, with its own "don't arsk us about" list. Mrs. Cake appears twice.
    -   The Lemony Narrator does this to the _reader_ in _Thief of Time_, when Famine talks about his love of salad cream sandwiches. A footnote advises readers from societies where the traditional condiment for salad is mayonnaise not to even ask.
    -   In _Making Money_, Moist wonders why there's a squid in the halls of Unseen University, and Dr. Hicks tells him "You don't want to know about the squid." All we know is that it's somehow a by-product of the University's studies into the Cabinet of Curiosity.
-   Subverted and inverted early on in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, when Arthur takes the precaution of asking Ford, "if I were to ask you where the hell we were, would I regret it?" Ford cuts to the chase and tells him where they are. Arthur was probably happier when he didn't know.
-   Used in a decidedly non-comedic fashion in _Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn_, when Shell-Shocked Veteran Camaris refuses to tell the protagonists about his mysterious past that led to a Heroic BSoD, on the grounds that it's too shameful. He does confess it twice, once to a priest and once to Prince Josua, and both emerge from the experience wishing they hadn't been told. At the end, it's revealed that he's Josua's father, and lived his life afterwards in misery over his weakness and the subsequent Death by Childbirth of the woman in question.
-   During a _Doctor Who_ short story, a skeleton grabs the Tenth Doctor by the ankle as it claws its way out of the earth. The Doctor, not taking his eyes off Rose, asks if he should look. She shakes her head.
-   In the _Gaunt's Ghosts_ novel _His Last Command_, Vortenhus is told that he does not want to know what a glyf - a Chaos tripwire-like _thing_, the sight of which can drive a man insane - is.
-   _The Dresden Files_
    -   In the novel _Death Masks_, Harry Dresden finds himself having a conversation with his friend Micheal's teenage daughter Molly, after escaping a situation that left him with handcuffs danging from one wrist. During their talk, Molly produces a set of handcuff keys and finds one that matches the cuffs he's wearing. When Harry asks how she got the keys, she tells him to ask himself if he really wants to know the answer to that question. Harry decides he doesn't.
    -   Repeated with the medical pinwheel thing. Apparently they have recreational uses. Molly used to hang out with a _weird_ crowd. Harry decides to not pursue that line of reasoning.
    -   In a more serious use of this trope, Harry initially keeps even his own allies Locked Out of the Loop in regards to the magical world for this very reason. After Murphy calls him out on it, specifically telling him that trust is a two-way street, he begins asking his friends if they really want to know this kind of stuff; invariably they say yes and become staunch allies.
-   In _Kushiel's Dart_, the heroine is speculating about her mentor's mysterious past, and a listener who can predict the future tells her: "You will rue the day all is made clear." The prophecy is exactly correct. However, this is not because he has a terrible secret. It's because the same day she finds it out, he is killed by assassins.
-   David and Leigh Eddings are fond of this across all of their books. The exchange usually falls to a Badass Normal character asking either a sorcerer or god how they managed to (or plan to) do something. The response is usually on par with "Do you REALLY want to know?" followed by "No, on second thought, not really".
-   Fragile and disturbed Ernst of _Dance of the Butterfly_ repeatedly takes this tact with the two detectives who question him regarding the city's serial killer.
-   In _Star Wars: Jedi Academy: The Phantom Bully_, the bully in question in the title (actually bullies, though this isn't revealed until the end) release hundreds of clones of a voorpak named Voorpee which the main protagonist Roan Novachez and his girlfriend Gaiana are performing in a talent show with. Mr. Garfield, his super-strict lightsaber instructor, thinks he's to blame and asks him "WHAT'S GOING ON, NOVACHEZ?!" to which he replies "You don't want to know."
-   _In Death_: In "Vengeance in Death", Eve asks what's in the "meat stuff" she's eating and Roarke says "You’ll thank me for not telling you".
-   In Millea Kenin's short story "Scarlet Eyes," protagonist Den-Tyren Scorry assures us that the carcass of the rooster that the Evil Sorcerer had beheaded as a sacrifice is "about the prettiest" of the things in the summoning circle.
-   In Rob O'Hara's _The Human Library_, Marvin's friend Gracie, owner of the local diner, comes out to the house she rented him to bring Marvin and his co-worker some food, only Marvin isn't there with Katie. He's there with his grandpa, whom the last time Gracie saw him was five years ago when he was buried. Marvin realizes Gracie would never believe him if he were to try to explain that the man is a clone of his late grandfather in an experiment by the government Gone Horribly Right. Worse, if he discovers he was a clone or had died, he could become psychotic. Marvin gets her attention and explains that the man's mental state is very fragile:
    
    “Well, he’s not dead, obviously. But he doesn’t remember he died. And if he finds out, bad things could happen.”  
    Gracie leaned to the side to peek around Marvin. “What kind of bad things?”  
    “Trust me. You don’t want to know.”
    
-   _Warrior Cats_: In _The Place of No Stars_, Snowtuft mentions an island where Ashfur keeps spirits prisoner. Shadowsight asks for more information, and Snowtuft responds, "You really don't want to know", refusing to say anything else on the topic. It helps build the tension and significance of one of the most important locations of the book.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The second episode of season 1 of _The Basil Brush Show_ has the cast trying to come up with ways to catch a mouse. Steven is eager to use his first plan. But it's so wacky, non-sensical and not related to the mouse, that when he asks for everyone's opinion, they just look at each other and Basil says: "You really don't want to know" Before moving to Dave.
-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   A variant was used in Season 3.
        
        **Marcus Cole**: They taught me... terror. How to use it. How to face it.  
        **Dr. Franklin**: I think I'd like to hear more about that...  
        **Marcus Cole**: No. You wouldn't.
        
    -   A straighter example in Season 4. Susan Ivanova stumbles litter-strewn out of a transport tube, using a cane to stay upright.
-   In one episode of _The Big Bang Theory_, after Leonard's mother got drunk with Penny and kissed Sheldon, she apologises to Sheldon "about her behaviour" while Leonard is present. Leonard enquires about details, but his mother, Penny, and Sheldon all answer that he doesn't want to know.
-   _Blackadder_:
    -   In an episode of _Blackaddder the Third_, a French torturer tells the soldier guarding Blackadder and Baldrick that he should leave, since what she is going to do will be so horrifying. He states his belief that he can stomach it, to the hag's increasingly frantic protests, until he asks for a description. She whispers to him, and he runs off about to vomit.
    -   Also in _Blackadder the Third_, when Prince George describes what the Naughty Hellfire Club does to people who don't pay their dues:
        
        **Prince George:** They pull your breeches down and push a large radish right up your—  
        **Blackadder:** —yes! Yes! Yes! All right!...There's no need to hammer it home.  
        **Prince George:** As a matter of fact, they do often have to—  
        **Blackadder:** —No! NO!
        
-   Used for comic effect in _Black Books_. Manny says that something bad happens to him at 88 degrees, and Bernard wants to know what, but Manny keeps repeating, "You don't want to know." Bernard at first tells Manny to stop saying that, because he wants to know even more if he's told he doesn't. Then he switches tactics, saying that Manny doesn't know WHY Bernard wants to know. To which Manny replies, "Oh, why's that?" And Bernard has made his point.
-   _Blake's 7_. In "Shadow," a Professional Killer has been ordered to kill Avon and Gan.
    
    **Enforcer:** You two, out.  
    **Avon:** Why?  
    **Enforcer:** You'd prefer not to know.  
    **Avon:** Your professional simplicity is beginning to irritate me.  
    **Enforcer:** Well think of it as a temporary problem.
    
-   _Charmed_:
    -   The Council of two Elders and two powerful demons who control the Cleaners. When asked what happens if it becomes a tie, the Sisters are told this trope.
    -   Daryl tends to use this trope on himself. Whenver he walks in on some bizarre situation, his usual response is, "I don't wanna know."
-   _Cops: L.A.C._ has a scene where a woman tells the police she thinks she's found a bomb in her house, in her daughter's chest of drawers. Graham immediately identifies the vibrating noise, much to the woman's shock.
    
    **Daniel**: How did you know it was a vibrator making that noise?  
    **Graham**: Don't ask questions you really don't want answered.
    
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Bad Wolf": This is how Jack Harkness responds when his captors demand to know how he managed to pull a concealed weapon on them despite being stripped naked.
    -   "Flesh and Stone": This is Father Octavian's response when the Doctor, after finding out that River Song is in prison for murder, asks him who she killed. It turns out that River killed the Doctor himself (but not really), so Octavian's reluctance is fully justified.
    -   In "Praxeus", Yasmin Khan wants to follow an alien through a teleport to an unknown destination. The woman's she's with is unfamilar with being the Doctor's companion, so is understandably reluctant, asking "What's the worst place we could end up?" Yaz replies, "Long list. You don't want to know." The first time Yaz was teleported she ended up in outer space where she almost suffocated to death before being rescued by a spaceship that just happened to be there; and that was only the first of her offworld adventures with the Doctor.
-   On an episode of _The Facts of Life_, Blair somehow got a bottle of wine and the girls were planning on when to drink it. Jo decided she'd rather have beer instead. When asked how she'd get it, she just said, "I'll get some beer." Later, when asked how she got it, her reply was, "I got some beer."
-   In the episode of _Friends_ where Chandler is trying to get the perfect engagement ring for Monica, it winds up getting bought and he's trying to get Phoebe to remember if the guy who picked it up mentioned where he was going. Phoebe mentions the name had something to do with "rainbow", but after some more thinking, it turns out to be some fancy French name that doesn't have anything to do with rainbows. When Chandler says he'd love to know how she managed to something get a rainbow out of that, Phoebe responds, "No you wouldn't. You don't want to get in here," as she points to her head.
    -   In another episode, Joey walks into the apartment tuxedo which causes Chandler to leap out his seat shouting "VOMIT TUX! NO, NO! VOMIT TUX!". Monica starts to ask what he's referring to, but cuts herself off mid-sentence after Joey shakes his head at her and pivots to asking why he's so dressed up instead.
-   In one episode of _Fringe_ Walter sends out Astrid to get some things for him, among them a dirty magazine and a portrait of George W. Bush.
    
    **Astrid:** I don't even want to know.
    
-   _Get Smart_ used a variation of this in Catchphrase fashion, to the point of it being a Running Gag:
    
    **Maxwell Smart:** Don't tell me _\[rest of sentence\]_  
    **Other character:** _\[repeats the rest of the sentence back to him\]_  
    **Smart:** I asked you not to tell me that.
    
-   _The Goodies_ had an episode where Graeme falls into a hole where he intends to study Neolithic Man. It is deduced that there is a ten-second delay from where he speaks to when his voice reaches the surface, leading to this exchange:
    
    **Graeme:** (_to himself_) I could do with my archaeology kit...and a bite to eat. (_loudly to the surface_) Yeah. Chuck us down my old tweed suit... oh, and a couple of donuts.  
    **Bill:** (_into hole to Graeme_) Do you want anything to eat?  
    **Graeme:** (_delayed_) Yeah. Chuck us down my old tweed suit.  
    **Tim:** (_into hole to Graeme_) Anything to wear?  
    **Graeme:** (_delayed_) Oh, a couple of donuts.  
    **Bill:** (_to Tim_) Where's he gonna wear them?  
    **Tim:** Never mind!
    
-   _Heroes_ season three demonstrates how not to do this: a character whose power is treated as a "you don't wanna know" situation turns out to be something pretty basic: your typical sonic scream thing, and not even (that we saw) to Black Bolt-esque mega-destructive levels.
    -   Said power was originally intended to be terrakinesis, on par with the Big Bad of volume five, but was cut due to budget restraints at the time.
-   Since they never bother to hide their shenanigans from Sgt Schultz, _Hogan's Heroes_ would often be found by the guard doing things they shouldn't be. After Hogan gives Schultz an obviously false excuse, he'd grin "Wanna know what we're _really_ doing?" Followed by Schultz thinking better of it. "I know nothing! I was never even here!, I never even got up this morning!"
-   _Kamen Rider Ex-Aid_ has a dramatic example. After being defeated by Kiriya, a former ally and friend resurrected by Masamune Dan, Emu has something whispered to him by the former that gets him so angry that he punches him in the face and declares him a Broken Pedestal. When Taiga asks him what was whispered to him later on, Emu replies "It's best if you don't know". Of course, this is all a ruse on both Emu and Kiriya's parts, in that Kiriya is merely pretending to work for Masamune and Emu is playing along. Kiriya was merely steathily letting him know.
-   A comedic example occurs in _Last Resort_. In "Skeleton Crew" Shepard is forced to leave King behind on an underwater buoy. She is only able to return _after_ he's run out of air, but he was able to stay alive by holding his breath. He reveals that he is still alive by tapping the buoy with Morse Code. He also includes a vulgar message to her, and she is merely told that she doesn't want to know what it means.
-   _Leverage_ has an interesting version, when it was revealed that Elliot once worked for Damien Moreau. Parker starts to ask him about what he did for Moreau that he is so ashamed of, and he tells her "Don't ask. Because if you do ask, I'm going to tell you. So don't ask."
-   Inverted in one episode of _Lois & Clark_. In an attempt to infiltrate a military base, Lois steals a jeep and some uniforms. When she meets up with Clark, he is about to ask where she got them, but then quickly decides he doesn't want to know.
-   In an episode of _Malcolm in the Middle_, Hal and a heavily pregnant Lois go to a bed and breakfast for the weekend, they send Reese to grandma Ida, Malcolm to Stevie's, and Dewey with Craig. After Reese is told that he'll be spending the weekend on the bus, since Ida lives so far away, he jumps out the bus and goes home to plan a party. When some drug dealers get wind that there won't be adult supervision, they turn the house into a meth lab and Malcolm and Reese bring Francis to help get them out, but the leader of the gang is an old friend of Francis with a lot of dirt on him, so the boys have no choice but to let them have free reign of the house. When Craig fails to get them to leave, Dewey tells on the drug dealers' mothers, and they clean up their stuff and go away. When Lois and Hal come back, Malcolm tells them that the weekend was boring but in a "fun" way, Dewey backs up Malcolm's claim, and when Craig brings Reese from "the bus station," he happily says he enjoyed his trip. Lois and Hal, who had just gotten over a massive argument at the bed and breakfast, say to themselves:
    
    **Hal:** Do you really want to know?
    
    **Lois:** Not really
    
    **Hal:** No.
    
-   _Monk_:
    -   In "Mr. Monk and the Miracle", Monk tells Natalie that her getting gravy wouldn't have been necessary as the bums, their guests, make their own gravy. When Natalie asks how they do it, Monk simply responds with "You don't want to know..."
    -   Similarly, in "Mr. Monk Is On The Run: Part 1", after Monk arrives back at Natalie's house with a strange overcoat, he said a homeless person gave it to him in exchange for something else in return. When questioned by Natalie about what that thing was that Monk had to do, Monk can only respond with "I'd rather not talk about it..."
-   In one episode of _NCIS_, Tony and Ziva are at a Burundian café investigating a double murder, and Ziva starts munching on some snacks that she says are delicious. One of the Burundians then says, "Then I won't tell you what they are made from."
-   When a couple (Bob and June Wheeler, Bob played by Brent Spiner) came into _Night Court_ who were well known for their outlandish bad luck (the squad car they were arrested in got hit by a bolt of lightning) mention that their granny died, Harry, Dan, and Christine give each other looks before Christine bursts out "Oh what the Hell _someone_ has to ask! How did she die?" They reply that she died peacefully while sleeping... on the railroad tracks.
-   _Northern Exposure_: In "The Russian Flu", Dr. Fleischman asks Marilyn what's in a foul-smelling (but effective) Native American flu remedy. Her reply: "You don't wanna know."
-   On _The Office (US)_, Dwight issues Jim a demerit for tardiness, then explains his made-up, incredibly convoluted warning system for policing the office that, as Jim points out, logically ends with Dwight submitting a disciplinary review to his immediate superior (Jim himself, the Assistant Regional Manager). Jim responds by demanding the review be on his desk by the end of the day, or Dwight will be issued a "full dissadulation." What is that? "You don't want to know."
-   _Person of Interest:_
    -   In the episode "Cura Te Ipsum"
        
        **Reese:** Doctor has everything she needs to erase Benton for good.  
        **Finch:** What do you mean, "erase"?  
        **Reese:** Eight pounds of lye, heated to 300 degrees. Body will dissolve in three hours, give or take.  
        **Finch:** I will refrain from asking how you know that.
        
    -   In "Critical", Detective Carter demands information on the mysterious forces hunting Reese. Reese points out that, unlike him and Finch, Carter is not hiding under a false name and has loved ones that are still alive. "So I think the real question you have to ask yourself, Detective... is how much more do you really want to know?"
    -   By Season 4 Detective Fusco, Team Machine's other Friend on the Force, has become smart on the matter.
        
        **Fusco:** Should I even ask?  
        **Shaw:** Really wanna know?  
        **Fusco:** Honestly? No.
        
-   _Quantum Leap (2022)_: After Ben tells Addison that he leaped to save her but can't remember the details, the project team tracks down Janis to ask her instead, since she is the only other person who knows the truth. Janis tells Addison that she _can't_ tell her the specific "what" or "why," and justifies it by saying that you can't say certain things out loud in a world that has time travel.
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   Lister opens a secure door and doesn't want Kryten to see how: "Trust me, you don't want to know!". Kryten doesn't look, but being a robot, he correctly guesses the logical answer: Lister used a severed hand from one of the dead crew on the palm print reader. What makes Kryten's realization worse is he knows Lister is using the severed hand of his(Lister) own alternate self.
        
        **Kryten:** Logically, sir, there is only one way you could possibly have opened that door. I feel quite nauseous. Where is it?  
        **Lister:** Where's what?  
        **Kryten:** Oh, _sir_!! You've got it in your _jacket_!!
        
    -   Subverted in _Thanks For The Memory_. A drunken Rimmer wants to tell Lister how many times he's made love, to which Lister replies: "I don't wanna know! Trust me, You _do not_ want to tell me!"
        -   Rimmer does, and the answer turns out to be embarrassing.
    -   In "Backwards", before they leave, Lister tells Rimmer that Cat has gone off into the bushes, then he realizes what this entails, and says, "We've got to stop him!" Cat comes back, hair sticking straight up, walking stiffly, horrified expression on his face, and simply says "Don't ask." (For those who don't recall the episode, they were on an alternate Earth where everything happened _in reverse_...)
-   _Sports Night_: In the first season episode "Thespis", Isaac is worried about his daughter having complications while giving birth on the other side of the country, and Casey goes to his office to keep him company (and for other reasons). However, Isaac did notice something during the broadcast:
    
    **Isaac**: Did a big frozen turkey fall down on the anchor desk during the last commercial?  
    **Casey**: Yes.  
    **Isaac**: Why?  
    **Casey**: Oh Isaac, is there really an answer I can give to that question that will satisfy you?  
    **Isaac**: I don't think so.  
    **Casey**: Then don't worry about it.
    
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_
    -   In "The Big Goodbye", the fate the insectoid Jarada visit upon people who pronounce their ceremonial greeting wrong is so horrible that the crew won't even let Data hint at it.
    -   In a later episode, Geordi and Riker have to fly into a sensor-blinding nebula that's full of enemy ships. They have a proximity detector but it only works at very short range, and at one point Riker has to pull an extremely sharp turn to avoid hitting something.
        
        **Geordi:** Do I want to know how close that was?  
        **Riker:** No.
        
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
    
    -   Worf is asked at a party what Klingons dream about. He may or may not be japing the questioner when he replies thus:
    
    **Worf** Things that would send cold chills down your spine, and wake you in the middle of the night. No, it is better that you do not know. Excuse me. _(shambles away)_
    
    -   In "Sacrifice of Angels", O'Brien and Bashir have been quoting "The Charge of the Light Brigade" in the runup to a battle where they're seriously outnumbered. Eventually Garak asks how it ends. O'Brien tells him he doesn't want to know...which answers the question.
    -   Klingon sex is very rough (broken bones are considered a good sign). Bashir learns this after treating Grilka and Quark. When Work and Dax come in he asks what happened. They share a look and Bashir says that he doesn't want to know, and in fact he's going to stop asking that question altogether.
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise_
    -   Captain Archer is in VERY tense negotiations with the Xindi while his linguist Lt. Sato performs simultaneous translation — except at one point, where the insectoid Xindi goes on a long chittering rant, and Sato simply says, "You don't want to know."
    -   This is the second time she uses the line. In the pilot episode, a Klingon says _something_ to Captain Archer, who takes it as a thank you. When Sato comments that she doesn't think they have a word for thank you, and Archer asks her what the Klingon _did_ say, she responds with the line verbatim.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   In the episode "What Is And What Should Never Be" (S02, Ep20), Dean tells Sam he does not want to know what is in a paper bag. When Sam pulls out a takeout container of blood from the bag, Dean meets Sam's inquiry about the purpose of the blood by again telling Sam he does not want to know.
    -   In "No Rest For The Wicked" Ruby tells Sam Lilith is on "shore leave". When he asks what that means, she replies with this. We then see what she means...and Ruby's right.
    -   Again in "When the Levee Breaks", Ruby tells Sam Lilith keeps a personal chef. When he asks what's she's eating, she replies with this, for good reasons.
-   Inversion in _Teen Wolf_: Sheriff Stalinski walks in on his son fastening restraints onto a teenage girl. He flat-out states that he doesn't even want to know.
-   _That Mitchell and Webb Look_ has a sketch involving a real estate agent advising a woman who he learns is a counselor for torture survivors. He gleefully presses her for details on the worst thing that's happened to one of her patients, despite her and her husband warning him not to. He comes to regret not taking their advice.
    
    **Counsellor:** Look, you really don't want to know.  
    **Estate Agent:** I do!  
    **Husband:** No, you _don't._  
    **Estate Agent:** I do! I really do! Oh, come on, how bad can it be?
    
-   _The Wire_: After Bird is convicted of murdering Gant because Omar lied on the stand about having witnessed the killing, McNulty asks Omar if he really did see Bird kill the man. "You really askin'?", Omar replies.

    Puppet Shows 

-   On the Raquel Welch episode of _The Muppet Show_, Marvin Suggs reveals to Kermit that he has to replace his living musical instruments, the Muppaphones, when they go flat (like little pancakes). What happens to them then? Well... At one point, he actually _was_ the replacement... turns out that singing the Witch Doctor song when you've been told never to tell anyone is a bad idea.

    Roleplay 

-   _Destroy the Godmodder_: This is often used when players question facets of the Godmodder's past.
    -   A single, comprehensive backstory was given for the Godmodder in DTG2. It answered pretty much none of the questions that had been asked.

    Theatre 

-   Macbeth keeps asking questions that he _really_ doesn't want to know the answers to.
    
    **Macbeth:**
    
    Yet my heart
    
    Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
    
    Can tell me so much, shall Banquo's issue ever
    
    Reign in this kingdom?
    
    **All Witches:** Seek to know no more!
    

-   About 80% of _Oedipus the King_ is this trope. Oedipus wants to know why his kingdom is dying, without having any idea that it's his own fault. The reason ''why'' it's his fault is, of course, horrifying enough to result in him putting out his own eyes.

    Theme Parks 

-   In _Terminator 2 3-D: Battle Across Time_ at Universal Studios, the T-800 says this exactly to John when he asks why they're headed _toward_ Skynet headquarters.

-   In _Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne,_ Illidan uses this line on Malfurion.
    
    **Malfurion**: _They \[Illidan's naga\] had best return with good news. The very sight of them makes my stomach turn. Where did you ever find such loathsome creatures?_  
    **Illidan**: _Believe me, brother: You don't want to know._
    
-   _Tales of Symphonia_ take after Raine disappears into the Iselia shrine:
    
    **Raine**: \*Evil Laugh\*  
    **Lloyd**: What was that about?  
    **Genis**: You're better off not knowing...
    
-   Players of _Knights of the Old Republic_ are treated to this little exchange on Dantooine:
    
    **C8-42:** I'm afraid my owner became a bit too attached to me. Obsessed even. She... she tried to treat me as her dead husband. It was not healthy for her.  
    **Player:** Er... ALL the time?  
    **C8-42:** You don't want to know...  
    **Player:** Um... probably not...
    
-   _Persona 3_:
    
    **Mitsuru**: Oh, Mr. Ekoda’s punishment...? Well, there are some things in life you don’t want to know about... This is one of them.
    
    -   Same applies to Mitsuru's "Execution."
-   Played seriously in _Persona 5_. While the group explores Kunikazu Okumura's Palace, Haru, Kunikazu's daughter, asks why they haven't run into a cognitive version of her (in other words, a representation of how her father sees her). Morgana says that he can think of a few possible reasons, but Haru wouldn't want to hear them. While this is not brought to a conclusion in Vanilla, _Royal_ does show a Cognitive Haru and, as predicted, the real Haru doesn't like it one bit. Haru in Okumura's eyes is nothing more than another one of his robots that he can just deploy and self-destruct in front of the party when nobody is left to defend him and his corporate empire.
-   In _Quest for Glory III,_ if you ask the meat merchant the second time about meat, the system replies, "On second thought, you don't want to know."
    -   Speaking of _Quest For Glory_, one of Gnome Ann's meals is goulash. Normally, she describes the entire method that goes into making each meal, but with goulash, all she says is, "You don't want to know. You _really_ don't want to know."
-   In one of the opening missions of _Mass Effect 2_, you come across a log recorded by the Chief Medical Officer of the Lazarus Project that brought you back from the dead. He wonders how the Illusive Man manages to keep funding the project despite it going over-budget, concluding that it's perhaps better not to know.
-   In _Halo 2_, in a cutscene early in the game, Master Chief disarms a Covenant bomb on board Cairo Station with the help of Cortana.
    
    **Master Chief:** "How much time was left?"  
    **Cortana:** "You DON'T want to know."
    
-   _Tales of Monkey Island_: In Chapter 3:
    
    **Winslow:** I'll keep an eye on Miss LeFlay. If she stirs, I'll give her the old scurvy buttons!
    
    **Guybrush:** _\[disturbed\]_ I don't want to know what that is.
    
    -   And in Chapter 4:
        
        **Guybrush:** If I plead guilty, will I get out of here any quicker?  
        **Judge Grindstump:** Most definitely—  
        **Guybrush:** Great! Then I plead—  
        **Judge Grindstump:** _\[interrupts\]_ After the summary executions by keelhauling, hanging, boiling, and, eh, em... scaphism. _\[the crowd laughs\]_  
        **Guybrush:** _\[confused\]_ Scaphism?  
        **Stan:** Trust me, kid, you don't want to know.  
        **Guybrush:** Okay, then...

    _"I know that you have seen much over the many, many years of your existence, but you truly don't want to know."_
    
-   Take the mage quest early in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ and after saving Leliana Dorian will attempt to find out what happened. What's already seen is perhaps the most horrific scenes in the series, and her utter reticence for an explanation suggests we just take her word for it that as bad as things are the rest is _far_ worse.
-   The final cutscene of _Dreamkiller_, after you destroy the Dream Devourer and regains consciousness in the real world. A medic attending to you asks if you're alright and if you remember what happened; you reply to him in-verbatim. "You don't really want to know, trust me..."
-   Played for comedy in _Jak II: Renegade_ at the end of the game:

-   _Battle Chasers: Nightwar:_ When the party find Knolan:

When asking politely and firmly insisting don't work, Ingrid kicks down the door, terrifying Bernadetta enough that she comes along. Bernadtta then wonders what Ingrid would do to her enemies if this is how she treats her classmates.
    
    **Ingrid**: Don't ask questions you don't want answers to.
    
-   In _The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone_, we have this exchange between Geralt and Gaunter O'Dimm:
    
    **Geralt**: You're not human, that's for sure. So what are you? A demon? A Djinn?  
    **Gaunther**: Do you really wish to know?  
    **Geralt**: Yes.  
    **Gaunther**: No, Geralt, you don't. This one time I shall spare you and not grant your wish. All who have learned my true name are now either dead or have met a worse fate. Yet I still need you.
    
-   _Sam & Max_, In the prologue to _Moai Better Blues_, Sam and Max find Sybil being chased by a giant triangle-shaped portal.

    Web Animation 

-   _Homestar Runner_:
    -   If you want to know how to animate Homestar, according to "Sample of Style Too" it involves a pair of underpants with ping-pong sensor nodes on it. Matt quotes this word for word after showing the viewer this.
    -   In the Halloween toon "Mr. Poofers Must Die!", Coach Z and Pom Pom collaborate on a costume of Missy Elliot's baggy black jumpsuit from the music video for "The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)"... which involves Coach Z's head sticking out of Pom Pom's spherical body.
        
        **Strong Bad**: Do I even wanna know how you and Pom Pom are pulling this costume off?  
        **Coach Z:** I can assure you: you do not.  
        (_Pom Pom sticks his head out of his body and bubbles in annoyance_)  
        **Coach Z:** Get back in there! (_shoves Pom Pom's head back in_)
        
-   _Red vs. Blue_:
    -   In season 3, Church encounters multiple versions of himself due to time travel, including one who is an odd yellow color. When asked how he got like that, he simply replies, "Dude, Don't Ask." In season five, it turns out yellow Church is actually the personification of Sister in Caboose's head. And according to Season 10, may or may not actually exist. In Yellow Church's own words, It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time.
    -   Season 10 adds the fate of Agent Georgia. It somehow involved a zero-g thruster pack.
        
        **York:** We're going all the way over there? After what happened to Georgia?  
        **Washington:** Would someone **please** tell me what happened to Georgia?!  
        **York:** Dude, you do NOT wanna know. _\[flies off\]_  
        **Wash:** I really _do_, though!
        
-   The pilot for _Knights of All Realms_ starts after the knights have traded a dragon tooth to the Tooth Fairy for a large sack of coins. When Arla asks Lady Bugg what the Tooth Fairy does with all those teeth, Lady Bugg insists that she _doesn't_ want to know and that it's creepy.
-   When Big D is being interrogated by the police in _Hunter: The Parenting_, he invokes this to make his story more plausible. When asked to explain why his house has a dungeon with cages, whips, a live camera feed, and two dead bodies <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , he feigns disgust and refuses to answer at first. When the cop presses him, he is embarrassed to say that it is his friend (son) Marckus's sex dungeon, and hints at multiple disturbing yet nonexistent Noodle Incidents to make sure he asks as little as possible.

    Webcomics 

-   _Sluggy Freelance_:
    -   Toyed with by fan favorite Sasha: "Part of me wants to say 'I don't want to know', but I _do_! I really, _really do_!"

        "How did you get a Sacagawea dollar to penetrate your front grill and lodge itself in your carburetor?"  
        "You don't want to know."  
        "Why are you dressed as a ninja?"  
        "I don't want to tell you."
        
-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    -   Done by the narrator in this strip when he covers Massey's description of how being Mind Raped by the lawyer collective felt with a narration bubble.
        
        **Massey:** Well, to continue the metaphor, picture a billion attorneys, all bent on violating your mind, like the galaxy's single largest—  
        **Narrator:** Whups. Sorry about that! We at _Schlock Mercenary_ don't want to trouble the tender minds of our viewers with truly disturbing metaphors like this one. And believe me, you do **not** want to know where this one was going. Suffice it to say that Massey's experience was unpleasant. Now, back to the story.  
        **Schlock:** Ugh. Like, over cornflakes?
        
    -   Another example:
        
        **Breya:** I... I really want to know, but I think I'm afraid to _ask_.  
        **Tagon:** That means you don't really want to know.
        
    -   Also inverted here:
        
        **Elf:** I don't want to know.  
        **Aardman:** Yes you do. You just don't want to admit it.
        
    -   Admiral Tebbir would feel better trusting Petey on this one (see the next 3 pages).
-   Used once in _Penny Arcade_: "Wow, it's like...I want to see it? But at the same time, I don't want to see it."
    -   In a subversion, that's just Gabe Comically Missing the Point; Tycho's being kicked out of being a man.
-   _Questionable Content_:
-   _Freefall_:
    -   Helix, a robot, needs to use the bathroom.

        **Sam**: Uhm, no. I don't think you do.
        
    -   Sometimes you don't know whether you want to know why you ended up wearing your enemy's pants.
    -   Nightmare Fuel is discussed during a late-night discussion of Dvorak's cage.
        
        **Police Chief**: Dvorak is bringing over a reinforced cage he made for the containment of dangerous electronic life forms.  
        **Bill Raibert**: This cage. Is it something he built in case of, or because of?  
        **Police Chief**: If you want to sleep tonight, you don't want the answer to that question.
        
-   _Nodwick_ theology has this effect:
    
    **Artax:** The _more_ I learn about gods, the _less_ I want to know.
    
-   _The Order of the Stick_ has "He's Still a Dwarf at Heart":
    
    **Roy:** Wha-Durkon??
    
    **Durkon:** Tha's Bandit King Durkon ta you, laddie!
    
    **Roy:** Part of me wants to know a story behind that, while the other, smarter part of me knows it's better off in ignorance.
    
-   _Faux Pas_
    
    **A rabbit:** So, what do you like to eat?  
    **Dusk (a fox):** Kid... never ask a question if you won't like the answer.

-   _The Whiteboard_: A common reaction by the regulars when Sandy or Pirta (moreso the latter, not having been around the gang for as long as the former) asks about any particular weirdness happening.
-   Used in _Yosh!_ in response to an accidental Double Entendre.
    
    **Lia:** Don't. I know you want to explain what he means by that, but don't.
    
-   After Mal from _Head Trip_'s brother Dane finds out she went to "visit" their sister Kat's Jewish ex, who did not take the breakup well:
    
    **Dane:** _\[after trailing off and a beat panel\]_ Mal, why is there a **bloody menorah** on your desk?  
    **Mal:** Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Dane.  
    **Dane:** Oh... **Oh** my **God**, is that an **ear** hanging off of it?!  
    **Mal:** What did I just **tell** you?
    
-   _Bram & Vlad_ has this:
    
    **Bessie:** Why would one possibly want a jar full of _eyeballs_?  
    **Bram:** Do you _really_ want to know?
    
-   In the space arc of _Arthur, King of Time and Space_, Kay complains about Arthur passing arbitrary Loony Laws, and Mordred says that Arthur might pass laws for obscure or whimsical reasons, but there will _be_ a reason, if they only knew it. Kay says the law is "No serving of alcohol to cows on a Tuesday", and Mordred amends his comment to "Or, as it might be, if we ever wanted to know it".

    Web Original 

-   _Destroy the Godmodder_: This is the general response to any questions regarding the godmodder's past. We know he is a he, that he is independent, has lots of cash, a really cool Hacker Cave, and that his name is Richard, and not much else.
-   In Part 15 of _A Trickster's Tail_, after the two of them have escaped the afterlife and Keith has related his adventure to Kickaha.
    
    **Keith:** So... what happened to you?  
    **Kickaha:** You don't want to know.  
    **Keith:** WHAT? We're probably the only two people on this planet that can have this discussion, and you're telling me that _I don't want to know?_  
    **Kickaha:** Look. You don't understand. _You were there. You told me. You don't want to know._
    
-   In _The Binder of Shame_, this is used occasionally.
    
    **Blobert Smith:** My character deals with his post-traumatic stress by putting porridge up his nose on moonlit nights.  
    **Weasly Crusher:** Why would he—  
    **El Disgusto:** Don't! Just don't.
    
-   A prime example of this appears in _Strange Aeons_. Despite heavy questioning, Nick is adamant in warning Chris to not look up the videos on the Strange Aeons channel.
-   _SCP Foundation_: For SCP-231, the containment procedure 110-Montauk is designed to keep the pregnant girl (age unspecified) from giving birth to a creature that will cause The End of the World as We Know It. All but the vaguest details regarding 110-Montauk are expunged and redacted; the only details we get are that it's horrifically inhumane<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , that only non-violent D-class personnel are ever to be given authorization to carry out the procedure<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , that it's so agonizing to the one carrying out the procedure that those who do it are routinely given Laser-Guided Amnesia to prevent psychological damage<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and that the subject has to be awake, lucid, and aware of what's happening to her or it won't work.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  The O5 council, the leaders of the Foundation who already operate with dubious morals at the best of times, are disgusted with themselves that this is the best they can do in this case and avoid talking about it as much as possible; case in point, the photo that would normally accompany the article isn't only missing, it's pointedly removed by order of the O5. The article is screaming this trope with the amount of redaction alone.
-   Paul Robinson's short story _It Can't Be That Bad_ tells the story of Clark Rosecrans, a man who discovered something that bothered him. Clark goes to see a psychiatrist, and tells how he tried calling suicide prevention, every time he tells someone, they hang up and when he calls back he finds they've killed themselves. The doctor tells him he's heard many bad things, and "It can't be that bad." The doctor promptly commits suicide after hearing Clark's story. Even the police are not immune.

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Amazing World of Gumball_ episode "The Box", the box delivered to the Wattersons' house turns out to be for their neighbor Mr. Robinson, who says the Wattersons don't want to know what's inside, but they insist after wondering the entire episode. He then goes into a very graphic, very long description of a repulsive skin condition the box contained an ointment for. They agree they didn't want to know.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   Seen in "The Sting":
        
        **Farnsworth:** This is no ordinary honey. It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neurotoxin can cause instant death!  
        **Hermes:** _\[happily\]_ And that's if you're not allergic! You don't wanna know what happens then. Oh no, no. God no!  
        **Farnsworth:** Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano!  
        **Hermes:** _\[sobbing\]_ I didn't want to know!
        
    -   And you really don't want to know whose behind Slurm comes out of. Same episode, the same is said of where toothpaste comes from. This squicks out even the creature who creates Slurm.
-   _The Twisted Talesof Felix The Cat_: In "Step Right Up", Felix visits a carnival sideshow and sees an ordinary-looking woman sitting. A nearby boy asks the lady what is so special about her, and the woman says this verbatim in in a deep masculine-sounding voice.
-   _Code Lyoko_: The school gym teacher Jim is very closemouthed about his past. While he often _mentions_ his previous careers, he usually says "I'd rather not talk about it" when pressed about them, except for two notable cases: once when he says he's not _allowed_ to talk about it (it involved government work), and once when he'd have loved to talk about it (it involved skateboarding), but he didn't have time because he was too busy with something school-related right then. This catchphrase was actually the title of an episode where he was the central character. (In that episode, he actually _does_ talk about it.)
-   _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_:
    -   Grim gives Billy a gumball machine that yields a limitless amount of gum, but warns him never to swallow the gum. When asked what will happen if he does, Grim says, "Trust me, you don't wanna know. If I had skin, it would be crawling." Billy eventually ignores this warning, and we find out that swallowing the gum causes "an unimaginably horrible rash from another dimension." Though Billy initially has bubbles and gum coming out of his body before it actually happens. The rash was what it said on the label.
    -   And then there's the thankfully not elaborated method of how Irwin's mom (A mummy) and his dad made a kid.
        
        **Dick:** Yes, Irwin's mom is actually a mummy. Nobody can tell you who to fall in love with, but we've managed to make it work all these years. Leaving a whole lot of questions that don't need to be answered.  
        **Grim:** Eh, works for me.  
        **Irwin:** Ditto.  
        **Mandy:** Me too.  
        **Billy:** ...Yeeeeeaaah, but how did you and Irwin's mom...  
        **Dick:** _\[in the exact same tone of voice\]_ Leaving a whole lot of questions that don't need to be answered.
        
-   In _Transformers: Animated_ when Starscream finds out that each of his clones represent a different part of his personality and he asks which part an _Opposite-Sex Clone_ represents, her response is "Don't ask!"
    -   Funnily enough, Word of God states the same thing.
    -   In an earlier episode, Prowl, Bumblebee and Sari go on a camping trip, and the latter two bring all manner of gadgets. Prowl, unimpressed, asks Bee where he found room for all of it in his vehicle mode. "I'd...rather not say".
-   In an episode of the ongoing _Hercules_ series, the water of the Spring of Canathus turns Hercules, Icarus, Pegasus, Adonis, and Hades' minion Pain into infants, which results in Cassandra and Hades other minion Panic becoming Badly Battered Babysitters for the rest of the episode. When the curse is finally undone, Hades shows up, and at first, he asks why everyone is wearing diapers, but then he changes his mind and says he doesn't _want_ to know, and leaves with his two servants. (However, Hercules and his friends _do_ want to know what happened, and after Cassandra tells them, they all beg and plead with her not to tell anyone.)
-   _Justice League_:
    -   In an episode, having just captured the assassin Deadshot who tried to kill Aquaman, several members of the League threaten him with physical violence, which he shrugs off. Batman then takes him aside and whispers something to him, he practically _begs_ to tell everything he knows. When Wonder Woman asks Superman what was said (Supes possesses acute hearing) _he_ tells her that she doesn't want to know. Made even better by the expression on his face. According to Kevin Conroy, the actor who played Batman, he was told to whisper "I know where you live, Floyd".
    -   Also, in the Forced Prize Fight _Unlimited_ episode "Grudge Match", Hawkgirl's reaction after being snapped out of mind control;
        
        "I don't think I want to know."  
        "We're all in a cage match fighting to the death."  
        "Yeah, see?"
        
-   Speaking of Batman... In one Crossover episode of _Static Shock_, a time-chair Batman took off a villain accidentally sends Static into a future time, where he meets both Terry McGinnis (aka _Batman Beyond_) and the aged Bruce Wayne, along with his future self. At the end of the episode, he returns to his own time and is about to reveal to Batman what _his_ future is like, but Batman interrupts him, saying that he'd "rather not know".
    
    **Static:** Oh. Well... you still had all your hair.
    
-   In the _Ben 10_ episode "Ken 10" Ken rejects adding an alien called 'Toepick' to the Omnitrix, saying "He even grosses me out!". The pop-up edition plays this up by having the pop-up say "You don't want to know". Toepick makes an appearance in _Ben 10: Omniverse_. He has a green cage covering his face, which is so nightmarish it makes Psyphon turn white with fear and beg for mercy.
    -   In another _Omniverse_ episode, Rook makes a concoction as per Gwen's instructions to try and help cure Ben's out-of-control acne. Ben chugs it immediately, at which point Rook tells him he wasn't supposed to drink it. When Ben asks what the ingredients were, Rook tells him he's better off not knowing.
-   In _Invader Zim's_ Crapsack World, people inexplicably hand out meat on Valentine's Day. When Dib asks how this tradition got started, Ms. Bitters (who never had a problem telling the children disturbing truths before) simply replies that he doesn't want to know.
-   In _The Real Ghostbusters_, the episode 'Knock, Knock' has Egon look into the room that holds the door to Doomsday. When asks what he sees, he replies 'you don't want to know' in his usual calm, dull tone of voice.
-   In _The Penguins of Madagascar_ there is a long running gag involving Skipper with this called the "Copenhagen/Denmark incident". It´s seems he is unable to set foot in Denmark for unknown circumstances after being declared that country´s Public Enemy Number One. When Private asked "What happened at Denmark?" (and any other character, even if they made the slightly commentary about this) he only gets the "You don´t wanna know/ask about that Private!!!" from Skipper. Partially reverted as the show goes on, with one episode explaining Hans the puffin had framed him, and some details about the incident involving explosions and a high-speed chase, and another revealing it has something to do with open faced sandwiches (yeah...just **don´t** ask...)
-   Tex Avery MGM Cartoons: In the Droopy cartoon _The Three Little Pups_, Droopy is watching television with his two brothers in one scene; the Wolf tries to suck them up with a giant straw, only to grab the televison instead (and end up with it lodged in his stomach). Two scenes later, Droopy and his brothers are watching television again, and Droopy looks at the camera and says, "Now don't ask us how we got the television set back..."
-   _Kim Possible_:
    -   In a scene involving a "gravy ghost" spelling words in the high-school cafeteria gravy;
        
        **Wade:** I don't know what to tell you, Kim. After watching the cafeteria security tape, I can't explain what happened either.  
        **Kim:** Did you analyze the gravy sample?  
        **Wade:** Yup.  
        **Monique:** And?  
        **Wade:** You don't want to know. _\[Beat\]_ Not till after graduation. _\[Beat\]_ From college.  
        **Monique:** I say we trust him on the gravy.
        
    -   Another example, when "Miss Go" (Shego temporarily turned good) arrives to teach one of Kim's classes:
        
        **Mr. Barkin:** And don't let them tell you that they're supposed to have class outside! We put a stop to that after the jellyfish incident.  
        **Miss Go:** Oh, that's so sweet! You took the class to the beach!  
        **Mr. Barkin:** No beach. Just jellyfish... _\[shudders\]_ Don't ask.
        
-   In the _Strawberry Shortcake Berryfest Princess Movie_, Blueberry Muffin walks in on Strawberry Shortcake doing a bunnyhop and sorting mixed nuts with Plum Pudding at Orange Blossom's general store and comments, "Do I wanna know?" A little while later, after reading a map has been added to Strawberry's tasks, Orange returns, also commenting, "Do I wanna know?" "That's what I said," Blueberry tells her.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   In "Boast Busters", it turns out that the three story tall celestial bear that attacked Ponyville at the climax was not an Ursa Major, but an Ursa _Minor_ — a cub. When Spike asks what a full-grown Ursa Major is like, the audience is shown a rather scary-looking star-bear big enough to be holding the Ursa Minor in its arms like a baby, which is followed by a cut back to Twilight telling Spike "You don't want to know."
    -   Rainbow Dash says this in "Party of One" after Twilight wonders what Dash meant by "At least I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips."
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In the episode "I Love Lisa," Ralph Wiggum has tickets to Krusty's anniversary show, and he invites Lisa. Bart really wants to go, and he suggests disguising himself as Lisa.
        
        **Lisa:** But what if he wants to hold hands?  
        **Bart:** I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.  
        **Lisa:** What if he wants to kiss?  
        **Bart:** I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.  
        **Lisa:** What if he wants to—  
        **Bart:** You don't want to know how far I'll go.
        
    -   A Simpsons TV Episode guide also used this phrase on the subject of how Kang and Kodos could tell each other's genders.
    -   Another episode had Bart rubbing his ear industriously and acting sick so that when Marge took his temperature (through his ear) it would come out to 103 F and he could stay home. She says the only way to be sure was to use the rectal thermometer. It still came out to 103. When Lisa asked, Bart says she doesn't want to know.
-   _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)_:
    -   In "The Origin of The Sorceress": Teela-na, the future Sorceress, gets this line from a young town who had been watching the villain of the day and an alien race argue over things.
    -   Buzz-Off uses this line twice in two separate episodes of the 2002 remake. The first is during season one, where Man-At-Arms is swallowed by Merman's giant shark-monster. (For the second time.) He-Man tries to rescue him by diving down the beast's throat, leading to this exchange:
        
        **Ram-Man:** Okay! So they're in! So, uh... How are they gettin' out?  
        **Buzz-Off:** I don't even wanna know..
        
    -   The second time was the second season, after he and Stratos found that Webstor had gorged himself on ambrosia, turning himself into a monstrous, demonic spider. It got even worse when they found his lair and the captive Adreenans All Webbed Up... And eggshells lying on the ground, indicating that the villain had spawned a brood of young. (Webstor had been assumed to be male up to now.) When Statos asked how this was possible, Buzz-Off again, said, "I don't even wanna know."
-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_: Used as a form of Implied Death Threat in "Courage in the Big Stinkin' City".
    
    **Bushwik:** You see that door? You wanna know what's behind that door? You don't wanna know what's behind that door. See these bones? You wanna know what made these bones?  
    **Courage:** _\[nods, but begins to shake his head as Bushwik does\]_  
    **Buskwik:** You don't wanna know what made these bones.
    
-   In the second _Danny Phantom_ movie, _The Ultimate Enemy_, after Danny asks Future Vlad what happened to Danny's human half, Vlad only tells him, "Some things, my boy, are better left unsaid..."
-   A variant in the _Milo Murphy's Law_ episode "Smooth Opera-tor:"
-   _House of Mouse_: In "Dining Goofy", Mickey and Minnie go over guest problems arising from Goofy's constant screw-ups as a waiter.
    
    **Minnie:** Mushu is going to sue if he can't breathe fire, Timon sent us his air-freshening bill...  
    **Mickey:** What about Hades?  
    **Minnie:** You don't want to know.
    
-   _Rick and Morty_: A variant is used in "Total Rickall", when Rick places the Smith house on lockdown:
    
    **Beth:** Dad, why does our house have _blast shields_?  
    **Rick:** Trust me, Beth; you don't wanna know how many answers that question has.
    
-   In the _My Gym Partner's a Monkey_ episode "One Lump or Tutor", one of Adam's classes require him to test his predatory instincts by eating what looks like a cow made out of cheese.

-   _American Dad!_: In "The Most Adequate Christmas Ever", Stan asks his heavenly lawyer Michelle what happened to Jim Henson, and she replies, "You don't want to know". It's then revealed to the viewer that he and Kermit the Frog are imprisoned in the Phantom Zone for blasphemy on Kermit's part.
    
    **Henson:** Forgive us!  
    **Kermit:** You will bow down before me, son of God!

    Real Life 

-   How _America's Got Talent_ 75-year-old contestant Sally from Portland discovered she could hand-whistle. She wrote a book about it, but part of the book was also about her coming. Judging by how the judges on the show reacted ('mm-hmm'-ing and nodding), they evidently didn't consider it to be an example of the trope. It could be a bit of a Mood Whiplash, though.
