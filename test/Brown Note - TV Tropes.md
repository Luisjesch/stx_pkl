Her optometrist turned a blind eye to the real problem at hand.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

A Brown Note is a sensory input that is inherently harmful. Exactly how it works is left up to the imagination of the writer. In older works, especially the classic myths that codified the trope, this was almost always supernatural, typically a curse or strange spell. More modern or "grounded" works will try to pass it off as psychological.

Named for the urban legend about an audio tone that, when played, causes the listener to lose control of their bowels and spontaneously defecate.

Usually, we don't get to see or hear it ourselves, for obvious reasons.

See also Black Speech for inherently evil languages, which may overlap with this for people who aren't evil enough, and Trigger Phrase for brown notes created through psychological conditioning. A Brown Note Being is an entity that causes this by something of its very nature, and is a common trait of Eldritch Abominations, due to how mind-breakingly alien they are. The nastiest forms of this also force their victims to propagate them, overlapping with Mind Virus. Not to be confused with the real-life "Brown noise," which is completely harmless and sounds a bit like a poorly maintained air conditioner. Compare Suckiness Is Painful, for when the "Note" is an awful work of art, and Sonic Stunner for sounds that cause physical harm due to their extreme volume.

-   In the first episode of _Kuai Le Xin Xin_, whistling causes a Potty Emergency; and, if they're asleep, bedwetting. It's Justified, because many Chinese parents potty-train their kids by whistling.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Zits_, Pierce's drum solos have been known to cause spontaneous nosebleeds.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: Ghidorah's decapitated head retains a psychic influence on humans among Alan Jonah's organization even after San's mind has Brain Uploaded out of it. Gradually, it induces Sanity Slippages in the affected, and those who don't experience More than Mind Control are Driven to Suicide.
-   In _Against the Deep,_ Shipgirls and Abyssals have this effect on Thinkers. Coil winds up bumping into Taylor Hebert, the natural-born USS Lord's Port, and passed out when he couldn't model her at all.
-   In _Amazing Fantasy_, Phil has the ability to produce a "Lunatic Laugh", an Evil Laugh that instantly paralyzes others with fear. Phil uses this to completely disarm Daniel, giving him the opportunity to free himself and stab him with his own sword.
-   _Aurora Falls_: Apparently, the TRIDENT array can be set to the resonant frequency of the gastrointestinal system. Exactly what that does isn't directly elaborated upon, but it was evidently enough to push Tomar over the edge.
-   _Besides the Will of Evil_: The screams of the fell beasts cause anyone who hears them to be overwhelmed by visceral terror.
-   _The Bolt Chronicles_: In "The Spaceship," Rhino blows on a dog whistle that proves intensely painful to both Bolt's ears and those of the dog-like aliens who try to abduct the hamster.
-   In _Child of the Storm_, Sean Cassidy's powers are upgraded from simply 'screaming at people' and 'improbably flying', to a number of other sound related applications. One of these is being able to hit the resonant frequency of various kinds of woods, the point at which they shatter. Wand woods, to be specific. If that didn't make him dangerous enough, chapter 70 reveals that he can also hit the resonant frequency of _bone_. He's also figured out how to use his powers to create a Compelling Voice, which he used to avenge the death of his wife: All we know about how that went down is that even _Nick Fury_ can never unsee the mess he made.
-   _Children of an Elder God_: In episode 9, "The King In Yellow" play makes an appearance. When it's performed, a lot of people goes mad and dies, and Hastur shows up at the end. However, it's defeated and destroyed.
-   In _The End of All Things_ a magical reaction destroys the Horcrux in Harry's scar during second year. It's stated that if Madame Pomfrey had been unlucky enough to hear its dying scream it would've shattered her mind.
-   _Equestrylvania_: Just looking at Death's face Mind Rapes the viewer, causing them to relive every terrible memory they have.
-   In the _Danny Phantom_ fanfic Stolen Years of the _Facing the Future Series_, Jack invented a device that emitted a painful sound that only ghosts could hear. He got the effect backwards. It is later used to disable the Guys in White, to rescue Danielle.
-   In _Fallout: Equestria_, contact with the Pink Cloud transforms anything capable of emitting sound (radios, loudspeakers, etc.) into 'corrupted broadcasters' that emit literal ear-piercing noises. Prolonged exposure to their signal can cause heads to explode.
-   In _For the Glory of Irk_, the Parasite known as Q usually speaks in a telepathic simulation of human voices. When he speaks in his own language, it's enough to cause Dib pain and nearly overwhelm him.
-   Apparently, an age-regressed Reimu and trying to understand her (or rather understand her personality and antics) is this for some, as Ran noted that trying to do so would cause mental distress, making the effect rather psychological. The fact that Reimu, by this point, is a youkai doesn't help matters either.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Edge of the Light_ a howling from the Veil which only Hermione can hear causes physical damage which results in her eardrums needing to be regrown.
-   _In Flight_ has Jinki act like this for Shirou, as they completely confound his Structural Grasp.
-   Ringo's mindsight turns out to function this way in _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_. Any genuine telepath (John is not one) who taps into Ringo while he's using mindsight will instantly become addicted to it, and unless he's heavily shielded, he'll also get the mental equivalent of a bad sunburn. And don't think the mindsight isn't having a comparable addictive effect on Ringo—hence his extreme Blessed with Suck.
-   _It's Always The Quiet Ones_: Merely being exposed to the eldritch dimension housing the Wrackspurts and Deep Ones for a few minutes is enough to traumatize everyone in Hogwarts' Great Hall. Numerous patients end up checking into St. Mungo's, developing incurable phobias of tentacles and fishy smells.
-   _The Night Unfurls_:
    -   In Chapter 16 of the original, right before Shamumaza reveals himself in the courtyard, a Black Speech is present that gives Sanakan, Hugh, and Lily visible anxiety and discomfort.
    -   Kyril advises Sanakan and Hugh not to look too hard at the Alien Geometries of the Malys Estate, noting how lesser men and women would be driven mad by the place.
    -   Anyone who catches a glimpse of what's behind Kyril's mortal mask gets mind-raped to a Fate Worse than Death. He even says to his first two apprentices that this would do "very bad things" to their heads. The insect beast who was once Shamuhaza learns this in the worst way possible.
-   In _Number 48_ Harry's Grim Reaper says that Leviathan's true form is so impossibly beautiful that looking at him causes mortals to feel pain unless he decides otherwise.
-   In _Pokemon Black & White: Tale of a Legend_, Volan, Thrin, and their dragons are filled with intense pain and anger when they hear Kyurem's cry.
-   In _The Power of the Press_ the screaming of a Horcrux being destroyed gives Sirius nightmares and makes an American observer physically ill.
-   In the _Pony POV Series_, there's Havoc, Anthropomorphic Personification of Mass Hysteria. Looking at his true form will terrify ponies so badly they'll likely never sleep again. His _voice_ will reduce them to horrified wrecks.
-   In the prequel to a _Portal 2_ fanfiction called The Punishment, Wheatley falls victim to a glitch programmed into all personality cores which makes them "fall asleep" at the sound of human singing.
-   In a case of Real Life Writes the Plot, Twilight Sparkle in _Pages Of Harmony_ uses infrasound on Fluttershy as part of the procedures to break Kindness from her. The process causes Fluttershy to feel disoriented, a nearly tangible fear that completely overwhelms her as she experiences horrifying visions.
-   _Re: My Hostage, Not Yours_: The living computer core of the Valkians' ship is so obscenely bizarre in appearance that, combined with the concussion she's suffering from, Gaz gets sick just looking at it.
-   _Robb Returns_: The entity behind the Hightower Gate emits an aura of fear to everyone in its proximity, and the effect is stronger the closer you get. At a certain distance (marked on the floor), the aura causes people to lose control of their bowels. Get closer, and you'll collapse from fear. And if you get too close, you die of sheer terror, then the entity possesses your corpse and tries to break out from behind the gate. However, wielding Otherbane renders you immune to the aura.
-   In _The Shape of the Nightmare to Come_, saying the full name of "the Nexus of ever fated rising madness hope of all turned black doom to all the belligerents and their gods all hail doom nightmares" causes severe nausea and vomiting, and wreaks havoc on recording equipment.
-   _The Stars Will Aid Their Escape_:
    -   During the attack on Canterlot, Herald has Trixie conjure the Red Sigil, which causes intense pain if you just glimpse it, and insanity if viewed directly.
    -   If Herald removes his mask and shows his true face, the viewer's mind is filled with knowledge of the Outer Gods, which drives them insane. This is what he does to Twilight Sparkle.
-   _This Bites!_:
    -   Soundbite learns to produce a sound that causes extreme nausea and disorientation in everyone who hears it, enabling Cross to take them down easier. He and Cross christen it "Gastro-Phony" (going off of cacophony) in Chapter 25.
    -   When DJ Gappa of Baron Omatsuri's crew, possessed by Lily, broadcasts on the SBS to invite them to come to their island, the sheer fakeness being broadcasted sends chills up everyone's spine. To say nothing of what happens when anyone tries calling Soundbite while on the island. All they get is a completely unholy sound, with a hint of _something_ underneath. <sup>What?&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The Triptych Continuum ascribes this to _her_ cutie mark, stating that ponies looking at it are quite disturbed, with Twilight nearly experiencing it as a breaking event. The mark is _animated_, and up until _she_ came along, no mark had ever moved: the disruption of that level of constant doesn't go over well. Notably, however, some individuals aren't affected and claim it's beautiful, while Spike seems to be aware that _something_ is off, but isn't sure what.
-   In _Unprecedented Competition_ a mosaic of Merlin states that the Welsh Red dragon had a cry which could stun or kill animals and Muggles. This eventually resulted in its deliberate extinction.
-   _With This Ring_: When Paul makes an alliance of convenience with Hell to protect him from an attack by angels gone rogue, he discovers that the imprisoned angel Gabriel has been tortured and twisted into a weapon against holy power.
    
    Some.. sort of arcane device is being winched into place, another Scabbie… With a hole in his chest where his heart used to be. Chains are pulled taut, and some sort of arcane device lights up-.  
    Gabriel screams, and black mists rise from the ground throughout the battlefield.  
    "What-?"  
    Angel songs falter and fail, angel wings shake and shed their feathers…  
    "That's-. Nono-."  
    "The Song of Creation's Antithesis." Rosacarnis smiles as I shudder inside my armour.

-   The last segment of the horror anthology _Chilling Visions: 5 Senses of Fear_ features video recordings of experiments with a lethal Brown Note musical piece that makes listeners tear themselves apart.

-   In _Disturbing Behavior_, the E-Rat-icator device used by Mr. Newburry is designed to have this effect on rats to drive them away, but it doesn't work so well. It is, however, _damn_ effective against mind-control chips.
-   According to the Metatron in _Dogma_:
    
    _"... human beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstand the awesome power of God's true voice. Were you to hear it, your mind would cave in, and your heart would explode within your chest. We went through five Adams before we figured that out."_

-   In _Kingsman: The Secret Service_, the villain develops a signal (transmittable by cell phone) which causes anyone nearby to become violently homicidal. The first live test is done in a crowded church, while a highly competent secret agent happens to be present. The resulting four minutes of deadly free-for-all is epic.
-   _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_: The concussion from the tank's main gun firing in the opening sequence puts the pursuing constables on the ground, groaning and helpless. Justified considering that they just had several artillery shells powerful enough to blow the vault door off its hinges go off in a confined space; the bigger surprise is that the overpressure didn't outright kill them and that the Fantom and his men can still hear each other (apparently, the tank cabin has _very_ good sound insulation).
-   The _James Bond_ film _Live and Let Die_ opens with the assassination of the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United Nations, carried out through sound piped through his translation earpiece.
-   In _The Lords of Salem_, the song on the strange record has this effect on Heidi.

-   _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ has the Knights who say Ni!. Like their name makes clear, they utter the word "Ni!" in a very screechy high pitched voice to hurt passing travelers and scare them into doing their bidding.

It's later revealed the word "it" serves as a Brown Note against the Knights themselves.

    _"For your safety, please avoid contact with close family members, and refrain from the following: all terms of endearment, such as 'honey' or 'sweetheart'; babytalk with young children; and rhetorical discourse.

    Music 

-   The music video for the Radiohead song "Just" begins with a man lying down in the middle of the street and refusing to budge. As people gather, they ask him (all the dialogue being in subtitles) why he's lying there, and after refusing over and over again, he finally caves in. The camera zooms in on his mouth as he's speaking, but with the subtitles suddenly removed, the audience has no idea what he's saying. The final scene of the video is of all the people around him lying on the ground in the same posture, his words presumably having had the exact same effect on them as on him. The closeup has him repeating "God help me, I'll tell you." and it's implied that he's actually saying it during the shot of Radiohead looking out the window.
-   The Kate Bush song "Experiment IV": "But they told us All they wanted Was a sound that Could kill someone from a distance."
    -   And in the video, the scientists deliver; although the sound does not manifest anything like what might have been expected. (The video is also notable these days for featuring the then-virtually-unknown Hugh Laurie and Dawn French in cameo roles!)
-   "The Sermon II", the opening, spoken-word track on The Creepshow's album "Run For Your Life", is about a radio signal that causes a Zombie Apocalypse.
-   Hawkwind's song "Sonic Attack" (actually more spoken-word with a few musical undertones) features a public service announcer giving advice on what to do "In case of Sonic Attack on your region," and describing symptoms of "imminent sonic destruction," which include dizziness, vomiting, an ache in the pelvic region, and fits of hysterical shouting or laughter (at which the announcer starts laughing hysterically, revealing that the Sonic Attack has hit _his_ region).
-   DYE's "Fantasy" music video ends with the protagonist seeing an Eldritch Abomination so horrible that the mere sight of it made her eyes explode into flame.
-   They Might Be Giants:
    -   In "Experimental Film" the ending of the titular film supposedly "makes your face implode".
    -   In "Spiralling Shape", the eponymous "hypnotic and strange" shape "will make you go insane", despite which "everyone wants to see that groovy thing".
-   Devo performed a live cover of "In Heaven" from _Eraserhead_ in 1979, with Mark Mothersbaugh as Booji Boy on vocals. In the middle of the song Booji would give a speech about future "holographic" Devo concerts, which would include the following feature: "And we'll pass out diapers at the door for everyone, so that when you all get in here, we'll turn on the sub-sonic frequencies, and we'll all sh\*t our pants together!"
-   The Lonely Island's "WHEN WILL THE BASS DROP?" (featuring Lil Jon), a parody of dubstep DJ's, is this in the music video. When the bass finally drops, Lil Jon says "Get turned up to death!" and people immediately start exploding and/or killing themselves.
-   According to Chromeo's video for "When The Night Falls", their music apparently has the ability to instantly make women nine months pregnant.
-   Classical composer Erik Satie wrote a piece called "Vexations", which consists of two faintly unsettling bars of music that would otherwise be unremarkable save for the instructions to repeat it 840 times, which takes at least 24 uninterrupted hours to perform. When Australian pianist Peter Evans tried to perform it as instructed in 1970, he reported that he started panicking and hallucinating before he had to stop. He was at repetition number 595.
    
    "I would not play this piece again. I felt each repetition slowly wearing my mind away. I had to stop. If I hadn't stopped I'd be a very different person today... People who play it do so at their own great peril. ... \[I\] had to stop because \[my\] mind became full of evil thoughts, animals and 'things' started peering out at \[me\] from the score."
    
-   Japanese all-girl metal band Nemophila in their announcement for their January 9 2022, Line Cube Shibuya concert tell their future concert goers to schedule an appointment with a doctor as they boast of different kinds of damage that their instruments will do, including bassist Haraguchi saying that "the heavy sound of my bass will make all your bodily fluids come out of your ass".
-   The Octobass is a musical instrument designed for classical performance which is effectively an eleven-foot tall double bass. It only requires three strings, and its size is such that for fret work, the fingerboard is operated remotely via a system of switches and capos, as the performer would otherwise be physically incapable of reaching. It plays bass notes which are inaudible to the human ear as they are pitched so low, and the effect can only be felt. It was designed, in fact, to be felt as a whole-body experience and not perceived via the ears. Only seven examples were ever built, and one is occasionally used in performance by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Some plants are said to have this power:
    -   The root of the mandrake plant looks a bit like a tiny person. Naturally, people were afraid it would scream if cut, then that it would scream if ever dug up, and finally that if anyone heard it scream, they would die. In some cases, violently.
    -   They say that Bluebell flowers will make a sound when there is wind. They say that the bells toll your death, after you hear it, you die on the spot.
-   There's the Irish legend of the harp of Daghda, which could cause pain, laughter, or peace through music.
-   The Basilisk and/or Cockatrice take this trope to a new level:<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   They are small and can easily hide and sneak about and pop up anywhere, they are pure evil, they must come into this world by unnatural means (often by a **rooster** laying an egg), and to meet their gaze is to drop dead on the spot. Or to turn into stone. Or they kill/petrify you just by _looking at them_. Or by touching you or breathing on you. Or they leave a path of desolation ("creating a desert") wherever they walk. Or... it may be easier at this point to say that the Reptiles Are Abhorrent trope is very old, and has much to do with the wildly exaggerated dangerousness of poisonous snakes.
    -   They're so deadly that _even trying to stab them transmits their Brown Note to you_. As Lucan wrote, "What though the Moor the Basilisk hath slain, and pinned him lifeless to the sandy plain, up through the spear the subtle venom flies; the hand imbibes it, and the victor dies."
    -   There is one definite Brown Note connected to the basilisk legends: the crow of a rooster will kill it.
-   Greek Mythology:
    -   The sight of Medusa and her Gorgon sisters turns you into stone. In most versions, this power remains with her hideous visage even after she's been beheaded, and it ends up mounted on Athena's shield or breastplate for exactly that reason. Medusa was killed by the hero Perseus who had (along with various god-given tools) a mirrored shield — not to reflect her gaze back _NetHack_ style, but to look into, so he could aim his sword to kill her without looking directly at her.
    -   The Sirens are like an auditory version of the Gorgons, as they lure sailors to their death with their song.
    -   Seeing the true form of the Greek Gods was said to have this effect on mortals. One of the more famous cases being when Semele, a human princess, was tricked by Hera into convincing Zeus to reveal his true form to her since he had been coming to her in the night in disguise. When he finally relented and threw off his disguise, she was incinerated instantly. Since the gods by and large did not want to wipe out humanity, the desire not to kill humans forces the gods to enact a masquerade Thankfully, her demigod fetus was immortal so Zeus was able to take it and bring it to term in his thigh and eventually gave birth to Dionysus.
-   The cobra was long believed to be able to hypnotize its prey with its gaze and movements.
-   The Pied Piper could lure victims anywhere with his music, including to their own certain deaths. Yeah, using it on rats was hailed as a public service, but: he used it on _children_ when their parents wouldn't pay him as agreed.
-   There are oodles of urban legends about a house of horrors exhibit which pays you back part of the admission price for every floor of the building's unimaginable contents you clear. The typical version of the legend has it that no one so far has ever fully managed the task, though some people have been found dead of fright on the fifth and final floor. According to Snopes, there is no known evidence for any real life basis for this legend.
    -   The eyes of cemetery statue "Black Aggie" are said to glow bright red in the middle of the night, either blinding or killing anyone who looks into them. (source)
-   Seeing the full glory of God is harmful for mortals; none can see God's face and live. Moses asked to see God's face, and after explaining the aforementioned, God placed him in a crevice and passed over while showing His back to Moses. That was enough to make Moses' face shine when he went down. Saul saw God's light while on his way, and closing his eyes during the encounter still rendered him blind. On the other hand, the Beatitudes mentioned how the pure of heart are blessed, for they will see God.
    -   David's harp playing drove out evil spirits, particularly from Saul
-   The draugr of Icelandic mythology are an interesting example, because though the sight of them is a Brown Note, not everyone responds the same way. Some are "merely" driven mad by them while others scream uncontrollably until they eventually die of exhaustion. Some people aren't affected at all, although the only way to guarantee that is to have Heroic Resolve.

    Podcasts 

-   The podcast _2020: Worst Year Ever_ has a Played for Laughs example with co-host Cody Johnston's attempt at making a time machine noise, which despite only showing up once so traumatized the hosts they keep bringing it up episodes later.
    
    **Robert Evans:** I can just... I can hear our listener numbers plummeting... Listening in their cars with their stereos all the way up, just started vomiting at the side of the road.
    
-   _Kakos Industries_:
    -   Episode 6, "Echoes", has Corin tell the story of the Echo Tree Forest, which is now off-limits after a man stubbed his toe and went insane from the Echo Trees repeating his own scream back at him. When the company sends their body-collectors-who-happen-to-be-deaf, they complete their job but, despite being unable to hear the screaming, also complained about a cold vibration inside of their bones.
    -   Any exposure to the contraption is capable of driving people into obsessive fits simply by its ambiguity. It somehow inspires two scientists to try and kill one another, the one that lost having their blood poured into the device only to get the same baffling results as before. Corin in particular spends over a month set on learning what secret it's holding and points out how terrifying he finds it.
-   Creating these is the goal of Zoey Evans in _On the Threshold_ through VR environments. Specifically she's tried to induce "the inversion of religious ecstasy" through her Cathedral of Bar Shacath and "mnemonokyklosia" through her newest project.

    Radio 

-   A very weird example Played for Laughs as a Running Gag twice per episode is from _Car Talk_. At the end of every episode or when going to a commercial break half way though, one of the hosts of the show would say "And even though (random person has a humorous negative reaction) every time they hear us say it, this is NPR, National Public Radio."

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_ has several:
    -   Tren Krom and Anonna, Eldritch Abominations that can potentially drive people who see them insane.
    -   The Klakk's scream, which can cure Shadow Matoran of their corruption.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Fate/stay night_ has Ea acting as this for Shirou. On seeing it he instinctively attempts to use Structural Grasp on it, but due to its divine origins and composition his mind overloads and he temporarily loses all senses. However, Shirou can apply Structural Grasp to plenty of other objects that were "merely" made by gods; Ea, however, was forged from the unlivable hell that was the earliest days of the earth and predates the very concept of "Sword" — it can only be called a sword because the world has no term for what Ea is other than "Ea". And in a setting where age=power...
    -   In _Fate/EXTRA_, Elisabeth Bathory's singing is physically painful to hear, and her cooking can induce near-death experiences.
