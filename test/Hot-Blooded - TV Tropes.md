_"_(draws sword) _Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen up, ya gigantic bozos! Having left his homeland, he_ never _yields,_ never _retreats, and_ never _regrets! He faces forward, and never looks back! He's_ manly! _He's tenacious! Kamina of Team Gurren is here to take you on! Bring it!"_

They are burningly passionate about everything that they do. They give their all in absolutely everything, regardless of the task. They do not know how to be half-hearted or lackadaisical about anything they care about. These characters are Hot-Blooded.

Using the power of guts, determination, and badassery they throw themselves headfirst into the worst situations imaginable and come out on top through _sheer force of will_ and often have a strong tendency to do impressive things. Even non hot-blooded characters or the nicest ones can occasionally have their own hot-blooded incidents; this is frequently their Moment of Awesome.

Beware if they go into an Unstoppable Rage or Tranquil Fury; someone's _really_ managed to piss them off. Triple that for elemental or Personality Powers; they're likely Playing with Fire. Especially common in the Super Robot Genre. The hot-blooded person is usually, though not always, identifiable by a mane of scarlet hair and/or Hot Blooded Sideburns. A common trait of The Ace and, to a lesser degree, the Boisterous Bruiser. This trait is a staple of Choleric characters in a Four-Temperament Ensemble.

Compare with the:

-   Ax-Crazy, if the hot-blooded character is mentally deranged.
-   Large Ham, which is about extreme expression, with or without extreme emotion.
-   Genki Girl which is about being excitable.
-   Keet which is the Spear Counterpart to Genki Girl.

Not to be confused with My Blood Runs Hot, which is when a character has _literal_ hot blood, though at least some of these characters may be metaphorically Hot Blooded as well.
