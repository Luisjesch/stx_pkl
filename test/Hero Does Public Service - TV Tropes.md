**Detective Kevin Ryan:** Your alibi checked out.  
**Detective Tom Demming:** Thank you.  
**Ryan:** _\[to Castle et al.\]_ He really was coaching an underprivileged youth basketball league.  
**Demming:** Well, for what it's worth, my kids won that night.

You know them well. They're people with public service at heart. When they aren't saving the world from evil aliens trying to tear a hole in the space-time continuum, they're helping old Mrs. Reed weed her garden. Their humility is admirable, and they are a lesson for us all.

This can apply to mundane heroes such as police officers just as easily as it can to superheroes. Coaching kids' sports leagues is a very common choice for the extracurricular activity, since it lets them show off their athleticism while at the same time doing good in the community.

This activity often serves as a plot hook if whomever they're helping by this activity then becomes involved in something pertaining to the hero's day job. For example, cop shows often have the protagonist helping community centers and so forth in poor neighborhoods, and the kids they help often end up entangled with gangs from which the hero must extricate them.

Because good feels good, heroes usually find these activities relaxing and fun and a good vacation from their normally stressful lives.

Expect a Small Steps Hero to do this often, as well as The Paragon and anyone seeking to be A True Hero. Beware of Holding Out for a Hero, though, when the citizens become complacent.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Sailor Venus, both in _Sailor Moon_ and _Codename: Sailor V_ does this often. Aside for being the one confirmed blood donor of the Sailor Soldiers (having started on-page in _Codename: Sailor V_, and being seen doing it again in the first anime), she's going to help _anyone_ in need, no questions asked-no matter if she'd just like to go home and rest after having donated enough blood she should be _dead_, climbed a building, destroyed the Monster of the Week and climbed down in the last ten minutes and is only standing thanks to eight _cans_ of tomato juice (and yes, that specific event actually happened).
-   In _My Hero Academia_, this is a fairly common view among the more decent pro heroes.
    -   All Might makes Izuku clean an abandoned, trash-ridden beach as his first step towards becoming a hero. When Izuku asks why, All Might declares that the original heroes did volunteer work to help communities rather than just punching supervillains. Not only would this exercise make him a proper vessel for One For All, but it would also instill in him the values that every superhero should embody. Showing Izuku's Determinator status, he went above and beyond what All Might wanted him to, cleaning the _entire_ beach and not just one-third.
    -   Kirishima and Tetsutetsu's internship with Fourth Kind consisted of doing public service for much the same reason, minus the 'vessel for One for All' bit.
    -   The level and amount of contribution to society is one of the main factors for ranking Pros in the Hero Billboard Charts.
    -   In the second movie, _My Hero Academia: Heroes: Rising_, the hero work _is_ public service. UA sends Class 1A to work as heroes on the small island of Nabu. But since the island is so peaceful, their jobs mostly consist of lifeguard duties, finding lost items, and helping out with household chores.

-   _New Avengers_: The Avengers take time in between adventures with cosmic level threats to stand on street corners in bad neighborhoods to help make people feel more secure and let small-time crooks know they're not below them.
-   _Nightwing (Infinite Frontier)_: Dick spends his spare time funding and managing the Haven, a multipurpose drop-in center to help all the needy of Bludhaven. It reaches the point where Blockbuster and other criminal elements see Dick Grayson as a greater threat to their control of the city than Nightwing.
-   _Red Robin_: Tim is very involved in the Wayne Foundation's Gotham Knights program, which aims to open a bunch of community centers in less fortunate neighborhoods of Gotham.

    -   In another story, Jen Walters volunteers with Green Cross (an organization devoted to helping victims of the Hulk's actions) to clean up the town that she herself trashed during one of her own rampages. Initially, she works incognito, but ultimately comes out as She-Hulk to expose a woman who's trying to use She-Hulk's actions to cover up her murdering her husband.

-   _Superman_: Superman is known for this. What makes him special amongst the superhero ranks is that no job is too big or too small for him. One day, he's halfway across the galaxy fighting a universal threat. The next, he's reading books to orphans or planting gardens. In one issue, a little girl is lost in an airport and crying because she can't find her mom. A figure in shadow offers to help her and you assume the worst. Cut to the next page and it's Superman. He calms the little girl and tells her that he'll help find her mom. After carrying the little girl on his shoulders as they float above the people in the airport, Superman picks up the shouts of the girl's mother. After reuniting them, the woman apologizes to Superman for troubling him and saying he must have more important things to do. Superman simply responds with "Honestly? I can't think of anything more important".
-   _Wonder Woman_ has always had an interest in civic duty, helping out students in most iterations in reading, science and sports programs.

    Fan Works 

-   _Red Fire, Red Planet_: One Infodump mentions that Brokosh, C.O. of the IKS _mupwI'_, started a sort of community center in one of the slums on the fringes of First City on Qo'noS with two other KDF-aligned Lethean mercenaries and a Romulan Republic officer named Makus. Unfortunately he also doesn't think it'll do a whole lot of good without some help from the Klingon High Council.
-   _Child of the Storm_: Steve Rogers, being the All-Loving Hero he is, literally rescues kittens from trees when not leading his team against the Monster of the Week. In a slight twist, Loki has created an information network composed of the homeless, taxi drivers, and cleaners, partially because they're everywhere, socially invisible, and see and hear everything, and partially because he does genuinely feel bad about his actions during his Evil Overlord phase. In one go, he can become world-renowned as a philanthropist, genuinely help thousands of people across the world, and set up a network of informants to boot.
-   The _Doctor Who_ fanfiction "Safe in the Knowledge" shows the Seventh Doctor take a break from fighting Eldritch Abominations and Evil Overlords to bend the Laws of Time and save a woman who otherwise would have been beaten to death by a drunken husband that night, who would have sobered up, realized what he did, and killed himself, leaving an orphaned baby girl.
-   _Night Shift_ has doing this be Ladybug's favorite part of the job. Not fighting demons, but using her abilities to help at soup kitchens and deliver presents.
-   In _Neither a Bird nor a Plane, it's Deku!_, All Might's Chronic Hero Syndrome makes him help anyone in need. Whether it's stopping a bank robbery, saving people from a burning house, or just helping a cat stuck in a tree, no job is too large or too small for the World's Greatest Hero.
    
    **All Might:** Hello there, citizens! I am the man who needs no introduction, but here it is, anyway! I am All Might! The Number One Hero in the world! I'm the guy that everyone can count on to help them out of a jam. House burning down? I'm there! Royal Flush Gang robbing a bank? I'm there! Cute kitty cat caught in a tree? You better believe I'm there!

-   In _My Huntsman Academia_, Izuku runs out to grocery shop for a few hours in the sidestory, "Charitable Disadvantages". It turns into an all-day affair once his Chronic Hero Syndrome kicks in.

    Literature 

-   Played with in the _Discworld_ novel _Jingo_, where Captain Carrot first appears playing football with disadvantaged kids... where this means two of the nastiest street gangs in the city who are only going along with this because Carrot has that kind of effect on people. Once Carrot's left and the spell wears off, the only thing stopping war breaking out is how embarrassed they all are by the past hour, so they'd prefer to pretend it never happened.
-   Every last character in the _Village Tales_ novels who's not irredeemably rotten does this. Seaside holiday for the children? The Duke, the Rector, and the Deputy Headmaster have it covered. Hampers of food for those down with 'flu? Lady Crispin will be there, with her maid. Intervening to reform … by any means necessary … a drunkard and spousal abuser? The curate, Fr. Bohun, will step in: less as second-career clergyman than as Sir Gilbert Bohun Bt MC, late Major, the Blues and Royals. Commandeering the brewery to make fruit squash and lemonade for the care home when a delivery goes astray? The Duke and Lady Crispin strike again: enlisted by the Rector. Taking the youths for footy? Senior curate Fr. Campion, enlisting the aid of retired Premier Leaguer and JP, Edmond Huskisson. Even the postman stops on his rounds to change a light-bulb for an old lady with rheumatism.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Blue Bloods_:
    -   When Mayor Carter Poole takes office, he reveals to Frank Reagan that he wants to keep him on as police commissioner partly because, back when he was a kid, there was this white Irish beat cop who coached his basketball team.

-   _Castle (2009)_:
    -   Exploited in "Den of Thieves". Tom Demming, a detective from Robbery, is briefly suspected by Beckett, Castle, et al. to be the Killer of the Week. Demming alibis out on account of he was coaching an underprivileged youth basketball league at the time of the murder.
    -   In "Under the Influence" one of the persons of interest is a fourteen-year-old kid with Parental Abandonment issues who already has a pretty big juvie record. At the end of the episode, Detective Esposito starts mentoring him because he had a similar Dark and Troubled Past but was saved by a teacher who took an interest.
-   In _Adam-12_, Pete Malloy is shown coaching kids' basketball in one episode. It turns into Pete and Jim trying to help a drug-addicted player before it's too late. The kid's brother gets into the guy's stash and dies.

-   Parodied in the _Sirens_ episode "A Bitch Named Karma", where the guys are sent to teach kids CPR, but try to speed their way through it, because they've scored tickets to a game on the same day.

-   _Wonder Woman_: In "Fausta the Nazi Wonder Woman", Wonder Woman uses a carnival hammer and bell machine to set the goal for a bond drive. She launches the bell into the stratosphere.
    
    **Wonder Woman:** The sky's the limit when it comes to buying bonds!
    
-   Several team members on _Criminal Minds_ also do community service-type things in their spare time. Garcia runs a grief counselling group for families of crime victims (which has become plot relevant in two episodes), JJ volunteers with new moms, Morgan unofficially mentors a kid back in his hometown of Chicago, and Hotch coaches his son's soccer team with Rossi as an assistant. And if you want to stretch it a little bit, Gideon and Blake both taught at the FBI academy in between cases. It sort of makes you wonder how any of them have time for a personal life.
-   On _CSI: NY_ Sheldon Hawkes, a former MD and ME, volunteers at a clinic and as a medic in Central Park on his days off.

    Video Games 

-   In _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II_, Rean Schwarzer is usually the gofer to help out the student council throughout the games, though that doesn't play this trope straight. What makes him play this straight is after becoming Erebonia's national hero, the "Ashen Chevalier", he still helps out the student council despite Towa insisting that he should rest as he just finished helping out at Crossbell.
-   _Final Fantasy XIV_ heavily enforces this. The player character is always tasked with ending world or large scale threats and are generally more than happy to help random people with their problems or chores such as culling a few monsters blocking the way or retrieving a lost item. Many NPCs that learn of the player character's godly status are amazed and grateful that someone like the player is willing to take a few minutes of their day to help them with menial tasks. Later quests that have the same characters show up will remember the deeds the player character had done for them in the past. Later expansions, particularly involving the Dark Knight job quests, suggest that the player character resents some of the people who ask for his help for the paltry rewards (if any) they get and feel that some people need to do things on their own.

-   In _Strong Female Protagonist_, Allison Green (formerly Mega-Girl) is a volunteer firefighter.
-   In _We Are The Wyrecats_, the team gets its start just trying to make the world a better place. After K.A. wakes up from her coma, she spends a good deal of time playing this role, trying to reclaim some semblance of the ideals she held.
