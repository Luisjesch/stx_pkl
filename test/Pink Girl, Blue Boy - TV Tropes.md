You can tell which is the boy and which is the girl; as if their colors weren't already obvious enough for you.

_"Girls that wore pink  
And boys that wore blue  
Boys that always grew up better men  
Than me or you."_

In fiction, and also in Real Life, we tend to differentiate between "girly" colors and "boyish" ones. This is most obvious with babies, as we are prone to see girls dressed in pink and boys in blue. This kind of dichotomy is, in fact, relatively new, and has not been wholly consistent across time and place.

Prior to the Industrial Revolution and the development of synthetic dyes, rich saturated colors were expensive and time consuming to produce, thus limiting their use to those who could afford the high costs. Even into the 20th century, clothing for infants and toddlers – including among the upper classes – was often simply undyed or based on the natural hues of their fabrics (this was likely a case of Boring, but Practical, as such clothes would need to be washed much more frequently).

However, by the 19th century, distinctive color codes based on gender had started to emerge:

-   The French were happy with a girl in pink and boy in blue by 1823, as childbirth should be "announced in this manner, and when the pincushion is pink background, this is a sign of the coming into this world a little girl, while the blue background pelotte announces that it is a boy." Cour de Hollande sous le règne de Louis Bonaparte, by Athanase Garnier, 1823)
-   By the 1880s it was established that pink was generally for girls, while blue was for boys in Anglo-Saxon countries.
-   Prior to WWII, a family's economic status was likely to affect color choice more than actual preference. However, at the same time, Germanic countries tended to view pink as associated with baby boys, because it's derived from red, which is considered a good masculine color. Blue, meanwhile, was considered to be feminine (and True Blue Femininity often still applies), as it was associated with the Virgin Mary.

Note that lots of female characters have had a pink motif that they wear with pride and sheer badassery. Male characters as well, because Real Men Wear Pink. However, pink is sometimes considered too childish and disrespectful, especially to an adult woman, so red may be substituted. When it comes to eroticism, pink can be applied to both.

If there are Two Girls to a Team and one is represented by pink, the other girl will usually be represented by purple. A purple girl can be a goth, tomboy, or Proper Lady, while the pink girl is usually a Girly Girl and/or a Genki Girl. Purple has a variety of associations, not limited to Purple Is Powerful and Graceful Ladies Like Purple — it's also indicative of nobility and, by extension, nobility of character.

Can crop up in many Boys' Love and Girls' Love stories; the active partner (_Seme_ in BL, _tachi_ or _Onee-sama_ in GL) is unlikely to wear "girly" colors such as pink, but the passive partner (_Uke_, _neko_) frequently does, and (especially in GL but sometimes in BL) may even have pink hair.

A Sub-Trope of Pink Means Feminine, Tertiary Sexual Characteristics, and Color-Coded Characters.

Compare Tertiary Sexual Characteristics, Red Oni, Blue Oni, Colour-Coded for Your Convenience, Pink Is for Sissies, Group-Identifying Feature, and Princesses Prefer Pink.

Not to be confused with Blue Boy.

    Advertising 

-   Several Pull-Ups commercials have depicted boys wearing blue shirts and girls wearing pink shirts.
-   The second Snuggie commercial featured the generic grandfather, father, and son (and dog) with dark blue snuggies. The grandmother, mother and daughter had pink snuggies.
-   This British Telecom commercial has an old woman discussing the trope of blue and pink being considered boy and girl colors respectively while complaining about her daughter choosing to have her own daughter wear blue. Eventually, the grandmother decides to apologize to her daughter and compromise by suggesting that her granddaughter wear yellow.
-   A Canadian campaign for Rice Krispies pitted Snap, Crackle and Pop against Ms. Pink, a marketing executive who was insistent of changing the blue cereal boxes pink, much to the horror of the boys. A campaign was created for the commercials to vote whether the boxes would stay the same or change colors. Blue won out.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Battle Spirits Shonen Toppa Bashin_: This is applied to Card Sensei and Masako, the protagonists' male and female teachers, in their younger days. Flashbacks show Masako wearing Card Sensei's signature blue sweatsuit, but in pink. These are also their eye colors.

-   _Beyblade Burst_: Nika has pink hair, while her twin brother, Toko, has blue hair.
-   _Bleach_: During the final two arcs, Toshiro Hitsugaya and his female lieutenant Rangike Matsumoto both wear scarves. Toshiro's is turquoise (a mixture of pale blue and green) while Rangiku's is pink. Toshiro's ice blasts are blue as well.
-   _The Blue Bird_: The 1980 anime version has Tyltyl in a blue jacket and white shirt and Mytyl in pink overalls/dress over a white shirt.

-   _Chaos;Head_: Rimi has pink hair and Takumi has blue.
-   _Chou Kuse ni Narisou_: ("I'll make a habit of it"), Nagisa Shiratori (pink hair) and her Love Interest, Nosaka (blue hair).
-   _Deltora Quest_: Jasmine wears red tights, while Lief wears a blue tunic and has a blue cloak.
-   _Digimon_:
    -   _Digimon Adventure_ — Gabumon and Biyomon are a male blue-furred reptile and a female pink-feathered bird respectively. There are also Angemon and his Distaff Counterpart, Angewomon; the former has blue cloth on his sleeves and pants and the latter wears a pink shawl. In _Digimon: The Movie_, their Mega forms are an angel in blue armor and a dragon with pink fur respectively. On the human side, we have Tai who wears a blue shirt and Mimi who wears a pink hat and even dyes her hair pink in the sequel show. Tai's little sister Kari also has some pink in most of her clothing.
        -   When it comes to Angemon, when they both are in their ultimate rank Magnaangemon is purple.
    -   _Digimon Adventure 02_: Davis and TK have blue Digivices and clothing respectively while Yolei and Kari have red and pink clothing respectively. Yolei also has purple hair and in the epilogue is married to Ken who has blue hair.
    -   _Digimon Tamers_: Henry and Suzie Wong have green and pink digivices respectively. Also, Henry has blue hair while Suzie wears a pink cheongsam-style vest.
    -   _Digimon Frontier_: Koji and Zoe wear blue and pink in human form, and their Digimon forms are also decked out in blue and pink.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
-   _Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai_: Leona and Maam wear pink. Dai wears blue.
-   _Full Moon_: Takuto and Meroko. Takuto is blue and Meroko is red (in the manga she wears black) but she keeps the pink hair. Averts the trope of happy pink girl×stoic blue boy because they are not a couple, (no matter how much Meroko wishes it).
-   _Gurren Lagann_: Played absolutely straight with Yoko and Kamina.<small>◊</small>
-   _Godannar_: Shows up frequently, with just about each of the couples/partners' pilot suits, notably Goh and Anna. Even the more masculine of the two American female robot pilots were darker colors than her cohort (whose pink-and-white costume barely qualified as clothing).
-   _Gundam_ (Pops up a lot):
    -   In the original _Mobile Suit Gundam_ and in _Gundam SEED_, The Federation had blue uniforms for male enlisted personnel and pink for females (officers wore brown or white regardless of sex). Later in the latter series, Cagalli gets a pink Gundam of the same type as Kira's(Blue-On-White) first suit.
    -   In _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_, the protagonist's fighting uniform is black with red, yellow, and blue highlights. His girlfriend's suit is predominantly pink.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_ has Shinn mostly piloting blue Gundams and his eventual girlfriend Lunamaria piloting a pink-ish Ace Custom until their respective Mid Season Upgrades (well, Passing the Torch in case of the latter, who inherits the former's Gundam).
    -   Both Cosmic Era shows feature the blue-haired Athrn Zala engaged to a rose-haired girl. After he and original fiancee Lacus Clyne calls off their engagement, she eventually settles for Athrun's best friend Kira Yamato, who as The Hero of the series, pilots the (mostly) traditionally blue Gundam(s).
    -   In _Gundam 00_, Soma Peries got a pink mobile suit in Season 1 and Nena Trinity wore a pink pilot's suit. In Season 2, they switch to red and purple, respectively. Played straight by Louise Halevy and Saji Crossroad<small>◊</small> in Season 1, as well as Setsuna F. Seiei<small>◊</small> and Feldt Grace<small>◊</small> in Season 2. Setsuna and Feldt get bonus points for piloting blue Gundams with matching blue pilot suit and being a Rose-Haired Sweetie respectively.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_: Hayate and Hinagiku. It's especially noteworthy as it completely subverts the girly pink-haired girl/stoic blue-haired guy dynamic (just don't tell that to Hinagiku) as Hayate is quite emotional at times and is noted for being very girly while Hinagiku is generally pretty tough and acts more boyish. Like the above example, Hina proves that girly pink can be very badass and Hayate shows that being a slightly feminine Bishōnen is also no handicap on that front.
-   _Hidamari Sketch_: The Faceless Masses are often colored this way, whether they're hairless and limbless, shaped like restroom signs, or detailed in the outline but still a solid color.
-   _Jewelpet_:
    -   In various seasons there is the couple of Ruby and Granite. Both have wholly white fur, with the insides of their ears and accessories being pink and blue, respectively. Eye colors sort of count; Ruby's are red while Granite's are blue.
    -   Inverted in the case of King and Lapis, who were a couple in the first season. King is the pink boy to Lapis' blue girl.
-   _Katri, Girl of the Meadows_: Almost all the named female characters wear some form of pink (Katri, Ulla, Emilia, Sofia, Lotte, Alina...) while many male characters such as Akki and Pekka wear blue.
-   _Kamisama Minarai: Himitsu no Cocotama_: Two notable instances of this trope.
    -   The twin Cocotamas Saline and Paline are respetively a pink female and a blue male.
    -   Two members of the Noratama Trio are a magenta female named Yurano and a male with dark blue fur named Tokumaru.
-   _Macross Delta_ has The Hero Hayate associated with blue (his Valkyrie is painted blue, he has blue hair with a blue flight suit) and the Idol Singer Freyja associated with pink and red (her Rune is pink, and her Walkure uniform is primarily red with pink and yellow highlights). Fittingly for the trope, these two eventually become the Official Couple.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_: In the original mini-scenario of the _Triangle Heart 3: Sweet Songs Forever_ Lyrical fanbox, Nanoha and Chrono were rivals that became an Official Couple, with Nanoha having a pink motif and Chrono having a blue motif. These motifs were retained in The Anime of the Game even though the two of them weren't the Official Couple there anymore. Chrono's blue motif eventually led to him becoming An Ice Person. Meanwhile, Nanoha's pink motif...well, the anime producers had _way too much fun_ with Nanoha's pink motif by turning her into a pink Person of Mass Destruction with a pink Wave-Motion Gun that fires giant pink beams that create huge pink explosions that have left many people metaphorically crapping their pants as they stare into her pink glowy light. Girly pink is badass.
-   _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_: Has Aladdin's parents blue-haired Solomon and his eventual lover pink-haired Sheba.
-   _More Than a Married Couple, But Not Lovers_ Interestingly, while Akari has pink hair and Jiro has bright blue hair, they both have the reverse for their eyes: Akari having blue eyes and Jiro having pink. It's likely a nod to their Savvy Guy, Energetic Girl dynamic.
-   The Beta Couple from _My Senpai Is Annoying_ includes the sweet Sakurai whose color motif is pink and the stoic Kazama whose color is blue.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Sakura (pink-haired, dresses in pink and red) and Sasuke (blue-black hair, dresses in shades of deep blue). Naruto also wears blue along with his signature orange in Part I as a contrast to Sakura.
    -   Gender Inverted with Naruto and Hinata in Part II. Hinata's signature color is purple, which clashes with Naruto's orange.
    -   Also Gender Inverted with Jiraiya and Tsunade — Tsunade wears blue and green, while Jiraiya wears red.
    -   Rin wore a pink apron, while both Obito and Kakashi wore blue.
    -   Downplayed with Naruto's parents, Minato and Kushina.<small>◊</small> While Kushina does have red hair to contrast with Minato wearing blue, she also primarily wears green, a color closer to blue than pink.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   As the Strawhats are color coded this comes in, Nami often wears pinks and reds and Robin wears purples while Luffy has blue shorts, Sanji wears blue and Franky has blue hair.
    -   Tashigi wears pink which contrasts to Smoker (blue), the same goes for Smoker and Hina.
    -   Koala and Sabo.
    -   The Vinsmoke family,<small>◊</small> eldest daughter "Poison Pink" Reiju and second son "Electric Blue" Niji.

-   _Pokémon: The Series_:

    -   Misty is red-haired and wears red suspenders while Ash wears a blue jacket and pants.
        -   Continued with May (red) Dawn (pink), Iris (pink bow and stripes around her clothes), and Serena (red and pink).
        -   While Lillie usually wears all white (though her backpack is pink), her Ultra Guardian uniform is pink while Ash's is blue, continuing the trend.
-   _Princess Mononoke_: Koroku the ox driver wears a blue tunic, while his wife Toki the iron-worker wears a reddish-pink one.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_: More often a case of The Girly Girl Madoka wearing pink and the Tomboy Sayaka wearing blue.
-   "Revolutionary Girl Utena" has Miki Kaoru (a boy who is associated with blue) and Utena Tenjou (a girl who has pink hair)
-   _Romeo and Juliet_ has a manga cover<small>◊</small> with Juliet wearing red and Romeo wearing blue.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Cheery, perky Sailor Moon has pink, silver, white, or yellow hair in the original manga. Her predestined lover Tuxedo Mask has, depending on the image, dark black, blue, green, or purple hair. When he is married to Sailor Moon, he has pastel purple hair, which appears to be a symbol of his healing due to being with her. As far as costuming is concerned, though, Sailor Moon herself wears white and blue while Tuxedo Mask wears black and red.
    -   The 1990s anime's Transformation Sequences for the Sailor Starlights involved the background and their bodies changing from blue to pink as they changed from their male disguises to their true female forms.
-   _Shugo Chara!_:
    -   Amu is a Pink Heroine with a very pink costume and hair color. On the other hand, Ikuto wears blue and has blue hair.
    -   Nagihiko's Guardian Characters, the very pink and (sort of) girlish Temari and the very blue and boyish Rhythm.
    -   Also, Seiyo Academy's school uniforms follow the pattern as well, with the girl uniforms being red and the boy uniforms being blue.
-   _Slayers_: Toyed with in regards to the two model couples: for Lina and Gourry, the latter wears blue while the former wears a light shade of magenta. For Zelgadis and Amelia, the latter is a princess who has both a pink dress for diplomatic duties and a modest traveling outfit with some pink touches, while the former is a chimera who literally has blue (or blue-green) colored skin.
-   _Speed Racer_: Title character (in both the anime and The Movie) typically wears blue and white, while his girlfriend Trixie dons pink and red. However, on formal occasions in the anime, Trixie would wear a blue dress while Speed wore a red blazer.
    -   This tradition continued in several other Tatsunoko productions, including _Time Bokan_ (Tanpei blue, Junko pink), _Superbook_ (Sho/Christopher blue, Azusa/Joy pink), _The Littl' Bits_ (Belfy/Lillabit red or pink, Rirubitto/Willibit blue), and _Paul's Miraculous Adventures_ (Paul blue, Nina pink). Interestingly the latter three had the same character designer (Akiko Shimomoto).
-   _Spider Riders_: This applies to the male and female lead, Hunter Steele and Corona. They wear a lot of blue and pink respectively in their battle armor, and each have a spider partner in these colors.
-   _Spirited Away_: Chihiro's mother wears a pink shirt, while her father wears a blue one.
-   _Sukisho_: A BL example are the title characters — with the uke having pink hair and eyes, while the seme has blue.
-   _Tokyo Mew Mew_:
    -   Anyone who couldn't see the Official Couple of _Tokyo Mew Mew_ coming may have ignored this fact. Not only do Ichigo and Masaya have pink and blue hair, respectively (only in the manga, though; the anime changes them to red and black), but their last names are **Momo**miya and **Ao**yama! (meaning "peach" and "blue" in Japanese respectively.)
    -   Even more ironic, the whole Tokyo Mew Mew team is _female_ and all the aliens are male. In the final battle, where Ichigo blasts her final attack, and Deep **Blue** releases the Mu Aqua, you can clearly see a clash of pink and blue.
-   _Toward the Terra_: The Mu children have pink dresses for girls and blue jumpsuits for boys. The adults all wear purple.
-   In _Ulysses 31_, the spacesuit sometimes worn by the titular character's son, Telemachus, is blue. Yumi, a young alien girl, sometimes wears a pink spacesuit.
-   _Wandering Son_: If you look at colored manga pages, and often the anime uses this motif. You'll notice it's not uncommon for male characters to wear blue and females pink. Considering the series is themed around gender, it makes sense.
-   _Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku_: Narumi is the pink girl to her boyfriend Hirotaka’s blue. Narumi has light pink hair while Hirotaka has dark blue hair and their attire reflects their respective color motifs.
-   _Trigun_: Inverted with Vash and Meyrl.<small>◊</small>
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: The school uniforms have the boys wearing blue jackets and pants and the girls wearing pink blazers.
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V_: Yugo and Rin have this dynamic when wearing their street clothes. Yugo has a blue t-shirt while Rin has a pink top.
        -   The 6th ending of the series gives us this shot,<small>◊</small> can you make out the blue and pink sillhouettes on the bottom? those are Zarc and Ray respectively the "originals" from whom the dimensional counterparts all got split from

-   _YoYo Man_ features Ludou and his sister Kelei, who have blue and pink hair respectively.

    Comedy 

-   Lampshaded and played within a stand-up routine by Israeli comedian Uri Hezkiah. In Hebrew, almost every word grammatically _has_ to have a gender, depending on who is spoken of or who is doing the speaking. Uri muses that since babies all look the same, the only way to know whether you should pick up your friend's baby and say "That's a cute baby boy" or "That's a cute baby girl" is whether it's dressed in blue or pink. He then says "But imagine you find a baby dressed in orange. What do you do? You can't risk offending your friend". After some thought, he picks up an imaginary baby and says "Why, that's a cute... organism!"

    Fan Works 

-   _Dread String of Fate_: Discussed when Marinette makes a pair of shawls for Luka and herself in blue and pink, matching their respective wardrobes. Luka comments that he wouldn't have minded if she'd just made two pink shawls, as he wouldn't mind wearing 'her colors'. They end up switching.
-   _Futari wa Pretty Cure Dragon_: Inverted to a degree by Ryan Lee and Susan Chan; the manly martial artist Ryan wears pink, and the Ojou and Lady of War Susan wears blue.
-   _Harry Potter_: Tonks usually went around with spiky pink hair. We don't see much of her son, Teddy, in the books, but he has clearly inherited her metamorph abilities and Fanon has largely agreed that his hair should be blue (this may be due to a photograph of him as a baby in _Deathly Hallows_ - the only direct image of him mentioned - with turquoise hair).
-   _Hellsister Trilogy_: Supergirl wears red cape, boots and skirt, and her love interest Dev-Em wears a dark blue suit.
-   _Lucy's Secret_: When Lucy is buying bedwetting pants, the boys' diapers are blue while the girls' are pink.

-   _Power Rangers: Shuriken Force_: Defied, where there is a Blue and a Pink Ranger, only Blue is a woman and Pink is a man. It's quite explicit as The Mentor personally gave them their colors.
-   _Rhythmic Pretty Cure_: At the karate school Hitomi and Tsumugi go to on Mondays and Thursdays, the boys' karategi is blue, and the girls' karategi is pink.
-   _Single Parents Night_:

    -   Inverted with Amy's parents. They are a pink male hedgehog and blueish-grey female elephant.

Played straight with Mikuru and Kyon; Mikuru's theme color is pink, and while Kyon's theme color is a dull brown (it even shows in his Cure costume), his aura as a Cure is blue.
-   _Total Drama Legacy_ has the brother-sister duo Marissa and Marlin. Marissa wears neon pink shorts, a black shirt with pink lettering on it, and neon pink sunglasses; by contrast, Marlin wears light blue shorts, a white shirt with a navy blue anchor on it, and navy blue flip-flops.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Barbie as Rapunzel_, when they meet, Rapunzel wears a pink dress, while Prince Stefan wears a blue prince getup.
-   _The Brave Little Toaster_: The first two cars to be crushed to death during the song "Worthless" are actually a male blue car and a female pink car, respectively.
-   Disney: Because Disney dates to the early decades of the 20th century, the idea that blue was feminine and pink/red was masculine appeared in several of their earlier creations. Some more recent films continue this trend, while others play the trope straight:
    -   _101 Dalmatians_: Pongo sports a red collar while Perdita who sports a blue one.
    -   _Aladdin_: Jasmine wears blue (except for her Go-Go Enslavement outfit) while Aladdin wears purple, which is derived from red.

        -   Played straight with Finn McMissile and Holly Shiftwell from the sequel. As with the kissing couple seen on the bridge in Paris.

    -   _Finding Nemo_: We have Marlin, an orangey-red clownfish, and Dory, a blue regal tang.
    -   _Lady and the Tramp_: Lady has a blue collar, and Tramp gains a red collar at the end of the movie.
    -   Minnie Mouse has been seen in many colors, but for most of her early color appearances, she wore blue as a contrast to Mickey's standard red shorts. The all-pink wouldn't emerge until the late Pluto cartoons. In modern animated appearances, Minnie bounces back and forth the most between wearing soft blue to contrast Mickey, or red to match him. The merchandise puts her in pink.
    -   _Peter Pan_: Wendy wears a blue nightdress, while her youngest brother Michael wears pink pajamas.
    -   _Pinocchio_: The Blue Fairy wears Exactly What It Says on the Tin, while the Coachman wears a red sweater.
    -   _Sleeping Beauty_: Aurora spends most of her movie in blue. The three good fairies weren't sure how to color code Aurora, as blue was the traditional feminine color while pink was the emerging feminine color. Prince Phillip brings a red cape and hat to the party. Disney Princess-gear Aurora always wears pink because Cinderella always wears blue.
    -   _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_: Snow White wears a blue bodice while her prince wears a red cape.
    -   _Tangled_: Rapunzel's mostly lavender dress is accented with pink, while Flynn Ryder wears blue.
    -   _Treasure Planet_: Captain Amelia wears a blue jacket while Dr. Doppler wears a red jacket.

    -   Even during his time in the Egyptian royal household, however, Moses’ clothes and jewelry were trimmed with red accents.
-   _Secret Magic Control Agency_: Inverted in this piece starring grown-up versions of Hansel and Gretel. Hansel sports a magenta suit, while Gretel wears a sky blue uniform. This carries over when they get turned into children, with Gretel wearing a dress in the same blue colour, and Hansel donning a magenta jacket.
-   _Trolls_: Poppy is a pink Troll and her eventual love interest, Branch, turns out to be a blue troll but he faded into grey from his grandmother's death.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl_: Sharkboy and Lavagirl wear blue and red respectively, with Lavagirl also having pink hair. This also comes with Color-Coded Elements as Sharkboy has water powers and Lavagirl has fire powers.
-   _Beauty and the Beast (2017)_: In the final scene of ballroom dancing, the newly un-enchanted prince wears a blue suit, and Belle wears a white gown covered with large pink-ish flowers.
-   _Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason_: Has the title character in a lot of girlier outfits than her literary counterpart, with pink items in rotation. This is in contrast to her boyfriend's blue business suits. This even shows up on the Poster and DVD covers for the film with a pink and rose-patterned clad Renée Zellweger is flanked by the blue-clad Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.
-   _Bright Star_: Upon their first meeting, Fanny Brawne is wearing a dress with a red jacket, and John Keats a blue coat. Several of their later encounters also feature them decked out in a red/pink and blue color scheme, respectively (though as a skilled seamstress, all of her costumes are unique, while as a struggling poet, he wore the same or a similar coat each time).
-   _But I'm a Cheerleader_: Very heavy-handed example. The protagonist is sent to a reform camp to "cure" her of her homosexuality. The color palette for male and female campers — clothes, props, and just about every aspect of their aesthetics — fits this trope to a "T" (not surprising, given the effort to push campers into stereotypical gender roles).
-   _The Classic_: Ji-hye wears a pink sweater vest and her Love Interest Sang-min wears a blue sweater during the scene where they run together from the rain.
-   _High School Musical_: While it's not very prominently featured, Sharpay and Ryan Evans occasionally play this trope. The gym scene from their _"I Want it All"_ song has them wear pink and blue sports outfits, while _"A Night to Remember"_ shows them getting ready in similarly colored bathrooms. Also, Sharpay is shown to ride a bright pink convertible, while Ryan has a blue motorbike.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:
    -   _Avengers: Age of Ultron_: Quicksilver dresses mainly in blues and greys and is trailed by a blue-white streak when running. Scarlet Witch predominantly wears reds and blacks and her powers manifest as a red aura when in use.
    -   _Avengers: Endgame_: Inverted. Pepper's Rescue armor is blue, while Tony's Iron Man armor is his usual red<small>◊</small>.
-   _Meet the Feebles_: Bletch is a dark-blue, male walrus, while his girlfriend, Heidi, is a pink, female hippo.
-   _The Nutcracker_ (1993): Inverted with the Polichinelles (child dancers who emerge from beneath Mother Ginger's enormous hoop skirt). Girls are dressed in blue and boys in pink.
-   _Prince Caspian_: The blazers of the Pevensie siblings' school uniforms; Peter and Edmund wear blue, while Susan and Lucy wear red.
-   _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_: Brad and Janet's bedrooms are lit with blue and link lighting respectively.
    -   Also how Brad and Janet dress at the start of _Shock Treatment_ sequel.

-   _Star Wars: The Phantom Menace_: While infiltrating the Naboo capital city of Theed, Padme Amidala signals Captain Panaka with a pink laser device, and he signals back with a blue one.

    Literature 

-   _Cookies and Crutches_: Inverted. Rachel Myers’ ice skates are white and decorated with blue pompoms. Her father’s are black with red pompoms.
-   _The Dark Tower_: Features the sentient monorail Blaine and his 'sister', Patricia. They feature the reversed color scheme: Patricia is blue, and Blaine is pink.
-   _The Da Vinci Code_: Both inverted and played straight at once. When pointing out details of Leonardo's famous fresco _The Last Supper_, Leigh Teabing draws attention to the mirror-imaged clothing worn by Jesus (red robe, blue cloak) and Mary Magdalene (blue robe, red cloak), symbolically indicating that they are a couple.
    -   While called "red" in the text to further emphasize the symmetry, on the real-life painting, Magdalene's cloak is distinctly pink (a lack of images in the original publication of the book likely necessitated this).
-   _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_: Played with in the dress robes worn by attendees at the Yule Ball:
    -   Harry Potter's robes were bottle green, while his date Parvati Patil wore shocking pink.
    -   Inverted with Ron Weasley and Padma Patil; he wore maroon and she wore bright turquoise.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: The uniforms for the students at the Royal Academy of Magical Study follow this convention: girls wear long pink dresses hemmed with gold and collars of darker pink while boys wear blue floor-length robes outlined in silver and dark blue ascots.
-   _Little Women_: Cited as popularizing this trope in Americans. When twins are born, the boy is put in blue and the girl is put in pink. This is stated to be "French fashion" (which refers to how, by the 1840s, this trope was already becoming commonplace in France).
-   _A Place Beyond Courage_: At their wedding, John Marshall wears a midnight-blue tunic, while his bride Sybilla of Salisbury wears a ruby-red gown.
-   _Time To_: In _Time to Pee!_, the signs that read, "Boys can stand" are blue, while the signs that read, "Girls should sit" are in pink.
-   _Xanth_: In one of the novels, the male and female main characters had switched bodies due to a magic spell gone wrong. When they manage to acquire clothes from a clothes tree, they take colors according to their mental gender, much to the confusion of their semi-sentient horse.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Ace Lighting_: Ace is male and shoots blue lightning. Sparx is female and shoots pink lightning.
-   Buffyverse
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The characters Tylos and Keara from the Fourth Doctor story "Full Circle" fit this trope. Tylos is a guy and wears blue, while Keara is a girl and wears pink. However, as they're aliens (specifically Alzarians) it's unlikely they attach any significance to this.
    -   In "Forest of the Dead", Donna's children Josh and Ella exhibit this, with him wearing blue and green and her wearing pink and red. This might be a hint at their virtual nature.
-   _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_: Made fun of in an episode where Ashley asks how they could tell from the sonogram if Vivian's baby was a boy or a girl.
    
    **Hilary:** Oh, Ashley, you are so naïve. If it's a boy, it's _blue_!
    
-   _Friends_: Faded Salmon is confused for being pink, and thus not a color for guys to wear.
    -   Ross and Rachel tape a pink bow to the had of their infant daughter because people keep mistaking Emma for a boy. It's a bow or have Rachel attack them for making the mistake. After making a comment about fashion Ross wonders if he should start wearing a blue bow.
    -   The triplets Phoebe gives birth to in the hundredth episode are two girls and a boy. The hospital puts pink hats on the girls and a blue one on the boy.
-   _Gladiators_: The Gladiator uniforms followed this pattern with the female Gladiators in pink uniforms while the male Gladiators wore blue. The final series dropped this for a gender-neutral red, white and blue color scheme.
-   _LazyTown_: The two main characters fit this trope. Stephanie wears pink and Sportacus wears blue.
-   _The Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nóg_: Inverted with the sigils of Kells (red field, ruled by King Conchobar) and Temra (bluish-purple field, ruled by Queen Maeve).
-   _NCIS_: When Tim McGee's twins Johnny (boy) and Morgan (girl) are born, they are wrapped in color-coordinated blankets and hats.
-   _The Office_: In one episode of the American version, an employee brings her baby boy to the office (dressed in pink). Pam tells the mother "she's so cute" only to have her say he's a he. When Pam explains she thought the baby was a girl because of the pink clothing the mother responds with "Pink is his favorite color."
-   _Raven's Home_: Used whenever Raven or Booker have visions. The former's are pink with hints of purple and red, while the latter's are shades of blue, gold and white.
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   While they were never lovers (_though they came close_) Rimmer has the blue officer outfit while Kochanski came back to the series in a sexy red outfit.
    -   In "Camille", Rimmer's ideal love is dressed in red.
-   _Scrabble_: The Game Show did this with its contestants' nametags.
-   _Smallville_: In earlier seasons, Lana always wore pink and Clark always wore blue.
-   _Stranger Things_: Subtle example Nancy wears a red jacket and Jonthan has a blue sweater.<small>◊</small>
    -   An unsubtle but no less sweet example would be Eleven in her dress and Mike.
-   _Super Sentai_ / _Power Rangers_:
    -   Pink Rangers are always female. Blue Rangers are often male, but have been female a number of times. Out of the most common suit colors (Red, Blue, Yellow, Pink, Green, Black, and White), Black is the only all-male color so far (except in _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_, see below), although there's been only two female Greens in _Kyuranger_ and _Kiramager_, while _Donbrothers_ has provided the first ever male Pink.
    -   Also, while the Pink Ranger is usually the Girly Girl, some seasons have been subverting this (starting with _Mirai Sentai Timeranger_ and _Power Rangers Time Force_, where Pink is the real team leader even if Red gets the official recognition). The most common inversion comes on teams with two girls, where Pink will be the level-headed Cool Big Sis while Yellow will be The Ditz.
    -   Interestingly, this also extends to _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_, where the Rangers have the power to assume the forms of their predecessors (complete with Distaff Counterpart costumes where necessary). Thus far, Pink Ranger Ahim is the only person to use any Pink Ranger Keys, while every other color has been used by people of both genders (except, again, for Green).
    -   This is averted _once_ in the Gokaiger Vs. Gavan movie, where the whole team change into pink Sentai warriors.
    -   _Power Rangers Zeo_: Prince Gasket, firstborn son of King Mondo of the Machine Empire, has an overall green aesthetic, while his wife Archerina has an overall pink one.
-   _The West Wing_: Toby Ziegler's newborn daughter and son are dressed in hats and blankets in these colors at the hospital which helps people tell them apart. During his first time alone with them, Toby delivers a touching speech that begins with "I didn't realise babies come with hats".

    Music

-   _The Noddy Shop_ has Whiny and Whimper, who are male and female babies dressed in blue and pink.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Dorf Quest_, boys are default black, girls are pink, gods are blue, and goddesses are purple.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _Game of Life_ board game is an example of this. Boy pegs are blue, girl pegs are pink. Interestingly, the rules say you have to put a second peg in your car when you get married, but they don't say what color the peg has to be.

    Toys 

-   All Malibu toys sell _Barbie_ toys in vibrant pink.
-   Inverted in _BIONICLE_. The females still retain the "pink" personality, but the majority of the female main characters are blue. And while there are no pink characters, the red ones are all male.
-   Fisher-Price:
    -   _Little People_ toys and playsets usually avert this, with characters wearing whatever they realistically would. However, Fisher-Price has started making all-pink sets. These are recolors of other molds that have more realistic colors.
    -   And not just Little People. If you look through the F-P toy line, you'll also see blatant examples of this. The _Laugh and Learn_ Puppy plush comes in both "regular" and "pink" versions (where the only difference is that the plush fur and ears is _pink_ — thankfully, they're fixing that — by giving Puppy a sister who has pink ears and _likes the colors pink and purple_). Heck, even their ill-fated _PowerTouch_ reader system came in silver and blue for boys, and _pink and purple_ for girls.
-   The 2008 Burger King _iDog_ Kids Meal Toys had a pink-colored iCat dressed in princess clothes and a blue-colored iCat dressed in a robot outfit.
-   Variant used in Leap Frog toys: Green for boys and purple for girls.
-   In all LEGO products, the boys's sets are advertised in blue boxes and the girls's sets are in pink boxes and consist of pink bricks. This has caused multiple complaints from girls and grown women alike, saying Lego shouldn't discriminated in their products.
-   Sanrio's ''Little Twin Stars'' is a classic example: just look at their hair.<small>◊</small>
-   _Squishmallows_: The original squad has a pair of penguins named Puff and Piper. Puff, the blue one, is a boy; Piper, the pink one, is a girl.
-   _Tamagotchi_:
    -   The matching _Mesutchi_ (girl) and _Osutchi_ (boy) toys initially came in pink and blue, respectively.
    -   The _TamagoChu_ was another release that came as a girl-boy pair of toys. The normal release was black and white, but the Ainori special release featured pink and blue devices.
    -   On the _m!x_, since all of the teens are available in both genders they have this coloration pattern for their default colors.
    -   Many of the male and female baby-stage pairs from the color releases come in blue and pink for their default colors:
        -   On the _Plus Color_, male Kinotchi has a blue cap and female Nokotchi has a pink cap.
        -   On the _iD L_, male Nittobotchi is blue and female Momoirotchi is pink.
        -   On the _P's_, male Aukomotchi is blue and female Pinkubotchi is pink.
        -   On the _4U+_, male Gaotchi is blue and female Yuraratchi wears a pink onesie and bow.
        -   On the _m!x_, male Tamabotchi is blue and female Tamapatchi is pink.
        -   On the _ON_, male Shizukutchi is blue and female Marupitchi is pink.
-   Many toys from V-Tech usually also fall squarely into this trope- many toys come in both pink for girls and blue for boys, and the only difference is the toy color. Other toys from the company tend to come in regular non-pastel shaded colors for boys, but still have a pink version aimed squarely at young girls.

    Video Games 

-   _Adventures of Lolo_: Lolo and Lala play this trope straight. Lala even wears a bow.
-   Maria Luna of _Backyard Sports_ loves the color pink and plays better when she wears it. In an aversion, Jocinda Smith loves blue.
-   In _Binary Land_, Gurin is a blue penguin and Malon is a pink penguin, in the Famicom version.
-   _Bubble Bobble_:
    -   One of the original two is the underdog Bob, who is a male human-turned-blue bubble dragon. His apparent partner in _Bubble Symphony_ (in cutscenes, she is _always_ beside Bob) is Coro, a female human-turned-magenta bubble dragon and one of the new group of two. Extended with green for Bub (a boy) and orange for Kulu (a girl), who are also beside each other in cutscenes.

-   _Cave Story_, Curly and Quote both wear red, but their guns are color-coded. Quote's starting pistol Polar Star is blue while Curly's machine is red, and PC remastered achievement calls it a _Girly Gun_.
-   _Command & Conquer: Generals_ has an... extreme variation on this trope amongst the USA faction: Normally, the faction's superweapon is a blue Pillar of Light being reflected off a satelite to form a Kill Sat system. But play as the female general from their faction, and the beam turns a lovely shade of pink.
    -   Said general is titled the "Superweapon General" however, so it is possible to handwave the color change as being part of some prototype technology.
-   _DanceDanceRevolution_: Player 1 is represented by a male character (e.g. Boldo as preset character in 3rdMix, Train as tutorial dancer for Beginner difficulty) and the color blue, while Player 2 is represented by a female character (e.g. Tracy as preset character in 3rdMix, Bus as tutorial dancer for Beginner difficulty) and the color pink.
-   _Danganronpa_:
    -   In _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, the boys' dorm rooms have blue sheets and the girls' rooms have pink sheets. Chihiro Fujisaki has blue sheets despite having presented himself as a girl until his murder, providing a hint to his true biological sex if you finish his Free Time Events.
    -   Generic residents of Towa City in _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_ are represented as featureless coloured silhouettes. Typically, females are pink and males are blue.

-   In the two games made by Dreaming Games, _Dreaming Mary_ and (the Quietly Cancelled) _Blue Dreams_, heavily emphasizes on the colors pink for the female protagonist in the former game and, well, blue for the male protagonist in the latter.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   In _Final Fantasy IV: The After Years_, Half-Identical Twins Palom and Porom wear blue and pink, respectively. Porom even has pink _hair_, despite Palom and her younger self both having brown hair.
    -   _Final Fantasy VI_ Terra wears red/pink while Locke and Edgar wear blue.
    -   _Final Fantasy VII_ has a subtle one with Cloud and Tifa, apart from clothing, Tifa has red eyes while Cloud has (mako infused) blue ones.
        -   The less subtle example is Aerith and the SOLIDER boys (Zack and Cloud) as she has her iconic bright pink dress while Zack and Cloud have the bluish SOLIDER-uniforms.
    -   _Final Fantasy Tactics Advance_ has Marche (the Blue Boy) and Ritz (the Pink Girl).
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII-2_: Serah in pink (and white, with lots of revealing holes) and Noel in blue for their original costumes.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   A creative take on this appears in _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_; While Roy and Lilina's outfits play this trope straight, as they wear blue and red respectively, their hair colours invert it instead. Only their eyes stay consistently blue, though.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones_, the under-leveled recruit Amelia wears pink in her portrait, yet wears blue in battle scenes. At least, until she achieves higher ranks, in which case she wears pink armor _even as a general_.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem_, the blue-haired and armored Hero Samson ends up in the services of the pink-armored General Sheena. They end up becoming Love Interests to each other. Also applies in the remake in regards to the General class: male Generals don blue armor in battle, while female Generals wear pink armor.
    -   In _Fire Emblem Heroes_, the Askr royal duo are color-coded. Alfonse has dark blue hair (with gold tips), his sword Fólkvangr is decorated with a light blue gemstone, and his special attacks surround him with a blue aura. Sharena, on the other hand, has blonde hair with pink tips (though it's hard to tell), has a pink gemstone in her spear Fensalir, and is surrounded by pink energy when she unleashes a special attack.
-   _Galaxy Angel_: The trope can be played straight in the first trilogy if Milfeulle is chosen as the romantic partner, as she provides the pink to the blue of Tact Mayers.
-   In _Game Builder Garage_, the two hosts of the Interactive Lessons mode are living pointers named Alice and Bob. Alice, having the feminine name, is colored pink while Bob (who bears the masculine name) is blue.
-   In _Golden Sun_, all three pairs of villains (with the possible exception of Agatio, who looks more green than blue) are dressed like this. There's also Jenna and Piers from the second game.
-   _Hidden City_: Rayden Storke and Kira Woodville, who are sent as the Upper City's representatives to find the Mystery Solver in the Lower region, respectively wears navy and magenta uniforms.
-   _I Was a Teenage Exocolonist_: Conversed by Tammy when she's pregnant with Echinacea. She remembers when babies used to be swaddled in pink blankets for girls and blue ones for boys, but she thinks it's ridiculous.
-   _Ice Climber_: Popo wears a blue parka while Nana wears a pink/red one.
-   _Kirby_: Lolo and Lala's Dream Land-dwelling Expies, Lololo and Lalala, are naturally also guilty of this. However, the title character of their series is a pink boy.
-   In _Klonoa_, particularly _Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil_, Klonoa, a rabbit-creature boy, wears a blue outfit, and his female priestess friend, Lolo, wears a pink outfit.
-   _Legendary Wings_ has Michelle Heart <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and Kevin Walker.
-   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III_ plays this straight with both Juna Crowford being the pink girl to Kurt Vander's blue boy, with their hair colors.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Princess Zelda, in _Ocarina of Time_, predominantly wears pink (like many of her ancestors and descendants). When disguised as the male-looking Sheik, however, she wears blue.
    -   Notably subverted in some of the games, however. Zelda wears blue and white in _A Link to the Past_, purple and white in _Twilight Princess_, and blue (like Link) in _Breath of the Wild_. Additionally, both the _Skyward Sword_ and _Breath of the Wild_ Zeldas have white ceremonial garb.
    -   The _BOTW_ Link actually both plays this straight and averts this. In his native games his Zelda wears blue alongside him but in _Smash_ the Zelda in that game wears pink. If supplemental material is to be believed he is just as willing to protect that Zelda as he is his own.
-   Both _Mega Man Battle Network_ and _Mega Man Star Force_ have the main character (Mega Man) decked out in blue and a close female friend (Roll and Sonia/Harp Note respectively) who wears pink.
-   In _Metal Gear Solid_, Snake is highlighted in blue while Meryl has red hair.
    -   _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_ Mistral has dark red hair and red/purple aura while Raiden has blue lighting and sword sword streaks. Until he becomes _Jack the Ripper_ again.
-   _Monster Hunter_:
    -   Two of the signature monsters of the series are Rathian and Rathalos, green and red wyverns that are respectively the female and male of the same species. Among the first subspecies you run into in most games from _Monster Hunter G_ onwards are Pink Rathian and Azure (blue) Rathalos.
    -   In an inversion, the red-and-pink Teostra are male, while the blue Lunastra are female.
-   _Mortal Kombat_:
    -   Inverted with Liu Kang and his love interest Kitana. He usually wears red while she wears blue.
    -   Played oddly-straight with Rain and Mileena. They're both associated with the color purple, but his outfits are a more bluish purple while hers are more red/magenta.
-   _Mr. Hopp's Playhouse 2_: Besides Mr. Hopp wearing blue pants, there is Mr. Stripes wearing a blue tie and Ms. Bo with a pink bow, pink pants, and pink markings.
-   _NiGHTS into Dreams…_, another SEGA franchise from Sonic Team, has Claris (pink hair and eyes) and Elliot (blue hair and eyes), both examples of Curtains Match the Window as well. And then NiGHTS itself is mostly purple and nobody can tell which gender it is.
-   Subverted in _Panel de Pon_; Sharbet and Elias both have primarily blue color schemes and are both female, like the rest of the fairies.
-   In _Parodius_, TwinBee and WinBee from _TwinBee_, the sunfish Mambo and Samba, Option and Multiple, and the babies Upa and Rupa, from _Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa_, are blue and pink. Vic Viper's theme is blue, and Lord British's theme is pink. Pentarou and Hanako would be blue and pink, but Hanako appears more as an orange-red. Doitsu and Soitsu are both male, and appear blue and pink, though Soitsu may be red. The fairies Memin and Sue are blue and pink, and both female. Dracula and Kid D are blue and pink, but Kid D's gender is not known.
-   _Persona 3_:
    -   _Persona 3 Portable_ has different color-coded menu screens depending on the gender the player selects for their protagonist — naturally, pink for the girl and blue for the guy. Additionally, the boy has blue hair, whereas the girl has red hair.
    -   The first two party members to join the MC follow this theme as well; Yukari is almost never seen without wearing something pink, and Junpei, apart from his blue shirt, _never_ takes off his blue hat.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Inverted with the Nidoran family. Male members are pink and purple. Female members are blue. The shiny versions, however, play the trope straight (with the exception of Nidoqueen, whose shiny version is predominantly green).
    -   Latias and Latios (twin dragons and legendary Pokémon) are red/female and blue/male, respectively.
    -   Starting from the third generation onward, the font color on certain game menus (like the save screen) will be either blue or red/pink depending on whether the player character is male or female, respectively. In the fourth-generation games, the Poketch and the Pokegear are similarly color-coded. Also, the text of NPCs in _FireRed_ and _LeafGreen_ will change color depending on their gender — red for girls, blue for boys, black for Pokémon and computers.
    -   In _Pokémon Diamond and Pearl_, the two female Team Galactic admins, Mars and Jupiter, have red and pink hair respectively, while the male admin, Saturn, and the leader, Cyrus, both have blue hair.
    -   _Pokémon Black and White_ has the Water/Ghost jellyfish Jellicent. Males are blue with a large mustache, while females are pink, lack a mustache, and have lipstick and eyelashes. The same goes for their pre-evolution forms, Frillish, which are light blue when male and pink when female. Male Frillish also have an perpetually angry expression, while females are all smiles.
    -   The Team Skull grunts in _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ follow this. Female grunts have pink hair while males have blue hair.
    -   _Pokémon Sword and Shield_'s Indeedee have blue markings next to their eyes for the males and pink for the females.
    -   In _Pokémon Puzzle Challenge_, during the end credits, the female Japanese developers' names are highlighted in pink. This isn't the case for the non-Japanese people though (maybe because English speakers would be more likely to recognize their genders from their names).
-   _Poppy Playtime_: This appears to be Playtime Co.'s way of developing genders to their toys. We first meet Huggy Wuggy, a blue creature, in Chapter 1, and we later encounter his female counterpart, Kissy Missy, in Chapter 2, who is pink. Also in Chapter 2, the pink Mommy Long Legs is shown to have a male counterpart called Daddy Long Legs, who is blue.
-   _Portal 2_: Using the franchise's color scheme of blue and orange instead of blue and pink. Female voiced GLaDOS has an orange eye, and male voiced Wheatley has a blue eye. Also applies to the robots in the Cooperative Testing Initiative — Atlas has a more masculine body shape and a blue eye, while the more feminine shaped P-body has an orange eye.
-   _Professor Layton_'s young companions fit the trope. His apprentice, Luke, wears a blue hat and blue sweater, while his adopted daughter Flora wears a pink hair ribbon and either a white and pink (_Professor Layton and the Curious Village_) or pink and brown (the other games) dress.
-   In _Resident Evil 2_, the main playable characters are also color coded in this way, with Leon in a blue uniform and Claire in a pink/light red 'biker' outfit as seen this awesome wallpaper<small>◊</small>. Claire wears red for the rest of her games and Leon wears blue in _Resident Evil 6_ respectively.
    -   Ada also wears red in all her appearances to contrast to Leon.
    -   In _Resident Evil 5_, Chris wears green military fatigues while his female partner Sheva Alomar wears a purple tank top.
    -   In the aforementioned _Resident Evil 6_, Leon's female companion is Helena Harper. Earlier in the game she wears a lilac short-sleeved shirt while Leon wears a black jacket and blue jeans. During the China mission, Helena switches to a burgundy shirt over a white tank top while Leon wears a blue shirt under a black vest.
-   Zig-zagged with Baby King from the _Richman_ series. Despite being a female, she wears blue in most titles (to the point that players can't tell her gender until the witch in the spell hut cast an effect to all female characters,) except in _5_ where she wears pink.
-   In _Rod Land_, Rit has pink hair while Tam has blue hair.
-   In _Secret of Mana_, the male lead, Randi, wears blue, while the female lead, Primm, wears pink. Played with in that there's also a third party member, the sprite Popoi, who has an Ambiguous Gender and wears green.
-   _Shovel Knight_: Straight example with the titular hero and his partner Shield Knight (although, as noted above, she wears red instead).
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    
    -   The titular character is a male hedgehog with blue fur, while Amy Rose is a female hedgehog with pink fur. Since the Dreamcast era, Amy has been wearing all red to go with her pink fur.
    -   The two playable characters of the _Sonic Rush_ games are Sonic and Blaze. The latter is a lavender-furred cat with a purple tailcoat. Her fur turns pink and her coat red when she becomes Burning Blaze. But ultimately, this is averted since Sonic himself becomes yellow upon transforming into his Super Form when they're together onscreen.
    -   The default Extreme Gear for male Xbox Live Avatars in _Sonic Free Riders_ is blue, while its female equivalent is pink. The description of the latter lampshades it.
    
    _This model from Accelovice's women's line is a favorite among female riders. The fact that it's pink doesn't hurt!_
    
    -   _Sonic Riders_: Jet the Hawk is male and has green feathers. Wave the Swallow is female and has purple feathers.
-   Pixel and Chisel from _Stay Tooned!_ are sister and brother cats who have pink and blue fur, respectively.
-   Jacques (the Blue Boy) and Aila (the Pink Girl) from _Suikoden III_.

-   Commented on by Millie in _Ozy and Millie_; one about her needing to 'staple pink frilly stuff' to herself to remind Stephan that she's a girl, and another where she thinks pink is a bit of a girly colour for herself. The pink here is her own skin after being hit with the defoliation Running Gag that Simpson had set up.

-   On the Elephant Database, table cells containing data on male elephants have a blue background, while those containing data on female elephants have a pink background. If an elephant's gender is unknown, its data cells are beige. For living elephants, this includes the cell containing the animal's name (if known); name cells for deceased elephants are, except on tables where all the animals listed have died, white regardless of gender.
-   This youtube video combines this concept with Girls Have Cooties for a cute little short.
-   _Getting Dressed - Queen Victoria - Christmas 1848_: This video from _CrowsEyeProductions_ recreates the 1848 Christmas celebration at Windsor Castle. Queen Victoria is shown wearing a pink dress, and Prince Albert wears a black suit with a blue sash, representing his membership in the Order of the Garter (the sash is seen more clearly in Albert's own video).
-   The website Girls Ask Guys uses this scheme to differentiate between male and female users, by highlighting their username, their 'rank', and, if asking the question, their rating stars with the respective colour. If the user has not yet chosen an avatar, they sport a silhouette of their gender with the corresponding shade, too.
-   The "Grammatical gender" article on Wikipedia is illustrated by a cartoonish image of a male and female cat; they look exactly the same, but the former wears a blue bow on its tail and the latter, pink.
-   Taken to the logical extreme in JeongMee Yoon's series of pictures.

When Steph asks to wear a blue shirt instead of pink, she's laughed at and dismissed by the counselor.
-   Discussed in The Nostalgia Chick's analysis of the original _The Transformers_ cartoon, referring to both Arcee and Elita One. Elita One was the Distaff Counterpart of Optimus Prime, and so (leader/girl) pink to his (leader) red and (boy) blue coloring. Elita One's Amazon Brigade otherwise had nothing with the trope, her soldiers appearing in all kinds of colours. Arcee, being the one girl starting the third season, was pink, and so was her (intended) love interest Hot Rod in a magenta shade ("aging" to red when he became Rodimus Prime). From there, the trope gets interesting in that pink is a noticeable colour choice among the Autobot females, but also among the Decepticon males (though not much in the cartoon because that ended long before the toyline did). Hun-Grrr, Misfire, the Seacons, Skullcruncher, Spinister, Fangry, Gaihawk, Barricade, Roller Force, and Horri-Bull, among others, all sport a good level of pink. Blue is more equally divided between the factions.
-   Meredith Gran, who does the webcomic _Octopus Pie_, also did a little animated cartoon about a boy and a girl up in the Arctic.

    Real Life 

-   Luvs once marketed pink and blue diapers for girls and boys respectively. The color-coding was more for the parents' convenience; the diapers' design differed between the ones for boys and the ones for girls: there was more absorbent material either in front (for boys) or beneath (for girls) depending on which one they were intended for. They don't do this any more, possibly for the _manufacturer's_ convenience.
    -   Huggies Pullups and other absorbent training pants, on the other hand, continue to be colored in pink and blue, because toilet training tends to coincide with the time when children develop gender roles.
    -   This seems to have been a general thing of the nineties: both Huggies and Pampers (the two biggest brands in the UK) had this through all their range, with only newborn and prem size nappies in unisex green and white. Both dropped it later for single forms packaged in green, yellow or orange (possibly because new materials meant that they no longer have big pads of cotton wadding in them- like ladies' pads, they all now have a gel core).
-   Older Than Radio in Real Life (and well before most other Real Life cited examples of this): The following comes from historian Tamara Plakins Thornton in a book on the history of handwriting instruction. Because eighteenth- and nineteenth-century etiquette recommended teaching different handwriting styles to people of different genders and social ranks (so that one could tell at a glance whether a letter came from a woman, from a member of the lower classes, or from someone socially important), at least one author of handwriting textbooks for the American upper/middle classes color-coded the books by gender. "In 1845\[,\] writing master James French issued two copybooks, a Gentlemen's Writing Book, bound in blue, and a Ladies ' Writing Book, bound in pink. In the former, French's male students practiced their mercantile running hand \[a script style used by 18th- and 19th-century American and English businessmen\] ... while their female counterparts rehearsed the ladies' epistolary \[a more delicate and ornamented writing style, taught to women and girls of the era instead of the styles considered proper for males\] ... " Source: Handwriting in America: A Cultural History by historian Tamara Plakins Thornton, 1998, p. 43. This early American example of Pink Girl Blue Boy is apparently also the sole pre-20th-century example.
-   In the Netherlands, it's traditional for parents and older siblings to serve rusk topped with _muisjes_ — little sugar-covered aniseed sprinkles — to visitors, colleagues, and classmates to celebrate the birth of a newborn. While initially only available in a pink/white mix, a blue/white mix became available in the early 90's and is now generally used when a boy is born. Since 1938, an orange/white mix has been produced for the short period after a royal birth, and with the "birth" of the new pope in 2005, some Catholic institutions handed out rusks topped with a yellow/white mix, though these were not widely sold in supermarkets, if at all.
-   In the 1920s, pink was deemed more appropriate for boys due to its close associations with red. Blue was assigned to girls since it was more “delicate and dainty” and had close ties to the imagery of the Virgin Mary. This practice continued until the 1940s, when the gender colors were reversed and became the stereotypes that we are still familiar with today.
    -   Before this, babies were usually seen in white or undyed clothes — possibly to symbolise innocence, also possibly because families in those days tended to be large and cloth was more expensive, so parents wanted clothes that would only be worn for a few months to be useful on all their children.
    -   Just before this trope come into force, Jerome K. Jerome wrote an anguished (but very funny) article of how, now it was suddenly the social convention for babies to actually be brought out in polite company, it had given rise to the social minefield of randomly guessing what pronouns to use for 'baby', and the offence it caused if one got them wrong.
-   You can buy pink stocks and grips for a number of guns, including the AR-15 and AK-47.
-   Many restroom signs are pink for women and blue for men. This may even go as far as the restroom's wall color, and some bathrooms take it even further. Pink and blue toilets for their respective bathrooms, pink or blue sinks, pink or blue dryers/paper towel dispensers (although, thankfully, the paper inside is still white or brown), and yes, even pink or blue liquid soap.
    -   In some regions of France, the colours never got switched, and pink is still male while light-blue is female. Another thing is that on municipal campsites the restrooms are sometimes only indicated by colour. Cue outsiders used to this trope accidentally walking into the wrong bathroom.
    -   Sometimes, while the female restroom retains its pink color scheme, the male restroom could also be green.
-   The cere (the small patch of skin above the beak) of a male parakeet is blue. That of the female is brown.
-   Germany's outfits<small>◊</small> the 2012 Olympic Games Parade of Nations.
-   The Pink and Blue Project, an artwork in South Korea.
-   In Russian, "pink" is a slang term for lesbians, and "light blue" is a slang term for gay men.
-   When the European Starling (_Sturnus vulgaris_) is in adult breeding plumage, the colour at the base of the lower mandible can be used as part of a series of visual cues to estimate the sex of the bird: the male usually has a bluish or bluish-grey base whereas the female usually has a pinkish base.
    -   Similarly, in budgerigars the cere (featherless area around the nostrils) is pink for females and blue for males.
-   Some LGBT+ pride flags use pink and blue to represent femininity and masculinity:
    -   There are several different lesbian pride flags, but most of them heavily feature pink, frequently in multiple shades which represent femininity, among other things.
    -   Among the designs for the gay male pride flag (not to be confused with the "rainbow" gay pride flag, which is increasingly used to represent homosexuality regardless of gender, or sometimes the LGBT+ community as a whole), most of them use shades of blue.
    -   The transgender pride flag has light blue stripes representing trans men and pink stripes representing trans women (as well as a white stripe representing non-binary people).
    -   The pansexual pride flag has a magenta stripe representing attraction to women, and a cyan stripe representing attraction to men, sandwiching a yellow stripe representing attraction to people who identify as neither male nor female.
    -   The polysexual flag, similarly to the pansexual flag, has a pink stripe representing attraction to women, a blue stripe representing attraction to men, and a green stripe representing attraction to non-binary people.
    -   In some other pride flags, such as the bisexual, non-binary, and intersex flags, purple, which is a mix of blue and pink, is used to represent a mixture of masculinity and femininity. However, that's not always the case; for example, the purple in the asexual pride flag represents community and has nothing to do with gender.
-   In Roman Catholic art, it's not uncommon to invert this trope with Jesus and Mary, with the two being given red and blue clothing, respectively. Red is a color heavily associated with Christ, considering its symbolism with both blood and love.
