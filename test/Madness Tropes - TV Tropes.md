_"We psychoanalysts never use the crude term 'crazy'. You may merely suffer from Type 3 Psychomanic Derangement, which_ presents _as craziness."_

Any tropes involving madness or insanity. Except those dealing with Hollywood Psych.

These can run the gamut from the weird but generally happy chaos that inhabits the Cloudcuckoolander's mind to the darkest corners of a person's shattered psyche.

_Please sort tropes appropriately. Some tropes may fit in both the "Characters" index and the "Madnesses" index, but each trope should only belong in one section of each index._
