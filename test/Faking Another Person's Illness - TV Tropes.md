**Filthy Rich:** So, Granny was never sick?  
**Granny Smith:** And there ain't no apple-blighted ponies?  
**Big Mac:** Nope.  
**Applejack:** Those were all lies.

Playing Sick is one thing, but some people may be too clever to fall for that. So how about if you pretend someone else is sick?

Maybe the liar is trying to avoid going somewhere or doing something by claiming that someone else is sick and that person needs their attention. Maybe, the liar is trying to prevent the ones being lied to from visiting the allegedly sick character and finding out a secret. Maybe the allegedly sick character is playing along and they're either helping this person pretend to be contagious or trying to gain important access to places or items that they claim will "cure" the allegedly sick one.

Sometimes, the character who's apparently sick can be not present or even completely made\-up and the liar can just leave without any intention of visiting them, but if they're made up and expected to be present, expect the character who invented them to use their imaginary illness to justify why they cannot let anyone see them.

If it's a real person and they're not playing along, expect the liar to hastily try and hide the allegedly sick person or make them look sick, sometimes shh'ing them or putting a hand over their mouth when they try to say, "I'm fine". Sometimes it's an animal or a baby and they can't talk, but they still _look healthy_, so expect the lying character to try and hide that.

Other times, a character has disappeared, is on a secret mission, has turned into something (like the opposite sex, an animal, or they've turned older or younger—sometimes way younger), or is otherwise not present for a reason other characters don't want to share, so they claim the character is sick when asked where that character is.

Sometimes, the liar is helping another person pretend to be sick, (like if Alice pretends to be sick and Bob explains the "disease" she has), which is often used when the characters are trying to bail out of prison (possibly leading to The Guards Must Be Crazy) or enter a restricted area. This variation, and several other variations, might be used if the liar wants to steal medical equipment for whatever reasons. Sick Captive Scam explores those twists.

In a darker variant, it may also be that the liar is an Attention Whore who wants to gain some sympathy for their selfless devotion to their invalid ward and might even be making them appear sick against their will. This twist might also be used by a Con Man who's trying to scam you with a Fake Charity; what could be a better sob story than all the poor sick little orphans who need your support?

Compare Playing Sick and its subtrope You Don't Want to Catch This for pretending that _you_ are sick, and Induced Hypochondria for lying to someone that _they_ are sick. Invented Invalid is a subtrope (for when the person is definitely made up and the lie involves a visit.) Also compare Münchausen Syndrome, which rises to the level of mental illness.

    Real Life 

-   Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (FDIA), also known as Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy, is a mental disorder that causes caretakers to make their dependents seem mentally or physically ill, sometimes even by inducing symptoms or directly injuring them, as a way to get attention or sympathy. In many cases, the victims, often young children, wind up actually ill or even dead from the abuse.
-   This can also occur in Munchausen By Internet, a related syndrome in which people will post about made-up illnesses in online support communities, either for attention seeking or just to troll. This is made all the easier because of how simple it is to fake an anonymous identity and eliminates the need to fake anyone's physical symptoms.
-   The Internet has also made it easier to do this to fake a charity case: just spin a sad sob story about the Littlest Cancer Patient on a website such as GoFundMe or in a mass email campaign, and _some_ kindhearted but gullible person out there on the Interwebz will open their wallet (or their PayPal account), thinking the money will be going to help this sick child when in actuality it's going to feather the nest of a Con Artist. Snopes has an entire section dedicated to debunking these.
