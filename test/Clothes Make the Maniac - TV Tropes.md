_"Clothes make the people \[and not the other way around\]."_

— **A German Proverb** <sup>1&nbsp;</sup> 

The hero character gets some sort of apparel or accessory that seems to be great and useful, but it's really unstable, sentient, evil (or at least mischievous in the way Muggles would consider evil) or otherwise damaging to its user's heroic nature.

In the case of a sentient, evil item, it often seeks to turn the hero to its own ends. Toward this goal, it begins manipulating the hero's mind. He becomes less sunny and more grim. He becomes less playful and more violent. Eventually the suit and or its wearer begin referring to themselves as "we".

In the case of unstable or dangerous items, various effects from Applied Phlebotinum can cause the same problems to happen as if it were a truly evil thing affecting its wearer.

At that point, the hero may very well realize there's a problem. Or the damage is done, and the hero's tipped over, and will have to be forcibly separated from his new item. In any case, whether the hero's willing or unwilling, don't expect removing it to be easy.

It needn't always be an article of clothing. It could be a gem or jewelry. In fact, they are often the worst offenders; they are ensorceled to whisper seductively to a prospective wearer, the better to get into position to take over the victim.

This trope has a fine lineage, sharing relations to Mask of Power, Artifact of Doom, Enemy Without, Evil Costume Switch, Evil Feels Good, Clothes Make the Superman, The Hat Makes the Man, Evil Makeover, and With Great Power Comes Great Insanity. The difference is that the person who ends up the maniac in question started out a good guy and had no idea that the article of clothing would drive them evil/insane. Super-Trope to Evil Mask. Compare Freaky Fashion, Mild Mind, Paint It Black (where the clothes the person was wearing transform because the person turns evil, rather than the person changing because the clothes were evil).

    Anime & Manga 

-   The title artefact in the _Junji Ito Kyoufu Manga Collection_ story "The Reanimator's Sword" always possesses its owner and makes them carry out its will, including Keiji after he acquires it.
-   _Kill la Kill_'s Junketsu zigzags this. It takes over the mind of anyone who wears it unless the wearer is sufficiently strong willed. Satsuki wears it for much of the series until it's captured and worn by Ragyo, whose mind and Junketsu's are fully aligned, and then used to turn Ryuko evil by forcing it on her. When it's finally returned to Satsuki, Iori repurposes the Kamui by infusing it with Senketsu's life fibers, which were altered by their father to make it compatible with humans.
-   The Millennium Ring in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_.
-   The mask that turns its wearer into a host of Darkness in _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_.

    Audio Plays 

-   _Big Finish Doctor Who_: In _Tales from the Vault_, one of Jo's friends is possessed by a spirit inhabiting a Boer War army tunic he buys from a vintage shop.

    Comic Books 

-   _Doctor Who Magazine_: In "The Blood of Azrael", Azrael's mask contains the memories and powers of the Omnicidal Maniac Azrael, waiting for a host of a suitable mindset to continue his work. Danny provides that host. It's unclear if he was already an Omnicidal Maniac at that point, although he was already a murderous and sadistic xenophobe.
-   In _Femforce_, Nightveil's powers are connected to her Cloak of Darkness, an inherently evil magical artifact. While this makes her arguably among the most powerful beings on earth, Laura must constantly struggle to keep the evil influence of her Cloak in check. She is at times insecure in her own ability to do so and is disturbed by the possibility that the Cloak may already be corrupting her in some way.
-   Iron Man occasionally lent his armor to James Rhodes or Kevin O'Brien, only to have them turn violent and unstable when it is worn too long because the armor's neural-interface controls were only calibrated for Tony Stark's brainwaves. Obviously, Stark has properly adjusted Rhodes' War Machine armor for him to wear safely.
-   _The Mask_ removes all social inhibitions while granting huge power. In the comics, it is responsible for several murder sprees.
-   In _Oz (Caliber)_, as part of the Nome King's takeover of Oz, the Wicked Witch Mombi gave magical necklaces to the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Lion that warped them into isolationist tyrants: each of them ruling their own land with an iron fist. When the necklaces are removed, they revert to their normal friendly and heroic selves, and are horrified by their acts.
-   _Spider-Man_: The black costume that Spider-Man wore for a while is a sentient and aggressive, if not outright evil, symbiote creature. It used to take his body walking and swinging around while he was unconscious, and its aggression in turn made Peter aggressive and darker. For that matter, this is true of most the spider-suit type symbiotes from the Marvel Universe. _Venom_ is kind of an Anti-Hero (due to the host's morals), but the majority of symbiotes seem to generally bend toward what readers would consider evil. However, it was later revealed that the symbiotes are _usually_ pretty nice originally, but they inherit the personality traits of their previous wielders, changing it into "Maniacs Make the Clothes, and then the Clothes Make More Maniacs" (Venom itself originally bonded with a genocidal alien and then later on Deadpool, the combination of which drove it insane by the time Spidey got it).

    Films — Animation 

-   The evil hat, Doris, from _Meet the Robinsons_ could take over its wearers and produce similar effects.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Clown_: A Father puts on a cursed Clown costume that he cannot take off, and slowly turns him into a murderous Monster Clown.
-   _The House That Dripped Blood_: In "The Cloak", whenever Paul Henderson dons the eponymous cloak, he turns into a vampire.
-   The title artifact in _The Mask_ and _Son of the Mask_ playes with the trope. It is an item of Loki, god of mischief. So when it takes over the gentle dreamer Stanley Ipkiss, it boosts his confidence and turns him into a mostly-harmless cartoon maniac, who indulges in one act of strongly implied horrifying violence. Dorian, however, is bitter and violent, and the Mask only magnifies those bad traits to worse.
-   _Spider-Man Trilogy_:
    -   In _Spider-Man 2_, Otto Octavius becomes Doctor Octopus as a direct result of the failsafe burning out that was supposed to protect him from the influence of his sentient waldoes.
    -   In _Spider-Man 3_, the black suit issue rears its ugly head again, compelling Peter to uninhibited aggression. It's not quite revealed just how much it affects Eddie Brock's mind when it later bonds with him as well, as the theme of mutual revenge is retained.

    Literature 

-   _Creature Court_ has Poet's pocket watch, inherited from Saturn. Turns out it works as a conduit for the sky to manipulate him into attempting to trap Velody. Poet manages to shake it off, but the person who had the watch before him was Garnet, which ended...badly.
-   The Archchancellor's Hat in the Discworld book _Sourcery_. Played with in that the wizards weren't really on the bad side, just one of two sides wreaking havoc equally, and that the person who got the hat was already a scheming Evil Chancellor and probably couldn't have gotten _worse_. But still, the hat has a mind of its own, and not a nice one.

-   Most of the rings in _The Lord of the Rings_, The One Ring being the most focused on, but most pronounced in the Nine; they turned their owners, once proud kings, into evil ghostly death knights.
    -   The Seven Rings were _meant_ to do the same to the Dwarves. Unfortunately for Sauron, while the Rings did magnify their greed and some other negative emotions, they did not prolong the lives of the Dwarves, nor did they turn the Dwarves into wraiths as the Nine Rings did to the humans. So Sauron sought to take the Seven Rings back; he managed to get three, while the other four were destroyed by dragons.
    -   Averted with the Three Rings of the Elves; these Rings were never touched by Sauron, and were wielded by immortal beings who were not subject to the "unduly prolonged life" effect that the Great Rings all had. The Three, however, were made with the advice of Sauron (whom the elves at the time didn't realize was Sauron) and were still subject to The One Ring if a sufficiently powerful being gained possession of it. The Elves were immediately aware of this fact when Sauron first donned the One, and responded by promptly taking their rings off. The Three were not worn or used again until Sauron lost the One at the end of the Second Age. Gandalf states that if Sauron were to regain the One, one of the more dire consequences would be that everything that had been done with the Three would fall under his control. He is unsure whether the destruction of the One would cause the Three to be free of its shadow or if it would cause the Three to lose their powers, though he believes it is likely the latter. He turns out to be correct.

-   In _Peter Pan in Scarlet_ it's established that wearing someone else's clothes makes you more like them. The former Lost Boys exploit this by wearing their children's clothes so they can be young enough again to get to Neverland. The Big Bad of the story also exploits this by manipulating Peter Pan into wearing Hook's jacket as a trophy. This slowly corrupts him over the course of the book into acting more callous and pirate-like.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Amazing Stories_: "The Wedding Ring" turns any woman into an Ax-Crazy Psycho Knife Nut as well as an irresistible seductress. Its last known owner was "The Black Widow". Makes you wonder if her evil tainted the ring, or if she was another victim of the ring.
-   _Doctor Who_: In "The Keeper of Traken", Kassia is turned evil by the necklace the Melkur gives her, though in this case it's a mind control device.
-   _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_ the Series had the Thinky-Ring, which turned the wearer into a psychic vampire that grows smarter by draining the intelligence of other people, not to mention addictingly evil. Wayne's wife went so far as to call the ring her "precious," a reference to _The Lord of the Rings_ (the novel; This was years before the movie version), and when his son wore it he dressed up in a black robe and used a growth ray to enlarge his cranium.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   _Kamen Rider 555_: The Delta Driver Super Prototype doesn't come with the life-draining costs of its successors, but it makes the user addicted to using its power for violent ends.
    -   _Kamen Rider Kabuto_: In one episode, the Zecters are revealed to have a system that will turn the Riders into berserkers if they don't fight Worms. However, like most plot points in _Kabuto_, it's never mentioned again.
    -   _Kamen Rider OOO_: The purple Core Medals make OOO far more powerful, both granting him new ice powers and enabling him to kill the show's otherwise immortal main villains. However, they also gradually corrupt him towards becoming an Omnicidal Maniac. The other user of the purple Cores, Dr. Maki, is completely on board with this goal from the beginning and so they don't change his personality at all.
    -   _Kamen Rider Build_: The Hazard Trigger, an upgrade for the Build Driver that serves as the show's Sword of Plot Advancement, makes Build much more powerful when he uses it, but using it for more than a minute overloads his mind with stimulation that causes him to shut down, then reawaken as a silent, brutally efficient killing machine. Two full story arcs are devoted to Build's attempts to master it and dealing with the trauma that he suffers when he commits murder under the Trigger's influence. Eventually he finds a way to build a secondary upgrade that makes the Trigger's power safe to use.
    -   _Kamen Rider Zero-One_: Averted with the Ark Driver when Aruto picks it up near the end of the show and becomes a Fallen Hero. Despite what the audience and the other characters initially think, the Driver isn't responsible for his villainous actions in the slightest.
    -   _Kamen Rider Saber_: The Sword of Darkness, one of ten holy swords, has a habit in recent years of causing anyone who picks it up to turn into a villain. It takes the third wielder to admit that this is because it grants the power of foresight, and seeing that _every possible future_ ends in the world evaporating into dust in the next few months does a number on the user's sanity.
-   _Round the Twist_: In "Copy Cat", Bronson finds an ancient Mongolian copy cat hat that compels whoever is wearing it to copy what they see. Linda wears it during the \`Birdman’ competition and she copies a seagull soaring through the sky. But Dad and Gribble aren’t quite so lucky when they wear the copy cat hat.
-   Clark has stumbled upon jewelry made of red kryptonite at least three times on _Smallville_, usually to the detriment of his personality.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1985)_: In "Dead Woman's Shoes", a shy woman tries on a pair of high heels at a thrift store that make her assertive, self-confident-—and send her on a murderous mission.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Some artifacts in _Dungeons & Dragons_ have a tendency to do this. But then again, what were you expecting from an artifact that requires you to gouge out your own eye (or chop off your own hand) in order to use it?
    -   This can be true of any intelligent magic item (and pretty much any item can be intelligent). Each such item has a Character Alignment of its own as well as an "Ego Score" measuring how strong its personality is. An evil item with a high Ego Score is this trope waiting to happen; if wielded by someone it disagrees with it can refuse to work, or attempt to control the user. Of course, it can also be reversed; a good-aligned item might attempt to control an evil user as well.
-   _Exalted_ has a sort of demon called a Perronelle, an amorphous creature that can be worn as a suit of flexible, lightweight, durable armor...if you don't mind it whispering incitements to blasphemy and Yozi-worship in your ear while you sleep.
-   _Rifts: Mercenaries_ features the Angrar Mark 1 suit, which, like the Mark 2, will slowly corrupt its wearer, causing demonic features to appear on them and leading to violence if anyone is caught near their armour; until eventually the person is absorbed by the suit as the suit itself is actually a demon.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_ brings us suits of armor corrupted or even possessed by daemons, with... predictable... results for anyone who dons them.
    -   In Graham McNeil's novel _Storm of Iron_, a daemon lures Larana Utorian into donning one. True, she does get to kill the Beserker who wore it before her — but then it starts to get control of her.

    Video Games 

-   In _Fate/Grand Order_, due to the baseless rumors that he murdered Mozart in a jealous rage, Antonio Salieri has been warped into an Avenger. As part of this transformation, he's given a twisted costume named the Wailing Facade, which grants him considerable power and even a Noble Phantasm at the cost of turning him into a Mozart-hating psychopath. He's aware that he's not the real Salieri, who was in life a good friend and peer of Mozart, but he's not strong enough to sustain the existence of a Heroic Spirit without the costume.
-   _Luxaren Allure_: The Armor of Ellicide, which turns Aurelie into Evil Overlord Darkloft.
-   In _Warcraft III_, the cursed sword that Arthas finds in Northrend, Frostmourne, is what destroys the last straw of his sanity, leading him to become a Death Knight and eventually the Lich King.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, the Ring of Hircine has a few different effects based on the wearer, and Hircine's mood at the time. The one that most fits the trope is when the wearer is a werewolf and does not have Hircine's favour, becoming cursed to transform at erratic times and act more violently, and it doesn't like being removed even when worn by someone it won't affect. Inverted when Hircine is pleased with the wearer, as they will either gain a controlled werewolf transformation (if not one already) or total control over their existing ones (if they are).

    Web Animation 

-   In the _Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse_ episode "Little Bad Dress," Teresa changes from an innocent Cloud Cuckoolander to an obnoxious snob<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  after borrowing a Little Black Dress from Barbie's Unknown Rival Raquelle.

    Webcomics 

-   Dolly Malestrom in the _Ciem Webcomic Series_, upon stealing the Earwig prototype suit, immediately goes from the not-so-humble housewife to a crazed and psychotic slayer of street thugs. So crazy, she's able to take on an anti-villain who should be several weight classes beyond her.
-   _Darken_'s Komiyan seems to be heading in this direction. His sword is certainly trying to push him down that road, and is capable of taking over his body.
-   A modest example with Walter from _Dubious Company_, who varies between dressing like a nerd and A Pirate 400 Years Too Late depending on his clothes. He almost freaks after a spell sends the cast appropriately dressed to a beach.
    
    **Walter:** What do I look like? A mage? I have no clue. Hell, I'm not even a pirate right now!
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_: The Ice King's Crown. Centuries prior, Simon Petrikov, an collector of ancient artifacts, purchased the crown for his collection, and put it on momentarily as a joke when showing it to his fiancée.

-   _Gargoyles_ features the Eye of Odin, a necklace that turns its wearer into a living embodiment of their darkest impulses. Even in human form, they are incredibly reluctant to relinquish it.
-   Inverted, sort of, in the _Invader Zim_ Christmas episode, where the already-evil Zim makes a robotic Santa suit that takes him over to make him jolly and Santa-ish. Played Straight later when the suit goes crazy and turns into a psychotic monster; it flies off into space and apparently terrorizes the Earth every Christmas one million years in the future.
-   In _Iron Man: Armored Adventures_, the Living Laser and Madame Masque both slowly went insane and became terminally ill as a result of the unstable ore in the Howard Stark inventions they used to give them powers.
-   _Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness_: In "Kung Shoes", Po buys a pair of magic shoes that enhance his kung fu prowess.

-   The _Looney Tunes_ cartoon "Bugs' Bonnets", in setting up its The Hat Makes the Man premise, invokes this by putting a meek suit-wearing everyman in a pirate outfit, with this result:
    
    **Man:** _\[waving sword and flintlock\]_ Batten down the keelhaul! Kill the women and children first! Blood! Gore! Hang 'em from the mizzenmast! _\[stands there panting with a crazed grin until costume is removed\]_

    -   The same with Evelyn as when she accidentally puts on the mask she becomes a man hungry, Southern American girl named Eve but like The Mask she is sweet, kind, polite and loves Stanley very much even calling him screwball rabbit as a way of showing her love for him.
    -   Dr Neuman wears the mask when been given it by Stanley who then puts it on and becomes a insane and psychotic madman who thinks there is a disorder called Ipkissa Maskosis which he must get rid of no matter what even teaming up with Pretorius to do it because his plan might be the only way to do even though he thinks that Pretorius is insane.
    -   Peggy Brandt decides to put on the mask for once to see what it will be like and after putting it on becomes a vapid vain and egotistical, british green faced woman who believes she is the main story and must keep her appearance all perfect but like The Mask and Eve she cares very much about Stanley as she tells him that he's the only one who understands him unlike everyone else.

-   See the Spider-Man entry under Comic Books. Every version of a Spidey Animated Series after the 80s has done a variation on the black suit saga.
    -   And in _The Spectacular Spider Man,_ Doc Ock's Freak Out happens exactly the same way as in the movie.
    -   The 80's version is notable as it originated this quality for the suit and it became Ret-Canon.
-   A police officer on _Superman: The Animated Series_ is a milder example. He was given a combat suit to use that ended up addicting him. He shaved his head, the better to interface with it, began referring to himself as "we" and got violent when separated from the suit or thwarted from using it. It also made him territorial to the point of being willing to beat up on Superman.

-   In an episode of _TMNT: Back to the Sewers_, an antiques store owner hastily gives Casey Jones the evil Ring of Yin to keep it out of the hands of the Purple Dragons.
