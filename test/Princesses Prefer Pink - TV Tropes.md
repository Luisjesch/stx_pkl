Many think 'all monarchs model mink';  
but with a smile and a wink, princesses prefer pink.

_"That's right, I'm a princess_  
_Wrapped in pink frills."_

In fiction, odds are that royal princesses will have a pink dress or outfit she wears most of the time, or at least prominently. It could be anything from a simple frock to a Pimped-Out Dress.

Some parameters for this trope:

-   If the pink is barely noticeable on the outfit, it doesn't count. A significant part of it has to be pink. It could be the skirt or the bodice is almost all pink, or there is a lot of pink trimming on almost every part.
-   Pink hair and makeup alone don't count (they can be included though).
-   Jewelry can count, as long as it's obvious that it's pink, without requiring a closeup.
-   It has to be an actual princess to fit this trope, by birth, marriage, adoption, etc.. This can include fantasies of being a princess (as long as we see the fantasy) or someone playing one in a show, play, or something else. If it's just a woman or girl in a lovely pink dress, with no mention of royalty it's Pink Means Feminine.

The probability for wearing pink gets higher for a Princess Classic, and lower for a Lady of War or an evil princess. Also a Winter Royal Lady wouldn't wear pink as a princess, since that's obviously not a winter color. Many princess-related toys will likely be pink as part of the Pink Product Ploy. If the princess that prefers pink is also a Pretty Princess Powerhouse then you've got yourself a Girly Bruiser.

As a little point of interest, it should be noted that real life princesses of old were more likely to wear blue. This was because pink was considered a masculine colour until after World War II, due to it being a shade of red.

-   In _Digimon Adventure_, Mimi wears a pink dress when she is posing as a princess for a Gekomon kingdom. And so does Palmon!
-   Princess Millhiore F. Biscotti of _Dog Days_. Her hair is pink. Her eyes are pink. Her ears and tail are pink. Naturally, her dress is pink. She's pinker than the color pink itself.
-   May Chang from _Fullmetal Alchemist_ is a a Xingese princess and wears a mainly pink outfit.
-   Most of the princesses and other leading ladies in _Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics_ have at least some pink in their outfits. It's easier to list the exceptions: Snow White from "Snow White and Rose Red" (in her case it's because Rose Red is already wearing pink), Lisbeth from "The Magic Heart", and the princess from "The Iron Stove", who all wear green, and Allerleirauh from "The Coat of Many Colours", who has purple, yellow, blue, white, and red dresses, but not pink.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   Lacus Clyne is nicknamed "Pink Princess" in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ for her clothing habits. Her flagship, the Eternal, is colored pink.
    -   Also applies to some of the mechas in _Gundam SEED_ and _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_: Cagalli Yula Attha (sort of princess of Orb)'s Strike Rouge is the Strike Gundam colored pink, and Meer Campbell's (Lacus's double) pink ZAKU, called "Zaku Warrior Live Concert Version", though it was only used as a stage prop for one of her concerts, and she never pilots it herself.
    -   Princess Relena Peacecraft from _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_ wears pink somewhat often but the crowd that doesn't like her tends to treat this like a bad thing.

-   _Pretty Cure_:
    -   Actually averted with Ako Shirabe/Cure Muse of _Suite Pretty Cure ♪_ and Hime Shirayuki/Cure Princess of _HappinessCharge Pretty Cure!_ as they go with gold and blue respectively. Hikari Kujou/Shiny Luminous of _Futari wa Pretty Cure MaX Heart_ is hard to actually say, really, due to her circumstances.
    -   Played straight with Haruka Haruno in _Go! Princess Pretty Cure_; while she's technically not a princess, she is a part of the Princess Pretty Cure team and is taking princess lessons. And yes, as a Pretty Cure main character, her Cure costume is very, very pink. In contrast, actual princess Towa Akagi has bright pink hair as Cure Scarlet.

    -   In _Hirogaru Sky! Pretty Cure_, the princess of Sky Land, Elle, wears a pink dress.
-   _Project A-Ko_: Even though she doesn't live as one, C-ko is an alien princess who wears pink often.

-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   It's generally assumed that while Usagi's image is associated with silver and white, all of her powers in the first anime result in huge pink blasts of light (if they aren't moon-shaped or rainbows), including her transformation sequences up until Eternal — she's pink on the inside.
    -   Chibi-Usa wears a pink sailor senshi costume and has pink hair. As the daughter of the future queen, she's by definition a princess. Her princess dress in the first anime is white and identical to her mother's, but the manga has her break away from her mother and fall into this trope, with a pink cherry-blossom-evoking dress instead.
-   Invoked in _Seiyu's Life!_. Ichigo Moesaki pretends that she's a princess from the Strawberry Planet. As such, all of her non-work outfits are pink.

-   Subverted in _Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle_. The princess spends most of the series in a pink outfit, but those are just her pajamas. Whenever she's actually acting as a princess instead of a hostage she switches over to a black dress.
-   Nia Teppelin from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ starts wearing a pink, princess-y dress with golden shoulder armor, then goes on to have a pink hoodie, and a pink, one piece dress after the timeskip.
-   Fine, one of the two titular princesses of _Twin Princess of Wonder Planet_, wears a pink gown.

-   Some versions of _Candy Land_ depict Princess Lolly as wearing pink; even the ones that don't almost always show her as having pink _hair_.

    Card Games 

-   Dragon Shield, a line of protective sleeves for gaming cards, invokes this on the packaging for their Matte Pink-colored sleeves. The pink dragon on the box wears a tiara, and according to the back of the box, she's secretly a princess transformed into a dragon.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Wonder Woman and the Star Riders_ Wonder Woman, Amazon princess, switches out all the parts of her costume that are normally red for magenta, adds a matching cape and rides a matching winged unicorn whose wings, mane and tail are cotton candy pink.

    Fan Works 

-   Princess Lotora from Hottie 3: The Best Fan Fic in the World is a villainous example.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Sleeping Beauty_: One of Aurora's fairy foster mothers, Flora, insists on making her princess dress pink and argues with Merryweather, who wants blue. The dress ends up blue for most of the movie, but in The Merch for the Disney Princesses, it's usually pink. This is most likely to distinguish her from _Cinderella_, another blonde with a blue iconic dress. (Cinderella's dress in the movie is white and silver, but blue worked better for the colour-coding). Many of the older fans prefer the blue it is for the majority of the movie. Occasionally it is colored purple in The Merch, but that's unlikely to happen anymore with Rapunzel prancing around with a purple dress and long, blonde hair.
    
    **Flora:** Now, dear, we decided _pink_ was her color.  
    **Merryweather:** _You_ decided!
    
-   _The Little Mermaid_:
    -   _The Little Mermaid (1989)_: Ariel wears a pink dress<small>◊</small>. She also has a pink nightgown.
    -   Princess Melody wears a pink dress in _The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea_ during a human style ball and her mermaid tail is a shade of pink.
-   One of Belle's dresses in _Beauty and the Beast_ is pink, the one that goes with the fur-trimmed red cape.
-   Even Giselle's dress in the Mucha-esque opening sequence of _Enchanted_, an Affectionate Parody of Disney princess stories, is pink, and in the "real world," she does craft herself a pink dress.
-   Charlotte La Bouff, the princess-wannabe of _The Princess and the Frog_ wears pink _because_ of this trope.
-   Rapunzel from _Tangled_ primarily wears a lavender dress as her main outfit, but at the end of the film, after realising her own identity, she wears a rose-pink dress.
-   Princess Irene, in the animated _The Princess and the Goblin_, wears a dark pink dress.
-   Maid Marian, in the animated _Robin Hood (1973)_, wears a pink outfit with lavender highlights. She's not technically identified as a princess, but in this version she is stated to be the King's niece, so it's more or less implied.
-   Princess Eilonwy from _The Black Cauldron_ wears an outfit that features pink prominently.
-   _Cinderella_ and her very first ball gown<small>◊</small>, made by mice and birds.
-   Anastasia is seen wearing pink pajamas after her reunion with her grandmother and reclaiming her title as princess. Her lavender dress during the "Paris Holds the Key to Your Heart" sequence also has a pink shoulder-bow, and her golden gown at the film's climax has pink accents.
-   _Frozen_:
    -   Downplayed. Most of Princess Anna's outfits contain some pink accents, but all of them are primarily green or blue. As for prominent appearances of it, her winter cape and hat are magenta and her room is pink, but that's about it. The color most associated with her is green instead, and blue for her sister Elsa.
    -   This trope gets mocked in the Cut Song "We Know Better". The sisters as children list things that others say a princess "should" do and say that they subvert stereotypes.
        
        **Elsa**: _They say a princess wears pink and frilly clothes_  
        **Elsa**: _They say she never laughs and snorts milk out her nose_  
        **Elsa**: _They say she's calm, they say she's kind, they say she never speaks her mind, or freezes nanny's big behind_  
        **Elsa**: _But—_  
        **Elsa & Anna**: _You and me, we— we know better._
        
    -   Throughout _Frozen II_, Anna's color becomes more and more black as Elsa's color becomes more and more white.
-   In _Wreck-It Ralph_, Princess Vanellope von Schweetz wears a pink Pimped-Out Dress and drives a pink kart.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   After Buttercup becomes _The Princess Bride_, she is seen wearing five different dresses, one of which is full-on pink; another is a sort of peachy-pink.
-   Paige, who gets engaged to a prince, wears a pink dress on the poster of _The Prince & Me_.
-   It's probably no coincidence that Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret wear pink when they go out for VE Night in _A Royal Night Out_.
-   _Descendants_: Audrey is a princess, and true to her motif, her main colors are pink and shades of blue. This doubles as a Mythology Gag, as these colors are associated with her mother Aurora.
-   _The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement_ Princess Mia wears a beautiful pink dress suit, as well as a pink sundress and pink flower-patterned pyjamas, as well as many other pink pieces of clothing.

    Literature 

-   Princess Allriane Cett of _Mistborn: The Original Trilogy_ not only generally does wear pink, but emits such a powerful aura of princessey girliness that her clothes can appear to others to be pink... even when they're really not. Yup, she perception- and memory-warps. Even without burning metal.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: Princess Kasile of Ataidar wears pink dresses when she is a princess. After she becomes queen, she moves on to other colors.
-   Juliet Henry, a.k.a the Pink Princess in the _Perfectly Princess_ series lives and breathes this trope.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_ takes this cute baby seal of a trope and clubs it. Hard. The people who really prefer to wear and/or stuff other people (like, say, Brienne of Tarth — her house colors happen to be both coral pink and periwinkle blue, but she prefers the blue, hence Roose forcing her into Bolton pink) in pink? Are the Boltons. Neither Roose nor Ramsay are princesses. Actual princesses and high ladies? Wear whatever colours they prefer to wear.
-   Deliberately invoked as part of the uniform at _The School for Good and Evil_, where the girls striving to become princesses in the School for Good wear pink dresses. Sophie, an aspiring princess, also wears a pink dress while in Gavaldon. However the true princess Agatha wears blue.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Game of Thrones_: The first glimpse we see of Princess Myrcella Baratheon in Season 5, she's wearing a resplendent, diaphanous pink gown.
-   In Disney's _Princess Protection Program_, the Princess requests a pink silk nightgown, and a pink gown she wears at one point is actually a plot point.
-   Power Rangers:
    -   Ahim de Famille in _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_ takes this a step further; she's a former princess who serves as this season's Pink Ranger.
    -   She wouldn't be the first Pink Ranger Princess, though. Mei from _Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger_ is the princess of the Risha tribe.
-   Princess on _The Walking Dead_ wears a garish pink fun-fur jacket, in contrast to the more utilitarian clothes worn by the rest of the cast.

    Theme Parks 

-   Princess Amoura in _The Eighth Voyage of Sindbad_ show at Universal's Islands of Adventure wears an outfit that's mostly pink, with some traces of blue.

    Toys 

-   Barbie is largely an aversion to this when it comes to the dolls. Despite all the pink associated with her normally, when there is a _princess_ doll, her clothes are rarely pink. The films are a different matter, though:
    -   The Sugar Plum Princess from _Barbie in the Nutcracker_ wears a pink ballet outfit, and prior to discovering her true identity as the Princess, Clara goes through most of the film in a pink nightdress.
    -   Rapunzel wears a plain pink dress as Gothel's ward, while her princess dress is pink and purple.
    -   In _Barbie of Swan Lake_, Odette wears a light pink gown for her date with the Prince, and her "Swan Maiden" outfit has pink and blue feathers.
    -   Anneliese, of _Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper_ wears a pink dress. This pattern continues in Barbie's two other _The Prince and the Pauper_ adaptions, with pink outfits for the princess characters in _Barbie as the Princess and the Popstar_ and _Barbie in Rock 'n Royals_.
    -   Brietta in _Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus_ wears a pink dress in her human form, and of course, she's the titular pink pegasus for most of the film. Her sister Annika also has a few pink outfits, but the bulk of her merchandise focuses on her purple outfits.
    -   In _Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses_, Genevieve and Fallon wear pink dresses, though Genevieve, as the protagonist, wears the traditional "Barbie" pink.
    -   Ro's dress in _Barbie as the Island Princess_ is mostly blue, but has a pink overskirt, and the feathers on the peacock tail are mostly pink.
    -   In _Barbie & The Diamond Castle_, Barbie's character Liana has a fuchsia dress after her princess upgrade.
    -   In _Barbie: Princess Charm School_ Blair Willows also known as Princess Sophia, the lost princess of Gardania, wears a pink uniform. She also wore a beautiful sparkly, bejeweled princess gown.
    -   In _Barbie in a Mermaid Tale_, Merliah wears a pink swimsuit and manifests pink streaks in her hair and eventually a pink mermaid's tail as she discovers her true identity as a mer-princess.
    -   _Barbie: A Fairy Secret_: Princess Graciella has pink hair, pink wings, and pink in all of her outfits. She's also the rare villainous princess in pink.
    -   When Lumina claims her destiny as the titular Pearl Princess, her tail turns pink and pink streaks appear in her hair.
    -   Princess Alexa of _Barbie and the Secret Door_ begins the film in yellow, but magically gains three different pink dresses over the course of her adventure on the other side of the secret door.
    -   Kara in _Barbie in Princess Power_ has a casual pink dress, an elaborate pink ball gown, and a pink superhero outfit for fighting crime as Super Sparkle.
    -   In _Barbie: Star Light Adventure_, the Princess Starlight wears a pink and silver gown with a very prominent pink streak in her hair, and prior to her coronation as the Princess Starlight, Barbie spends most of the film in a pink space-faring suit.
-   While not _officially_ a Princess (though she might as well be; she rules her country by birthright and.. um... hair right... and doesn't seem to have parents), _Lady Lovely Locks_ is just about the most frilly pink girls' toy there was in the 80s. It was, in fact, her signature color, with her two handmaidens generally being characterized with blue and yellow, and the antagonist of her various stories, Duchess Ravenwaves, with purple.
-   _My Little Pony_:
    -   This trope is usually subverted. Despite the multitude of princess ponies, most are not pink colored. The only pink furred or pink haired ones from G1 to G3 are: Primrose, Moondust, Sunbeam, Dawn, Glittering Gem, Brilliant Bloom, Royal Pink, Morning Glory, Ivy, Twinklestar, Trixiebelle, and Fuchsia. If anything, white, purple, and blue are just as common with princesses if not more so.
    -   Princess Celestia in the current _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ line is usually pink, although her character in the TV show is clearly white (albeit with a pale pink outline). This is apparently because Hasbro thinks girls will only buy the toy if it's pink. The fandom was less than pleased, and it wasn't until a few years later that a white Celestia toy was released. Naturally, right around the same time, Princess Cadance, who _is_ pink in the show, was introduced, so the toyline still has a pink princess.
-   Himespetchi of the _Tamagotchi_ franchise is a space princess whose signature outfit features quite a bit of pink and magenta on it.

    Video Games 

-   Princess Peach from _Super Mario Bros. 2_ onward. Her clothes in _Super Mario Bros._ spinoffs are always pink. Her fire form in _Super Mario 3D World_ is an exception. It's white and red like her sprite in _Super Mario Bros._.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Princess Zelda wears a pink dress in _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_, something which is made more clear in the instruction booklet than the game itself.
    -   Her dress in some of the promo art for the original was also pink, although its in-game color is whatever color Link is wearing.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ Zelda's dress was mostly pink, and subsequent games in the series usually have her wear a gown with pink accents.
    -   Zelda wears blue in the original release of _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_, as shown in the manual and promo art; the actual in-game sprite appears dressed in more of an off-white. However, her updated pink dress in the GBA remake is an exact copy of what she wore in the Japanese box art of the original SNES release. Just compare<small>◊</small> them<small>◊</small>.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks_, being possessed by Zelda causes a Phantom to turn pinkish-grey, instead of its normal grey.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_, this is played with: At first, Zelda is a regular citizen who just happens to wear pink, but she dons a white dress and brown, high-laced sandals when Link meets her again after The Reveal that she's a God in Human Form.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds_ is a distant sequel to _A Link To The Past_ set several centuries later, with Zelda wearing a formal pink dress similar to what her predecessor wore in ALttP's original box art and GBA remake. Her dark counterpart Hilda wears a purple dress.

-   For bonus points, _Super Smash Bros._ features both Peach _and_ Zelda in their pink dresses (although the latter has it as an alternate costume since _Brawl_).
-   The 16th main installment of the _beatmania IIDX_ series is subtitled "Empress." It has a very, very pink user interface.
-   In _Double Homework_, Amy’s bedroom contains a lot of pink.
-   Even in _Persona 4_, Yukiko's shadow is a pink-wearing princess.
-   Two out of three princesses in _Tales Series_ wear pink. Estelle wears mostly pink, and even has pink hair, while Alisha has more white ih her clothes. Natalia averts this trope, being associated with turquoise color instead.
-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   The series has the Show Within a Show _Pink Princess_.
    -   The Princess of Khura'in in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_ wears a pink one-piece skirt. Over it she wears a white cloak.
-   The red team's _Fat Princess_ prefers pink. The blue team's princess prefers baby blue.
-   Princess Kara of _Illusion of Gaia_ wears a pink dress, even after the world is restored and she's just a school student.
-   Played with with Remilia Scarlet in _Touhou Project_; **1.** She's not a princess, however, there are several noble or royalty motifs to her (her theme is called "Septette For The Dead Princess/Queen", she is called "The Queen/Empress Of The Night", she owns a mansion that is Bigger on the Inside, has hundreds if not thousands of Fairy servants, often displays a remarkable, charismatic facade whenever she's not being a Bratty Half-Pint in personality, and **2.** Her dresses _used_ to be white. They became pink after she spilled enough blood on her dresses to stain them too much for them to ever become white again. This is because she has, surprisingly for such a powerful vampire, little appetite for blood and is also a messy eater. However, this quirk is responsible for spawning her _other_, best known title: _The Scarlet Devil._
-   Alyssa from _Gungnir_, otherwise known as Princess Alessandra Dlacroa, dresses mostly in pink and red and wields a giant lance covered in big pink roses.
-   One of the unlockable characters in _Rayman Origins_ is a Teensy Princess. Not only is her dress pink, but her _crown_ is pink as well!
-   Rather amusingly, in _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_ Geralt is shown (and can later own) a painting of his surrogate daughter Ciri back when she was Princess of Cintra. Her dress is a wonderfully pretty thing, festooned with pink bows, and the four-year old Cirilla looks like she hates with _every fibre of her being_.
-   Princess Sophia wears a dark pink gown, with black accents and (later) a white cape, all throughout the _Awakening_ series. When she switches over to pants for more practical reasons, she still sports a dark pink top.
-   In _Final Fantasy V_, Krile's job class outfits tend to feature this color more prominently than the others (even Princess Classic Lenna). Her knight's armor is _completely_ pink, and the redrawn sprites from the mobile/Steam release have added pink in where it wasn't before.
-   In _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, there's Maribelle, who favors pink in her outfits, and even retains it in her War Cleric or Valkyrie promotions. However, she's merely a duchess _unless_ she marries Chrom.
-   While her primary color is black (to emphasize the Dark Is Not Evil trope in play), Princess Elise of Nohr in _Fire Emblem Fates_ has a significant amount of pink in her wardrobe too. Her retainer Effie has an all pink suit of armor, but only counts as this trope if she marries royals Leo, Xander, the male Avatar or Odin. Likewise, Hana of Hoshido also primarily wears pink samurai armor, but only counts as this trope if she marries Hoshidan royals Ryoma, Takumi, or the male Avatar.
-   Princess Cookie from _Cookie Run_ wears a huge pink dress.
-   _Princess Pitaya_ wears a pink dress, pink shoes and a tiara with pink jewels.
-   _Yes, Your Grace_: The Player Character is a King and his oldest daughter Lorsulia's usual dress is pink.
-   _Dragon Quest_:
    -   _Dragon Quest II_: In the original release, the Princess of Moonbrooke wore a pink robe and headwear, though it is a rather dark shade.
    -   _Dragon Quest V_: Princess Nera's clothes are a fancy pink and purple dress.
-   Gender inverted in _Puyo Puyo_. The Ocean Prince is a pink-colored minnow; as a human, he has pink hair and wears a pink-and-white outfit.
-   _OMORI_: Sweetheart doesn't seem to hold any title of nobility, but she does surround herself with every stereotypical symbol of fairytale aristocracy, and her preference for wearing pink things and having pink everywhere is beyond doubt. To further the point, one of the tasks you are asked to perform at her castle involves examining a long queue of Sprout Moles and removing every mole wearing a color other than pink.

    Web Animation 

-   _The Little Painter_: Princess Creme Brule is seen wearing a pink dress.
-   _Dingo Doodles_: Bouclair / "The Potato Girl" is a little girl in her Princess Phase who is also _very_ evil, after murdering her way (via poisoned potatoes) into getting adopted into a royal family and then killing the monarchs so she could be queen she demands her new country adopt an aggressively pink-and-glitter colour scheme and has anyone who objects executed.

    Webcomics 

-   _Last Res0rt_'s HRH Adharia doesn't just _prefer_ pink, she _is_ pink — well, all the fur except her mane is, anyway. Her preferred color in clothing actually seems to be purple/lavender. Of course, given her fur, this may just be a way of avoiding pink overload.
-   _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_ has a pink-furred queen, who specifically says she does not need to get any pinker.
-   The aptly-named Princess from _Castlevania RPG_ has a pink dress as her standard adventuring gear. This is lampshaded later in the comic when in a side panel she meets Princess Zelda (disguised as Sheik) and learns to transform into her other outfit (a green commando-esque outfit dubbed "Metal Gear Princess" by the creator) and back.
    
    **Princess:** I have this great pink dress...  
    **Sheik:** Of course you do. It comes with the territory.
    
-   _Girl Genius_ has Zola, who appears to be trying to deliberately invoke this trope. Even her airship is pink... _very pink_. Doubles as a subversion since Zola is an impostor and the real princess doesn't wear pink. This rather pushed her into bouts of cold seething and inventing for "miss pinkie psycho pants" new epithets, each including the "pink" part. Even her Death Ray, both the gun and the actual ray, are pink.

-   Firmly averted, possibly even inverted in _The Fourth_. Princess Veronika never wears pink, she's a Redhead In Green. Lord Skärva sets up a room in his castle for her since he kidnaps her quite a bit. Her reaction to being locked in it is "Ugh. So much pink". Hard to say if she hates all pink or if it's because, in this case, Lord Skärva went overboard.
-   Before becoming what she is today, Ame from _Heart Core_ wore a pink dress that suited her hair nicely.

-   The highest caste of trolls from _Homestuck_ has fuchsia blood, including the heiresses.

    Western Animation 

-   The princess from _The Care Bears: Adventure in Wonderland_ has a pink dress (save for purple trim and several white hearts), and pink cape (save for white ermine trim and a red heart clasp).
-   Aelita of _Code Lyoko_ is often argued to be the "princess" of Lyoko, to the extent of it being her official nickname. And she does have quite a thing for pink. To the point of having a pink cell phone and a pink laptop. Oh, and _pink hair_.
-   Princess Peregrine of the _Storm Hawks_ episode "Royal Twist" wears a pink dress.
-   While both princesses who appear in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, Yue and Azula, avert this (Yue wears purple and Azula wears the standard fire nation red, black, and gold), the Ember Island Players rendition plays it straight for both of them.
-   Princess Bubblegum from _Adventure Time_ is actually part human, part bubble-gum, so not only is her dress pink, but _everything_ is, right down to her skin and hair. Averted, however, with most of the other princesses.
-   Princess Lana on _Captain N: The Game Master_ wears a pink ensemble as her everyday outfit.
-   Zelda, in the Animated Adaptation of _The Legend of Zelda (1989)_, normally averts this trope, as her day-to-day garments are mostly blue and brown; however, in the first episode, she's seen wearing a pink nightgown. In the water park episode, she wears a pink bathing suit. Spryte, the Fairy Companion who is also a princess, plays the trope ramrod straight and wears pink all the time.
-   Piggy, on _Muppet Babies (1984)_, lives and breathes this trope. Not only is her everyday outfit pink (as is she, being a pig), but whenever she plays "Princess Piggy" as part of the babies' big imagination project of the episode, she's decked out in full pink Princess Classic costume. (The only princessy exception was the _Star Wars_ spoof, in which she was dressed like Princess Leia).
-   Gwenevere on _Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders_ wears pink armor.
-   Princess Paw Paw of the _Paw Paw Bears_ wears a pink outfit.
