When human characters appear alongside other races in a given work, the humans are usually among the major characters. By the same token, some stories include no humans at all. The works that fall under this trope Take a Third Option—humans are present, but there are few of them compared to the rest of the cast. Additionally, the humans are _not_ important characters, assuming they even appear on screen. Usually stories like this take place in a World of Funny Animals, but they can also be set in a world of Robots or Sentient Vehicles. So, as this trope says, there's no focus on humans.

Specific versions for this trope:

-   Humans exist and everyone knows about them, but they are very rare in the setting. Other characters might be Funny Animals, fantasy creatures, aliens, etc. (Example: _Adventure Time_).
-   Humans are very common, and may be the dominant species, but only a few appear in the story, which is dominated by animal or fantasy characters (Example: _Finding Nemo_, _Bambi_).
-   Humans are everywhere, but mostly you might just see their feet or vehicles from the point of view of an animal character. There are only a few human characters that have a speaking role (Example: _Oliver & Company_).

Compare Token Human, in which there's _only one_ human present in the story, and Xenofiction, which is from the perspective of characters who aren't human and act like it. See also Humans Are Cthulhu, where humans are not treated as characters, but as a terrifying outside force, and Sliding Scale of Animal Cast, in which Level 2 refers to Living Prop humans, Level 3 refers to very few humans added to the animal cast, and Level 4 refers to a human protagonist in an animal cast. Compare and contrast Absent Aliens, in which the aliens are this trope for humans. See also Humans Through Alien Eyes.

Not to Be Confused with Beast Fable, Humanity's Wake and World of Funny Animals for when there are no humans _at all_.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Digimon X-Evolution_: Unlike every other entry in the Digimon franchise, no humans appear in this special, with the focus being solely on the Digital Monsters themselves.
-   There's one episode of _Excel♡Saga_ that parodied Disney's World of Funny Animals in which Menchi escapes from Excel and joins a group of talking stray dogs, animals being the only focus on the episode.
-   _Pokémon_'s Pikachu shorts exclusively focuses on the Pokémon instead of their trainers, and if humans are seen, it's usually from the eye level of the smaller (and cuter) Pokémon (their lower legs and feet) at the beginning or end of the story.

    Asian Animation 

-   While _Motu Patlu_ puts most of its focus on the human characters, its Spin-Off _Guddu the Great_ instead focuses on Guddu the lion (from the movie _Motu Patlu: King of Kings_) and his animal friends.
-   There actually _are_ humans in _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_, but their appearances are very, very, very rare and they usually aren't major characters in any episode (one exception is Santa Claus, who lets the goats ride his sleigh in _Pleasant Goat Fun Class: Travel Around the World_ episode 1). Other than these, all the focus is on the Funny Animals.

     Comic Books 

-   _Voyagis_ focuses on Alien world of Modia, with only human character being Joy, Earth girl who is telephaticaly linked to Sen thanks to Dream Land.

    Comic Strips 

-   Stephen Pastis's Author Avatar is the only human main character in _Pearls Before Swine_. However, one-shot human characters appear quite often.
-   The only human characters in _U.S. Acres_ are a farmer and his daughter who appeared right after Orson fell out of the truck and took him to the farm. They only appeared for four strips, were only seen waist-down or in silhouette, and never appeared again.

    European Animation 

-   Humans apparently do exist in the setting of _Booba_, but aside from a brief glimpse of their shadows in the first episode, they have made no physical appearance whatsoever.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Palaververse_: Humans, or something like them, are mentioned to exist in the third chapter of _The Tempest_:
    
    **Warthog Delegate:** Sacred skies, it jabbers on like one of the bipedal apes you find in the Interior forests. All they do is screech and try to show off their advancements in tool-using and theoretical mathematics to you.
    

    Film - Animated 

-   Humans in the _An American Tail_ movies basically act as moving scenery, making little to no direct interaction with the mouse characters that make up the main cast.
-   Common in the _Disney Animated Canon,_ which are often set in a World of Funny Animals; in the more "realistic" ones, humans exist but have limited roles. Some examples:
    -   In _Bambi_, humans don't appear often but play an important role (prominently Bambi's mother get killed by a human deer hunter).
    -   _Oliver & Company_: The Disney interpretation of _Oliver Twist_ but with cats and dogs in which the focus is on the street animals only in a human world. Only a handful of human characters play important roles in the story.
    -   _The Jungle Book (1967)_: Mowgli and the nameless girl he goes with at the end are the only human characters. The live-action version takes it further, with Mowgli as the only human character (both in story and on screen), while other humans are only seen as shadows.
-   _Ice Age_: Although the main characters are animals, the main focus of the first movie is returning a human baby to his tribe, who also appear regularly throughout. In all the sequels, you'd be forgiven for thinking humans just don't exist in the franchise's universe.
-   Much of the drama in _Once Upon a Forest_ centers on three young Barefoot Cartoon Animals on a hazardous mission to retrieve medicinal herbs. There are incidental humans, but none are named, and none get more than a minute or two of screen time.
-   Pixar:
    -   _Toy Story_ series only focus on the sentient toys. Humans characters are important for how they affect the protagonists, with the most important being Andy (the kid who owns the main character).
    -   _Finding Nemo_ is about a clownfish looking for his lost child under the sea as well in the human world. A similar case with its sequel.
    -   There is one significant human child in _Monsters, Inc._, named "Boo" by the protagonists.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Thing is, Boo forms a huge part of the plot, which is how to return her to her bedroom in secret, without the monsters' contagion team finding out. Boo is too prominent to be an incidental character.
    -   In the prequel of above, _Monsters University_, there's hardly any human characters in it. Mike and Scully are at college, and have yet to use the closet portals into the human world. The only thing human-ish in their universe is the practice dummy. Then again, humans are acknowledged to exist, it's just that only a few make an appearance.
    -   _The Good Dinosaur_ takes place on an Earth that missed the KT-Extinction event and thus, Dinosaurs evolved into sentient life, on the level with late 19-20th century humans by the time of the story proper. While a humans do exist, they are more feral and are treated like pests by the Dinosaurs. The whole thing sets up an unusual A Boy and His X where the Boy is in fact a Dinosaur and the X is a human boy.
    -   _Inside Out_ is a sort of example; the human girl, Riley, actually does get some focus, but Word of God has quipped that she's not the protagonist, she's the setting.
    -   Subverted in _Wall E_—the first half is set on Earth after humans have left, but they play an important (though still secondary) role in the second half.

    Literature 

-   Isaac Asimov:
    -   "Homo Sol": The entire story is told from an alien viewpoint, mostly in the Third Person narration following Tan Porus around as the galactic government establishes First Contact with the Solarians (humans from Earth's solar system).
    -   "The Imaginary": This story inverts Absent Aliens, as humans from Earth are completely missing from the tale (except for a short mention to provide some context for the setting for people who hadn't read _Homo Sol_). Instead, the story continues from Tan Porus's experiments with the Beta Draconis IV squids.
    -   "The Hazing": Like the original story, "Homo Sol", this story starts from the alien perspective, but stops following the aliens when they kidnap all ten college transfers, fresh from Earth. The idea is to give the newly inducted species a bit of a hazing...
-   In _Bambi_, the only humans shown are the hunters, a boy in the sequel, and the person that reared Gobo after he was injured as a fawn.
-   _Books of the Raksura_ is set on a Constructed World with a huge range of intelligent species; most characters are Rubber-Forehead Aliens or Humanoid Aliens, but some are more unusual. The story focuses on the Raksura, who can shapeshift between a scaled, sometimes winged form and a more human-looking one. If any of the miscellaneous "groundling" peoples are human, it's never specified.
-   _The Cold Moons_ focuses on badgers fleeing from a mass genocide. Humans appear only as antagonists who are poisoning the badgers.
-   _Firstborn_ is from the POV of a magpie living amongst wolves. Humans are shown but very few talk and Maggie doesn't even know their names.
-   In _Survivor Dogs_, all humans have evacuated the area due to an earthquake and were forced to leave their dogs. The dogs must survive on their own in the wilderness. The only humans depicted are either dead or ominous people who test radioactive substances on the dogs.
-   _Tailchaser's Song_ is from the POV of a feral kitten as he goes on an adventure to figure out the cat disappearances in his area. Humans (or "Big Ones" as they're called) are few and far between and are little more than background scenery. Cats see them as their servants.
-   In _Varjak Paw_, humans are referenced but they don't appear outside of the gentleman. The characters are all cats.
-   _Warrior Cats_ focuses on Clans of feral cats. They almost never see humans or their vehicles unless patrolling the borders of/leaving their territory, and they mainly appear as hazards to be avoided. Only in the graphic novels do any of them get speaking roles, but even then they're minor, and it's because the reader is seeing a bit wider view than the main character's viewpoint, unlike in the actual books.
-   Richard Adams' book _Watership Down_ has its focus mainly on a troop of rabbits that journey far afield seeking a new home. There are several humans in the story, but few are named, and they tend to be more plot devices than characters. Much of the drama centers on the hazards rabbits face traveling overland, and the dystopian warrens they encounter in their travels, such as Efrafa.
-   _Wings of Fire_: Humans are referred to as "scavengers" (due to knights scavenging off of dragons treasures) and they are an endangered species that only pop up a few times. The dragons see them as dumb, weak prey animals and they're given quite a few Family Unfriendly Deaths. However, _Dragonslayer_ averted this by being in the point-of-view of three human characters.

    Video Games 

-   _Mega Man_:
    -   In _Mega Man_, aside from the two doctors who built the series' robots, humans are almost never seen. Since Mega Man's duty is to stop the latest attack from Wily's robots, it makes sense. Wily and Light aside, the only other humans who've made physical appearances in the Classic series come from _Mega Man 4_, with Dr. Cossack and his daughter Kalinka, and _Mega Man 11_, where a few humans make appearances as background characters in flashbacks.
    -   In the Sequel Series _Mega Man X_, Dr. Cain is the only human seen onscreen. Compared with the Classic games however, humans are frequently referenced and implied to be dying out due to the numerous rebellions by Sigma and Reploids (advanced robots capable of free thought) going Maverick (Reploids gone insane due to an error in their programming or simply declared as threats to society). Ironic in that it's the Maverick Hunter's prime mission to protect what remains of the human population and X and Zero fight for this goal, but their society is never seen.
    -   _Mega Man Zero_: Ciel is a prominent character, arguably co-protagonist with Zero himself, humans still aren't shown despite the resistance fighting against Fantastic Racism by the city of Neo-Arcadia for Reploid equality. The third game introduces Big Bad Dr. Wile, a Omnicidal Maniac bent on destroying humans and Reploids alike. It's not until the fourth and final installment that said city is shown to be the last human settlement on Earth. Unsurprisingly, the humans just want to be left alone.
-   _Onmyoji_: It is known that humans and Youkai coexist in the same society, but there are exactly _four_ named humans in this game.
-   _Primordia (2012)_ focuses exclusively on robots, with no humans period. Humanity _is_ an important part of the backstory and setting, but is seemingly long-extinct by the time of the story; the closest you ever come to meeting one is stumbling upon a skeleton in an old abandoned base. A supplementary short story reveals humans aren’t actually extinct yet... but only one appears in any capacity, it’s made clear her community is the very last bastion of mankind, and it’s also clear that they’re on their last legs and will probably be dead soon anyways, with robotkind none the wiser.
-   In the _Sonic the Hedgehog_ series, aside from Doctor Eggman himself who is a villainous version of the Token Human, the classic titles featured no humans whatsoever, to the point where it was unclear for a while if the cast inhabited our world at all. Starting with _Sonic Adventure_, characters were explicitly shown to live around cities with plenty of walking, talking human beings, but even then very few contribute in any meaningful way. Maria and Gerald Robotnik are vital to the plot as characters, but only show up in flashbacks, Princess Elise and Professor Pickles only make appearances in their own games and never again, and otherwise interaction between the Funny Animal cast and humans is strictly limited to incidental NPC dialogue in the handful of games that offer hub worlds. _Shadow the Hedgehog_ broke away from the trend with the President, his assistant, and several GUN members having more than a few speaking lines, as well as the aforementioned princess and a few others in _Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)_.

    Web Animation 

-   _Battle for Dream Island_: It is mentioned that humans exist in Goiky, but we have yet to see one.
    -   David and Dora may be exceptions, but it is unknown whether they are actually humans or if they are something else.

    Web Original 

-   The Chilean Edutainment Show _Mi Perro Chocolo_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is basically a Farm of Funny Animals which few presence of humans there. In the first version, there's the little girl with her family (father, mother and a little baby, the former even appearing in one song), but in the 2015 version, there's only Lila as the only human present (assumed it's the same girl from previous version, even when the design is completely different) and friend of the other animals. And in one song, there's Martin, another child as Lila, that only appears in that song.
-   Technically, _The World of Vicki Fox_ is Lions and Tigers and Humans... Oh, My!, but it's a very mild case. Humans exist in Vicki's world, but they don't show up often and have almost no bearing on the plot, leading to this trope. On the Sliding Scale of Animal Cast, the strip is a Level 3. Also, none of the human characters have reappeared since the strip's hiatus ended in 2017.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_: For most of the show's run, Finn is the only human known to exist on the Land of Ooo (thus why he's often referred as "Finn the Human"). Eventually, a few human characters appear, such as Susan Strong and Finn's father Martin, and one major character, Ice King is revealed to have been human once. The "Islands" mini-series reveals that humans are still alive in a group of distant islands separated from the rest of Ooo.
-   In _Blaze and the Monster Machines_, there's AJ, the driver and friend of Blaze, and Gabby, the Wrench Wench of Axle City. Those two are the only humans (and specifically children) that appear in a world full of Sentient Vehicles where all creatures are despised as monster trucks (animals included).
-   _Care Bears: Unlock the Magic_: The show takes place in the Silver Lining, an area adjacent to the Care Bears' home of Care-A-Lot. As such, no humans are seen, although preparations for Easter are mentioned in one episode.
-   _The Exodite_ is a 3D animated series set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Quite refreshingly for an otherwise human-centric franchise, this series follows Lako'ma, a T'au Shas'vre Stealthsuit squad commander, in her hunt for the titular Exodite on a hotly-contested world. The Imperium appears as enemy forces and are not really given much focus.
-   _My Little Pony_: Only in _My Little Pony 'n Friends_ and _My Little Pony TV Specials_ from G1, in which Megan and friends are the only humans; all the other generations are made of World of Funny Animals.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: Humans are not present on the series (with the exceptions of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy), but the garbage they throw to the sea is already part of this submarine world. Humans appear in _The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie_, where SpongeBob and Patrick Star go to the surface and then they found Mitch Buchannon. The Sequel _The Sponge Bob Movie Sponge Out Of Water_ features more humans, including one as the Big Bad.
-   _Star Trek: Prodigy_ takes place in the _Star Trek universe_, where humans exist, but the events of this series happen far from human-occupied space and the closest thing to a human in the main cast is a holographic simulation of Kathryn Janeway.
-   _3-2-1 Penguins!_ focuses mainly on the eponymous penguins and the various aliens whom they assist.
-   _Tom and Jerry_: We only ever see the legs of a housemaid, and Tom is "just" a cat while she's present.
-   _Transformers_: While many iterations of the franchise have featured human friends and allies, there are some exceptions:
    -   _Beast Machines_: The series takes place entirely on the Transformers' home planet of Cybertron, with humans not even being mentioned at all.
    -   _Transformers: Cyberverse_: Barring Flashback scenes, the entirety of season one (and much of season two) takes place on Earth. Despite this, barely any humans actually appear.
-   _TUGS_ focuses on Sentient Vehicles; all we ever see of the humans are megaphones.
-   Ronald-Ann was the only human who had a speaking role in _A Wish for Wings that Work_.

    Multiple Media 

-   _My Little Pony_: Humans are minimal in G1. They appear in books, comics, and animated adaptations but are rarely given characteristic and are mostly Audience Surrogates. By the G2 reboot, humans were removed from the franchise. It stayed this way until G4's High School AU _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_. But even then that in a separate dimension and the human characters never really interact with a straight pony that isn't turned into a human (or a dog in Spike's case) when an Equestrian comes into the human world.
-   _Star Wars_ usually has at least one human protagonist, but a few exceptions have appeared:
    -   _Starfighter: Crossbones_ was originally supposed to have only alien characters; two humans ultimately made it in as minor characters.
    -   "Lair of Grievous", an episode of _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_, focuses on Kit Fisto, his former apprentice Nahdar Vebb and (obviously) Grievous, who belong to three distinct alien species. Dooku, a human, is a minor character.
-   "Bad Luck Jack" is a Youtube short revolving around characters from the Web Comic _Zoophobia_. The comic's sole human character, Cameron, is neither seen nor mentioned in the short.
