_"Ah shit. Here we go again..."_

A story or show that employs an infinite-loop motif, ending in the very way it was put into motion. The circumstances need not be exact.

The idea is that the events that led to the story are going to lead to a very similar story. If the story ends up back in the same place but the situation has changed, that's Where It All Began. If the story starts and ends with similar scenes for dramatic irony or resolution, then that's Bookends. It also often occurs in looping video game scores.

Differs from Oh, No... Not Again!, which refers to a repeating event in the middle of a story.

A form of Status Quo Is God. See also Yo Yo Plot Point, for individual plot points or concepts, rather than whole episodes, arcs, seasons, or series. If the next iteration of the story happens to the next _generation_ we have Generation Xerox.

Compare with And the Adventure Continues, The End... Or Is It?, History Repeats, Last-Second Joke Problem, and Eternal Recurrence, which does this to the entire 'verse. Opposite of We Are Not Going Through That Again, where the hero refuses to set off on another adventure. Can inspire an "Oh, No... Not Again!" from an exasperated character. If a particularly negative Here We Go Again moment is subverted, that's a type of Shock-and-Switch Ending. Contrast May It Never Happen Again.

Not to be confused with the Ray Charles song; or a "Groundhog Day" Loop, where time _itself_ is repeating as a plot device within the story.

**As this is an Ending Trope, beware of spoilers.**

    Fan Works 

-   _Always Visible_: If you read the work according to the chronology of 0-1-2-3, then this can happen due to the fact that if in act zero there was the story of Delia, then in the first there was already the story of Galbraith, and according to the story, the second act will look like a re-release of the zero act.

-   The epilogue of _The Aldous Lexicon_ ends by describing events like those which began the books, with Naia's child in place of Alaric/Naia, and a collage made by Naia replacing the sculpture by Alaric's mother. Which raises the question of whether Naia's mother had known about the other worlds, among other things.

-   Every book in the _Captain Underpants_ series always ends with George and Harold being dragged into another adventure. Yeah, that's how it goes. The savvy kids even comment on this in one book (as pictured above), when one says that he's surprised that they made it to the end of the book without going "Oh no!" and "Here we go again!". Of course, they don't really.
    -   This even extends to the film adaptation, _Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie_. At the end, just when George and Harold comment on how everything is back to normal, the radioactive leftovers that powered the Turbo-Toilet 2000 bring to life an army of talking toilets, prompting an "Oh, no!" from both George and Harold. When the killer toilets interrupt Mr. Krupp's dinner date, he shouts "Check, Please!" and snaps his fingers... accidentally triggering his Captain Underpants persona, who flies in to save the boys from the Talking Toilets as Harold remarks "Here we go again!"
-   Ted Dekker's Circle series. The first three books came and it was quite a gripping story that seemed to lead to a happy ending. But then along came Green where Thomas is sent back in time to have another chance to set things right, to the beginning of book 1, with the condition that his memories of what is to happen are erased. Effectively crating a loop, for without the knowledge of what is to happen, he is bound to make the same choices.
-   At the end of _Daddy Snores_, the protagonist's father has stopped snoring... but started talking in his sleep, which implies his wife will have even _more_ trouble sleeping.
-   Stephen King's _The Dark Tower_ series uses this as well. The final book ends with Roland making it to the top of the tower, and finding himself in the desert following the man in black - and it isn't the first time he's been sent back to the beginning. There's an ambiguous clue that he might change things this time around, though.
-   In the short story "Devil's Marauders" from the _Warhammer 40,000_ anthology book _Deathwing_, a squad of soldiers fight their way through a hostile jungle sector to reach an evacuation point before they are bombarded. Once the remnants of the said squadron reach their destination, they learn that the area has been compromised and the evacuation point has been moved, and they have to fight through another area.
-   An odd Timey-Wimey Ball variation in the _Doctor Who Expanded Universe_ novel "Borrowed Time"; the opening scene is set during the sub-prime mortgage bubble, and has two mysterious figures in dark suits offer a beleaguered banker a wristwatch that lets him "borrow" time. The epilogue is set during the 16th-century tulipmania bubble and has two mysterious figures in dark doublets and hose offer a beleaguered tulip trader a pocket watch that lets her "borrow" time. Less "Here We Go Again" and more "There We Went Before".
-   In-universe example: The _Dragaera_ novels are set in an empire governed in accordance with the Cycle, a system by which each of the 17 Houses rules in turn. The compiled editions of the Vlad Taltos books open with an in-universe poem to illustrate this, that gives every House a line in order, both starting and ending with the House of the Phoenix.
-   In _The Flea's Sneeze_, a flea sneezes in a barn, causing chaos. At the end, a hog says that _he_ is about to sneeze.
-   _Finnegans Wake_ is in some ways a more literal example of this trope than most, as it ends in the middle of a sentence that is completed at the beginning of the novel.
-   _Go the Fuck to Sleep_ ends on the kid, who had previously finally fallen asleep after much profane pleading from their Unnamed Parent, waking up in the night.
-   The children's picture book _How to Make an Apple Pie and See the World_ sets up for an idea similar to the _If You Give a Mouse a Cookie_ books, but actually subverts this. The book begins with a trip to the store for ingredients for apple pie, only for the store to be closed, resulting in a journey around the world. At the end of the book, it's said that apple pie is good with ice cream, so you should go to the store for ice cream. But if the store is closed... you can eat it plain.

-   _If You Give a Mouse a Cookie_, arguably Laura Numeroff's most famous work, begins with the mouse being given a cookie, and asking for various other favors until the end, where he wants a cookie again. Numeroff herself described it as a "circular story."
    -   Several of Numeroff's other books follow the same pattern, either with the same mouse (_If You Take a Mouse to the Movies_) or with other animals (_If You Give a Pig a Pancake_, _If You Give a Moose a Muffin_).
-   _I Really, Really, Really Need a Wee/to Pee_ ends on the protagonist either needing to poo or needing to pee again.
-   _Lumbanico The Cubic Planet_ starts with Pirela talking her friend Ustrum and her sister Mela into looking for the forgotten tunnels leading through the Arista range and explore the Enchanted Valley...and ends up with Pirela saying Ustrum and Mela she wants to explore the remainder Aristas and discover whether their inner vales are inhabited. Ustrum angrily replies he is done with travelling and adventuring, but Pirela is completely certain that she will talk them into it once again.
-   Another King instance in _Needful Things_, which starts with a narrator talking to the reader about the new store coming into town and telling us a bit about the town, and ends likewise in a different town.
-   "The Nothing Equation": The story ends with Green cracking from paranoia and being replaced by another scientist, Larkin, who is likewise convinced that the same thing won't happen to him.
-   At the end of _Oh No, Gotta Go_, the girl, who'd been having a Potty Emergency for the whole book, needs to use the bathroom again.
-   Subverted in _Olive Marshmallow_. A boy named Archie notices "something different" about his mother. It turns out that she's pregnant, and at the end of the story, she gives birth to a daughter named Olive. At the end, it mentions that approximately a year later (since Olive can now walk but she's still not talking), she and Archie "noticed something different about Mum", and she's seen with a round belly. It appears that she's pregnant again, yet the sequel, _Olive the Alien_, shows her at her normal size and with no third child, so apparently she'd just grown a gut.
-   In the epilogue of _Replay_, the "Groundhog Day" Loop is happening to someone new, but his replay date is when Jeff's end date was.
-   _Roys Bedoys_: Subverted at the end of "That Website's Not Safe, Roys Bedoys!", where the computer has just been cleared of a virus that Roys accidentally downloaded, but Loys claims to have just clicked on another shady link. However, he was just joking.
-   The Walter de la Mare poem "Sam's Three Wishes, or Life's Little Whirligig" ends with Sam in the exact same situation he was at the beginning, and contains some great Fridge Brilliance if you're willing to start the poem all over again.
-   Discussed in _Squid Sisters Stories_, a short web serial tie-in for _Splatoon 2_. The story ends with Marie realizing that the events of the first game are pretty much repeating (the Octarian Army has stolen the city's Great Zapfish once again). With her grandfather and the previous game's player character busy with another assignment, and her cousin nowhere to be found, Marie remarks that she'll have to recruit a new agent (i.e., the second game's player character) herself. She also decides to do it in the same manner as her grandfather: stake out one of the most popular locations in the city for a teenager who looks capable enough to single-handedly take down an army.
-   _Time To_: "Time to Pee!" ends with "At least, until you get that feeling again."
-   A Golden Look-Look Book adaptation of the _Tiny Toon Adventures_ episode, "Rock 'n Roar" expands upon the episode's original ending. In the book adaptation, after Buster sets Rover, his pet dinosaur free, he picks up what looks like his soccer ball to trick Montana Max into thinking that there was no dinosaur, only to discover that he instead picked up a dinosaur egg that hatches into a baby girl dinosaur. Buster even calls the trope by its name after the egg hatches.
-   _Todd's TV_ ends with the sentient TV being turned off so he won't bother Todd and his parents anymore... but unfortunately, Todd gets a computer, which is _also_ sentient.
-   The first three _Vernon Bright_ books end like this.
    -   In the first book Bright de-magnetizes himself only to discover he's become electrically charged.
    -   The second ends with their "Faster Than Light Machine" creating infinite Bright's
    -   The third has _two_. Bright's father has to go and stop a meteor crashing into the planet and destroying all life on Earth and at the same time the gravity machine has inverted and is creating a miniature black hole.
    -   The fourth book is different because John realizes that the "Frankenstein's Hamster" _could_ just be hibernating...
-   Word of God says that this is the basic premise of Robert Jordan's _The Wheel of Time_ series, although the series only depicts one Age rather than a full turn of the Wheel.
-   At the end of _Willie Wants a Wee-Wee_, Willie no longer needs a number one, but now he needs a number two.
-   E.R. Eddison's _The Worm Ouroboros_ begins and ends with the Witchland declaring war against the Demonland, the country ruled by the main characters.

    Music 

-   Alice Cooper's Concept Album _Along Came a Spider_ does this. The prologue begins with "We found his diary today", and the epilogue begins with "They found my diary today". A close listening reveals that the events keep on repeating themselves.
-   "All Along the Watchtower" by Bob Dylan has "Two Riders were approaching" as the second-to-last line. This (likely) refers to the Joker and Thief who are quoted at the beginning of the song.
-   Bowling for Soup's song "Highschool Never Ends" includes the line 'And here we go again' when listing a few things on how adult life has people in it still acting the way they did in highschool.
-   Cher's "Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves" has the daughter winding up repeating the mother's life.
-   Coldplay's _Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends_ ends with the hidden track "The Escapist" which plays directly into "Life in Technicolor," the first track.
-   Donna Summer's Concept Album _Four Seasons of Love_ follows a romance through the four seasons, from its beginning in "Spring Affair" to its end in "Winter Melody". Then the cycle starts all over again with the final track, a reprise of "Spring Affair".
-   In Dream Theater's 24-minute epic "Octavarium," the entire theme is coming full circle. In the second section, for example, the narrator wakes up from a 30-year coma. By the end, he has fallen back into the coma.
    -   The entire album Octavarium is an example of this. Track 1, The root of all evil begins with wavering synthesizer. Octavarium, the final track, ends in the same way.
-   Perhaps inspired by _Finnegans Wake_ above, the last word sung on Joanna Newsom's _Divers_ is the first syllable of the word "transcending", and the first word on the album is "sending".
-   The Flanders and Swann song "The Gasman Cometh" utilizes this. A man hires a gasman to fix a problem, but this leads to him creating another problem, requiring more tradies, each one causing their own problem necessitating the next one. It ends on the gasman needing to come again.
-   In the video for the Foo Fighters song "Monkey Wrench", Dave and the band find an apparent group of their clones singing the song in his apartment. Eventually, they get in to find them running away. So they finish the song, however, we pan out of the apartment to see another group of clones looking inside, wondering what's going on.
-   In Harry Nilsson's "Coconut", putting the lime in the coconut and drinking them both up gives a woman a bellyache, prompting her to call the doctor and wake him up. He advises her to put the lime in the coconut and drink them both together, assuring her that "then you'll feel better". And so forth.
-   "In the Year 2525" goes to the end of mankind, then starts all over far away.
-   Machinehead's "The Burning Red" has the same riff at the beginning and the end.
-   "Vice" from Miranda Lambert's _The Weight of These Wings_ is her admitting to her flaws of being The Alcoholic and having meaningless hook ups but she can't do anything to stop it because of her loneliness. The music video also employs this trope: When Miranda is about to make a decision at a crossroad, a car comes up to her and she went to its backseat similar to her position at the start of the video, implying that it will crash like that car.
-   Happens in the nigh-universally banned music video for Nine Inch Nails' 'Happiness in Slavery'. A nameless man enters a room with an altar and machine and performs some sort of ritual before being brutally tortured to death by the machine. The video ends just as Trent enters the room and performs the same ritual implying that he's going to meet the same gorey fate as the other man.
-   The music video for Peterpan's "Menghapus Jejakmu" features a girl (implied to be Ariel's ex) following Ariel around and copying everything he does. At the end of the video, she stops since Ariel now has somebody else... and proceeds to follow Uki.
-   NRBQ's "It Was a \[_sic_\] Accident". Guy and girl impulsively have sex, then they're terrified that she's gotten pregnant. They learn she isn't pregnant, they celebrate and end up impulsively having sex again.
-   The album BE by Pain of Salvation opens with the birth of a god, the first track beginning with heartbeats and faint whispers of the line "I'm at the line, I see it all." This same line appears in its original form in the second to last song as a space probe begins to gain sentience. The final track begins identically to the first, implying that it an endless loop similar to that in "The Last Question" by Isaac Asimov.
-   Pink Floyd's Rock Opera _The Wall_ begins with, at the very first second, Pink saying "we came in?". The very last song cuts off with Pink saying "Isn't this where". Note that the background music in both the last song and the beginning of the first one is the same. So if you play the whole album on a loop, it will be seamless. May be inspired by _Finnegans Wake_ above. The Floyd did this earlier with the heartbeat sound effect (actually a treated bass drum) on _The Dark Side of the Moon_.

    _Look to the sky_  
    _There, in the sky_  
    _I see a star!_

    **Narrator:** The War That Would End All Wars is over... but not everyone agrees. In the underground, something is growing in the dark. Because for some, the war never ended. War will never entirely die. It will evolve, it will change, and war **will** return, sooner than we think.
