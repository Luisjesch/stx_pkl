Octopoids and other tentacled creatures are often depicted as funny and amusing creatures.

Octopuses are soft and lack bones, which, along with their regenerative ability, makes them easy to be the victim of Amusing Injuries. Their Hollywood Chameleon ability can also make them a comical Master of Disguise. Plus there's the inherent funny-ness in the squishy, tentacled body that is able to contour and squeeze through narrow places.

Oh, and they have eight or ten arms (except when they are drawn with fewer), perfect for Multi-Armed Multitasking. Comedy gold.

Heck, even "octopus" and "squid" themselves can be seen as Inherently Funny Words.

May overlap with Stealthy Cephalopod if an octopus' camouflage abilities are played for laughs. For another trope about a comical animal, see Beary Funny. Contrast Tentacled Terror for cephalopods being depicted as scary and monstrous.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Magic World of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has the pseudo-octopus called Cerberus Cloth Eater, which only eats and dissolves your clothes, but is still greatly feared by travelers since it licks them thoroughly then leaves them naked in the jungle. Poor Chisame encountered one.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   The Kraken Surume starts off as the legendary ship-devouring monster one would expect, but upon taking a beatdown from the Straw Hats, he ends up befriending them and turns out to be pretty amicable. And dorky.
    -   Hacchan and his crush Octopako are cephalopod-fishmen and, after Hacchan stops being an enemy to the Straw Hats, the two of them live some rather mundane lives. For the both of them, their main gag is that they use far more of their many tentacle arms than necessary, such as Hacchan using all six of his arms in a thank-you gesture to someone helping him.
-   In _Pokémon the Series: XY_, James' Inkay gets in on the slapstick and mischief as much as any Team Rocket member.
-   _Squid Girl_. The eponymous Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain Protagonist Squid Girl is a humanoid (whether she has a backbone is not mentioned). She has several squid traits, specifically Bioluminescence, Combat Tentacles, the ability to spit (or Waterfall Puke) ink, and Tentacle Rope.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Momo (2022)_: The main character and her father are peculiar wonderers of the aquarium they live in, sometimes veering out of their underwater exhibit. They can write words with their own ink. In addition, their being stranded at a closed gift shop led Momo to try consuming human food and soda and playfully throw stuffed animals at her father.

    Comic Books 

-   _Sam & Max: Freelance Police_: Sam & Max get rescued from pirates in "Hit the Road" by "Ratso" and his "howling band of cephalopods." Sam comments on how their floppy heads look gross on land.
-   _The Umbrella Academy_:
    -   The first issue opens with a man wrestling a giant space squid for no real reason.
    -   The character Horror, who's actually pretty squidish himself, for obvious reasons.

    Comic Strips 

-   The pet squid in the comic strip _Liō_ is a good example, inasmuch as he's supposed to be so cool primarily because he's a squid.
-   The giant squid in _Sherman's Lagoon_ is Sherman's Sitcom Arch-Nemesis.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Animalympics_ has the Calamari Brothers who compete at waterball, freestyle swimming (one of them) and bobsledding.
-   _Finding Dory_: Hank, the octopus Dory meets at the Institute, is pulled into her wacky hi-jinks. He tends to be more of a Straight Man than funny on his own, though he does have his moments, such as disguising himself as a baby.
-   _Finding Nemo_: One of Nemo's classmates is a young, somewhat nervous octopus ("Aw, you made me ink!").
-   In _The Great Mouse Detective_, one performer in the Bad Guy Bar is an octopus clown, juggling three balls between his tentacles. He becomes the victim of Produce Pelting from the patrons of the bar who are unsatisfied with his act.
-   Pixar's feature _Monsters, Inc._ has an octopus-like sushi chef working in the restaurant named Harryhausen's. Like all the patrons, this octopus character is terrified of the human toddler Boo.
-   Dave the octopus from _Penguins of Madagascar_ may be the Big Bad, but he's quite Faux Affably Evil at times, which, combined with his sheer ham, makes him a very entertaining character. His octopus Mooks are even funnier, with their silly antics such as sleeping on the job or starting fights with each other, their "blub" language, and their tendency to fall victim to Amusing Injuries more than any other character in the movie.
-   Luca the octopus from _Shark Tale_ provides necessary comic relief for the sharks. He is also Captain Obvious. He isn't that bright.
-   Theater manager Buster Moon from Illumination Entertainment's _Sing_ hires two hundred deep-sea squid to add their bio-luminescence to his stage and backdrop to create a living light show. Buster soon learns why it's a bad idea to enclose several thousand gallons of water with ordinary window glass.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Aquaman_: Topo the drum playing octopus in a Comically Serious fashion.
-   Ed Wood's _Bride of the Monster_ makes use of a prop octopus that gets Bela Lugosi in its clutches (though Bela has to toss the tentacles over himself for the effect). Supposed to be "evil" but clearly in the "comical" category.
-   From Stephen Chow's 2016 comedy, _The Mermaid_, the merpeople community consists mostly of part-fish merfolk... and then there's Brother Octopus, the sole mer-octopus and resident Butt-Monkey, who often got his tentacles stomped on or sliced off, suffering all kinds of Amusing Injuries throughout the film which is Played for Laughs.
-   _Return of the Jedi's_ Admiral Ackbar is certainly a good guy, but not deliberately funny. Then Memetic Mutation set in. All together now, "It's a trap!" Ackbar's notable for being one of the only squid creatures you'll ever see who's squid-like because of his _face,_ not having multiple limbs. Jabba's guest Tessek (aka Squidhead), on the other hand, is not a nice guy.
-   _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ has an octopus working the wet bar of the Ink And Paint Club, where he mixes drinks, serves patrons, polishes glassware and examines notes for counterfeits all at once.

    Literature 

-   The Curious Squid in _Jingo_ has cephalopodian intelligence Played for Laughs; the squid are, as the name suggests, curious, about all kinds of things. What they aren't good at is making connections, which makes them very easy to catch.
-   The friendly monster Sketchy from _Warren the 13th_ heavily resembles an octopus.

    Music 

-   Henry the Octopus, a supporting cast member of _The Wiggles_. Known for breakdancing with all his legs.
-   A nice one at any rate, in Ringo Starr's "Octopus's Garden". He'd let us in, knows where we've been. On a vacation in Greece, Ringo was told of their penchant for collecting objects to put around their homes. Truth in Television: aquariums often report that if they do not _give_ their octopus shiny things to play with, it will often escape and _steal_ them.
-   Takoluka, a parody illustration of one of the newer Vocaloids, Megurine Luka, as a _very_ cute octopus.
-   "Little Octopus Climbing Over Rock" by Parry Gripp is about a tiny, cute octopus crawling over a rock to get to the sea.

    Teletext 

-   Reg the Octopus from the BBC's _Ceefax_ service, whose attempts at performing multiple tasks at once with his tentacles would invariably lead to hilarious disaster.

    Toys 

-   There are three different octopus Beanie Babies, each designed with Rule of Cute in mind.
-   Squishables has both an octopus plush as well as a squid one.

    Video Games 

-   In _Clayfighter 2: Judgment Clay_, there's Octohead and his Evil Twin (and less funny) Jack.
-   The antagonistic but incompetent Ultros/Orthros from _Final Fantasy VI_ is a large purple octopus prone to Puns and pathetically easy Boss Battles.
-   _Gaia Online_:
    -   Aquarium Cuttlefish are as difficult to please as they are adorable. One of the items they can drop when they die suggests that they are Emo. In addition, the Squid set and The Experiment play tentacles for laughs.
    -   The Yemaya's Pearl item has a pose in which purple tentacles replace the wearer's legs. Yeah.
-   The _Octodad_ games are about an amiable cephalopod and his clumsy attempts to pass himself off as a Standard '50s Father.
-   Blooey the Blooper from _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ is of the comical variety. Unlike Mario's partners, who followed Mario out of respect or another benevolent reason, Blooey, as well as the rest of Luigi's partners (excluding Hayzee), follows Luigi around out of a desire for revenge after Luigi accidentally threw him into lava.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Clobbopus from _Pokémon Sword and Shield_ is a Fighting-type octopus Pokémon with the intelligence and mentality of a three-year-old. It investigates things by punching at them with its tentacles.
-   _Splatoon_:
    -   The Inklings, cartoony squids that can change into humanoid kids with vaguely squiddish features. They talk in fish puns and are described as fun-loving hedonists.
    -   Octolings, their octopi counterparts, are a bit of a subversion, with their race in general being far more diligent and hard-working than the Inklings, who are incredibly hedonistic. It doesn't stop them and the other half of the greater Octarian race (which consist of anthropomorphic tentacles), from acting goofy from time-to-time, with the leader of their military being a Large Ham.
    -   The non-Octoling Octarians are shown as a more disturbing version; most of them are literally tentacles with a face and legs, and even the ones that are more than just a walking tentacle tend to be rather Gonkish.
-   _Squid Ink_ features several cute and comical squids that the player strokes to get ink from. Several of them have quite hilarious flavor text for their abilities.
-   _Sunless Skies_ gives us Deidre, the Rubbery Suffragette's talking pet octopus. She lives on the Suffragette's sunhat, perpetually drinks fine wine along with her owner, and offers some of the most hilarious dialogues in the game. In the end, she along with her owner are the most lighthearted people you'll meet in the otherwise dreary and foreboding Eleutheria.
-   Onionsan from _Undertale_ is a Giant Squid\-like creature who initially seems threatening... until he reveals his onion-shaped head and comical Animesque facial expressions.

    Web Animation 

    Webcomics 

-   Zelig, the vaguely cuddly coconut octopus on _Academia_, who functions as a sort of Team Pet.
-   In _Dinosaur Comics,_ T-Rex's unseen neighbors are cephalopods. He's scared of them, but we the readers are certainly amused by them.
-   One of the secondary characters in _Errant Story_ has a pet miniature tentacle monster, Genre Savvily named Rape-kun. Despite the name, he is completely harmless, and oddly cute. It's mentioned that the owner doesn't have the password to unlock Rape-kun's "Adult Mode". Make of that what you will.
-   _Freefall_. Despite being a Mobile-Suit Human most of the time, Sam is a Lovable Rogue who is said to be not remotely humanoid in his true form. According to the creator, his species is inspired by the intelligence and dexterity that octopodes often show.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   The Squiddles, adorable octopuses that star in a disgustingly cutesy cartoon. They're actual humanity's subconscious representation of the Horrorterrors, which take this trope and kick it all the way over to the "bizarrely and terrifyingly alien" side instead.
    -   Also, Feferi's cuttlefish.
        
        You capture and cage CUTTLEFISH by the thousands for their own good, and also because they are funny and colorful and you love them. They often swim through the bars of their cages, but that is fine.
        

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ features the absolutely adorable Purple Pentapus for one episode, Five legged, purple cephalopods that cling to any surface steadfastly. Despite this, they're completely benign and can be dislodged by rubbing their heads a few times. The show's Asian influence may have inspired the creature's ridiculous cuteness.
-   One _Felix the Cat (Otto Messmer)_ cartoon is "Neptune Nonsense," which features an octopus working as a traffic cop on the sea floor. This octopus tickles Felix for bumping into him.
-   _Futurama_: Zoidberg isn't a Cephalopod, he's an Arthropod. He does, however, have cephalopodian features, such as his facial tentacles and ink-producing abilities. And his younger stages include a cuttlefish-like form (as well as a bivalve, a hydra, a sponge, and every other kind of aquatic invertebrate).
-   The Goofy short _Aquamania_ has a long sequence of Goofy waterskiing with an octopus on his head. The octopus winds its tentacles around Goofy's head and takes over holding the towline to keep the two of them alive.
-   Gobelins produced the short cartoon _Oktapodi_ in 2007, the story of a pair of octopi living contently in an aquarium, until one gets sold to a restaurant. It's up to the other octopus to effect a rescue. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Oswald_: Preschool character Oswald the Octopus is an extremely cute and friendly octopus with a literal wiener dog for a pet, who wears a hot dog bun.
-   _Pocoyo_: Fred (Pulpo) is a friendly octopus that will make jokes along the main characters.
-   Ocho from _Salty's Lighthouse_ is an octopus who is friends with the titular young boy. Ocho likes to paint and often uses his tentacles to squirt paint onto his canvas. He also likes to pretend to be a pirate named Captain Calamari.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: Squidward Tentacles varies from Only Sane Man to Comedic Sociopath between the episodes, being The Comically Serious foil to SpongeBob's wackiness and unstoppable cheer. Also, he's not quite as good at playing the clarinet as he thinks he is.
-   Hanna-Barbera's _Squiddly Diddly_ is an octopus (with six arms) who lives in the Bubbleland marine park. He wants to be a musician and his comic adventures occasionally involve him escaping from Bubbleland in an attempt to become a star.
    -   Two other octopi from Hanna-Barbera: Ocho, the pet octopus from the 1973 _Addams Family_ series; and Orful Octopus of the Really Rottens on _Laff-A-Lympics_.
-   The Beatles encounter a lovesick female octopus in "I Want to Hold Your Hand." They buy a male octopus from an oceanographer and toss it into the ocean to be with the female.
