Kyou wants to be friends.

_"It's a complex maneuver. Don't ask me to demonstrate it."_

An aggressive hug verging upon a flying tackle which sometimes knocks the recipient over and invariably ends up with the glomper wrapped securely around some part of the glompee's body. If the glomper's rather intense feelings for their target are not shared by the glompee, things will immediately get awkward at best or (if the glompee is a Tsundere) violent at worst. Stalkers with a Crush, Clingy Jealous Girls, and Abhorrent Admirers frequently glomp the objects of their affection. Usually considered a comedy trope, for obvious reasons.

While aggressive hugs are nothing new (in Real Life or in media) the use of the term "glomp" to describe them appears to have stemmed from its use as a sound effect in early manga translations by Viz Media. (One folk etymology asserts that it stands for _"Grab, Latch On, Maintain Pressure"_, but that is a backronym applied to the word after it became popular.) The word itself appears to be a mutation of the established English word "glom" which means "to grab; to latch on" (as found in the words "agglomeration" and "conglomerate") with a final "p" sound added to give it more of a sense of definite action. Can function as an Unsound Effect.

This may also be used in a more positive manner if the glompee actually does reciprocate the glomper's feelings; in these cases, a glomp symbolizes one character literally bowling another over with affection, but there again it's typically played for comedy.

Whole-team glomping of anyone who's just scored a goal is also common in sports in Real Life. In soccer, it seems to be compulsory.

A Super-Trope to Cry into Chest.

A glomper is often the Cuddle Bug. See also No Sense of Personal Space, which glompers often exhibit. If the glomper is frightened, it's a Security Cling. If the glomper is very big, the unfortunate object of their affection may suffer Belly Flop Crushing or get accidentally squashed. If the glomper is genuinely _attacking,_ it's a Deadly Lunge or Attack Hello. In Real Life, it can turn into assault regardless of the glomper's intent, especially if the glompee Hates Being Touched, so Don't Try This at Home.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The earliest reported usages of the word "glomp" are as sound effects in the Viz translations of _Urusei Yatsura_ and _Ranma ½_.
    -   The first known appearance of the word "glomp" is in _Ranma 1/2_ Volume One, Part 12 published in 1993. Ironically, this first use was a sound effect for a Personal Space Invader attack Ranma delivered on Ryoga, in stark contrast to the connotation the word carries today.
    -   In _Urusei Yatsura_ Ataru usually attempts to glomp virtually every female he encounters — except for his "wife", Lum. She glomps him, though.<small>◊</small>
    -   The aggressive hugs that Shampoo gives to Ranma in _Ranma 1/2_ are archetypal glomps and are indeed accompanied by the "glomp" sound effect in the manga.
        -   Even less welcome are Kuno's glompings of Akane and the Pigtailed Girl, sometimes simultaneously. He invariably receives a Megaton Punch in reply.
        -   Shampoo also brainwashes Akane into glomping Ryoga during the "waterproof soap" episode in the manga, leading the poor guy to believe she reciprocates his strong romantic feelings for her. He then starts openly expressing those feelings even though he Does Not Know His Own Strength. By the time it's blown over, Akane has decided that "Whoever takes the job of Ryoga's girlfriend will have to be made of sterner stuff than me."
-   _07-Ghost_: Mikage once did a running glomp to Teito, complete with sparkles.
-   _Ah! My Goddess_: Hild, the affably evil queen of Hell, performs three glomps in a row immediately after arriving on earth in her very first appearance, first glomping her daughter Urd, then Belldandy and Skuld at the same time and finally Keiichi.
-   _Ai Yori Aoshi_: Mayu ends up doing this almost every episode. Tina tends to grope any female she meets, and has, like Mayu, a tendency to glomp Kaoru. Being rivals, their respective glomping tends to enrage the other.
-   _Aoi House_: Morgan does this to Alex _a lot_.
-   In _Arata: The Legend_, this is one of the first things that Hinohara receives from Kotoha when he first arrives in Amawakuni.
-   _Bamboo Blade_: Poor helpless Tama-Chan was double-glomped by Kirino and Saya.
-   _Best Student Council_: Randou Rino frequently glomps her friend Ayumu, usually while emitting Ocular Gushers.

    -   Toko is fond of doing this to Yuki.
    -   Tachibana tries to do this to Yuki upon meeting him but Luka pulls Yuki out of the way before Tachibana can hug him.

    -   In chapter 66 upon learning that Ciel wasn't having another asthma attack Agni and Soma glomp him.
    -   Elizabeth generally loves to glomp Ciel, being his future wife and all.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Kon tries to glomp Rukia (and every other female character) every time he sees her (usually shouting Onee-chaan!!! and variation), he never manages to do it though. Except for that one time when he was in Ichigo's body and he finally pulled off snuggling her (non-existent) funbags. He was very happy that day.
    -   Ichigo received a near-lethal variety from adult Nel. Ribs were cracked.
    -   Keigo glomps Ichigo in episode 15 by way of wrapping his legs around Ichigo's torso and his arms around Ichigo's neck.
    -   Keigo also tries to glomp Rangiku because he thinks she's sexy, but she simply puts up her fist and hits him before he can.
-   _Blue Dragon_: Marumaro glomps Kluke at least once.
-   _Brave10_: Isanami is fond of jumping onto Saizo and not letting go.

-   _Cardcaptor Sakura_:
    -   In the anime, when Meiling shows up at school for the first time, she goes to a rather freaked-out Syaoran and tells him that she wanted to walk to school with him. Then she calls him a bad boy and glomps him in tears, making him freak out even more.
    -   Nakuru is great at this, once even climbing through a window to catch Toya unaware.
-   _Case Closed_: Conan, of all people, does it to Heiji in the 6th OVA.
-   _Ceres, Celestial Legend_: Chidori Kurama loved to glomp Yuuhi Aogiri.
-   _Chobits_: Sumomo/Plum does it, despite being under a foot tall. Plum's previous owner encouraged this (and many other) behaviors Hideki has issues with. Persocoms in general are as unconditionally affectionate as housepets; their (usual) extreme sensitivity to their owner's preferences and comfort levels are the only reason we don't see more generalized public glomping.
-   _Chocotto Sister_: Choco does this a lot to Yurika — usually under loud protest from the latter.
-   _Chrono Crusade_: As the first item on the Quotes page hints, Shader is _very_ fond of hugging others... violently, without warning.
-   _CLANNAD_: Kyou performs this manoeuvre on a very shy Kotomi (as seen in the picture), who has obvious difficulties deciding how to respond.
-   In _Claymore_, Raki does this fairly regularly to the Sugar-and-Ice Personality, Clare.
    -   And Clare does it when she reunites with Teresa.
-   _Death Note_:
    -   Misa glomps Light after he specifically told her that it would be dangerous and inconvenient for them to be seen together.

    -   Later on, Misa does something similar to Ryuk.
-   _D.Gray-Man_: One scene has Lavi glomping Allen. Road is also fond of doing this to Allen.
    -   Lenalee glomps Cross Marian at the end of the Ark Arc in order to keep him from wandering off again after spending roughly forty episodes looking for him. In fact, this is the very reason she was brought along.
    -   And in chapter 211, Johnny tackle-hugs Allen with tears in his eyes.
-   _D.N.Angel_: Mio Hio frequently does this to Daisuke.

-   _Dramacon_: Matt is glomped by a fan, which pisses off his then-girlfriend Emily. The con security has to get involved.
-   _Fairy Tail_ has one when Lisanna returns to Earthland after 2 years and finally meets Natsu again. She can't help but glomp him, understandable enough.
-   _The Familiar of Zero_: In the second season finale, Louise does this to Saito after he comes back from the dead. Too bad for Saito that she's flat.

-   _Fruits Basket_: Momiji glomps Tohru _twice_, even though it makes him transform. She returns the favor with a little less velocity.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_: Ed gets glomped a few times by Alexander the dog when he and Al go to Shou Tucker's house to study alchemy. It's hard for a dog to hug someone, so in Ed's case, it was more like Death from Above, as Alexander's shadow was the last thing he saw before the giant dog ever-so-lovingly crushed him underneath.
    -   Near the conclusion of the series, Winry does this to Ed and Al in his restored human body when they return to Resembool.
    -   Alphonse does this to Edward in _Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa_. While _in the armor_. He even _nuzzles_ him!
    -   In the manga and Brotherhood, May's standard greeting toward Alphonse seems to be glomping him.
-   _Full Metal Panic!_: Glomping is Tessa's favorite method to use when trying to seduce Sousuke.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi_: Miaka does this to Yui at the top of the stairs in the manga, resulting in a conspicuous shot of Yui's panties and a teacher telling them to have some modesty.
-   In _Girls Beyond the Wasteland_, Yuuka does this to Buntarou when visiting his apartment with Atomu. Combined with a Dynamic Entry as she's hiding behind Atomu and isn't visible until right before she leaps at him.
-   _Girls Bravo_: Let's see... Quite frequently Kirie, Miharu, and Lisa to Yukinari, Kosame, and Fukuyama to Kirie, and Fukuyama to Koyomi.
-   Happens twice in _Girls und Panzer_. First, in episode six, Kay glomps Miho after being beaten by her, since Miho's skills as a commander made it an exciting match. Second, in episode twelve, Mako glomps Sodoko after the latter deleted all of her truancy records, which meant that Mako wouldn't be held back a year in school.
-   _Gourmet Girl Graffiti_: Ryou does this to Shiina in episode 11b after finding out the latter got accepted into high school... which wasn't the reaction a jealous Kirin was hoping for.
-   _Gravitation_: Ryuuichi once glomped Shuichi from behind.
-   In the _Hamlet_ manga adaptation, the title character does this to Horatio.
    -   Not an unpopular interpretation for that scene.<small>◊</small>
-   _Hanaukyō Maid Team_: Taro's personal staff of Ichigo, Ringo, and Sango or Lemon, Marron, and Melon in the second series are undisputed masters of grabbing Taro affectionately.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_: Italy once does this to Japan. And in episode 18 of the World Series Finland glomps Estonia.
    -   Italy often glomps Germany, though he's not strong enough to send him sprawling on the floor. Not by a long shot. This happens in the "Buon San Valentino" episode.
    -   America tried to do this to Britain after the latter offered him ice cream. It ended with America falling flat on his face before he could even make contact with Britain.
        
        **America:** DUDE SWEET I'M TOTALLY GOING OVER THERE TO HUG YOU! _\[leaps into the air to do just that\]_ ICE CREEEEEAAAAAM!
        
-   _Hidamari Sketch_: Matsuri likes to give these.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_: A more emotional, but still happy variation occurs when Rika does this to Akasaka in the final arc after finding out that the latter survived by yelling his name several times, sprinting down a hill at him, and _launching_ herself down at him from halfway down the slope.
    -   Rena seems to like glomping anything cute.
-   _The Idolmaster_: Makoto is on the receiving end of several sequential glomps on the Idol Agency Sports Meet, after she won the relay race, despite getting the baton in second-to-last place.
-   _I'm Gonna Be an Angel!_: Noelle loves doing this to Yuusuke to an almost frightening degree. Also, Raphael to Mikael.
-   _Irresponsible Captain Tylor_:
    -   Captain Tylor tries to glomp Yuriko Star after waking up on the sickbay table, having nearly died of oxygen deprivation. An annoyed Yuriko quickly steps to one side and Tylor falls flat on his face.
    -   In a later episode after Tylor wakes up from a Journey to the Center of the Mind, Azalyn leaps onto the sickbay table and glomps him, providing the first gratuitous Panty Shot of the series.
        
        **Tylor:** That sort of hurts.  
        **Azalyn:** Then let it hurt. _\[squeezes harder, causing Tylor to shout in pain\]_
        
-   _Kaiju Girl Caramelise_: Kuroe Akaishi does this to Koutarou Hibino when he shows up unannounced. It's notable because she's a Shrinking Violet who never preemptively shows affection to anyone else, not even her mother.
-   _Kannagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens_: In the third episode, Nagi attempts to do this to Jin... And he sidesteps it, causing Nagi to skid face-first across the ground.
    -   Of course, Nagi, being a goofball goddess, was probably just doing it to put on a show for the others who were watching...
-   _Kanon_: The aim of many of Ayu's Crash-Into Hello meetings with Yuuichi.
    -   She gets irritable (as much as she can, anyway) if he dodges. Probably because that generally involves her crashing into trees instead.
-   Played with in _Kill la Kill_. Ryuko's Cloudcuckoolander friend Mako attempts this on her repeatedly, and her response the first time is simply to take a step to the side, resulting in Mako faceplanting into the floor. When asked why she moved Ryuko responds it's a normal reaction to move when someone is charging at you. Mako tries again a few episodes later and Ryuko responds by casually catching her in midair, spinning her around her head and setting the bemused Mako down next to her as if nothing had happened.
-   _Kimagure Orange Road_: Hikaru usually does this to Kyosuke.
-   Yu-Jen in the manga _A Kiss To The Prince_ is fond of doing this to Sei-Ann.
-   Aoki from _Kodomo no Jikan_ is a frequent target of this by Rin.

-   _K-On!_: The girls like to glomp each other on a regular basis. Especially Azusa is often a victim of Yui's sudden affectionate urges.
-   _Kotoura-san_: Yuriko did this to Haruka at the end of episode 2. Manabe mistook that to be Pseudo-Romantic Friendship.
-   In _Kyo Kara Maoh!_ episode 96 Sara does this to Yuuri.
    -   Günter does this to Yuuri from time to time.
-   _Last Exile_: Dio is exceedingly fond of this. Not only will he glomp his faithful companion Luciola, but he also has a thing for glomping Claus who is pretty freaked out.
-   _Love Hina_: Kaolla Su does this frequently, usually in the form of a leaping hug.
-   _Love Live!_: In episode 3, Honoka does it to Umi after the latter is guilt-tripped into taking part in the concert despite objecting to the short skirt on their uniforms.
-   _Lovely★Complex_: In episode 9, Nobu comforts her best friend Risa over Otani basically being oblivious to Risa's love for him and feels it's her fault things aren't going so well because she's the one who pushed Risa to confess to Otani. Risa reassures her not to worry about it, and that she's grateful to Nobu for motivating her to confess her love to Otani. In response, Nobu makes the total out-of-the-blue decision to glomp Risa to the ground and grope her as she's hugging her. Nobu releases lots of heart marks and Risa freaks out, telling Nobu "don't touch me there!"
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   Vivio latches onto Nanoha's legs during an episode of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_, strenuously objecting to Nanoha going to work.
        -   Nanoha would come to return the favor multiple times in _ViVid_, greeting Vivio rather enthusiastically whenever she would return home after an extended time.
    -   In _StrikerS Sound Stage X_, Subaru's reaction to Teana upon reuniting with her after being separated for a year and a half due to joining different divisions was this<small>◊</small>. Good grief, rainbows _are_ straighter than Subaru.
    -   Also in _StrikerS Sound Stage X_, Wendi jumps on Genya when he comes to visit her and the others at the rehabilitation center.
-   _Magical Project S_: Haida does this to Hiroto constantly.
-   _Maria Watches Over Us_: Sei Satou (the first "_Rosa Gigantea_") is fond of glomping Yumi, the series protagonist.
    -   Youko, Sachiko's _grande sÅ“ur_, once does this too, to Yumi's surprise since Youko is usually rather dignified.
-   _Mazinger Z_: Sayaka Yumi used it several times in many manga versions and continuities (albeit not so much in the anime adaptation). Remarkably, she resorts to them when Kouji is feeling gloomy. Her reaction when she met Kouji again after the Final Battle in the Gosaku Ota manga? Glomping him. Her reaction in the _Shin Mazinger Zero_ manga when Kouji got an I Am a Monster moment? Glomping him as declaring he is her ideal man.
    -   Erika used The Glomp with Kouji in episode 63, much to Sayaka's jealous wrath.
-   _MegaMan NT Warrior_: Mayl/Maylu Sakurai is fond of doing this to Lan Hikari. And the boy _still_ doesn't pick up that she's got a crush on him.
-   In _Midori Days_, only the girl is in place of the guy's right hand, which can be awkward; Midori tends to forget the arm isn't meant to bend certain ways.
-   _MW_: Sissy Villain Michio Yuki does this quite a bit to Father Garai. Usually while in various states of undress or drag.
-   _My Hero Academia_ has a bizarre and dark example — for whatever reason, this was the visible sound effect when Dabi tried to burn himself and Shoto to death with what can only be described as a violent hug.
-   Shiho Munakata frequently glomps Yuuichi Tate in the early parts of _My-HiME_. Mikoto does this to Mai from time to time, sometimes adding a Skinship Grope or a self-inflicted Marshmallow Hell for good measure. During the ending, Shizuru Glomps Natsuki from behind while Mai is preparing to sing karaoke.
-   In the _My-Otome_ manga, Natsuki often gets this from her younger sister, Alyssa, and once gets it from her mother, Saeko.
-   _Naruto_: Ino enjoys glomping Sasuke, much to his distaste.
    -   Sakura was not shy about doing this to Sasuke, or rather attempting to, since he'd usually shove her away.
    -   Karin takes it up a notch in Part II. Even locking out Suigetsu so he couldn't interfere with her glomping time with Sasuke.
    -   Chapter 498 has an absolutely adorable/heartwarming moment where Naruto suddenly surprises his mother with a hug and cries while hugging her upon meeting her for the first time.
-   _Natsu e no Tobira_: One of the very few times where this is Played for Drama is in the OAV. When Marion is mourning for his friend Claude, who killed himself after giving him a failed Anguished Declaration of Love, he has an Imagine Spot recreating what he believes it would've happened if he didn't reject the other boy. It has Claude glomping Marion and happily telling him "I love you".
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Negi Springfield tends to be the target of this from the Genki Girls in his class. Also is Konoka to Setsuna, usually causing the swordsgirl to redden noticeably.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: Asuka Langley Soryuu is not nearly as violent about it as some, but the way she adheres herself to Ryoji Kaji in episode 17 is clearly a glomp, much to his exasperation.
-   The titular character of _Ojamajo Doremi_ glomps her fellow apprentices in the closing credits of the first series. (In the dub, this was shown in the _opening_.)
    -   Hana-chan does this to Doremi in the first episode of _Dokkan_ — calling her "Mama" in front of her entire class to boot (and neither Doremi nor Momoko realizes it is the toddler until she says her name).
-   _One Piece_: A Running Gag revolves around Sanji's failed attempts to glomp the sexy ladies, which usually ends with him flying face-first into a wall. Chopper on the other hand successfully glomps people whenever he gets scared or otherwise emotional.
    -   A more specific and adorable example: After the Straw Hats almost lose Robin in Enies Lobby, when they are back on the _Merry_ together, Nami and Chopper glomp Robin.
        -   In fact, they do so during an aforementioned glomp attempt from Sanji, intercepting Robin in the process.
    -   Luffy glomps Boa Hancock during the Whitebeard War. Her reaction is interesting.
        -   She does to him during the 3D2Y special.
    -   Luffy does this to Sabo while hysterically crying upon being reunited with him after 12 years of thinking he was dead.
    -   Carrot the Rabbit Mink is known to this to people she likes. The Minks have No Sense of Personal Space.
    -   Another Mink example would be Bepo of the Heart Pirates, who often acts as a personal pillow and happily glomps his captain Trafalgar Law whenever they're separated for any length of time.
    -   Charlotte Praline glomps her husband Aladdin of the Sun Pirates during her introduction.
    -   Sanji finally gets lucky and an emotional Nami glomps him (along with Chopper and Brook) when they're reunited on board the _Sunny_. Sanji, naturally overexcited at Nami's touch, flips out and tries grasping her, though she deftly steps back before he can do much of anything.
    -   Luffy glomps Zoro in delight when they finally meet up in Wano again.
    -   Later, when Jimbei finally returns to the Straw Hats to join the crew for real, Luffy, Nami, and Chopper — as well as Carrot, who's also currently tagging along — all do this to him.
-   _Outlaw Star_: Iris does this to Gene, who happily reciprocates, though... by immediately grabbing her ass.

-   _Peach Girl_: Kairi has glomped Momo on occasion, as has Sae to Toji and other guys as well.
-   _Pita-Ten_: Misha _loves_ to glomp Kotarou. Since she is at least one head taller than him, the sensation is uncomfortable to Kotarou, the nearby ones, and the spectators...
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   Ash's Gligar/Gliscor has a tendency to do this to him upon landing. While this was originally due to the fact that Gligar had trouble with flying and landing, as Gliscor he has been shown to have no issues with either. It is now purely out of affection.
    -   What _should_ be a painful example would be Ash's Muk, a _Poison_\-type who tends to do this on people he likes (although Professor Oak seems to be a frequent target). No one seems to be hurt by it otherwise.
    -   During the Johto arc, when Ash and Misty were battling over a Totodile, Ash sends out Pikachu; Misty sends out Togepi. She tells Togepi to give Pikachu a great big hug, and he does just that. Between that and a Charm attack, Pikachu is sent running off the battlefield, since he wouldn't willingly hurt Togepi.
    -   Ash's Chikorita had a habit of running into Ash's arms. When it evolved into Bayleef, she didn't lose this habit, but unfortunately, her much larger size caused it to hurt Ash, and an entire episode was made out of this. She gets better, fortunately.
    -   James' Grass-type Pokémon glomp him upon being let out of their Poké Balls. One of them's a cactus. Another's a venus flytrap.
    -   Bianca likes doing this to people and things she's fond of (or trying to do it, anyway).
-   _Project A-Ko_: C-Ko Kotobuki is known to glomp A-Ko Magami on occasion.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_: Wakaba glomps the title character all the time, and frequently goes for rides on her back after.
    -   It can get dangerous when they're both in front of an open window.
-   _Rozen Maiden_: Mi loves glomping Kanaria to the point that she gets friction burns from Mi rubbing faces with her. When Kanaria brought the other Maidens over she glomped them all too. They weren't amused and threw her off after a second.
-   _Sailor Moon_ has Usagi, ChibiUsa, Ann, Rei, and Fish Eye do this in regards to Mamoru.
-   _School-Live!_: Yuki Takeya gives one to Yuri Wakasa near the end of the opening title song. One of the few scenes in the opening that does NOT change as the series progress. (The background does, but not the actual scene) In view of the Big Reveal Yuki’s affectionate embrace is both touching and bittersweet.
-   _Shakugan no Shana_: Enacted under similar circumstances in the second season by Shana and Yuji: once to intercept Yuji's fall following his possession at high altitude by Johann, and again in the final episode when she finds him after singlehandedly storming The Very Definitely Final Dungeon in order to do so before he fades from existence.
-   _SHUFFLE!_: Many girls in Rin's Harem have done this.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   In _Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie_, Tails' default reaction to lightning involves glomping onto Sonic in his panic.

-   Strawberry Shake Sweet: Julia does her best to keep herself from pouncing upon Ran, but sometimes Ran's cuteness is simply impossible to resist. Kaoru, on the other hand, is a happy glomper.
-   In _Tales of Symphonia_'s OVA, the second episode starts with Colette glomping Lloyd Irving. It is to be noted that he runs towards her, and just before the glomp takes place, he moves himself to hug her.
-   _Tenchi Muyo!_: Happens frequently to Tenchi in all the various incarnations. Ryoko is the most common, but hardly the only, practitioner of this technique upon him.
-   _The Testament of Sister New Devil_: Yuki does one to Basara in episode 2 shortly after he transfers into her school. Unfortunately, she does it in front of the entire class, which not only angers Mio but all the guys in the school as well.
-   _To Love Ru_: Happens a lot to Rito because, well, it's that type of series. Lala, Run and Momo being the main offenders.
    -   Special mention goes to Celine, who, despite looking like a 1-year-old toddler (she can walk, but not talk) is capable of flying glomp attacks that will both hit adults in the head and knock them over. Since the target is usually Rito (who she considers her parent), this hasn't helped his reputation.
-   In _Tokyo Babylon_, Hokuto does this to her twin brother, Subaru.
-   _Unlimited Fafnir_: In episode 4, Tear does this to Yuu after seeing him at the school.
-   _Video Girl Ai_: Ai likes to do this to catch Youta's attention. When he continues to ignore her, she repeats the technique with her bare chest, with the expected result.
-   In _The World God Only Knows_, Elsie is prone to this, to the discomfort of Keima and Hakua.
-   _Xxx HO Li C_: If there's a way to do this without arms, Mugetsu has mastered it. Of course, he's even worse when he has them.
-   In the crossover series _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_, Sakura is introduced as a character by glomping Syaoran.
-   _Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou_: Deconstructed in a somewhat slapstick way. After Alpha returns from a year of travel, she's so excited to see her elderly neighbor that she glomps him, but ends up popping his neck out of joint. This leaves him with his head tilted at an angle for most of the chapter, although by the end he's back to normal and shrugs off the pain from it since living with pain is a part of getting old.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, Mana does this to the pharaoh after jumping out of a vase.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_: Anna gives one to Yuma after their tag duel against Umimi and Tobio, causing both to fall down a flight of stairs.

    Comic Books 

-   In _All Fall Down_, Grace tackles Sophie with one of these after seeing her for the first time in months.
-   One issue of the tie-in to _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_ has Stephanie Brown do this to Batman after he recovers from a near-case of dead. Making it funnier, Batman has no idea who she is (time-travel's involved), or why she's hugging him.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Calvin and Hobbes_, it's a Running Gag that Hobbes (in Calvin's eyes, a six-foot tiger) always pounces on Calvin the moment he sets foot through the door after school.

    -   In Chapter 22 Misato glomps Shinji as soon as she saw him and Asuka. According to the narration: "Shinji found himself tackled hard from behind by someone who began trying to squeeze the life out of him."
    -   In Chapter 26 Hikari glomps Asuka so hard that she's thrown both out of the chair and on the ground.
        
        "Drink orders, not very much, but the people bringing the drinks will probably be happier to hear that Shinji would fight this time. Might save some trouble anyway, if you don't have a drink in your hand when she tackles you," Daniel said absently, reaching down for his coconut. "Four, three, two..."  
        This did not clear up Asuka's confusion. "What are you tal—" The tackle took her right out of the chair and into the sand beside her.  
        "ASUKA!OHMIGODYOU'REALIVEYOU'REALIVEI'MSOGLADTOSEEYOU!" The blue and brunette blur that had struck her finally resolved itself into an extremely excited Hikari Horaki.
        
    -   Used by Asuka on Shinji in Chapter 46. She tackled him onto the bunk behind him.
        
        Shinji had just enough time to turn around before he was nearly tackled onto the bunk by a flying Eva Pilot. Asuka wrapped her arms around him and clung fiercely tight.

    Simultaneous mutual glomping is a hazardous activity even for professional anime characters on a closed screen, but somehow Asuka and Hikari managed not to hurt themselves.

-   _Last Child of Krypton_: Performed by Asuka on Shinji in Chapter 12 after their First Kiss. Her flying tackle was so powerful that she sent both to the ground. The feat is even more impressive when you keep in mind she should not be capable to move him (because in this story he has Superman's powers).
-   _Last One Standing_ features a particularly memorable instance of this trope. Just after Twilight Sparkle dies, she suddenly wakes up to being mob hugged by her friends.

    -   _Thweet Geniuth_ — Take The Last Train To Manehattan:

    Before Jade could hand her a pass, an orange streak came out of nowhere and leaped in Scott's direction. The streak hit Scott with enough force that he staggered back a few steps and it seemed suddenly, almost out of nowhere, there was an eight-year-old girl in Scott's arms, wrapped all around him.
    
-   Doubling as Mundane Utility and Chekhov's Skill in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_. When Ash recaptures his Muk in the Gringy City Power Plant, he takes along his _thirty-two_ Grimer friends, who are just as affectionate and hug-happy as their boss. They come in handy to scare off would-be poachers during the group's shopping spree in Chapter 31, and later during Chapter 34, they use it to smother a group Wobbuffet to avoid getting Countered.
-   _Together_: A common reaction to seeing that Laurel is Back from the Dead. Special mention has to go to Thea, who throws herself at Laurel and then "seemed incapable of letting go of her"; and later runs across the room to hug her again, forcing Felicity to step aside lest she be run over. Sara is also said to launch herself at Laurel.

When Sharon is left alone at the team's safe house, she's attacked by mercenaries and the fight ends with her blowing the safe house up. By the time Steve, Sam, and Wanda get back, they can't find Sharon in the wreckage which causes Steve to feel immense guilt for his decision to leave her behind.

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Buffy glomps Willow in "Choices" after learning that Willow has decided to enroll at UC Sunnydale with Buffy, as opposed to Harvard, Yale, Oxford, or any of the other top colleges she got into. It's definitely appreciated.

-   _Doctor Who_
    -   The show paints Vincent van Gogh in "Vincent and the Doctor" as extremely prone to mood swings. If he likes you, though, chances are very good he'll do this, for example when the Doc takes him to visit a Parisian Gallery where an art critic describes him as "the greatest artist of all time."

-   Chiana did this to John in an episode of _Farscape_; for effect, the camera tilted as she did so. She's more than a little insane at that point in the series.
-   _Friends_: Monica glomps Chandler after he asks to move in together. As in she literally catapults off the couch and into his arms, (thankfully he responds with equal enthusiasm and catches her).
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Done by Arya to Jon in the second episode after he gives her a sword he had made for her before their family is separated. This is done to demonstrate that of all the Stark siblings, she has the closest relationship with Jon, despite sharing only a brief few seconds onscreen together in the previous episode, a plot point that the show was unable to go into for reasons of television and time limitations. She does it again in Season 8 when they meet after years of separation and Arya is all grown up.
    -   Fast-forward to Season 6 when Sansa arrives at Castle Black, she glomps Jon as well, which is indeed a very heartwarming moment after the hell that both siblings have been through. It’s also worth noting that the two never interacted onscreen together up until this point in the show, and their interactions are only seen in past memories the two have of each other and their family in the books — though they and their family were separated very early on in both the television series and the books.
-   In _Glee_, when Blaine transfers to McKinley, he gets glomped by Kurt for his trouble. Of course, since they're madly in love it's definitely the second, bowled-over-with-affection kind of glomp.

The guy was a greedy prick who only married his wife for the dowry money and was contemplating divorcing her to marry a different woman just so he could extract a larger dowry payment. His wife refuses to grant him the divorce, so he sneaks up behind her, douses her with perfume, then sets her ablaze with a lit match. Instead of panicking and screaming in terror and pain, the wife immediately glomps him. As a result, he suffers more serious burns than she does and dies while she survives.
-   _Leverage_: Parker gives one to Eliot coming off a stint in rehab where she took a lot of antidepressants, which is funny because neither of them generally seem like huggers and they're not a couple on the show (she's in an Official Couple with their teammate Hardison).

-   _Lucifer_: Ella Lopez, the forensic girl at the precinct, likes to greet people by hugging them, especially if they're people she's never met before and they're thus not expecting the sudden intimacy. This includes people like Lucifer and _Maze_.

-   _Psychopath Diary_: Dong-sik glomps In-woo to distract him while he switches their drinks.
-   JD occasionally attempts this tactic when trying to get a hug out of Dr. Cox. Dr. Cox does not appreciate it.

    -   Chloe does this to Clark a lot of times. In "Zod", she does this to Clark when he returns from the Phantom Zone and defeats Zod. She does it again in "Persona" after making sure he is the real Clark, not Bizarro. Clark does it on a rare occasion in "Labyrinth" when he thought she just died in his arms but turned out All Just a Dream.
    -   Lois glomps Clark (complete with a running start) at the end of "Isis", when he tells her that he's the Blur. It is funny in how it is violent enough to knock him to the floor.
-   Sonny did this to the Alpha Bitch on the first episode of _Sonny with a Chance_, after which she informed her disbelieving target "Yeah, I'm a hugger."
-   In _Stargate SG-1_, Vala likes doing this, usually after moments of extreme tension being resolved. One instance in "Line In The Sand", has Vala teleported to the presumably destroyed village that she was trying to protect. The village was revealed to be "out of phase" and unharmed, she responds by running up to and jumping on Teal'c, complete with wrapping her legs around him.
-   In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "The City on the Edge of Forever," Bones gets one of these from Kirk near the end when the latter and Spock are overjoyed to finally find him, but the happy celebrations are cut short because Edith Keeler is hit by a car seconds later.
-   In _Supernatural_, Cupids like to give people big naked hugs.

    **Castiel:** Nobody likes it.
    
-   _Vincenzo_: Team Leader Ahn's Ambiguously Gay affection for Vincenzo reaches its peak in episode 11. Ahn pulls strings to get Vincenzo released from custody, offers his help in Vincenzo's campaign against Babel, and in return asks for...a hug. Vincenzo offers a handshake but instead, Ahn leaps into his arms, his legs wrapped around Vincenzo's waist while a stunned Vincenzo is left grabbing onto Ahn's butt.
-   In _Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie_, Alex glomps Max at the end after she wishes her brothers back into existence.

-   Even MsChif, with her limited understanding of "personal space", has had a LuFisto aversion since SHIMMER Volume 26 when she was glomped while preparing for the then-upcoming event.
-   In a bit of foreshadowing, after Kimberly's SHINE losing streak came to an end, she glomped Daffney. Kimberly's Heel–Face Turn would be completed when she came to the aid of Daffney's All-Star Squad seven shows later in an effort to join the group and have friends. Speaking of the squad, glomps are common in Solo Darling matches, as she has goodwill towards most of her opponents.
-   Bayley, star-struck to be in even a developmental farm league of WWE, eventually decided she wanted to hug everyone she met. Often without warning, she's just that happy to meet you, you see.

If you succeed you get a Trophy, but fail and you get Glomped, which adds penalties to the rest of your con-going due to having several squealing fans stuck to you and slowing you down. (However, you also get some nice bonuses for the next day if/when you go to sleep later...)
-   In the _Disgaea_ drama CD, Flonne practices to a recital, but when it is time no one shows up. She is driven to tears but sings her heart out even without an audience.

    -   _Final Fantasy X_: This is what Yuna seems to be going for in the ending (towards Tidus, who reciprocates her feelings), but she just crashes straight through him and lands hard. The sequel has a much happier result. If you got the Good Ending.
-   In the 3DS remake of _Fire Emblem Gaiden_, Celica greets Alm with one upon being reunited with him after seven years.
-   _First Encounter Assault Recon_'s Alma manages to turn glomping into Nightmare Fuel in _Project Origin_. Whatever happens, _do not let her._ Project Origin practically runs on the glomping into Nightmare Fuel conversion. Every time she shows up, you have to fight her off. So much glompage ensues. Hilarity does not, however.
-   This is a recurring gag in the _Kingdom Hearts_ series, with Sora normally doing the glomping, mostly towards his close friends. He's also been glomped himself in _Kingdom Hearts II_, first by Simba (well... a lion version of a glomp; upon reuniting), then by Tron (after defeating the Master Control Program), then by Kairi (after reuniting with her in The World That Never Was), then finally by Donald and Goofy (upon returning home).

-   The final boss in _Parasite Eve_ does this when it crawls after you just pumped its body with bullets laced with Aya's DNA. The glomp here equals Touch of Death.
-   Goodra's _Pokémon X and Y_ Pokédex entry states that it likes to hug its trainer, leaving them covered in slime.
-   In _Purgatory 2_, Emma does this to Ebel after he rescues her from being All Webbed Up.
-   If you make Leon of _Rune Factory 4_ jealous, he'll glomp Frey and tell her they don't spend enough time together, so he's not going to let her go for a while. His polygon model even animates for the glomp, though the 2D sprite that talks doesn't.
    -   Amber frequently glomps onto Lest as well. The game itself even refers to it as a glomp.
-   In the _Sonic the Hedgehog_ series, Sonic gets glomped by Amy. Or at least he would be if Amy wasn't color blind. She can't seem to tell the difference between blue Sonic, black-and-red Shadow, and white-colored Silver. She successfully glomps him in _Sonic Unleashed_... while he's in Werehog form. The one time she actually gets him, she thinks she has the wrong guy almost immediately afterward.

-   Hilariously, Kirby gets a good glomp in the 'Subspace Emissary' campaign of _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_ thanks to King Dedede spearing him from behind, affectionately patting him on the head, then dragging him off towards the Great Maze. Kirby looks utterly confused the entire time, even as he leaves a tiny skidmark from Dedede hauling him off.
-   _Tales of Symphonia_ has just one. Zelos glomps Lloyd during a scene at Altessa's house, while trying to force Lloyd to eat. It could be a disingenuous glomp, though. Zelos has drugged the food.
    
    **Zelos:** _\[glomp\]_ Cause we're best friends, right? I'm worried about you. You've got to be tired.
    
-   The reunion between Lars and Alisa in _Tekken 7_'s Story Mode has Alisa immediately tackling Lars the moment he addresses her, almost tearfully expressing how long she waited to see him again. Given what happened to her in the previous game, it's hard not to blame her. Meanwhile, Lee, the party responsible for bringing them back together, gives an approving round of applause.
-   _Touhou Project_: Flandre does this to Marisa in Aozora-Market's _Christmas Present,_ complete with audible _CRACK_!
-   In _Zone of the Enders: Fist of Mars_, The female lead character, Myona Alderan, achieves a most excessive glomp (even by glomp standards) by glomping the male lead, Cage Midwell, from a distance of over 30 meters, from one 'mech to another, in the middle of a battle being held high above the ground!

-   _ReBoot_: Bob is frequently glomped by Enzo. In fairness, it's more flying tackle and less hug and Bob is usually pinned. It is meant as a sign of affection, however.
    -   Marvelously parodied in season three. By this time Enzo has grown up into a huge muscle-bound man and is attacked in this way by another child. At first, you think he is about to receive a taste of his own medicine, only for the boy to bounce harmlessly off of his enormous chest.

He later warms up to Matrix and starts idolizing him, though, even attempting to glomp him at some point, only to bounce off his chest just like the previously mentioned boy.
    -   Enzo getting glomped by AndrAIa earlier in the season. Not that he seemed to mind.

    -   Beast Boy does it to Raven in the Season 4 finale. She tells him to knock it off.
    -   Strangely enough, Raven (of all people) does something like this to Beast Boy (of all people) after her heart has been broken by Malchior and Beast Boy comes to console her. However, since this is more a case of being extremely depressed, lonely, and wanting some sort of comfort, rather than being truly happy to see him, it's debatable whether this counts. The jump-on-and-hug-tightly physical actions are played straight.
    -   At the end of "The End" arc, Raven glomps Robin.

    Real Life 

-   Baby orangutans, gorillas, and several other primates instinctively lock their arms around their mothers and do not let go for _anything_ for the first four to six months of their lives.

-   At the 2014 World Championships, US gymnast Mykayla Skinner hit the best floor routine of her career up to that point in the event finals. Her teammate Simone Biles was _very_ excited about it.
    -   Travis Willingham has been known to tell a story where someone tried to glomp him at his first con and he, not understanding what was about to happen, put his shoulder out like a football player trying to get through a tackle (the man is built like a linebacker, to boot). Suffice to say, he doesn't get glomped very often anymore.
-   A fan once did this to Greg Ayres at the top of a flight of stairs while his back was turned, causing both to tumble down the stairs.
-   During an episode of _Voiceprint with Trevor Devall and Guests_ interviewing Scott McNeil, Scott admitted to being afraid of the very word, having once had his back injured in a glomping incident.
