Guess the trait!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Tertiary Sexual Characteristics occurs when stereotypical female elements are added to a character to demonstrate she is a woman. If you have a yellow circle, and you stick a bow on it, you instantly recognize the circle is a girl.

Stock Costume Traits is that concept, except as related to characteristics or professions rather than gender. You add some costume element onto a character, and that is the visual signal they have adopted that characteristic. For example, if the circle has a pipe and deerstalker hat, we know the circle is a detective; if it wears a monocle and top hat, we understand that yellow circle belongs to high society.

Most of these are Dead Horse Tropes by now. See Clothes Make the Legend for a similar idea, but related to one specific character.

## Other examples:

-   **Amateur Sleuth**: A pipe and a deerstalker hat; thank Sherlock Holmes, who wore it very few times so this fits the 'amateur' part.

-   **Athlete**: Sports jersey with a letter or number on it, matching shorts, high socks, and cleats.
-   **Baby**: Will be wearing a diaper for obvious reasons, and may also be wearing a T-shirt, a frilly bonnet, a hairbow (if a girl), and/or booties. Sometimes, the diaper is all they have on, and other times they might be wearing overalls or a baggy onesie. If the work is older or set before the mid-20th century, the baby will often be wearing a white frilly gown (regardless of their sex).
-   **Ballerina**: Pink or white classical tutu, tights, pink pointe shoes, and hair in a bun.

-   **Clown**: Puffy one-piece jumpsuit with pompom buttons, oversized shoes, cone-shaped hat, and a big red nose. Additional makeup frequently used.
-   **Cult Leader/Member**: Traditionally, the dark or earth-toned robes of a monk or necromancer, with or without a hood, especially for "evil" cults. More modern cults will often feature some kind of New Age/Oriental style (saffron robe with Hare Krishna topknot, Nehru jacket) or just a white "Jesus" robe. For Obviously Evil cults the robe is likely to be black or red, possibly with a skull or pentagram design on it. Scientologists will usually appear in plain suits or "customer service" uniforms.

-   **Firefighter**: Black or brown heavy coat and pants, called turnouts, with yellow stripes on the arms and back of the coat and ankles of the pants, heavy black boots and helmet. The helmet is leather or brass in older works, fire-resistant synthetics in newer ones. It has a number on the front to identify the fire station, and a overhang from the back, meant to keep water from going down the firefighter's back. For some reason, they often have the helmet on in some works even when they don't need it.
-   **Gangster**: (old style) Fedora and zoot suits; (new style) Hoodies and baggy jeans. In many cases, a chromatically inverted suit (white coat, black shirt, white tie) will suffice.
-   **Hardboiled Detective**: A fedora and Badass Longcoat; in Film Noir, they're usually wearing a tie, a white button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and suspenders.
-   **Heavy Metal Rocker**: Hair almost always long, and usually feathered. Sometimes garish face-paint, as well as jungle animal prints on T-shirts or spandex. "Goth" or "barbarian" look (all-black, Spikes of Villainy) for extreme metal.

-   **Mayor**: Often a beauty pageant sash with "MAYOR" printed on it. In pre-1970s depictions, also often a top hat for some reason. In the UK, a gold chain and possibly a tricorn hat, even in the present day. (More realistic depictions only have the hat on ceremonial occasions.)
-   **Medieval Executioner**: Dons a black hood that covers the head partially or whole. Wields either an axe, sword or a noose. Often shirtless.
-   **Mime**: Striped shirt, white face with heavy rouge, beret.
-   **Nerd**: Black glasses, sweater, braces, often a ponytail on the women and suspenders and a tie on the men. They also tend to wear muted colours like grey and black.
-   **Ninja**: Black kabuki stagehand outfit (which they never wore) with face-concealing mask and/or headband. Or regular stuff (especially peasant wear). They're not supposed to stand out as ninja.
-   **Nurse:** White dress and nurse hat with a red cross on it. More modern portrayals will involve scrubs.

-   **Policeman** (the Theme Park Version): Laughably outdated "bobby"-style uniform, complete with cylindrical blue hat. Often will have a "Prussian"-style mustache, too.
-   **Prisoner**: Varies by era. For the mid-19th century through the 1920s, it's a black-and-white, horizontally striped jumpsuit and often a matching flat cap (sometimes also on modern prisoners, either for humiliation purposes or for comedy). For the 1930s through the 1960s, a light blue corduroy shirt, white undershirt, dark blue or black slacks, and a baseball-style cap. For any time from the 1970s to today, a loose-fitting jumpsuit in bright orange. _Political_ prisoners will either still be in (usually ragged) military uniform or will be dressed as peasants.
-   **Professional Wrestling**: _Lucha libre_\-style mask, colorful cape and tights, and Underwear of Power. (Never mind that, except for the underwear, most American wrestlers don't dress like this.)
-   **Punk / Emo**: Dyed (usually black) messy hair, black printed t-shirts, body piercings, tattoos.
-   **Redneck/Southerner**: Varies by time period and social status. The basic "poor farmer" look (at its extreme without a shirt and only one strap on the overalls) works well for any period prior to the mid-20th century. The corrupt hick version will usually be in a white or light-colored suit with the shirtsleeves rolled up, white Panama or straw hat, and a cigar. For examples from the 1970s and later, a baseball cap, jeans, and a hunting jacket will do; handlebar mustache and sideburns optional. A more mysterious or savage example can be established with a simple sack or bag over the head.

-   **Soldier**: Woodland camouflage patterned BDUs, black or brown combat boots, metal WWII style combat helmet. May have a bandolier with grenades or cartridges draped across their chest or shoulder.
-   **Surfer**: Long blond hair, tanned skin, Cool Shades, lotioned nose, cowrie-shell necklace, and baggy shorts.
