When a character needs to be shown as a genius without devoting an entire scene to backstory or problem-solving to demonstrate this, the creator will have them solve or play around with a Rubik's cube. This is done to quickly establish the character's intelligence in as little time as possible so that the plot can start as soon as possible. The quicker and more casually the character manages to solve the puzzle, the more intelligent they are meant to be. This trope can be employed in any genre and has been around for nearly as long as Rubik's cubes.

Real life is not quite so. While it _is_ basically impossible to brute-force solve a Rubik's cube, you can figure out how to manipulate the blocks into any orientation you want if you're well-versed in set/group theory... or just if you look up the shortcuts on the internet. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

This trope was named by Matt Sloan and Craig Johnson, of _Chad Vader_ fame, in their online movie review show, _Welcome to the Basement_.

Another use of the Mysterious Cube of Rubik is to show that humans are baffling to outsiders.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Played with in _Assassination Classroom_. The ruthless chairman of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, Gakuhou Asano, carries a Rubik's cube in his first proper appearance. However, instead of solving it, he breaks it apart with a chisel, and reasons that breaking it apart by force before putting it back together is the most logical and practical way of solving it. This shows how he's willing to use _any_ method he deems necessary to win, and how little he cares about his students' wellbeing when subjected to his dogmatic and brutal education system.
-   In _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_, the orangutan Forever, user of the Strength Stand, demonstrates his sapience by solving a Rubik's cube in front of Jotaro. Jotaro instantly realizes that Forever is doing it to show off, and it's the closest an animal who can't talk can get to Evil Gloating.
-   Similarly shaped, though mostly transparent, devices, known as control cubes are used by both Mihoshi and Kiyone in _Tenchi Muyo!_.
-   Teen Genius Robo from _Wasteful Days of High School Girls_ is often seen playing one. However, we never see her solving it.

-   _Batman_. The villain The Calculator has been known to carry a Rubik's cube around to occupy his time, as he's apparently so smart that he gets bored easily.
-   Played with in the _Tales from the Darkside_ comic "Black Box": Brian Newman has a habit of playing with Rubik's cubes, and invariably solves them in the space of a few panels — if not immediately. However, this isn't because he's a genius; it's because he's a Reality Warper with zero control over his powers. For good measure, it's common for the "solved" cubes to instantly turn completely black, usually as a sign that his Enemy Within is getting troublesome.
-   In _Final Crisis_, the crippled New God Metron keeps solving a Rubik's Cube. In this particular case, it's not that he manages to solve it — it's that he managed to do so in an impossibly low number of moves.
-   Subverted in _Rat-Man_: the Idiot Hero protagonist shows a solved Rubik's cube to his friends as proof of his "amazing powers", but when asked how he solved it, he answers "It was like this when I bought it". Later, Earth is visited by a Cosmic Entity that claims to have amazing powers, produces a solved Rubik's cube, and gives it to Rat-Man saying "This is yours".
-   In Alan Moore's _Abelard Snazz_ comics, the genius protagonist faces a horde of angry gods who want to torture him and convinces them to exile him until he's solved a Rubik Cube instead ("A devilish puzzle that hath tormented minds the galaxy over!"). What the gods don't know is that he can solve any cube in less than thirty seconds. What _he_ doesn't know is that the cube he needs to solve is the size of a skyscraper<small>◊</small>.

    Comic Strips 

-   In a _FoxTrot_ comic, Jason buys a Rubik's Cube at a garage sale after hearing it was _the_ puzzle of the '80s. He solves it quickly, failing to see how anyone could have found it "hard".

It turns out nobody told her how a Rubik's Cube actually _works_, just the desired result, so she just swapped the stickers round. Wolverton suggests to her that there are different kinds of intelligence, and this may demonstrate a skill at lateral thinking.
-   A very minor character in _Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency_ is "a kid who used to solve Rubik cubes in seventeen seconds".

-   The second episode of _The Pretender_ had a scene where Jarod found one on a colleague's desk and solved it in about a minute. The fact that Jarod was kept isolated from popular culture from a young age and had never seen one before makes it even more impressive.
-   Exaggerated on one episode of _Scorpion_, where Walter and Sylvester are racing to see who can solve **TEN** cubes the fastest. Walter shows off by solving the last one behind his back.

-   _MythBusters_:
    -   Deconstructed; one of the Tropes Examined By The Myth Busters. Exploited, although not exactly "busted" by the MythBusters. They demonstrated that there are numerous ways for a not-particularly-smart person to succeed at solving a Rubik's cube just for appearances.
    -   They also invoked the trope during the first Viral Videos episode as a means of demonstrating how easy it is to create misleading video footage. The finished clip shows Adam and Jamie each quickly solving a Rubik's cube, Jamie while blindfolded and Adam using only his feet — after showing the clip, however, they explain that they'd actually started with solved cubes and filmed themselves scrambling them, then played the footage backwards to make it _look_ like they were solving the cubes, even taking the pains to have a third character walk through the scene (backwards in real life, so that it looks "normal" in reverse) to "prove" that the footage wasn't doctored.
-   Channel Four TV clips show _Rude Tube_ gathers together Internet clips of note. One was of an American muscle-builder displaying proficiency at one-handed push-ups — whilst solving the Rubik's Cube one-handed with his free hand. He performed the feat in about thirty seconds.

Sheldon shortly announces that he's "solved" exactly which ones were switched.
-   Subverted in _Star Trek: Voyager_ episode "Think Tank". A Rubix-like puzzle called Sheer Lunacy is driving the crew to frustration, even though Seven of Nine says the solution is easy. This appears to indicate Seven's genius (which is why the Think Tank want her) but she later reveals this easy solution is to cheat by scanning the device. This gives Janeway a "Eureka!" Moment on how to defeat the Think Tank.
-   _Star Trek: Picard_. In "The Impossible Box", Narek is shown playing with a _tan zhekran_, a Romulan puzzle box that looks and works like a wooden Rubik's Cube. His argument with his sister Narissa over the box is used to highlight their differing attitudes to the mission they are on.
    
    **Narissa**: I've never understood your fascination with this toy.  
    **Narek**: It's not a toy. It's a tool. It helps me think.  
    **Narissa**: The only thing it ever made me think of is smashing it open with a hammer to get the prize inside.  
    **Narek**: The key to opening the tan zhekran is taking the time to understand what's keeping it closed. Listen, feel, move each piece ever so slightly, and then once you're sure... _(he shows her the tan zhekran with the pieces in the right place)_  
    **Narissa**: Am I supposed to be impressed?  
    **Narek**: Patience, sister. A quality you never had. _(The tan zhekran then opens)_

    Magazines 

-   The cover<small>◊</small> to the Christmas 2011 issue of _New Scientist_, which included an article about how reptiles are smarter than animal behaviourology had previously thought, shows a tortoise with a completed Rubik's cube.

    Video Games 

-   In _Zeno Clash_ Golem carries around a Rubik's cube. It helps mark him out as very different from the Zenos. Firstly because it shows he's more intellectual (as opposed to their Might Makes Right form of government). Secondly because it completely clashes with the Stone Punk aesthetic of every other piece of technology. _Zeno Clash 2_ reveals it's also a sign he's incredibly _bored_ (from standing guard to make sure none of the Zenos leave Zenozoik).
-   In _The Sims 2_, Knowledge Sims will sometimes play with a Rubik's Cube when idle.
-   In _MapleStory_, Kinesis, a character with Psychic Powers (and of the Magic User class, which usually has very high Intelligence Scores), is shown solving a black and white using telekinesis in the cinematic opening where he is introduced.

    Web Original 

-   Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  from the SCP Foundation makes a point to exaggerate the trope. The only photo the Foundation has on record of his home is filled to the brim with both regular Rubik's Cubes and a number of the many, _many_ harder derivatives made from it over the years, and he keeps a 4x4 Professor Rubik's in one of his pockets at all times. Place later explains this is largely symbolic, as his main field of study is pataphysics (which in the Foundation's universe is the study of how the fourth wall affects their fictional world in quantum science terms), and has compared the different ways he can manipulate the cube to different audience reactions and narrative tropes. The cube itself is also a tear in The Multiverse (classified SCP-6416) thanks to the complicated physics of the incident that gave him his current name, and is part of why many versions of him are a Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass.

    Web Video 

-   Henya the Genius of VShojo evokes, but ultimately subverts this. She's claimed to have an IQ of 999 and her visual design is heavy on cuboids, complete with an actual Rubik's Cube hanging off one of her belts. However, it turns out she's more than a little bit of a ditz, and during her debut, her attempt to demonstrate her genius by solving a cube in a flat thirty seconds had her accidentally exploding it into little pieces with her bare hands.

    Western Animation 

-   Ironically, this trope was deconstructed and defied in _Rubik, the Amazing Cube_, a short-lived series meant to capitalize on the toy's popularity. Pretty much every character could solve it within a minute, and while the main cast had an excuse (Rubik was powerless if his colors were scrambled, which happened by accident rather often) it made little sense for anyone else. That being said, it tended to be that Rubik being scrambled didn’t cause that many changes to him, at least not more than a regular Rubix Cube after being packaged.
-   _The Dating Guy_. VJ shows his simultaneous smarts and lack of social skills by solving a miniature Rubik's Cube inside his throat.
-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_: In the episode "Sheen's Brain", Jimmy uses a device that turns Sheen into a genius. One of the things Sheen did after that was solving a Rubik's cube blindfolded in about 5 seconds.
-   _The Simpsons_. In "HOMR", when Homer temporarily gains _slightly_ above-average intelligence (105, according to Homer himself), one scene shows him sitting on the couch between two baskets, one filled with unsolved Rubik's cubes, and the other filled with solved ones, as Homer takes one cube from the former basket and solves it in a few seconds without even looking at it.
-   _Spongebob Squarepants_: Parodied. In one episode, Sandy makes a Rubik's cube that solves itself.
-   In _Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?_, Robot Jones (being a superintelligent robot) is the front runner in a Rubik's Cube competition. His rivals, the Yogman twins, cheat by switching two of the tile labels of Jones' cube to make it unsolvable. He eventually solves it anyway, but it takes him literally all day, causing him to come dead last in the competition.
-   _Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur (2023)_: In "Moon Girl Landing", Lunella passively entertains Eduardo at lunch regularly by giving her an unsolved cube so she can solve it one-handed without looking. Later in the episode, one of the signs that Lunella's passion is in the pits is when she outright ignores his requests.
-   In the _Gravity Falls_ episode "Little Gift Shop of Horrors", one of the signs of Waddles' increased intelligence during the "Abaconings" segment is that he's able to solve a complicated puzzle box, the What-The-Heck-Ahedron, that Dipper was struggling with earlier.
-   Subverted in _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_, where Billy's father solves a demonic Rubik's Cube in seconds by switching the stickers around.
-   In _Ducktales 2017_, Black Heron demonstrates the effects of an intelligence-altering ray on a pair of Mooks, who goes from holding Rubik's Cubes to gnawing on them. At the end of the episode, one of the organization's leaders is shown performing a quick-solve before realizing the cube's wet.
-   _Close Enough_: In the episode "Bridgette the Brain", after taking an intelligence-enhancing pill, Bridgette kicks this trope up two notches and solves a 5x5x5 cube in less than two seconds.
-   In the _Family Guy_ episode "Baby Stewie", Brian claims that Stewie will inevitably become stupid due to his Griffin heritage despite being a genius baby. To prove this, he shows a video of Chris as a baby solving a Rubik's Cube. Stewie then builds a machine that will alter his genetics so he will remain smart for the rest of his life...but instead, it turns him into a regular baby. Brian tricked Stewie by playing a video of baby Chris **eating** the Rubik's cube in reverse to make it look like Chris had solved it.
