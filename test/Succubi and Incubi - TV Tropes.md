_O, father dear, I dreamed last night a man sat on me bed  
And I fear, when I awoke I could not find my maidenhead_

In folklore, incubi (always male) and succubi (always female) were demons who would sexually assault people in their sleep - the horrifying sensation of sleep paralysis, where you wake up and are unable to move, was known as ''incubus'' as late as Victorian times. Originally, these demons were not vampiric, had no need to feed, and were not particularly attractive, being sexual predators.

However, modern fiction writers don't want to use them like that, so the common traits of both succubi and incubi have become:

1.  They are incredibly attractive or at least project that appearance to their victim via Glamour or Shapeshifting abilities.
2.  They have an Extreme Libido and a hedonistic lifestyle.
3.  They feed through sexual contact, or on Lust itself. This sometimes manifests as Vampiric Draining on their partners and can even kill them.
4.  Their target's species or gender is of no importance to them.
5.  They're skilled and manipulative seducers and are incredibly proficient lovers.
6.  They're human-sized humanoids with bat-wings, sharp claws, small horns, and slim tails being common physical features. They may also have abnormal skin colors.
7.  They have Charm Person and Living Aphrodisiac powers.

Incubi and succubi are almost always treated as a species or type of demons, though rare stories instead make them a breed of vampires when they function similarly (with vampires feeding on blood for sustenance, incubi/succubi feeding on sex), but they are almost always evil.

In some legends, Satan himself changed shape to be both incubus and succubus. See, Old Scratch wants kids but can't produce human seed, so he becomes a succubus, receives some sperm from a guy, turns into an incubus, and passes it on to a woman. How this transmits satanic genes is a question not addressed as the theory was invented before Mendel's time, never mind Rosalind Franklin's. In some other legends, the first succubi and incubi were the children of Lilith, who was the true First Woman who got kicked out of Eden for fighting too fiercely for dominance over Adam, via laying with various Fallen Angels.

The offspring of these demons and a human are either demonic infiltrators of humanity or basically mortals with mysterious powers. The legendary Merlin is sometimes said to be the offspring of an incubus and a nun. Incidentally, the above mythology went a long way to explaining away pregnant nuns in the Middle Ages without destroying their virtues. Better to be seen as the victims of demonic rape than participants in consensual sex, one might suppose. (Admittedly, there were periods when people took a very dim view of violating vows of celibacy, if the vower weren't powerful or well-connected.) Several cases of actual rape in politically tricky circumstances also appeared to have been dealt with this way. Even more importantly, it explained why Merlin could use magic (which was seen as contrary to God's order), but still be one of the good guys.

In the more recent viewpoint, with its much more lenient view of sexually liberated women (and sex in general), they tend to be Not Always Evil and their depictions feature a far greater number of subversions on the classic interpretation of succubi and incubi than straight examples. Most of them tend to be portrayed as Cute Monster Girls or Reluctant Monsters. They usually become a Succubus in Love, who ends up being redeemed once they find true love. Their Vampiric Draining powers are either non-existent or are used for a relationship roadblock and angst as they Can't Have Sex, Ever without hurting the one they love.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _The Demon Girl Next Door_, while the fact their "true power" outfits are incredibly Stripperific and them having Dream Walker powers already gave strong hints about this, Lilith eventually tells Shamiko that they are a bloodline of succubi (and her father was an incubus by implication from the similar powers he was revealed to have). The reveal, most amusingly, ended up making a lot of the doujinshi for the series _more_ canon-compliant retroactively, as they had a tendency to assert that Shamiko's power set made her a succubus _before_ the official reveal.
-   Alde Hyde's _Dorei o Choukyou shite Harem Tsukuru_ features a creepy-looking man who bought three slaves of human-demon mixed blood descent with the intent to raise them for his harem, but ended up adopting them as his daughters instead. One of the demons that was part of their bloodlines was, of course, succubus, which leads to awkwardness on his part when their demonic bloodline awakens their hormones as they grow healthier and stop being malnourished under his care. An amusing part of the way the writer splits the SFW chapters and the mostly-optional NSFW chapters allows the readers to see the split between the creepy-looking man's viewpoint and the girl's private viewpoints. Of the three former slaves, Ruberry intends to ensure she doesn't end up helplessly ensnared by her own hormones, Daisy has developed a possessive attraction to the creepy-looking man, and Conia ends up being mostly-lazy, to the point that her adoptive father is sometimes frustrated by how little effort she puts into doing things.
-   _Dragon's Dogma_: The focus of the "Lust" episode is a succubus who's been feeding off of men as they stay at an inn.
-   _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA_: While Chloe is kinder and tamer than most depictions and definitely not a demon, her need to replenish mana to survive and ability (and apparent preference) to do it with Sex Magic makes her a succubus in all but name. "Kissing Demon" is not one of her nicknames for nothing!
-   _Goblin Slayer_: Incubi and Succubi exist, though they usually are just immaterial dream demons that at most induce mild euphoria as they drain their victims' vitality.
-   Mayu from _Good Luck! Ninomiya-kun_ is the Cute Monster Girl type. Ironically, for a succubus, she has androphobia, which is a problem, considering her inability to control her powers, particularly when stressed. The possibility of Shungo dying from Mayu involuntarily draining his life is used to keep him from going too far with her. Her incubus brother is pretty good-natured, too. Mind control (of the opposite sex) is included in the power set.
-   _Interspecies Reviewers_ feature succubi and incubi as a major part of worldbuilding. The entire series conceit of the various brothels of all species originates from the Succubus District, where willing and horny men go to seek succubi (and women of succubus blood descent of all species) to have sex with. There are also Lilim, a lesser breed of succubus that have little skill in pleasuring their partners, but compensate by having an insatiable appetite for sex. Incubi also exist in this world, as one attempted to try and join the Reviewers, but was ultimately rejected due to just handing out perfect tens like candy to all the succubus joints he visited.
-   The succubi in _Interviews with Monster Girls_ is a mixture of folklore and Hollywood variants. While like in the folklores the succubi are not fed by sexual vampirism, but their seductive powers and beauty more aligns to the Hollywood type. As for who can be affected by their seductive powers, though, they are a bit unconventional: the power to induce Erotic Dream is equal-opportunity, while the rest of their seductive powers is dependent on sexual orientation. At any rate, Satou, the only succubus featured in the series, is a Reluctant Monster, and goes to great lengths to avoid seducing anyone.
-   _KonoSuba_ has a group of succubi that runs a business. Rather than attacking people and feeding off of them by force, they offer a service where they give customers a dream of their choice at night. In exchange, they take a small amount of the customers' energy, which they claim isn't enough to interfere with their daily lives. For obvious reasons, every single male adventurer in Axel is sworn to keeping it a secret. When a rookie succubus risks exposing the whole thing after being caught in Aqua's barrier while trying to service Kazuma, he pretends to be under mind control to fight his party and give her an opening to escape. Kazuma gets beaten up for his efforts, but his plan ultimately works.
-   _Overlord_: Albedo is a succubus and was originally designed to be a nymphomaniac. Even though she's focused solely on Momonga now, she's still very "excitable". People who see her are uneasy because she has a level of beauty that could only be possessed by a demon. Which, of course, is exactly what she is.
-   Kurumu from _Rosario + Vampire_ is a Cute Monster Girl succubus. Before she joined Tsukune's Unwanted Harem and abandoned her Jerkass ways, she was a Femme Fatale, actively seducing the school. Kurumu can create illusions and sprout wings and a tail, all of which come in handy on a few occasions.
-   _Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle_: There is at least one succubus, but they don't feed with sex, per se. They feed on human vitality and survive by being popular.
-   MUK's _Tiny Evil_ features a succubus that falls for her 'prey' man, who summoned her to drain himself to death as a means of suicide. She refuses to kill him and ends up in a relationship with him.
-   _Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun_ is set in the Demon World, where being an incubus or succubus is a career path for jobs dealing with seduction, romance, beauty and so on. Interestingly, succubi and prospective succubi tend to be amongst the most sincerely friendly, pleasant, and empathetic characters in the story, and any given succubus is far more likely to be a Guile Heroine and/or Heroic Seductress than The Vamp, apparently due to their interests and skillsets eating into the normal demonic Lack of Empathy.
-   _Yuuutsu-kun to Succubus-san_: Sakuma is a succubus. The series opens with her trying to seduce Yuu so she can drain his life energy. His depression and subsequent lack of sexual urges put that plan to an end, prompting her to start taking care of Yuu and improve his condition so she can do her thing later. Fortunately, she doesn't _need_ to devour life force to survive, but it is preferred. She describes the act as feeling like she's wringing three hundred million lives out of her victim, adding "like a bunch of tadpoles."

    Comic Books 

-   _Captain Atom_: Incubus and Succubus were behind the coup that ousted the royal family of the Nightshade Dimension, murdered Eve's mother Queen Reah/Magda and kidnapped her brother Larry. Then they tried possessing Eve and Larry to make the two of them conceive a new vessel for their lord, which Eve strongly objected to and which worked out poorly for the demons.
-   In Polish comic book _Lil i Put_ the Succubus are played for comedy as creators take advantage of idea they are uncommon sight in series DIRECTED AT CHILDREN and make them very common creatures in the Lil and Put land among elfs and dwarfs. They are often seen doing wholsome and casual things - shopping for puppies, applying for a babysiting job and even taking part in a feminists march. The creators later pushed the joke further by making Foli - the only reacurring Succubus character - a teenage girl, who spend her time being an Granola Girl and an activist fighting for equal rights and spreading political correctness. While it's mentioned that Succubi are "demons from hell who sedduce men to consume their souls" we are yet to see them actualy do it or have characters be disturbed by their presence. In fact the only story where Miksja actualy explains to town follks what Succubuses do to warn them, after moment of silence every man in sight want to run to meet them with a glee on their faces.
    -   To be fair, never showing Succubi do their "thing" might be justify by the idea it's simply their offtime).
-   French comic artist François Marcela-Froideval has the hots for succubi (who doesn't?). They appear in many of his comic series, including _Six Six Six_, _Les Chroniques de la Lune Noire_ (_Black Moon Chronicles_), and the aptly-titled _Succubus_.
-   _Satana_, the sister of Daimon Hellstrom, is the Devil's daughter in Marvel Comics, and a succubus who feeds on human souls.
-   _XXXenophile Presents_: It had two installments of the erotic story of an incubus who is thoroughly benign, happily married to a human woman, and went public as an intellectual author to present an alternative view of Hell and its occupants. As such, sex with him is completely harmless and, as such, he is continually pestered by the neighboring women in his suburb. Even though he often gives in and indulges them, his wife has no problem with it, considering he never neglects her desires either.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Grouchy And The Love Doll", a Cubus spirit inhabits the titular love doll and uses that form to suck out Grouchy's life through intercourse. Strangely, the spirit regrets what it has done and allows herself to be struck by lightning to save Grouchy's life.
-   _The Gift Mercaba_ (Fanfiction.net link) has an interesting twist. When Shinji experiments with the Lexicon and summons Urd, one of her first acts in this realm is to turn every single Rei clone (yes, that Rei) into a succubus (they even hack SELEE's account dry to get all the money they'd need). Problem is, they can't reach their full potential until they taste lust for the first time - and they already have a target...
    
    **Rei**: I have it on good authority that he is becoming more interested in female-male interaction. That he is interested in pursuing a physical relation with several women I have met.  
    **Gendo**: The boy is likely guilty and using my money to procure pornography as he works the courage up to hire his first prostitute. You are permitted to use any action necessary to get a confession. Any means necessary, do you hear me?  
    **Rei**: Then I will engage him in as many acts of fornication and lust as possible to get him to confess his wishes. He will be not know what happened until he is a mass of putty in my hand sir.  
    **Fuyutsuki**: ...wait, _what_? You're going to do WHAT?!  
    **Rei**: I will engage in sexual acts of many diverse manners in an effort to expunge the data from Pilot Ikari. With his limited interaction with women, I am sure it will not take long for him to become a slave to my touch. Once he is in hand, I will get the information form him as requested.  
    **Gendo**: Ayanami? _(Rei summons a mental image of Gendo and Fuyutsuki getting it on, leaving the two retching and her free to leave)_
    
-   In _Holo-Chronicles_, as it is a fan-series for _hololive_ (read below), succubi are very much a thing, typically having horns and a tail. They also possess an ability called "autosuggestion", which is generally used for purposes of seduction. Our main succubus Aloe, however, by means currently undisclosed, uses this ability in a... different way.
-   In _Lies On_, (Fanfiction.net link), a _Death Note_ fanfic, Light becomes an incubus and ensnares L with his demonic powers.
-   _Mixed Company_ (Fanfiction.net link), an _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ oneshot, has Canada as a reluctant cambion (offspring of an incubus and human woman) who hasn't been "eating" for some time and struggles to not give in to eating his friend, America.
-   _Not the intended use (Zantetsuken Reverse)_: Chapter 4 mentions how the Succubus soul lets Soma eat / drink blood.
-   The protagonists of _The Return_ are a brood (and eventually three broods) of Friendly Neighbourhood Succubae.
-   A few appear in the _Shadowchasers Series_:
    -   In _Shadowchasers: Ascension_ Dante meets up with two. Early in the fic, he fights an erinyes named Castalla ("erinyes" being the lawful equivalent of a succubus in this continuity). While he easily avoids her attempts to seduce him, he later nearly succumbs to her far-more tempting mother, Novalar, one of the Big Bad's Co-Dragons.
    -   In _Shadowchasers: Backwater_, there's Tsuki, a succubus who is an Ascended Demon, a long ordeal at the hands of a cruel wizard who summoned her, followed by the kindness of a charity worker, leading to a Heel–Face Turn.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: Haara and Fiora infiltrate a city full of these while trying to escape the abyssal plane. Of particular note is Carnerri, a succubus who lets them hideout in her house when they ultimately draw too much attention to themselves.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The film _Grim Prairie Tales_ features a story about a man who meets a young pregnant woman on the lonely plains. They talk, get to know one another, and eventually curl up by the fire. The man is awakened in the night by the woman, no longer pregnant, achingly beautiful, and begging for sex. He goes to work, only to be sucked into her stomach through the vagina, making her pregnant once again as she begins to digest him.
-   _The Incubus_ is about the eponymous being raping and killing women in a small town. The driving force of the plot is finding out why.
-   _Jennifer's Body_: Jennifer turns into a type of succubus after she's sacrificed by Nikola, supposedly due to them trying to do a Virgin Sacrifice but her _not_ being a virgin. As a Succubus she becomes a demonic sexual predator who seduces human men in order to devour them as a Literal Maneater, which is the only way a succubus can sustain themselves, thus preserving their Healing Factor and enhanced strength. Her appearance doesn't change, except when she's preparing to devour her victims, which causes her to get a demonic Game Face with a Monster Mouth.
-   Clive Barker's _Saint Sinner_ had two succubus sisters as the main villains. Barker's involvement should tell you that they weren't traditionally attractive. There was also the spine-sucking to consider.
-   In the Sci-Fi Channel original _Soulkeeper_, there is a brothel full of these. Explained as damned souls in prostitute bodies, they otherwise appear to embody all the stereotypical succubus traits, and even transform into large demonic forms at various points.
-   "Amateur Night" in the Found Footage horror anthology _VHS_ features a succubus. Three college guys pick up a cute girl and take her to a hotel room, planning to secretly video events as amateur porn. In the middle of sex she morphs into a Humanoid Abomination with fangs and a gaping maw down the middle of her face. The youth wearing the glasses-cam flees down the fire escape but trips and is caught by the demon who tries to fellate him. Needless to say he's too terrified to respond. Distraught over this perceived rejection, she first weeps in a Corner of Woe then starts growling in rage, morphing into a One-Winged Angel that swoops him up into the air as he flees across the car park.

    Literature 

-   _Anita Blake_: Jean-Claude, and the others of Belle Morte's line, function as incubi/succubi, though they are no longer called such.
-   _Canticle_: Forneus is one who, unusually, _isn't_ Hot as Hell. Considering she's a succubus, you'd think she'd be quite easy on the eyes, but she's quite clearly past her prime.
-   In _The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump_, succubi and incubi form picket-lines to protest Angel City's vice laws.
-   The _Cassandra Palmer_ series features incubus, a type of lower level demon. Incubus are usually vain, self-centered individuals who posses people in order to interact in the human world. They feed off the life energy of mortals, which they usually get from sexual intercourse.
-   _Colt Regan_ has Succubi and Incubi as generally nice and productive members of society.
-   _The Dark Tower_:
    -   It features "demons" of both sexes, typically tied down to stone circles. With strong enough will, copulation can be a bargaining chip.
    -   It also portrays one of the rarer examples up above: the same demon takes Roland's seed in one book, and impregnates Susannah with it in another.
-   Parodied in the _Discworld_ story _Eric_, where we hear of a lonely old demonologist who wanted to conjure up a succubus but only ever managed a Neuralgia, "A demon what comes and has a headache at you," as the talking parrot puts it.
-   _Domina_: Malcanthet is the original succubus. She was apparently fond of using rape as part of her torture to break her victims.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Succubi and incubi are another name for the White Court, one of the four known species of vampires. The White Court uniquely remain close enough to human to count as them for most metaphysical purposes (except when using their ivory-skinned Super Mode) and as such are not inherently evil. Unlike the Red and Black courts they feed on emotions rather than blood - the majority induce Lust in others and feed on it through sex, with a smaller faction being based on Fear instead. Instead of suffering from the standard vampire Kryptonite Factor, The Power of Love is their holy water, and they feel pain if they even touch someone who is in True Love (even if the person they're in love with _is the vampire_). They're also all Even the Guys Want Him/Even the Girls Want Her\-level hot even without using their powers, thought this actually seems to be the literal Most Common Superpower in the Dresdenverse.
    -   One White Court vampire, Thomas Raith, is a main character and sometime Tragic Monster (due to a bad habit of refusing to feed, then overusing his Super Mode to the point his Horror Hunger overwhelms him). He eventually manages to sustain himself by pretending to be Camp Gay, becoming a hairdresser, and nibbling on the small amounts of intimacy he experiences from doing his customers' hair.
    -   The White Court have used their supernatural mojo to take control of the adult film industry and make themselves an absolutely ridiculous amount of money. It's also stated they've done such things in order to enable their own feeding patterns — _Blood Rites_ features the White King himself backing the work of an "entropy curse" on a porn production, as the director was striking out into porn that focused on intimacy and more realistic body types rather than hardcore and unattainable perfection.
    -   On a more traditional note, the Denarian-form of Rosanna takes on the traditional look of a succubus: beautiful, batwinged, and clearly demonic. While she doesn't draw energy or anything from tempting mortals, she is still a master at using her coercive abilities to tempt other mortals, often to open them up to the Denarians' temptations or keep existing Denarians under control.
-   _Eclipse_: The main character of the story, Alice, is a succubus. She has long, independent-thinking tendrils protruding from her arms, Hellish Pupils, gray eyes that turn amber and red, deathly pale skin, smoke-like darkness manifesting from her shadow-like clothes, razor-sharp fangs beneath her mask, a tornado-like whirlwind of smoke and shadows that can engulf an entire city, a Pocket Dimension kind of body that absorbs souls within herself, pieces of her body that she uses to create an entire dome, and the ability to indoctrinate people without needing to try. Various characters have suggested that this is the form she ALLOWS other people perceive of her, the form she's attempting to keep as humanoid as possible, or a form that is a self-imposed restraint keeping something even more abstract from popping out.
-   _The Fall of the House of Cabal_ featured Zarenyia, a succubine spider devil. While her bottom half is the body of a giant armored spider, her top half is that of a beautiful short-haired human with fiery red hair. Zarenyia's favorite activity is killing and mayhem, but sex and seduction isn't far off. Despite her inhuman bottom half, she's highly successful as she can produce powerful pheromones and she's not above using some magic, additionally she can shapeshift to a fully human form.
-   Ajulutsikael, a succubus, is one of the main characters of Mike Carey's _Felix Castor_ books - something of a subversion insofar as she settles down with a nice girl early on in her attempt to go native among the mortals.
-   _Forgotten Realms_ series summon these surprisingly rarely.
    -   The Drizzt Do'Urden novels generally stay away from the more sensual fiends (see below). However, during Wulfgar's years-long imprisonment in the Abyss, he was raped several times by succubi, who would sometimes have children by him — who were then eaten alive by his captor while he was forced to watch. Now _that_ is Chaotic Evil.
    -   In the _Starlight And Shadows_ trilogy, one drow priestess met an incubus after being thrown into Abyss. He was too impatient and she had a snake whip, so Hilarity Ensues.
-   The novel _If I Pay Thee Not In Gold_ has the seed passing type. In addition, the character is both succubus and incubus, but can only switch by having sex.
-   _Immortals After Dark_: A succubus and incubus are the female and male members of the Ubus species respectively. Ubus feed through the process of sex and live in their own dimensional plane which is connected to Earth via a portal in the woods of murk in Scotland. Ubus have the power to overwhelm people with sexual desire or use venom to take control of their partner. They're usually a peaceful race and loyal to their mates but those that are on earth tend to be violent rapists or monsters since exiled criminals of the Ubus were sent to Earth as punishment. This meant that most other immortals on Earth think Ubus are a bloodthirsty Always Chaotic Evil race.
-   The _InCryptid_ series features incubi and succubi who are the male and female members of the Lilu species respectively. The Lilu have the ability to release pheromones through their sweat and other bodily fluids which allow them to control the sexual responses of thoose around them and hence cause people around them to become aroused and sexually attracted to them.
-   "Incubust" is a Drabble by Terry Pratchett, which follows his rule that no magic user can do something by magic beyond their ability to do normally. So when a male wizard summons an incubus to assault a female rival, it sits on her bed saying "Honestly, this has never happened before..."
-   The webfiction _Kumiko The Demon Girl_ featured a demon who looks like the classic succubus as the Magical Girlfriend of the main character. Demons in this world feed by ripping out the souls of their targets and consuming them (killing the subject in question), but Kumiko decides to allow Ken (the protagonist) the chance to at least not die a virgin and finds that sex is not only enjoyable, but allows her to consume his soul in smaller chunks.
-   According to the infamous witch hunting manual, the _Malleus Maleficarum_, demons could not reproduce by themselves normally, so a succubus would seduce a human male to take his seed, and then pass it on to an incubus that would use it to impregnate a human woman, resulting in a half-demon known as a cambion. Anyone with a modern high school education (and specifically knowledge of how genetics work which wasn't available back in the day of author Heinrich Kramer) would know why this would not work and why the kid produced would be completely human instead, though believers in this would most likely posit that something supernatural took place in order to alter the semen to be demonic in nature.
-   _The Laundry Files: The Jennifer Morgue_ by Charles Stross features Ramona Random, an agent of the Black Chamber with a succubus bound to her. As the series is a mathematical take on the Cthulhu Mythos, however, this succubus is "merely" an extradimensional demonic intelligence bound to a person's soul (an unbound incubus is used in an earlier book to lure in a professor by posing as her ex). Ramona's got the bum end of the deal; the succubus eats the souls of whoever she sleeps with, and if she doesn't feed it, it eats hers. This causes problems when one of her victims dies of a heart attack before the moment of climax.
-   _Legendborn_: Merlins are part Incubi and Succubi, and share similar traits, but their seductive traits are “passive.” As William describes, they have unnatural beauty, unusual eyes, distinctive voice, and "one minute you’re taking bloodwork, the next you’re wondering if the infirmary bed will hold two people." On the other hand, the other Merlins besides Sel, like Douglas, are not described as particularly good looking.
-   Neil Gaiman uses this theme a few times:
    -   Lamia the Velvet from _Neverwhere_ is a classic succubus. She seems sweet, until she kisses the main character and he begins to turn into an icicle.
    -   Something like a succubus also appears in one of his short stories. A woman has sex with a male prostitute, who appears to have minor psychic abilities, and steals his powers and his memories.
-   _Once_ by James Herbert is a British horror/fantasy story which features a man dreaming about being fellated, only to wake up to see a succubus at the end of his bed, stealing his semen for use in an evil ritual.
-   In Poul Anderson's _Operation Chaos_, our hero goes on his honeymoon, which is interrupted by an incubus/succubus pretending to be a brother/sister pair (only one demon). The Power of Love triumphs in the end (and the fact that the hero is a werewolf).
-   In L. Jagi Lamplighter's _Prospero's Daughter_ trilogy, one of the Three Shadowed Ones is an incubus.
-   Simon R. Green has used succubi in more than one series.
    -   _Forest Kingdom_: In the _Hawk & Fisher_ spinoff series' book 1, the sorcerer Gaunt keeps a succubus bound in a magic circle as a companion. He admits that she's a source of pleasure and also for much of his power, and she's the one who carried out the Devil's Hook massacre, single-handedly destroying the gangs that controlled the area. She's also capable of generating fire.
    -   _Nightside_:
        -   _Hex and the City_: The succubus Pretty Poison provides backup for John Taylor on an investigation. Succubi are depicted here are demons who feed off lust and help tempt humans into damnation. Their appearance changes depending on the sexual preferences of whoever is looking at them. In their true form though they are monstrous-looking demons.
        -   _The Unnatural Inquirer_: The reporter Bettie Devine is a Half-Human Hybrid whose mother was a succubus who apparently seduced a member of the Rolling Stones and got pregnant with her as a result. Betty appears as beautiful woman with a short skirt and devil horns.
-   Graham Masterton's first _Night Warriors_ novel has Asmodeus as the Big Bad and he's going around seducing women in the form of a handsome but otherwise normal man and impregnating them with his Chest Burster\-style offspring.
-   _Succubus Blues_ and sequels are an Urban Fantasy series that follows Georgina, a 2000-something year old succubus who works for the devil and hates her job. The primary function of her powers is to corrupt souls, and, to that end, she can feed off of mortals' life energy; the purer of spirit, the more energy she gains and he loses. When sleeping with her Jerkass boss, he only gets a little tired, but in the denouement of the first book, she almost kills a man just by kissing him. Possibly, he actually died and was revived. She only has shapeshifting and glamour by way of superpowers, though.
-   In one of Tais Teng's novels, the main character curses her teacher to be visited by a demon known as the Lady with the Long Tongue. When this demon appears to him that night, she is described as the distilled essence of all his lustful fantasies, the perfect sexual being he has dreamt of and desired since his teenage years - until she opens her mouth.
    
    "He stayed away from school for several months. When he finally returned, he was marked with sudden age, a grey shape that hunched and shuffled and left too many lights on at night."
    
-   _The Salvation War_: Subverted in _Armageddon???_ chapter 76, where it's long since been discovered that succubi just operate using telepathy and pheromones... leaving them perfectly vulnerable once countermeasures such as air filtration against the pheromones are used. Instead of getting her way, the succubus Lugasharmanaska is unpleasantly surprised when President George W. Bush actually uses the infamous "with us or against us" line on her, revealing that "we" knew all along about her attempts to play Earth against Hell and vice versa, and only let her do so as long as it suited "them"... before separately showing the queen of the succubi that he's as immune to her, too.
-   Mack the half-demon from _Tales of MU_ is widely speculated to have been fathered by an incubus (and, by extension, to be half-succubus herself, though she feeds on virgin blood rather than sex).
-   In the short story _They Only Come In Dreams_, a man in the modern day is visited by a succubus. She tells him how her kind isn't doing so well nowadays thanks to there being less virgins, but they're learning to adapt. Despite her telling him that the act will do him no harm and she'll just feed on the energy that the sex will release, the man is so uptight that he ends up refusing her. Shocked, she vanishes, but not before smiling and echoing how their kind has learned to adapt. He then tries to go back to sleep... only now, there's an _incubus_ in his bed. And the horrified way in which the final paragraph is written implies this one's not going to take no for an answer...
-   The Gancanagh in _Wicked Lovely_, whilst being Fae rather than demon, are basically incubi. One of them, Niall, is a Reluctant Monster on account of this. They are unnaturally alluring, and their touch is addictive and, eventually, fatal.
-   One of _The Witcher_ novels mentioned a blonde succubus, whom local ladies wanted dead, local gentlemen wanted alive (arguing that she visits only healthy people, no one's died, no problem), and neither Geralt nor the local sorceress is seriously bothered about. She ceased her "visits" for a while, apparently in awe of Geralt's reputation, though (or simply because of being too..."distracted" by a passing vampire).

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Being Human (UK)_: Succubi and incubi are a rare type of supernatural creature, with only one example, the succubus Yvonne, appearing in the entire series. They are Human Demon Hybrids who look almost entirely human, but any member of the opposite gender they touch will instantly seem to fall in love with them, and they inflict Out with a Bang on any human they have intercourse with.
-   An incubus Latin Lover appears in one episode of _Blood Ties (2007)_.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Giles specifically mentioned that succubi and incubi should be drawn to the Hellmouth when he was explaining it in the first season, but, oddly, we never see any.
    -   Shortly after her introduction, Tara sneakily disrupted a "locate demons" spell Willow was casting, which led to months of online speculation that she might be a succubus. She's human, though. (She just thought she wasn't.)
-   One appears in _Charmed_ in the episode "She's a Man, Baby, a Man!" and Prue changes into a man to lure her.
-   An incubus shows up in one episode of the now-canceled live-action adaptation of _The Dresden Files_. This incubus (a proper demon in the TV show's mythology) was using women to try and create a "son" for himself. The incubus can control women with a touch, similar to the _Dungeons and Dragons_ version of the succubus. This particular incubus forces another private eye (played by Claudia Black!) to murder Harry (or, at least, try to murder Harry, who uses his magic to save himself).
-   _The Gates_ had Andie, a sympathetic succubus.
-   The _Kolchak: The Night Stalker_ episode "Demon in Lace" had a succubus as a spirit that would possess the bodies of beautiful, recently dead women and would drain the lifeforce out of men.
-   The main character of _Lost Girl_ is a succubus who discovers this by accident when she kills her boyfriend the first time she has sex by draining the life from him. She's only able to sleep with supernatural creatures because they can survive it, but can "feed" by taking a little bit of energy from normal humans. Later on, she learns how to use her powers for good by giving life energy _back_ to those near-death, saving their lives.
-   In _The Middleman_, fashion mogul Roxy Wasserman and her staff are all reformed succubi and incubi.
-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_: In the episode "Caught in the Act", an alien parasite causes a chaste college girl to become a hypersexual life-sucking succubus who swings both ways.
-   A succubus appears in episode 5 of the third series of _Sea Of Souls_, where she starts dating one of the team. She ends up pregnant with his baby. Even if it was ever going to brought up again, it's now an Aborted Arc.
-   _Sleepy Hollow_: One appeared in season 2. It is a demonic monster that feeds on a person's life force, choosing its victims by seeking out people who bear a strong desire for another. Secret desires are especially attractive to them. It's unusal in that it doesn't actually need to have sex with its victims: simply being near it is enough to allow it to drain life force.
-   _Twin Peaks_. BOB is roughly an incubus who feeds on fear and pain, so the more traumatic the experience, the better.
-   _The X-Files_: In "Avatar", when a murdered prostitute is found in AD Skinner's bed, Mulder speculates a succubus may be involved, as she sometimes kills female rivals. However, the exact nature of the supernatural woman who appears to be watching over Skinner is not established; the trope is further subverted in that she is portrayed as middle-aged, rather than as a young, beautiful seductress.

    Music 

-   The song "La Salsa du Démon" by French band L'Orchestre du Splendid' portrays Belzebuth as a literally and figuratively horny demon. In performances he was portrayed by Jacques Delaporte, who fell sick and was temporarily replaced by Coluche in 1981. The character of Vampirella from the same song meanwhile is portrayed as a succubi who targets young male virgins.

    Mythology 

-   Myths of this sort emerged in multiple monogamous societies where one gender (usually, men) traveled while the other saw to the homestead (say, fishers, traders, or trade-farmers who lived distant to market). Tales of attractive female vampires that prey on unwary travelers were (are!) perpetuated to keep the errant men from cheating on their wives, as well to prevent younger men from falling in the risks of thinking with their nether regions.
-   Incubus (male) and succubus (female) are demons who feed on the life-force of human beings of the opposite sex. Some sources say that they are one and the same, taking the form of both genders. Those names literally translate as "one who lies on top or in (masculine form)", "one who lies below (masculine form)", "one who lies on top or in (feminine form)", and "one who lies below (feminine form)", respectively. Maybe it's a reference to their preferred sex position?
-   Lilith of ancient Mesopotamian/Jewish mythology, who went on to mother an entire race of demons.
    -   The Mesopotamian Lilu and Lilitu were not a single entity but a whole family. Not all of them were horny devils, but Gilgamesh was directly descended from one of the many who were.
    -   The Jewish Lilith started out as a baby-eating rape demon and enemy of mankind who took advantage of Adam after he was kicked out of Eden. Later, medieval legends changed her into the first woman, who Adam kicked out of Eden because she refused to let him be on top... interesting, considering the aforementioned etymology of "succubus" and "incubus".
-   In Vajrayana Buddhism, dakinis are a class of demonesses that enjoy seducing men and stealing their semen. They are not inherently evil, however, and some esoteric rituals involve summoning them to help you understand the cosmos (yes, sometimes through ritual sex).
-   The _Orang-Minyak_ of Malaysian Mythology, a man covered in black oil who rapes sleeping women.
-   The Zburator (flyer) of Romanian folklore and folklore inspired literature is often described as a young man with demonic features (sometimes a shapeshifter, who's true form is a dragon of some kind, or a vampire like being), who visits adolescent girls in their dreams.
-   Guaraní mythology has the Curupi or Kurupi, an incubus that rapes women with the help of an extensible phallus, which can even act as a tentacle.

    Podcasts 

-   _Metamor City_: Isri is a succubus who lives openly among humans and has no malicious intentions towards them. She does feed off sexual energies, but will not do so without consent and doesn't kill anyone.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Changeling: The Lost_ has Incubi in general as creatures that dart about human dreams, but Succubi, in particular, fill this role, taking on the form of human desire. In another reference to old myth, a woman who receives the very special attentions of a succubus may become pregnant with a cambion. Likewise, there's the incubus/succubus (depends on gender) Kith of changeling, which has an easy time dealing with lustful humans.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Succubi are a long-established type of evil outsider, but _which_ type has varied from edition to edition. Through 3rd Edition, succubi were Chaotic Evil demons who used their shapeshifting abilities and supernatural charm to tempt mortals into evil acts, or lure them in close enough to drain their vitality with a kiss or "act of passion." 3.5th Edition added lilitus as an evolved form of succubi that, rather than seducing individual mortals, used their powers and charisma to infiltrate religious organizations and corrupt them into demon worship. 4th Edition reshuffled the alignments and monster rosters so that succubi, as more human-looking fiends, were reclassified as devils, specifically as Angels of Love who had foolishly sided with Asmodeus in hopes of gaining the freedom to spread love freely. As detailed in an "Ecology of the Succubus" article in _Dragon_, succubi's life-draining kiss is the result of a spiritual void where their love once was, but succubi are also the devilish breed most likely to turn their backs on the Hells and seek redemption. As of 5th Edition, succubi are Neutral Evil, generic Fiends that can be found throughout the Lower Planes among both devils and demons.
        -   On the topic of incubi, a 3.5th Edition issue of _Dragon_ portrayed them as shark-toothed men with rat-like tails, jet black eyes, horns like an antelope, and cloven feet, the embodiment of "masculine sexual evil" that exist to rape and kill anyone. 5th Edition clarifies instead that incubi and succubi are the same breed of fiend, which can assume whatever sex and gender they think will appeal to a victim.
        -   In the _Ravenloft_ setting, an incubus known as the Gentleman Caller is one of the setting's worst Big Bad villains, beguiling numerous female NPCs over the years, and fathering enough half-fiend offspring with high-ranking women to destabilize or corrupt more than one domain's political system.
        -   _Planescape_ mentions alu-fiends, half\-succubi who have inherited weaker versions of their mothers' powers. Not all of them are Chaotic Evil like their mothers, but they count as a "demonic" race of lesser tanar'ri rather than tieflings.
    -   The Lawful Evil devils have erinyes, who started as the baatezu's equivalent to succubi, but even in early editions they differentiated themselves by using their good looks as part of a larger plot to spread tyranny rather than simply tempting a mortal into bed and draining their soul away. Around 3rd Edition they were reimagined as a darkly beautiful breed of all-female Fallen Angels, unique among devils for being born to an erinyes parent rather than converted from a tortured mortal soul shell, and the subject of admiration, jealousy and lust from their fellow baatezu. 3.5th Edition introduced brachinas, erinyes that were promoted to an even more beautiful form to use to tempt mortal clerics and paladins into evil, made easier by their beguiling abilities and a contact poison that weakened victims' Wisdom and therefore Will saves. Since 4th Edition classified succubi as devils and introduced the notion of non-good angels, erinyes were recast as Hell's tormenters, charged with pursuing and punishing mortals who broke infernal contracts, similar to their role in Greek mythology. As of 5th Edition, erinyes are elite devlish soldiers (with a Challenge Rating of 12 compared to a succubus/incubus' 4), still strikingly beautiful, but without any shapeshifting or seductive abilities whatsoever, and no longer exclusively female.
-   _Infernum_, a game that uses the D20 system, both plays this trope straight and subverts it. Malcubi (the gender neutral plural term - incubus is the male singular, succubus the female single) resemble gorgeous human beings of the appropriate sex, and were created as an alternative way to breed demons (the default is dissolving a living demon in an alchemical pit, known as a Spawning Pit, with its organs mutating into maggot-things that will mature into full demons after about 6 months) and quickly shifted to being prostitutes for the creators of the demon breeds. However, they have no innate ability to harm their lovers through physical contact (beyond their claws); their racial powers consist of preternatural charm, bat-like wings to let them fly, mind control, and entering the minds of dreamers. It's played straight, however, with the Chain of Lust collection of mutations. This set of four powers allows the demon to befuddle the minds of others, and culminates in the Succubus Kiss, which lets the demon drain energy from others with a touch. The Chain of Lust, however, is a Common mutation and can thus be taken by any of the nine breeds...which includes Artificers (dwarfish things with exoskeletons of steel), Beasts (which look like demonic Furries at best and Eldritch Abominations at worst), and Imps. There are also two Houses (essentially countries, in political terms) devoted to this trope; Astyanath are Cenobite-style worshippers of pain, while Riethii are more traditional hedonists.
-   _Macho Women with Guns_: Bat-Winged Bimbos From Hell are an Always Female One-Gender Race of demons renowned for their incredibly beauty, high libidos, and less than impressive brainpower. They're even playable in the D20 system version of the game, where they are characterized as unemployed succubi being allowed to run around on Earth whilst the Demon Lords And Arch Devils have more important things to do. Many are even directly under infernal orders to _help rebuild society_, since the post-apocalyptic struggle for survival keeps most people too busy to really engage in sinful behavior and condemn themselves to Hell upon death.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   Succubi are demons "formed from the souls of particularly lustful and rapacious evil mortals". They seduce mortals and suck out their souls during sex. Incubi form from similar souls, but while succubi use a combination of beauty, persuasion, and sometimes mind control to entice mortals, incubi are forceful and sadistic and lack the soul-sucking kiss, preferring to torture people to death. Both are shapechangers who take on whatever form is convenient, though the true forms of most succubi and incubi are female and male respectively.
    -   Erinyes also appear on the devils' side, but have lost this angle, instead adhering to their mythological inspiration as pursuers of vengeance and bloody justice. The bestiary specifically notes that they lack the subtlety and patience to be seducers. The first "Book of the Damned" notes that they detest mortals and the closest they come to such intimacies is letting those beguiled by their beauty approach before attacking them.
    -   The divs have their own take on this with the Pairaka, who embodies "the corruptive nature of unbridled lust". As a result, they are not only beautiful and seductive fiends, but also Plague Masters, who infect those who succumb to their charms with diseases like the shakes and bubonic plague.
    -   The daemonic equivalent of the succubus, introduced in the third _Book of the Damned_ sourcebook, is the Erodaemon, who embodies death by heartbreak. They approach mortals and insinuate themselves into their victim's life, and then bring their victim's life crashing down around them, until they are so overwhelmed by grief that they kill themselves. They break apart marriages, kill children or cause them to leave their families, destroy reputations, extinguish faith, curdle family ties, and bit by bit savor the slow disintegration of their victims’ emotional well-being and consequent physical deterioration.
    -   Nocticula is the Monster Progenitor of all succubi in the Pathfinder universe and is often referred to as the "Succubus Queen". She possesses most of the traits associated with them, such as their unnatural beauty, their skill at seduction and carnal pleasure, and their shapeshifting powers. Her natural form also shares the physical characteristics succubi have, such as the bat-like wings, sharp talons, hooved feet and prehensile-tails.
    -   Arueshalae from the adventure path _Wrath of the Righteous_ and its video game adaptation is a succubus. Ever since her meeting with Desna, though, she has set out to put this image in the past. Her full-body picture shows her covering herself entirely save for her hands and head, and one potential task to redeem herself is to fall in love and have that love reciprocated.
-   _Vampire: The Requiem_:
    -   Although not devils (or demons) by definition, the vampires from the Daeva clan are (fitly) nicknamed Succubi by others. They are awfully sexy, have the power to bedazzle people, and, even though they don't need to feed through sexual intercourse, they do blend hunger and lust together. Some theories say that they are descendents of a succubus sex _GODDESS_, Ishtar.
    -   The sourcebook _Chicago By Night_ featured, among its countless characters, a succubus who survived on sex. In this interpretation, she didn't necessarily suck the blood or souls of her victims so much as kill them by sheer exhaustion. This was a version _before_ the White Wolf series expanded beyond its Vampire milieu, so she may have picked up some more definitive game rules since then.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Used as inspiration for a few cards:

    Video Games 

-   _Age of Wonders_: The Succubus unit. They are beautiful Winged Humanoid female demons clad in Stripperific armor that can Seduce enemy units.
-   _Alice in the Country of Hearts_: Despite being an incubus, Nightmare is actually the most innocent potential suitor.
-   _Arena of Valor_: Veera is a succubus who corrupts and devours people's souls. She also comes in with a stunning kiss.
-   _Auri Mod_: Naamah is a demon who can charm her foes with her active item and (rarely occurring) heart tears. She's even unlocked if you obtain the Succubus familiar as Auri.
-   _Barony_: Succubi fit the typical depiction as seductive feminine demons who utilize magic to confound and charm others.
-   _The Binding of Isaac_: The creatures are referenced, but with the connection to sex not brought up. Since the game takes place in the imagination of six-year old, it's implied that Isaac has heard of them but doesn't really understand what they are. Succubus and Incubus are collectible items in the _Afterbirth_ expansion. They're both Adorable Evil Minions that look like little demons with red eyes and bat wings. Incubus follows you around and fires tears that are identical to yours, while Succubus bounces around the room and provides a damage-boosting aura.
-   _Bloodhound_ contains succubi as a common, low-level demon enemy, depicted as redheaded women with horns and wings. And attacks you wearing only gauntlet and boots.
-   _Bloodline Heroes Of Lithas_ has a clan of incubus and succubus - The Luxuriant. Incubus Gnassag is a love interest of main character, despite he appears in late story chapters, when the player most likely already have him as a companion.
-   _Board Game Online_: They're a player character class. Most of their playstyle revolves around sex, such as infecting other players with Sexually Transmitted Diseases (to which the -cubus are immune) or making sexual rituals for their benefit.
-   _Castlevania_ uses them both as regular monsters in several games and as named bosses with flirty energy-draining attacks in _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_, _Castlevania: Lament of Innocence_, and the PSP remake of _Castlevania: Rondo of Blood_. The last one is the hero's girlfriend, if you fail to save her.
    -   The games with female protagonists are...interesting about it. In _Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin_, succubi-type monsters yell "You filthy cow!" when Charlotte gets in range (as opposed to declaring "_I'll_ play with you!" to Jonathan). In _Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia_, on the other hand, they all call Shanoa "cute little kitty"...
    -   Carmilla's servant Laura from _Rondo of Blood_ and _Portrait of Ruin_ will try to feed on either males or females in her "gown" form.
-   In _Catherine_, the eponymous character fulfills many of the same narrative roles filled by this trope in less mundane stories: she challenges the protagonist's fidelity by being exactly the sort of person that would appeal to him most. This eventually leads to when Catherine is revealed to be a succubus. Vincent can become an incubus, if the player follows a certain path. And the whole bit about "less mundane stories" is just a Red Herring to keep the game's presence on this page from being a spoiler.
-   _Champions Online_: The Succubi appear as floating human females with pinkish-red skin and transform into monstrous demons in battle, using fire-based ranged area attacks.
-   _City of Heroes_: It features them as a minor enemy class under the Circle of Thorn. They're actually quite feared, due to their hard-to-block ability to confuse PCs into attacking each other.. however, considering that they mainly appear in _City of Villains_ (with its Character Class reliant on its minions - that all go berserk if the master is confused), some consider this to be more of a perk than a problem.
-   _Coffee Talk_: Lua is a succubus, but surprisingly, her sex life goes almost completely unmentioned and she's not portrayed as any more or less promiscuous than the average person. On the other hand, the negative stereotypes about succubi are hinted to be a big part of why Baileys' family is against their relationship.
-   _Corruption of Laetitia_: Gaia is a succubus Arch-Demon, but despite having the vessel of lust, she isn't as openly lustful as traditional succubi. She detests loveless relationships and is reluctant to start a relationship if she thinks it could lead to consequences for those around her.
-   In _Dante's Inferno_, there are several in the Circle of Lust, including Cleopatra, the Boss of that stage. If the player lets Dante fall for her attempts to seduce him, a Non Standard Game Over occurs.
-   Downplayed with Morrigan and Lilith in _Darkstalkers_. They are lustful succubi. However, in the world of _Darkstalkers_, succubi sustain themselves by creating a special liquid from their bodies. Said liquid can be made from any sort of pleasure (which includes sex, but is not restricted to just that): Morrigan in particular is a big fan of feeding from the thrill of combat and seduction. Because of this, and being quite friendly and benevolent instead of evil and malicious, neither of them have ever killed any humans through sex. However, if they were kept away from excitement for too long, they'd die.
-   _Dawncaster_: Serena is a succubus who enchants humans and turns them into her playthings. In fact, it is possible to skip her battle entirely if you offer her new toys to play with.
-   Diablo has an army of succubi in, well, _Diablo_, and his brother Baal's personal harem is unleashed in _Lord of Destruction_, the expansion to the sequel. Albeit, they're not particularly sexual creatures, rather color-coded, fireball-flinging, batwinged, naked women.
-   _Diablo III_ also has succubi, which start appearing as you go through Arreat Crater in Act III. They are stated to be the daughters of Cydaea, Azmodan's consort and one of his Sin Lieutenants, the Maiden of Lust. Act IV features the Vile Temptresses and Hell Witches, which act in all ways like the succubi.
-   Succubi are featured as a monster class in _Disgaea_, more or less carried over from _La Pucelle_.
    -   _Disgaea 5_ brings us Seraphina, the Succubus Princess of Gorgeous. To that end, her Overload skill allows her to charm male enemies specifically.
-   _Divinity: Original Sin II_: Almira is a succubus, a human-looking demon who can enthrall mortals with her kiss.
-   _Dragon's Dogma_: As demons don't exist in _Dragon's Dogma_ beyond Daimon, the setting's Succubi are instead bat-like Harpies, who have no interest in seduction.
-   The _Dresden Files RPG_, written with input from the series' author, says that only House Raith is what would normally be considered incubi/succubi. All the other clans are simply Emotion Eaters with appropriate weaknesses (for example, one feeds on fear and is harmed by courage).
-   _Dungeons_: Kalypso, Deimos' former lover , is a succubus. She can bewitch heroes, seduced Marthas into changing sides and she tricks a goblin into opening her cell door in the first level of the expansion.
-   _Elvira 2: The Jaws of Cerberus_ has a particularly horrifying succubus: in the haunted house area, you will find a room where you suddenly feel the urge to sleep. Suddenly, you see a buxom, beautiful woman giving you kissy-faces (and you can actually see her nipples through her top). But when you get on the bed, she gets on top, and her head morphs to...well, this.<small>◊</small> It's Game Over for you, unless you cast the Courage spell before entering the room.
-   _Epic Battle Fantasy 4_: Since a succubus is a horny devil, the medal for defeating Dark Natalie, calls her one: —> Defeat a busty succubus on Epic Difficulty.
-   _Eternal Senia: Hydrangea After The Rain_: The Succubus type enemies, with their bat-like wings and tails, wearing midriff-baring outfits and a pink Heart Symbol in their art, presumably referencing love / lust.
-   _Gems of War_: One of the troops from the Blighted Lands is the Succubus, who has a Kiss of Death ability which drains a target's mana and leaves it vulnerable.
-   _Hazelnut Hex_ has a succubi boss who can fire heart-shaped projectiles on you.
-   Succubis are enemies in _Hero of Sparta II_, depicted as purple-skinned, horned demon women who tries seducing you in their introduction cutscene. When it fails, they try attacking you instead.
-   In _Heroes of Might and Magic V_, Succubi are ranged attackers for the Inferno faction. While they act the part, only their alternative promotion in the second expansion actually have the ability to seduce enemies.
-   _Impaler_ have succubi as a recurring enemy type, depicted as nude (nothing to see, the game's graphics are pixels), horned women with leathery bat-wings.
-   _The Last Sovereign_: Succubi comprise half of The Horde that invaded the continent of Arclent in the backstory alongside the orcs. Succubi hit all four qualifiers, though their seeming ability to steal souls is implied to be more like Life Draining in practice. The local theology would have you believe them to be literal Always Chaotic Evil demons but in truth, succubi are a species of individuals each with their own little quirks. Quirks that often revolve around sex but still. The player character gains several succubi party members and all of them are fully fleshed out individuals in their own right.
-   _League of Legends_ features Evelynn, "Agony's Embrace", who largely appears as the game's resident succubus-inspired champion, but is more of a twist on the concept. She features many of the standard tropes — having an obviously demonic, but attractive guise of a near-naked woman, a flirtatious persona with a sexualized slant, and is very literally a demon that feasts off the intense emotions of her victims. Where the twist comes is the fact that her preferred emotion isn't lust or even anything directly to do with sex (she at no point ever has sex with her victims), but rather _agony_ — the way that demons in Runeterra work is that prospective victims must have a "hint of desire" for their negative emotion of preference to be effective, and it just so happens that instilling thoughts of sex is the most easy way to excite a desire for pain, and anyone who falls for her trap become tortured as slowly and horribly as possible.
-   The Succubus and Incubus monsters from _Lost Kingdoms II_ (and they even get a card combo when used together).
-   _Mabinogi Fantasy Life_:
    -   Kristell is a succubus, although she is never shown to do any of the things commonly associated with succubi, due to having cast away that life out of love for Tarlach and become a priestess.
    -   Also, Elatha is an incubus. However, it's later revealed that he is not one by birth; he was turned into one as a favour to Morgant. He is, in fact, a demi-god.
-   In _MadWorld_, Elise is quite obviously a succubus, but can still turn into bats. She makes for large amounts of Distracted by the Sexy, and is the only boss we don't see die. Awesome rack on her, though!
-   _Minion Masters_ has the Shyrakk-Twins. One is a ranged Succubi minion that teleports backwards when hit by a melee attack and the other is a melee Inccubus minion that teleports forwards to anyone who hits it with a ranged attack in a certain radius (unless it's a flying minion).
-   _Nethack_: Foocubi (the _Nethack_ term for incubi/succubi of the opposite sex to the player, which is both a pun on the metasyntactic variable "foo" and a fairly obvious Double Entendre) can strip the player naked and...you know. This intercourse gives the player a semi-randomly chosen benefit/penalty which may include a power boost, making "foocubus dancing" a popular sport.
-   Fall-From-Grace, an NPC from _Planescape: Torment_, was a Lawful Neutral and _chaste_ succubus priestess (and an agnostic priestess at that), who ran the Brothel For Slaking _intellectual_ Lusts. Her cadre of "prostitutes", all very lovely in their own way (though some in a very...nonhuman fashion), can be called upon to stimulate their patrons' intellect, ranging from playing chess or debating the finer points of governmental policies to storytelling or verbally abusing you. Fall-From-Grace had been sold to Baatezu (mortal enemies of her species the Tanar'ri as they are Lawful Evil devils) by her mother as a slave, but won her freedom by winning a contest that required improvisation. _Planescape Torment_ uses AD&D Second Edition rules, but succubi were in the second edition, too, and just as Always Chaotic Evil.
-   _Princess & Conquest_: Desert Princess is a succubus, and it shows — Anon only needs 2 Affinity with her to have sex, as compared to the standard 3.
-   _Project × Zone_: Morrigan is a succubus, so her dialogue is peppered with innuendo and she constantly expresses her desire to "tempt" other members of the cast. Too bad she's partnered with an uptight cop.
-   _Recettear_: The Succubus Bow implies the trope with its name, but it's more about general temptation, as its Flavor Text says:
    
    A bow reportedly found in the outer dark. It seems to tempt the user into doing horrible things...
    
-   _Rune Factory 5_ introduces the Rune Factory series' version of succubi and their first representative, Ludmila. Rather than sex, Rune Factory succubi are more generalized Emotion Eaters who can invade others' dreams to feed upon their positive feelings, but who can also receive small amounts of sustenance just by being surrounded by those with happy emotions. They're also said to be especially skilled potion-makers and fortune-tellers. Ludmila prefers not to invade dreams and only feeds on ambient happiness, giving her a kindly For Happiness mentality as she tries to make everyone around her as happy as possible. However, she does still toy with the tropes by being madly in love with the protagonist, regardless of circumstances, AND by being a bit of a masocist, but this seems to be more of a "Ludmila thing" than a "succubus thing."
-   You play as a succubi in _She Will Punish Them_, a dark-fantasy ARPG where you're tasked with draining men of their energy to replendish your powers.
-   The _Shin Megami Tensei_ series has succubi and incubi as demons, generally with charm and drain type spells. Interestingly, while the succubus appears as a generic sexy anthropomorphic demon, the incubus is a small imp-like demon with a huge penis. Frighteningly, Incubi in the first game know binding magic, but not charm magic.
-   The _Neverwinter Nights_ mod _Tales of Arterra_ has an unusual take on succubi, presenting them as slaves with no capacity to think for themselves rather than actually evil monsters. The Out with a Bang element comes from the succubus' ability to cause a man's heart to burst, but that ability is voluntary, thus widening the uses demon lords put their succubi to and allowing Persephyths to take her place as a possible Love Interest.
-   While Succubi in _The Witcher_ are as sex-crazed as most examples on this list, they do have some unique traits unto themselves. First, they're closer in design to Fauns: goat legs and horns. Secondly, they don't drain the life force of people they mate with for sustenance. However, their libidos are so uncontrollable that they've driven people to madness or death via sheer exhaustion. Their bestiary entry outwardly states that usually they mean no harm, and any harm they do cause is purely accidental through the difference in their strength and endurance and the one they're lusting after.
-   _World of Warcraft_: Warlocks of 20th level or higher can learn how to summon a succubus as a minion, using the hearts of pure men to entice her from her home plane. They also clearly enjoy being spanked. They also have the spell "Seduce", a channeled effect that completely incapacitates the succubus's target (and causes little hearts to float over his or her head) until the effect ends or the victim takes damage. Hostile NPC succubi often have the same ability. And yes, it works just as well on female characters as it does males. To put a bit of a twist on it, succubi in the _Warcraft_ universe are revealed in _Rise of the Horde_ to be something of an anomaly: most demons _aren't_ particularly interested in sex. (The man'ari eredar spy Talgath, in particular, comes off as downright prudish.) According to The Other Wiki, Warcraft succubi may genuinely fall in love with their summoner, so if they try to get the warlock in bed, it may be motivated by actual affection and not just the desire to steal your soul. Shadowlands added the ablity to summon an Incubus instead who function identically, and as part of an effort to be more inclusive of players who prefere to have a scantly clad male demon at their side, a lower quality version of the model was made and back-ported into both versions of Wo W Classic
-   _Yandere Simulator_: Multiple:
    -   The Basu Sisters: Two Punny Name, Family Theme Naming, Ambiguously Human, sisters whose names are Engrish for "Succu-" and "Incu-" bus. They speak as if they're not human, referring to other humans as "the humans", and when talking about the Occult Club's research into demons, the subtitles give Scare Quotes to the idea that demons are "fictional things". The sisters are:
        -   Sakyu Basu, whose student profile notes that she's "rumored to be a succubus."
        -   Inkyu Basu, whose student profile notes that she's "rumored to be a vampire."
    -   In the Game Within a Game "Yanvania: Senpai of the Night", Dracula-chan, the Big Bad of the game, is a succubus that appears every 100 years to steal the heart of an upperclassman, and who Beldere-chan, the game's main protagonist, has to defeat.

    Visual Novels 

-   In the original English language visual novel _Daemonophilia_, the Loser Protagonist accidentally summons a succubus that can only return to her home if she successfully seduces someone. The catch? She is as much of a loser as a succubus as our protagonist is in everything, so she has a hard time completing that assignment. And if our protagonist just allows her to seduce him? Easy Road to Hell...
-   _Cute Demon Crashers!_ stars a lonely female whose sexual frustrations attracts the attention of a trio of Incubi (and one Succubus). Turns out, they've learned that approaching humans when they're awake and playing nice has far better payouts, so they've taken to helping humans safely explore their sexuality.
-   _Magical Diary_: Logan is widely considered to be the offspring of an incubus. In _Wolf Hall_ he implies that many people have propositioned him due to believing he's one.
-   _Max's Big Bust: A Captain Nekorai Tale_: Max's sister becomes a succubus after sleeping with 1000 different people. Max finds this mildly disturbing.
-   _Monster Prom_: Sawyer is a lust demon, however since they're non-binary, it would be inaccurate to describe them as either an incubus or a succubus. The developers took to describing them as a "fuckubus", but the fandom also uses the term "concubus" instead, which is derived from the Latin _concubina_ meaning 'to lie with'<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> . When encountered in _Monster Road Trip_ the dialogue describes them as a "fuckubus".
-   _Sable's Grimoire_: Incubi and succubi are two names for a single race of demihumans. They are a demonic-looking race of Emotion Eaters who feed on the lust of others and often dress provocatively to bring those feelings out, but despite rumors to the contrary, they don't sleep around, especially not with the people they feed on<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Eris Monte, the Apathetic Teacher of Sable's homeroom class at Amadronia Academy, is the most prominent succubus in the story.

    Webcomics 

-   A pair of these, apparently siblings, show up in _Blip_. They're not just dangerous in bed, but dangerous fighters as well.
-   _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_:
    -   There's two incubi and one succubus among the main cast. Furry ones. Not to mention, a rather prolific race of Cubi, with their own Elaborate University High. This comic being PG, the Cubi (mainly) feed on emotions instead. Though they have a reputation for devouring souls if they want to, which is why the protagonist isn't exactly happy about discovering his heritage (plus, his clan has an affinity for pain and his mother is widely considered to have been a remorseless monster).
    -   The first one to show up fit the classic succubus model pretty well, just Played for Laughs more than the trope usually is. But then it turned out that that particular Cubi just liked lust, and the Cubi's reputation as this trope (among other things) was because of gross sensationalism.
-   _Demonseed Redux_: Rhoda is a villainous succubus who wants Chico's seeds to build an army. In her true form she has Pointy Ears, small horns and goat legs.
-   Cloe of _Eerie Cuties_ is a 14-year-old succubus with freckles and glasses, who thought she was a failure. After a...ahem...growth spurt, she finds herself much more popular with the guys.
-   A succubus character in _Elf Only Inn_ shows up, seducing all the men with her wiles, though she did this mainly as a way to piss off the board's local Soapbox Sadie.
-   _Grrl Power_: Dabbler is a succubus (and alien, cyborg, mage...) who feeds off "tantric energy" acquired through sex. Eventually she explains that succubi are currently a true-breeding (if single-gendered) species of demon, but seem to have originated as sex golems infused with infernal blood that underwent massive feature creep.
    -   It's also stated that the "gender bending cuckoo" thing is actually doppelgangers, one of whom was one of Dabbler's three parents.
-   _The Handbook of Heroes_: As said in the Roll Call for all the cast, the Succubus of the Evil Party, who has Charm Person, which she used on the Wizard, and is red-skinned and has actual horns.
-   Most of the female demons in the webcomic _Krakow_ have jobs as succubi. In a subversion of the typical morality of succubi, most of them aren't that evil, and Case (human) and Kia (succubus) have a happy relationship and eventually got married.
-   _Locus_: the comic is about a half-human half-succubus with special powers inherited from her human father. In it, Succubi are an advanced race which does not, in any way, feed on sex or sexual energy and consider sex with humans bestiality (but they are a common target for rape by humans). The heroine's mother does seduce her father in a typical succubus manner, but it turns out that she's being mind-controlled by an evil wizard trying to produce a half-succubus with a specific power set.
-   _Modern MoGal_: Zoey is a succubus, but since she takes her job as a kindergarten teacher seriously, she appears more normal than you'd expect. Her sister acts much more like a sterotypical succubus, much to Zoey's embarassment.
-   My Pet Succubus is about a horny witch who tries to summon a demon, and gets the most innocent succubus in Hell.
-   _Netherworld Chronicles_: While Adorea is half-succubus, she's not terribly seductive-acting and doesn't seem to care much about sex.
-   Sabine in _The Order of the Stick_. Subverted in that she has a healthy relationship with a human man. (As healthy as things can be in this case, looking over the fact that they're both evil and, well, it's kept healthy by human sacrifices.) It's not monogamous, of course, which is lampshaded in typically hilarious fashion here.
    
    **Sabine:** Nale, sugar, I'm literally an evil incarnation of illicit sex, do I seem like I would get hung up on who you sleep with?
    
-   _Pibgorn_ features Drusilla the succubus as a major character.
-   One storyline of _Sandra and Woo_ has Larisa accept a Devil's Job Offer to become a high ranking succubus upon death in exchange for the devil helping to save her best friend's life. Later events in the story show that this has left her at least partially demoic in nature despite her still being alive, since Zoey's "angelic singing voice" causes her to catch on fire.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_: From strip 2000-11-15, referenced as "Succubus", on an Alliterative List of Religious and Mythological Theme Naming for models of women's power armor:
    
    **Thurl:** Aphrodite, Antigone, Atalanta, Artemis, Athena, Diana, Demeter, Helen, Hesta, Io, Iris, Isis, Juliet, Juno, Lady MacBeth, Medusa, Mnemosyne, Nubia, Nymph, Phoebe, Selene, Succubus, Sylph, Thalia, Uma, Urania, Valkyrie, Venus...
    
-   _Sinfest_:
    -   The two Succubi. They're even in the Devil's personal care, and are probably very fond of each other.
    -   Partially subverted by Fuchsia, the red succubus, who has a schoolgirl crush on Bookworm Criminy.
-   _Succubus Justice_ is the story of a 'failed' succubi sent to a reform school in hell.
-   Subverted in _Wapsi Square_, just as one might expect in a world where the basic shtick is "a paranormal Slice of Life". Several teenage characters are offspring of happy marriages between a human and a succubus or incubus, and two teenage sisters (Briar and Dale Calligari) are full succubi themselves. None are any more evil than your typical teen.
-   Artemis from _White Dark Life_ is the highest-ranking succubus in hell and the wife of Dark Matt after the Timeskip. Unlike most other examples on this list, she prefers to use more chaste methods of life-draining though she is indeed capable of draining life through sex. A fact which terrifies her immortal husband once she starts demanding more children.
-   _Witchprickers_ has Kitty Scratch, an overweight succubus more interested in food than sex.

    Web Animation 

-   _Helluva Boss_: In the episode "Spring Broken", Blitzo runs into his ex, one Verosika Mayday. Verosika and her entire business serve as succubi, which are sex-providing demons. Verosika herself incites lust in people by singing onstage as a popstar.
-   _hololive_: Aloe is a succubus-in-training and has the appropriate pair of horns and tail. Her right horn being shorter than her left one is meant to indicate that she is still not a fully-fledged succubus and it would grow as she matures.

    Web Original 

-   Gaia Online has the namesake of the "Alruna's Rose" item, a voluptuous lilac-skinned succubus. She also comes in Office Lady (OL-runa), Token Mini-Moe (Alrunette), and Spear Counterpart (Anurla) versions. The "Diapered Egg" item also turns into "a fiery spirit of love gone wrong", named Ash. Lastly, demigoddess Sentinel had a strong demonic influence in her appearance during her Halloween 2009 rampage (afterwards she was struck down and rendered mortal, with a more human appearance).
-   _Innkeeper_: Two of Frank's minions are a pair of succubus sisters, posing as attractive barmaids who use their feminine wiles to get close to men to seduce and kill them.
-   In _Looming Gaia_, succubi and incubi are monsters that appear to lonely people offering them sex. If the person agrees, the demon will appear every night demanding more sex, and if the person ever says no, the demon will curse them. They were originally created by the divine Erasmos to be his sex slaves, but they escaped and cursed him with disease.
-   NSFW artist Merunyaa, and NSFW animator Skudbutt, have a mini-series about Meru the Succubus. Merunyaa created Meru to have cute looks and a provocative personality where she attempts to goad men into pinning her down to have their way with her, and Skudbutt did a small animation series about Meru possessing a human girl to use as a vessel to collect sperm and energy to unseal her power and her trapped master.
-   A key point in the _Monster Girl Encyclopedia_: A Succubus ascends to the position of Maou the Demon King, but with no hatred towards Humanity(in fact, she likes them a _lot_), she corrupts an concocts a plan with the Hero that transforms all the Monsters of the world into Succubus-based hybrids and turns their hatred and violence towards Humans into feelings of love/lust and affection.
-   The Onion:
    -   The focus of the article, "Aging Succubus Lowering Standards For Men Ever Since She Turned 40,000":
        
        Local succubus Eisheth Zenunim, Woman of Whoredom and one of the original three Queens of the Demons
        
    -   In "Report: Students Who Take Latin Have Better Chance Of Summoning Demon Later In Life", death by succubus is mentioned as a frequent fate of those who didn't take Latin classes:
        
        However, those who didn’t \[take Latin\] were more prone to lag far behind their peers and often died at the hands of a bloodthirsty, vengeful succubus.”
        
-   SCP Foundation: The old version of SCP-166 was a beautiful woman who drove any man (regardless of sexual orientation) who saw her to a lustful frenzy. However, she was a chaste nun who only wanted a life of religious devotion and celibacy, so the Foundation contained her for her own protection.

    Web Videos 

-   _Shadowland Campaign_: Xellia is a succubus who works with Lord Jadeis, with powers that including the classic succubus ones like mind control, shapeshifting and manipulation. However, it's clear that she's more powerful than your typical succubus. The effects of her kisses don't wear off with time, as Zelas finds out the hard way.

    Western Animation 

-   There was an American _Darkstalkers_ cartoon, and they explicitly kept Morrigan's species. She even drained somebody, although it was just by kissing him.
-   _The Life and Times of Juniper Lee_: In the episode "Take My Life Please", in what may have been an innocent slip, this kid's show implied the existence of this trope when they mentioned a "fifth level incubus", who is summoning a demon from another dimension.
-   Queen Chrysalis from _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, who steals the form of the bride to be of Twilight Sparkle's brother Shining Armor so she can feed off his love for her, draining his energy in the process, and has a rather demonic appearance. She's portrayed as close to a succubus that a G-rated show can get. Apparently, Changelings as a whole are like this, but she's the only one we see actually play the trope straight.
-   A succubus seduces Chef in _South Park_.
-   Callie from the Comedy Central series _Ugly Americans_ is a half-succubus.
