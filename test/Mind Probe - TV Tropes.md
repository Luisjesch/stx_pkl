**Darth Maul:** Now there are some things I need to know. And you’re going to help me.  
**Jesse:** We can go round and round in this circle if you want. I ain’t telling you anything!  
**Darth Maul:** It is not up to you. Your mind will speak. Or it will break!

One of the characters is captured and restrained. If they have information that the Big Bad wants, or if their captors are just feeling a bit sadistic, the bad guys will break out the Mind Probe.

This device may cause a) a lot of fancy flashing lights and electronic effects, b) frightening hallucinations for the captured hero, or c) both. These devices frequently have varying levels of intensity; inevitably, the hero has to suffer the highest one. Confusing and terrifying flashbacks and nightmares are often a long-term result of the Probe, especially if the hero is being made to pay for past transgressions.

While not actually touching the character in any way, when turned on, their subjects will convulse in agony. Sometimes they actually result in usable information. If the character has Telepathy, they can initiate this _without_ the device. A telepath might try to protect themselves with a Psychic Block Defense.

Named for a device in _Doctor Who_, where similar things were used several times.

Compare the more benign Journey to the Center of the Mind. Compare/contrast Mind Rape — different purpose, similar principle.

See also the Mental Picture Projector and Virtual-Reality Interrogation. For a slightly different approach, there's the Agony Beam, which doesn't get into a person's mind directly — it's just a good way to convince a person to tell you what you want to know.

Not to be confused with Mind Screw.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Asteroid in Love_: Played for Laughs. During the Shining Star Challenge, Shiho tells Ao she finds the latter's brain "interesting" for being _both_ Shrinking Violet and Determinator. The latter is suitably disturbed, and has an Imagine Spot of Shiho doing this to her.
-   _Attack No. 1_: There is a small device built to probe each volleyball player's mind to examine their weaknesses.
-   _Ikki Tousen_: A girl named Gakushin (Yue Jin) can use her kiss to dive in the minds and memories of her victims. When she uses this power on a captured Kan'u in _Dragon Destiny_, it does NOT go well; not only Gakushin discovers Kan'u's Les Yay crush on Ryuubi, but also has a bloody vision involving Sousou's past self that almost causes her a Villainous BSoD.
-   _Kaze no Stigma_: Kazuma's Superpowered Evil Side uses magic to pull off mind probes. The process makes his eyes glow and the victim convulse.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_: Verossa Acous reveals his ability to do this when he uses it on the villains' Mission Control at the end of the season.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Parodied. The resident mind-reader Nodoka had to extract information from one of their allies (They were Divided We Fall thanks to the Chess Master villain). It was treated as a highly forceful invasion when it was completely painless, albeit with no ability to defend against, leading Asuna to consider the villainous implications of their actions. Haruna responded by pointing out how the audience always cheers for the villains (which brings up a bit of irony considering the nature of the arc they were in). In fact, this is the entire point of Nodoka's artifact _Diarium Ejus_; by knowing at least the name of the target, she can easily read what that person is thinking.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: Arael's beam of light serves as this, as its primary goal is to understand the nature of human thoughts and emotions... by systematically deconstructing the psyche of its victims, up to and including making its target relive every past trauma it can find, until they're completely incapacitated.
-   _Queen Millennia_: Leopardo abducts Hajime and using a machine learns from his memories that The leader of Millenium Thieves is Yayoi's sister, but he fails to get Yayoi's motives since she hasn't mentioned them yet.
-   _UFO Robo Grendizer vs Great Mazinger_: Barendos kidnaps Kouji Kabuto and uses a mind-probing machine to extract information about Grendizer and the other Earth's giant war mechas — Great Mazinger and _Mazinger Z_ — from him.

    Audio Plays 

-   _Big Finish Doctor Who_:
    -   "Caerdroia" has the Eighth Doctor complaining about all the various Mind Blasters, Mind Erasers, Mind Scrapers, Mind Peelers, etc. he's constantly being threatened with and finds to be a repetitive, mostly-harmless nuisance. The villain of the story uses something called a Mind Blaster, which he stole from his employers, on the Doctor and does not find it to be a profitable exercise as the Doctor very effortlessly outwits him. Turns out the Doctor's mind contains a croquet course, a waterslide, and some bits of old cheese.
        
        "I've lost _count_ of the number of Mind Shredders, Mind Graders, Mind Peelers, Mind Scramblers, Mind Boilers, and all the other types of Mind Devices with cooking program names that have been tried on me. You're not dealing with an amateur here."
        
    -   The Fifth Doctor in another audio drama is similarly unimpressed when threatened with a mind probe, stating he's endured so many he ought to write a field guide on the subject.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Avengers_: Ultron has his Encephalo Ray. Doubles as Mind Rape, because while it can be used painlessly, Ultron prefers to use the more painful settings.
-   _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (Marvel)_: The Brainwave Scanner, the creation of Cobra's original Mad Scientist, Dr. Venom. As described by Venom himself, it performs a thorough scan of the subject's brainwaves, long enough for its computer to generate an "image vocabulary" that would then allow it to display the subject's visual memories on a monitor.
-   _Shakara_: The Hierarchy use a mind probe device to scan Eva Procopio's mind after she tries to avoid their questions too much.
-   _Star Trek: Early Voyages_: In "Flesh of My Flesh", the Ngultor use a mind probe on Captain Pike after capturing him to examine his memories and learn of "the other life-self consumables" on the _Enterprise_.

-   _Supergirl_:
    -   _Red Daughter of Krypton_: Red Lantern Sheko does this telepathically to judge people. If she finds them innocent, she let them go; If she finds them guilty, she burns them down. She tried to read Supergirl's mind, but she got thrown out.
    -   _Supergirl (1972)_: Linda Danvers's roommate Wanda is a telepath. In the first issue, Wanda probes Supergirl's mind telepathically.
    -   _Supergirl (1982)_: In #23, Supergirl fights a mutant with Psychic Powers. During the fight, said mutant attacks her mind telepathically.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In _The Third Kryptonian_, Amalak uses a headdress-resembling mind-probe to try to force Kandor's location out of the Man of Steel.
    -   _The Life Story of Superman_: Lex Luthor plants several mind-reading devices (concealed as projectors and floor plates) around a Superman exhibit to subtly probe Superman's mind and create a copy of his memories as his nemesis gives a tour of the area.

    Fan Works 

-   _Captain Proton and the Planet of Lesbians_: The Brain Probe is used on Constance Goodheart and comes up with a complete blank.
-   _The Chaotic Three_: Quinlan Vos and Yoda are shown using the same mind-reading technique that Kylo Ren used in _The Force Awakens_. It is established that this method is normally used to get information from corpses rather than the living and can be dangerous to use too often, with Rey only coming through it with nothing more than a few hours unconscious because she let both Jedi into her mind willingly as opposed to Poe and Rey fighting Kylo Ren when he did it to them.
-   _Doctor Whooves – The Series_: In _Along Came a Spider_, the Eldritch Abomination du jour uses one on the Doctor, who isn't even impressed a little bit.
-   _Hellsister Trilogy_: In the second arc, Desaad uses one mind-scanning contraption to torture information out of Pariah.
    
    _That had led Desaad down the right track. For tortures of the mind can be even worse than tortures of the body, and Apokolips has mind-probers aplenty._
    
-   _Mega Man Defenderof The Human Race_: Bass has his brain hijacked by the Stardroids, giving them access to his memories and knowledge of Earth so they can prepare for the invasion. Even scarier is that they did so through his power source, and someone who wasn't the Stardroids actually possessed him briefly.
-   _Red Fire, Red Planet_: Prior to the story, Brokosh acquired entry codes to the Sol system by ripping them straight out of the mind of a Starfleet captain with his telepathy.
-   _Thousand Shinji_: The main character constantly probes other people's minds to find out things about them, figure out their intentions or extract information. Being a telepath, he doesn't need a machine.
-   _Visiontale_: Most frequently Performed by Pauline via telepathy, usually to check monsters' stats, but every character can do it.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Avatar: The Way of Water_: After Spider is captured by the Recombinant Quaritch and brought back to Bridgehead City, General Ardmore puts him in some kind of high-tech interrogation machine to find out any information about Jake and his family's whereabouts. The thing scans his brain, rendering the scanning on a holographic display while flashing all sorts of imagesbefore his eyes in a rotating apparatus, and it's visibly painful and causes his nose to bleed (it probably would have killed him had Recombinant Quaritch not stopped the process).
-   _The Chronicles of Riddick_: When the Greater Order of the Quasi-Dead probe Riddick's mind to learn more about him.
-   _DC Extended Universe_:
    -   _Man of Steel_: Lois mentions that Zod and his followers used one on her off-screen. Superman says he was subjected to it as well. In his case this leads to a hallucination where Zod shows him his plans for Earth, and he sinks into a field of human skulls.
    -   _Zack Snyder's Justice League_: Steppenwolf uses a small spider-like robot that seeks useful informations in the mind of its victim and holographically displays them. Cyborg destroys it during the battle in the tunnels.
-   _Earth vs. the Flying Saucers_. The aliens demonstrate their power on a captured general, using a beam that exposes his brain as they make him reveal various military secrets.
-   _Flash Gordon (1980)_: "We're going to empty your memory as we might empty your pockets... Doctor." Dr. Hans Zarkov is subjected to the effects of some sort of twisted alien gizmo<small>◊</small> that's supposed to erase his mind; he must struggle valiantly to keep his memories intact.
-   _Inception_ is based on this. It is about a group of people who, using a special device, enter someone else's dreams, normally to extract key information.
-   _The Matrix_: When Agent Smith and the other agents have captured Morpheus, they have him restrained in a chair undergoing some kind of interrogation involving electrodes on his scalp and what looks like an injection of some kind. Another character notes they're "breaking into his mind—it's like hacking into a computer".
-   _Mom and Dad Save the World_: Tod uses one on Dick to figure out what it is that makes Marge love him. The device apparently reads surface thoughts, as the first thing that comes up on the machine is "My back hurts."
-   _Planet of the Apes_: Used twice in the original film series.
    -   _Beneath the Planet of the Apes_: The mutants can to do this with their Psychic Powers, and it is as painful as usual for the trope.
    -   _Conquest of the Planet of the Apes_: A mechanical version called the Authenticator appears, although there's apparently no pain involved.
-   _The President's Analyst_ starts to crack under the pressure of his job, imagining spies are out to get him (and they are). He anxiously rants about "Dr. Chin Hu and his electrodynamic process of thought reform." He's ultimately abducted by The Phone Company, whose mind probe technology is way more sophisticated and dangerous than Hu's.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   _Rogue One: A Star Wars Story_: Bor Gullet serves as an organic and excruciatingly painful mind probe.
    -   _Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope_: Darth Vader, totally unaware that he's presiding over the torture of his own daughter, waves a floating black orb covered in syringes and vicious-looking doo-dads into Leia's cell aboard the Death Star. Interestingly, the novelization and radio drama adaptation have him dismiss the machine once they are alone and attack her mentally with The Dark Side.
    -   _Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens_:
        -   Kylo Ren uses the Force to mind-probe Poe Dameron, forcibly taking the information the First Order was unable to get from him through torture.
        -   Later in the film, Kylo tries the same on Rey. This backfires on him since this awakens Rey's own latent Force potential and she turns the probe back on him. He leaves the interrogation room badly shaken, giving Rey the opportunity to use her newfound Force abilities to free herself via employing a Jedi Mind Trick on a Stormtrooper.
    -   _Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi_: Unlike the above, Rey's mind is easily probed by Snoke, who discovers Luke Skywalker's intentions with the desire to do it himself. He also claims to know every move of Kylo Ren and knows that Ren will kill his true enemy. Snoke, however did not foresee _who Ren's true enemy was_

    Literature 

-   H. Beam Piper's future history usually used the polyencephalographic veridicator, an apparently unbeatable Lie Detector, but in _The Cosmic Computer_ it turns out The Federation also had a mind probe (restricted to military/intelligence use):
    
    "We'll get anything we want out of you," Conn told him. "You know what a mind-probe is? You should; your accomplices used one on my father's secretary. She's a hopeless imbecile now. You'll be, too, when we're through with you. But before then, you'll have given us everything you know."  
    Kelton began to protest. "Conn, you can't do a thing like that!"  
    "A mind-probe is utterly illegal; why, it's a capital offense!" Ledue exclaimed. "Conn I forbid you..."  
    "Judge, don't make me call those guards and have you removed," Conn said.
    
-   Isaac Asimov:
    -   "The Dying Night": Dr Asimov's Psychic Probe is a technology that can extract information from people's unconscious memories. It's used as a threat because people who are subjected to the Probe often suffer permanent damage. The detective who fingers the culprit points out that this damage is due to mishandling or from resisting it.
    -   _Lucky Starr and the Oceans of Venus_: In their efforts to figure out why people are blacking out, some of the victims are subjected to a psychic probe, but to no avail.
    -   The Psychic Probe in Isaac Asimov's _Robots-Empire-Foundation_ novels is very complicated. Because the series were originally independent from one another, there are multiple descriptions of what, _exactly_ the probe does; in some cases it directly reads the subjects mind, whereas in others it provides information in the abstract that has to be interpreted by a psychologist. Universal across its portrayals, however, is the warning that it causes severe memory loss and brain damage if used improperly, although in skilled hands it does no worse than cause a few days of weakness. The one time a Psychic Probe does appear in actual usage (_The Currents Of Space_), it is used to remove a surface emotion, except that, by mistake, it removed a similar, much deeper feeling — and everything in between, reducing the subject to an infantile state that could neither read, write, speak or even feed or clean himself. One of the main characters (a rich noble) has a secretary who has been probed into complete loyalty, while another is rumored to use such people for certain other purposes. "The General (Foundation)" showed that a probe could be blocked by technological interference, although the (technologically illiterate) users thought that the lack of results was because the subject had been isolated for so long that his brainwaves were too alien for the probe to understand. After the failure to probe Lathan Devers, the Emperor's Privy Secretary used his own "psychic probe" to get information from Devers: He offered him $100,000.
-   _Literature Catseye 1961_: Zul argues that killing the animals will be a mercy, since they will be subjected to this and then killed if the Patrol gets them.
-   _City of Bones (1995)_ by Martha Wells: The Inhabitants can torturously invade human minds for information, to generally incapacitating effect. Krismen like Khat were bio-engineered with an innate Psychic Block Defense.
-   In The '80s pulp series _Doomsday Warrior_, the Freefighters in the Invaded States of America have hypnotic blocks that prevent them revealing their bases under torture, but the KGB develops a 'mindbreaker' that can overcome this conditioning. When the hero uses a captured mindbreaker to interrogate a Soviet officer, he's so horrified at the result he forbids its use for any future interrogations.
-   _Dune_ has Ixian Probes in the old Imperium and the more intense T-Probe from the scattering as a major concern for the protagonists in _Heretics_ and _Chapterhouse: Dune_
-   _Fingerprints_: Rae can use her Psychic Powers to mind-probe people by pressing her fingertips against theirs. The person on the receiving end only feels a slight tingle.
-   _Hammer's Slammers_: Partially subverted, particularly in the story _Interrogation Team_. There, the mind probe is semi-painless and takes the form of a directed hallucination. BOTH the interrogator and the person being interrogated are given the drug, and a second interrogator asks questions while the first, in rapport with the victim, experiences his/her memories as the questions are asked. The drug in question is a combination truth serum and hallucinogen, and is described by the first interrogator as akin to a drug high. In this particular story, the interrogat-ee comes from a heavily defended town, a "red-pill target" - and when the authorization to nuke the town is given, the interrogator shares one last vision with the interrogated person - as he envisions his baby girl's eyeballs melted by the nuclear blast. Both the interrogator and the interrogated individual were disconnected from the machine when it happened. David Drake does not write _nice_ stories — perhaps because he WAS an interrogator assigned to the 11th Cavalry during The Vietnam War.
-   _Harry Potter_: Legilimency, particularly as portrayed in the movies.
    -   It's actually portrayed a bit worse in the books, though you don't get to see it. Voldemort essentially destroys the mind of Bertha Jorkins through Legilimency (possibly combined with the Cruciatus curse) who had had a Memory Charm placed on her, shattering her mind in the process. Then he kills her, because she has no mind anymore and thus is now worthless.
    -   But it can also be used in a way similar to the use of veritaserum, as a much less painful and more reliable alternative to torture.
    -   To give you an idea of how good at Occlumency Snape was: unlike Harry, who eventually found the power to block Voldemort outright with emotions Voldemort couldn't handle, Snape was not only able to block Voldemort with Occlumency but do it in such a way that Voldemort didn't even know he was being blocked. And he kept that up for seventeen years.
-   _The Machineries of Empire_: The High Calendar gives the Rahal faction the power to "scry" people's minds for information, although they have to interpret symbolic "signifiers" rather than read their thoughts directly. Unfortunately, it traps the target in agonizing hallucinations as a side effect.
-   _The Norby Chronicles_, by Isaac Asimov and Janet Asimov:
    -   _Norby's Other Secret_: The prison that Mentor First sticks Jeff in is designed to telepathically extract information, and can be used to torture, but is also used by First when he has bouts of dementia to prevent him from hurting people. It can keep people/robots paralyzed until the computer is ordered to release them.
    -   _Norby Finds a Villain_: Ing's "magic box" actually had a mind probe inside, which he used to learn how to control the prototype hyperspace ship on his own.
-   _Ordeal in Otherwhere_: Thorvald, discussing Lantee's capture, tells Charis that he's not been mind-locked, and the Company men may use this on him. In fact, he put himself into a mental prison that at least kept them from using it.
-   _An Outcast in Another World_: A Mind Mage is used to threaten a prisoner who refuses to give up vital information about the location and capabilities of the main character. While the mind probe isn't actually carried out, the fact that refusing to spill the beans will only result in the Mind Mage extracting the information anyway — using methods that may result in brain damage — causes the prisoner to fess up.
-   _Rod Allbright Alien Adventures_ has a benign version: Rod allows several members of the Mentat to read his mind with their Psychic Powers because they have a common goal and vastly more expertise to understand things he's seen. When the Ting Wongovia does the probe, Rod gets snatches of Ghost Memory from them; when senior Mentat members do one, Rod doesn't even notice that they did it in a second as soon as he agreed.
-   The _Skylark Series_ by E.E. "Doc" Smith features a mind-reading machine which ranges in effectiveness from the consensual, mutual sharing of knowledge (the Educator) right up to ripping information out of the most unwilling subject. It even works on the dead, if the brain is fresh enough and undamaged. When Dick Seaton is done scouring the mind of a hostile and uncooperative alien for vital information concerning an impending attack on Earth, Seaton finds to his dismay that he's killed it.
-   In _The Star Kings_ duology by Edmond Hamilton, the protagonist is captured by a villain, who tries to extract a valuable secret from him with a Mind Probe. According to the villain, a few hours would have left him a mindless husk, but since the first minute showed the subject is not the man they're looking for, he got away with just a _very_ severe headache.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: Darth Vader can do this to people casually, probing their minds long enough to know if they're up to something.
    -   _Death Star_: A character senses Vader's attention and it freaks her out, so she instinctively shuts him out by concentrating on the image of a blast door closing and sealing. He decides that she's strong-minded, and, although that interests him, ultimately he does nothing, because he managed to remind himself of Padmé.
    -   _Splinter of the Mind's Eye_: Leia has a BSOD when faced with another round with a Mind Probe, meaning she almost loses it off-screen. One of the things that Vader does is make her believe that her father needs that information — then, that she's burning alive and will die if she doesn't tell him.
-   _Thousand Sons_: In _Ahriman: Sorcerer_, Ahriman starts telepathically probing the mind of the captive Inquisitor Iobel for the location of the Athenaeum of Kallimakus. Or at least, that’s what she _assumes_ is happening. In reality, Ahriman has pulled her mind into his own in a hostile Mental Fusion so that he can directly sift through her memories. Once she realizes this, a Battle in the Center of the Mind ensues as she starts to fight back with her own psychic powers.
-   _Tunnels_ has the Dark Light, a device used by the Styx for interrogation. It also has a Mind Rape setting which is much less frequently used, as it leaves victims in no condition to answer their questions.
-   _Veniss Underground_: There are professionals called Psychewitches who can use machines to extract memories from people in stasis and show them to others. Unusually for a mind probe, the process is actually more dangerous to the mind of the person receiving the memories than the mind of the person being probed.
-   _Wyrm_: Done twice by Wyrm. Both times it has an effect like Mind Rape — the first time, Wyrm wasn't expecting it to be so traumatizing; the second time, Wyrm intentionally made it is traumatizing as possible.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Variation on _Angel_, where the mind probe was a burrowing demon that Wolfram and Hart let into Lorne's head to steal the information he had from reading Cordy.
-   Done without technology in _Babylon 5_ - telepaths simply rip the information from their captive's minds, evidently causing a great deal of pain and a high probability of permanent damage.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Space Museum" and "Frontier in Space" both feature mind probes, and the Doctor doesn't seem too worried about them: in the latter serial he even claims to have once blown one up because he simply told it the truth (he was going to meet a pink elephant, a giant rabbit, and a purple horse with yellow spots), and the device had been unable to accept it. This is Not Hyperbole when the Doctor is then interrogated and—sure enough—blows up the mind probe because it refuses to believe he's telling the truth. Later they capture one of the notoriously simple-minded Ogrons, and the Doctor says it's a waste of time as he has the best defense of all—stupidity. "He doesn't have a mind to probe."
    -   This is contradicted by the "No! Not the mind probe!" reaction of Castellan in "The Five Doctors". However it's likely the Time Lords have more sophisticated probes for their more advanced minds. When the Gallifreyan Mind Probe is used on Cinder in _Engines of War_ it proves incredibly painful—apparently it could kill a human.
    -   Poor Adric in "Castrovalva". So many companions before him have been captured and tortured by Big Bads, but he may be the only one to spend _an entire story_ strung up while the Master probes his brain. Even if the kid's ramblings in other stories break your ears, his desperate pleadings of "NO! PLEASE! DON'T MAKE ME DO IT!" when the Master uses the forcibly extracted computations to try and kill the Doctor will break your heart.
    -   In "Doomsday", the Daleks reveal their own form of the "mind probe": their suckers can extract brainwaves from other species. Daleks being Daleks, this cooks the subject's entire head to a crisp.
-   The Aurora chair used by Scorpius in _Farscape_, as well as methods (that can cause hallucinations) used by the Scarrans. (One might also count the neural chip Scorpius put in John Crichton's head as another, alternate method.)
-   On _Heroes_, Parkman's mind-reading powers eventually evolve to this degree. He uses the Mind Probe in the Dark Future, whereas Present-Day Parkman finds it simpler to just command people to tell him the truth, seeing as how he's also developed mind control powers.

-   Sticking fingers into a person's head is the favored method of Brainiac on _Smallville_, not surprising since this nanotech version of the character was clearly inspired by SG-1's human replicators.
-   The human Replicators in _Stargate SG-1_ (and the Asurans in _Stargate Atlantis_) put their fingers in your brain, extract the necessary information through causing dreamlike delusions, and take them out. This really, really hurts.
    -   Interestingly, whether or not the method works depends on the mental prowess of the victim. In one episode, after Doctor Weir is brought back to life with Replicator nanites, the team infiltrates the Replicator city to steal a ZPM. Weir is captured and subjected to mind probe showing terrible things happening to the rest of the team until - surprise! - it's revealed that _she's_ the one inducing delusions in the Replicators, and the team is actually making its escape from the city completely unhindered. Then stuff blows up.
    -   Also popping up in _SG-1_ was a frightening spiky ball thing that Anubis implanted in Thor's brain to literally download his knowledge into the ship's computer. It later turned out to be a good thing - when the original Thor was comatose and essentially a vegetable, SG-1 was able to pull Thor's consciousness out of the computer so it could be downloaded into a new cloned body.
-   _Star Trek_ has had a number of these, most notably the Klingons' mindsifter and a corrupted "therapeutic" device for the mentally ill. By _The Next Generation_ the Romulans are well known for theirs (simply called Mind Probes).
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: In the chilling episode "Frame of Mind", Riker finds himself shifting between two realities, one where he's a starship officer acting out a play about a man locked up in a mental asylum, and another where he's a man locked up in a mental asylum who imagines being a starship officer. He eventually concludes that _both_ realities are a Lotus-Eater Machine as he wakes up in a laboratory where the aliens who captured him are trying to probe his mind for information. Riker's mind was trying to resist the probe and created the dream (from recent memories of the play) and he experienced that struggle as a dream that pulled from his recent memories and feelings from acting in the play and identifying with his character's struggle.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Homaged in "Thirty Days" when the Delaney sisters, playing the "Twin Mistresses of Evil" in a hammy scifi holodrama, have the hero's sidekick (played by Ensign Harry Kim) chained up so they can use the terrible Brain Probe, which they promise will turn him into their groveling slave ("By the time we've finished, you'll be _begging_ to tell us everything you know!"). Harry does not seem particularly averse to the idea.
-   In the _Torchwood_ episode "Sleeper", the team use a mind probe on unwitting sleeper agent Beth, causing her to reveal her alien nature, the implant in her arm, and to tell her "name, rank and serial number" whenever asked a question. It's a very painful process (making for rather uncomfortable viewing).
-   In the _V: The Final Battle_ miniseries, one of the heroes gets caught and put into a "Conversion Chamber" which pumps terrifying hallucinations into her mind with the purpose of brainwashing her. She nearly dies during the process, and is rescued before it can be completed. However, she notices some lingering after-effects (notably, her switch from using one hand to the other.) She's also highly susceptible to manipulation by the Big Bad, who takes advantage of this fact to engineer an escape after being captured by the heroes. The trope is somewhat subverted with Diana noting that humans are proving resistant to the Conversion process, which makes it impractically slow to use beyond vital individuals they need under their control. When simple interrogation is called for, Diana is more than happy to use older methods like torture to get the job done.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _Dungeons & Dragons_ supplement _Lords of Madness_ explains that in the rare cases a prisoner is immune to an Illithid's psychic questioning, the Mind Flayers can make use of a device called a "thought extruder." Once the Illithids use their tentacles' natural enzymes to make a fist-sized hole in the subject's skull, they stick the device's needles into the prisoner's brain to more directly read the subject's mind. It takes a minute to get an answer to a question asked in this manner, but the answer is always truthful, and unless the victim makes a successful Fortitude save, their Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma are all permanently diminished with each question... and once the interrogation is complete, they have to make a Wisdom save to avoid going insane from the experience. So, not much fun for the interviewee.
-   _Escape Tales Low Memory_ reveals this during chapter 3 where the victim and suspect are being examined to determine what happened. The objective of the chapter is to manipulate the input data.
-   _GURPS_ actually calls this Mind Probe.
-   Some _Magic: The Gathering_ cards seem to be based on this trope. Examples: Psychogenic Probe, Psychic Possession, Mind Extraction.
-   So does _Paranoia_, as a mutant ability instead of a device. It's not particularly subtle, causing unconsciousness.
-   In _Rocket Age_ the Europans have access to the Neural Linkage System, a device that replaces two of their fingers, and allows them to either link into Europan and Ancient Martian devices or forcibly create a psychic connection with someone.

    Video Games 

-   The first _Ape Escape_ game, despite its generally light-hearted and humorous nature throughout, features this just before the Final Boss fight. Specter, using his telekinetic powers, bombards Spike with plasma, goading him to become his Brainwashed servant, or experience greater pain. It's implied that this was the very method used to brainwash Spike's friend Jake. Fortunately, Spike has the Heroic Willpower to resist it.
-   In _Betrayal at Krondor_, Gorath is a dark elf who seeks out the humans to convince them to nip the war his kind is planning against them in the bud, because he knows his people can't risk the losses. After being escorted to someone in authority - Prince Arutha, Lord of the West - he is subjected to this to find out if he's being sincere. Which doesn't really work, as he apparently has subconscious defences, so the jury remains out on him for the rest of the game.
-   _Halo_: The Flood gain access to a host's memories when they infect a person, and they have a hive-mind. Therefore, when Captain Keyes is infected in _Halo: Combat Evolved_, he has to make a superhuman effort to keep the parasite from learning information integral to the survival of the good guys until the Master Chief shows up to put him out of his misery.
-   The Ethelite of the Eltham family in Nasuverse (specifically, _Melty Blood_) is a mind-probe/control combination - because of how small and thin it is (a nano-filament) targets generally have no idea that information is being sucked out of them. Canonically, the reason why everyone hates them.
-   _X-COM: UFO Defense_ features Mind Probes, which tell you the rank/stats of enemy aliens.
    -   Those are just the non-attack version. Psi-Amps and training allow humans to attack aliens mentally. Aliens are under no such restrictions: they can attack without special devices and have a rape old time.
    -   _XCOM: Enemy Unknown_ features something similar devised by Dr Vahlen for overcoming the language barrier, which seems to be some sort of souped-up MRI scanner... and invariably ends up _killing_ whatever alien they subject to it. Descriptions of the process imply painful, invasive brain surgery.
-   Albedo combines this with Mind Rape in _Xenosaga's_ first Episode. It's more obvious in the (supposedly censored) U/C version (where it actually has all those flashy lights), but even in the JP version, the goal was to find the Y-Data in MOMO (supposedly the last complete copy). He added the Mind Rape for an apparent trap later on.

    Webcomics 

-   _Avania_: Agent Valenvarius Narscio uses his magical abilities to obtain information from the memories of a stupefied Major Beckinridge.
-   _Captain SNES: The Game Masta_:
    -   Alex's captor has been doing this to him for pretty much the entire comic.
    -   Eggplant goes into Samus' mind to force some information out of her. She breaks him instead. Merely by _staring_ at him.
        
        **Samus:** When trying to extract information using mental effects... make sure you have the stronger will.
        
-   In _Captain Ufo_, Dr. Marcuus invented one of these some times before the beginning of the series, which gets her in trouble with the law untill Celeste "recruits" her and her machine.
-   _Elf Blood_ has TKO attempt a remote Mind Probe on Mara's father. He turns out to be an incredibly power mage, and is not too pleased at being spied on...
-   Averted in _Errant Story_, as Sarine offers to submit to one to prove she isn't concealing anything about what her fellow elves were up to. The circumstances suggest that it's an unpleasant proposition. Fortunately, the Tsuirakuans don't take her up on it.
-   Any, The Empath from _M9 Girls!_, can read the most prevalent emotion of a person, and can force her way into the most deep emotions. Strong wills can block Any's attempts at emotion reading.
-   Redcloak mentions using them on his prisoner O'Chul in _The Order of the Stick_. When it doesn't work, he just convinces himself O'Chul must have some special resistance.
-   _Questionable Content_ has a benign version: The powerful AI "Spookybot" reluctantly enters Bubbles' mind in an attempt to recover memories that Bubbles had lost. Although it isn't harmful or even uncomfortable to the probed AI, Spookybot has ethical objections to intrude on someone's mind and considers it "just _gross_" to know someone so intimately.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_ has mindripping, which is mostly left offscreen, but culminates in a complete cellular disassembly of the subject's brain to tease out every last bit of data.
-   _Trying Human_: EBE1 subjects Hue to one when he finds out he is disobeying him. The latter is not happy about it.

    Web Original 

-   In _Arcana Magi_, the Therapy Room commits Brainwashing, Mind Rape, and other various types of mental anguish on its victims.
-   _Raising Angels_, Telepaths, Empaths, and other assorted mind readers reside in Mind Hall on campus where the walls are treated with a special coating to insure that everyone get to keep their thoughts for themselves.

    Western Animation 

-   Ultron from _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_ has an AI patterned after the human brain. When he decides to eliminate chaos by eliminating everyone in the world, he confronts SHIELD's acting director, Maria Hill, and steals some nuclear missile codes from her brain.
-   In _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_, Buzz's blueskinned second in command, Mira Nova, has the ability (like all her race) to rummage through memories by literally sticking a hand in the person's brain. This is a side-effect of phasing powers, so all is good.
-   In the _DuckTales (1987)_ episode "Where No Duck Has Gone Before", the aliens "strip the data \[about how to get to Earth\]" from Launchpad's mind.
-   _Exo Squad_: In Season 1's final arc, Phaeton subjects Commander Marsh to a potentially-fatal mind probe to determine if Marsala's sudden defection to the Neosapien Republic is legitimate or not. It's not, but Marsala never told Able Squad about his plan because he knew Phaeton would mind probe his squadmates, so Marsala successfully fools Phaeton until he can attempt to capture him.
-   Subverted in _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_, when Mentok tries to Mind Probe Ernie Devlin and can't because of a metal plate in the daredevil's head. He's also thwarted by cops wearing aluminum foil hats at one point.
-   A very literal example in _Invader Zim_: these seem to be fairly commonly used by the Irken Empire as screw-like probes jammed into victim's heads.
    -   In the episode "Zim Eats Waffles", Zim has a human test subject with a large happiness probe stuck in his head.
    -   The megadoomer episode also showed the enslaved workers on a conquered world turned into package shipping planet to all have these.
-   Some form of this is used on the Question in the _Justice League Unlimited_ episode "Question Authority". It causes him to hallucinate about an alternate Bad Future. Question's only response (apparently even after a week of being tortured) is to repeat random theories.
-   In the _Kim Possible_ movie 'So the Drama', Doctor Drakken uses a mind probe to take the plans for the Hephaestus Project from Mr. Dr. Possible's mind and use them to make his Lil' Diablo toys. He also tried (and failed) to use lesser mind probing devices on one Dr. Freeman in the episode 'Car Trouble'.
-   Parodied in various _Looney Tunes_ cartoons, usually with Bugs Bunny outwitting the Evil Scientist trying to swap Bugs' brain with whatever happened to be at hand.
-   In _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_, the Triceraton invaders use this on Donatello to try and find out where the scientist they're pursuing has gone. But Splinter provides him with psychic assistance, and Don resists the probe.
-   _Transformers_ occasionally uses this:
    -   Soundwave's toy bio states that he is "Able to read minds by monitoring electrical brain impulses." This ability is only used a couple of times in the first season of _The Transformers_.
    -   In a second-season episode of the original cartoon, Megatron tried to use the Psycho-Probe on an heiress to discover her father's energy formula; her Walking Techbane nature protected her, however. Amusingly, it was Soundwave himself who operated the device, foregoing (or forgetting about) his own mind-reading ability.
    -   In _Transformers: Robots in Disguise_, the Predacons repeatedly mind-probe a kidnapped human scientist; sometimes this yielded useful information for them and sometimes... not. Despite claims of the probe's dangerous nature, he seems to survive the experience pretty well. (In an awesome bit of homage, it's described in the exact terms as the G1 version, to the point that the TF Wiki puts both versions on one page.)
    -   _Transformers: Prime_ brings the Cortical Psychic Patch, allowing one character to enter another's mind. It's been used multiple times in the series for various reasons (usually Mind Rape).
