_"We are currently cruising at 30,000 feet. The terminal velocity of a human being is 250 feet per second. This means you have approximately two minutes to think about why you should not steal diamonds that belong to the Fuhrer."_

A method of murder commonly associated with extrajudicial killings perpetrated by authoritarian and totalitarian regimes, a death flight involves someone being dropped from an airborne vehicle high in the air, often into remote wilderness areas or large bodies of water. The benefits of this method of killing are obvious: it combines murder and body disposal in one fell swoop. The bodies are often not discovered before the elements, wildlife and decomposition can make work of them, and even if they are, it's not always easy to determine who killed them — or if they were even murdered in the first place. The identity of the victim and even the time of death can also be obfuscated given the right circumstances. Not only that, but the purpose of these flights is generally not immediately obvious to those not in the know (unless they happen to witness people falling out, of course). There are still risks and drawbacks, however, such as (usually) having to log a flight plan, the possibility of interception _en route_, or even sufficiently resourceful prisoners managing to turn the tables on their captors and send _them_ plummeting to their deaths.

Many fictional uses of this trope take inspiration from the infamous use of this method of murder by the far-right military dictatorships that ruled the Southern Cone countries of South America during The '70s and The '80s to "disappear" those who spoke out against their policies or were otherwise politically inconvenient.

One variant is the use of deception rather than force, tricking someone into boarding an aircraft and then throwing them off at the right opportunity. In more fantastic settings, characters able to fly under their own power may do this without a vehicle. Another popular variation is _threatening_ to do this as a form of High-Altitude Interrogation. Yet another involves jumping (often super-jumping) or teleportation rather than flight.

A subtrope of Disney Villain Death. Compare Destination Defenestration and Thrown Out the Airlock. When someone is murdered _on_ a plane, see Death in the Clouds. May overlap with Unhand Them, Villain!. See also Chute Sabotage. Contrast Death from Above. Not to be confused with Thrown from the Zeppelin, though there can certainly be overlap.

    Literature 

-   _The Amtrak Wars_ novel "Iron Master" by Patrick Tilley. Steve Brickman is ordered by the Shogun to dispose of a treasonous official using this method, using the primitive aircraft being developed for the Iron Masters. His plan is to get him to take a joyflight with sabotaged safety harness, then do a sudden roll to dump him out of the passenger cockpit (which he demonstrates for the Shogun's herald, to his dismay—he's properly strapped in, of course). Turns out someone else will be flying the plane, so Steve just sets a bomb to disintegrate the aircraft in mid-air.
-   In _Blonde Genius_ by J.T. Edson, Gus Saunders is ejected from a plane without a parachute while over the English Channel in a case of You Have Outlived Your Usefulness.
-   _Captain Underpants_: Subverted in "Captain Underpants and the Preposterous Plight of the Purple Potty People". George and Harold's evil counterparts hypnotize Sulu and Crackers into trying to kill George and Harold, so Crackers flies into the sky with both boys. Harold assumes that "he" is planning on dropping them, but George points out that "he" is taking them to safety. This is subtle foreshadowing that Crackers is actually female, as it was previously established that women always do the opposite of what they're told if the 3D Hypno Ring is used on them.
-   _Dragon Jousters_: A standard military tactic used by the Jousters consists of swooping down onto an opposing force, having your dragon grab an officer, fly up, then let go. Ari has a Heroic BSoD after some other Jousters decide to use this tactic on a group of civilians as a game.
-   In the third _Guardians of the Flame_ book _The Silver Crown_, the protagonists capture some mercenary assassins sent to kill them, though not before a family of innocent civilians under their protection had been killed.

Before going to fight it, Touya rides on his flying base directly above where the monster is located. Then later, he activates the Gate spell, which can be used to travel to any location he's been to before. The Gate opens up exactly where Touya was while flying earlier, and the monster plummets thousands of feet and shatters to its demise on impact.
-   In the Modesty Blaise novel _The Impossible Virgin_, Modesty and Willie are captured by the villain and loaded onto a private plane to be flown to the villain's base. Mid-flight, over mountainous wilderness, the villain has Willie thrown out, still strapped to a chair. By a great stroke of luck, Willie lands on something soft and survives.
-   The eagle hunting method is referenced in _Small Gods_ when an eagle picks up and drops a tortoise that turns out to be the Amnesiac God Om trapped in the form of a tortoise from lack of faith.

-   _Return of Ultraman_: A recurring tactic for Ultraman Jack to finish off his kaiju opponents is the Ultra Lifter, a move which might have inspired the Seismic Toss from _Pokemon_, but in this case the outcomes are fatal. The move consist of Jack grabbing his enemies, flying into the air, and either dropping or throwing them from great height, which he uses to great effect against Giant Flyer Terochilus (Jack have to spin in circles while grabbing the monster's legs, to disorientate Terochilus long enough and prevent it from flying), Meteorite Monster Zagoras (which Jack lifts into the air and sends it crashing headfirst into its own meteorite, resulting in a fiery explosion that destroys both) and Arc Villain Alien Nackle (who gets lifted hundreds of meters into the stratosphere and flung over Jack's shoulders — Nackle lands _on his head_).
-   In _WKRP in Cincinnati_ DJ Venus Flytrap revealed that he was a deserter from the Army during the Vietnam War. His real name was Gordon Simms, and he'd been living under an alias and keeping a low profile for years. When his friends at the station convinced him to go to the Army and come clean instead of staying on the run, he did so. During an interview with the Army investigator, he revealed one of the reasons he deserted was he was on a helicopter and two South Vietnamese officers were interrogating a North Vietnamese prisoner. The interrogation ended when the two officers threw the North Vietnamese prisoner out of the helicopter. Venus's friend was sitting next to him, and when he saw that, his friend simply smiled, stood up, shouldered his weapon, and marched out the helicopter door. As Venus noted, "We were at about 2000 feet." The Army investigator doing the research concluded that since Venus simply deserted when he had already been shipped home after his tour was up, and he was within a few days of being discharged anyway, the Army wouldn't pursue the matter and would simply issue him a general discharge.

Then, it flies up to a sufficient height and drops them to their death via fall damage (it can also sometimes kill by dropping them in an Acid Pool, into a Bottomless Pit, or into the path of another dinosaur). In order to escape, another human has to shoot the _Pteranodon_ before it reaches a fatal height.

-   By the late 1970s, the military of Apartheid South Africa was making use of death flights to kill political activists and guerilla fighters, with the apartheid government going as far as to create a special branch of the South African Defense Force, the Delta 40, for this very purpose. Hundreds of rebels and dissidents were thrown off aircraft into the Atlantic Ocean off the Namibian coast during the height of the South African Border War.
