_"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."_

Love is a funny thing. Sometimes, we feel the strong need to keep our love secret from the object of our affection, for various reasons. They could still be attached, they may consider us a "best friend" and we don't want to endanger it, or maybe we just haven't come to terms with our feelings. The attempts that we have already made were all suddenly interrupted. The fear of rejection is also a powerful deterrent to spilling your heart out.

Thank God there are extraneous factors that force us to shout our love to the heavens after we've been pushed around. Otherwise, how would romance work?

Anguished Declarations of Love are gender-neutral in terms of occurrence but have a different flavour depending on whether the declarer is male or female: a male declarer will often be aggressive and reproachful in his confession, especially if his target of affection doesn't react the way he expects them to, in which case he may demand to be loved back. If the answer is positive, Manly Tears of Joy are never far. He's also more likely to deliver the declaration in a Balcony Wooing Scene. A female declarer is often much more subdued in her confession and will admit her feelings sheepishly but a lash out isn't unheard of. Expect said lashing out to be rather teary, even heart-wrenching if done well.

These kinds of confessions and proposals have a low success rate. When they come halfway through a work, they must usually be repeated again at the climax so that they can be accepted.

Be warned: deathbed confessions of undying love all too often turn out not to be actual deathbeds. There is a very real possibility you will live to face the consequences of your confession. This may be a Good Thing or a Bad Thing.

In real life, it's probably a much better move to just, y'know, ask someone on a date and see where it goes from there.

Sub-Trope of Love Confession. Compare Dying Declaration of Love, Now or Never Kiss, and Aborted Declaration of Love.

-   In "Chanson d'Ami" (Friend Song) sung by Zazie, the singer talks about how her relationship with one of her friends is purely platonic. Throughout most of the song, Zazie keeps telling her friend that this song isn't about her love for him, only about their friendship, with the chorus being (translated from French): "It's only a friend song; Friend, not love; It's only a friend song; I promise, not love; I don't love you; I like you." …until her friend meets another girl. The singer is obviously heartbroken but keeps denying her feelings for him. However, her real feelings become apparent in the last repeat of the chorus, when the following altered lines are sung: "It's only a song, I promise, _my love_". The song ends with them cutting off all ties with each other.
-   The opening verse of Poets of the Fall's Obsession Song "Carnival of Rust," implies that the speaker has been unhealthily fixating on the object of their affection for so long they've been losing sleep, while the lyrics pivot from a passive, Wishful Projection\-fueled Trial Balloon Question to a line that Deconstructs the declaration itself as predatory in nature.
    
    Of implication, insinuation and ill will, till' you cannot lie still  
    In all this turmoil, before red cape and foil come closing in for a kill?

    I love you. Ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"

-   A line of Richard's in _Thrill Me_ doesn't use the word _love_, but the flavor is very much there, especially given how attached Richard is to his own intellectual superiority.

    **Richard:** _\[reluctantly\]_ …I… I screw up without you.  
    **Nathan:** What?  
    **Richard:** I screw up without you, okay!  
    **Nathan:** …you never said you needed me before.

And I realized this whole time that I was afraid of losing you to a future that ultimately has not yet been written, which is... stupid. \[...\] But you're ultimately right; we have nothing to lose.
