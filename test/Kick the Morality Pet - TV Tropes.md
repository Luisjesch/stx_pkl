**The Flash:** Can't \[kill me\], can you? I'm the last piece of your conscience. That's the one thing you'll never do.  
**Lord Superman:** I've done a lot of things I thought I'd never do these last two years. One more won't hurt.

The Hero has been taking a turn for the Anti-Hero lately, exploring The Dark Side with the help of an Evil Mentor, learning anger, or generally indulging in less than heroic behavior or abilities.

On the way, their friends will try to stop them, but the hero will ignore them because they're enjoying themselves too much. They're _this close_ to Jumping Off the Slippery Slope thanks to Evil Feels Good and assorted perks to lapsing their morality, and just when it looks like they're about to give him what's coming to him, they either miss the intended target and hurt an ally by accident, or abruptly realize they're being an abject Jerkass and attacking someone who's trying to help them for no good reason.

They've just hit the nadir of this downward spiral and the start of their return to the straight and narrow. By hurting their friend, possibly the Morality Pet, Love Interest, or The Heart for extra oomph, they do the one thing capable of prompting a Heel Realization before they do a full Face–Heel Turn (or cement the turn, at least). Cue cries of "My God, What Have I Done?" and "What Have I Become?!?" while shedding Tears of Remorse and Cradling Their Kill, they'll say they're sorry and try their hardest to resuscitate the dog they've just kicked.

If they weren't evil beforehand, whoever was inducing them to this behavior will quickly prove it by not turning back like the hero just has. They'll likely scold the hero for chickening out, thinking "They Were Holding You Back", and remark that evil does not spend its time petting bunnies (well, not during weekdays anyway). If powers are involved, expect them to go Drunk On The Darkside and/or One-Winged Angel.

Alternatively, if the character goes through with it, this trope may be used as a Moral Event Horizon crossing to show that the character is too far gone to pull them back to their senses, which will result in either an Ignored Epiphany or the character displacing the guilt onto someone else. This, paradoxically, may be used to mark them as _more evil_, since intentionally harming someone that you actually care about to some extent takes more dedication than harming someone who you don't care about. If the villain's relationship with the morality pet was their only redeeming quality, callously throwing it away can make them a Complete Monster.

-   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_: Emma Russell genuinely loves her sole surviving child Madison.

Revealing what he did to her to her son turns out to be a bad idea as it instantly snaps Peter out of his reverie and turns Peter against his biological father.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_: As the journey progresses, Frodo falls more under the Ring's influence. It climaxes in Osgiliath when the Ring influences him to stand in the open so one of the Nazgul can take it.

    Multiple Media 

-   Subverted in _BIONICLE_. When Vakama turns evil and Matau attempts to turn him back, Vakama has no problem beating him up and almost killing him. Despite Matau's efforts and heartfelt speech, Vakama couldn't bring himself to believe that Matau had gone through Character Development, and thought he was the same Jerkass he had been when they last met, so he felt no remorse after hurting him. That is, until Matau managed to prove to him then and there that he has truly changed.
-   _Danganronpa_: Junko Enoshima does this to basically everyone she has affection for.

    Visual Novels 

-   Inverted in the second _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_ game. Horace Knightley, the murderer of the first case, is a close friend of Simon Keyes, and pretty much the only person Knightley would be nice to.

It's actually the other way around, but he feels no remorse after learning about that fact.
-   _The House in Fata Morgana: A Requiem For Innocence_: The one and only person Lord Jean-François Barnier shows affection for is Ceren, whom he even tries to protect when the peasants invade his castle in revolt.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Collar 6_, Butterfly, aka Evita Kappel has one of these moments when she lashes out at her slave Gunther because he worries about her mental state. She immediately regrets it.

-   _Drowtales_: Ariel was heading toward the Anti-Hero/Anti-Villain grey area, but after accidentally killing a slave she became more of an Emotionless Girl, and more recently more of a Plucky Girl type.

-   Happens in the Webcomic _Zap!_, with the protagonist learning to use his forgotten Psychic Powers to control people.
-   In the _Secretary_ arc in _Nature of Nature's Art_, XZ "breaks up" with SV by quitting the college, and he goes into an Unstoppable Rage and kills her. Whether he did a Heel–Face Turn before he also died is up for debate.

Oscar, who has spent much of the Volume spending time with Ironwood, tries to appeal to Ironwood and get him to change his mind. When Ironwood refuses to budge and swears to let no one get in his way, Oscar remarks that Ironwood has become as dangerous as Salem. In response, Ironwood shoots him without hesitation or mercy.
-   A strange mixture of in-universe and out-of-universe examples: in _Twitch Plays Pokémon Crystal_, the Mob accidentally releasing Togepi instead of Lazer Gator caused them to take stock of themselves, eventually leading to its new and distinct themes and plot.
