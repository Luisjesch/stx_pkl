_"We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot. Loudly, and a lot."_

In works set in apartment buildings, characters will inevitably have to deal with their noisy neighbors. In more risqué comedies, this becomes especially problematic when the neighbors aren't merely loud about their daily business, but also their bedroom business. How the characters respond to overhearing these noises is up to them, though frequently, they decide to provide their own noises in response to give the loud couple next door A Taste of Their Own Medicine. If the main character themselves are doing the noises, expect them to deal with a Cranky Neighbor.

Sometimes the trope is turned on its head, with the main characters _trying_ to be heard right through the wall for some reason — to prove how great their sex life is, or to make their neighbors feel uncomfortable, for example. Another popular variation involves the noise turning out to be something completely innocent like moving furniture.

When not set in the world of comedy, this trope is quite often used as a means of reminding the audiences that this particular apartment building our character has just entered _really_ is as shady and populated with a bunch of suspicious characters as it appears from the outside, the reasoning behind this being, of course, that Sex Is Evil. This can also be Played for Drama if the character overhearing the sex is hurt or jealous because they are romantically involved or interested in one of the couple.

Anyone who has lived in a college dorm or an apartment will know that this can be Truth in Television. See also Ceiling Banger for a similar trope (and what something like this may very well elicit). Nothing to do with Right Through His Pants. Or, for that matter, when someone moves right through a wall. For couples whose sexy times are so vigorous that they _break_ the wall, see Destructo-Nookie. For when the sex is just exhausting see Post-Coital Collapse. See Wall Bang Her for when couples are literally having sex right against a wall.

Can have some crossover with Calling Your Orgasms, The Grunting Orgasm, and The Immodest Orgasm. Compare Don't Come A-Knockin', for a more visual effect communicating the same thing. Contrast Sex in a Shared Room, where the point is that there is no wall between the passive observer/witness and the couple. Has nothing to do with glory holes.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Invoked and Played for Drama in _Corsair_ after Ayace bluntly announces his relationship with Canale in attempt to dispel Aura's ideas of marrying Canale. Ayace goes to Canale's room and makes sure to have lots of loud sex because he knows Aura is going to come by later to talk to Canale and will hear them. Aura is crushed. It comes up more humorously in other places though, especially with poor Harold.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: After reuniting with her husband, after almost 20 years of separation across space-time, Athena and BM spend every night making up for it. They've tried to keep it down so they won't disturb their 17-year-old daughter Clara, but she can still hear them because she's inherited Athena's Super-Senses.
-   Louise and Saito narrowly avoided subjecting their classmates to this in _The Familiar of Zero_, when Saito reacts to Louise's priestess outfit with extreme enthusiasm. The passionate semi-roleplay gets quite intense until they hear a knock on a wall warning them not to do anything improper in rooms with thin walls, and then concluding "Lemon-chan? Really?"
-   Naturally, it happens in _Futari Ecchi_. Yura and Makoto are scared of having sex while staying over at her parents' because they fear they'll be heard and interrupted, despite being married already. IIRC, it actually turns out Yura's _parents_ are kiiiiinda loud...
-   Variant: In the omake of _Future Lovers_, Akira, after moving in with Kento and his grandparents, is initially reluctant to have sex with Kento where his grandparents could hear them, but Kento reassures him that they're too hard-of-hearing to hear them go at it. Cut to the morning-after scene, where Kento's grandfather asks if there was an earthquake last night and his grandmother just gives them a Look.
-   A possible variation, more aptly called Right Through The Wall And All The Way Over _To Other Countries_, occurs in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ when Greece tells Japan that it's best if he enjoys having sex more. Cut to a view of the Asian continent and Japan screaming so loudly that China yells at him from his own country (i.e. across an _entire sea_) to shut up.
-   A subversion from _Oreimo_: Kirino's Squees over her H-Game can be heard by her brother next door. He is not amused by this.
-   _Roll Over and Die_: A Played for Laughs Yuri example. At the end of Volume 2, when Milkit is cleaning Flum’s ears they hear strange noises from Eterna’s room. As it turns out, she could hear everything in their room. Due to their dialogue and Innocent Innuendo, Eterna thought they were engaging in more adult activities. Other misunderstandings ensued until Ink, who has a strong sense of hearing, finally made it clear Milkit and Flum were merely cleaning each other’s ears.
    -   Due to Ink’s strong sense of hearing, she is able to hear things through the walls or even on another floor. During Volume 04/Episode 05, Ink overhears Flum and Milkit having a rather intimate conversation, and she asks Eterna what the nature of Flum and Milkit’s relationship is to which Eterna can’t give an answer.
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: When Gojo and Marin are at a Love Hotel for a cosplay session (due to Marin not checking properly the place when she rented it), they naturally start to hear the moans from the room next door. This kicks Gojo's hormones into overdrive and even getting a Raging Stiffie while Marin is sitting on top of him.

    Comedy 

-   Australian comedian Josh Thomas tells the story in one of his stand-up routines (and on his album "Things I Have Said Before") about the first time he lived with a loud roommate, and how heartbroken he was at the sound of him having loud sex because he thought sex that good/loud was a myth from pornography.
-   Jeff Foxworthy has a story about a couple in the apartment room next to his and his wife's not only being loud enough to hear, but it also went on for _two hours straight_! He said he was tempted to get the man's autograph.

-   The _Good Omens_ fanfic "A Precise and Accurate History of Monday, Eleven Years Later" has Crowley moving into Aziraphale's small house in a small town(complete with nosy neighbours).

    Little did Spike know, that at the Crystal Empire, the six Knights of Harmony laid in bed with their eyes wide open, unable to sleep thanks to the noise "Whoa." was the group call.

-   At the end of _Class Act_, Duncan's parents hear a banging in the room above them.

He goes up there and catches Duncan instead having sex with Damita. After dad explains to mom what happened, mom gets horny and pounces dad.
-   Timmy Lea of _Confessions of a... Series_ has rather loud sex with a woman attempting to bribe him as he's the judge of a beauty contest in _Confessions From A Summer Camp_. Timmy is at least cognizant of his brother-in-law next door and tries to keep it quiet but fails and his brother-in-law is very unamused, especially because his wife isn't in the mood. Later on in the film, Timmy has sex with the woman running the music all over camp... with her microphone on. Once again, his brother-in-law is unamused, but at least his wife decides to put out this time.
-   In _Delicatessen_, a butcher and his mistress have sex. The squeaks coming from the bedsprings provide a rhythm for the activities of the other tenants in the apartment building — painting, knitting, cello-playing, and so on. This scene was used as the original American trailer.

-   In _Fight Club_, the main character gets exasperated at how he can hear Tyler and Marla having wild sex upstairs every single time, with the plaster on the ceiling even crumbling with their movements.

-   _π_: Brilliant but reclusive mathematician Max Renn can hear his neighbor having sex with her boyfriend right through the wall of his apartment.

-   In _The Saddest Music in the World_, Fyodor and Roderick walk in to hear Chester making loud sex with Narcissa upstairs.
-   Michael J. Fox's character in _The Secret of My Success_ is a victim of this trope. Best sequence is when at one point, when his horny neighbours are getting it on while he's trying to work, he goes to the fridge for a canned beer, grabs a stick, and begins waving it like he's holding a conductor's baton. We know that they do this a lot because he can mouth along with their dirty talk, and cracks his (overflowing) beer right at the moment of climax. Then he sits down at his desk and says, "You guys were good tonight." Unfortunately, the neighbours later on have another round, so he puts his head under his pillow trying to keep the noise out, but is unsuccessful, upon which he bleakly mimes being an orchestra conductor to the beat of the couple's increasing wails.

-   _Warlock III: The End of Innocence_: Jerry can hear Kris and Michael going at it in the adjacent dorm room. He looks sad rather than annoyed, hinting at his feelings for her.
-   In _What Lies Beneath_, Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeifer's characters hear the neighbours going at it and decide to compete with them.

    Jokes 

-   A personal account where a person noted that the floors and ceilings act as amplifiers for sounds from adjacent apartments, making it very easy to hear the bed scooting on the floor and the headboard banging against the wall. After 5 minutes, it was funny and kind of embarrassing. After 10 minutes, it became annoying. After 15 minutes, it was frustrating as it was preventing them from sleeping. After 20 minutes, it was kind of impressive.

    Literature 

### **By Author:**

-   A short mystery story by Steven Saylor has an amorous couple in ancient Rome (well, the countryside near it). The detective's teenage son listens eagerly but is shy when they heavily flirt in front of him.

### **By Work:**

-   _The Bronze Horseman_ by Paullina Simons. Insatiable Newlyweds Tatiana and Alexander have a loud argument, then equally loud sex in a communal Soviet apartment. Afterwards, they start a seditious discussion which Alexander quickly shuts down because the neighbours are likely NKVD informers. Tatiana just quips, "Well they've heard everything else."
-   In _The Girls_, Evie is uncomfortable when Julian and his teenage girlfriend Sasha are screwing loudly in the next room. Later Evie realizes that Julian, who is The Sociopath, knew she could hear.
-   In _Green Hills and Daffodils_, the manor house of Cwm Cudd has thin walls, so Rhys overhears a lot of Innocent Innuendo from his tenant Jane.
-   Talia in the _Heralds of Valdemar_ gets an interesting variant on this. Not only can she hear her "enthusiastic" neighbor, but she also has strong enough empathy that she can 'overhear' sex that way too.
-   _High Fidelity_. There, it's a major plot point — Rob recalls listening to Ray having sex with various girlfriends while he was still with Laura, and when they break up and Laura begins seeing Ray, he recalls it all and becomes intensely neurotic about it.
-   In John Irving's _The Hotel New Hampshire_, the prostitute Screaming Annie's claim to fame is that she fakes orgasms so loudly, everyone in the hotel can hear her. As it turns out, the orgasms aren't fake. Every single one of them is real.
-   _Loveless_: On Georgia's first night at her dorm room, she can't sleep due to the thumping noises caused by the couple having sex in the room above. It's subverted when it turns out later on that the sound is coming from the washing machines in the laundry room instead.
-   _Old Kingdom_: In _Sabriel_, the title character, while bathing at an inn, overhears a man and woman having sex in one of the rooms next door to hers. She assumes that the man is her travelling companion and is upset, although she tries to convince herself it's not important until her sentient magic cat-thing informs her that Touchstone's room is actually in the opposite direction and he's downstairs in the common room, to Sabriel's relief.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Lysa Arryn tells Littlefinger on their wedding night that she fully intends to be loud. She wasn't lying, and everyone else in the rather small castle they're in gets an earful.
-   Edmund spends a couple of chapters of _To the Ends of the Earth_ trying to figure out how to _avoid_ embodying this trope.
-   Occurs as comic relief in Frank Yerby's novel _The Voyage Unplanned_: the hero's Love Interest accuses him of having had very **loud** sex with another woman the night before. The supposed other woman was actually a terrorist who tried to murder him, and the orgasmic screams really came from the hotel room **next** to his. He proves this by banging on the wall and calling:
    
    **John:** Hey, kids! Time's a-wasting! Or are you going to let _one_ night wear you out?!  
    **Unnamed girl:** Eric! Oh my Gawd! The man next door! He — he _heard_ us!
    
-   Played With in _Warbreaker_. Siri quickly discovers that Susebron's priests are listening through the wall when she goes in to see him every night to try to make sure she's fulfilling her wifely duties. Since she _isn't_, largely because Seb is a bit of a Manchild and doesn't even know what sex _is_, she starts beginning every evening by bouncing up and down on the bed and making very enthusiastic noises while her husband stares at her like she's gone nuts.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Big Bang Theory_:
    -   One episode when a drunken and frustrated Penny decides to have sex with Leonard. Which is heard not only by their roommate Sheldon but also by their downstairs neighbor.
        
        **Sheldon**: FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.  
        **Penny**: Yeah, sorry about that.  
        **Sheldon**: As a native Texan, I must say I've never heard the phrase "yee-haw" used in quite that context.  
        **Penny**: Oh, God.  
        **Sheldon**: "Oh, God". That I've heard on multiple occasions.  
        _\[...\]_  
        **Mrs. Gunderson**: Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say "yee-haw"?
        
    -   In a later episode, Sheldon unwittingly gets his own back, as Leonard and Penny overhear the sounds of him and Amy having sex from the hallway.
        
        **Sheldon:** Oh Amy, you naughty vixen!  
        **Amy:** My goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient!  
        **Leonard:** Should we give them their privacy?  
        **Penny:** I want to, but I don't think I can.  
        **Sheldon:** Whoopee!  
        **Penny:** Okay, I'm good now. _\[runs inside\]_
        
    -   An earlier episode also had Sheldon casually mention that he could hear Penny having sex in her apartment for the past three years he had lived next door to her. She was appropriately mortified.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: In "Touched", the Scoobies and Potentials are all holed up in Buffy's house for mutual protection. Willow and Kennedy finally get a bedroom to themselves and act appropriately. In the kitchen, Anya complains to her former fiance Xander about the noises they can hear; after all, they've stopped having sex, so others should have similar consideration. When we cut back to them, they're making out on the kitchen floor.
-   There is an extremely disturbing version of this in _Carnivàle_, where the noises are of a girl being raped. The character who's hearing all this is paralyzed, though, and can only stare in terror at the wall.
-   _Castle_
    -   In one episode, a suspect's alibi was that he had been having sex with the victim's wife when the victim was murdered. This is verified by talking to the neighbors who recalled hearing it (it was a warm night and the windows were open).
    -   The episode "Watershed" features a subversion. Neighbors of the victim frequently heard sounds of sex coming from her room, which is part of the reason they thought she was a prostitute. She was really playing a CD of those sounds specifically to produce that conclusion while she worked on computer hacking.
-   _Cheers_: In "Those Lips, Those Ice", when Eddie shows up at the bar after a long time on the road, Carla takes him out to the front door. Then the gang has to uncomfortably listen to a lot of orgasmic moaning from the other side of the door.
-   At one point in _Coupling_, Sally complains of having a listening flatmate. When asked if this means she has to be quiet, she explains, "No, loud, we're very competitive."
-   At the beginning of the _Criminal Minds_ episode "The Inspiration," we see a couple in their apartment complaining about the noise from above. The girlfriend first guesses they're putting together furniture, then that they're "Doing it on the floor!" This being Criminal Minds, the truth turns out to be far worse. It's a Bound and Gagged woman flailing desperately to escape.
-   The titular _Cuckoo_ and Rachel are doing the deed much to the annoyance of her parents. They shrug it off as they're newlyweds and they were like it once… although nowhere near as long. They also make Dylan trade rooms with them so they won't hear them anymore.
-   For one episode of _The Drew Carey Show_ Mimi (Drew's nemesis) and Drew's brother are temporarily living in a trailer in Drew's backyard. Kate notices Drew is acting tired and we get this jewel.
    
    **Drew:** I didn't get a wink of sleep between the trailer rocking and the screaming.  
    **Kate:** Screaming?  
    **Drew:** I started screaming when I realized why the trailer was rocking.
    
-   _Desperate Housewives_: In "Being Alive", Kat and Orson's conversation is interrupted when they years Bree's orgasmic screech that could be heard throughout most of the neighborhood. Cut to Bree collapsing in bed next to Karl, both sweaty and wrapped up in their own Modesty Bedsheet.
-   _Dickinson_: Implied. In the episode "You can not put a fire out", as Emily and Sue lie in the garden after making love, Emily reflects that she already feels sorry for the dead that day. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In an episode of _Everybody Loves Raymond_, Robert is purposely thumping a chair up and down so his mother will hear it through the walls and think he and Amy are trying to conceive.
-   _Farscape_
    -   When Aeryn and Crichton finally have sex (while the crew is aboard an immature, and thus small, Leviathan), Rygel grumbles the next morning about being unable to sleep, and further is disgusted that it sounded like Crichton was _exerting_ himself. Cut to the blissful couple snuggling. Crichton bangs on the wall with his fist and makes loud moans; Aeryn laughs that _he_ was "even louder than that, if you can imagine".
    -   In the first episode of "Look at the Princess", Crichton barges in on Chiana having sex with D'Argo after mistaking her cry of "Yes!" as an invitation to enter. In the next episode, D'Argo complains that the Royal Guards burst in on them likewise after hearing her screaming.
-   _Frasier_ tackles this one a couple of times.

Later that episode, they find out that he is seeing other women when they overhear _those_ sex noises, too.

    -   In "The One with Phoebe's Uterus", Chandler starts going out with Kathy, Joey's ex, and is apprehensive about having sex with her because he's worried about how he'll compare to Sex God Joey, as he considers himself rather inept in bed. Monica tries to dissuade him, saying that Joey can't be _that_ good in bed, but Chandler disagrees given the noises that came from Joey's bedroom.

Then Nate gets a phone call from Chuck, who's apparently _not_ having sex with Blair at the time. It turns out Blair is just reading a fashion magazine and mocking Serena's bedroom noises to point out that the walls are thin.

        **Ted:** Hey!

        **Ted:** That's not what I was "hey"-ing you about!
        
    -   A vertical variant is seen in "Bagpipes"; Ted's upstairs neighbors are loudly playing the bagpipes. When Ted can take no more, he confronts them but backs off when he realizes they're an elderly couple.

Then it turns out that the loud noises were from the couple _above_ the elderly couple.
-   _Hustle_. While Stacie and Danny are posing as a married couple, they hear someone in the next hotel room and think it might be the mark, so they fake having loud sex to maintain their cover.

-   _Lip Service_: Tess can't sleep when Sadie is having sex with an Italian tourist named Gabriella (who is quite loud). Lexy, meanwhile, is also getting it on with a woman at the same time (not so loudly, but still to a degree she can hear). The next morning, she lets them all have it.
-   A similar issue comes up in _Living Single_.

    -   In one episode, she accuses her younger daughter of having sex with her boyfriend (who spent the night). Darlene asks why on earth she would even risk doing it in the next room. Her mother counters that she could have been quiet.
        
        **Darlene**: _You_ can't!  
        **Roseanne**: You can hear us!?  
        **Darlene**: I had to tell David you were moving furniture!
        
    -   Darlene also invokes this to play a trick on Becky. After Becky and Mark elope, they return to the Conners' house to stay the night.

-   _Shades of Blue_: After Harlee and Nava sleep together for the first time, he mentions he will have to write an apology noise to his neighbors for all the noise they made.

-   In _Silo_'s first episode, Allison and Holston have sex in his sherriff's office despite his protests that his coworkers can hear.

    **B'Elanna:** _\[reading from the PADD\]_ "Stardate 52648, 0300 hours: intimate relations resume." _\[addressing Seven directly\]_ How the hell do you know when we're having "intimate relations"?!  
    **Seven of Nine:** There is no one on Deck 9, Section 12, who _doesn't_ know when you're having intimate relations.

Joan was pretty amused with it while Rochford does not.

-   In the _Wings_ episode "Bye-Bye, Bunny":

    _This bed is on fire with passionate love

However from Word of God it probably shouldn't be taken literally at all.

    But these motel walls are cheap..._

    At the art museum or at a play  
    But when you and your partner are doing the nasty  
    Don't behave like you're at the ballet!
    
    'Cause you can be as loud as the hell you want  
    When you're making love (when you're making love)

    When you're making love

-   _Dragon Age_
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, this can come up a couple of times with the warden and his/her romance options. Justified in that the Player Party spends nights camped in tents in the wild, so there's not much of a wall to be had.
        -   If a female warden is romancing Alistair and has gone to bed with him, Zevran can make comments on how the affair is going based on things he overheard.
        -   If a male or female warden is romancing Zevran and has gone to bed with him, Wynne can bring this up to you in a lecture about appropriate behavior for a Grey Warden.
            
            **Warden**: You know about Zevran and me?  
            **Wynne**: I almost wish I didn't. Half of us aren't getting any sleep, the way you two carry on all night.
            
        -   Wynne may also lecture the player about the noise if he is romancing Morrigan.
        -   Also, if the warden is romancing Zevran, Oghren can bring this up in party banter, advising Zevran that "you might wanna, you know, keep it down".
        -   Leliana will also make the rather cutting remark to Morrigan if they are both romancing the Warden.
            
            **Leliana:** I suppose he must like your shrieking, you sound like a genlock being murdered — a sweet, sweet sound to a Grey Warden. You should try a little harder next time he takes you. I don't think they heard you in the Anderfels.
            
    -   In _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, as a female Inquisitor if you choose to pursue a romantic relationship with Cullen, their first time ends with a Desk Sweep of Passion followed by a Sexy Discretion Shot. Apparently, at least Sera heard them at it, as she later jokes to the Inquisitor about how "desks need to beware".
        -   Sera also pokes fun at a romanced Blackwall following his Roll in the Hay with the Inquisitor:
            
            **Sera:** _(teasing)_ I know what you diiid...! You two, in the loft.  
            **Blackwall:** Uh, h-how did you—?  
            **Sera:** Just do. 'Cause I know things.  
            **Blackwall:** _(whispers)_ Could we not speak so loudly about these things that you know?  
            **Sera:** Too late for that. You're the one scaring horses, getting hay up your nooks. Crannies.  
            **Blackwall:** _(sighs)_

    -   _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_: When C.J. chooses to have "coffee" (sex) with one of his girlfriends, the camera stays outside the home and the sounds of them having sex are muffled, as if we're listening to them through the wall. Later games with this option, _Grand Theft Auto IV_ (and its DLCs) and _Grand Theft Auto V_, also keep the camera outside during "coffee" or "booty calls", but the sounds are no longer muffled.
-   In _The Sims 2: Apartment Life_, loud noises will occasionally leak through the walls, annoying your sims who can bang on the walls to get the neighbors to shut up. One of the things that can leak through the walls is Woo-Hoo interactions.
-   In _The Sims 4: City Living_, the same thing occurs as in the second installment of the series when living in apartments. The household Sims will get angry mood buffs due to the neighbors being loud, ranging from music, to arguing, to them Woo-Hooing audibly, which is indicated by hearts floating out from their apartment door.

-   _Bob's Burgers_: When Linda's parents visit the Belchers in the episode "Crawlspace", their lovemaking is loud that Gene records it and plays it for the class the next day at show-and-tell. The sound also invades Tina's dream, in which lascivious zombies suddenly sound like her horny grandparents.
-   Comes up in an interesting conversation on _Danny Phantom_:
    
    **Danny:** I couldn't sleep \[last night\] with my Arch-Enemy in the guest room next to me.  
    **Sam:** My parents sleep in the bedroom next to me. It's not the same, but I can't sleep either.
    
-   One episode of _Downtown_ has Jen complaining about her roommate having extremely loud sex with her latest boyfriend.
-   Happens twice in _Duckman_:
    -   Bernice and King Chicken have very loud sex in the next room in "Cock Tales For Four" to the point where everything they say can be heard clearly and a wall gets repeatedly bent inward several feet. Duckman knows what's going on but Honey Chicken is too drunk to notice. The final episode reveals though that they've _never actually had sex_.
    -   Bernice and Cornfed do the same in "Pig Amok". It's so loud and destructive the walls start to crack. Duckman is too busy with his own thoughts to realize it, though.
-   Done at least twice in _Family Guy_, once during a cutaway gag with "that Persian woman in the attic", and again when Peter was trying to sleep on Cleveland's couch. The second viewer mail episode shows Stewie hearing it and dreaming about them as lumberjacks.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   Subverted in one episode, where the suggestive squeaking noises keeping Fry up turn out to be two robots mounted on bedsprings playing cards. One of them oils his spring and the squeaking stops.
    -   And played straight in a much later episode when Bender and a promiscuous ladybot go through the whole night, except for the occasional break to play country music right next to Fry's bed. And some activity involving a pneumatic drill.
-   A variant is played for laughs in _Mission Hill_, where Kevin can overhear his gay neighbors arguing over whether the condoms Gus bought are adequate for their purposes.
    
    **Gus:** What was wrong with our regular brand? These'll snap right off!
    
-   In _The Oblongs_, the sex life between the father and the mother is so good that every night she's saying "Oh God" repetitively. The younger son, having lived his entire life listening to them, finds himself incapable of having a good night's sleep without it, and gets insomnia when their relationship becomes rocky.
-   Marge and Homer often are these people in _The Simpsons_. Their loud lovemaking has been the subject of at least two gags, both times with reaction shots from Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and Ned Flanders (their next-door neighbor). On at least one occasion, the family holds a conversation about this habit while remaining in their bedrooms. Bart even punches through the wall to prove the kids' point.
-   _Rick and Morty_: At the end of the episode "Bethic Twinstinct", Rick, Summer, and Morty overhear Jerry and the two Beths sort out their issues with each other and they each try desperately to think about literally anything else as they all hear the Beths having sex while Jerry watches, encourages them and then joins in with them. The siblings are clearly uncomfortable and eventually break down in tears, having no way to simply leave.
    
    **Morty:** Wh-fo-Are you F\*\*KING KIDDING ME!? Why? WHY!? _\[weeps\]_
    
-   _South Park_: In _Post Covid_, Cartman, who has grown up to become a devout rabbi with Jewish family, stays at Kyle's house while the town is under quarantine. That night, Kyle is kept awake by Cartman and his wife having sex in the next room while he shouts things like "You like how Abraham trusted in the one true God?!", which inflates his suspicions that Cartman is faking it all to mess with him.
-   _The Venture Brothers_: A college flashback has Doc Venture sharing a dorm room with Brock, lying horrified in the lower bunk as Brock has loud, furious sex with a succession of girls just above him.
-   _Yes-People_: It turns out that 1) the older couple have a surprisingly vigorous sex life for their age, and 2) the apartment building has thin walls. Both the middle-aged couple and the mom & son are made uncomfortable by the older wife's moaning and screaming.
