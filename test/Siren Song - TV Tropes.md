_And you touch the distant beaches  
With tales of brave Ulysses  
How his naked ears were tortured  
By the sirens sweetly singing  
For the sparkling waves are calling you  
To kiss their white-laced lips_

A hauntingly beautiful song from a siren or otherwise supernatural being that leads people (usually men) to danger or even death. The trope's concept stems from the sirens from _The Odyssey_ whose enchanting songs send men and their ships to a watery doom.

Related to Compelling Voice, which is a trope about supernaturally controlling people with your voice. Compare with Will-o'-the-Wisp, a small, flickering light that lures people into danger and Brown Note, a sensory input that's harmful to whoever sees or hears it.

Subtrope of Luring in Prey. See also Our Sirens Are Different and Our Mermaids Are Different for creatures who are often associated with this ability (which are sometimes depicted as the same creature).

Doraemon gives ear-patches to everyone before making the trip, but the sirens' song is so powerful that it actually penetrates their protection.

Fortunately, Marina is aboard, and she takes the helm to keep the ship afloat.

    Literature

Skippers who hear it are "seized with wild woe" and cannot take her eyes off Loreley. Not paying attention to the dangers of the river, they accordingly founder in the waters under Loreley's cliff.
-   _The Odyssey_, of course. In Book 12, the sirens attempt to lure Odysseus by promising to sing of his glorious deeds in the Trojan War. Resisting the sirens' song is flat-out impossible; all he can do is block up his sailors' ears with wax and have them lash him firmly to the ship's mast so he can tell when they've passed the danger.
-   The second _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ book, _The Sea of Monsters_, features Percy and Annabeth going through many of the same events Odysseus went through in _The Odyssey_ (Charybdis and Scylla, Circe's island, Polyphemus the Cyclops, the Sirens, etc.). One of them is going past the island of the Sirens. Percy stuffs his ears up with wax, while Annabeth does Odysseus' role and has Percy tie her to the ship mast so she can hear their voices but not be able to swim towards them. Unfortunately, this fails. Annabeth ends up swimming towards the Sirens, and Percy has to jump out to save her.
-   _Trial of Champions_: One of the hazards you'll come across the titular Trial is crossing a cavern inhabited by a siren, who'll lure you to enter her pool with her hauntingly beautiful song.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _H₂O: Just Add Water_ and _Mako Mermaids: An H₂O Adventure_: Any mermaid can apply magic to her voice and use it to enthrall men, but that's rarely something they actually want to do. Cleo and Sirena both had a bout of sirenism, but neither had any real control over it— Cleo just wanted to be a good singer and hypnotized all the boys in town in the process, while Sirena's attempt to ensnare Zac made David fall in love with Nixie instead. More powerful mermaids can actually infect other mermaids into becoming sirens with their song, and the only cure is to drown out the original song with a less malicious one. All these reasons are why mermaid society forbids siren songs.
-   _Siren (2018)_: The Siren Song is apparently a defense mechanism for the merpeople: it's sung to distract or enthrall humans. Ben equates its lingering effects to an addiction; both he and Decker continue to crave the song long after they hear it for the first time. Decker's autopsy reveals that the Song actually caused him some brain damage. Ben attempts suicide after hearing the song. The Big Bad of season 3 takes this one step further by weaponizing the song and launching a mass-scale attack against humanity.

    -   When a Warden starts to hear this, it signals the beginning of The Calling, and the end of their lifespan. According to in-game lore, the song feels like an "intrusion" at first but becomes gradually louder and more fixed in the mind until the Warden can't live without it, or even remember not hearing it. One journal you find by a long-dead Warden veteran has the Warden's writing constantly digress into gushing its beauty, to the point of resenting being judged for enjoying it in spite of what it represents.

-   _Winx Club_: Daphne the Nymph softly chants variations of "Bloom, come to me" during Bloom's dreams. Daphne grows increasingly insistent and ominous as the plot progresses, up until their connection is strong enough for Bloom to see her.

Subverted because once she's there, it's revealed that Daphne is Bloom's older sister and the one who saved her from their planet's destruction. The reason for Daphne's calls is that she just wanted to have a family reunion with Bloom.
