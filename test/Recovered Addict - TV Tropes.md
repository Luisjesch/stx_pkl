_"Congrats — you're sober. It will take a while for your body to remember how to metabolize anything that isn't sugar from alcohol, so you're going to be pretty ravenous soon. Eat plenty. You can expect your coordination and balance to improve in a couple of weeks. In two months, you might start sleeping like a normal person. Full recovery will take years, though. It'll be depressing. And it'll be boring. Don't expect any further rewards or handclaps. This is how normal people are all the time."_

The Recovered Addict is a former substance or compulsive behavior addict who has managed to beat their addiction. They have managed to go through the rounds of rehab and withdrawal and come out the other side without falling Off the Wagon immediately after. Then again, addiction recovery, being a long and sometimes painful and/or dramatic road, they might very well have fallen off several times before they figured out how to stay on the wagon.

The addiction in question may have been alcohol, other drugs, gambling, or another compulsive behavior. Weirder fare like sex addiction, cannibalism, videogame addiction, and blood drinking are also possible.

They may have been The Alcoholic, an Addled Addict or a Functional Addict who got wise and found help. One interesting Character Arc and story for these types of character is to start clean, get addicted, and then recover, with all the drama and pain that that implies.

Once clean they can go one of two ways: be outspoken about how Drugs Are Bad and their own past and possibly become The Teetotaler; or try to forget and live down their past and move on, making it Hidden Depths. They'll usually be sympathetic to the suffering of others and seek to help in overcoming addictions as The Sponsor. They’re very likely to be found in a 12-step program or equivalent support group at any stage of their recovery process.

The Manipulative Bastard will probably try to get them to relapse by offering or forcing them to do drugs or otherwise kicking them Off the Wagon. Friends who are still addicted will probably crawl out of the woodwork asking for money or trying to get them to come back. It's unfortunate, but sometimes they do succumb and relapse, starting the cycle over again.

Interestingly some vampires may be able to stave off their Horror Hunger and become recovered blood addicts; transitioning from bloodthirsty monster to Vegetarian Vampire.

See also The Sponsor and Addiction Displacement which frequently accompany this character. In optimistic works, this can be the endpoint of a Descent into Addiction character arc. See also: Off the Wagon for when they relapse.

    Comic Books 

-   For most of _Justice League Elite_, Major Disaster kept getting wasted in order to deal with the stress of having to play a supervillain (because supervillainy was a previous addiction that he was still struggling to overcome). After getting so wasted that his powers crapped out on a mission, leading to the death of one of his only real friends, he tried to kill himself. When that failed, he decided retire from superheroics and join AA instead, and as far as we know, never relapsed (well, not on the drinking, anyway; he _did_ return to being a superhero, but since that was during Infinite Crisis, and he ended up dying in battle, he can probably be forgiven for it.)
-   In _The Order_, Henry Hellrung used to be a nasty drunk, the result of his playing Tony Stark on a TV show and becoming the real Tony's wingman. After his career went down the toilet, he got heavily into AA, and became Stark's sponsor when _he_ got sober. Incidentally, upon becoming the leader of the Order, California's post-_Civil War_ official team, he instituted a strict no-alcohol policy.

Throughout the film it's shown, however, that he has done a form of Addiction Displacement: rather than wagering money on sports teams or dice or cards, he now gambles with his business and his personal relationships instead. This is shown during the film by him doing things like recruiting little known sports handicappers, bringing them to the New York where potentially millions of dollars are riding on their picks and seeing if they crack under the pressure, (with potentially catastrophic effects on his business) or if his attractive younger wife cheats with his latest, very handsome recruit...

    Video Games 

-   _Fallout_:

This is _harsh_, eliminating Booze Based Buffs entirely and having a number of unpleasant side-effects from withdrawal... but it also grants +1 psyche, making it the only thought to directly increase a major stat. The flavor text makes it clear that it's still just taking the first step in a long, hard, unpleasant road.
-   _Night in the Woods_: Mae's father is an alcoholic, but doesn't touch the stuff now and hasn't in many years. He quit because he realized he was a danger to Mae and her mother. When Mae gets extremely drunk at a party as a young adult and is feeling the effects the next day, he doesn't scold her, but sardonically offers her a hangover cure: don't drink the night before.
-   James Blackwood, the Diver from the _Commandos_ series had problems with alcoholism in his backstory that resulting in him being busted down, even losing his commission. Given a choice between being discharged or joining the commandos as a private, he takes the latter.

    Western Animation
