Hmm, wonder how he's going to explain that spilled coffee...

Alice and Bob are eating together or sitting in the same boardroom for a business conference or something. Alice is in a playful mood, or she's of a mind to seduce Bob. At the same time, she doesn't want her intentions to be too obvious to the other people present, and verbally expressing herself directly to Bob is out of the question and/or would be inappropriate for the occasion. Bob and Alice are sitting directly across from each other at the table and this gives Alice the perfect opportunity.

Underneath the table, away from the eyes of others, she slips off one or both of her shoes and, using her feet, caresses Bob's legs. If she's feeling really adventurous, she'll go higher. Above the table, she can look nonchalant or indifferent so as to not arouse suspicion, or she can have a coy little smile as she watches Bob's reaction to her hidden antics, whether he's embarrassed or enjoying the attention she's giving him.

In fiction, this trope is usually invoked by a woman toward a man in order to express physical attraction that cannot otherwise be expressed for one reason or another; but the reverse (man to woman) is also possible. The Ho Yay version of this trope is not unheard of, either.

In these cases, the recipient's reaction/response may vary. They may be flustered or embarrassed, or may like the attention and even reciprocate. Alternately, they may pull away to show a lack of interest or, in extreme cases, make a move to stand up—if the instigator doesn't get kicked for their trouble.

Often it's a very specific type of Fetish. When done in fictional settings, it's done for Author Appeal or Fanservice. If the perpetrator is a woman, it's sometimes done to emphasize her legs.

It can also be done for comedic purposes, if the perpetrator ends up "serving" the wrong person underneath the table. In such a case, when the mistake is discovered, expect hilarity to ensue.

Compare Naughty Under the Table.

    Advertising 

-   More than one shoe commercial has used this trope. In at least one, the punchline is that the woman is playing footsie with a man in order to get him to take his shoes off, so she can steal them.
-   Not exactly "under the table", but a commercial about prevention of toenail fungus depicts something similar. When a man and a woman return home from a night out, the woman suggests the man take his shoes off before doing so herself. He decides not to, mentioning something troubling him. The woman then comforts him, by patting his shod foot with her bare foot and telling him, "I've been in your shoes." After she then explains what to do about it, the couple put their feet together and the man then jokingly says, "We're _sole_\-mates!"
-   An old Italian commercial for Ollis socks depicts a man doing this with two women in a restaurant; one of whom is wearing the advertised socks and sneakers. She responds by taking off her shoes and dancing on the table in her socks. During this, the man pulls one of her socks off and dances with her, before kissing her bare foot.
-   A commercial for Cranberry Almond Crunch once depicted a young couple sitting barefoot at a table, enjoying the cereal together. Towards the end, the man startles the woman by inching his feet towards hers, until he touches her toes with his own.
-   There is a Nissan commercial that shows a woman doing this to her date. He does the same to her, with his shoe still on. Then, after seeing the car that the commercial is advertising, he begins stepping on her foot like a gas pedal - presumably fantasizing about driving the car, much to his date's confusion and discomfort.

Suzu coyly praises how nice kotatsu are in the winter until she wakes Shirogane and he bites her leg.
-   In the _Girls und Panzer: Ribbon Warrior_ official spin-off manga, while it's common for tank commanders to tap the driver's shoulders with their feet, protagonist Shizuka Tsuruki does this to her driver Rin Matsukaze _without wearing any shoes_.

    Comic Strips 

-   _The Far Side_ has a cartoon with a squid oblivious to the fact that his wife and another squid are "playing tentaclies."

    **Denise's dad:** Maybe I should have said _silent_ prayer.  
    **Denise:** God would know if I wasn't honest.  
    **Peter:** \*shoves his face in the mashed potatoes, in embarrassment\*  
    **Denise's mom:** Peter dear, those potatoes are scalding hot!
    
-   In a _Spy vs. Spy_ comic, the two spies are invited to a tea party; where the hostess _appears_ to do this to the black spy.

    Fan Fiction 

-   A heartwarming example occurs in chapter 9 of Advice and Trust: Asuka is struggling to stay calm and maintain a poker face during a NERV debriefing after her synch rate spiked to nearly 100% during a synch test when she made contact with her mother in Unit-02's core.

-   _Kitsune no Ken: Fist of the Fox_: Naruto gets on the receiving end of this on two different occasions, both times during the story's Gaiden chapters.

Then, in the twenty-third Gaiden, Hinata pulls it on Naruto while they're out having dinner together.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_ fanfic _Long Road to Friendship_, Twilight Sparkle does this to Sunset Shimmer as a way to subtly let Sunset know that she's interested in her. It takes Sunset a while to figure it out, but she vows to "stomp her heart flat" if Twilight pursues it any further.
-   In a number of _Doctor Who_ fanfics, the Doctor has a fetish for River Song's feet (possibly as a result of her walking barefoot in the Tardis in "The Time of Angels"), with her teasing him with this trope, and him kissing her feet.
