She just "forgot" the rest of her clothes.

_"But before I go, I want to show you my new blouse._ \[opens coat\] _Oops, I'm not wearing a blouse."_

A woman (or occasionally a guy) is wearing a coat or similar covering, until she is talking to someone she wants to sleep with, or at least distract. Then she opens up and/or drops her covering to show that she's wearing nothing, or next to nothing, underneath. It doesn't matter what the cover is (a trenchcoat, a fur coat, or even a cardigan), or what is worn underneath (underwear, a swimsuit, or nothing at all), just so long as nothing else is being worn between them.

Now often this works, but just as often it can fall flat, _especially_ if it's a guy trying this, in which it may be Played for Laughs.

Depending on the clothes, this can overlap with Of Corsets Sexy, Diamonds in the Buff, Naked in Mink, Going Fur a Swim, Sexy Discretion Shot, Distracted by the Sexy.

A Sub-Trope of Ready for Lovemaking.

A Sister Trope to Dress Hits Floor (although they don't overlap except in rare instances that she insists on calling her coat a dress).

Contrast Defeat by Modesty, Modesty Towel, Wardrobe Malfunction.

Not to be confused with just lifting your shirt or blouse, or with being a flasher in general — the one committing the act should be wearing a heavier outer garment to make a visual contrast between that and the fact that there's too little being worn beneath it.

-   Fan Disservice example in a notorious skit on _The Tonight Show_ in the 1970s. Two trousered young women walk along a street and (in a parody of a popular commercial from the era) brag about their no-panty-line hosiery, which makes them each feel "like I'm wearing nothing."

    Video Games 

-   Happens with Trent Coat's second appearance in _Amateur Surgeon_: he shows up in the Abandoned Hospital wearing only red underpants under his coat, and if the multiple stab wounds and _scorpions_ he's afflicted with are any indication, it didn't exactly work out for him.

-   Subverted in _El Goonish Shive_, Tedd eagerly invites Grace in upon discovering she is wearing nothing but a trench coat but is disappointed when she says the reason for doing so it isn't sexual. It is only much later that it is revealed that she thought that the sexual nature of it was just because it involved wearing only a trench coat as opposed to an association of nudity with sex (this was just to cover the plot hole created by her being aware of such innuendo when her personality later developed into being more innocent than Dan Shive had originally imagined it).
-   _Grrl Power_ has an unusual accidental case in the form of Punch-Clock Villain Jabberwokky, whose coat falls open in the middle of a fight to reveal she's only wearing fishnet under it. Fortunately for Jabberwokky, her current opponent is the Dirty Old Man Math, who gets so Distracted by the Sexy that she is able to knock him out immediately.

One would expect Smedley to be distracted by her naked body. Turns out she's not naked — or rather, she wouldn't be naked until later — what she had hidden under the trenchcoat was two megatons worth of explosions strapped across her hips and breasts like a makeshift bikini. And then the Mask gives her a Shameful Strip, leaving her naked and a failure.

But when the flashlight goes back to it, the lady has her coat closed!
