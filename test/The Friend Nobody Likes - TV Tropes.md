"Hey, I'm relevant, too!"

_"It's like that friend who's the asshole. He's our asshole."_

In a group of otherwise good friends, there's one character who's an unrepentant Jerkass to everyone else. Or, if they aren't downright mean or cruel, they may be so stupid, annoying, or just plain weird that it's embarrassing to be seen with them. In any case, asking a member of the group "Why are you even friends with him?" is a perfectly legitimate question. It can usually be answered with one or more of the following explanations:

1.  **Seniority** — The group members have known this person for a long time. They might have even genuinely liked him or her at one point, but years of maturity and development (either by the disliked friend or by the others) resulted in this member no longer fitting in. Despite this, they continue to hang out with this person out of obligation, loyalty or familiarity.
2.  **Proximity** — They're neighbors, classmates, family members, coworkers, landlords, spouses/partners or some combination of the above and the group simply can't be rid of them. So they have no choice but to tolerate the nuisance to the best of their abilities in order to maintain peace.
3.  **Necessity** — They're worth keeping around because they're useful. Oftentimes, they possess skills or resources that no one else can provide or have qualities that hold everyone together in times of crisis. (Examples include the Bunny-Ears Lawyer, the Indispensable Scoundrel, The Team Benefactor, the Cloudcuckoolander's Minder, the Team Mom/Team Dad, or the Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass).
4.  **Control** — Someone with power over the group (parents, teachers, bosses, etc.) is forcing them to include this person, who is likely a spouse/partner or relative to said higher power. The disliked friend could even be that authority figure themselves.
5.  **Fear** — The last thing you want to do is piss this person off by telling them they can't join in. Similar to this is:
6.  **Goodwill** — In which the others will allow the disliked "friend" to tag along not necessarily because they're afraid of his or her wrath, but because they are too nice/passive to tell them to sod off.
7.  **Pity** — They're such a pathetic loser that the group just can't bring themselves to kick them to the curb. Alternatively, the group might keep them around _because_ they are pathetic since hanging out with the loser makes everyone else feel better about themselves. At its darkest extreme, it can lead to:
8.  **Abuse** — The group wants to keep this person around because they see them as a punching bag. Commonly, the group would have to be utter Jerkasses or bullies who seek pleasure in pushing them around. If the disliked friend gets fed up with the treatment and leaves the group, expect them to get treated in the wrong for doing so. Because Status Quo Is God, the disliked friend will be back in the group by the end of the episode. And while the group may have a Heel Realization and apologize for their bad behavior, they will go right back to mistreating their "friend" in subsequent episodes.
9.  **Audience Popularity** — Sometimes, a jerkish Ensemble Dark Horse will start hanging around the group just to feature them more prominently.
10.  **Supervision** — The disliked character is too dangerous or irresponsible to be left to their own devices.
11.  **Caring** — Deep down, the group (or at least one member) really does care (or the disliked character cares about them), and the issues all boil down to difficult behaviour. Even the closest of friends fight with each other from time to time, but at the end of the day, they are still True Companions.
12.  **Deserving** — Even if they don't _care_, per se, the group does recognize the character has some redeeming qualities despite their faults, or else they've done something to earn a place in the group.

It's not even that their friends aren't aware of their behavior, either. They're perfectly aware that the person is a jerk, or a geek, or a ditz, and will frequently treat them as such based on their behavior. They still get included in the group nonetheless, with the group often defending them if any outsiders insult or mistreat them.

In some cases, it's discovered that the group really does care about this friend and vice versa. In other words, "They may be a pain in the butt, but they're _our_ pain in the butt." Often uttered right before such lines as "You mess with them, you mess with all of us!" or "We're not leaving anyone behind!" The character may have a breakout episode that explains the reason for their attitude or reveals a human side that never showed before (such as a cute hobby or a Hidden Heart of Gold).

More tragic examples may lead to the disliked character Jumping Off the Slippery Slope, and their former "friends" bitterly regretting that they tolerated someone so obviously malicious for so long. Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal can be at play if the friend gets fed up with the way they treat him. The may be the subject of Speaking Up for Another.

This is Truth in Television. Chances are you have a "friend" like this (or multiple friends), or you may even be that "friend" yourself.

Compare Vitriolic Best Buds and With Friends Like These..., where this kind of attitude is usually limited to one or two select members of the group as opposed to being the opinion of the group as a whole (though the latter trope can compliment this one if one friend is actively disrespected enough by the others).

This trope may overlap with Loser Friend Puzzles Outsiders. However, in this trope the whole social circle hates the "loser" rather than an outsider to the group, and the person may actually have some cause for being disliked. In the other, the person is usually presented as being an innocent victim of prejudice, whether it's related to social Darwinism, jocks vs geeks, Slobs vs. Snobs, or racism, fantastic or otherwise.

If The Friend Nobody Likes is a protagonist or otherwise portrayed sympathetically, he may instead become The Woobie. The Friend may also be The Gadfly if they aren't an up-and-out jerk.

If someone is disliked to the point that people _won't_ associate with them, All of the Other Reindeer is in play.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Popeye_: Wimpy is a lazy, cowardly mooch, who would sell anyone out for safety, money, or a couple of hamburgers. As a result he is openly hated by most of the other characters, especially Geezil, who has gone so far as to try and kill him on a couple of occasions. The only ones who seem to like him are Popeye (and even he has his limits, like once paying off a cop to have Wimpy arrested because he wouldn't stop bothering him), and Olive (although she more than likely just tolerates him for Popeye's sake). That being said, because of his intellect and quick thinking skills, he does prove to be useful on occasions.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Arthurian Legend: While knights' characterizations tend to vary wildly, most of the staple members at least get a chance to be presented as brave, courteous, strong, chivalrous as well of protectors of the weak and slayers of evil. Sir Kay is instead, with the exception of very early Welsh myths, shown to not be a very good fighter, jouster or at all chivalrous with multiple instances of him harming or insulting the weak and being knocked off his horse by one of the other knights because of it. The only knight who may have it worse in terms of mostly consistent bad portrayal is probably Sir Agravain, and even he is usually presented to at least be an okay fighter, and even Sir Mordred is also usually a competent fighter at least, is sometimes shown to at least appear charming, and can even come off as a Tragic Hero depending on the story; plus those two are almost always villains, Kay is just a jerk. Even in the earliest tales which show him favorably, there’s scenes like Arthur roasting him so hard with a poem that he runs off in anger in _Culhwch and Olwen_ and Guinevere all but gives him the medieval equivalent of "kys" in _The Lady of The Fountain_. He is almost always presented as King Arthur's foster brother and one of the first knights of the round table, so the reason everyone puts up with him appears to be seniority; and because for all of Sir Kay's faults, disloyalty is not one of them.
-   Norse Mythology: Loki's insatiable need to play tricks and pull pranks on the other gods shown to be very tiresome and annoying to them. However all the other gods understand just how clever Loki is and have more than once used his wiles to get themselves out of bad predicaments. They put up with his more annoying aspects because they've seen what he can do to their enemies and they're just glad he's on their side, though even this sours when he and they learn he is prophesised to destroy them all in Ragnarok. It seems that Odin befriended him in his youth and they got on so well that he adopted him into his family as a brother, and the other Aesir got on with him initially but gradually his behaviour got too malicious for them.
-   Classical Mythology: The gods are largely a Big, Screwed-Up Family, but the one thing they all agree on is that they don't like Eris, the Goddess of Chaos and personification of disorder and discord. Notably, the gods once threw a grand party to celebrate a wedding and invited every divinity _except_ Eris, who promptly decided to crash the feast. She claimed she wasn't offended at all and even offered a gift: a beautiful golden apple marked "To The Fairest." She then "accidentally" dropped the apple among Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite, who promptly began fighting over which of them deserved it, and...well, ever hear of theTrojan War?

    Podcasts 

-   _Brimstone Valley Mall_: Misroch fears they're this to the rest of the band, aware they're sort of a loser who is _incredibly_ difficult to get along with. Asmoraius points out that it's not true; sure, Misroch annoys the crap out of them, but no one's forcing them to stick around. They're True Companions through-and-through, and while they won't hesitate to call them on their shit, they are still a dear friend to all of them.
-   _S-Town_: Discussed in regards with John B's social life. John B claims that all his friends are dead. He is also something of an outsider, being a fiercely intelligent and educated man with an interest in some very obscure topics who lives in rural Alabama. He mostly hangs out with local ne'er-do-wells, but is significantly older than them, has a very different world view and has a tendency to go off on long-winded rambles on whatever catches his ire that day. The ne'er-do-wells, on the other hand, admire his skills with practical chemistry and metalwork and humor him in his intellectual musings, but think he is weird and kind of creepy. They are very quick to squash any idea that they _don't_ like John, but are equally quick to point out that when it comes to socialising with him "a little goes a long way".

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Holidead was this in World Wonder Ring STARDOM. Her debut match saw her own Tag Team partner and the opposing team, who were members of her own Power Stable, joining forces to kick her ass before Alex Lee realized she would be losing too. And Act Yasukawa's Bad Boss tendencies aside, Oedo~tai are otherwise True Companions most of the time. However, during outside STARDOM excursions Holidead would establish a friendship, if a somewhat vitriolic one, with Thunder Rosa, and they seemed to bond with La Rosa Negra when they took her on as a manager.
-   Michael Cole was this for the announcer team during his heel run in WWE.
-   Byron Saxton is this among announcers. Every broadcast partner he has, even the babyfaces such as Cole and Tom Phillips, makes jokes at his expense and not the light-hearted kind either.
-   Corey Graves is often this as a heel colour commentator, due to his constant vindicative jabs at other commentators and creepy obsession with beautiful blonde heel wrestlers like Mandy Rose. He would often get into back-and-forth arguments with Byron Saxton (who isn't popular with the commentators himself as explained above) and/or Renee Young while Michael Cole tried to play peacemaker by calling the match, and Byron noted he was happy not to have to listen to him go on about Mandy at one point.
-   Sam Roberts is often this to the other announcers/commentators during the pre-shows on WWE PPVs due to his Insufferable Genius attitude. That said they will acknowledge his Jerkass Has a Point moments.
-   El Satánico Dr. No is one of the least popular luchadors of CMLL, among the other luchadors of CMLL. Los Sicarios del Ring Averno and Mephisto never fully recovered from the brainwashing he subjected them to but nonetheless it did not take long for them to turn on him and follow their own agenda. Rey Bucanero and Ultimo Guerrero kicked Satánico out of Los Nuevos Infernales, which he was largely responsible for the existence of.
-   Despite not officially being a member, JD McDonagh is this to the members of Judgement Day (aside from Finn Balor and to a degree Dominik Mysterio). It doesn't help that JD has been responsible for Judgement Day's major losses (such as Finn and Damien Priest losing the tag titles to Cody Rhodes and Jey Uso).

    Radio 

-   _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme:_ Two of them are among the perils faced by attendees of "The Terrible Leaving Do of 2017"; The new bloke no-one likes, and Barry, who never stops talking about his car. They, like everyone else, had only intended to show up for a while then duck out, but then it turned out not enough people had shown up to make this socially acceptable, leaving everyone trapped.

    Roleplay 

-   _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_:
    -   Jacob is an uptight Commander Contrarian who frequently complains and drags his feet when it comes to getting involved with the main group. Still, he got superpowers like the rest of him, which binds him to them through better or worse.
    -   Finn is an unrepentant and arrogant jerkass, who nevertheless received superpowers and thus is invited to join the group. He does at least try to help stop events from spiraling out of control.

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   Named for one of Dane Cook's stand up routines. He finishes it by stating that if you don't know which one of your friends is this, then that's because you yourself are this trope.
-   Gabriel Iglesias often tells stories of one of his oldest friends, Felipe, whose inability to know when to stop messing around is frequently the cause of whatever mess Gabriel ends up describing.
-   Louis C.K. sets up a bit about Time Travel by mentioning a friend of his whom he _hates_ talking to, but can't really avoid "because you can't break up with your friends."

    Tabletop Games 

-   A very common occurrence in _Fiasco_ because you are encouraged to play Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist characters, and the way the Relationship mechanic ties characters together in a circle. Even if two characters have a friendly relationship, one will usually have an unfriendly or power-unbalanced relationship with someone else, who will therefore end up getting pulled into the social group as soon as the chaos kicks off, and proceed to ruin everything. Of course, this is the aim of the game.
-   Among the Pentacle in _Mage: The Awakening_, the Guardians of the Veil and the Free Council are the most disliked. The Guardians of the Veil are the Secret Police of mages, working to contain knowledge that's too dangerous and willing to go to great lengths to do so, while the Free Council are radicals who reject the Diamond Orders' fixation on Atlantis, belief in hierarchy and subtle disdain for Sleepers. Naturally, their vastly different belief systems lead to the two least popular orders not really getting along with each other, either.
-   The Court of Mirrors in _Princess: The Hopeful_ are this to the Radiant Courts. Unlike the other Twilight Courts the court of Mirrors are merely narcissistic and solipsistic. Thus they are the easiest Twilight Court from the Radiant Courts to work with, however it's clear that the Radiant find the Court of Mirrors to be very very annoying.
-   The fluff of _Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution_ gives us Mama Bear: A scary, jerkass, drug dealing, stoner with a bad temper, who is also letting the main characters stay at her safe house. Proximity, necessity, and fear keep them around.
-   The heroes in _Sentinels of the Multiverse_ mostly don't like Setback or Guise much, although Setback has at least one fan (his girlfriend, Expatriette). Both are kept around and allowed to team with other heroes because they're useful and Setback at least means well; they're unpopular because Setback has a bad luck curse that keeps screwing with him and everyone around him, and Guise keeps nicking their stuff, claiming to be them, and Breaking the Fourth Wall.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   In backstory, _most_ of the Traitor Primarchs got on poorly with their brethren. Magnus's cocky use of warp power meant he wasn't trusted; Lorgar's desperation for something to believe in meant he didn't have many friends among the militantly atheistic Imperials even _before_ he embraced Chaos; Angron was a brutal berserker whose Legion slaughtered everything in its path; Konrad Curze was a sadistic maniac who led a similarly vicious Legion; Mortarion got along badly with any of his brothers who endorsed the use of psychic powers; Perturabo was always cold and distant from the rest of the family; and nobody _ever_ really got to know the militantly secretive Alpharius, with only Fulgrim and Horus himself really being well-liked. Among the loyalists, Jaghatai Khan's insularity and remoteness, Russ's studied brutality, and Lion El'Jonson's politicking meant that they were not well-liked; in the early stages of the Heresy, the Khan and the Lion were the ones everyone considered to have a high risk of siding with Horus.
    -   A chapter with absolutely no warm will among others are the Marines Malevolent (who, despite the name, are actually loyalists). Notorious among Astartes chapters for their callous disregard for civilian life, and general asshole nature. Game Workshop themselves hate them.
    -   The Minotaurs are a close second to the Marines Malevolent above in terms of "Space Marines nobody likes", being willing to let their allies die to make their job easier and steal gear from other Chapters. And to top if off, they're the High Lords of Terra's attack dogs.
    -   The Lamenters are hated due to being one of the Chapters from the "Cursed Founding" with everybody believing they're a bad omen despite being the closest thing Warhammer 40000 has in terms of "good guys".

    Theatre 

-   In _Jekyll & Hyde_, Sir Danvers Carew is the only person who can stand Simon Stride, a sexist jerk who works to bring Jekyll down at every opportunity. Simon gets invited to Jekyll and Emma's wedding, where Hyde kills him.
-   _Jersey Boys_: Tommy DeVito falls under the "Necessity" category as nobody can stand his jerkass attitude and illicit habits, but he's good at getting things done.
-   Michele in _The Saint of Bleecker Street_ is a bitter, resentful man, nearly a Hollywood Atheist in his cynical attitude towards religion. Nobody really trusts him, even before he murders his girlfriend Desideria, yet he still gets invited to sing at Carmela's wedding while Desideria does not. This may be because his beloved sister, Annina, is Carmela's best friend and was invited to the wedding.

    Visual Novels 

-   The _Ace Attorney_ series has Larry Butz, a loser who blunders through life without a clue and develops a crush on every attractive woman he sees. Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth tolerate him because he's their childhood friend (seniority), plus he's not actually a bad person, just oblivious, unfortunate, and irresponsible (pity), and he _really_ shouldn't be left to his own devices (supervision). Additionally, nearly every time he appears, he manages to provide a clue that helps crack the case...eventually.
-   _Danganronpa_ has its own page.
-   _Highway Blossoms_ has Mariah Pastorius, leader of "the Trio," a group of rival treasure hunters who repeatedly end up running into Amber and Marina. While the two groups end up forming a friendship of sorts, virtually everyone besides Marina considers Mariah a nuisance, as a rude, hard-drinking and immature woman.. Mariah's case is a mixture of Seniority (she and Joe have known each other a long time, perhaps even longer than Tess has been alive), Supervision in Joe's case(since as he puts it, Mariah "needs someone to look after her") and Caring (because Mariah has a few moments in which she shows she really does care).
-   _Raging Loop_: While Yasumizu is already a village of outcasts and exiles, some of the local denizens are clearly less 'in' with the local clique than others, which becomes a big social handicap for them when the village is forced into a Deadly Game of Werewolf. As an outsider, Fusaishi himself is immediately suspect by the local villagers (though in _Yomi_ he is not a participant in the game and therefore safe from being lynched or killed by the wolves), Chiemi and Kiyonosuke are both seen as outsiders (and the latter is extremely prickly on top of it) and therefore often become dumping grounds for votes when there is no obvious scapegoat available, and The Old Man Who Cried Wolf is considered to be worthless (and Kanzo suspects he might have been a wolf in an earlier game) and therefore often targeted on general principle as well. Finally, Rikako, despite her ability to loop through time, is not good enough an actress to walk the line between being seen as too passive (and therefore not useful enough to keep alive by the villagers) or too active (which gets her murdered by wolves or lynched when she is a wolf). Consequently she's played the game for tens of thousands of tries and never survived to the end until Fusaishi gets involved in it.
-   _Shinrai: Broken Beyond Despair_ has a few examples who aren't well-liked but still manage to get invited to the party.
    -   Kotoba Gaikoku, a notorious pervert who hits on both boys and girls. Even Taiko, his best friend, freely admits he's an idiot, and after it's revealed that Kotoba not only got manipulated into helping out with the murder plot, but had been stalking Momoko for some time, Taiko is unable to say anything in Kotoba's defense. In Taiko's case, Kotoba is an example of Seniority, since they've known each other for a long time, and Caring, since Taiko has seen times when Kotoba has proven to be a decent individual.
    -   Hiro Shiratake is an arrogant Jerkass who thinks most people are beneath him. The only people who seem to like him are Runa, whose crush on him blinds her to his faults, and Momoko, his girlfriend, the latter of whom ends up killing him for cheating on him. He's a Dating example, as well as a minor Control example, since the only reason Rie invited him and Momoko was because Runa asked her to.
    -   Mika Tamashii is a fairly obnoxious prankster who loves scaring people, having set out to scare 108 people so that her dad will buy her ice cream, and most characters are exasperated with her. She's the only character besides Hiro who doesn't have a best friend at the party; the other pairs are Raiko and Nobara, Runa and Rie, Momoko and Kamen, and Kotoba and Taiko. In the good ending, however, she manages to befriend Kamen, who'd previously written her off as not worth her time, by virtue of being there for Kamen when she's grieving for Momoko's death.

    Web Animation 

-   Jax from _The Amazing Digital Circus_ is a complete and absolute Jerkass who revels in watching his "friends" suffer, is only motivated by his own hedonism or comedic sociopathy, and will Kick the Dog every chance he gets. The only reason anyone even tolerates him is because the Digital Circus is a small place and Caine pushes them into adventures together, so avoiding this smarmy rabbit is basically impossible. Word of God even confirmed on Twitter that nobody in the circus likes Jax.
-   Bone from _Animated Inanimate Battle_ is hated by the other contestants for an unknown reason. So much so, that they put a restraining order on him where he is only allowed to go at least twenty feet apart from everyone else. Oodle's the only guy who actually likes him.
    -   Apparently, Bone is absolutely okay with being pushed around and being shunned by almost everyone.
-   _Bowser's Kingdom_ has Steve, a nerdy, none-too-bright Piranha Plant who keeps butting in on whatever Hal and Jeff are doing.
-   _Dreamscape_: Nik for Jenna and Aseir. Although its more that Jenna and Aseir are abrasive themselves, rather than anything Nik is doing wrong. That being said, he does love provoking them.
-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Dave is The Bully of the group, so naturally nobody is fond of him. The feeling is very much mutual, though.
-   Girl-chan and Swirly Glasses in _Girl-chan in Paradise_. The two almost never appear alongside the other party members, but when they do they're almost never acknowledged except in disgust and annoyance. At least until Swirly Glasses turns out to be "Captain Taisho Bushido Blaster Buster #1".
-   _The Most Popular Girls in School_ has Jonathan (Than) who is homophobic and in the closet. Nobody likes him until the later seasons, but he sticks around anyway.
-   _Puffin Forest_: Abserd, the multiclass adventurer with only one level in every class in the game. He has an extremely nasally and annoying voice, which justifies why every group he ever joined (from wizard circles to thieves guilds) quickly dumped him at the earliest opportunity. Sure enough, the party get rid of him at the end of their mission by allowing an evil elf queen to take him hostage, in exchange for the person they came to rescue.
-   _Revenge Films_: Cathy is disliked by the other moms owing to her bad behaviour at a cafe and she keeps inviting herself to eat with them. Cathy's rude behaviour got the other moms banned from the cafe so they had to find a new one and they decided to exclude her from going to the cafe with them.
-   _RWBY_: While "friend" may be pushing it, Cinder Fall has few genuine allies among Salem's forces, even counting the people she brought into the fold. Tyrian and Watts both take delight in mocking her failure at Beacon and her scars, Hazel treats her with cold indifference, Neo can barely stand Cinder and is reduced to rolling her eyes behind Cinder's back, while Mercury openly hates her and thinks she's "a pain." Emerald is the only person who likes her, and it's expressly pointed out that Emerald is a victim of abuse and gaslighting at Cinder's hands to make her feel this way. Even Salem finds it hard to tolerate Cinder at times, and admits that while she knows Cinder survived the Battle of Haven, she won't let Cinder rejoin their ranks unless she can actually prove herself.
-   _Teen Girl Squad_:
    -   What's Her Face in is explicitly called the "pity friend" and is the one the other three are most likely to ditch or relegate to the least-desired roles. Generally, this just makes the other girls look mean, especially Cheerleader. She's a deviation from the trope because there's nothing particularly _wrong_ with her personality. She's actually the nicest (and arguably sanest) of the four. This is why the other three look mean when they interact with her; it's because they _are_.
        
        **What's Her Face:** Can I not get stuck playing bass?  
        **Other Girls:** NO WAY!
        
    -   For that matter, none of the other girls really seem to like The Ugly One either. Not to mention, the others are delighted whenever Cheerleader dies. In fact, none of them seem to like each other at all, although What's Her Face gets it the worst.
-   In the main _Homestar Runner_ universe, Coach Z applies most of the time. Bubs and Homestar are the only ones who can tolerate him with in any consistency, and even they think he's a creepy, depressing, weird, disgusting loser to be avoided when possible — which he is, to be fair.
-   _Trouble Busters_: Minami was disliked by the other moms due to her bossy attitude and bad table manners. This led to them conspiring against her after Hikari found out that she was stealing fish from the restaurants that she forced Hikari to take her to.

    Web Original 

-   Played for Laughs in _The Angry Video Game Nerd's_ review of _Power Rangers_ video games. The episode has a parody of the show's opening theme, and introduces five nerds who combine to form the man himself: the Angry Nintendo Nerd, Atari Nerd, Sega Nerd, Playstation Nerd, and Tiger Electronic Wristwatch Game Nerd. The disgusted glare he gets from Nintendo Nerd and his own fading smile make it pretty clear the rest don't like him and he knows it.
-   The crew in _Binder of Shame_ is a group made entirely out of these people. Since they're the protagonist's only social contact, though, he actually goes into denial for a time and convinces himself that this is what friendship is (he gets better).
-   Jonathan in _Board With Life_. Not only does he openly deny his geeky tendencies and his friends and is constantly late to the group's game nights, when he finally shows up, he's constantly on his phone, zoned out, or distracted in other ways. And when it's his turn to host the game night, he only wants to play one game, the only one he's good at: Risk. I mean, Risk: Lord Of The Rings.
-   _SuperMarioLogan_: Cody is this because Junior and Joseph are often making fun of him.
    -   Bowser Junior is also this in "Stuck!" Joseph and Cody admit they don’t really like him and just use him to watch TV.
-   Maizono is this in _Danganronpa Abridged Thing_, most likely because she's a total weeaboo, with only Naegi and to a lesser extent Fujisaki tolerating her (enough that Alter Ego is hard-coded to use her weeaboo speak style).
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   Yamcha isn't any more a jerkass than most of the other characters and less a jackass than some, but everyone likes to belittle him because they see him as weak. On the other hand, Goku doesn't aim to belittle him as much and even quietly dissuades him from committing suicide in the future.
    -   Raditz and Guldo are treated pretty much the same on their respective teams, leading to the line "I don't know what this Yamcha is, but it sounds a lot like Raditz".
    -   Vegeta's status as this is lampshaded in Episode 38, after Future Trunks realizes just how much of a jerkass his father is:
        
        **Trunks:** How are these people friends with you!?  
        **Tien:** Makin' a lot of assumptions there.
        
        -   This ends up getting deconstructed in Episode 5 of _Dragon ShortZ_, where Vegeta's desire for a fight goes unfulfilled because the only two people that could tolerate him long enough (and survive the experience) for one are dead (Goku) and in the future (Future Trunks), and everyone else that could give him a challenge flatly tells him no because they're busy living their own lives and/or hate him and refuse to fight him out of spite, complete with back to back The Reason You Suck Speeches from 18 and Gohan. This puts his actions in the Buu Saga, namely going Majin and forcing Goku to fight him, in a sadder light.
-   In _Escape the Night_:
    -   Matt Haag AKA The Professor becomes increasingly disliked by everyone over the course of the show. Partially due to his arrogance, cowardice, pessimism and some poorly timed comments. Even his Only Friend Timothy seems to be getting fed up with him by episode 7.
    -   In Season 2, we have DeStorm, who was a massive pain in the ass to everyone, but especially Alex, who’s girlfriend got killed because of him.
    -   An even bigger example is Teala from Season 3. She proved to be absolutely useless to the point were everyone cheered when she died.
-   Fictosophy: "Jedi Coworker." Everyone's had it up to _here_ with Tom's shenanigans. The only one who's okay with it is Shannon, who also happens to be the manager.
-   _Friendship is Witchcraft_:
    -   Spike is near-universally loathed, _especially_ by his friends. Twilight outright treats him like a slave, though he seems content enough.
    -   Twilight is a less obvious example but she isn't well-liked by her friends. She's a narcissist, has creepy fangirl tendencies, and as the series goes on it becomes more obvious that she is a Villain Protagonist. Celestia in particular finds Twilight both annoying and unnerving.
-   When the _Game Grumps_ come together with their friends like Markiplier and Jacksepticeye to play some _Among Us_, Ross _quickly_ becomes this owing to just how good he is at being an Imposter. It gets to the point that they often target him just for the hell of it during votes, even if he's done nothing suspicious that round, just to get rid of him and remove him from the equation on the off-chance he's the Imposter.
    
    **Arin:** Hell yeah! We did it! We got rid of the menace! Whether or not he was actually the murderer!
    
-   Bladezz in _The Guild_, at least in the first season:
    
    **Clara:** He's like the retarded cousin of the Guild! The right thing to do is to let him play tag, even though he runs around hitting people.
    
-   Amir in _Jake and Amir_. Although Jake often denies that they're friends, at other times he doesn't and there are multiple episodes that feature them doing something together (be it with more people or just the two of them), so they at least have something resembling friendship going on. All reasons except for dating and necessity apply to Amir in some way.
-   _Sgt Ducky_: Tony is depicted as one as he gets the most negative portrayals in the videos.
    -   Tony cheated on his girlfriend and then he got vomited on immediately afterwards. During the party, Ducky and his friends decided to help their new friend Dan have sex with Emma because he hasn't had sex in 2 years and they felt bad for him. After failing the first time, Tony was asked to distract Emma while they prepped Dan for a second chance but Tony started making out with her instead. While they were trying to cheer up Dan, Emma threw up on Tony while they were kissing and it apparently got in his mouth. From then on, that moment was seen as evidence why you should never break a pact with the lads.
    -   In The Head Casey, he overdosed on cocaine during a party and had to be taken to hospital (where he then had to walk home for 7 hours after his recovery because his phone ran out of battery and he had no money for a taxi). Nobody felt too bad for him because Tony nearly got everyone arrested because the police came to the house to investigate the incident.
-   In The Key of Awesome's parody of "Somebody That I Used to Know", Tony gets this through Necessity, since, while he's sold all their other instruments and at least one person's set of shoes to pay his drug debts, he's the only one able to drive the van. There's also a measure of Supervision:
    
    "Hey, guys, where did Tony go? You all know that Tony can't be left alone."
    
-   Discussed in "20 Reasons Why NOT to be 'In Da Club'" by Matthew Santoro. Matthew talks about that one friend who's a total downer and nobody likes, but who the group feels like they have to invite because they're part of the group. Matthew then says that people should just not invite that person anymore.
-   In _Monster Island Buddies_, Gorosaurus was one of the original Monster Island Buddies, but Godzilla and company didn't care much for him and didn't even give a crap when he was kidnapped by Kong and taken to Skull Island. Even after he's back, the other characters still seem to dislike him, Rodan even says he scares the shit out of him. On the villain side, there's Gigan, who constantly tries his best to make friends, but is perceived by everyone else as annoying and stupid. Titanosaurus counts as well, due to his insane, psycho behavior.
-   _The Onion_ once had an article implying this about a man who was considered the "funny" guy in their group of friends, even to the point where he not only was totally insensitive to his friends' feelings and was more than willing to kick them while they were down, but unwilling to allow for any details from _his_ life to ever come out, save for one that the friend telling the story had only heard about: that he was getting divorced for the second time.
-   _Pirates SMP_: The Kite faction, being the Blood Knights and Proud Warrior Race Guys of the Faction Isles, are treated this way. Just about all the other factions look down on them, are wary of them, or otherwise dislike them — the discovery-avid Heron faction has a particularly strong dislike towards them for their "murderous bastard qualities" or otherwise "making murder their only personality trait" (both are direct quotes), whereas the wealth-hungry Kestrel faction mostly just look down on them for being poor; the Nightingale faction mostly gets along with everyone anyway and is therefore not counted. In spite of this, the other factions don't deny that the Kites are one of the four factions and have their strong suits in a fight, and some inter-faction friendships have been formed between Kites and non-Kites despite the apparent animosity.
-   A blog titled _Plausibly Deniable_ lists several possible reasons for the prevalence of this trope among social outcasts, mainly that they suffered from All of the Other Reindeer and don't want to put anyone else through that, even when the person is obviouly toxic.
-   _Resident Evil Abridged_: None of Wesker's subordinates respect him, because he's a smug douchebag. Chris describes him as, "a jackal who's married to his sunglasses", Jill thinks he's condescending, and Barry's only working for him because he _has to._ In the end, even the Tyrant turns on him!
-   Puddy in _Tales of MU_ is this to Mack for as long as she's Mack's roommate.
-   In Todd in the Shadows' review of _From Justin to Kelly_ (crossed over with The Nostalgia Chick), he wonders why girls always have a "Token Evil Friend."
    
    **Kaya:** Why are we friends with her, again?  
    **Todd:** _That's a good question. That's an excellent question._
    
-   The Tumblr and Tickld name for this type of person is "Moon Moon", due to a post where someone got "Moon Moon" on a wolf-name generator and commented that she would be the wolf no one likes ("OH SHIT WHO BROUGHT FUCKING MOON MOON ALONG?").
-   _Ultra Fast Pony_:
    -   Rainbow Dash, being an annoying, idiotic, crazy, Jerkass, with No Social Skills is _on a good day_ tolerated by the rest of the cast, any other, they openly hate and abuse her.
    -   Twilight Sparkle is _barley_ treated better than Rainbow, if at all by the rest of Equestria. But unlike Rainbow, while Twilight does have _plenty_ of flaws (she can be Jerkass to the others, she's a Know-Nothing Know-It-All, she mistreats her son/slave Spike, and she has an ego<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) she's also the only one that regularly _tries_ help and does occasionally save the day, making her mistreatment by the rest of Equestria seem comparably undeserved.
-   _Whateley Universe_: Dr. Venus says this to Dr. Macabre as she gave him both barrels in her "The Reason You Suck" Speech. As a Mad Scientist, you know you've screwed the pooch when Professor Guinea Pig says you've gone too far.
    -   Both Insufferable Genius Jobe Wilkins and aspiring supervillain Nephandus are seen this way by the other Bad Seeds<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , though Jobe gets a bit of Character Development in this regard later.
