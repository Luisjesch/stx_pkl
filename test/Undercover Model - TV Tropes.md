_"I'm in a dress, I have gel in my hair, I haven't slept, I'm starved, and I'm armed. Don't mess with me."_

When the Fair Cop (preferably a female one) is forced to Clean Up Nicely and pretend to be a fashion model, beauty pageant contestant, stripper or other hot-chick-related job in order to investigate a crime. The lady is usually Hollywood Homely and doesn't think she's attractive _at all_ until after the Makeover Montage. Often a shallow excuse for Fanservice.

Sometimes combined with Dirty Harriet, for example when impersonating a High-Class Call Girl.

    Literature 

-   Subverted in the _Discworld_ novels: The needs-an-official-document-to-prove-he's-human "Nobby" Nobbs and the gorgeous blonde Sgt. Angua von Uberwald perform an undercover "sting" operation requiring one of them to dress up as a "seamstress" (Discworld euphemism for "prostitute"). Guess which one.
-   _Ciaphas Cain_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> : Ordo Xenos Inquisitor Amberley Vail is first introduced as a Glamorous Wartime Singer. Helps that she sings very well and can act the part.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Happens to Myka on _Warehouse 13_. Sparks a discussion of Hollywood Pudgy (the writers think it's ridiculous).
-   Diana pulls this off in _White Collar_.
-   Kate Beckett does this impromptu-ly around Russian mobsters in _Castle_. More specifically: she ditches all clothing bar her bright red bra and panties and wears her jacket as a dress (with a Navel-Deep Neckline to boot).
-   A rare male case occurs in _Psych_ when Shawn and Gus claim to be male models. Both played straight with Gus and subverted when nobody believes Shawn is a model, forcing him to claim to be a hand (and foot!) model.
-   Diana Prince, in the _Wonder Woman_ TV series, went undercover as a beauty pageant contestant. Steve didn't think she was pretty enough to pull it off. Because Steve is an idiot.
-   This happened on an episode of _New York Undercover_—in this case they were male models. (In another episode they were drag queens.)
-   Every other episode of _Charlie's Angels_.
-   On the _Married... with Children_ episode where Bud makes an exercise video, 3 lady cops (coincidentally named after Charlie's Angels) play background dancers in order to take down the mob boss who financed the video. They also arrest Bud for perving on them.
-   One episode of _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_ has this in the form of Detective Stevens pretending to want to work for an escort service.
-   Amber Tamblyn's character in _The Unusuals_ had been working Vice undercover as a prostitute before being reassigned.
-   Comes up on _Chuck_ in one early season 4 episode: The mission takes Chuck and Sarah to Milan for Fashion Week (Casey has to stay behind after stabbing someone with a stiletto last time he was in Milan) to retrieve weapons technology from a Volkoff agent who uses her cover as a fashion model to move it through customs. Initially it looks like this will be averted in Sarah's case, until the pair is forced to go _back_ to Milan and she masquerades as a model to make off with the dress in which the technology is concealed. Of course, a Catwalk Catfight ensues.
-   In the 70's cop show _Police Woman_, Angie Dickinson's character goes undercover as a casino hostess to infiltrate an illegal gambling ring. Her job is to dress elegantly, be pleasant, and entice "whales" to stay and gamble. She blows her cover when a mob boss demands sexual services.
-   _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ has a Season 7 episode where Sabrina wants to get a news story on a talent contest - so she, Morgan and Roxie enter as a Girl Group.
-   _Hunter_: In the third-season episode "Double Exposure", Sgt. McCall goes undercover as a photo model to infiltrate a model agency suspected of foul play. She doesn't even have to Clean Up Nicely: using her natural good looks, she has no problems producing a portfolio that impresses the agency into hiring her on the spot.

    Video Games 

-   In _Hitman (2016)_, Agent 47 infiltrates a fashion show in Paris, where he can knock out or kill the male supermodel Helmut Kruger. They happen to bear more than a passing resemblance to each other, and add to that some heavy makeup, nobody can tell the difference between them, which gives 47 almost unlimited access to his targets. He can even quite fabulously walk the catwalk before getting on with his assassinations.

    Web Comics 

-   Inadvertently happens to Ki in _General Protection Fault_ during the Nerdvana arc. Ki doesn't try to pass herself off as a supermodel, but is mistaken for one anyway (partially due to the supermodel's thinking all nerds are men).
