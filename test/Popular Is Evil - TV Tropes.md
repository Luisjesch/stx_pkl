The Prom Queen indulging in her favorite pastime-laughing at a loser who got humiliated.

**Veronica:** Doesn't it bother you that everyone at this school thinks you're a piranha?

**Heather Chandler:** Like I give a shit. They all want me as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg, and I'm only a junior.

One of the most well-known laws of any High School fiction — if you're popular and beautiful, you're basically Satan's minions. The legions of the popular are good-looking but mean-spirited bullies who delight in tormenting the dorks and dweebs around them in despicable ways.

The popular guys are usually on the football team, sporting varsity jackets while they stuff some nerd in a locker. They could also pull down his pants to show off his “tighty-whitey” briefs, throw him in a garbage can, and call him insulting nicknames that the rest of the student body repeats.

Meanwhile, the popular girls form a Girl Posse, led by the Alpha Bitch, using their beauty to seduce guys from their girlfriends and mocking less popular girls for everything from their fashion sense to their unusual interests. They might even spread vicious rumors about their worst enemies and set them up to be humiliated, especially if they're cheerleaders and can set up a pep rally to pull a nasty prank in front of the whole school, or a sorority who can manipulate you into being alone with them.

At some point, you have to wonder how these people got popular in the first place, or if even they can even be called that since "popular" literally means "liked by many".

If there is a nice person who is part of the popular crowd, they will be revealed to be a Peer-Pressured Bully who is secretly unhappy. Because of course, even when you're friends with the popular kids, they're not really your friends, always pushing you to be mean or do bad stuff, and threatening to ruin your life if you don't comply.

The good guys in these stories are usually the unpopular kids, who eventually get fed up with being treated like trash and overthrow the popular kids to free the school of their tyranny. If one of the unpopular kids becomes popular, they will snub and maybe even bully their old dorky friends, either from Acquired Situational Narcissism or out of pressure from their new cool friends. Once they fall out with the popular crowd, they will revert back to their kind, good-natured self. In fact, many cool kids who become unpopular in fiction end up becoming much nice and happier as a result; the moral of some stories could be summed up as "Popularity corrupts people, so it's better to be a loser."

This may be because of a Popularity Cycle - because popularity is ephemeral, you have to be the scariest of the bunch to stay on top. It could also stem from Write What You Know. A lot of people who end up in creative roles were low on the popularity totem pole during their high school years and often project their resentment about being looked down on into their adult creations.

Stunts the popular kids will pull are things like It's a Costume Party, I Swear!, Prank Date, Party Scheduling Gambit, Instant Humiliation Just Add Youtube, "Kick Me" Prank, and too many others to list. They'll be the Carload of Cool Kids, or the Snobs on the Slobs vs. Snobs.

For types of evil popular characters, see Big Jerk on Campus, Jerk Jock, Alpha Bitch, Academic Alpha Bitch, Girl Posse, and Cruel Cheerleader. Contrast Lovable Jock, Spoiled Sweet, Big Man on Campus, Pom-Pom Girl and Class Princess, who are popular _and_ nice.

Compare Popular Is Dumb, which can overlap with this trope, but mean and stupid are two different things.

## Examples of the trope:

    Asian Animation 

-   _BoBoiBoy_: Downplayed and subverted. Fang developed a band of admirers during his first 6 months at school, but was too arrogant to make friends. He isn't happy when it appears that BoBoiBoy is more popular than him. It was his quest for popularity that temporarily got him tangled with the show's villains when they promised that he'd be more popular if he did a task for them (though he was unaware they were evil). Fang would gradually warm up to BoBoiBoy and his friends later on, and he now seems less obsessed about being more popular than BoBoiBoy.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Chronicles of Wormwood_: Early in the story, Danny is faced with an obnoxious journalist. Wondering what it was that drove her to be that way, he delves into her mind... and finds a memory of the journalist in high school, reduced to tears while picking up her school things from the ground and being mocked by other students. Unfortunately, when he reads people's minds it also brings up that memory for them. The interview ends right there, with Danny feeling appropriately guilty.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _13 Going on 30_: It's revealed that Jenna became mean and stuck-up after she finally reached her goal of joining the Girl Posse at school.
-   _Heathers_: Played straight and downplayed each with half the school's Girl Posse. The leader, Heather Chandler and her successor Heather Duke, can only be described as evil incarnate. The other half, Heather McNamara and Veronica Swayer, are nice deep down, but they are pressured to be mean and are secretly deeply unhappy, despite being popular.
-   _Jawbreaker_: The three surviving members of the Girl Posse at Reagan High were constantly shown to be shallow, vapid and cruel, until one Took a Level in Kindness after they accidentally killed their only nice member. The other two go so far as to cover up the manslaughter, and even bribe a dork with a makeover to buy her silence. Of course, in compliance with the laws of this trope, said dork becomes a bitch soon after her new look wins her popularity.
-   The most iconic example of this trope is _Mean Girls_. The Girl Posse is shown to belittle others behind their back, set them up to get in trouble with their parents, and lie to and manipulate even each other. Janis convinces Cady to go undercover to sabotage Regina, but when Regina falls from grace, the other two Plastics look to her for leadership, seeing her as their new Alpha Bitch. The power shift goes to her head and she turns into Regina's double. Actually, the film also subverts this with Janis. Even though she is one of the school outcasts, she is shown to be just as bad as Regina, manipulating Cady to use her against Regina in her revenge plot.

However, after suffering humiliation on the first day, he drifted apart from them and fell in with the nerd crowd.

Virgil himself briefly gets Acquired Situational Narcissism when he becomes friends with them again.

-   _Romy and Michele's High School Reunion_: All the popular kids used to make fun of Romy and Michele back then, from the Girl Posse to the Jerk Jock that ditched Romy waiting for a dance with him.

Once she lost touch with her high school friends, she grew up to be a good person and finally sticks it to Christie at the reunion.

    Literature 

-   _Carrie_: Perhaps the most infamous of this trope. The popular girls, led by Chris Hargensen, are so ruthless and cruel, they’re not satisfied with scarring Carrie for life in the locker room, throwing tampons and pads at her when she got her period and chanting “plug it up” over and over. No, they have to take to _really_ that Moral Event Horizon and devastate her in front of the _whole school_ at prom by rigging the votes to get her announced prom queen, then dumping a bucket of pig’s blood on her right after she’s crowned. After that, it’s really hard to feel sorry for those girls when they die brutal deaths at Carrie’s hands.

When Gillian stops pursuing popularity, she says she would still enjoy hanging out with a few of them and comes to regard one girl as a genuine friend, but isn't that bothered about the rest. Gillian is surprised that despite her popularity, no one truly likes Tanya much; conversely, David is also popular and is genuinely liked by almost everyone for his kindness and approachability.

        -   In one episode, Miley wishes that she was "all Hannah, all the time", and must live in her new life.
