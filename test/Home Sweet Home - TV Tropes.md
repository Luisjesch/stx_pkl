And rejoicing all the way.

_"Journeys end in lovers meeting,  
Every wise man's son doth know."_

Maybe, despite your Refusal of the Call, you got dragged in, but you have always longed for escape; maybe you Jumped at the Call and are now older and wiser; maybe you did love being In Harm's Way, but it's gotten old now, or you've fallen in love, or your cynicism has been overcome by the Close-Knit Community. It's time for the Happy Ending: to go, and stay, home. Nice, peaceful, safe home. And do all sorts of quiet things. Maybe settle down with the Love Interest and indulge in Babies Ever After, or just grow some flowers. Definitely stop all this dangerous adventuring stuff. Any attempt at And the Adventure Continues will be rebuffed with We Are Not Going Through That Again.

You Can't Go Home Again? No matter, if you found another place that can serve as home. Often, it's better than the original. (Indeed, if the original was bad enough, this can actually motivate adventure, to find some place better.)

If you can't get home, or find a replacement, often the driving force of There's No Place Like Home. Compatible with I Choose to Stay, as long as there is some place to settle down there.

The Quest for the Bluebird of Happiness famously ends in returning home to find it nesting there, sometimes explicitly stated as this.

May end in Stranger in a Familiar Land, deflating hopes; this can result in his searching for a new home, his realizing that his new home is where his new love and new friends are, or his deciding that after all, he loves being In Harm's Way.

Inverse of both In Harm's Way and Small Town Boredom — although it is not unknown for a character to oscillate between them. Can also be a motive for avoiding the Decadent Court. Contrast with Moving-Away Ending, which ends with a character leaving home.

It obviously can occur throughout the story, but can only be fulfilled at the end. As a consequence, often the bait for a "Leave Your Quest" Test. If it's the hero's primary motivation throughout the story, it's The Homeward Journey.

Often causes the character to hate being Famed In-Story, as that drags him away from home and draws curious visitors who clutter up the quiet life. The Heroic Neutral (often the Retired Badass) has succeeded in getting home, and the reason he will return to adventure is that Evil refuses to let him live there.

In a series, may require Passing the Torch.

The original music from the Funimation dub was even called 'Home Sweet Home'.
-   The last episode of _Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood_ has Edward and Alphonse returning home to the Rockbells, and Edward proposing to Winry. Somewhat subverted in that they depart again to learn more about alchemy, but it's later shown that both do return and have Babies Ever After with their respective love interests.

-   In the epilogue of _The (Questionable) Burdens of Leadership of a Troll Emperor_, Warmaster Setsuna finally retires after several hundred years serving under Naruto and Xanna against their enemies.

-   Varric, just like in the game, is really homesick for Kirkwall in the _Twice Upon an Age_ series.

At the end of the show, he realises that the best chance for long-term peace the Alpha and Gamma Quadrants have is for him to return to his people and teach them that the Solids don't have to be their enemy. To do this, he has to sacrifice the love of his life, making his return home less "sweet" and more "bittersweet".
    -   Garak spends the entire seven years of the show in exile from Cardassia but clearly very much in love with the world he's come from, longing to return home but unable to do so.
