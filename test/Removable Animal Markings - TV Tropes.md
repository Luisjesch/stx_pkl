In fiction, an animal's natural markings, such as a tiger's or a zebra's stripes or a leopard's spots, are often depicted as being removable. They can either be pulled off, washed off like paint, or fall off, yet the rest of their fur stays the same.

Can also apply to the markings on hands and feet, whether white, lighter colored, darker colored, or black, that look like socks, gloves, boots, stockings, slippers, and mittens.

In Real Life, these markings are part of the animals' anatomy and can't be removed any more than the rest of their fur or feathers can. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

An unremovable animal marking that looks like an article of clothing is a Clothing Appendage.

Sister Trope to Removable Shell and Fur Is Clothing.
