_"Selective muteness is something a person may not have control over in the beginning. In the case of Her Majesty, I assume the shock of the battle rendered her unable to process her emotions, leading to her silence unless it dealt with the country as a whole."_

A Heroic BSoD intense enough to crash your language software. Which is to say, a character experiencing trauma or severe emotional stress loses the ability to speak.

How long this lasts varies. Sometimes the moment passes quickly, but other times the character remains silent until their emotional wounds are healed. Character with great suffering in their backstories, e.g. a Broken Bird, may be introduced as speechless and then begin to speak again to show that they are recovering. Epiphany Therapy may be involved.

Contrast with Elective Mute, which is when a character is intentionally quiet. See also Sarcasm Failure and Angrish. Also see Silence of Sadness for when someone _can_ speak while they're sad, but they just choose to speak less. Also, with Silence of Sadness, the reason might not be outright traumatic, but it can be. Also compare Lost Voice Plot for when someone can't speak for a medical or supernatural reason.

    Real Life 

-   Maya Angelou, as described in her memoir _I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings_, spent five years of her childhood nearly mute, believing that if she spoke, her words would be responsible for someone getting killed. This came about due to a traumatic incident when she was eight, when she was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend and she confessed what had happened to her brother, who told the rest of her family. The boyfriend spent one day in jail, but was found beaten to death four days after his release, and Angelou came to feel as though she had caused his death by speaking out and became so afraid of the power of her own words that she didn't want to say anything. Angelou credits her teacher Bertha Flowers for helping her to speak again (as well as introducing her to the classics of literature that would later serve as the foundation for her later career as a writer, poet, actress, and civil rights activist).

She was a woman who tried unsuccessfully to save her sister from a tiger, and ended up witnessing her sister's death before being chased by the tiger herself. Her family told Corbett she had not spoken since the attack, which took place a year before Corbett met her. She began speaking again after Corbett killed the tiger and showed her its skin, although Corbett himself was skeptical that this was the only factor in her recovery.
-   This can happen, temporarily or permanently, as a result of brain damage or illness, and is known as aphonia. It can often happen due to stroke, but can also be brought about temporarily by migraines or epilepsy.
-   Autistic individuals sometimes have this happen to them as a reaction to being overwhelmed, experiencing Sensory Overload, or facing extreme stress, as well as other reasons; although in this case it would be called going nonverbal.
