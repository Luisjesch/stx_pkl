Hmm, maybe you used too much eyeliner.

Need a striking, original character design, but only know how to draw about six faces? Why, give them a pair of Unusual Eyebrows, of course!

Apart from hair, giving a character a pair of not-quite-standard looking eyebrows is an easy way to make them physically stand out without making them more difficult to draw. Best yet, there's an easy selection of potential eyebrow styles to choose from:

-   **Kinked/Squiggly Eyebrows** - a pair of thin eyebrows with one or two "kinks" near the end. Usually used to make the character just eye-catching enough without being overly jarring. More extreme examples might resemble scythes.
-   **Fiery Eyebrows** - usually found on Hot-Blooded characters, these eyebrows are thicker than normal (though not quite a big as the Big Ol' Eyebrows. Usually), and spiky or forked at the ends. They're often paired with Hot-Blooded Sideburns. Some examples may involve literally Flaming Hair.
-   **Swooped Eyebrows** - eyebrows that curve upwards rather than arch like normal eyebrows. Typically used for otherworldly or "alien" characters, though they do occasionally show up on normal (if often strange) humans. This is also the most likely example to appear on Live-Action TV characters.
-   **Lightning Eyebrows** - Eyebrows shaped like lightning bolts; Exactly What It Says on the Tin, in other words. Have similar connotations as Fiery Eyebrows, but are usually found on secondary/supporting characters instead.

Some styles have become so common that they've earned their own tropes:

-   Big Ol' Eyebrows
-   Big Ol' Unibrow
-   Disembodied Eyebrows
-   No Brows

Make the character's eyebrows odd enough, and you might find fans obsessing over them as much as the Iconic Outfit.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_:
    -   Shigure Kosaka has kinked eyebrows. Damn, are they squiggly.
    -   Shio Sakaki has fiery eyebrows.
    -   Akisame has lightning eyebrows.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Sanji's right eyebrow is not only swooped, but twirly. We do not ever see his left eyebrow — or eye, for that matter. As of the timeskip his other eye is revealed... it swirls on the end that is near his nose making a @\_ @\_ face. Zoro mocks his eyebrows frequently, and other strangers comment on Sanji’s weird facial feature. When Sanji becomes defacto captain of a part of the crew, they immediately call themselves the “Twirlyhats”.
        -   Sanji’s brothers Ichiji, Niji and Yonji as well his sister Reiji all have twirly eyebrows though they swirl in different directions to their brother. Vinsmoke Sora whose the mother of Sanji doesn’t have twirly brows and his father Judge mysterious keeps his brows hidden at all times... Wild Mass Guessing away.
    -   Rob Lucci. Crosses over into a reverse of Swooped Eyebrows, and distinctly scythe-like. This is actually a rather common type of eyebrows in One Piece.
    -   Canon Filler villain Foxy has particularly spikey eyebrows.
-   Roger Smith from _The Big O_. They're sort of...windshield wiper-shaped.
-   Shuda, the initial dragon from _Rave Master_. To show that his Dark Bring gave him a fire power not only did he get red hair that shot up like fire, he got eyebrows that did the same thing.
-   _Eyeshield 21_:
    -   Kid has eyebrows that are squiggly at the ends. In fact Hiruma's nickname for him is "Fucking Eyebrows".
    -   Daigo Ikari is probably the most hot-blooded character in a series full determinators and manly men. As if to prove how hot-blooded he is, he has flame brows _drawn_ where his eye brow should be, apparently using black eye grease.
    -   Raimon "Monta" Taro has your standard Big Ol' Eyebrows, except for the fact that they somehow go through _over_ his hairline in Captain Crunch-like fashion.
-   While not as emphasized as most examples, Fangfang from _Rosario + Vampire_ has kinked eyebrows.
-   In _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_, Domon Kasshu's fiery eyebrows are a relatively subtle example (or at least more subtle than the _rest_ of him, anyway). The _real_ winner, however, is Argo Gulskii, who looks like he set his eyelids on fire.
-   Kittan Bachika from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ — a show that _overflows_ with Hot Blood and Rule of Cool — is easily recognizable by his Fiery Eyebrows and giant shock of two-toned hair.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_'s Dorothy Catalonia has a pair of the most prominent fiery eyebrows ever (just look up above again). Her possible idol was Victory Gundam's Katejina Loos, hers being not as weird but still kind of prominent.
    -   _Go For It, Domon W!_, a non-canonical 4-koma that ran as a backup feature in the manga (featuring characters from _G Gundam_ and _Gundam Wing_), showed that she can change their shape at will, to imitate the V-fins of various Gundams. In another strip, Dorothy took Allenby's Nobel Gundam and customized it for her own use; the modifications included new V-fins to match her eyebrows.
    -   Her cousin Treize has the same kind of eyebrows, just not as prominent.
-   _Mazinger Z_: Kouji sports a pair of very prominent, very thick fiery eyebrows.
-   The majority of characters from _Outlaw Star_ have fiery eyebrows — Gene, Jim and Aisha in particular.

-   Ryoma Nagare<small>◊</small> in any incarnation of _Getter Robo_ has fiery eyebrows.
-   The Raikage from _Naruto_ has forked eyebrows which go with his forked mustache, dagger-like beard, and pointy slicked back hair. Given his fighting style and title they're probably meant to be more like lightning than fire, but not lightning eyebrows because that wouldn't really fit with the art-style.
    -   Guy gains literal Fiery Eyebrows when using the Eighth Gate.
-   Inspector Lunge<small>◊</small> from _Monster_ has swooped eyebrows.

-   Abarai Renji<small>◊</small> from _Bleach_, with whom it's hard to tell where the tattoos start and his eyebrows begin.

-   Hoover Kippenburg from the _Area 88_ manga has thin, violently arched eyebrows.
-   Some characters in _Dragon Ball_, such as Vegeta, or anyone gone Super Saiyan, seem to have their eyebrows directly attached to their eyes. As a result they often look serious or angry, although causality of this is up for debate.
-   A few characters from _My Hero Academia_, such as Tenya Iida and his brother Tensei, who both have eyebrows which are pointed at the ends.

    Comic Books 

-   Starfire and her people are sometimes drawn with the distal ends of their eyebrows connecting to their hair.
-   Jason Blood, host of Etrigan, has distinctive swooped eyebrows with pointy tufts on the arches, which makes him recogizable at a glance even in instances like his appearance as one of several individuals held in suspended animation by Morgan Le Fay in _Wonder Woman (1987)_.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Queen Atomia's eyebrows are drawn at least twice as long as those of human characters, which in addition to her long red hair, claw-like nails and—in early prints—fully green colored eyes makes her seem like a prototype Tamaranian.

-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: Pharazôn sports the kinked type that matches his Beard of Evil.
-   Spock and other Vulcans in _Star Trek_ have swooped eyebrows. Also Romulans, and the proto-Vulcan Mintakan people in the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "Who Watches the Watchers".

    Visual Novels

    -   Kirei Kotomine sports kinked variation.

-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_:
    -   Phoenix Wright himself has kinked eyebrows.
    -   Apollo Justice has fiery eyebrows. Not to mention he is fittingly red, young and passionate.

    **Yiska:** How do you do that thing with your eyebrows? Yes, that!
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ gives us Jet and his eyebrows; shaped like long, skinny tildes whose curves are slightly pointed. They're difficult to describe - you almost have to see them<small>◊</small> to believe them<small>◊</small> - and the completely unexplained contrast between him and every single other character on the show has led to his eyebrows becoming a Memetic Mutation within the fandom.
-   Mako and Lightning Bolt Zolt from _The Legend of Korra_ have fiery eyebrows.
-   _Samurai Jack_ gives us Aku, whose eyebrows aren't _just_ flaming, they are _literally_ fire. They're also apparently detachable; he keeps them in a drawer when he sleeps, and puts them on like little hats above his eyes upon awakening.
    
    **Aku:** Once upon a time, there was a little girl with an adorable red cape, and GREAT FLAAAAMING EYEBROWS who was beloved by all, and so, the people affectionately named her Little Red Hood.
    
-   _ThunderCats_:

-   Starfire from _Teen Titans_ has very strange ovals for eyebrows, as do other Tamaraneans.
-   In _Aladdin_, Jafar has...very bizarre eyebrows; they're extremely thin and arched beyond the point of belief. (Iago has nearly matching ones, which may be even weirder, because, well, _he's a parrot._)
-   Before there was _Total Drama_, there was _The Pirates of Dark Water_, with a similar array.
