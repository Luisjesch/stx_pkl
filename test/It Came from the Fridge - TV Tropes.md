_"There's something gross in the fridge today, It's green and growing hair.  
It's been there since July!  
If you can name the object in that baggie over there,  
Then mister, you're a better man than I..."_

Something hideous is lurking in the dark, eldritch depths of... your crisper drawer.

Interesting things breed in the depth of the refrigerator. Anyone who has ever had to clean one out can attest to that: foul-smelling, congealed mac 'n' cheese, shrivelled carrots and "furry" meat. The TV fridge, however, is another beast entirely. On TV, when life grows on your food, it is more than just life: it is sentient, multicellular and intelligent life. The back of your average comedy fridge is a breeding ground for all kinds of biological horrors — from oozing green slime to entire sapient races of leftover lasagna people to pasta-tentacled Eldritch Abominations. Creatures bred in the depths of an old Tupperware container make excellent Monster of the Week fodder.

Some shows may extend this trope to other flagrant displays of bad housekeeping, creating life from unwashed underwear and the dust under the bed. We honor them here as well. They obey the spirit of this trope, if not the letter. When the filth has conquered entire rooms or even the house itself, you have Trash of the Titans.

Sub-Trope of Creating Life Is Unforeseen. Contrast Empty Fridge, Empty Life. Unrelated to Fridge Horror. Not to be confused with It Came from the Sink.

    Anime & Manga 

-   While it does not produce an actual creature, Riku in _Blood+_ is traumatized by the state of the contents of the fridge at Omoro's when he, Saya, and Kai finally get back to Okinawa after an extended absence.
-   The _Cowboy Bebop_ episode "Toys in the Attic" features a crawling, slimy fridge monster born from an old fridge with a rock lobster in it that was left abandoned for so long it managed to breed complex organisms that are fast moving, aggressive, and _venomous_. The fridge was unplugged and in storage. The lesson of the story is probably the most useful ever to come from TV: Don't leave things in the fridge. The fridge returns in _Space☆Dandy_, in which the mold monster is quickly eaten by Meow. Although Ed had already done so...
    -   In a meta-variant, it turns out that according to a Forbes interview, Shinichiro Watanabe, the creator of _Cowboy Bebop_, helped Minami move at one point. He had a fridge on the property, heavily sealed with duct tape because he'd left something within and _forgot what it was._ The general consensus was that it must never be opened, and thus was born the episode.
-   In _Lucky Star_, Tsukasa once stumbles upon a more mundane example of this while looking for octopus-and-wasabi in the fridge. She finds a plastic container full of expired... _something_, which is so disgusting that it's censored. Tsukasa is horrified, noting how it's "transformed" from whatever it used to be.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Tonjit is so happy to have been knocked down from the stilts where he spent the last 10 years that he offers the Straw Hats some milk that was left in the fridge... or as he calls it, "cheese." He then promptly contracts food poisoning when he's the only one dumb enough to eat it. Possibly a joke related to how many Eastern cultures consider cheese to be Foreign Queasine.
    -   Pagaya from the Skypiea saga also has some rather extreme leftovers in his kitchen.
-   The titular moe-blob in _Potemayo_ came from the fridge, and is probably the most benign example of this trope ever written. She's more of a pet than a monster, though. Guchuko, on the other hand, is a force of raw chaos.

    Comedy 

-   George Carlin's bit on "meatcake" part of the larger bit "The Ice Box man" from the live album/live show "A Place For My Stuff".
-   Danish stand-up comedian Thomas Wivel once joked that when he was a bachelor he only opened the fridge to feed the cheese.

    Comic Books 

-   An issue of _Archie Comics_ featured a story titled "It came from... **THE CAFETERIA**" where some of Miss Beazly's leftovers get warmed by the sun and become an 8-foot tall Big Foot like creature. It goes on a rampage, falls in love with and kidnaps Big Ethel, and is ultimately blown apart by a fire hose.
-   Some _Doctor Strange_ runs claim his fridge and its inhabitants are the most dangerous thing in the whole Sanctum Sanctorum. For a subversion he actually put most of the dangerous things/beings _in_ the fridge (because strange diet choices, and spellcasting ingredients), but this doesn't mean there can't be even unexpected stuff in it as magical accidents do regularly happen around this much magic.
-   A What Could Have Been example: the very first comic-book script Neil Gaiman attempted, "The Day My Pad Went Mad", featured John Constantine (at the time busy with Alan Moore's "American Gothic" epic) returning to his flat and finding something with tentacles growing in the fridge. He and Moore agreed the ending didn't work, so it never went any further (though Moore did respect it enough to put an in-joke - "Something nasty evolving in the fridge" - in the issue immediately following "American Gothic"). Allegedly, years later Moore would ask why it never got made and when Gaiman reminded him the ending didn't work, said "Didn't it?"
-   In "It Came from Under the Sink," in _Plop!_ #7 a bachelor named Chuck Stake doesn't wash his dishes for a month or so and the scuzz mutates into a sentient yellow slime.
-   Used in one of the original _Sam & Max_ comics, where Max hosts a "science corner", where he tells the reader to put a loaf of bread on top of the fridge for a few weeks.
    
    **Max:** Eventually, it'll turn grey and taste bad! Now throw it into the street!
    
-   In the _Grossbusters_ comic in _Muppet Magazine_, Kermit sets up a business destroying garbage, and Piggy hires them to clear the mess out of her fridge, but Fozzie presses the wrong button and turns it into a Blob Monster. (A monster in the female lead's fridge is basically the one similarity this The Real Spoofbusters story has with _Ghostbusters_.)

    Comic Strips 

-   _Dilbert_: In this strip, the mold in the fridge gains sentience and gets a job at the company's Human Resources department.
-   _The Far Side_ depicted what happens "when potato salad goes bad": the bowl is pointing a pistol at a bottle and a jar which have their hands up. Why these all have hands and feet is unexplained.
-   _Garfield_ has used this trope more than once.
    -   Lethal Chef (aside from his Lasagna, of course) Jon must be using some _weird_ ingredients; one of them even held him and Odie at gunpoint.
    -   He also apparently doesn't clean the fridge out anywhere near frequently enough.
    -   The Coleslaw That Time Forgot. Deep within the frozen wastes it lurks...
    -   Cleaning out the fridge in Jon's household apparently takes some extreme measures...
        
        **Jon:** Let’s see if I have everything. Rubber gloves, trash bags, scouring pads...  
        **Garfield:** Goggles, flamethrower...
        
    -   Sometimes it produces dishonest leftovers.
    -   Sometimes it gets downright dangerous, like in this case, where a piece of mystery meat was bent on world domination, or this one, where Jon got beaten senseless when he tried to clean the fridge.
    -   And sometimes it get really out of hand with animated pieces of food waking up Garfield in the middle of the night asking for a glass of water or a story or what have you.
    -   Even professionals have trouble dealing with Jon's fridge.
        
        **Cleaner:** Mr. Arbuckle, here’s the cleaning bill for your refrigerator.  
        **Jon:** Why so much?  
        **Cleaner:** I lost two of my best men in there.
        
    -   In the October 3, 2011 strip, it's shown that the mayonnaise has not only become intelligent, it was able to send Jon a friend request on social media.
    -   The title panel of the June 22, 1986 strip has Garfield open the fridge to find a green blob with eyes and ask if the creature is the bologna or the pimento loaf.
    -   Implied in the May 16, 1998 strip.
        
        **Jon:** Nothing lasts forever.  
        **Garfield:** Except whatever is in the back of the refrigerator.
        
    -   Some of the fridge contents have apparently turned on each other.
        
        **Garfield**: The bacon is grazing on the lettuce and he asks if the refrigerator needs cleaning.
        
    -   In the August 7, 2006 strip, a horrified Jon says it's time to clean out the fridge because "the baloney is yodeling."
        
        **Garfield:** Let's wait for the olives to start blinking.
        
    -   Gocomics did a top 14 blog on the topic
-   A storyline in _Monty_, or _Robotman_ as it was still known then, had Moondog deal with this problem, as a jar of bean dip had achieved sentience and escaped from his fridge. He had seen it before but ignored it, but the situation had now turned dire as the bean dip was now "fully grown".
-   _Piranha Club_'s Lethal Chef Effie has caused this at least once.
    
    **Effie:** The problem with eight-year-old squid leftovers is you have to kill them again before you can eat them.
    
-   The rats' fridge in _Swamp_.
    
    "Careful, fridge mould can sense fear!!"
    

    Fan Works 

-   In Peter Chimaera's _DIGIMON 2: RETURN OF DIGIMON_, the titular character is ambushed during breakfast by the Evil Digimon, who leaps from the fridge. This has a bit of fridge logic to it, since Digimon's breakfast was stated to be so large, that he must have emptied half his fridge by then, making it strange that he didn't spot Evil Digimon hiding in his fridge.
-   _A Diplomatic Visit_: While the Mane Six and Spike are visiting Twilight's old tower in chapter 13, Rarity discovers a creature living in the refrigerator, behind the mayonnaise, next to the ketchup and to the left of the coleslaw. It turns out to have been created when Twilight left some old experimental potions in there not long before she and Spike went to Ponyville, and is quickly dispatched by Pinkie and a box of baking soda.
-   In the _CSI_ fic _Face The Music,_ Sara teases Brass this way about his refrigerator, referring to his 'penicillin garden'.
-   In _Harry Potter and the World that Went Bloody Insane_ Harry and Ron move into a really crappy apartment. It has a closet which they are afraid to open the door to because they're fairly certain there's something living in there.
-   In _Maybe_ Harry and George live together. Their fridge is really disgusting and Hermione makes them promise to do something about it. They end up buying a new fridge and throwing out the old one.
-   There is a _Teen Titans (2003)_ fic, "One Thing Leads to Another", where Robin is looking through the fridge: "Let's see, tofu, pudding of uncontainable joy, steak, mustard, gelatinous unidentified objects, a sock-Hey! The remote control!-mold... is that... Silkie??" Later, Alfred comes over (with Batman), and asks "Uh? Master Robin? Do you have any food that hasn't expired two months ago, isn't covered in a strange blue substance, or is an unusually large worm?"
    -   It's a stock trope in _Teen Titans_ fanfic. One had a passing mention of discovering a bronze age civilization of sentient chickpeas in said fridge.
-   _Personality Conflicts_: Referenced in _AGPD Blue_ when Parker mentions his first apartment from when he was in college, and Daystar teasingly asks if there was "mutant Chinese food in the fridge". (There wasn't - he was a frat boy and therefore lived on beer and pizza.)
-   In _Prodigy_ while cleaning his fridge James discovered a mixture of rum, yogurt and something unidentifiable. Werewolves react to it as if it were a calming potion.
-   In _Saying No_ 12 Grimmauld Place has a Bundimun in the fridge which growls at anybody who opens the door.
-   _Secundum Vita_:
    
    **Samantha:** I didn't think I had any food in the refrigerator.  
    **Hermione:** You didn't but we did find your high school science experiment in there.  
    **Harry:** After we wrestled it out we were able to banish it. It was a dirty job but someone had to do it.
    
-   The series of fan fic about Darth Maul, known as _The Sith Academy_. One of the running jokes/subplots was that use of the Dark Side always results in some visible sign of corruption for the user; for Sidious, it was his appearance, while for Maul it was his surroundings - just living in a room for a day or so could cause it to become a disaster area. There were at least two on-screen mentions (possibly three) where the contents of his fridge not only became alive and developed sentience, but actually developed whole civilizations; it was implied that this ended when he started actually cooking, in an effort to kill Sidious with cholesterol.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Alien Nation_, Sikes finds a carton of milk that definitely does not pass the sniff test for whether it is good. His partner George, however, is perfectly happy to partake of (and get drunk on) said rancid milk.
-   It wasn't caused by poor housekeeping, but _Ghostbusters (1984)_ has a demon god and hell dimension hidden in Dana Barrett's fridge. There are no cold cuts, only ZUUL!! Of course, when Venkman inspects her fridge later on, he does tease her about her eating habits.
-   _Monty Python's The Meaning of Life_ has Eric Idle suddenly step out of the refrigerator to perform the "Galaxy Song" for the lady of the house in one scene.
-   In the 2011 _The Muppets_ film, the Swedish Chef takes a flamethrower to the mold-encrusted and talking contents of his fridge that hadn't been used in years.
-   _The Naked Gun_ does a gag about this, with Lt. Drebin briefly keeling over after sniffing some three-year-old Chinese food from his fridge. If you look very closely at the very end of that scene, as the camera zooms in on Lt. Drebin's face, you can see a steak on top of the fridge... crawling on its own.
-   _A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child_ has a scene like this. After Greta has been force-fed to death in her dream, we cut to Alice going to fetch her father a drink in the fridge. When she opens it, the food rots in front of her eyes (and an eyeball even shows up on them) before her dead friend suddenly bursts out of the fridge, only to be dragged back inside by Freddy Krueger. The fridge closes, is opened again, and everything is back to normal.
-   The 2012 Philippine movie _Pridyidir_, features a haunted refrigerator that drags its unsuspecting victims inside with large nigh indestructible tentacles. As it turns out, the former owner cursed it using a blood sacrifice to store people inside due to having lost her mind to loneliness (with a little demonic possession mixed in), and to seal the deal, she committed suicide by freezing herself to death in it.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)_: After the turtles return home from the farm, Donatello inspects the fridge. After finding a pizza he pulls it out and checks it, then asks Mikey "Do you like penicillin on your pizza?" The two of them proceed to give it a military funeral.
-   _What's New Pussycat?_:
    
    **Carol:** Got something to eat?  
    **Victor:** I have some Fig Newtons, Hershey bars, some cough drops...  
    **Carol:** You have any tuna fish?  
    **Victor:** I have some salmon salad left...  
    **Carol:** What do you mean 'left', when did you make it?  
    **Victor:** In April, but if you smother it with pepper it's fine.
    

    Folklore 

-   According to Roma folk legends, watermelons and pumpkins become vampires after being kept for a certain period of time. A garden full of vampire squash shows up in _Digger_; Ursula Vernon specifically cites the legend mentioned in Folklore when they're first introduced.

    Literature 

-   In _Dave Barry's Guide to Marriage and/or Sex_ the "Realistic Weekly Household Budget for Two People" includes $30.00 for "Food that you buy and eventually eat" and $55.00 for "Food that you buy and store in the back of the refrigerator until you have to throw it out because it looks like the thing that burst out of that unfortunate man's chest and started eating the spaceship crew in the movie _Alien_."
-   The _Bone Chillers_ story, "The Thing Under the Bed". A filthy boy who treats his bedroom's luxury water-bed (a second-hand bed his parents won in a raffle two years ago, and gave it to their son) as The Pig-Pen, disposing leftover wrappers from snacks and uneaten food beneath it, found out there's _something_ living in the bed's darkest corners (what'd you expect from the title?). With some help from his bestie, they uncover a gigantic, worm-like monstrosity who then goes on a rampage across the bathroom, larder and kitchen before the boys managed to destroy the monster via the kitchen sink's waste disposal. It turns out the water-bed's former owner is a Mad Scientist experimenting on mutating worms - the protagonist disposing trash under his bed for two years unintentionally fed the worm allowing it to grow to a gigantic form. Moral of the Story: Do not accept water-beds from strangers, else you'll be devoured by mutated worms.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _Hogfather_, Susan Sto-Helit conducts a forensic examination of the contents of a bag left hanging outside the window in winter (Discworld's low-tech, cut-rate version of refrigeration — also surprisingly popular with British university students). "Now look at this. Leathery bacon, green bread, and a piece of cheese you could shave. She hasn't been here in some time, believe me."
    -   As with so many other tropes, this one is represented multiple times in Discworld stories. For instance, in _Witches Abroad_, Granny Weatherwax visits a neglected old granny (not a witch) and finds some milk in her kitchen that "ought to be allowed to vote." And in _Small Gods,_ Om makes a similar comment about milk served in a philosophers' bar.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_, the group cleans out the Black house, finding all sorts of crazy creatures in the house, including a boggart in a writing desk that turns into the corpses of Harry and the Weasley family, robes that tried to strangle Ron, and a locket with a piece of Voldemort's soul.
-   In somewhat of a subversion, in a later _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ sequel, Arthur Dent eats the least hairy things in his fridge after returning to Earth after a long expedition in space, unknowingly curing himself of a disease which would have otherwise wiped out half a hemisphere.
-   Douglas Adams' novel _The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul_ is a rare example where it plays into the main plot. It eats The Man Behind the Man. It was not exactly food, but a god born of Gently's guilt.
    -   The entire story maintains a subplot of Gently playing a game of chicken with his maid, both trying to trick each other into opening the fridge first. Gently leaves classic "door left unopened" clues such as a hair stuck in the door while his maid messes with those to pretend she _did_ open it so he would open it and check if anything was moved around.
-   One of the most fondly remembered chapters in the _molesworth_ books is "The Prunes are Revolting!”, in which the prunes served at the school rise up and defy the pupils and staff in a campaign styled on British accounts of the Indian Mutiny. This was more of a comment on the taste of school dinners in British schools at the time of writing than on their state of preservation, though.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The first episode of the 1983 British sketch show _Alfresco_ has a song about a couple who are so lazy they haven't cleaned the house for decades and there are alien lifeforms in possession of the fridge and kitchen. Never mind - the house is on fire so all they have to do is wait and their problems will all be over.
-   _All That_ had a sketch in a parody of B-Horror movies and crime shows where the "father" went for a midnight snack. cuts to a chalk outline with weird gunk, the police quizzing when the meatloaf was last served (four different answers) while an ambulance wails. When one of the family asked about it, the cop said they didn't call, and went to investigate. Open the closet, and the father is making the sounds - implying that the _Meatloaf ate his brain_.
-   _Attack of the Show!_: In "Wonder Woman's Guide to Office Safety", Cheetah emerges from a refrigerator after being formed from an old lunch containing correct chemical components essential to creating her.
-   _Black Books_ has more than one example. When they call a cleaner (after a scene of Bernard: "I was gonna warm it \[a frozen pizza\] and eat it later. Everybody does that, that's normal! You are looking for things to complain about!" Manny: "What do you call these?" Bernard: "Wasps!"), he does the trick of putting on a white glove, streaking it across something, and the fingertip comes away black. The thing he chooses to sweep across? The air.
-   _Bottom_: Yoghurt that needs a shave, a sausage that's already been digested, solid milk...
-   In an episode of _The Brady Bunch_, Greg and Alice stumble upon some leftovers in the fridge. Greg gets a whiff, asks what it is and Alice says "it's been left over so long I forgot!"
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Olivia looking in Giles' fridge: "Rupert, is this bleu cheese, or cheese that's gone blue?"
-   In one episode of _Chuck_, the entire workforce at the BuyMore watched Morgan eat some brown goo out of a Tupperware container from the "Mystery Crisper".
-   An unusual example in _The Cosby Show_. Cliff has a late night snack-fueled nightmare involving The Muppets. Cliff opens the fridge and Muppet food snarks at him over his eating habits, which becomes a Brick Joke at the end of the episode.
-   _CSI_'s Gil Grissom also keeps experimental human body parts in the communal refrigerator designated for food.
-   _Even Stevens_ did this twice, although not really in the fridge for both examples. One was some old food under Louis' bed which mutated badly enough to have to call in a hazmat crew. Another was an old sandwich in his locker which was alive and fierce enough to shred the tennis racket Louis tried to scoop it out with.
-   On _Friends_, Joey is cleaning out his broken fridge (which means eating everything in it), which prompts this exchange:
    
    **Joey:** Hey, what was in that brown jar?  
    **Chandler:** That's still in there?  
    **Joey:** Not anymore.
    
-   _Good Bones_:
    -   In the first episode, Mina and Karen find an old chest freezer in the basement of the fire-damaged house that they purchased to renovate and sell. Unfortunately, the freezer has been sitting without power for 6 months and when the demo team opens it, they find meat and other food still left inside and rotting. The freezer then gets tossed into the dumpster with the debris from demolition.
    -   They find an actual old fridge full of rotten food in another house that Mina purchased in the seventh episode; the smell is bad enough to cause them to run out.
    -   Yet another fridge filled with old food is found in a house in the season 3 premiere, with Karen mentioning that she saw a banana peel in it in addition to expired leftovers.
-   _Good Eats_:
    -   Subverted; some episodes feature the lovely "Lady of the Refrigerator", who dispenses nutritional information about the featured food. That said, he does occasionally get into arguments with his foodstuffs.
    -   Played more straight with the Refrigerator Gnome, who is more obnoxious than deadly. Mainly by explaining things Alton already knows.
-   _Hoarders_ - Some Hoarders kept food way after it expired.
-   The filthy fridge is a staple of bar- and restaurant-based reality shows, including but not limited to _Kitchen Nightmares_, _Bar Rescue_ and _Restaurant: Impossible_. The establishments routinely have boxes upon boxes of spoiled, moldy food that the appalled host orders thrown out.
-   Throughout the duration of _Malcolm in the Middle_, countless times it has been shown that there can be some truly horrid, awful things hiding in the back of the family's fridge. Memorably was a pre-title-sequence clip showing a piece of fruit being placed in the fridge by Lois, who declared the family would be 'eating healthy from now on.' Over time the orange is ignored by all members of the family and slowly decays into a brown lump, no longer recognizable as an orange.... to the point where Hal picks it up and says with delight 'Ooh, a brownie!'
    -   Once more, when Reese and Malcolm are shown having a competition to see who can eat the most expired perishables.
        
        **Reese:** When was the last time we had egg nog?  
        **Malcolm:** I think before Dewey was born.
        
    -   And again, when Francis tricks Dewey into drinking the filthy liquid that has accumulated in the drip tray.
    -   In The Teaser of another episode, Lois is shown serving a "leftover parfait" for dinner, which is made from all the crap she cleans out of the fridge that week that _doesn't_ have something growing on it.
        
        **Reese:** Did we have spaghetti or Chinese food on Thursday?  
        **Dewey:** Neither.
        
    -   Another had Hal and Reese trying to figure out what's causing a horrible smell in the fridge. They go through rotten cheese, bacon, and finally a carton of milk with a dead rat inside, presumably the school rat Dewey was supposed to take care of last summer. Still not it.
-   In an episode of _Married... with Children_, metal band Anthrax is snowed in at the Bundy's house. Desperate for food, they eat "Mom's mystery pack", a foil-wrapped substance that apparently not even Al will touch. It's described as moving and hot (despite being in a refrigerator), and causes hallucinations among the band, and later on sings along with Edd "Kookie" Byrnes.
-   In the original version of _The Muppet Show_, Gonzo goes to Special Guest John Denver for help, saying he thinks his mold garden is plotting against him. He claims the talking, mobile fungus appeared because he forgot to clean his refrigerator before going on vacation, and the moldy food that resulted was "too cute to throw away". (Then the fungus appears, telling him they need the refrigerator light replaced, again, because "we were playing puffball and Reggie hit a _long_ one.")
-   One (minor) plot point that remains intriguingly unresolved in quirky UK soap _Night and Day_ is the significance of the Harpers’ large, noisy and somewhat sinister black refrigerator. Actually pictured on _publicity photos_ for the show along with the human members of the family, the tombstone-like appliance was heard by Natalie on one occasion to say the word ‘dead’ repeatedly, and administered her an electric shock on another. It’s no wonder that, towards the end of the series, Natalie resolved to donate the monstrosity to Roxanne, warning her ominously to look after it.
-   The US version of _The Office (US)_ has an episode in which Kevin is drinking milk that Andy left in the fridge because hey, free milk. The problem is that Andy's been gone for months, and Kevin's drinking just a sip each day. When Andy comes back, Kevin mourns "I guess it's goodbye chunky lemon milk." No one actually comments that the milk is alive, but it definitely _contains_ something living (the souring and clumping are due to organic acids produced by bacteria such as _Lactobacillus acidophilus_).
-   There's a variation/parody in _Paul Merton: The Series_: in one of his comedic monologues, he explains that he lives across the street from a prison, and one of the inmates has made a tunnel to the back of his fridge, and he's kept up at night by the sound of prisoners escaping out of his fridge. In a later comedic monologue, he says that he is frequently visited by beings from outer space and tells the story of how a blob showed up on his doorstep and started telling him that it could show him things beyond his wildest imaginings before exclaiming "Blimey! You've got prisoners jumping out of your fridge!"
-   _Red Dwarf_
    -   There is the "curry monster," created from some old vindaloo.
    -   In the novelization Lister realizes he's actually in a computer simulation when he looks in his fridge and it's _not_ a grotesque chamber of horrors.
    -   When Kryten is first introduced, he cleans up Lister's room in an attempt to do him a favour. Lister is horrified; Kryten has thrown out his pet mould. "His name was Albert! I was tryin' to get 'im two foot high!"
    -   A later novel has him trapped in Cyberhell, where everything is designed to be as unpleasant as possible. When he opens the fridge, there's milk struggling to climb out of the carton, the veg has rotted into greeny-brown slime and the smell is indescribable. He thinks,'By my standards, this is actually pretty tidy'.
    -   In one episode, Kryten performs an internal scan of Starbug and detects two pieces of Bombay Aloo Lister dropped down a service duct several millennia earlier. They have since evolved a rudimentary intelligence and formed a progressive folk duo.
-   There was a brilliant running gag in one episode of _Roseanne_ involving a carton of milk that's been left in the fridge too long.
-   _Seriously Weird_: In "When Yoghurt Attacks", Harris has a yoghurt which goes weird. The yoghurt then starts attacking people and hamsters. Harris's friends think that the attacks are done by Harris 'coz hes always in the place where the attacks are. They soon find out that it is the yoghurt doing the attacking and they kill it by blending it and putting it in the microwave.
-   _Sherlock_: Holmes is exactly the one who cannot surprise the viewer (or his flatmate) by storing a human head in the refrigerator and eyeballs in the microwave.
-   The great Mini Me episode of _Stargate SG-1_:
    
    **Teal'c:** Are you conducting some sort of scientific experiment, O'Neill?  
    **Young!Jack:** Hey! That salsa's still good!
    
-   Referenced in the Trickster episode from season 2 of _Supernatural_:
    
    **Dean:** What's wrong with my food?  
    **Sam:** It's not food anymore, Dean! It's **Darwinism!**
    
-   Several points in _The Young Ones_ reference dirty laundry or unwashed dishes acting sentient. The line that sums it up best is "Guys! Guys! One of Vyvyan's socks has escaped!"
    -   Also: "What's Domestos?"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   At one point, the spoiled foods in the fridge have a bit scene of their own, complete with a solo song by a moldy tomato.

    Music 

-   A more hygenic variant is the Barry Louis Polisar song, "When The House Is Dark And Quiet", in which two bratty kids play tricks on their babysitter. One involves stuffing a (live) cat in the fridge when they know the sitter is about to get a snack, so it can jump out at her.

    -   "Trash Day" goes quite over-the-top in places, but is not as memorable.
-   A little monster appears from out of a person's TV dinner in the video for ZZ Top's "TV Dinners" to wreak havoc.

    Puppet Shows 

-   On _Dinosaurs_, the Sinclair children are held hostage by food that has gone bad - that is, food that has rebelled and formed a resistance movement.

        **Clutter:** I have not.  
        **Fox:** See? Two against one.
        
-   _General Protection Fault_ has two characters who are sentient slime molds.

    Real Life 

-   This office fridge sat for a few months unplugged (that being the operative word) and stuffed full of leftovers; when someone finally opened it and started cleaning it out, the food reacted with cleaning agents creating poisonous fumes that sickened twenty-eight people and sent seven to the hospital. They had to call in a _hazmat team_ to finish the job.
-   After Hurricane Katrina flooded parts of New Orleans, many people returned home weeks or months later and, if they were cautious or forewarned, duct-taped their fridges shut without opening them and put them on the curb to be picked up. The other wiki's article on the topic says that the contents of the fridges could be toxic enough to melt plastic and corrode metal. At least one book of photos has been published of (thankfully just the exteriors of) Katrina fridges, since many of them became temporary graffiti attractors and items of folk art. In the New Orleans episode of _No Reservations_, there's footage of someone cleaning out a walk-in freezer after returning from Katrina. Imagine the above, _but room-sized._
-   Travis Willingham once reached into his fridge and pulled out some pudding, stuck a spoon in it, and tried eating it. It was crunchy, so he turned on the light to see why, since he didn't recall buying tapioca pudding. It _wasn't_ tapioca; once upon a time it was _chocolate_. Travis now checks his pudding before he eats it.
-   Historic example from the days before fridges: an entire American village once decided to pool milk from all the cows in town to make a giant wheel of cheese for Thomas Jefferson. The resulting cheese took weeks to transport, and reportedly by the time it arrived, it was "strong enough to walk there by itself." (The cheese was said to be quite good, though, and lasted over a year.)
-   Kefir, a dairy product derived from granular lumps like those of cottage cheese, contains a diverse assortment of bacterial and fungal life. Left to ferment in milk, kefir grains will grow, then divide like living cells, of their own accord.
-   The globule of biomatter containing the symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (affectionately called a "SCOBY" or "pellicle") used in brewing kombucha (fermented tea), which resembles a large grey booger, moves around in the fermenting vat to the point that it occasionally _attempts escape._ Some home-brewers even grow attached to and name their scoby pellicles. When put up for storage in a "hotel," the resultant blob looks like nothing so much as a sample of Zerg creep.
-   There's a carton of milk, simply referred to as the Milk, that's been sitting around the MIT for _three decades_. At this point, it's a brown-ish fluid that may or may not be so toxic _not even microorganisms live in there anymore_.
