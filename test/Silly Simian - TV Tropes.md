He may be an ape, but he sure is making a monkey out of himself.

_"More fun than a barrel of monkeys!"_

— **Old proverb**, setting the bar impossibly high

Some people find apes, monkeys, and lemurs inherently amusing. Perhaps it's the fact that they mirror humanity so closely while still maintaining the visage of a wild animal, perhaps it's just easier to anthropomorphize them, or maybe people just like poop-tossing jokes? Whatever the reason, there's a cyclic period of people being fascinated by primates that always seems to take the world of fiction by storm.

This has long been noted by comic book authors, who, during the Silver Age, took every opportunity to insert, turn people into, or otherwise add gorillas to a superhero story. (In fact, DC Comics had a policy at the time limiting the number of "monkey" issues per month, to prevent everybody from doing it.) The use of primates as a source of humor has also been associated at times with the tastes of the Lowest Common Denominator, who view the ultimate form of entertainment as a top-hat-wearing, diaper-wearing, cigar-smoking chimp riding a tricycle.

One consequence of this trope is the tendency in media to refer to great apes like gorillas or chimpanzees as monkeys, as even though they're technically not monkeys in the popular sense, the word "monkey" is simply funnier. It should be noted that apes are cladistically a specific _type_ of monkey - they are the sister group of the Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade of simian primates. In other words, apes (including humans) are more closely-related by descent to Old World monkeys than Old World monkeys are to New World ones, so any use of "monkey" to include Old World and New World monkeys but exclude apes is paraphyletic and arbitrary from a scientific perspective. Some Talking Animal works make light of this distinction by having a great ape be called a "monkey", only to either correct whomever called them that or to take offense (such as, for instance, a certain librarian or an expectant chimpanzee father). By logical extension, this trope also extends to prosimians (a term traditionally used for primates that aren't monkeys _or_ apes, e.g. lemurs such as King Julien) being employed for comedy, despite not being technically monkeys in the _cladistic_ sense.

The image of the peaceful, childlike, and funny caveman, usually a member of the Neanderthal species, technically belongs in this trope. For that matter, one _could_ say a cast of comedic humans or extinct hominids qualifies, but this trope tends to focus on non-_Homo_ primates.

See also Apes in Space, Killer Space Monkey, Maniac Monkeys, Mischief-Making Monkey, Monkeys on a Typewriter, Sea Aping and Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot (which invokes this trope quite often); also check out Quacking Up and Goofy Feathered Dinosaur for the equivalents of this trope for avians and kin. See Cymbal-Banging Monkey for a common exception to this trope. For more mythically mysterious monkey-ish beings, see Bigfoot, Sasquatch, and Yeti.

    Advertising 

-   In the The '90s, on French TV, there was a series of very popular commercials for laundry product OMO starring actual chimpanzees in human clothing and "speaking" in silly words, enacting stereotypical ads where they get clothing dirty and have them clean again with OMO. The commercials were popular enough to increase sales of the product by 25%.
-   According to panelists from _The Gruen Transfer_, it's something of an industry in-joke to do an ad with a monkey in it.
-   A very well-known series of adverts for PG Tips Tea in Britain involved a group of trained chimpanzees who acted in the roles of a suburban family, with dubbed voices. Despite their popularity, these were axed in the 1990s over fears of animal cruelty allegations. They have since been replaced with the sock monkey (or _Muuuuun-keigh!_ as Johnny Vegas pronounces it) inherited from ITV Digital, allowing a thematic continuation.
-   The latter arises from a series of adverts by Vegas (playing a character called Al) and the Muuuunkeigh for ITV Digital, which went under despite giving away free sock monkeys with every subscription (some people signed up purely for that reason). The Al-Muuunkeigh combo was briefly transferred to The BBC for Comic Relief, then bought by PG Tips.

-   There's something inherently hilarious about a belligerent gorilla swinging a sleeping man around by his hair in this classic Wella Shock Waves ad from The '90s.

-   A Dodge Automobile commercial advertising a new sale has Michael C Hall say, "This event could not be more amazing. Oh, wait, there's a monkey." Cue a small chimpanzee dressed like Evel Knievel walking into the lot and pushing down on a plunger that blasts a small amount of confetti. Hall then says, "I stand corrected." In response to PETA's complaints about using a monkey, Chrysler produced another commercial that was almost exactly like the first one — but now with an invisible monkey. "Unbelievable."

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _3000 Leagues in Search of Mother_, Marco's older brother Tonio gives him a white and tiny pet monkey named Amedio before he leaves to Argentina. Amedio's antics tend to add comedy to a rather melodramatic story.
-   In _Animal Crossing: The Movie_, Cesar the gorilla and Champ the monkey are the resident non-human primate villagers. Cesar is a cranky villager who serves as a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, while Champ is a jock villager who's always seen exercising. Both of them provide comedic relief through the story.
-   In _Ask Dr. Rin!_, one of their four Ridiculously Cute Critters is Tenshin, a monkey that does nothing but squawk and eat candy, but due to being something of a mascot for the series, gets a lot of screentime.
-   _Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan_ has a student transformed into a recurring monkey. Said monkey's head was made using stock real life photos.
-   _Buster Keel!_ has Keel, a Dragon Ape, stuck in human form.
-   _Cromartie High School_ has a gorilla who frequently shows up at the school, and is said to be smarter than many of the delinquents who go there (which isn't that hard to believe when you see the rest of the cast).
-   _Digimon Adventure_:
    -   Etemon, the comedic "breather" (well, not really) villain.
    -   Other ape Digimon include Apemon and Gorillamon.
-   _Dragon Ball_'s protagonist Goku has a monkey-like tail, and turns into the Oozaru, a giant were-monkey, when he looks at the full moon. He shares these traits with his entire race, the Saiyans. Though in this case, everything is _not_ better with monkeys: Goku and his son Gohan turn completely feral and lose control when they turn into Oozarus, and while Vegeta can remain in control in Oozaru form, he's still evil (and by the time he makes his Heel–Face Turn he's lost his tail, and with it the ability to go Oozaru).
-   _Eyeshield 21_ has one of the main characters, Raimon Tarou, follow a monkey motif. This includes adhering to stereotypical monkey traits such as running on all fours, climbing high trees, handling objects with his feet(he caught the football with his feet in a dream, and main character Sena _actually believed it was Raimon's new technique_), and snacking on bananas, his favorite food. He even cries "Mukyaa!", which in Japanese is a monkey's cry. Despite all this, he still gets incredibly offended when someone calls him a monkey.
    -   In a poll for the manga, he won over a real monkey for "most monkey-like".
-   _Get Backers_ has monkeys popping up in the two Hot Springs Episodes and breaking havoc on the cast.
-   In _Gintama_, the author of the manga Gintaman is revealed to be an ordinary gorilla. The Author Avatar later ends up being a humanized gorilla, and Kondo, who has the nickname of "Gorilla", ends up being transformed into one in a particular story arc.
    -   In one arc, the Yorozuya gang and others decide to play a MMORPG called Monkey Hunter in an attempt to gather some information on some aliens who had them unwillingly modified into screwdrivers. The game is essentially the same as what it's a parody of, just with nothing but giant monkeys as the enemies.
    -   Another arc has Kyubey tasked with watching over a pet monkey, whom she proceeds to give an Overly Long Name.
-   In a _Naruto_ filler arc, Kakashi placed a genjutsu on a bunch of monkeys so they would look like his team, confusing his tail. Apparently said tail found monkeys highly entertaining, as it took him half an hour to figure out they weren't human.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ episode _1 Angry Ghost_ has an Ace Attorney monkey.
-   In _Saint Seiya_ Shaka is prone to make monkey jokes at the expense of his enemies. Some actually laughed at them.
-   _SD Gundam World Heroes_ has main protagonist Wukong Impulse Gundam, who’s based on the classic monkey-themed legendary figure, Sun Wukong. There’s also his Gouen Form, although that form is the exact opposite of this trope.
-   _Slam Dunk_: No actual monkeys in the show, but the main character Sakuragi is described as a "redheaded monkey" and Akagi's nickname is literally "Gori" (short for Gorilla). In fact, any excessively big and manly guy is referred to as a gorilla. Whenever Shohoku is chibified, they're usually portrayed as monkeys being led by a gorilla (except Rukawa whose a fox). From different teams we have Kyota, an equally Hot-Blooded rival, that is called "Wild Monkey" while Akagi's rival, Uozomi (who also has big stature), is nicknamed "Boss Monkey".
-   _Space☆Dandy_: Dr. Gel appears to be a giant bearded gorilla who wears a G-shaped monocle (or possibly an eyepatch) and periwig. He is the series' Butt-Monkey in an almost meta sense, and on at least one occasion, the series uses him as a joke because of his animalistic nature.
-   _Speed Racer_ has the Team Pet Chim-Chim. The movie had not one but two chimps taking turns playing Chim-Chim. Whenever either one of them was on screen, they threw shit, and also got behind the wheel of a vehicle.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   "Do the words 'robot monkey' mean anything to you?"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ had one episode featuring an experimental dueling monkey with a monkey deck. In the dub he's named Wheeler as a callback joke to a comment Kaiba made in the original series about Joey being a "dueling monkey".
    -   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_, the Dark Signer Demak had the Dark Signer Birthmark of the Monkey, his Deck had monsters that were primarily Monkeys/Apes... and, of course, Earthbound Immortal Cusillu.

    Comedy 

-   One of Dane Cook's stand up routines includes a tangent about how awesome monkeys are. He claims having a pet monkey would be Better than Sex, or being a part of a heist... with the monkey driving the van.
-   Monkeys are a fairly common theme in Ross Noble's comedy as well, particularly on his 'Unrealtime' DVD.
-   Nick Swardson tells a story in _Seriously, Who Farted?!!_ about how he ended up giving $300 (mostly in small bills) to a monkey in Las Vegas who gives high fives. He was drunk at the time but still...

    Comic Books 

-   Many, many superheroes and supervillains in American comic books are intelligent apes of some sort, most of which created during The Silver Age of Comic Books, when sci-fi stories featuring gorillas in the covers were thought to sell better. Notables include:
    -   Congorilla: Sacred golden gorilla who serves as the alter ego of Congo Bill, a British adventurer, courtesy of mind-swapping rings.
    -   Detective Chimp: Exactly What It Says on the Tin. A member of Shadowpact, Bobo T. Chimpanzee would like to remind you that Batman is merely the World's Greatest _Human_ Detective.
    -   Gorilla Grodd: Psychic would-be world conqueror from a hidden city of superintelligent gorillas. Gorilla City's actually kind of a big deal in DC; King Solovar was an important figure in the _original_ Crisis Crossover.
        -   Voiced in _Blackest Night_ with an undead Solovar:
            
            **Professor Zoom**: You know what makes **everything** better?! GORILLAS!
            
    -   The Mod Gorilla Boss: He's one hip swinger, Clyde, and you'd better believe that he's the big man behind the criminal underworld in Bludhaven. And that he thinks vertical stripes are cool.
    -   _Doom Patrol_ villain Monsieur Mallah: Superintelligent machine-gun-toting communist revolutionary homosexual French-speaking gorilla surgeon in love with a (male) Brain in a Jar. Yes, really (it might help explain things to know he was first created in the Silver Age — and then Grant Morrison came along).
    -   Sam Simeon: Comic artist and half of _Angel and the Ape_. No points for guessing which half.
    -   Titano: Giant chimp with kryptonite-laser-shooting eyes.
    -   The Ultra-Humanite: Psychic Mad Scientist who had his brain surgically placed in a mutant gorilla's body.
    -   Arkhampedia has an article on the subject.
    -   Primaul: An intelligent vampire ape with fascist leanings. Which is to say, he's a Nazi. His real name is Julius, as a Shout-Out to Julie Schwartz.
    -   Beppo the Super-Monkey, who is a Kryptonian monkey who is super.
    -   In his first appearance, Brainiac of all people had a pet white space monkey named Koko. Many years later, as a Mythology Gag referencing this, Brainiac Five got a pet albino monkey named Koko.
    -   In _Wonder Woman (2006)_ Gorilla Knights, including Tolifhar, Rhanda and Mirada, ally themselves with Diana after being banished from Gorilla City for what they did under Grodd's sway.

Note that _all_ the above examples are from DC Comics. Around 1940, DC fell head-over-heels in love with gorillas and has never recovered.

-   Marvel has at least one example of its own: Gorilla Man, a soldier of fortune who got turned into an immortal gorilla.
    -   And a different Gorilla Man, who has a human head and a gorilla's body. While he's technically a scientist, he's rarely portrayed as anything but the dumbest, most single-minded thug scientist ever.
    -   Not to mention how Beast's original thing was his incredibly simian physique, causing him to look like a shaved gorilla. Then he became something akin to a blue-furred gorilla with a bizarre Wolverine-ish hairdo. Later he lost the gorilla-like traits to become cat-like, though.
    -   And the Red Ghost's super-apes; a gorilla with Super-Strength, an orangutan with Voluntary Shapeshifting, and a Gravity Master mandrill. They all gained their powers (as did the Red Ghost, who gained Intangibility) from the same cosmic ray storm that gave the _Fantastic Four_ their powers.
    -   And there is also Initiative member Gorilla Girl, The Gibbon, Gorr the Golden Gorilla, and the Beasts of Berlin.
    -   Julius Schwartz was parodied in _J2_ by the gangster-turned-talking gorilla Big Julie.
    -   This doesn't apply to _every_ ape, though; Giant monster-turned-regular-sized-monster Gorgilla is actually kind of a loser, like the rest of his teammates in the Fin Fang Four. And Moon Boy (of _and Devil Dinosaur_ fame) is just too goofy to be cool. It's not entirely clear exactly what Moon Boy is, but at one point he's believed to be an example of _Homo habilis_ (an early human species from back when humans were much more ape-like).
    -   Then there's the Hit-Monkey, which is basically what it sounds like, a Noble Demon hitman monkey with the ability to shoot with his feet and only kills hitmen, mercs, and other crooked types. First showed up in the pages of Deadpool, where he chased after the Merc with a Mouth.
        
        "Let's be clear: HITMAN MONKEY is the harrowing tale of a Macaque monkey from the mountains of Japan who, though fate and circumstance, is transformed into the world's deadliest assassin," \[Axel\] Alonso continues. "I fail to see what could be funny about-oh. I see your point."
        
    -   The original Squadron Supreme (a team of JLA Expies from an alternate universe) have an expy of Gorilla Grodd in their rogues gallery: a female cyborg ape named Ape-X (like "Apex").
-   Nearly every superhero during the Silver Age was turned into a gorilla, at one time or another. The best way to tell if someone's doing an homage or Affectionate Parody of the Silver Age is to see if there are any gorillas around.
    -   Legend has it that this trend began when a DC Comics executive noticed sales spikes during months where monkeys and/or apes were on the cover. Whether or not this is true is unknown, but Peter David, in the same foreword on the quotes page, insists that it's true, and even names the exec: Julius Schwartz, creator of Barry Allen and Hal Jordan, among others.
        -   Of course, this all culminated in the crossover _JLApe: Gorilla Warfare!_, where the entire Justice League were turned into gorillas, even in their own comics. Before you ask, it was actually in the late nineties. Also, it turns out that red-haired and blond gorillas (such as the ape versions of the Flash and Aquaman, respectively), are really weird looking.
        -   Later mimicked by _Marvel Apes_, an alternate universe where everyone is a monkey except the Inhumans and Sue Storm. (Note that the _Marvel Apes_ version of Spider-Man, who has a tail, is not an ape, but a spider monkey. He actually calls himself "Spider-Monkey".)
        -   DC eventually got their own JLApe universe in _Dark Nights: Metal_.
-   _Ambush Bug: Year None_ # 5: "Apes on covers sell comics. Apes on covers sell comics. Apes on covers..."
-   A particularly long-running take on the above occurred in the Eclipse comic _Zot!_. Due to an early run-in with a deevolutionary cult, one of the characters turned into a chimpanzee every time he visited the alternate earth of the titular character. He didn't mind as much as you'd think.
-   From the _New Crusaders_ we have a talking alien chimp named "Dusty", a.k.a. Uruk Ak'hak.
-   The third collection of _The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius_, "Monkey Tales," involves: a superintelligent other-dimensional gorilla, a tribe of sasquatch, and a hyper-Ebola monkey. (That's three separate stories, mind.) In the fourth collection, "Gorilla Warfare," the characters travel to the dimension the superintelligent gorilla came from, where he (the gorilla) is worshiped as a god.
-   Chris Sims' _Exterminape_ is a tongue-in-cheek example, where the main character is a talking gorilla who discovered firearms shortly after learning how to use simple tools and quickly became a badass assassin who likes to show human women his "jungle love".
-   The graphic novel _Grease Monkey_ features biologically uplifted gorillas working on a space station, undergoing preparations for an alien invasion.
-   Mike Mignola, creator of _Hellboy_, has admitted he likes drawing monkeys. Especially gorillas with bolts in their neck, which is why Hermann von Klempt has a series of enhanced gorillas ("Kriegaffen", or "war apes") as aides. In addition, Count Guarino is turned into a chimpanzee during "Box Full of Evil". A monkey that carries a pistol and tortures Abe with a burning poker.
    -   "Is that a monkey?" "He's got a gun!" \*BLAM BLAM\*
    -   The comic book series _Proof_ about a Bigfoot who is a paranormal investigator is just "Hellboy AS A MONKEY!"
-   In _I Feel Sick_ by Jhonen Vasquez, the main character Devi, an artist who is working on cover art for a book, is instructed to put a monkey on the cover. The book in question features no monkeys, it is about children who get evil powers from gnawing on contaminated aluminum siding, but research shows that people love monkeys and a monkey on the cover will just about double sales.
-   Mega City One in _Judge Dredd_ has a simian ethnic enclave (named Apetown), and an Orangutan named Dave was once elected Mayor of the city. He ended up being assassinated.
-   Matt Fraction's _Mantooth_ is about a super-spy gorilla who's a super-smooth ladies man.
-   _The Savage Dragon_ features Brainiape, an evil gorilla with a Brain in a Jar attached to his head. That has Psychic Powers. A crossover with the aforementioned _Hellboy_ revealed that the brain in Brainiape was... Well, given that Hellboy was in it, Take a wild guess.
-   Squirrel Girl thinks that everything is better with monkeys.
-   In _The Umbrella Academy_, one of Reginald Hargreeves' inventions was a way to give chimpanzees sentience. They show up everywhere as detectives, soliders, hobos and even one hooker. One of these intelligent chimps is Hargreeves' assistant, Pogo. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _The Filth_ has Dmitri, a talking chimp who also happens to be a Soviet assassin. He offed JFK.
-   In _Secret Six_, Ragdoll used some of his mercenary money to buy "a monkey house and a variety of little monkey outfits" for his monkeys. He dressed them up as his team members, covered himself with monkey chow and giggled as they attacked him.<small>◊</small> It was unsettling and hilarious.
-   Gaston Lagaffe once gave Fantasio (of _Spirou & Fantasio_) three circus-trained chimpanzees as a birthday present. They proceed to wreak havoc in his office.
-   _Monkeyman and O'Brien_ is about an intelligent gorilla from another dimension.
-   The Norts in _Rogue Trooper_ once attempted to counter the Southers' GIs with part-human-part-gorillas, who like the GIs could breathe the atmosphere of Nu Earth. They failed when Rogue beat their leader in one-on-one combat, becoming the new commander and persuading them to rebel against their evil masters.
-   The megalomanical Doctor Vulter is the villain of the early Mickey Mouse story _Mickey Mouse and the Pirate Submarine_, a Captain Nemo Expy Mad Scientist with a High-Class Glass and a penchant for Putting on the Reich (well, it _was_ published in 1936...). He has returned in European Disney Comics several times since then, and has been a Funny Animal gorilla since the beginning.
-   In _Requiem Vampire Knight_, Thurim's sex life gets better with gori-mandrills! For those thoroughly squicked: Aiwass actually turns back to her true vampire babe form to do the deed... and if _this_ repels you, what are you doing reading _Requiem_ in the first place?

-   In _All Fall Down_, the shape-shifter, Phylum, spends the book as a chimpanzee as a result of losing his powers.
-   In _The Multiversity_, Nix Uotan is assisted by Mr. Stubbs, a buccaneer monkey.
-   _Jo, Zette and Jocko_: Jocko is the children's pet chimpansee and he always gets caught up in mischievous adventures.
-   _Jommeke_: Choco is the pet chimpanzee of Annemieke and Rozemieke.
-   _Astro City_ has Sticks, an intelligent gorilla who abandoned his militaristic gorilla nation to pursue a dream of becoming a rock drummer. Regarding Sticks' first appearance, Kurt Busiek commented, "I've always said that a superhero universe that doesn't have talking gorillas in it simply isn't finished yet, so it's good to get such an essential element established here, after almost twenty years."
-   The titular character of _The Chimp With The Brown Hat_ is a chimpanzee with a brown hat and a robotic arm traveling through The Wild West.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Liberty Meadows_' artist Frank Cho chooses to depict himself as a chimpanzee. Trope referenced directly in this comic.
-   German comic _Nick Knatterton_ has one story about two chimps who were taught to steal. One of them ends up as Nick's "housemaid", having learned to do that job.
-   Monkeys are a recurring topic in _Get Fuzzy_, being a particular obsession of Bucky Katt. Specifically, he wants to eat one.
-   _Dilbert_ has Zimbu the monkey, who can speak English and does a good job of making Dilbert look like an inferior worker.
-   _Pearls Before Swine_ often features them. Stephan Pastis even says that if you can't make a monkey joke funny, it's time to retire.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Second Try_: Subverted. Aki thought that monkeys were cute and funny. So did their parents... until three monkeys tried to kidnap their daughter.
-   _Ripples in the Pond_: After King Kong, a vervet monkey, beats up Fullbody, Evan decides to take him along as his partner and convince Luffy to let him join the Straw Hats.
-   _Becoming a True Invader_:
    -   For some reason, the loading screen on Zim's computers features a monkey eating berries.
    -   The Heboadians look like cyborg monkeys.
    -   A monkey appears from the portal in Dib's head on Heboad, and proceeds to take over flying the Dibship. It later turns out to be the Alternate Universe Keef's partner.

    Films — Animation 

-   The Disney Animated Canon has a couple examples as well:
    -   _Aladdin_ had Abu as Aladdin's mischievious Non-Human Sidekick.
    -   _Tarzan_ was based on _Tarzan of the Apes_, but Disney did work the monkey trope into a wacky lather in the film, particularly with Tarzan's loud-mouthed female gorilla sidekick Terk, her not-too-bright buddies Flynt and Mungo, and the mischievous baby baboon Manu. On the other hand, some primate characters are completely serious (i.e. Kerchak, the stern silverback and Kala, Tarzan's loving foster mother) or are more threatening than funny (the baboon horde).
    -   _The Lion King_ had the shaman-type, Rafiki, who was an African vision-having kung-fu mandrill. He provides both comic relief and wise advice as an Eccentric Mentor.
    -   King Louie, an eccentric musical orangutan from _The Jungle Book_ was Disney's original addition to the movie, yet arguably, feels very much as if he belongs to Mowgli's world. The original book _does_, however, have a scene where the monkeys try to make Mowgli their leader, and won't let him go. He was later transplanted to _TaleSpin_.
    -   A few Disney geeks have a theory: this trope is the _only_ acceptable reason why there are "lemurs" in the Late Cretaceous period in _Dinosaur_.
    -   Gorillas and monkeys appear as background characters in _Dumbo_. A gorilla during the circus parade ferociously shakes the bars of his cage but comically drops the fierce act when he accidentally breaks the cage bars.
-   The Barrel Full of Monkeys game monkeys make brief appearances in each _Toy Story_ film (sometimes only during the credits), and they're usually used for quick, silly gags. Escalated in _Toy Story 3_ with DEATH BY MONKEYS.
-   The monkey sidekick in _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs_.
-   Monkey from _Kung Fu Panda_ is a laid-back and somewhat mischievous kung-fu master.
-   The _Madagascar_ film franchise has a ring-tailed lemur (King Julien), a mouse lemur (Mort) and an aye-aye (Maurice). _And_ two chimps, Phil and Mason. All five can also be found in the spin-off TV series _The Penguins of Madagascar_, which ups the count even further by adding two Dumb Muscle gorilla characters, Bada and Bing.
-   _The Rugrats Movie_ has the babies getting lost in a jungle where they meet a troop of escaped circus monkeys, and it seems this way when they start dancing with them. That is, until Tommy opens up Dil's banana-flavored baby food, at which points do _not_ become better with the monkeys.
-   _Space Chimps_, which as the title makes clear, is a revival of ape astronauts!
-   In _Kubo and the Two Strings_, Kubo has a wooden charm shaped like a monkey that comes to life to protect him, simply named Monkey. She's actually Kubo's mother, who transferred her spirit into Monkey when her human body was killed by her sisters.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse_, the protagonist has a well-trained pet monkey that he often dresses in a matching outfit. Taken a bit too far when said protagonist and said monkey are seen together in the trenches of World War I, with the monkey in a little soldier's uniform.
-   _Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back_ had the titular duo adopt an orangutan for some reason. (This was hinted at back at the end of _Mallrats_, where the last scene shows Jay and Silent Bob heading off into the distance with the orangutan, named Suzanne, in tow. No explanation is given for this, nor was the ape ever seen prior. It seemed to be an excuse to shoehorn Weezer's "Suzanne" over the ending montage.) Sexy jewel thieves were involved.
    -   A similar sequence also appeared in the _Jay and Silent Bob_ comic-book miniseries and the Clerks cartoon.
    -   Lampshaded in the film. In one sequence, we see Shannen Doherty in a _Scream_\-esque scene, in which she is attacked by Ghostface but manages to knock him out, and unmasks him. It's the orangutan:
        
        **Shannen:** What?! Fucking Miramax... CUT!  
        **Wes Craven:** What?  
        **Shannen:** A fucking monkey? Jesus, Wes, are you even trying anymore?  
        **Wes:** But the research says people love monkeys!  
        _\[Jay and Silent Bob take the monkey and run)_  
        **Jay:** We love this monkey!  
        **Wes:** See?
        
-   Clint Eastwood's _Every Which Way but Loose_ and its sequel _Any Which Way You Can_ was about a long-haul trucker and his pet orangutan. Eastwood once told a joke about that film (in which the ape was a chimp, according to him); he enjoyed the ape's company so much that he attempted to buy it after filming was completed. The animal's keeper asked how much Eastwood made, and upon learning it was $5,000 a day or some such, replied "Well Mr. Eastwood, the ape likes you too. But he makes $6,000 a day, so perhaps he should buy you".
-   _Outbreak_ unashamedly featured a cute little monkey who was the plague bringer of doom (albeit unintentionally.)
-   _28 Days Later_ combines this with the Uncanny Valley\-esque effect of a humanoid animal to make one scary-ass scene. Test animals unnerve us, monkeys amuse us, but-"The chimps are infected".
-   _Indiana Jones_:
    -   A scene of _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ has Mutt Williams getting stuck in a tree, and being discovered by monkeys that due to having the same "hair" as his, decide to show Mutt vine-swinging and then help him attack the Dirty Communists. Opinions were divided between "it's stupid" ("I used to joke that you could make any movie better by adding monkeys or explosions to it. I take back the part about the monkeys.") and "it's fun" ("What I want is goofy action -- lots of it. (...) And throw in lots of monkeys.").
        -   Third opinion: friggin hilarious.
    -   Of course, a monkey appears in several scenes of _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ until its greed gets the better of it.
        
        **Sallah**: Bad dates.
        
    -   And of course they eat chilled Monkey brains in _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom_.
-   _Time of the Apes_ (like _Planet of the Apes_, only Japanese and terrible). The film was featured on _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, as was _Overdrawn at the Memory Bank_, which involved the main character temporarily inhabiting the body of a baboon as therapy.
-   Two 1990 films gives us Dodger the Capuchin monkey and Dunston the Orangutan.

    -   Supposedly Reagan once autographed a _Bedtime for Bonzo_ publicity photo of him and Bonzo with the inscription "I'm the one with the wristwatch."
-   _Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls_ has a scene with Ace joining a bunch of chimps in a mass exodus from a building, and doing a pretty fair imitation of their movements. Also, gorilla rape to the tune of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight". The latter is a case of Rule of Funny, as gorillas, by and large, have much smaller penises than humans. It also introduces Spike, Ace's monkey sidekick who gets more screentime in the animated series.
-   In _The Fall_, Charles Darwin (yes, that one — sort of) has a monkey "assistant" that he takes with him everywhere. The monkey dying is the point in the movie when things in Roy's story start to get very dark, very quickly.

-   _Ed_, a movie with Matt Le Blanc and a baseball-playing chimpanzee.
-   Deconstructed in _Nope_. The film features the Show Within a Show _Gordy's Home_, a sitcom that ran off the gimmick of the main character being Gordy the chimpanzee, done to draw in family audiences by exploiting the popular conception of nonhuman primates as silly. However, despite seeming tame on-set most of the time, Gordy is still a wild animal, and one of the most aggressive ones known to man, which ultimately leads to him literally going ape after being agitated and startled and mauling the cast and crew.

    _I have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all the peoples of the jungle — except the Monkey-Folk who live in the trees. They have no law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own, but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep, and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way. They are without leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is forgotten. We of the jungle have no dealings with them. We do not drink where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go; we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die. Hast thou ever heard me speak of the Bandar-log till today?_

Gorilla-themed Rangers appear in _Gingaman_/_Lost Galaxy_, _Go-Busters_/_Beast Morphers_, and _Zyuohger_; and _Gaoranger_/_Wild Force_ and _Gekiranger_/_Jungle Fury_ also have gorilla mecha in them. _Kakuranger_/_Mighty Morphin_' Season 3 also has an ape mecha and _Shinkenger_/_Samurai_ has a monkey.

-   _How I Met Your Mother_ features monkeys a few times:
    -   In one episode, Marshal gets mugged by a small monkey. (Or not. He never tells anyone once and for all if he actually just invented that story.) Barney finds this just hilarious. And at the end of the episode, the little primate is reenacting _King Kong_.
    -   In another episode, Robin temporarily moves to Japan, where the co-host of her news show is a chimp.

-   Counting Crows - "Monkey" ("Hey monkey, where you been?")
-   Darling Pet Munkee's almost-eponymous song "Darling Pet Monkey", about an actual mail-order ad for live squirrel monkeys (see the "real life" section).

-   Rufus Thomas - "Can Your Monkey Do the Dog?"
-   The song "Monkeys and Playbills" from \[title of show\].

-   Victorian businessman Thomas Bin thought so, to the extent he had a hotel made out of monkeys, who were stacked together to form a 'rigid but flexible framework'. And it actually worked, until someone set up a peanut-butter and banana treat factory next door, causing the monkeys to go berserk and attack everyone nearby, including Bin himself, who then goes missing. Incidentally, the man describing Bin's fate to his children, who just happens to be his business partner, has no idea why someone would put such a factory there, before offering them some peanut-butter and banana treats.
-   In _New Dynamic English_, some kids, including Max's son John and a girl named Karen wanted a pet monkey.

    Tabletop Games 

-   One faction in the tabletop miniatures game _AT-43_ are the Karmans, who are _gorillas in Powered Armor_.
    -   _Who smoke cigars_.
-   _Feng Shui_ includes among its factions the Jammers, which are intelligent cybernetic monkeys and apes working in concert with the few humans immune to the influence of Chi. Their aim is to destroy every feng shui site in existence so humanity can be "free" from the "tyranny" of Chi, something which may have very bad consequences for the world.
-   The _Magic: The Gathering_ joke set _Unhinged_ featured monkeys, alongside donkeys, as the two major creature types featured. Monkey Monkey Monkey!
-   The _Magic: The Gathering_ design team for _Alliances_ thought that continuity's idea for a race of sentient gorillas was silly, so they made fun of it by putting the word gorilla in every card's name. For example, Force of Will was originally called "Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla (Stop That)." As an homage to this, the card Sol Grail's name is an anagram of "gorillas".
    -   Of course, some of the gorillas (and references to them) still made it into the set as actual cards. In all, nineteen distinct Ape cards have been printed to date (most recently four reprints in the ninth edition of the main set)...not counting those which simply have _all_ creature types.
-   Kroot from the _Warhammer 40k_ use a species called the "Krootox" as a battle and pack animal, it is essentially a big beaked gorilla. More interestingly, the Krootox were once a normal kroot Kindred ("tribe") that used the kroot ability to absorb genes from food to bulk up, eventually becoming non-sentient and stuck in that form.
    -   There's also the Jokaero, who are intelligent orangutans...In SPACE. Though not as prevalent as they once were, they are still important due to their feats of engineering, and aren't even sapient so what they will make is entirely based on the Jokaero's own whims and survival instinct. They are the Imperium's only source of "digital weapons", miniature one-shot versions of full-sized weapons normally used by the Imperium that can be worn on a finger.
        -   And now, thanks to the new Grey Knights codex, it's possible to field _an entire army_ consisting of them (plus one Inquisitor), colloquially known as the "Barrel of Monkeys" army build.
-   _Rifts_ features Ape-Boys (genetically-enhanced apes and monkeys) as a playable race.
-   The fourth set of _Monsterpocalypse_, "Monsterpocalypse Now", introduced the faction "Empire of the Apes".
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ has the howler wasps, more popularly known as Monkey Bees<small>◊</small>
    -   Monkey bees... my God.
    -   Monkey Bees DO NOT make everything better.
    -   On a more pleasant note, there are the _Ramayana_\-inspired vanaras, a playable race introduced in _Oriental Adventures_.
        -   There have actually been lots of monkey- and ape-based creatures in D&D over the years. Listing all of them could probably double this page's length.
-   _Pathfinder_ has its own arrangement of monkey monsters, most notably the Sikari Macaques — swarms of monkeys infected with a form of monkey rabies that leaves them as unhinged killers. This leaves them vulnerable to healing magic — a _remove disease_ spell will halve the swarm's current hit points.
-   Doctor Silverback, from the Champions Universe (and brought over to _Champions Online_), is a superhumanly-intelligent gorilla.
-   The serie of Flash Games _Bloons Tower Defence_ put the player in charge of an army of ridiculously cute monkeys hell-bent on destroying their mortal enemy: _balloons_.Which they fight with darts at first, but then escalates quickly as they bring on bombs, flamethrowers, warlocks, spiked mines and much more.
-   Evil Hat Productions games frequently feature Gorillas, in particular the pulp styled game Spirit of the Century has Gorilla Khan, a sentient gorilla mastermind with many gorilla minions, and The Dresden Files RPG. A spin off company 'One Bad Egg' produced a whole setting seed and race of intelligent apes for Dungeons and Dragons 4e.
-   Meta example for _Exalted_: The team of freelance writers calling themselves the Ink Monkeys, who nearly everyone agrees make everything they touch a thousand times better.
    -   Keep in mind however, that some fans (some more rational than others) think they dialed down the brokenness _too_ much, and now the game is a _little_ underpowered. Most of those admit that the game is more playable, now (and the official boards won't like you very much if you bring up that criticism).
-   _Mutants & Masterminds_ has "Earth-Ape" which is protected by The Primate Patrol. The classic adventure, "Time of Crisis", features the heroes arriving here during a cross-dimensional mission.
-   The comedy RPG _Stuperpowers_ had "Mighty Joe Jung" as a villain. Make a wild guess.
    -   Evil gorilla psychiatrist?
-   Eden Studios once published _Terra Primate_, an RPG not unlike their better-known _All Flesh Must Be Eaten_, but with apes instead of zombies. Most "Ape Worlds" (e.g. settings) were reminiscent of the _Planet of the Apes_ franchise in one way or the other.
-   In _Rocket Age_ Venus' original sapients are the Lizard Monkeys. Unintelligible, one metre tall and not thought to be sapients by most, they nonetheless have a very developed culture and belief system. They're very popular 'pets'.
-   On FUMBBL, a popular website to simulate online _Blood Bowl_ games, there are three teams listed on the CRB teams page which are not actually included in the tabletop rules. Two of them, Daemons of Khorne and Bretonnia, were codified by Cyanide and approved by Games Workshop for the official video games (Khorne for Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition and Bretonnia for Blood Bowl 2). The third team consists of (presumably) sapient bonobos, orangutans, chimps, and gorillas with no basis in Warhammer Fantasy lore, unlike every other team. This trope (as well as a genuinely fair and mechanically interesting play style, YMMV) is the main reason they're included on the roster.

    Theater 

-   In the opera _Der Junge Lord_ (_The Young Lord_) by Hans Werner Henze, scientist Sir Edger introduces his 'son', Lord Barrett, to the upper dignitaries of a German town. The young Lord's strange speech and eccentric behavior become a source of fascination: he is much admired and imitated, even catching the eyes of a young noble lady — until he flings off his clothes during a dance, revealing himself as an ape.
-   The only possible explanation for the "monkey motif" in the Show Within a Show in _The Drowsy Chaperone_. It starts off small, and then goes up a notch in "Bride's Lament". Even the Man in the Chair admits that it's labored.

    Theme Parks 

-   At the Disney Theme Parks:
    -   _Jungle Cruise_ includes many primates, such as orangutans and gorillas; the latter is shown ransacking a campsite.
    -   _The Mystic Manor_ at Hong Kong Disneyland involves a mischievous monkey among the supernatural stuff.

    Toys 

-   The Beanie Babies line has several basic monkeys, a couple of chimpanzees, an orangutan, and a baboon named Cheeks. _And_ a bushbaby.

    Video Games 

-   Obviously, in _Super Monkey Ball_, several monkeys roll in a transparent ball, and eat bananas as they’re trying to reach the goal gate in many mazes.
-   A monkey drives and conducts the train in _Animal Crossing_.
-   A ridiculous number of video game mascots are apes or monkeys of some sort: The mascot for the rhythm action game _Samba de Amigo_, the cast of _Super Monkey Ball_, and _Donkey Kong_, among others.
-   _Aladdin (Virgin Games)_ has bonus levels that actually let you play as Abu the monkey.

-   Subverted in _Asura's Wrath_, with Gohma Howlers, which are anything but nice, as they kill humans without hesitation in packs.
-   In _Baldur's Gate_, the canonical ending for Jan Jansen (spoiler tagged for obtrusive wall of text):
    -   Jan Jansen's life following his association with CHARNAME was typically convoluted, the barest of details hidden amidst his half-truths and whole lies. According to his published memoirs, "A Jansen in Every Port," after a short prison term for monkey smuggling, he returned to his first love... monkey smuggling. This led to the now infamous Gibbon Riot of '72, a tumultuous and altogether unclean event that seemed to center on the estate of the Shadow Thief Vaelag. Jan would deny that he had planned the downfall of the rogue, but he was unable to explain what practical application he had intended for a horde of knife-wielding simians. Nevertheless, the death of the admittedly disliked and generally suspect Vaelag could not be attributed to the young gnome. Strangely enough, Jan had alibis for each and every second of the day in question, and what a day it must have been! Relatives from across the Realms came forward to say that he had stopped in for tea and turnips. At his later wedding to Lissa, Jan was asked how he managed to be in so many places at once, and yet still so far from the scene of the crime. "Well," Jan would say, "when you have that many monkeys, anything is possible."
-   _Banjo-Kazooie_ features a monkey named Konga, who returns in the sequel as a circus ringmaster.
-   One of the main characters of _Beyond Good & Evil 2_ is an uplifted cockney chimp named Noxxie. With a grapple gun arm.
-   In _Bible Adventures_, one level of Noah's Ark had you gathering a pair of monkeys; another level had monkeys throwing fruit and coconuts for you to scavenge.
-   _Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg_: Saltim, the fifth boss, is a funny clown monkey, who is a breather from the difficulty of the game, and is considered to be a simple boss.
-   The _Bloons_ series and its More Popular Spin-Off _Bloons Tower Defense_ are allegedly inspired by carnival games where you throw darts at balloons. Why they made the playable characters monkeys is anyone's guess, but probably because dart-throwing monkeys are funny.
-   Cartoon Network featured a _Breakout_ clone on their website that featured six of their monkey characters trying to impede the player's progress- Magilla Gorilla, Bingo, I. R. Baboon, Monkey, Mojo Jojo, and Blip.
-   _Contact_ features a white-furred monkey that turns out to be the antagonists' Team Pet.
-   The reason why Crunch wouldn't take off his NV Helmet in _Crash: Mind Over Mutant_. "Sooo _awesome!_ Monkeys!"
-   A Cymbal-Banging Monkey in a claw machine is an Optional Boss in the casino level of _Cuphead_.
-   Apparently there were real monkeys on the set of _The Deadly Tower of Monsters._ Unfortunately they were known for flinging their feces all over the place.
-   _Deus Ex_ describes the Grays as (possibly) being genetically engineered hairless monkeys. This doesn't stop them from being the most annoying enemies in the game. Note that these are _psychic_ monkeys.
-   In _Doctor Lautrec and the Forgotten Knights_, the titular doctor has a pet monkey named Nico who hides in his top hat.
-   _Don't Starve_:
    -   Splumonkeys, monkeys that dwell in caves and live inside barrels. They rob players of their inventory and throw manure in combat. If a Splumonkey manages to steal a hat, it'll wear the hat.
    -   In the _Shipwrecked_ DLC, the Prime Apes function as a friendlier version of the Splumonkey. Differences are that they live aboveground, take only items that are dropped, and are a form of "indifferent" mob which can be befriended. (They still wear stolen hats.)
-   In _Dubloon_, your crew's Team Pet is a monkey named Ricky.
-   The _Mother_ series has more than a barrel full of monkeys factoring into the plot.
    -   In _EarthBound Beginnings_, Ninten and the other travel through a underground passage filled with monkeys who give off random false facts as they make their way around.
    -   In _EarthBound (1994)_, a bubblegum-chewing monkey is the key to getting across the river at Winters; another point in the game requires the party to give and receive gifts from several monkeys to proceed.
    -   In _Mother 3_, the third chapter of the game is played _entirely_ by a monkey named Salsa. Fassad makes him his slave by threatening his girlfriend (whom Kumatora dubs the "love monkey") and then fitting him with an electric collar.
-   One of the main villains in _Earthworm Jim_ is Professor Monkeyforahead, a mad scientist who shares his head with an upside-down monkey. The monkey's name is Monkey Professorforahead.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   The Imga are a race of sentient "great apes" from Valenwood, the forest homeland of the Bosmer (Wood Elves). They are known for their reverence to the Altmer (High Elves) and seek to emulate them in dress and, sometimes, even going as far to shave their fur. Ironically, the most famous Imga in the series' lore is Marukh, known as the "Monkey Prophet," who was the leader of the 1st Era Alessian Order. The Order was extremely human-supremacist and extremely racist toward all races of Elves. They've yet to appear in the series (though the lore-friendly _Skyrim_ Mod, "Moonpath to Elsweyr", adds them in as Giant Mooks to the Altmeri Thalmor.
    -   The Tang Mo are a race of "monkey folk" who hail from the continent of Akavir, far to the east of Tamriel. They are described as kind and brave, but also simple and mad. Despite this, they are capable of raising armies and have successfully defended themselves against their hostile and more aggressive neighbors (including the Kamal "Snow Demons" and the Tsaesci "Snake Vampires"). They've recently (relative to when _Mysterious Akavir_ was written) allied themselves with the Ka Po' Tun "Tiger Folk".
-   _Enemy on Board_: Monkus, one of the crewmembers you can play as is a monkey in a spacesuit.
-   _Far Cry_ has mutated monkeys known as Trigen that run straight at you, can leap at you from more than a dozen feet away, and can kill you in just 2 or 3 hits. They were widely considered Demonic Spiders and an unexpected Genre Shift from the game's previously tactical combat against human mercenaries.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   A Side Quest in _Final Fantasy X-2_ involves acting as matchmaker for a group of lonely, single monkeys. The Trainer Dressphere for Rikku provides her with a monkey named Ghiki for a battle companion.
    -   Zidane Tribal, protagonist of _Final Fantasy IX_, has a monkey tail. He's also one of the most beloved main characters of the series, probably only behind Cloud. Better with monkeys indeed!
-   _Freedom Force vs. the 3rd Reich_ has the Kill-a-Rillas, half-human, half gorilla experiments created by Bliztkrieg.
-   In _Granblue Fantasy_, the "Handsome Gorilla" event has this trope as its central Rule of Funny theme. From the title alone, the eponymous drinking supplement, the side-effects of acting and speaking like Gorillas, to the worst case scenario of mistaking everyone as Gorillas. And oh, did we mention the new gacha summon that was released alongside this event? Nothing else, but a Gorilla!
-   Apparently, the developers of _God Hand_ decided that the hilarity of gorillas was only increased by training them in the art of Lucha Libre, and was increased to nearly fatal levels by throwing in groin shots complete with a laugh track. It worked, mostly due to the fact that the whole game is so absurd that they don't seem too weird in comparison.
-   Zombie monkeys also showed up in the original _House of the Dead_.
-   _Justice League Heroes: The Flash_ follows the trend of DC comics and has The Flash villain Gorilla Grodd as the first boss fight, and his gorilla army serves as some of the variety of goons throughout the entire game.
-   _Kingdom of Loathing_ has a few monkey familiars (the Howling Balloon Monkey, the Cymbal-Playing Monkey, and the Hobo Monkey) and a few pieces of monkey-based equipment (the sock monkey, mad scientist's sock monkey, and Borg sock monkey, off-hand items available from Crimbo 2005, 2006, and 2007 respectively, and the rhesus monkey, the familiar-specific equipment for the Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot).
-   At one point in the Infocom game _Leather Goddesses of Phobos_, your character gets mindswapped with a monkey. In a cage. With an amorous monkey of the other sex.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_: You need to pay a monkey to open a dungeon door for you.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening_: A monkey appears in southwest of Kanalest Castle, and is part of the game's Chain of Deals. He's also important to fight the Chain Chomp you happen to be walking.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_: A group of monkeys inhabit Southern Swamp; though mischievous, they're well-mannered and have memorized the patterns of the local Woods of Mystery. They ask Link to rescue an innocent monkey from implied death in Deku Palace, for which he'll also have to rescue the Deku Princess in Woodfall Temple.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_: Monkeys feature heavily in an early part of the game, namely within Faron Woods and the residing Forest Temple, and show up later. One Mini-Boss is even a baboon (acting under pest control), who then helps Link during the battle against the first boss, Diababa.
-   The Lego adaptations of _Indiana Jones_ and _Pirates of the Caribbean_. Both franchises had monkeys to begin with, but the Lego games, as full as they are of Affectionate Parody and Silliness Switch, decided everything was better with _more_ monkeys. Trading bananas to monkeys so they'll give you a tool you need is a frequent game mechanic, and there are other gags involving monkeys.
-   _Live A Live_: Gori the prehistoric gorilla in the Prehistoric chapter is Pogo's ally, provider of slapstick comic relief, attacks with his own natural arms and some farts he produces, and he sniggers like Muttley when it's Pogo's turn to get involved in slapstick he didn't cause.
-   The African Warlords in _March of War_ use trained gorillas as shock troops.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   The original _Mega Man_ series had Buster Rod G. of the Genesis Unit. Both he and Hanumachine from _Mega Man Zero_ are shout outs to Sun Wukong from _Journey to the West_.
    -   _Mega Man X_ series had Spark Mandrill and Soldier Stonekong. More recently there's Purprill the Mandroid from _Mega Man ZX_.
    -   _Mega Man Legends_ have the recurring character of Data, a cute robot monkey sidekick.
-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ included the minigame entitled "Snake VS Monkey". It's almost exactly what it sounds like. It's a Shout-Out to Sony's _Ape Escape_ series which, in return, featured a minigame in _Ape Escape 3_ called "Mesal Gear Solid: Snake Escape", an Affectionate Parody of the MGS games.
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ has a monkey in the actual game — apparently the character it hangs out with wasn't "interesting enough" on his own. Fortunately Raiden's Motion Capture actor was pretty good at imitating a monkey, and Kojima liked the imitation enough that he decided to Throw It In.
-   _Metal Slug 3_ allows the player to get a cute monkey armed with a deadly Uzi as a sidekick. _Metal Slug 4_, in the other hand, allows the player to _transform_ into said cute machine gun-wielding monkey.
-   In _MindJack_, the corporate military have cybernetically enhanced gorillas and bonobos in their army. In his otherwise-bile-filled review of the game, Angry Joe singled this out as the only positive thing he could mention about it.
    
    "Y'know, I'm trying _real_ hard to find one good thing about this game. But I can't! I can't! Oh! Oh! There are monkeys! Everyone loves monkeys! You can even create a little monkey-minion-army! Monkey minions! Monkey Minions! WOO! _**ONLY TO HAVE THE GAME FREEZE FIVE SECONDS LATER!!!!!!!!**_ "
    
-   _Monkey Island_. Better yet, **three-headed** monkey.
-   _The Curse of Monkey Island_ (the third in the series), obviously taking advantage of this trope, advertised having more monkeys in it than the previous two games combined. Also the awesome parody of the THX logo in it with increasingly louder monkey sounds and the ominous text "The monkeys are listening".
-   _Nazi Zombies_ has the Monkey Bombs; cymbal-banging monkey toys that play music to distract the zombies and deal significant damage to them, perfect in aiding downed teammates or getting a horde off your back. In the inversion sense, some of the maps have a few monkey enemy variants.
-   In _Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2_, one of the bonus missions involves the Ouendan helping a stuffed monkey and toy soldier who were accidentally thrown away return home. The BGM? The theme song to the 70's TV show, _Monkey Magic_.
-   One of the playable characters in _Overwatch_ is an uplifted gorilla with powered armor and an electric gun named Winston. He comes from a colony of gorillas that live on _the moon_.
-   A number of _Pokémon_ are monkeys and other primates.
    -   Ash has captured some of them in the anime: Primeape, Aipom (traded to Dawn and now an Ambipom), and Chimchar (now an Infernape).
    -   _Pokémon Black and White_ feature a trio of monkeys of the Fire, Water, and Grass types. The first Gym Leaders and countless trainers after use them (for Triple Battles or otherwise) for no other reason than to execute this trope.
-   The main reason for the character of Skrunch in _Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal_ (in this case, a cyclopean alien monkey). And of course, the series wouldn't be complete without a gun that turns enemies into monkeys, which appears in _Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time_ as the Chimpinator. Enemy robots? Cymbal banging monkeys.
-   The Eliminators from _Resident Evil 0_ are zombified lab monkeys. However, everything is _not_ better when these little assholes are around.
-   Jep, a monkey you can befriend in _Return to Mysterious Island_, is an implausibly-clever helper that uses inventory items for you.
-   A rather large number of minigames in all four _Rhythm Heaven_ titles feature monkeys in some form or another, from a girl tap-dancing alongside two monkeys, to a pop star's cheering audience of monkeys, to even a wristwatch (and a clock tower) that relies on tiny, high-fiving monkeys to tell the time. _Megamix_ lampshades and invokes this in the description for the minigame "Pajama Party" ("Everything, including pajama parties, is better with monkeys"), and features a challenge where you play a string of monkey-based minigames in a row.
-   Double Subversion in _Runescape_. There's an island populated by intelligent monkeys but it's a Death World to humans. Things get better when you get an item that turns you into a monkey.
-   _Ryzom_ both inverts this and plays it straight — there are "Primitive" variants of each of the four Homin Races (three — Gibbaï, Cutes, and Frahars — that actually appear ingame, and a fourth, Momos, which is extinct) that like to attack you on sight (and can hit like a ton of bricks if you're a lower-level character), but there are also "Intelligent" variants of these (Gibads, Fraiders, and Cuzans) which are relatively friendly and are grouped as Tribes that you can earn Fame with.
-   The _Sengoku Basara_ series has Keiji with his little monkey friend Yumekichi.
-   The first mascot of the SNK games company was a cute monkey named Ukee. He's later seen as the pet of Terry Bogard.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   Speaking of enemy robomonkeys, the Kikis of the _Sonic Adventure_ series.
    -   There's also the robot monkey Coconuts featured in both _Sonic the Hedgehog 2_ for the Genesis and _Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog_, as well as some of the Sonic-based comics.
-   _Spelunky_ features monkeys who leap on your back and randomly inflict one of several possible annoyances on you. (Knocking you out, stealing something from your inventory, lighting the fuse on one of your bombs...)
-   Averted in _Star Fox_ — with the exception of a single specimen all simians are evil. And at least one is creepy.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Super Mario 64_: At Tall Tall Mountain, Ukkiki the monkey steals Mario's hat with glee.
    -   _Mario Party 5_: The minigame Chimp Chase has all the characters retrieve the mischievous baby Ukikis to their color-coded parents (brown, red, blue and white). Catching an Ukiki is tricky enough, due to them running fast, so it's advised to focus on those closest to their breed's teritory. Each Ukiki retrieved is worth 1 point but, after a while, a gold-colored Ukiki appears, which runs faster and can be grouped with any of the four families, being worth 3 points instead of one. The character with the highest score after 30 seconds wins.
-   _System Shock 2_ had monkeys with cryokinesis and pyrokinesis.
-   _Tamarin_: The Player Character is a Tamarin out to save his homeland and family from invading giant bugs.
-   _Thief: The Dark Project_ and _Thief II: The Metal Age_ include ApeBeasts among the Trickster's minions. In the second game, some of them have blowpipes.
-   Monkeys have become the de facto mascots of the _TimeSplitters_ game series.
    -   _TimeSplitters Future Perfect_ included ninja monkeys, zombie monkeys, and cyborg monkeys (which the game describes as "Inevitable, really"). Multiplayer includes "Monkey Assistant" mode, in which the losing player is lent help by a pack of monkeys with rocket launchers.
    -   The easiest way to describe the series (especially 2) is like this: _GoldenEye_ on speed with monkeys!
    -   The 4th entry to the series will reportedly have a Master Chief monkey and a Big Daddy monkey.
-   In _Tomba!_ there is Charles a monkey with a parasol and a lot of banana-related quests.
-   The player's party in _Treasure Hunter G_ includes a monkey that wields Black Magic.
-   _Trombone Champ_ advertises that it has a _lot_ of hidden baboons in it, presumably because baboons are inherently funny animals.
-   Nathan Drake certainly thinks this in _Uncharted 4: A Thief's End_, when he pauses in a Malagasy market to play with a pet ring-tailed lemur. Unless of course he's bought an apple from a market stall earlier, in which case the lemur makes off with the apple.
-   _WarioWare: Touched!_: There's a monkey which steals a bunch of bananas from Kat and Ana. It's a peaceful, yet mischievous primate whom the sisters look for during their story chapter. When found and cornered, the monkey make suse of its cuteness to be spared. He becomes their pet and is named Numchuck.
-   _World of Warcraft_:
    -   The Hozen are a race of sapient mountain- and tree-dwelling monkeys. They are noted as having mentalities comparable to a fourteen year-old boy, made only worse when their new Horde allies give them rocket launchers and machine guns.
    -   For a while, _World of Warcraft_ had an inverse to the trope. Despite their toughness and useful area-of-effect ability, gorillas were the least popular Hunter pets, due to their scarcity, lack of skills, and fussy diets. Fortunately, later patches corrected this.
-   Your Non-Human Sidekick in _Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure_ is Wiki: a hovering golden monkey that can magically transform into a bell that Zack can use to transform animals into specific tools to solve puzzles.
-   Monkeys and apes are very well-represented in the roster of species available for _Zoo Tycoon 2_, especially if you include the Endangered Species and African Adventure expansion packs.

    Web Animation 

-   In _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, Lord Inquisitor Coteaz's tactic against Descius' ministers are barrels of Jokaero, intelligent orangutans.
-   _RWBY_ gives us Sun Wukong, a Monkey King Lite Faunus with a simian motif and a Prehensile Tail, whose comical antics and fighting skills really do make everything better. On the other hand, a Killer Gorilla Grimm called a Beringel shows up in the Volume 4 promotional short.
-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Averted with Mibirds. Like in Real Life, they are portrayed as unpredictable and quite dangerous.
-   In the "Medimoji" series by ZDoggMD, the primary care doctor is a monkey. He's usually pretty friendly, (except when he _did_ start flinging poop when he got matched to a hospital he didn't want to go to), and is something of a Butt-Monkey, as (being a Jack of All Trades), family medicine is considered something of an acceptable target within the medical community.
-   Heroic simians in _Gaming All-Stars_ include Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, and Amigo in _The Ultimate Crossover_ and _Remastered_, all of whom become part of the ultimate team of heroes near the end of both versions.

    Webcomics 

-   Imagine suddenly finding a dojo in your room. Now see this Least I Could Do strip. See? Better.
-   A recurring villain (despite a brief Heel–Face Turn) in _It's Walky!_ is Monkey Master, a Humongous Mecha created by Head Alien. Monkey Master will take every opportunity to point out that he is in fact shaped more like an ape; at one point, Robin wrote the word "Munky" all over him in a split second just to goad him (or rather, at the time, her).
-   In _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_, Dr. McNinja employs a gorilla named Judy as his secretary.
    -   According to Word of God, Judy is the proud possessor of one of the few immutable laws of the universe:
-   Some children have a monster in their closet. Max, from _Bitmap World_, has a monkey in his closet. Later in the comic, there's a whole storyline involving monkeys.
-   Churd Thomas from _DEMONARCHY_. He even plays go-fish.
-   In _Schlock Mercenary_, various Terran species have been ascended to sapience. Of these, apes are prominently featured. Also elephants.
-   Kismetropolis: featured a tryptophane trip involving a recipe for Monkey Bread.
    
    **Jamie:** There's NO monkey in the monkey bread. Swear. Guys? Seriously! No monkey!
    
-   In _Dominic Deegan_, Everything's Better With Fire Monkeys.
-   Gwynn from _Sluggy Freelance_ owns several monkeys who are enchanted to attack and humiliate anyone who irritates her. The monkeys themselves don't appear that often, but a lot of mileage is gotten out of the gag that the other characters pretend "monkeys" is Gwynn's nickname for her breasts. "I've done something bad with my monkeys (...) If we don't do something my monkeys are going to be _all over her_ in front of _everyone_ (...) be on the lookout for my monkeys and grab them if you see them. They could pop up anywhere."

-   Never one to miss a comics trope, _The Descendants_ has recurring character Lucian the Ape Knight and has had some one shot demonic baboons.
-   Bruno, Vatsy's bodyguard/handyman/gopher in _Vatsy and Bruno_, is a chimp. Subverted somewhat in that, unlike most chimp characters, he's pragmatic, stoic, and content. To quote the work:
    
    He'd found that a level tone, an open stance, a patient mind and a large-bore double-barreled shotgun solved most problems almost effortlessly. His philosophy could be almost described as Taoism, if Taoism had a little-known subclause about the prudent use of firearms and arson.

-   One April Fools' Day, Cartoon Network gave its entire website an ape-themed makeover and released a new game called _Brick It_. Said game seems like a straightforward brick-breaking game... except with just about every simian from CN's shows as obstacles (Magilla Gorilla holds the paddle in place, Mojo Jojo lays extra bricks, etc.). In the game's own universe, it might be inverted — Everything's _Worse_ with Monkeys.
-   In _The Last Podcast on the Left_ series on Jonestown, the crew is highly amused by the fact that one of Jim Jones' early means to raise money was selling spider monkeys door to door and they cannot stop laughing when they play a clip from a Peoples Temple follower's deadpan testimony of her first having met Jones when he sold her a monkey to replace her previous one which had _hung itself_. Later on, Henry relates how Peoples Temple eventually got a chimpanzee named Mr. Muggs as their mascot, whom Henry imagines as an Only Sane Man communicating his displeasure at the madness around him via a _Congo_ style voice synthesizer.
-   In the April 1981 episode of _'80s All Over_, Drew McWeeny ponders why film and TV believed in this trope as it applied to orangutans at the turn of the 1980s (_Every Which Way but Loose_, _Cannonball Run II_, etc.) when he and Scott Weinberg discuss _Going Ape!_ Did people just discover their existence at that time and that's how it became the go-to funny animal?

-   A popular meme, "Return to Monke", concerns a desire for humans to de-evolve and become primates, all played for humor. This is illustrated particularly well by a memetic video where the process of evolution is shown, only for the man to declare he wants to become a monkey again, which is followed by the man de-evolving and a humorous video of a monkey spinning around a log set to "DK Mountain & Dino Dino Jungle", accompanied by text reading "Reject Humanity Become Monke".

Later, after he explains that Francine is in real danger, a monkey randomly pops out from behind his desk, making the official crack up.

    -   "You know, if it weren't for the fact that all of this is historically accurate, I would think that someone was making up incredibly lame puns." This is specifically in response to a history lesson about how the "Founding Alpha Males" signed the "Declar_ape_tion of Independence" to create "The United Apes of America", but there are more ape related puns. Many, many more.
    -   The show paid homage to _Space Ghost_ in "Channel Chasers," when Cosmo turned into The Monkey.
-   In a few episodes of _Family Guy_, it was shown Chris had an evil monkey in his closet. No one else believed him. It was apparently one of the writers' favorite running gags.

Even the heroes were underwhelmed; Wonder Woman's response upon seeing her transformation: "Oh, come ON!"

    -   Title on the multiplex cinema marquee: "Sing, Monkey, Sing."
    -   An in-universe example: Homer always finds monkeys (or actually, chimpanzees) hysterically funny whenever someone dresses them in human clothes. It helps that he's easily amused in general, but for his entertainment value, nothing beats chimps.

Other Transformers getting up to monkey business include Beastbox and Apeface from _Generation One_, and Optimus Minor, Apelinq, Primal Prime, B'Boom, and Apache from the beast era.

    Other 

-   _MAD_ had a one-panel feature for a brief period of time called "Monkeys Are Always Funny". The article consisted of a serious, often tragic picture from real life with a monkey digitally added in — and yes, for some reason the monkey was _always_ funny. They also did an entire issue "written by" monkeys. It didn't work as well as you'd think; when every single punchline is "MONKEY!", it loses its effect.
-   The greatest TV pitch in history: "She's the Pope. He's a chimp. They're cops."
-   As they're all improvised it gets hard to really pin it down, but around 30% of Ross Nobles shows will involve monkeys.
-   The Penn Jillette radio show had a regular feature called "Monkey Tuesday", in which monkey news and monkey-related discussion would open the show, and callers would call in with stories of their personal encounters with primates.

-   Freeware 3D program Blender has the head of a monkey (named "Suzanne," as a Shout-Out to Kevin Smith) as one of its basic models. It's often used for test renders.

-   Chunky Monkey ice cream
-   A notice for _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ that appears on the book of the script is from Guy the Gorilla: "Made me want to eat my own vomit."
-   Averted in the Furry Fandom, where primate anthros are among the more uncommon species. This could be because the fandom is based around anthropomorpism, and that primates are already so humanlike that they can't be anthropomorphized to the same extent as other species.

    Real Life 

-   It is worth noting that, while apes and monkeys may be cute, charming and even harmless as babies, when they reach adulthood they tend to become aggressive, unpredictable and often physically stronger than humans. They may even potentially carry a number of deadly diseases that can infect humans. This combination makes many non-human primates _very_ dangerous animals. This is why it is illegal to keep any monkey or ape as a pet in many countries.
    -   Zookeepers and wildlife experts have stated that chimpanzees are among the most dangerous animals to work with. They're programmed by evolution to have high levels of aggression and dominance; keeping one as a pet means that sooner or later the chimp will start challenging you in subtle ways that an untrained person will not pick up on. One day, a switch in its brain will get flipped and it will basically say to itself: "There's room for only one boss around here, _and I'm pretty sure that I can take you._"
    -   Gorillas and (female) orangutans, however, are straight examples of this trope, as they both fall into the Gentle Giant category despite their menacing appearances. If you harm them or their families or challenge them, though, you will see why they have no natural predators.
    -   Monkeys are also known to steal from people; while this can be a minor inconvenience if they steal food, they are known to steal bags, phones or anything that they can take with them. They can also break them out of anger or discard them when they lose interest in them. Some have even learned to hold these useless items as ransom since their owners desperately want them back and will exchange them for something more desirable to the primate.
    -   At zoos and in captivity, apes have been known to mess around with the humans watching them for their own amusement. From hiding out of sight and then leaping out with a roar to cause a Jump Scare, to flinging poo at people that annoy them. Indeed, you'll find many videos of apes playing harmlessly with viewers, such as knocking on the glass back at people who knock on it at them, but you'll find just as many videos of apes trolling people.
-   Do a search by interest on any popular blog site for monkey and another word. Hit counts are highest for "mad monkey sex" or "mad monkey love" or "crazy monkey sex" or "crazy monkey love".
    -   Some species of monkeys take promiscuity to a very high level. Brother–Sister Incest does occur. Plus there's the whole gorillas/harems thing.
        -   The "monkeys" most often mentioned in terms of sex studies are the Bonobo apes. They use sex as recreation and it is not limited to same-gender pairing. They've also exhibited rudimentary fetishes.
-   Monkeys are being trained to assist disabled people.
-   The monkey god Hanuman was named chairman of an Indian business school. No, seriously.
-   Due to the depressing nature of the credit crunch, the front page of the BBC website currently reads "Sick of hearing about stock slides? Never fear, we have the solution — monkey waiters."<small>◊</small>
-   The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim introduced an unofficial mascot in 2000 which they dubbed the "Rally Monkey". It began as a gag by two of the team's video board operators who would play a clip from _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_ of a white-haired capuchin monkey jumping up and down with the words "Rally Monkey" superimposed over it when the Angels were losing against the San Francisco Giants by one run in the bottom of the ninth. They then scored two runs to win the game. The Rally Monkey became so popular among fans that the Angels hired an _actual_ monkey to shoot clips to be used in later seasons, and the Monkey made its reappearance in 2002, the year the Angels won the World Series (once again to San Francisco's chagrin).
-   Oh dear, the Lake Superior State University has added the word to their "List of Words to Be Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness", specifically because of this trope. I think we broke it \[1\].
-   _The Daily Show_ had a lot of fun with this one in relation to Congress' "monkey bite bill".

-   The late Michael Jackson's best friend, Bubbles The Chimp.
-   A man in China trained some pet monkeys in rudimentary Tae Kwon Do to entertain passersby. In December 2009 the monkeys turned on him. (For the record, the trainer overcame the monkeys and restrained them before they could do any real harm)
-   Fox News (erroneously) reported in 2010 that the Taliban was training "monkey terrorists" to shoot and kill American soldiers.
-   Some 50 years ago, people actually put up ads selling monkeys in comic books — this could not be a good idea at any level.
-   In Spain, to call a young child "mono/mona" (basically, calling them a monkey) is a compliment, basically saying that they are very cute.
    -   In England, a small child being referred to as a 'little monkey' is not quite so complimentary: it means they're mischievous, but conveys to other adults that they're adorably so, and is sometimes used affectionately. Which more or less sums up this trope...
-   In 1988, two Brazilian comedic newspapers (who would later join forces and have a TV show) launched a mayor campaign for a chimpanzee who was very popular in Rio's zoo. Over 400,000 people voted for him, (or rather, wrote his name in the ballot as protest) which would have landed him third among twelve candidates! And the chimp's death in 1996 led to official mourning by the city!
-   Only one animal on Earth has mastered fire, sailed the ocean blue, eradicated some of the world's deadliest diseases, landed members of its species on the moon and created the internet. That species, _Homo Sapiens_, is a primate.
    -   Only one other animal began to master fire, make clothes, learn to speak language, and sailed across the seas. That species is _Homo erectus_, the _ancestor_ of _Homo sapiens_.
-   The Ikea Monkey, a baby snow macaque in a winter coat that wandered around the front of an Ikea store in Toronto, Canada. It became an Internet sensation due to the sheer absurdity and adorableness. Although the monkey had to be taken into custody since owning a pet monkey is illegal in Canada.
-   For many years, the NBA's Phoenix Suns has had a gorilla as its mascot.
-   Koko, who has her own website, was a peaceful Western lowland gorilla who liked human company and had her own sign language that people began picking up on. Sadly, she passed away in mid-2018 at the age of 46 (which, impressively enough, is way past the average life expectancy for a Western lowland gorilla).
-   Chimpanzees are capable of empathy to some extent despite being aggressive animals. In one episode of _Escape to Chimp Eden,_ a chimp is released into an area enclosed by an electric fence. It touches the fence and gets shocked. What's really astounding is when its friend is released into the area with it the first chimp repetitively keeps it from the fence, trying to herd it away from the fence whenever it gets close. _It understood the fence would harm the other chimp and actively tried to protect it._
-   YouTuber Mattias Pilhede tells the story of how his maternal grandfather got owning monkeys and other exotic animals as pets illegal in Sweden.
