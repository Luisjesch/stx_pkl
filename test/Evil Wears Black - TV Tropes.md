Careful, Your Highness. Her robe is a clue that eating that apple is _not_ a good idea.

Ironclad _shows us the familiar Hollywood image of medieval times in which all peasants are covered in mud, and everyone wears brown—Unless they're baddies, in which case they wear black._

—**Lindybeige**, "_Ironclad_: Part Two - costumes"

Black is perhaps the most typical color for evil, or at least the antagonists, to wear. Thus in many stories, the villains will wear largely black clothing most of the time, in contrast to the colors worn by neutral and good characters (which will be at least moderately lighter).

This is because, in many cultures, black is the color of darkness, decay, and death. Thus _even though wearing black doesn't make someone evil, being evil makes it more than likely one is going to wear black_.

It doesn't matter if it's all the villains, the Big Bad and a few others, or just a group of Mooks that appear for a few episodes, if they wear a large amount of black (even just one noticeable part of their clothing), you know it's this trope. This is also why black is a common color for an Evil Costume Switch.

Heck, some Eviler than Thou villains might wear black when the "lesser" evils don't.

There's some science behind this. There are studies that show that people that wear black are more aggressive than people who don't. They've also found that black isn't only associated with evil, but also contamination and sickness. These associations give people an instinctive cue that the person wearing black is dominant, and somebody you don't want to mess with. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

The Western genre tradition of the bad guys wear the black hat was not as common as later writers would think. However, some certainly held to it, such as _Once Upon a Time in the West_ and _Shane_, and you'd probably never imagine Lee Van Cleef without one.

This trope very often involves a good chunk of Color-Coded for Your Convenience — whereas villains are dressed in black, heroes or innocent characters will wear white or light and bright colors.

Now since some think Evil is Cool, then black can also become a cool color, but _those don't cover this trope, nor does this trope come into play if the heroes also wear black_. This _can_ come into play with a Villain Protagonist though.

## Trope relations:

A Sub-Trope of:

-   Dark Is Evil (since dark is usually shown as black)
-   Dress-Coded for Your Convenience (since this is about clothing color)
-   Good Colors, Evil Colors

A Super-Trope to:

-   Black Knight (as wearing black armor is part of the trope)
-   Black Cloak

A Sister Trope to:

-   Black Eyes of Evil
-   Paint It Black (which isn't limited to this color)
-   Red and Black and Evil All Over (which often involves clothing)

Compare:

-   Evil Costume Switch
-   Grayscale of Evil
-   Bright Is Not Good (bright, brilliant colors associated with a villain)
-   Purple Is the New Black

Contrast:

-   Blue Is Heroic and Red Is Heroic
-   Dark Is Not Evil
-   Good Wears White
-   Little Black Dress (wearing black is stylish instead of evil)
-   Movie Superheroes Wear Black (because they are still heroes)
-   Mysterious Purple
-   Villain in a White Suit (when evil wears white)

    Anime & Manga 

-   While black is present in most of the character designs in _Bungou Stray Dogs_, a lot of it seems disproportionately centered around the Port Mafia. Notably, Dazai's Heel–Face Turn prior to the series is marked by a change from a mostly black wardrobe to lighter colors like tan.
    -   It's stated in-universe that mentors in the mafia gifted their new students with a piece of black clothing (or weapon).
-   _Death Note_:
    -   Misa, despite her childlike behavior and appearance, is secretly evil and wears Gothic clothing, especially a Gothic lolita-like maid outfit.
    -   Mello, the Anti-Hero of the second half of the series, wears black pants and a black shirt.

    -   _Dragon Ball Super_ has Goku Black, some kind of mass-murdering Evil Twin of Goku who dons a black gi. It's Future Bulma who came up with the name, specifically because of his wardrobe, which might be short for "Goku in Black".
-   The Fallen Angels from _High School D×D_ have black wings and are dressed in black, although they still use light-based powers.

-   Zig-zagged in _Lyrical Nanoha_: in the original incarnation of the series, Chrono Harlaown was the bad guy and wore black clothes with Spikes of Doom. As the concept of the series evolved, Chrono became an interdimensional law officer but kept his black attire, which was instead retrofitted as the uniform of the Enforcers, top-ranked dimensional police. Fate Testarossa took Chrono's place as the main character's rival and resident Dark Magical Girl and also wore black from the onset, but the series went the Dark Is Not Evil route, and Fate turned out to be the most Lawful Good character in the show, while still wearing mostly black because it suited her—and because she eventually rose up to join the ranks of the Enforcers, just like Chrono.
-   In _Naruto_, one of the Akatsuki's distinguishing traits is that each member wears a black cloak.

-   In _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_, most of the prominent villains wear black. The Titans wear it as a Putting on the Reich way of emphasizing their State Sec status and dictatorial ways. Haman Karn, Evil Chancellor of the Neo-Zeon faction based on the asteroid colony Axis, also wears black throughout _Zeta_ and sequel series _Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ_ to go along with her ambitions of Earth Sphere domination.
-   _Resident Evil: Heavenly Island_: Zi Li is the only major female character who wears a black swimsuit, and is probably one of the evilest women in the franchise.

But younger, late-entry or otherwise non-traditional Assassins <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  are rising to prominence. One rising star dispenses with the Black altogether <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , preferring to wear the comfortable veldt-khaki of her homeland. Other new young Assassins are even wearing previously-disdained camouflage outfits for those occasions where it works better than Black.
-   _RainbowDoubleDash's Lunaverse:_ A group of not-cultists in _Nightmares Yet to Come_ wear black hooded cloaks over black fur and black manes. One of Trixie's first thoughts on seeing them is that Rarity would probably object to their limited fashion sense. Later chapters show they don't _always_ look like this, and one of them explains to a victim that they mainly do it for iconography's sake.
-   Parodied in _Material Days_. Material-L thinks Chrono is obviously evil because he wears black.

    Films — Animated 

-   Disney Animated Canon:

    -   Subverted _Frozen (2013)_. In order to throw off the audience, Prince Hans wears light colors while the other characters (Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and the Duke of Weselton) wear darker colors. The spoilered individual is a subversion of the Prince Charming trope Disney is known for, selfishly betraying Anna so he can seize the Arendellian throne.
-   Instead of his typical white suit, the _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_ version of Kingpin wears a black suit, giving him a more villainous and intimidating look.
-   In _The Thief and the Cobbler_, the Evil Chancellor Zigzag wears a mostly pitch black robe, with minor gold edges.
-   To the extreme in the Italian cartoon _West and Soda_, which parodies the Spaghetti Western: when Johnny, the good guy, finally goes on his revenge spree, he changes his clothing from white (the standard good guy outfit) to black.

    Films — Live Action 

-   In _300_, the Persian warrior elite known as the Immortals wear all-black uniforms with creepy silver masks. They're the most dangerous of all of Xerxes's warriors and are soon revealed to _literally_ be monsters. In _300: Rise of an Empire_, the whole Persian navy is wearing black.

    -   In _The Suicide Squad_, resident Hate Sink Dick "Blackguard" Hertz wears all-black body armor, in direct contrast to his more sympathetic and colorfully-dressed compatriots. Meanwhile, Mad Scientist Gaius "The Thinker" Grieves spends most of his screen time wearing a casual all-black ensemble (blazer, Hawaiian shirt, jeans and sneakers).
-   In the _Dracula_ adaptation starring Bela Lugosi, his black Ominous Opera Cape with a High Collar of Doom became iconic of villains and the Classical Movie Vampire.
-   _End of Days_. After Satan takes a Tall, Dark, and Handsome host, he walks around in a black longcoat and later appears in a Black Cloak during the Satanic bedding ceremony.
-   In _The Great Race_, Professor Fate and Max wear black (and their car is also black). Although this is a comedy, they are still the villains.
-   In the Black Comedy _Heathers_, the trenchcoat-wearing J.D. is given the signature color black to show him as the villain. Played with in that it's used more for the badass associations at first as he seems like a cool outsider from the female protagonist's perspective. It only gradually becomes clear that he's actually a homicidal lunatic.
-   _The Holy Office_: Most characters wear colorful 16th century clothing except the inquisidors, who dress in all black. Justified in that black dye was expensive and thus reserved for people with higher positions.
-   In _Karate A Muerte En Torremolinos_, the ninjas are completely dressed in black.
-   _The Karate Kid_: The Cobra Kai members who bully Daniel wear black martial arts uniforms.
-   _Kung Fu Hustle_: The Axe Gang wears stylish black suits.
-   _The Last Starfighter_: Xur wears black, in contrast to his father and the other Rylians, whom he betrayed, wearing white.
-   _The Legend of Frenchie King_: The outlaw Louise and her gang of sisters always deck out entirely in black when committing their robberies. Morally speaking, they are still A Lighter Shade of Black compared to the also black-clad, inhumane Dr. Miller.
-   In _The Lord of the Rings_ films, the main minions of Sauron tend to favor black, whether it be the robes of the Ringwraiths or the armor of the Orcs, in contrast to the bright and/or earthy colors favored by the good guys. That said, Sauron's _human_ minions seem to favor gold and scarlet. In a slight subversion, the Guards of the Citadel in Gondor also wear black, albeit with silver highlights.
-   _Maleficent_: The title character starts the movie wearing a tan dress, then switches to the iconic black robe after her Start of Darkness. She later pulls a Heel–Face Turn, but continues to wear the black robe.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:
    -   HYDRA of course in _Captain America: The First Avenger_, but inverted when Steve Rogers wakes up in the future; when he starts getting aggressive the door opens and black-clad SHIELD mooks enter. Steve naturally assumes the worst and throws them through the wall.
    -   _Thor: Ragnarok_: Hela's outfit is a combination of black with green patterns. Even without her pitch-black helmet on she looks remarkably gothic.
-   MonsterVerse:
    -   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_: Alan Jonah almost-consistently wears dark colors when he can, and after escaping Antarctica, he wears a pitch-black top. This is in contrast to his Well-Intentioned Extremist partner-in-crime, who prefers light-colored clothes, showing that Jonah is far less genuine in his well-intentions to "save the planet" by releasing the Titans to cull humanity's self-destruction, and he's unwilling to make any attempt to stop King Ghidorah once it begins creating an extinction event.
    -   _Godzilla vs. Kong_: Amongst the three human antagonists who represent Apex Cybernetics; Ren Serizawa is the biggest offender with his pitch-black overcoat and pitch-black casual shirt, but Walter Simmons and his daughter Maia also favor wearing at least one black or partly-black garment during almost all of their screentime. Where the Evil comes in is that they're deliberately engineering Godzilla's rampage and all the loss of life it causes so they can murder Godzilla and take control of the Titans for their own desires, using Muggle Power to justify otherwise entirely selfish or Freudian Excuse motivations.
-   _The Mummy Returns_: Imhotep wears a Black Cloak for most of the film, before ditching it for a Walking Shirtless Scene.
-   _Night Nurse_: Nick, the child killing chauffeur, wears a daunting black (almost Gestapo-looking) uniform.
-   _A Perfect Murder_: Murderous Steven always dresses in black whereas his wife Emily whom he intends to have killed is usually dressed in white.
-   In _Pirates of the Caribbean_, it's played straightest with Blackbeard. Other evil characters, notably Ian Mercer, have largely black outfits, but _everything_ Blackbeard wears matches his facial hair.
-   _The Princess_: Big Bad Julius wears a lot of black, as do many of his men.
-   _Prom Night (1980)_: During the third act, the killer wears all-black clothes to blend in with the dark environment of a school after-hours: a black shirt, matching slacks and shoes, and a glittery black ski mask.
-   _Raiders of the Lost Ark_: Sadistic Torture Technician Toht wears a black suit and matching longcoat and hat as his main ensemble, even in the broiling Egyptian desert.
-   _Red Sonja_: The villain's army wears black armour, complete with Spikes of Villainy.
-   _Replicant_: Serial killer Edward "The Torch" Garrote dresses in all black clothes, whereas his 'good' clone is dressed in more heroic colors like blue and brown.
-   _Rolli – Amazing Tales_: The Trashers all wear black cloaks that resemble waste bags as well as black helmets/hats.
-   _Savages Crossing_: Serial killer Phil wears a dirty black suit.
-   In _Scanner Cop II_, Carl Volkin is notably the only villain in this entire series to go around entirely in black.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   The Sith wear black cloaks, and Darth Vader wears all black. The "good" Jedi prefer brown robes and white tunics.
    -   Averted by Luke in _Return of the Jedi_, though he was embracing his inner darkness and defeating it. Played with later in that when he rejects the Dark Side, his shirt is torn and the white underneath is exposed.
    -   Imperial uniforms go back and forth on this. At the top are Darth Vader and the Emperor, who do indeed wear black. Below them are the officer corps, who favour a dark grey. Below them are the white-armoured Stormtroopers and the black-armoured TIE Pilots. First Order forces in _The Force Awakens_ add shiny chrome armour for high-ranking stormtroopers and paint the TIE fighters black.
    -   The color motifs in _Star Wars_ (at least in _A New Hope_) seem to reflect the Magic Versus Science conflict more so than simple morality. While the Empire wears washed-out, clinical whites, blacks and grays that reflect their dependence on technology, characters like Luke and Obi-Wan wear warmer brown and cream colors to reflect their connection to nature through the Force. This was before the prequels flanderized Jedi and Sith cultures at least, having all the Jedi dress exactly like Obi-Wan, and all the Sith decked out in black robes.
-   In _Superman II_, the Terrible Trio of Ursa, Non, and General Zod all wore black, contrasting with the white of other Kryptonians, and Superman's Primary-Color Champion outfit. Zod's outfit also has very dark red metallic accents.
-   The killer in _Valentine_ wears a black coat with matching gloves and slacks, which creates a disconcerting effect when coupled with his Fallen Cupid mask.
-   In the western comedy _The Villain_, the eponymous outlaw Cactus Jack Slade wears black.
-   The eponymous villain in _Warlock (1989)_ is the only character to wear completely black attire, which only makes his blond hair more noticeable.
-   In _Warlock: The Armageddon_ the next Warlock kills a side character and steals his clothing, noting with approval that it's black.
-   Judge Doom sports a black suit, hat and sunglasses in _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_. Pretty on-the-nose, but Toons aren't exactly known for subtlety...
-   _Willow_: All of Bavmorda's men wear black armour. General Kael complements his with a scary bone mask.
-   In all _Winnetou_ film-of-the-book movies. Winnetou wears beige clothes with blue ornaments and Old Shatterhand wears light brown clothes. All the bandits wear very dark clothes, and one item is usually black, be it a hat, trousers or a shirt. The main antagonist tends to have a completely black outfit in each part of the movie series, though perhaps not for all his scenes. In _Winnetou I_, Old Shatterhand and Winnetou are not friends yet and Old Shatterhand has to fight with the Apaches. He wears a sky blue shirt, and his friends sport bright colours as well. It was crystal clear he's a good guy, and not only because it's a prequel to _Treasure of Silver Lake_ and everybody in Germany and Eastern Europe knows that those two pals are Heterosexual Life-Partners.
-   In _The Wizard of Oz_ the Wicked Witch of the West wears black. This is in contrast to Glinda the "good" witch we meet who wears pink.
-   Azazel in _X-Men: First Class_ wears a black suit at all times. His boss Sebastian Shaw alternates between white suits and black suits, as well as a black Nehru jacket.

    Literature 

-   _Alien Hunters_: The skelkrins are a race of tall, red-skinned aliens who wear black armor covered in spikes. They also happen to be very hostile and desire to rule over or wipe out all other species in the galaxy.
-   _Deryni_: Deryni Alaric Morgan (a good guy with 0% Approval Rating) deliberately wears all black. The fact it is his heraldic color doesn't excuse him.
-   In _Discworld_, black is the required color for members of the Assassins' Guild, whose members have included the very evil Teatime and the Anti-Villain Lord Vetinari, who still wears shabby black robes. Though the trope is played with as the Guild are sometimes shown as neutral, a source of Black Comedy, or even an actual force for good in the world. It's also averted by the witches, who wear black (well, Magrat and Tiffany don't) but are even more of a force for good in the world.
-   The Vitalizer from "Clockpunk and the Vitalizer" is dressed head to toe in black, save his gray mask. Contrast Clockpunk, also wearing black (though lined with silver).
-   _Honor Harrington_: In _Shadows of Freedom_, one (solarian) character is somewhat amused by the tendency of repressive dictatorships to outfit their jackbooted thugs in all black uniforms. This is also a bit of Hypocritical Humor, since the Solarian League's own jackbooted enforcers, the Gendarmerie, wear black uniforms too.
-   Firmly averted in _The Lord of the Rings_ (and Tolkien's Legendarium more generally): although Sauron's forces often wear black, black is also the traditional colour of Gondor.
-   _The Quest of the Unaligned_:
    -   Crown Prince Alaric wears a black security uniform and has black hair, despite being The Hero. This Word of God post confirms that this was an explicit and deliberate Inverted Trope.
    -   Gaithim wears a black robe and is a hoshek or mage of Darkness.
-   In _The Wheel of Time_, all the myrddraal wear black, as do some of the Forsaken, most notably Ishamael and Semirhage. Inverted by a couple of the _other_ Forsaken, Lanfear and Demandred, the former of whom wears white and silver all the time, and the latter of whom shows up for the Last Battle decked out in armor of those colors.
-   In the _Magister Trilogy_, pure black is the symbol of the titular Magisters, as a pure black can only be created by magic, and no witch would waste precious _athra_ to dye their clothes. So only the Magisters, who steal _athra_ from others to survive and fuel their powers, can afford to wear black.
-   In _The Cloak Society,_ the titular supervillain group naturally wears black uniforms (with silver embellishments). Also Played for Laughs—Alex wears civilian clothes when he sneaks out to meet the superhero Kirbie, but she jokes that he still only ever wears black, something that Alex had not even noticed. The third time he's about to leave and realizes that he's _still_ in all-black, so he digs around his dresser until he finds a shirt that "looked a little lighter than the others."
-   _City of Bones_ by Martha Wells: Charisat's condemned criminals, including the Warder-turned-lunatic-murderer Constans, are made to wear black, though Constans and his acolytes do it as a badge of pride. Subverted when Constans turns out to be correct about the main conflict and the white-robed Warders are shown to be Unwitting Pawns of a major villain.
-   The Inner Party members in _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ wear black boiler suits and are the tyrannical leading minds of Oceania, while the lower-ranked and more oblivious Outer Party members wear blue boiler suits.
-   _Bazil Broketail_: Padmasa's human soldiers wear black uniforms, along with its sorcerers.
-   _The Chronicles of Dorsa_: The Order of Taghren witch assassins all wear black, living in service to the books' main villain.
-   _Tales of the Ketty Jay_. An Invoked Trope by Trinica Dracken, who's given herself white hair and pale skin, which along with her all-black outfit and black contact lenses gives her a ghoulish appearance. Having clawed her way up from Sex Slave to Sky Pirate captain, she believes her beauty has only brought her pain, and the mostly male pirates would instinctively undermine an attractive female leader, so she makes herself a figure of fear and awe instead.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Arrow_. Oliver Queen wears a green outfit (in homage to his mentor Yao Fei, who trained him on a jungle island) even though it's pointed out that black would blend in better. So naturally his Season One Evil Counterpart the Dark Archer wears black in contrast, later revealed to be the standard outfit of the League of Assassins. The trope is then zigzagged over the course of the series as both heroes and villains wear black. The Black Canary wears all black leather, but Sara Lance started off as a former League of Assassins Dark Action Girl, and anyone who takes up the Canary mantle copies her style. Scenes where Thea Queen is drawn to her supervillain father Malcolm Merlyn will usually have her wearing black clothes, as opposed to her black-and-red superhero outfit. And in _Crisis on Earth-X_ Oliver finds himself up against the Dark Arrow, an evil Nazi version of himself backed by plenty of black-clad Gasmask Mooks.
-   _Blackadder_, Prince Edmund Plantagenet and Duke of Edinburgh adapts an all-black outfit once he becomes The Black Adder. Most of his descendants likewise attire themselves in black, though much of the time they are just Jerkasses and some characters that are easier to define as flat out ''evil'' are not dressed in black or even dark colors. In fact, the fourth one is never seen in black, rather wearing a soldier's tan uniform.
-   _Blake's 7_. The Federation Gas Mask Mooks wear black overalls, black gasmasks and carry black weaponry. Travis wears all black leather, and even when he's forced to leave the military is usually seen wearing black clothes. Avon, the most morally ambiguous member of the heroes, is often seen in black leather as well. However it was deliberately averted by actress Jacqueline Pearce who decided to have Servalan, the Big Bad of the series, wear white (though she changes to black halfway through the series).
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Evil Faith wears black outfits.
    -   When Xander and Willow become vampires in Wish!verse, they wear black leather. When the real Willow pretends to be vampire!Willow she steals the latter's black clothes. Also, in the last three episodes of Season Six, Willow dons black clothes and "dyes" her hair black as she embraces black magic.
    -   Caleb, The Dragon in Season 7, wears black as he's a fallen priest. However, he also points out that it's slimming.
-   _Charmed_: The sheer majority of demons on the show are basically human-looking goons who throw Fireballs and wear black. In fact, pick any episode and there's a good chance the Monster of the Week is a (usually male) demon or warlock in black clothing.
-   _Community_:
    -   In "A Fistful of Paintballs", a mysterious shooter called only the Black Rider appears, "network television handsome" guy played by Josh Holloway dressed in all black with badass stuff like a black cowboy hat or bandolier with paintball bullets who takes one student after another. He was hired by the City College, Greendale's nemesis.
    -   There is a Running Gag that Abed keeps referring to six timelines that were created when Jeff used rolling a dice to decide who will go to get pizza. In the darkest timeline, they all wear black, which was at first a sign of mourning. Later the study group turns evil and they transform into supervillains who wear black, mostly leather. Abed is still a good guy underneath, but he looks like the others and wears a long black robe. His look is completed with a black evil goatie.
-   _Doctor Who_ Classic:
    -   The Master as portrayed by Roger Delgado and Anthony Ainley wears all-black unless he's in disguise. Even the Master's TARDIS console room is identical to the Doctor's, but with black surfaces.
    -   The villain in "The Five Doctors" deliberately changes into black clothes when putting his evil plot into action.
-   The Peacekeepers from _Farscape_ wear black armour or uniform. The villain Scorpius is dressed all in black, as well.
-   This is very common among evil speedsters in _The Flash (2014)_.
    -   Eobard Thawne still wears a yellow Reverse-Flash costume like his comic book counterpart, but it has black leggings and gloves on the show. When out of costume, he almost exclusively wears black.

-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Intimidating Tywin Lannister, the patriarch of House Lannister, wears black, mostly leather with metal accents. It's especially notable since his family colours are red and gold which is how his children usually dress. He's one of the main antagonists to House Stark who are more of heroes with just cause.
    -   Tywin's daughter Cersei Lannister abandons her family colours for some black leather numbers that look a lot like Distaff Counterpart versions of what her father wore when she commits mass murder by destroying the Sept of Baelor and crowning herself Queen Regnant.
-   In _Good Omens (2019)_, the demon Crowley (although he's more a Noble Demon than a truly evil one) always wears black clothes in contrast with the angel Aziraphale who always wears white or beige-colored clothes.
-   _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_:
    -   Ares, god of destructive war, favors a black leather get-up.
    -   Any and all servants of Hera (an antagonist to Hercules) are most likely wearing black leather and skull-motif armor.
-   Big Bad Rufus in _House of Anubis_ wears the same black coat, black turtle neck and black pants in virtually all his appearances.
-   _Kamen Rider Ex-Aid_ loves this trope:
    -   Early on, the heroes are menaced by a villain who looks like a black version of the title character, and simply refer to him as "the black Ex-Aid" before they finally learn his name: Kamen Rider Genm, AKA Kuroto Dan, president of Genm Corporation and supposedly their ally.
    -   Later in the series, the Big Bad Kamen Rider Cronus gets two of the heroes to Face–Heel Turn and join his side. One of them (Hiiro Kagami/Kamen Rider Brave) switches from his white lab coat to a black business suit; the other (Kiriya Kujo/Kamen Rider Lazer) wears a black version of his normal clothing and gains a new Rider form with more black armor pieces.
        -   Hiiro later turns out to be an inversion as Cronus gives him a new Super Mode that's predominantly white and gold with an angelic motif; ironically, his last Super Mode had a "demon king" motif and used darker colors like maroon and black because it represented a Fallen Hero, while this new one represents the same hero finding redemption and becoming good again.
    -   Subverted with Taiga Hanaya, so-called Dark Doctor, who wears black military clothes or black scrubs. He starts out as Jerkass with a massive ego, but time and Morality Pet softens him into Jerk with a Heart of Gold. He went through so much crap that pretending to be a jerk is essentially his way of keeping it together.
    -   Parado wears a black coat and mostly acts like a Psychopathic Manchild operating on Blue-and-Orange Morality. Another Ending movie trilogy has Another Parado, his Evil Twin <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  whose outfit is a Palette Swap that turns it completely black.

-   In _Power Rangers in Space_ the surviving Psycho Rangers briefly take on (never before seen) human form. To remind us that they're evil, they're wearing black leather jackets and black pants. And colored undershirts so we know which one is which, so Psycho Black is wearing _only_ black.
-   _Star Trek_
    -   While various Villain of the Week types wear black, there's also a low-key version in Alternate Reality Episodes where the protagonists are portrayed as evil, so wear dark undershirts and black gloves (see VOY "Living Witness") or black assault vests (see ENT "In A Mirror, Darkly") with their standard Starfleet uniforms.
    -   _Star Trek: Picard_: Romulan siblings Narek and Narissa (when she's not posing as a Starfleet officer) are always dressed in black, and they're Zhat Vash operatives.

    black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac  
    the boy's a time bomb.
    

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Face or Heel, a demonic gravedigger like The Undertaker definitely qualifies.

-   The Oakland Raiders were long considered the "bad guys" of the NFL, and of course they wear black.

    Tabletop Games 

-   When it comes to wizards in _Dragonlance_, the Black Robes are, by definition, evil (they draw their magic from the dark moon of Nuitari, the god of evil magic), and are contrasted with the Red Robes of neutrality and White Robes of good... though, that having been said, this in no way hinders some Black Robes from being surprisingly decent people, and their general tendency towards Pragmatic Villainy (encouraging that over other kinds of villainy is one of the main reasons they are tolerated) has made Black Robes the Token Evil Teammate of good groups more than once.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Black Legion, arguably the most powerful and evil Chaos Space Marine Legion whose color of choice is written on their name.
    -   The Slaanesh-devoted Emperor's Children, whose colors are black and... hideous hot pink (or purple Depending on the Artist). Due to centuries of self-inflicted sensory abuse, clashing colors are one of the few things that still grab their attention.
    -   Averted by the Deathwatch (the Imperium's elite anti-xenos Space Marine squads who forgo their Chapter colors for all-black armor) and the Black Templars, who are firmly on the side of good—on the Imperium's side.

    Theatre 

-   Played with in the 2008 _Chess in Concert_. The Soviets are coded black and the Americans white, and the protagonist, Anatoly, is Soviet, so black is good, or neutral at worst. At least for the first act. Anatoly defects late in Act I, and the Soviets are the antagonists from that point onward, so black is evil. This is pointed up by the fact that Viigand, the Soviet antagonist of Act II, wears the exact same shades of black that Anatoly wore in Act I.

    Toys 

-   The _G.I. Joe_ franchise has seen many versions of Destro and The Baroness wearing black. Many versions of Cobra Commander himself, including the Marvel comics in the He's Back! moment, have traded his blue outfits in for black versions.

    Video Games 

-   The Big Bad of _BlazBlue_, Yuuki Terumi, wears a black suit and hat as his alter ego Hazama, and keeps wearing the former under the orange cloak he's better known for. His true identity, Takehaya Susano'o-no-Mikoto, is an animated suit of black armor.
-   Some of the playable characters in _Death Smiles_ are, or used to be, evil, such as Casper and Sakura, who both wear black outfits.
-   In _Dragon Age II_, when Anders commits to a plan of blowing up the Kirkwall Chantry to incite all-out war between mages and Templars, his outfit changes from its normal colors to black.

-   _Fallout 3_, the evil mercenary armies of Talon Company wear a custom variant of Combat Armor painted black.
-   In _Final Fantasy IV_ Golbez wears variable dark blue or black armor Depending on the Artist. He continues to wear his dark armour even after his Heel–Face Turn.

-   In _Final Fantasy IX_, Evil Overlord Garland wears a futuristic suit of black armor with matching cape. This is in sharp contrast to Kuja being a man dressed in white.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_, Master Xehanort's clothing is primarily black and grey, while the members of the Organization wear black cloaks.

-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Team Rocket's members wear black with red "R" emblems, while Giovanni is depicted in the games wearing black suits. In the anime, he wore orange at first but switched to black in _Best Wishes_ when he and Team Rocket became major antagonists again.
    -   Jessie and James, two of the main antagonists of the anime adaptation, wore white uniforms and were mostly used as comical relief in the seasons before _Best Wishes_. In that season, they get noticeably more competent and evil, and of course, they switch to black clothing. When they switched back to their regular white-and-red uniforms, they get noticeably less competent.
    -   A faction split from Team Plasma in _Pokémon Black 2 and White 2_. In the original Gen 5 games, they weren't this, but since they split from the main group as they supported Ghetsis instead of N, they changed to be like so in the sequels as a way to show that they were now just blatantly evil and not even pretending to be Well Intentioned Extremists. It's especially blatant with Ghetsis's costume change in the same games too.
    -   Team Skull in _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ wear black clothing as well. Likely because they're not even trying to be remotely subtle, and pattern themselves off American gangs. Gladion is also this, due to working with them, though he's actually a good person the whole time.
    -   The Dark\-type, called the Evil-type in Japan, is made up of primarily black-colored Pokémon or Pokémon with at least a little black.

-   Albert Wesker from _Resident Evil_ doesn't start out wearing much black (in the first game and _Resident Evil 0_, his shirt is blue), but after betraying S.T.A.R.S., he starts dressing more like a villain. He wears a black combat uniform in _Resident Evil – Code: Veronica_, and a black suit in _Resident Evil 4_. He really starts embracing this trope in the fifth installment, with a longcoat made of pure black leather, as well as black inner getups, gloves, and boots. The only thing that isn't black would be his hair and his eyes.
-   In _Street Fighter_, Akuma by default wears either a black or dark purple gi. When Ryu becomes Evil Ryu, he's also depicted with a black gi (which becomes tattered in the fourth installment). M. Bison also wears a black cloak over his red outfit, although he tosses it off when the matches begin.

-   In _Gawayn_, the Duke's outfit is dominantly black.
-   Perhaps owing to his more evil nature, Hordak from _She-Ra: Princess of Power_ wears black armor with a red Horde symbol emblazoned on it, as opposed to his pupil Skeletor's purple harness. His sidekick Imp also wears similar outfit, though lacking the boney decorations.
-   In _The Smurfs (1981)_, Gargamel wears a black robe, in contrast to the (usually) white clothes(?) of the Smurfs, and the more colorful clothes of the good humans.
