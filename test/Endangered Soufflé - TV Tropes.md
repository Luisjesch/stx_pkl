No points for guessing what happens next.

_"Worry and doubt are the greatest enemies of a great chef. The soufflé will either rise or it won't; there's not a damn thing you can do about it, so you might as well just sit back and wait and see what happens."_

A trope that is little-used these days without actually being discredited, this could be found occasionally on Dom Coms up until the early 1970s, particularly those with child characters. A cook is attempting to bake a soufflé for a fancy party or important dinner. Unfortunately, they must do so under riotous circumstances, with a consequent paranoia about the soufflé collapsing. Naturally, some event — rambunctious children or a slamming door or a car backfiring — does indeed make the soufflé fall, thus "spoiling" the event.

Two variations on this trope exist: In one, the rambunctious behavior around the soufflé is quieted down with no ill effects, only to have a relatively-distant disturbance (slamming door, car backfire) collapse the soufflé after it is "safe" (the soufflé can be replaced by say, a sleeping baby). The other works much the same, except that it is the cook themself who triggers the collapse.

In reality, the only way to drop a soufflé into a puddle of goo is to:

1.  Open the oven prematurely (sponge cakes are also subject to this).
2.  Improperly construct it so that the fat in the yolk mixture destabilizes the foamy whites mixture. Refer to the relevant _Good Eats_ episode. What Alton Brown doesn't say, though, is that it is _laughably easy_ to do this, especially given mid-20th century ingredients and equipment, hence the origin of the trope in the zeitgeist.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Food Wars!_: During a challenge where the students are required to serve 200 servings of an egg-based dish within a time limit, Soma makes the nearly fatal mistake of serving soufflé omelettes that collapse way too quickly after they are made. He recovers by throwing away all the collapsed omelettes and turning the process of making the omelettes into a performance so that people will take them immediately after they are made.

    Comic Books 

-   Gaston Lagaffe once baked an enormous soufflé to cheer up his chronically depressed cousin. Initially it seems to work, but it collapses at a critical moment, resulting in the "most depressing sight ever." Probably justified, since Gaston is a Cordon Bleugh Chef often bordering on a Lethal Chef.

    Comic Strips 

-   One of the storylines of _MAD_'s "Monroe" has the titular loser try to impress a girl named Jolynda by making her a soufflé. However, since he's the universe's personal chewtoy, his delicate dessert is ruined by his brutish classmate, Dylan. Laughing, the bully strolls away with Jolynda in tow, leaving the poor antenna-haired teenager to stew in his culinary failure.
-   In _Beetle Bailey_, a similar thing is a recurring theme with Cookie's cakes, which can apparently be deflated by loud bangs when in the oven — he even has a cake of potential Guinness World Records size fail due to a massive simultaneous artillery practice barrage being initiated at the critical moment.
-   _Garfield_ has an aversion in a situation where there would be an actual danger in Real Life. Garfield appears to be watching a horror movie, covering his eyes at the "scary part" as someone on TV (not shown) opens a door with a "creeeeeeek" sound effect. In the last panel, Garfield sighs in relief as the person on TV... pulls out a "perfect soufflé".
-   Averted and discussed in one _Sherman's Lagoon_ strip, wherein Megan's confusion over managing to cook a soufflé without destroying it is cleared up when Sherman mentions a recent Cue the Flying Pigs moment.

    Fan Works 

-   Used straight but comedically in the notorious _Sith Academy_ Slash Fic series; the humor of the situation comes from the fact that the person baking the chocolate soufflé is Darth Maul, a vicious-minded Sith Lord who otherwise has the patience of a hyperactive weasel, while what causes it to collapse (and Maul to fly into a homicidal rage) is two Jedi Knights (Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn, as it happens) having noisy sex in the apartment next door.
-   Played rather straight for _Pinkie Pie Vs. The Soufflé_ in the _Triptych Continuum_. The focus of the story has Pinkie attempting to make the dish as her masterpiece: the creation which will prove she's no longer an 'apprentice' baker. It goes about as well as you'd expect on the first attempt. And beyond. It's implied that she's subconsciously sabotaging herself because she's not ready to stop being an apprentice, the first step to eventually leaving the Cakes.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Happens naturally to Audrey Hepburn in _Sabrina_ when she forgets to turn on the oven in the first place.
-   It happens with a cake in _Harriet the Spy_, only Harriet deliberately stomps and knocks over some chairs after the cook tells her to be quiet. Also in the original novel.
-   _Charlie's Angels (2000)_ has Lucy Liu's character Alex attempting to keep her soufflé intact while the trailer she's in is getting perforated with bullets. The soufflé never stood a chance.
    -   Ironically, it actually managed to survive the shoot-out... only to collapse at the sound of Alex's sigh of relief.
-   Appears in _How to Murder Your Wife_ with the wife's famous "lasagna soufflé". (It sounds improbable, but there actually is such a thing. It's popular in the Abruzzi, which perhaps is where Mrs. Ford is from.)
-   A recurring gag in the Shaquille O'Neal superhero movie _Steel_.
-   Averted in ABC's extended cut of _Superman II_. Supes is cooking a soufflé with his heat vision, and Lois stops him just in time.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    "You should never overcook a soufflé!"
    
-   In _Go West, Young Lady_, Bill is cooking a souffle when Tex arrives to propose. She warns him not to make any loud noises. After several near misses, she accepts, which causes Tex to whoop and charge out, slamming the door, which causes the souffle to fall. Bill makes another one, only to have this one fall when Killer Pete enters the dance hall and fires several shots into the ceiling.
-   A few _The Three Stooges_ shorts have the men bake a cake. After getting it out of the oven, one of them pokes it with a fork to check if it's done, causing it to deflate. To reflate it, they use the gas line from the oven, which sometimes causes it to float away. Those cakes are served as birthday cakes with candles, which of course leads to Stuff Blowing Up when the birthday person blows out the candles.

    Literature 

-   _Harriet the Spy_: Invoked. Harriet deliberately stomps in the middle of the floor to mess up the cake that the cook is making.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Beverly Hillbillies_: In "Back to Californy", Granny and Cousin Pearl become embroiled in a fight while each cooking a meal in the mansion's kitchen. Pearl purposely destroys Granny's cake by slamming the oven door. Pearl snidely tells Granny that her sweet potato pie is fall-proof. Granny takes out the pie and drops it on the floor!
-   _The Catherine Tate Show_ does this with a pair of new parents attending a dinner party and being forced to eat in the car for fear of waking the baby.
    
    "Are you insane? She's asleep — we can't _move_ her!"
    
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
    -   In "Sacrifice of Angels", when the station is under Dominion control, Quark and Ziyal try to bring a soufflé to a group of prisoners. Naturally, the guard demands to investigate it, and is only made further suspicious when Quark gets nervous and invokes this trope as the reason... giving Ziyal a chance to get behind him while he's distracted and knock him out with the Off-Button Hypospray, causing his head to fall into the soufflé and crush it. Quark briefly expresses regret for his soufflé, but gets over it since it _was_ only meant as a decoy and therefore served its purpose.
    -   Also referenced by Sisko, when he relates to how his father used to say: "Worry and doubt are the greatest enemies of a great chef. The soufflé will either rise or it won't; there's not a damn thing you can do about it, so you might as well just sit back and wait and see what happens."
-   Subverted with Seven of Nine in _Star Trek: Voyager_, who tried to make a soufflé to cheer up Neelix. "The soufflé has collapsed somewhat, but its nutritional content remains intact."
-   In _The Brady Bunch_, Alice keeps trying to shush the kids and then collapses the soufflé herself by knocking over a pan with a loud crash.
-   An episode of _Are You Being Served?_ had the opposite problem, in which Mr. Humphries was trying to hold down a soufflé that was growing out of control.
-   In the _MasterChef_ semi-finals, the contestants had to make a chocolate soufflé. Whitney, the eventual winner had a case of both Carrying a Cake and Endangered Soufflé as she had to hurry and present the soufflé to the judges as the soufflé slowly sank.
    -   Similarly, one episode of _MasterChef Junior_ involved baking a soufflé using dark chocolate, milk chocolate, strawberries, or blackberries. Addison's blackberry soufflé won the challenge, but Zac's milk chocolate soufflé collapsed because he didn't whisk the egg whites properly.
-   In one episode of _My Three Sons_, "Happy Birthday, World," son Robbie tries to earn extra money by setting up a home business making birthday cakes. At one point, while he's making a set of cakes, a door is slammed in the house and causes the three cakes in the oven to collapse.
-   _The Golden Girls_:
    -   Although the soufflé in question is never seen (technically, it was some kind of cake with a very complicated name), in the episode where Rose is revealed to have a dependency on painkillers, she has violent mood swings when her prescription runs out; a local producer is trying to film a commercial in the kitchen with Sophia, and Rose comes in and tears him a new one for endangering the soufflé that no one knew she was making.
        -   Could this have been a Shout-Out to the _MTM_ episode mentioned below?
    -   Season 4, "The Impotence of Being Ernest," they get it in a restaurant and it figures into a boner joke. So the real soufflé rises but the metaphorical one doesn't.
-   _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_: Cloris Leachman's character Phyllis deliberately collapses a soufflé Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White) is baking when Phyllis finds out about Nivens' affair with her husband.
-   Played with in an episode of _The Nanny_; Niles has just been told that the very complex meal he's been killing himself making is now worthless because their guest is recovering from a heart attack and needs a special menu. When Max opens the door and asks what smells so good, Niles snaps: "Oh, just a chocolate soufflé that's been rising. Don't need that." (Slams the oven door closed **HARD** with his foot.)
-   Oswin in the _Doctor Who_ episode "Asylum of the Daleks" keeps trying and failing to make a soufflé. Turns out it was just a fantasy in her mind and the soufflés were a subliminal reminder that she had been transformed into a Dalek ("Eggs-stir-min-ate").
-   In one episode of _Mission: Impossible_, Barney (in his cover as the villain's cook) used this as an excuse to explain why the guards could not search the kitchen at this time (Thus granting him, Willy, and Cinnamon time to hide their equipment before the search).
-   In a _Charmed (1998)_ episode, Piper is baking a soufflé. When Leo walks in, speaking loudly, Piper threatens to blow him up if her soufflé falls.
-   Averted in series 6 of _The Great British Bake Off_: The semifinal technical challenge was a chocolate soufflé, and while there were some issues all the soufflés made it to judging un-collapsed.
-   Inverted in the _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ episode "Switching Places", where Billy (in Kimberly's body after Squatt tampered with his mind-reading machine) makes a cheese soufflé that explodes instead.
-   _3rd Rock from the Sun_: In the third season finale, everyone starts yelling and running around after Harry is kidnapped by Vicki Dubcek's ex-boyfriend. In the middle of the commotion, Tommy runs out of the kitchen to complain that the noise has caused his soufflé to collapse.

    Puppet Shows 

-   In the Marisa Berenson episode of _The Muppet Show_, the Swedish Chef makes a wedding cake for Miss Piggy's Real Fake Wedding which is "light as a feather". It collapses when the Chef puts the Miss Piggy on top of it.
    -   A variation from a different sketch: The Swedish Chef's soufflé comes out of the oven so light it actually _floats into the air_. He shoots an arrow at it in an attempt to get it to fall down. It falls down, all right... in both senses of the word.
-   _Wimzie's House:_ Ya Ya tries to bake a soufflé at a time when Wimzie is sick. Unfortunately, Wimzie has to use a loud blowhorn to get attention and that causes Ya Ya's soufflé to collapse.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

Later, when Timmy makes a wish that everyone and everything were the same, the world goes grey-scale, and everyone becomes identical blobs. Cosmo and Wanda can't find Timmy until he recreates his trademark pink hat using another of his mother's collapsed soufflés, which was supposed to be grey.

-   _Arthur_:
    -   The episode "Arthur's Family Feud" involves either Arthur or D.W. destroying their dad's soufflé by making it fall... off the table and onto the floor, that is.

The bulk of the episode involves their dispute over who was to blame for it.

-   On an episode of _The Flintstones_ Fred does this when he opens the oven while trying to retrieve a diamond ring that got baked into the cake.
-   One of the winter _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_ shorts puts a more realistic spin on the threat of this: Pinkie Pie is attempting to get a soufflé to Rarity, an endeavor which has failed in the past because she was too slow and the pastry collapsed when it cooled down too much. On top of this, she has to get it through a massive snowball fight in her front yard: as Sunset Shimmer realizes, one hit and the soufflé is done for.
-   In the _Total Drama_ episode "If You Can't Take The Heat", Lindsay and Gwen are put in charge of the citrus-macadamia upside-down cake flambé for the cooking challenge, but they pour too much flammable liquid on it and Heather's attempt to light it ends up burning off her eyebrows.

-   In _Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers_, the characters are chasing the villains through a television studio. They disrupt a cooking show, and this becomes a Discussed Trope because they destroy the soufflé before it can even be put in the oven.
