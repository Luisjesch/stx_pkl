_"...that class of poor and honourable gentlemen. Their ancestors had attained nobility through some warlike deed. They grew up as sons of valiant squires, who themselves were accustomed to country life and the hunt. From the age of twelve they conditioned themselves to every kind of hardship sleeping in the woods with their dogs, arresting poachers, and fighting every now and then with a neighbor's son over the possession of a hare."_

— **Christopher Duffy**, _The Military Experience in the Age of Reason_

These guys are considered the model military officers. Most forms of media will typically portray the Officer and a Gentleman as being a member of the upper-class in whatever society he originates, and almost undoubtedly attended a Military Academy. If this character is a British officer (or speaking with an English accent), you can often tell whether he is an officer and a gentleman because he will almost invariably speak with a Received Pronunciation (i.e., the Queen’s English). If he's American, he will either be a Southern Gentleman with a soft voice but pronounced Tidewater or Dixie accent (especially if in the Army), or a Northeastern gent with Mid-Atlantic tones (particularly in the Navy). If he is German or French, expect the preposition _von_ or _de_ on his surname. It is _very likely_ he has generations of military traditions and an unbroken lineage of soldiers in his family, and his genetic ancestors may have been knights in shining armour.

Besides typically being a member of the upper crust, an officer and gentleman is personified by his behavior: No matter how savage the fighting, no matter how pitiless the combat, the officer almost never lets his base nature take over. He will remain polite, and even in the worst of situations will always retain his sense of propriety, often unfailingly displaying a Stiff Upper Lip. If a more clever sort, he may be a Gentleman Snarker. After all, a gentleman is not a mere label, but a way of life.

For example, an officer and a gentleman will rarely if ever cuss, and never knowingly in the presence of a lady. He will rarely drink to the point of inebriation, unless it is used for comedic purposes or to tragically show how the war may be taking a toll on him. He would never, ever take advantage of a lady, and will be very protective of women, both of their persons and their sensibilities, even when it is not merited. Further, if you insult his honour, or worse, the honour of a lady he fancies, you may earn yourself a challenge to a duel, unless profuse apology is the next thing out of your mouth. Otherwise, expect a fair, gentlemanly duel in which he will proceed to carve you into cutlets. However, he would not think of fighting dirty, and most certainly Would Not Shoot a Civilian on purpose. On the other hand, if he is evil, he might have some of his less honourable henchmen do the Dirty Business for him. Further, whether good or bad, he will always keep his word… after all, he gave his word as a gentleman. Characters typifying this trope often have the habit, for better or worse, of displaying Honour Before Reason. Expect him to be A Father to His Men. Likely a Cultured Badass, especially when Rank Scales with Asskicking is in play.

Do not misunderstand—this fellow can be just as deadly as any other warrior; often more so, because one aspect that is often used with this trope is the fact that the more experienced officers are typically very composed and often have Nerves of Steel, making them less likely to act irrationally or misstep. However, while his training and experience may have forged him into a very skilled fighter, he will rarely be a Combat Pragmatist, and can often fall victim to more unsporting chaps.

When it comes to actual leadership ability, the Officer and a Gentleman runs the gamut. If portrayed in a good light, the officer will be shown as being a Reasonable Authority Figure, like The Brigadier, and if he takes pains to look out for his soldier’s wellbeing, he is A Father to His Men. In a really positive light, they may be shown to be great front-line leaders and warriors as well, playing the role of Colonel or General Badass. If they are being portrayed in a negative light, they will be the Blood Knight, Nazi Nobleman, General Ripper, or The Neidermeyer. If they are cruel and/or incompetent, they will most likely be portrayed as a Colonel Kilgore or General Failure. While these more negative incarnations may be just as dedicated to politeness and etiquette as the good ones, their good behavior is reserved for their superiors and people of proper social rank, rather than the rabble of men they lead. Further, the evil officer would not hesitate saying "We Have Reserves." After all, the only ones whose lives are at risk are the commoner soldiers, and who cares about them?

Remember, what separates this character from the Proud Warrior Race Guy or the Warrior Poet is not only the character’s devotion to honour but to a set of "gentlemanly" principles, which include good manners and etiquette. Most representations of the officer and gentleman are most certainly Lawful Good or at least Lawful Neutral. If on the side of the antagonists, or the major antagonist himself, he will often be Lawful Evil, or likewise Lawful Neutral if meant to be sympathetic, and is often portrayed as an Anti-Villain. Satirical versions of this trope are often represented as being Lawful Stupid.

Compare with Knight Errant and Knight in Shining Armor. Contrast Up Through the Ranks (for an officer who isn't a gentleman) and Gentlemen Rankers (when a gentleman isn't an officer). Compare and Contrast The Gunslinger, who is often considered a more pragmatic, if otherwise similar character. If during peacetime the Officer and a Gentleman was an academic, then he is a Gentleman and a Scholar. If there's focus on the gentleman part then he follows the code of Old-School Chivalry.

The trope shares the same name with the 1982 film _An Officer and a Gentleman_ (starring Richard Gere and Deborah Winger), but the term "an officer and a gentleman" itself actually predates the film.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Berserk_: Roderick of Schtauffen, the "Sailing Prince of Iith" is an aristocratic and educated naval captain who excels in warfare. He never fails to be fair, courteous, and polite, especially towards ladies.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, Major Armstrong lives this trope, especially compared to the behavior of most of the other officers in the Amestrian Army, who range from sexist pigs, shameless flirts, Badass Briggs soldiers and pencil-necked stiffs, with the occasional psychopath thrown into the mix.
-   _Ghost in the Shell_: Major Kusanagi can be an Officer _or_ a Lady. She can be very kind and blends in perfectly with high society but doesn't hold back her badassitude in combat.
-   _Hellsing_:
    -   Pip Bernadotte is a lot more cultured than most of the men in his squad. And he is the heroine's love interest. Also counts as a Chivalrous Pervert.
    -   The Captain fits this trope too.

-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_, OZ, the special forces unit that overthrows the world government to change the destiny of the human species, strives for its leaders to be this—at least, when they're not being slaughtered by the Gundam pilots. Its unfailingly-cultured and chivalrous commander, Treize Khushrenada, is this in spades accordingly, even amid his scheming and plotting.
-   Albert James Moriarty of _Moriarty the Patriot_ is one of the only genuinely well-meaning Blue Blood characters, and he works a Lieutenant Colonel in the army before his retirement to head MI6, using his soldiers to help rescue his brother William in a chessmastered ploy to create the secret service and use it to help Britain.
-   To a degree, Hiroshi Yagyuu and Yuushi Oshitari from _The Prince of Tennis_.
-   2nd Lt. Alice L. Malvin in _Pumpkin Scissors_ has very definite ideas on what it means to be the daughter of one of "the thirteen noble families". The example she sets shames other, less principled members of the privileged class and impresses poor commoners outraged by the nobility's excesses.
-   Several characters in _Strike Witches_ and its associated media. Heinrike Prinzessin zu Sayn-Wittgenstein being the most prominent example, Karlsland ace with noble Orussian heritage.
-   Sir Allen Schezar in the _The Vision of Escaflowne_ has this kind of quality, being a well-spoken, clean-shaved gentleman commanding a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits. He seems rather chauvinistic at times to his love interests (Princess Millerna and Hitomi), though this is somewhat explained through his tragic backstory because Allen is pretty screwed up after he failed to protect three women he very much cared for: his mother (dead), his younger sister Selena (kidnapped and tortured by Zaibach, to the point of her becoming someone else), and his first love Marlenne (married King Freyr, had Allen as her lover and the father of her kid Chid _unbeknownst to Allen_, died too). To top it all, he heavily blames his Disappeared Dad for abandoning their family… not knowing that Leon Schezar had died many years ago. To his credit, he gets better and is reunited with his sister.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Arrowsmith_ Fletcher thinks he should be one, but he's not, and neither are the other airmen. Later, the trope is defied in no uncertain terms.
    
    **Fletcher:** I'm not a gentleman, all right? My father's a blacksmith!
    
-   While Garth Ennis _Battlefields_ comics often portray officers as sleazy Armchair Military there are exceptions.
    -   The tank officers in_Tankies_ are selfless but refuse to risk their men unfairly. Their general understands this and so he and his aide take a walk near the range of enemy artillery while chatting about bird watching to inspire the others to make the (ultimately successful) charge.
    -   The squadron leader in _Happy Valley_ is a reserved, Reasonable Authority Figure whose final scene has him stating that he can't send the Diary of a slain hero home to his family (as it includes classified maneuvers) but he can wait until the end of the war to present it once that is no longer classified rather than just destroy the diary.
-   Captain America has his own special ranking within the US military and is considered one of the most gentlemanly of all the heroes in the Marvel Universe. It's not uncommon for even the bad guys to look up to him.
-   _Dastardly & Muttley_: Dick describes himself and "an officer and a gentleman"
-   Hans von Hammer, from the _Enemy Ace_ comics from DC Comics, is the epitome of the trope.
    -   His most notable aspect, apart from working for the other side, is not shooting down already damaged aircraft. A straight-on duel, yes, plinking the defenseless, no.
        -   Making it Truth in Comic Books. In the early days of military aviation, fighter pilots had complex rules of chivalry which included "never shoot a cripple."
-   _Wonder Woman_: While Steve Trevor is rarely a "gentleman" by birth he's nearly always one by action and tends to be a high ranking military officer by the end of his service.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Steve is quickly promoted to being a USAAF officer and won over Diana and the Holliday Girls with his respect and humility.
    -   _The Legend of Wonder Woman (2016)_: Steve Trevor and Lawrence Stone are both USAAF pilots who are very respectful lieutenants who get promotions for their actions, though Steve feels his is undeserved. They are gentlemen by their honorable and polite actions not by class, as they are Americans from lower-middle-class families.

    Fan Works 

-   Britt Reid from _The Green Hornet_ fanfic _Bad Medicine_ is a graduate of West Point Academy and a former Army Captain who served two tours in Afghanistan (which is how he met Kato). He puts the skills he's learned in the Army to good use as the Green Hornet but also retains a sense of honor. He even invokes the words 'as an officer and a gentleman' to get someone he's trying to protect to trust him.
-   The protagonist Asher Walters becomes this in later chapters of The Chronicles of Utopia. Enlisted in Veluna's army, he is given officer training and becomes a battalion commander who looks after his men and followers a fairly strict code of conduct, though he is not afraid of using illusion and trickery to confuse and demoralize the enemy.

-   _The Guardians of Childhood_: General Kozmotis Pitchiner is usually portrayed this way, which makes what he later becomes all the more tragic.

-   The character of Lieutenant Phillip Holtack, and other British officer types described in, A.A. Pessimal's _Slipping Between Worlds_. Holtack is a fairly typical product of officer training in the recently modern British Army, a largely easy-going liberally-minded young man, content to leave most of the command and disciplinary stuff to a far more experienced platoon sergeant, considerate to his men and despairingly protective of the rogue and villain Fusilier "Head-Butt" Powell. Abruptly uprooted to a strange and foreign place, he has to work out quickly just how big a bastard he needs to be to survive, but he is still a good-mannered well-brought-up young man who, even without complete awareness of what lady Assassins and female Vampires are capable of, still treats them as a gentleman should… he has also been exposed to hostility and extreme opinions by his right-on feminist sister's associates, but _still_ manages to treat even Greenham Common types with politeness and common respect.

    Film — Animation 

-   Skipper, leader of the penguins in _Madagascar_ (both in the movies and in the TV spin-off) has some of these qualities. He is a lot more cultured than the rest of the commando penguins, generally courteous towards ladies, and also pulls off the craziest stunts. Case in point: "No little girl will shed a tear on my watch!" from "What Goes Around."
-   Captain Amelia of _Treasure Planet_ fits this trope perfectly right down to the upper-class British accent and Stiff Upper Lip, blending it with sharp Gentleman Snarker wit, Lady of War badassery, and Ice Queen unattainability (eventually defrosted).

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Major West in _28 Days Later_ _initially_ appears to be this sort of character — a civilized, erudite gentleman in contrast to his lewd, boisterous underlings. Then he agrees to let his men gang-rape the female civilians they've "rescued". And seems a wee bit fond of Jim, as well. And then, when Jim brutally slaughters all of his men, he abandons what little of his civilized side he has left and goes completely insane.
-   In _Appointment with Venus_, Major Valentine Mooreland is never less than perfectly composed and unfailingly polite despite the odd nature of his mission—having to rescue a pregnant cow from a Nazi-occupied island— and having to work with a squad that includes a female civilian and a drunken naval officer. Of course, given he is portrayed by David Niven, this should come as a surprise to no one.
-   From _The Avengers (2012)_, the good Captain America qualifies. He's less upper-crust and more the ideal American Boy Next Door type; however, he makes up for that with his keen intelligence and artistic talent. He's unfailingly polite to every woman he meets - he shields Black Widow instead of himself or Hawkeye during battle, and he pretty much gets lip-raped by a random secretary because he can't figure out how to turn down her advances without being rude. He _will_ do anything to help a friend, even go on what basically amounts to a suicide mission, _alone._ The only time we see him drinking heavily is when said friend dies later on - and even then, his hyperactive metabolism won't let him get drunk. He plays The Spock to Iron Man's The McCoy (and challenges Iron Man to a one-on-one fistfight, not over a woman, but because Tony's being the consummate douchebag we all know and love). And the only time we hear him swear is when he's vehemently _ordering_ his love interest (who outranks him) to get the hell outta Dodge before she's shot down by anti-aircraft artillery. Damn.
-   _Flowers of War_: Colonel Hasegawa of the Imperial Japanese Army is a cultured officer who puts a stop to the slaughter at the convent by having guards posted outside. Appealing to his humanity only goes so far, however, as John finds out. While Hasegawa is better than most Japanese soldiers and may even have personal misgivings about the way the war in China is being fought, his sense of duty compels him to carry out his orders to have the convent girls taken away to become sex slaves for his superiors.
-   _Forbidden Planet_: While his crew openly lusted after Altaira, Commander Adams was chastising her for her overt and provocative behavior. Granted, the only male she ever had contact with prior to the arrival of the C57D was her father, so her social skills in this area were decidedly undeveloped. And, of course, it was Commander Adams she ultimately fell in love with.
-   Colonel Robert Gould Shaw from _Glory_. Also a Real Life example.
-   _Greyhound_: The _Keeling_'s commanding officer Commander Ernest Krause; a Reasonable Authority Figure who is fair to his crew, only demanding that two that got into a fight explain their actions, but is called to the bridge before he can mete out discipline so lets the matter drop, does not swear and doesn't allow it in his presence, is quick to give credit where it is due and perhaps more importantly does not blame his men for things that go wrong if it's out of their control, and is a devout Christian.
-   Captain Anson in _Ice Cold in Alex_ not only recovers from Drowning My Sorrows as he flees Rommel's assault in a beaten-up ambulance but also saves the life of a South African soldier who tagged along for the ride who's revealed to be a German spy.
-   Commander James Bond, serving the Royal Navy before being recruited by MI6 as a double-O agent. He's seen in uniform in _You Only Live Twice_, _The Spy Who Loved Me_, and _Tomorrow Never Dies_.
-   The Bollywood movie _Lakshya_ (based on the Kargil War between India and Pakistan) has a sequence where Amitabh Bachchan orders his men to bury slain Pakistani soldiers in accordance to their religion. The soldiers protest, citing the defiling of Indian soldiers by the Pakistani army. His reply, translated roughly, is: "Even in war, we show some decency/dignity" ("हम युध मे भी एक शराफत रखते हैं।").
-   Admiral Boom in _Mary Poppins_, if you sidestep the fact that he shoots cannons from the top of his roof with absolute punctuality.
-   Captain Jack Aubrey in _Master and Commander_ represents this trope to a T. Jack is still gentlemanly in the novels, but is far more complex. He often philanders (away from Mrs. Aubrey!), dislikes and goes to great lengths to avoid duels. Even though he is of far lesser "rank," his friend Dr. Maturin is much closer to this idea.
-   _The Patriot (2000)_: This archetype is embodied by General Cornwallis, which was very much the ideal that high-level British officers at the time were at least supposed to strive for. He treats the entire Colonial War as a sporting game with temporary enemies and is more than willing to hold a civil negotiation with Benjamin Martin. At least at first. His subordinate Colonel Tavington, whose brutal, unprofessional conduct in battle initially earns him furious rebukes from Cornwallis, is eventually given free rein to engage in war crimes after Cornwallis has been dealt a personal slight by Martin.
-   Commodore Norrington of _Pirates of the Caribbean_ fame started out this way but went disappointingly south once he fell from royal favor, Death Equals Redemption notwithstanding.
    -   He did let his emotions get the best of him even in the first film. When Elizabeth asked him to go rescue Will from Barbossa, Norrington refused until she agreed to marry him. Then all his talk of duty and serving others went right out the window.
-   Major Chip Hazard from _Small Soldiers_ is certainly no example _and_ is hardly anyone to talk, but he calls Brad out for striking one of the modified Barbie Dolls all the same:
    
    **Chip Hazard:** You maggot! An officer and a gentlemen does not strike a lady!
    
-   Captain Nicholls in _War Horse_ is a typical example, even objecting to his superior's plan to attack an undefended German garrison with a surprise cavalry charge. Like a good officer, though, he follows orders. He doesn't have much of a Stiff Upper Lip, though, and the look of horror and desperation is evident on his face when he realizes that the Germans have set up machine guns in the treeline, which are mowing down the cavalry. He keeps charging, though.
-   _The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep_ plays with this trope by initially presenting the captain as per the trope as an Oxbridge-educated gentleman leading "common" soldiers, but then revealing him as a mild example of The Neidermeyer before allowing some redemption towards the end of the film.
-   Chard, Bromhead, and Bourne in _Zulu_.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Brigadier Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, Trope Namer for The Brigadier, who appeared as a companion to the Second, Third and Fourth Doctor in the classic series (as well as all the other ones up to Eight in Big Finish).
    -   Captain Jack on _Torchwood_ manages to combine this trope with being a dedicated and enthusiastic slut. The real Captain Jack Harkness, whom Jack stole the name from, fits the trope as well.

-   _Horatio Hornblower_:
    -   Sir Edward Pellew, Captain on HMS _Indefatigable_, later promoted to Admiral. He's a fine fighting man and a fabulous commander who cares about his officers and common crew. He is absolutely charming at a formal dinner party in Gibraltar, hosted by their excellencies Major General Sir Hew and Lady Dalrymple.
    -   Major Edrington ("I am in fact the Earl of Edrington") in "The Frogs and Lobsters" (also known as "The Wrong War"). He's an accomplished and capable military leader in the British Army and looks damn fine in his red coat. In his first scene, he appears to be a haughty elitist who sneers at the Royal Navy and demands to be called "My Lord", but he turns out to be OK and behaves like a perfect gentleman (if a Gentleman Snarker).
-   Major Charles Emerson Winchester III from _M\*A\*S\*H_ attempts to affect this trope during his time at the 4077th, with varying degrees of success. He's a brilliant surgeon from a respectable old money Boston family, however, he is very snarky (and not in a Gentleman Snarker way) and often behaves like a jerk.

-   In _Rome_, Lucius Vorenus has ironclad impulse control (except when it comes to his infamous temper), which is amusing given that the generals of the army (Caesar and Anthony) are just as lewd as the enlisted men.
-   General Hank Landry of _Stargate SG-1_. Apart from being a fine general, he was also fond of quoting historical figures like Patton and Churchill.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Starfleet is a pretty genteel place (exceptions need apply only to the Engineering division, and occasionally Security), but Picard still stands out. Better manners than most of the diplomats we see; unflappable (except around Borg and children); fences; rides horses; fond of classic literature… The writers were certainly well-aware of this tendency in his character, anyway; in the future timeline of "All Good Things…", Picard is an Ambassador (or rather, a retired one). The same honor was previously given to Spock.

    Music 

-   "Gentleman Soldier", a British traditional song (notably covered by The Pogues and The Dubliners, among others), is an utter subversion.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The Tag Team of "The Kentucky Gentleman" Chuck Taylor and Detective Dan Barry is called such, though this is a case of civil law rather than military officers.

    Sports 

-   The modern pentathlon of the Olympic Games was intended to replicate a scenario potentially faced by a cavalry soldier caught behind enemy lines –- the competitor rides a horse, swims, uses his pistol and sword, and finally runs to the finish. However, from 1912 (when it was introduced) to 1952, only cavalry _officers_ were allowed to compete. The reason? Cavalry _soldiers_ (i.e., enlisted men and NCOs) rode and trained horses for a living and were considered "professionals." As independently wealthy gentlemen, cavalry officers weren't in the military to make a living; therefore they were classified as Olympics-eligible "amateurs."
-   Canadian figure skater Stephen Gogolev had portrayed a gentlemanly naval officer for his short program during the 2019-2020 competitive season. His elegant costume combined with the choreography and the music ("Grand Waltz" and "Russian Sailor's Dance") convey to the audience that he's gracefully "dancing" with a lady.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _7th Sea_ has too many to count.
-   In _Battletech_, Marion Marik was this during the Reunification War. Despite the ruler of the Star League having officially rescinded the Ares Accords prior to the war, Marion declared at the onset of her campaign against The Magistracy of Canopus that she and all forces under her command would obey the Accords as long as they were respected by the Magistracy. As a result, the Canopian Campaign was fought considerably cleaner than the Taurian Campaign and the Magistracy survived the war with almost no civilian casualties and considerably less ill will against the Star League.
-   _Crimson Skies_ has Nathan Zachary; captain of the pirate airship _Pandora_ and known throughout the Americas as the Gentleman Pirate.
-   The ideal for Imperial Guard officers in _Warhammer 40,000_, penchant for shooting their own troops for cowardice notwithstanding. As in real life, most of them fall well short.
    -   Some Space Marine commanders fit this as well.
    -   The occasional Inquisitor falls under this trope.
    -   Commander Farsight of the Tau Empire also qualifies. There's a short story in the Farsight Enclaves supplement where he encounters a Space Marine apothecary retrieving the geneseed of the fallen Marines during the battle and lets him go, an act that won respect of the Chapter in question and contributed to the remarkably civil cessation of hostilities when the Imperium had to call off the Damocles Gulf crusade.

    Theatre 

-   In _The Gentleman Ranker_ all of the officers are British Gentlemen, who can recognize that Private Smith has the right mannerisms. Harford is German, but still an aristocrat.
-   Comically subverted in _H.M.S. Pinafore_, with extremely polite sailors being shocked when Captain Corcoran breaks his rule about never ("well, hardly ever") swearing.

    Video Games 

-   General Leo fits this, in _Final Fantasy VI_.
-   In _Lost Horizon_, a number of characters are current or former British army officers, but despite outward appearances, most of them don't make the cut. Fenton lacks the refinement, Huxley lacks the courtesy, and Lord Weston lacks the integrity. Richard Weston might qualify, though.
-   Captain Anderson and Paragon Commander Shepard in _Mass Effect_ as well as several other, less prominent examples.
-   Prominently so with the captain in the _Neverwinter Nights 2_ mod _Dark Waters_, who goes as far as cutting his own left hand off so that his nemesis won't do the same to one of his crew.
-   In _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ there's General White, a retired Bob-omb general with a rather elegant moustache. Admiral Bobbery comes close too, though he's a little rougher.
-   In _Sabres of Infinity_, one of your fellow officers, Elson, is highly educated, well-spoken, and generally friendly towards you, provided you abide by the war's rules of engagement.
-   _Tales of the Abyss_ has General Aslan Frings of the Malkuth Imperial Forces. The first time you meet him, he thanks you for disobeying orders in the name of trying to alert his troops of danger, and he's later shown going out of his way to treat captured enemy troops with respect… even before he falls in love with his Distaff Counterpart from Kimlasca, General Jozette Cecille.

    Webcomics 

-   _Cassiopeia Quinn_: Such behaviour is enforced by the Prime Galactic Navy through a strict Code of Honour, which (among other things) involves treating every enemy as a Worthy Opponent, and never allowing another to sully your reputation. 'Dishonorable' behaviour will get errant officers disciplined if they're lucky, and on the receiving end of a duel if they're not. They even enforce the 'gentleman' bit too, as all officers seemingly receive titles on commission, and rise in the hierarchy as they rank-up<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .

    Web Original 

-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Shawn is the leader of some sort of squad, although it has yet to be seen, other than his bodyguard, Kerry. He is certainly a chivalrous and polite guy too.
-   _Happy Tree Friends_ has Flippy, who isn't serving anymore, but still wears his uniform and dogtags. Throughout the series, he is unfailingly polite, more than eager to lend a hand, and has a knack for even engaging in childish activities. He's such a sweetheart that it's easy to forget he has a Split Personality of an Ax-Crazy mass murderer when reminded of the war he served.

    Western Animation 

-   Near the end of _Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines_ episode "Medal Muddle", Dick Dastardly was falling and had no medal to offer Muttley so, in order to convince the dog to save him, Dastardly invoked the trope and promised to help Muttley find his lost medals. Dastardly kept good on his promise.
-   Though a twenty-six-star General rather than a captain, "captain" Zapp Brannigan subverted this in _Futurama_ with his incredibly lecherous (and cowardly, and irresponsible, and moronic…) behavior.
-   Griff of _Gargoyles_, complete with British accent and derring-do. He helps the Royal Air Force battle those damn Nazis in the skies above London, later meets the goddamn King Arthur
-   _Looneyy Tunes_: Surprisingly, _Yosemite Sam_ of all people is able to pull this off during the short film _Southern Fried Rabbit_ (1953) by Friz Freleng. Sam is depicted as a Confederate officer who didn't get the message that The American Civil War ended decades ago. Though he relentlessly pursues Bugs Bunny, bent on keeping Yankees off of Confederate soil, when Bugs disguises himself as a woman, Sam is genteel and unfailingly polite to the "Scarlet Ma'am". This is also one of the few times where Sam isn't talking at his usual volume level.
-   Brick from _Total Drama_ is only a cadet, but considering he's the only one in the show with any military training he still counts. He has a strong No One Gets Left Behind philosophy, gives up his chance of winning a challenge to save the opposing team from a giant, mutant gopher and would be the Team Dad if his rival Jo didn't have near-full control of the team.
