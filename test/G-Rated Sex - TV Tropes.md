This seems to be how cutebolds (think they) reproduce. (Also, the cutebold imagining this is rubbing his own nose, while the dragonborn lady watches in confusion.)

_"I'm gonna fill your hoo-ha with goof juice!"_

Frequently in games, movies, TV shows, and commercials that children are watching, as well as in movies and TV shows in which some of the characters _are_ children, there's a need for sex to occur without anyone ever actually _having_ sex. Usually this is because breeding is a large part of the game or a character wants a baby.

Especially prevalent in Simulation Games. Compare with G-Rated Drug. Methods of producing offspring may involve the Delivery Stork, Spontaneous Generation, or Whale Egg. If two seemingly-incompatible species are involved, we might have Hot Skitty-on-Wailord Action. It may also involve the Non-Standard Kiss.

Not to be confused with Sexy Discretion Shot.

**NOTE: If an example seems more like a case of Does This Remind You of Anything?, then it's not actually an example.**

    Advertising 

-   The lady sheriff and the two Cowboys are about to have a G-rated two man and one woman threesome in this Schick razors commercial.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ayakashi Triangle_:
    -   Suzu's first attempt to change Matsuri back from being turned female happen to occur when both were lying in bed, and Suzu pulls Matsuri's robe open to place hands on the mark on his abdomen. She tries putting her Life Energy into him, and it's not only sexually suggestive, but written as if Suzu was a man penetrating Matsuri. The chapter it occurs in is even called "Inside Matsuri".
        
        **Matsuri**: Something hot is flowing into me from Suzu.
        
        **Suzu**: You felt what came from me go inside of you?  
        **Matsuri**: Yeah... Does it... make you tired or anything?  
        **Suzu**: Not at all.
        
    -   During a heatwave, Suzu is repeatedly left collapsed and heavily panting, begging for Matsuri to cool her off with his wind, and moaning in relief whenever he does. At one point before doing so, Matsuri slowly and carefully puts his hands up her _shirt sleeve_. Matsuri is fully aware of how suggestive things are (and quite aroused because he has a sweat fetish), but Suzu obliviously throws out comments about Matsuri "doing it \[to her\]".
        
        **Suzu**: I think we should do it in my room. Our homework.
        
-   The _Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics's_ version of _Rapunzel_ did what it could to imply that Rapunzel and the Prince were lovers, without spelling it out. The most blatant scene has them _in the same bed_ — albeit fully clothed.
-   At one point in _Delicious in Dungeon_, the party comes across three dryads pollinating each other. Senshi mistakes them for humans and thinks they're actually getting ready to do it.
-   _My Monster Secret_ uses vampire bloodsucking as an obvious stand-in for other activities that the teenage protagonist couple might engage in. In particular, Youko's thirst for blood is regularly treated as a desire for... something else. It sticks to Does This Remind You of Anything? for the bulk of the story but takes a hard turn into this trope when it's revealed that female vampires can actually become pregnant by bloodsucking.

    Comics 

-   _ElfQuest_ depicts what is implied to be group sex as everyone dancing, naked. They send the children away beforehand, that's how we know that they're not just dancing.
-   _Power Girl_ has had G-Rated Sex twice, the first time with the alien Sean Connery character known as Vartox. This sex impregnated all the women, and men, of Vartox's groovy 1970's-cultured homeworld. The act consisted only of touching a floating ball of energy simultaneously. Power Girl later participated in some kind of emotion-sharing ritual with her best friend Atlee while they both wore skimpy bathing suits. Power Girl specifically compares it to her experience with Vartox and finds it weirder. While Vartox was played entirely for laughs, the sequence with Atlee was very sweet.

    Fan Works 

-   _A Hero's Wrath_: Izuku and Nejire have not gone "all the way" in their relationship, but they do tend to cuddle a lot, to the point where they "cuddle a dent in the wall."
-   In _Cinema Snob Reviews Frozen_ (a fan comic where _The Cinema Snob_ reviews _Frozen_), Snob says the "crazy trust exercise" with Anna and Kristoff counts as third base by Disney standards.
-   "Sharing dreams" is implied to be this for Psyches in _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_, and this is for a race of emotionless asexual Smurf-like people who are betrothed as same-sex couples. Even Empath and Polaris engaged in it.
-   _Hero: The Guardian Smurf_: Although the male and female Smurfs in this series do have what is called "getting under one's hat," reproduction is still handled through mystical means, such as a Delivery Stork for much of Hero's generation of Smurfs as well as for Baby Smurf, and also a mystical union blessing by Mother Nature for when Wonder and Smurfette both undergo physical pregnancy to birth their children from Hero.
-   In order to let their group escape from a rampaging ADAM during the Multiverse Arc in _Nobody Dies_, Rei achieves a 400% Synchronization with her Eva. Now, apply a little Fridge Logic aaaannnnnd…
-   _Tangled Adventures in Arendelle_ uses this in the use of a cutaway. Rapunzel and Eugene get intimate with each other (no, not in the way that it wouldn't count), and then we get a text cutaway with something about how Pascal didn't know what they were up to for various reasons.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _The Aristocats_, Duchess has kittens. She and O'Malley skirt around the issue several times, and it is possible Duchess is a widow, or the feline equivalent.
-   The same thing happened in _Bambi_; after their Falling-in-Love Montage, the scene cuts to Bambi and Faline lying together in a thicket. A few scenes later, twins.
-   In _Dumbo_, animals wanting a baby must hope a literal Delivery Stork pays them a visit. Apparently it never occurred to Mrs. Jumbo that she could up her chances by sleeping with Mr. Jumbo. In a neat little Parental Bonus, the other elephants are absolutely indignant when the stork asks if any of them are expecting.
-   The "clasping hands together and making them glow" thing from _FernGully_.
-   In _The Lion King (1994)_, during the "Can You Feel The Love Tonight?" segment between Simba and Nala, in which they topple down a hill into a suggestive position and give each other very knowing looks. This is further proven by the DVD commentary and Kiara's birth at the end of the movie — and the original draft was somehow even less subtle.
-   "The song became love, and love became the egg" line in _Happy Feet_.
-   In _Johnny Corncob_, the hero and Nel start rolling on the ground, upon which they turn into amorous pigeon silhouettes rubbing their tail-feathers together, while the world around them becomes a kaleidoscopic flurry of colors, flowers, and butterflies. Otherwise, the film doesn't shy away from showing nudity and rape, but mostly for comedic effect.
-   Rodney's parents in _Robots_ declare that "Making the baby is the fun part!" Then they assemble him from a kit.
-   _Son of the White Horse_ has the Rain King, in the form of a misty cloud, impregnate the Snow Queen, in the form of the titular White Mare, by touching their eyes together, both of which are shaped and spew sparkles in a suggestive way.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   This _should_, by all means, have happened in _Avatar_, what with the Na'vi having weird prehensile hair they use to create mental "bonds" with animals. But they never do use it between Na'vi; they kiss instead, like in human civilizations, despite having had absolutely no encounters with Earth for who-knows-how-long. In this case, it might be because kissing appears to occur across many civilizations and may have a biological origin, and since the Na'vi seem to have evolved similarly to humans, this may have carried over. There was a deleted scene where Neytiri tells Jake that connecting their hair together was the Na'vi equivalent of sex, then they proceed to do it.
    -   Parodied with "Hot Na'vi Sex"
    -   It's specified in the expanded guides that the Na'vi can and do have sex like humans and this is how they reproduce. Connecting queues (the hair braids) doesn't actually lead to procreation and is merely done to create an emotional bond, sort of like connecting each other's minds.
-   The standard form of future sex in _Barbarella_ is consuming "exaltation transference pills" with a partner and pressing palms together when one's "psychocardiograms are in perfect harmony". However, once Barbarella has been introduced to the primitive form, she doesn't find the pill version so interesting anymore.
-   _Birdemic_ has a sex scene between Nathalie and Rod...with _full clothes on._
-   _The Blue Lagoon (1980)_ essentially shows Emmeline and Richard gently making out; they never make any motions that indicate they've figured out that Tab A goes into Slot B. This was one of the things critic Pauline Kael hooted at, specifically when Richard later says "Why'd you have a baby?" and Em says "I don't know": "The way they rub limbs, all they'll produce is friction."
-   The aliens in _Cocoon_ have sex by shooting their energy at each other.
-   The… whatever the holy hell the Conehead daughter was doing with Chris Farley in _Coneheads_. They also allude at one point to a "pleasure spool", without further elaboration (other than it being a "difficult temptation to resist" which each Conehead is allowed only four uses of).
-   In the Stallone/Snipes movie _Demolition Man_, sex (or kissing, or anything involving the "swapping of body fluids") has been outlawed by the government due to being deemed bad for your health, so sex is simulated with helmets projecting sexy images into your head and hitting the tickle button in your brain. This has nothing to do with the audience (indeed, a naked woman appears elsewhere in the movie)—it's to show just how much of a nanny-state that the protagonists are living in. Ironically, although it appears G-rated to the audience and presumably to those who are used to the practice, it is apparently a very disturbing experience for John Spartan, who would rather do the hunka-chunka.
-   In _Dil Se.._, the "Jiya Jale" Item Number (where Preity is imagining what it would be like to be married to Amar, not long before her wedding) has the two dancing together (some of the moves being rather suggestive) in water. The Freudian imagery is enforced with Amar and male backup dancers dancing surrounded by elephants. Reviews of the film noted how the lack of a sex scene was compensated for by the "exoticism" of this scene.
-   In _Earth Girls Are Easy_ Valerie and Mac's sex is simulated by energetic snuggling and persistence-of-vision type special effects. It is possibly the most Eighties sex scene ever recorded in any medium. And there's glow paint.
-   _Godzilla (2014)_: Via Bizarre Alien Reproduction. The MUTOs rub snouts with each other when they meet. The female's eggs are shown to be fertilized after. The footage was shown in the sequel "with the genitals blurred out". The couple’s heads were blurred out, confirming that the pair was engaging in coitus.
-   _Gremlins (1984)_ had mogwai and gremlins reproduce by... er... splashing or immersing them in water. Fun Fact: Mogwai come from Chinese lore. They were said to be gremlin-like creatures that inflict harm on people and breed during the rainy seasons.
-   In the live-action _How the Grinch Stole Christmas!_, baby Whos drop from the sky in baskets (which use open umbrellas as parachutes). There's a bit of Parental Bonus when a baby lands on a doorstep, the man brings it inside, and, after announcing its presence, he says to his wife, "He looks just like your boss."
-   _The Last Jedi_ has a moment where Rey and Kylo Ren touch hands via their Force bond. It's shot rather like a love scene, with dimmed lighting, extreme close-ups of their hands touching, a focus on their facial reactions, etc. And to cap it all off Luke Skywalker bursts in and reacts in a manner some viewers found reminiscent of an overprotective parent walking in on some hanky-panky (leading to the 'Cockblock Luke' meme, among others). The director also outright stated it's probably the closest thing we'll get to a sex scene in _Star Wars_.
-   Talked about, but not actually done, in _Love Comes Softly_. 8-year-old Missie asks pregnant stepmother Marty where babies come from. At a loss, Marty tells her that when a man and a woman love each other very much, "it" spills over and makes a baby.
    
    **Missie**: What spills over?  
    **Marty**: \[beat\] It!  
    **Missie**: What's _it?_  
    **Marty**: \[beat\] The love!  
    **Missie**: \[dubious look\] I was just thinkin' about how many brothers and sisters Clint has. There must be a _lot of love_ spillin' over at the Grahams'.
    
-   Word of God is that the initial sparring session between Raleigh and Mako in _Pacific Rim_, was supposed to have shades of this to emphasize that the link between pilots is not strictly intellectual/emotional. Which is incredibly squicky when you consider that, judging by what we see onscreen, "linking" is much more common between siblings or parent and child than between romantic partners.
-   _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_: "EL-BOW SEX!! EL-BOW SEX!!"
-   _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_: Roger reacts to Jessica "playing patty-cake" with Marvin Acme as if she were having an affair. The extremely suggestive dialogue and sounds fill in the rest. And then you see the photographs and discover that they were _literally_ playing patty-cake.
-   Parodied in _Zebraman_. During a sequence where the narrator describes crimes committed by corrupt officials over staged reenactments of said crimes, an official committing rape is represented by footage of a man _doing wrestling moves on a woman_.

    Literature 

-   _The Awakening_ has sex scenes so G-rated that students forced to read the book tend to completely miss them. The great irony of this is that when it was written, the book was so raunchy it almost wasn't published. By contrast, Kate Chopin's short story "The Storm", written a year earlier, was racy enough that Chopin didn't even try to get it published during her lifetime (it was eventually published in 1969); today it is often considered one of the earliest works of English-language erotica by a woman.
-   In _The Last Dragon Chronicles_, by Chris D'Lacey, it is possible for descendants of Gwendolyn to "quicken" (become pregnant) when thinking about motherhood or the ones they love, which typically results in human babies born from clay eggs. In one case, however, a bit of magic results in a _dragon baby_ being born in such a fashion. It Makes Sense in Context.
    -   Similarly, in the third book in the series, _Firestar,_ it's revealed that Zanna is pregnant with David's baby. Since this is a children's book series, no direct reference to them having sex is ever mentioned. However, early in the book, around the time said baby would logically have been conceived, it's mentioned that the two characters "spent the night keeping each other warm," said with a knowing leer.
-   In the original novel _The Hundred and One Dalmatians,_ Perdita's storyline requires her to have had her puppies after knowing their father for hours at the longest. (Pongo's wife is named Missis in the book; Perdita is an entirely different Dalmatian.) The sex apparently consists of them running off into the woods, professing their love for each other, and negotiating their wedding. Shortly thereafter, Perdita tromps out of the woods, pregnant.
-   _The Wise Man's Fear_ introduces Kvothe to the Adem, a culture that considers music to be an incredibly intimate experience. When explaining this to him, Kvothe's Adem friends compare their regard for music to most cultures' regard for sex. (The Adem have plenty of sex: it's just not a very big deal, compared with, say, a song.) Unfortunately for Kvothe, a trouper and musician at heart, they also equate musicians with prostitutes.
-   The _Xanth_ books make a Running Gag out of the notion of "summoning the stork" as a euphemism for sex. Also, instead of a sex scene, one book has a literal ellipsis appear in the characters' bedroom. This is, after all, _Xanth_.
-   In _B is for Betsy_ by Carolyn Haywood, Betsy's parents go on vacation in April, leaving Betsy with a nanny. In the sequel, _Betsy and Billy_, Betsy's baby sister is born on Christmas.
-   _Warrior Cats_ is a children's series that has a few scenes that imply the cats mate, sometimes for reasons other than breeding:
    -   In _The Fourth Apprentice_, Dovepaw hears Sorreltail and Brackenfur on a hunting patrol together. She tunes out her hearing after Brackenfur praises Sorreltail, which causes Sorreltail to purr.
    -   In _Bluestar's Prophecy_, Bluefur and Oakheart spent one evening hanging out together, with Oakheart saying they should "build a nest" together. This led to Bluefur becoming pregnant.
    -   Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight go into their den together in _Sunset_. Ashfur, who has unrequited feelings for Squirrelflight, sees and starts tearing the ground in anger.
    -   When two cats visit an injured Breezepelt in _Crowfeather's Trial_, they note that his mate Heathertail is anxious for them to leave. Nightcloud murmurs to Crowfeather that the Clan will be expecting kits soon.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Charlie's Angels_: In the "Angel In Love" episode, the Angels' assignment is to investigate a murder at Utopia West. It's a health resort where guests are encouraged to "deposit their inhibitions and let it all hang out". Kris didn't get that impression of Utopia West:
    
    **Kelly:** Well, what do you think of Utopia  
    **Kris:** Are you kidding? I'm so disappointed. I thought sex would be running rampant.  
    **Kelly:** Oh, it's running. You just haven't caught up to it yet.
    
-   _Dinosaurs_: Robbie reflexively does "the mating dance" in school, obviously a substitute for getting an erection. He later tries to learn more about sex by visiting a dance hall of ill repute. And Charlene gets self-conscious when her tail starts to grow.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Steven Moffat has stated that the mind-melding as seen in the _Doctor Who_ episode "The Girl in the Fireplace" is definitely mind sex. Which makes his later mind melds with Donna and the Master rather interesting in retrospect… the Master, in his typical way, forces the contact on him, too—after some Orgasmic Combat, of course. Even creepier, the Third and Second Doctors mind-melded.
    -   Double Word of God from both 2005-2010 producer Russell T Davies and his successor Moffat confirms that the use of term "dance" in the episodes "The Doctor Dances" and "The Girl in the Fireplace" is a euphemism for sex. Which gives the scene in "The Doctor Dances" in which the Doctor actually dances with Rose Tyler _after_ the establishment of said euphemism a different connotation.
    -   The scene in "The Romans" where both Ian and Barbara are alone, slightly drunk, and Barbara makes Ian sit down for her and tenderly combs his hair.
-   In the _Babylon 5_ episode "Acts of Sacrifice", Commander Susan Ivanova is expected to have sex with an alien ambassador. While Dr. Franklin suggests "You could put a bag over his head and do it for Babylon 5," Ivanova instead gets out of having to do anything squicky by offering to doing it "human style".
-   The _Star Trek: Voyager_ episode "The Q and the Grey" reveals that all two members of the Q Continuum needs to do is touch fingers and allow them to merge briefly for conception to occur. Lampshaded by Captain Janeway when she asks: "That was it?" That's not even what they really have to do, since their human form is just a concession to the species they happen to be with at the time. Whatever is actually going on to create a new Q is beyond most beings' comprehension.
-   In the _Star Trek: Enterprise_ episode "Unexpected", Trip Tucker accidentally becomes pregnant by an alien woman, just via the help of some Green Rocks they buried their hands in.

    Music & Music Videos 

    Mythology 

-   In Hindu Mythology, Hanuman could do this. One way was that he could impregnate women just by singing while the other was when someone caught Hanuman's sweat, thus Makaradhvaja was born. The former was a task for Hanuman, while the second one was a complete accident. Both of which Celibate Hero Hanuman sorta panicked over.
-   An Indian judge once claimed (while arguing for the cow to replace the tiger as the national animal of India) that peacocks are "pious" and the female "gets pregnant" by drinking the male's tears. It should go without saying that this is not true, as peacocks not only sexually reproduce but are quite promiscuous, and the entire reason the male bird fans his feathers is because he's trying to attract mates. Peacocks also don't have tear ducts and thus can't cry to begin with.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Fraggle Rock_: Pa and Ma Gorg are still _very_ amorous, to the point that Junior has to be banned from the creek when Pa and Ma go there very obviously to skinny-dip and have sex.
-   _The Muppet Show_:
    -   The pilot "Sex & Violence" satirised the concern about increasing sex and violence on television by Muppetising it. For instance, Muppet sex consisted of two Muppets running at each other full pelt, colliding with an explosion, and babies raining everywhere like fallout.
    -   The explosive breeding made it into the regular show as a Koozebanian mating ritual (the "Galley-o-hoop-hoop").

    Roleplays 

-   _Unnatural Selection_ has Glitcher and Rulekeeper examining each other's programming code.

    Video Games 

-   In the third _Arfenhouse_ game, Housemaster and Good Kitty are shown having "sex" by simply standing next to each other in bed.
-   _Baldies_ was an RTS game where you built armies of fat, bald men. They reproduced by bouncing on a bed.
-   In the Facebook game _Birdland_, you can breed the birds with a click of a button. The game shows the two birds cuddling as happy music plays, and an egg appears.
-   In _Black & White_, a Breeder Disciple will give a full-body kiss to another villager to have sex with them. Most of the time they would go indoors after such embrace and then a child would walk out afterwards.
-   _Creatures_: That "mmmmmmmm-pop" sound means your creatures have just had non-graphic sex by standing next to each other. The official term for this is "Kisspopping". (Normal kissing noises just mean they like each other and will probably continue to make out until they starve if you don't separate them.) Humorously there was an official explanation that they breed this way because the Shee that genetically engineered them in the first place were squeamish.
-   In the artificial life simulator _Darwin Pond_, swimmers are ready to mate when their beak gets long and thick, with a blob on the end indicating what colors they are looking for in a mate. If the resultant merry chase is successful, the pursuer touches the pursuee with is beak, causing a baby swimmer combining features from both parents to appear at the point of contact and rapidly grow to adult size. Compared to some examples on this page, this is practically critter porn.
-   _Double Switch_ has one scene where Lyle and Elizabeth have sex. You don't actually see it, but it is strongly implied to have occurred between them.
-   In _Dragon Quest Monsters_, when you select two monsters to mate (_any_ two monsters) they go back to the Mystical Room of Breeding, look at each other… and then an egg appears, and the monsters are gone… Later games treat this as a Fusion Dance instead, explaining not only where the "parents" go but also allowing for "neutral" monsters that can breed with either "gender".
-   In _Dwarf Fortress_, a female creature can become pregnant if a male creature of the same species stands next to them and both are of compatible orientation. The same goes for a married male and female dwarf. In previous versions, pregnancy could occur _anytime they were on the same map_, even if both were in cages, which led to jokes that they reproduced using spores.
-   When using the sheep-breeding option in _Farmville_, the selected pair of sheep vanish into a curtained niche in their shelter and are replaced in their enclosure with two message signs that read "Baa Chicka Baa Baa".
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Terra's parents in _Final Fantasy VI_ do a sparkly dance and create a baby when those sparkles fuse together. This was (hopefully) meant as a metaphor, not to be taken literally. Then again, some espers have Bizarre Alien Biology; who's to say, really, what those 16-bit sprites are doing when off-screen? (That being said, Madeline is lucky that she was with vaguely-humanoid Maduin and not, say, Bismarck the freaking _whale._)
    -   In _Final Fantasy X_ at a particularly emotional part of the game, Tidus and Yuna go for a moonlit swim together. Fully clothed, but the scene is slow, with romantic music playing, them kissing and touching, and ends with both of them looking spent and messy-haired. Yuna is embarrassed and asks Tidus to return to the group first…
    -   At one point in _Final Fantasy VII Remake_, Cloud is given the choice between three price tiers of different qualities for a private... hand massage. Each ensuing cutscene has him grunting and moaning as his hand gets massaged, and afterwards Aerith notes that he's visibly dazed. Bonus points for the "luxury" tier, where the sensual undertones are most prominent.
        
        **Madame M:** Oh? What was that? A cry of pleasure? Is this how you like it? How about this? Or maybe this?
        
-   The old NES game _Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode_ had a few parts in the first act, and one later on, where your character visits ladies staying overnight at the local hotel and… well… the only real indication they're getting down and dirty is a third person peeping into the room window. You and lady embrace, lights in room dim down to black, and health is restored.
-   Reproduction in _Minecraft_ consists of two animals running into each other until a baby animal spawns, or in the case of turtles, having one of them head to the beach to lay eggs. Villagers reproduce by standing in front of each other in love, and then a baby villager appears.
-   In _My Tribe_, two of your villagers walking into a hut with the status message "calling the stork". A few seconds later—a baby toddles out.
-   Many people in the _Neverwinter Nights_ module creating community get around the fact that the game isn't programmed to have visual sex encounters by creating a bubble of darkness around two characters. Though the dialogue in most of these cases is at least PG-13 rated.
-   In the _NiGHTS_ series, Nightopians come together and an egg drops. And as for Mepians (Nightmaren/Nightopian hybrids), they're made by knocking a 3rd-level Nightmaren in the form of a ball into a Nightopian.
-   In _Oreshika: Tainted Bloodlines,_ the only way for your cursed clan to make offspring to carry on the legacy and break the curse is to either have someone marry a member of another cursed clan or perform a "rite of divine union" with a god. All that's seen during these parts is the two characters staring lovingly into each other's eyes while weasel girl Kochin does a ceremonial dance.
-   In _Overlord I_, if you decorate enough of your evil castle in your Mistress's preferred style she takes you into her private quarters to give you some "strategy advice". Your camera gets stuck outside the door with some eves-dropping minions, but she sounds down-right orgasmic, and the castle does a lot of rocking and reeling. _Overlord II_ manages to push this as far as possible while still having the camera stuck outside the room. And this time you have _three_ mistresses, so if you have enough money to keep redecorating…
-   _Ms. Pac-Man_ features a cut-scene titled _The Chase_ in which Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man chase each other across the screen amidst cartoon hearts. In the following cutscene, a stork flies by and drops off Baby Pac-Man.
-   In _Petz_, a large heart with congratulations on your petz' pregnancy pops up, hiding both of the animals in the process.
-   In the iOS game _Pixel People_, every few minutes a heart will appear over a house or other residential building. Selecting the building and holding down on the heart causes it to grow bigger and pop with a suggestive message like "WOO HOO" or "SWOON". Collect ten hearts and a stork brings a random bonus such as gold.
-   _Planescape: Torment_:
    -   There is a G-rated _brothel_, run by a reformed succubus, but there's no sex going on in there in _any_ form... It's called the Brothel for Slaking _Intellectual_ Lusts for a reason. Nice place to go if you want to, say, play chess or debate politics with someone, but the closest physical contact you'll be getting in there is being slapped by entering the 'abuse' room.
    -   There are some more conventional prostitutes wandering the streets of The Hive. The first time you talk to one Morte will loudly request to be allowed to patronize her services, but since he's a floating animated skull he settles for her giving him a polish. (Disclaimer: not a metaphor). The Nameless One can also buy a prostitute's services for himself, which consists of a Fade to Black.
-   _Pokémon_ eggs appear mysteriously when you leave them at the Daycare Center. For some odd reason, no one in the world, not even for scientific reasons, has watched Pokémon reproduce and as such have no idea where all these eggs come from. Either that or the Daycare Couple doesn't want to explain the stuff to a pre-teen boy/girl. It's implied no one has seen it happen because Pokémon can't breed if someone watches. Meaning, people have tried to watch/study but it doesn't work out. Most Pokémon, after all, have near-human-level intelligence, as well as sentience. Strangely enough, Pokémon eggs were first discovered by Prof. Elm in Generation II—three years after the start of the series—and baby Pokémon such as Pichu and Cleffa weren't even known until some time in between the two generations. This was retconned in the remakes of Generations I and II, due to the existence of breeding in the Generation I remakes.
-   In _Populous_, two people would walk into a house, and three people would come out. (So if someone else goes inside, will the house be empty?)
-   _Roots Of Pacha_:
    -   Breeding is done by placing two compatible animals of the same species in the breeding pen. The heart pattern on the curtain draped outside changes from brown to pink to give them privacy, and a few days later, you get a cutscene of the birth of their young.
    -   Neither you nor your partner is shown getting pregnant a few weeks after your Union (marriage). Instead, a fertility statue of Pacha appears in your bedroom, and you can pray to her to bless you with a child. The "pregnancy" is symbolized by a fire symbol growing in the statue's belly, and a few days later, your baby magically appears in your bed. This also justifies how your child strongly resembles you even if you're in a same-gender Union.
-   _Seaman_ has an odd way of mating: when there are two Podfish Seamen in the tank, the unnamed Podfish will eventually grow legs, then latch onto the main Podfish's back while the two's head tendrils lock and… _something_ pours from the "male" Podfish's tendril into the "female"'s. Afterwards, the "male" Podfish dies.
-   In _Shepherd's Crossing,_ a female animal who is kept around male animals will likely end up pregnant. In the sequel, female animals have a purple heart icon over their heads when they're in heat, so you can separate them and fence them off if you don't want them to get pregnant.
-   In _SimLife_, mating between creatures is indicated by a sexy female voice going "ooh-la-la".
-   Reproduction in _The Sims_ is done by repeatedly kissing and hoping you randomly get a "Should we get a baby?" dialog; answering "Yes" will make a crib appear in a shower of flowers. Averted beginning with the _Livin' Large_ expansion, which introduced the Vibromatic Heart Bed that allows Sims to "play in bed", a precursor to the "WooHoo" depicted in _The Sims 2_ onwards. Pet reproduction plays it straight or averts it depending on the game: _The Sims: Unleashed_ and _The Sims 4: Cats & Dogs_ has the pets merely snuggling, while _The Sims 2: Pets_ and _The Sims 3: Pets_ has them "WooHoo" in pet houses.
-   Chao in the _Sonic Adventure_ series indicate their fertility by sitting in a circle of flowers. They do a Happy Dance to some music, then a Chao egg pops into existence between them.
-   In _Spore_, creatures mate by dancing, accompanied by either romantic string music or a cheesy saxophone riff.
-   In _Stacklands_, placing two villagers on a House card and waiting a while will make them produce offspring. The parents just jump out of the House immediately as soon as their child is born.
-   In _Starbound_, the Glitch are robots programmed to believe they are regular organic beings (unless they break their programming). When two Glitch decide it's time to have children, they involuntarily enter a trance-like state, then obtain parts and assemble a new Glitch. Once done, they reemerge from the trance with no memories of what they did, but with a vague feeling of having had a very good time.
-   _Startopia_ has a G-Rated brothel, in the form of the Love Nest. Here Dahnese Sirens, the attractive Winged Humanoids the player can put on staff, give "love" to visiting aliens from big, heart-shaped thrones, by hovering in the air and sprinkling glowy hearts on them. There's also the Oroflex, a rare and expensive tentacly thing in a carnival tent that picks up aliens, moves around like a thrill ride, and spits them back out. This affects the "love" and "fun" meters, so it's like tentacle rape plus the tilt-a-whirl.
-   _Story of Seasons_:
    -   In most games, the player simply has to keep their spouse's Heart Meter maxed out for a specified length of time (usually 60 days after marriage, not necessarily consecutive) to result in pregnancy. Even when the female involved is the player's character. (_A Wonderful Life_ doesn't even go that far. Once you get married, the story jumps ahead three years, and you've already got a kid.)
    -   The spinoff, _Rune Factory_ takes this trope and runs with it. Once you're married for 150 days—you'll wake up and your wife is holding a baby. No time skip, no "You're Pregnant" cutscene, just "Boom. Baby."
    -   _Rune Factory 2_ has a baby born after just 15 days. This is probably because the first generation is pretty much "level up, make babies and get onto the second generation" time.
    -   In _Harvest Moon: Animal Parade_, you're actually asked if you want kids. In other words, you plan to have kids. Your spouse actually makes remarks about "having your work cut out for you".
    -   _Harvest Moon: Magical Melody_: You can only have a baby if you keep up the Heart Meter, but one of the requirements to be married is having a double bed in the house. If you try to put in a single bed after the wedding, your spouse says something like "We _are_ married, after all". You get one cutscene in which you find out that you're pregnant and one in which you have the baby (with all of your clothes on… somehow). Interestingly, if you're playing as a female character, you lose health a little more quickly while pregnant.
    -   There is also the Miracle Potion, also known as the "Ushi no Tane"<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>  in Japanese and "Cow Seed" in _Doraemon: Story of Seasons_, which gets your animals pregnant. _A Wonderful Life_, for some reason, still keeps up the pretense of the Miracle Potion in the English version, despite the fact that a bull (either your own or on loan from elsewhere) is required for it to work. The cutscene that comes with using the potion, while it doesn't show what happens, _does_ show both cow and bull looking _very happy_ once it's over.
    -   Strangely, in most _Story of Seasons_ games, hens' eggs can hatch even when there are no male chickens around.
-   In the _Super Mario Bros._ franchise, babies are created in a magical land in the sky and then delivered to their parents by storks.
-   The game _Unholy Heights_ has monsters that are close to each other show their love by "engaging in pillow talk" (you can't see anything other than the description). Sometimes a baby comes from it.
-   _Virtual Villagers_: Dragging and dropping one villager of the appropriate age and gender on to another results in a kiss effect, the couple "going indoors" and coming out with a baby. Aww. Later episodes of the game feature a "love shack" hut, decorated with flowers.
    -   Related game _Virtual Families_ (same publisher and uses a lot of the same backstory, but modern day) has the parents _literally_ jump up and down on a bed together, fully clothed, then look around expectantly. If it works, be baby appears out of thin air.
-   _Village Life_: When a couple wants to have a baby, clicking the baby thought bubble will activate a minigame where you repeatedly click on the couple's house to make it bounce and fill the heart meter. The meter will then spin to determine the chances of the wife getting pregnant.
-   _Viva Piñata_: The Pinatas do a crazy dance inside their house that summons a stork superhero woman who delivers the egg. Every species of piñata has their own dance and music style.
-   _Zoo Tycoon 2_: Animals simply adopt a snoozing posture simultaneously (even from across the exhibit) in order to mate, as if literally "sleeping together".

-   There are numerous gags in _SMPLive_ where players "have sex" by one standing above another on a bed awkwardly, sometimes crouching rapidly.

    Western Animation 

-   The Nicktoon _Aaahh!!! Real Monsters_ had the monsters reproduce via a dance.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   "The Headband" has what fans have nicknamed "the Kataango;" Aang and Katara have a Mating Dance, dipping in and out, gazing deep into each other's eyes, getting very close, and ending the spectacle with both of them sweaty and panting, Aang holding Katara in his arms. The whole scene is just an "I need a fire-stick" away from being completely obvious.
    -   It's pretty obvious what Sokka wanted when waiting in his tent for Suki in "The Southern Raiders." Poor Zuko needed some Brain Bleach when he went in instead. Afterwards, Sokka does get Suki to come to the tent, and the next morning features a couple of clues from Sokka that he did indeed get "lei'd".
-   _Drawn Together_:
    -   Foxxy Love and Princess Clara kiss in the first episode, and in the next episode, Toot convinces Clara that she is pregnant because the only thing Disney princesses ever do with their man before they are seen with children is kiss.
    -   In "Clum Babies", _Pokémon_ expy Ling-Ling ends up in an Arranged Marriage with a female monster, who he "fights" on a regular basis; among his people, battles to the death are an allegory for sex, complete with one-night stands and unsatisfied opponents faking it. Near the end of the episode, they're both getting bored, and his partner Ni-Pul suggests that they spice things up by dropping the metaphor and actually having sex.
-   In the _Futurama_ episode "Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch", it's revealed that Kif's species can become pregnant by any direct skin-to-skin contact while they're experiencing deep feelings of love, even with species from entire other planets. Which, as Kif observes when he accidentally becomes pregnant, puts a whole new spin on the saying "No glove, no love."
-   In the _Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)_ episode "Hooked on Sonics", Sonic and Sally share their first onscreen mouth-to-mouth kiss. During the scene, it's quite clear that Sonic is using his tongue, and he holds Sally directly against his chest as they both start moving together in rhythm for a few seconds. Here is the scene in question.
-   In one of the Czech _Krtek_ (_Mole_) animated shorts, a little dance is all it takes for the rabbit girl to get pregnant, and immediately give birth to a litter of bunnies, on-screen (!).
-   _Phineas and Ferb_ had a very sneaky one in "Isabella and the Temple of Sap". In Isabella's daydream, Phineas transforms into a centaur and allows Isabella to ride him. Any girl who's ever ridden a horse knows how this is supposed to feel. Not to mention when she talks in that scene she sounds like she's in ecstasy, but that just might be because it's Phineas.
-   _Rocko's Modern Life_: Ed and Bev break plates with their tongues in what's implied to be a very bizarre form of foreplay. At another point, Ed was chasing Bev around in a giant hamster ball.
-   In one episode of _Samurai Jack_, the titular hero wanders into an enchanted forest where a beautiful plant nymph steps out of a huge flower bud, offers him "nourishment" and invites him to rest with her, all the while rubbing his legs with her feet. Jack does exactly that, laying down to sleep with his head in her lap, while the camera pans upon a lush green meadow and a sparkling brook nearby. (This sort of "flower girl" is strangely reminiscent of a certain kind of Plant Person - Namely a girl who lives in a flower, and invites male humans to rest. More information on the Plant Person page.)
-   _The Simpsons_
    -   In "Treehouse of Horror IX", Maggie grows a single long, sharp tooth, and loses her arms and legs to be replaced by green tentacles. It is revealed that Marge was abducted and impregnated by Kang, the green-tentacled alien. Marge tells Homer what happened in a flashback. She was chosen for a cross-breeding program and told "To put you at ease, we have recreated the most common spawning locations of your species. You may choose either the back seat of a Camaro, an airplane bathroom, a friend's wedding, or the alley behind a porno theatre." Marge sits on a couch (she chooses the alley) with Kang, and he flashes a beam of light at her, and says "Insemination complete." Marge remarks that it was awfully quick; Kang asks what she's implying and she quickly says, "Nothing."
    -   In "Insane Clown Poppy", Krusty recalls meeting a beautiful female soldier at a USO show during The Gulf War. He persuades her to sleep with him, and they go offscreen. Cut to a view of the oil fields burning down like candles.
-   _The Smurfs (1981)_ special "Smurfily Ever After" gives us G-Rated Marriage Consummation, when Smurfette imagines herself being married to Hefty, he takes her into his house, gets (partially) undressed, and wants to get all "hot and sweaty" with Smurfette... by doing exercises with her!
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   Fusions are a manifestation of the relationship of the components given physical form, including feelings of romance (involving various amounts of sexuality). Fusion also serves as a frequent vehicle for Aesops pertaining to consent and communication—though these tend to be applied even to fusion _without_ any romantic or sexual implication.
    -   In "Joking Victim", Sadie mentions she got a video game for Lars, they played together, and she spent the entire night with him. When Steven says it must have been a good game, Sadie's hesitant agreement implies they didn't spend most of that night playing video games. Later, Sadie angrily asks Lars if that time together meant anything to him, but refers to it as "That night we played video games", and it's ambiguous if her wording was for Steven's sake or the audience's.
    -   "We Need to Talk" is a Whole Episode Flashback to when Steven's parents first started dating, and generally makes it obvious they're having sex, especially their duet where Rose talks about how "fun" Greg is.
        
        **Greg:** Look... these last few months have been great—  
        **Rose:** Oh, _yes_.
