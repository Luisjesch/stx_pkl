**Jack:** I'm thinking it over!

A character displays uncertainty in a situation that you wouldn't expect to call for it. Usually, this takes the form of giving too much consideration to a "choice" that isn't really supposed to be one.

Sometimes, the choice the character is put before offers something they want or need, but accepting it would mean breaking some sort of a personal rule (like agreeing with the stupid member of the party). Or the character is just tired of being Surrounded by Idiots and the option of being killed sounds oddly inviting.

See also You Can Keep Her!.

This situation is always spawned by Skewed Priorities, and often implies or results in the character being Too Dumb to Live. But more often than not it is a Funny Moment. Would Rather Suffer is the related trope where the character actually _does_ choose the "wrong" option, or at least says they would if given the chance. Often combined with Death by Materialism.

    Radio 

-   _The Jack Benny Program_:
    -   The famous bit quoted above is the trope namer. The routine first appeared in the March 28, 1948 broadcast, in which Jack is robbed of Ronald Colman's Oscar after borrowing it. His uncertainty stems from the character's well-known stinginess: during the pause, which kept getting longer and longer, the audience was already laughing at the thought of Jack having to make such a difficult decision.
    -   The story of how the line was invented is also a bit of this trope. Short version: The writers came up with a lot of punchlines. They finally pinned one of the writers for his opinion and his response was "I'm thinking it over!" The longer version is here, although there are a few versions of the story floating about. The episodes are hilarious and well worth the listen.

    **Simmons:** Shouldn't you at least read us our charges?  
    **Soldier:** You know what you did. You were in charge of our ammunition, and you lost it all!  
    **Grif:** Don't you think it's ironic that you're about to shoot us because we don't have enough ammo? Also, "lost" and "sold to the other team"? Two totally different things.  
    **Soldier:** Oh, you're just delaying.  
    **Simmons:** Yes, that's true, but it's also true that you have to read us a list of charges. It's in the Red Army Handbook, section on firing squads, subsection 2.9C, page 94, third paragraph.  
    **Grif:** You are going to die a nerd. So sad.  
    **Simmons:** Do you want to die in the next two seconds, or do you want to die a nerd with me five minutes from now?  
    **Grif:** _\[Beat\]_

-   In _Penny Arcade_, Satan gives Tycho a choice — be tormented for all eternity or play the _Seed_ demo. Tycho says "Do I have to answer right now?", which isn't as much a case of him having Skewed Priorities as a Take That! against the _Seed_ demo.
