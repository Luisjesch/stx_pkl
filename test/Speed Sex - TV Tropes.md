_"There are Super Bowl commercials that last longer than you, Malcolm!"_

One of the standards of sexual prowess for a guy, at least in fiction, is how long sex with him can be expected to last. Thus, a male character's real or alleged inability to maintain a Raging Stiffie long enough for it to provide much pleasure for his partner is a frequent subject for insults, gossip, or self-deprecating humor. Sometimes it has implications of selfishness (if the guy is only interested in his own orgasm and assumes sex is over once it's happened) or inexperience/ineptitude (premature ejaculation also features often here) followed by a swift cry afterwards. Men might Think Unsexy Thoughts during the act to delay their orgasm.

While this can be a problem for men in Real Life, it tends to be exaggerated in fiction, mostly for purpose of comedy. You may also find numerous references to "seven minutes" out there in trope land. Rest assured; seven minutes is actually the median time for an act of human sexual congress, but that doesn't mean a _session_ can't last more than seven minutes!

Something that can be just as much of a problem—but rarely gets depicted in fiction—is an inversion when a guy can keep going and going without ever reaching an orgasm himself, no matter how hard he tries. In that case, a guy can get discouraged with sex, and worry that this inability to climax from sex with his partner will hurt their feelings. It is a more common problem for male virgins who have a lot of prior experience with masturbation: they find that actual sex feels different, and that two-way communication is required to figure out an arrangement that pushes the right buttons.

Note that Speed Sex is the norm for many animals, particularly prey species that can't afford to leave themselves vulnerable to attack for longer than a few seconds. For example, chimpanzees and gorillas both only have sex for about thirty seconds. The reason humans last so much longer than their closest cousins is because it's a different sexual strategy, which also explains the differences in our penis shapes and testicle sizes. Humans have the largest penis, chimps have the largest testicles, and gorillas are the smallest in both. Their penises are also pointy where humans have a bulbous head. Gorilla males compete to make sure they're the father by maintaining a harem and preventing other males from having access to sex with them, hence no need for much semen. Chimpanzees have large colonies with parity among the sexes, so the competition occurs inside the vagina, with chimps pumping out copious volumes of semen to flush out their competitors and leave a plug to prevent others doing the same. Meanwhile, human penises act as pumps to scoop out competitor's stuff (which takes a lot of time), but we hope to prevent a competitor doing the same so we need more volume than gorillas.

Compare The Loins Sleep Tonight for when he can't get it up in the first place and Lousy Lovers Are Losers for when someone is an overall unsatisfying lover. If the couple decides to do something else sexual instead, check Technical Virgin. A man ejaculating before he can even get his clothes off is Jizzed in My Pants.

-   In _The Wolf of Wall Street_, Jordan's first time having sex with Naomi lasts all of 11 seconds. How do we know it's 11 seconds? Because Jordan actually narrates the scene to tell the audience about it. It's subverted, though, because he still has an erection and is able to continue.
-   Enforced in _No Strings Attached (2011)_ when the lead characters first get it on. Emma has to get to work in ten minutes and doesn't want her roommate getting suspicious, so she tells Adam he has "45 seconds to make both ends meet". He manages to get her yelling in about twenty.

    Literature 

-   In Stephen King's _It_, Beverly's friend, Kay McCall (a feminist writer) says this about her ex-husband: "Two pumps a tickle and a squirt, that was ole Sammy's motto. The only time he could keep it up for longer than seventy seconds was when he was pulling off in the tub."
-   In _Joyland_, when the protagonist has sex for the first time, he lasts for about nine seconds. Luckily, he's soon ready for a second time... which lasts for four minutes. Third time is the charm.
-   Randy and Amy's first time in _Cryptonomicon_ is over as soon as it begins, mostly due to the fact that the encounter was one of the first things Randy did after spending several weeks in jail. He's horrified as to what Amy will say about this, but she thinks it's funny and just tells him to go shave.
-   The first time that John Kelly and Pamela Madden make love in _Without Remorse_, Kelly isn't able to last very long due to the fact he hasn't gotten laid in a while. Pamela, being the Hooker with a Heart of Gold, doesn't mind and the second time he does much better.
-   The first time we read of Mack Bolan having sex in the first _The Executioner_ book, this happens, but his partner, another Hooker with a Heart of Gold, also doesn't mind commenting that "You guys always come back (from the Vietnam War) full of TNT or something" and gives him another opportunity to do better.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The episode of _The West Wing_ where Abbey tells Bartlet his health is good enough to have sex again for the first time since he was shot.
    
    **Abbey:** We'll coordinate our schedules and find a free hour.  
    **Bartlet:** I don't think it's gonna take more than a couple minutes, but I appreciate your confidence.
    
-   In an episode of _Have I Got News for You_ they're talking about good songs to have sex to (because of Alan Clark's sex scandal) and Paul Merton says his would have to be the Minute Waltz.
-   _Home Improvement_ had a similar Minute Waltz joke.
-   _Friends_:
    -   In the episode that flashes back to the night Monica and Chandler hooked up, we see that once they agree to have sex, Chandler undressed really quickly. Monica remarks on this and Chandler replies, "It bodes well for me that speed impresses you."
    -   In one episode, when the others thought that Chandler was cheating on Monica because he was in a house with a woman for forty-five minutes (she was actually a realtor showing him around the house), Joey didn't think it made sense because he couldn't believe that Chandler could go forty-five minutes.
    -   In a flashback episode, Rachel finds it romantic when her then-boyfriend promises that the next time they have sex, it'll last a whole song.
-   Al Bundy from _Married... with Children_ is constantly mocked for his "5-second sex". This was exaggerated after Al had to abstain from sex for a month due to a mix-up at the hospital giving him a circumcision - it lasts _two_ seconds, but the impact is enough to shake the house.
    -   And averted in the episode "Til Death Do Us Part" where Al, tired of being mocked for this trope, manages to get his stamina to a point where he and Peg have sex for _two full days_.
    -   One episode had Kelly put on toast as Al and Peg were walking upstairs to have sex. They undressed, had sex, got dressed, and were walking down the stairs in the amount of time it takes to toast bread in a toaster.
-   _That '70s Show_
    -   In the episode "The Velvet Rope", Jackie and Kelso are shown kissing and laying down on her bed. The camera then shifts to a 1970s-style digital clock as it ticks away... two minutes.
    -   Implied in the episode "Afterglow", when Donna is talking to Jackie about how her first time having sex with Eric went.
        
        **Donna:** I mean, during it, I just remember thinking, "This is it. This is what everyone..."  
        **Jackie:** Everyone what?  
        **Donna:** That's as far as I got.
        
-   _Blackadder_ had several examples, such as a "time passes" fade to the post-sex cigarette with a title card reading "Two Minutes Later."
-   _The Golden Girls_:
    -   This and being an incurable skirt-chaser are the defining traits of Dorothy's ex-husband, Stan. In fact, Stan's lack of stamina is mentioned more than his infidelity by Dorothy, specifically, the night that resulted in her Shotgun Wedding was retold as "It took three seconds. I wasn't sure we did anything... until nine months later when the baby came."
    -   The crowner was in an episode where _Blanche_ starts dating Stan. Blanche insists nothing is happening, but Dorothy doesn't believe her. When they're out very late one night, Dorothy asks what they could be doing.
        
        **Sophia**: You know what they're doing.  
        **Dorothy**: I also know Stan, we were married for 38 years. And if you add up all the time we did what they're doing right now, Blanche still should have been home 15 minutes ago.
        
-   _Frasier_;
    -   In an episode that had a running gag of characters making Innocent Innuendo and being overheard and misunderstood, Niles walks in just in time to completely misinterpret Roz lamenting how an elderly friend in a retirement home died, and so gives a suspiciously indignant reaction...
        
        **Roz**: One minute he's lying in bed, smiling and happy, and ten seconds later it's over.  
        **Niles**: Oh for heaven's sake, it happens to every man a couple of times in his life! Why can't you women take it as a compliment?
        
    -   There was a caller who complained on Frasier's radio show about her boyfriend, one of the complaints was she'd been vaccinated slower.
-   In _Misfits_, Nathan ejaculates within seconds after a scene of intense foreplay involving kissing, removal of clothes, and intimate touching. Ruth laughs - not at Nathan's sexual mistake but at the face he pulls during orgasm. Thankfully, she lets him have another go, but unfortunately turns into an 82-year-old woman (her true form) as she orgasms. The other characters find out and mock him, particularly as it becomes apparent he went down on her.
-   _The New Statesman_ (the tv series, not the newspaper) has a Running Gag that, in addition to his Teeny Weenie, sex with Alan lasts 30 seconds: in one episode he and his wife use sex as an egg timer. Strangely, his frequent talk of his sexual prowess often includes references to his lack of stamina, and he seems to consider it a point of pride that he's "getting quicker". But then, expecting Alan B'Stard to be a considerate sexual partner...
-   _The Secret Life of the American Teenager_: According to Amy, her first time with Ricky was "like two seconds". He must have just been having an off night, since he's shown to be quite the ladies' man with everyone else and when he and Amy get together officially, they have great sex.
-   _House_: The episode "Nine to Five" shows Cuddy and her boyfriend having (at his insistence) sex for anywhere from one to a whopping two minutes.
-   Parodied several times in _Le cœur a ses raisons_. One occurrence had Brett and Criquette "making love" solely by bumping their nether regions together _while still fully clothed_, and another lasted approximately the time of a quick camera swoop, unclothing time included.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. Faith can't resist getting in a snarky line upon meeting Xander's new girlfriend. (Xander was a virgin when Faith slept with him so was rather inexperienced, and Slayers are also considered something of a Sex Goddess, so she should really cut him some slack).
    
    **Anya:** We were going to light a bunch of candles and have sex near them.  
    **Faith:** Well, we certainly don't want to cut into that seven minutes.
    
-   In _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_, Rhaskos is not considerate of his partner's pleasure. Whenever he has sex, he pumps as hard and fast as he can until he orgasms then stops and pulls out.
    -   Averting this trope is a plot point in the episode "Whore." Spartacus has been contracted by a high-class Roman woman for something more intimate than a standard gladiator match, and Lucretia points out that Spartacus has been bereft of female companionship for quite some time, and might not be up for this particular challenge. When they send another slave to make sure Spartacus has some stamina, and she explains this, he replies "The notion offends me."
-   In _24_: In the penultimate episode of Season 5, Martha Logan is forced to seduce Charles Logan as part of a ploy to expose his actions. The episode ends with them undressing the next one (roughly 2 minutes later) starts with them _putting their clothes back on_.
-   _Saturday Night Live_. One sketch plays with this when a speed reader (Will Forte) succeeds in a bar patron (Halle Berry) wanting to get with him and then quickly exits the scene.
    
    **Patron:** (_sultry_) Enough with the talk, let's do this thing!  
    **Speed Reader:** Ohhh, we just did - twice! Yeah, I am that fast! And, don't worry, it was good for me, too. Good night, my lady!
    
-   In an episode of _Spin City_, Paul uses sex with his wife as part (albeit a very short part) of an alibi.
    
    **Mike:** And how long did that take?  
    **Paul:** I don't know. How long is "the Hollywood Minute"?  
    **Mike:** All right, well, I'm satisfied. Claudia probably less so.
    
-   Subverted in _The Flash (1990)_. Sometime after Barry Allen acquires his super-speed powers, we see him in bed with his girlfriend Iris. She's expressing her disappointment that "it" over so quickly. Barry agrees — because they were talking about a pay-per-view boxing match on TV, that lasted only a minute or so.
-   _The Flash (2014)_. In "The Nuclear Man", Barry Allen's so-called friends don't exactly help his confidence over his budding romance with Linda by speculating about this trope.
    
    **Cisco:** Aren't you worried about moving too fast?  
    **Barry:** No, what do you mean? It's a _second_ date.  
    **Cisco:** No, no, no, no. I meant _going_ too fast. Look, I mean, you're fast, but there's fast and then there's _fast_. Am I being subtle enough?  
    **Barry:** No, you're really not.  
    **Caitlin:** Cisco is right. With your increased blood flow and increased heart rate, theoretically, your speed could cause you to...  
    **Barry:** _\[eyerolls\]_
    
-   _Smallville_: In "Instinct" Maxima arrives on Earth in search of a Kryptonian to be her perfect mate. Her dialogue implies she's too much of a Sex Goddess for anyone to handle her for long, as mere kisses from her cause normal men to Jizzed in My Pants. When Clark proves his strength to her, she's thrilled.
    
    **Maxima**: _Finally_. A man with some fight in him. None of the men on my planet have the stamina to _keep up._
    
-   _You (2018):_ Stalker with a Crush Joe watches Beck and her boyfriend have sex and smugly notices that it didn't last long and the boyfriend failed to make her orgasm. But when Joe finally gets the chance to sleep with Beck he lasts all of eight seconds, leaving her very unimpressed with him. It turns out to be a one-time thing for Joe, and he and Beck end up having a very satisfying sex life (he's a stalker and a murderer and genuinely disturbed, so, you know, it's not a _great_ relationship).
-   In _Gilmore Girls,_ when Rory and Jess start dating, Luke tells Lorelei not to worry about any funny business, because he never leaves them alone for more than ten minutes at a time. Lorelei comments that ten minutes was about how long it took her to make Rory in the first place, including freshening up afterward.
-   Combining this with Jizzed in My Pants, in the episode "The Skank Reflex Analysis" of _The Big Bang Theory_ Penny gets drunk and winds up in bed with Raj, of all people. She doesn't remember what happened, and he explains later that he, \*ahem\*, _finished_ as she was helping him put on the condom.
    
    **Penny:** So, we didn't...?
    
    **Raj:** _I_ did. It was beautiful.
    
-   _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_: One Scenes From a Hat suggestion was "Songs about life's most embarrassing moments".
    
    **Wayne** (singing): We made love at 5:06 and I was done by 5:07!
    
-   _The Fixer_. The protagonist is let out of prison after five years to act as a government hitman. He sleeps with a woman called Rose, only to discover she's a Honey Trap for his new employer.
    
    **Rose:** Ah well, don't be too hard on yourself. I mean it had been a while hadn't it? _Which showed_.
    
-   _The Punisher (2017)_. When David Lieberman returns to his wife after faking his death and going into hiding for a year, she hauls him into the bathroom for some frantic yet fumbling sex that ends with David coming too fast because it's been so long, which both find Actually Pretty Funny.
-   _Sex/Life_: Cooper often goes too fast while having sex with Billie, though she urges that he do it slower, and this seems to be a part of why she's unsatisfied.
-   _Fantasy Island (2021)_: While in Zev's body, Daphne has sex with him (switched into hers), but then she comes almost immediately.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_. In "The Q and the Grey", Q offers to mate with Captain Janeway, but she convinces him to mate with a female Q instead. She goes to Leave the Two Lovebirds Alone, but can't resist sneaking back for a peek (For Science!). Despite Q bragging earlier that "foreplay for a Q can last for decades, the act itself doesn't last long at all.
    
    _(The two Qs touch right forefingers, which glow briefly.)_
    
    **Q:** Oh! I was good, wasn't I?
    
    **Female Q:** Very good.
    
    **Janeway:** _(incredulous)_ That was it?!!
    
    **Q:** You had your chance. Don't go crying about it now.
    
-   A skit on _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson_ featured Lois Lane and Clark Kent getting married. Kent reveals he is Superman and the two get into bed to engage in sex. The lights go out then come back on three seconds later to show the two smoking a cigarette.

-   _Utopia (US)_: When Becky and Ian have sex, he comes almost immediately. She doesn't mind, saying everything else is getting in the way of coming.

    Music 

-   Flight of the Conchords' song "Business Time" discusses this.
    
    _Making love  
    Making love for  
    Making love for two  
    Making love for two minutes  
    (When it's with me, you only need two minutes, 'cause I'm so intense)_
    
-   Lily Allen's "It's Not Fair" is about resenting her (otherwise very decent) boyfriend for being crap in bed:
    
    I look into your eyes, I want to get to know you  
    But then you make this noise, and it's apparently all over
    
-   Swedish rock singer Magnus Uggla's "4 sekunder" ("4 Seconds") is about a guy with this problem.
-   The Lonely Island / Akon's "I Just Had Sex". "Best thirty seconds of my life!"
-   Mötley Crüe's "Ten Seconds to Love" is an ode to quickies.
-   _The Macc Lads_ had a song called "Two-Stroke Eddie" which is pretty self-explanatory. "He just made a mess / All over me dress..."
-   Inverted in the infamous "Make It Last All Night", featured in _For Your Eyes Only_.
-   J.B.O. made a "Smells Like Teen Spirit" parody titled "Ejaculatio praecox" which is about just this. The singer's solution: listen to music while doing it, more specifically, listen to Nirvana.
-   "One Minute Man" by Missy Elliott is all about expecting the guy to do better than this trope.
-   Ninja Sex Party has "Three Minutes of Ecstasy", which according to the song, is the longest Danny can last.

    Two great big humps and then I'm gone_
    
-   In TRAMP STAMPS' "I'd Rather Die", the narrator complains that the guys she has sex with only last "like one or two seconds".

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _Dragon Magazine_ article "The Ecology of the Catoblepas" attributes that D&D monster species' very existence to this trope. It attests that the catoblepas is an example of Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism, in which the females are bulky long-necked quadrupeds with a deadly breath attack, while the males are speedy kangaroo-like grazers. The males wait until a female has her head underwater, grazing on swamp vegetation, then rush up and mate _very quickly_ before she can lift her long neck above the surface.

    Theater 

-   Near the beginning of _Next to Normal_, Dan teasingly complains to his wife Diana that he's going to be late for work because they were having sex. Her sarcastic reply goes largely unheard.

-   _Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier_: As part of Prince Achmed's "I Am Great!" Song, one of his soldiers makes the claim that the prince "can pleasure sixty concubines in only an hour," to which Achmed brags "Less!" Given the tone of the song, the implication is clearly not that Achmed can't last very long, but that he's so overwhelmingly manly that his partners are satisfied in less than a minute.

-   This quote from _Camp Camp_:
    
    **Max:** There comes a time when a group must fight back against tyranny. Like the minutemen of the Revolution, we will fight for our independence!  
    **Space Kid:** Minuteman... Mommy calls Daddy that when they argue.
    
-   _One Minute Fly_: The fly in the first video manages to "produce descendants" with a mate in the span of just one second.
-   _OverSimplified_; In part one of the "The Napoleonic Wars" video, Napoleon gets into an argument with Josephine which ends with him saying he going spend the next thirty minutes in conference with his generals, and by "Conference with his generals" he really means "boinking his mistress" and by "30 minutes", he really means "2 seconds".<sup>Note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Zero Punctuation_: When Yahtzee isn't making fun of everyone else (Your Mom in particular) or pointing out how not gay he is, he's joking about his atrocious sex life.
    
    \[On _Modern Warfare_\] The single-player mode is short as fuck, and let me tell you when I'm around fucks are legendarily short. \[Two pairs of eyes in darkness with the speech "Sorry".\]

-   _French Baguette Intelligence_: In ''Art vs "Art" video", Fuck Cares uses making excuses regarding this as an example of why it is bad to tolerate mediocrity instead of striving for excellence, pointing out how hypocritical television programmes are for promoting the 'it's not about winning; it's about having fun' mantra, despite people's attitudes towards this when it comes to sex.
    
    **Faux Cares:** Not to mention the whole "It's not about winning" bullshit is a corny anthem for mediocrity. Imagine people doing that in bed…  
    **Cleopheobs:** Hun… You came first again…  
    **Faux Cares:** It's not about winning, babe. It's about having fun.  
    **Sigma Council:** Sigma Rule #1: Never let a woman come before you. A true racer always finishes first.  
    **Faux Cares:** They call me Lightning McQueen.

-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "Life on the Fast Lane", after Marge and Homer have resolved their Marriage Problem of the Week, Marge surprises Homer at work:
        
        **Homer:** Marge! What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?  
        **Marge:** Of course! _\[cuddles and kisses him on the cheek\]_  
        _\[Homer picks her up and carries her past his co-workers who're cheering "Way to go, Homer, Way to Go!"\]_  
        **Worker:** Hey, what will I tell the boss?  
        **Homer:** Tell him I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!
        
    -   "And Maggie Makes Three" has a joke about this and Maggie's conception. Homer and Marge are kissing in bed; cut to a "Seconds Later" title card, and a mini-Homer sperm joins an egg saying "Woo-hoo!".
    -   In "Treehouse of Horror IX", Marge gets abducted by Kang and Kodos to be impregnated. After selecting The Alley Behind a Porno Theater from a list of "common human spawning locations" (the other options were the backseat of a car and a friend's wedding):
        
        **Kang:** Look behind you! _\[Marge looks, Kang fires a green ray at her\]_ Insemination complete!  
        **Marge:** Really? That seemed awfully quick.  
        **Kang:** _What are you implying?_  
        **Marge:** Nothing... Nothing...  
        **Kang:** _\[checks imaginary watch\]_ Oh, look at the time, I've got to go. You're a super gal, though. Call you some time! _\[dumps Marge out of the spaceship\]_
        
    -   In "22 Short Films About Springfield", Apu intentionally provokes this: It's over in two seconds, as he's in a hurry.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   In the episode "PTV", the FCC starts censoring real life. When Lois and Peter are about to have sex, a guy from the FCC appears:
        
        **FCC man:** Whoa, whoa, whoa. Those actions are highly inappropriate.  
        **Lois:** What? Wait a minute. We're not allowed to have sex?  
        **FCC man:** Oh, you can have sex, just no moaning, no tongue-kissing, no thrusting, no movement whatsoever.  
        \[_Beat_\]  
        **Lois:** Well, this isn't very romantic. I mean, how are we supposed to...  
        **Peter:** I'm done. 'Night, Lois. _(falls asleep on top of her)_
        
    -   In the movie, Stewie arranges his loser future self, Stu to lose his virginity to his co-worker, Fran, which turns out badly:
        
        **Stu:** I'm sorry. That's, um... That's never happened to me before.  
        **Fran:** Which part? The eight seconds of sex, or the 40 minutes of crying?
        
    -   The episode "Blind Ambition" has a scene in which we can hear Peter and Lois having sex with the sound of all the coins Peter has ingested jangling around inside him, which lasts about ten seconds.
    -   In a cutaway sequence, Peter is surprised to find Superman playing cards in hell. Superman replies that he killed a hooker after she made the well-worn "faster than a speeding bullet" crack.
    -   Happened to Spider-Man in another cutaway, except in his case, he accidentally sprayed webs all over his unfortunate partner.
    -   This is something of a Running Gag with Peter, especially how unsatisfied Lois is with his lack of staying power. In fact, Brian and Stewie wrote a song about it.
        
        **Stewie:** When everybody's gone to sleep, and you've said "Goodnight Moon", there's plenty of noise still coming from Mommy and Daddy's room.  
        **Brian:** Oh, Daddy says, "Please." Mommy says, "No."  
        **Stewie:** Daddy says, "C'mon!" Mommy says, "Whoa!"  
        **Brian:** Daddy goes "Uhh!" Mommy goes, "Ow!"  
        **Stewie:** Daddy says, "I'm done." Mommy goes, "Wow..."  
        **Stewie & Brian:** Daddy rolls over and falls asleep. Mommy drinks wine in the dark.
        
    -   In "FOX-y Lady" a cutaway gag showed Lois dating John Moschitta, the world's fastest talking man from the Fed-Ex commercials and the sex they had was under three seconds.
-   _Futurama_: In "Zapp Dingbat", Leela's mom begins dating Leela's douchey ex-lover Zapp Brannigan, so to prove his intentions aren't pure, Leela propositions him right before her mom is scheduled to come home. She asks him, "Have your way with me for the next thirty seconds," and while he turns her down, he says that'd be more than enough time.
-   Joked about in the _Justice League_ episode "Injustice for All, Part 1", much like the above old joke about Superman.
-   _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_ has a similar joke in an episode in which Black Canary, Huntress and Catwoman sing a very innuendo-filled song about various male heroes:
    
    "_Flash's foes, they finish last  
    Too bad sometimes he's just too fast!_
    
-   A Running Joke in _Bojack Horseman_ is BoJack's total lack of staying power. At one point, he finishes before penetrating Princess Carolyn. Another night, he finishes before Princess Carolyn even gets into bed!
-   _Duckman_ considers _40 seconds_ to be impressive.
-   _American Dad!_ had an unusual variation in "Poltergasm". Rather than being physically unable to keep going, Stan had started seeing sex as one of his missions, where the "target" was all that mattered. Since Francine didn't want to hurt his feelings, she was unable to tell him that she wasn't getting off that way, a situation that got worse to the point that a poltergeist phenomenon was created from her repressed sexual frustration.
-   _Robot Chicken_: Used in one of the home movie clips from the "Bloopers" segment. In this case, it was a clip from a hidden camera set up by the man in question, who's also one of the writers for Robot Chicken. He lasted about two seconds.
    
    **Girl**: You have failed _me_ as a boyfriend, and you have failed _yourself_ as a man, Robot Chicken co-head writer Douglas Goldstein!
    
-   _South Park_: In "Butters' Bottom Bitch", Yates' first client only lasts around 10 seconds.
