Geoffrey Chaucer (_Galfridus Chaucer_, _El Jefe_, _L.L. Cool Geoff_) (c. 1343 – 25 October 1400) was an English author, poet, philosopher, bureaucrat, courtier and diplomat. Although he wrote many works, he is best remembered for his unfinished frame narrative _The Canterbury Tales_. Sometimes called the "father of English literature", Chaucer is widely credited as first demonstrating the artistic legitimacy of the vernacular (post-Conquest) (Late Middle) English language as opposed to French or Latin, and thus, he is the one who made stories accessible to the general, uneducated, illiterate-in-English-let-alone-Latin-or-French average Joe.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Chaucer's works were among the earliest printed in English, which did much to establish his southern dialect as "correct" written English. He is buried in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. He is in fact the _reason_ it is called the Poet's Corner. Of course, he owed his Westminster Abbey grave to his services to the crown (or at least to John of Gaunt), _not_ his literary eminence.

As a character, Chaucer appears in _A Knight's Tale_, where he is played by Paul Bettany.

He ended at #81 in _One Hundred Greatest Britons_.
