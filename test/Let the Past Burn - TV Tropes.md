_"The house held those years of abuse and she wanted it all to burn but, more importantly, she wanted to destroy him along with it. She was forced to marry him and he had beaten her, battered her, used and abused her and she wanted to destroy the house, her memories, and him, releasing those years of pent-up rage and pain."_

Sometimes, a house or other building is central to a story. Usually it is the residence of the protagonist or antagonist. It may have a significant history, either special or sinister. It may even carry a family curse. By living there, a character may be unknowingly tying themselves to the past, or to their old ways.

Then that building is burnt down, destroying those memories of the past with it.

The huge material loss suffered by the owner of the house is generally peripheral to the story, with the real point of the trope being that the fire symbolizes letting go of the things from the past that were tied to the house and being able to finally embrace the future.

One or more characters, dead or alive, may be burnt along with the house. A villainous or deranged character who lights such a fire is likely to perish in this way - perhaps with the hero trying unsuccessfully to save them.

This trope is almost always an Ending Trope, as it gives an effective close to the story and symbolically lays the past to rest. Tends toward a Bittersweet Ending. It is used particularly in Gothic Literature.

Simply having a previously unmentioned or unimportant house burn down is not sufficient for this trope. Examples should make clear the value of the building and/or the significance of the fire, to avoid being considered a Zero-Context Example.

Related to, but distinct from, Kill It with Fire and Fire Purifies, which are about fire as a weapon for killing. Also related to Burn Baby Burn, which is about burning smaller significant objects. See also It's All Junk. Destroy the Abusive Home is a subtrope of this which has a character destroying the home or other place where they or a loved one were put through hell. Where I Was Born and Razed is about a character pulling this trope (and maybe even expanding it into a whole Doomed Hometown) For the Evulz.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Elric brothers' Origins Arc in _Fullmetal Alchemist_ ends with them burning down their late mother's home where they grew up before they go out on a quest to get back Al's body (which was lost in an attempt to resurrect their mom in that very house). _They_ say it's so they won't ever be tempted to turn back from the goal they've set. Hohenheim doesn't agree with this line of thinking and says they really did it so they wouldn't have to face their mistakes, comparing the act to a child trying to burn the evidence of their soiled bedsheets after wetting the bed. Ed's attempted response isn't very convincing to either his dad or the audience.
-   This type of ending was used at least more than once in the 1988 anime _Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics_. The _Bluebeard_ episode ended this way, and _Hansel & Gretel_ had the witch's house getting struck by lightning and burning down, and the kids reunited with their father the next day.
-   The finale of _Hell Girl_'s first season ends with Ai Enma burning a temple down because she has come to forgive its builder for betraying her centuries ago.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood_: Johnathan's house burning down marks the end of the first arc, and the Genre Shift from Glamorous Manly Victorian Melodrama to Glamorous Manly Supernatural Horror-Adventure.
-   Kenshin does this in the flashback sections of _Rurouni Kenshin_ (adapted as the _Trust & Betrayal_ OVA) burning down the house where he lived with his first wife Tomoe until her Heroic Sacrifice to double as both a funeral pyre for her and to emphasize his recommitting to his role as an assassin.

    Comic Books 

-   At almost-not-quite the end of _Batman: The Dark Knight Returns_, Alfred burns down Wayne Manor so that nobody can look through it for evidence or clues after Batman's identity as Bruce Wayne is revealed to the public while faking his death. Symbolically, Alfred dies of a stroke right afterwards.
    -   _Batman_ Rogues Gallery member Black Mask burnt down his family's mansion to disassociate himself from his former identity as Roman Sionis.
-   Eric Draven burns down his old house during the events of _The Crow_ just before going out on his Roaring Rampage of Revenge against Dollar Bill and his gang.
-   The first arc of the 2014 _The Dead Boy Detectives_ series by Toby Litt ends with St. Hilarion's, the boarding school Edwin and Charles attended where they both ended up killed, burning to the ground. Neither Edwin nor Charles are particularly upset that St. Hilarion's is no more.
-   _Prince of Persia: The Graphic Novel_ ends its 9th-century storyline with the usurper burning down the royal palace with himself rather than surrendering it to Prince Guiv. Much of the 13th-century storyline is set in the ruins of this palace.
-   In the final _Punisher Max_ arc "Homeless", after the death of Frank, Nick Fury takes a flamethrower to the house where the Castle family used to live and where Frank had been staying during the events of the arc. By doing so he hopes to put an end to the tragedy that made The Punisher once and for all.

    Fan Works 

-   _Artemis's Liege_ has Rogue doing this and Destroy the Abusive Home (because of Mystique's manipulations) in order to prove to herself that she's moving on and leaving the past behind.
-   _The Choices That Make Us_: Snape burns down his mother's family's mansion after the First Wizarding War due to guilt about all the atrocities the Death Eaters committed there.
-   _Dread String of Fate_: Whenever Marinette attempts to take down or get rid of her pictures of Adrien, they mysteriously return to her walls. Luka helps her gather them up and dispose of them in a bonfire in hopes of getting rid of them for good.
-   This, along with Destroy the Abusive Home, occurs in _Kiryuuin Chronicles_, when a mentally ill Ragyo, after dealing with years of her husband's abuse throughout their marriage, along with the memories and psychological damage thereof, in a fit of pent up rage burns their house down, destroying the house and killing him (whether or not she killed him in the fire or before she started to torch the house is never said).
    
    **Satsuki**: The house held those years of abuse and she wanted it all to burn but, more importantly, she wanted to destroy him along with it. She was forced to marry him and he had beaten her, battered her, used and abused her and she wanted to destroy the house, her memories, and him, releasing those years of pent-up rage and pain.
    
-   Whenever the Shinra mansion is mentioned, half the time it will (or already has) go up in flames. This trope is inevitable when half the cast has negative experiences with one building.
-   _The Victors Project_: At the end of the story, after Luster and his Snowmen are defeated, it's implied that Enobaria uses the opportunity to burn down the arena of her original Games, which Luster's people had been using as a hideout. Nobody outright accuses her, and none of her fellow Victors hold it against her since they would do the same thing in her place.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Castle in the Sky_ ends with the main characters Pazu and Sheeta casting the Spell of Destruction to bring an end to the titular castle Laputa, the last surviving remnant of a highly advanced civilization that abandoned it to live on Earth. This also ends up doing in the Big Bad Colonel Muska, who aimed to reclaim the castle as his birthright and Take Over the World using it as a superweapon. In a twist, only the Advanced Ancient Acropolis bottom portion was destroyed. The upper level that was reclaimed by nature detached from it to fly higher than before, safe from the greedy hands of people like Muska.
-   _Kung Fu Panda 2_. Lord Shen is so determined to kill Po, the legendary warrior who is prophesized to defeat him, he orders his cannon to open fire on his own palace. This isn't just Pragmatic Villainy but is related to Shen's issues with his parents, foreshadowed when Shen has his father's throne tossed out the window of the palace, then puts a cannon in its place. In the end, Shen's failure to let go of the past is what defeats him.
    
    **Lord Shen:** You were wrong, soothsayer. We sail to victory tonight. Your magic panda is clearly a fool.  
    **Soothsayer:** Are you certain it is the panda who is a fool? You just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen!  
    **Lord Shen:** A trivial sacrifice... _(plunges spear into a brazier of burning coals, uses it to set fire to a map of China)_ ...when all of China is my reward!
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the film _Andersonville_ after the defeat of the Raiders their base was burned, symbolic of the end of their reign of terror.
-   In _Batman Begins_, the film's Darkest Hour is when Ra's al Ghul incapacitates Bruce Wayne, then sets Wayne Manor on fire and leaves Bruce to die there. Continuing his father's legacy (in this case, making Gotham a better, safer city) is one of Bruce's major motivations. Bruce is convinced at that moment that he's completely ruined Thomas's legacy, and the destruction of his father's house is a very concrete representation of that.
-   _Battle For Sevastopol_. The sniper instructors make the female trainees burn all feminine articles in their possession—from clothes to personal items—to show them they need to toughen up for the war they're about to fight.
-   _Braindead_ ends this way, presumably destroying the remaining zombies.
-   The ending of _Citizen Kane_ is a loose example, differing only in that the whole house isn't burnt but the namesake of "Rosebud": Kane's childhood sled.
-   _Django Unchained_: Ends with Django and his wife leaving an exploding slave plantation, on horseback determined to live a free life.

His wife had committed suicide after the death of their baby. With his home gone and as a wanted man, Balian joins his father and leaves for Jerusalem. The soundtrack that plays as the house burns is named ‘Burning the Past”.
-   A rare positive example in 1929 film _Linda_. Linda's husband, the backwoods logger Decker, has died. Rather than let someone else muck up the little cabin that Decker loved so much, Linda decides to send it up to him in heaven. So she sets it on fire and watches it burn as the movie ends.
-   _Lou_. The title character is shown burning classified documents and film before putting a rifle under her chin with the intention of committing suicide. The events of the film intervene, and we later discover it was blackmail material she was using against the CIA, after having worked for them as a field agent. Ironically at the end of the movie the CIA are still searching for this material long after it's been destroyed.
-   Subverted in _Memento_. The protagonist suffers from a condition that prevents him from forming long-term memories. He says the last thing he remembers is his wife dying during a home invasion robbery, which prevents him from moving on from her death.

-   _Office Space_: Milton burns down the Initech building in revenge for the company's shabby treatment of him, in the process destroying Peter's letter of confession about embezzling money from the company.

-   At the end of _Psycho IV: The Beginning_, Norman Bates burns down his mother's old house, the place where all his unhappiness began. In a variation, he is nearly trapped inside, signifying his own difficulty in escaping his past.
-   _The Red Lanterns_: Anna's dreams of escaping a life of prostitution are crushed when her young lover Angelos dumps her. She comes back to the brothel, lights a cigarette, pulls out a picture of the two of them on a date, then uses the lighter to burn the picture.
-   The James Bond film _Skyfall_ has the titular manor burning down during the ending battle (with, of course, lots of explosions and such). This is very symbolic, as Bond has linked it throughout the movie with his childhood, and certain... psychological baggage he's carried with him from there.
    
    **Bond:** _\[As Skyfall burns down\]_ I always hated this place.
    
-   In _Star Wars: The Last Jedi_, one of the reasons why the disillusioned Luke Skywalker goes to Atch-To is to destroy the first Jedi Temple, believing that for all of their failures, it's time for the Jedi Order to end. After his will to do so falters, however, the Force-ghost of Yoda appears and summons a lightning bolt that splits the temple in half. He then tells Luke that it's time to stop dwelling on the past and ensure that the spirit of the Jedi Order survives.
    -   In the Fan Edit _The Rise of Skywalker: Resurgence_ by krausfadr, Kylo Ren continues in his belief of letting the past die, giving his father's home planet Corellia an Earth-Shattering Kaboom.

-   In _What About Bob?_, Dr. Leo Marvin's lakeside vacation house in New Hampshire is a symbol of his financial success at the cost of strained relationships with just about everyone. (His daughter calls the trip there "another vacation that isn't a vacation", and his neighbors—the Gutmans—hate Dr. Marvin because they were saving up to buy that house.) In the end, Dr. Marvin tries to kill Bob with explosives but ends up burning down the house instead. This is the straw that finally breaks Dr. Marvin, and in the next scene, he's more or less catatonic. And in the _next_ scene, Bob unintentionally shocks Dr. Marvin back into full consciousness. Whether or not Dr. Marvin learned anything from the ordeal is an open question.
-   Done at the end of _What's Eating Gilbert Grape_. The protagonists light the house on fire to burn along with their deceased morbidly obese mother who is on the top floor, as this is the only way to dispose of her body without public humiliation. In this case, the fire symbolises protection.
-   Near the end of the 1997 TV film of _The Woman in White_, Marian accidentally knocks over a lamp and sets fire to the church where her father was buried, trapping and killing Glyde and Sir Percival.

    Literature

-   Unusually for this trope, _The Dresden Files_ employs it smack in the middle of _Changes_. Harry's much-loved apartment is razed, with much of his possessions inside. To add insult to injury, he damages his spine while trying to help his elderly landlady, and is left paralyzed from the waist down. This leads to him accepting Mab's offer to become the Winter Knight, which in turn causes him to arrange his own murder at the end of the novel. The symbolism remains, though. It tells the reader that this book pulls no punches, and will live up to its name-Nothing Is the Same Anymore.

When Patrick learns why she wanted to burn the shed, he finishes the job for her.
-   The haunted hotel in _The Shining_ burns up and dissolves into nothingness.
-   _Tobacco Road_ ends with the squalid house burning down with Jeeter and Ada and everything they had, from a fire set by Jeeter to clear out the fields for planting. This was dropped from the play.

When the Doctor blows the unit up at the end of the episode in order to destroy some Daleks, Sarah is freed from her responsibility to it and decides to pursue her dream of travelling, while Nick is freed from the emotional baggage associated with his items; in fact, he deliberately lets them get destroyed by a Dalek Death Ray during a "Groundhog Day" Loop.

In "The Asylum", Dick Grayson—having realised that he can't give up being a masked vigilante, yet can't go back to being Robin again—burns his Robin costume in the flames of the eponymous Asylum (which they've just blown up). In the next episode, he mentions this to Donna Troy, who has given up being Wondergirl. She's a bit bemused as she just put her costume in a closet, given that those high-tech supersuits are expensive. Sure enough, Dick has to get a new supersuit for the Season Finale, and the guy making them is rather pissed that he destroyed the old one.
-   Following the death of her last surviving family member in _The Vampire Diaries_ Elena Gilbert burns down their family home, describing how the various items she destroys belonged to the various loved ones she had lost.

All they can do afterwards is watch helplessly as the flames consume it. This is shelter in which they have found refuge for over half a year, including a good part of winter, and viewers already know that it is still around another year before they will be rescued. It is strongly implied by the matches he finds and Coach Scott's behavior that he is the one in burns it down, in disgust at the girls' actions.

    Music 

-   "Burning House" by Cam, a 2015 hit that metaphorically used a burning house to symbolize the end of a relationship; a young woman therein has a dream that her now ex-boyfriend was trapped inside a burning house and she goes to save him, only for both of them to be killed in the flames.
-   The entire plot of Shawn Colvin's single "Sunny Came Home". However, the eponymous Sunny is not intent on doing away with her past, but rather her future.
-   The version of "Samson and Delilah" recorded by Shirley Manson for _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ invokes this, as "If I had my way, I'd tear this old building down" specifically changes to the last part to "I'd burn this whole building down".
-   "Independence Day" by Martina McBride. A strange triplicate example of this trope, Kill It with Fire, and Driven to Suicide, as the song is about escaping an abusive husband by burning down the house while the wife is in it with him.
-   P!nk's "Funhouse" is about her burning down the house she shared with her abusive boyfriend/husband.
-   "Blown Away" by Carrie Underwood plays with the idea. The house isn't destroyed by a fire but by a tornado. The protagonist of the song takes shelter from the tornado while letting her abusive father stay passed out on the couch without trying to wake him up, resulting in the house being destroyed and her father dying via Murder by Inaction.
-   "One More Minute" by "Weird Al" Yankovic contains the verse _"So I pulled your name out of my Rolodex / And I tore all your pictures in two / And I burned down the malt shop where we used to go / Just because it reminds me of you"_.

    Video Games

-   At the end of _5 Days a Stranger_, the mansion as well as the recently re-animated body of the then-unnamed DeFoe child is burnt down, freeing those that had been trapped within. Except for AJ and Philip Harty, who were dead before the fire started.
-   In _Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance_ _II_, the Ghost of House Felldane asks you to destroy Firewind Manor, in order to hide the evidence of the depravity his descendants have succumbed to. Serendipitously, the manor burns to the ground not long after during a dragon attack, fulfilling the ghost's wishes.
-   _BioShock_: When the government threatened to nationalize a forest he owned, Andrew Ryan burned it down. This was part of his motivation for planning to secede from the world.
-   _Dead by Daylight_’s Crotus Prenn Asylum suffers this fate, bringing with it the memories of Sally “The Nurse” Smithson and the more than 54 victims of her killing spree.
-   One of the end-goals of the Institute in _Fallout 4_ is to destroy all traces of the pre-war United States, to pave the way for _their_ own new order.
-   _Five Nights at Freddy's_ does this twice.
    -   _Five Nights at Freddy's 3_ has Fazbear's Fright — a horror attraction based on the unsolved mysteries of the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza — that contains several old relics from the pizzeria's history that end up burning to the ground, likely caused by faulty wiring.
    -   _Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator_ has its Golden Ending burn down the latest establishment with all of the haunted animatronics burning, too. This brings an end to serial killer William Afton and his daughter, as well finally putting to rest the souls of the murdered children haunting the original animatronics. As well as the owner of the current establishment, who is implied to have been William Afton's son _and_ the security guy from previous games. The fire was done on purpose, for this very reason.
-   At the end of _God of War: Ascension_, Kratos turns his house into a funeral pyre for Orkos.
-   At the end of _Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned_, Johnny and his fellow gang members burn down the gang's clubhouse. Considering that they've just killed the gang leader Billy for attempting to turn states' evidence, it can be seen as a symbol of the gang dissolving for good.
-   Well before _The Last Jedi_, the sentiment was expressed by Kreia in _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_. Kreia one-upped the Jedi above by brazenly manipulating the Exile into doing so. If you play Exile Dark-Side, they kill off all the remaining Jedi Masters, Darth Sion, and Darth Nihilus. If you play Light Side, _Kreia_ kills the Jedi when it becomes apparent that they can't understand what the Exile is, and then makes sure Exile destroys Nihilus and Sion. The Final Boss, of course, is herself. She's just as much part of the past she wants to be destroyed. The enclave at Dantooine is left to fall into ruin and be reclaimed by entropy. Atris' hideout on Telos is also ruined. The remains of the Malachor Sith temple are imploded. Kreia wasn't one to leave loose ends.
-   The plot of _Lucius_ is set in motion by a character performing satanic rituals in the basement of Dante Manor, which results in Lucius' soul becoming the property of the devil and him murdering the inhabitants of the house. During the final level, Lucius burns Dante Manor to the ground, along with the last of his victims, his father Charles.
-   Performing a meta version of this is a hallmark of many of Suda51's games (especially his aptly named "Kill The Past" series,) as protagonists from previous games have a tendency to either be confirmed dead in a later game, or show up alive, but only for a few minutes at best.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Umineko: When They Cry_: It's revealed that a huge stockpile of hidden explosives was used at the end of the second day of the Ushiromiya murder mystery which creates a huge crater on the island and destroys their mansion, the family members, and any evidence with it.
