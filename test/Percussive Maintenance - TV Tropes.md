Hey! I was watching that!

_"This is how we fix things on the Russian–"_ \[begins beating wrench against engine\] _"–Space Station!"_

Also known as "Technical Tap", this is a method of repairing malfunctioning devices by hitting 'em really hard. This is a case of Truth in Television, as many people will often do this with malfunctioning machinery, frequently with surprisingly mixed results.

A common variation involves a character, having tried every method they can think of to get something to work and after working for hours with no success, hits the malfunctioning device solely for the purpose of Percussive Therapy, only for the device to respond to the Percussive Maintenance and start working again.

Compare Percussive Therapy where a character hits things solely for their own emotional benefit, rather than the proper functioning of whatever they're hitting, Pressure-Sensitive Interface, when pushing the interface's buttons harder makes it work better, and Have You Tried Rebooting?, another common way of fixing malfunctioning technology.

Contrast Percussive Shutdown where the hit is intended to _stop_ a thing from working. Compare and contrast Healing Shiv, a weapon or technique designed specifically to heal and repair things attacked by it.

    Anime & Manga 

-   To quote Ran Kotobuki from one episode of _Gals!_:
    
    _"Electronic goods can be fixed by banging on them!"_
    
-   _City Hunter_: Kaori is convinced that if a machine does not work, a punch (or a kick. Or a mallet blow) will fix it. And if it keeps malfunctioning, you are not hitting it hard enough.
-   A more "realistic" example, in an episode of _Crayon Shin-chan_ has the Nohara family's television fuzzing up. Mitsae Nohara then attempts to fix it by slapping its side, and later its top when it starts showing double images, only to make it shut down instead.
-   _Digimon Adventure_: Taichi did this _a lot_.
    -   Used with some success in the fifth episode when Taichi rescues Andromon from under a pile of gears by kicking the gears.
    -   Also attempted in the sixth episode, where Koushiro's computer is acting up. Typically, both Taichi and Agumon say that all it needs is a good whack and charge at Koushiro, who then moves out of the way causing Taichi and Agumon to Cross Counter one another.
    -   Subverted nicely in _Our War Game_, where Taichi hits his father's computer (the monitor, not the main system) when WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon on the internet slow down. The computer promptly does a BSOD... completely paralysing their Digimon.
-   _Digimon Adventure: (2020)_: Whenever Izzy's computer is on the fritz, Tai and Augumon always suggest to whack it until starts working again.
-   _Digimon Tamers_: In the English dub, Calumon is dismayed to discover the schoolyard shed had been padlocked (and later supplemented with even more locks) due to Calumon's nightly break-ins to steal and play with a blacktop marker. Calumon's response is the apply some "gentle persuasion" to break the locks.
-   _Doraemon_:
    -   The early chapter that introduces the Time Cloth (one of the series' most recurring, frequently-used gadgets) have Nobita and Doraemon watching the Nobi household's old, cranky television set, and the screen finally fuzzing up causing Nobita and Doraemon to celebrate "finally, we're getting a new TV!" only for Nobita's mother, Tamako to come over and land a chop on its side, fixing the screen. At which point a frustrated Doraemon decides to just take out the Time Cloth and de-age their TV set to brand new. Tamako even lampshades the trope briefly, "You just need to know _where to hit_."
    -   An example that doesn't involve technology shows up in _Doraemon: Nobita's Dorabian Nights_, when Sinbad, Doraemon, and Nobita try spying on the escaped slaver, Abdil, through Sinbad's magic Pool of Visions. The pool suddenly gets fuzzy, and Sinbad hits its sides with his staff, so it becomes clear again. But then it starts getting fuzzy once more - cue Nobita, Doraemon and Sinbad hitting the whole thing simultaneously, to no avail. Nobita even lampshades "this thing is like an old TV!"
    -   In the 2021 remake of _Doraemon: Nobita's Little Space War_, The Dragon Dracorl had the heroes cornered in his battleship, too heavily-armed for Nobita and friends (even if they're giant-sized at the moment due to the Shrink Light's effects wearing off) to fight from up close. Just then, Nobita and friends are ambushed by several of Dracorl's tanks and drones, at which point they retaliate by grabbing several of Dracorl's machines and pounding on them, causing them to misfire and take down Dracorl's battleship.
-   Spike Spiegel of _Cowboy Bebop_, from whom comes one of the alternate names of the trope, claims, "My ship works better when I kick it." His attempt to fix an antique Betamax player in the same fashion, however, does not turn out so well. There's another point where they're trying to watch a television whose screen won't show anything until, after a pause, Spike brings his heel down on the top.
-   _Lupin III: The Columbus Files_ has Goemon doing this to the motorboat's engine. Lupin tries to do the same thing later but just breaks it further.
-   In the _Mahoraba_ manga, Megumi tries to fix a gas stove like this, calling it the "Russian Repair Method", possibly as a Shout-Out to _Armageddon_. It blows up (comedically) in her face.
-   One episode of _Martian Successor Nadesico_ sees Ruri repair a malfunctioning Jovian communication device by walking up, saying, "Kick," and giving it a swift boot to the side. Particularly hilarious since this happens right after the resident Gadgeteer Genius has declared that he has no idea how to fix something as crazily advanced as a Subspace Ansible.
-   In _SSSS.GRIDMAN_, when Yuta and Gridman along with the Neon Genesis crew get stuck in place during battle, Rikka opts to unplug the Grid computer to fix it to Utsumi's shock. After Utsumi tries to boot it up again, Rikka just gives it a small kick, bringing it back up and gets the others out.
-   In _Darker than Black_, Hei apparently fixes his landlady's TV by hitting it with his hand. This is our first hint at what Hei is capable of.
-   _Sola_: Matsuri Shihou does this. But it is understandable because she is Really 700 Years Old.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Jotaro kicks a scooter to start it up.
    -   Josuke's Stand ability is to restore things to their previous state (or at least what he perceives their previous state to be), which can bring about this trope when he does it by punching things really hard.
-   In one _Super Robot Wars_ manga, a character suggests "fixing" Tifa Adil's Demonic Possession problem with this. Garrod, obviously, isn't too happy at the start.
-   During Mihoshi's introduction in _Tenchi Muyo!_, she stomps her foot to correct her cruiser when it starts acting up. It actually makes her look pretty cool before the rest of the episode establishes her as a complete bubblehead.

-   In the second season of _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_ the members of Celestial Being try to get the titular Gundam's Twin Drive system to work but never seem to get it to stable operation, even with the hypothesized 'best combination' of 0 Gundam's and Exia's GN Drives. Guess how Setsuna gets it to work when the mothership gets attacked a few minutes later.
-   Used by Tamama in an episode of _Sgt. Frog_, where he fixes a machine with a rapid-fire punch attack. It does take a few tries to find the attack that works, though.
-   The whole premise of _Hikkatsu_ is centered on this, where geomagnetic abnormalities have led to a complete technological breakdown, with various electronics, vehicles, and appliances going berserk, and after his martial arts master is killed by a runaway construction vehicle, the main character tries to turn Percussive Maintenance into a martial art.
-   _Lucky Star_: When a CRT television goes on the fritz, Miyuki mentions having heard of cases where banging on it helped. Konata, having heard of that too, tries it, and it works. When Hiyori tries it later on her frozen desktop computer, however, it goes completely dead.
-   In _A Certain Magical Index_, Touma meets Mikoto for what he thinks is the first time when he just lost ¥2000 (roughly $20) to a juice vending machine.

-   One issue of _Paperinik New Adventures_ features an old and obsolete Evronian cruiser whose antimatter alternator often makes an annoying noise until a giant-size technician uses the "standard procedure": a powerful punch.

-   In _Splash_, when the character played by Tom Hanks gets stranded on the boat, it doesn't start until he opens the casing and whacks it with a hammer. At which point it promptly fires up, lunges forward, and pitches him overboard.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   In _Star Trek: First Contact_, Geordi points out a red light on the second engine valve during Cochrane's historic warp flight. Cochrane flicks the offending light a couple times, then whacks the side of the panel. It stays on. Having failed to correct it, he just brushes it off as unimportant. Cochrane also successfully does this with a jukebox.
    -   In _Star Trek Into Darkness_, Kirk manages to realign the housing of the warp core by kicking it with both feet. This is actually a _slightly_ more realistic example, as the goal in this case is to force the core back into position as opposed to banging on it until it works.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   Han Solo uses this method to fix a sputtering _Millennium Falcon_, in _The Empire Strikes Back_. Given the general state of the ship and Han's personality, it's a minor miracle that he only does this _once_. This was apparently an ad-lib by Harrison Ford when the lights on the Falcon prop failed to illuminate as expected. It would seem that hitting the prop actually did fix it.
    -   In the Expanded Universe, he does it often enough that he and Lando (the _Falcon_'s previous owner and one of Han's best friends) refer to it as "Emergency Repair Procedure Number One".
    -   Inverted in one instance in _Specter of the Past_, where for once the _Falcon_ is working fine until Chewie, manning the communications, gets mad at the guy on the other end and smashes the switch.

    -   Director Irvin Kershner said it was an homage to _The African Queen_ where Humphrey Bogart's character Charlie Alnutt beats the engine of his boat to get it to start it back up again.
    -   In _The Last Jedi_, a First Order officer assumes the monitor showing the status of _Supremacy_'s shield is on the fritz, and taps his finger on the display to restore it to normal. In reality, this was caused by DJ lowering the shield in that area, allowing Finn, Rose, and himself to board _Supremacy_.
-   In _The Strawberry Statement_, one of the protestors asks Simon to figure out why the Xerox machine isn't working. Simon presses a few buttons and whacks it a few times before he sees that it's not plugged in.
-   The Julie Andrews Movie Musical _Thoroughly Modern Millie_ (as well as the The Musical adaptation for the stage) featured an old-timey elevator that you had to tap-dance in to get started.
-   _Transformers: Dark of the Moon_: When Sam's car (not Bumblebee but some old "sad piece of shit") won't start, angry as he already is, his best resource is to open the hood and start kicking the engine frantically. It's a mix of this and Percussive Therapy.
-   Towards the end of _TRON: Legacy_, Kevin Flynn and Sam Flynn are sneaking around in Clu's "Rectifier" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Quorra's been captured, so Sam goes to rescue her while Kevin steals a Light Fighter. There's a Brainwashed program standing guard, so Kevin sneaks up behind it and fiddles with its Identity Disc so it would allow him access. It doesn't work. Frustrated, he bops the program on the head. It works.
-   Used by Peter Ustinov's character Jules in _We're No Angels_ (1955). He opens a lockbox by meditating, then tapping it with the edge of his hand.
-   In the opening of _WarGames_, one of the Air Force launch officers reports a warhead alarm on one of the missiles. The other officer tells him, "Tap it with your finger". He then taps the indicator light and it goes out, showing that the warhead was fine, it was just the alarm light was seated incorrectly.
-   During theStinger in _Wonka_, the Oompa-Loompa gets the projector working after it stops by thumping it.
-   _The X-Files: Fight the Future_: Mulder can't get his drink out of a vending machine. At first he whacks as if he might fix it, but then he just shakes it angrily. There is actually a bomb hidden inside that unplugged machine.

    Jokes 

-   Old joke: A man can't get his car working, so he gets it into a repair shop. The repairman turns over the engine a few times, then goes to his tool rack and grabs a hammer. He comes back, pops the hood, gives the engine one quick rap with the hammer, then turns the key, and — presto! Engine works. The repairman then hands the owner his bill for $220, to which the owner responds "What!? $220 for hitting it once with a hammer?" The repairman responds, "Nope, hitting with the hammer is only $20. The other $200 is for knowing where to hit it."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Literature 

-   _Artemis Fowl_: The telescreen freezes, and Foaly goes to repair it. Julius hits it to make it go back online, but that not only fails (with the narration making it clear that this almost never works) but he burns his hand because the screen gets hot after a time.
-   _At The Rialto_ by Connie Willis involves a group of Quantum Physicists at a convention. An overhead projector isn't working and one scientist explains that "it needs its fractal basin boundaries adjusted". She proceeds to whack it twice and it works.
-   _A Boy Made of Blocks_: A barista whacks the coffee machine like a malfunctioning TV set.
-   _The Cat Who Walks Through Walls_: The protagonists manage to rent a car from a very, _very_ low-cost rental agency and proceed to fly to the moon (they were already in space and the car's a spaceship). Being a budget rental, everything goes wrong as they try to land. At one point the computer (which controls the rockets) fails. The husband hits it. No go. He hits it again. No go. His wife hits it nearly hard enough to crack the casing. It comes back on. (Briefly.)
-   _Discworld_: In _Hogfather_, Archchancellor Ridcully asks if the term "Reboot" means to kick the computer. Ridcully also gets surprisingly good results by _threatening_ to hit HEX if it doesn't start doing what it's told, although this has more to do with HEX being at least partly sentient by this point than anything else.
-   _Flight of the Intruder_: Virgil Cole, a U.S. Navy bombardier, uses the Fix to keep his A6 bomber's balky primitive computer in line.
-   _Good Omens_: Lampshaded when one of the Bikers of the Apocalypse takes up the name "Things That Don't Work Even After You've Given Them a Good Thumping".
-   _Gotrek & Felix_: In _Daemonslayer_, Thanquol's new seeing crystal seems to work perfectly when he first tries it out, but its picture is quickly replaced by a haze of static that stays there until he gives it a sound thump to the side.
-   _Hondo Ohnaka's Not-So-Big-Score_: When one of Hondo's devices won't turn on, he hits it several times in anger before being told that it didn't turn on because he was hitting the off switch and not the on button.
-   _Odds And Gods_: Thor manages to get a flying engine to work again merely by _threatening_ to hit it with a hammer, which shows that even non-sentient machines know when to stop mucking about.
-   _Prince Roger_: Julio Poertena carries a big wrench which he uses to adjust the attitude of malfunctioning gear. The twist is that the "wrench trick" is actually better than the standard procedure for removing jammed powered armor.
-   _The Langoliers_: Captain Engle does this to the radio in the plane when he can't reach anyone else. Of course it doesn't work, given the circumstances, but it's the thought that counts.
-   _Ringworld_: Teela Brown activates her sky-cycle's emergency booster at a key moment by fainting and smashing her face on the control panel, thus saving her life. The emergency booster required several controls to be hit in a specific order, at least one of which was recessed and thus much harder to hit accidentally. The other characters take this as proof that she was literally Born Lucky (a plot point in the story).
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: _Ciaphas Cain_ **HERO OF THE IMPERIUM** has a "Litany of Percussive Maintenance" that he picked up from the techpriests. He quickly chants it as he taps his binoculars whenever the image is getting fuzzy.

-   _Planet Earth Is Blue_: On the day of the _Challenger_ launch, the TV set shows only static. The teacher hits the side, and the image comes into focus.

In trying to send all ten down at once, they get stuck in the drainpipe. The two tweakers begin making a scene, which means that Krazy 8 has come down personally to fix the problem. While he's up on a ladder trying to unjam the drainpipe, the police show up in response to the disturbance being caused by the tweakers, and everyone runs except Krazy 8, who is stuck on the ladder.
        
        **Officer 1:** Hey. Is this your vehicle?  
        **Krazy 8:** Uh, no sir.  
        **Officer 1:** Want to come down here?  
        **Krazy 8:** No problem, officer.  
        _\[Krazy 8 comes down the ladder\]_  
        **Officer 2:** Whatcha doing up there?  
        **Krazy 8:** Uh, just fixing a drainpipe. Some kind of block. _\[taps the pipe twice, and the drugs that were stuck in the drainpipe come piling out\]_  
        **Officer 2:** Guess you fixed it.  
        _\[Krazy 8 smiles nervously\]_
        
-   _Blake's 7_:
    -   Vila, generally noted for his lockpicking abilities, is trying to get out of a hatch that is stuck. He chooses this option instead in a fit of Hypocritical Humor. Justified because the hatch wasn't actually locked, just stiff from lack of use.
        
        **Avon:** _\[on vox\]_ Use your delicate, skillful touch.  
        _\[Vila kicks the hatch open instead\]_  
        **Vila:** I used my delicate, skillful boot.

-   Parodied on _Brass Eye_, where viewers were advised by unwitting celebrity guests to bang on electricity wires with large hammers to stop the north of Britain from being catapulted into Finland.

-   _Daredevil_: In "Rabbit in a Snowstorm," the office Wi-Fi at Nelson & Murdock is acting up, frustrating Matt and Foggy as they try to research case law. To fix it, Karen smacks the router a few times, which gets the connection working again.
-   _Doctor Who_: Used many times by the Doctor, often on the TARDIS controls. Some notable instances:
    -   "The Web of Fear": The Second Doctor has reprogrammed one of the Great Intelligence's spheres, but it doesn't respond until he whacks the bench it's on.
    -   "The Three Doctors": The Second Doctor fixes a radio by whacking it against the TARDIS console.
    -   "State of Decay":
        -   The Doctor thumps a malfunctioning scanner in the rebels' base, and it starts working properly again. "Aha! Earth technology!" he remarks.
        -   Later on, he does this again to a console in a disused scout rocket to get it working again.
    -   The Fifth Doctor is particularly known for this, including a scene in "The Five Doctors" in which he needs to smack the console with his fist to get the doors to open after he has _just overhauled the console_ and supposedly either fixed or upgraded everything that needed it.
    -   "The Visitation": Lampshaded when Adric and Nyssa are trying to fly the TARDIS on their own. After a few failed attempts at landing, Nyssa tells Adric to think what the Doctor would do. Adric thinks about it for a moment, pushes a few buttons, and thumps the console. It works.

    -   "Rise of the Cybermen": The Tenth Doctor attempts to kick the TARDIS back into working order. The exchange goes something like this:
        
        **Mickey:** Did that work?  
        **The Doctor:** _\[defensively\]_ Yes!  
        **Mickey:** Did it hurt?  
        **The Doctor:** _\[rubbing foot\]_ Yes...
        
    -   Of course, the TARDIS _is_ alive, so this might be a combination of Machine Empathy and Time Lord technology. Or the TARDIS is just kinky.
    -   "The Impossible Planet": The Ood do this in their first appearance. They approach the Doctor and Rose while menacingly repeating "We must feed...", then one of them irritatedly whacks his translator device and the output becomes: "We must feed... you, if you are hungry."
    -   "The Runaway Bride": The Doctor smacks a computer monitor at H.C. Clements to get it to turn on.

    -   "Empress of Mars": The Doctor attempts to send out a distress signal, and the screen starts going hazy. He whaps it alongside the monitor, and then casually leans on the console to pretend it was his intention for it to go as smoothly as intended.
-   The second-season premiere of _Dollhouse_ features a more futuristic version of this when Paul Ballard, trying to save Echo from capture by arms dealer Martin Klar, repeatedly punches the Active, hoping to coax out a personality that can defend itself. He eventually brings out the same fighter imprint that tried to ambush him in the previous season, and Echo manages to turn the tables on Martin and subdue him.
-   _Eureka_:
    -   The episode "Best in Faux", when Stark tells Carter the computer is malfunctioning:
        
        **Carter:** Smack it.  
        **Stark:** _Seriously?_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        
    -   Also the episode "Dr. Nobel". After managing to shut down the device that's been threatening global destruction, it seems to stop, then malfunctions and resumes the countdown. The scientist who built it spends a few seconds thinking, then kicks it. It stops... for a while, anyway.
-   In the first episode of _The Expanse_, Jim Holden and Naomi Nagata board an elevator on the _Canterbury_, and a panel on the wall starts beeping annoyingly. Naomi slams her fist against it and the noise stops, and the elevator starts working normally.
-   _Farscape_:
    -   One episode features a particularly dodgy ship that only really works when the engines are thumped with a stick.
    -   A variation of this occurs when Aeryn awakens Pilot (one of the many organic components of a Living Ship) from a coma by pumping him with adrenaline and kicking him. With both feet.
    -   If a Luxan is bleeding and the color is inky-black, the wound must be struck as hard as possible until the blood turns to a clear color. Yes, an entire species whose first aid procedure consists of Percussive Maintenance. It's _that_ kind of show.
-   Referenced on _Freaks and Geeks_: Mr. Rosso catches Daniel Desario trying to set off the school fire alarm in the hallway:
    
    **Rosso:** You think you're pretty cool, don't you, Daniel?  
    **Desario:** No, I don't think I'm cool.  
    **Rosso:** You don't think you're the Fonz or something? If a jukebox was broken, do you think you could hit it and it would start playing?
    
-   In the _Get Smart_ episode "Schwartz's Island", Siegfried does this to the secret technobabble machine by kicking it.
-   An episode of the Disney sitcom _Hannah Montana_ has one of the characters, Oliver, having the nickname "Locker Man" because he is gifted with the talent of being able to open a stuck locker with a series of blows.
-   The Fonz on _Happy Days_, using this trope to get the jukebox to play free songs and as a way to fix some cars. This is, of course, to show how The Fonz can channel Rule of Cool like magic. To the point where he knows how and where to strike the jukebox to play whatever song he wanted. Lampshaded in one episode where he hits the brick wall of a building to turn the exterior light off. Richie Cunningham is stunned near-speechless, to which the Fonz simply explains, "It's a gift."
-   _Hogan's Heroes_: "It's a German machine — all it understands is force!"
-   In a direct reference to the Fonz, Marshall from _How I Met Your Mother_ is shown to have done this, as one of the many ways he's "beaten the machine".
    
    _He triumphed over Pitfall, he vanquished the alarm, he brought the jukebox back to life with his Fonzarelli arm!_
    
-   Daisy and Onslow operate their TV this way on _Keeping Up Appearances_, even thumping it in certain spots to bring in the right channels.
-   _Lexx_'s indestructible assassin Kai finally suffers serious damage — which he calls being "out of alignment" — when he jumps down to a planet _from a spaceship in orbit._ The solution? Make _another_ jump and land on his _other_ side. It takes a couple of tries, but it works.
-   _Lost_:
    -   In the episode "Namaste", Miles uses Percussive Maintenance on the Dharma security monitors.
    -   And in a later episode, a character slaps around an atomic bomb in order to get it to explode. This is presented as a good thing.
-   In one episode of _MacGyver (1985)_, starting a car this way becomes a Running Gag.

-   _M\*A\*S\*H_:
    -   Trapper is writing a letter home in the Officer's Club, and the jukebox started to skip. He tries a Fonz-style repair, but all it does is jostle the needle off of the record altogether.
    -   Also attempted by Hawkeye on a jeep, as he said he once had a car that "only understood a swift kick in the radiator".
-   A Britcom called _The Big One_ had a running gag about a fridge that would only open if you punched it twice, kicked it once and yelled "Bastard!".
-   _A Moody Christmas_. In one episode when Dan's brother is fixing an aircon at a customer's house, a kid at the house tries to get a PlayStation control to work by hitting it.
-   _Mr. Bean_:
    -   He attempts to use Percussive Maintenance in "Mind The Baby, Mr. Bean" to cheat at one of those token pusher machines. It doesn't end well: As soon as he manages to get the machine to drop all the tokens, a kid comes along and nabs all the coins. Never mind that token pusher machines do not work that way.
    -   In another episode, Bean fixes a flickering neon sign by giving it a good whack. Then it gets brighter and brighter until it goes out.
-   _NCIS_:
    -   This is Gibbs' favorite method of fixing technology. Subverted in that he has broken a truly alarming number of computers and cell phones. Lampshaded when he gives his phone to Kate to fix and she merely drops it in the trash and replaces it with an identical phone from the stash she keeps in a desk drawer. This is also his favored method of fixing subordinates.
    -   Gibbs once gives a slap to Mr. Mass Spectrometer to stop it from growling. This time, it works. (Thankfully, he's doing this while Abby has her back turned.)
    -   Tony DiNozzo in a later episode is shown to use this method to score free candy from the machines in the break room.
    -   Ziva is seen doing this as well. Unlike Tony, she is actually applying this to a vending machine in a hospital where she has spent most of the episode. Upon seeing her do it, Tony remarks something along the lines of "you know you've been somewhere too long when you know how the machines work."
-   In _NewsRadio_, this was electrician/maintenance guy Joe's go-to method for fixing nearly anything, including in one noteworthy case a nuclear power system.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Subverted neatly in the first season when he's "fixing" Dave's malfunctioning laptop: giving it a whack, he kills it.
    
    **Dave:** Well, thanks, Fonzie. I think the screen did clear up for a moment right before it went blank.
    
-   In an episode of _Peter Gunn_, Lt. Jacoby puts a nickel in a candy machine but nothing comes out. He smacks it a few times to no avail. After he walks away, Peter casually hits the machine once, and a chocolate bar drops out.
-   In _Pixelface_, Romford's hard reset function involves picking him up and dropping him. Possibly a Shout-Out to the Apple Computers example described in the Real Life section.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Power Rangers Zeo_ has a visiting Cestro (the Blue Aquitar Ranger, The Smart Guy, basically the Alien Rangers' Expy of Billy and so often working alongside Billy. Like Billy, his solutions usually involve lots of techie-sounding made-up words) make something in the command center work by banging his fist on it, causing a shower of sparks to erupt. He says "there, it's fixed!" _It works._
    -   In one episode of _Power Rangers Operation Overdrive_, "It's Hammer Time", after Pink Ranger and Techno Wizard Rose fails by using her own methods, Yellow Ranger Ronny does this to fix the main computer. It works.
    -   _Power Rangers RPM_:
        -   In the second episode, Dillon and Ziggy notice a bunch of Grinders setting up a weapon to attack the Yellow Ranger's zord. Dillon tries to start his car, but can't because it's out of fuel. A hard whack on the steering wheel later and he gets it going again, running on the fumes.
        -   One-upped later on during the Road Attack Zord's debut. It's out of control, but Flynn says to hit it; he _designed_ the thing to shut down from a solid smack to the center.
    -   In _Power Rangers Samurai_, the method for clearing jams in the Lightzord's disk launcher system is to _smack the Lightzord in the butt_.
-   Bob Barker was fond of kicking and/or slapping stuck set pieces on _The Price Is Right_. The pricing game Squeeze Play was the most common victim.
-   This is how Al fixes Ziggy's handlink in _Quantum Leap_, so often it's practically a Character Tic. Although it sometimes does more bad than good. In the third-season episode "The Great Spontini", he actually manages to break the handlink, and is seen with a different model from that point forward.
-   The robot Kryten on _Red Dwarf_ was known to do this to _himself_ on occasion.
    -   He’s also mentioned to have done this to the bio-printer to get it working in “Officer Rimmer”.
-   One of Rory Bremner's satirical sketches had Donald Dewar, then the First Minister of Scotland, being interviewed over a video link by Jeremy Paxman. At one point, Dewar begins to stammer. Paxman thumps the television set, causing Dewar to duck as if he felt the blow.
-   On _Saved by the Bell_, AC Slater could use this to make lockers open.
-   _Scrubs_:
    -   Elliott's sorority sister hits a Jukebox and after it turns on, she says "Hey, I'm the Fonz!"
    -   There was also an Imagine Spot in which J.D. fantasized about being the Fonz, and performing Percussive Maintenance on _a patient in a coma_.
    -   The Todd claims that he saved a dying patient by giving him a high five. "The Miracle Five!" Dr. Cox replies, "Great story. It begins with a fundamental lack of understanding about the human body and ends with you shattering some old guy's hand."
-   In the _Small Wonder_ pilot episode, Jamie fixes a malfunctioning Vicki by slapping her, remarking that it's how Ted fixes the stereo. In the third-season episode "Bank Hostages", Vicki herself performs this on an errant ATM: "That's how my father fixes me."
-   In _The Sopranos_ episode "Commendatori", Paulie Walnuts deals with a recalcitrant DVD player with what his Army Signal Corps training referred to as a "brogan adjustment". It works about as well as you'd expect a Paulie Walnuts plan to work.
-   Referenced directly by name on _Space Cases_ — Thelma kicks the engine, which has been making odd noises, and it resumes its more usual hum.
    
    **Thelma:** Percussive maintenance. Works every time!
    
-   Lampshaded in _Stargate SG-1_. While trying to frantically repair the _Odyssey_ before the ship comes under fire, Vala rams a power crystal into one of the slots despite the fact that it's not supposed to fit there. Vala then remarks that it almost never works.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_
    -   In the pilot episode Chief O'Brien, trying to transport Odo back after a bit of sabotage on the Cardassian ship, is frustrated with his inability to make the transporter work because it's an unfamiliar system and the Cardassians intentionally trashed the station before they left. Fed up, he kicks the console out of sheer frustration — and Odo promptly materializes on the pad. The novelization of the episode takes it a little further — his foot actually _hit the control_ he was missing on the unfamiliar control panel.
    -   In "The Siege", Kira and Dax are trying to get working an abandoned spacecraft from the Occupation era that the Bajoran resistance cobbled together. After a while Dax gets exasperated trying to fix this heap of junk in the cramped space available and starts hitting things.
        
        **Kira:** Is the proximity system working?  
        **Dax:** _(smacks console, something whirrs)_ I think so.
        
    -   In "Little Green Men", Quark and his family crashland in Roswell in 1947, but their Universal Translators aren't working so they can't explain their situation. They try slapping their heads to get them working again. The assembled military and scientists decide to copy them in an attempt to communicate and proceed to Dope Slap themselves, much to Quark's amusement.
-   _Stranger Things_: Yuri employs this tactic to fix his plane.
-   The Animated Credits Opening of _Super Gran_ shows the villain Scunner Campbell bashing a malfunctioning piece of Applied Phlebotinum he'd stolen. This backfire badly on him and his gang since it suddenly fires a ray that turns an elderly woman into his Arch-Nemesis, Super Gran!
-   In one episode of _Taxi_, Louie demonstrates this twice when the other cabbies try to unlock a briefcase belonging to a big shot who rode in Bobby's cab. Louie first opens it with a punch only to close it shut right away so he can charge the cabbies for his service, and then opens it again _just by pointing at it._
-   _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_:
    -   A car bomb resets Cameron back to killer mode. After chasing John and Sarah across the city, she winds up slammed between two trucks and pleads with John not to deactivate her because she's "fixed now". Of course, it's slightly more complicated than that... (It should be noted that there's a high possibility that she was lying when she said that she was fixed.)
    -   In another episode, when John tries to buy some "Let's" brand chips from a vending machine, it gets stuck. Cameron hits the machine in just the right spot to make it dispense several products at once and give John his money back.
-   Jeremy Clarkson's general attitude to car maintenance on _Top Gear_. During the _Top Gear Ground Force_ special, May and Hammond assumed that Clarkson was going to use a hammer to get rid of weeds since that's what he normally uses for fixing everything. He didn't. He got a shotgun instead.
-   _Vera_: In "Home", Vera wins the trust of the young son of the Victim of the Week when the Vengeful Vending Machine at the hospital doesn't give him his chocolate, and she hits the machine in the right way to jar the chocolate loose.
-   Lampshaded in a first season episode of _Veronica Mars_:
    
    **Troy:** I'm kinda tired of this song. _\[smacks the jukebox, but nothing happens\]_ I would have expected sex, had that worked.  
    **Veronica:** Had that worked, you would've gotten it.
    
-   _Warehouse 13_:
    -   Claudia uses this method in one episode, and mentions it by name, in order to get the holographic display projector to work properly.
    -   Artie also resorts to this method whenever his computer decides not to cooperate.
    -   When the time machine breaks, this is the method they use to repair it.
        
        **H.G. Wells:** Back in the old days when things didn't work...
        

    Manhua 

-   _Old Master Q_ have the titular character's television fuzzing up, so he tries getting it to work by pounding its top. It doesn't work, so Master Q went to fetch a toolbox, returning with hammers, screwdrivers, and other more practical equipment... only for him to _continue banging the television using those tools_.

    Music 

-   During Steam Powered Giraffe's live shows, there's a segment where the robots all get knocked into "Japanese setting", requiring the Walter Workers to do a "hard reboot" on them. When they get to Rabbit, she starts dancing until one of the Walter Workers hits her in the head with a wrench. Then she's fine.

    Music Videos 

    Puppet Shows 

-   On an early episode of _Sesame Street_, a Dalek-like robot named S.A.M. (standing for Super Automatic Machine, of course) arrives on Sesame Street (he meant to go to Mulberry Street), asserting repeatedly that "machines never make mistakes; machines are perfect — are perfect — are perfect." The humans have to thump him hard to make him stop repeating the phrase, for which he thanks them.
-   This is used a number of times on _The Basil Brush Show_, usually without success.
-   In _Roland Rat: The Series_, Fergie the Ferret, the Ratcave's alleged handyman, is usually seen wielding a large mallet, which he whacks things with if he thinks they aren't working right. He's also a Violent Glaswegian who has a similar response if he thinks _people_ aren't working right.

    Radio 

-   _The Wacky Musical Adventures of Ronald McDonald: Intergalactical Magical Radio_: One of the kids suggests to Ronald that they can get the radio station working by hitting it as his father does with the television during the track "We'll Be Listening for the Signal". Ronald points out that such a technique isn't recommended on delicate equipment, but decides it can't hurt to try anyway.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Cyberspace_: One entry in the Equipment Mishandling Chart said "A sharp slap and the item begins to function normally again."
-   _D 20 System_: The "Guerilla Repair" ability allows the user to keep a malfunctioning weapon firing a few turns yet through anything from this trope to _verbally reprimanding_ it.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition_: The _Complete Scoundrel_ sourcebook includes the skill trick "Opening Tap". It gives a rogue a chance to open a lock without any tools, just by tapping it with a hard, blunt object.
-   _Fez V Wizards Betrayal_: Probably one of the first instances of this in a role-playing game. The "Final Engineer's Test" is performed during the introductory scene — in this adventure, it works somewhat like an exposition. Of course, this comes back later in the adventure — a newly built machine doesn't work until one of the players performs the "Final Engineer's Test" on it to get it running.
-   _GURPS_: In _GURPS 4e_ if cinematic rules are in effect and the GM allows, it is possible to do this at a big penalty if the kicker is sufficiently skilled.
-   _Iron Kingdoms_: The Bodger class has this as one of their main class features. At higher levels, they can even do this at range ("Toss a Hammer At It").
-   _Murphys World_: Brownies have an Excellent Sense for Things Mechanical. It allows them to get just about anything working with a well-applied kick or thump.
-   _Old World of Darkness_: In _Changeling: The Dreaming_, Nockers can fix machines by smacking and/or threatening them.
-   _Rifts_: This is an ability of some of the mystically-endowed-mechanic-type classes, like Techno Wizards and Operators, under the punny name "Guerrilla Repairs".
-   _Spycraft 2.0_: The Wheelman class gains the "Manual Adjustment" ability, letting them use this, depending on their level, to automatically succeed at most Mechanics, Electronics, and Security skill checks, should the initial skill roll fail.
-   _Starblazer Adventures_:
    -   The "Thump of Restoration" stunt (under Engineering) and an Engineering roll will cause any device that isn't working to start working again. However the device only works for a limited period of time: the better your roll, the longer it works.
    -   The "Just Hit It" stunt works exactly the same way, but specifically for starship engineering.
-   _Time Lord_, a _Doctor Who_ tie-in RPG released in the 1990s: It's possible to equip characters with this ability (called "Bench-Thumping" in the game).
-   _Fate_:
    -   There's a stunt called Thump of Restoration, which works by hitting an object which makes it work for X turns and gives further repairs a -1 modifier.
    -   Under _FATE_ rules, it is also entirely possible to create stunts that allow you to replace one skill check with another (subject to DM approval). Replacing Repair with Melée and invoking this trope would be perfectly permissible.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Adeptus Mechanicus, the Imperium's primary source of technology and maintenance thereof, is a machine cult that preserves ancient technical information chiefly in the form of religious doctrine, magical rituals, and superstition that it doesn't really understand. As a result, a great deal of Imperial maintenance rituals are derived from what would have originally been casual bouts of beating, fiddling with and swearing at machines, still done faithfully by rote because nobody remembers which parts worked or why.
        -   _Dark Heresy_ has it as a talent to unjam weapons. The Technical Knock is a swift prayer to the Omnissiah and a swift smack to the jammed weapon. It always works.
        -   The "Rite of Ignition" is an ancient tradition of Forge World labourers. This is "a form of prayer to the Machine Spirit that involves striking the object in question several times". This is seldom used in the presence of actual Tech-Priests.
        -   In _Storm of Iron_ it's implied that the "Chant of Awakening" consists of nothing more than swearing at the unresponsive device while pounding on the buttons.
        -   The rulebook appendices also note that a standard Mechanicus ritual for particularly old and revered machinery involves "a rhythmic striking with a special metal tool"
    -   Befitting the Orks' general blunt approach to life, their favored way of dealing with temperamental or underperforming machinery is to give it a few solid thumps with a fist or handy blunt object. Horrified Imperial Tech-Priests speculate that Ork Meks brutalize their machine spirits into submission.

    Theatre 

-   In _The Time of Your Life_, Nick tells Willie to fix the pinball machine when the flag is stuck by giving it a whack. This causes the flag to go up and down repeatedly before it rights itself.

    Video Games 

-   _Apocalypse_: Kincaid doesn't press buttons on control panels, he _kicks_ them. There's also a cutscene where he uses the butt of his machine gun to smash an electronic pad to forcefully open a door.
-   _Dawn of War_: While the Imperium uses its once advanced tech to build everything it needs, the Eldar use their very advanced (easily mistaken for magic) technology and Chaos uses actual magic to build everything, the Orks simply have their Gretchin hit a dropped-in pile of scrap with wooden mallets until it resembles an actual structure.
-   _Half-Life 2_: Due to an oversight, the player is never shown inserting new magazines into their SMG. They just slap the bottom of the gun and magically reload it.
-   _Zone of the Enders: Dolores, I_, the title character, a Humongous Mecha Robot Girl, applies this to herself when she inexplicably throws a jealous fit after James recovers a female enemy pilot.
-   _Judgment_: When Yagami poses as a maintenance worker, he gets asked to fix the building's air conditioner and in a moment of desperation, asks the guard watching to look behind as he gives it a kick to jumpstart it.
-   _Team Fortress 2_:
    -   The Engineer fixes and upgrades his machines by hitting them with his wrench. Just as good: If you hit an enemy or enemy machine with this wrench? Head trauma or a damaged building respectively.
    -   The game's "manual" \[PDF\] (as accessed online) is actually a manual on the Sentry, an automatic gun. The directions included for upgrading and setting up a sentry are all elaborate synonyms of "hit it with your wrench".
    -   Even better: In the game's predecessor, The Medic can heal teammates with his axe. This is carried onto the sequel with the Crusader's Crossbow for the Medic- shoot it at enemies, it hurts them. Shoot it at your teammates, and that bolt _lodged in their heads_ heals them.
    -   Similarly, the Engineer could heal teammates' armor by hitting them with his wrench.
    -   Made even better with the Gunslinger. A robotic hand added as an alternative to the wrench in the new engineer update, it lets you repair your buildings by _punching them_.
-   The _Battlefield_ series toys with this trope somewhat.
    -   The Engineer in each game in the series is usually equipped with some kind of tool or device that allows them to repair vehicles as long as said tool is in contact with said vehicle.
    -   _Battlefield: Bad Company_ has a _Drill._ Yes, you _**drill**_ health into tanks and jeeps. As long as you know the drill. (It's really more of a battery-powered socket drill, but that doesn't change the fact that you repair things by grinding them with the drill)
-   In _Far Cry 2_, you have weapons that constantly jam. Part of the unjamming process can include beating the crap out of your gun to unjam it. Such ways include whacking the side of your stove-piped shotgun, slamming the lid down of your LMG, or tapping (hardly) on the slide of your jammed pistol.
-   The PlayStation tie-in game for _Danger Girl_ has a cutscene where Sydney and JC (the team's Wrench Wench) are in a submarine, and facing a minor leakage. When JC's repeated attempts to fix the leak don't work, she then hits the leaking part with her wrench.
-   _Devil May Cry_:
    -   _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_ features Percussive Maintenance in its most basic form, with Dante punching a jukebox to get it to play (_"This party is gettin' crazy!"_).
    -   Also from _DMC3_'s fifth mission, when Dante used an ornate trident to trigger a switch. It didn't work. Guess what he did? He kicked the device, and it worked.
    -   Similarly, in _Devil May Cry 4_, Nero finds that the controls for lowering a drawbridge refuse to operate. He walks away in frustration... and then whirls around and _shoots_ the uncooperative console. It sparks and then explodes, after which the red light turns to green and the drawbridge lowers (It should probably be noted that he looked pretty surprised when this happened, suggesting that the shooting of the controls wasn't deliberate Percussive Maintenance so much as him venting the aforementioned frustration). Dante once gets into trouble hitting the jukebox; he hit it a little _too_ hard, as he punched it with enough force that the metal on the jukebox bent inwards from the impact, leaving his fist in a crater that he just made.
    -   _Devil May Cry 5_: In one of the ending cutscenes, Nico kicks her jukebox in order to make it work while Nero is busy fighting the demons on the road.
-   Inverted in _Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom_, during the cutscene where Pliers (ship's mechanic) has found a disc of unknown purpose in a captured Dragon (to the characters, that is — the players know it as a Flash-pak, a bomb capable of burning out an entire capital ship if it hits ANYWHERE on the hull). He doesn't know what it is, so he drops it on the deck, while everyone around him dives for cover — when it doesn't explode, he then picks it up, states that that's apparently not how it works, and resigns himself to some actual work.
-   An FMV cutscene during a mission of the second _Crusader_ game has Denning doing this, with the upgrade of the power outage apparently affecting the entire _base_.
-   In one scene in _Army of Two_, either Salem or Rios is trying to get into a room containing a circuit breaker needed to activate a monorail. When trying to flick the switch to open the breaker room, it doesn't work, even with a few hammer blows from the contractor's fist. It isn't until he _headbutts_ the switchbox that the door opens.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   In _Final Fantasy X_, Tidus hits a piece of ancient machinery repeatedly to get it working, even though his teammate is far more efficient with machinery. (As a Funny Background Event, you can see said teammate Face Palm.)
    -   In _Final Fantasy X-2_, the commsphere that Shinra threw into the Farplane Abyss malfunctions and won't connect. Leblanc whacks Shinra's control panel with her fan-weapon and suddenly it connects.
    -   Another example in _Final Fantasy VIII_. Zell does try to fix a machine the traditional way but eventually gives it a kick out of frustration. The machine works fine afterwards. Zell's example is somewhat of a subversion though, as while it will fix the machine and open the door to the dungeon, it also forces you to fight a series of tedious and difficult monster battles. While if you go about the slightly more tedious way of acquiring enough points to open the door normally, you can choose whether or not to fight the monsters.
    -   In the same game, Selphie shuts off the power to the missile base by slamming a control panel repeatedly. (This was the intended result)
    -   In _Final Fantasy VII_ there is a malfunctioning vending machine in the break room of the Shinra building. If you try to hit it, the lady present will stop you. But if you return here during the "Raid on Midgar" event much later in the game, the lady is gone and you can bash the machine for a strength source.
    -   In _Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon_, the barkeep turns his jukebox on by kicking it, then tells Chocobo that changing audio tracks is done the same way.
-   _Shadow the Hedgehog_:
    -   Shadow manages to not only bypass Eggman's security systems but to _bodily enter cyberspace_ by karate chopping a computer terminal.
    -   Charmy also does this later in the game to load up an old recording by Prof. Gerald that gets promptly broadcasted on any monitor on Earth. Interestingly, in both instances, Espio tried to conventionally hack into a database of some sort with little success.
-   _Call of Duty: Black Ops II_ has Section trying and failing to fix a CLAW drone. Frustrated, Harper kicks it, and it immediately starts mowing down every bad guy in sight. Apparently, in the futuristic world of 2025 filled with robots and cutting-edge computers, it's still a tried and true method of fixing things.
-   _Makai Kingdom_ gives us the Wrench weapon, which can repair vehicles with the Tech Bash skill.
-   In _Wild ARMs 2_, using Brad's kick ability on a malfunctioning computer terminal in the prison level makes it work again, giving you access to a room with a few bonus stat boosters.
-   In _Warhawk_, this trope is literally played straight: A few whacks from a wrench will repair vehicles and defenses.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_:
    -   In _Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal_, Big Bad robot Mad Scientist Dr. Nefarious has a habit of having screaming outbursts that make his circuitry overload causing him to freeze in place and broadcast a random soap opera. The problem is easily solved by someone (usually Lawrence) whacking Nefarious in the head (an act that Lawrence calls "the best part of (his) day"), after which Nefarious proceeds as if nothing had happened.
    -   Also makes a brief appearance in the first game, when Ratchet repairs a drill by whacking it with a fist.
-   In _Jak II: Renegade_, during the first Pump Station mission, Daxter attempts to steal Jak's glory by turning the pump's main valve. Sadly, the valve is not only too heavy for Daxter to even MOVE, it's completely STUCK! So Jak fixes the problem by hitting the pipe, which instantly unsticks the valve...and promptly sucks Daxter on a ride through the pipes!
-   In _RollerCoaster Tycoon_, mechanics fix broken-down shops by kicking them.
-   In _LEGO Indiana Jones_, one of the random animations when using a wrench to fix something is hitting it with the wrench.
-   _The Sims_:
    -   In _The Sims 3_ you can "upgrade" appliances by... hitting them with hammers. And let's not forget fixing broken appliances by poking them with a screwdriver. If only...
    -   This also happened in _The Sims_ social network app, where the Sim repaired anything that's broken by hitting them with a wrench.
-   _Metal Slug_:
    -   Happens near the end of _Metal Slug 3_, when the player has to escape from the alien mothership. The formerly kidnapped member pushes some keys on a console/computer and then gives it a kick, and only then the hatch opens to release them.
    -   In _Metal Slug 7_/_XX_ onwards, one of Tarma's unique abilities is the Slug Kick, i.e. kicking mechanical Slugs with a chance of restoring their health. Sometimes the Slug Kick averts this trope, however, damaging the vehicle instead.
    -   The first stage of _Metal Slug 7_/_XX_ has turrets operated by rebels early on, which they fire by kicking.
-   A futuristic stage in _Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage/Gateway to Glimmer_ has a maintenance droid suggest you do just that in order to get various broken-down mechanics working again.
    
    **Maintenance Droid:** I always say, there's no repair quite like hitting something.
    
-   You can play _Savage: The Battle for Newerth_ entirely with melee if you want to. It's probably done to keep things simple. Building, repairing structures, mining, and claiming spawn flags are all done with melee. The people at newerth.com at some point said they were thinking about adding different animations for the different actions depending on what you're aiming at but they never got around to adding it.
-   In the Super Nintendo beat-em-up game _The Peace Keepers_, in one level your hero finds that the bad guys have rigged the plane you're on to crash. The only way to prevent it from crashing is to _completely destroy all the control consoles_ so the autopilot kicks in.
-   In the Commodore 64 game _Super Pipeline_ and its sequel, your helpers fix leaky pipes by _hitting the pipes with their hammers_.
-   In the introductory cutscene for _Donkey Kong 64_, King K. Rool's shiny new gun is being readied by his idiot mook Kremlings. It starts to power down for no discernable reason, so one of the Kremlings gives it a nice head-butt, which causes it to power back up again.
-   In _Zork: The Undiscovered Underground_, the player's lantern has been through "several cycles of impact revitalisation", and needs to be given at least one more.
-   The iPhone app _Vending Machine Champ_.
-   In _Space Quest V: The Next Mutation_, the SCS _Eureka_'s Chief (and only) Engineer Cliffy (that's "Clifford" to you) fixes things by first actually tightening something, then whacking away at them with a wrench or kicking them. Given that the entire _Space Quest_ verse runs on the Rule of Funny, this makes total sense. (He's actually an incredibly competent engineer, rebuilding a destroyed droid and integrating an incompatible piece of tech into the SCS _Eureka_ without any problem)
-   _Fallout_:
    -   In the 3D games, a common jam animation involves the player character whacking the malfunctioning weapon. Actually a part of the drill for clearing a jam on many military rifles.
    -   In the Alien DLC, the jam animation on the alien laser rifle (while in first-person view) doesn't show the replacement of any cartridges or batteries. In short, it seems as if you reloaded the gun by just whacking it a few times.
    -   A quarry foreman in _Fallout: New Vegas_ also references this if you ask him about the machinery he uses.
        
        "It's Pre-War tech, so you need to thump it once in a while to keep it running."
        
    -   _Dead Money_ has a console that can activate some security turrets to help you deal with the Final Boss of the DLC, provided you can pass one of two skill check. One requires you to have sufficient Repair. The other needs you to simply bash it in and requires a high Unarmed skill.
    -   _Fallout 2_ gives you this option when you're trying to get the Vault 13 computer to work. "Kick the computer in that special way"
-   _Portal 2_: Wheatley seems to take this method of hacking. For example, he attempts a "manual override" on a wall, by slamming Chell's relaxation chamber into it. Later on, he "hacks" a door by slamming himself into the window to break it.
-   In _Batman: Arkham Asylum_, there's a part where Batman needs to use a control panel to turn on a ventilation system. Instead of approaching it and using it manually, he throws a batarang, effectively destroying the panel. The ventilation system turns on as if Batman had used the panel properly.
-   The scene mentioned above from _Martian Successor Nadesico_ also occurs in _Super Robot Wars Judgment_, only with even MORE Mad Scientists and Gadgeteer Geniuses standing around with no idea on how to deal with the malfunctioning Hyperspace Communicator before Ruri applies some Percussive Maintenance, stunning everyone when it actually WORKS...
-   _Mega Man Powered Up_: If the protagonist destroys Dr. Wily's combat machine on Normal or Hard, Wily rebuilds it — and _makes it fly_ — by hitting parts of the cockpit with a hammer several times.
-   _Assassin's Creed: Revelations_:
    -   Ezio solves a Clock Punk puzzle that has been underwater and presumably has some gunk in the gears. It grinds to a halt, and he kicks it to get it moving again.
    -   In one of Ezio's kill animations with the hidden blades, one of the blades fails to extend properly at first and he smacks its sheath against his victim's head a couple of times to get it to extend.
-   In the reboot of _Syndicate_, Agent Kilo's DART 6 chip is activated by a Mook punching him, this actually Makes Sense In Context as the opening sequence says it is fueled by adrenaline.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_ there are a couple of sections where Shepard needs to send one of his squadmates off to hack an important device. If you send James to do it, however, the game makes it clear he's not the techy type by having him _kick_ the thing. Repeatedly.
    -   Earlier in the series, in _Mass Effect 2_, Miranda gets pissed off at a slow elevator during her loyalty mission and hits it with her omni-tool, causing it to speed up and shut off the muzak.
-   During the Chop Shop level of _The Punisher_ video game, you can hear one thug struggling with a pop machine that won't give him his soda. Another guy tells him "Stop beating on it dumbass, it don't hardly work as it is!", leading to this hilarious burn, "You don't work either, but beating you gets results."
-   In _Crystal Story_, after Hiro is knocked out by Rita with a single slap, the following conversation takes place between the Mercenary Inc members:
    
    **Kaeli:** He's not waking up, is he?  
    **Reuben:** But...what about our gold?  
    **Tristam:** Maybe we can use some of our potions on him?  
    **Reuben:** Are you crazy? That's a waste!  
    **Phoebe:** MAYBE I CAN USE MY HAMMER ON HIM!  
    **Others:** NOOOOOOOO!!!
    
-   _Limbo of the Lost_ requires the player to open a pipe by whacking the valve... WITH THOR'S HAMMER.
-   The Rockmen in _FTL: Faster Than Light_ take this approach to repair, judging by their animation. They get no penalties for this. They're also immune to fire, so put out fires in your ship by stamping on them.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   Norma in _Tales of Legendia_ kicks the machine in order for the bridge to appear to each of the four monuments in chapter 6.
    -   Pascal in _Tales of Graces F_ fixes a broken Valkines Cryas by beating on it with a mallet. When questioned on it she confesses that she was "Kinda just wingin' it."
-   In _Garry's Mod_, the easiest way to fix a spazzing contraption (when the physics engine breaks and sends everything spinning around wildly out of control) is to pull out the Physgun, grab the contraption, and repeatedly smash it against the nearest wall until it stops spazzing. Unfortunately, delicate player-made mechanical objects (such as guns and engines) require much more finesse to fix - performing Percussive Maintenance on these will usually make the problem worse.
-   The _Alien vs. Predator_ video games often require you to operate electronic equipment and computers to proceed. If you are not playing as a human, this tends to mean simply smashing the object in question, which somehow always leads to the machines it controls doing precisely what you want.
-   _Ghost Rider_ has a cutscene where Johnny - in Ghost Rider form - tries activating a control panel to activate an exit. When the buttons don't work, Johnny straight-up _destroys_ the panel with a fiery punch. Surprisingly, it works, cue descending ladder.
-   Crewmen in _Guns of Icarus Online_ repair damage to their vessels by running around and hitting various pieces of machinery with a wrench. There's also a special hammer available in the loadout that won't actually repair broken things but will _buff_ their stats if you start hitting the fully-repaired machinery with it.
-   In _Metro 2033_, when you are exploring an old Soviet military base, you spend a couple of minutes flipping some switches to get an old elevator working. After that fails one of your comrades hit the control panel and starts the elevator.
    
    **Ulman:** Cool, just like in old Hollywood movies about the Soviet Union.
    
-   In _Bohemian Rhapsody in Red_, one of _Touhou_'s companion books, Yukari Yakumo is accused by local gossip rag editor Aya Shameimaru of animal abuse against her shikigami Ran when she's seen whacking her with her umbrella. Following a Running Gag in which _Touhou_ shikigami are equated with computers, Yukari clarifies that she sees Ran first and foremost as a tool, essentially saying she's following this trope.
-   This ability to do this was added with the skill tree rework in _PAYDAY 2_, with a perk that gives players a 50% chance to repair a drill with a melee attack, finally allowing the players' frustration to be put to good use.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
    -   In _Kingdom Hearts II_, Sora's ridiculous banging on the keyboard when he, Donald, and Goofy are searching for information on King Mickey and Riku on Ansem the Wise's Xehanort's computer is one of the causes<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>  that alerts the Master Control Program and gets the trio zapped inside.
    -   He doesn't learn from the MCP arresting him. In _Kingdom Hearts III_, after Randal hacks the controls to the factory in Monstropolis, Sora shows a lot of _glee_ in smashing a control panel at Goofy's suggestion if it means escaping from the Unversed. Sully stops him, and they instead opt to make Boo laugh to activate it.
-   In _Time: All Things Come to an End_ the player repairs an ancient machine by adopting a MacGyvering approach with a wire garotte and power cell. However, it still refuses to function and there are no obvious buttons or switches. A simple thump does the trick.
-   In the Taiwanese video game _Richman 8_, a News would randomly occur as the game processes, demonstrated by a Newslady and a television. Sometimes, the Newslady will hit the fuzzing television before its screen works properly, and announce the News afterwards.
-   _Theresia: Dear Emile_ has a rather extreme example during Dear Martel. The protagonist happens across a dark operating room with a lamp being the only potential source of light...except it won't work. Hitting the lamp with your hand only causes it to turn on for a brief second and your character to comment "Maybe if I hit it harder..." Cue _smashing a 2x4 across the lamp so hard that you snap the thing in half_, costing you the 2x4, which are pretty limited in this story, moreso than in Dear Emile. It gets the lamp working perfectly though!
-   _Bug Fables_:
    -   In the "Helpers Needed at Once!" sidequest, Malbee requests the party to fix several malfunctioning Mender bots by rebooting their systems. When Kabbu asks how to do that, Malbee answers that they need to whack them until their system is reset. Kabbu gets worried because he believes it will hurt their feelings, but both Leif and Malbee assure him they don't have any.
    -   In the Rubber Prison, when the team has to activate the computer in the security room, it doesn't work even when they activate the backup generator. Leif encourages Kabbu to kick it, which makes Kabbu worried since it's the valuable technology, but Leif insists Kabbu must kick it. Once he does, the computer starts working.
-   Hazel from _One Step From Eden_, smacks her structures with her giant wrench to buff their damage and shields.
-   _Trauma Team_: The paramedic Maria Torres, in the outro cutscene of the second First Response level, resuscitates a flatlining patient by hitting them out of frustration with the other paramedics. Forceful chest compression is also something she does occasionally in her operations.
-   _WarioWare: Get It Together!_: Deconstructed. Smacking game bugs in a game world seems like an awesome way to deal with them. However, the whole reason the game took place is because Wario tried doing this in the "real world" to fix bugs that were a result of his own sloppy programming. It unfortunately made things worse, as the game subsequently sucked everyone up once he got it 'working' again, and when everyone finds out, they're pissed, complete with 5-Volt-esque fury stances.
-   A scientist who's working on excavating a particular old abandoned experimental weapons station in _Stellaris_ can find that the whole place was put together in a slap-dash manner, and the old computers keep fritzing out to the point of audible frustration. They'll have the option of either proceeding carefully or kicking it — choosing the latter will add the "Percussive Maintainer" trait to them, giving them bonuses to researching computing-type techs and archeology speed at the cost of lowering their maximum overall skill cap.
-   At the climax of _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_, Colony 4's Ferronis encounters an issue during the assault on Origin, and, upon being told by the colony's engineers that it wouldn't start up, acting commander Bolearis elects to 'show it who's boss' by kicking its gigantic engine a few times. The engineers initially protest that it doesn't work that way, but, sure enough, it starts right up.
-   _Overwatch_ has Torbjorn, who repairs his sentry by hitting it with his Forge Hammer. Uniquely, a Torbjorn can only repair his own sentry with his own hammer—fellow Torbjorns can't help each other out.
-   _Deep Rock Galactic_ has a series of pre-made and comically nonsensical 'construction-ish' animations that play when you are performing any sort of repair or construction in the game. For sentries, satellite uplinks, fuel cells, mini-mules, and cargo crates, you build/activate these items with repeated whacks of a hammer. For other objective items such as pipelines or rock crackers, the series of random animations includes a few brisk whacks with a pipe wrench. There's almost certainly a Shout-Out to _Team Fortress 2_ and _Overwatch_ somewhere in there.
-   In _Mega Man Legends_, Megaman is stuck in an electrical trap and the Bonnes come over to free him. Tiesel looks over the trap and asks Tron how to stop it. She responds by giving the trap a swift kick, which works.
-   In _Densetsu no Stafy 4_, when Saimami tells Starly that the water filtration system of Tear Lake is broken, she recommends just giving it a good smack—in this case, a Star Spin—to fix it.

    Visual Novels 

-   One event in the first _Galaxy Angel_ has Tact facing a malfunctioning coffee machine, and he can ask any of the three Angels present for help with it. If he chooses Forte, she steps up and starts kicking the machine until it works. Another event also has Tact visiting Milfie in her room when she's trying out a popcorn machine, which she chops when it doesn't work and the thing ends up blasting the popcorn all over the room and leaves the two in a rather compromising position.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_
    -   Rena "fixes" a sulking Mion the same way, saying it's how she fixes her TV.
    -   A more serious example occurs at the end of Meakashi-hen. Whereas Shion seems to gain some grip on everything that had happened as she fell, in the game, she hit a roof and landed there, and that was what allowed her to overcome her insanity... and then she decided to roll off that roof too.
    -   Another serious example is in Tsumihoroboshi-hen, when Rena takes the class hostage and started "fixing" Mion... while holding her cleaver blade facing the other way.
    -   A semi-serious example of either this or Dope Slap occurs in the manga version of Tatarigoroshi-hen, where Mion smacks Rena in the back of the head to get her out of one of her dark moods and/or get her to shut up about Oyashiro-sama's curse.
-   In _Tokimeki Memorial 2 Substories: Leaping School Festival_, Homura tries to do this on her malfunctioning TV, first with punches, then with a Dragon Kick. All she gets from this is a completely broken and unusable TV. "Finishing blow!" ("Todome da!") indeed.

It works. But only because Lopez Dos.0 fixed it offscreen.
-   In Volume 4 of _RWBY_, "Kuroyuri", The farmer boy, Oscar, tries to buy a train ticket to go to Mistral, but can't due to an insufficient amount of Lien. Hazel, who happens to be there at the time, helps him by pounding the top of the machine hard enough to dent the metal, resulting in it spitting one ticket out. He then tells Oscar not to let small obstacles get in his way. Ozpin states that Hazel is someone from his past, and tells Oscar that Hazel is not someone to take lightly.
-   In _Super-Villain-Bowl!_, Kylo Ren taps his lightsaber when only the two lateral prongs flare up.

    Webcomics 

-   How do you get Dominic Deegan out of a trance? While it didn't work, Dominic's mother's trick was worth a try. The next attempt will probably work better.

-   _Schlock Mercenary_ has Tagon asking a medical computer whether it _couldn't_ do illegal biomodifications or _wouldn't_. The computer asked the difference, and Tagon explained that hardware that _can't_ do something gets replaced. Hardware that _won't_ do something gets abused until it will, or until it can't. It then agrees to perform illegal biomodifications.
-   A regular enough practice in _Girl Genius_. Very few "Sparks" are subtle, especially when they're in a hurry.
-   Rogue in _Exterminatus Now_ knows how to fix his Laser Blade in the field.

    -   When Sydney gets cramps, she threatens her ovaries and then punches them at full force, resulting in her doing a forward flip straight onto her face.
        
        **Sydney:** ...hopefully that's the stupidest thing I do today.
        
-   In _Freefall_, those who try this are considered "one of those people" by robots.
-   _Karin-dou 4koma_: Kinka explains this trope after Tamaryu sees her halfheartedly slapping a fan that had just stopped working. Tamaryu's attempt to assist splits the fan in half.
-   _Darths & Droids_ naturally includes a reference to Han's repair technique, including calling it "percussive maintenance" in The Rant. The inanity of the technique is lampshaded by the GM giving Jim a Mechanic check at -12; Jim rolling a 20 is the only reason it works.
-   Guenevere does this to an alien device (the **frame** after Arthur says "we'd better tread softly, people") in the space arc of _Arthur, King of Time and Space_.
-   In this _El Goonish Shive_ filler strip, Dan uses this to fix his computer. Earlier, Noah used some to fix his own name box.
-   _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_: "Punch" explains that the modern day is so stressful because modern technology isn't fit to be punched any more so you can't take out your anger on it when it doesn't work.
-   In the _Skin Horse_ storyline "Unsinkable" we're introduced to Cinderblock, The Big Guy of the superhero team AG-I, who is also responsible for calibrating their supercomputer. Nera thinks this combination of brains and brawn makes Cinderblock like She-Hulk. When they see _how_ Cinderblock "calibrates" the computer, Jonah amends this to "just regular Hulk".
-   In _Tower of God_ episode 56, Hwaryun gets a vending machine to work by hitting it with the side of her palm. Khun is implied to try the same thing but only hurts his hand. Weirdly enough, it's Justified, even Foreshadowing, since she's later revealed to be a Navigator with the ability to see what path will lead to the desired result.
-   _Welcome to Doomtlis_: After the green TV shuts off, Tsuyo tries to do this... Using a baseball bat. Predictably, it ends up destroying the television.
-   _The Legend of Genji_: When Genji's little sister begs him to fix the broken TV in their apartment, he just bangs the TV with his fist and it immediately starts working again.

    Western Animation 

-   Averted on _Beavis and Butt-Head_ when the title duo try to get their TV working again with numerous kicks. Pieces fly off, but that's all that happens. Due in part to a citywide power outage and in part due to the permanent power outage in their brains, they don't notice.
-   In one episode of _The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show_, Snoopy imitates the Cheshire Cat and makes himself invisible. Unfortunately, he eventually overdoes it and can't get visible again. Lucy got him back by applying this technique, saying it's just like when the image of a television goes out.

-   _The Flintstones_: Fred Flintstone is a master TV repairman, provided he has his club.
-   The Fonz himself is featured in _The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang_, employing his trademarked fix in order to, among other things, repair a time-traveling flying saucer, vehicle of choice of the gang in the cartoon. In several chapters, the Percussive Maintenance (usually in the form of a finger snap) is even seen stopping and reversing inertial momentum (!).
-   _Futurama_:
    -   Subversion: the TV signal goes out because of interference from Bender. Fry hits the TV just as Bender leaves the room, and does Fonz's thumbs-up "Hey!" when the signal returns.
    -   Played for laughs in _Bender's Game_ where the Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots uses hammer therapy on its patients.
    -   In the episode "Bender Should Not be Allowed on TV", Antonio Calculon Junior breaks down. Someone comes by and hits him on the head a couple of times. It doesn't work.
    -   This has been known to work on Bender himself. In "Murder On the Planet Express," his gyroscope fully melts and he's unable to maintain his balance, causing him to comment, "I guess I'll be dizzy and uncoordinated for the rest of my—" before Amy smacks him in the head with a golf club, restabilizing him.
-   Filmation's 1960's _Green Lantern_ cartoon. In the episode "Evil Is as Evil Does", the title character's power battery has stopped working.

The other says it probably won't work (and that the lightning was only in the movie), while the first one says he's mostly just doing it to feel better. It works anyway.
-   On _Jimmy Two-Shoes_, this is how Heloise fixes her Brainiac Booster.

    **Hank:** Don't even try to take credit for that.  
    **Dale:** It was not done by me, it was done through me.
    
-   In _Lavender Castle_, Isambard often applies this to the Paradox's engine whenever they need a bit more speed. This backfires at one point when after a short burst, the engine explodes leaving them sitting ducks.
-   In _My Little Pony Rainbow Road Trip_, Petunia Petals has to buck the wall of the shoddy hotel room a few times to get a fold-up bed to lower. It doesn't stay 'fixed' for long; Applejack becomes the victim of Murphy's Bed soon after.
-   _Muppet Babies (1984)_: The kids are in an old roofless police car on railroad tracks with two trains coming.
    
    **Piggy:** Kermit, step on it!

    **Piggy:** You're welcome. _Now get us outta here!_
    
-   _The Octonauts_: In "The Great Swamp Search", Ranger Marsh tries this on a malfunctioning radio. It doesn't work, but Captain Barnacles is able to get it to work with a more delicate touch.
-   _The Penguins of Madagascar_: Skipper tries to smack a malfunctioning flashlight. It works... for all of about three seconds, and then fizzles out again.
-   _Peter Rabbit_: In "Flooded Burrow", Peter and his friends use a vacuum-like device to get the water out of the flooded burrow. Later, when the owl Old Brown threatens to attack, Peter decides to try to reverse it in order to spray him but isn't sure how. Benjamin suggests giving it a kick and does so. He ends up suffering Agony of the Feet for it, but it also works, albeit with a bit of a delay.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: Lampshaded in "Hide and Seek" when Dr. Doof tries to get his Incredibly Obvious Bug working by after repeatedly hitting his monitor.
    
    **Dr. Doof:** Oh hey, random pounding works.
    
-   _Pucca_: In one episode, Abyo tries to do this with a kick, searching to repair a problem with the time clock of the Master Soo's temple, which because the dragon was sleeping (it was the main mechanism of the clock), it was causing a day loop, which only Garu could detect, but he couldn't repair the problem. Their two attempts caused that the time was going to forward and back respectively. Then, the Master Soo came and with a punch, he can solve the problem with the clock... or well, until that Pucca came later, but that's another story.
-   _Die Sendung mit der Maus_: In one cartoon, the mouse wants to take a photo of herself. All the photo machine produces are elephants. This trope doesn't help a bit. Why is revealed when the mouse opens the maintenance lid: the machine is a fake and the little blue elephant inside does the pics with crayons.
-   _Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century_: In "The Crime Machine", Holmes gets an old subway train working by kicking the control panel.

-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: In "Pizza Delivery", Spongebob panics and floors a car down the highway until it runs out of gas. Stranded in the middle of nowhere, Squidward gets out of the car and kicks the bumper, causing the driverless car to refill itself and then speed away in reverse, presumably back to the Krusty Krab.
-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_: In "Terminal Provocations", when Badgey freezes while loading a cargo recovery training simulation, Rutherford gives him a kick to get him working again. It works but drives Badgey to murder as soon as the safeties fail.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_:
    -   In "Trespass", a large group led by Obi-Wan and Anakin is investigating a droid base, the inhabitants of which have all been decapitated... not far from a Republic base where the same thing had happened. Obi-Wan attempts to use a computer to find answers and has no success. Anakin gives it a good punch, and the hologram comes up.
    -   Also played with in "Wookiee Hunt", where a Jedi Youngling finds his Jedi Mind Trick works much better on a captured Trandoshan after Chewbacca punches him<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in the head.
-   _Steven Universe_: In "Kindergarten Kid", Peridot kicks a malfunctioning cannon, yelling at it to work. For reference, Peridot is a tech genius who comes from an alien species that makes humans look like cavemen in comparison... and this trope is _still_ her first resort.
-   _TaleSpin_: This is Wildcat's _Modus Operandi_. Just about every problem he faces he fixes with a hit from a mallet. Lampshaded in one episode where Baloo is trying to repair the Sea Duck's engine after flying through a sand storm, and says, "What would Wildcat do?" He hits the engine with a mallet and it promptly dumps a pile of sand.
-   _Thomas & Friends_:
    -   In "Whistles and Sneezes", Gordon's crew fix his jammed-open whistle by knocking it into place with a hammer.
    -   In "Toad's Bright Idea", Gator's lamp often fizzled out, and in order to get it working again, his driver had to knock it. Eventually, it stopped working altogether, and Toad let Gator borrow one of his lamps.
-   _Thundercats 1985_ has an episode where Wilykit and Wilykat get into one of the Thundercats' old suspension capsules to take shelter from a storm, only for the lid to get stuck, leaving them trapped. They're still in there at the end of the episode, but the other Thundercats can't think of a way of opening the capsule without harming them. However, Snarf then gives the capsule "a good kick" which causes the capsule to spring open, freeing the Thunderkittens.
-   _The Transformers_
    -   "Cosmic Rust". After trying to get the matter duplicator to work to replicate more Corrorstop to cure the Autobots of said disease, it's the normally patient and mild-mannered **Perceptor** who resorts to this.
    -   "Desertion of the Dinobots" has both Autobots and Decepticons malfunctioning due to the degradation of a critical element in their systems, Cybertronium. This can result in things like the loss of flight capability, being stuck in one mode or another, or even being stuck partially transformed. At one point, Jazz is stuck in his vehicle mode, unable to transform. Ironhide's solution is a none-too-gentle kick that finally gets Jazz into robot mode.
-   In the _TUGS_ episode "Bigg Freeze", when Ten Cents and Sunshine bring in the pre-fueled emergency light barge to help guide the S.S. Vienna liner into Bigg City Port, they can't figure out how to turn it on. Warrior turns it on by bumping into it.
-   In _Turtles Forever_, Donatello initially ridicules his interdimensional counterpart when he tries to apply this philosophy to their transdimensional portal stick. Guess what Donny eventually has to do to eventually save their shells.
-   _VeggieTales_: In "The Ultimate Silly Song Countdown", the machine used to tally the votes occasionally breaks down, and Pa Grape uses a wooden mallet to fix it. At one point, he has to hammer it so much that Mr. Lunt and Larry have to improvise a song in the meantime, and they use his "percussion" (and a Chinese takeout menu) as inspiration.
-   In _Wacky Races_, the Slag brothers often do this to their stone-age car. Once though, the car hits back. The other racers also do this from time to time; Peter Perfect once fixed his car that had completely fallen apart with one swift kick.
-   Tish in _The Weekenders_ bangs the top of a television while trying to hook it up after several failed attempts to fix it properly. It starts working, causing her to remark "Why does banging the television always work?" Carver claims that it's a matter of showing the TV who's boss.

    Real Life 

-   Don't lie, you've tried this.
-   Smacking a failing flashlight against your palm can get it to full power again for a short time.
-   During the Apollo 16 mission, an alarm light kept malfunctioning until Commander John Young tried kicking it. When he reported success, the response from Earth was "It's an old American custom: kick it if it doesn't work."
-   Apollo 12:
    -   Alan Bean was instructed to try and fix the camera by tapping it with his hammer. He radioed, "I hit it on the top with my hammer. I figured we didn't have a thing to lose. I just pounded it on the top with this hammer that I've got." The capsule communicator in Houston joked, "Skillful fix, Al." Bean agreed, "Yes, that's skilled craftsmanship."
    -   Alan Bean had the job of removing the plutonium source from the cask and inserting it into the generator but after he pulled it partway out, it stuck and refused to budge any farther. After a few minutes of fiddling with the long-handled removal tool, Bean got frustrated and suggested that they give the cask a couple of good whacks with the hammer. Conrad wasn't quite ready to be so unsubtle and wanted to try using the hammer as a prying tool. But, when that didn't work either, he, too, gave in to the inevitable and gave the cask a good, sharp rap. The fuel element slid out a fraction of an inch. He hit it again and harder. And again. And that did it.
    -   Alan Bean still has that hammer to this day, and uses it to add textures to his paintings.
-   Apollo 14: While running through the pre-PDI checklist, Al Shepard and Ed Mitchell noticed that the abort light had come on, indicating that the computer had gone straight into abort mode. If this happened during the actual burn the computer would abort the descent and that would be mission over as there'd no longer be enough fuel for another attempt at landing. They got the light to go out by tapping on the console with a pen. Of course this was only a temporary fix, and a more elegant solution required some in-flight reprogramming of the guidance computer (by tricking it into thinking it was already in abort mode, so it would not monitor the status of the abort button). The moment is recreated in the Apollo 14 episode of _From the Earth to the Moon_.
-   The first Skylab mission (the one that had to fix all the major malfunctions that were mostly the result of one solar wing trying to deploy _during the damn launch_) had a problem with the small solar array hardware having accumulated static. They fixed it by thumping it during a spacewalk. (This works on certain classes of electronics prone to malfunction due to static electricity build-up. A suitable thump will help disperse it.)
-   The SR-71 Blackbird flew so high and fast that the airframe would stretch by several feet during flight. Because of this, the plane was designed with skin panels that, on the ground, overlapped and had gaps between them (meaning that the plane leaked profusely) and would slide into place and tightly lock together when the plane was at cruising length. After landing, ground crews would have to use blow torches and mallets to physically pound the airframe to make sure that the skin panels would go back to their pre-takeoff configuration.
-   World War I fighter pilots often kept a small hammer in their cockpits in the event that their machine guns jammed.
-   _999_ had a real-life story where a couple were trapped in a car with its engine on fire but found the electric locks wouldn't open. The husband in desperation started belting the steering column with his hands multiple times until the locks suddenly opened on their own.
-   Familiar enough among musicians to become a joke. "Percussive Maintenance: Having to hit something with a hammer a few times to get it to work properly."
-   While this is _not_ advisable unless you have no other choice (e.g. you don't have a backup for some reason or other, your laptop is out of warranty and you don't have money for the fan repair immediately, you're on tour or assignment and can't get to a repair shop/can't do without your only laptop for a week) this does work occasionally to restart a stuck fan on a Macbook Pro (at least the 2010 version). First try to loosen dust/dirt with compressed air if possible, then, find the location of the stuck fan (your fan control software should tell you which side is running slow/not running). With the laptop turned off, smack the case under the fan with the palm or heel of your hand once or twice, then boot, turning the fans to max speed. If this has worked, it will blast out a cloud of dust and dirt and run at normal (or at least some of normal) speed again, usually long enough for you to safely back up, get the money you need, or finish your assignment/touring/work...
-   In the mid- to late '90s this was a standard procedure if a hard disk refused to spin up. The disks' lubrication had a habit of getting out of kilter, and "lift the computer three, four inches and let it drop again while turned off" usually relubricated the axle.
-   If you call up the Nintendo Tech Support line with a Wii Remote problem, and they diagnose it as a stuck accelerometer, the fix they give over the phone is to, quote, "Hold the Wii remote buttons-side down, and whack it into your palm loud enough so I can hear it over the phone." It works.
-   A 1980s guide to console gaming:
    
    1.  Insert cartridge.
    2.  Turn on console.
    3.  Turn off console.
    4.  Remove cartridge.
    5.  Blow on cartridge.
    6.  Blow in console slot.
    7.  ????
    8.  Profit!
    
    -   It should be noted that Step 7 isn't just there for the meme. (Step 8, however, is.) If you get to this point and it doesn't work, keep doing random things such as jiggling the cartridge in the slot or cramming folded pieces of paper between the cartridge and the walls of the slot until it works.
        -   Best way to deal with step 7 is: "START WORKING YOU PIECE OF MOTHERFUCKING SHIT OR I SHOVE AN AXE INTO YOU AND BURN YOU ON A CROSS!!!!" Usually works. At least when you stand up to pick the said axe.
    -   Also, only the console's owner can blow on the cartridge and/or console slot. Anyone else attempting to do so will invariably fail to correct the problem. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Also, for the original "VCR style" NES, banging the top or dropping it works because the connector that the cartridge plugs into might have come loose from the board. Whacking it helps seat the contacts.
-   This is, believe it or not, one of the many ways to (temporarily) cure the Red Rings of Death on Xbox 360s. (Another one is baking, mentioned later on this page for GPUs — because the fault **is** in fact an unsoldered GPU.)
    -   This will only work temporarily at best, until the excessive heat inside the console warps the motherboard so badly that pin contact can no longer be maintained.
    -   Smacking the console immediately after loading a disc is the easiest solution to the common "Open tray" error...assuming it's caused by the laser track getting stuck rather than the laser itself dying.
-   After a few years of use, the original Xbox's DVD drive may stop opening. The correct procedure for this is a good, solid thump right above the drive.
    -   There are a few Xbox 360's that do the exact same thing.
-   Continuing with the Xbox, a lot of Xbox Ones shipped with faulty Blu-Ray drives, due to one of the gears being loose. The solution? Unplug the console, turn it upside-down and give it a good whack.
-   Back when Apple was not only called Apple Computer but they made computers besides Macintoshes, their big, expensive (and most importantly, fanless and made of solid aluminum) Apple III models had an issue where the computer would run so hot, its chips would _unsolder themselves_. The official tech support solution was "raise the CPU three to four inches off the desk and release it," which usually re-seated the components.
    -   Cards/components in early Macintoshes of all types would creep out of their sockets from thermal expansion/contraction cycles due to high operating temperature. Mostly affected units turned off/on daily. The solution was to pick up the case and drop it. Sometimes just carrying the unit would reseat the cards. Tech support's solution? "Just bring it in." They'd let it sit untouched for a day, then have the user come pick it up. The joggling from the transport fixed the problem. Easier than explaining.
    -   Early PCs as well. And even modern-day PCs with cases manufactured under questionable quality control will have this problem. The author of "Building and Maintaining Your PC" called this issue "card creep", although his advice was a more sensible albeit time-consuming "open the PC up and push every single card and RAM bar down". Yeah, applying percussive force from the top fixes things too in many cases.
    -   When Commodore was producing Amiga 500s in its West Chester, PA facility, the engineers and other employees became fond of drag racing on the parking lot. Subtler means having failed to dissuade this practise, the company had speed bumps of ever-increasing size installed. The bumps got to the point of shaking the shipping trucks so much that the socketed main chips would loosen in the motherboards, causing sporadic failure. It got to the point where dealers were instructed to take their freshly delivered machines and drop them several feet to reseat the chips.
    -   Atari ST enthusiasts are familiar with something similar, called the Universal 4-Inch Drop. And for pretty much the same reason as the above Apple IIIs.
    -   The unofficial solution for problems with some early iPods with sticky hard drives is to whack it against a table.
    -   If your iPhone is having trouble with a replaced touch screen detecting input properly, it's normally because the new screen is not fully seated into its connectors. Giving it a good thump against your hand should work if you don't have a screwdriver handy.
    -   Averted: This is one of the reasons why PCI-E slots (commonly used for Graphics Cards) are often outfitted with a plastic hook that will click into a small slit (or 'key') in the card. The card cannot be moved in the slot unless the hook is pulled back first.
-   While not a computer with the same mindset as your early PC, the Australian Fairlight CMI (Computer Musical Instrument) sometimes required a great deal of "impact maintenance" when instrument ROMs were inserted via floppy disk so the buggers wouldn't jam. Despite these limitations, their use has been lauded and seen by many top-tier artists of The '80s and even early Nineties, from producers Trevor Horn and Brian Eno, to musicians Mike Oldfield, Peter Gabriel, Jan Hammer and Stevie Wonder. That, and only ~300 units were made at a starting price of $25,000.
-   Sun Microsystems had a period of time where a lot of tech support calls went like this:
    
    **Customer:** My system won't boot.  
    **Support:** <<verifies model and so forth>> OK, take the hard drive out, hold it <this way>, and slam it against the desk. No, harder. No, harder. No, _harder_. OK, put it back in. <<system boots>> Yeah, we got a run of bad hard drives that stick, and slamming them on the desk like that will temporarily unstick them. I'm sending you a replacement unit.
    
-   Banging the top with a closed fist sometimes does wonders with old CRT screens that have a recurring "picture suddenly compresses into a single horizontal line" issue. This is also the officially recommended way of dealing with aperture grille displays when their thin vertical wires stick together.
    -   The Mini Showa Retro Consumer Electronics Toys from Japan offer a simulated version of this on their miniature smartphone-run TV. Occasionally the horizontal hold would go haywire, and the fix is to slap it.
-   In the Church of the SubGenius, the laying of hands on malfunctioning equipment, done swiftly and sharply, is called "Appliance Healing".
-   Any British geek of late '70s/early '80s vintage worth his or her salt can tell you what a balky piece of equipment the typical Sinclair computer was. The fact that the most common storage device was a common or garden domestic tape recorder didn't help matters in the least. The tinkering that ZX-80/ZX-81/Spectrum owners would engage in with azimuth adjustment screws, volume and tone knobs, cabling position, tape recorder position, computer position, and a dozen other things became almost ritualistic. But when all that failed, just whacking the tape recorder, or the computer, or the power supply brick would actually work on a disturbingly regular basis. Some still remember having to keep their feet on the power brick otherwise the dreaded R: Tape Loading Error message would pop up.
    -   Inverted by the behaviour of the 16Kb RAM pack which attached onto the back of the ZX-81, any slight movement of which relative to the computer could cause an instant system crash and loss of all data, slightest movements caused by, for instance, _using the keyboard at all_. Users jammed blu-tack, plasticine, modelling clay, cardboard, and many other substances into the gap, mounted the computer and RAM pack in improvised vices, and took many other precautions to avoid the nightmare scenario.
-   Carowinds, a theme park on the North Carolina/South Carolina border, has a roller coaster called the Carolina Cyclone with a few restraint bars that have a habit of getting stuck. The correct method of unsticking them, as ride attendants are _instructed during training,_ is to kick them.
-   One of the first things to try when clearing a weapon jam is to simply smack the magazine, which it is also recommended you do before loading the magazine in the first place (it helps the cartridges to seat correctly and reduces the chance of a misfeed). A few good mag taps on your hand, your helmet, or a nearby rock before loading will do wonders for a weapon.
-   A technique used in emergency medicine is the precordial thump, which involves laying a carefully aimed blow to the chest at just the right time to convert a witnessed cardiac arrest. (Contraindications include "presence of a pulse", as the reverse—commotio cordis—will happen and a cardiac arrest will be induced should you hit the chest at the exact wrong time.)
-   CPR is another example, effectively meaning "compress heart repeatedly (with good rhythm) and forcefully (it frequently breaks ribs) to make it go". Similarly if someone is choking the procedure is "encourage to cough" > bash them in the back (back-slaps) > bash them in the front (chest-thrust, a.k.a. the Heimlich manoeuvre), which can also do some damage, but better than suffocating.
-   Engineer's Creed: "If it moves, and it shouldn't move, use duct tape. If it doesn't move, and it should move, use a hammer." Add a can of WD-40, a pocket knife, and a six-pack, and you have the Redneck (or Red Green) Tool Kit.
-   This is an actual maintenance procedure in U.S. Navy engineering manuals, under the name, "Mechanical agitation".
-   The Technical Manuals for old military analog man-portable radios (such as the PRC-25/PRC-77) suggest a drop of one to three feet onto a solid surface as part of operator-level maintenance.
-   Slot machines typically have several different doors leading to various parts of their innards. Sensors are connected to the doors and generate a tilt whenever they register as being open. Unfortunately, sometimes the machine will be manhandled to the point where closed doors will still show to the machine as being open. An experienced slot attendant often knows how to diagnose which door is the problem and clear the error with one well-placed smack, without going through the trouble of actually opening the door and adjusting the sensor (which often involves filling out logs and other red tape).
-   Recorded Books Incorporated used to put on their cassette tapes that if you ever ran into any problems with tape, you should "place it in the palm of your hand and slap it smartly against a hard, flat surface." If that didn't work, and you could not "otherwise free the reels," then you could send it in for a free replacement.
-   Modern vending machines: A good few hits with one's shoulder or rocking it back and forth (Don't Try This at Home!) is usually sufficient to dislodge something. The downside is that ramming one's shoulder into a piece of hard plastic can be quite painful, and rocking it runs the very real danger of tipping it over, leading to severe injury and/or death.
    -   Capsule vending Machines like this<small>◊</small> can usually be fixed by tapping between the lock and the turning knob. Over long periods of use, the path coins travel to engage the gears gets worn down. Tapping/punching said area can shift the coins over small imperfections in the path. Experienced users can usually tell how far the coin has traveled just by sound. Tapping/jiggling the entire machine sometimes works if the capsules are on the larger side (greater tendency to get stuck). They're designed to prevent free-play by tipping though, as there's a large spring that blocks the exit port unless you turn it the proper way.
    -   Coin-op arcade machines can have tokens get stuck in the intake chute. Normally, there is a lever or button to make the coin fall into the coin return, but on worn-out machines or particularly bad token jams, a few hammerfists to the coin-intake mechanism might be just the thing to knock any stuck coins loose.
-   London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway locomotives had a special hammer for this purpose as part of their standard toolkit. The business end was made of lead, to reduce the risk that it would damage the paintwork.
-   Renowned Soviet T-34 tank had a very poor transmission/steering design, unfaithfully copying an American project of the late 1930s which hadn't get put into production exactly because it didn't work. The massive iron levers that actuated the steering and gearshift would often get stuck, even worse in freezing temperatures which are typical to Russia, and they had to be moved with a hammer. There were hammers issued to tank drivers just for this purpose.
-   Another Soviet standard, the AK-47 and its clones and offspring are infamous for their simplicity and reliability. On the off chance anything _does_ go wrong with one, though, there's more than a few incidences where the solution was "hit rifle with hammer." Debris causing stoppage? Hit the receiver with a hammer til the debris falls out. Firing pin eating chunks of the primers? Hit the firing pin with a hammer until it stops doing that. Handguard catch fire because you overheated it? Hit the furniture with a hammer until it's extinguished or the furniture falls off, whichever causes your rifle to stop being on fire first. Bolt is stuck due to a stovepiped or disintegrated brass? Pry the (remains of) brass off with pliers and hit the charging handle with a hammer until it moves again. Because of its simplicity —"an elegantly simple nine-pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood," as it was famously put in _Lord of War_— the AK can take this abuse in stride and keep working right through the fix.
-   The M-16 was no slouch, either, and bashing the hell out of it was not only considered valid, but included _in the manual._ Specifically, if the action jams due to fouling or case telescoping to the point where pulling the charging handle doesn't eject the jammed cartridge, the correct procedure was to remove the magazine, grip the weapon by forestock and carrying handle, and bash the butt against the ground as hard as possible. A thump or two usually got the rifle to spit out the jammed brass.
-   The key-insert for some older models of Saturn gets stuck, usually due to temperature change making the bits inside swell/shrink/shift. The best (only?) solution: smack it hard and firm a couple of times. Inspires great confidence in new passengers.
-   Apparently, there is/was a car used by the US Army that was fixed like this. This particular make and model would always break down in the exact same way and could always be fixed with the same method: kicking in just the right spot under the dash. There was actually a "painting duty" the soldiers had every so often where they would paint/repaint a red circle over the spot so the driver knew where to aim his foot without having to look/think too hard about it.
-   Works quite well if something like a remote control or calculator has a loose battery.
-   This man managed to fix his TV's screen by hitting the bezel with a hammer!
    
    **Man:** They say that... a hammer can fix anything, right? My TV's broken, yeah?  
    _\[hits television with hammer\]_  
    **Man:** Holy **SHIT.** WOW!
    
-   This guy used this technique successfully on a plasma TV. With a baseball bat.
-   The Hayabusa mission was supposed to return a capsule with samples of an asteroid. Due to some technical problem, it returned with only very small particles of dust, which had to be carefully extracted to be examined. In the end, the procedure they used was: turn the capsule upside down over a quartz disk and hit the capsule several times with a screwdriver.
-   This is also known to many people as an "RCA Kick" - as in, give that TV an RCA kick to get the v-hold back in line.
-   The "RCA Kick" name is actually a reference to the Radio Corporation of America, and the devices which first popularized this practice in the early days of mass-produced electronics. The finicky vacuum tubes and mechanical relay, switches, and toggles that were at the heart of any cutting-edge device allowed an unprecedented level of compactness and processing power, but low dust tolerance, extreme levels of heat (and thus heat expansion of mounts), and loose tolerances in production of sensitive parts meant that these devices required frequent reseating of tubes and contacts, unsticking of switches, and clearing of dust to function at their best. Most owners of early radios and televisions quickly learned that a swift light kick or whack to the right spot was actually a quick and fairly reliable way of accomplishing all of these tasks without having to miss the rest of a broadcast doing it properly. Given that it continues to occasionally actually work, (largely by doing the same thing for today's smaller and slightly less sensitive circuit boards) this remains Emergency Repair Procedure #1.
-   Related to destructive repair techniques is "Baking" (officially, "reflow soldering"), a delicate and highly technical process of getting a video card with screen artifacting to work again by literally baking it in a 380F oven for 8-10 minutes. Of particular interest to Nvidia 8800 and 9800 owners. This works because the official way of mounting a BGA chip on a board is baking it in a special oven, and some formulations of the modern leadless solder have a tendency to crack under repeated thermal stress, disconnecting the chip's pins. Re-baking the board in a home oven restores any disconnected solder joints the chips may have.
-   At least supposedly, some phone techs will ask users to tap their computer on the back side of the case. This is actually a subversion - the point is that in doing so, they'll look at the back and notice if a cord is unplugged, while if you ask them whether the network/power/etc is plugged in they'll get defensive.
-   One of the so-called "AI Koans" told at MIT has this as a variation:
    
    A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power off and on.  
    \[Tom\] Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: "You cannot fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding of what is going wrong."  
    Knight turned the machine off and on.  
    The machine worked.
    
-   This is a common quick fix for automotive starters. Most of the time the starter doesn't work because the throw-out bearing is bad. Hitting it with a hammer is often enough to get it to let the starter gear engage the flywheel and turn the engine over.
    -   Carburetors are preferred over electronic fuel injection precisely because they can be fixed with Percussive Maintenance when stuck.
    -   Sometimes, the wear on the starter gear teeth and flywheel gear teeth will get the starter stuck in the flywheel, and therefore starting the car is impossible (turning the key has no effect other than overheating the starter motor). Solution: engage second-tallest gear (either 3rd or 4th gear, depending on car) and push back and forth violently the car a few times. Stuck starter disengages with almost 100% certainty and starts afterwards.
-   With cheaper phones, such as the simpler TracFones, hitting the phone against a palm or thigh can generally fix problems with the battery, screen flickering, and signal loss; in ascending order of how often it works.
-   Cordless power tools, especially the older ones, react incredibly well to this technique.
-   US Army basic training — if your M-16 jams, try Sports: Slap, Pull, Observe, Release, Tap, Squeeze. In other words, hit it, take a look, then hit it again. (The forward assist on the M16 and its variants is specifically designed for the user to bash it there, for when a round doesn't seat properly.)
    -   Also can be part of your reload drill for the M16/M4. The Bolt Catch is actually quite small and doesn't need to move much for the bolt to be allowed to move into battery. Once the magazine is seated inside the well, slapping the rifle in the general vicinity will have the exact same effect as pressing the bolt release. This can even be achieved by slamming the magazine into the well hard enough, however this is NOT recommended
-   The easiest way to deal with a skipping record is to hit the turntable or the piece of furniture it's sitting on, jostling the needle a groove or two ahead. Jumping on the floor works sometimes too. Not really a solution, but it does the trick if all you want is to get through the rest of the record one time before having to break out the vinyl repair kit.
-   If your computer's video card is loose, it might not contact with the circuitry and your computer's display won't work. Although a better, long-term solution is to open up your computer and secure the card snugly, a simple short-term fix is to simply whack the side of your computer and hope that it encouraged the card back into place.
    -   This can also work with flickering projectors, for exactly the same reason - Something has probably worked loose and needs to be reseated. It's more likely to work with ceiling-mounted ones, though this is also harder for obvious reasons. Tapping them on the side with a broom handle or yardstick often works just as well.
-   Two cases of percussive fault-finding from a telecoms company that shall remain nameless: one of the official tests for one particular new installation was the coke-can test. Power the kit, put test traffic through it, then, with a full (still sealed!) can of soft drink in your hand, raise that hand above your head and let the can (still in your hand - you don't want a loose can bouncing around the place, it doesn't look professional) fall onto the top of the kit. Infrequently, this would reveal that one of the daughterboards was not fully seated, which would save the engineer a return trip a few weeks later when said daughterboard had worked its way loose. In a similar vein for a different piece of kit, the engineer was instructed to use a large bunch of keys to tap gently (just the swing on the ring, no force required) on the front plate, which would show up as signal errors on a traffic analyser if any of the optical fibres were slightly loose.
-   In The Vietnam War era Grumman A-6 Intruder, the analog-digital hybrid bombing computer (DIANE - _"Digital Integrated Attack Navigation Equipment"_) often stuck up during bombing runs - the established procedure was to gentle kick the side of the console pedestal, to try to get the gears and linkages to start moving again.
-   Almost mandatory to safely dislodge food stuck in a hot toaster without making a mess.
-   A more tragic example: William Bullock, inventor of a type of printing press, was installing one in 1867 when it developed a glitch. He attempted to kick it in a specific place, but his leg was caught in the machinery and severely injured. He died during an attempted amputation.
-   Onkyo home theater A/V receivers have a notorious reputation for faulty audio channels. Sometimes audio channels will stop working which can easily be fixed by tapping the receiver on the front or site with a hard object, like its remote control.
-   Ever been to an airport security checkpoint and wondered what those big sticks were on top of the X-Rays? Well, in the event that a bag gets stuck in the X-Ray machine, those sticks get put to use to either push the bag back into proper alignment or, pull the back out of the machine itself. Considering that the alternative is to shut the machine down, call a technician, have them dismantle part of the machine, get the bag out, re-check said bag, and put the machine back together is a bit expensive and time-consuming, whacking someone's bag with a stick to get it moving through the machine again suddenly sounds like a welcome alternative. Especially at large airports like JFK and LAX.
-   Xfinity XFi routers tend to make the internet connection slow down to the point of "Server Not Found" errors once in a while. One solution to this as found by a few is to hit the top of the router with your fist, which serves as a temporary fix.
-   In what must be the furthest out example thus far, the InSight lander on Mars encountered a problem when a deployed probe, dubbed the Mole, did not have enough friction to dig further (the soil was too loose, so it created more of a pit than a hole). The eventual solution was whacking it with the scoop arm of the lander, pinning it so that the Mole had more friction against one side of the hole.
-   During the making of _Banjo the Woodpile Cat_, the broken-down thirtieth-hand movieola the crew were using to run the pencil tests malfunctioned. Don Bluth, beyond frustrated, tried getting it back into order with a swift kick. _It ate the film._ At that point, despite being on a budget that only charitably could be called shoestring, Bluth and the others managed to find enough money for a new movieola.

When an ancient drone from Pangu Lagoon starts glitching and stating that its information is password-protected, Lilac gives it a good kick to reboot its systems. It worked and registered as a "correct password".
