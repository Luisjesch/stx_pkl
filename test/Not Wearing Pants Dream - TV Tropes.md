"Quite an example you're setting for your niece dressing like that."

**Kruber:** You seem a bit quieter of late, elf. Not that I'm complaining, you understand... or that I want you to be quiet... Taal, I'm no good at this.

**Kerillian:** Relax, mayfly. No offence was taken. I've had bad dreams of late, that's all. A common affliction amongst my kind.

**Kruber:** Yeah? I know what you mean. Couple of nights ago, I had this one with a giant squig, a jug of lamp oil, and Volkmar the Grim... and I was naked, too.

**Kerillian:** ... I confess that _does_ sound terrifying, at least to any witnesses.

A stock dream where the subject finds themselves in a familiar social institution (usually school or the workplace) wearing only their underwear, or sometimes nothing at all. This is often coupled with a high-pressure task (such as an examination or a deadline), and the thought that you have somehow _forgotten_ to get dressed this morning. In many cases no one else in the dream notices the dreamer isn't wearing enough clothes until the dreamer themselves notices at which point they typically react by pointing and laughing at the dreamer, who then notices their nudity and react with a Naked Freak-Out. Usually followed by a Skyward Scream followed by them waking up in a Catapult Nightmare.

Usually, this trope is invoked to simply indicate that the person is dreaming. When played straight, it is simply embarrassing, and not in the least bit erotic or terror-inducing. And it will never, ever be prophetic... although in comedy, it's occasionally subverted by having the "bad dream" turn out to not be a dream at all.

This kind of dream is definitely Truth in Television and quite common in fact, though perhaps not as much as media shows it, nor always with the same structure and conclusion. After all, Real Dreams are Weirder.

A Sub-Trope of Anxiety Dreams. See also Fully-Clothed Nudity.

See also Out-of-Clothes Experience, Comedic Underwear Exposure, and Naked Freak-Out. Not to be confused with Pants-Free (a specific sight gag where someone is revealed to be partly undressed Behind the Black); the everyday attire of a Half-Dressed Cartoon Animal; a superhero who is Not Wearing Tights; or situations where a character isn't wearing pants but doesn't care. Also not to be confused with Going Commando. Expect Goofy Print Underwear to make an appearance in most cases of this.

The inversion is Nude-Colored Clothes. To a British audience, this trope would be "only wearing pants" since in Britain "pants" are what Americans call "underpants". "Not wearing pants" in Britain would either be "going commando" or "completely nude".

If someone finds themselves unexpectedly naked in public when they're _awake_, see Naked People Trapped Outside and Gone Swimming, Clothes Stolen. See Sleeps in the Nude for characters who sleep in the buff and Undressing the Unconscious for characters that are stripped while they're unconscious.

Crashing Dreams may have this as Five-Second Foreshadowing the character is about to wake up naked and awkward. See also Cringe Comedy.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Boxer_:
    
    \[Harry\] regained consciousness too quickly for his liking. As he did a mental checklist and found that he was bound, physically and magically. He couldn't touch his own power. From his position on his back on his floor he looked around to find himself, unsurprisingly, in the centre of a ring of Death Eaters. They were back in the graveyard. And he was naked, brilliant. This was way worse than that dream where he was in Transfiguration and he was supposed to transfigure a bird and wrist watch into a cuckoo clock but ended up naked instead.
    
-   _Crumpets Aren't My Style_:
    
    As the day progressed O'Neill overheard dozens of disturbing dreams recounted. Fortunately they were not all mentioned directly to him. He couldn't seem to walk into a room without hearing about Lieutenant Kemper falling out of a plane or Colonel Linn stepping through the gate and realizing he was naked in front of a battalion of serpent guards.
    
-   Mentioned by Ace in the _Doctor Who_ webcast _Death Comes to Time_. When Casmus tells her about the importance and significance of dreams, she fires back by mentioning that hers are basically useless.
    
    **Ace:** I just end up with my trousers down in the classroom!
    
-   Inverted in _Earth and Sky_. Since ponies think nothing of going without clothes, their version of this trope is when they dream about being _overdressed_ in public. In particular, Diamond Tiara dreams about being back in school, wearing a ridiculously Pimped-Out Dress in the classroom.
-   In _A Familiar Friend_ Harry dreams that he's facing the dragon in the First Task while wearing only boxers and shoes.
-   In _In This World For You_ Harry dreams that his six-year-old self is standing in the Potions classroom wearing nothing but hand-me-down underwear from his much larger cousin.
-   Chloe in _Infinity Train: Cherry Bloodlines_ suffers a variation of this. After seeing her mother wearing a _very_ bold sling bikini at the beach, she has a nightmare of herself wearing it at school, while Yeardley leers at her.
-   In _Isis's Bane: A New Home_ Harry claims to have dreamt about being naked in front of his class to hide the fact that his actual dream was about a boy Isis killed while he was her host.
-   In the _Sailor Moon_ and _Ranma ½_ crossover _No Chance for Fate_, this is given a dark twist. Ami does have the normal dream of appearing in school naked. Thanks to her dreams being manipulated, it almost turns into a gang rape until Ranma shows up (their minds are linked) and helps her out.
-   In the _Jackie Chan Adventures_ fic _Queen of All Oni_, Jade has one in the second interlude — and this is the most normal thing about that dream!

-   In _The Videus Charm_ Harriet dreams about participating in the Triwizard Tournament while not wearing pants, revealing her snitch underwear to all of Europe.
-   _Xander's Green Eyed Obsession_:
    
    **Anya:** I can't stop thinking about you. Sometimes in my dreams you're naked.  
    **Xander:** If I'm in the checkout line at Wal-Mart, I've had the same one.
    
-   _The Palaververse_: _Wedding March_: Talking about bad dreams, this is one component:
    
    To a certain type of Asinian, this sort of situation was dreamed about, and was on a par with dreams about turning up both understudied and naked to important exams. Assuming said Asinians customarily wore clothes.

Confused, she then steps away from behind the podium that was concealing her and the camera changes to a Toplessness from the Back shot where she stands nude in front of the crowd, who starts laughing harder, and she finally notices her nudity. Cue Naked Freak-Out followed by a Catapult Nightmare.

    For I was in the nude  
    The old Queen disapproved  
    But people laughed and asked  
    For autographs

-   A quest in _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_ involves helping a mage who was experimenting with dreamworlds and became lost within his own subconscious, his body having been locked in a coma for weeks. To enter his dream and wake him up, you need to fall asleep while wearing a special amulet and when you enter the dream, you'll find that the amulet is now the only thing you are wearing (it also applies a constant Silence effect to you, so you can't use magic). While granted, this is to make sure that your inventory is empty so you will complete the puzzles in the manner intended, _the mage gets to keep his clothes, so why are you the one that's stuck naked, dammit?!_

-   Implied, but ultimately subverted, in the _Sam & Max: Freelance Police_ game "What's New, Beelzebub?".

    Real Life 

-   Pants-less or fully-nude nightmares do occur in real life and are fairly common (as far as nightmares go). The general consensus among health experts is that such dreams are the result of anxiety in the dreamer's waking life (and, you know, people sleeping either completely pantless or in very loose-fitting pajamas). For instance, people preparing for a wedding often report such dreams.
-   Concurrent to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Some people reported dreaming about forgetting their face masks or other protective gear in public.
-   A subversion was reported in one of the Time Life book series on dreams. A teenage boy reported dreaming that he showed up to class and started stripping to the cheers of his classmates. As he had very recently become sexually active, the researcher speculated he was celebrating his ability to overcome his inhibitions.
