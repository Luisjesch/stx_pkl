_"Or does it explode?"_

— **Langston Hughes**, "A Dream Deferred" (last line)

Sometimes a comedic piece, rather than a punchline, will have everything suddenly explode instead. The randomness combined with the coolness factor of explosions is guaranteed to get some laughs.

This is a subtrope of Stuff Blowing Up. Also compare Drop the Cow.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Advertising 

-   Some Old Spice commercials played with this trope.
-   A recent (as of June 2017) ad for Johnsonville Brats featured an ad guy discussing his new ad campaign. At the end he comments on this trope:
    
    "I don't know haw it ends. Maybe an explosion." \*BOOM\*
    

    Fan Works 

-   _The Marionette tries to listen to his musicbox_ ends with the Marionette suddenly throwing a nuclear bomb at Balloon Boy while frenzied electronic music plays, creating an explosion. The credits acknowledge the randomness of this ending:
    
    You as the one who is probably confused about what just happened and why everything exploded
    
-   This _Touhou Project_ doujin explains how to wrap up your story if you run out of ideas.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Near the end of _Caddyshack_, Carl Spackler uses a bunch of plastic explosives as a last resort against the gopher. (Never mind that there's a crucial golf game going on.)
-   The Three Stooges used this ending in quite a few shorts.
-   _Dr. Strangelove_ ends in this precise manner, in a very Black Comedy sense.
-   Luis Buñuel's last film, _That Obscure Object of Desire_, ends with an unexpected explosion (foreshadowed by terrorist attacks alluded to during the film) apparently killing the main characters as they seem to be working toward some resolution of their differences.
-   The film adaptation of _V for Vendetta_ ends with Evey blowing up Parliament with V's Subway Train filled with Explosives, both to honor his last wish to avenge the years of torture he had suffered from their experiments, and to help free London from its corrupt government. Doubles as a Book End since the film started with an early explosion as well, with V blowing up the _Old Bailey_.
-   _Bride of the Monster_, which as shown by _Ed Wood_, was a request by the film's new financial backer - which certainly raises questions as for why the mad scientist being attacked by an octopus suddenly leads to a nuclear explosion.
-   _Doppelgänger_ ends with Ross crashing the replacement lander into a parked spacecraft, killing him and causing a chain reaction that destroys most of the Space Centre and all records of his presence on the counter-Earth.

    Live Action TV 

-   _The Goodies_ episode "Earthansia" ends with the BBC1 spinning Earth logo blowing up.
-   Several skits end that way in _Monty Python's Flying Circus_.
    -   The "Penguin on the Telly" sketch begins with: "that was episode two of "The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots", specially adapted for radio by Gracie Fields and Joe Frazier. And now, Radio Four will explode." BLAM! So the old ladies watch a TV show instead, which ends with a presenter announcing "It's just gone 8 o'clock, and time for the penguin on top of your television set to explode." Cue the penguin exploding violently.
    -   "Le Fromage Grande", a parody of French arthouse films, ends with a head of lettuce turning out to be a ticking bomb, which explodes.
-   Many, many episodes of _MythBusters_. If it's a montage of explosions (as used in several specials), expect the climax of The 1812 Overture to accompany the montage.
-   The end of the pilot and the end of the series finale of _The Young Ones_.
-   The punchline to the MacGruber skits on _Saturday Night Live_, where the room that the eponymous character and his partners are trapped with always explodes, due to MacGruber's incompetence.
-   _The Secret Life Of Machines_' ending sequence is usually a bunch of the machines du jour exploding while "Take Five" plays.
-   _The Brittas Empire_: The episode “Back With A Bang” ends with Gavin's car getting blown up.

    Music 

-   On the P.D.Q. Bach album _The Short-Tempered Clavier and other dysfunctional works for keyboard_, the final chord of "Sonata da Circo" is followed by a track of sounds of the steam calliope exploding.
-   In Stan Freberg's version of "The World is Waiting for the Sunrise", the music gets faster and faster until the point where the equipment is smoking. Freberg tells everyone to run for their lives and screams before it explodes.

    Puppet Shows 

-   A favorite of _The Muppet Show_. Jim Henson was on record stating that whenever he can't think of an ending for a skit he just has everything explode.

-   Many episodes of _The Goon Show_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Entirely possible in the Chess variant atomic chess.

    Video Games 

-   Exaggerated in the best ending of _Hyper Princess Pitch_.

This move is called Galactic Princess Bus TAAH for a reason!
    
    **Pitch:** _Awesome._
    
-   In the Flash puzzle game _Shift 4_, taking the escape rocket somehow causes the universe to explode.

    Web Animation 

-   This _Eddsworld_ cartoon, at least before The Stinger.

-   _The Demented Cartoon Movie_ has multiple skits end this way.

-   The result of the Gainax Ending existence failure in the James Rolfe parody film _The Wizard of Oz 3: Dorothy Goes to Hell_.

-   The _Supermarioglitchy4's Super Mario 64 Bloopers_ episode "SM64: Meet the Steve" ends with the castle blowing up. Apparently this is subverted because Steve was responsible for it.

    **SMG4:** Yaaaaaay!

Arbiter, having already crossed the Despair Event Horizon by attempting to kill himself earlier, solemnly agrees and doesn't resist. Allowing him and Chief to be killed in the ensuing explosion.

    Real Life 

-   A lot more things can explode than one would expect. For instance, there is such a thing as a "dust explosion," which can happen where there is a sufficient particulate density in the air of an enclosed space of any combustible substance like sawdust, flour or talcum powder and there is a sufficient large spark to ignite it.
