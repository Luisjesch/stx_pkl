Gabriel lets Mary know that Virgin Power ain't without its uses.

_"And the angel said to him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news."_

One of the best-known angels (and one of three to be specifically named), Gabriel is the messenger of God. His most famous act was foretelling the births of Jesus and John the Baptist, though he appeared as early as the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament. Because he is explicitly mentioned as the angel who comes to earth to inform the people, in fiction he is often shown interacting with humans, in addition to the higher angels' role as warriors. Many also identify him as the angel of the Last Judgement, and with the Ministering Angel who came to Jesus in Gethsemane. Gabriel, known as Jibril, plays a similar role in Islam (he appears to Muhammad, and the revelations so transmitted are _The Qur'an_) and the Baha'i Faith. In Latter-day Saint theology, Gabriel is believed to have led a mortal life as Noah.

He (and nowadays sometimes "she") is a Public Domain Character, from The Bible, of course, though his status as an Archangel is never specified in the book itself.

Gabriel has commonly been depicted heralding messages with a horn, so the Horn of Gabriel may show up in fiction quite a bit. Said horn is often granted the epithet "Gabriel's Horn of Truth", and is occasionally seen as being used to herald the coming of the apocalypse itself. Sometimes, instead of a trumpet, he's holding a lily or a cup (representing Mary's purity and femininity). Gabriel himself is strongly associated with Seers, prediction, and clairvoyance in his messages.

Because of Meaningful Names, characters named Gabriel have generally been good guys. However, since angels have largely shifted out of Always Lawful Good territory in contemporary media, the name Gabriel has lost some of its street cred, particularly considering his links to Death and being "The Angel of God's Left Hand". Either way, these characters are Gabriel In Name Only, so please don't list them here.

Also, as reading several of the examples below show, he tends to fill the "angel doing bad, bad things" role quite often these days for some reason.

Subtrope of Celestial Paragons and Archangels. See his brethren in Archangel Azrael, Archangel Michael, Archangel Raphael, Archangel Uriel, and (possibly) the Fallen Angel version in Archangel Lucifer, aka Satan. Also take a look at Our Angels Are Different.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Angel Sanctuary_: Gabriel herself does not truly appear with all her memories, but Sara is her reincarnation, after being forced to... reincarnate... by Sevothatarte, for opposing his rule in Heaven. Sara temporarily uses her body, but Raphael restores her to her own body, and the body of Gabriel, also known as Jibril, is placed in the Water Garden again. We can assume that after Sara lives her happy, normal life with Setsuna that they finally achieved at the end of the manga, she will be restored to being Gabriel, with all her memories, when she dies.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_ has Archangel Gabriel (called simply **POWER OF GOD** in the English translation of the LN) appear as a result of a "Freaky Friday" Flip spell causing it to inhabit a human body. Because angels normally don't have free will, becoming human _drives it completely insane_, and it becomes obsessed with killing the caster of the spell so it can get back to heaven. Its plan to do this involves turning day into night so it can rearrange the stars in the sky into a giant magic circle that will blast Earth with the spell that destroyed Babylon. Priests witnessing these events note that this is even more horrifying than it sounds, as using God's power to kill people who weren't ordained for it could potentially send the Last Judgement itself Off the Rails.  
    Later it's properly summoned by Fiamma of the Right to restore the balance altered by the Star of Bethlehem, and the entire might of France and England couldn't lay a scratch on it.
    -   Acqua of the Back, William Orville, is the member of God's Right Seat who pulls his power from Gabriel. He's explicitly stated to be just as skilled as Gabriel itself at water magic.
    -   Also, every person stated to be aligned with the Archangel Gabriel has power over water.

-   _Gabriel Dropout_: The main character is a young, blonde angel named Gabriel, who graduated at the top of her class in heaven's school and descended to Earth to study humans. Soon after coming down, she discovers video games and turns into a slobby slacker, playing on the "talks to humans" and "does bad, bad things" parts. In addition, she owns a horn that will cause the end of the world if she blows it and is willing to use it as a quasi-Reset Button when things go badly for her. Whether she really is the biblical Gabriel or just shares the name and similarities is unclear.
-   _High School D×D_: Gabriel is a woman and she's considered as Heaven's Strongest Woman and Heaven's Most Beautiful Woman (which we do not see her face at all, until really late in the story and she is indeed a knockout). In this series, she's more of The Ditz considering that she didn't know that Issei was targeting her to pull off his Dress Break on her (it didn't work as events conspired against Issei).
-   _No Game No Life_: Jibril is one of the Flügels, a race of angelic beings created as Living Weapons. After the war ended, she collects books and knowledge from around the world.
-   _O-Parts Hunter_ features ten demons and angels, one of which is Gabriel.
-   _Saint Beast_: An important angel named Gabriel appears, but he's probably not modeled on the traditional Gabriel as the work's cosmology is a bit of a melting pot and this Gabriel actually allies himself with Lucifer and goes to Hell.
-   _Seven Heavenly Virtues_: Gabriel is a woman and the Angel of Chastity, despite wearing an extremely revealing outfit. She is constantly lecturing people to stop indecent behavior and when she gets a human boyfriend, she insists on no sex.
-   _Shaman King_: Archangel Gabriel appears as a spirit ally to minor character Meene Montgomery.

    Comic Books 

-   _Crimson_: Gabriel appears as a redheaded woman a few times, along with Archangel Michael and five other archangels. Too bad they're all holier-than-thou assholes who despise humanity (but have come to enjoy indulging in some of its vices).
-   _Hellblazer_: Gabriel appears as an arrogant snob in London. He is constantly being tormented by his thoughts about whether God created him to be a good angel of mankind or a powerful heavenly killer. And the Annunciation is actually depicted as Gabriel _raping_ and impregnating Mary. John Constantine later tricks him into sleeping with a succubus, where he gets his heart ripped out of him. Although alive, Gabriel comes under control of Constantine, who uses him in his fight against Satan, First of the Fallen. He is killed in the process.
-   _Lucifer_: Gabriel appears in a single panel near the end during a flashback. He was apparently supposed to form a trinity with Michael and Samael as the ones who carried out God's will but appears to have fallen out of favour at some point. This is probably because _Lucifer_, as part of the Vertigo imprint, needed to maintain continuity with other Vertigo comics, of which _Hellblazer_ is one.
-   _Marvel Universe_: One of Galactus' heralds, Gabriel the Air-Walker. Besides the name and appearance, he comes complete with a horn that he uses to summon the Planet Eater.
-   _Teen Titans_: Malcolm Duncan possesses the Gabriel Horn, which allows him to open portals and generate sonic blasts. Pre-Crisis, the Horn was given by Gabriel himself, after Mal won a boxing match against the Archangel Azrael (not the other Azrael), which Gabriel refereed.

    Fan Works 

-   _Codex Equus_: Midday Messenger, the Brilliant Herald and the alicorn goddess of messengers and trickery, is intended to be the counterpart of him to go along with Ascending Dawn's Archangel Michael and Morning Star's Satan. In particular, her status as a messenger and herald fits Gabriel's traditional role as God's messenger and herald in Biblical lore.
-   _Earth-27_: More than any of the other archangels, Gabriel loves humanity and the cultures of Earth. He's one of the least among his peers in terms of raw power, but he is often regarded as being as cunning as Lucifer, only with a heart of gold. He was the Metatron of Heaven, serving as the Presence's most holy messenger, until he decided to leave Heaven on a journey of self-discovery and left the title to his apprentice.
-   _Manchester Lost_: Gabriel appears as a Deadpan Snarker who gets annoyed by every single thing Michael says or does, and spends his life bemoaning his stupidity. He's also been in love with him since the beginning of creation. He admits this eventually.
-   _Misfiled Dreams_: Rumisiel's fevered dream in the first chapter includes him and his brother defying their father, the Archangel Gabriel.
-   _Sonic X: Dark Chaos_: Gabriel is referenced as one of four Archangels (himself, Raphael, Michael, and Tephiroth) who lead the military forces of the Angel Federation. Gabriel is a diplomat and negotiator at heart who forges alliances between the Federation and other anti-Demon elements.

    Live-Action TV

-   _Good Omens (2019)_: Gabriel himself is a character in the series, depicted in the form of Jon Hamm. While he was only briefly mentioned in the original book, he has a much bigger role in the series, being Aziraphale's direct superior who often shows up to give him orders from Heaven. However, he's not as nice as he tries to pretend to be since he doesn't care at all about Earthly affairs and is only concerned about Heaven winning against Hell once Armageddon starts.

-   _The Haunting Hour_: "Detention" involves a group of teens who discover that the detention they had been sentenced to is actually a form of purgatory, and the person watching over them to judge where they should go is a kid they had just met named Gabe, a clear reference to Gabriel.

    **Spock:** I fail to see the humor in that situation, Doctor.  
    **McCoy:** Naturally. You could hardly claim to be an angel with those pointed ears, Mister Spock. But say you landed someplace with a pitchfork...
    
-   _Supernatural_: It's revealed in season 5 that the recurring character the Trickster is actually the Archangel Gabriel. His role as messenger seems to be fulfilled in his _modus operandi_, teaching the conceited that there are powers above them. Interestingly, he is also the Norse God Loki, whom he struck a deal with to impersonate him for a few millennia. Gabriel himself refers to this as his own personal "Witness Protection". Ultimately, he and Castiel are among the only angels who actually followed what God asked of them: protect, love, and serve humanity. Gabriel, however, goes from being the son who denies his true nature in order to hide from his dysfunctional family to being a hero of mankind when he stands up to his brother Lucifer, who has long been bitter about the fact that God created humans and expected angels to love them and has a longstanding rivalry with their brother Michael.
    
    **Gabriel:** Oh, I'm loyal. To them.  
    **Lucifer:** Who? These so-called gods?  
    **Gabriel:** To people, Lucifer. People.  
    **Lucifer:** So, you're willing to die for a pile of cockroaches. Why?  
    **Gabriel:** Because Dad was right. They are better than us.  
    **Lucifer:** They are broken! Flawed! Abortions!  
    **Gabriel:** Damn right, they're flawed, but a lot of them try. To do better. To forgive... I've been riding the pine a long time, but I'm in the game now. And I'm not on your side, or Michael's. I'm on theirs.  
    **Lucifer:** Brother, don't make me do this.  
    **Gabriel:** No one _makes_ us do _anything_!
    
    -   He also gets what is possibly the most hilarious line spoken between angels<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  when he says, "Lucifer, you're my brother and I love you, but _you are a great big bag of dicks_."
    -   Gabriel's Horn is referenced in season 6, though it is not seen and turns out to be a Red Herring.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In "A Passage for Trumpet", trumpet player Joey Crown (played by Jack Klugman) makes a decision to live or die with the help of a trumpet player who later turns out to be the angel Gabriel.

    Music 

-   Black Kids: "Look At Me (When I Rock Wichoo)" mentions "Gabriel's trumpet" announcing the beginning of biblical apocalypse.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   The Bible is the Trope Maker, making Gabriel Older Than Feudalism. He is described as "one who looked like a man," with a tendency to make people fall down in fright. Usually, he has to reassure them and tell them not to be afraid. In addition to announcing the births of Jesus and John the Baptist in the New Testament, Gabriel first appeared to the prophet Daniel to help interpret his apocalyptic visions of the future. Gabriel himself seems to use the tropes about him to make a point while announcing John's birth. Zechariah (the father-to-be, who was an important priest and really should have known better) asks for proof that this message will actually come true. Gabriel's response can be paraphrased as: "I'm Gabriel. You know, that figure who appears in your holy texts? Standing near God and then being sent by Him to explain things to Daniel? Yeah, that was me. God sent me to Earth to give this message to you. I've appeared miraculously in the most holy place on Earth, right in front of your eyes. It's blatantly obvious I'm giving you a message from God. And your reply is to ask for proof? Seriously? Fine then, here's proof that this is real: as of now, you're no longer able to speak. You'll get your voice back once the stuff I was telling about has happened."
-   While Gabriel is a notable archangel in Judaism and Christianity, he (also known as Jibril) is the most important angel in Islam, and the one that most Muslims know by heart. In an oft-cited list of ten angels of God in Islamic folklore, Gabriel is always cited first.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In addition to informing Mary of Jesus' birth, he was the angel who revealed The Qur'an to The Prophet Muhammad over a period of 23 years. In some translations of the Qur'an, the _Ruh_, the Arabic word for the Holy Spirit, is taken to be Gabriel himself. By contrast, the Archangel Michael has a _single_ mention in the scripture<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and is only slightly more important in the exegesis.
-   In the new occultism that arose at the turn of the twentieth century, which claims to draw on ancient esoteric texts and traditions, Gabriel is one of the four Angels of the Presence who the Golden Dawn magick group (its most prominent members included W. B. Yeats and Aleister Crowley) would summon to guard the Four Cardinal Points. Gabriel's mystic associations are with the North, the Moon, the colour yellow, and the Cabbalistic plane of Yesod.

    Radio 

-   _Old Harry's Game_: Two separate Archangel Gabriels appear. However, they're both officious creeps who'd like to see Satan somehow sent somewhere even _worse_ than Hell.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Anima: Beyond Fantasy_ has Gabriel as female as well as one of the seven Beryls (godly spirits of light). She is identified by the humans with the archangel of the same name, present in the game setting's christianism, and has associated positive feelings such as love, friendship, and peace as well as the arts.
-   _In Nomine_: Gabriel, the Ofanite Archangel of Fire, is a Mad Oracle who lives in a Heavenly volcano. He may have been driven to madness by the persecution of the Archangel Dominic, who believes that Gabriel rewrote the Quran when she was sent to dictate it to Mohammed, or by the strain of sharing a Word with a Demon Prince. These days, Gabriel more frequently appears as a woman. She used to be Heaven's messenger but has refused this duty since the scandal that surrounded the birth of Islam. She also owns a trumpet whose sound can be heard through all creation and, when certain very specific things happen, she sounds a single blast from it. When the trumpet is blown seven times, Armageddon begins.
-   _In Nomine Satanis / Magna Veritas_: Gabriel's been AWOL ever since founding Islam. It turns out that God singled him out for a 1400-year-long deep-cover mission without any memory of who or what he really is.
-   _Witchcraft_: Gabriel is the biggest douche of the Archangels. His machinations resulted in the creation of the Combine, every evil conspiracy organization stereotype out there. His douchebaggery resulted in the archangel "Michelle" leaving Heaven to form the Alliance. In the sequel, _Armageddon_, it turns out he was thoroughly Out-Gambitted by the Church Of Revelations (servants of the Mad God Leviathan), and that not only was his pet project thoroughly infiltrated and subverted towards _their_ cause, said pet project's asshattery towards all of humanity in general and the numerous mystical Ancient Traditions running around specifically (including several false flag operations so they'd fight each other instead of their true enemies) was as instrumental in the Church's unstoppable takeover of almost half the world early in the war, thereby ensuring that Leviathan's forces are dangerously close to victory—which wouldn't mean just The End of the World as We Know It, but the total unmaking of reality and its recreation according to Leviathan's utterly alien will. Even after this comes to light, Gabriel is still a Holier Than Thou Jerkass Knight Templar who refuses to admit any fault in this and refuses to collaborate with anyone who doesn't worship (his personal version of) God's will (not that he actually knows what that will is, as nobody knows where the Creator has been in 20 000 years) and recognise him and the angels who side with him as their superiors in all things, further dividing the opposition to the Church of Revelations and marking him as dangerously close to being Too Haughty To Live. By comparison, even The Legions of Hell (who all hate humanity and non-Fallen Angels on principle since the Fall) are on board with their Enemy Mine situation with The Alliance and other factions opposed to Leviathan.

    Theatre 

-   _Anything Goes_: The Show Stopper number is "Blow, Gabriel, Blow", which is about how Gabriel's trumpet saved the singer from sin.

-   _The Green Pastures_: Gabriel's The Lancer to God, and is often found urging God to give humanity a break.
-   _Mystère_ has a loose take on this character; its Archangels (usually called Les Laquais nowadays) are selfless guardians of Earthlings. The All There in the Manual backstory of the aerial cube act, the first big acrobatic setpiece in the show, is that of Gabriel resisting the temptations of The Vamp.

    Video Games 

-   _Dawn of War_: The main campaign features a saintly (by Imperial standards) Space Marine named Gabriel Angelos. Now, the name might just be a coincidence, but the Emperor's Space Marines do refer to themselves as his "Angels of Death"...
-   _Granblue Fantasy_ has Gabriel as a female water Primarch, serving under the supreme primarch Lucifer, who is in this video game universe is the Big Good and the strongest of the primarchs, as his title would imply. She is the water elements Cosmic Keystone, being the only thing regulating it in keeping it in balance. She is depicted as being quite clever in "What Makes the Sky Blue", as upon learning that her fellow primarchs save for Lucifer were struck down and had their wings snatched by the events Big Bad, she went into hiding as a mortal nurse. After ditching her disguise and confronting the enemy, she allows Michael to destroy her wings so that the enemy, who is also a primarch that can utilize the wings himself, could not gain access to their power. Outside of being clever, she is the kindest and most easy-going of the "main angels". However, she is shown to get serious when the occasion arises and takes her duties as one of the primarchs very seriously.
-   _Makai Tenshi Djibril_, an Eroge, has an angel named Loveriel apparently transforming girls into the angel Djibril. It has a cute opening.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_: With the exception of the first game and a few one-off instances, Gabriel is portrayed as the only female Seraph and, in the second installment, stands apart from the other Seraphim when their goals diverge from God's. This means, that, unfortunately for her, she has to occasionally play the Only Sane Man among the Four Archangels. When she doesn't join them in the Knight Templar and Well-Intentioned Extremist camp.
    -   She generally appears as a Persona of the Empress Arcana in the _Persona_ series, although in _Persona 2: Eternal Punishment_ her arcana is Judgement to match Ellen's personal arcana. _Persona 5_ puts her under the Temperance Arcana.
    -   _Shin Megami Tensei IV_: She and the other three Archangels appear together, in freakish otherworldly forms that are unlike their depictions in other _Megami Tensei_ games. Oh, and Sister Gabby, whom you see accompanying Hugo in his appearances? That's Gabriel's human disguise.
    -   _Persona 5_: A Shadow resembling Gabriel is one of Yaldabaoth's heralds. Unlike the other three, who are all incredibly zealous, she attempts to reason with the Phantom Thieves before ultimately deciding to fight them.
-   _Star Ocean_ has a bonus boss named "Gabriel Celeste", one half of a duo and the lesser male Half Identical Twin of an even stronger Angel Optional Boss named Iseria Queen. The "Celeste" part is to differentiate from a Person of Mass Destruction named after the angel Gabriel who was the boss of _Star Ocean: The Second Story_.
-   _Rage of Bahamut_: There exists a version of Gabriel. Like Uriel and Raphael, she is a Gender Flip. In the Anime, she is the de-facto leader of the Arch Angels.
-   In _ULTRAKILL_, Gabriel is the messenger of God whose brutal effectiveness in carrying out The Council's commands made him popular with the other angels, until his defeat by V1. He's also a far cry from his benevolent poem counterpart, upholding the suffering of Hell's sinners to punish them for their sins, and going as far as murdering King Minos and imprisoning his soul for freeing Lust's sinners from their eternal torment.

    Web Animation 

-   _Angel Hare_ has Angel Gabby, who claims to be the main character Jonah's guardian angel and communicates with him through a religious cartoon from his childhood.

    Webcomics 

-   _Adventures of God_: Although he is only ever referred to as Gabe, he is God's loyal assistant (and the real heavy lifter here). He is shown to be directly responsible for animal creation and ensuring the universe works smoothly. Interestingly, unlike the dead souls, he is never depicted with wings despite being an archangel.
-   _Beyond the End_: Gabriel is End's older brother and the pillar holding Heaven together. He's shyer than the other archangels and chronically fatigued after decades of overwork. He's trapped in Heaven for fear it will crumble without him, so can't go to help End.
-   _Covenant_: Gabriel is Ezra's patron and the first angel he ever met.
-   _Deities_: Gabriel is God's messenger as well as personal servant. He's referred to as Gabe and most of the other angels don't particularly like him.
-   _Holy Bibble_: Gabriel is one of the main angels. His job is very bureaucratic, and he often finds himself having to clean up some of the messes both the fallen and his fellow angels make.
-   _Lessa_: Gabriel serves as one of Ra's Apostles, and is typically the angel who updates the other Apostles on significant events and explains things to Rano.
-   _Misfile_: Gabriel appears in flashback as the father of Rumisiel and Vashiel.
-   _My Best Friend Marneao_: Gabriel is the general of Heaven's Army. He is a chubby juggernaut who could fight against abominations without problem. This is quite an odd take of him since he is usually the messenger, not a general.
-   _Sister Claire_: A female angel named Gabrielle comes to tell the titular character she's been selected as the next mother of the Messiah and continues to communicate with her throughout the comic.

    Web Video 

-   Subverted in the _Mandela Catalogue_. The angelic being that visited Mary was really the Devil in Disguise; yep, Satan managed to Kill and Replace an archangel.

    Western Animation 

-   _Superbook (2011)_: Gabriel shows up in a few episodes to act in his familiar role as a messenger to certain Bible characters. Specifically, he appears in "The Birth of Jesus" to inform the shepherds of Christ's birth and location, and in "The Birth of John the Baptist" to tell Zechariah and Mary about their respective children who will soon be born (and he also pronounces temporary loss of speech on Zechariah for his unbelief).

    Other 

-   In mathematics, the trumpet-like shape generated by rotating the graph f(x) = 1/x around the x-axis is called Gabriel's Horn. It has infinite surface area but only finite volume, thereby linking the divine with the mortal, and has been proposed in 2004 that the Universe could be shaped like it.
-   Gabriel and his horn are featured in the final line of "The Eyes of Texas".
-   Gabriel and/or his horn is often referenced in African-American spirituals.
-   In Johnny Cash's song "Ain't No Grave", he sings, "Well, look down yonder, Gabriel/Put your feet on the land and sea/But Gabriel, don't you blow your trumpet/Until you hear from me."
-   A heckler once told Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies, "I wouldn't vote for you if you were the Archangel Gabriel!" Menzies replied, "If I were the Archangel Gabriel, you wouldn't be in my constituency."
