**Needy Lesnicki:** I thought you only murdered boys?  
**Jennifer Check:** I go both ways.

In most series, either Everyone Is Bi or there are No Bisexuals; there's usually not much room in between. However, there is one group of bisexuals who seem all too well represented in the mainstream: the cold-blooded murderous sociopaths.

This is a very different phenomenon from the Psycho Lesbian trope. Whereas the Psycho Lesbian is usually violent or deranged out of unrequited love and/or jealousy, the typical Depraved Bisexual is bi because, well, why not? Their willingness to sleep with everyone they can is just one facet of their Ax-Craziness — i.e. they don't consider certain relationships taboo, because they don't consider _anything_ taboo. A slightly less pathological version of the trope depicts the Depraved Bisexual as "simply" supremely manipulative; recognizing the effectiveness of sex as a control mechanism, they resort to it at every opportunity — reasoning that successful seductions gain new thralls, while even unsuccessful ones tend to increase others' fear of you. Male instances are disproportionately likely to be Sissy Villains, but not as often as you might think.

Interestingly enough, though, many if not most Lesbian Vampires are in fact bisexual. Fanservice, you know.

More common in film than on TV, where LGBT+ folk of any sort, and especially bisexuals, were originally a rarity (this changed over time). Of the TV instances, several are Mirror Universe duplicates, to show just _how_ evil and different they are from the originals. At one time this was practically the only way an explicitly bisexual character could appear in any film, anywhere; in his book _Bisexual Characters in Film_, Wayne Bryant is able to fill a whole chapter of examples of this, as well as another book about bisexual murder victims. In more pleasant examples, bisexual characters simply don't follow Cast Speciation as much as a solidly gay character does and are less likely to be used. An exception is in a mystery plot, where a potential ex-lover being a suspect suddenly becomes much harder to pin down.

Contrast No Love for the Wicked, where their lack of sexual interest is what underscores their villainous nature; and Really Gets Around, where the bisexual/pansexual character just happens to be _also_ hypersexual, or Extreme Omnisexual, where the character is willing to bang anything. See also the older, far more discredited trope of the Depraved Homosexual, which this trope has largely replaced in modern works, and Pragmatic Pansexuality, where a character is willing to use seduction and sex to manipulate people regardless of gender, but is not necessarily actually attracted to those they sleep with.

-   Prinna Domma from Aza Smith's _Grindhouse and Watercolors_. She once held an abusive relationship with Ebony and eventually left her for Psychopomp.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn, the former frequently using Mind Control pheromones as a weapon against both men and women, the latter almost as love-crazed for Ivy as for the Joker, with the sexual component of their relationship, having received frequent hints even in the animated series, canon in the main universe of the comic books. Though the latter is also something of a subversion. Generally, their time together is portrayed quite positively, when they aren't committing crimes anyway, and shows Harley taking just a bit of independence from Mista' J. In the _Harley Quinn_ solo comic, she's fully bisexual, with her bisexuality being entirely dissociated from her moral ambiguity.
    -   In _Arkham Asylum: Living Hell_, when Jane Doe pretends to be Anne Carver, she looks (unsuccessfully) to find men to date like how Anne would and talks of licking caviar off the thighs of college girls instead of Warren. Her sexuality might vary depending on whomever's life she's trying to steal.
    -   The Joker is completely and utterly insane and sadistic. _The Killing Joke_ shows the not-yet Joker's pregnant wife saying that he's "good in the sack". There's also the few and far-between Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other moments he has with Harley. Plus all that Foe Romance Subtext he has toward Batman — Harley and Ivy both think that the Joker only has eyes for Batman. Joker has often professed affection toward Batman (complete with moments of desperate attention-needing) and in "Cacophony" Joker explicitly states that he wants Batman sexually... although, being the Joker, he wants him sexually only after he's dead.
    -   Joker's Distaff Counterpart from the Elseworld _Batman: Thrillkiller_, Bianca Steeplechase, is a ruthless crime boss who seduces a drunken lout in her plan to take the city and enters into a relationship with a teenage girl who's just as crazy as she is.
-   _Empowered_: Willy Pete burns hotter than the sun and has an insatiable sexual appetite, which is a nasty combination in its own right. What's worse, he prefers unwilling partners and doesn't care about his victims' gender — anyone unlucky enough to get caught is fair game. Oh, and he prefers to rape them through the _eye socket_ because the skull is one of the few parts of the body that isn't incinerated too quickly. Needless to say, he's meant to be the most insane and irredeemably evil character in the setting.
-   John Constantine from _Hellblazer_ is the Anti-Hero of his comic, but he does dodgy things constantly, gets his friends and lovers killed, summons demons all the time, and uses his bisexuality to seduce male enemies, driving one to suicide.
-   _Hitman (1993)_: Bueno Excellente in the original series had the main aspect of his character being that he'd rape men and have it played for laughs. It was made apparent that he isn't picky when it came to gender in _All-Star Section 8_, where he hooks up with a female mass of sentient organs named Guts, though it isn't addressed whether there were any female victims of his rapes.
-   Lois in _Love and Rockets_. Not as evil as many of the examples here, given the Slice of Life nature of the canon, but definitely depraved and unsympathetic.
-   _Preacher_: T.C., Jesus De Sade, and others (the first two being depraved omnisexuals).
-   Rawlins from _The Punisher MAX_ is a truly vile backstabbing manipulative coward, who enjoys sexually dominating people of either gender.
-   _Raptors_: Camilla. While she has a romantic relationship with Drago and is shown having seduced another man before murdering him, she also claims Vicky Lenore for herself as her "plaything" and has no problem sharing her on the bed with him. Drago, on the other hand, seems to be straight, however, since he only is seen having relationships with women.
-   Junior of _Secret Six_ mentions having "forced relations" with both women and men. Plus Junior's Freudian Excuse of being sexually abused by her father, Ragdoll Sr., which caused her to mutilate her own body to its current state. This is almost certainly not supposed to reflect negatively on bisexuals since the team contains another anti-heroic lesbian Scandal and the bisexual Jeanette, per Word of God, Catman.
-   _Spider-Man_: The minor villains Scorpia (the Distaff Counterpart of Scorpion, himself Ambiguously Bi) and Joystick.
-   In Van Hamme and Rosinski's fantasy comic _Thorgal_, one of Thorgal's worst enemies, Kriss de Valnor, appears to be bisexual after quite a long time, as she openly flirts with Aaricia, and grabs her breasts, while taking a bath with her in the absence of Thorgal, though she knows that Aaricia hates her guts. She later enjoys a more loving relationship with Princess Hildebrun.
-   _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_: In the comic Cybertronians are noted to have a homonormative society with most prominent romantic relationships happening between men but ultimately gender doesn't seem to matter to them. Getaway's manipulative nature is highlighted by his courting of Tailgate with his actions referred to as grooming and predatory. That said, Getaway's ultimate plot is to manipulate Tailgate into attacking Megatron and become a martyr and though he flirts with male and female bots he never entertains any serious romantic attachment.
-   _The Unfunnies_:
    -   Troy Hicks sexually exploits Birdseed Betty, and it's indicated he enjoys child pornography regardless of gender. To add, the genders of the children he raped and murdered are unspecified.
    -   Jungle Jim also sexually exploits Betty, and tries to convince her to join him in molesting her own children, a boy and a girl.
-   _Wanted_: The original Killer mostly has sex with women, but each year gets some male prostitutes when he's bored, to renew his taste for them.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   During the early Chris Claremont run of _X-Men_, the team is sucked into Hell or a Dante's Inferno replica. They meet the demon/judge Minos, who is a sleazy piece of work. Minos immediately hits on Storm. And then Nightcrawler. His response — "this is hell — everything goes!". So in one shot, homosexuality/bisexuality is associated with the evil and the damned.
    -   Zig-Zagged with Mystique. While she is undoubtedly a villain, her relationships with Destiny and others are used to humanize her. However, she frequently uses her Voluntary Shapeshifting to perform Bed Tricks on people, once threatened to rape X23 in _Wolverines_, and sexually harassed a minor in the _Worst X-Man Ever_ miniseries.
    -   Briar Raleigh, who is in a fairly steady relationship with Magneto, sees nothing wrong with being turned on by his daughter, commenting that "we all have our kinks" when called out on it.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Dragon Ball Z_ fanfiction _Honor Trip_, Ratsura plays this trope straight as an arrow, though he himself is not straight in the least.
-   _Heirverse_: Aizen, a well-known player who sleeps with everyone until falling for Gin, cheats on him with Momo, attempts under Jac's influence to rape Gin, coerces Orihime into having a kid for Gin, and rapes Ulq regularly.
-   In _The Prayer Warriors_, because the author doesn't approve of homosexuality, in "Battle With the Witches", Harry, Ginny and, in contrast to the author's statements, Dumbledore. In one of the author's notes, this is specifically to spite his own brother, who is apparently bisexual.
-   Percy and Luke in _Sinners_, but it's a complex case. On the one hand, they are both clearly bisexual, and their morals leave something to be desired. Luke, in particular, is presented as a more sympathetic variation on The Vamp, in reference to his occasional role as a Honey Trap in the original books, and implies he's slept with several of his allies and proteges. However, as the story unfolds, they are both made likable by the narrative, particularly when seen with their family, friends, or each other. Their bisexuality is not the direct cause of their darker actions, but Percy is at least in part motivated by his love for Luke, so it's unclear if they fall under this trope.
-   In _Supergirl_ fic _Hellsister Trilogy_, villain Satan Girl isn't picky. Like, at all.
    
    She could explore pleasures of the body that Kara never would have dared to, satisfy lusts that the blonde beast never even knew she had. She could force herself upon any suitor, male or female or whatever, and destroy them after their job was done.
    
-   In _My Immortal_, Snap and Loopin stalk Enoby around, try to rape her boyfriends and had sex with Willow's corpse, while being a couple. In a fic where pretty much everything with a penis is bisexual, they are notable for being uncomfortably close to the depraved bisexual stereotype, being pedophiles and necrophiles.
-   A very odd form in the _MRA Trilogy_. Femnists are often bisexual and evil, but several of the MRA agents are bisexual men who "tame their urges in order to not objectify fellow men". Though some of said agents turn out to be The Mole.
-   _Ranma Saotome, Chi Master_ has Qiáng Wang, a triad leader who "helps himself" to the bodies of his subordinates, male or female, with or without their consent.
-   Reaper in the _Overwatch_ Fanfic _Break My Heart, Break Your Heart_. Back when he was Gabriel Reyes, he had passionate relationships with both Soldier: 76 and Mercy at various times. In the present, as Reaper, his cellular degradation has rendered him so Ax-Crazy that whether he wants to horribly murder Mercy, win her back, or first one, then the other varies from chapter to chapter. His feelings toward Jack are quite a bit more toward the "murder" end of that scale.
-   One _Zoids: New Century_ fanfic turns Jamie of all people in one of these. Warning: NSFW! \[1\]
-   Violet Kincaid from _Roman's Empire_ downplays it. She is a ruthless mob boss and a textbook example of The Sociopath. She’s a violent sadist who likes torturing and fighting people and the only reason she doesn’t do it more often is pragmatism. She’s also a shameless flirt who seems to have no sense of boundaries and is implied to have had many sexual partners. However, her major sociopathic behaviors have nothing to do with her bisexuality. Her promiscuity isn’t an indicator of evil; it’s mostly a shock to some characters because she’s in her fifties at the beginning of the story. And if anything, her instances of sexual harassment are her least harmful offenses.
-   The male Smurfs of the Mirror Universe in the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Smurfed Behind: The Other Side Of The Mirror", given that there is still only one adult female Smurf that's physically their age if not chronologically (there's also a Sassette and a Nanny Smurf), and that its Smurfette is married to Papa Smurf.
-   Gray Smurfette and Gray Wonder in the _Hero: The Guardian Smurf_ adaptation of "The Smurf Menace" are both married to Gray Hero, and even go so far as to try forcing themselves on normal Smurfette and normal Wonder when the normal Smurfs are held captive by the Gray Smurfs.
-   In _Amazing Fantasy_, Himiko Toga doesn't care about whether her crush is a boy or a girl, only how much and how frequently they're bleeding.
-   Satan Girl from _Hellsister Trilogy_ beds whatever she wants to bed, and due to her nature as a being spawned from dark emotions, she doesn't care for pesky things like consent or willingness, either.
    
    She could explore pleasures of the body that Kara never would have dared to, satisfy lusts that the blonde beast never even knew she had.  
    She could force herself upon any suitor, male or female or whatever, and destroy them after their job was done. Or perhaps just maim them, so that they could never again do such a job for anyone else. Satan Girl smiled. Now that was being imaginative...
    
-   _Son of Sparda D×D_:
    -   Averted with Issei. Thanks to Kiba confessing his love to him publically, the entire school is convinced that neither men nor women are safe from his perversion.
    -   Played straight with Nevan. She's completely unruly and electrocutes the other Devil Arms for no reason beyond her amusement and she's apparently slept around with several men and women while looking for Dante, not to mention her advances towards Issei manage to make him very uncomfortable.
-   A major villain in _Swordsmen_ is Marshall Russell, who enjoys seducing very young girls (young enough for it to dip into paedophilia). He's mainly involved with fourteen-year-old Chiyoko, but he's not above forcing young boys — he's actually introduced as creepily interested in Kenshin who looks fifteen years old, praising his youthful looks and outright attempting to molest him after drinking too much.
-   _Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse_ plays this for laughs with Casanova Wannabe "The Reefster", who responds to learning that Harumi is actually a boy after hitting on him by shrugging and saying he likes Pretty Boys too as opposed to being squicked out. As Harumi has no interest in guys, the fishman's continued flirtations only make him more annoying, especially when he then moves on to hitting on Harumi's girlfriend Miriam. Then he calls her a Category Traitor for refusing to dump Harumi to hook up with him.
-   _War of Remnant: A RWBY Anthology_:
    -   Ronald Atwood was a serial child molester of Faunus children. Both boys and girls were among his victims, two of which being Blake's childhood friends Alessandro and Ilia.
    -   The unnamed Warrior in _Volume 6_. She is the vicious leader of a band of marauders who occasionally takes whoever catches her eye as "bedmates", eventually killing them to add to her throne of bones.
-   Scourge of _Prison Island Break_ will do anyone, regardless of age, gender or consent. His victims include little kids, Rouge, Shadow, Sonic and Silver. Basically, if it has a pulse, he'll do it.

    Films — Animated 

-   Scar of _The Lion King (1994)_ is seen by many fans as coded Ambiguously Gay thanks to his rather effeminate mannerisms and lack of a mate. However, a deleted scene shows him choosing Nala to be his queen and get rather excited at the thought of making "little Scars" with her.
-   _Sausage Party_: Douche is extremely eager to be used, analogous to sex, by human female Camille, and forces himself into Darren to control his body, saying "A hole's a hole!" Downplayed, however, in that there are a handful of other characters whose more fluid sexuality is depicted as normal, as seen in the infamous food orgy at the end.

    Jokes 

-   The dad in this Parental Incest joke: a girl asks her dad if she can get a tattoo for Christmas. He agrees, so long as she gives him a blowjob. She reluctantly complies, but then says "Dad, your dick tastes like shit!" The dad replies "Oh, yeah, your brother wanted a computer."
-   Two friends meet, and one of them acts unusually shy. The second one asks: "What's the matter?" "Me and my girlfriend were on a date, and the maniac attacked us..." "Was it a sexual offender?" "Bisexual offender, to be precise."

    Music 

-   The 1990s Swedish camp/kitsch Eurodance group Army of Lovers was basically all about this trope.
-   The protagonist of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' rendition of "Stagger Lee".
-   Lady Gaga's persona in the _Telephone_ series.
-   Discussed in Hayley Kiyoko's song "Gravel to Tempo". It's one of the many insecurities prompted by the narrator's Internalized Categorism\-she feels predatory and like a betrayer for crushing on straight girls.
    
    I don't feel adequate, thinking I'm a monster in disguise....
    
-   Eminem: "
    
    -   "Stan". From the album (The Marshall Mathers LP), Eminem gives us the song "Stan" about a yandere stalker's descent into madness when he thinks Slim (the star he's yandere for) is rejecting him by not sending him letters. He states in the letter that he thinks he and Slim should be together. He ends up killing himself and his girlfriend who's pregnant with their child. Turns out Slim gets them _after_ Stan kills himself and his girlfriend.
    -   In his _Relapse_ album, Eminem takes his strangely accented incarnation of the Slim Shady character into further depths of depravity by turning him into a bisexual murderer and seducer of men, playing with Eminem's reputation for making homophobic comments in his raps, and the LGBT Fanbase Periphery Demographic he acquired despite this.
    
    That's my sector, homosexual dissector  
    Come again, rewind selector  
    I said, nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector  
    So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya  
    Hannibal Lecter in the guy section, I bet ya  
    I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya  
    They say once bitten then twice shy, well lie next to the guy  
    With nine ecstasy pills and five extra  
    Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yes sir
    
-   Genesis: The narrator of "Jesus, He Knows Me", which lampoons the scandals that affected televangelists.
    
    I believe in the family  
    With my ever-loving wife beside me  
    But she don't know about my girlfriend  
    Or the man I met last night
    
-   AC/DC: "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" is about a hitman who's implied to sleep with his clients, both men and women.
    
    For a fee, I'm happy to be, your backdoor man!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    

    Myths & Religion 

-   Older Than Feudalism:
    -   The ancient Greek myth of Zephyrus, who was married to his sister, but was madly in love with the young Spartan Hyacinth. However, Apollo also loved Hyacinth, and when he chose Apollo over Zephyrus, Zephyrus went crazy and cracked Hyacinth's skull open with a flying discus.
    -   Almost every male god in Greek Mythology shows some signs of depravity, and most of them were bisexual. The goat-god Pan might be the single best example. He's described as being so violent that the Greeks were afraid of waking him up in Arcadia. And nearly every story with Pan involves him trying to have sex with a nymph or a young shepherd boy.
-   Loki from Norse Mythology is, among other things, Fenris's father and Sleipnir's mother, thanks to the power of shapeshifting, allowing him to seduce a jotun's horse, and a conversation between Loki and Odin implies that Loki turned into a woman and got pregnant on more than one occasion. Loki is depraved in some ways, among them being responsible for Baldur's murder.
-   Huehuecoyotl from Aztec Mythology has male and female lovers, is a Shapeshifter, and often changes gender and species. While friendly toward humans, he's also petty and amoral at times and has been known to case war among mortals for no other reason than boredom.
-   Many Trickster deities are sexually flexible both in preference and equipment. Case in point: Baron Samedi.
-   Lilith had sex with both Adam and Eve, according to one passage in Jewish literature that describes her as "the Woman of Harlotry."
-   In _The Bible_ proper, from the Book of Judges, some men of Gibeah ganged up on an old man's house, desiring to "know" the Levite man whom he had taken in as a guest. Instead, the Levite gave them his concubine, whom they had abused and raped all night, which resulted in her death.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Orlando Jordan had this gimmick in TNA. When his valet, Brittany, became a wrestler following his departure, she also proved to be an example, although it wasn't as central to her gimmick. Jordan molested nearly everyone within reach and all but publicly masturbated when the objects of his desire were too far away. Brittany was driven evil by rejection and happened to be rejected by both sexes.
-   Japanese comedy wrestlers like Otoko Sakari, Danshiko Dino, and Michael Nakazawa have this gimmick, augmented by their custom to wrestle in thongs.

    Radio 

-   Defied in _Old Harry's Game_. Thomas Crimp is perfectly willing to shag cartoon characters and mannequins, but he draws the line at having sex with other men.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Both played straight and inverted in the 3rd Edition. Malcanthet, the Demon Queen of Succubi, is the patron of lust and illicit sex, and she seduces both males and females. On the other hand, her enemy, Queen Morwel of the Eladrins, is the patron of sex between lovers and sensual energy turned toward positive ends, and she's bisexual _and_ polyamorous.
    -   Also played straight with another demon lord — Graz'zt, the Dark Prince, who keeps "pleasure slaves" of both genders.
    -   King Kaius of _Eberron_ is said to keep a harem of both women and men, he's really a vampire and feeds off of them. Subverted in that he's actually a pretty nice guy. Well... Y'know. For a vampire, anyway.
    -   Strahd von Zarovich, Darklord of Barovia from _Ravenloft_, has no issues attempting to seduce Player Characters regardless of gender, and _Curse of Strahd_ shows that he has a male consort. This was implied pretty heavily in the original module but made much more obvious in the re-issuing of the adventure for 5th edition.
-   _Exalted_ had the horrific Villain with Good Publicity First Age Solar Desus, a Fake Ultimate Hero who, as noted on the latter page, committed horrific acts of physical, mental, and sexual abuse on a routine basis against anyone unlucky enough to be in his path. He was also a Domestic Abuser who, among other things, would routinely force his Lunar wife Lilith to engage in Gender Bending to "spice up" their sex life, something she took no pleasure in even when he wasn't engaging in the sort of hardcore sadism only a First Age Solar can dream up.
-   The antics continue in the Pathfinder Tabletop Roleplaying Game with the Demon Lord Socothbenoth, who is the Lord of Perversion. He covers everything from false seduction to rape of both men _and_ women of all ages to animals!
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: Slaanesh, chaos god(dess) of hedonism. A violent, omnisexual rapist leading legions of daemons and cultists who are also violent rapists and tend not to care about gender much. A fair portion of the Dark Eldar, an army of torturous slave-driving pirates, also tend to fall into Depraved Bisexual territory.

    Theater 

-   Lord Voldemort in _A Very Potter Musical_ seems to have a pretty enthusiastic sex life with Bellatrix, but is heavily, _heavily_ implied to like Quirrell as more than just a friend. In fact, the two even adopt a daughter at the end of _A Very Potter Senior Year_.

    Visual Novels 

-   Every character in _The Arcana_ is bisexual but of the depraved ones Count Lucio stands out. It is implied that he has quite a lively sex life with men and women of the palace. And he has killed countless people by inflicting them with the Red Plague. Though he is redeemable in his route.
-   _Danganronpa_:
    -   Heavily hinted with Junko Enoshima. This takes a dark turn when you realize that sex is likely one of her methods of manipulation. It's clear that she was loved by Mikan and used and manipulated her with that love, and she was engaged in an incestuous Masochism Tango with her own twin sister. _Danganronpa Zero_ reveals she had a boyfriend who she genuinely loved… meaning the despair she would get from killing him would be extra exhilarating to her.
    -   Mikan and Nagito are both Ax-Crazy, completely obsessed with Junko, and willing to kill people in her name. Both also show attraction to Hajime Hinata at some point.
    -   Played for Laughs with Teruteru, who's a Lovable Sex Maniac that tries to trick Sonia into going down on him at the start of _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_, and sexually harasses all the girls as well as the Manly Man Nekomaru.
-   Lau in _Family Project_ is _viewed_ this way, and it's not entirely inaccurate. He set up the whole situation with Chunhua in order to set off a gang war that destroyed the Taiwan and Shangai mafia, leaving a power gap for him to move into. And also spread the rumor his sister was engaged to Tsukasa, a dangerous situation for him, in order to improve his reputation. Chinese mafia marrying a Japanese into the family is a good business idea. He really did intend to go through with that one though. In reality, he's not so much a bad guy as he is very bad with people and lonely.
-   _Hatoful Boyfriend_'s main villain, Dr. Iwamine Shuu, reveals his motivation for exterminating humanity in the "Bad Boys' Love" route, and it's a promise to his unrequited crush Dr. Ryuuji Kawara, Ryouta's father, that went horribly, horribly wrong. Shuu is also a love interest for the female player character, and admits to really caring about her in the extended ending to his route after he's severed her head, gotten intimate with her internal organs, and possibly turned her brain into a cyborg, and is about to be killed by the police for various other crimes like experimenting on and murdering other students.
-   Played with in _Liar Liar_. Villain Protagonist Yukari is a fifteen-year-old serial killer who has killed everyone she's been with since elementary however her sexuality isn't played up. She just happens to be Ax-Crazy and bisexual. She kills her cheating ex-boyfriend in the first game and in the second game she's dating Miho who she kills at the end, for killing her little sister. Almost _everyone_ is some level of Ax-Crazy, no matter their sexuality.
-   _School Days_:
    -   Depending on the route the player picks, Makoto is a Jerkass who not only uses force through sexual means on girls his age, their mothers, and their young sisters, and goes through them like tissue paper, he also shows an attraction to Yuuki in _Cross Days_.
    -   Taisuke is heavily implied to rape his crush Kotonoha in the anime, which causes the poor girl to go mad from it and in the OVA he takes on an effeminate appearance when offering a huge heart-shaped valentine chocolate to Makoto while blushing and acting bashful which creeps Makoto right out.

    Web Animation 

-   While Stolas' (see below) attitude is (darkly) Played for Laughs, it's played dead serious over in _Hazbin Hotel_ with overlord pimp Valentino. He's confirmed as pansexual, and appears in the music video "Addict" with A Lady on Each Arm. He’s also in an on-again-off-again relationship with fellow overlord Vox and regularly makes Angel do sexual favors for him. He’s shown to be violent and abusive towards both men, particularly Angel, who it’s implied he’s raped on more than one occasion.
-   Lucius the Eternal from _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_. Being the Champion of Slaanesh justifies his crazed actions. Not so much for his girly voice and mannerisms.
-   The _Prostitute Mickey_ series has Mickey Mouse's main client Joe, who makes advances towards Mickey even when he isn't servicing him to make ends meet and in one short mentions that he has to pay child support, which implies that he has had sex with a woman at least once.

    Webcomics 

-   _The Bedfellows_: Sheen is often seen sleeping with random women, and can also be seen with men. He is also in an (abusive) relationship with Fatigue.
-   Several in T. Campbell's comics:
    -   Helena Dionysus from _Divalicious_
    -   Tatanya from _Rip And Teri_
    -   Keith Feddyg from _Fans!_, especially after he joins the Order and starts killing people instead of just preying on them.
        -   Alisin's Backstory has some moments, too, especially since she's partially responsible for Feddyg's descent into madness.
        -   Boxed Crook Fitz, very much a pervert and habitual perpetrator of Grand Theft Me, responded to Tim and Zaha's mock-flirting with an enthusiastic "one Fitz fits all!"—T's writing style leads one to assume he's serious, at least about "fitting all" until stated otherwise.
    -   Cyndi from _Penny and Aggie_, Manipulative Bastard, and the character author T Campbell most despises and fears, at first just claims to be putting on shows and leading girls on, but eventually falls for Sara-as-Lady-Macbeth.
-   Danny of _Chess Piece_, who has hit on his cousin Elliot on his _wedding day_. (Danny's, not Elliot's, that is.)
-   Possibly Mistress Butterfly from _Collar 6_, also know as The Sadist From Hell. She has at least one confirmed relationship with a man, but she's tortured women on screen. She's also the closest thing the comic has to a Big Bad so far. This is _not_ a case of Bondage Is Bad since the other characters in the comic are in consensual BDSM relationships, Butterfly is evil because she uses force, nor is it a case of same-sex attraction being portrayed as bad since the main characters are all in a poly lesbian relationship.
-   Joel from _Concession_ has slept with/seduced several of the other characters, either to further his plans or for his own amusement. He also once used his psychic powers to make a preteen child rape his co-worker Artie.
-   Szark Sturz and Celesto Morgan from _Dominic Deegan_. Puzzlingly, using the phrase "filthy bisexuals" is a minor villain's Kick the Dog moment. Szark "comes out" as gay shortly after his Heel–Face Turn. This seems only to show how much he's attracted to Dominic and make gay jokes.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   Damara Megido. All Trolls are bisexual, she just adds the "depraved" part by having almost everything she says to another troll be crude sexual come-ons in badly-translated Japanese, and willingly working for the universe-eating Big Bad. How much of it is sincere and how much of it is her taking advantage of the language barrier to mess with people is unknown.
    -   Vriska seems to think of her ancestor Marquise Spinneret Mindfang in this way, thinking of it as admirable. Vriska's fanfic has Mindfang using her psionic powers to force a female to have sex with her in front of the fictim's lover while leaving just enough free will to question whether she actually wants to or not. The real Mindfang was actually not so ruthless or depraved, but did still engage in some morally grey behavior while working for the Big Bad.
-   In _Jack_ Drip, the incarnation of the sin of lust prefers to rape women, but he's not picky.
-   _Keychain of Creation_:
    -   The scythe-wielding Fae who introduced himself by kissing every member of the main party in turn.
    -   Merena is not actively malicious but flatly doesn't care if her bed-bouncing ways wreck the homes and lives of the people she seduces.
-   Sisters, Elsa and Rain Vilehelm from _The Lounge_.
-   Star in _Metanoia_ has explicitly stated that he'll have sex with anything that moves, even though he prefers men.
-   The title character from _Niels_ is a mob boss and borderline sociopath, only having a spare few people he genuinely trusts and cares about. Two of these people are the young married couple he's in a committed three-way relationship with (the husband is also one of his top enforcers). Although even this doesn't stop him from flirting with the federal agent assigned to keep tabs on him.
-   The Mistress from _Oglaf_ appears to be bisexual, having taken both male and female slaves. Additionally, she seems to get off on humiliating, torturing, and sometimes _murdering_ her partners.
-   Sabine in _The Order of the Stick_, which is to be expected given that she's a succubus.
-   _The Search For Henry Jekyll_: Edward Hyde is both depraved and bisexual, but something of a variety on the trope, given that he's bisexual because Henry Jekyll is, not because of his depravity.
-   Mrs. Shibata of _Sexy Losers_ regularly attempts to seduce her own son. This stopped for a while when she stole his girlfriend and resumed when she accidentally caused the girl to die from exhaustion brought on by excessive sex.
-   The _Walkyverse_'s Mike Warner fucked your mom _and_ your dad. During _Shortpacked!_ he slept with Amber and Ethan at the same time just to mess with their heads and get them to fight in jealousy.

    Web Original 

-   Ask That Guy. In his own words:
    
    Anything I would do to a woman, I would do to a man as well. \[...\] I would penetrate a man just like I would penetrate a woman. That's why bisexual people are the only real equal opportunists out there.
    
    -   While we're on Mr. Walker here: Link, from Video Game Confessions.
    -   For the third DVD promo, Doug himself played a shirtless, psychotic bisexual who was torturing a guy with a knife. Not necessary, but very much appreciated. The persona came back in a ConBravo interview, where he groped the interviewer and ended up riding him like a pony, he'd had years of experiences in sexing people up, he'd slept with both James and his wife, he was non-exclusively married to Benzaie, and he'd ruined JewWario's balls through getting teabagged.
    -   Critic every now and then, most notably in the second episode of _Pop Quiz Hotshot_, where his Friendless Background and Sanity Slippage combine into kidnapping people to be his friends, and very much enjoying hitting on them (and General Anesthetic) as well.
-   Ryuk in _Death Note: The Abridged Series (kpts4tv)_. He was molesting Light and later he offers to join Misa when she goes to bed naked.
-   _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_:
    -   Jan Valentine mentions that addition to Integra, he was going to skull-fuck all of the old guys in the meeting and the random soldier ghoul that happened to be next to him.
    -   Alucard. According to him: "There's no one alive can understand my sexual preference." He has also been shown to become aroused by Integra Hellsing, Seras Victoria, and Alexander Anderson.
-   Naruto from _Naruto: The Abridged Comedy Fandub Spoof Series Show_.
-   Princess Molestia.
    -   Unusually for this trope, she's portrayed as being a genuinely nice and kind pony, underneath the questionable consent mechanics, undiscriminating tastes, and complete lack of impulse control. Given that she's gone after her own sister and tried to arrange a foursome with her student, her student's freshly married brother, and his wife, "depraved" is probably still the right word.
    -   Discorded Dr. Whooves, The Master, Scootaloo the Sadist, and Lil' Miss Rarity all play the trope _far_ more directly and disturbingly.
-   In the Buzzfeed video Questions Gay People Have For Bisexual People, one of the questions asked in apparent seriousness is "Don't you think maybe you're just selfish?"
-   _SF Debris_: Parody Janeway has had either explicit or implied interest in a staggering number of characters. Male: her fiance Mark, her Harry Kim-shaped strap-on that may or may not actually be Harry Kim, Tom Paris (although they were both giant newts at the time), the inspector from Counterpoint, Chakotay, Captain Adama from _Battlestar Galactica (1978)_. Female: Torres, Seven of Nine, and _herself_. As for the depravity, anyone who offers drugs and cigarettes to small children they are training up to be loyal minions, breeds a "rape gorilla", and has created hives of flying tarantulas with a taste for ocular jelly probably has enough depravity to supply entire legions of demented Roman emperors.
-   Spoony's Spooning personality will drug and rape man and woman both. To date, his conquests include: The Nostalgia Chick, That Chick With The Goggles, Benzaie, The Nostalgia Critic, Angry Joe, Bennett The Sage, and Lord Kat. With sliced pineapples.
-   _Survival of the Fittest_:
    -   Melina Frost in version three. She led the all woman group named the Poison Angels in an attempt to kill all the men on the island. She was about as Ax-Crazy as it got. One of the best examples of her insanity is when she rapes Beth Vanallen. With a _vase_.
    -   From SOTF-TV, Marvia Jones. Her first appearance on the island? Getting high, drugging Nate Chauncey, and taking advantage of her, culminating in beating her up and taking her things. She then proceeded to team up with Harold Smythe, who was probably among the most Ax-Crazy of the TV characters.
-   Zeus and Dionysus in _Thalia's Musings_, in contrast with Apollo.
-   Vivian from Felarya is well-known for using seduction magic on smaller humanoids, both male and female. Being a 70-foot naga and a predator, she then proceeds to eat the people she seduces. Calling her "depraved" though seems to be a tad harsh though, a girl has to eat after all...
-   Whateley Universe:
    -   Don Sebastiano, who used both Cavalier and Skybolt as sex slaves and personal puppets while they were bewitched by Hekate. Since his main turn on is humiliating his sex partners, this was actually insufficiently depraved for his tastes, being far too easy a conquest — but he kept at it for a full year anyway, until they escaped from Hekate's power and got their revenge on him.
    -   Having been a Satisfied Street Rat before being recruited by the CIA, Sahar acted as a Fille Fatale in her first year at Whateley Academy, seducing any and all ESPers among the student body which she could in order to use her ability to copy their knacks (which requires a _very_ intimate acquaintance with the target). She only stopped when she fell in love with one of her targets, Zenith, leading her to a Heel Realization that caused her to panic and break off the relationship for Zoe's sake. Eventually, she reunited with Zenith, and set about making amends to the others she'd hurt.
-   The Pharaoh from _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_.
    
    **Yugi:** You're so depraved  
    **Yami:** At least I'm not deprived. Of sex.
    
-   _Ranma ½ Abridged_: Kuno Tatewaki has his natural personality from the anime driven up to its logical conclusion. Upon learning Ranma and Akane are engaged, his only concern is whether they wouldn't be opposed to a ménage à trois.
    
    **Kunō:** That's French for three-way.
    

    Western Animation 

-   Roger Smith from _American Dad!_ is a "fey pansexual", a total sociopath, and (thankfully offscreen) rapist who's been sexually inappropriate with every member of the family at least once over the course of the series.
-   _Archer_:
    -   Pam Poovey and Cheryl Tunt. The former is openly bisexual and has been shown to be willing to go to unethical lengths for sex. The latter is batshit crazy and _really_ enjoys getting beaten, humiliated, and choked, and although she usually prefers men, she's been known to provoke women if she thinks they'll give her a good beating.
    -   Outside of the main cast, Lucas Troy claims to be _really_ good at getting ladies, but has a Deathbed Confession to having raped Archer.
-   In the _Daria_ movie _Is It Fall Yet?_, Jane goes to an art commune for the summer. The only girl who befriends her later gets her drunk and tries to seduce her, then sleeps with the pompous, famous artist who runs the commune, presumably in hopes of getting an in with gallery owners.
-   Captain Hero _Drawn Together_ is a perverted fratbro who sexually depraved and sleeps with everyone (men, women, Ling-Ling, corpses).
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Stewie. Yeah, he's a toddler, but he's definitely depraved and has shown attraction to several people of both genders such as Brian, who's the family dog, and his own mother.
    -   Meg spends her free time trying to get a boyfriend (this even includes her falling for Brian when he was nice to her) and in episodes like "Stew-Roids" and "Dial Meg For Murder", she appears to exhibit attraction toward Connie, a girl who constantly bullies her. Some episodes depict her being both emotionally fragile and disturbed, derived from desperation for love and attention. "Dial Meg For Murder" implied she'd been on both ends of multiple Prison Rape situations, in a women's correctional institution.
    -   One-shot villainess Sonja seduces and takes advantage of Quagmire and frequently visits a porn site involving Latinas. The key word is _Latinas_, not Latin**o**s.
    -   Peter Griffin **in spades**. He's married to Lois and definitely interested in women (including one instance where he wanted to have sex with a female rat) but lusts after men usually every other episode (he was in an abusive sexual relationship with a male bull who had raped him). There are even unfortunate implications that he's sexually attracted to minors (he has a crush on Connie D'Amico and once told Lois that he shouldn't nag him about being a kids' show host as he "...can have any 3-year-old \[he\] wants.") "Fresh Heir" also implies he'll go as far as incest and ephebophilia, as it's heavily implied he wanted to do more than just marry his son Chris for his father-in-law's inheritance and occasionally has shown interest in his daughter Meg whom he also verbally and physically abuses (one instance had him requesting Meg kiss him on the lips). He also occasionally checks out young boys (including telling a kid he had a "sweet ass"), hinted at being turned on when he and Quagmire got naked and had to kiss and spooned with Quagmire when they were cuddling in bed together with Peter pulling down Quagmire's boxers, was not entirely weirded out by Ryan Reynolds flirting with him, roleplayed Dawson from _Dawson's Creek_ to Carter (playing a girl) and tried to kiss him while hinting he wanted to have sex with him (explaining he was doing so because that's Dawson's character), willingly slept with Bill Clinton, responding to Christian Bale's statement of "We're done professionally" with an excited "Are you asking me out on a date?", and ordering Chris to take Lois' place while she is away. Chris, playing Lois, sits next to Peter and compliments his muscles. Peter plays along and promises obscene sex for that night. He's also an Extreme Omnisexual with his attraction to a female rat and he had sex with a "Surfin' Bird" record.
-   Murdoc Niccals, if his drunken ramblings can be trusted.
-   _Moral Orel_:
    -   Daniel Stopframe is willing to seduce and impregnate the wife of Clay Puppington, the man he is obsessed with, just to get close to him, only to spurn her casually afterward. He also prays to Satan in order to get who he wants and shows a willingness to kill the guy's son as a virgin sacrifice as part of a Satanic ritual to get the guy to love him (luckily, his scheme gets shot down when he finds out that the Satanists of Moralton aren't down with that).
    -   Clay himself appears to only love attention, loving anyone who will show him any amount of it, regardless of who he will hurt in the process. He's had extramarital affairs with both Coach Stopframe and Miss Censordoll. It's this, combined with his abusive nature towards Orel, that causes Stopframe to ultimately reject him.
-   Ren Hoek in _Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"_. He clearly loves the ladies and will try to grab a woman's breasts at any given opportunity; yet at the same time is in a homosexual relationship with Stimpy, with whom he already shared an Ambiguously Gay abusive relationship with in the original. He's also described as "psychotic", can be very sadistic, and frequently goes on Ax-Crazy rampages.
-   _South Park_:
    -   Eric Cartman was attracted to Ben Affleck (he gave him a hand-job in one episode whilst pretending his hand is Jennifer Lopez) and Michael Jefferson; dressed as Britney Spears in one episode and makes out with a Justin Timberlake cardboard cutout; had a sexual affair with Leonardo DiCaprio whilst convinced he's a Vietnamese prostitute due to a head injury; is obsessed with and follows Kyle Broflovski around (he even went on a cross-country quest just to make him suck his balls in _Imaginationland: The Trilogy_), blew Butters in his sleep after giving him cold medicine, then tried to convince Butters to do the same to him; and asked Clyde to sleep with him once (he was actually quoting "Lady Marmalade"; you know the lyric). But he also experienced attraction toward Wendy, Stan's girlfriend; mentioned that he had a crush on a girl named Patty Nelson, and had a crush on Bebe when she started developing breasts (along with all of the male 4th graders) and along with most of the other kids had a crush on his substitute teacher Ms. Ellen.
    -   Mr. Garrison seems to exist _solely_ to defy "the norm". He was in the Transparent Closet at first, then came out as a Depraved Homosexual, then got a sex-change, _then_ became a Psycho Lesbian, then got turned back into a Depraved Homosexual male. Whatever the orientation or gender identity, Garrison is debauchary incarnate. Chef summed it up in "The Death Camp of Tolerance".
        
        **Chef:** Children, there's a big difference between gay people and _Mr. Garrison_.
        
-   _Superjail!_: Fatty is a fat perverted inmate who obsesses over making sexual advances on just about anything (except Alice, it'd seem). He's hit on his own cellmate Gary, had made creepy advances on Jared, was hinted to be a pedophile when he thought of a woodland creature as a child (intending to have sex with it) but has also shown attraction towards women.
-   Sergeant Hatred in _The Venture Brothers_. Also, a pedophile and strongly implied to have molested at least Hank.
