_"You stay alive, no matter what occurs! I will find you. No matter how long it takes, no matter how far, I will find you."_

_...Yeah, you always make me go..._

A quite common variant of The Quest, this plot has two people who have become separated by fate or circumstance, and thus cannot be together. One or both will try to search for the other, promising that they will never stop until they have reunited with their loved one.

Often, the missing person will be a lover, but sometimes this plot takes the form of a parent searching for a child, a brother for a sister, or someone searching for a lost friend. They will usually have to undergo a long journey while facing many hardships along the way before they can find the person they're looking for.

They may never find each other, or the other person may be long dead, but don't expect them to stop looking even when confronted by proof of such. Such plots usually have a message about the ability of love or friendship to endure all things.

This is the much more proactive version of I Will Wait for You, although not specifically for love interests.

If Bob wants to find his lost love, Alice, but Alice doesn't necessarily want to be found, then that crosses over into Stalking Is Love.

Compare She Will Come for Me, in which the missing person believes s/he will be found. See also Reunion Vow, Rescue Arc, and Save the Princess, which this frequently overlaps with. The protagonist of this trope is often the Determinator. Contrast situations where the words are spoken as a threat, perhaps by an Implacable Man or Liam Neeson.

After he finally accomplishes this goal he's left wondering where to go from there.
-   Discussed in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ when Shirogane and Kaguya are talking about _The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter_. Shirogane says that if he were in the emperor's position, he would have drunk the elixir of immortality rather than burn it and get Princess Kaguya back no matter how long it took.
