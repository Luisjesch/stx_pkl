_"Death cannot stop true love. It can only delay it for a little while."_

Fate may have kept them apart, the world may have frowned on their love, and conflict may have wormed itself between them, but they're finally together — too bad they had to die for it to happen.

Together in Death is when a couple is literally or metaphorically reunited in death. They might be buried together, seen together in the afterlife (most often in Heaven or a similar paradise, but _not_ always), or their corpses discovered embracing one another. It's not necessarily a romantic couple — it can just as easily be a pair of siblings, a parent and child, or a couple of True Companions.

This is a good way to show the couple's devotion to one another, even unto death; it is also a tidy way to show a (lasting) reconciliation. Often forms part of a Bittersweet Ending. Less positively, the death of a loved one can be a popular motivator for suicide, in an attempt to invoke this trope. For the inversion of this trope, see Necromantic, where devotion to a loved one drives them to bring them back from death.

-   Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man, always saw himself more as a detective than a superhero — and after his wife Sue's murder in _Identity Crisis (2004)_, it seemed The DCU was determined to make him a Butt-Monkey as well. However, he got a measure of victory by the end of _52_ — he trapped Felix Faust and the demon Neron in Doctor Fate's tower, while they thought they were tricking him. It cost him his life, but he was reunited with Sue — and it seemed they were going to spend the afterlife as Topper, instead of Nick and Nora.

When Judge Dredd and Psi-Judge Anderson find the patient on a routine check through the area and conclude that they can't take him back due to the years of radiation exposure, they turn off the unit. The couple is then reunited in the afterlife.
-   In "My Heart of Darkness", a rewrite of the _Falling in Love_ comic story, "Lesson in Love", by Jeanne Martinet (found in _Truer Than True Romance_), Nan falls in love with her teacher, Wayne Allen, but can't impress him because of her writings that deal with nuclear war, existential angst, and death. She tries to keep a straight face, but this turns From Bad to Worse. She even notices that he has a thing for Dumb Blondes like his student Marsha. But one rainy day, while Wayne is driving in the car with Nan, she discovers that he too is angsty like her, dislikes sappy stories about cherry pie, and secretly wants to die. As the car they are in purposefully swerves off the road in the path of an oncoming truck and plunges into the river, she realizes that she and Wayne will finally be together eternally in the afterlife.

Cradling Calaf's lifeless body, Liu says they will be Together in Death while Turandot remains alone forever, as punishment for her cruelty; she then stabs herself and dies, leaving a sobbing Turandot with her hands empty.

At midnight, much to Lenore's joy, Wilhelm appears on a horse to take Lenore away with him. However, Wilhelm is, in fact, dead, and their ride ends on the graveyard where Wilhelm is buried. Lenore dies of terror on Wilhelm's grave, and thus is ultimately reunited with Wilhelm.
-   "Dirge for Two Veterans" by Walt Whitman does this. A father and son fell together in the American Civil War, and were buried together in a double grave.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Lore from _Vampire: The Masquerade_ tells of a pair known only as "The Lovers".

-   _One Night Ultimate Vampire_ added "Marks" and the Cupid role to the _One Night Ultimate Werewolf_ series.

Her suicide releases his soul and those of his sailors; at the end, the souls of the Dutchman and Senta are seen ascending to Heaven together.
-   _Hamilton_: Alexander and Eliza's final singing appearances both invoke this trope.
    
    **Alexander:** My love, take your time. I'll see you on the other side.  
    \[...\]  
    **Eliza:** Oh, I can't wait to see you again. It's only a matter of time.
    
-   Attempted by Horatio at the end of _Hamlet_, but his best friend Prince Hamlet (who's dying in his arms) stops him before he can drink the rest of the poison. Which makes Horatio a lot luckier than most characters in a Shakespearian tragedy.

-   _Tosca_ throws herself over the wall of the prison after her lover Mario is killed. And in doing so, she calls the name of Scarpia, not her lover.

    Visual Novels 

-   One of the ending in Yuri Genre Visual Novel _Akai Ito_ had Kei and Sakuya replacing Yumei in being the Ohashira, after Kei was fatally wounded by Nushi and Yumei decided that she can't live without her.
-   Sora and Takeshi in _Ever17_ get trapped in HIMMEL together after Takeshi refuses to escape without her. Takeshi makes a backup of her data, leading to a Hope Spot, but ultimately no rescue comes and they drown together.
-   _Cafe Enchante_:
    -   Mikado and his girlfriend Shizuka both end up dying side by side together in Rindo's route.
    -   In Misyr's Bad Ending, Kotone was unable to leave the World of End Times when the world was collapsing and Misyr refused to leave without Kotone, claiming he was too injured to escape. The epilogue narration notes that the other characters are uncertain if they died when the world disappeared or if they are still alive but trapped in an empty world.
-   _Fate/stay night_: Saber and Shirou finally get a proper happy ending in Realta Nua's bonus ending of the Fate route. To unlock it, you have to finish all three routes, and get all five endings... but by doing so, you get what might well be the most heartwarming scene in the whole game. As she lays dying, Arturia is informed that it is absolutely impossible for her to ever see Shirou again; the afterlife is simply not designed to handle people who were born and died a thousand years apart. But if she waits for him forever, and if Shirou seeks her forever, then maybe the impossible will happen. In the end, they are reunited in Avalon.
-   In the Nemesis route of _Full Metal Daemon Muramasa_ Kageaki, having been fatally wounded in the prior battle against the silver knight, eventually collapses only to realize that he is lying on his Love Interest Kanae's lap before expiring. What he never learned however was that Kanae herself was the silver knight and she too was mortally wounded in the fight, having fullfilled her promise to him to deliver him punishment for his actions, passing on almost immediately after him.
-   One of the endings of _Saya no Uta_ has Saya and Fuminori end up like this, as Saya gets fatally wounded, causing Fuminori to kill himself. It is absolutely heartwrenching, the way that Saya ignores her wounds (with Kouji still repeatedly delivering blows as she does so) and drags herself over to Fuminori's corpse so she can embrace him before slipping away herself. Tragically, it is also the only ending where the two get to be together at all.
-   _Umineko: When They Cry_:
    -   In the second twilight's requirement of "tear\[ing\] apart the two who are close" often winds up playing around with this trope. Probably the most notable one was actually an intentional aversion where Beatrice erases Kanon's corpse particularly so he and Jessica can't be together in death. And in the process frames him for the entire thing. Or Did She?
    -   The magic ending of the series plays this effect. Battler takes Beatrice (and a gold ingot) with him, even though she thinks she won't be able to fit in the world outside Rokkenjima. When they are on the boat in the middle of the ocean, she asks him to close his eyes, kisses him... and jump into the sea with the 10kg ingot. Battler's response is to jump and drown with her, saying "I won't let you go" (in reality though, he somehow survives, and loses his memories after an accident on the land). Add this song to the scene, and you get a big fat Tear Jerker.

    Web Animation 

-   Episode 4 of _Helluva Boss_ has I.M.P. taking on a job by Loopty Goopty; a recently-deceased inventor that wanted them to kill his still-living business partner in a veiled attempt at revenge for his death.

-   _RWBY_. After defying the Gods for them refusing to revive Ozma, they punish Salem by cursing her with immortality so that she can never reunite with Ozma, but the curse will only be lifted if she learns "the meaning of life and death".

-   In the short comic _Hold Close_, a little fire spirit and a little water spirit fall in love, but they can't hold hands because the fire spirit is hurt when he touches water. Eventually, the fire spirit is scooped up by a human and put into an oil lamp. The water spirit follows him and sits with him all night, but evaporates due to the heat. Shortly after, the lamp is extinguished, killing the fire spirit. The two spirits are reunited as ghosts, and are finally able to hold hands.
-   Something of a recurring theme in Homestuck. John and Vriska, Tavros and Vriska, Karkat and Terezi in two different alternate timelines, Karkat and Nepeta, Post-Scratch Rose and Dave, and John's Dad and Rose's Mom all end up this way.
-   Parodied in _Oglaf_ here.

    -   Dorukan and Lirian in _Start of Darkness_, with the twist that rather than having gone to the afterlife, their souls are trapped in a gem in Big Bad Xykon's pocket.
        
        **Lirian:** No... not a prison. Not anymore.
        
    -   Non-romantic semi-example: Miko and her horse, Windstriker. "Semi" because only one is dead, the other is merely stuck in the Celestial Realms. When she realizes that she is going to die and doesn't even have a chance of redemption, she only asks if she'll be able to see him again. For her, that's good enough.
    -   Another non-romantic example: Roy finally gets to see his little brother again, who had been killed when one of their father's experiments with magic went awry, when he gets to the Celestial Realm after dying in his battle with Xykon. Then they play blocks together.
-   _Sam & Fuzzy_ has an unusual, non-romantic example: Mr. Blank dies when the corpse of his Only Friend Mr. Black pushes him off the side of a building, with the last we see of the pair being their bodies plummeting to Blank's death together. The unusual part is because this is a Karmic Death on the part of Mr. Blank, as he had murdered Mr. Black earlier in the arc and the corpse wouldn't have been in a position to knock him off the side otherwise.
-   The first panel of this<small>◊</small> Simulated Comic Product comic shows a young man next to his dead wife's tombstone, vowing he will use science to be re-united with her. The rest of the comic shows a montage of his scientific career, older in each panel, until the last shows the same scene as the first, with two tombstones.
-   Mandy and Grace, two minor characters in _It's Walky!_
-   _Foxes in Love_: Discussed in this strip, where Green says that if he and Blue die at the same time, he wants them to be buried together so archaeologists in the future know they loved each other... and also so he can be the big spoon forever.
-   _Unsounded_: After Vienne's burial Mathis' internal commentary notes that he couldn't at the time imagine doing anything other than crawling through the earth and resting next to her. Instead he takes their son on a suicide run through the constable's office where the construct she'd been killed over was being kept, survived, stole the construct and fled.

It returns to find its fellow ship unresponsive and sinking. It desperately sails a pattern around SCP-1522-2 to try and raise it using advanced water-pressure techniques, but does not succeed and 1522-2 sinks. It stops responding for seven hours. When approached by an SCP search-and-rescue helicopter, SCP-1522-1 lets of a single, loud, sustained blare of its foghorn in the ship version of a Big "NO!" and wills itself to fall apart and sink next to SCP-1522-2. Their remains were salvaged by the SCP Foundation and their rusting hulls now sit together on a beach in Svalbard.

-   He doesn't manage it (nope, his actual ending manages to be _worse_), but Donnie DuPre from _Demo Reel_ might be one of the few characters who wants to die so he can be with his dead mom rather than a dead partner. And while he dies alone, at least Tacoma, Quinn, Rebecca and Carl fade away into nothing together.
-   In The Nostalgia Critic's _Christmas Story II_ behind the scenes, Doug and Tamara say that during the couch scene, Hyper wanted to slit her and Critic's throats to preserve the moment.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Spider-Man: The Animated Series,_ of all things, Mysterio's lover is an actress who was disfigured. She kidnaps Mary Jane for a body-swap, but Mysterio's body-switching machine turns out to not actually work - and never had. He'd been trying to give her hope. When she discovers this, she activates the Self-Destruct Mechanism because she'd rather die than not be beautiful. Spider-Man urges Mysterio to run, but Mysterio chooses to stay behind and die with her. No, they don't get better. In fact, though viewers still don't get the word "dead," there were none of the expected attempts to sweep it under the rug or make it Only Mostly Dead — it even gets referenced later on.
-   The episode "Ghost Princess" in _Adventure Time_ features the soul of a dead princess who is Barred from the Afterlife until she can remember how she died, which is inconvenient because ghosts can't remember who they were in life. She goes on a date with another ghost who seems familiar to her, and then Finn and Jake realize he was the person who killed her. This causes her to remember that the two were Star-Crossed Lovers on opposite sides of a war and he accidentally killed her. She forgives him for it, but now is being drawn towards the afterlife away from her lover who has yet to remember his own death. Then Jake realizes he _witnessed_ the lover's death: mad with guilt over killing his love, he overate and ended up exploding in a convenience store. The lover remembers, and the couple proceed to the afterlife together.
    -   This is also the driving plot in "Together Again" from the follow up miniseries, _Adventure Time: Distant Lands_. The episode takes place far past the end of the series, where Jake has been dead a long time; and starts with Finn arriving in the deadworlds, where his reaction to his own death is elation at being able to reunite (and eventually reincarnate with) Jake. Other characters are also shown enjoying the afterlife, with Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig having settled down on one Dead World while Finn and Jake's Family (Margaret, Joshua, and Jermaine) share a house in another.
-   In the _American Dad!_ episode "May the Best Stan Win," Francine wants to be buried with Stan, but he apparently signed an agreement with the CIA to have his body made into a cyborg. Things get weird when cyborg!Stan comes from the future, regretting his decision. The episode ends with a Distant Finale showing that Stan changes the future and is buried with her after all.
-   In just one of the many Tear Jerker moments of _The Animals of Farthing Wood_, this happens to the charming old hedgehog couple as they're crossing the motorway.

-   On _Gargoyles,_ the Emir uses magic to capture Anubis and tries to force him to resurrect his young son, who died in a car accident.
