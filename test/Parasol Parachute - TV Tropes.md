_"The sun shines on this Parasol of mine. Where I walk, enemies balk, and I float gently down..."_

A Sub-Trope of Improvised Parachute and Puny Parachute, in many cartoons and video games, an umbrella or parasol can be used as an improvised parachute, allowing someone who opens it in midair to float safely down to the ground.

Of course, the umbrella or parasol may fail, turning inside-out and sending the unfortunate user plummeting to the earth below. Don't Try This at Home, especially not off the roof.

_MythBusters_ tested this, alongside other forms of hindering falling: surprise, surprise, it didn't work. Real parachutes have vent-holes in the top to help keep it stable, but that would defeat the purpose of an umbrella in the first place. Theoretically, it is still better than nothing since it makes you fall feet-first, so the main impact won't be on your head.

-   Subverted in a 1976 commercial for Kellogg's Raisin Bran. One defective raisin is considered not sweet enough to qualify for the signature 2 scoops and gets jettisoned in the air by Sunny. The hapless raisin parachutes to the ground with an umbrella that quickly fails.
-   Ads for Travelers insurance (now part of Citigroup) featured men in black pinstripe suits carrying gigantic red umbrellas (Travelers' logo) in this manner.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Bleach_, Liltotto Lamperd arrives on the battlefield floating down on a little umbrella.
-   _Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto_: To save a bird caught in a thunderstorm, Sakamoto let the wind pick him up, then opened his umbrella to gently drift down.
-   This is Older Than They Think, actually. In a rather creepy episode of _Mahou no Mako-chan_, one of the titular Magical Girl's rivals is a Creepy Child who uses his red parasol (a traditional Japanese one) this way when he jumps off a building and escapes from her.
-   In the first episode of _Majokko Meg-chan_, Megu flys down into the human world using an umbrella. This becomes her iconic item.
-   This is a primary mode of transportation, both up and down, for the stuffed-animal Mary Land characters in _Onegai My Melody_.

-   Shiro floats around using his parasol in _Project K_.
-   In the first arc of _Sailor Moon_, Usagi uses a parasol to gently float down from a 4th-floor balcony. As if that isn't bad enough, she had Tuxedo Kamen — a young man — hanging on to her during the descent. This is perhaps justified as the parasol was created as part of a magical disguise, so it could very well be magical itself.
-   One episode of _Smile Pretty Cure!_ has the team, shrunk down to insect size, summon umbrellas from the Umbrella Decor and use it to float down to ground level from the window ledge, with the acrophobic Akane and Nao hanging onto one umbrella in a panic.
-   The Ame-Warashi in _×××HOLiC_ is seen doing this in the opening credits with her umbrella, as well as once in the manga. Then again, she is the Rain Spirit, so her use of it might not be entirely unjustified.

    Asian Animation

    Comic Books 

-   One _Archie Comics_ story has Archie and Veronica go for an afternoon drive. With Archie unable to close the roof of his jalopy, they use an umbrella to protect themselves from the sun and lower the windshield to catch a breeze.

    **Reggie:** Don't tell me, I know the name...Mary...Mary Popoff!
    
-   This is a classic shtick of _Batman_'s Penguin who would have special umbrellas that were either designed to be strong enough to act as a parachute or have a helicopter function instead.
-   _DuckTales_: During the first segment of _Scrooge's Quest_, Scrooge uses his umbrella as a parachute while he's chasing his hat (and the money he tucked inside the band). Later, when he falls off an ice bridge at the North Pole, he uses it again, although he admits that it's not going to be able to save him here. Luckily, it doesn't have to, as the boys call Launchpad, who catches him with the plane.
-   Improbably used by British WWII soldier Percy Pinkerton in _Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos_.

-   Happens to John Darling during the song "You Can Fly!" from _Peter Pan_.
-   _Pinocchio_ (and also _Fun and Fancy Free_) - This is Jiminy Cricket's chosen mode of conveyance. It probably helps that he is, well, a cricket.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Meet the Pegasus_: After he gets launched into the sky and knocks the wings off Prince Pegasus, Wolffy quickly grabs a parasol to ease his fall, making the joke that "The first secret of beauty is to keep away from UV rays!" as he does so.

-   In _Scooby-Doo! and the Samurai Sword_, Scooby and Shaggy use a paper umbrella to first fly (using paper fans as wings) and then parachute. It works fine till Scooby tries climbing on top of it.
-   In _Tarzan_, a baby baboon does this with Jane's umbrella after he and the other baboons chase her down for the sketch she drew of him.
-   _The Three Caballeros_/_Saludos Amigos_ - José Carioca is typically seen carrying an umbrella. And since he never seems to use it to keep the rain off of him, Parasol Parachute is one of the alternate uses he has for it.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Jackie Chan does this at some point in _The Accidental Spy_, as he is chased in Turkey. There are no special effects in the scene, he really did it himself. Like almost every other crazy thing he has done in his movies (of course, lots of the times he ends up severely injured... while in the movie he immediately continues to run or whatever)... Medallion was a lot less realistic in this aspect (although to be fair, people died from falls, it was the titular Medallion that brought them back to life with super-natural powers).
-   Played straight in the James Bond movie _For Your Eyes Only_, when Bond uses a poolside umbrella to slow his fall when jumping off a wall. It's also useful as a momentary visual shield to avoid bullets.
-   Near the climax of _Inspector Gadget (1999)_, Gadget and his love interest are plummeting from the top of a skyscraper, so he begins shouting out every possible gadget he can think of that might slow their fall or soften their landing (after he tries "parachute" he glances up for a second because it's actually plausible), eventually trying "parasol", which works. The parachute does open — after they've landed, providing only privacy for an intimate moment.
-   _Mary Poppins_: Mary P can _propel herself upwards_ with one, as well, with help from the West Wind.
-   The conclusion of _Practical Magic_.
-   In _Radio Flyer_, there are seven wondrous abilities that people have while they're children, which become lost as adults. One of them is this, although the scene demonstrating it is played realistically, with Bobby's attempt to use an umbrella to float down is met with him landing heavily on a pile of flowerpots.
-   Though not exactly a parasol, _Short Circuit 2_ has Johnny 5 use a built-in hang glider to slow his fall from a skyrise building. Read that again: a multi-hundred-pound robot breaks his fall with a dinky hang glider small enough to fold into a standard-sized toolbox, all while falling upside-down from several stories of a New York high rise. To be fair, they somehow had to spice up the previous scene from the first movie, in which he saved himself with a common parachute.

    Literature

-   On _Preacher (2016)_ Cassidy tries this when he is forced to jump out of a plane without a parachute. It helps him land feet first but most of his body still ends up as a bloody mangled mess. However, he is a vampire and he gets better after he drinks enough blood.
-   _Readalong_: In the animated intro of the show, the last kid to jump into the book first pulls out an umbrella and uses it to slowly descend into said book.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _d20 Modern_ has the Umbrella of Feather Falling, which functions as a _feather fall_ spell when opened.
-   In the original _Dungeons & Dragons_ setting of _Mystara_, one of the more controversial "goofy" elements was the fact that the Retebius Air Fleet (an aerial branch of the military for the empire of Thyatis) and the Knights of the Air (a Thyatian club for nobles and adventurers interested in flight) both make use of the "Bumber-Chute", an enchanted umbrella that allows the user to slowly descend from heights, as an emergency protection against being knocked from the sky.

    Video Games 

-   _Alice in Wonderland_, released in 1985 for the Commodore 64. Though most plummeting descents would leave Alice stunned on her ass with her bloomers in the air, with the parasol she could guide her descent to reach ledges she otherwise couldn't. Alternating this with the top hat, which allowed her to float up in the same way, she could reach a lot of hidden characters, treasures, and Easter Eggs.

    -   In _Desert Demolition Starring Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote_, one of Wile E.'s ACME items is a tiny umbrella used to gently float down.
-   Olaf from _The Lost Vikings_ does this with a wooden shield. Despite likely weighing as much as the other two vikings combined.
-   _Mario Party 3_: There is a mini-game called Parasol Plummet, where you have to avoid hammers while descending with a parasol and catching the coins and coin bags thrown by some of the Hammer Bros. that hang on the beanstalks. Closing the parasol makes you fall down faster, while opening it will allow you to steer sideways to grab the loot.
-   Subverted in _Mega Man Battle Network 6_, Lan tries this...and the umbrella collapses.
-   P.B. Winterbottom's umbrella from _The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom_. Doubles as a weapon.

-   There's a level of _Power Stone_ where you are falling from a broken airship, and have to grab umbrellas to slow you as you fall. In _Power Stone 2_, Julia came pre-equipped with an umbrella, letting her do this. In the aforementioned level, she still needs to grab one of the other umbrellas, though, or splat.
-   In _Ronald in the Magical World_ for the Game Gear, Ronald collects Mr. Joke's magical stick in the game's opening cutscene, and one of the things it can do is turn itself into a parasol. Ronald can use this parasol to make slow descents, and in the final world, Magical Castle, Ronald can use this on the fans to propel him up to the top floor of Mr. Joke's castle.
-   Okuni can do this in _Samurai Warriors_. Given that the game doesn't have falling damage, this doesn't serve much purpose, but gliding with her umbrella is faster than running so if she starts on top of a hill, she can cover a decent bit of ground fairly quickly if she doesn't have a horse.
-   _Sonic Heroes_ Team Rose can do this with Big's umbrella. It's actually a Shout-Out to the Studio Ghibli movie _My Neighbor Totoro_.

-   _Tower Bloxx_: People who enter the building do so by floating with a parasol to it.
-   The Shadowlands expansion of World of Warcraft includes a repeatable quest that revolves around catching spheres of anima to keep one of these working long enough to reach the landing zone.

    Web Animation 

-   This is done in _RWBY_ by Neo. A few times, she's shown using her umbrella to slow her landing. This is eventually used against her at the end of Volume 3, as she was whisked away by the wind when Ruby activated her parasol on top of an airship.

    Web Comics

    Western Animation 

-   In the opening credits of _Aaahh!!! Real Monsters_, Oblina scares a man holding an umbrella by disguising herself as the umbrella's handle. The man tosses her into the air, and she uses the umbrella to float into the chimney of a schoolhouse, where she scares the children inside.
-   In _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_, "Seer No Evil", Chip fell out of a window but had his fall slowed by an umbrella. (Of course, thanks to the Square-Cube Law, even a fall lacking in increased drag would have perhaps only left him momentarily dazed, so the "flying horse" wouldn't have exactly saved him...)
-   In _Dogstar_, Gran's cyborg arm includes an umbrella which she sometimes uses as a parachute.

    **Square Bear:** Look...it's Mary Poppins!

-   In _The Perils of Penelope Pitstop_ episode "Jungle Jeopardy", a single small umbrella is enough to lower the entire Ant Hill Mob _and_ Chuggaboom safely to the ground.
-   At the end of _Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer_, an elf onboard Santa Claus' sleigh actually gives all of the misfit toys umbrellas to soften their landing after being dropped from the sleigh... ...except for the toy bird that can swim but cannot fly. He refuses to give the bird an umbrella, and _pushes him off the sleigh instead!_
-   The music video for the _Shaun the Sheep_ theme tune has one of the sheep jumping off the roof of the farmer's house using an umbrella.

    Real Life 

-   A man in China once tried this and found that this trope doesn't work in real life (he injured his legs).
-   Qin Shi Huangdi liked to jump from the Great Wall of China carrying an open umbrella over his head. Existing accounts say that he was never hurt. (However, the Great Wall is only 5-8 meters tall, so it's not really much of a drop anyway.)
-   _Brainiac: Science Abuse_ once did this along with attempting other makeshift parachutes.
-   _MythBusters_ tested it. The best thing that can be said about trying this is that it makes you less likely to fall on your head, and more likely to land feet-first, injuring your legs instead of your brain.
