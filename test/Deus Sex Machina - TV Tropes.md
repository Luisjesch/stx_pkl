Any speculative fiction element that requires sex to work. At one extreme, this trope can be used to explore sex-as-metaphor. At the other, it's just an excuse to dress up pornography as plot. Most examples fall somewhere in the middle.

Incidentally, semen has traditionally been associated with vitality, Life Energy, holiness, etc. in various cultures, and the sex act itself with fertility (agricultural, that is) rites and seasonal change, so there's a bit of mythological justification for this trope. Though plenty of phlebotinum works the opposite way.

Overlaps in places with Sex Magic, Intimate Healing and The Power of Love. If the Deus Sex Machina had not been foreshadowed before in any way while also bringing the story to a halt, it's also a case of Sex Starts, Story Stops. See also Mate or Die, Aliens Made Them Do It, and Level-Up at Intimacy 5. Supertrope to Sexually Transmitted Superpowers.

If you're looking for the trope about _actual_ deities having romances or sex, that's Divine Date.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Ah My Buddha_, Ikkou is a male novice at a Buddhist temple populated by a harem of Buddhist nuns. His powerful spiritual ability for combating ghosts and such is unleashed via lust, so the plot resolution is invariably one of the girls disrobing, or being disrobed, in order to release his power.
-   Urd from _Ah! My Goddess_ tries to invoke this trope in her introductory chapter of the manga. She tells Keiichi that he has to have sex with her in order to repair/recharge the system force that keeps him and Belldandy together, and that if he doesn't have sex with her, Belldandy will have to return to heaven. It turns out to be a trick though and Belldandy comes in and reveals that it was just a trick before anything happens.
-   Kinji's Hysteria Mode from _Aria the Scarlet Ammo_ only gets activated when he becomes sexually aroused.
-   Inverted in _Basilisk_, where one of the Koga ninjas is Kagerou, a beautiful and sexy Broken Bird who will never be able to have sex with a man she truly loves since her breath becomes poisonous when she's aroused.
-   _Crimson Spell_ offers up a twofer: the sorcerer Havi keeps Prince Valdrigue's Superpowered Evil Side under control with sex, which apparently also has the effect of helping fuel Havi's own magical powers.
-   A prime example of this is the AliceSoft work _Daiakuji_, where the protagonist comments, upon his release from prison, that he has become weak without sex. Throughout the series, the protagonist becomes more powerful as he subjugates women in the Straw Feminist dystopia.
-   _Dragon Pink_: Pias is an elven sorceress who has to have sex regularly to replenish her mana. She gains a temporary boost by performing oral sex and swallowing. But she gains a _far greater_ reserve by taking it directly into her body, via intercourse. Which is why she often does it with Bobo, whenever their travelling party stops at an inn. Plus, she's usually horny.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: Athena gets captured and brainwashed twice by the organization Blowjob. Both incidents are resolved by someone banging her until she returns to her senses.
    -   In chapter 12, it's done by the teen supervillain, Point Blank. Since Athena was being controlled by the dildo harness of her plugsuit, he uses it to his advantage by stripping down to his boxers, knowing she'd be too horny to resist him. It works. Athena removes the harness in order to have sex with him and is released from Blowjob's control.
    -   The second time happens during _"Uncanny Eighth Wonder no.2"_. This time, Clara and her girlfriend, Mei double-team Athena<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  with a pair of strap-ons, until she finally climaxes hard enough to revert to normal.
-   In _Redo of Healer_, the semen from a male hero can raise the level cap of any non-hero character who receives it. This is one of the main reasons why the eponymous healing hero, Keyaru, is drugged and abused by the female denizens of Jioral Kingdom, but it also works in his favor as it later allows him to raise the level cap of his followers.
-   In the _11eyes_ anime episode 11, Misuzu has sex with Kakeru to power him up (or something along those lines), although they were still unable to defeat Liselotte and prevent the end of the world. The good news is that none of that actually happened and was all part of Kakeru's vision.
-   The _Gantz_ anime toys with this: while Kurono is still unused to using the Gantz suit, he theorizes that it only functions when he is turned on. This theory is only referenced in one scene and the suit seems to function consistently after that, so either Kurono was wrong and the suit also responds to other kinds of "excitement," or he's turned on a LOT. It's probably the former though, as it's heavily implied that the suit works after an adrenaline rush, and considering that several other characters also wear similar suits, it would be too odd to consider that all Gantz's hunters are a bunch of perverts like Kurono.
-   Inverted in _My Balls_. The series begins with the Queen of Terror being sealed into Satou Kohta's right testicle, meaning the world will end should he ever have sex. Cue the sexy legions of Hell using every technique in their arsenal to get in his pants, as Hilarity Ensues.
    
    My ejaculatory control muscle is at its limits!
    
-   In _Genesis of Aquarion_ and its sequel _Aquarion Evol_, combining mechas causes all of the pilots to experience something Better than Sex. Each time they combine, the audience gets a load of screaming, rainbow-coloured naked bodies. The entire series has multiple metaphors to sex and maturity, but those are justified due to many of the characters being teenagers.
-   In _Hybrid × Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia_, Kizuna and his Eros Hybrid Gear can perform the normal "Heart Hybrid" and the more intense "Climax Hybrid" with Aine, Hayuru or Yurishia. Heart Hybrid restores Hybrid Count, while Climax Hybrid allows access to a Super Mode.
-   _Ninja Scroll_ does this in a number of ways involving the female ninja Kagero, whose body is so laced with toxins that any exposure to her bodily fluids would be lethal:
    -   One evil ninja orally violates her; because of his particular powers, the poison takes a while to affect him but it cripples him at a critical moment and leads to his death.
    -   Another evil ninja abducts her and puts her under his mental control by drooling on his fingers to lubricate them.
    -   It's eventually revealed that she can counteract the poison in the lead character's body by sleeping with him, but he refuses her advances for moral reasons. Later on, as she is near death, they kiss, which is implied to be enough to cure him.
-   This happens in the final episode of _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ when Brief's stiff key is the key to unlock Hell's Gate, and the only way Panty can save the day is getting it to go down.
-   _So, I Can't Play H!_: Justified, because Ryosuke derives his power from eroticism, so he has to keep his thoughts focused on perverted fantasies and euphemisms to maintain it. That way, he can readily transfer large quantities of his power to his partner, Lisara, when her fire magic begins to run out.
-   _The Testament of Sister New Devil_: Basara's Battle Harem consists of five girls who all are able to grow more powerful by committing various sex acts with him. Three are contracted in master-servant contracts to him, which results in his and their powers increasing whenever he "forces them to submit". One is a succubus whose power is directly drawn from lust and the satisfaction of said lust. The last is a spirit summoner who has to use dark spirits in the nether realm, and her access to those spirits increases as she becomes more familiar/comfortable with her weaknesses and desires, again through sex acts.
-   In _Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid_ the story largely revolves around a virus that grants young women special powers. Some girls, Exters, can transform into powerful weapons while only other girls, Liberators, can wield those Exters in their weapon form. In order to transform Exters have to enter a trance-like state which is most effectively achieved by getting sexually aroused usually with some fondling and kissing by their Liberator partners.
-   Played ridiculously straight in _Yuria 100 Shiki_. Yuria is a sexbot trying her best to defy her programming. However, despite her best efforts, she inevitably winds up rationalizing some reason to have sex with Shunsuke, regardless of the situation at hand. Hilarity Ensues.

    Comic Books 

-   In the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ comics, Willow uses the power of orgasms to power the spell used to contact her patron goddess, Saga Vasuki.
-   The old _Penthouse ComicX_ series loved this trope:
    -   Hericane's powers came from a combination of explosives... and a mouthful of Captain Adventure's (the current one's father) baby-batter.
    -   Dr. Dare was a Distaff Counterpart Captain America\-Doc Savage hybrid who gained temporary super strength after an orgasm. (Unfortunately for her, masturbation didn't seem to work)
    -   In _Scion_ (NOT the CrossGen one), a dormant Scion's powers could only be activated through sexual contact with a Scion with active powers.
-   In Jean Van Hamme's and Grzegorz Rosinski's _The Great Power of Chninkel_ (_Le Grand Pouvoir du Chninkel_), Volga the Soothsayer must have an orgasm in order to deliver prophecies.
-   In _Hack/Slash_ the female slasher Acid Angel has corrosive vaginal juices as her main weapon. Ew.
-   _Hellblazer_: In the Fear Machine arc, Constantine and his two ex-girlfriends (a hippie and an earth goddess priestess) save the day with a threesome (and "female" magic). The two ladies had spent the previous few months on an island (a character calls it "one of those woman magic places") where the magic was powered by love and orgies.
-   Provides Fan Disservice in _Incorruptible_ #16, where the city's water supply is magically transformed into some noxious substance by the unattractive and obese sex magicians Nebuchadnezzar and Loretta Grass, whose spells only last as long as they're "chanting".
-   Pandora Breedlswight from _Ironwood_ is possessed by a demon that can be summoned at will (taking her place), but can't be dismissed by anything else than an orgasm. This is part of a family curse, running on male members, until Pandora happens to be the last of her line. Her male ancestors seemed not to care for the curse, anyway.
-   The John Byrne comic _Next Men_ has sex with the Next Men as a catalyst which bestows super-power mutations on normal humans.
-   In Alan Moore's _Promethea_, Jack Faust agrees to teach Sophie Bangs about magic in return for sex with her alter-ego, Promethea. There is a justified reason for this, as Faust uses the opportunity to explain the relationship and symbolism of "male" and "female" magic. But also 'cause Faust is horny, and it allows for an issue-long sex scene. And it's traditional for a wizard to be an utter asshole.
-   In _Top 10: Beyond the Farthest Precinct_, the Hell Ditch Pilgrim is revealed to have gotten his powers in the previous _Top 10_ series by catching S.T.O.R.M.S., a mutating disease, from a prostitute.
-   Valiant Comics' _Shadowman_ had to have sex with young-looking Voudun priestess Mama Nettie on a regular basis to _keep_ her young and powerful, so she could help him control his mystical Dark Side.
-   Phil Foglio's _XXXenophile_ sometimes uses this, but usually with a comedic twist. For example, the one where the nymph mentions casually in passing that people's orgasms keep the earth from exploding, or the one where a time traveller from the future has to find out whether it's worth bringing back women through cloning, but it turns out it's just an exceptional couple roleplaying. Foglio is careful to make sure the sex always remains consensual and un-forced, no matter how weird the situation gets. For example, there is a ghost who can be sent on to heaven by having sex with the specific guy she was fantasizing about when she died, or he can just _tell_ her to go. The sex is not obligatory.

    Fan Works 

-   In the extensive _Star Trek_ Alternate Universe Fic _Firing Solution_, Pon Farr and the Vulcan mating cycle and cultural history are examined in far more depth, and at least half the mechanics of The Federation and the power shifts in the galaxy prove to be directly attributable to Vulcan Nookie.
-   It's a fairly common trope in _Harry Potter_ fanfic that werewolves' condition makes them perpetually horny. It probably originated with the Remus/Sirius ship, but has since spread.
-   In the _Fate/stay night_/_Sekirei_ crossover _In Flight_, by Gabriel Blessing Shirou uses this to make Akitsu his Sekirei.
-   In Chapter 34 of Light and Dark The Adventures of Dark Yagami, the Creepy Chick turns out to be able to time travel via "lots of sexing".
-   In _The Legend of Zelda_ fanfic _My Inner Life_, the main couple decide to go to a monastery that performs "pagan bonding rituals" for married couples. The four-part ritual is broken down into the physical bonding, the mental bonding, the spiritual bonding and the sexual bonding. Guess what Link and Jenna need to do for the last one.
-   In the _Pony POV Series_, Bright Eyes suffers total amnesia following the apocalypse that ended the Age of Wonders due to the magical backlash. Having sex with her husband Lancer restores her memory of their relationship, though the act itself was completely off screen and the closest to description given is Bright Eyes complimenting Lancer about it. Justified as reminders of certain parts of her lost memory repeatedly cause them to resurface before and after this, so it was less sex was required to restore her memory and more having the intimate moment with her husband was the trigger to cause her memories of their wedding and wedding night to resurface. It was also specifically this time as it was the first time they'd had sex period since Bright Eyes had lost her memory, with Lancer having refused to push the issue until Bright Eyes felt she was ready.
-   The _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ doujin _RE-TAKE_, takes this to... a much lower level than would be expected, considering the author's previous work! This is done properly in chapter one. All 5 chapters thereafter just play dress-up-the-sex-and-hope-the-audience-doesn't-notice.
-   In a _True Blood_/_X-Men Film Series_ crossover _Survival of the Fallen_, it turns out that Rogue of all people is a succubus. In this case Succubi aren't outright demonic, and appear to go either way morally speaking. They seem more like talented sex oriented energy vampires, without actually needing to take energy. Considering the character this happens to, this is most ironic, and a major plot point.
-   Brony made tabletop Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder is basically this as a game. There's even a card called Divine Intervention! Though to be fair, it's less "sex" and more "romance"...

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the remake of _Cat People_, the werepanthers' transformation is triggered by sex.
-   In _Ghostbusters_, it's strongly implied that Dana Barrett, while possessed by Zuul the Gatekeeper, had sex with Louis Tully, who was possessed by Vinz Clortho the Keymaster, in order to free Big Bad Gozer. In fact, a deleted scene from the movie has Louis explicitly asking Dana if they "did it".
-   Averted in the first _Ghoulies_ film. A would-be Satanic wizard paints a ritual pentagram under his bed, then attempts to have sex with his female companion there. Realizing that he's chanting under his breath, she catches on that it's one of his sick magical experiments, and kicks him out of bed.
-   In the 1987 Rom Com _My Demon Lover,_ the hero is under a curse that makes him turn into a demonic monster whenever he gets turned on. When his love interest is captured by the real (and likewise cursed) monster of the story, her best friend seduces him to enable him to make the transformation and fight the bastard. (This makes the love interest jealous, despite the obvious necessity.)
-   In the Israeli film _The Revenge of Isaac Finkelstein_ - there's a ghost of an ancient monk who's invisible to everyone except the protagonist, unless he has a hard-on, which makes him visible (or semi-transparent, depending on the hardness of his 'on').
-   In the movie _Zerophilia_, people with the "Z chromosome" change gender when they have sex with another person with the Z chromosome, or (when their powers first manifest) simply when they reach orgasm. (No, it's not quite as pornographic as it sounds.)

    Literature 

-   In _American Gods,_ a perversion of the Queen of Sheba literally devours a man through the act of coitus, apparently to substitute for the worship she wasn't getting to sustain herself.
    -   Also, there is importance in Shadow's in-dream sex with Bast.
    -   Not to mention the Ifrit who exchanges bodies through sex
-   The eponymous protagonist of the _Anita Blake_ series has had her supernatural powers become more closely tied to sex with each passing book, resulting in a situation where the solution to any problem is for her to have sex with somebody or something. That makes this also an example of When All You Have Is a Hammer…... or possibly, in this case, a screwdriver.
-   In _Battle Circle_ by Piers Anthony, the heroine is trapped in a Minotaur's maze. The hero goes in to rescue her. He finds her but they are unable to escape and the Minotaur is closing in on them. The hero remembers that the Minotaur is only interested in virgins and he can save the heroine's life by another means.
-   In the _The Book of All Hours_ duology by Hal Duncan, especially in the second book, "Ink", tantric sex apparently makes it easier to travel between the various alternate realities. Several kinds of technology also seem to be fueled by sex, using so-called "orgone energy" as a power source.
-   _Changes_: Harry Dresden makes a desperate bargain with the Fae Queen Mab to become her Knight, only to find out that that particular magic contract needs to be sealed with much more than a kiss.
-   Played for Drama in the _Dante Valentine_ series, where sexwitches are a variety of psion who generate Power for works of magic through sexual activity. Unsurprisingly they're commonly employed as strippers and prostitutes. The spinoff novel _Selene_ has one as its protagonist.
-   In the first book of the Drizzt series, there is an orgy at the academy, seemingly something they do traditionally every year. The priestess with the best grades has intercourse with a summoned demon, while around her all the other female students pick a male student and get it on.
-   In the later _Dune_ novels, an offshoot of the Bene Gesserit arise who use sex as a form of hypnosis — it's just _that_ good, apparently. Numerous galaxy-spanning, wheels within wheels plots are derailed when it is discovered that there is a man with the same power. A-whoops! Given his place in the series as the designated Cosmic Plaything, this is simply karmic balance for him.
    -   And this man trains other men to use that power. Leading to a guerilla war fought mostly using SEX. Really awesome sex. Where do I sign up?
-   _The Folk of the Air_ by Peter S. Beagle: there is a fairly random sex scene between an ancient evil spirit in a boy's body and a young (very young) woman for the purpose of "tantric sorcery."
-   In Stephen King's _IT_ (but not in The Film of the Book for obvious reasons), Beverly Marsh has sex with the other members of the Losers Club (all six of them, one after the other, in a sewer) in order to re-forge the connection between them after defeating IT as pre-teens. Apparently it's supposed to be a metaphor for moving from childhood to adulthood.
    -   Another level of irony also exists here, when you contrast this with another scene in the book. Beverly's father is portrayed as an abusive, overprotective, borderline psychopath. When he learns that Beverly has been playing with boys, he insists — violently — on _physically_ checking to see if she's still a virgin. Fortunately, she escapes him. At this point, she still is, and the scene plays out like an attempted rape.
        -   The real irony of the matter is that Beverly is inspired to have sex with the boys _because_ of what her father did. He put the idea in her head.
    -   Stephen King does this a lot. In his _The Dark Tower_ series, in order to retrieve Jake from the other world, Roland has Odetta/Detta distract the oracle. In the series, oracles are demons that feed on sexual energy (i.e., Succubi and Incubi). Go on, guess the best way to distract one.
-   In Dan Simmon's _Olympos,_ one of the main characters finds a slumbering princess who's been kept in stasis for centuries. The only way to wake her? Climb in the stasis chamber and give her some lovin'.
-   In the _Illuminatus!_ trilogy, the goddess Eris has sex with multiple men to return to God mode. The insanely high amounts of sex in that book build up a pretty good reader tolerance to implausible sex acts, but that one takes the cake.
-   In Michael Swanwick's _The Iron Dragon's Daughter_, protagonist Jane learns to use sex magic to boost her own spellcasting ability.
-   Ramona Random, a Black Chamber agent in Charles Stross's _The Jennifer Morgue_ has a succubus bound to her. If she doesn't have sex, it eats her mind. If she does have sex, it kills the partner instead. She's employed as an assassin, naturally.
-   _Kushiel's Legacy_ contains any number of scenes where the main character resolves whatever problems exist in the kingdom through having sex with someone. This is because she is magically gifted with _really_ enjoying every kind of kinky sex...
-   In _Merry Gentry,_ by the author of _Anita Blake,_ it's eventually explicitly stated that the power of Faerie comes from the natural order and thus can only be awakened through fertility rites. This _does_ allow the choice of sex or death (killing in battle or sacrificing loved ones), and Meredith isn't always viewed favorably for favoring the "soft" option (except by the beneficiaries of it). Since the protagonist here has been chosen to revitalize the entire magical world... this series basically starts sexually at the point _Anita Blake_ was at that time, with a main character who never had any of Anita's former inhibitions.
-   In Alex Prentiss' novel _Night Tides_, the main character communes with lake spirits, but in return, she must help everyone who needs it.
-   Older Than Feudalism: In _The Odyssey_ Odysseus is forced to have sex with Circe to save his crew from being swine. Definitely forced.
-   _Perfume: The Story of a Murderer_. In the end, the man finally completes the "perfect" perfume he had been attempting to create the entire movie, and drops the vial on the ground while being led to his execution for his multiple murders and distilling of young women's essences. The smell is so beautiful, everyone in attendance participates in a spontaneous orgy, and the man if one could him that towers above them as an ubermensch free of such deceits regarding its nature.
    -   Same for the film of the book.
-   Inverted in S.M. Stirling's alternate-history novel _The Peshawar Lancers_: The heroine has been (incestuously) bred for clairvoyance; this power (1) only works for virgins and (2) ultimately drives the holder to madness and death. You can guess what the hero does to save her.
-   In Larry Niven's _Ringworld_ series, depending on the particular human subspecies involved, when two inhabitants from different subspecies meet, the standard greeting may be ritualized sex ("Rishathra" is the word for this among the species our protagonist meets in _The Ringworld Engineers_), though for some cultures it is taboo. (People still talk about Niven showing up at a sci-fi convention in the late 1970s wearing a button that said "I have sex outside my species.")
-   The erotica writer Salamando, aka Salamando Flames enjoys mixing elements of fantasy adventure and superhero fiction into his erotica. Often, sex will in some way be used as a mechanism for mind control, domination, acquiring magical energy, exacting revenge, fueling super powers, or even healing. In the Sex Mage World stories, the entire basis of magical powers (which only women have access to) requires sex and arousal to both activate and continue functioning.
-   _The Secrets of Jin Shei_ - although Lihui is a powerful mage without resorting to this, it's implied that he can only keep his strength and immortality by stealing other people's energy. Unfortunately for Nhia, to create the psychic link he needs for this ritual, he has to create a physical link as well. Guess how.
-   This happens with Leah, Henry, and Tony in _Smoke and Shadows_. Leah is tied via Demongate to a sex demon named Ryne Cyratane, but the demon doesn't comprehend homosexuality. Tony the gay wizard can tell that Ryne Cyratane wants to communicate with him, but literally can't see him without the sexual connection. Ergo, Tony's ex Henry is enlisted for a save-the-world threesome that will enable Tony to talk to the demon.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_ Melisandre the Red Priestess/sorceress is able to spawn shadow demons that can be used as assassins. She needs sex in order to create them, but it apparently weakens the man she uses; she herself states that Stannis' declining health is due to her using him in that way, and so tries to convince Davos Seaworth to help. It is possible that her interactions with Jon Snow are a prelude to trying to use him in this way.
-   In Terry Mancour's _The Spellmonger Series_, the first book ends with a literal bang, as the main character and his Ex have sex to power a giant spell to forcibly bridge two location in the fabric of space and time, in order to save the population of the valley from a horde of genocidal goblins.
-   In "Sun, Moon, and Talia", a fairy tale of the "Sleeping Beauty" type (and probably a major influence on the more famous Charles Perrault version), the princess stays asleep until she has twins and one of them suckles the poisoned needle from her finger.
    -   One version says that what wakes her up is her first baby's cry.
-   Jennifer Stevenson's _Trash Sex Magic_ is _entirely_ about this trope, as its title might well imply.
-   The _Wild Cards_ series has several examples:
    -   Fortunato has "magickal" powers that must be fueled by tantric sex. Fortunately for him, he's a pimp with easy access to geisha-style prostitutes.
    -   The character of "Blowjob" must be sexually excited in order to breathe life into inanimate objects.
    -   Roulette can kill by unleashing poisonous vaginal secretions.
    -   "Prime" was able to give the "Jumpers" their power to switch minds with other people by having anal sex with them.
    -   Water Lily gets the power to cure Jokers by intercourse after being infected by the Sleeper's new strain of Wild Card virus.
    -   Genetrix lay eggs which hatch into short-lived children with ace powers fitting her needs when engaging in sex.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Game of Thrones_: Melisandre's ability to birth Living Shadow assassins requires sex as part of the ritual.
-   The eponymous planet-killing spaceship of _Lexx_ would only respond to whoever held its symbiotic energy key in their brain. The host would involuntarily release the key into whoever else was nearby if brought to the very edge of death... or the very extreme of sexual ecstasy. Interestingly, this was _not_ equivalent to orgasm; actual sex usually did nothing to trigger the key, whereas just the _anticipation_ of sex with a character's One True Love thrice _did._
-   _Motherland: Fort Salem_: Sexual energy (whether from desire or acting on it) is able to fuel spells. Thus when the male witches are at Fort Salem, their counterparts are told to utilize this.
-   In _The Others (2000)_, two of the characters have fallen in love, but the interaction of their respective psi-powers causes powerful energy discharges whenever they touch. In the finale, as part of a series of strange happenings that works to break the group apart, they find that they can now safely touch one another. This tragically turns out to be an illusion created by an otherworldly evil force, which lifts while they're having sex. Cue the _entire building exploding_.
-   In _Smallville_, Clark's discovery of his Heat Vision was linked to him being aroused. I wonder what _that_ reminds you of...
-   _Star Trek_ has Pon Farr — every seven or eight years Vulcans get a hormone craze that is generally only to be satiated by sex. Either they do or die, literally. Fortunately, the holodeck version counts. Or they find an alternative way to give said Vulcan similar emotions to sex, e.g. extreme anger/rage/sadness, like believing that you killed your best friend.
    -   An interesting sign of increasing flanderization as the franchise has gone on, as well. Prior to _Star Trek: Enterprise_, only Vulcan _males_ were afflicted by Pon Farr. Dialogue also confirmed it was strictly a male condition. Somehow this mutated until it now affects _all_ Vulcans. The presence of Jolene Blalock may have had something to do with that. It was also portrayed completely differently; while Spock and Tuvok had been portrayed as becoming increasingly emotional in general, with the most obvious being _anger_ (Spock in particular flew into a rage when Nurse Chapel made a pass at him), T'Pol basically went into heat and tried to jump the bones of the nearest man.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Bliss Stage_, the power of a Pilot's Dream Land Humongous Mecha is based on the intimacy level of their relationships. To get the maximum of Intimacy 5 with anyone you're not related to, you have to have sex with them. It's quite disturbing considering the Pilots are teenagers, and the Anchors that produce their mecha and the various supporting characters are either teenagers, or full-out children.
    -   This is mechanically discouraged, as well: losing an Intimacy 5 relationship to trust issues can destroy an entire RESISTANCE... Not to mention that being overly powerful leads characters to gain Bliss more quickly, and reaching 108 Bliss leads to very bad things — start with "your character dies horribly" and work your way up from there.
-   One of the many strange and juvenile things that comes with the territory when people publish sex-based supplements for _Dungeons & Dragons_ (officially, the legendarily bad _Book of Erotic Fantasy_, as well as _Encyclopedia Arcana: Nymphology_ and _Quintessential Temptress_, with the latter two basically a collection of juvenile snickering). Tantric magic is just the tip of it.
    -   And _Sisters of Rapture_, which kicks it up a notch with full-frontal nudity on nearly every page — some of it showing tavern scenes and the like to drive the point home that these characters _never wear clothing at all_.
-   In the _Old World of Darkness_ and _Chronicles of Darkness_:
    -   _Mage: The Ascension_ has the Cult of Ecstasy. Sure, they don't just revolve around using sex as magical foci (they also use drugs, music, meditation, etc.), but it's easily the aspect with the most humor potential. The Verbena also get into it occasionally - while Blood Magic is their usual (and most powerful) focus, they can work with anything that could be dubbed a "vital fluid."
    -   _Mage: The Awakening_ includes a Legacy called the Whipping Boys. They don't necessarily use sex, but BDSM, using deeply intensive "sessions" to find revelation in a place beyond pain and pleasure.
    -   _Changeling: The Lost_'s Changelings draw their power from the presence of strong emotions, especially the driving emotion of their own Court. The Spring Court's theme is Desire, and while it attracts every flavour of _bon vivant_, it keeps "Sage Escorts" on staff for this reason.
-   Both played straight and inverted in _Unknown Armies_ with the tastefully named magick school of Pornomancy. Followers get charged up from mechanically reenacting scenes from porn films starring The Naked Goddess, a porn star who got promoted to the Invisible Clergy. The inversion comes from the fact that if they ever have sex with anyone for any other reason than charging up, all their stored power goes away.
-   In _Warhammer_ and _Warhammer 40,000_, the Chaos God Slaanesh and its followers have this reputation, however _any_ excessive and obsessive mindset can cause empowerment in his/her name, not just sex. The Emperor's Children Legion were seduced by Slaanesh due to their single-minded obsession with purity and the excesses they would commit to achieve and maintain it, Noise Marines are focused on extremes of psychically-charged music, and The Masque (most powerful of all Daemonettes) gets its power from basically being the best dancer in the universe, able to entrance even the Chaos Gods.

    Theater 

-   In Richard Strauss's early opera _Feuersnot_, Kunrad punishes Diemut's rejection by magically banishing fire from the town until she gives herself to him.

-   _Brütal Legend_: Apparently, years of orgy and violence can cause a "temporal perversion" aka _time travel_. It's the Tainted Coils we are talking about, however, it's almost expected.
-   A possible choice at the end of _Dragon Age: Origins_ is for Morrigan to conceive a child with either of the three male Wardens of the story (Alistair, Loghain or the male Player Character) in order to make a receptacle for the Archdemon's soul; otherwise, a Heroic Sacrifice is necessary. Unlike other examples of this trope, this choice is far more serious than it looks, and when pressed Morrigan refuses to explain exactly what she'll _do_ with the kid once it's born. (If the trope's taken and Morrigan's son Kieran is conceived, _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ has her raising the boy quite lovingly.)
-   Though it cuts short with mere implications in _Duel Savior Destiny_, sex is apparently a necessity for Rico/Oltara to contract with Taiga. And wow, talk about bad timing: They're technically in the middle of a fight.
-   In _Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle_ , Huraine (goddess of love, lush scenery, strawberries and chocolate) requires this of her worshipers in their rituals, which is good news for Dorcas. One of the Multiple Endings even has the Duchess becoming the centrepiece of one of these rituals.
    -   Most of the game is this trope, really, although it's more nudity and gratuitous lesbian fanservice than strictly intercourse. Carmina's route is probably the one that fits the implausible/inappropriate part; not many people would confront their rapist just to immediately forgive them for it, and then pursue a romantic relationship.
-   In _Grand Theft Auto_ games, players gain health from prostitutes. This method can be used to greater-than-max health.
    -   The fourth one added strippers. They heal the same amount prostitutes do, but they cost more.
-   _Kamihime Project_ has the player character forming "covenants" with the title divinely-powered girls via having sex with them. And as certain scenes illustrate, it is very possible for a Kamihime to be forced into a covenant against their will.
-   The PC-88 RPG _Cosmic Soldier_ allows you to exchange defense power for attack power by having sex with your hot Robot Girl partner.
-   Completely inverted in _Planescape: Torment_, where the token demoness is a reformed succubus, runs an Intellectual Brothel and refuses to feast on horny men for her power. She is the healer of the party, but not quite the Intimate Healer; her kisses are an attack.
-   The fangame _Quest for Glory 4.5_ also allows the hero to be "healed" in a brothel. Needless to say the company owning the original game wasn't too happy.

    Visual Novels 

-   The giant mechas in the anime _Lime-iro Senkitan_ are powered by someone having sex with their pilots.
-   _Nasuverse_:
    
    -   In _Fate/stay night_, while most Masters recharge their Servant's mana by simply transferring it to them directly, Shirou cannot do this because he lacks the magic skills needed to do so. Then, Rin explains that he has two other options: to have his Servant Saber slaughter humans and steal their Life Energy (which Shirou _really_ doesn't want to do, and which is the route taken by Kotomine to power up Gilgamesh), or to have sex with said Servant. Logically, the last one is the decision taken. As one fanfic put it:
    
    _In order to stop a truly powerful enemy, you had to have sex with two women at once, and that it actually made one of them powerful enough to win against a foe you had no hope of defeating before?_
    
    -   In a similar vein, in the _Tsukihime_ the Synchronizers' ability work through fluid exchange, as well as suppressing Roa in Ciel's ass in an earlier route. Meanwhile, the pseudo-sequel _Kagetsu Tohya_ is a subversion, as there's a perfectly viable alternate solution you can take, Len just doesn't like it as much.
-   In the Limited (Adult) Version of _Nekojishi_ Lin Hu and Likulau have to have sex with Liao so that they will be 'attuned' enough for them to possess his body and be strong enough to do what they need to do.
-   In _NU: carnival_, everyone is able to tap into a mysterious force called essence which they draw power from. The optimum way to replenish and regulate essence happens to be through sexual intercourse. Eiden usually has sex with a clan member he's trying to recruit by the end of each chapter which also helps to regulate the essence to their magic and fighting capabilities.

    Web Comics 

-   _Sonichu_, of all comics, has this in issue #8 with Silvana, whose "nectar" is a poisonous and paralytic sleeping agent she secretes during sex. After transforming herself to look like Bubbles, she makes out with Blake, knocks him out, and advances what little plot there is in the comic in the first place.
-   _Super Stupor_ has one _comic_ where Magic Eye reveals that his superpower is the ability to compel anyone to tell the truth... as long as his penis is inside them. (He doesn't like to do it to someone who hasn't given consent, but "you'd be unpleasantly surprised who does.") When asked how he discovered this power, he remains silent and mortified while a third character chimes in that this is "the best divorce story ever!"

    Web Original 

-   Go to asstr.org's author's page and look up Stephen Gray (NSFW or kids). Marvel at both the sex as mind control and demons/potions/Aliens Made Them Do It. Notice how vanilla most of the sex is. Wonder if this is a case of the Machina being extraneous to the sex...
-   Now, the vast majority of _Ilivais X_s Humongous Mecha are fairly normal and realistic. But the eponymous one only registers with one who possesses "Love" Drive Core (or has a similar demeanor), but the way it works makes it more similar to lust. This kicks off numerous broad themes involving the border between love and lust and whatnot, but the most clear example of an out-and-out Deus Sex Machina is the Love Drive Core attack, which can basically only be used via orgasm.
-   This shows up a _lot_ in the Sci-Fi and Fantasy section of the website Literotica, though details vary.

    Western Animation 

-   _Drawn Together_: In one episode, Ling-Ling and his "Permanent Battle Partner" Ni-pul enjoyed their battle sequences like sex, until it becomes too stale to enjoy. Ni-pul suggests to make things more interesting by actually, as Ling-Ling would put it, "dipping his noodle in her duck sauce"...
