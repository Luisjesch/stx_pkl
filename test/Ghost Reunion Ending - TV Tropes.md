An Ending Trope in which the spirits of the dead reappear at the end of the work. This may be because they were Barred from the Afterlife but the resolution of the plot now allows them to cross over. It could also be because the Unfinished Business the ghosts were worried about has been taken care of. A still-living character who is having a Dying Dream may see the ghosts of characters who have gone before. A villainous character may meet the ghosts of people they killed or otherwise wronged. It may be as simple as a protagonist at the end of a work remembering all those who have been lost.

### **Compare:**

-   Afterlife Welcome: Characters greeted on their deathbed by those already in the afterlife.
-   Celebrities Hang Out in Heaven: Some or all of the ghosts are recognizable celebrities.
-   Died Happily Ever After: Characters are happy in the afterlife.
-   Not Too Dead to Save the Day: Characters return from the afterlife to help the living.
-   Together in Death: Characters reunited in the afterlife.

A form of Back for the Finale. See also Nostalgia Heaven, a closely related trope in which the character dies, often temporarily, and sees the dearly departed in the afterlife.

**This is an Ending Trope AND a Death Trope. As such, it contains massive spoilers.**

-   _Star Wars_:
    -   The most famous example is _Return of the Jedi_. After Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker's Viking Funeral, Luke joins his friends (and the Ewoks) in celebrating their victory over the Empire. He looks behind him at one point and sees the "Force ghosts" of Anakin, Obi-wan, and Yoda watching him.

Nastya kisses him and Alexei gives him a hug.

    Literature 

-   Played with in _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_, Harry's climactic duel with Voldemort causes the spirits of Voldemort's victims, including Cedric Diggory and his parents, to appear. They then help Harry out in the duel. As Dumbledore later explains, they're actually magical imprints, not unlike magic paintings.
    -   A somewhat straighter example (but still closer to climax than resolution) comes at the end of _Deathly Hallows,_ when Harry uses the Resurrection Stone to summon the spirits of his parents, and Sirius and Remus. They give him their courage and love and stay with him while he walks to his death.
-   Played with at the end of _Wuthering Heights_. After Heathcliff's death, many locals claim to have seen his ghost in various places, and one little shepherd boy claims to have seen him with a woman, presumably the ghost of Cathy. But it's never made clear if these sightings are real or just imagined. Most media adaptations play the trope straighter and actually show Heathcliff and Cathy's ghosts Together in Death in the end.
-   Happens occasionally in _Warrior Cats_.
    -   At the end of the _Tigerstar and Sasha_ manga, Tigerstar appears next to Sasha and promises her that he'll watch over their children.
    -   In _Tree's Roots_, Tree's father reappears at the end to him to tell him that he doesn't regret having died to save his son, and to tell Tree not to live his life alone.

-   At the end of the _Rose of York Series_ Anne's ghost comes to Richard as he is dying at Bosworth and says he will soon be with her and their son, Ned.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Cold Case_ almost always ends with somebody seeing the victim. Often they were seen by a detective but it was a loved one a lot too (especially in the later seasons).
-   _Ash vs. Evil Dead_: Parodied in the season 2 finale when during the rally that Ash's hometown organized for him, the ghosts of Ash's deceased friends and family show up in the audience in imitation of _Return of the Jedi_.
-   At the end of _Spartacus: War of the Damned_, the crucified Gannicus has a dying vision of his best friend Oenomaus, who died in the previous season, welcoming him to the afterlife.
-   As Susan leaves Wisteria Lane in the final episode of _Desperate Housewives_, she's watched by several dead characters from earlier seasons.
-   The Finale Movie of _Homicide: Life on the Street_ ends with the recently deceased Giardello meeting up with Felton and Crosetti in the afterlife. It's ominously implied that another member of the unit (likely Bayliss) will join them soon.
-   The Season 3 finale of _Shtisel_ ends on a scene where Shulem, Nuchem, and Akiva share a drink and are surrounded by the ghosts of several generations of relatives. The show already had Dead Person Conversations several times per season, though it's left ambiguous whether it's all in a character's head.

    Music 

-   The video for Limp Bizkit's "Re-arranged" ends with all the band members floating in Heaven after being executed in the flood chamber.

    Theater 

-   At the end of the play _Fortenbras_ all the dead characters of _Hamlet_, who have been haunting Fortenbras throughout the play, all appear onstage with him.
-   At the end of _Hamilton_, _Hamilton himself_ appears to join Eliza, his wife, and they exit through the back of the stage. Given the nature of the final song, it's unclear whether it's Hamilton's ghost or just a memory of him, as other deceased people (such as Washington and Laurens) appear seamlessly alongside those who are still alive (Burr, Lafayette, Jefferson, Madison, and Mulligan).
    -   However, the appearance of Laurens, Philip, Washington, and Hamilton's mother in the previous song do validate this trope (also falling under Nostalgia Heaven).
-   The end of _Les Misérables_ has the ghosts of Eponine and Fantine (and, in the 2012 film, the Bishop) come to take Valjean to heaven. Waiting for him in heaven are Enjolras, Gavroche, and the other dead students. Curiously absent is Javert, who is the only character to die in the play and not return in the Finale.
-   _Spring Awakening_ ends with the ghosts of Moritz and Wendla coming back to talk to Melchior.

    Video Games 

-   _Final Fantasy X_: After Sin is defeat, Tidus begins fading away due to the Fayth awakening and their dream ending (where he originated from).

-   The Golden Ending of _Suikoden V_ has this overlapped with Not Too Dead to Save the Day: the Falenan Royal Family, the Godwins and their supporters appear before the Prince to congratulate him and use the power of the Sun Rune to revive Lyon.
-   _Super Robot Wars Alpha 3_: In the Grand Finale, when the heroes use the positive energies of the song "GONG" to cancel out Keisar Ephes's invulnerability, it has the side effect of weakening the barrier between the worlds of the living and the dead, causing the spirits of deceased friends, family, and rivals to appear and lend them words of encouragement for the final battle. Amusingly, it's possible for Char Aznable to show up twice - he appears to Kamille in his "Quattro" persona, and to Amuro as the Well-Intentioned Extremist from _Char's Counterattack_.
-   At the end of _Sakura Wars 4: Fall in Love, Maidens_, the newly-retired Ikki Yoneda walks in Ueno Park when he sees the spirits of the Paris and Imperial Combat Revue members reuniting with Ichiro Ogami, as well as the spirits of his former comrades Ayame Fujieda, Shinnosuke Yamazaki and Kazuma Shinguji watching him.
