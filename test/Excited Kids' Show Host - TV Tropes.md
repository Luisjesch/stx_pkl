There seems to be an unwritten rule that all kids show hosts, except for Mr. Rogers who is an archetype unto himself, must act excitable and zany, if not downright bonkers. Kids do seem to genuinely enjoy this sort of thing, but it can seem irritating to many adults. There actually seem to be different approaches to this:

1.  _The Under Sixes Host_: Zany but kind-sounding, though this may come off as somewhat condescending sounding to some adults; many an Edutainment Show host is like this.
2.  _The Over Sixes Host_: Wacky, zany and, in most cases, less "condescending" sounding. More likely to engage in pranks and tease (but not too harshly) the kids on their shows.
3.  _Informative Over Sixes Host_: In shows that are meant to be more Infotainment than Edutainment the hosts aren't really all that zany or wacky. However they do still sound upbeat and excited most of the time, can also sound a bit condescending from time to time but a little less so than the Under Sixes Host as the concepts they explain can actually be somewhat complex.

Related to the Misplaced Kindergarten Teacher (and may be one themselves). For their disturbing jerk of a cousin, see Depraved Kids' Show Host.

### **Straight examples:**

    Under Sixes Host 

-   Any of the CBeebies presenters. This can also expand to CBeebies shows too, like Justin Fletcher's alter ego Mr. Tumble from Something Special and the titular character from Mister Maker.
-   The Sprout presenters as well. Both CBeebies and PBS Kids Sprout feature presenters who are friendly and entertain children, and also feature birthday cards for children aged up to seven years old.
-   _The Sunny Side Up Show_, although the hosts don’t talk down to viewers.
-   Miles from _The Lets Go Show_
-   _Blue's Clues_, although neither Steve nor Joe actually come across as condescending.
    -   Josh of _Blue's Clues & You!_ is a straight example.
-   _Barney_ as well.
-   From _Sesame Street_:
    -   Murray, who functioned as a presenter in his own right in Seasons 40-45.
    -   In a more fictional example, we have Elmo for the _Elmo's World_ and _Elmo the Musical_ segments. Well, being three-years-old, it's no surprise.
    -   Big Bird was also this in the _Journey to Ernie_ segments.
-   The Wiggles, who sometimes slightly border on type 2.
    -   Along with their wannabes, the Hooley-Dooleys.
    -   So. Many. Wiggles-alikes. Scotland has The Singing Kettle, although they predated the Wiggles by about ten years.
    -   Hi-5 is another Australian one.
-   DJ Lance Rock of _Yo Gabba Gabba!_.
-   Kayne Peters of TVNZ 6's Kidzone. And to some extent Suzy Cato.
-   Jodie, Kathrine and Okutai of the New Zealand children's show _The Go Show_.
-   The Imagination Movers.
-   Ariane Carletti, co-host of French Saturday Morning Kids’ Show, _Club Dorothée_, was the excitable child-like one in the team, very much the boisterous "petite soeur" to presenter Dorothée.
-   The old International Playhouse Disney format featured presenters that border towards this type. for example on the UK feed, Big Dave and Little Alex, and to a degree Jason from _Circle Time_. Sara-Louise (and later, Olivia) from _Art Play_ bordered more on the type 3 range.
-   The Cat in the Hat from _The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss_ in its second season.
-   Face (also from _Face's Music Party_) and Piper O'Possum from Nick Jr..
-   The hosts of both Channel 5's Milkshake and CBC Kids. They are rather upbeat and adventurous.

    Over Sixes Host 

-   Zoe Ball, like her father Johnny, was a presenter of childrens' shows for the BBC and others.
-   _Bill Nye the Science Guy._ Although it should be noted that he is a favourite of science class students all the way to at least high school AP classes, and probably in college as well. He probably falls between Type 1 and Type 2 actually.
    -   Bill Nye is excellent at taking complex scientific concepts, and making it so a 10-year-old can understand them. It comes with the territory.
-   _Dick & Dom in da Bungalow_
-   The (literally) animated dog host of the PBS Kids game show _FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman_.
-   The presenters of _Totally Doctor Who_
-   _Beakman's World_ — Beakman falls between a Type 2 and 3, as opposed to Bill Nye.
-   One of the oldest examples is Soupy Sales, a host from the 1950s and '60s.
-   Paul Reubens as Pee-Wee Herman in _Pee-wee's Playhouse_
-   Timmy Mallett on _The Wide Awake Club_ and its summer holiday spin-off _Wacaday_. In addition to being unable to talk in anything other than a manic shout, his gimmicks included hitting kids with a large foam-rubber mallet while wearing loud shirts and more than one baseball cap.
-   Elliot, the host of _Rollercoaster_ on the ABC in Australia.
-   Every "PJ" (program jockey) YTV has used to present its afternoon and Saturday morning programming over the years.
-   Unsurprisingly, Richard Hammond is this type on _Blast Lab_.
-   Ant and Dec on SMTV.
-   James Sherry on A\*mazing
-   Alton Brown falls between types 2 and 3. It's notable in that _Good Eats_ is generally regarded as a mostly _adult_ program (being a cooking show.)
-   Stivi Paskoski as Johnny Arcade on the 90's video game show _Video Power_.
-   Today's presenters of CBBC and _Blue Peter_ are rather upbeat and adventurous; they create a fun atmosphere.
-   Holly Willoughby is today best known as a sedate matronly host of breakfast and morning television for ITV. However, in an earlier incarnation as a very possibly Over-Excited Kids Show Host on a Saturday Morning Kids’ Show, back in The '90s, she was invited to tender her resignation after some over-enthusiastic dancing to the resident pop group, whilst wearing a low-cut skimpy top. The consequent Wardrobe Malfunction enabled more Parent Service than the ITV bosses were comfortable with, and went on, in live television time, for an appreciable time before Miss Willoughby noticed things were amiss. Neither, seemingly, did the cameramen.
-   Almost any kids' game show host, ever, really.
-   Brazilian TV legend Xuxa of _Xou da Xuxa_, _Xuxa Park_, and many other shows worldwide. She often acts in a upbeat way and creates a fun atmosphere, often intensifying it with her musical numbers. The other networks followed suit and there are two still popular Alternate Company Equivalent cases in Angélica (who ironically went on to be hired by Xuxa's channel) and Eliana.

    Informative Over Sixes Host 

-   Current day Bill Nye, now a regular on the Discovery Channel.
-   _Newsround_ "Text in and tell us whether you think David Cameron should be Prime Minister!" is a bit like Type 3.
-   Though they fit into type 1, Nina from _Nina and the Neurons_ and Maddie Moate from _Maddie's Do You Know?_ on CBeebies present science shows - both informative and entertaining for children. These shows are presumably aimed at under-sixes, but older children and adults alike can learn something new from these shows, too.
-   _Blue Peter_ is sometimes similar.
-   CBBC presenters tended towards this in the days before they got the budget for a proper set; you can't really ham it up in a tiny continuity announcer's booth nicknamed "the broom cupboard".
-   _Mr Wizard_
-   The hosts of the Spanish and Portuguese language versions of _Art Attack_.
    -   And Neil Buchanan, who hosted the original version.

-   Marc Summers of _Double Dare_ fame. Bonus points for having actual clinical OCD about cleanliness and he still forced himself to host the show.
-   Linda Ellerbee of _Nick News with Linda Ellerbee_. She was chosen because she wasn't as overenthusiastic as the other auditioners.
-   Henry from _Amazing Animals_.
-   The Kratt brothers from _Kratts' Creatures_, _Zoboomafoo_, and _Wild Kratts_.
-   Peter and Dasha from the 1997 informative video _The Kids Guide to the Internet_. They like to tell you and their friends about the Internet.
-   Amy Mainzer from the interstitial segments of _Ready Jet Go!_. She can be quite energetic at times, but normally talks in a calm manner and never talks down to kids. She teaches a lot of neat science facts, and even teens and adults can learn from her segments.
-   Dr. Scott the paleontologist from the interstitial segments of _Dinosaur Train_. He treats the viewers with respect, is relaxed, and teaches cool facts about dinosaurs.

### **Parodies:**

    Films 

-   Highlighted in "Weird Al" Yankovic's movie _UHF_. George attempts to be a Type 2 host early on in the film and fails miserably. Then, in a moment of desperation, he lets Cloudcuckoolander janitor Stanley Spudowski host the kids' show... and the ratings immediately skyrocket.
-   Johnny Depp's take on Willy Wonka in Tim Burton's _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ is partially a spoof of how _unnerving_ these hosts can be.
-   _Death to Smoochy_ features cut-throat Depraved Kids' Show Host Rainbow Randolph trying to get revenge on the guy who replaced him, the much more sincere and sweet-hearted Sheldon Mopes, AKA Smoochy the Rhino.

    Literature 

-   Ronald Reagan is a Type 1 in _A World of Laughter, a World of Tears_, where he has a brief stint as the host of _The Mickey Mouse Club_ in The '50s. Trust us when we say It Makes Sense in Context.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_:
    -   The presenter(s) come across as presenting a kids show for adults/stoners. Clean living and polite human host? Check. Puppet supporting cast? Check. Bits and pieces between the film/actual content? Check. Mild villains? Check.
    -   Mike Nelson parodies Type 2 in Segment 3 of "Parts: The Clonus Horror", specifically spoofing Latin/South American kiddie shows like _Xuxa_. He also plays a much more low-key host at the start of the skit.
-   Chuckles the Clown, on _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_.
-   _Dead Ringers_ parodies this in one early episode where they replace _Dick & Dom in da Bungalow_ with (art critic and well-known snob) _Brian Sewell in the Stately Home_ and he retains some of the Zaniness but with fine art references and caviar. "Brian Sewell" used caviar in the same way Dick and Dom used Creamy Muck Muck although he used only finest silver teaspoons to fling it at people.
-   Wayne's brother Randall in _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_ was the host of a show called _Randy Rude the Science Dude_, which, obvious parody title notwithstanding, was more akin to _Beakman's World_ than anything. Wayne somewhat resented him for presenting science in such a lowbrow fashion.
-   _Bones_ had Bunsen Jude the Science Dude, who comes to the lab to invite Brennan to appear on his show. He winds up helping and is very competent, but takes time to explain everything he does, peppers his speech with mnemonic rhymes, and constantly declares things to be "Amazing!"
-   Not an intentional parody, but Charlotte Ritchie is routinely mocked for inadvertently coming across as one of these on her series of _Taskmaster_.

    Newspaper Comics 

-   Parodied mercilessly in _Garfield_ with Binky the Clown. Unlike Krusty, Binky seemed to simply, like most things in Garfield's world, genuinely _enjoy_ being annoying and grating to anyone - especially Garfield, when the two of them had reason to interact.
    -   The Buddy Bears - not only being a vicious The Complainer is Always Wrong spoof tends to talk down to other characters like a Type 1 host.

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   One of Andy Kaufman's stage personas was Type 1, in which he treated his adult audience as if they were children ("offstage", he was revealed to Hates the Job, Loves the Limelight). Andy hosted a children's show in Boston while he was in college, so he had that experience to build upon.
-   "The Uncle Freddie Show", on Bob Newhart's _Behind the Button-Down Mind_ album.
-   George Carlin and Jack Burns parodied '60s style kiddie shows (which were mostly Type 1) with the "hip" kiddie show, Cap'n Jack and Jolly George.

    Web Original 

-   Hilariously parodied in this "educational" Barats and Bereta video.
    
    _"Let's barrage ourselves with colours until someone passes out!"_
    
-   Brutally skewered in the short film _It's Oppo!_. It starts out like this but then gets flat-out terrifying.
-   The Professor from _Puppet History_ is a cute, upbeat blue muppet who portrays a real enthusiasm for teaching his subject of choice through a combination puppet skit show and game show laden with friendly trappings, such as awarding his "students" points in the form of jellybeans. However, those students are adults, and the Professor himself is a decidedly adult-adapted take on a _Sesame Street_\-like character, often exhibiting a temperamental personality that his guests aren't immune to and not shying away from cursing, brushing up against sexual topics, or portraying gruesome historical events in graphic detail, frequently with _pitch_ Black Comedy.
-   Uncle Jay of the aptly-named political podcast Uncle Jay Explains The News appears to have based his entire shtick off of 90s children's Edutainment shows while aiming the podcast at teenagers. While he usually acts like a Type Two, the teasing consists mainly of teenager-aimed jabs that would likely fly over the heads of children.

    Western Animation 

-   This was the exact reason they promoted Bart to co-anchor of "Kidz Newz" to Lisa's chagrin on that episode of _The Simpsons_ — he had "zazz" (exact wording, too).
    -   Likewise, Krusty the Clown is one of these in his TV persona but his real personality is that of a drinking, gambling, money grubber who seems to actually find most kids annoying.
        
        **Krusty**: LOUD!? _THAT'S OUR SECRET WORD FOR THE DAY!_
        
-   Baloney from _Animaniacs_, who remained upbeat WHILE BEING REPEATEDLY ANVIL'D. It got to the point in that episode where the Warners themselves got incredibly creeped out.

### **Exceptions:**

    Live-Action TV 

-   Fred Rogers from _Mister Rogers' Neighborhood_. Of course, he was going for "kindly guy on the block who reminds me of my uncle" rather than "cool random person who reminds me of my older cousin."
-   Raven from _Raven_ wouldn't be described as zany...overly intense perhaps, but not zany.
-   Canadian TV seems to favour quieter, more laid-back kid-show hosts: Mr. Dressup, The Friendly Giant, Fred Penner, etc. Note that Fred Rogers' first non-local show was Canadian, specifically on the CBC, and the better known PBS show used the same basic format.
-   Greg Lee on _Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego_ tended to be much more laid back and snarky than most other kids' show hosts.
-   One of the pioneers, _Captain Kangaroo_, was _very_ low-key.
-   Another pioneer, Sandy Becker, was _deceptively_ low-key. Well, for the most part, then he'd do something like Hambone...

    Western Animation 

-   _Moose and Zee_: The titular duo are both Under Sixes hosts, but Moose has a calmer temperament compared to Face and Piper O'Possum. Zee, on the other hand, doesn't speak at all, and she's meant to be an Audience Surrogate for the preschool audience.
