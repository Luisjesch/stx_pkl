_"Even I'm offended by this. And I'm a fat Southern sheriff."_

Some tropes reference things that _really_ should not always be Played for Laughs, but for some reason often are. One of the consequences of comedies using schadenfreude is that they can tread on subjects that are quite serious to some people. An attempt at a joke on such subjects can easily come across as insulting, offensive, or cruel, earning the reaction, "Dude, not funny!"

The academic terms "dark humor", "black humor", or "tragic farce" apply to some examples, although the exact execution is somewhat different. Black Comedy is not about making jokes at the expense of groups, but rather about using Irony and Fatalism to make them seem amusing while still showing their seriousness. "Dude, Not Funny!", on the other hand, is the reaction you get when a work attempts Crossing the Line Twice but only crosses it once. While black comedy may help people find humor in the midst of their suffering or misfortune, it's less helpful to laugh at the suffering _itself_ as comical since, well, it isn't.

The reaction can also come from using humor against Unacceptable Targets. The saying goes that comedy should "Punch up, not down": mocking powerful authority figures may be bold and edgy but mocking marginalized or oppressed people just makes you look like The Bully.

A "Just Joking" Justification is usually not much help here; the problem isn't that people didn't understand the attempt was intended as a joke but that they found the joke to be about something that's no laughing matter.

If something that _was_ funny falls into this following some related event in the real world, see Harsher in Hindsight. Also compare Distanced from Current Events, where an event's recency heightens the insensitivity.

The Politically Incorrect Villain is portrayed this way on purpose because Evil Has a Bad Sense of Humour and cracking a tasteless joke may be a good way to highlight this. It may also overlap with Comedic Sociopathy, in rather the same way that treating sensitive subjects callously in real life would overlap with actual sociopathy. Conversely, a villain who plays it with enough finesse may be considered Too Funny to Be Evil.

A gifted Insult Comic's skill largely depends on being funny enough to avoid this reaction while still being rude. Similarly, Cringe Comedy is intended to be so uncomfortable that the discomfort itself becomes humorous. Sarcasm Failure is when the situation is such that even the Deadpan Snarker knows better than to attempt a joke about it.

Compare Black Comedy, Refuge in Vulgarity, HA HA HA—No, and No Sense of Humor.

## In-Universe Examples Only:

-   _The Nostalgia Critic_

    open/close all folders 

    Advertising 

-   In the long running Geico commercial campaign, very bad news is invariably followed by the same good news. The deliverer of the bad and good news always says: "I saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico." Don't Try This at Home. And from the same company, "So easy, a _caveman_ could do it!" while a caveman stands nearby to take offense.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Birdy the Mighty: Decode_, after Tsutomu makes a crass crack about Birdy doing whatever she wants after the death of her guardian Tuto, she balls up her fist, swings at her own face, and switches places with Tsutomu, so he's the one getting socked.
-   _Buso Renkin_: On one occasion in the manga, Gouta makes a sarcastic joke about how they'd be able to save on food money if Kazuki stopped eating normal meals and instead just started draining people whenever he gets hungry. All-Loving Hero Kazuki is not amused by the comment and gives Gouta, who he had previously been putting up with, an intense Death Glare in response.
-   _Doraemon_: One of the shorts (which introduces the Memory Toast) have Nobita panicking over an upcoming exam, because he haven't studied for it. Doraemon then jokingly suggests using one of his gadget of the week to simply destroy the entire school or turn Sensei into an ape, and Nobita is _not amused_.
-   There are a couple of moments in _Excel♡Saga_ where Hyatt will include the phrase "sleeping like the dead". Given that Hyatt has a habit of dying very suddenly (though she comes back to life later), no surprise that Excel comments that it's not funny when _she_ says it.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Gildarts returns from a several-years-long journey and teases Natsu about his crush on Lisanna like he used to do. Natsu gets upset and informs him that Lisanna had died while he was away. Gildarts is shocked and apologizes. In reality, Lisanna wasn't actually dead, but neither Natsu nor Gildarts knew that at the time.
    -   Shortly after the Time Skip, Cana asks if anyone has seen Gildarts. Gray teasingly asks if she's getting lonely without him around (he's been an overprotective dad since he learned that he was her father), causing Cana to snap at him for saying this in front of Lucy, who recently learned that her own father passed away. Gray quickly apologizes to Lucy, but she takes it in stride.
-   In _Future Lovers_, when Akira learns that Kento's homophobic grandfather is still trying to set him up with women despite him and Akira being a couple, he jokes that Kento can solve this problem by waiting for his grandfather to croak. The very next panel shows Akira with a hand-shaped dent in his cheek.
-   _In This Corner of the World_: Suzu can't see the humour in the rest of her family laughing about the military police suspecting her of being a spy.
-   Kai in _Mobile Suit Gundam_ tends to hear "Kai, _enough!_" quite a bit when his sarcasm gets too black.
-   _One Piece_
    -   Nami gets mad when Luffy playfully mimics being frozen using flour while Usopp and Chopper laugh at it, right after he and Robin almost froze to death in a fight with Aokiji, who'd also frozen Zoro and Sanji's limbs for good measure.
    -   When Arlong's name is brought up, Brook makes a pun based off his name in front of Nami, with Usopp kicking him suddenly for it. Usopp explains briefly to the crew members who didn't know about Nami's past<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  about how her hometown was under the control of Arlong and how her adoptive mother was killed by him.
-   At one point in _Queen's Blade_, shapeshifter Melona impersonates Menace's former lover Anarista for a laugh, but since Anarista betrayed Menace and left her to be raped and killed, Menace is not amused and threatens to kill Melona if she ever does that again.
-   In _Rent-A-Girlfriend_, Kazuya visits Sayuri in the hospital, where they talk about Chizuru, Sayuri's granddaughter and the girl everyone thinks is Kazuya's girlfriend. During the conversation, Sayuri jokes about how she's going to die tomorrow, which horrifies Kazuya, until Sayuri says she was kidding. In response, Kazuya mirthlessly says, "Ha... Ha ha..." while thinking, "So not funny!" Part of the reason why this joke is particularly unfunny is because Chizuru and Kazuya know that Sayuri does not have long to live and she dies some time later, devastating Chizuru.
-   In _Rurouni Kenshin_, a group claiming to be Sanosuke's former military unit goes on a crime spree. When Yahiko hears that they have been leaving portraits of Sanosuke's beloved mentor/former captain (who Sanosuke last saw as a _severed head_ after he was executed) at the crime scenes, he jokes that maybe Sanosuke was involved after all and starts laughing. Kaoru hits him and tells him "There are good jokes, and there are bad ones!"
-   In one episode of _Sailor Moon_, when Usagi is concerned about her weight, Luna jokingly shows her a fat drawing of her in 6 months. Usagi is not impressed by this at all.
-   In one scene in _Spirited Away_, Chihiro is trying to refill a bathing vat for the stink-spirit and having a _very_ hard time doing so (which is hardly a surprise). Yubaba, who is watching from a balcony, can't help but laugh a little, but the toad-like bathhouse worker next to her who's also watching comments that he does _not_ think it's very funny.
-   _Steins;Gate_: Okabe repeatedly calls Ruka — who is undoubtedly the most effeminate character in the series — a dude several times (sometimes to remind even himself, other times to tell unwitting newcomers like Kurisu). However, it eventually stops being funny when Ruka uses D-Mail to make it so he was born female, and it drives Ruka to tears every time he says it afterwards. Justified in the sense that Okabe's Reading Steiner, along with the fact that Ruka looks _exactly the same_ as a girl meant he had no idea that Ruka's D-Mail actually worked, while to the others it just looks like he's making fun of her for no reason all of a sudden.
-   _Variable Geo_: Sexual harassment is never a laughing matter, especially when the girl they're doing it to has the innate ability to summon flames. So when Yuuki decided to 'get friendly' with Satomi, Satomi responded with her ultimate attack, which incinerated the ring and Yuuki along with it (at 21:09-23:03).
-   At the conclusion of the Duelist Kingdom arc in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, the gang is searching for Kaiba after his soul was restored following the defeat of Pegasus. Jounouchi, who's made it perfectly clear that he hates Kaiba due to his actions during the Death-T arc, jokingly suggests that maybe his soul died and went to the afterlife instead, leading Anzu to mutter "Not funny!" right behind him.

    Comedy 

-   As he recounts in his concert film _Delirious_, Eddie Murphy has been confronted by angry Stevie Wonder fans for doing blind jokes about Wonder.
-   During the question segment of _Them Idiots: Whirled Tour_, a senility joke causes the host, Reno, to crack a euthanasia joke. While the audience laughs, Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, and Larry the Cable Guy all stare daggers at Reno (though Larry starts visibly chuckling after a minute). Jeff then tells Reno to go stand in the corner and think about what he just said.
-   During his stand-up routine at the Academy Awards in 2022, Chris Rock told a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith regarding her hair, or lack thereof. Her husband, Will Smith, was not amused. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Comic Books 

-   Batman:
    -   _Death of the Family_: The Joker is engaging in Black Comedy once again, and it produces this reaction. Then again, you could count the number of times his form of comedy _did not_ produce this reaction with the fingers on one hand!
    -   One of the most famous examples is in _The Killing Joke_, where Joker gives a Motive Rant about how the world is so absurd and cruel, the only thing he can do is laugh at it.
-   In an _Andy Capp_ strip released in 2013, Andy meets a professor in the tavern who says he's studying phobias, who quickly points out that "ergophobia" is the fear of work, and laughs in Andy's face. Given Andy's reaction, he _really_ didn't think it was funny. (In the last panel, the bartender muses, "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing...")
-   When Obelix gets Taken for Granite in _Asterix and Obelix All At Sea_, Vitalstatistix, Unhygenix, Cacofonix and Fulliautomatix all stand around making morbid rock-themed puns in the manner of the standard _Asterix_ joke template of this kind. Instead, Asterix yells at them all that his best friend is dead and now is not the time, and Getafix agrees with the others not to make any more jokes in poor taste.
-   In one of The Beano annuals, Roger the Dodger reacts this way when a pair of newsreaders reveal that a meteor they claimed would hit Earth is actually going to miss the planet entirely... right after he'd just got rid of what he thought was it (actually a demolition ball snapping off a crane) with a giant flattened frying pan on a spring. However, Laser-Guided Karma quickly comes into effect when said demolition ball ends up crashing into their studio a few moments later.
    
    **Roger**: (_goes to see the stunned newsreaders on seeing the ball hit on TV_) Pleased to meteor, I'm Roger!
    
-   In _Empowered_, Oyuki impersonates Mind███. Ninjette tells her that's not funny. Given that Mind████ had died with Empowered unable to save her, if she had seen Oyuki, she probably would have had a Freak Out.
-   _The Transformers: Dark Cybertron_: Prowl smirks at the death of Chromedome's significant other, Rewind, as Chromedome's actions, under Prowl's direction, got Rewind killed. Chromedome throws him off a cliff for that.
-   _The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck_: In Chapter 8, Soapy Slick and all of his cronies have a good laugh at the defeated Scrooge, with Soapy humiliating him over his defeat. Soapy reads all of Scrooge's letters from home, causing everyone to mock him for being a Momma's Boy, and laughing over their misfortune. When Soapy reveals to Scrooge that his mother has died, and laughs in his face for it, everyone else quiets down and looks sorry for it all, right before the ensuing Mass "Oh, Crap!" over Scrooge's Unstoppable Rage.
-   In _The Pulse_, the New Avengers end up taking Jessica Jones to Doctor Strange so she can have a baby (thanks to the person in charge of a hospital freaking out and thinking Jessica was going to give birth to a mutant). When he mentions that he helped give birth to the Scarlet Witch's children, Spider-Man replies that it has to go better than that did. Strange and the Avengers side-eye Spidey before he realizes he just put his foot in his mouth, stating that it was so much clever in his head before he actually said it.
-   _Spider-Man/Deadpool_: Deadpool's Secret Santa gift for Clint (which he accidentally gives to his successor Kate) is a Fun T-Shirt reading "I killed the Hulk and all I got was this lousy T-shirt". Everyone else at the Christmas party finds the gift tasteless and kicks him out.
-   _Spider-Man_: In _The Amazing Spider-Man (J. Michael Straczynski)_ #522, Wolverine makes an inappropriate comment about Mary Jane. Spider-Man responds by punching the mutant through a window made of indestructible glass. After recovering, Logan grumbles that Parker can’t take a joke.
-   _Scooby Apocalypse_: When Shaggy thinks Scooby is in mourning because the chili dogs are rotten, Fred asks if a dog eating dogs is cannibalism and Shaggy replies with "Not funny, Dude". Fred later says the same thing word by word when Shaggy asks what's between him and Daphne other than Fred being a "serial proposer" but Shaggy argues that "Actually, it is".
-   Ultimate Marvel
    -   _All-New Ultimates_: Spider-Man makes a joke about Jersey, which was destroyed by Galactus in _Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand_. Black Widow tells him "Dude, too soon!".

    Fan Works 

-   Discussed in _Eleutherophobia_. Tom considers making a "who are you and what have you done with my father" joke in _The Day the Earth Stood Still_, and a sarcastic comment that he was never a good host in _Back to the Future_, but both times he stops himself because being infested by Yeerks has been a traumatic experience for his entire immediate family.
-   _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_: In "Papa Smurf & Mama Smurfette", when Papa Smurf and Smurfette announce that they're going to be married, most of the Smurfs laugh as if they think it is a joke. Polaris responds that he assumes that Papa Smurf and Smurfette are very honest and determined about this while the two look at the other Smurfs in distaste. However, the other Smurfs stop laughing when Empath calls out Papa Smurf and Smurfette for being in an relationship to the point of getting married...
-   Ino and Sakura are talking about Naruto in _Shards_ when Sakura starts making fun of him for being an orphan. Ino stares at Sakura and asks what is wrong with her; when Sakura tries to double down, Ino explains not only were Sakura's words needlessly cruel, but that Ino almost became an orphan herself, since her mother died in Kyuubi's attack and her father almost died of his wounds. Ino leaves in disgust, ending their recently repaired friendship right then and there.
-   In one _Harry Potter_ story, Harry and Sirius accidentally land in an Alternate Universe where they (and Voldemort) died but Lily and James Potter lived. When Sirius makes a joke that since Gabrielle drowned during the second task, Harry won't be able to hit on Fleur, Harry furiously tells him that Gabrielle was a wonderful child whose life he personally saved and her death means far more than not being able to date her sister.
-   Wocky and Apollo are horrified in _Dirty Sympathy_ when a radio announcer jokes about Klavier's near strangulation by saying that he should suck on ice cubes because he has another concert to perform.
-   In _The Stalking Zuko Series,_ Katara did not like Zuko joking that he'd rather get hit by lightning than do something else, once he was on the mend after his duel with Azula.
-   _Remembrance_: While Tyrion does correctly guess why Jon Snow is fighting in Daznak's Pit (he was kidnapped by slavers hoping to make a profit), he also jokingly theorizes that Jon Snow enjoyed his company so much that he considers fighting to the death just so that he can be in his presence Worth It. The looks he gets from everyone around him makes it clear that this is not the time for jokes.
-   Luna decides to sneak up and surprise Joker in _Lightning Among the Stars_. Harry rather sternly tells her it wasn't remotely funny as Joker (who has brittle bone disease) broke his knee hitting it against a console when he jumped in fright.
-   According to Scott in _A Third Path to the Future_, when Evan first joined the X-Men he tried making a joke about Kurt looking like the Devil. Scott came down on him hard for that as not only is such a comparison rather insensitive to begin with, but Kurt's a devout Catholic.
-   Defied in _Blue Belle_ when Cordelia makes a joke that Kendra's death "left \[them\] with the defective Slayer". Buffy insists she crossed the line but Cordelia fires right back that everyone in the room has joked about somebody's death; what difference does it make that this time it was someone they "kind of knew". The other Sirens admit that Cordelia does have a point.
-   In _The Mouse of Konoha_, Inoichi tries to tell Tsume this after she jokes that the Nara exist to be a legal alternative to necrophilia. It falls flat however as everyone else is laughing their asses off.
-   In _Vapors_ Naruto and Sasuke try to break the tension on a mission by teasing Aiko about the time she was kidnapped by Sasori. It only stresses her out more, because they didn't realize how close she came to dying or being vivisected into a puppet since she never _ever_ talks about what happened.
-   _Coreline:_ The "Fakehuggers" found in Legends of the Fourth of July (Coreline) are _made_ of this Trope. Designed to look and act exactly like a real Facehugger, right down to knocking out their victims and wrapping around their faces, they were intended to be a harmless prank. However, they instead resulted in some people having fatal heart attacks.
-   _Doing It Right This Time_: Asuka and Misato have this reaction to Shinji making a rather dark joke about seppuku in Chapter 3, though it's not so much the joke itself as the fact it's the known suicide-risk making it that sets them off.
-   _Fire Emblem Fates: Aftermath_: Takumi is not amused when Izana shows up, reveals that he faked his death, and proceeds to make jokes about it.
-   _Wednesday_ fanfic _Either Way What Bliss_: When Enid jokes about having scars now, Wednesday promptly tells her that this no laughing matter.
-   _Influenced Out of Normality_: When Tony Stark hears that Sunnydale doesn't even have an aquarium, he ponders how people survive growing up there. Xander (his son), remarks that most don't. Tony tells him he really shouldn't say that to his father who only hasn't taken him out of that deathtrap of a town on his wishes.
-   In _Of Princesses and Changelings_, Princess Luna chastises Princess Cadence for using a Fantastic Slur when talking about Changelings, noting that as both royalty and diplomats they must put aside any personal feelings while dealing with others.
-   Charles Xavier chews out several of his students in _One Way to Become an Ex-X-Man_ after a prank war culminates in them stowing Xander in the women's locker room just before all the female telepaths entered, then locking everyone inside with their telepathy forcibly turned on. They for all intents and purposes forced their teammates to rape someone who considered them a friend, all as part of a prank. It's later revealed that Xander avoided it by focusing on his other main fantasy of having a loving family. This still resulted in Psylocke raping him, though they're getting married.
-   In _A Year Too Soon_, Draco Malfoy starts to express his wishes that the troll had killed Hermione instead of just injuring her before being shut up by a Death Glare from roughly a third of Slytherin. For wishing death upon a fellow student, Snape gives him detention until the holidays and informs Dumbledore of his actions.
-   In _A Triangle in the Stars_, Bill falls victim to this In-Universe in Chapter Forty-Seven. Wendy tells a scary story, and Bill tries to help it by supplementing it with an image of the monster. He laughs. The others don't, and Connie calls him out, which confuses him for a bit.
-   One of the Beauxbatons students in _Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum_ jokingly threatens to reveal where Sirius is when she overhears Harry and friends talking about it. Harry and Luna both give her an Implied Death Threat and she learns later Sirius has a Kiss On Sight order out for him. She apologizes afterwards, admitting that she thought it was something minor rather than them harboring an escaped (but innocent) felon.
-   _Fantasy of Utter Ridiculousness_: Reisen has this reponse when Eirin gives her some herbs and spices from the kitchen to take with her, shortly after she'd just gotten done reassuring her subordinate that Reimu wouldn't turn her into rabbit stew for not safeguarding Megas's crew.
-   _If You Had This Time Again_, Darcy Lewis jokingly threatens to taze Tony Stark if he makes a move on Jane Foster. While Tony tries to play it off, both JARVIS and Jane are rather upset with her for brandishing a taser at a man who has an electromagnet in his chest keeping him alive. A strong electrical shock could very well kill him.
-   In _Where Talent Goes on Vacation_, after Azuki and Nagato read through the rules for the school trip, Azuki flippantly asks if the school expects them to start killing each other, only for Nagato to call her out on it, saying that she recalled a time when a student got stabbed at her old school. Azuki then apologizes, admitting that her comment was in poor taste.
-   In _Rosario Vampire: Brightest Darkness Act III_, Kokoa, in penance for accidentally turning Tsukune into a ghoul, swears loyalty to him and becomes his servant to regain her damaged pride. When Akua and Kahlua find out in chapter 6, they tell Kokoa and the others that, in order for Kokoa to truly regain her pride, she will have to be do whatever Tsukune says and be his slave in every sense of the word, including sexually... only to reveal they were only joking about that part; _nobody_ in Tsukune's group is amused.
-   _Maria Campbell of the Astral Clocktower_: The Third Prince informs the children who Maria rescued that Maria won't have time to come around to play any more, since a new knight agreed to take over their protection. All the kids cry... at which point he reveals that Maria was recently knighted and is officially taking them as her wards. Maria and Katarina yell at him for the cruel joke.
-   Downplayed in the Midsomer Murders fanfic _Surfacing_. When Ben wakes up in the hospital after nearly drowning, he finds both Tom and John Barnaby at his bedside. In order to check he's OK, Tom asks him what his name is; Ben cheekily answers "Jack Morris" (his undercover alias from _Last Man Out_, which John knows about but Tom doesn't).
    
    **John**: Still not funny. Change your answer before he has a stroke.  
    

    Films — Animation

-   In _The Sponge Bob Movie Sponge Out Of Water_, Plankton remarks, after he and SpongeBob were exiled from Bikini Bottom, that they could rename Bikini Bottom to "Dirty Bottom". SpongeBob's reaction is "...that's kind of gross, Plankton."
-   _The Lion King (1994)_ has Banzai complaining about the scratches Mufasa had given him and the other hyenas, while Ed (despite being thrashed earlier by Mufasa as well) laughs at him. Banzai tells him angrily that it's not funny. To be fair, though, Ed always laughs uncontrollably.
    
    **Banzai**: It's not funny, Ed.  
    **Ed**: _(laughs even louder)_  
    **Banzai**: Hey, shut up!
    
-   A deleted sequence from _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ reveals that we would have seen a multitude of Toons attend Marvin Acme's funeral. A gag would have focused on the pallbearers. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Goofy and Popeye would have shared banter about their duty, which Bluto, of all characters, considers inappropriate for the occasion. This would have led to a graveside fight among them.
    
    **Goofy**: Gawrsh, pallbearin's sure hard work, ain't it? A-hyuck!  
    **Popeye**: So we're bearin' Paul, huh? I thoughts we wuz bearin' Acme!
    
-   In _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_ while traveling to Peach's castle, Toad clears a path for himself and Mario by shouting that "This guy's brother is going to die imminently!” Mario is not amused by this, causing Toad to immediately backtrack and assure him Luigi will be fine.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The movie _Heathers_ had an example when Veronica's boyfriend J.D. cracks a joke at the funeral of two of their victims that they made look like a double-suicide and the little sister of one of the boys killed turns to look at them while crying. It's at that point that Veronica begins to realize how messed up she's becoming under J.D.'s influence.
-   _American Psycho_:
    -   Patrick pretends to be offended by a racist joke one of his associates tells, though he's actually a virulent racist himself.
    -   Patrick tells what he think is a hilarious anecdote about Ted Bundy. His colleagues are less than impressed.
-   In _Wag the Dog_, the movie producer shows his pet musician (played by Willie Nelson) a political cartoon poking fun at the President's sex scandal.

-   At the beginning of _Star Trek: Generations,_ the officers are having a promotion party for Worf on the holodeck, where they're on an 18th-century naval ship. They make Worf walk to the end of the plank and jump for his new rank insignia, then Riker shouts "remove the plank" — which is interpreted by the computer as a command to remove it from the simulation. As a result, the plank disappears, dropping Worf into the sea. Picard chides Riker, saying that he should have said "_retract_ the plank". After Crusher attempts to explain the humor to Data, he pushes her overboard.
    
    **LaForge:** Data!
    
    **Data:** _(smirking)_ That was...
    
    **LaForge:** ...not funny!
    
-   In _Tropic Thunder_ Alpa makes a crack about a "dingo eating your baby" to the Australian Kirk Lazarus, which he is so offended by he almost breaks character.
    
    **Alpa**: Why am I in this movie? Maybe it's because I knew I had to represent. They had one good role for a black man, and they gave it to "Crocodile" Dundee!
    
    **Kirk**: (_stops smiling_) Pump your brakes, kid. That man's a national treasure.
    
    **Alpa**: I just wanna throw another shrimp on your barby.
    
    **Kirk**: That shit ain't funny.
    
    **Alpa**: I'm just messin' with you, Kangaroo Jack. I'm so sorry a dingo ate your baby!
    
    **Kirk**: Y'know, that's a true story? Lady lost her kid. You 'bout to cross some fuckin' lines!
    
-   During the astronaut tryouts in _The Right Stuff_, Alan Shepard frequently mimics 50s comedian Bill Dana's Mexican astronaut character "Jose Jimenez", but it eventually gets on the nerves of Gonzalez, the Mexican orderly, who tells him "me and my friends think your Jose Jimenez imitation is A-OK. But what you're doing with it is B-A-D.".
-   In _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_, Kíli joked about orcs to a nervous Bilbo. Thorin immediately sternly lectures him on taking the matter so lightly. It's understandable why Thorin doesn't think it's something to be joked about, because orcs had overrun the dwarf kingdom Moria and killed many dwarves (including Thorin's grandfather) which Thorin had witnessed firsthand.
-   In _The House of Yes_, Jackie once went to a costume party as Jackie Onassis in the pink dress she wore when JFK was assassinated, complete with fake blood. Also, little bits of pasta she glued on the dress. Because a Jackie Kennedy The Day Of The Assassination costume would not be complete without little bits of brain. This trope was the reaction she got from the rest of the guests at the party.
-   In _Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story_, Bruce Lee and his girlfriend/future wife Linda go to see _Breakfast at Tiffany's_. Linda is shown laughing at the antics of Mr. Yunioshi until she sees Bruce is visibly unamused. This scene emphasizes how typically Asian characters were stereotyped at the time, and how Bruce would help change their image for better.

Kevin discovered Buzz humiliating him, punched him, disrupting the performance. Granted, the officious audience was probably not as harsh as perceived, to do that to someone let alone a child, is quite sadistic and unfunny. Thankfully, it did not scar Kevin and Buzz later apologized to him (later genuinely), Kevin accepted his apology.

        **Lex:** That's not funny.

-   In _Tremors_, teen Jerkass Melvin at one point pretends that the Graboid tongue that Earl and Val got (and then sold to Walter) became alive and grabbed him. Burt makes a point of telling Melvin, quite angrily, that he almost _shot him_ out of fright.
    
    **Burt**: You came _this_ close. Too close. No more games.

    **Newton:** BEN!
    
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:

It was always just a stupid joke to him, but Peter seriously thought there was a chance he could have been eaten.

        **Peter:** ...Not to me!

    Literature 

-   In one scene from Stephen King's novel _Christine_, a bunch of high school hoods are cruising and drinking beers after a school basketball game, and complaining that their team lost. At one point, one of the hoods compliments the athleticism of the school's basketball star (in one of those "The rest of the team sucks, but this one guy is a good player" sort of way), who just happens to be black. The leader of the gang sneers, retorting, "I hate that fucking spade." This prompts one of the newer gang members to make a racial joke, to which the rest of the gang reacts with this. Specifically, the gang leader says, "I said I hated _that_ spade. I got no problem with the rest of them..." and threatens to toss the "fucking bigot" out of his car at high speed. The new guy shuts up quickly.
-   In _Cold Days_, Harry jokes about having sex with Molly. Molly—having unrequited feelings for him—is not amused.
-   _Skippy's List_ has examples.
    
    93\. Nerve gas is not funny.
    
-   Nicko Heap in _Septimus Heap_ often gets criticized for this, having an habit of not understanding the seriousness of a situation.
-   In _Nineteen Eighty-Four_, the cinema plays horrid newsreel footage of refugees being murdered, including a woman and a small child. The audience laughs, except for a single prole woman who loudly objects to it, only to be carted outside by the police to whatever horrid Fate Worse than Death awaited her.
-   In _The Honor of the Queen_ Admiral Courvosier, while discussing the patriarchal nature of Grayson society with his (female) protégée Honor, jokes that the lack of women in Grayson's armed forces might be "a bit restful, now and then". Honor gives him a brief Death Glare, after which he admits that it "wasn't quite as funny as I thought it would be."

-   In _Wings of Fire_: _Moon Rising_, Moon reads Kinkajou's mind about hoping to tell Glory about Moonwatcher's mind-reading powers. Darkstalker suggests killing her and then says "Just kidding". Moon scolds him, and his response is "Too soon?"
-   In the novelization of _Revenge of the Sith_, Anakin reacts this way to Palpatine's manipulations at first.

More than once, he cautions Palpatine not to say such things in front of the Jedi.
-   In _The Serpent's Shadow_, Maya has to deal with catcalling Upper-Class Twit observers when trying to remove an inflamed appendix on a pregnant Irishwoman without excising the uterus, respecting her beliefs on the matter.

-   _Captain Underpants_: After Professor Poopypants is defeated in _Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants_, George exclaims "Let's all give Captain Underpants a big hand!" Harold, whose hand was accidentally enlarged a few chapters prior, glares at George who apologizes.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: Annala tells Eric about her grandfather, Nueces, who suffers from chaotic madness that makes him think he's being chased by squirrels. When it's especially bad, he thinks they are in his pants. Eric laughs when he hears this but Annala's stern glare quickly silences him. Chaotic madness is not the least bit funny and especially not among elves.
-   _Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes_: Actually used to argue that Carlton really was kidnapped instead of faking it to make the police search for him. Carlton has a habit of making tasteless jokes and pranks including pretending to be "twins" when he started school then pretended that one was kidnapped, but he would _never_ make any jokes about Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria because a friend of his died there and his friend's Trauma-Induced Amnesia was casued by it.
-   _Guardians of Ga'Hoole_: Primrose the pygmy owl suffers from a slug allergy (the slug was her dessert) and has to be taken to the hospital (or the owl equivalent of it). A Pure Ones spy named Ginger makes a joke that she can have the dessert now. Immediately, she gets Death Glares from Gylfie and Otulissa, who tell her off sharply about making jokes like that.
-   Due to being a Cute Ghost Girl, Rosalie in _I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level_ is very casual when it comes to talking about death and souls, something the others often find disturbing. Some examples include: being glad her death led to meeting Azusa's family, looking forward to getting a new friend if Halkara does get executed, and commenting that Azusa's soul shrunk too when she ate a mushroom that shrunk her to child size.
-   In _Shadow of the Conqueror,_ Lyrah and Cueseg regard each other's humor as offensive, especially when food, culture, or religion is involved. Him accidentally hitting her Trauma Button doesn't help things.
-   When the figure of the Red Death first appears in _The Masque of the Red Death_, Prince Prospero angrily denounces the "blasphemous mockery" of (what he assumes to be) a partygoer dressed up as a plague victim.
-   In _Emma_, Jane Fairfax is genuinely pissed when Frank—her secret fiance—encourages Emma's fanciful speculation that there must be a secret love between Jane and the unseen Mr. Dixon (the new husband of Jane's best friend, who is like a sister to her). It doesn't help that Frank is choosing to allay suspicion of their engagement by flirting with Emma.
-   _Ellen and Otis_: Invoked in _Otis Spofford_ when Otis cuts Ellen's hair and, rather than laugh, the class just stares at Otis. Otis even realizes right before he does it that he's going way too far; however, when Ellen calls his bluff, pride prevents him from backing down and he does it.
-   _Reign of the Seven Spellblades_: Katie brightly summarizes Nanao's detailed explanation on her Dark and Troubled Past that led her to become a Death Seeker after Oliver turned down her offer of a duel with the line, "Um... to sum up... you got all depressed because Oliver rejected you?"
    
    **Oliver:** Sorry, Katie, but could you shut up?
    
-   _The Left Hand of Darkness_: At a party in Orgoreyn, word gets out that their antagonistic neighboring country's ruler recently had a stillborn child, so someone toasts and wishes for all their kings to live as long.

    Live-Action TV 

-   One episode of _The Adam and Joe Show_ featured a parody of _Jam_, in particular the infamous dead baby sketch. In the skit, Joe plays a TV repairman who finds a "dead baby" (a cheap-looking doll) behind the set and says he will have to rape the corpse in order to fix the TV. Adam is horrified, refuses to film any more and storms off the set while Joe complains that it's supposed to be uncompromising and "you don't understand my genius."
-   _Not_ played for laughs in one episode of _All in the Family_. In the episode, Archie's boss has to lay off a worker, and tells Archie to recommend one of the guys he supervises. A smart man would choose "Stretch" Cunningham, the slacker who does nothing but tell jokes all day and never works. However, being the type of guy he is, Archie eventually does the stupid thing and lets Stretch keep his job because he's white, lays off the competent Hispanic worker, giving all sorts of lame excuses as to why, including that the other workers would hate him for choosing the other two over Stretch, and that he actually thinks the guy's jokes are good for morale. (Not that his family actually believes it.) In The Stinger, when he comes home from work, hours late and exhausted, he tells Edith, "You know that Stretch Cunningham? He ain't so funny."
-   Video compilation programs such as _America's Funniest Home Videos_ occasionally fall prey to this. A bicyclist flipping over a suddenly opened car door is only funny when it does _not_ result in serious injury; a toddler at the beach being entirely engulfed by a wave is only funny if the child is _not_ drowned or swept away.
-   In _Around the World in 80 Days (2021)_, the trio ends up in the company of legendary African-American lawman Bass Reeves as he's transporting a Klansman to justice while trying to stay ahead of the man's fellows, who are out to free him and murder Reeves. Reeves takes a moment at a pit stop to warn Passepartout (who is a Black Frenchman in this series) about the Klan. Passepartout starts to snicker incredulously at their name and the description of their costumes, but Reeves cuts him off to say that as stupid as they may _look_, what they _do_ is deadly serious and Passepartout needs to be on his guard if he wants to make it to New York in one piece.
-   _Babylon 5_: After an accident resulted in his friend being ejected into space, Dr. Stephen Franklin relates to a reporter in the episode "And Now For a Word" that he does _not_ find jokes about spacing others funny.
-   _The Baby-Sitters Club (2020)_: When Stacey finally confesses that she has diabetes and was worried that the club would make fun of her, everyone tries to comfort her and Kristy wittingly ponders if she's overreacting because her blood sugar levels are dropping. Claudia scolds her with, "Too soon."
-   _Bar Rescue_:
    -   If an owner or staff member is caught laughing or smiling at him during a rant, Taffer will read them the riot act.
    -   Taffer's initial reaction to the horse entering the bar in "Chilleen's" was concern for the animal (given how easily it could have injured itself amongst the chairs and tables), and disgust over the Road Apples it left behind.
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_: In "Blood on the Scales", Apollo tricks a group of mutineers by throwing a grenade with the pin still in down the hall. Starbuck, who thought it really was about to go off, tells him that it wasn't funny.
    
    **Apollo:** It would have been if you had thought of it.  
    **Starbuck:** No, still not funny.
    
-   In an episode of _The Bernie Mac Show_, when Bernie Mac convinced Jordan to fake an asthma attack to go to a Clippers game, guest actor Billy Crystal criticized Bernie's actions, emphasizing how he suffered from asthma as a kid and how it should never be used for nefarious purposes. Then Billy Crystal started faking an asthma attack to mess with Bernie's head.
-   _The Brady Bunch_: Peter tries to help Cindy with her fear of magic. When he and Bobby show her how the disappearing act works, Bobby decides to sneak out of the garage instead of reappearing. He thinks it's funny, but everyone else is mad at him for exacerbating Cindy's fear.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   When Robin Wood asks Buffy out on a date, he makes a joke about firing her if she says no, which he immediately regrets.
        
        **Robin:** I may have to make up a little document saying "I didn't just say that" and have you sign it.
        
    -   Xander, shortly after having an eye gouged out by Caleb quotes Giles:
        
        "No more fun and games, Xander."
        
-   _Canada's Worst Driver_:
    -   The fourth season featured a street-racing incident on the way to the Rehabilitation Centre. Since, being illegal, it could have gotten the entire franchise shut down on the spot, host Andrew Younghusband was _not_ impressed.
    -   Andrew is not impressed with Dale from Season 6 chasing him with a car. You read that right. He would later say it was the scariest moment of his time on the show.
-   Subverted in the _Castle_ episode "The Lives of Others"; Castle, stuck at home with a broken leg, becomes increasingly obsessed with what he thinks is a murder in an apartment across the street. When he sees the alleged killer pulling a knife on Beckett, he, Esposito and Ryan race to the apartment, where it turns out that Beckett staged the whole thing as an elaborate birthday surprise for Castle. When he finds out that there was no murder, he initially stands there in utter shock, muttering, "You made me think I was crazy?", and you can see the apprehension in Beckett's face as she worries that they may have carried this a bit too far. Finally, Castle declares, "This is... without a doubt... the GREATEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT OF MY LIFE!"
-   _The Chosen_: Played with when Jesus and His disciples spend the evening with Melech, a Samaritan who injured himself while robbing a Jew on the road. When Jesus indicates it's time to return to town before bad men and robbers start to lurk the roads, Melech and his wife stare at Him in disbelief, but a "too soon?" from Jesus lightens up the mood and causes the two of them to smile.
-   _Clarice_: Some of Clarice's fellow FBI agents prank her by putting some body lotion in her desk drawer, explicitly invoking Buffalo Bill's practice of making his captives use it, to her horror. Esquival apologizes for what they did since he knows this was completely wrong (it clearly triggers her PTSD).
-   _Community_:
    -   Abed pantses Troy, who pantses Abed back in retaliation — only to see Abed had anticipated it by wearing Goofy Print Underwear. Everybody laughs, then Shirley comes in, smiling "What's so funny?" Pierce says "This!" and pantses _her_. Everyone's horrified but Pierce, who laughs, "Get it?"
    -   Troy calls out Chang who referred to Troy and Shirley as "dirty".
    -   In _Intermediate Documentary Filmmaking_, Jeff is not amused by Pierce's attempt of a Mind Screw, in which he is made to believe his deadbeat father was coming to see him. He even makes it clear to Pierce that he will beat him to a pulp if he tries to make some kind of elaborate, _F/X: Murder by Illusion_\-style practical gag out of it. And when Pierce still does it on the third act, he barely manages to outrun an irate Jeff.
    -   In general, many of Pierce's jokes and shenanigans get this reaction.
    -   Subverted when Britta makes an inappropriate joke, and Annie is aghast.
-   _Control Z_: Quintanilla is attacked and humilliated by the avenger at his own farewell party, locked up in the men's restroom and stung by bees. Shortly after he is released and shows up before the gaze of the students gathered there, Darío jokingly remarks that "it must have been a _good_ poop", at which point they burst out laughing. Quintanilla lampshades this to Darío asking "You think you're so funny?", as he is visibly offended by the joke right before launching his "The Reason You Suck" Speech to them and outright making an angry Screw This, I'm Outta Here.
-   _CSI_: The episode _Loco Motives_ features as one of the killers of the week an impressive example of a Lethal Klutz that had killed his wife and a Nosy Neighbor completely by accident (and he got stuck in cement up to his waist and was mugged while trying to dispose of his wife's body... and on his backstory he'd also accidentally run over and crippled his daughter, the day after he'd given her a puppy). Katherine cannot stop herself from giggling at how much the absurdity of the situation Crosses the Line Twice, but Grissom remains melancholic and gives a Schiff One-Liner about how ugly living with such a kind of luck must really be that sobers her.
-   _Doctor Who_: In "Tooth and Claw", Queen Victoria is NOT amused by the Doctor and Rose's playful antics while there's a werewolf running amok and killing people. How much "not amused"? She exiles them from Great Britain (Rose is especially miffed because she's a native _and_ she's being kicked out of the country long before she's been born) and orders the creation of the Torchwood Institute to deal with the Doctor if/when he ever appears again.
-   In an episode of _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_, Geoffrey unveiled his hidden shame of leaving England, because years ago, he was caught taking a taxi in order to win a marathon (he thought the information might ruin Philip's political campaign, and yes, that marathon thing has happened in real life, albeit accidentally). After showing them the video, everyone sat in silence for a good ten seconds before bursting into laughter. Geoffrey was not amused.
-   _Friends_:
    -   In the episode "The One with the Girl who Hits Joey", Chandler has a fight with Monica, and proposes to her out of guilt. Monica says no, and the rest of the gang teases Chandler:
        
        **Joey:** Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?  
        **Ross:** No, I will not!  
        **Joey:** Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.  
        **Ross:** You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?  
        **Phoebe:** Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.  
        **Rachel:** Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?  
        **Chandler:** Okay, how long is this going to go on?  
        **Monica:** Well, I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.  
        **Ross:** This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? _(nobody laughs)_  
        **Chandler:** That's not funny.  
        **Joey:** That's not funny at all!  
        _(they all get up and leave Ross)_
        
    -   Downplayed but still implied during Chandler's job interview. He aces it until he makes a "poo" joke, befuddling the interviewer and ultimately costing him the job.
    -   "The One with the Birth", when Rachel jokes about a taxi charging for each contraction during labor, everyone looks at her like she made a tasteless joke.

Shortly after Chandler picks a better joke and moment where everyone laughs, reminding Rachel to pick her spots more carefully.
    -   In the alternate universe episode, Phoebe in this timeline is a successful stock broker, but the stress of her job causes her to have a heart attack.

After saying she'd "Pay anything" to speak to Charlie again, Sophia pretends she's channeling Charlie's spirit to get money from her. In the process she convinces Rose "Charlie" is unhappy with Miles being with her, and Rose almost breaks up with Miles. When Dorothy realizes Sophia's tricked Rose, she flat out calls her a horrible person and orders her to come clean. Rose is absolutely furious when Sophia admits she lied, both for mocking Charlie and practically ruining things with Miles before asking just what is wrong with her.
-   _The Great British Bake Off_: The competitors usually go along good-naturedly with the hosts' comic asides at their expense, but when Mel attempted to joke with Paul the prison governor about "taking security measures" in series 6, he immediately clammed up, looking extremely uncomfortable even as she tried to apologize.
-   In the season 3 premiere of _Happy Endings_, the gang is laughing at a video of Penny falling down the stairs, when Penny (who is in a half-body cast due to the accident), finally gets fed up with the mockery, and tells them it's not cool — she actually died for two minutes on the ambulance on the way to the hospital. They immediately stop after hearing this.
-   In one episode of _Home Improvement_, Jill wants Tim to get a vasectomy, because they both feel they're done having children, and he's nervous about it.

It's later revealed that Harry is so quick to defend Tim because _he_ has had a vasectomy, and doesn't want Tim to be discouraged by dumb jokes about the procedure.
    -   The three kids cracked on their father all the time, but one such wisecrack was met not with canned laughter, but instead Tim pushing Randy's head back so that he could meet his father's stony, unamused glare:
        
        **Randy:** (squeaking) ...Over the line?  
        **Tim:** _Way_ over.
        
    -   Discussed in one episode where Jill's dad dies, and as the family prepares for the funeral Randy keeps cracking bad jokes. Tim talks with him and says he understands that the joking is a coping mechanism, and advises Randy to save the jokes for him because he won't be offended by them.

One guest's vocal cords were damaged due to a botched surgery, making him speak in a squeaky voice. The host started laughing, losing even more composure as the in-show segment continued. The guest understandably got upset, even more so when an audience member admitted to almost losing his voice from the same procedure.

        **Neil:** Oh, that is bang out of order!  
        **Will:** What?! After everything he's said?!  
        **Simon:** Yeah, well, some things just aren't okay!
        
    -   In an episode about a school trip, Jay, jealous of Neil impressing the classmates by getting a lorry driver to sound the horn, tries to one-up him. Jay's attempt? Waving sweetly at a bus full of old ladies before showing them rude hand gestures. Neil laughs. The others are not amused.

Now some kid is pinning her murder on one? Have you ever heard a more made-up name than 'Kilgrave'? I mean come on. Give me a break." The clerk laughs at the guy mocking the silliness of Kilgrave's name, causing Jessica, herself a fellow victim of Kilgrave, to glare at him and say, "What, are you trying to drive customers away with that shit?"
-   A recurring skit in _Late Night With Seth Meyers_ is a segment where Seth Meyers talks about a few jokes that were written before the show, but due to him being a straight white male, may not be able to properly tell.

-   In the "Infected" episode of _The Last of Us (2023)_ Joel announces that he will shoot Ellie if she so much as "twitches". Ellie chooses that moment to gag and choke dramatically and cross her eyes. Tess, Joel's partner, just gives her a "Don't" with a side of Death Glare.

The woman, named Gwen, shares Munch's conspiracy theorist tendencies, as did the suspect, although Gwen appears to be slightly mentally ill and has mentioned that she is thinking of going back on her medication. After Munch is able to find out what he needs to know about the missing suspect, Fin makes a crack about Munch "hooking up with loony lady" before Munch tells him Gwen is his ex-wife.
-   In-universe on _Law & Order: UK_. While investigating the murder of a boy whose remains were found in the basement of his building, Matt and Ronnie track down the man who was one of the prime suspects, thanks to the then-detective's belief that All Gays Are Pedophiles. 20-something years later, the man is still bitter and angry about the prejudice he faced, leading him to sarcastically confess to killing the boy. At this, Matt snaps, "That's _not_ funny, Mr. Connor."
-   _Madam Secretary_: "Catch and Release" has Jason come running down the stairs crowing about how the US "just _lit up_ Jihadi Judd,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  BOOM!" Henry, knowing it was a Shoot the Dog call and that Liz had been asked by the guy's mother to save his life, is furious and sends him to his room.
-   In an episode of _Married... with Children_ where Al gets a circumcision by mistake, he warns everyone when he comes home NOT to ask him "What's up?", saying that the nurses and doctor at the hospital asked him that several times, and he did _not_ find it funny. (Bud and Jefferson do not hear this warning, unfortunately, and they learn not to say it the hard way.)
-   _The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel_:
    -   In-Universe. At her wedding, Midge ends her speech by saying they put shrimp in the eggrolls, to the horror of everyone present, since they're all Jewish. Her father doesn't help by arguing with the rabbi that shrimp aren't explicitly banned.
        
        **Abe:** Show me where it says that Jews can't have shrimp!  
        **The Rabbi:** Leviticus 11:12 "Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is a detestable thing unto you."  
        **Abe:** THAT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT SHRIMP!
        
    -   In season 2, Midge offers to help her B. Altman coworker Mary with her wedding. During the reception, Midge does a toast that starts with light jabs, which become increasingly uncomfortable as she begins making tasteless jokes about Catholics, culminating in her joking that it must be a Shotgun Wedding because of how little time has passed between Mary meeting her fiance and them getting married... seconds too late to realize _that's exactly what it is_.
-   On an episode of _M\*A\*S\*H_, Hawkeye pantsed Winchester while they were in the OR. No one laughed and Hawkeye was vilified by the camp for it. It's revealed later in the episode that BJ was in on it but played dumb because of how bad it went. The finale had Colonel Potter reveal that he also found it funny but had to keep up appearances.
-   _Mimpi Metropolitan_: After Bobby is revealed to be the one who accidentally caused Soleh's heart attack via a Deadly Prank, but is quickly forgiven by Soleh's wife, Alan tells Bobby that if he is Soleh's son, he would pray for Bobby to get the worst punishment Bobby could have... and tells Bobby he was just joking. Since Bobby is really afraid of retribution from Soleh's family, he is not amused.
-   In an episode of _The Mindy Project_, Mindy is going through a lengthy and argumentative questionnaire with her love interest/frenemy Dr. Castelllano (who is recently divorced because his wife had an affair). When he checks that she isn't planning to have kids because she's not married or in a serious relationship, Mindy says "Yeah, but when I do get married, I'm gonna stay married, unlike you". Danny's response is to list a terrible hypothetical life Mindy is going to have, step by step. He never says he's upset by what she's said-because he doesn't have to.
-   _Misfits_: Jess gets quite upset when Finn tells her about how his uncle raped him as a child, then admits it was a joke to "lighten the mood". Naturally she doesn't find it funny _at all_.
-   The _Monk_ episode "Mr. Monk is On the Air" has Howard Stern-style Shock Jock Max Hudson mock Trudy's death right after Monk brings it up in conversation. Even Max's toadie sidekicks consider this too far, give their condolences to Monk, and also try to stop Max from making said joke... just a little bit too late to prevent Monk from trying to beat him up in a rage. It also more firmly convinces Stottlemeyer and Disher that Max is guilty of murdering his wife.
-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_:
    -   The "Musical Mice" sketch has a performer get on stage, introduce his musical mice, then starts making them sing... by hitting them with wooden mallets. The audience immediately reacts with shock and disgust, and he is swiftly forced off the stage and chased outside.
    -   One sketch, in which an undertaker suggests cannibalism as an alternative to interment or cremation, ends with the studio audience storming the stage in disgust (which is part of the show). Apparently, it was written in due to Executive Meddling on the part of the BBC — they wouldn't allow the sketch if the audience was to approve of it, so the Pythons suggested that instead of laughing, the audience react violently to appease the censors. This works just as well.
-   In _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, it's not uncommon for Joel, Mike, Jonah and/or the Bots to do something a little over the top and get chided for it.
    -   At the end of _Santa Claus Conquers the Martians_, Joel shushes Tom Servo _twice in a row_ when Tom's riffs start getting a little too dark.
    -   A well known one was in _Riding With Death_ where Mike and Tom get tired of Crow's Double Entendre quips.
    -   Mike and the Bots end up apologizing for a _very_ racist scene in _The Wild World of Batwoman_. Equally, Crow gives a stern "thank you" for a stereotypical Asian tune in _The Skydivers_.
    -   Jonah actually pops Tom's head off and tosses it away after he gets carried away with an Overly Long Gag in _Starcrash_.
    -   When Tom nearly dies from his head exploding in _Star Force: Fugitive Alien II_, he responds by making a joke. Joel is not pleased with this and Crow suggested they should have just let him die over that.
    -   In _Santa Claus (1959)_, Tom takes great glee in mocking each and every one of the bad stereotype country children, much to Mike and Crow's horror. Probably helps that the first country/continent we see is Africa, which is portrayed as black kids dancing around hitting drums and wearing bones in their hair, which causes all three to groan out in despair.
    -   In _The Beast of Hollow Mountain_, Jonah and the bots are unamused that the film's comic relief takes the form of an alcoholic absentee father who is mourning the death of his wife.
-   _MythBusters_: This was Adam Savage's reaction to taking the full force of an electric fence device across his body. He'd been tricked into it by the Build Team, at the urging of a producer. After this incident, the producer was dismissed from the show. This was also likely one of the motivations for (original BT member) Scottie Chapman leaving the show.
-   _Never Have I Ever_: When Devi says she wishes the Nazis killed Ben, she's rebuked for it by the principal, as not only isn't that funny, but Ben's Jewish (so even worse). She apologizes.
-   _Paper Girls_: After Mac makes remarks over KJ being from a rich banking family (she's Jewish) the latter tells her that's inappropriate and she cites the Holocaust for evidence why. Mac protests this isn't like that, but KJ tells her she's had antisemitic graffiti put on her locker before so this kind of attitude hasn't yet gone away, and Mac's mollified by this. Mac later apologizes, and KJ invites her with their friends to her bat mitzvah.
-   In _Power Rangers in Space_, Zhane had a habit of making jokes at inappropriate times, but one time _really_ took the cake. In the episode where Psycho Red, Psycho Black, and Psycho Yellow were finally defeated and it appeared they had finally seen the last of the Psycho Rangers which was sadly, wishful thinking, as it turned out someone who appeared to be Psycho Red ambushed Andros. It was actually Zhane, who was wearing a copy of the villain's costume to try to scare him. Andros did _not_ think it was funny.
-   _The Price Is Right_: On one episode of the syndicated night-time series in 1976, host Dennis James yelled out "THERE GOES FRITZ" after the contestant lost at Cliff Hangers when the mountain climber when tumbling over the cliff, not realizing that model Janice Pennington's husband Fritz Stammberger had disappeared while mountain climbing in Afghanistan. This upset Janice so much that she ran off and remained backstage crying as she did not appeared on camera for the rest of the episode.
-   _The Punisher (2017)_: Curtis Hoyle is telling Billy Russo about Lewis Wilson's living conditions, trying to convince Russo to not hire Lewis to work at Anvil. Namely, that Lewis is sleeping in a foxhole in his backyard and nearly shot his father. On the latter, Russo quips "God I've always wanted to do that," causing Curtis to give him a cold look. Russo attempts an awkward laugh to break the tension, but ultimately concedes to Curtis's request. It also foreshadows the later reveal that Russo has a very fucked up childhood of his own.
-   _Queer Eye (2018)_: In an episode involving the makeover of a cop, the nominator (who is also a cop) plays a joke on the Fab Five by pulling them over as they drive into town, then revealing who he is. Mostly they laugh it off, but Karamo (who was driving) is not amused, and later has a heart-to-heart talk with the cops about how frightening that kind of thing is for a black man. Karamo and Tan also threatened to quit immediately afterwards, and almost did.
-   _Ramez in Control_ is a notorious prank show that receives a lot of criticism for its disturbing pranks. These include making people think they were being attacked by sharks and making Paris Hilton think the small plane she was on was going to crash (the pilot was an actor who started flying the plane erratically and claimed he was losing control, and one of the other passengers who was in on it was a trained skydiver who jumped out). When the prank was revealed, Paris angrily threatened to kill them, and many of her naysayers are on her side.
-   _Reservation Dogs_: Willie Jack's contrite after making a crack about Jackie's brother and learning he killed himself, trying to apologize. Jackie doesn't accept though, saying to watch her back. She's forgiven however after offering one free punch to Jackie.
-   In the _Robin of Sherwood_ episode "The Time of the Wolf" one of Gulnar's warriors, who worship the mythical Norse wolf Fenris as a god, jokes that the stores of food in the abbey they've seized "should keep the wolf from the door". The other men burst out laughing but stop abruptly when they see the Death Glare Gulnar gives them. Apparently even an evil sorcerer and leader of a murder cult won't tolerate blasphemy.
-   _Scrubs_
    -   In "My Heavy Meddle" JD hears from his mother that his favorite former schoolteacher Mr. Peters has died. When Turk asks if JD is okay, JD responds that he's doing a lot better than Mr. Peters. In the same episode, after JD arrives home and announces he's going to bed. Turk asks Elliot, JD's ex, if she's going with him. JD and Elliot both give him an annoyed look, which makes Turk realize that it's way too soon.
    -   In "My Best Friend's Wedding", Jordan and Perry decide to sleep through Carla and Turk's wedding ceremony and arrive the reception, Jordan suggesting to Perry that he should just say the ceremony was beautiful. Because of this, they don't know that Turk missed the ceremony completely, so when Perry compliments Carla for the ceremony, she gets offended believing Perry was joking about it.
    -   In "My Jerks", JD makes a joke about sending some annoying interns to an _intern_ment camp. Turk tells him that internment camps are _never_ funny.
    -   In the episode with Colin Ferrell, Billy and the guy he knocked out play a prank on Turk and JD. Billy pretends to have knocked the guy out again and when JD goes over to check on him, he pops upright, scaring JD so badly that he screams and falls over. JD is not amused.
        
        **JD:** Oh, you think that's funny, do you? Well, good, because YOU'RE DYING!  
        **Guy:** _\[panicked look\]_  
        **Turk:** _\[disapprovingly\]_ John Dorian, you are a doctor!  
        **JD:** Well, he started it!
        
-   In _Supernatural_, conversations between Sam and Dean tend to use this trope a lot, with Sam protesting Dean's use of Gallows Humor.
    -   In _Faith_ \[1.12\], when Dean believes he is about to die, the dialogue directly echoes this trope:
        
        **Dean:** Hey. You better take care of that car. Or I swear I'll haunt your ass.  
        **Sam:** I don't think that's funny.  
        **Dean:** Aw c'mon, it's a little funny.
        
    -   In _Fresh Blood_ \[3.7\]:
        
        **Sam:** You know what, man? I'm sick and tired of your old stupid kamikaze trick.  
        **Dean:** Whoa. Whoa. Kamikaze? I'm more like a ninja.  
        **Sam:** That's not funny.  
        **Dean:** It's a little funny.  
        **Sam:** No, it's not.  
        **Dean:** What do you want me to do, Sam, huh? Sit around all day writing sad poems about how I’m going to die? You know what, I've got one. Let’s see. What rhymes with 'Shut up, Sam'?
        
    -   In _My Heart Will Go On_ \[6.17\] after a victim of the week, whose a personal injury lawyer, gets hit with a bus with one of his ads on it:
        
        **Dean:** Sam, check it out (points to the ad).  
        **Sam:** (Gives a Disapproving Look)  
        **Dean:** What, too soon?  
        **Sam:** Yeah Dean, I'm pretty sure six seconds is too soon.
        
-   _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_: When John weasels out of doing the laundry by getting Cameron to do it, she gives a completely human reaction by giving a Death Glare indicating that she is _not_ amused.
-   _The Thick of It_:
    -   Steve Fleming takes over during Malcolm's 10-Minute Retirement, and he delivers what may be the worst New Era Speech in history, describing all the beleaguered politicians, aides and civil servants as "emerging from the cellar, pleased that the beatings have stopped, scared of what the future may hold." Every single one of the characters listening to him was visibly appalled, despite enduring abuse from Malcolm and each other on a daily basis.
    -   Olly Reeder makes a tasteless joke about special needs children...in front of Glenn, who has a son with special needs. Even Hugh is appalled, and lets Olly know in no uncertain terms that he's crossed the line.
        
        **Hugh:** You just took a shit with your pants on, Olly. Glenn's boy, Peter, goes to a special needs school.
        
-   This occurs during the tenth season of _Trailer Park Boys_, where Ricky screws up with Lucy and J-Roc made it worse with an needless comment.
-   The Stinger of every episode of _The Vicar of Dibley_ consists of title character Geraldine telling a joke to Alice, and then usually trying to explain why it's funny after Alice doesn't get it. In a variant used in one episode, she tells a Black Comedy Rape joke where Superman sees Wonder Woman apparently sunbathing nude and using his Super-Speed to have sex with her without her reacting, only for it to turn out she was already in the middle of consensual sex with the Invisible Man. Alice gets the joke but doesn't think it's funny and storms out after telling Geraldine she should be ashamed of herself for impugning Superman.
-   In the episode of _The West Wing_ where Leo McGarry dies of a heart-attack, Senator Vinick (the opposing presidential candidate) and his campaign staff watch the news reports. One of them makes a tasteless crack about how Leo, who had plenty of health problems, was only the Democratic vice-presidential candidate because the Democrats "thought he had a few thousand more miles left in him". Vinick, who is genuinely affected by news of Leo's death, doesn't say anything but sends her a cold Death Glare that clearly indicates how little he thinks of her at that particular moment. The staffer shuts up quick.
-   On the American edition of _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_, Colin Mochrie frequently gets mocked for being bald and/or Canadian. In one sketch, when he made a joke about Ryan Stiles' nose, the audience booed him even though moments earlier, they applauded Ryan for a joke about Colin's head. After the sketch, Colin said "Notice all the melon jokes, the bald jokes? I make _one_ nose joke, it's OOOOOOOHH!".
    -   One playing of "Let's Make a Date" ended before it could begin due to Drew making a crack about how Greg Proops would be unlikely to be chosen as the "bachelor" if it wasn't for the stage directions. Greg brings the game to a halt by asking Drew what the point would be if he was not likely to be chosen. The other performers and the audience then begin to pile on Drew until the director steps on-stage and kills the segment. Drew subsequently apologizes (and hugs) Greg, at which point the jokes resume.
    -   It's also Invoked for one "Scenes From a Hat" game where the performers have to say things that make the audience boo them.
        
        **Jeff Davis:** Okay, so we leave the potatoes simmering. Now after you fillet the baby seal...  
        _(audience boos)_
        
-   _The Wire_: Carcetti finds out about McNulty's invented serial killer. As he's processing, his aide Norman Wilson is trying not to laugh at the ridiculousness of the scheme:
    
    **Tommy Carcetti:** So, um, let me just...understand this. Um...so I've been going out there for weeks, slamming the governor for his neglect of the homeless and declaring at how we will stop at nothing to find the person responsible for preying on the homeless, (_Norman, who has been trying valiantly not to laugh, loses it_) and all — hey, Norman, this is my ass here!  
    **Norman:** (_pulling himself together_) That's true, boss. But it does have a certain charm to it. They manufactured an issue to get paid; we manufactured an issue to get you elected governor. Everybody's getting what they need behind some make-believe.
    
-   In an episode of _Workaholics_, Ders gets this when he offers to fire people for Jillian (acting boss while Alice is sick).
    
    **Ders** It's not that hard, give me the list, and I'll Schindler those fools right now.  
    **Blake:** I don't think you want to say that.  
    **Adam:** So inappropriate.  
    **Ders:** I never saw the movie.  
    **Adam:** It's a tearjerker. Morgan Freeman, Jack Nicholson. They have a whole list that they need to Schindler before they die.  
    **Blake:** Well, that's Bucket List.
    

    Podcasts 

-   _The Last Podcast on the Left_
    -   The narrators have been able to laugh at and crack jokes about a ton of serious, heavy subjects, even when it's incredibly irreverant, but absolutely none of them were able to make light of the case of Junko Furuta, an innocent teenage girl who was abducted at random and tortured to death in an unbelievably gruesome way over 44 days by a group of teenage boys.
    -   The hosts regularly discuss dark topics like serial killers and cults and treat them with all the respect they feel the people involved deserve: None. That changes when the discussion goes to the _victims_ of these people. For example, in their Children of God series, jokes about the cult's founder being a Dirty Old Man pedophile fly freely, but in the final part, when the main topic is a man raised in the Children of God's sexually abusive environment who went on to murder one of his abusers then kill himself, the number of jokes drops sharply and they express sympathy as they refer to statements he made before the act showing he knew what he was going to be doing.
-   _Rifftrax_:
    -   The Rifftrax for the movie _Glitter_ has Mike make a joke about Eric Benet's sex addiction. Mary Jo doesn't think there's anything funny about sex addiction and keeps trying to explain this to Mike as he keeps making more jokes about it. Eventually she gives up, which is for the best since there aren't many other places to go when making jokes about Eric Benet.
    -   In the Rifftrax for _Star Trek: Generations_, Disembaudio keeps declaring "BUY MORE RIFFTRAX" during Kirk's death scene with Bill joining in as well. This is vastly different from when they deal with Picard's breakdown over the death of his mother and brother.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Ed Ferrara's "Oklahoma" parody of Jim Ross. It goes from jibing about BBQ sauce (JR has his own brand) to making fun of his Bell's Palsy. It pissed off Jim Cornette so much that he flat out slapped Ferrara across the face and Ferrara refuses to defend it.
-   The "Pillman's Got a Gun" incident, where "Stone Cold" Steve Austin attempted to break into Brian Pillman's home, only for Pillman to pull a gun on him _and_ curse on live TV while threatening to kill him.

-   During a feud against Samoa Joe, D'Angelo Dinero mocked Joe's obesity by showing footage of two pigs mating and claiming that he was showing Joe and his wife. Nobody was amused.
-   Matt Striker, in his gimmick of an obnoxious teacher who insults the intelligence of the audience and other wrestlers, once made a reference to the death of Steve Irwin (the day after he died, which should have never okayed the segment), saying he wouldn't be stupid enough to go swimming with stingrays. Vince McMahon immediately released a public apology on WWE's website.
-   Drew Gulak's Campaign For A Better Combat Zone was the most hated group in CZW because Gulak argued the need for change by bringing up CZW wrestlers whose lives had legitimately been ruined, such as Nick Gage.
-   Lord Tensai (Albert/A-Train) did a short video on Tout where he was riding in a car with his Japanese manager at the wheel and yelled at him to "open his eyes". Not very tasteful (WWE had to apologize for that too).

-   From 2005 to 2006, WWE would air a segment called _Lunchtime Suicide_, where referee Tim White would attempt suicide, only to botch it. This segment was derided for being in poor taste, with the first segment airing only weeks after the death of Eddie Guerrero.

    Puppet Shows 

-   In one episode of _The Muppet Show_, Fozzie makes the joke 'What do you get when you cross the Atlantic with the Titanic? Half way!" Waldorf thinks it's funny, but not Statler — he was ON the Titanic when it sank! (And, according to Waldorf, still has the dress he wore to get on a lifeboat.)
    
    **Fozzie:** _\[to Kermit, backstage\]_ Just my luck, a Titanic survivor in the audience!
    

    Theatre 

-   In _Fangirls_, Brianna has this reaction to the 'joke' Jules' boyfriend texts about the abduction of the lead singer of True Connection ("One down, four to go"). Even though the joke is in extremely poor taste, she is even more upset about Jules pretending to find it funny.
-   In _Jasper in Deadland_, most of the dead citizens don't mind jokes about death:
    
    **Gretchen:** ...But don't be surprised when we find your friend, if she's having too good a time to leave, 'cos I'm telling you, this city is unplugged like _life support!_  
    **Jasper:** That's not funny.  
    **Gretchen:** It is when you're dead!
    

    Video Games 

-   _Mass Effect 2_: Just before Commander Shepard's crew board the Heretic Geth station during Legion's Loyalty Mission, Joker mocks Legion when it's not looking by mouthing its words and making robot arm gestures. Shepard comes over and gives him a Disapproving Look, prompting him to make an "Okay, okay!" gesture and get back to work.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_:
    -   During the mission on Sur'Kesh, the party crosses paths with a rampaging yahg. Shepard and Garrus can't resist the opportunity to crack jokes about the last yahg they encountered, which teammate Liara T'Soni replaced as Shadow Broker after she and Shepard killed him. Liara is not amused:
        
        **Shepard:** Careful, there goes the next Shadow Broker.  
        **Garrus:** Could've sworn he was muttering "T'Soni!" the whole time.  
        **Liara:** Not funny!
        
    -   Done seriously later when Joker cracks a joke about the asari after their homeworld, Thessia, falls. Shepard usually lets those kinds of jokes slide but, in this case, they're at their lowest point and blames themselves for the fall of Thessia, so they proceed to snap at Joker. Joker, on the other hand, points out that he knows exactly how serious the situation is: His family was probably killed already when Reapers hit the colony they live on. On a more general scale, most of Joker's jokes appear not to be funny to anyone but himself.

-   _Dragon Age II_ has lots of snarky dialogue options (usually the one in the middle) which tend to involve cracking jokes at very serious situations. Sometimes your party members or NPCs will tell you that they're not funny, but there's a few examples of Hawke realizing that himself/herself mid-joke:
    -   An attempt to reassure Anders about having accidentally given himself a Superpowered Evil Side by saying "What's the worst that could happen? You turn into an abomination and start... Never mind. Bad joke."
    -   "You were going to kill a lot of people anyway? That's...not funny at all, really."
    -   Hawke gives this out to Carver at one point. After s/he's been snarking at him during an argument, he tries to snark back, implying that s/he's indirectly responsible for the death of their sister, Bethany. Hawke immediately drops their fun demeanor and gets noticeably angry.
        
        **Carver:** Sure, make light. We all know what happens when someone leaves big brother/sister's protection.  
        **Hawke:** Fair is fair, but you are taking this little pissing match _too far!_
        
    -   An example of Hawke being called out on this:
    -   On very rare occasions, Hawke is on the giving ends of these, such as when trying to convince Fenris to join them with Bethany present in the group. Bethany will answer his suspicions with a joke about going crazy and murdering everyone, to which Hawke will reply "not now.".
-   _Tales of the Abyss_:
    -   Guy is surprisingly afraid of women for the first half or so of the game, since every time a woman comes into close contact with him, he recoils in fear or starts screaming.

His sister and the maids from his childhood home threw themselves onto Guy to protect him as they were all killed by invading soldiers, and when Guy came to, he was smothered in a pile of dead female bodies. Nobody was laughing after _that_, and the female half of the party have a collective My God, What Have I Done? reaction over how they were treating the subject.

        **Tidus:** Yeah. But you're still bigger.

-   One quest in _World of Warcraft_ has this conversation between two characters at its conclusion, in which one character tries to joke about the serious situation, and the other is less than amused:

    **Clubnik:** Sure, I hear ya. Howsabout a... Memorial Fuel Depot? It'll be very tasteful!
    
    **Malynea:** Clubnik? I hope you die. In a fire.

-   On the subject of the Riddler, one of his patient interview tapes in _Batman: Arkham Asylum_ has him share his interpretation of the Riddle of the Sphinx with Dr. Young. She's horrified at his reply, though the reasoning he offers showcases his sociopathy front and centre.
    
    **Riddler:** What is it that walks on four legs, then two legs, and finally three legs?  
    **Dr. Young:** A human being. As a baby it crawls on four legs, as an adult it walks around on two, and in later years it uses a cane.  
    **Riddler:** _\[laughs\]_ Good try, but the answer to all three is a baby. True, it crawls on all fours, but cut off its legs and it can only wiggle on two limbs. Give it a crutch and it can hobble around on three. You see?  
    **Dr. Young:** That's horrible. How can you even joke about that?  
    **Riddler:** Easily, Doctor. It's not my baby.

-   In _8-Bit Theater_, Fighter calls this on Black Mage shortly after Black Belt's death.

-   In _True Villains_, Mia makes an offhand comment about being a vampire, which makes Bayn sober up and tell her not to joke about them.

-   The Inappropriate Timing SpongeBob meme mocks this trope. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Protectors of the Plot Continuum_:
    -   Meta example: The writer who had originally claimed _Sweet Apple Massacre_ gave up because there was just no way to make the mission funny — for those not in the know, that fic is a Not Safe for Work _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fic wherein a character replacement of Big Macintosh does unspeakable things to the Cutie Mark Crusaders. And more to the spirit of this trope, the disastrous in-universe sporking of the fic in question also gets this treatment whenever it's brought up by Rayner, who was one of the survivors of the so-called "Killer Mac Incident". Even his Jerkass partner, E.V.L., flat-out refuses to make snide comments about said incident, partly because her telepathic connection with him gave her access to the traumatic memory of the mission itself, which directly led to the death of his previous partner.
    -   In "The Gods Must Be Crazy", Backslash openly derides Lapis' severed hand as a liability and refuses to let her join the other agents on their pending mission because of it. Since the events that led to Lapis losing her hand were almost as traumatic as S.A.M., and could've easily led to the loss of her life if it hadn't been for a bout of Power Incontinence, this strikes a nerve with her to a far greater extent than he thought. Her partners are quick to call Backslash out on this, and he himself agrees with them.
-   _Binder of Shame_: Al Bruno III walked away from a _Dungeons & Dragons_ game when he realized the DM (Psycho Dave) had transported the group to WW2 Germany and expected them to help Hitler.

-   From _The Onion_: "Circus Train Wreck Not Funny, Investigators Emphasize" is an article about an incident where a train wreck resulted in the injury or death of various circus performers and animals, with investigators stressing that there isn't anything remotely amusing about their suffering or their inept attempts at mitigating the disaster.

    -   Episode 13 reveals that Yui's death was an attempt to "humanize herself through clever witticisms", but Kirito did not find it funny in the slightest, even calling her out on it.
        
        **Kirito:** Okay, sweetie? I'm gonna let you in on a little-known secret of comedy: _bad things aren't funny_ when they happen to Daddy.  
        **Yui:** What about Mommy?  
        **Kirito:** _(without skipping a beat)_ Oh, Mommy's fair game, go for the throat.
        
-   The _Smosh_ video "If Video Games Were Real 2" has a clip explaining they removed a _Bomberman_ clip because "terrorist jokes aren't funny".
-   When _Retsupurae_ made fun of _I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream_, they handled the attempted rape scene by having Diabetus pretend not to know about it, then get angry and threaten to leave when he "learned" that slowbeef had just tried to trick him into making fun of rape.
-   In an Achievement Hunter video on _Black Ops 3: Zombies — Shadows of Evil_, Ryan Haywood is trying to compare one of the game's guns, the Shiva, to the M1A1, but forgets the name and somehow ends up asking "What's the 9/11 that everyone loves?" This causes the rest of the AH crew to call him out on it.
-   When Kyle Kallgren reviews _Mister Lonely_, he gets to a scene near the end where the Marilyn Monroe impersonator hangs herself. Ven comes in singing Elton John's "Candle in the Wind", about the death of the real-life Marilyn Monroe, and Kyle is _not_ amused.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_:
    -   Yami and Joey rib on Mai while they duel the Big Five possessed Tristan.
        
        **Yami Yugi:** 5 guys in one body, eh? Sounds like a typical day for Mai Valentine, am I right?  
        **Joey:** Yug, she's in a coma!  
        **Yami Yugi:** Am I right?  
        **Joey:** It's just very inappropriate.  
        **Yami Yugi:** But am I right?  
        **Joey:** YUGI!  
        **Yami Yugi:** JOEY!  
        (beat)  
        **Yami Yugi:** AM. I. RIGHT?
        
    -   When Mai pretends to have never woken up from her coma, everyone thinks that she and Serenity went too far on Joey there. Even Yami.
-   The creators of _Bad Call TV_ changed the facts on a person dying because instead of seeking medical help their associates instead tried to employ faith healing by making it about a man dying of a seizure and his friends being idiots... instead of a small child dying of pneumonia while their parents prayed for them to get better.
-   _Epic Rap Battles of History_:
    -   The rap battle between Stan Lee vs Jim Henson has the two mostly boasting and good-naturedly sniping at each others' careers until Lee suddenly threatens to put Henson "out to pasture like Mr. Hooper". Henson (and Kermit) respond with a Jaw Drop and the music stops in response. Lee immediately walks it back and apologizes to Henson, showing that even he thought the line was beyond the pale.
    -   As one of a series of short videos on suggested Epic Rap Battles, Epic Lloyd of ERB rejected "John Wilkes Booth vs. Lee Harvey Oswald," because even though there was a clear theme to it, it just didn't seem fun or appropriate.
-   The _Hardly Working_ episode "Wacky Hijinks from 80s Comedies Were Mostly Rape" involves Pat, Trapp, and Zac trying to come up with ways to prank Emily and Murph using pranks from 80s comedies, only for Pat to realize that the majority of them are at best non-consensual spreading of nude photos, and at worst, straight up rape.
-   _Final Fantasy VII: Machinabridged_: When Cloud is rendered catatonic from Mako poisoning, the doctor monitoring him starts making jokes at his expense. Cid and Yuffie yell at him and say that was inappropriate.
-   _LegalEagle_ once mentioned a lawsuit between a pair of neighbors, where the loser of the case was quoted as saying "She won, and I hope she spends every dollar on chemotherapy". His reaction to this was nothing more than a completely humorless and shocked "_JESUS!_"
-   In one _DanTDM_ video, Trayaurus pretends to die for April Fool's Day. When Dan figures it out (and after Trayaurus spells it out for him), he is _not_ amused, especially after Trayaurus asks if he thought it was funny.
    
    _I'm gonna get you guys SO BAD!!!_
    
-   _Internet Historian_:
    -   He frequently dips into this, when talking about various internet raids and the like. Often he'll admit to finding something pretty funny initially, like calling for /b/lackup to block the pool in _Habbo Hotel_, baiting slacktivists into mistaking Carl Weathers for Joseph Kony so they can call them racists, using Twitter to put messed up things on large convention screens, or taunting Cracker Barrel for firing Brad's wife, but will cross into this territory when people inevitably take the joke way too far and begin calling actual real-life pools and telling them the water is infected with Aids, doing the Carl Weathers joke on official Kony 2012 forums, attacking the convention hosts directly and hacking their webhost, or just beating the Brad's wife joke into the dirt to the point it just became obnoxious.
    -   And one he didn't find funny in the slightest, was when Digornio Pizza's Twitter tried to make light of #WhyIStayed, an _anti domestic abuse hashtag_, to try and make a cute joke and push their brand.
        
        "Here comes Digornio, throwing on the accelerator, no fucks given, driving right through the front door. '#WhyIStayed You had pizza' (Rimshot). _Ugh..._"
        
-   In _SMPLive_, this is Connor's reaction when Schlatt starts laughing at the Eat Pant Conar statue again.
    
    **Connor:** Are you talking about the... Stop! It's not funny!
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: In the Grand Finale, Aang, having been told that he must kill Fire Lord Ozai, says he can't go around wiping out people he doesn't like. Sokka responds that he can because he's the Avatar and Aang angrily tells him that this isn't a joke.
-   _Batman Beyond_: "Out of the Past" opens with Terry taking Bruce to a Batman-themed musical for his birthday. While Terry is enjoying it, Bruce _really_ hates how the musical pokes fun at his crime-fighting career.
    
    **Bruce:** You hate me, don't you?
    
    **Terry:** Come on, lighten up, it's your birthday.
    
    **Terry:** Hey, it took me weeks to get tickets to this show. It's shway!
    
    **Bruce:** Its schw-arbage.
    
-   _Camp Lazlo_: In "S is for Crazy", Samson gets his brain fried by a jellyfish and starts acting crazy. In the beginning, Scoutmaster Lumpus initially goes along with his antics but eventually stops finding it funny when he falls in a vat of pudding his bed was nailed over, and finds a salt-melted Slinkman. He even tells Samson "You're fun when you were crazy, but now you're just crazy!" after he continues to laugh.
-   _The Crumpets_: In "Shake It Up", Ditzy stops smiling and gives a worrisome look at her infant brother Li'l One, who is being laughed by the other siblings because he wishes to move to his parents' bedroom and have only their mother, and Triceps is about to throw Li'l One.
-   _Daria_: Jane and Daria collaborate to produce a portrait of a pretty and happy-looking girl looking into a mirror with the caption reading, "She knows she's a winner, she couldn't be thinner, now she goes in the bathroom and vomits up dinner." Their art teacher immediately reprimands them for making fun of someone suffering from an eating disorder, but they rebuttal by saying that it's not meant to be funny and was actually pointing out the dangers of conformity through the most shocking way possible. After some deliberation, their teacher accepts the portrait for what it is and enters it in the school contest. Later, when Principal Li and Mr. O'Neill try to change the message into something more approachable and mellow, Jane and Daria are not happy.
-   _Drawn Together_: Spanky Ham once laments the existence of a cell filled with stereotyped "Red Indian" animated characters, noting that poking fun at them isn't funny and they "got a raw deal" as people. To put this in perspective, he's fine with laughing at the racist stereotypes of black people, Asians and Mexicans in other cells.
-   _The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants_:
    -   No one likes the comic George and Harold use to mock Erica.
    -   George and Harold themselves have this reaction to Diddlysaurus's idea for a prank; slipping laxatives to the entire school faculty, then locking all the bathroom doors so they couldn't get in to use the toilet.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show_: At one point, Ed and Eddy fall into a pit of quicksand and seemingly sink to their deaths in front of Double D... but it turns out that they were just pulling a prank on him. Double D is understandably pissed at them for it, furiously chews them out, and gets in a fist fight with Eddy before deciding to return home and face the kids' wrath, declaring he'd rather accept the consequences of his actions than wander aimlessly with a "so-called friend" like Eddy.
-   _Fairly OddParents_: In one episode, Timmy summons the April Fool to help him get back at everyone who's ever pranked him. Wanda has this reaction to the Fool's mean-spirited pranks from the start, but Timmy thinks they're funny enough... at least until one of the Fool's "pranks" almost horribly kills his parents, at which point he breaks off the deal and states the trope name almost verbatim.
    
    **Timmy**: Dude, you're not being funny. You're being harsh!
    
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   "Death Has a Shadow" has a cutaway gag of the Griffins watching _Philadelphia_. Peter recognizes Tom Hanks in the movie and, thinking he is playing a comedic role, says out loud that every line of his is pure gold. Hanks' character says, "I have AIDS." which prompts Peter to laugh uncontrollably while the other moviegoers glare at him.
    -   "The Kiss Seen Around the World", an attempted invoking comes when teenager Neil Goldman (Jewish pharmacist Mort Goldman's socially awkward, annoying son) is humiliated and plans to jump off the roof of city hall. Quahog 5 News anchor/reporter Tom Tucker is assigned to cover the breaking news. As police are trying to talk Neil down, Tucker takes his cameraman aside and discusses what to do if a fatal jump is recorded on tape: add cartoon-type "object falling" sound effects, along with humorous commentary in an attempt to amuse the audience. Before it is invoked, Meg (who had a crush on Tom throughout the episode) overhears Tucker and his cameraman talking and tells him that what he plans on doing is wrong.
    -   "Back to the Woods": After James Woods steals his identity, Peter takes revenge by stealing Woods's identity and ruining his career. He does this by stating on David Letterman's show that he's working on a comedy based on 9/11 called _September 11, 2000-FUN!_. The entire audience gasps at this, and Letterman says, "That sounds unbelievably offensive to Americans." The film, Peter claims, focuses on a window washer who sees the plane coming toward him while he wipes the window of the Twin Towers and exclaims, "Aw, c'mon!"
        
        **Peter**: And the voice of the plane is David Spade.
        
    -   Invoked again by Mayor West in "Brothers & Sisters":
        
        **Mayor West:** Oh, by the way, I should tell you that I've got AIDS.
        
        **Mayor West:** Yeah, they're right over there waiting for me.
        
        **Aides:** Ready to go when you are sir.
        
        **Mayor West:** Poor guys, they both have AIDS.
        
        (Cutaway to Live Action)
        
    -   And this moment from "Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q."
        
        **Joe:** It's an intervention.
        
        **Peter:** Now's a perfect time to tell my jokes.
        
        **Lois:** Peter!
        
        **Peter:** They can wait 'til later.
        
    -   The opening to "E. Peterbus Unum":
        
        **Peter:** Okay, here's another riddle. A woman has two children. A homicidal murderer tells her she can only keep one. Which one does she let him kill?
        
        **Brian:** That's...that's not a riddle. That's...that's just terrible.
        
        **Peter:** Wrong! The ugly one.
        
    -   _The Simpsons Guy_ has Stewie prank-calling Moe and tells him "Your sister is being raped.", and Bart looks at him with a disturbed look at his face.
    -   In "It Takes A Village Idiot and I Married One" Stewie angrily rips into Peter over his impersonation of a woman with postpartum depression. It probably didn't help that he was holding Stewie's head underwater as he was doing so.
        
        **Stewie:** You son of a bitch! Don't even _joke_ about that!
        
-   _The Flintstones_: In "A Haunted House is Not a Home", Fred is set to receive an inheritance from his not-all-there uncle, Giggles, who had passed away and who in life was fond of practical jokes. However, there is a catch: Fred must spend the night in his uncle's creepy estate to receive the inheritance, or the inheritance will be null and void. What's more, if anything were to happen to Fred, then the inheritance will revert to Giggles' staff, including his butler, his chef, and his gardener. As one might expect, the staff then try to get Fred (and by extension, Barney, who agrees to spend the night with his friend) killed so they can claim the inheritance. As a result, Fred and Barney must endure the night eluding the attempts on their lives, not helped by either the rather creepy-looking portrait of Giggles on the wall, whose eyes seem to move or very maniacal laughter that sets Fred and Barney's hair on end. They survive, however, and they explain to their wives all that has happened. Evidently, the creepy laughter appears to be coming from the creepy picture, at which Fred throws a vase to shut it up. To everyone's surprise, however, it's not actually a painting — it's the actual Giggles, alive and well. He had faked his death as a prank, which his staff was in on. It seems that the joke was a test to see if Fred was worthy of receiving the inheritance, admitting that he is a kook: "But a _rich_ kook, don't forget that!" What's more, he wanted to see if Fred had a sense of humor like he did. In response, Fred, who is so not amused at all that has happened, smiles dementedly as he admits that he, too, is a kook ("Not rich, but still a kook.") and then takes out a _huge-ass_ cleaver and chases his uncle and his staff out of the mansion, cackling insanely, with Wilma, Barney, and Betty all cheering Fred on.
-   _Futurama_: In "Obsoletely Fabulous", Bender says he's scared of the Robot 1-X. Leela breaks out laughing, while Fry, Amy, and Professor Farnsworth shoot her Death Glares.
-   _Gravity Falls_: "The Legend of the Gobblewonker" has Grunkle Stan interrupt a proposing couple with a joke ending with "It's funny because marriage is terrible." They are predictably not amused and leave immediately in disgust.
-   _Justice League_:
    -   The episode "Kid's Stuff" has Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern magically transformed into kids. Batman remains the closest to his adult counterpart, composed and grim, while the others are hyper, childish and sometimes a danger to themselves or others. When changed back to normal, Wonder Woman light-heartedly comments that it was nice being a kid again. Batman responds "I haven't been a kid since I was eight years old<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ."
    -   In "The Doomsday Sanction," when Batman questions what's to stop Superman from Jumping Off the Slippery Slope, Superman quips, "Well, there's always that kryptonite you carry around," only for Bruce to snap that Superman _does not_ get to joke about that after he essentially took a bullet for Superman.
-   _Kaeloo_: This happens so very often with Mr. Cat's "jokes" that "That's not funny!" may as well be Kaeloo's catchphrase. It happens even more often in the French dub than the English one.
-   _Mission Hill_: One episode has a customer of Ron's Waterbed World claim their bed just spontaneously broke and, when told by Andy that their beds don't break like that, presents proof in the form of an amateur sex tape of he and his wife. Watching the tape, and noting how the couple finished at the exact moment the bed broke, Andy remarks "Okay, the bed broke. But you gotta admit, the timing was pretty great!" The customer is _not_ amused.
-   _My Gym Partner's a Monkey_: In the episode "The Hyena and the Mighty", Adam is trying to give a report on an oil spill and how it harmed wildlife, but the titular hyena's laughing and Jake's mockery of the situation do not make him happy. For frame of reference, Adam's report mentions that millions of animals died in the spill; but Jake is joining the hyena's laughter by mocking the animals for being dirty. Adam's expression is a good representation of this trope.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   Some of Rainbow Dash's pranks are seen as this by the other ponies. For example, In the episode "Luna Eclipsed", she shocks Pinkie Pie with a lightning cloud. Not only did it scare her, Spike was startled and dropped his candy (in a pose that implied he was choking). Twilight Sparkle scolded at RD for her prank. But it's perfectly fine for Luna to do the same to Dash.
    -   In "The Mysterious Mare Do Well", Rainbow Dash says there’s something wrong with the baby she just rescued: “She’s not cheering for everyone’s favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!” Afterwards, Dash gets distracted by the paparazzi and casually tosses the baby to her mother, who doesn’t look too pleased by such carelessness.
-   _Rick and Morty_: "Promortyus" features Rick and Morty escaping from a planet of body snatchers. They gleefully destroy parts of the city as they're leaving, only to find themselves flying toward a pair of skyscrapers. They both go silent and slowly fly around it without harming either, instead choosing to destroy some ships in a harbor. They later explain to Beth that they're okay with "doing a Pearl Harbor" but not "a 9/11".
-   _Robot Chicken_:
    -   One sketch had a young kid dressed up as Iron Man follow the real Iron Man to a big fight in the city. The Avengers mistake the kid for the real Iron Man and throw him into battle, causing him to get fatally injured and accidentally taking down a giant robot by jamming its motors. The kid is given an iron statue to honor his sacrifice, when Iron Man makes this joke:
    -   In a sketch where Anakin Skywalker is carrying the body of his deceased mother in the scene from _Attack of the Clones_, as he walks in front of Owen, Beru, and Padmé, Owen whispers something to them both, causing them to burst out laughing, resulting in this exchange.
    -   This is revisited in a later sketch with Owen and Beru being interrogated, and killed by stormtroopers in _A New Hope_ by being burned alive. Before they're killed, one of the stormtroopers gives them a message from Darth Vader, saying that they may now laugh at the Little Orphan Ani joke, causing Owen to say that it was funny then, and funny now. Owen continues this trope until his death.
        
        **Owen**: Well, Beru, people always said we were a hot couple.  
        **Beru**: You know Owen, you really are an asshole.
        
-   _Rocket Power_: In the episode "Radical New Equipment", Twister makes a comment about a group of handicapped snowboarders that leaves the rest of the crew in shock.
    
    **Twister:** Squid, don't worry. You're not the lamest snowboarder on this mountain anymore.  
    **Reggie:** Twister, harsh!  
    **Otto:** That's not cool, man!  
    **Sam:** I can't believe you said that, dude!
    
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "King of the Hill", After McBain snaps a Commie-Nazi pilot's neck in a TV movie despite the latter surrendering, Marge quips "Now, that's what I call 'breakneck speed'." Bart responds by coldly telling her that a man just died.
    -   In "Cape Feare", Bart doesn't find McBain's _very_ politically incorrect talk show funny either, with Lisa saying "The Fox Network has sunk to a new low."
    -   In "Insane Clown Poppy", a flashback to where Krusty was performing for Gulf War soldiers at a USO show had him mocking Saddam Hussein by calling him "So Damn Insane". A soldier then calls him out saying he's fanning the flames of hatred — a bit hypocritical, since at least one of the soldiers is there precisely to _kill_ Saddam. In the same episode, Homer's tasteless joke about the late Maude Flanders also elicits an appalled reaction<small>◊</small> from everyone in the family, including Bart himself.
    -   In "My Mother The Carjacker", as Homer is chasing after the car taking his mother to jail, the driver stops the car to tempt Homer and speed off when he gets close. The other man in the car complains that the guy is losing his mother, but when the driver asks if he can do it one more time, the other guy admits it's Actually Pretty Funny and allows it.
    -   In "Round Springfield", "Bleeding Gums" Murphy tells Lisa (via flashback) how his own mentor Blind Willy Witherspoon tried to give him his saxophone, only for Murphy to tell him it was an umbrella — meaning that Willie had been playing an umbrella for thirty years. When Willie asks why no one told him, Murphy chuckles and says, "We all thought it was kinda funny!" Willie's reply is, simply, "That's not funny."
    -   In "Burns' Heir", Bart is watching _The Itchy and Scratchy Show_ with Burns; at first, Bart laughs like he always does at Scratchy's violent, gory murder. But then, Burns starts to enjoy it a little _too_ much. Bart is noticeably creeped out.
    -   In "Love, Springfieldian Style", during the "Homer and Marge re-enacting Bonnie and Clyde" short, at one point Homer and Marge enter a theater where a _Woody Woodpecker_ Captain Ersatz short is being played. Even Wiggum is offended at the excessive (although (unfortunately) somewhat period-accurate) racism towards Mexicans (and their food) playing on screen.
    -   In "King-Size Homer", Ralph's jokes about Homer's weight get this response from Lisa, who insists that Homer's not a gluttonous monster because he's obese. Cue Homer driving past in a stolen ice cream van stuffing down a popsicle.
    -   In "I Love Lisa", Krusty holds his 29th Anniversary Special and shows a clip from the 1960s of poet Robert Frost reading for him on his show:
        
        **Frost:** (_reading_) "He will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow..."
        
        (_Krusty pulls a cable, dumping a pile of snow on Frost_)
        
        **Frost:** (_pause_) We discussed this, and I said no.
        
    -   In "The Last Temptation Of Krust", Krusty tries to perform at a comedy club and everybody is aghast at his horribly outdated and racist material.
-   _The Smurfs (1981)_: At the ending of "The Purple Smurfs", when all the Smurfs have been cured of their illness, they hear another Smurf's voice yelling "Gnap! Gnap!". Expecting an uncured Purple Smurf, Papa Smurf and some of his fellow Smurfs run towards the voice... only to find out that Jokey Smurf had just pranked them. The other Smurfs are not amused, and throw him out off the village as a result.
-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_: In "Crisis Point", Tendi has this reaction the further they get into the movie. Mariner wrote her into a sexy Orion pirate role, something she has been trying to avoid in her Starfleet career. Then, during Mariner/Vindicta's assault on the ship, she seems to be having too much fun slaughtering holographic versions of real people, which causes Tendi to bow out.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   In "Fools in April", SpongeBob pulls several harmless pranks to various people at work during April Fools' Day. Squidward quickly begins to find the pranks increasingly annoying, so in an effort to put an end to them, he sets his own, far more sadistic prank for SpongeBob—which involves him stepping in a snare trap, flung/smacked all around the Krusty Krab, _sliding through Bubble Bass' rear end_, and landing into a trash can after a fall from the ceiling. SpongeBob is far from amused and runs out of the Krusty Krab in tears as the on-lookers walk out, disgusted by Squidward's cruelty.
        
        "April Fools...jerk!"
        
    -   "Ripped Pants" provides the page image. One of SpongeBob's many, many stunts involving comically ripping his pants involves pretending to drown at the beach. The beachgoers, who were already getting sick of his "ripped pants" schtick all desert him in disgust.
        
        **Sandy:** That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! You had us all worried sick!
        
        **Scooter:** \*shakes his head in shame\* Dude...
        
        **SpongeBob:** Let's see,
        
        Lifting weights = Big laugh
        
        Frisbee in the face = Kills
        
        Surfing = Knocks em dead
        
        Pretending to drown = Noooooo...
        
    -   In "One Coarse Meal", Mr. Krabs discovers Plankton has a phobia of whales and begins using such to his advantage, disguising himself as Pearl and tormenting his rival to the point of attempting suicide by being run over by a bus. SpongeBob, despite being rivals with Plankton as well, is not happy at Mr. Krabs's plot and calls him out for it, but he doesn't listen.
        
        **SpongeBob:** Mr. Krabs, I know you and Plankton are sworn enemies and all, but... Putting on a dress to frighten him?! Isn't that taking it a _little_ too far?
        
    -   In "Demolition Doofus," SpongeBob's latest failed driving test lands Mrs. Puff in the hospital with a ruptured inflation sac, ensuring she'll never puff again. Rather than apologize or show any remorse for hurting her, SpongeBob instead tries to lighten the mood by cracking jokes about her situation; unsurprisingly, Mrs. Puff does _not_ take this well.
        
        **SpongeBob:** From now on, I guess we'll have to call you Mrs. _Pop_! \[_laughs_\]
        
-   _Steven Universe,_: "Too Far" revolves around this trope. Steven has to tell Peridot that by joking about how Amethyst is "defective", she really hurt Amethyst's feelings. Peridot realizes her mistake and apologizes.
-   _Superman: The Animated Series_: In the Origins Episode "The Last Son of Krypton", Clark tells Lana that weird things have been happening to him, such as being able to see through walls. Lana asks him if he's been using this ability to peek into the girls' locker room. Clark is genuinely freaked out and in no mood for jokes; Lana apologizes when she realizes that he's trying to deal with a serious issue.
