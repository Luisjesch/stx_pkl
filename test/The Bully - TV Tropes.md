_"Every skool hav a resident buly who is fat and roll about the place clouting everybode."_

The Super-Trope of Jerk Jock, Alpha Bitch, and other bully characters. This is the Schoolyard Bully All Grown Up in his heyday. The guy who gave you wedgies and tied you to a flag-pole. The girl who humiliated you in front of the entire school and broke your self-confidence on your first day in. In Western Animation, it is required by law for the bully to refer to his victims by last name only, because, well... you're not exactly their friend. Like dangerous creature predators, it’s not always the case that bullies are villains; they typically just act antagonistic, and are often considered neutral characters.

A bully is simply defined on wiktionary as "A person who is cruel to others, especially those who are weaker or have less power." This sums this character up in a nutshell. They will target anyone who is less popular than they are, those who are unable to fight back, or anyone who won't fight back. Comes in different flavours as listed below.

Because Adults Are Useless, frequently students have to take matters into their own hands to deal with these characters, leading to a Bully Hunter. Alternatively, the bully may not get his comeuppance from his victims or their protectors, instead running afoul of a bigger villain, and having to be rescued by the very people he used to torment. Can lead to a Reformed Bully, if the bully is willing to admit to it. Otherwise the status quo returns to normal despite past events.

Particularly thick bullies will often try picking on the (currently) pacifist superpowered or extremely strong kid who simply isn't very sociable. This is called Bullying a Dragon, and it _always_ ends badly, unless the dragon ends up saving the bullies and thus shutting the bully right up. This doesn't always happen.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bleach_: This is discussed when Ichigo expresses concern that Ichika has wandered away from her parents without their knowledge, Rukia tells him not to worry because a Soul Reaper has nothing to fear from human opponents. This merely increases Ichigo's worry because he interprets Rukia's words to mean that Ichika likes bullying helpless humans.
-   In _Daily Lives of High School Boys_, Habara, known as the Archdemon, was the menace of all boys eight years before the current events. She needed ten Bully Hunters to barely make a draw with her, which forced her into retirement.
-   Takeshi "Gian" Goda (aka Big G) from _Doraemon_ is probably the most well-known bully character in Japanese anime society. His victims are every boy in his neighborhood, though he picks on Nobita the most. Suneo (Sneech) is another of Gian's main targets, although he too enjoys bullying Nobita.
-   The kids at the orphanage who torment a young Lucy in _Elfen Lied_. It ends badly. **Very** badly.
-   _Fist of the North Star_'s Kenshiro deals a lot with vicious bullies and evil warlords of the wastelands, who use their strength and superpowered martial arts to make the innocent suffer. Kenshiro is a Friend to All Children and a quintessential Bully Hunter, and when such bullies go too far, Kenshiro shows _no mercy_ upon them.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: For all his talk about "honor" and "justice," Kuyou is basically nothing more than a superpowered schoolyard bully who goes around taking people's lunch money. Unfortunately, the consequences for those that don't comply are _far_ more grievous than the simple beating such thugs usually dish out, as the previous Newspaper Club can easily attest. He continues this behavior after becoming a Fairy Tale top enforcer, and utterly fails to comprehend why almost nobody shows him any respect.
-   _Mazinger Z_ has Onimaru, a secondary character who attended Shiro's high school and was a Jerkass who bullied weak kids who could not defend themselves. He picked on Mitsuo, a nerdy, weak, shy kid, and tormented him frequently, insulting him, beating him and making him a fool of himself. It did not end up well for him, though, and he started to reconsider his attitude.

-   _My Hero Academia_: Bakugo Katsuki, The Rival to The Hero Izuku Midoriya, was his personal bully for ten years as of the time the story starts, and he was allowed to bully Izuku because our hero (at least at the beginning) was Quirkless while approximately 80 to 90 percent of humanity has a Quirk and Fantastic Racism is a result, as well as Bakugo being The Ace of the class, and in the very first chapter Bakugo even dares Izuku to kill himself. When they get to U.A., however, Character Development ensues, and Bakugo goes from being his bully to eventually becoming his Secret-Keeper in regards to One For All, to Taking the Bullet for him in the Paranormal Liberation War arc. It eventually culminates into him apologizing to Izuku for everything in the Deku vs. Class 1-A arc, in order to help convince Izuku to return to U.A. and allow the class to help him in his Final Battle with All For One.
-   In _My New Devil Wife_, all the other mercenaries Theo, a 12-year-old orphan, had to work with, at first were grateful they had a willing porter, who would happily carry their luggage and dismantle the monsters they kill so they could focus on hunting, but quickly started seeing him as a burden, ignored or insulted his efforts, and his now dead adoptive "grandparents", beat him around, and literally kicked him out of the party so often he's lost count, over 2 long and difficult years. It culminates and ends in chapter 3 with the worst of the bunch, Carl, cornering Theo at the receptionist's counter and demanding that Theo **share his wife** like she's a common whore, or face a beating. To his credit, Theo loudly refuses, and the expected beating never comes, because Theo's wife _is a devil_, took offense, and broke Carl's arm, and when he goes after her, a Death Glare and a credible death threat had the coward running for the hills.
-   Being a deconstruction of the Fighting Series, _Ramen Fighter Miki_ offers a deconstruction of The Bully by Miki and Megumi’s relationship:
    -   Miki, despite being a beautiful young adult who uses Waif-Fu, not enormous in size, and not a Dirty Coward, fits the traditional depiction of a bully (dumb and enormous physical strength, caused Kankuro's Hilariously Abusive Childhood and she doesn't remember any of that).
    -   Megumi, Miki’s lifetime The Rival, fits the Real Life description of a bully: A Hypocrite who is a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing, destroys Miki’s work, uses Malicious Slander, Wounded Gazelle Gambits, is adept to Break Them by Talking against Miki, and whose only motivation to make friends is force a Let's You and Him Fight with Miki. Oh, and always refers to Miki as Onimaru.
    -   Kankuro shows the deconstruction of the _You have to stand for yourself_ attitude in dealing with The Bully Miki. After four years of college, he comes back to his old town to fight the Schoolyard Bully All Grown Up and defeat her, deleting all those horrible memories of his Hilariously Abusive Childhood. To achieve that, he must do it the honorable way, to win her respect. However, if Miki would be capable of respecting someone weaker than her, she would not have been The Bully in her youth: Miki treats him as the Unknown Rival and doesn’t even remember his name. Kankuro is trapped in a Cycle of Revenge, incapable of leaving his old town and starting his own life because he simply Can't Catch Up to Miki.
-   _Sailor Moon_: Rei is an example in the first season of the 90s anime, towards Usagi and Ami. Rei constantly goaded Ami into snubbing Usagi along with her.

While she mellows out a bit throughout subsequent seasons, she still take chances to belittle Usagi

After five years, the situation and the extremely guilty conscience he still holds for his actions have left him near suicidal. He decides to befriend Shouko before killing himself, though after befriending her he decides not to commit suicide.

        **Linda:** Perhaps you're right! Nasty is a rather good news photographer! _\[thinking\]_ Though I hate to admit it!  
        **Nasty:** Rather good? Compared to you, I'm the whole Galaxy Broadcasting Service News staff rolled into one person!  
        **Linda:** Come off it, big mouth! I'm nearly as good a photog as you!  
        **Nasty:** Perhaps! But nobody really knows, since you're never around when a big story breaks!

    Jokes 

-   This one captures the essence of bullying, so to speak.
    
    **Fox:** Bear, I'm bored.  
    **Bear:** Yeah, me too.  
    **Fox:** I've got an idea! We beat up the hare!  
    **Bear:** Yeah, great idea!  
    **Fox:** But we can't beat him up for nothing, we need a reason... I've got it: If he wears a cap, we tell him 'You have a stupid cap', and if he has no cap, we tell him 'Why don't you wear a cap, you want to get a cold?'  
    **Bear:** Yeah, great idea!  
    (They go, meet the hare, he has no cap, they beat him up. Continue next day:)  
    **Fox:** Bear, I'm bored.  
    **Bear:** Yeah, me too... can we beat up the hare again?  
    **Fox:** Yeah, but we need a reason... I've got it: We ask him for a cigarette. If he offers us one with filter, we tell him 'Don't you know the filter kills the taste?', and if he offers us one without, we tell him 'Do you want to poison us?'  
    (They go, meet the hare.)  
    **Fox:** Hey, do you have a cigarette for us?  
    **Hare:** With or without filter?  
    **Fox:** Bear, have you noticed he still doesn't wear a cap?

-   _Bazil Broketail_:
    -   Helena of Roth is constantly trying to get Lagdalen into trouble while they're both Senior Novices at the Temple in Marneri, tattling about anything wrong she does no matter how minor. It's immensely satisfying to see an attempt blow up in her face.
    -   Smilgax enjoys picking on those weaker than him, even _his own dragonboy_.
-   Judy Blume's _Blubber_ features an Alpha Bitch named Wendy, who decides to bully overweight classmate Linda (psychologically _and_ physically) on a whim and gets everyone in her class - including Jill, the narrator of the novel - to join in.

-   _Eric, or Little by Little_: When Eric first starts attending Roslyn School, the worst bully of the lower forms is Barker, who expresses his jealousy of smarter boys by harassing and picking fights with them. His previous favourite target was Owen, who eventually told the headmaster, Dr Rowlands, about Barker's behaviour. Dr Rowlands gave Barker a public caning, which stopped the bullying at the expense of Owen's standing with the other boys. When Eric starts school, Barker starts bullying him. It doesn't stop until Eric's father happens to be walking by the schoolyard when he sees Barker beating Eric and his best friend Russell. Eric's father beats Barker with a riding whip and threatens to beat him even worse if he ever hurts Eric again. Barker is later expelled for trying to frame Eric for writing an insulting note to a teacher.
-   Flashman was originally the school bully from Tom Brown's Schooldays, until he was given his own series by George MacDonald Fraser. Arguably he's a case of Schoolyard Bully All Grown Up then.

-   _Good Omens_ has "Greasy" Johnson, Tadfield's local bully and Adam's sometime rival. The narration says he's only a bully as a defense mechanism, as otherwise people would pick on _him_ for being large and clumsy.
-   _Goosebumps_ is prone to have these types of characters in at least one book. Special mention, of course, goes to Conan Barber from the _Monster Blood_ series (who routinely beats up Evan for minor offenses and even for things that weren't even Evan's fault), Judith from _Be Careful What You Wish For_ (who constantly taunts Samantha), Chuck and Steve from _The Haunted Mask_ (who take every opportunity to scare the living hell out of Carly Beth), and Wart, Jared, David, and Brenda from _Calling All Creeps_ (who are the main students who pick on Ricky and do whatever they can to make him as miserable as possible).

    -   Harry is disapointed to find out that his father and godfather relentlessly bullied his least favorite teacher, Severus Snape.
    -   Snape himself is a horrible bully to his students, Harry and Neville in particular. JK Rowling even says she considers this his worst trait. However, unlike many bullies, Snape is no coward and when push comes to shove he will protect his students with his life no matter how much he may dislike them.
    -   When he was younger, Tom Riddle bullied other students, although he was mostly seen as a good student by his teachers, with the exception of Dumbledore. Tom got worse. Much, much worse.

    -   Jacob Gorski becomes Sammy's new bully in the sequel after Cooper Elliot got expelled for abducting and dismantling E in the previous book with the help of his brothers.
-   _I'm Ok (2018)_ has Asa Banks, who's first interaction with Ok in the book is to call him "Okie Dorkie", and essentially talk down to him. It changes later on, when Asa asks Ok to start tutoring him on how to read.
-   Henry Bowers of _It_. Later becomes a Schoolyard Bully All Grown Up.
-   In Robert Westall's _The Machine Gunners_ this role is filled by Boddser Brown, the Garmouth Grammar School bully and Chas McGill's most avid rival in the great game of collecting war souvenirs.
-   _The Many Mysteries of the Finkel Family_: On Caroline Finkel's first day of middle school, her classmate Marissa smashes the zebra she was making out of clay. Micah Perkowski tells Caroline that Marissa was just as bad in elementary school, that she made half the kids in fifth grade cry at some point, and that she spread a rumor that Micah peed his pants so people would call him Micah Pee.
-   As seen in the page quote, Nigel molesworth is more than happy to share his "grate thorts" on the subject with his readers. He goes on to explain that bullies come in two varieties: fat bullies who can run, who are trouble, and fat bullies who "can't run for tofee", who may safely be taunted from a distance. Sadly Grabber of st. custards is of the former type.
-   In _The Night Gardener_, Alastair Windsor spends most of the book picking on his little sister. Near the end, he throws Kip's crutch — the only thing he has from his now-dead father — into the river. Luckily, he changes for the better not long after.
-   The cyberpunk novel _Otherland_ could be interpreted as something of a Space Whale Aesop about bullying. The antagonists are all bullies of one sort or another; the most developed of whom, Corrupt Corporate Executive Felix Jongleur, describes a upbringing in a Boarding School of Horrors where he was the victim of the resident Gang of Bullies. In revenge, he became a bully himself, meting out vicious summary punishment to anyone who dares offend him. His use of pain to control his subordinates comes full circle when Psycho for Hire Dread pulls an Eviler than Thou on him and the Other, his quasi-AI computer system, finally snaps under the constant torture and tries to kill him.
-   Officer Felix of _Outsourced_ is very much bullying Isaac Fisher. His introduction to the reader is him absently aiming his gun at Isaac, before asking him some questions.
-   Sonny Singer and Heck Bast in _The Talisman_.
-   _Tortall Universe_
    -   Ralon in _Song of the Lioness_ enjoyed picking on and beating up Alanna and other smaller boys in his classes, even breaking Alanna's arm at one point while getting away with it. Alanna put up a good fight and eventually beat him at his own game.
    -   Joren and his crew in the first two _Protector of the Small_ books, using the excuse of routine hazing to pick on first-years relentlessly. Keladry and her friends eventually get them to stop entirely through force of numbers.
-   There are a fair few bullies in _Tough Magic_, with the three that stand out the most being Nist, Brath and Rungar.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Many, many knights are basically thugs with a sword and a massive sense of entitlement. One of the major examples is Ser Meryn Trant, who is perfectly happy to beat the crap out of a helpless teenage girl and laughs in Barristan Selmy's face when Joffrey kicks him out of the Kingsguard.
    -   Joffrey himself, and Ramsay Snow are basically what would happen if you took a vicious teenage bully and gave them command of a group of soldiers and total protection from consequences.
    -   Gregor Clegane was a vicious bully even as a child, burning and nearly killing his younger brother Sandor for playing with a toy Gregor had already discarded. He got even worse as he grew up, becoming one of the aforementioned "thugs with a sword and a massive sense of entitlement". It really doesn't help that he's always angry due to chronic migraines and is always looking for someone to lash out against. He's also the World's Strongest Man and leads a posse of other vicious bullies. Like a lot of bullies, his favorite targets are people who can't possibly put up a real fight against him, such as unarmed women and children — pillaging the smallfolk is a _hobby_ of his. Fighting against people who can actually challenge and _hurt_ him on the other hand makes him upset and causes him to lose what little self control he still has, much like a Spoiled Brat whining when things don't go his way.
-   _T\*A\*C\*K_: Red Jameson, the meanest kid at Monroe Elementary School. He often makes life miserable for the Sandy Harbor kids when they are grouped together for occasions like spelling bees and field days. He even broke Will's leg by "accident."
-   _Llama Llama and the Bully Goat_ from Anna Dewdney's _Llama Llama_ picture book series is about Llama Llama and his friends having to deal with a bully named Gilroy Goat. In the Animated Adaptation, this issue will come up on the show as well. Promotional material states that deep down Gilroy wants to have friends but doesn't quite know how to go about it.
-   _Worm_ has Taylor gain her superpowers due to the incredibly vicious bullying she suffers at school. She tries to become a superhero (but ends up becoming a frighteningly competent supervillain,) mostly out of a need to escape her hell of a school. The serial spends a lot of time looking at bullying in its different forms, motivations, what enables it, and consequences; Taylor believes there is a very real chance she would have been Driven to Suicide without her double-life to escape to, and her tendency to lash out viciously against those she perceives (often, but not always, correctly) as trying to bully her or others is a direct cause of many of her more ruthless and brutal actions.
-   _Ratburger_ has Tina Trotts who (at least until the end) slobbers on, teases, and hits Zoe.
-   In _A Boy Named Queen_, of the kids who make fun of the titular character's name, Connor and Parker are the worst.
-   _Flawed_: After becoming Flawed, Celestine is harassed by kids at school, especially Logan and Natasha. Logan even goes so far as to pretend to be her friend, inviting her to his "18th birthday party", only to kidnap her along with Natasha, as well as their friend Gavin and her ex-friend Colleen. They spend the night abusing her and taunting her, and even strip her, before locking her in a thread overnight.
-   _The Tribe_: The first book, "Homeroom Headhunters", has Riley Callahan, who takes joy in making Spencer's life in school miserable. He also has history with some members of the Tribe.

-   _Race to the Sun_ has Mac, Nizhoni's younger brother, who is constantly bullied at school by Adrien Cuttlebush and his pals. Adrien beats Mac up and destroys his art supplies, which for Mac is even worse than beating. And then Mac discovers his water powers and gets even.
-   _Unbelievably Boring Bart_: Bartholomew Bean has had to deal with three bullies since he moved to Rancho Verdugo, California.
    -   Giselle "The Golem", who seems to go out of her way to make sure she bumps into Bart in the hallway.
    -   Nick "The Mimic", who likes to sit behind Bart in class, and constantly poke him to get him to speak out in class.
    -   Tigran "The Tyrant", who likes "borrowing" whatever he can from Bart and never returning it.
-   Nate from _You Look Different in Real Life_ was bullied in fifth grade by Aidan and Tony, two boys who tormented him over his devotion to his rabbit Nimbus. Things got so bad that Nate's grandfather visited Aidan's parents to rip them a new one. But the boys denied the bullying, and there wasn't enough proof, so neither was ever punished.
-   _Angela Nicely_: Tiffany Charmers and the Payne twins both like to give Angela and her friends a hard time, Tiffany by showboating and berating Angela, and the Payne twins by doing things like stealing her lunch.
-   _The Witch of Knightcharm_ is set at an evil Wizarding School whose incoming class has a gang of these. The gang is led by Lily, a witch who claims to be descended from Merlin. Lily and her gang ruthlessly bully the other students, even assaulting them with curses on occasion.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Sesame Street_: Several classic Street stories and skits:
    -   In episodes aired in 1973 and 1974, a character named Bad Barney came to the street to bully Big Bird around. In his first appearance, he spray-painted his initials ("B.B.") on several buildings and windows and threatens to pin the blame on Big Bird if he opens his mouth. The adults almost immediately catch on and help the Bird stand up to Barney before he is given his walking papers. In the second skit, Barney returns, looking for a patsy to do his chores, his homework, etc., and threatens to blame him for a theft from vegetable vendor Willy's cart. Big Bird follows through with the theft but then admits later what he had done when Barney continues to accellerate his threats; when Big Bird rats him out, Barney flees ... right into a cop, who takes him away. The latter skit was remade in 1985, with Telly as Barney's mark.
    -   In 1975, a Gangsters' skit is made with Lefty – not the salesman, but a Fat Blue character as a scared kid – intimidated by a pair of gangsters. He's told to remember the "secret knock" (three knocks) and that he'd better answer the door when he hears the knock or else. Lefty eventually decides he doesn't want to be bullied anymore and leaves through a back door, leaving the gangsters stranded outside (and – as the skit ends beforehand – likely easy targets for arrest by the police, who have been searching for them).
    -   A 2011 episode, “The Good Birds Club,” puts bullying in a modern context, when Big Bird is invited (by paper invitation) to a new club. There, the pigeons convince Big Bird that he’s not good enough because of various attributes, covertly bullying him in the process. In the end, Chris, Elmo and Abby get the Bird to realize he’s being bullied, and Big Bird eventually tells the lead pigeon to shove it. The other two members of the Good Birds Club follow Big Bird’s lead and join a new club, the “Happy To Be Me” club, where everyone is welcome.

-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Ser Alliser Thorne bullies his recruits and encourages bullying among them, though he claims this is necessary to toughen them up.
    -   Rast bullies Sam at the Wall, then later on he ironically gets bullied by Karl once Karl kills Jeor Mormont.
    -   Lommy and Hot Pie try to bully Arya, but are mostly just putting on a tough front. After an initial altercation, they all get along fairly well.
    -   Joffrey gets his kicks tormenting others.
        -   Joffrey is a Deconstruction: He is The Bully _with actual power and status_, and adults who normally have little to fear from this stock character are in as much if not more danger from him. As Ned Stark can testify.
    -   Cersei gets a kick out of throwing her weight around and making underlings squirm. Pycelle is probably her favorite punching bag.
    -   Gregor's idea of a good time is raping and killing people — especially those who can't feasibly fight back. A woman and her baby in the backstory, his own little brother when they were both children, a surprised Loras Tyrell who had nothing but a wooden shield while he was swinging a huge sword, a bunch of helpless unarmed prisoners...and it's mentioned that he regularly goes raping and pillaging the smallfolk. Facing an actually challenging opponent like his brother Sandor and Oberyn Martell just makes him even angrier.
    -   The Waif takes a lot of glee in bullying Arya whenever she can. Unlike Lommy and Hot Pie, she is a legitimate threat, and her bullying only escalates when Jaqen is not present.
-   As a Long Runner set in a British high school, _Grange Hill_ has had its fair share of bullies. The most iconic of these is arguably Norman 'Gripper' Stebson, who was feared by teachers as well as students, and had a penchant for extortion and racism.
-   The brother on _Strangers with Candy_. To be fair, he bullies his sister, who at times can be something of a bully herself.

-   Whitney Fordman in the first season of _Smallville_. Slowly gained some Character Development over the season, and when he left to join the army, he and Clark had a grudging respect for each other, and he even asks Clark to keep Lana safe for him. Then he is pretty quickly revealed to have been KIA.

-   _Malcolm in the Middle_: In early seasons Reese often tortures his younger brothers and is a violent, feared bully even at school. It becomes a plot point in the episode "Bully" when he temporarily decides to become nicer, but without Reese as the "head bully", the school descends into total anarachy and results in dozens of wannabe bullies jockeying for his position.
-   Bulk and Skull from the early seasons of _Power Rangers_ are particularly mild examples of this trope, though as Linkara points out, they "weren't particularly good bullies since it was obvious any ONE of the rangers was capable of kicking their asses". However, they acted more like comic relief by cracking jokes than anything. They were more or less on friendly terms with the Rangers (in their own way) and Skull even had an obvious crush on Kimberly. And when real bullies showed up they fled in terror. However, by season three they'd grown out of the bully/class clown persona and became junior police officers and would hold down various jobs in later seasons. Each had major Pet the Dog moments beginning in season two.
-   Hutch was this to Kip in the original season of _The Joe Schmo Show_, messing up his photo album, teasing him about not wanting to go in the pool and threatening to shove him in the pool and such. Part of the appeal of Matt was him standing up for Kip and saying that he understands about phobias and such.
-   Tony and Gibbs can be considered this toward McGee, regularly insulting him, forcing him to do demeaning things, and otherwise doing things that are considered 'bullying'.

-   Played straight, then Inverted in an episode of _Supernatural_. One episode had Dean and Sam return to one of several High Schools they'd attended while travelling cross-country with their father. Sam has Flashbacks to a boy who had bullied him for being small, until Sam turned the tables by beating the tar out of him. They moved again shortly afterwards, and in the present, Sam discovers that after the beating, the rest of the school started to bully the bully, to the point that his ghost became a vengeful spirit that killed other bullies.
-   Grayson the School Bully from the Ripping Yarns instalment _"Tompkinson's Schooldays"_ is another parody of the Flashman character from the Tom Brown's Schooldays.
    
    "In return for not hitting any of the masters, the Head had allowed Grayson certain privileges, such as having unmarried Filipino women in his room, smoking opium, and having a sauna instead of prayers."
    
-   Sandra was one of these in her youth _New Tricks_ to the point that when she attended a school reunion in one episode, her class picture had been defaced to give her devil horns and a goatee. It is implied she was also one in her police academy days too.
-   Bullying was a central theme in _Glee_. Most of the football players and cheerleaders bullied the original Glee Club kids (especially Kurt and Rachel), even those who later became part of the Glee Club. David Karofsky is somewhat of a leader of the jock posse, and in season 2 he's the main antagonist who bullies Kurt to the point of sexual harassment and death threats.
    -   Later he's redeemed and becomes the victim of bullying himself.
-   Kubiak in _Parker Lewis Can't Lose_ is presented as such at first, especially due to his giantic size and menacing personality, but later episodes showed that he was actually a Gentle Giant only doing what society expected from him.
-   _Control Z_: Gerry and his buddies never leave Luis be, picking on him brutally every day.
-   _Cobra Kai_: Good God, where do we begin?:
    -   Season 1 introduces Kyler and his gang who relentlessly harass Miguel by calling him 'rhea (after seeing him a bottle of Pepto-Bismol that he bought for his grandma) in addition to picking on less popular kids like Eli and Demetri. If that's not all, Yasmine and her clique are also shown making fun of Aisha for her weight. It gets to the point where Johnny Lawrence's (the original bully from the Karate Kid) Cobra Kai becomes a safe haven for bullied kills, and even their top students (Hawk, Aisha, Miguel) eventually become bullies themselves.
    -   Season 2 subverts Miguel in which he learns his lesson after attacking Robby's injured shoulder in the All-Valley finals. However, Hawk begins to fully embrace his bully mindset by attacking Demetri (after he posts a bad review of the Cobra Kai dojo on Yelp), vandalizing Miyagi-Do (and stealing Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor in the process), and escalating the All Valley School Brawl. This season also introduces Tory, who makes Sam her biggest target (due to the latter's privileged background and previous relationship with Miguel). Oh, and John Kreese returns, ready to turn Cobra Kai into the thug dojo it was in the Karate Kid trilogy, and successfully does so after making a deal with Armand to take it from Johnny.
    -   Throughout Season 3, the entire Cobra Kai dojo is fully established as this (with Kreese as the top dog, and Hawk and Tory as its biggest thugs). This season also reintroduces the despicable Kyler and Brucks (the latter of which gets a well-deserved no-holds-barred-beatdown by Hawk), with the former becoming a member of the Cobra Kai dojo after beating up Mitch during a sparring. Shawn Payne becomes this to Robby during his time in juvie, ruthlessly tormenting him (until Robby manages to nearly beat him using Kreese's strike-first philosophy). Hawk eventually redeems himself after realizing how far he's gone as a person.
-   _First Day_: Isabella, a girl from Hannah's former school who knew her pre-transition and thus knows her previous name, bullies Hannah using this knowledge. However, over time she warms up to Hannah (who's very kind to her in spite of this, as she sees Isabella has suffered abuse due to bruises on her arms), and stops it.
-   Parodied in a _Key & Peele_ skit, with a bully who openly spouts various generic Freudian Excuses used by TV bullies all the while still acting like a schoolyard bully.
-   _The Boys_: Behind his Physical God status, Homelander's pretty much a grown-up bully that revels in the fear and suffering of others and is impotent in the face of those he can't intimidate or kill. He ramps it up hard in season 3.
    -   After Edgar makes Annie co-captain, he takes it out on A-Train, fat shaming him and then threatening him when he replies fuck you under his breath
    -   After finding out Stormfront killed herself, he forces a suicidal young woman he was supposed to rescue to kill herself even after she changes her mind.
    -   He re-recruits the Deep as a power move on Annie then forces her to pretend to be his girlfriend.
    -   He welcomes the Deep back by having a seafood dinner and then forcing him to eat his friend Timothy the Octopus alive, knowing full well the Deep can hear him talk and beg for mercy.
-   _Motherland: Fort Salem_: When Cadet Cortez innocently asks why the Mothertongue class has been canceled, Jarrett interrupts Professor Grafton's explanation in a brusque manner with his own rant about witches having their own secret language. His body language and dominating tone when he asks if she has further questions silence her.
-   _Mohawk Girls_: Iostha is the leader of some bullying women in Kahnawake who police how others act and lead roudy protests against Mohawks in relationships with white people.
-   _My World… and Welcome to It_: Lydia is asked by two boys to a school dance in "The Mating Dance." She agrees to go with the uncouth Leonard, but it turns out his brainy rival Elbert backed off from pursuing Lydia because Leonard bullied him to stay away from her. John encourages Elbert to stand up to Leonard, telling him a story about how his grandfather bested three members of a bullying family. But things backfire when Elbert stands up for himself and punches Leonard — the latter backs down crying and Lydia feels sorry for him.

    Music 

-   Fans who have tried to analyze "Particle Man" by They Might Be Giants have interpreted Triangle Man this way, noting that he _hates_ Particle Man and Person Man, and fights them because he wins, but _never_ messes with Universe Man.
-   "Bully" by Shinedown is a song about calling out a bully.
-   A handy Bully Song Index compiled for you.

    Pinballs 

-   The Big Shot on _Dr. Dude_, who constantly taunts the player. Naturally, hitting him yields big points.

    Podcasts 

-   Each candidate in the _Plumbing the Death Star_ episode "Which Smash Bros. Character Would Make the Best Stepdad?" is measured by how they would handle it if they found out a stereotypical bully was hassling their kid. By the end of the episode, the bully has to deal with a mute kleptomaniac, magical deadbeat Italians, and actual wild animals who all come down on him with extreme force. After getting eaten and spit back out by the final stepfather, the bully doesn't even want to associate with his victim and just wants to stay away from his terrifying family members.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Nick Busick (a state law enforcement officer from Georgia) used a "bully" gimmick as a heel in both Georgia Championship Wrestling and later, the WWF. His 1991 WWF run was his best known, where he was known as simply "The Bully." To sell the gimmick, he'd commit various acts such as hassling ring announcer Mike McGuirk when she got his name wrong, or popping a child's balloon with a pin. After bullying several jobbers, he moved to the mid-card and had moderate success against wrestlers like "Superfly" Jimmy Snuka and "The Texas Tornado" Kerry Von Erich, but never got higher as – after a well-publicized match where he was completely squashed by Sid Justice – the "bully" gimmick was effectively destroyed and Busick left shortly after that match.

    Theater 

-   _Cyrano de Bergerac_: This play is not placed in High School, but uses — and deconstructs this trope:
    -   Played straight with De Guiche, who is a Jerk Jock using his power to bully Roxane into being The Mistress and makes a Dare to Be Badass to De Valvert to punish Cyrano.
    -   Deconstructed with Cyrano: he is very cruel to others, (Montfleury, The Bore, De Guiche and everyone who Cyrano doesn't like) but it's subverted because De Guiche has a lot more power than Cyrano. Given his enormous nose and living in a shallow society that firmly believes Beauty Equals Goodness, he obviously has been bullied all his life... and now Cyrano is the most badass swashbuckler, a real One-Man Army... who can bully everyone because he is the most powerful warrior there is. Lampshaded by Roxane at Act V scene II, after Le Bret comments Cyrano still is making new enemies:
    -   Invoked by De Valvert and Christian, but they are merely victims of Peer Pressure Makes You Evil.
-   In _Street Scene_, Vincent Jones harasses Rose on the street. When Sam tries to intervene, Vincent calls him a "little kike bastard" and hits him, then protests that he has a weak heart. Rose tries to tell Sam that "he's nothing but a loafer... ten years from now, he'll still be driving a taxi," but Sam is in his usual despair.

    Video Games 

-   _Bully_, as you might have guessed, centers around these. In fact, the first clique that the main character has to fight and take over is made up entirely of bullies, ironically making them pushovers for most of the game and allowing the player to have a blast putting them through the same torment they've been unleashing on the weaker students at Bullworth Academy.
-   Butch at the beginning of _Fallout 3_.
-   You meet bullies in _Fable_ 1 and 2 and beat the crap out of them for the greater good.
-   Bobby Zilch of _Psychonauts._ Not a very effective one though.
-   Spider from _The Adventures of Willy Beamish_. Want to make it past him unscathed? Give Him Your Inventory Item.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Mido from _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ bullies Link because he doesn't have a fairy and because he's best friends with the girl Mido likes, Saria. To a lesser extent, he's mean to the other Kokiri, particularly one boy he forces to mow Saria's lawn, something _Mido_ offered to do as a favor for Saria. Of course, seven years later, after Saria accepts her destiny as a Sage, Mido admits that he was a jerk and asks the adult version of Link (whom he doesn't recognize) to apologize to Link on his behalf.
    -   Groose from _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_. It ultimately turns out he's not _that_ bad at heart and when the chips are down, he Gets Dangerous and helps save the day.
-   _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_ has Team Star, a gang of teenage delinquents plaguing the region's Academy of Adventure who initially formed to protect themselves from bullies but ended up becoming bullies themselves as they pressure other kids to join up with them. Part of the game's story revolves around the Player Character becoming a Bully Hunter and forcing them to disband. At the end of the storyline it's revealed that while some of the grunts could be pushy, Team Star never actually bullied anyone and it was all just rumors stemming from the leaders' former bullies dropping out in fear of them.
-   _The Prince of Landis_: Jason is established as Evan's bully in the first cutscene. He calls Evan a mean name, insults his father, and then beats him up. Dustin's father says it's because Evan's own father used to beat Jason's father up when they were kids.
    -   Jason is also seen making fun of Tommy for his back.
-   Bisco from _Robopon_, who even holds sway over teachers.
-   _Saturday Morning RPG_: Episode 2 introduces Billy, the boyfriend of Marty's crush who also likes to pick on Marty. He cuts Marty off on his way to his locker, claims it as his own, and then takes Marty outside, intending to beat him to a pulp in front of the school. However, by then, Marty already has his notebook, and quickly turns the tables on Billy (though he accidentally prematurely activates Commander Hood's giant cannon in the process).
-   _Every single_ enemy in _Ninja Pizza Girl_ acts out this trope to a T. Partly they are just doing their job in trying to sabotage their boss' competition by making Gemma late on her pizza runs, they are also clearly enjoying their jobs a little too much and seem to take a savage delight in putting her through petty abuses and trying to break her spirit.
-   Sean in _Hewitt_. He keeps stealing Hewitt's food until he can find a way to get rid of him.

-   _Little Nightmares II_ features Bullies as a type of enemy in The School. Apparently made of porcelain, they are fierce and feral and spend every waking moment either causing trouble or trying to kill you. The only time they behave is when told to by The Teacher, who has no qualms about chaining them up, beating them, or outright killing them if she catches any slight infraction of the rules. To quote the game itself:
    
    Proof that all children don't get to be innocent, The Bullies aren't tragic figures, no cruel parents to blame, and don't secretly crave your friendship. They are Bullies, and they will get you if you don't get them first.
    
-   The aptly-named It's A Bully from _Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning_, naturally. This big jerk will stand in a hallway, block you from passing unless you surrender an item to him, and is immune to BSODA or the Grappling Hook. You _can_ fight back, in a sense, by letting Principal Of The Thing see him bully you, which will get him sent to detention for 90 seconds.

-   _Cobra Kai_: Kyler and Yasmine to a T. He is an unashamed Jerk Jock who delights in tormenting others (especially Miguel physically and Sam through social media) but is also a Dirty Coward, engaging only when his Gang of Bullies is with him. She is a gleeful Alpha Bitch who never hesitates to mock Aisha's weight (whether in person and on social media). Kyler only gets worse when he joins the titular, and now antagonistic Cobra Kai dojo, while Yasmine lightens up somewhat after becoming an outcast herself and develops an attraction to Demitri.
-   Ukinojoe:
    -   In Great: The Show 5, the opening segment, "Meme High School", has Pizza Frank, who gives the main character- also named Frank, incidentally- a hearty punch in the face for seemingly trying to steal his likeness.
    -   A segment from Great: The Show 8, titled "Replacement Bully", has a subversion of this trope: the title character "bullies" another student at school by unknowingly "replacing" his possessions (such as his #2 pencil with a mechanical one and his lunch pizza with a vegan grandma pizza). This gradually escalates further until he eventually replaces the kid's sidewalk with a conveyor belt and eventually literally replaces his dad with himself.
-   Hilariously parodied with the "AcountaBully" series on Tik Tok, where the bully always corners the POV character in the hallway between classes to give them a hard time about... not accepting trans people, refusing to vote, Slut-Shaming female classmates, and other harmful behaviors. He's aggressive and rude, but comes off as a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, since while he bullies the POV character, he's actively standing up for others at school. He also never actually punches the POV character despite often threatening to, since the bell always conveneintly goes off right when he's about to do it. This leads some commenters to speculate that he times it that way on purpose, allowing him to maintain a "tough guy" front without actually hurting anyone. He also backs off in one video where he realizes the POV character is struggling with depression. The series blew up both for the actor's glorious parody of a stereotypical high school bully, and because the character proved to be oddly endearing.
-   Heavily discussed by _Doug Walker_ in his _Top 10 Worst Cliches_ list where "The Bully" takes the #1 slot because he finds them to be unfunny, uninteresting, undeveloped "characters" with no real backstory or motivation being being a dick to the protagonist to spur the story forward. He brings up bullies like Nelson Muntz, Shooter McGavin, and Jack Black as the bully in _Airborne_ and _The Neverending Story III_ as rare positive examples of The Bully, explaining that _these_ characters are written as funny, entertaining characters who are actually motivated by their own amusement and are played in a self-aware way, unlike most that are just "cardboard cutouts of stereotypes".
