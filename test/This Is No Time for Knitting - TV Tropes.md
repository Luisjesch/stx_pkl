(Before anyone asks, there's no romance. There's no time for that when there's people getting killed, dude)

Alice and Bob are in trouble. Bob begins doing some apparently mundane and/or whimsical task not appropriate for this situation, and Alice scolds him: "No time for \[activity\] now!" Bob then reveals that he was, in fact, solving the problem. For a situation where a student believes his teacher is having him do crazy things which turn out to be an unorthodox method of training, see Wax On, Wax Off.

    Fairy Tales 

-   Played for Drama in "The Six Swans" by Hans Christian Andersen - it is indeed literally a time for knitting, since that is the only way the heroine can break her brothers free of their Forced Transformation, but because one of the provisos of the Curse Escape Clause is that she cannot speak until her work is done, she can't explain why her activity is the solution to the problem...which leads to her almost being burned as a witch for her strange behavior. She continues knitting till just before they light the flames, then tosses the shirts over the swans' heads, and her brothers save her. The shirt of the youngest brother, however, isn't quite finished - she still needed to finish the sleeve, but had no time left to do so. For the rest of his life, he had a wing where that arm should've been. Some versions say that the shirt didn't have sleeves at all, so people thought he was an angel when he turned back.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Arrow_. While marooned on Lian-Yu, Oliver Queen discovers a Healing Herb that seems to cure just about anything.

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Robot": The Brigadier, Harry Sullivan and the Doctor are investigating the scene of a robbery, only to have the Doctor play a seemingly inordinate amount of attention to a squashed flower on the lawn. However, the Doctor explains that he is investigating an important clue, considering that flower was near pulverized by being stepped on by something that apparently weighed a quarter ton, a piece of information that the officers definitely find interesting.
    -   "Tooth and Claw": The Doctor asks Rose to help him with a giant telescope as they're being chased by a werewolf. Rose comments that it's hardly the time for stargazing. The Doctor replies, "Yes it is!" and uses the telescope to defeat the werewolf.
    -   The Doctor pulls this on _himself_ in "Army of Ghosts"/"Doomsday". While fighting the Cybermen and Daleks, he repeatedly dons a pair of 3D glasses to look at them.

    -   "Asylum of the Daleks": The Doctor keeps asking Voice with an Internet Connection Oswin, who's been stuck in the Asylum for a year after the spaceship she was on crashed, where she gets the milk and eggs for the soufflés she likes to make. It's a clue that Oswin couldn't have actually been making those soufflés, as milk and eggs are perishable ingredients — she was actually forcibly converted into a Dalek and is in (understandable) denial about it.
    -   "Spyfall": The Doctor is sent a picture of a fish by her old MI6 contact in response to a request for his location, to the confusion of other characters. She pays an inordinate amount of attention to the image even as she and her companions are fleeing from an attack by intangible aliens, before revealing that the picture has her contact's coordinates encoded into it.
-   Hilariously parodied in the _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ short _Young Man's Fancy_:

-   _The Office_, "Traveling Salesmen": Jim and Dwight are on a sales call together. While Jim is talking to a prospective client, Dwight asks if he can use the phone and subsequently starts yelling numbers loudly into the phone. At first, this seems like Dwight's usual bizarre behavior, perhaps even _more_ bizarre than usual — however weird he is, he's always appeared to be a good salesman. However, when it comes time for Jim to demonstrate Dunder Mifflin's phone customer service, we find out that Dwight has been demonstrating a rival company's phone customer service the whole time. Jim then proceeds to call Dunder Mifflin's customer service line, and has Kelly on the line within a couple seconds, thus successfully demonstrating the difference between a large impersonal company and a smaller company.

Ben scolds him, but Tom reveals that his spa buddies actually own truck companies and, after Tom discussed the plans with them while relaxing, they've agreed to donate a fleet of vehicles for the festival.

Kirk is losing a court martial for criminal negligence.

He knew that there was no way he would win consistently if the computer was working as intended.
    
    **Spock**: I am about to win my third game (with the computer).  
    **McCoy** (stops halfway out the door and turns with a 'say what?' look on his face.)
    
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
    -   In the episode "Past Prologue", there are Bajoran terrorists up to no good on the station. In the middle of surveilling them, Bashir is baffled by Garak completely switching the topic to discuss Bashir coming to the shop to get a new suit. What Garak was really doing was giving a Federation officer a cover story to be in his shop when a clandestine meeting occurred to pass on vital information to the Federation about the Bajoran terrorists via unofficial back channels because Cardassia couldn't officially ask the Federation for help in apprehending them.
    -   Sisko returns the favor much later. In "The Way Of The Warrior", the Klingons have decided to "annex" parts of the Cardassian Empire. Knowing he can't inform the Cardassians through proper channels, Sisko brings Garak into an operations meeting because he needs "correct measurements" for his ceremonial suit. Garak catches on really quick why he's really there, and soon after informs the Cardassians about the upcoming invasion.

Ratchet then realizes that he'll need some vine seeds, while Clank is confused ("How will vine seeds help us defeat the Argorians?"). After planting the seeds, the fully grown vines from 10 years later grow through the time portal, allowing Ratchet to grind on them and get onto the dam.
-   _Valkyria Chronicles_: Welkin Gunther, the militia officer in charge of Squad 7, is a huge nature geek. His subordinates will often get exasperated that he seems to have forgotten about the mission in favor of some interesting animal or plant, except that at least half the time he turns out to have discovered useful tactical information from it. During the Kloden Wood mission, for example, he excitedly crouches over a pile of droppings left by a wild goat. Rosie, Largo, and Alicia think he's just getting sidetracked until he points out an animal trail he noticed because of the droppings, which will allow the soldiers to proceed through the woods more easily.

Jake's singing also stops the storm, which turns out to be sentient, and is so enthralled by the bird calls that it ceases its rampage.

However, Nigel reveals that he had known about it, and a "cabalito" is actually a boat.

    Real Life 

-   People whose work is secret may face this. Charles Fraser-Smith — who worked for the British Ministry of Supply in WW2 procuring secret items and ended up becoming Ian Fleming's real-life inspiration for the _James Bond_ character Q — once had an invoice from one of his suppliers, marked simply "razor blades", rejected as too expensive more or less in the terms "There's a war on, this is no time for fancy razor blades." The blades were magnetized, and when floated on a leaf functioned as a compass, which was a design feature intended to help SOE agents with escape and evasion. After taking an official from the obstructing department and signing him into secrecy, a complete audit showed that the supplier had in fact not taken the full allowed percentage of profit. Smith tore up the invoice on the spot and insisted it be re-submitted with the full margin of profit. Understandingly, Fraser-Smith never had a bill queried by HM Treasury after that.
