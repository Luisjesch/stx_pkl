"When I was sober, my family loved me. And my hat wasn't blue..."

_"I need morphine! Is it true that my eyes are like buttons? I feel gripes inside my belly, as if I am filled with straw."_

When a drug addict is left a physical and mental wreck from their addiction to drugs or alcohol. The signs are typically what they would be in real life; their visage noticeably deteriorates, they are increasingly unreliable and regularly fail to meet obligations, are often visibly drunk or strung out and, if they are on drugs, may be associating with sketchy and often dangerous people, and are also prone to theft, scams, and scheming to acquire money to feed their habits. The decline is often documented as a way of showing Drugs Are Bad and may be the focus of a Very Special Episode. This is distinct from the Functional Addict (who is still capable of accomplishing the tasks of everyday life), but the Functional Addict may reach this state. In cynical works, this can be the endpoint of a Descent into Addiction character arc.

Also distinct from The Alcoholic (where the character trait is simply that they are usually drunk), but there definitely can be overlap.

The Logical Extreme is someone being killed by their addiction, often a Long-Lost Uncle Aesop so that none of the main cast needs to die. If they get support and have great Heroic Willpower, they may become a Recovered Addict.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the _Black Lagoon_ story arc involving Abu Sayyaf, the Triad enlists as Revy and Rock's chauffeur to the US military base an assassin named Shenhua and a driver named Leigarch who is continuously snorting coke. A previous overdose resulted in frequent hallucinations, and between then and Shenhua's next appearance in the Greenback Jane arc, he apparently OD'd again and wrecked his brain to the point where he had to be institutionalized.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Cruelty_, Reis Northcotte's mother is implied to be this; certainly, she is a Missing Mom due to her frequent arrests. His dad takes this to the Logical Extreme, having died of an overdose. In the sequel, his mom dies as well.
-   _Unkept Promise_ is a pro-temperance propaganda comic about the apparent dangers of alcohol, illustrating this with the story of a family man who immediately goes on a hard downward spiral after trying just one glass of booze. He forecloses on his house, loses his job, repeatedly ends up in the drunk tank, his family falls into poverty, and apparently his hat turns blue.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: A drug addict desperate for a high knocks a police officer out a window while trying to steal drugs. He doesn't even seem to know he just nearly murdered someone when Diana disarms him and rescues the cop, and the cop is furious — her shoulder was injured because Diana was trying to help both of them and she sees the junkie as beyond help.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Bloom County_, Bill the Cat is the character most frequently stated to use drugs other than alcohol, tobacco, or dandelions, which helps explain why his average mood is practically brain-dead.

    Fan Works 

-   _Codex Equus_ has Moon Ray Vaughoof. Moon Ray's entry notes that he consumed so much drugs and alcohol that his judgement and music-playing were severely impeded, and he became prone to making dumb choices. When he started having prophetic nightmares about himself drowning in water no matter how hard he tried to swim up, Moon Ray tried suppressing them with _more_ alcohol, and he later collapsed and nearly died on tour as a result. Both doctors and Zebra musician Smooth Neck predicted he wouldn't live long to the age of forty (which came true, but in a different way) because of how much he damaged himself with his habits. Fortunately, Moon Ray's near-death experience motivated him to clean himself up and cut out all the toxic people in his life, including his wife at the time, Crystal Light, whom he divorced after discovering her unsavory traits. Meeting Velvet Heart, his fiancée and later wife, made him swear off alcohol and drugs completely, and he was a completely Recovered Addict by the time of his death. His presence in the Fourth Age as an Alicorn god implies he has been sober for _over tens of thousands of years_.
-   Yukari in the _Azumanga Daioh_ fic _Control_ becomes this after she starts injecting drugs. The first chapter starts with her arriving at Nyamo's house in the middle of the night, beaten up and oblivious to her surroundings.
-   In _Coping_, Sunset's addiction to over-the-counter drugs contrasts with the other characters' more stable usage of cigarettes and marijuana. Sunset's becoming more addicted. It's gotten to the point where even Twilight notices that something is wrong with her.
-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "The New Shop In The Village", Empath in a dream sees that the Smurf Village has devolved into a drug-fueled Sugar Apocalypse and that most of the Smurfs and Smurfettes in it are all junkies that look like "the walking dead", all because smurfnip has been legalized.
-   Happens to Matt in the _It Matters_ collection of _Death Note_ fanfictions, brought on by Mello's (Canon) decision to leave Wammy's House (and thus Matt) behind without bothering to say goodbye or make contact with him until the (also Canon) explosion. Matt began using drugs (opiates in particular), alcohol, and empty sex (as well as Self Harming) to cope with the pain of losing Mello. When they are reunited, he starts on a path to recovery by Going Cold Turkey. He is _mostly_ successful, though he does fall Off the Wagon every now and again, which does put a strain on his marriage to Mello.
-   In the _Laying Waste To Halloween_, Annabeth becomes addicted to drugs, which have both physical and mental side effects. She has sores on her mouth from the drugs and she's started to disassociate and not be _there_.
-   In _Their Bond_, Link is a Shell-Shocked Veteran and former Child Soldier who took to alcohol and illegal potions to help calm his demons. After finding out about the drug usage, Impa considers him a danger to Zelda because Link already holds too much power while sober, nevermind if he isn't in the right mind.
-   Discussed in _Empty Arms_. Slade notes that Laurel has a sharp mind, and that he's grateful she dulled it for the past few months with alcohol, giving everyone else cause to doubt her. After arranging for him to arrested by the Australian government, she throws this back in Oliver's face:
    
    **Oliver:** He might tell them my identity when they question him. Sara’s, too.
    
    **Laurel:** And what reason would they have to believe him? He’s been high on some drugs for half a decade. As you may recall, the word of an addict isn’t taken all that seriously.
    
-   _What It Takes_: It is indicated that if Quentin was drinking less, he'd be able to recognize that Darhk is a villain. It's also preventing him from doing his job effectively. In Chapter 9, he tries to draw his gun on Laurel (again), only for her to flatly state "You're too drunk to aim".

-   In _Pulp Fiction_, Vincent Vega's cool, collected, impossible-to-faze exterior hides the fact that he is a heroin-addled moron who would have wound up getting himself killed a long time ago if it wasn't for Jules being there to continually rescue him from his own gorked-out stupidity. In fact, not having Jules around quickly results in his death.
-   While all the main characters in _Requiem for a Dream_ have their lives destroyed by their drug addiction, for three of them it's the things they do in an attempt to feed their addictions rather than the effects of the drugs themselves that do them in (although Harry loses his arm to gangrene).

The Anell house takes advantage of Void user's proclivity to addictive behavior, due to the inherent quirks of their affinity, to get their Ell sub-branch assassins strung out on drugs. In fact, the first of the Ells Shayma manages to wrest free of their evil grip is a man strung out on an extremely dangerous herb known as Heartroot, and can only think of where he's going to get his next fix. His handler _actually hides_ the herb in question and then gives it back to him as "reward" for carrying out assassinations. Guiles is so addled, he has to be given the herb so he's clear-headed enough to _attempt escaping capture_ when Nivir's royal guard, tipped off about an attempt on the entire royal family, comes at him.
-   Tim Benzedrine in _Bored of the Rings_. In his more lucid moments, he readily admits that binging on drugs has destroyed his brain.

It's even invoked: Sam's father has been secretly paying off his dealer for the express purpose of keeping him drug-addled and docile.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Subverted by Mr. Tulip of _The Truth_. He's not addled because of _drugs_ so much as because of all the ridiculous things he tries to ingest _thinking_ they're drugs. Household cleaners, mostly.
        
        **Mr. Pin:** Let's go through this again. Drugs equals chemicals, but, and please _listen_ to this part, sheesh, _chemicals do not equal drugs_!
        
    -   Played straight with Brick from _Thud!_, a homeless teenage troll who's usually buzzed out of his mind on Slab, Scrape, or whatever other Fantastic Drug he's managed to get his hands on to provide a brief respite from his lonely, miserable existence. After he turns out to be a witness to a murder, Sergeant Detritus of the Watch takes him under his wing and helps him sober up.

-   In _The First Law_ series, the Lovable Rogue mercenary leader Nicomo Cosca goes from a Functional Addict with a drinking problem to one of these by the end of _Red Country_, with a lot of description given to how much of a physical and mental wreck he has become.

-   In the _Flashman_ series, Flashman's father, Buckley, ends up in this state, helped along by experiencing a financial collapse from bad investments. In the first novel of the series, he's a bad-tempered old rake with a drinking problem, and shortly after that, he's put in an asylum to be treated for the DTs. He appears as a POV character in the spin-off novel _Black Ajax_ but doesn't really show up after that (except for mentions of his bad physical and mental health), and it is implied that his son basically left him there to rot.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Arrow_ Invoked in Season 2. Laurel is the only one to see through Sebastian Blood's Villain with Good Publicity act. Part of Blood's plan to discredit her is to expose her addiction problems.

Arguably inverted, as despite her addiction she was the only one to recognize that he _was_ in fact a villain.
-   Rodrigo Borgia takes vitriola (diethyl ether) for a good part series two _Borgia_ and suffers hallucinations and erratic behaviour, not a good state to be in whilst being pope.
-   _Chappelle's Show_: The recurring character Tyrone Biggums was a crackhead whose cocaine addiction made him willing to absolutely debase himself in every way possible so that he could get drugs. In one sketch, he goes on _Fear Factor_ and is absolutely unfazed by the show's challenges, much to the host Joe Rogan's shock, since they were far from the most disgusting things he'd ever done.
-   _The Confessions of Frannie Langton_: Frannie is addicted to laudanum, like her mistress/girlfriend Marguerite. This explains why she had slept through Marguerite's parents murders without stirring. It's shown Marguerite had increasingly used a lot of laudanum, before long getting Frannie to as well, for coping with everything they suffered and this made her increasingly debilitated.
-   Ellie Rooney on the short-lived show _EZ Streets_ is a barely functioning heroin addict.

-   While many students from _El internado: Las Cumbres_ dabble in drugs/alcohol, Eva takes the cake at the school. She is seen huffing spray and by her own description, has a whole pharmacy in her mattress. She is so dependent on pills that at one point, she implores Adèle for assistance because she is no longer able to convince the school doctor to issue her any kind of downers.
-   _Miami Vice_ has quite a few, but the worst is probably Yvonne from "Too Much, Too Late," who lets her dealer rape her adolescent daughter in exchange for crack.
-   Dolores Mayo, the interim civilian aide played by Lola Glaudini on _NYPD Blue_, just seemed shy at first. Then it was revealed she was using heroin. Then she went downhill very fast.

Jem'Hadar who go without Ketracil White for too long lose their ability to cloak themselves and risk going into cardiac arrest or going on a berserk rampage.
    -   _Star Trek: Picard_: We learn more about Raffi's backstory in "Stardust City Rag".

-   _Without a Trace_'s Martin Fitzgerald's behavior gets increasingly erratic as he develops an addiction to painkillers, culminating in him nearly getting himself, his partner, and the Victim of the Week killed. His partner, a recovering alcoholic himself <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , doesn't buy his feeble excuses—"I know what an addict looks like". Several months later, having gotten his act together, it's Martin's turn to notice the signs of addiction in a suspect—"I know a junkie when I see one."
-   In 1996, Natalie from _Yellowjackets_ drinks and uses drugs but is also an athlete.

When another teammate forcibly prevents her from using cocaine, she resorts to snorting the residue that fell on the carpet.

    Music 

-   Afroman's "Because I Got High" is a comedy song in which the singer lists off all the ways he screwed up his life because, instead of taking responsibility, he chose to smoke weed instead.
    
    _I messed up my entire life because I got high  
    I lost my kids and wife because I got high

    Video Games 

-   The protagonist of _Disco Elysium_ starts the game after having drunk so much and having snorted so much speed that he has amnesia about who he really is. He's also deranged (sometimes usefully) and suicidal as the result of his own addictions, and it's stated that the alcohol has mangled his body so much that he's a major risk for a heart attack for normal exertions, such as sitting in an uncomfortable chair or turning on the lights while hungover. He finds that his behaviour under the influence has caused him to wreck his police car, lose his badge, pawn off his gun and make all of his coworkers loathe him so much that they assigned him on a case as an insult to the other department involved.
-   _Fallout_:
    -   _Fallout: New Vegas_:
        -   The Fiends, a gang of raiders who are defined by their drug-fueled insanity. A member of First Recon even mentions that she feels bad for them since, unlike the Legion, she feels that they're not entirely lucid and aware of their surroundings.
        -   _Old World Blues_ has Dr. Mobius, who regularly abuses drugs such as Mentats and Psycho, which furthers his mental degradation to the point of making him senile. He uses the Psycho to give himself the edge to threaten the other members of the Think Tank since he's normally incredibly docile.
        -   Vera Keyes, the starlet who Sinclair fell for in _Dead Money_ had a long-running Med-X (painkiller) addiction. This made her susceptible to blackmail by Dean Domino. As the War drew closer, she became more addled, having a glazed look that even construction workers deduced was due to addiction, then needing Super Stimpaks to take the edge off. She eventually required an Auto-doc to be installed in her room exclusively for her use. Unbeknownst to her but known by Sinclair, Vera was terminally ill. When we find her, she is surrounded by Med-X needles, implying death by overdose.
    -   _Fallout 4_: Cait, who is on the fast lane to becoming one due to her addiction to Psycho, which makes her unstable and eventually causes her to start coughing up blood.
-   In _Far Cry 5_, Bliss is a powerfully psychoactive drug that, in addition to its euphoric effects, can be used to condition and brainwash people. While even moderate exposure can be recovered from, long-term, severe addicts are little more than zombies, their higher functions seeming to be completely gone.
-   Levi in _Fear & Hunger: Termina_ became addicted to heroin due to his traumatic experiences in the Second Great War. In-game, the withdrawal significantly penalizes his combat stats, and recruiting him on Day 1 requires the player to give him some heroin to stave it off.
-   The painkiller Joy plays a fairly large role in _LISA_; the protagonist, Brad, along with several recruitable party members, suffer from Joy Withdrawal. When suffering withdrawal, the character's stats tank and they are practically useless until the withdrawal is gone. You can even make your other characters Joy addicts by giving them some of the drug.

-   _Re:Kuroi_: Ether medicine is highly addictive and can give the user magic powers. However, the medicine can drive them mad and turn them into monsters. Worse yet, if the user doesn't keep taking it, they'll run out of ether, lose their powers, and go blind. In Act 11, Asha betrays Kaito and steals the Black Pearl shard in the hopes that it can provide an alternate ether supply to her.
-   In _The Sims 3_, you can make a Sim this by assigning them the Absent-Minded, Inappropriate, Insane, or Unstable traits (or all of the above) along with the Party Animal trait, and/or assigning them those traits and having them do nothing but drink, eat, eat/burn herbs, consume potions with negative effects, WooHoo with anyone and everyone, play video games nonstop, or otherwise engage in an addictive behavior.
-   _We Happy Few_ is set in Wellington Wells, an entire _town_ of these. Taking Joy to live in a state of constant euphoria and forget the Very Bad Thing is mandatory, and townspeople react very badly to non-addicts, or "Downers".

    Web Animation 

-   The narrator of _There's a Man in the Woods_ ends up becoming addicted to alcohol and cocaine after he gets fired from his job, with the ending heavily implying that he's about to kill the child who got him fired.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   On the _Dream SMP_, Schlatt's addiction to alcohol, protein powder, and anabolic steroids took a heavy toll on his health, both physical and mental, and likely caused the heart attack or stroke that took his final canon life.
-   _SCP Foundation_: SCP-1481 is a genie who is utterly useless at granting wishes because he is perpetually stoned out of his mind and addicted to practically every recreational drug imaginable. He typically alternates between begging for more drugs and conjuring up food to satisfy his own munchies (when asked why he doesn't just conjure up drugs for himself too, he broke down in tears, apparently having never thought of this before). During one of his drug-fueled incoherent ramblings, he reveals that he just wants to grant wishes and make people happy, but can't, because some Jerkass wished him into his current state, and then made a _second_ wish to make the first wish _irreversible_, purely For the Evulz.

    Web Videos 

-   The character of Sugar in _Hot Bikini Beans_ is a once upon a time math teacher who is reduced to a Meth-addict trying to scrape by.
-   _The Call of Warr_: Upon finding a jar of orange pills in the train station, Killsin's instinct is to steal them and pretend they don't exist... while scarfing down as many as he can, in every scene he's in. As soon as episode two, he's already almost dead from an overdose, and it's implied the pills may be messing with his mind as well. Not that he cares, as he continues to take them, despite warnings.

    Western Animation 

-   _Arcane_: In the deepest pit of what will one day be Zaun, a colony of addicts to Shimmer live in rags and beg for money. The incentive of more Shimmer drives Huck, who otherwise wanted to help Vi to repay Vander, to sell her location out to Silco.
-   _BoJack Horseman_:
    -   Sarah Lynn is a great example from a TV show about a horse. Her drug addiction spawned from a Trauma Conga Line including the burden of being a child star who'd once had dreams outside of that realm, a sensation pop princess who was left isolated, strongly implied inappropriate contact with her stepfather, horrible advice from BoJack whom she looked to as a father figure in light of her unexplained Disappeared Dad, etc., etc., etc. By the time she was 30, she had become the typical starlet case–druggie whom no one cared for anymore. She died at only 31 years old after nine months of sobriety due to a heroin overdose.
        
        **BoJack:** Well you should... not... do that. \[contact one of the billion people who _will_ let her party at their house\]  
        **Sarah Lynn:** Oh, I know. I know, but I can, so I will. I'm at a point in my life where I don't have to "grow as a person" or "rise to an occasion," so I can just keep surrounding myself with sycophants and enablers until I die tragically young.  
        **BoJack:** Wh-what?  
        **Sarah Lynn:** Yeah, it's pretty much too late for me.
        
    -   Season 5 sees BoJack himself get hooked on opiates after a stunt goes wrong and, rather than allow him time to recover fully, is pressured back onto the set of _Philbert_ to keep filming the first season. This leads to him driving into traffic when he runs out of his medication in the hopes of getting more at the hospital and, in the penultimate episode of the season, _strangling his costar_ because he could no longer discern between reality and fiction. And the finale reveals he has _no_ memory of what he'd done, only finding out after watching the footage.
-   _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_: "Mind Pollution" involves Skumm making and dealing a drug called "Bliss." Befitting its Drugs Are Bad message, it portrays all addicts who get any significant screen time as pretty messed up (to say the least).
    -   Linka's cousin Boris starts out as a charming teenager but has undergone a Descent into Addiction offscreen by the time he appears. His father is worried about him; he calls Linka (his favorite cousin) names after she tries to take his drugs away and tells Skumm that he'll steal her power ring in exchange for more. When Skumm tells him to bring Linka instead, he balks, but the threat of being cut off leads him to drug Linka with contaminated food. Ultimately, he overdoses and dies on screen.
    -   Linka herself goes from a driven young woman to a haggard mess who only cares about getting her next fix. When Gi tries to keep her from taking another pill, Linka attempts to blow her off the roof of the Capitol building (which is luckily circumvented by the cloudiness of her mind in a drugged state). She only manages to yank herself out of it after seeing her cousin overdose and ends the episode in withdrawal.
    -   The background Bliss addicts are perfectly willing to do anything Skumm asks to keep taking the drug, from giving him everything of value that they have to attacking a group of teenagers.
-   Dr. Rockzo, the deranged "Rock-and-Roll Clown" from _Metalocalypse_, has cocaine addiction as one of his primary character traits. He was once a famous rock star, but has since deteriorated into a drug-addicted mess.
