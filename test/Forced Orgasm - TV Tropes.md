Simply put: when somebody is brought to orgasm against their will, whether it be a modest or immodest one. It may be done either deliberately by molestation/sexual assault, psychic powers or sometimes even accidentally.

The accidental type may involve some device stimulating the victim<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  with no means to remove/escape it. In extreme cases even a clueless person may be the cause of this especially if the recipient has some weird and unusual sensitive spots.

While this trope may overlap with Jizzed in My Pants, JIMP doesn't require much effort or even direct physical stimulation. The focus there is on how _little_ stimulation was required for the orgasm. Forced Orgasm, on the other hand, can happen regardless of arousal. The amount of required effort is usually related to how perverse or despicable the perpetrator is, how unfortunate/helpless the victim is, or even both.

This trope may involve Electric Instant Gratification or Orgasmatron if done by a Mad Scientist. The characters causing this may invoke I Didn't Mean to Turn You On, "Not If They Enjoyed It" Rationalization or Cool and Unusual Punishment, especially if the situation is Played for Laughs.

As per the Content Policy, note that we don't want any real-life examples of tropes like this one.

## Examples

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Mizuki Suzushiro of _Boku Girl_ is caught in a tug of war game with a rope between their legs being vigorously pulled back and forth. The outcome is so modest that Mizuki (being recently genderbent into a girl and thus not familiar with the sensation) mistakes it for a Potty Failure.
-   _Booty Royale: Never Go Down Without a Fight!_: Maria Luisa manages to choke Veronica Lynn until she climaxes in defeat. The woman is so big that she ejaculates like a fountain.
-   Embryo of _Cross Ange_ forces one on the heroine using his Mind Rape powers.
-   _Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School_: During the end of the _Despair Arc_, Yukizome's brainwashing procedure involves Mukuro Ikusaba tempering with her brain with needles, affecting the pleasure center and forcing her to orgasm as she watches the Despair Video, thus equating her newfound pleasure into despair. It's very much played for horror, as we get Fan Disservice close-up shots of Yukizome's face, groin, and breasts as she vainly attempts to resist it.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: This is how Athena chose to defeat her sister, Artemis, during their duel in chapter 9. Since they were evenly matched in direct combat, Athena gains the upper hand by suddenly making out with her and subsequently 69ing with her 'til her sister climaxed. It gets a full page spread, complete with lightning bolts in the background, amidst Artemis' screams.
-   Played with in _Food Wars!_, in which this trope happens in the Food Porn variation — mostly when Soma Yukihira (as well other cooks in the series) provokes The Immodest Orgasm in the ones who taste their dishes, at which point they jizz in their pants just by eating some of his recipes. In the first chapter of the series, Soma makes a dish so good that it gets off the mafia members who want to close his dad's restaurant, making them put off the foreclosure.
-   _Ghost Talker's Daydream_: Considering Misaki's line of work, it was inevitable. One of her clients takes her by surprise and goes down on her. She's visibly struggling and begging him to stop, only to end up arched back and screaming to the heavens moments later.
-   _Interviews with Monster Girls_: When Reluctant Succubus Sakie Satou was in the middle school, a boy named Takkun attempted to pick on her... and learned the hard way that the combination of her having studied some Judo and being a succubus turned his screams of pain from being tossed into screams of absolute joy and ecstasy. Needless to say, he's so thoroughly humiliated that a guy actually almost feels sorry for him. _Almost_.
-   Ayana from the hard ecchi manga _Kagaku na Yatsura_ is _constantly_ subjected to this, due to a combination of a submissive personality and and an _incredibly_ sensitive body; it takes almost nothing to start her gasping and quivering, and the wacky mad science shenanigans she gets thrown into (ie being attacked by a rampaging massage device, being shrunk and molested by earthworms, and in the book's Signature Scene, getting attacked by a horde of tentacle monsters _after_ she's accidentally taken a serum that makes her breasts even more sensitive than usual) bring orgasm after orgasm.
-   _Maken-ki!_:
    -   Seen during the flashback in chapter 69, when Haruko and Takaki recount what Love Espada did to them at the previous Himekagura Festival, during which she's shown with her back arched and her hand cupped over her mouth, as Espada was fingering her.
    -   Espada herself suffers this during chapter 79 due to taking an attack from Azuki's newly evolved Maken, which is strong enough to draw blood from her. The next scene is a full-page spread of Espada smiling with a full faced blush, as she squirts — complete with a sound effect hiragana.
-   _Manyu Hikencho_: Done by Kagefusa to Kaede as punishment for choosing to defect from the Manyuu clan, because of Kaede's loyalty to Chifusa. After a few tense moments of writhing and moaning, the scene quickly shifts to a shot of the night sky as Kaede screams. The camera pans back down to show that she's passed out from it.
-   _Monster Musume_:
    -   In her debut appearance, Kii the dryad inflicts one on Papi by wrapping her in vines — which of course occurs in a BDSM fashion — and tightening them until she orgasms. Papi, Kimihito, and Suu inflict one on Kii in turn by sucking and groping her breasts in an effort to remove the fertilizer-saturated water<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  from her body.
    -   Suu the Slime will frequently inflict this on the other girls in the household if she gets dehydrated or gets called on to takedown Rachnera whenever Rachnera, Centorea, or Miia try to sneak into Kimihoto's room for some late-night nookie, (as Centorea takes down Miia, and Rachnera takes down Centorea).
    -   Kimihito himself has inadvertently done this to Miia on one occasion when she falls asleep in his bed after wrapping herself around him, but being a lamia, she unknowingly nearly chokes Kimihito to death in her coils. The only way he's able to escape is by tugging on the tip of her tail, causing her to loosen her coils and climax soon after (as the tip of a Lamia's tail is highly sensitive to touch).
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Played for Laughs with Chachamaru, who feels pleasure from being refueled via the Wind-Up Key in the back of her head, which grows more intense as more magical energy is put in. Negi fails to notice it and enthusiastically winds the key while pumping way too much magic into it, and Chachamaru has to clamp her hands over her mouth to muffle her scream of pleasure and then falls into a panting heap, while Negi remains clueless.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: Trying to teach Tsukune to control his abilities as a ghoul, Ruby ties herself to him with a magical whip that will inflict painful shocks on her when his powers overflow. Ruby inadvertently turns out to be a masochist and gets off on the constant shocks, to the ire of the rest of Tsukune's harem when they arrive on the scene.
-   In one of the bonus chapters of _To Love Ru Darkness_, Yui ends up in a compromising position on a crowded train with a bag containing an artificial electronic cat-paw-toy pressed up against her crotch with no way to remove/disable it. Her scream and afterglow in the subsequent scene makes it pretty obvious what happened.
-   _Vermeil in Gold_: When the jealous Tsundere Lilia challenged Alto to a duel over his overly-familiar familiar, Vermeil (who is a succubus disguised from everyone else), she magically induces this trope on Lilia to end the duel.

    Comic Books 

-   _Gen¹³_: Nicole Callahan/Bliss' psychic powers let her overwhelm people with emotions, either via intense pain or extreme bliss, and she frequently uses the latter for sexual purposes, giving people "pleasure pulses" that cause extreme sexual pleasure to the point of orgasm, even if against their will, which makes her a Sex Goddess In-Universe. Although it's often used for Fan Disservice when she uses her powers on her brother to seduce and manipulate him into doing her bidding. She has also been known to kill some of her lovers during sex due to using her these powers beyond the point they can take it.
-   _The Sandman (1989)_ has a Babylonian Love Goddess, now working as a stripper in modern America, dance a crowd to death using her hypnotic powers. One man is literally jizzing up blood but is far too gone to care.
-   Played for Laughs in _Starfire (2015)_ when Starfire accidentally causes one of the Strata aliens to orgasm just by rubbing his head, which is a sensitive spot for his Bizarre Alien Biology.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Miranda Leevald/Stacy X is a mutant introduced in _Uncanny X-Men_ in the early 2000s with the power of controlling Pheromones to stimulate bodily sensations and functions, such as inducing orgasms or vomiting. For this reason, she was a very popular prostitute before joining the X-Men.
    -   Emma Frost uses her telepathy powers to stimulate the pleasure centers in a person's brain. In _New X-Men_, she used these powers to neutralize a hostile group of anti-mutant protestors, male and female, by "pushing their bliss buttons" causing a mass simultaneous case of Jizzed in My Pants so strong they all collapsed on the spot.
    -   _X-Treme X-Men (2001)_: Paradise, one of Masque's mutant underlings in her Gladiator Games, is capable of causing intense pleasure on whoever she touches to the point they unwillingly orgasm and even faint. Combined with Masque's other underling, Purge (who causes pain with his touch) they are used as Torture Technicians to break the prisoners, alternating them between extreme pain and pleasure.
    -   A very disturbing example occurs in the miniseries _The X-Men and the Micronauts_. Professor X falls under the control of the series' telepathic Big Bad, the Entity. He then uses Xavier's psychic powers on Dani Moonstar/Mirage to take control of her, and it's heavily implied he caused her to orgasm in the process, with the narration describing "psychic fingertips caressing her very soul" before she suddenly collapses on the floor "in the throes of pleasure" with an orgasmic facial expression.
-   In Phil Foglio's _XXXenophile_, the power of superheroine Orgasm Lass is to bring others to orgasm just by touching them.
-   The French comic _Yiu_ has a scene in which Yui's Mission Control (who currently has access to her cerebral implants) sends a jolt of electricity through the right sections of her brain to give her an orgasm. As she's currently hanging off the side of a building, she's not amused.

    Fan Works

It's particularly humiliating for Maddy and Martha, since the former was trying to intimidate Terry, while the latter was in the school hallways filled with students.
-   In _Barbarella_, the eponymous heroine falls into the clutches of the villain Durand Durand, who places her in his fiendish Excessive Machine, a device designed to orgasm the victim to death. However, Barbarella proves to be Too Kinky to Torture, overloading the machine and exhausting the villain.
-   In _Bruce Almighty_, Bruce is able to use his infinite godly powers to make his girlfriend have spontaneous orgasms while in another room.
-   _Hobo With a Shotgun_: During a fight with the Hobo, Slick gets electrocuted with a toaster. When it's over, he sits up while sparking and smoking and screams "You made me COME!" It's that kind of movie.
-   In _The Matrix Reloaded_, the Merovingian demonstrates his power within the Matrix by forcing a random woman in the restaurant with him to have an orgasm from _eating a piece of cake_.

Agatha herself is forced to orgasm by the GNE phone's A.I., and Walter finally has the GNE make Brittany orgasm in an attempt to get her to have sex with him.
-   In _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_, this is how Scott defeats Roxy Richter. Unable to overcome her fighting skills even with Ramona's help, Ramona (who has been... _intimate_ with her) shouts for Scott to touch the back of Roxy's knee as she prepares to ax-kick him. He does, cueing an Immodest Orgasm from Roxy as she explodes into coins.
-   _A Snake Of June_: A woman is blackmailed with revealing photos of herself and forced to engage in humiliating tasks, culminating with her blackmailer directing her to wear a remote-controlled vibrator in public while they stimulate her at random intervals, forcing her to orgasm. Subverted when she finds the photos where they promised to leave them, along with the vibrator's remote; she's seen standing against a wall with the remote turned to full blast, implying that she secretly enjoyed the experience.

    Literature 

By author:

-   In one of Eric van Lustbader's pulps, a female KGB officer gets payback on a superior who's blackmailing her by forcefully masturbating him while he's in his office... and wearing his uniform.

By work:

-   The infamous Ass Shove scene from _Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest_ has Hajime not only shoving a pile bunker up a dragon's backside (and learning it's female in the process) but torturing her by repeatedly hitting and twisting it. This awakens the dragon's masochistic side, and after he pulls it out a little more roughly than intended, she gets an orgasm, then takes her human form as Tio Clarce and begs him to be her master and punish her some more.
-   _Captive Prince_: While Damen is enslaved in the Decadent Court of Vere, his owner has him restrained so that an escort can perform oral sex on him for the courtiers' amusement. It's unambiguously portrayed as a sexual violation and a deliberate cruelty from the owner.
-   _Hannibal_: After Dr. Lecter is captured by Mason Verger, Mason's sister Margot tells Lecter she's helping her brother in vain hope that he'll donate sperm to impregnate her female partner, so that Margot's family will inherit the Verger fortune. Lecter nonchalantly tells her that one can obtain sperm by stimulating a male's prostate with a cattle prod... and also that he would gladly claim responsibility if Mason were to be murdered. She takes advantage of his advice.
-   _Kushiel's Legacy_: Protagonist Phèdre is an _anguisette_ and cursed to feel pain and pleasure as one, meaning any bit of pain will register as pleasure for her. When she gets her marque (a tattoo that covers most of her back), she's reduced to an orgasm-laden mess due to the pain. The guy doing the job even complains about how annoying it is to work on someone who is constantly writhing in ecstasy. This is also Played for Drama later when she's raped and tortured by her former lover Melisande, and Phèdre finds it deeply humiliating that she enjoyed it so much.
-   _Monster Girl Doctor_: A few of Glen's patients are implied to experience an orgasm when he has to examine some of their bizarre body parts that are rather sensitive for their species. The most explicit is Flesh Golem Kunai, who feels extreme sensitivity in the edges of her limbs and is mortified when the process of Glen stitching back her limbs causes her to orgasm, although she ends up respecting him as a doctor for remaining professional during the procedure. Glen later comments that the Mad Scientist who made her this way was mentally sick in more ways than one.
-   _Shimoneta_:
    -   This is actually exaggerated to parody levels because Anna Nishikinomiya has her sexual desires awakened from an Accidental Kiss and remains in a perpetual state of arousal where even the slightest thing (but _especially_ contact with Tanukichi Okuma) can make her orgasm.
        -   At one point, Hyouka manages to keep Anna at bay like this with a vibrating doorknob. Anna repeatedly tries to break down the door, but the doorknob vibrating in such close proximity to her crotch forces her to orgasm repeatedly.
        -   After Okuma gives Anna a pink egg<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  as a "gift", she instead wears it as a pendant, which gets stuck inside her massive chest. When she tries to pin down and sexually assault Okuma the egg malfunctions and constantly vibrates at max speed. While she has her (still vibrating) chest on Okuma's crotch, he comes close to climaxing... but fortunately for him, the egg breaks before that can happen.
    -   Tanukichi does it to Oboro in chapter of the manga version. He mistakes Oboro for a member of Gathered Fabric and wrestles her to the floor, resulting in his foot being pressed against her groin. It's at that moment that Tanukichi realizes that Oboro is _a guy_, but he uses his foot to "double-check" to be sure. It confirms his suspicion, but also inadvertently causes Oboro to get off from it.
-   _The Testament of Sister New Devil_: Female lead Mio has a curse seal placed on her that makes her a servant of male lead Basara. If she disobeys him or has other negative feelings towards him such as jealousy, it immediately activates the seal, which causes her to become aroused; the longer it stays active, the more aroused she gets. The only way to turn off the seal is for Basara to bring her to orgasm, but a key part of it is that she has to submit to his efforts to satisfy her, or else it still won't deactivate. Because she's an extremely stubborn Tsundere, the first time he had to relieve her, it took nine forced orgasms before she finally submitted to it. Averted later in the series: after she's genuinely fallen in love with him, he normally only needs to do it once or twice, if she even resists at all.
-   _WorldEnd: What Do You Do at the End of the World? Are You Busy? Will You Save Us?_: The pressure point massage Willem uses to treat venenum poisoning seems to cause his patients an extreme amount of pleasure, to the point of causing some involuntary orgasm. Chtholly is mortified and muffles her moans in the pillow, while Rhantolk has a series of immodest orgasms. Subverted when Nopht endures the massage — she simply feels tickles and laughs instead.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Breaking Bad_: After Hank is shot in an ambush, his recovery is hampered by his stubborn refusal to leave the hospital for home rehabilitation. Marie, while giving him a sponge bath, suddenly offers a wager: if she can stroke him off in under five minutes he has to check out. Hank takes the bet, insisting it isn't possible in his condition. Cut to a visibly pissed-off Hank being wheeled out of the hospital, followed by a smirking Marie.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. In "Where the Wild Things Are", a house is tainted by years of sexual repression thanks to extreme and violent woman who ran it as an orphanage. One of the weird things going wrong in the house is a spot on a wall that gives people orgasms whenever they touch it. The first person finds it by accident; after that, people are using it deliberately (though some are tricked into it).
-   A variation is seen in an episode of _CSI: NY_ when an investigation reveals that a college student died in the middle of a restaurant after she climaxed to death. The autopsy reveals that she had an experimental aphrodisiac that was being tested in a local university. At the end it was revealed that the girl told her sorority sister that she was still a virgin, so the leader of the chapter set a romantic night between her a fraternity member, and to ensure she enjoyed the night, spiked her drink with several times the recommended dose of the aphrodisiac. When she got nervous and ran out of the room, the frat boy followed her to the restaurant and tried to talk to her, which is when the aphrodisiac kicked in and she had an orgasm so strong that it eventually led to heart failure.

-   _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_:
