**Sabrina:** That was your wife I saw the other day, wasn't it?  
**Det. Danny Reagan:** Yeah, why?  
**Sabrina:** Let me ask you something. What does she got that I don't have?  
**Danny:** Me.

This trope is when a character who is married becomes immune to seduction because their marriage is a happy one and/or they have a strong sense of honor/propriety. It is often a sign of maturity as well as a show of being a good spouse. Many people are envious of their faithful and happy relationship. Sometimes paired with a lech to show the dichotomy. Count on this guy to be the one who keeps a cool head when the lech would fall apart.

Even the lowliest of Mooks can be shown to be honorable if they have a happy marriage. Often after the failed seduction, they will burn out the libido with their legal spouse.

Truth in Television: Even in this era of more relaxed sexual morals, a lot of people still take marriage vows seriously and will rebuff any attempts by third parties to seduce them. Equally, someone who is genuinely happily married will likely be getting adequate quantities of reasonable sex, which helps to blunt the effectiveness of seduction attempts; they won't be desperate.

Similar to Celibate Hero, as the character certainly recognizes the hints, but simply feels no urge to reciprocate due to being in a relationship. Sister Trope to Sorry, I'm Gay and related to Boyfriend Bluff, Attempted Homewrecker, and Wedding Ring Defense. Often overlaps with One True Love. Contrast I'm a Man; I Can't Help It and All Men Are Perverts.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Futari Ecchi_ has Makoto and Yura, being the story of how they get married as 25-year-old virgins and figure out sex together while growing as a couple. Yura is just so pure that she would never think of sleeping with anyone but Makoto. Makoto has strong perverted tendencies which include pornography and ogling other women, which sometimes extends to having an Imagine Spot where he sleeps with someone besides Yura... but at the same time he's Oblivious to Love regarding any woman besides Yura actually wanting to get with him in reality, and he would **never** willingly betray Yura because he loves her and wouldn't want to make her cry. He only gets into a couple of close calls because he's a bit of a pushover and sometimes gets roped into situations because he can't say no. He actually became such an unintentional Chick Magnet after getting married that various women try to seduce him, including his co-worker Makie, a girl at a beach resort, and the young new receptionist at his company who also fell for him, but he has preserved his virtue nonetheless. Word of God says that Makoto and Yura will never cheat on each other.
-   In _Fushigi Yuugi_, Miaka and Tamahome (or better said, his reincarnation Taka) get married later in the story and invoke the trope. It tuns out to be a problem since a later antagonist, Mayo Sakaki, is a girl with one _hell_' of a crush on him...
-   The Hentai doujin _My (Manly) Wife is NTR Proof_ sets up a typical Netorare scenario where the titular blue-collar worker wife, Mitsuki, is pressured by a “big shot” into cheating on her husband with him in exchange for him helping out her small company, and basically threatening the jobs of her subordinates if she refuses. She just decks him and tells him off, then has loving sex with her husband.

    Comedy 

-   Old joke: A man wakes up with a killer hangover. Fearing his wife's reaction, he crawls into the kitchen where he finds an enormous hand-made breakfast waiting on the table, with his wife gone to work and his son waiting for him. When he asks his son what this is for, the son replies "Well last night, you puked all over the doorstep, you crapped yourself and you tripped into Mom's favorite vase." "But why's she being so nice to me?" "Well, when she was trying to get you out of your dirty pants you shoved her away and screamed 'Fuck off, I'm married!'"
    -   A variation has the explanation provided by the extremely appreciative wife.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_: In _Batman: Dark Victory_, the series plays with this regarding Two-Face. Harvey Dent still regards himself as married to Gilda, but his Two-Face identity _isn't_, so he invokes and ignores this trope whenever it's convenient. For example, he fights off Poison Ivy's pheromones by remembering his love for Gilda. He also has an affair with another woman, the new DA, Janice Porter, but when he decides he no longer needs her:
    
    **Porter:** Tell them, Harvey! _Tell them that I love you and you love—_  
    _\[gunshot\]_  
    **Two-Face:** Harvey Dent is a married man, Porter. Don't ever forget that.
    
-   _Girls_: In the Luna brothers comic series, a small town is overrun by aliens who happen to look like beautiful young women, and promptly seduce any man they can so they can give birth to a cosmic horror. When one wife realizes that her husband is alone in his house with one of the alien girls, she and some other women storm the house intending to prevent him from impregnating the alien. But the man's wife is relieved to see that he has absolutely no interest in a sexual encounter, and instead, he has killed the alien and is dissecting her on the coffee table.
-   _Spider-Man_: Spider-Man gets a lot of attention from seductive female villains and female fans, while Mary Jane, a glamorous actress/model who has guys drooling after her and likes to party and dance, gets a lot of unwanted attention from men who think they will come and sweep her off. However, they are completely loyal to each other and would never cheat.
    
    -   In _The Spectacular Spider Man_ #166-172, when MJ was starring in the soap opera _Secret Hospital_, her male co-star attempted to seduce her. At one point, she gave the impression of being interested, but at the end of the story, she spelled out in no uncertain terms that she had no intention of leaving Peter.
    -   During the _Changes_ arc in _The Spectacular Spider Man_ Vol. 2, Spider-Man is kidnapped and is being looked after by a sultry villainess called the Queen, who offers him "anything he wants". He requested a solid cage thingy so she'll leave him alone as he was Happily Married to MJ at the time.
    -   In _Sins Remembered_, Sarah Stacy puts the moves on Peter after he saves her life and she discovers that he didn't murder her mother and he's not her father, and although she succeeds in kissing him once he turns her down due to being together with MJ, despite Sarah being identical her mother.
    -   During _The Amazing Spider-Man (J. Michael Straczynski)_, Spider-Man was being flown to Las Vegas via the private jet of a crime boss, Mr. Forelli. When a scantily clad stewardess started making veiled offers to Spider-Man, he sealed his seat away from the rest of the passenger compartment with curtains made out of his webbing, muttering, "Just slide the food through the webs and no one gets hurt."
    -   In "To Have and To Hold", a SHIELD agent who was formerly MJ's bodyguard in Los Angeles where they were friendly in a period where she and Peter were briefly separated tries to signal an interest in her, which she rebukes:
    
    **Mary Jane**: "Is that what you think we were? You work my security detail for a few months and now — now you’re Mr. S.H.I.E.L.D. man here to rescue me from my big, bad life? He’s my husband. You’re just some dude."
    
-   _Superman_: In one What If? comic (_Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #44_), Jimmy and Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) get married while Kara/Linda Lee Danvers has temporarily lost her powers and her memory of being Kryptonian to Red Kryptonite. When the effect wears off, she concocts a plan to minimize the shock to her new husband: she will get him to fall in love with her as Supergirl and then tell him she and Linda are the same person. The plan flops because Jimmy, while attracted to Supergirl, stays determined to remain faithful to Linda. Luckily, he tells her about it, letting her know he really doesn't dislike her alter-ego, and the story ends with Jimmy happily accepting that his wife is a superheroine.

    Fan Works 

-   In _What About Witch Queen?_, while not married to Kristoff yet, Anna doesn't even think about any men other than him, even when there's a naked sailor in a bathtub right next to her.

-   In _Star Wars Legends_ _Gladiatorial Jedi_, Luke is a prisoner of his former girlfriend Callista in her Gladiator Games ring. She comes into his cell at one point to try and seduce him, but Luke won't have any of it and would rather die than cheat on Mara.

-   In _A Wild Badfic Appeared! Commentaries_, Robin invokes this when Selene flirts with him in her debut. He tells her he's married, and she backs off immediately; however, it's merely invoked because the girl in question is only 11 years old.

She tries drugging him with a lust potion provided to her by Cora, only for it to just make him want Belle more. She tries getting pregnant and convincing him that it was his, even having his wife walk in on them, only for Rumpelstiltskin to lock her in the dungeon and set out to convince Belle of the truth.
-   In the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ fic "Do Ghosts Lie?", the B plotline involves a female Starfleet officer who is openly attracted to Chief Miles O'Brien and attempts to seduce him rather blatantly. The last scene of the fic shows Miles having a romantic dinner with his wife Keiko, making it clear that she's the only one for him.

    Film 

-   _Bull Durham_ has Ethical Slut Milly trying to pick up various members of the Durham Bulls at batting practice. One Deadpan Snarker responds to her flirty "Hi, I'm Milly," with "I'm married," in the exact same tone of voice.
-   In _Die Hard 2_, the airport clerk who helps John early on suggests they could go out later on. John shows off his wedding ring, and says "Just the fax, ma'am". Her timing was just a little off as this is the only film in the franchise where John and Holly are happily married.
-   In _The Red Baron_, one of the pilots at a burlesque bar has one of the girls hanging off his shoulders and he protests, "I'm married, you know!"
-   In the 2007 version of _Hairspray_, Alpha Bitch Velma tries to seduce Wilbur simply so she can cause strife between Wilbur and his wife.

-   _Big Fish_: When Edward came to the town of Spectre he befriended a young girl named Jenny who gained a Precocious Crush on him, despite him being ten years older than her.

-   In _Batman & Robin_, Mr. Freeze is completely devoted to his Human Popsicle ill wife Nora. His entire driving motivation to be a supervillain is to find a way to save her. He easily dismisses the flirtations of one of his henchwomen, and he's the only man who is not visibly affected by Ivy's pheromone dust, much to Ivy's anger. Freeze attributes his immunity to Ivy's pheromones to his condition rather than his love for Nora, however.
-   _Shrek_: Shrek and Fiona love each other dearly and have no interest in anyone else. This is especially shown in _Shrek 2_. When beautiful women hit on Shrek after he turns into a handsome human, he informs them he already has a true love. With Fiona, her father learns this after attempting to make her to be with Prince Charming instead and has a Heel–Face Turn, realizing he can't force Fiona to fall in love with someone else so he decides to go back on his promise to Fairy Godmother.
-   In _The Incredibles_, Bob and Helen have been married for 15 years and have three children but are clearly still in love and only attracted to each other. Even though things have become tense due to their clearly differing attitude on the Super Registration Act, they are still loving and supportive of each other. After Bob secretly takes a job doing freelance superhero work, he has a much happier outlook and they reinvigorate their romantic relationship. After Helen finds blonde hair on Bob's tuxedo, she fears he may have been actually cheating on her. Bob was faithful the whole time though and simply wanted to be a superhero again, still in love with his wife. Bob even calls Helen "the perfect woman".
-   In second _The X-Files_ film, there's a recurring plot point about the young, female ASAC on the case Mulder is called into consult on clearly being infatuated with him, having studied his work on the X-Files, and Mulder not even noticing—but Scully definitely noticing. After he shaves off his Beard of Sorrow, the agent is surprised, asks "what did you do?" in an accusatory manner, and tries to wipe away a bit of tissue paper from a shaving cut. Mulder impatiently bats her hands away, eager to get on with why she called him out to a crime scene in the middle of the night, but the look on Scully's face could _kill._

    Literature 

-   In the _World War_ novel _Aftershocks_, Johannes Drucker has been in space by himself for over a month, and is then caught by aliens. He is presented with a female human who has been raised by them (these are aliens who don't wear clothes), and when she asks if he would mate with her if given the chance, one of the reasons he gives for not wanting to is that he is married. Since the aliens also don't practice marriage, this doesn't really explain much to her, especially since she has already had sexual relations with a teenager who claimed he had a girlfriend back on Earth.
-   Played with in _Against the Tide of Years_, when Marian Alston and Swindapa (a married lesbian couple) visit a war chief and are offered a woman as part of the Sacred Hospitality. Alston, who takes marriage very seriously, has absolutely no interest in the girl, but Swindapa, who comes from a culture in which polygamy is the norm, is intrigued, even though she doesn't take advantage. This is somewhat par for the course in their relationship; throughout the book, Swindapa is rather shameless about her wandering eye, even though she never does anything more than look and occasionally enthuse.
    
    **Swindapa:** I promised to be monogamous, not blind.
    
-   _A Brother's Price_: Played straight with Jerin. As is the custom of his people he marries a group of sisters, to whom he is faithful ever after the engagement, even though a mysterious woman tries to seduce him. She turns out to be one of his wives.
-   _Belisarius Series_: Invoked by John of Rhodes when he says he is not really such a Casanova as rumored because he looks carefully to see who is seduceable and Antonia is completely unseducable, being Happily Married to Belisarius.
-   In _Captain French, or the Quest for Paradise_, the titular character has been married many times over his extremely long life (all of humanity is The Ageless). While no one expects "until death do us part" to still hold up, given that people no longer have a natural end to their lives, French still obeys the vows he gives in each marriage until it ends. At one point, a woman tries to seduce French at a party using an aphrodisiac perfume. He nearly succumbs to it and to the fact that her Buxom Beauty Standard breasts literally pop out of her blouse, but manages to snap out in time and use his cigar to keep the woman at bay. He then take his wife to their hotel and "relieves the pressure" from the aphrodisiac to the point where she half-jokingly calls him an animal in the morning. He also teaches a man, who asks him for advice in seducing French's wife, while offering to introduce him to several local girls, by giving him the exact wrong advice and watching his wife angrily hit the guy. Sure, he understands that the guy didn't think he was doing anything wrong by the mores of this planet, but still...
-   A close variant in _The Dresden Files: Blood Rites_. A White Court vampire's power to induce lust won't work on anyone who is truly in love (e.g. Harry Dresden, who is in love with Susan Rodriguez), and attempting to press the issue physically actually burns them. Harry also theorizes (in reference to the youngest Raith daughter) that a virgin White Court vampire who has their first time with the person they love might become human as a consequence. This causes Thomas Raith a serious problem when his lover Justine allows him to feed on her after a serious injury: the act of love means he can no longer touch her afterwards.
-   In _Fifty Shades of Grey_, Ana repeatedly feels jealous when other women flirt with or even check out Christian, but he's so in love with Ana that he scarcely notices the mere existence of these women. Christian feels the same way about virtually every man who has ever been in Ana's presence, but she is equally devoted to him.
-   _Full Disclosure:_ Bannerman passes up an opportunity to cheat on his wife of thirty-three years with Buffie, albeit in a haughty manner.
-   Subverted in _The Handmaid's Tale._ The protagonist, Offred, was married before the dystopia started, but reasons that being a Handmaid isn't adultery, since it's necessary for survival. However, consensual sex with the family's attractive servant _is_ definitely adultery, so she rejects him despite being extremely tempted. Later she has to have sex with him for the chance of surviving... but winds up doing it many more times, anyway. For what it's worth, she was "the other woman" while her husband was married to somebody else.
-   _If Life is a Bowl of Cherries — What Am I Doing in the Pits?_: Erma remarks early in the book that some women are "born married" and act accordingly regardless. Such a woman gives herself away with multiple signs, such as responding by Comically Missing the Point to flirtation at parties, answering bluntly about a pantyhose problem when a handsome stranger asks for a dance, eating onion-laden food when asked out by a Robert Redford lookalike, and bringing her husband when a single man asks her to spend some time and bring a friend. She also considers "Semper Fidelis" her and her husband's "song"
-   _I, Jedi_: crime boss Leonia Tavira tries to seduce Corran Horn, who's gone undercover in her Space Pirate gang to find his wife Mirax. He _is_ massively tempted, briefly tries to rationalize it, then decides it's the Dark Side of the Force talking. But Tavira's made it clear she wants him as her boytoy and won't take "no" for an answer long-term (despite his cover story including a committed relationship), so Corran accelerates his plans to break up her pirate alliance.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Jamie Lannister is not married (because he legally cannot for various reasons), but has been committed to Cersei for his entire life, despite being a Chick Magnet whose handsomeness is renowned through the Seven Kingdoms. He notes wryly that—despite the "immorality" of their relationship—this makes him one of the only faithful men in Westeros. He is rather disillusioned by learning that Cersei doesn't reciprocate. Cersei is... a complicated case. She uses sex as a weapon and seduces many men in order to influence them. Yet Jaime is still unquestionably the one and only great love of her life. In her inner monologue she says point-blank, "It had never been any good with anyone but Jaime," showing she's more monogamous at heart than it initially appears.
-   _Spenser_: Spenser is often propositioned, but he is committed to Susan (despite being "not exactly married").
-   _The State of Affairs_ is a non-fiction book by a couple's therapist about her experience working with couples impacted by infidelity. One of the major themes of the book is a Deconstruction of this trope: even a good marriage does not stop the allure of Forbidden Fruit.
-   In _Threadbare_, Thomasi, a Playa, ultimately rejects Chase's advances in the sixth book, claiming that he's happily married on the outside. When it's pointed out that he has slept around a lot in the game world, he claims that those meant nothing because there was no emotional connection.
-   In Mikhail Akhmanov's _Trevelyan's Mission_ series, the titular character loves the ladies, and his job as an Alien Among Us in primitive humanoid cultures typically requires him to use any means of achieving his goals, which, to his delight, often involves sex. Later in the series, however, he meets an Amazonian Beauty and proposes marriage by the end of the novel (after knowing her for a few days). Being from a conservative planet, she insists on an exclusive marriage, and he agrees, even promising to avoid sex when on a mission. In the following novel, a female from a race of beautiful Human Aliens with far more relaxed views on relationships and love tries to seduce him, not comprehending why he refuses her. He understands that she has no way of knowing about human marriages but still punishes her for her actions. Instead of stopping completely, she then shifts her focus to his wife, suggesting a polygamous relationship, pointing out that it's not uncommon on Earth—only to receive a reply that, as a woman of T'har, she has old-fashioned views on marriage.
-   In _The Twilight Saga,_ the bond between vampire mates is totally permanent, so much so that even the Volturi's Mind Control powers can't break it apart.
-   _The Wheel of Time_:
    -   Mat Cauthon is a ladies' man bordering on Pornomancer territory. Late in the series, he becomes married to the Seanchan empress Because Destiny Says So. Even though it's effectively an Arranged Marriage that looks like it will be completely sexless, he is scrupulous about honoring his vows, turning down several opportunities to get some on the side. (Fortunately for him, they fall in love eventually, though with hilarious Do You Want to Copulate? overtones on her part.)
    -   Perrin is able to shrug off powerful mind control that should make him utterly loyal to a particular villainess, by remembering that he loves his wife.
-   Beware of Chicken, Jin only has eyes for Meiling even when they are only betrothed, despite interacting with a number of very beautiful women. At one point he helps Meiling strip one of of those beautiful women to treat her injuries and is more distracted by watching Meiling work than the patient. Admittedly she was beat to crap at the time but still. At another point a woman is assigned to 'meet all his needs' and it is explicitly assumed that that will include sexual favours. He turns her down immediately.

-   _Billions_: Bobby Axelrod turns down a seduction by an attractive singer, saying that his marriage is "the real thing."

While he admits to having kissed Quinn once back in the day, when she pops back into his life in season 4 and starts flirting again, he makes it abundantly clear to her that it had been a mistake, that he never would've let things go any farther, and that it's best forgotten. She replies, "I get it" and never flirts with him again.
-   _Downton Abbey_: Branson is a seduction-proof widower after Sybil's death, not wanting any of what saucy maid Edna is blatantly offering.

-   _Everybody Loves Raymond_: This causes Ray Barone serious angst. First when he loses his wedding ring and a woman comes onto him at the airport; second when he (mistakenly) thinks Peggy the Cookie Nazi has made a pass at him. Both times he stays faithful to Debra. (Even though she always acts like he didn't.)
-   _Firefly_: In "Our Mrs. Reynolds", Wash resists Saffron's advances due to this. Saffron just loses her temper and clocks him on the head. His wife is suitably impressed and pleased. (In the previous scene, the thought-he-was-technically-married-to-Saffron Mal didn't stand a chance, and Inara only avoided being ensnared because she has the same training as Saffron and recognized the approach.)
    
    **Wash:** _Wuh duh ma huh tah duh fong kwong duh wai shung_,<sup>trans.&nbsp;</sup>  do I wish I was somebody else right now. Somebody not... married, not _madly_ in love with a beautiful woman who can kill me with her pinkie!

-   _Gilligan's Island_: Inverted in "Lovey's Secret Admirer", Mrs. Howell begins getting love letters from a secret admirer. When Mr. Howell questions him about the letters, the Professor declares that he isn't a "seething volcano", and he especially wouldn't write love notes to a married woman.

-   One episode of _Lois & Clark_ has a beautiful blonde Femme Fatale working with a bomber who's Happily Married. She makes several advances on him, but, despite being an unrepentant murderer, he declines them all. She doesn't take it very well, and when their plan unravels, she arranges for all the blame to fall on him.
-   On _Malcolm in the Middle_, for all of Hal and Lois's flaws, they're crazy in love and fiercely loyal to each other. Hal's deeply and genuinely offended at the suggested that he's even _looked_ at another woman since he and Lois met.
-   In _Married... with Children_, even though Al is very unhappy in his marriage and leers at every attractive woman, when he gets an actual chance to cheat on his wife, he always stays faithful. The only time he's seriously tempted is when the woman is Peggy in disguise.
-   _M\*A\*S\*H_
    -   Played straight by BJ Hunnicutt, who is (almost) completely faithful to his wife because of this. The one or two times he does get seduced he feels awful about it afterwards.
        -   Same goes for Colonel Potter. He admits to being attracted to other women at times, but he's very clear that his wife is the only woman for him and he would never act on those feelings.
    -   Played with in the case of Frank Burns and Margaret Houlihan. The former is married but is having an ongoing relationship with Margaret. When Margaret gets engaged, he thinks they can still fool around but she shoots him down.

-   Early in _The Mentalist_ Patrick Jane is faithful to his wife, declines all offers of seduction, and constantly wears his wedding ring—but he's technically not married, since his wife was murdered years before the series started. Later in the series he starts dating occasionally again, and even briefly takes a TV psychic for a girlfriend. He finally marries Lisbon in the series finale.
-   _The Middle_: Mike is trying to be more outgoing and strikes up a conversation with a female neighbor at a party. When he realizes she's reading way too much into his friendliness, he shuts it down fast.
-   _Monk_: The titular Adrian Monk is a widower unfailingly devoted to his late wife. He is largely oblivious to most women who flirt with him; while there are a few instances when he realizes he feels some attraction to other women (most of whom bear a resemblance to his wife), he never strays.
-   _The Office_: while on a business trip in Florida, Jim does everything he can to fight off the advances of interested new coworker Cathy, even going as far to call her out on her not at all subtle behavior, ultimately rejecting her because he's happily married. However, she is so persistent that he needs to use Dwight to finally scare her off.
-   _Outlander_: When Jamie is accused of coercing the daughter of one of their tenants into a sexual relationship which supposedly led to the girl's current pregnancy, it never even occurs to Claire to consider that he might be guilty. She knows Jamie would never cheat on her in a million years. She's more upset that the girl she's been mentoring would attack her marriage in this way and she's also concerned that the Protestant tenants may be willing to believe the worst of Jamie simply because he's Catholic.
-   _Parks and Recreation_: A Running Gag is how Ron's ex-wife Tammy 2 can turn him into a spineless sex freak whenever she visits. Once Ron starts going out with Diane, though, he becomes completely immune to her "charms", and the marriage just seals the deal.
-   _Raising Hope_: Burt and Virginia. Although Burt _does_ flirt with his customers to get things like lemonade, he really only wants to be with Virginia. His Happy Place is even an island where he has a harem of the hottest women in the world... and they're all Virginia, and he states that if she were to die, he wouldn't remarry or even hook up with anyone else. And while he _does_ spend time at a local gay bar, he just likes the atmosphere, and the one person he leaves with is Virginia in disguise. For her part, Virginia is always loyal and faithful to him as well.
-   In the Russian remake of _Married... with Children_, _Happy Together_ (_Schastlivy vmeste_), Al Bundy's expy Gena Bukin is just as faithful to his wife, but in one episode he comes close to cheating on her, resolving the situation by having his wife wear a blonde wig to make her look like the new crush.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Elaan of Troyius", Kirk is infected by alien tears that cause men to be madly in love with the woman who shed them.

        -   O'Brien, in fact, has several opportunities to cheat on Keiko throughout the show. He refuses every one.
        -   The episode "Fascination" indicates that the feeling is mutual. While the rest of the station is going loopy with love, letting latent attractions come to the surface, Miles and Keiko never show any attraction to anyone other than each other. Lampshaded at the end of the episode when Miles tells Keiko that he wasn't among the affected.
            
            **Keiko**: (_teasing_) So you're saying you don't have any latent attraction for me?  
            **Miles**: Believe me, there's nothing latent about it. Weren't you paying attention last night?
            
-   _White Collar_: Peter Burke and his wife Elizabeth are Happily Married, to the point that, when Peter has to go undercover and flirt with a mark, he worries that Elizabeth will be jealous—and she usually laughs merrily at the thought of him cheating. Yeah, they're that tight. She even gives him seduction pointers a few times, considering he's a bit rusty in that department.

    Music 

-   In the Paula Abdul song _Forever Your Girl_, the type of relationship is never decisively stated, but the singer is quite adamant about being loyal that though there is a boy rumored to be trying to seduce her away from the one she gave her heart, she says "Even if he promised me the world" she'll always be "forever your girl".
-   The Mike Oldfield song "Family Man" (later covered by Daryl Hall & John Oates) is implicitly about this: a man is approached by a prostitute but he strongly rebuffs her advances, saying he's a "family man" (and, presumably, doesn't want the damage done to his marriage and family if he takes up her offer and is found out by his wife).
-   Tim McGraw's "She Never Lets It Go To Her Heart."
    
    _'Cause she never lets it go to her heart  
    She never lets it go that far  
    When they start talking  
    She starts walking  
    Right back to my arms  
    She can turn every head  
    But she never lets it go to her heart_
    

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Eric Young and ODB, especially since the former used to be a poster girl for anything that moves, or anything that offers a smoke or drink.

    Religion & Mythology 

-   In Greek Mythology, all of the Trojan princes fell in love with Helen of Troy except for Hector, because he was already so in love with his own wife, Andromache.
-   Averted in Celtic Mythology, where Cú Chulainn Really Gets Around despite being Happily Married to Emer. The difference from this and most myths is that Emer seems fine with this, as long as it's _just_ sex—the one time that it looked like her "little hound" might actually leave her for the other woman (a goddess, incidentally), Emer and her friends attacked them with knives.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Kindred of the East_, an _Old World of Darkness_ supplement covering Japan, featured animal spirit shapeshifters who like to seduce humans For the Evulz. It's specifically stated that their seduction powers don't work on anyone who is serious about being faithful to their spouse, or a vow of celibacy.
-   _The Dark Eye_: Priests of the goddess of home, hearthfire and matrimony/family get bonuses on resistance against magical seduction. So does everyone else who embraces the principles of that goddess and has stated such on their character sheet.
-   A Romulan-centric supplement for the _Star Trek The Next Generation Role Playing Game_ states that upper-class Romulans often marry to achieve political aims rather than for love. They're expected to remain faithful to their spouses even if the marriage isn't happy, as Romulans consider adultery tantamount to treason.

    Theatre 

-   In _Damn Yankees_, Joe manages to resist Lola's best efforts at vamping him and stays as close as he can to the wife who no longer recognizes him after his transformation into a young baseball hero. His fidelity infuriates Applegate, to whom wives are "more trouble than the Methodist Church."
-   _The Merry Wives of Windsor_: The titular wives aren't interested in love letters because they're married - though the suitor being Falstaff certainly doesn't help anything. The Pages exemplify this the most, as Mr. Page completely disregards a warning of the affair because he trusts her to not cheat, but after Mr. Ford has been taught a lesson in trust, it's shown that this also applies to the Fords' marriage.

    Video Games 

-   In _Wild ARMs 3_, Clive give this as his reason for turning down the seduction attempts of one of the villains. She does not take it well, and in the ensuing boss fight, will only attack the other party members if Clive is dead
-   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, if you choose to arrange a political marriage between Alistair and Queen Anora, he will usually break off a romance with the Warden. Taking a particular dialogue option in his companion quest gives you the option to become his mistress, however; and if _you_ romance and then marry him (only possible if you're playing a female Human Noble), the marriage is said to be extremely happy and almost certainly fits the trope.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_: During the Sith Inquisitor mission on Voss, you meet researcher Athelis Kallis, who, if male Inquisitors choose the flirt option, states that she's married. Happily Married.
-   _Crusader Kings II_'s "Way of Life" DLC sets a flag on a married character that rebuffed seduction attempts. This flag makes their spouse more attracted to them. AI characters with certain traits (such as Chaste) are much more likely to do this, as are characters who are in love with their spouse.
-   Like in _Grand Theft Auto_, there are prostitutes hanging around the towns you can visit in _Red Dead Redemption_. Unlike in _Grand Theft Auto_, player character John Marston won't make use of their services. If he passes by one and she propositions him, he'll politely turn her down with something along the lines of "Sorry, ma'am, I'm married."
    -   You can't sleep with them in _Red Dead Redemption II_ either. Arthur isn't married but once you pick up as John, he'll say he's married and turn them down again. There is one whose proposition you can accept (even as John) but she robs you.
-   _Mass Effect 3_: During the party in the _The Citadel_ DLC, Ashley distracts guards by flirting with them, one of whom responds by saying that he's very flattered and also married.

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Elan tries to escape from prison by creating an illusion of a beautiful woman. Unfortunately, one of his guards is gay and the other one is married.

    Web Original 

-   In _Receiver of Many,_ Apollo tries to seduce Persephone when she visits Olympus. It doesn’t work because Persephone loves her husband very much and has no intentions of cheating on him, even if theoretically they aren’t supposed to see each other for six months each year.

    Western Animation 

-   Peter Griffin of _Family Guy_ may be amoral and sociopathic, but he would never willingly cheat on his wife. Even when given permission. That said, both he and Lois have slept with Bill Clinton.
-   In "Hercules and the Arabian Nights", an episode of _Hercules: The Animated Series_ that is also a crossover with _Aladdin: The Series_, Phil begins flirting with Princess Jasmine. She cuts him off with a curt "I'm married," and he apologizes.
-   On _King of the Hill_, Dale Gribble is happily married to the point that, when another woman hits on him, he's not even aware it's happening. When he finally does notice it he's only confused, because after all, the other woman _knew_ he was married. (This, of course, is in contrast to his wife Nancy, who cheated on him for years before eventually breaking the other relationship off.)
-   Homer Simpson and Marge Simpson of _The Simpsons_ are, over the long, long course of the series, each given ample opportunities to cheat, and are sometimes even tempted (most notably Marge with Jacques in Season 1 and Homer with Mindy in Season 5), but by episode's end they are always back together, the temptation forgotten.
    -   Such is the prevalence of this trope that Jacques and Mindy are seen bowling with Lurleen Lumpkin and Princess Kashmir, two other would-be seductresses, as "The Homewreckers".
-   On _American Dad!,_ Jeff has been abducted by aliens, is pining for Hayley, and is going to be castrated the next day. A shapeshifting alien offers him one last night of sex, and even takes Hayley's form so he can pretend to spend it with her. Jeff almost goes through with it, but ultimately realizes that if it's not the Hayley he knew, it wouldn't be worth it.
    -   In one episode, Stan feels self-conscious about the fact that he's only ever slept with Francine while she Really Got Around before their marriage. Noting that he assumes that sex always equals love, she says that he can sleep with another woman just to learn that it can be meaningless, but he refuses. Their solution is basically an Invoked case of Divorce Is Temporary.
-   _Koala Man_: In "The Handies", while bonding with the God of Realizing Your Potential, Vicky nearly kisses him but she stops herself from going through with it because despite the things Kevin put her through with his Koala Man antics, she could never hurt Kevin like that. The God is understanding of Vicky and lets her know if it doesn't work out with Kevin, she has options.
