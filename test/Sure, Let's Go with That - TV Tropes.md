**Marge Simpson:** Were you talking to me, Grandpa?  
**Abe Simpson:** Um... yes.

Alice has been acting suspicious. Bob knows she's up to something, watches her, and... comes to the wrong conclusion. He confronts Alice with what he thinks he knows, and Alice, to keep him from discovering her real secret, lets Bob think he got it right. May lead to a Maintain the Lie to keep Bob from catching on.

Sometimes Bob confronts Alice with a vague phrase like "I know your secret", and each of them thinks the other is talking about something different until Bob (it's always Bob) comes right out and says what he thinks the secret is.

And sometimes it's not relating to a secret at all; Bob, for whatever reason, has just got completely the wrong idea about what's going on and Alice just doesn't have the time, energy or patience required to correct him, either because events are too complex to summarise and/or because she knows Bob is simply too dense to understand it. Alice therefore decides it's just quicker and easier for everyone if she goes along with it and lets Bob continue believing his skewed perspective on things.

Sub-Trope of Entertainingly Wrong. Compare Bait-and-Switch Accusation and Hey, Wait! (both tropes where someone appeared to catch the character red-handed, but actually noticed some other trivial thing) and Embarrassing Cover Up (the character "admits" some other explanation for the suspicious behavior).

This can also be used by a quick thinker trying to convince someone to do something: simply let _them_ come up with what they want out of it, and lie, affirming that that very thing _will_ be in store for them if they come along.

If this manifests out-of-universe, such as a work's author replying to fan speculation with a "sure, let's go with that" and making it Canon, see Ascended Fanon.

This echoes an earlier scene in which the Devan Merchants' Association hires Skeeve to defend them from the Mob, not knowing he was the one who originally brought the Mob to Deva.

-   In Honorverse Mike Henke derails at least one of the Mesan Alignment's schemes by this. By that point the Alignment has long been manipulating the protagonists' nation of Manticore into the war with the Solarian League, the ancient, vast and incredibly corrupt nation containing most of the Humanity's population. Naturally, they assumed that the Manties would avoid provoking the League, at least at that point, and tried a little gambit to ruin their reputation as a side, by putting their agent (posing as a Manticoran one) on the League's border, promising aid to various La Résistance movements in that restive region. The initial plan is to crush these local uprisings by betraying them and not providing any aid, thus in one blow getting rid of troublemakers, one planet at a time. A secondary objective is that if word ever got out, and the Manticorans ever became aware of the scheme, they assume that the Manticorans would do the logical thing and avoid a direct confrontation with the League and thus fail to provide the promised aid, crippling their reputation among the smaller nations who would also hear about it or anyone who might be inclined to side with them. Unfortunately to them, Mike, when alerted of the scheme by an agent of one of the rebellions contacting her independently, takes the news and runs with it, ordering all admirals and commodores of her station to give all the advertised aid against the League, and more if possible.

-   A subtle examples appears in _The Invisible Man_. At one point Griffin, the titular invisible man, takes refuge with Dr. Kemp, an old university friend, and makes the assumption that Kemp is going to shelter and help him with his plans. Griffin's plans are all quite mad, however, and Kemp — having clocked that Griffin is neither on the side of the angels nor has all his marbles in the same bag — has actually summoned the police. This means that a substantial part of their conversation in the latter chapters of the book is essentially Griffin bragging about his experiments and grandiosely making plans for 'their' future efforts, while Kemp is nodding along and every so often looking at his watch to see how much longer he has to wait before the police show up. The pretence gets harder for Kemp the longer Griffin rants on and the more insane and vicious his plans get.

Millie's aunt and her daughters resent Emma for it, so that's why Emma avoids them. Emma quickly assures Millie that, yes, of _course_ that would be the explanation.

-   _Cormoran Strike Novels_
    -   Cormoran has long given up trying to correct people who mispronounce his name as "Cameron" since as a detective it makes for a more cooperative witness for him to just go with the flow. In one instance in _Career of Evil_ he actually gives his name as "Cameron" to a subject that he suspects wouldn't be able to grasp his real name.

-   _The Rise of Phoenixes_: Zhi Wei thinks Ning Yi wants her to spy on Zi Yan. He actually wants her to go to Qingming Academy for her safety, but he pretends her idea was his plan all along. Then Zhi Wei figures out the real reason, but Ning Yi continues to insist he wants her to be a spy.
-   In an episode of _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_, Sabrina is trying to retrieve a magical duplicator box she accidentally sold to Mr. Kraft (who is using it to duplicate a lot of gold bars). However, Sabrina is having a magical crisis that is causing parts of her body to rot (long story), which happens in front of Mr. Kraft (but heals at that point as well). Mr Kraft accuses her of being... a space alien. Sabrina says "OK!" and turns into an armored humanoid alien, congratulates Kraft on recognizing her despite having "taken the form" of one of his students, and orders him to return "their" box and give ALL the gold to charity (threatening him with "the probe" when he's reluctant to comply).
-   _Saturday Night Live_:
    -   Bryan Cranston reprised his _Breaking Bad_ role as Walter White in a sketch in which Walter had been appointed head of the DEA by President-elect Trump.
        
        **Jake Tapper:** Mr. White, how did you even get considered for this job? Do you know Donald Trump?  
        **Walter White:** No. Nope. But I'm a big fan, I like his style, he acts first and then asks questions later. I also like that wall he wants to build. Nothing comes in from Mexico, meaning, a lot less competition for the rest of us.  
        **Jake Tapper:** You mean jobs?  
        **Walter White:** _\[brief chuckle\]_ Sure.
        
    -   When Gal Gadot was host, in one sketch she played a Bosnian woman on a date with OJ Simpson. Because of her country's civil war in the 90's, she completely missed the media circus that was his murder trial and had no idea who he was, which he played to his advantage. When people at the restaurant made negative remarks towards him, she was appalled and asked OJ if they hated him because he was black. He replied, "Uh...Yes."
-   In _Scrubs_, when the Janitor and Dr. Cox get into a fight about the dispensation of a high-quality patient's room, each wanting it for himself...
    
    **Dr. Cox:** There really is only one way to end this.  
    **Janitor:** We each ingest a cyanide capsule, on three. One, two, three. _(gulp)_  
    **Dr. Cox:** No! What are you _doing?_  
    **Janitor:** Mine's a skittle.  
    **Dr. Cox:** ...Mine too?  
    _(Beat)_  
    **Janitor:** ..Sure.
    
-   In an episode of _Sesame Street_, Papa Bear and Mama Bear welcome a second cub. Baby Bear goes to meet her and wants to know her name, but their parents haven't thought of one.

-   _Skins_: Naomi and Emily have danced around each other for the entire season. They are at a party, both being three sheets into the wind.
    
    **Naomi:** _\[motioning between the bottles in her hand\]_ So, what do you want?  
    **Emily:** _\[completely mesmerized by her\]_ Anything. Just give me a fucking...Just.. Just give me a..._\[leans over and kisses her; Naomi shows absolutely no resistance\]_  
    **Naomi:** Oh... _\[her denial catches up with her libido\]_ It's only the drugs, right?  
    **Emily:** ...Sure.  
    _\[the two start to make out like crazy\]_
    
-   In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Mirror, Mirror", "Captain's Woman" Marlena notices that Kirk is acting oddly. Kirk gives her an ambiguous explanation and lets her interpret it to mean that he's planning to take over the Empire.
-   A variation occurs in the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "I, Borg". When the eponymous drone, Hugh, first meets Picard, he recognizes him as Locutus of Borg. Picard decides to play along, expecting that if he thinks he's talking to another member of the collective, Hugh will prove Picard's suspicions about him correct. What Hugh does instead shocks him.
-   _The Drew Carey Show_ episode "The Engagement" has a psychologist named Dr. Rider (played by Eugene Levy) evaluate Mimi for her lawsuit against the store. When he says that he finds Mimi fascinating, Mimi interprets it as flirting with her. Dr. Rider then says that he doesn't date patients. When she asks if it was because he took an oath, he responds, "OK."
-   _The Thin Blue Line_ episode "Honey Trap" featured Detective Inspector Derek Grim and Inspector Raymond Fowler using Constable Maggie Habib as a Honey Trap to capture a criminal. Fowler's girlfriend, Sergeant Patricia Dawkins, thought that he and Maggie were having an affair. In retaliation, Dawkins broke something valuable to Fowler, who claimed it represented all the values he stands for. She then replied he doesn't stand for any and mentions knowing what he and Maggie are doing. Wrongly believing she figured out about the Honey Trap, he comments about it, revealing to her the truth. She then let him think he was right, and he tells her he agrees with her reaction.
-   _That '70s Show_ tends to have this occur every now and then:
    -   During Season 4, when he and Donna are broken up, Eric goes to pick her up from the radio station she works at to escort her to the school dance as a friend. Though once he shows up, Donna is ecstatic that he showed up, assuming he came to save or keep her safe from the tornado that was going on at the time. Eric initially plays along with the assumption, though he is visibly nervous to realize that there was a tornado going on when he finds out about it from her. She finds out later that he never knew about the tornado but forgives him for lying.
    -   When Hyde and Kelso are caught by Jackie, Red, and Kitty at the Burkhart family ski lodge when the latter three arrive to move out the furniture, Jackie assumes that Hyde arrived to help her. Hyde, being Jackie's boyfriend, plays into it. Unfortunately, Fez, arrives with the beer they planned on drinking and the boys are caught red-handed.
    -   After returning home from having been stripped naked by a group of feminists who mistook his make-out session with Donna as an attempted rape or assault, Eric is assumed to have had his body hair shaved off by Hyde's father. Eric, who is often mocked by his friends and his father for his lack of manly qualities, visibly pauses before saying, "Yes... they did."
    -   When Kelso and Fez arrive in a quality apartment, they are denied rental by the landlord, Fenton, whom Fez has an largely unknown but bad past with. When they make to leave, Kelso offhandedly mentions raising his daughter (with a woman he once slept with) in the apartment. Fenton assumes that the fact that two young men are raising a baby girl in an apartment signifies that they're gay and, as an implicitly proud homosexual man himself, is willing to renegotiate. While Kelso and Fez never hear about this, Red is in the room when Fenton states his assumption and, amused by it, plays into it to help Kelso and Fez move into the apartment so he doesn't have to put up with them as much, with the two none the wiser about Red's negotiation.

    Music 

-   The famously bizarre music video for Front 242's Headhunter was a result of this trope. A misunderstanding of the lyrics and some crossed wires between the band and director Anton Corbijn resulted in the everpresent image of eggs. The band decided that they liked it this way.

    Radio 

-   In _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme_, when a clueless man is making the preparations to hold his wedding at what is very obviously Castle Dracula, The Renfield (who is named Igor) keeps doing this. It turns out the "groom" is actually the Count doing a practice run, and he complains Igor is making it obvious.
    
    **Groom:** Tell me, does that organ still play?  
    **Igor:** Oh, yes. In fact it usually...  
    _(opening bars of Toccata and Fugue in D minor)_  
    **Igor:** There we are.  
    **Groom:** Wow. You have an organist on permanent standby?  
    **Igor:** I... suppose we must do, yes. Now, a couple of things. It's very important you don't use any Christian music or, you know, symbols of any kind during the service.  
    **Groom:** Ah, because you're only licensed for secular services.  
    **Igor:** ...Yes, that'll be it. Also, for the reception, we're only licensed for... non-garlicky meals.
    

    Theatre 

-   After having to prove he didn't embezzle from the Treasury by revealing his extramarital affair, the title character of _Hamilton_ asks if Jefferson, Madison, and Burr will keep the secret, to which Burr ambiguously says "No-one else was in the room where it happened." (Understandably not reassured even after demanding a concrete answer, Hamilton decides to reveal it all himself.)
    
    **Hamilton:** Is that a yes?  
    **Jefferson, Madison, & Burr:** Uh... yes.
    
-   In _Cactus Flower_, Julian has to agree with Toni's suspicion that the embarrassing secret about Stephanie is that she's a nymphomaniac, because he couldn't confess the simple truth to her about Stephanie not being married to him.
-   The following exchange from _The Drowsy Chaperone_:
    
    **Chaperone:** Me. No. Bride. Perhaps I can take a message.  
    **Adolpho:** Yes, yes, very good... Dear Van De Graaf Bride. I must make love to you, and transport you to place of ecstasy, sooner is better, signed Adolpho, King of Romance.  
    **Chaperone:** Well, well, you saw through my little ruse.
    
-   The _Mrs. Hawking_ play series: In _Vivat Regina_, Nathaniel, desperate to keep the secretary to the German ambassador from entering her offices during a party which Mrs. Hawking is casing, remarks that he's only there to support the classical singer that's being feted. The secretary excitedly asks "You are a devotee of the German opera?" After a moment, Nathaniel declares "Why, _yes_!" and goes on about Wagner, even though it's clear he's making things up as he goes. It's the first sign of his skills as The Face on the team.
-   In _Anything Goes_, Billy Crocker is mistaken for Public Enemy Number 1, Snake Eyes Johnson. However, instead of arresting him, the celebrity cruise line, which had been suffering a lack of celebrities, hails him as a hero. Not wanting to be left out, Billy's criminal friend Moonface Martin (Public Enemy #14) tries to reveal his own public enemy status.
    
    **Moon:** I'm Moonface Martin! I'm a public enemy, too.  
    **Crowd:** Public Enemy Number 2?!  
    **Moon:** ...Yes.
    

    Stand-up Comedy 

-   One of Jeff Dunham's earlier opening routines has him talk about how his Peanut puppet set off an airport contraband swab scanner after reading as plastic explosives. The TSA guy suggests that the scanner might have confused lotion for explosives, and Jeff immediately denies this given the implications<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , cheerily insisting "I've been making bombs in my garage!"

    Tabletop Games 

-   In one of the first edition _Exalted_ sourcebooks, this is the advice given to young Solars who want to use their powers to help people without drawing the attention of the Wyld Hunt. There are many ways to acquire superhuman powers in the setting, and the common people don't know enough to tell them apart, so whatever they guess that your powers come from, tell them that that's exactly it. Are you the son of a god? _Yes._ Do you possess an artifact from the First Age? _Yes._ Did a sorcerer enhance you with a spell? _Got it in one._

    Video Games 

-   Ford Cruller of _Psychonauts_ was severely psychologically damaged in an important battle years ago, and becomes scatterbrained, to say the least, when taken away from the large levels of Psitanium located underneath the camp where the game takes place. When he leaves the metal, he takes on split personalities who have no trace of Cruller's intelligence and wherewithal. He tells Raz, the protagonist, that this is because he wants to keep his identity a secret, so he 'pretends' not to recognize Raz. Cruller doesn't reveal the real reason until much later in the game.
-   _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_ uses this in Hugh's recruitment conversation, when he mentions that he needs the money for his grandmother, Roy immediately asks if she's sick. "Uh, yeah, really sick". He later mentions that "she gets really bad headaches around her back" as an "example of the pain" that she suffers from. Roy suspects that something's up, but doesn't press the issue.
    -   Hilariously enough, you eventually recruit his grandmother 3-4 levels later. And no, she doesn't have any illnesses: on the contrary, she's a healthy and very potent Druid.
-   In _Fallout 3_, the player character often comes across people who are either a bit kooky, have a bit of a misguided view of the world as it was / is or are quite crazy. In the dialogue options, there's usually at least one which enables the player character to politely humour the NPC in order to enable the conversation to progress. There's also usually an option for the player character to simply bluntly and rudely point out how crazy the NPC is.
-   In _Alpha Protocol_, making Mike play along with the crazy is the best way to curry favour with resident completely insane Conspiracy Theorist Steven Heck.
-   In the Netherbattle Tournament DLC for _Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten_, Fenrich encounters an imaginary Tyrant Valvatorez created from his "intense desires." Hearing this, Fenrich starts thinking out loud and realizes that if this Valvatorez is a figment of his imagination, then he could do _anything_ Fenrich wanted, even something like-
    
    **Imaginary Valvatorez:** Correct! I will win this tournament and rule the Netherworld, if that is your wish!  
    **Fenrich:** _\[Beat, then sweatdrop\]_ Y-Yes, my lord! It is!
    
-   _The Matrix: Path of Neo_ has a variant of this when Neo tries to start an Escort Mission.
    
    **Old herbalist:** _\[sees Neo standing silently in front of him\]_ Is it my time?  
    **Neo:** _\[confused\]_ What, just like that?  
    **Old herbalist:** You are a demon, and I accept my fate.  
    **Neo:** _\[more confused\]_ _Demon_? Why do you keep calling me a demon?  
    **Old herbalist:** A demon that does not think it is a demon, you are very odd.  
    **Neo:** _\[gives a Fascinating Eyebrow\]_ Oh, whatever, we'll go out the back.
    
-   During their pursuit of the Tidal Crystal in _Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric_ (as seen in the E3 demos), Amy volunteers to accompany Sonic while Tails and Knuckles head back, or so she suggests. Knuckles takes offense to her taking charge... only to suggest the exact same strategem the very next sentence.
    
    **Sonic:** You win this round, Knuckles. Amy, let's go.
    
-   In _Eternal Sonata_, when the party is supposed take care of the "ghosts" underneath the Mandolin Church, Allegretto decides to jet and fetch Polka, his crush who is currently separated from the party. Viola suggests that the reason he's leaving is because he's scared of ghosts, and he happily seizes on that excuse, stating that he never told anyone before, but he's super-scared of ghosts.
-   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky_ has an example that's only noticeable in hindsight (or if you've fallen victim to Late-Arrival Spoiler, since _Falcom_ doesn't bother to hide it anymore). At the start of Chapter 2 of FC, Scherazard confronts the Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass Olivier, claiming she knows full well who he _really_ is and that there's no point in hiding it: he's an Erebonian operative. He gives in and say she's right. He's really much, _much_ more than that: he's _the prince of Erebonia_.
-   In Chapter 2 of _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_, Emma uses her special brand of magic to heal a wound Rean got while jumping in to protect Jusis and Machias from a monster they thought they had all taken down. Later, Rean comments on how amazingly well his shoulder feels, asking Emma if she used some special sort of medicine. She starts to say that she didn't, then... "I-I mean, yes, I did! I used a special kind of medicine I brought with me from back home. My grandmother made it by combining a number of medicinal herbs together, I believe..." Later, in Chapter 6, she recognizes the barrier sealing the party inside Lohengrin Castle, saying that she's always had a sixth sense about these sorts of things. Jusis mentions that adherents of the Septian Church have often been said to have strange powers and asks if she's with the church. She at first says that it's kind of the opposite, but then backtracks and says "You've got me! I've always been a big supporter of the church." Also, at one point, Sara has to leave for a while to help Toval with some bracer work, leading the students of Class VII to quip about her having a hot date. When she returns, Rean discovers her muttering about all the work that Toval gave her and asks her how her "hot date" went. Sara is at first confused, but then seizes upon what Rean just gave her, saying that it was great, with plenty of action.
    
    **Rean:** Yeah, I want to believe it, but somehow I don't think so.
    
-   In _Hometown Story_, one of the story arcs involves a foreign girl named Lamisa being found on the town's beach and staying with the person who found her while gradually learning the local language. The very last scene relating to her reveals that she did this regarding her name. It's not her name, which she never bothered to correct once her grasp on the local language got better, but her native language's word for "thank you".
-   In _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_, any dealings you have with Mistress Therana will involve this. The other Telvanni councilors note that "she hasn't aged well," and getting anything out of her requires you to play along with whatever insane story she is telling at the moment.
-   In _Blaster Master Zero_, Jason asks Eve what she knows about the mutants. She pauses for a second and then replies that the database on the Sophia the 3rd doesn't call them "mutants", but sure. She then enthusiastically uses all the names Jason has like "Mutant Lord" for the enemies for the rest of the game. What, is she going to hurt their feelings?
-   This is a big premise in _Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out!_. Shallow Larry Laffer goes for the ultimate pursuit of Shamarra Payne, who is a beautiful and rich guest staying at the same hotel. She states that despite being rich, successful, and happy, she lacks purpose in her life. As Larry presents various gifts to her, she concludes that each gift must be Larry's way of teaching her something about life: An orchid refers to the uniqueness of nature, a diamond means that whatever pressure she has is forming her into something beautiful, etc. Larry is by no means a deep thinker, but does not correct her since all he wants to do is sleep with her and these insights don't seem to jeopardize that.
-   In _Spandex Force: Superhero U_ Calculatron states that he's planned his entire educational path up to level 50, as well as what super powers to choose.
    
    **Player character:** Isn't that a bit...  
    **Calculatron:** Neat and orderly? Planned? Precise?  
    **Player character:** Um...yes, let's go with that.
    
-   Not long into _Spider-Man (PS4)_, Otto Octavius catches Peter trying to fix his damaged Spider-Man suit, and is stunned to realize that his lab assistant is... Spidey's gadget guy. Peter goes along with this. During the climax, however, Otto reveals he knows the truth, so either he worked it out or was only ever sparing Peter's feelings.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_: Queen Nia informs the party of the location of the Big Bad's base of operations, but admits to having no idea how to actually get there. After a "Eureka!" Moment, the protagonists figure it out for themselves, and assume that the Queen must've been testing their ingenuity and character to make sure they were ready for the challenges ahead. Needless to say, Nia doesn't bother correcting them.
    
    **Sena:** You knew we'd be coming back though, right? It's all part of your grand design, yeah? "The future must be sculpted with one's own hands." Something like that?  
    _\[Beat\]_  
    **Queen Nia:** R-right, certainly. The future isn't something you can just be given. You do have to reach for it with your own hands. Yes.
    
-   _Idol Manager_: One possible event consists of a fan reporting getting help from one of the idols on social media, but the idol not remembering the incident, to an extent that she suspects Mistaken Identity. Two of the possible reactions are to not communicate at all or have the idol pretend it was, indeed, her.
-   _World of Warcraft_ has several questlines that include the player doing this, and a few times when NPCs do this to the player. One questline involves the player dealing with a delusional knight who believes he is helping "maidens" and fighting "monsters". He is actually fighting low-level dinosaurs, and not being terribly helpful to the people he comes across, none of whom really qualify as "maidens".
-   _Fate/Grand Order_: In one of Caster Cu Chulainn's battle quotes (after his animation update), he starts to say "witness the truth of the runes Scathatch taught me... sure, let's go with that." It turns out to be Foreshadowing, combined with Scathatch noticing that he's indeed using different tricks from what he taught him; he picked up his tricks from Odin, for whom he serves as an Emissary from the Divine.
-   In _Final Fantasy X_, Tidus is pulled from his home of Zanarkand to Spira by the monster Sin. When he talks about the Zanarkand he knows, the native people considered him crazy. To thim, Zanarkand is an ancient ruin, not the sprawling metropolis described to them. When Tidus mentions having been near Sin, Wakka believes that's why he's ignorant of Spira and talking nonsense; Sin produces a toxin that badly disorients people until it wears off. It becomes Tidus' go-to excuse for when he reveals how ignorant of the world he is to hide his true nature.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _CLANNAD_, Tomoya's modus operandi as a trickster mostly consists of simply not correcting the misunderstandings of others, but going along with their incorrect suspicions, ("Yeah, this is _exactly_ what it looks like!"), and watching as Hilarity Ensues.
-   Oryou Sonozaki acts this way regarding the family reputation in _Higurashi: When They Cry_. Although the Sonozakis are yakuza, they haven't done any of the stuff people- including their heirs- think they have. They just take advantage of the gossip to look tough. It's a very nasty deconstruction as this is indirectly responsible for many of the cycles of death and madness.
-   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All_, Case 4, this is what happens if Phoenix presents the profile of "John Doe" to his client. He knowingly plays along with Phoenix's misinformation about Doe's identity - i.e. that he's merely a butler.
-   In the third case of _Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney_, Trucy notices an odd coincidence where the crime seems to match up to the lyrics of Klavier's new song, "The Guitar Serenade," and proposes that the killer is intentionally mimicking said lyrics. Shortly afterwards, the body is moved to a raised platform along with a guitar, which matches the last part of the song and further supports Trucy's theory. Unbeknownst to everyone, Trucy first brought this theory up in front of the real killer, who hadn't planned the crime that way at all, but was happy to go along with it because it covered up the true sequence of events and gave him an airtight alibi.
-   Used in _Fate/stay night_, when Issei comes over, and wonders why Saber is there.
-   In _Doki Doki Literature Club!_, Yuri comments that she has awful backaches, and starts to explain why. Before she can say it, she trails off, but her embarrassed expression indicates that she was probably about to say it's because of her large bust size. After an awkward pause, the main character says it's probably because she has poor posture, to which Yuri hastily agrees. (Amusingly, it's unclear whether the main character is genuinely clueless, or just letting Yuri off the hook with an alternate, less embarrassing explanation.)
-   _Ikemen Sengoku_:
    -   The main character says this trope name word-for-word in Hideyoshi's route when she absentmindedly pats a sleepy Hideyoshi's head and he bemusedly asks her if she's copying his head-patting habit with her.
    -   When Mitsuhide starts spending every waking moment of his time with the female main character in his route, people start assuming that they've become a couple. The main character is dismayed by this misconception, but Mitsuhide goes along with it because it'll divert others away from the real reason they've begun spending all their time together: namely, that the main character overheard Mitsuhide talking about betraying his lord Nobunaga and he's making sure she doesn't get a chance to tell anyone about it.
-   _C14 Dating_: This trope gets played around with when it comes to dealing with an accidental Forced Out of the Closet moment. In-game context and the wording used make it so that it's technically possible to understand the statement accidentally outing a third party as something else entirely. From an audience perspective, Melissa makes it sound like she misunderstood, which allows the person who let the information slip to pretend that the misunderstood information was what they meant and get out of the conversation gracefully. Once this happens, Melissa turns out to have actually understood the information correctly and to have pretended otherwise for the other person's sake. This causes the trope to have a subversion that doubles as a reveal that it was invoked.

    Web Animation 

-   Chargesdotcomdotbr had a story arc titled "My Girl", where a young man was dating a woman who was MtF transgender. The young man's mother, who used to be friends with her when she identified as male, told the now her to end the relationship. When she learned she's now wealthy, she decided to ask for a DNA test. The young man didn't understand. When a friend of his came up with a crazy theory regarding aliens, his other friends decided to invoke the trope.
-   In _Hunter: The Parenting_, Big D's response to Kitten assuming he got hopped up on DMT prior to a hunt in case a vampire tried draining him is
    
    ''THAT IS DEFINITELY WHY I DID THAT!!'
    
-   During the _Black Templars_ podcast episode of _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, High Marshal Helbrecht eventually seems to figure out that the Centurion is in fact a disguised Rogal Dorn, his chapter's long-lost primarch and someone the entire chapter would be utterly desperate to have back. He very pointedly does _not_ call Dorn out on this, reasoning that Dorn must be keeping himself hidden for a reason.
    
    **Helbrecht:** Thank you, friendly centurion. I would ask you your name, but.... I assume it is not yet time.
    
-   This exchange from _Halo vs. Counter-Strike_:
    
    **Master Chief:** Well, since this is your last life and all, I guess I won't be seeing you around.  
    **Counter-terrorist:** Hey! M-my gun's pointed at you too!  
    **Master Chief:** Yeah... But I have an overshield.  
    **Counter-terrorist:** Oh yeah? Well... uh... This gun has armor piercing rounds in it!  
    **Master Chief:** Really?  
    **Counter-terrorist:** Yeah... yeah... Let's go with that.
    
-   In _RWBY_, Yang, Jaune and Ren are stuck in an outpost outside Atlas and, as Yang is trying to fix up a hovercraft, asks Jaune if 'she' would be upset with her if she saw her as she was now. Jaune, thinking that Yang is referring to Ruby and their recent spat, reassures her that Ruby would still love and care for her no matter what. However, Yang replies with a "Yeah... _Ruby_..." in a tone that suggests that she's not referring to Ruby, but someone else, most likely _Blake_. Jaune does get the tone and backs down.

    Webcomics 

-   _Batman: Wayne Family Adventures_: Batman shows up to Justice League HQ with his leg in a cast, which leads to the other superheroes speculating on how he was injured. By the time Superman and Wonder Woman ask Batman directly, they've heard that the Joker hired Riddler and Bane to feed him to Killer Croc. Batman responds by afirming the rumor rather than admit the embarrassing truth that he accidentally fell down some stairs at home.
-   _El Goonish Shive_:
    -   George is hostile to Justin's friend Elliot right off the bat and doesn't let up on getting the truth from Justin about the recent magical goings-on (which involved Elliot)...until he finds out that Elliot is _not_, in fact, Justin's boyfriend. Suddenly he's a lot less belligerent, and perfectly willing to admit that Justin has a point and the issue is kind of complex. Contextual clues suggest there may be a different reason for this than the one he ends up admitting to:
        
        **Justin:** Did my having a boyfriend just make you so uncomfortable that you got extra defensive about everything?  
        **George:** ...Yes. I have learned a valuable lesson about friendship and acceptance and will never do it again.
        
    -   Much later, when Greg comments that Elliot should cut his hair, Elliot asks if it's “because an anime protagonist might change their hair to symbolize their growth?”
        
        **Greg:** ...sure, let's go with that.
        
    -   While out on a date with Ellen, Nanase runs into a Stereotypical Nerd who happens to be one of the many boys she dated before realizing she was a lesbian.
        
        **Gary:** Oh, I'm terribly sorry! I didn't mean to be rude, it's just I used to think you didn't want to go on a second date with me because I was too geeky.  
        \[Beat Panel\]  
        **Nanase:** Yes. It was entirely because I am a lesbian.
        
    -   In the "So a Date at the Mall" arc, Diane states that Elliot couldn't possibly be the Cheerleadra because he was on the phone with Ellen while Cheerleadra was talking to the griffin. Ellen hastily agrees, not mentioning that it was actually Ashley using Elliot's phone.
    -   In the non-canon _EGS: NP_ story "Ellen Demo", the narration box explains that, like the TF Gun, Ellen's transformation beams don't actually enchant Grace, but automatically trigger her natural shapeshifting ability, which in turn gives her the ability to consciously take those forms later. Grace's reaction is "_Wait_. Am I a _Mega Man_?" and the narration box says "Sure, why not."
    -   In the canon _EGS: NP_ strip "Who is Ellen? Part 2", Ellen is running a pre-written RPG but invents a random cleric when the party unexpectedly needs healing during an early scene, explaining that he's a friend of the guy who hired them to find a chicken-napper. The group finds the presence of the cleric, when the crime only took place because a guard _just happened_ to be sick, to be highly suspicious, and Ellen immediately decides that this is a _much_ better idea than the villain being some rando who took advantage of a guard _actually_ just happening to be sick that day.
    -   When Hope knows Justin's name despite them never meeting before, she goes along with his suggestion that it's due to the recent mysterious event causing people to recognize strangers and not know why, rather than the truth that it's due to memories carried over from her prior incarnation, Pandora.
-   _Girl Genius_, in this example when Theo is telling the younger students a story about the Heterodyne Boys he made up on the spot. Also a meta-Ascended Fanon.
-   _The Order of the Stick_ does it here, after what was supposed to be a Badass Boast:
    
    **Vaarsuvius:** Oh, forget it. It would take longer to make you understand than it would to research the next spell.  
    **Elan:** Wait — are you saying that you're going to research the spell "Haste" if I don't distract you anymore?  
    **Vaarsuvius:** Yes, that is it exactly. You have perfectly gleaned my true intentions, well done. Have a cookie.
    
    -   An earlier one:
        
        **Roy:** Too bad you froze Elan by accident.  
        **Vaarsuvius:** Accident...yes. Of course. By accident.
        
    -   Here, Redcloak is told he can become Supreme Leader of the hobgoblins through Klingon Promotion. He immediately kills the hobgoblin he's talking to, under the assumption that was the Supreme Leader.
        
        **Xykon:** Hey, you over there. That guy WAS your Supreme Leader, right?  
        _(Hobgoblin is wearing the Headdress of Supreme Leadership, the Shiny Gold Amulet of Supreme Leadership, and holding the Scepter of Supreme Leadership)_  
        **Hobgoblin:** Yes. Yes he was.
        
-   _Least I Could Do: Beginnings_.

    **Mr. Summers:** For a school project?  
    **Kid Rayne:** Okay.
    
-   In _Ménage à 3_ Gary thinks he lost his blanket while sleepwalking. Zii, not ready to tell Gary what really happened goes for the "Sure, Why Not?" line.
-   Dr. Schlock tries to use this trope in this _Sluggy Freelance_ strip. It doesn't work.
-   Done frantically by Hannelore of _Questionable Content_ here, when Sven reveals that his cat has been barfing due to a bug.
    
    **Faye:** Wow, he landed right in the laundry hamper. Nice aim.  
    **Hannelore:** Aim. Right.
    
-   In 2015 in _Kevin & Kell_, Harold flies into Carnivore Summer Camp to rescue Jess after she was captured by another predator camper's drone. When he arrives, he thinks they were alerted by his flapping, when it reality it was his natural foul odor since he's a herbivorous bird.
    
    **Harold:** Was it the flapping of my wings that alerted you to my presence?  
    **Harcourt:** Let's go with that, sure.
    
    -   Another instance in 2017, when Coney and Tree are talking:
        
        **Tree:** I'll be sort of a living baby monitor.  
        **Coney:** Wow, that'll be a whole new role for you, won't it?  
        **Tree:** Sure. Let's go with that.

    **Joel:** No, it's... yeah, sure, thats what happens.
    
-   In one of Paul Gadizkowski's _King Arthur in Time and Space_ comics that preceded _Arthur, King of Time and Space_, Pelleas tells Gawaine that he now understands the point Gawaine was making when he offered to seduce the Lady Ettarde "on Pelleas's behalf"; that a woman who could be won that way wasn't worth having. Gawaine says nothing in response to this, then says to Nimue "Well, if the lad wants to believe I'm that clever, why should I say him nay?"
-   _Forest Hill_ Kaleb overhears his mother Flora having sex with Colin, and thinks they were just bouncing on the bed, which she does not deny. Benni is not fooled, but does not say anything until later when Kaleb isn't around, and this is a good thing, because he thought that Colin and Flora were having sex with Colin's daughter, Tanya.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: Lalli's attitude towards Emil coming to the conclusion that their Sharing a Body situation is a Sanity Slippage induced case of Hearing Voices. Considering that Lalli himself seems to be bemused by the situation and Emil has been believing in magic for less than twenty-four hours at that point, it's probably for the best.
-   In _Sleepless Domain_, shortly after Undine's experienced the tragic loss of her Magical Girl team, she meets Heartful Punch, who hasn't heard and responds to Undine's shock to that fact by asking if they broke up. Undine goes with that, adding that she'd rather not talk about it. Heartful Punch doesn't press and invites Undine to go monster hunting with her. Undine, grateful that, for once, someone isn't walking on eggshells around her, accepts.

-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   Whenever Future Trunks has to deal with Goku, his default response is to just roll with whatever he says instead of bothering to correct him.

-   In _The Thrilling Adventure Hour_ episode "Basil's Day", a father bring his daughter to Frank and Sadie Doyle to cure her of demonic possession. The first thing the Doyles do after realizing the problem is take the child to their bedroom and tie her to their bed so she can not harm herself or others.
    
    **Basil:** Ropes on the bed? Do you do a lot of exorcisms?  
    _(Beat)_  
    **Sadie:** Uh...  
    **Frank:** Sure...
    
-   In _The Lizzie Bennet Diaries_, Bing first sees a camera in Lizzie's room as she and Jane are shooting a recorded letter for Charlotte. When he walks on her recording for the vlog later, he assumes it's another recorded letter, and she plays along.
-   In The Nostalgia Critic's review of _Supergirl (1984)_, he points out that several scenes would be very suggestive out of context (and sometimes even _in_ context), causing him to believe the screenwriter accidentally submitted the script of a porno and the producers took it at face value, and the writer went with it for the sake of his job. This becomes a Running Joke throughout the review.
    
    **Producer:** It says here two men fondle her skirt and then she blows them. \[Beat\] With her super breath?  
    **Writer:** Yes! Yes, that's exactly what I mean!

    **Ford:** _\[beat\]_ Okay.
    
-   In David F. Sandberg's video "The Problem Solving of Filmmaking", he describes how the majority of making a movie is just solving problems that pop up during filming. He gives a specific example from his film _SHAZAM! (2019)_, that Darla is slower putting on her shoes than the rest of the foster family purely because of real-life reasons, not in-story reasons.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  He notes that this realization throws a wrench in film analysis, that without real behind-the-scenes knowledge, it's impossible to tell the difference between an the filmmaker's intentional plan and real life writing the plot:
    
    **Generic video essayist:** In _Shazam!_, Darla has a clearly defined arc. Early on, we see her being the slowest of the foster kids, which is of course the setup to the payoff of her getting super-speed powers later on.  
    **David Sandberg:** _\[beat\]_ Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. _Yes._
    

    Real Life 

-   This is a good tactic to use when you're running a _Dungeons & Dragons_ game: if the players figure out something and they're wrong, but it wouldn't do any harm to change things so that they're right, just go with it: it's no extra work for you and makes your players feel clever for "working it out". In his _Pyramid_ column, Kenneth Hite once described an _Unknown Armies_ campaign in which he completely rewrote the villainous conspiracy, because the one the players _thought_ they'd discovered was better.
-   Chuck Palahniuk tells the story of a time he was on a plane and the flight attendant said he'd figured out that _Fight Club_ was really about a group of guys watching two men have sex in a bath house. Pahlaniuk said his response was "Yeah, sure, why not?" Guy gave him free drinks for the rest of the flight.
-   This tends to crop up on the Not Always Right blog when the stupidity of the various customers has gotten the employee in question so bewildered/annoyed/Mind Screwed that they just want to get the person out of the shop as quickly as possible.
-   This is a tactic emergency personnel and police are increasingly being encouraged to use when dealing with people having delusions due to mental illness/other issues affecting their perception of reality to get them to cooperate if you have to bring them in for their own/other's safety. A classic one is if someone believes they are being hunted by the Milkman Conspiracy to offer to bring them to a "safe" place where they won't be harmed, usually the hospital, and to provide someone, usually a police officer, to "guard" them at the hospital itself, which establishes a sense of trust. There are however limits to this, such as not saying you see something someone is hallucinating, and your own safety should never be compromised in the process.
-   Some old peoples' homes have started putting up fake bus stops so dementia patients can satisfy their need to "get away" or "go home" (even if they haven't lived in or even visited the place they're talking about for twenty years). Due to the deterioration of the brain that comes with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, nurses and other hospital workers find it difficult to reason with them, so they just direct them towards one of these fake bus stops so they can wait for a bus that will never come. Some wait for hours, then give up, saying they must have missed the bus and will try again later, though others will forget why they came here in the first place and let the nurse lead them back to their room. Almost of all them, however, report feeling more satisfied and generally happier, simply because they were able to go out and do something proactive, even if that something will be completely forgotten the next day. The creator of this fake bus stop program says that _"The sense that they have the freedom to do what they feel they need to do is very soothing to patients."_
    -   There's a nursing home in the Netherlands set up like a _small village_, complete with stores, restaurants, a movie theater, and a hair salon, for this exact purpose. The entire point is to provide a homey atmosphere that allows the patients to live a normal life while still receiving the care they need.
-   The naming of the racehorce Potoooooooo. From the article, "Pot-8-Os acquired the strange spelling of his nickname through a transliteration error, when a stable lad was asked to write the original name, "Potatoes", on a feed bin. The lad's version, Potoooooooo, was said to amuse his lordship so he kept it." This horse went on to be a champion and is an ancestor of most modern Thoroughbreds (which is why The Other Wiki has an article about the animal).
-   This, ultimately, was how East Germany ended up reacting to the government decree that the borders would be open. They had meant for refugees only (i.e. people leaving and never coming back), and referred mostly to the East/West Germany border. At the press conference, an ill prepared functionary failed to stress these points and was asked by a western journalist if the Berlin Wall was to be opened immediately. The press secretary, not being fully briefed, invoked this trope as a response. Cue thousands of people showing up at the checkpoints demanding to be let through. Cue the end of East Germany a short time later.
-   One comic from _The Far Side_ dubbed a stegosaur's tail spikes the Thagomizer, "after the late Thag Simmons". Paleontologists realized that the arrangement of spikes didn't actually have an official name, so they adopted the term.
-   This is essentially why we have Command Gold rather than Command Green in _Star Trek_. The actual color of the Command Branch (Kirk, Sulu, Chekov) tunics was intended to be a lime green (possibly along with the blue and red to evoke the three primary colors of the cathode-ray tube), but due to studio lights interacting with the velour fabric and the inconsistent color timing, it showed up instead as a bright gold. Later productions decided not to even fight the perception and retconned the color as to always having been gold.
-   When young Hiram Ulysses Grant applied to West Point, the congressman sponsoring him mistook his middle name for his first and mother's maiden name (Simpson) for his middle initial. Grant later tried to correct the error, but the name stuck when he realized it would require a new appointment at the academy.
-   This how the "NORAD Tracks Santa" program came about. In 1955, a Sears store in Colorado Springs ran an ad in the local paper, saying that kids could call a phone number on Christmas Eve to have Santa's position around the world relayed to them. But, due to a misprint, the kids ended up accidentally calling the watch center of the Continental Air Defense Command (NORAD's predecessor). The senior watch officer initially thought it was a prank, but as more kids kept calling in, he decided to just roll with it. Now it's annual tradition.

## "Maybe...We're Dumb?"

At his mother's funeral, BoJack talks about a fan of "Horsin Around" asking him if a coffee cup in one episode was a symbol for faulty memory. Rather than telling them it was a blooper, he went along with it. He ends up comparing closure with his mother and her last words to the coffee cup, wondering why people try to give insignificant things significance.
