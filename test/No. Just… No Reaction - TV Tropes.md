She's talking about kissing. Either that or Ako is vehemently opposed to family picnics.

_"No, no, no, no,_ no, no, NO, NO, _in an infinite expanse of_ NO_s from the Dimension of_ NO _with a statue dedicated to their great creator, the God of_ NO_, who wept tears of_ NO _that filled the oceans with_ NO _and brought about billions of creatures who were _**NO!**_"_

What a character says when something is wrong, stupid, or squicky enough.

The usage tends to be:

**Alice:** So the Big Bad sees a mouse and dies of a heart attack. The heroes spend the second hour of the movie talking about The Power of Friendship.  
**Bob:** Are you making this up?  
**Alice:** Wait, let me finish. And then this monkey princess Idol Singer and her 28 penguin back-up dancers show up.  
**Bob:** No. Just… no.

Or:

**Bob:** I've got it! The giant dogs could live in _our_ house for the week!  
**Alice:** No. Just… no.

Or:

A step beyond "That's just wrong," or "That's wrong on so many levels." The step beyond _this_ is a Visible Silence. The step beyond in the _other_ direction is the HA HA HA—No reaction.

See also Flat "What", Dude, Not Funny!, Sick and Wrong, And That's Terrible. It can be followed, preceded or coupled with a Rapid-Fire "No!" or a Blunt "No".

_Note: this trope is for In-Universe examples only. It is not to be potholed for anything tropers themselves find squicky or stupid._

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Durarara!!_, Erika wonders aloud if Shizuo and Izaya have some sort of hatesex thing going on and gets this from Kadota, Walker, Togusa, and Celty. _Shinra_, on the other hand…
    
    **Shinra:** You know, they _just might_—  
    **Celty:** _\[Shut up right now!\]_
    
    -   On a more serious note, "No. Just no," are Mikado's exact words in vol. 6 when he learns that some of the Dollars have decided to strike back at Chikage by taking two of his girlfriends hostage.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has Ako giving one of these when Yuuna reveals that she "wouldn't mind" giving a "deep, passionate kiss" to her father.
-   In _One Piece_, Franky and Robin clash from time to time in this fashion when Franky's Large Ham personality is too much even for her stoicism.
    -   A further example is both Whitebeard and Oden's reactions on being asked to guide Toki through Wano. Reactions mind you when they hadn't seen the other react to the question.
-   _Osomatsu-san_: When the other Sextuplets (minus the utterly shaken Choromatsu) learn of Nyaa Hashimoto's crush on their eldest brother, they storm her apartment with the following conversation:
    
    **Nyaa:** _\[shocked\]_ How can I help you?  
    **Karamatsu:** Let's get this straight. Regarding our eldest brother, one… two…  
    **Kara, Ichi, Jyushi and Totty:** _**Just don't!**_
    
    -   This uttering is indeed the episode's title.
-   _Phantom Quest Corp._: It's no secret that Ayaka drinks. But you know it's bad when she finds out Bosco's anemic, due to only feeding 4 times a year, and offers to let him have a sample of her blood — and he politely declines.
    
    **Bosco:** _\[averting gaze\]_ I'm, uh, afraid that won't do.  
    **Ayaka:** _\[offended\]_ And why not…?  
    **Bosco:** _\[clears throat and leans away\]_ Something to do with the, um \[ahem\] …alcohol content of your blood.
    
-   _Tomo-chan Is a Girl!_ has a non-verbal version. Tomo's friends Misuzu and Carol are helping her pick out a swimsuit in the hopes of making her Childhood Friend Jun see her as a woman, but Tomo's first choice is a completely unflattering and boyish one-piece. She says it should be alright and asks Carol to back her up; Carol's response is to drop her Perpetual Smile and give Tomo a blank stare of disdain, which is shocking enough to stun Misuzu and make Tomo immediately apologize.

    You can't do that to _five flavor soup_.  
    You just can't.  
    No… just no.
    
-   _Evangelion 303_: After a _**very**_ long night, Asuka and Shinji are quietly sipping coffee in a local shop when a thought occurs to her.
    
    **Asuka:** Let me get something straight, Shinji…  
    **Asuka:** You drove all the way from Cardenas to here last night… _without sleeping..?_  
    **Shinji:** Um, Yeah…  
    **Asuka:** And we're just going to clear out of here… _and head straight to dinner in BAKERSFIELD_??

After a while, they both come to the conclusion that they have it easier to pick new moves when they _need_ them, often in life-or-death situations.
    
    **Misty:** So, you're saying this would come easier if we were in a moment we'd really need it? I guess it makes sense, but not sure how much that helps me out.  
    **Ash:** We can probably think of something. Maybe Iris had some ideas…  
    **Misty:** No. As much as I really would prefer not running miles up hills, the only thing that harms is my shoe soles. Do you want her trying to get us to really want water to throw? She's liable to start setting things on _fire_!

-   _Another Hatchling_: While not voiced in exactly these words, this is Samus' reaction to the idea that Ridley might have been interested in mating with her:
    
    **Samus:** Let's _not_ finish that sentence so that I _never_ have those mental images, thank you very much, \[…\] ) "I'll well admit to being open-minded when it comes to interspecies relationships - Spike, Gandrayda, Rarity, and whoever else springs to mind - but leave Ridley _out_ of that equation, _especially_ when it comes to me!"
    
-   In _Bat Brats_, Blackfire has this reaction when Control Freak presents himself as "your hopeful groom":

-   In _Amazing Fantasy_, Peter has this reaction after using a Japanese public bath for the first time, immediately trying to change the subject rather than discuss it further.

    **Hermione:** What does he expect? That somehow I will deny my dracken instincts to stay with him? Give up my ability to have children for his philandering self? No. Just... no. Thanks for debilitating him for awhile.
    
-   In _My Brother's Best Friend (Is Not My Boyfriend, Jeez!)_ Harry comes out to the Weasleys after Mrs. Weasley tries to push Ginny and him together for the nth time.

    **Harry:** Ron, stop, please! No, just- no, Ron, I don't like you like that, okay! Ugh, what is it with you Weasleys and your horrible pairing choices!
    
-   In _Struggle and Strife_, Cloud Strife, reincarnated as Jaune Arc has just finished wiping out a _massive_ Grimm nest when Salem starts talking to him through one of her Seers. His response is a quick "Nope." as he bisects the creature.
-   _Universe Falls: The Series_: In episode 8, Wendy and Lapis learn the Tent of Telepathy has reopened and go to investigate, but almost immediately return and refuse to go back. This turns out to be because Robbie Valentino (Wendy's ex) and Jasper (Lapis's "ex") are both working at the new Tent of Telepathy.
-   In _Harry Potter and Defeating Dark Lords, Inc._ Moody advises Harry to be on the lookout for a future pureblood bride to protect himself from matchmaking attempts.
    
    **Moody:** Go for a walk. And don't ignore seventh years, either. Five years may seem a huge difference now, but when you are a hundred, it won't. Ignore first and second years unless you are already friends. Age of consent for a witch is twelve, and I don't want you in trouble.

    **Tracy:** But you must have at least found her attractive to date her.  
    **Neville:** And she doesn't cry about Cedric all the time anymore.  
    **Harry:** No just no. I couldn't. She wasn't interested in me, she just liked the fame she'd got as Cedric's girlfriend and I don't know whether she was dating me to fish for information on Cedric's death or she thought dating the boy-who-lived would be a good way to become even more popular. I don't think I could trust her not to demand a relationship or marriage.
    
-   _Harry Potter and the Duke's New Clothes_:
    
    **Draco:** Pletwicket sent \[Harry\] three sets of robes for court.  
    **Harry:** Well I sent the first set back. Purple velvet and feathers. No, just, no. The purple brocade and white fur is bad enough, I feel like a twit. But that's apparently the least I can get away with for formal regalia as a Duke at an official event.

-   _More Fragging Paperwork_: Optimus, trying to figure out the best way to start a condolence letter to Ratchet's family, tries out 'Dear Ratchet's womanbot' as an opening sentence. His thought on how that sounds is "No. Just... no," causing him to give up on Ratchet's letter for the time being.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue_ Ron suggests getting detention with Snape so Harry can talk to him.
    
    **Hermione:** I could probably work out a formula for next week's Lightening Liquid that makes an inert substance from the explosion.  
    **Ron:** Right on!  
    **Harry:** No, just... no. Snape still hates me, even if he liked my mom, and I'd rather not give him a _real_ reason to punish me - you've seen how he is when I'm trying to behave!
    
-   _Confusion Is Mine, Saith the Lord_:
    
    **Harry:** Listen to me. No one is having a dramatic meltdown, okay. And that includes not hurling accusations at each other and turning on each other. No. Just—no to all of that.
    
-   In _Inspected by No. 13_, Madame Olympe responds "No, just no" to a suggestion of full-contact tiddlywinks for the third task of the tournament, saying "We hosted one of those tournaments two years ago. Dozens died, and they're still scrubbing the blood off the ceiling of my dining hall".

-   On _The West Wing_, this is how Leo reacts to Bartlet's idea to bring in cloudcuckoolander Lord John Marbury as an expert adviser on the India/Pakistan conflict.
