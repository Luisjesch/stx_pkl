Michelangelo Buonarroti's sculpture depicting The Virgin Mary holding the body of the crucified Christ is the best-known example of one of the most popular poses in art. There is a whole class of artwork, referred to as "pietàs", that depict Mary (usually seated) holding the dead Jesus, going back to at least the early 14th century. It includes two other pieces by Michelangelo himself—one in the Cathedral Museum in Florence and known as the Deposition or Florentine Pietà, the other one in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan and known as the Rondanini Pieta, as well as a third work in the Academia in Florence not generally attributed to Michelangelo today.

This specific pose is often used either following a Heroic Sacrifice or on a comic book cover, in which case it will likely be accompanied by a Tonight, Someone Dies. It's frequently gender-flipped (i.e. the man holding a dead/dying/comatose woman).

May be mixed with Touch of the Monster. Sister Trope to Cradling Your Kill, Cradle of Loneliness, and Died in Your Arms Tonight. See also Background Halo and Sistine Steal for related subliminal symbolism. Compare Messianic Archetype, Madonna Archetype, "Last Supper" Steal and Crucified Hero Shot for other examples of frequently homaged Christ-iconography. See also Crisis Catch And Carry.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The cover art for Volume 13 of _Berserk_ has a bloody Guts, minus a hand and an eye, holding a naked and unconscious Casca like this, in what is presumably the aftermath of Casca being raped by Femto. In the actual manga, both Guts and Casca are too messed up to continue under their own power at the end of the Eclipse, and have to be carried out of the Nexus by the Skull Knight.
-   Tetsuya emerges from a burning building carrying Luna this way in _Casshern Sins_. Cue music, then the single-handed Curb Stomping of an entire robot army.
-   _Code Geass_:
    -   CC in the first OP. It's self-conscious, given that she seems to be in a church.
    -   Suzaku pulls this off absolutely straight with Euphemia...
    -   CLAMP have drawn an illustration of Suzaku holding Lelouch. As have the animators for offical art (Warning:MAJOR SPOILERS) Also overlaps with Cradling Your Kill.
    -   Another illustration has Lelouch carrying a passed-out Shirley this way.
-   The last we see of Hei in the final episode of _Darker than Black_ Ryuusei no Gemini was him carrying Yin this way. Yin's fate is left unknown.
-   _Death Note_:
    -   The first opening sequence features Naomi Misora<small>◊</small> cradling (apparently recently killed) fiance Ray Penber about halfway through as just one of countless biblical references.
    -   Also, Light Yagami holds L's dead body in this position, while grinning evilly after L dies in his arms.
-   _Dr. STONE_:
    -   When Senku and Taiju revive Yuzuriha, Taiju holds her in his arms in a similar pose. Unlike most versions of the trope, she's actually just woken up from being Taken for Granite, rather than dying.
    -   Later on it's played straight, with Taiju holding Senku in his arms just after Tsukasa broke his neck.
-   In _Eureka Seven_ episode 13, Renton carried the unconscious Eureka this way when Nirvash started to move on its own.
-   During the first opening of _Fate/Apocrypha_ we see Assassin of Red holding Shirou Kotomine in the pose while in a church. Subverted when the screen turns red, revealing Shirou on a throne with the Servants of Red surrounding him.
-   _Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children_ used this in promotional artworks, most notably for the front cover of the OST. It shows Cloud and Kadaj<small>◊</small>.
-   Several instances in _Fist of the North Star_:
    -   After the death of Shin, Kenshiro holds him in this position before placing him in his grave.
    -   There are two instances where both the carrier and the carry-ee both die: Toki and Ryuga and Kaioh and Hyo, the latter of which is accentuated by being encased in lava from an erupting volcano, effectively petrifying them in that pose forever.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Alphonse carries Ed into Winry's house this way.
    -   Armstrong holds a dead child like this.
    -   Also seen when Riza Hawkeye is dying from having her throat slit. Roy Mustang cradles her Pieta-style, urging her to stay with him, until May Chang performs the alkahestry ritual that saves her life. Once he realizes she's going to live, Mustang scoops her up again the same way, this time pressing his face into her hair.
-   _Gundam_:
-   In _Hunter × Hunter_, Meruem does this to Komugi after she is grievously injured by Zeno Zoldyck's Dragon Dive, with his Face Framed in Shadow to keep his reaction ambiguous. The roles are reversed when Meruem finally succumbs to radiation poisoning.
-   In _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind_, Giorno holds an injured Mista that way at the end of the White Album arc. Unlike other examples, the one who dies is their enemy, Ghiaccio.
-   Used in _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_ manga, with Hylia holding the just-died Link.
-   Used on the spoileriffic Vol. 6 cover of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ Japanese DVD, which has Subaru cradling the seemingly dead body of her older sister Ginga.
-   The _Mazinger_ series:
    -   _Mazinger Z_: Several times in the manga and in the anime series Kouji held Sayaka -or vice versa- in that position, usually when one of them lay unconscious on the ground. Actually the cover of one of the volumes features a grim-looking Kouji holding a fainted Sayaka<small>◊</small>.
    -   _UFO Robo Grendizer_: It happened near from the end, when Rubina got murdered and Duke held her as she died.
-   One chapter of _Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro_ ends with X holding Yako like this. An image of the sculpture is behind them, except Mary and Jesus are wearing bondage masks.
-   In _Naruto_, while Neji dies in the arms of the title character, a short while later his best friend and rival Lee is seen cradling his corpse while crying for his death.
-   In _One Piece_, Usopp holds Sanji like this when he thinks he's dead. Turned out he was just checking the wrong side of his chest for a heartbeat.
-   Quite unsurprisingly given the title, the Girls' Love manga _Pieta_ uses this pose at a climactic moment, with one of the protagonists holding the other after the latter's suicide attempt.
-   _Pokémon Adventures_:
    -   Red holds an unconscious Yellow in this fashion, and to drive the point home, they're both frozen in stone in this position for presumably some time.
    -   Wallace briefly holds Steven's dead body in this manner.
-   _Ranma ½_ several times, but at least twice in a definite parallel: first, a chapter-cover illustration with Ryoga thus cradling an unconscious Akane during an ice-skating battle; second, at the end of the series when Ranma thinks Akane has died.
-   _Sailor Moon R_ does this near the end, when Prince Demande carries his brother Saphir's lifeless body away of the battlefield, after he's killed by Wiseman. This is repeated in the S season, after Super Sailor Moon rescues Sailor Saturn from her last fight with Pharaoh 90 and takes her back to Earth, now as a newborn baby, in her arms.
-   _Saint Seiya_:
    -   When Seiya saves Saori from crows and then catches her before landing<small>◊</small>
    -   In the anime, this is also pulled by Hyoga, who carries Shun in his arms after the other almost sacrifices himself for him, holding Hyoga in his own arms and then burning his Cosmo to its limits to _literally_ de-freeze him.
-   The second opening of _Soul Eater_ shows Soul holding Maka in this fashion, like this<small>◊</small>. Never happens in the series, though.
-   Daram holds his girlfriend Harulu like this After the End of _Space Runaway Ideon_. It is especially poignant since _both_ characters are dead at that time and appear as spirits. Don't ask.
-   _Space Warrior Baldios_: At the end of the movie, that is how Marin holds Aphrodia as he treads around a desolate beach After the End.
-   At the near-end of the series of _Tokyo Mew Mew_, used twice with Tart and Pudding and Kish and Ichigo. The former being the dead one in both cases.
-   A slightly more frightening example appears in _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_ in the arc that delves into Kurogane's past. During this part, the character, in a bloody, senseless rage, ends up being shown, his entire face, except for his eyes, totally shadowed, holding his mother's bloody corpse. This goes on for quite some time, with the only other feature being shown being the occasional appearance of his mouth, usually open in a shout or growl. Then finally, the character Tsukiyomi stops him and, in an attempt to calm him, closes his dead mother's eyes, telling him that she should rest. During this whole time, he never once dropped his mother's body.
-   The DVD cover for _Anime Legends: Wolf's Rain Complete Collection II_ depicts (among other things) Kiba holding Cheza in his arms. Which should be _impossible_, because (in case there's anyone who isn't aware of the show's basic concept) Kiba is actually a wolf and is only projecting the illusion of being human - he doesn't really _have_ arms, and couldn't possibly hold this pose in wolf form - it would look pretty silly too.
    -   Turns out this _is_ an actual scene from the show. Presumably he's actually carrying her on his back.
    -   In addition, it isn't as though weight would be an issue, seeing as how Cheza is literally a flower. Within the context of the show, it seems significant that she's the only one able to be carried like that by the wolves.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Yami pulls this with Yugi after defeating the latter in a duel, the price of which was at least one of their souls, in the episode "Self Destruction (Showdown! The Two Yugis)".
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_, Yusei carries Ruka this way after her traumatic and exhausting duel with Professor Frank. (Fortunately, she lives.)
-   _YuYu Hakusho_:
    -   After Toguro kills Genkai, Yusuku holds her in his arms, telling her not to die.
    -   Itsuki holds his lover and leader Sensui's body after he dies.

    Arts 

-   The _Pietà_ was already a long-established representation of the sorrowful Virgin Mary by the time Michelangelo started work on his first one. It first arose in Germany, where the form is known as _Vesperbild_ ("vespers image", because it portrays a moment after the crucifixion, around the time of evening prayers on Good Friday), and spread to Italy from there. The oldest surviving Pietàs date back to the early 1300s, over 150 years before Michelangelo was born.
-   Some ancient sculptures and paintings depicting scenes from pre-Christian mythology also have Pietà-like configuration, e. g. Niobe holding the body of one of her children, Eos (Dawn) with that of her son Memnon etc.
-   The painting depicting Ivan the Terrible holding his son after mortally wounding him has him cradling him in this pose.
-   While it lacks the Mary figure, David's _Death of Marat_ has the subject mimicking Jesus' pose. Interestingly, that portrait supposedly was taken from life, er death.
-   An even closer version is this image of the death of Joseph Smith<small>◊</small>, founder of the Mormon Church, from 1851.

    Comic Books 

-   In _All Fall Down_, the Ghoul holds Portia this way after rescuing her.
-   The Avengers: Red Zone Part 5 cover<small>◊</small> features this with Iron Man holding a very dead Captain America. Note that Tony's angst is so great that even the armor is emoting.
-   In a Silver Age Batman comic "Robin Dies at Dawn", the Dark Knight cradles the body of Dick Grayson as Robin on the cover after the latter is killed distracting a monster. He's having a nightmare.
-   Two-Face holds a drugged and bleeding Batman like this in _Batman: Jekyll and Hyde_.
-   _Captain Atom_ probably deserves mention for doing it twice, first on the cover of #8, with Plastique cradling a badly wounded Cap, with bonus points for Cap having a very visible wound in his side, and then inverting that image on the cover of issue #44, with Cap now cradling an unconscious Plastique. (Both are a more direct homage to the Pieta than most comics versions, including the seated posture and the draped legs.)
-   The finale to _Civil War II_ ends with Miles Morales holding a defeated Tony Stark. This stands out as being one of the most blatant copies so far, with the characters in nearly 1-1 positioning as the original sculpture, including hand placement, etc., to the point that it verges on self-parody.
-   In _Daredevil_ #164, Daredevil holds his father in this pose<small>◊</small>.
-   _Dark Reign_ had a promo poster depicting Thor in Lady Loki's arms.
-   _DC Comics Bombshells_: Kate Kane (later to become Batwoman) holding the young Jasón Todd after his death in the Spanish Civil War.
-   _A Death in the Family_, with Batman holding Jason Todd as Robin's body. This picture comes from the in-story moment where it happens.<small>◊</small>
-   _The Death of Captain America_ plotline has Steve Rogers taking a bullet and collapsing outside the court, only for him to be cradled by Sharon Carter and a federal agent. **(spoilers)<small>◊</small>**.
-   The cover of _The Death of Captain Marvel_ is very explicitly based on the Michelangelo work, as the comparison on the main trope page shows.
-   For the Marvel reprints of _ElfQuest_, a new series of covers was made. Issue 24<small>◊</small> also used this pose for Clearbrook and One-Eye.
-   The cover to the fifth issue of _GoBots_ depicts Leader-1 looking upward in despair while holding Cy-Kill's body in his arms.
-   In _Gotham City Garage_, Batman carries a hurt Batgirl in his arms after Barbara's been knocked down.
-   In the cover of _Green Arrow_ Vol. 6 #36, Black Canary is depicted effortlessly carrying a wounded Green Arrow out of the sea in this way.
-   A cover done for a _Guardians of the Galaxy_ storyline that never actually came to be.
-   Issue 217 of _Hellblazer_ literally copied the statue.
-   In the cover for _House of M_ issue 4, Wanda is holding Pietro in a manner similar to the pose.
-   Towards the end of _Life With Archie: The Married Life_, after Archie's Heroic Sacrifice for gay friend Kevin Keller, both Jughead and Kevin hold Archie's lifeless body in this way while the former cradles it in his lap as the entire crowd weeps and holds each other close.
-   Marjane in _Persepolis_ recounts how she got into the Iranian art school; in the entrance exam, she drew a copy of Pietà, with Mary replaced by a veiled Iranian woman, and Jesus replaced by a martyr.
-   It's a fictional comic book, but the cover of issue 1<small>◊</small> of _Rage: Gay Crusader_ from Queer as Folk (US).

-   One of the earliest _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ comics had Data cradling Geordi's dead body this way.
-   _Suicide Squad_: In issue 19 of the 2019 book, Black Mask shoots Deadshot in the head, killing him. As he falls out of a window, the Aerie flies up, catches him, and lowers his body onto the ground in the Pietà pose.
-   _Superman_:
    -   The cover of _Crisis on Infinite Earths_ #7, showing Superman carrying _Supergirl_'s dead body, is one of the best known examples in comic books, and is frequently referenced and/or parodied itself and has generated a deluge of merchandising, effectively making the origin of the trope Older Than They Think for anyone who isn't aware that this cover itself is copying an older work, though it differentiates itself by Supes standing, tears streaming and crying out in grief.
    -   The cover art for the 1998 collected edition<small>◊</small>, by George Pérez (who drew the original series) and Alex Ross (of _Kingdom Come_ fame), mirrors the pose with Kal-L, the Earth-2 (and Golden Age) Superman, holding the body of his world's Wonder Woman alongside Earth-1 Superman and Supergirl.
    -   In an alternate universe shown in the _Fringe_ their positions were swapped: link<small>◊</small>.
    -   Superman did this to Supergirl<small>◊</small> long before the Crisis in _War World_. A reviewer made the next quip: "Again with the anticipation. Superman cradling a Supergirl literally at death’s door. All they need now is copious amounts of blood and a sweatband."
    -   Kal-L does it again in _Infinite Crisis_ with Lois Lane's body.
    -   The final page of _Final Crisis_ #6 has Supes doing it again, this time with Batman's corpse. At this point it seems to be mandatory for _Crisis_ comics.

    -   In _Red Daughter of Krypton_, villain Worldkiller-1 holds a dying Supergirl in his arms before dumping her in the Sun (a move which was fortunate for her and incredibly dumb of him).
    -   In _Justice_ #12, Kara does this to Poison Ivy after knocking her out with a blast of heat vision.
    -   And a drawing<small>◊</small> by Arthur Suydam of _DC Zombies_ has it too, with everyone but Supergirl a zombie, and her with an apple in her mouth.
    -   _Many Happy Returns_ provides two examples: Kara is holding Linda in the cover of the second-to-last issue; and at the end of the story, Linda holds a semi-unconscious Kara in her arms.
    -   In _Supergirl (Rebirth)_ #3, Cyborg Alura holds Kara's foster mother in her arms.
    -   In _Supergirl (1972)_ #2, Linda carries her ill college professor in her arms when she flies to the Fortress of Solitude after he passes out.
    -   In _Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures in the 8th Grade_, Supergirl carries her friend Lena in her arms when she gets gravely injured.
    -   The seventh issue of _Infinite Crisis_ inverts the iconic "Superman carrying Supergirl'' image when Power Girl -Earth-2's Supergirl- holds her cousin's body while Earth-2 Superman dies.
    -   In the cover of _Supergirl (2011)_ #20, Power Girl is holding the body of a dying Kara.
    -   _Last Daughter of Krypton_: It happens twice in the same issue. Simon Tycho's mercenary Jacobs carries Supergirl in his arms as getting her out of Tycho's cell and away from a chunk of Kryptonite. Shortly later, Kara is holding him in her arms after his morals have gotten him shot by his boss.
    -   In _Final Crisis_ #7, Overman, the Nazi Superman of Earth-X, is shown cradling the body of Overgirl<small>◊</small>, looking closer to the Pieta itself than to _Crisis on Infinite Earths_. _The Multiversity: Mastermen_ reprises the scene with the _Crisis_ pose.
    -   _Superman/Supergirl: Maelstrom_: When Superman collapses after getting hit by a poisoned dart, Supergirl catches him and supports his head on her lap.
    -   _The Death of Lightning Lad_: Saturn Girl cradles Lightning Lad's body as he is dying after being hit by the Zaryan's ship's freezing ray.

-   A variant occurs in _Tales of the Jedi_ with Ulic cradling the _robes_ of Arca Jeth, who was a Jedi Master and became one with the Force upon death. It's also shown on the cover of that issue.
-   One of the most _notorious_ examples is from the cover of one of the _Teen Titans_ "Drug Awareness issues", with Speedy holding an unnamed child.
-   The cover to the 22nd issue of _Tom Strong_ depicts Tom carrying the body of an alternate timeline counterpart to his daughter Tesla where his archenemy Paul Saveen is her father, directly riffing Superman carrying Supergirl's body on the cover to issue seven of _Crisis on Infinite Earths_.

-   _X-Men_

-   _Memories Born of Fire_: In Spock's nightmare, Christine Chapel holds him after he commits suicide.

    Films — Live-Action

-   In _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_, this happens to Clark's body after he sacrifices himself to stop Doomsday. Batman retrieves the body and solemnly passes it down to Wonder Woman and Lois Lane. Lois then cradles Clark's body in her lap while Bruce and Diana flank them.

-   Used intentionally in _Children of Men_, with a refugee mother holding her dead (or at least severely wounded) son. The commentary reveals this was a reference both to Michelangelo's sculpture and a real-life photograph.
-   _Cries and Whispers_: When a dying—actually, already dead, it's pretty weird—Agnes begs for comfort, Anna cradles her body in a classic Pieta pose.

-   Used blatantly, and intentionally, in the Argentinian film _Hombre Mirando al Sudeste_ (_Man Looking Southeast_), because one of its many, many possible interpretations is that the character Rantes is what he says he is, The Messiah (or rather, _a_ messiah).
-   _The Incredible Hulk_ carries Betty away from the battle on the college campus.
-   _Legends of the Fall_: You might expect that the poster of the film depicts Tristan holding his lover Susannah in a passionate embrace, but he's actually carrying the corpse of Isabel Two in this manner.

-   Subverted in _Riddick_. Riddick is wounded during a Back-to-Back Badasses fight with the scorpian-creatures. His companion (whom Riddick has predicted will cut and run on him) picks him up, apparently to carry him to safety...but then flips his body over to remove the power node from Riddick's back, leaving Riddick behind. He does return however for a Big Damn Gunship rescue, so he was apparently just being pragmatic.
-   In the 2002 American remake of _The Ring_, when Rachel finds Samara's corpse in the well, she cradles it like Madonna holds Jesus after the crucifixion.

-   In _Thor: The Dark World,_ Thor cradles dying Loki in his arms after the latter is stabbed by Kurse. Being The Trickster, Loki fakes his death. Played for Laughs in _Thor: Ragnarok,_ where Loki writes and commissions a stage play in which Asgardian actors reenact this scene from _The Dark World_ In-Universe.
-   Used in _Transformers: Dark of the Moon_ when Optimus holds Sentinel's body, which has been on the moon since The '60s and is locked in stasis due to lack of Energon.

    Literature 

-   _The Executioner_. On the cover of "Day of Mourning" in which Mack Bolan's long-term Love Interest April Rose is killed, Bolan is shown cradling the latter's dead body. And it's raining.
-   Used on the cover of R. L. Stine's _Fear Street: Super Chiller_ book _The Dead Lifeguard_.
-   Narrowly averted in _The Goblin Emperor_. When Beshelar throws himself in front of his emperor to protect him from a blade, he ends up wounded and bleeding in the emperor's lap. The wound is not lethal and before the emperor can start to cradle him or something, he gets up and apologizes.
-   In Justina Robson's _Living Next Door to the God of Love_, the Stuffies' Cathedral has a stained-glass window showing Francine with a "sexy dark chick" in her lap: it's Cadenza Fortitude, the titular God's female version.
-   _The Lord of the Rings_: When Faramir is wounded, the Prince of Dol Amroth brings him back to Minas Tirith holding him in his arms on the back of his horse.
-   The grown son in Robert Munsch's _Love You Forever_ cradles his ailing mother in this pose, similar to how she cradled him to sleep as a child and as a grown man.
-   In _The Tomorrow Series_ Corrie is seen this way in Kevin's lap after she has been shot. It is even lampshaded when Ellie says she walks into what looks like Jesus's barn.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _American Horror Story_ has this in _Coven_, with Cordelia holding Misty Day right before the latter crumbles into dust in her arms.
-   _The Bible (2013)_: Appropriately enough, when Jesus is brought down from the cross, it's staged like the classic depiction.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Used at least once, after Drusilla is restored to health and Spike is injured, she holds him in this manner. Also used in "The Puppet Show", when Buffy cradles the Demon Slaying puppet after his death.
    -   Also used when Tara dies, with Willow holding her.
-   _Chinese Paladin_: Used in the finale, with Xiaoyao Bridal Carrying Ling'er as she dies.
-   _Dark Angel_: In "Pollo Loco", Max holds her "brother" Ben in this manner after he asks her to kill him and she complies.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The scene in "Smith and Jones" where the Doctor carries Martha after she passes out from the lack of oxygen could be seen this way, especially since there was no particular reason she couldn't have stayed where she was besides drama.
    -   The Doctor holds the Master in this way in "Last of the Time Lords". Somewhat ruined by his odd squatting pose on the floor, although that was only as narmy as the odd position of his legs while dramatically floating.
    -   He did it again with Jenny in "The Doctor's Daughter", complete with that little hug-rocking motion. Once again, a secondary character shot the closest thing to family he had left out of almost nowhere; it was a bit of a callback. Given the way the Doctor tends to feel responsible when people die around him, this almost plays as Cradling Your Kill.
    -   Used again in "Asylum of the Daleks", with the Doctor carrying Amy. This has been all over the promotional advertisements for the season.
    -   A really striking one in The Teaser to "The Doctor Falls" with Cyber-Bill holding the Doctor's bloody body. The holder is standing in this instance, though.
    -   In ads for "Power of the Doctor", Yaz is shown standing with a dying Thirteen in her arms.
-   _Hercules: The Legendary Journeys_: Done a few times, usually whenever Iolaus dies. (Yes, it happened more than once.) In a commentary, Michael Hurst got his Michelangelo sculptures mixed up and compared it to _David_.
-   _Heroes_: Used this twice in season 3 in paintings of the future. One of Matt holding a burned Daphne in a possible-future where Sylar goes nuclear and Noah holding an injured Claire, foreshadowing the eclipse during which the powered people lose their abilities.
-   _House_: One episode had Cuddy holding a young patient who she'd been granted temporary guardianship of this way in a shower to cool her down due to a fever. Then House came in and sniped at Cuddy about her aspirations of motherhood...
-   _Kamen Rider Zi-O_: In episode 22, Tsukuyomi holds Geiz in this pose after he kills himself with a Time Burst against Another Ryuga. White Woz shouting "My savior!" drives it home double.
-   _Legion_: Near the end of "Chapter 22", Charles Xavier cradles his wife Gabrielle across his lap after she falls unconscious, and he sobs when he's unable to awaken her with his Psychic Powers.
-   _Merlin (2008)_: The last episode of the first season plays it straight with Uther holding Arthur. It's ok though, he gets better. Also in the season four trailer, Percival was seen carrying an unconscious Merlin in his arms.
-   _The O.C._: Used in, of all places, the first season, with Ryan and Marissa, who had just taken a painkiller overdose washed down with a lot of alcohol in Tijuana. And in a deliberate parallel to the same scene, he carries her the same way in the Season 3 finale, "The Graduates", following a car accident. She's suffered head trauma and he has to carry her away from the burning car. She dies in his arms, and the final shot is him huddled over her body.
-   _Power Rangers in Space_: Andros holds the body of Karone after Zordon's Heroic Sacrifice to stop the attack on the world. She is revived by Andros' love for her.
-   _Revolution_: In the first season finale, Miles Matheson is holding Nora Clayton in his arms in exactly this way when she died. He even went down onto his knees when he realized that she died.
-   _Seinfeld_: Jerry has a bad dream where he ends up in this pose after getting illegal cable and the Cable Police gun him down. Kramer cradles him crying "What have you done to my little _CABLE BOY???_"
-   _Smallville_:
    -   Clark Kent does it all the time, but most powerfully with Alicia's death. Lana back in _X-Ray_. Chloe in _Dichotic_, and the time in _Arrival_ may count. Also Chloe in _Abyss_.
    -   The Season 7 finale had Lex Luthor cradling (Weakened? Paralyzed? Don't really know.) Clark Kent in a similar fashion as the Fortress of Solitude crumbled around them. It's further enforced by the former repeatedly apologizing to him and apparently seeing this event of killing his former-best friend as a great personal sacrifice.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: Worf carrying Data during the episode "Brothers". Data was only deactivated at the time, though.
-   _Supergirl_: Supergirl holds Lena Luthor in the pose after catching her in season two.
-   _The Tick (2016)_: When Superman Substitute Superian is feeling unappreciated by humanity, he uses his eye beams to carve Devil's Tower into a sculpture of himself holding a limp human figure, in an effort to remind humans of all he's done for them.
-   _Upright Citizens Brigade_: Spoofed in one episode in the Camp Kalterman sketch.
-   _Veronica Mars_: Began and ended its second season with the Pietà; in the first case, Veronica tends to Logan, and in the second, it's reversed.
-   _The Walking Dead_: In the mid-season 5 finale Daryl carries Beth's body out of the hospital after she is shot.

    Music 

    Scripts 

-   In _Watchmen_, the alternate-universe Vietnam War Memorial is a statue of Dr. Manhattan cradling a dead soldier. The script even references the original by name.

    Tabletop Games 

-   A picture on the page explaining the rules for Resonance (that's the accumulation of the wrath of the undead creators of the world to you and me...) in the _Exalted_ 2nd ed Abyssals book. Something of an inversion, however — the character doing the cradling is presumably an Abyssal, and has probably just invited the anger of the Neverborn by attempting to do some good in the world — renegade Abyssals can quite easily hit Messianic status, Dark or otherwise.

    Theatre 

-   The very last pose in _Elisabeth_. See that show's trope page for an illustration.
-   This photo<small>◊</small> from a 1918 Metropolitan Opera production of Giuseppe Verdi's _La forza del destino_ shows Don Alvaro holding the dying Leonora in his arms.
-   William Shakespeare example: King Lear carrying Cordelia's body at the end of the play. Well, near the end.
-   The script of the play for _Little Shop of Horrors_ mentions Pieta a few times when discussing how to act Audrey's death and subsequent feeding to the plant.
-   In _Matilda_'s third B-story segment, the Escapologist carries the Acrobat pieta-style after her fatal fall during the "Burning Woman" stunt.
-   In _Les Misérables,_ the image of Marius cradling Eponine's body at the end of the song "A Little Fall of Rain" evokes this trope. Certain stagings also have Valjean carry Marius from the barricades this way, although Marius is still alive.
-   _Miss Saigon_: Kim holds her cousin Thuy this way after she shoots him (she was protecting her son from him), and is held this way by Chris after she shoots herself in the end.

    Video Games 

-   A pretty clever example occurs in _Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood_. In one particular story mission, you are tasked with preventing someone's assassination in the middle of a play, where said person is playing Jesus. Let's just say things take a turn for the bad, so they cut him off the cross, and Ezio picks him up and carries him off. Perfect Pieta pose included.
-   In _Batman: Arkham City_, done by Batman during the ending after The Joker dies from TITAN poisoning.
    -   Made somewhat hilarious by the fact that he seems to have left Talia lying in a pool of her own blood without a second thought.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   This also helps serve as Book Ends to the first image we see in the _Catwoman_ opening - Cain doing the exact same pose with Abel.
    -   In the "Season of Infamy" DLC in _Batman: Arkham Knight_: if you destroy the Lazarus machine, Batman will carry Ra's out in this manner as well. Unlike the Joker, Ra's isn't dead yet, but he will be soon enough.
-   In _Blasphemous_, the boss Ten Piedad is first seen resting in the arms of a feminine statue in this pose. When it wakes up, it desecrates the statue by ripping its head off and throwing it at you. The lore behind the boss states that it Was Once a Man who became the hideous beast it is now after sleeping in the statue's arms.
-   The cover<small>◊</small> art<small>◊</small> for _DoDonPachi Daioujou_ and _DoDonPachi Saidaioujou_.
-   In _Dragon Age II_ Hawke does this with his/her mother when he/she is too late to save their mother from an insane blood mage who sought to 'reassemble' his late wife.
    -   Later in Act 2, Viscount Dumar does this with his son Seamus after the latter is murdered by Petrice in her attempt to incite war with the Qunari.
-   In _Fable III_, The Hero does this as Walter dies in his/her arms after the final battle.
-   In _Far Cry: New Dawn_, Joseph Seed carries his bastard son Ethan like this after Ethan dies from injuries given to him by the Captain.
-   _Fate/Grand Order_:
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Kefka of _Final Fantasy VI_ mimics this as one of his final forms, with the "Rest" part of the Statue of the Gods replacing Christ.
        -   Notably, in the Japanese version, the female torso and head floating behind Kefka was named "Maria", as in "Mary", as opposed to the western translations in which she was named "Girl" or "Lady" depending on the console version. (Quite obviously to avoid pushing any berserk buttons, although Lady could very well be taken from Madonna <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , an appellation for the Virgin Mary.)
        -   Quite notably, in the Nintendo Switch and Patch 1.2 versions of _Cuphead_, during the third phase of Sally Stageplay's battle, the cardboard cutout of her husband (which you've squished via the Falling Chandelier of Doom earlier in her first phase) fights alongside her cardboard cutout, parodying the Pieta part by striking a pose similar to that of the "Rest" part of the Statue of the Gods in _Final Fantasy VI_. Take a look.
    -   Tellah of _Final Fantasy IV_ takes both sides of this trope in the DS remake, holding his daughter Anna as she's just been shot full of Baronian arrows, and then being picked up by Cid after sacrificing his own life to power his uber-doom Meteor spell against Golbez.
    -   After Aerith from _Final Fantasy VII_ is stabbed and killed by Sephiroth, Cloud cradles her body like this as he mourns her.
    -   An interesting variation from _Final Fantasy VIII_: Rinoa does this with Squall after she finds him unconscious in the desert after Time Compression, but it's mostly shown from the _back_ - most likely to highlight the wings on the back of her outfit.
        -   Also averted in _Final Fantasy VIII_. Squall carries the unconscious Rinoa piggyback style.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII-2_: Noel holds Serah in this manner after she succumbs to her seeress powers. Yeul is also seen being held by both Noel and Caius during her many _many_ death scenes in this way.
-   _God of War (PS4)_:
    -   Kratos carries Atreus in this matter after Atreus had fallen ill and was near death.
    -   There was Freya carrying their son Baldur after Kratos was forced to kill the latter.
-   In _Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series_, depending on your earlier choice, either Drax or Gamora will hold Peter like this after the latter was injured by Hala the Accuser.
-   In _Halo: Reach_, Carter carries Kat's body this way after she is Killed Mid-Sentence by an Elite sniper.
-   The King of Fighters:
    -   In _The King of Fighters '99_, Kensou carries an unconscious Athena after he activates the Dragon Spirit to save both of them. He does this again in _The King of Fighters 2000_, but with a badly injured Bao when he takes a blast of a Kill Sat.
    -   In _The King of Fighters 2003_, Kyo Kusanagi is seen holding an exhausted and wounded Chizuru Kagura like this after Ash Crimson attacks her and steals her Magic Mirror via _pulling it out of her body_.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Done twice in _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_. Link holds Colin in this manner after rescuing him from abduction by the Bulblins. Later, when Midna uses the power of the Fused Shadow for the first time and it renders her unconscious, she likewise is held in Link's arms until she wakes.
    -   In the second-to-last memory in _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, Link is badly injured while defending Zelda from a Guardian. While he's on the verge of death, Zelda cries over him while holding him this way before the voice inside the Master Sword tells her to take him to the Shrine of Resurrection, where Link wakes up at the beginning of the game.
-   Mega Man:
    -   _Mega Man X4_, during the infamous "WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOOOOOOOOOOR" scene, where Zero carries the dead Iris.
    -   In _Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X_, X is seen doing this to a dying Zero.
    -   Another one in _Mega Man X8_ , with X carrying a comatose Axl before and during their journey back to Earth.
    -   And again in _Mega Man Zero_, where Zero saves a falling Ciel this way.
-   Snake holding Big Mama in _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ is an interesting twist, because all the Faux Symbolism up until that point was that Snake was the self-sacrificial, messianic one and Mama was his mother (she even blatantly described Snake's birth as an 'immaculate conception').

-   The cover art of _NieR: Automata_ features 2B holding 9S in this manner. she also holds him in a similar manner after the boss fight in the copied city.
    -   After the second boss fight eve holds his brother Adam in this fashion.
-   In the fifth case of the first _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_ game, Lana Skye holds her unconscious younger sister Ema in this manner after Ema is attacked by a serial killer.
-   At the end of _Pitfall: The Lost Expedition_, Harry tries lifting Nicole's body in this manner in his attempt to revive her before setting her down and realizing that he has lost his magical powers the butterfly had given him... or so he thinks. In his Heroic BSoD, he lifts her up again in this manner, thinking he has failed her, before giving her the Magic Kiss of Life, bringing her back to life again.
-   In _Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones_, when the Prince in his Dark Prince form sees his father Sharaman dead after obtaining his sword, he crumples to the floor in his "My God, What Have I Done?" moment and holds his father in this manner, all the while the Dark Prince's voice taunts him on how to save Sharaman's life.
-   Despite being the furthest thing from a messiah imaginable, Alex Mercer in _\[PROTOTYPE\]_ cradles his sister Dana's unconscious body this way when he rescues her from a kidnapping, before he lifts her effortlessly and tears out of the building to find medical care.
-   The standing Pietà could be found on the Western box art<small>◊</small> of the origina; _Shadow Hearts_ with Yuri carrying Alice. _Shadow Hearts: From The New World_ mimics this<small>◊</small> with Johnny and Shania, except that Johnny is smaller than Shania, so in order to not look silly he kneels, and holds her with one hand. Sloppy modelling ruins the pose, as Shania's neck is straight up; she is clearly supporting it herself.
-   When _Shin Megami Tensei II_ was remade for the Playstation, its original poster featured the protagonist being held by the angel Gabriel in this position.<small>◊</small>
-   In _Spec Ops: The Line_, when you discover the damages done by phosphorus on the civilians, a dead woman is holding her dead burnt daughter, immobilized in a sitting position
-   Marisa's victory pose in _Street Fighter 6_ has her scoop up her fallen foe in this position.
-   _Super Mario Bros._: Someone made a Real Life statue of Peach holding Mario in that pose. From styrofoam. It's titled "Game Over".
-   In _Tales of the Abyss_, Luke does this for Asch in one of the last scenes of the game. Considering Luke is his clone, the symbolism can get a little weird.

    Visual Novels 

-   Happens twice in the fourth case of _The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures_. The first time, John Garrideb dramatically falls over, as his wife Joan catches him in this pose. After it's revealed that Joan was the one who (accidentally) assaulted Olive Green, she's the one to fall with John catching him; however, Joan is a lot heavier than John, and he collapses after holding the pose for a few seconds.
-   In _Umineko: When They Cry_'s PS3 remake, Battler is holding Beatrice like this on the cover.

    Web Animation 

-   Volume 2 of _RWBY_ had Ruby and Weiss in this position for the teaser trailer, as a pillar collapses behind them. Fans worried about what this meant, but as it turns out, Rooster Teeth were just hamming it up for the promo. The real reason is much sillier: a Food Fight.
    -   Done again in episode 19 of _RWBY Chibi_ after an pillow fight done to the same extreme but instead it is Yang holding Ruby who pretends to die.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Blue Yonder_, Jared is carried in like that after the injuries he suffered.
-   Pastiched by _Dasien_ and Mindmistress on this cover in _The Crossoverlord_.
-   _Daughter of the Lilies_: Used in the confrontation between Prof. Fike and Master Wu, as Fike clutches an illusion of his late son in the depths of the Drath hell.

    -   Played straight in \[S\] Cascade with PM and WV
-   Seen in _Juathuur_ here, with inverted genders.
-   Karate Bears need a mop.
-   _Katamari_ uses this at the end of one of the arcs, when Lucha brings a seriously injured Opeo back from the wrestling tournament.
-   _Kevin & Kell_, normally a very gag-based comic, had one here, following the death of Danielle.
-   In the foreground of this _Roommates_ page the Goblin Regent is holding the fallen (Death is already there for him) kid hero like this. Also his face and the thing in the background clearly shows that the guy reached the Godzilla Threshold.
-   In _Shortpacked!_, it's used for unconscious character_s_, considering how Death wasn't so cheap there.
-   _Star Mares_ has a shot of Dark Feather standing over a broken and defeated Skywalker which is reminiscent of the pose.
-   Rumble Bee of _Super Stupor_ strikes this pose with her mentor when he ceases to exist during the Cataclysm in this strip.
-   _Unsounded_: Though the shot is from behind, the end of this strip has Murkoph in a very Pieta-like pose as he holds the flayed skin of his torso. This is quite a juxtaposition, as Murkoph is a highly depraved and sacrilegious character.
-   In _Weak Hero_, after gaining his Heroic Second Wind and beating down Wolf, Gray succumbs to his injuries and collapses. Ben catches him before he falls, cradling him in the pietà position. Then he picks him up and carries him away in the same manner<small>◊</small> with the sun setting behind them.
-   _Weapon Brown_: ME GOYLE!!
-   Jethro, "the retarded kid" from _You Damn Kid!_ built one out of snow... before promptly clotheslining it.

-   _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_ has one heralding its finale in Act III: Billy carries the lifeless body of Penny to a stretcher as he sings "Everything You Ever" and makes his final transformation to Dr. Horrible.
-   Linkara does this with MarzGurl in _Kickassia_ when she's knocked down by an explosion. Played for Laughs, since the entire time he's doing it, she's protesting that she's fine.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: A scene from the second season finale is one example that doesn't follow a Heroic Sacrifice, but a poorly timed mistake.
-   _Ben 10: Alien Force_ actually has a shot like this in "What Little Girls Are Made Of", with Kevin holding Ben after he is knocked down in a (brief) conflict with a woman who turns out to be his grandmother. The scene is not dramatic and Ben isn't even unconsious, but he stays in Kevin's arms like that for a good five seconds.
-   _Bojack Horseman_ In Season 4, Episode 6, "Stupid Piece of Shit," we see Bojack holding Sarah Lynn in this pose during his "Stupid Piece of Shit" flashback.
-   Spoofed in the _Dexter's Laboratory_ accompanying short, _The Justice Friends_, in which Major Glory holds Valhallen in his arms after Valhallen injures himself in an attempt to get a bee out of their apartment. When Valhallen states that he is fine, Major Glory casually tosses him aside.
-   In the _Harley Quinn (2019)_ episode "The Runaway Bridesmaid", Poison Ivy and Kite Man's wedding is raided by the police. When Ivy passes out from knock-out gas, Kite Man carries her body and screams in anguish, parodying _Crisis on Infinite Earths #7_, until he too succumbs to the gas.
-   _Justice League Unlimited_:
    -   Superman does this to Captain Atom after Superman is forced to beat him unconscious in "Flashpoint".
    -   Batman does this with Ace in "Epilogue".
    -   Green Lantern does this to Supergirl in "Far from Home".

-   In the _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_ short "The Feelers", this pose is done by having Mo Skito carry Mitzi Moth in his arms during her Disney Death.
-   _Recess_: In the episode "Prince Randall", Mikey combines this trope with a Skyward Big "NO!" as he holds the unconscious T.J. after the latter is clobbered at the dodgeball wall.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "Worst Episode Ever", the famous "Death of Superman" comic is parodied with Sad Sack.
    -   In "The Sweetest Apu", Homer does this with a keg of beer<small>◊</small> after someone stabs a hole in it during the Civil War reenactment.
        
        **Homer:** This was supposed to be a mock battle! MOCK!
        
    -   "Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play" features the eponymous couple helping a major league baseball player and his wife patch up their troubled marriage.

-   _Transformers: Animated_, Endgame Part 2: Jazz carries Prowl's body after the third Lugnut Supreme blows up.
-   In the last chapter of season one, Bloom from _Winx Club_ carries a defeated and passed-out Icy after a rather intense battle between the two of them.
    -   This is matched by the Crucified Hero Shot Bloom got earlier in the season, when Icy and her sisters stole the Dragon's Flame from her. It's matched even further by the fact that said battle happened immediately after Bloom recovered her stolen magic.

    Other 

-   Anakin Skywalker and his dead mother Shmi appear in this pose in a _Star Wars Legends_ trading card, with her as a Force Ghost holding his charred, dying body after his defeat at Obi-Wan's hands-on Mustafar.
