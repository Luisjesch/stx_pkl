**Krieg's Inner Conscience:** I don't know the dead man. Probably didn't deserve what he got. Doesn't make him special, though. All kinds of people die out here. The innocent... and the not-so-innocent. If I'm lucky, he hasn't noticed me yet. I wanna warn him. I wanna tell him to run, to hide, to get out of sight so I won't have to kill him. That's... what I _wanna_ say. What actually comes out of my mouth is:  
**Krieg:** _\[sprints toward the man with buzz-axe raised\]_ I HAVE THE SHINIEST MEAT BICYCLE! _\[chop, Smash to Black, man screams\]_  
**Conscience:** _\[resigned\]_ Heh. Close enough.

Sometimes, when a character has a Split Personality, or two people Sharing a Body, one of them is a total wimp. This can range from merely being incompetent in a combat situation to being unable to take care of their own basic needs, such as feeding themselves and not wetting themselves in public. Regardless, when these come out in a combat situation, the character tends to be royally screwed. If they're on a team, this can transform them from a badass into The Load. When the Big Bad does this, they may become a Zero-Effort Boss or Clipped-Wing Angel.

Compare Good Is Impotent. Contrast Superpowered Evil Side, which sometimes goes hand in hand with this. Sometimes appears as a result of Easy Amnesia. In a world where Passion Is Evil, the Good side will be passive or emotionless.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Animerica_'s Big Bad Kiyone is revealed to be this, having been intelligent but physically weak compared to his older, stronger, and much favored twin, which made him vulnerable to his Superpowered Evil Side. He is so much so that he is put in a Driven to Suicide state, believing that he has no chance of redemption after all his actions in Season 2, and his now Enemy Without demon sees this as an opportunity to attempt to take him over again.
-   _Code Geass_
    -   Chigusa, the side of Villetta Nu that arises as a result of amnesia.
    -   _R2_: After the first showdown at the Sword of Akasha, the immortal C.C.'s personality reverts to that of herself at the age of ten. Complete with all the skills and confidence of a ten-year-old. Making matters worse, C.C. was born in the Dark Ages, so she's not just a child, she's a slave who doesn't understand the modern world and whose primary skills include cooking, sewing and the ability to count to twenty.
-   Lunch/Launch of _Dragon Ball_ spends half her time as a hyper-competent, incredibly violent criminal specializing in dramatic robberies. The other half of the time, she's a ditzy, gullible, physically weak woman who is so different from her counterpart that it's hilarious.
-   Lucy of _Elfen Lied_ is a psychotic murderer who can kill things with telekinetic "hands" called vectors that she can extend in a two meter radius around her. However, after taking a bullet to the head, she becomes Nyu, an innocent amnesiac girl who initially doesn't even know how to use a restroom. However, as time goes by, they start switching back and forth. This is strange, but becomes more reasonable when later it is revealed that she's actually got a THIRD personality already, the one that is a bugfuck insane genocidal monster. The genetic programming to assimilate or murder all of mankind that Lucy has been struggling with all her life.
-   One episode of the _Ranma ½_ anime features the Jusenkyo Preservation Society, which sends enforcers to punish Ranma and the others who "abuse" the Jusenkyo curse. One of them is a hulking man named Kinnii, who use a two-handed Chinese sword with devastating power. However, he's also a victim of the Spring of Drowned Buddhist Priest (Fūshannīchuan), so whenever he gets hit with cold water he transforms into a frail, tiny, pacifist monk who's Friend to All Living Things.
-   In the _Rockman Zero_ manga, Zero has this in the form of an energy conservation mode. It also takes away his helmet and weapons.
-   In _Sailor Moon S_, Hotaru is still present in the mind of Mistress 9 after she takes over her body. She fights against her constantly as she grows weaker and weaker. When her light finally peters out, Mistress 9 announces triumphantly to Usagi that Hotaru has died. Unfortunately for her she didn't take Sailor Saturn into account.
-   Mibu Kyoshiro of _Samurai Deeper Kyo_ initially appears to be this. Subverted, however, as he is later revealed to be a better swordsman than even Demon Eyes Kyo! He just doesn't like to fight.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_
    -   The spirit of the Ring uses Bakura as a part-time body parasite; Bakura generally has no clue what's going on. Bakura is friends with the heroes, while the spirit of the ring is trying to kill them.
    -   Yugi starts out kinda wimpy and needing the Pharaoh to protect him. As the series goes on, however, he takes a level in badass until the end, when he proves himself stronger than the Pharaoh.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!: Capsule Monsters_, while Alexander's good half is able to assist Yugi and his friends, when he merges with his evil half the evil side wins out, suppressing him completely until after the final battle.

    Comic Books 

-   A _Batman_ villain known as the Ventriloquist has this sort of ... problem. He seems like a decent-but-timid person, but he expresses his sociopathic side through a ventriloquists' dummy he carries called "Scarface." Scarface is dressed and acts like a miniature version of Al Capone, often giving the impression that he's actually holding his Ventriloquist hostage. If Scarface is destroyed, the Ventriloquist will usually surrender, often expressing relief that the dummy he was talking through and manipulating is gone. However, it's definitely his own problem and not the dummy being an Artifact of Doom or something (and there are times you'll _really_ start to wonder). He's been separated from the puppet a number of times, but always winds up with him again in the end. This is typical of Batman's Rogues Gallery — fixing Two-Face's appearance doesn't fix Two-Face for long<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , etc.
-   In _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_, Jekyll is a sickly and emaciated man who is dominated by the ogre-like Hyde. Hyde remarks that he used to be a dwarf while Jekyll was more formidable since he was the embodiment of Jekyll's bad traits, and Jekyll wasn't really that bad a person. But as Hyde himself explains to Nemo, "Without me, Jekyll has no drive...while without him, I have no restraints."
-   _Miracleman_ has Johnny Bates, the non-superpowered alter ego of the mass-murdering Kid Miracleman. Not only is Bates timid and horrified by the monstrous actions of his other persona, he's also still a child due to Kid Miracleman having remained in superpower form since the early 60s, forcing Bates' body to remain in stasis for most of it with his mind helplessly trapped in Kid Miracleman's. Miracleman is eventually forced to kill Bates to permanently stop Kid Miracleman after he destroys most of London and massacres the inhabitants.

    Fan Works 

-   Inverted in _Rapture Falls_, where Frank Fontaine's ADAM abuse results in a split personality. The new good side quickly proves he's no pushover despite not being the primary, and wrests control away from Fontaine when the latter tries to kill Jack; understandable, considering that the Atlas character who became the basis for the split led a rebellion against Andrew Ryan, so making him bad under pressure would've been counterproductive. Fontaine ends up the helpless _evil_ side, and it's later commented that Atlas is the better fighter of the two.
-   In _The Royal Protector_ Star Butterfly's personality is split between a Princess Classic and a Blood Knight personalities due to abuse, she almost gets killed when an assassin attacks her while the former is in control.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _The Cell_: Catherine Deane enters the mind of the serial killer Stargher, she encounters his weak innocent side, and his stronger evil side. In the end she has to kill both of them. The innocent side tells her to do it as a Mercy Kill.
-   Ed Norton's character in _Primal Fear_ is at first revealed to have an evil split personality that was probably the one responsible for the murder. After their stunt in the courtroom, with the trial finished, Richard Gere's lawyer character suddenly suspects it was the other way around, that the psycho killer in fact had a Helpless Good Side and he's now helped that psycho use his good side to get out of real jail time. Turns out that's not quite right either as there never was any good side at all, the whole thing was just the psycho doing an act and playing everybody (including a mental health professional).

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_:
    -   A variant occurred when Rachel morphed starfish and was split into two Rachels. Her 'Nice Rachel' side was this trope, weak, scared, freezing up under stress, not good for much of anything. However, unlike most examples of this trope, her 'Bad Rachel' side was just as big a liability because she couldn't think of anything more complex than "hit it till it falls over". _Both_ of them realized that as much as they didn't like the other, they needed each other. They worked together, and eventually recombined of their own free will.
    -   Interestingly, "Nice Rachel" is the one who got her _sense of duty_, which helped counteract this trope and kept her from slipping completely into Good Is Impotent - much as she hated to fight, she had a _duty_ to defend the Earth and her friends, so she had to.
-   Orion in _The Atlantis Complex_, up until he saves everyone. Unlike Artemis, he _listened_ when Butler taught him how to shoot a gun.
-   In _The Mage Winds_ trilogy, vicious Mornelithe Falconsbane turns out to be a legendary Big Bad from the past who is currently possessing a helpless boy named An'desha. An'desha doesn't want anything to do with this monster, but he doesn't dare fight him for fear that Falconsbane will snuff him out entirely. Fortunately, he gets allies who help him undermine Falconsbane from within; eventually they destroy him for good and An'desha can be himself again.
-   In _Nickolai of the North_, Skank and Skism are conjoined goblin twins (formerly an elf who couldn't decide whether he wants to mess with dark magic or not). Skism is mild-tempered, dreamy and kind, but is constantly bullied by Skank and has to follow his orders. He does manage to get a few Pet the Dog moments, especially when Skank is distracted.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Ben's presence in his and Glory's shared body _almost_ saved their lives as they transformed back into him just before Buffy would have dealt the killing blow and she leaves him alive instead. Too bad for him that Giles is savvy enough to just take care of the Dirty Business and Shoot the Dog.
-   In the _Doctor Who_ episodes "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood", in order to escape the titular Family, the Doctor uses a Chameleon Arch to turn himself into the mild-mannered, meek, human, named John Smith. Upon discovering who he _really_ is, John Smith is terrified of his true self, given how people describe the Doctor as being "like Fire and Ice and Rage". Eventually, John Smith elects to "die" to become the Doctor once more. Cue the Family meeting one _furious_ Time Lord.
-   Averted in _Jekyll_. While this version of Hyde is not only psychopathic, but also has explicit superpowers, Tom Jackman (the Jekyll side) is a highly intelligent and resourceful man in his own right. Consequently, he was able to keep Hyde in check for a long time, and set up a system of surveillance, communication and scheduled changes to which he forced Hyde to adhere under threat of turning himself in, which let him ensure that Hyde didn't do anything too terrible, and had a restraint chair built that he could trap himself in to punish Hyde if he broke the rules. Notably, despite all his displays of contempt for his "daddy", Hyde never doubted that Jackman did have it in him to hurt them both, and when their shared Papa Wolf instincts get triggered, Hyde recognises that he is stronger when he combines with Jackman's greater maturity and self-control.
-   _Kamen Rider Build_ inverts the trope by making the "evil" (actually morally ambigious) side the helpless one. The Well-Intentioned Extremist Takumi Katsuragi can't activate an upgrade of the Rider System despite having designed it himself. It needs a heart and emotions that he lost to misanthropy and questionable choices. He has to hand it off to his split personality Sento Kiryu, who would always return to a Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers! mindset even after suffering through a civil war and attempted suicide, because unlike the Ineffectual Loner Katsuragi he has Power of Friendship.
-   _Moon Knight (2022)_ portrays the meek, mild-mannered Audience Surrogate Steven Grant as this to The Hero Marc Spector and especially Jake Lockley.
-   In _Sanctuary_, Adam Worth is the inspiration for _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_. The Adam (Jekyll) side isn't exactly helpless, but at least he doesn't want to beat Magnus to a bloody pulp like the Hyde part.
-   Lex Luthor's good side in _Smallville_, a boy who goes by "Alexander".

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Wraith: The Oblivion_, player characters have their dark nature, the Shadow, balanced by their light side, the Eidolon. While the Shadow is usually _incredibly_ proactive about their attempts to defile, corrupt and destroy you, the Psyche, so they can take over and become a Spectre, the Eidolon typically has no will or personality of its own, but can provide bonus dice to resist the Shadow's actions. However, you can't do anything with it unless you spend character points on the relevant Background.
    -   In Spectres, the Psyche-Shadow relationship is inverted, with the Shadow dominant and the Psyche acting as a conscience, trying to nudge the Spectre towards redemption.

    Video Games 

-   _Borderlands 2_ has Krieg, a man who was experimented on, turning him into one of the Ax-Crazy, word-salad-spouting Psychos you've been mowing down by the dozen. His original personality still exists as a (very exhausted) voice in his head, who for the most part can only sit back and watch (and snark upon) the carnage and mayhem caused by the Psycho at the wheel. All the sane personality can do is make sure said carnage and mayhem is only directed towards people who deserve it by threatening to take control of their body _just_ long enough to commit suicide and kill them both if the Psycho ever hurts an innocent person. Whether he's actually capable of doing this or whether it's just a bluff isn't clear, but it works to keep the Psycho in line well enough (he's probably satisfied as long as he still gets to kill _someone_). The devs have compared him to the driver of an out-of-control truck with its brakes cut barrelling through a city. He can't slow it down or stop it, but he can do his best to steer it away from people and minimize casualties.
-   In _Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within_, the protagonist Alyssa can only run from and outsmart her enemies, while her evil side, Bates, pumps them full of lead when he takes the reins.
-   _Dark Souls II_ has Royal Sorcerer Navlaan. Talk to him while hollow, and you will meet a bloodthirsty assassin who will enlist your aid in killing a number of other NPCs. If human, however he will be meek and frightened, begging you to get as far away as possible and leave him there. It is implied that, rather than being a split personality, the former 'side' is actually another being using Navlaan's body as a vessel, and that the latter is his true self.
-   Downplayed in _Devil May Cry 5_. V (being The Fettered human half of Vergil) is by no means "weak", but compared to his released evil side Urizen (The Unfettered demon half), he's an ant begging to get squashed if he goes up against him, which is why he needs Dante and the gang's help to defeat him so he can perform a Split-Personality Merge to bring Vergil back.
-   Some fans of _Drawn to Life_ see Sock as this to Wilfre.

-   In _Nox_, Hecubah, of all people, is revealed to have a Helpless Good Side in the Wizard ending.
-   In _Sonic Unleashed_, Light Gaia manifests as Chip, a small fairy-like creature who needs Sonic's help to restore the Chaos Emeralds and seal away Dark Gaia. Subverted, however, once he regains his memories of being Light Gaia, including remembering that he can control the Gaia Colossus, which is imperative in helping Sonic take down Dark Gaia once and for all.
-   Emil in _Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World_, who spends the entire game resorting to his Superpowered Evil Side for every single random encounter. Until the very end, anyways, when Ratatosk, said Superpowered Evil Side, is exorcised from his body, and Emil takes a level in badass and fights as himself.

    Western Animation 

-   In an episode of _American Dad!_ had Stan go inside Roger's mind. There, he meets Roger's conscience, a withered Jiminy Cricket who is locked in a cage and dying from neglect.
-   In _Batman: The Animated Series_, Ventriloquist is portrayed in a similar manner in the comics. There's a creepy scene at the end of his first episode that shows him making a new Scarface dummy to replace the one that was destroyed earlier, showing that he still has a problem. The trope is averted in his last appearance. Unlike other times the doll is destroyed, Wesker finally gathers enough willpower to destroy the Scarface doll himself. The episode ends with Wesker finally moving on with his life and Scarface is never seen again.
-   _Darkwing Duck_ combines this with Ghost in the Machine — each character has a "little hero" in them, but villains have said hero Bound and Gagged.
-   _Jackie Chan Adventures_:
    
    -   When the Tiger Talisman splits Jackie into two sides, Jackie's light side, often referred to as _Pussycat_ by his darker side, acts much like this. Case in point, he cried when he stepped on a bug. However, as Jackie was Jackie, he's still able to kick ass.
    
    **Light!Jackie:** _(just after he kicks Dark!Jackie, he speaks in a genuinely friendly tone)_ Dropkicking little girls is not nice.
    
    -   Fully averted in an episode where Captain Black is being possessed by an oni mask, and the Tiger Talisman is used to draw out his light side; said light side isn't whiny, ineffectual, or overly apologetic in the slightest. However, some fans contend that the Talisman only separated Captain Black from the Oni Mask's consciousness, instead of separating Captain Black's own light and dark sides.
-   The fourth episode of _What If…? (2021)_ features the Alternate Universe where doctor Strange turns evil over trying to undo the death of his love Christine Palmer. The Ancient One splits him into two versions in hopes that the good Strange would stop the evil one. However the good version is completely outclassed and ultimately loses. Justified in that the evil Strange spent centuries amassing power, whereas the good Strange was at the point where the evil one began.
-   In _Xiaolin Showdown_, Dojo is normally a cowardly tiny dragon with no ability to fight whatsoever that can't even breathe fire without assistance. His Superpowered Evil Side however is powerful and underhanded enough to defeat and eat the rest of the protagonists with ease.
