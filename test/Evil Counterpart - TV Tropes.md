_"Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend. I am a shadowy reflection of you. It would take only a nudge to make you like me. To push you out of the light."_

A character who has similarities to a good or not-as-evil character, but is evil(er). They may look like that character and have/had abilities and obstacles similar to them. Sometimes, but not always, a Big Bad. Classically, an Embodiment of Vice pitched against a correlating Embodiment of Virtue.

Frequently, the Evil Counterpart is a Fallen Hero that represents what our hero might have become had their Backstory been slightly different — or what they could still become should they succumb to The Dark Side. They also save creators the trouble of thinking up new abilities to give their villains, especially for comic book heroes and video games (where new abilities have to be implemented). Because The Hero and the Evil Counterpart are such great foils for each other, the counterpart has an excellent chance of being the hero's Arch-Enemy or a Classic Villain, although this is not always the case. If the hero is an Anti-Hero, a Mr. Vice Guy, a Good Is Not Nice type or a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, the Evil Counterpart would have the same negative traits but none of their redeeming qualities. This character is virtually always a Mirror Character to the protagonist.

Often leads to a "Not So Different" Remark. May also be an Alternate Species Counterpart if the Evil Counterpart is of a different species than the original character.

In the Magical Girl genre, they're often a Dark Magical Girl. Contrast with the Worthy Opponent. Applied to an entire team, they are The Psycho Rangers. Applied to an entire race, they are an Evil Counterpart Race. This trope is not to be confused with the Shadow Archetype, but the two can overlap.

Sister Trope to, **but not to be confused with:** Evil Twin (evil biological twin), Evil Knockoff (intentionally created evil duplicate), Evil Doppelgänger (evil Alternate Universe persona) and Criminal Doppelgänger (evil Identical Stranger). In continuing works, has a chance of becoming Reformed, but Not Tamed.

If the first character to be introduced is the evil one, the good one would be his Good Counterpart.

    Advertising 

-   Frosties (the UK name for Frosted Flakes cereal) had a series of animated commercials (done by Richard Williams' studio), such as this, in which Tony the Tiger is opposed by an evil tiger named Tigerman, who wants to steal the Frosties Secret Formula to improve his own "Fake Flakes." Tigerman is Lean and Mean to contrast Tony's Heroic Build, and has much more prominent stripes than Tony's, including black marks around his eyes shaped like a Domino Mask. Tigerman also has a Cockney accent, while Tony has an American accent.
-   In the 1939 animated short “Breakfast Pals”, the first advertisement to feature Snap, Crackle and Pop, rival elves Soggy, Mushy, and Toughy are introduced in their only commercial. They represent a soggy and generic rival cereal brand and automatically attack the trio for "muscling in" on their turf, only to be defeated by the heroes by the end.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Christianity
    -   The Antichrist is the Evil Counterpart of Christ. In some interpretations the Apocalypse has also an Evil Counterpart of the Trinity made by Satan, the Antichrist and the False Prophet as opposites of God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost.
    -   A common Christian term for spiritual enemies (the world, the flesh, and the devil) has been analogized as a sort of anti-Trinity to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
-   Ahriman, also known as Angra Mainyu (Evil Spirit) is the Evil Counterpart of Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism. Unlike Judeo-Christianity in which God creates The Devil and, though God’s enemy the Devil is his subordinate and is not his equal, thus God is indirectly responsible for the existence of evil, in Zoroastrianism God is absolute and pure goodness to the point that he has nothing to do with evil. Evil exists thanks to Ahriman, a totally separated and independent entity. This is why some scholars call Zoroastrianism—and other religions inspired by it like Catharism—Dualism.
-   The Krampus is the Evil Counterpart of Santa Claus in Germanic folklore.
-   Bastard Bastard Mordred to Heroic Bastard Galahad in Arthurian Legend.
-   Loki has been construed as the Evil Counterpart to Odin (and it is debatable as to whether or not he was misconstrued as such). Though Loki is _not_ Odin's adoptive son in Norse Mythology, he is his adoptive _brother_ (where "adoptive" is more like with "brought into his family as an official member"). Both gods are Trickster Gods, are well-versed in magic, and are Shapeshifting Tricksters.
-   The Doppelgänger is supposed to be an Evil Counterpart of a person. In some myths, if you see your Doppelganger, it is a death omen, and/or the Doppleganger will kill you.
-   The Siddhe in Celtic Mythology are like evil versions of humans, every human has his own Siddhe. If they are shadows of The Underworld of part of The Fair Folk is unclear.
-   Some versions of the Bicorn are depicted as the wicked opposite to the virtuous Unicorn.
-   In Kabbalah, the ten Sephirot that represent ten different branches of the Tree of Life have the counterpart of the Qliphoth, which are dark/demonic shadows of the Sephirot. Left Hand Path practicioners generally work with the Qliphoth and not with the Sephirot.
-   In some Jewish Talmudic traditions, Samael and Lilith are seen as the evil counterpart of Adam and Eve as the forefathers of many demons.

-   The CIA Plantains of Kaiju Big Battel, grown by the CIA to discredit Los Platanos. The CIA Plantains actually appeared first, leading Los Plantanos to have to clear their good name.
-   Kane was brought in to be the evil counterpart of The Undertaker. Yes, the evil counterpart to a satanic, psychological tormenting zombie who was also the embodiment of death.
-   Daizee Haze was brought into Gateway Championship Wrestling as the good counterpart to MsChif, because what better to fight The Fair Folk than a New-Age Retro Hippie Granola Girl?

-   In Women's Extreme Wrestling, Lucy Furr from the "erotic heavens" was the evil counterpart guardian angel Heaven Sent and Angel Williams from "The Canadian Heavens". More like eviler counterpart to Williams though.

-   Sin Cara Negro was the evil counterpart to, Sin Cara Azul, though he started as a costumed copy cat before distinguishing himself with a black mask.
-   The Triple Tails were the evil counterparts to Syuri's dance group Apple Tale. The Triple Tails initially had no direct connection, as Apple Tale were in SMASH and Kana met with the Sexy Purple Thunder Sisters in NEO Women's Wrestling but seeing how Kana called Syuri her "arch rival" when she and the Shirais did show up in SMASH, it can be reasoned the name wasn't chosen by coincidence. On the flip side Syuri-gun\\Narcissist-gun was a good counterpart to Kana-gun\\Piero-gun in REINA.
-   La Rosa Negra was the evil counterpart to Sumie Sakai in the PWS. Ironically, after the Majestic 12 Tournament Arc most of their encounters did not happen under the company's banner. They tagged in World Wonder Ring STARDOM!
-   When Shocker became a rudo in CMLL, the mini estrella Shockercito remained a tecnico, making the second the good counterpart.

-   Hudson Envy is an evil counterpart to the president of World Wonder Ring STARDOM's USA branch, Cheerleader Melissa, being from the same region of the country and having a very similar wrestling style but fighting with Oedo~tai to takeover the promotion.

    Theatre 

-   Creon's story in _Antigone_ very closely mirrors that of the title character of prequel work _Oedipus Rex_. Both start out as kings on top of the world, but their stubborn pursuit of their goals despite the advice of those around them causes their entire lives to come apart. However, whereas Oedipus is motivated by the pursuit of justice and the well-being of his people, Creon is interested mainly in protecting his own power.
-   In the Screen-to-Stage Adaptation of _Mary Poppins_, Miss Andrew is the polar opposite of Mary, and has the Villain Song "Brimstone and Treacle" opposite "A Spoonful of Sugar".
-   In the _Mrs. Hawking_ play series, Mrs. Hawking has hers in Mrs. Frost. Neither one is socially permitted to lead the kind of life she wants, but the former reacts by trying to dismantle the system to free people, while the latter manipulates the system to her own ends at the expense of others.

Alberich has renounced love for power, as cursing love enabled him to forge the Ring of Power. Wotan almost renounces the Goddess of love Freia for Valhalla, symbol of his power. However the play shows they aren't that different; eventually Wotan calls himself Light-Alberich and Alberich Dark-Alberich.
    -   Hagen could be considered the evil counterpart to Siegfried. While Siegfried is the Heroic Bastard son of Siegmund and Sieglinde's Twincest, Hagen is a Bastard Bastard of the forbidden union of Alberich and Gutrune, when Alberich bought Grimhilde's love with gold. The Walsung line were started by Wotan, Siegfried's grandfather, to get the ring, while Hagen was born to get the ring. While Siegfried is strong and youthful, Hagen uses his cunning and has an aged appearance.

    Web Animation 

-   _Dreamscape_: Kaila is the Evil Counterpart to Keela. Both of them are demons from the Unworld. The difference is Keela is a Demon of Human Origin from the Master of the Dammed turning her into one, while Kaila is a full-fledged demon who was created by the Master of the Dammed.
-   _Helluva Boss_: Whereas I.M.P. is a for-profit Hit Man squad of, well, imps, the cherubs of their celestial counterpart C.H.E.R.U.B. work to save lives for free. Of course, "good" is a relative term in the show's Crapsack World and even cherubs can only be pushed so far.
-   _HTF +_: In HTF+CC 2 it turns out all the evil ponies are actually seperate entities from the originals.
    -   FI Creepybloom is pretty much an eviler personality of LG Creepybloom who was already a version of Applebloom, but later she turned into the good side in HTF+CC 2.
-   _The Most Epic Story Ever Told in All of Human History_: Ridiculously Epic Fail is this to Epic Fail. They are each the Bumbling Sidekick on their respective side and share the propensity for both Inopportune Voice Cracking and Epic Failure in general.
-   _The Most Popular Girls in School_: In Season 5, the French team is this to the Cheer Squad. All even more jerkasses than them.
-   _Murder Drones_: Doll to Uzi as of "The Promening". They both have the Absolute Solver which gives them telekinetic powers, and they both lost a parent (_both_ parents in Doll's case) to the Disassembly Drones' rampage. Unlike Uzi, Doll uses her powers to kill other Worker Drones and apparently cannibalizes them, and Doll is out for V's blood for killing her parents instead of blaming the series Greater-Scope Villain whom mind-wiped the Murder Drones into being their agents.
-   Amaroq is this to Kitty in _No Evil_. Kitty is a fox-spirit who's the Team Mom of the protagonists; Amaroq is a wolf-spirit who's the Team Dad of the antagonists.
-   _Red vs. Blue_:
    -   Felix towards Tucker. Both of them initially are only fighting in the war for personal gain, as Felix wants to be paid and Tucker just wants to find his friends and leave. They are both cynical and sarcastic, and the two of them are arguably the most skilled members of the New Republic. However, towards the end of Season 12, Felix is still fighting for his own gain, disregarding the lives of the inhabitants on Chorus and enjoying the violence. Tucker however, grows to care a great deal about the people on Chorus, to the point where he selflessly risks his own life to save them. Tucker is also shown to dislike violence and war, only getting his hands dirty when he has to and preferring to knock out or capture his opponents. Meanwhile, Felix is a Sadist who takes joy in killing innocent people. Tucker also values his friends and teammates among the Blood Gulch Crew, whereas Felix merely manipulated them for his own interests.
    -   The Blues and Reds are the evil counterparts to the Reds and Blues. While Church is a short-tempered asshole who is constantly annoyed by his team, he does actually care for them, Temple acts calm and polite, but it's clear from the way he threatens Loco that he sees his team as expendable. And unlike Church, who learned to let go of his desire for revenge against Project Freelancer, Temple never does. The other counterparts are: Surge to Sarge, Gene to Simmons, Buckey to Tucker, Loco and Caboose, and Cronut to Donut. Biff and Grif are the plot-important counterparts as Biff's death is driving the vengeful Blues and Reds, while the Reds and Blues are doing this mission _despite_ Grif's refusal to get involved. Because of this, the Blues and Reds overlook Grif, allowing him to become the unlikely rescuer of the Reds and Blues.
-   _RWBY_: Mercury to Yang. Yang is a gold-themed, boisterous, outgoing Boxing Battler; she has a cybernetic arm, using Arm Cannons and Fire Dust in battle. Her father taught her through compassionate wisdom to learn from bitter experience to fight smarter, use her Semblance as a last resort, and move beyond her pain; Mercury is a silver-themed, calculating, laid-back Dance Battler; he has cybernetic legs, using Armed Legs and Wind Dust in battle. Mercury's father taught him through abusive Training from Hell to fight unaugmented, trapping him in a cycle of pain after stealing his Semblance. Both are protectors; Yang for her sister, Ruby, and Mercury for his friend, Emerald.

    Web Original 

-   Parodied by the "Evil \[X\] Be Like" meme template, which consists of using an image of a celebrity or fictional character — often edited with Glowing Eyes of Doom or a Photoshop Filter of Evil — accompanied by an inverted version of a well-known line or song lyric associated with them as the bottom caption, such as "evil" Martin Luther King Jr. saying "I have a nightmare" instead of "I have a dream," or "evil" Billy Joel singing "We DID start the fire" instead of "We didn't start the fire."
-   Among LOLCats:
    -   Basement Cat to Ceiling Cat.
    -   Tacgnol to Longcat.
-   The acquisition of Eevee was one of the most controversial moves ever made in _Twitch Plays Pokémon Red_. Its evolution into the False Prophet Flareon later solidified it as one of the stream's primary villains. The Eevee in _Twitch Plays Pokémon Crystal_ serves as its Good Counterpart: his arrival was greeted quite fondly, it is believed that he is destined to redeem Flareon's legacy, and now that he's evolved into Espeon through The Power of Love, he serves as The Heart to the TPP Crystal team.
-   _Whateley Universe_: Tansy is sort of one to Ayla, as they're both rich, went to the same schools, are about as smart as each other... Could have had the same friends, like She-Beast...

    Web Videos 

-   _Atop the Fourth Wall_:
    -   Lord Vyce to Linkara. Both are extremely powerful due to using both magic and technology, both are convinced they are in the right, and they both have Pride as their Fatal Flaw. The difference? Linkara realizes he is going down a dark path — Lord Vyce never did.
    -   Holokara later becomes Linkara's _literal_ evil counterpart. He is a hologram programmed with Linkara's memories, and the two start off as basically identical. Linkara puts Holokara in charge of the show while he goes to find out why his magic stopped working, which turns out to be because Linkara, who had become increasingly arrogant and self-centered, was in danger of turning evil. Linkara, horrified at this realization, begins working on becoming a better person. Holokara, however, never receives this epiphany, and eventually jumps off the slippery slope and becomes more and more Ax-Crazy, culminating in a plan to blow up the Marvel offices if they don't undo all the damage they've done to the characters of his favorite superheroes over the years.
-   In _The Cartoon Man_, Simon becomes Roy's evil counterpart when the same black ink that caused Roy's cartoon transformation turns him into a mustache-twirling cartoon villain.
-   Channel Awesome has multiple, mostly due to a lack of actors. A list:
    -   Dark Paw for Paw Dugan,
    -   Black Lantern Spoony One Prime for Spoony of _The Spoony Experiment_,
    -   Ask That Guy with the Glasses for The Nostalgia Critic,
    -   Phelous D1, Suolehp for Phelous,
    -   Mechakara for Linkara of _Atop the Fourth Wall_,
    -   Judas Liz for Iron Liz.
-   _Critical Role_:
    -   Delilah Briarwood, like Percy, made a Deal with the Devil out of love. Delilah did it to save the life of her beloved husband whereas Percy did it to bring vengeance to the Briarwoods for the murder of his family. The difference is that Delilah (and her husband, Sylas) doubled down on their deal, whereas Percy worked to back out of it once the full consequences became known.
    -   Dr. Anna Ripley, who took part in the murder of his family and brutally tortured Percy for the Briarwoods in the aftermath, is a genius engineer as Percy is and is trying to replicate his invention of guns for her own use and to sell on the black market. She even makes a deal with the same demon Percy did to further her work. In essence, Dr. Ripley is everything Percy fears he might become, and she makes his fear that he won't be able to control his invention a very genuine reality.
    -   In Campaign 2, two years before the start of the story, Lucien tried to communicate with the Somnovem by projecting his soul into the Astral Sea. However, this ritual was sabotaged, and his soul was shattered. One of these shards ended up staying behind in his body, woke up with no memories or identity, and eventually became known as Mollymauk. Inverted, in that Mollymauk is Lucien's Good Counterpart — Molly is a charming, sarcastic Jerk with a Heart of Gold who gives money away to anyone he thinks might need it, while Lucien is an Omnicidal Maniac whose ultimate goal is to bring the city of Cognouza to the Material Plane so it can devour the world.
