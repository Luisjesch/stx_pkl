This trope is a stock comedic ending. After a whole episode of wacky shenanigans, a character sees some innocuous object which reminds them of today's harrowing misadventure, and promptly has an unusually negative reaction. Its severity can vary, from an expression of distaste and exasperation ("No thanks, after today's horrific incident I don't want to see another codfish ball as long as I live") to full-blown homicidal rage, or a panic attack where the character flees screaming a Big "NO!" into the distance.

Often the other characters will express confusion ("Was it something I said?") if they aren't in on the story, or laugh uproariously if they are. Certain characters may even invoke this for their own amusement.

Status Quo Is God ensures that by the next episode the character has already gotten over their debilitating case of PTSD (or at least change of preferences) and will mention it no more.

A subtrope of Trauma Button. Compare Cold Turkeys Are Everywhere, Here We Go Again! and We Are Not Going Through That Again. If the events of the episode were All Just a Dream, and they respond with anger, it's overlapping with Mad at a Dream. For further laughs, the trauma button will be treated like an Absurd Phobia.

    Anime & Manga 

-   During the Yellow Temperance chapter in _Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_, an impostor Kakyoin licks a cherry in an unnerving fashion before challenging Jotaro to a battle, which Jotaro narrowly wins. After the battle, when the Joestar group is on the train to their next destination, the real Kakyoin eats a cherry in the exact same way the impostor does, prompting the obligatory "Yare Yare Daze" ("Good grief" in the dub) from Jotaro.
-   In _Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun_, Hori is frustrated at Nozaki's inability to draw proper backgrounds; he ends up drawing his characters floating. So Nozaki draws in a Scully Box to explain it. Boxes start appearing in _every_ scene, and Nozaki even includes a panel with a character explaining that In-Universe, boxes are the hot new trend. Hori gets so sick of boxes that he kicks one out from under someone using it in real life to reach on top of a shelf.

    Animation 

-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: In one episode, it's Paddi's birthday; coincidentally, it also happens to be Wolnine's birthday as well. Her husband Wolffy bakes her a gigantic cake and kidnaps and traps Paddi inside of it, but Paddi manages to escape by eating his way out. By the time he's reunited with his friends at his party, he's much too full to eat his own birthday cake, and bursts into tears while complaining about his stomachache.

    Comedy 

-   Two classic _Abbott and Costello_ routines that follow a similar path:
    -   The "Niagara Falls" routine (also made famous by _The Three Stooges_), in which two men meet (one is implied to be a wanderer) and in casual conversation Costello's character triggers Abbott's (the wanderer) Berserk Button (**"NIAGARA FALLS!"**), and he brutalizes Costello's character while reminiscing the time that he hunted down a man that stole his girlfriend to that location. Variations of the routine have Costello's character either reflexively wincing when someone else comes along and says the name after the wanderer leaves, being pummeled by the wanderer because of said button-pressing (but the newcomer stays safe), repeating the wanderer's irate rambling (and pummeling) to the newcomer, or discovering the hard way that the bitter rival the wanderer keeps reminiscing developed the same Berserk Button from those events and getting pummeled _again_.
    -   The "Susquehanna Hat Company" routine has Costello's character wandering the streets trying to deliver straw hats to the titular hat company, only to find out that every person that he meets for one reason or another has the hat company as a Berserk Button (the company is rumored to be corrupt, their loved ones died wearing a hat from the company, a crazy guy (that thinks he's a ghost and is implied to be the one that a previous passerby considered "dead") was wearing one when he "died", etc) and they wreck a hat in a rage before storming off (to add insult to injury, they pluck it off Costello's character's head to do so — and in one occasion even pulling it off the box he placed it in to _prevent_ them from destroying it the moment he noticed they were starting to act crazy). The routine ends with Abbott's character (a fellow salesman) pointing out that Costello's character only has one hat remaining ("and what excuse are we gonna give the Susquehanna Hat Company?") and Costello's character wrecking the hat as he goes in a similar screaming fury.

    Comic Books

By the end of his shift, he's sick of bikinis and swimsuits and is ready to go to bed. However, his female friends, who had gone to the beach, decide to drop by and visit in their swimsuits (because they felt sorry for him at missing the beach eye candy, not knowing about the department he's working at). The story ends with him rushing up to his room screaming, while his mother and female friends looks on, completely perplexed.
