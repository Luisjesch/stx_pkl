_"Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names."_

Concerning forgiving one another, it can be difficult sometimes. Some of your good-hearted people such as the Nice Guy, All-Loving Hero, or the Wide-Eyed Idealist would be willing to allow bygones be bygones, but for the Anti-Hero, Knight Templar, or the Jerkass, not so much. Then, there are some people who actually can (or will) forgive and can still give others the cold shoulder, which is this trope.

In short, this is more of a bitter cousin of Easily Forgiven. Instead of following the adage "forgive and forget", these type of characters choose the "forgive" part only. No matter how forgiving the character is, they still feel genuinely hurt by the transgressor's actions or words, which explains the cruel attitude. Perhaps the character is still distrustful towards them and believes that the transgressor may do the same thing all over again; then again, this reason may be justified. Perhaps the person either has a bit of a short temper, takes the smallest things too seriously (such as having their foot being unintentionally stepped on), or may be something personal, making it impossible to forgive the other completely. Concerning this trope, merely because people forgive doesn't necessarily mean they will move on.

Usually, other variants would show that one character will come to sincerely say they're sorry to the other and they will still call them out of their wrongs with responses such as "you've hurt my feelings" or "you oughta be sorry". They may hear that they are trying to change their ways but is still not good enough to make them completely happy again. These kind of forgiveness are given by wary characters, and if they forgive the offender, may give out warnings of threats or other ultimatums to them should the action be repeated. As far as forgiving others and not forgetting their act goes, this is usually seen as a character still finding it difficult to truly move on, a character having bad trust issues, or merely a character being an insufferable jerk.

It's worth noting that this trope isn't always found on the cynical side of the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism. To detail this trope positively, forgiving others doesn't mean tolerating what the other has done. One, it can be a process to heal all negative emotions that the victimizer has caused and that the victimizer will take responsibility for never repeating their mistakes. Even so, just because the person has forgiven the other doesn't mean they have to be friends with them; they would still be satisfied to see them receive their Laser-Guided Karma for good measure.

The Atoner may not care if the forgiver is still not going easy on them, since the only thing that means to them is that they are pardoned for their wrongs. If they do care for the forgiver's approval again, though, then they will work hard to make that person happy with them again, or at least improve themselves morally. If the forgiver does indeed become happy, it can become heartwarming. If not, then this can become a rather complex story, and it may lead to the implication that the character has never really forgiven them at all.

Definitely Truth in Television, but examples are unnecessary.

Compare Flippant Forgiveness (the sarcastic variant), My Fist Forgives You, and Restrained Revenge (both tropes are about being even with the wrongdoer while forgiving him, usually physically). Contrast Rejected Apology, Reformed, but Rejected, and Heel–Face Door-Slam, which demonstrate that the character is _not_ forgiven at all, no matter how sincere he is in his apology and turning his life around.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Aruosumente_, Moeran hates Oracles because Oracle Kian, Legna's father, was somehow involved in the death of Moeran's precious teacher, and while Legna was sheltered from any consequences, Moeran was instead threatened with permanent imprisonment. Eventually, Moeran realizes that Legna has no idea what happened and seems ready to forgive him, though he's by far not ready to forget. Forgiving and forgetting Legna's ignorance is another matter.
-   In _Banished from the Hero's Party_, Theodora Dephilo a former friend and comrade turns against the group because she wishes to force Ruti to resume her role as The Hero when she tries to run away from her duties. Even though she knows what it would do to her, she still decides to press on. This leads to her fighting her former comrades. Unlike with Ares, the party chooses to spare her after defeating her, because they acknowledge that she had some noble intentions, and that her criticism of their actions are justified, as they were prioritizing their own happiness over the lives of thousands of innocent people. That said, the group makes it clear that while they don't hate her and have forgiven her, they likely will never be able to see her as a friend ever again.
-   In _A Certain Magical Index_, most people who know of Accelerator's past, and especially his involvement in the Level 6 Shift project, acknowledge that he's trying to be a better person, but certainly are not about to let him forget what he's done. Accelerator doesn't expect them to; indeed, he can't forgive himself. The only person who seems to have wholeheartedly forgiven him is Last Order.
-   _Daily Lives of High School Boys_: Karasawa only needs to take off his cap to make clear to Habara that he still hasn't forgotten it was her who put a scar in his forehead in elementary school.
-   _Dragon Ball Super_: The current Grand Elder Namekian, Moori, says as much to Vegeta when he and Goku come to New Namek's defense in the Moro Arc; Namekians aren't the type to hold grudges, but they also have long memories, and they haven't forgotten the things Vegeta did to them in the Namek Saga. It's part of why Vegeta is so determined to protect them from Moro.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_, Scar was given this sort of advice from his master in regards to avoid dwelling himself in revenge too often or he will turn into a beast:
    
    "Enduring and forgiving are two different things. You must not forget the unjustness of society. As a human being, you must hold the event in contempt. Yet, you must endure. You must put an end to the chain of hatred!"
    
-   In _Kotoura-san_, Hiyori was uneasily forgiven for bullying Haruka and nearly getting Manabe killed and as a side effect broke Haruka in the process, although this is because Haruka can read her mind and see that she's genuinely sorry for what she's done. Also, Manabe knows Hiyori was the one responsible for the attack and was actually shocked and suspicious when she starts hanging out with them. Haruka's grandfather also implied quite clearly he knew what Hiyori had done and, while not mistreating her, _did_ make it clear she wasn't off the hook with him. (He made a "Haruka-land" theme park for his granddaughter, with her and her friends as mascot characters. Hiyori's was locked in a burning cage.)
-   In _Naruto_, this is Naruto's attitude towards Nagato after all the harm that he's caused. After hearing of all the hardship Nagato went through which led him to being the person he was, Naruto realizes that even if he can't stop himself from hating him for what he's done, he will still forgive him, as not doing so would only perpetuate the cycle of hatred and revenge that was plaguing the world of shinobi.
-   Inverted in _Yureka_, where Muria refuses to forgive the main trio for their past misdeed towards her, despite _none_ of them remembering what, exactly, this actual misdeed is.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Crisis on Infinite Earths_, Lady Quark does forgive Pariah for the destruction of her universe, which he never meant to do, but says that she will never forget. But it turns out Pariah wasn't responsible at all.
-   In _Just a Pilgrim_, by Garth Ennis, the titular character thinks about all the terrible crimes he had committed and decided that while God was going to _forgive_ his crimes, He wasn't going to _forget_ them. He decided that he wasn't going to let himself forget about them either, branding his face with a red-hot crucifix as a constant reminder.
-   _Ultimate X-Men_: Wolverine initially joined the X-Men as The Mole, to kill Xavier for Magneto, and then had a Heel–Face Turn. He was largely forgiven for it, but Jean kept distrusting him for it, mainly because he seduced her during the attempt.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: While Diana forgives Hercules and Ares she never forgets what they've done and what they are, a concept Ares understands and appreciates in his own dark way and which Herc does not understand and resents. This is probably key to why Diana and Ares get along better than Diana and Herc even though Ares is unapologetically unheroic while Herc tries his best to act as a hero.

    Comic Strips 

-   At the end of one 1980 story arc, Garfield seems willing to forgive Jon for trying to have him declawed, but gives him a _very_ unsubtle reminder not to try it again.

It helps that they're all in heaven at this point.
-   _Warrior_:
    -   There is this conversation between Paddy and Brendan Conlon. The former was an alcoholic abusive father who favored the latter's brother, Tommy:
        
        **Brendan:** You never had any interest in underdogs. But I was your son.  
        **Paddy:** You _are_ my son, Brendan.  
        **Brendan:** Am I?  
        **Paddy:** Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you if can find... find a little bit of space in your heart to forgive me a little bit.  
        **Brendan:** Yeah? All right, I forgive you.  
        **Paddy:** Okay.  
        **Brendan:** But I do not trust you.

    **Steven Grlscz:** Sorry? Oh yes.  
    **Anna Labels:** Good.  
    **Steven Grlscz:** Actually can we not do this? I can't do it this quickly. Accept apologies when I'm still angry. You can't say something like that and then say sorry. Do you see?

The serpent seeks revenge against him, stinging all of the cattle on his farm, causing a huge loss. The farmer then seeks reconciliation with the serpent, but the serpent relents, saying that the farmer will never forget the death of his son and he won't forget the loss of his tail. The story ends with the statement "Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten."
-   _Husband Material_: Downplayed. When Luc meets Miles, the man who ruined his life, again, he accepts to attend his wedding with a young youtuber, as an olive branch. While attending the wedding, he makes a few amends with some people he used to hang out with before their break up also tore apart their shared friend group and gets to see a bit of Miles's side of the story (he did feel guilty about his actions and all of their closest friends sided with Luc, cutting him out of their lives). When he parts with Miles, he seems to have buried the hatchet, but very clearly states that they're not, nor will ever be, friends, and he will always be the man that ruined him for years.
-   In the _Discworld_ short story "The Sea and Little Fishes", Granny Weatherwax punctuates the day's Paranoia Gambit by finishing off with a nice grandmotherly speech about forgiving trespass (in the context of having been slapped by one of the other witches who had turned hysterical by her uncharacteristic niceness, and who had insulted her earlier by asking her not to come in the first place) before returning to her regular self, effortlessly winning the Witch Trial with a magnificent (and destructive) display of fire magic applied just to light the ceremonial bonfire, and adding "...I never said nothin' about forgettin'".

She still feels entitled to smack Sirena in the face if they ever meet again.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_ Stannis Baratheon quotes the trope title verbatim in regards to his stormlands bannermen, who initially declared for Renly (his little brother who was after Stannis both as their legal lord and in line to the throne) only to turn around and come back to him once Renly died. He compares them to Robb Stark and Joffrey Baratheon's men, who at least stand loyally by who they believe is their rightful king.

After all, if he lost his soul once, there's always the chance it could happen again.
-   From the _Burn Notice_ episode "The Hunter", Sam and Madeline had a conversation about Sam blowing up her living room in "Lesser Evil":

Despite it, Ivy and Amy hadn't forgotten about Spencer cheating on Teddy as they did a fake breakup in order for their school to see that the latter is not a jinx.
-   _Horatio Hornblower_: Discussed by Dr Clive and Lt Hornblower after Captain Sawyer has Midshipman Wellard caned. Dr Clive prescribes laudanum on everything and implies it will make Wellard forget, both the pain and the injustice. Hornblower thinks Wellard won't really forgive the Captain, considering he was beaten only because of Sawyer's growing paranoia.
    
    **Dr Clive:** Nasty business, that, nasty business. But then again, boys have been beaten since history began. It would be a bad thing for the world if ever boys should cease to be beaten.  
    **Lt Hornblower:** That may well be your medical opinion, Dr. Clive but I can see no useful purpose served by thrashing a young boy within an inch of his life.  
    **Dr Clive:** Come, come, Mr. Hornblower. A little tincture of laudanum for the pain and all will soon be forgotten.  
    **Lt Hornblower:** Forgotten, maybe, Dr. Clive but forgiven?  
    **Dr Clive:** Careful, Mr. Hornblower. I've had the good fortune to serve the captain for over 15 years, and he has inspired nothing but loyalty in the men under his command.
    
-   _ICarly_: The episode "iStillPsycho" shows Nora, who was released from prison, coming to apologize to Carly and the gang for what happened in "iPyscho". Even though they rebuked her for her psychotic behavior, they immediately become on good terms with Nora. For now...

-   Despite her reputation for being Easily Forgiven, Regina Mills from _Once Upon a Time_ is actually this. It takes a whole season and a half since her shaky Heel–Face Turn in Season 2, and two consecutive bigger evils, for the heroes to go from Teeth-Clenched Teamwork to truly trusting her, and even then they're still (justifiably) on the watch for her possible relapse into evil way into Season 5.
    -   The same goes for her sister, Zelena. Granted, she remains a bit of a wild card for much longer, but she isn't truly accepted into the Charming clan until the back end of Season 6.
-   _The Sandman (2022)_: Calliope's attitude towards Richard Madoc after she's freed is a variation on this. When Morpheus asks how she could forgive him after what he has done to her, Calliope states she won't forgive what he did but she will forgive the man himself, for her own sake if nothing else. As a result, Morpheus agrees to Calliope's request to release Madoc from the curse he put him under.
-   _Schitt's Creek_: In early seasons, Alexis turned down _two_ marriage proposals from Ted and inadvertently cheated on him with Mutt, shattering Ted's heart.

-   _Shake it Up_: Rocky gets upset when "CeCe" would drag her into situations and get her into trouble, eating a giant meatball the size of the car even though the latter is a vegetarian, and sneaking off to a party where she had to be a waitress. However, "CeCe" went too far during the events of _Shake It Up, Up & Away_ as Rocky got tricked and wound up dancing on a wing of an airplane. Although she forgave her, Rocky hadn't forgotten as she brought them up to "CeCe" in _Shrink it Up_. However, after hearing "CeCe" reasons, Rocky fully forgives her for the events of _Meatball it Up_ and _Party it Up_ but still hasn't let go of the events of _Shake It Up, Up & Away_ as she brought up to her again in _Shake It Up: Made in Japan_ along with mentioning it in a flashback in _Remember Me_. Also, after the events of _Shrink it Up_, Rocky tries to be more understanding and forgiving of "CeCe" but still shows to haven't forgotten, doing an application for a fine arts academy without her knowledge, getting into a game show where they do disgusting things if the contestant gets a question wrong, sneaking into a movie lot and signing up for a boot camp instead of a dance boot camp, as she brought some those events up in order to help her in _Remember Me_ when she got amnesia. However, after "CeCe" failed to remember her, Rocky breaks down as she not only realized that she has to let go of "CeCe"'s actions but also fully forgives her for the events of _Shake It Up, Up & Away_, which got her to get her memory back.
-   John Watson in _Sherlock_ communicates this to his wife, Mary, after it's revealed in the worst possible way that she used to in fact be a professional assassin, since she shot Sherlock, and had lied to Watson about her entire past through all their relationship, but he has nevertheless decided to forgive her. It's understandable since Sherlock _is_ John's best friend.
    
    **Watson:** _\[during a tearful hug with Mary\]_ All this does not mean that I'm not still basically pissed off with you. I am _very_ pissed off, and it _will_ come out now and then.
    
-   Ruth Wardell in Season 2 of _Snowpiercer_ gets away with her actions in Season 1 because the current circumstances make her a necessary Token Evil Teammate. It takes most of the season, though, for Layton and the rest of his inner circle to trust her and let her in on their plans, and that only happens once she starts pulling a genuine Heel–Face Turn.
-   Discussed and played with a little in the pilot of _Stargate SG-1_. Jack O'Neil(l)'s son Charlie died after accidentally shooting himself with Jack's sidearm before the movie, and Jack has this to say about it:
    
    **Jack:** I think, in her heart, \[my ex-wife\] forgave me for what happened to our kid. She just...couldn't forget.  
    **Daniel:** And what about you?  
    **Jack:** I'm the opposite. I'll never forgive myself. But sometimes I can forget. Sometimes.
    
-   In _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode _Once More Unto the Breach_ General Martok ends up in this state of mind at the end. Throughout the episode he has been treating Dahar Master Kor (who is desperately seeking a role in the war rather than dying naturally, despite having PTSD flashbacks and aging) badly because he could not forgive Kor for rejecting his application to become an officer out of class snobbery (Which, in Klingon society, bars you from ever becoming one, unless you get a field commission). When Kor sacrifices himself in the place of Worf to save the entire crew of Martok's ship, including Martok himself, he forgives Kor and offers a toast in his memory. However, he doesn't join in with the singing afterwards, showing that his emotional wounds are still too raw for him.
-   In Season 5 of _Supernatural_ Dean forgives Sam for his role in starting the Apocalypse and, after a few episodes apart, is willing to work with him again. But it takes him most of the season to fully regain his trust in him.
-   In the _That '70s Show_ second season episode, "Halloween", Eric learned that his best friend Hyde tried to kiss Donna in the first season episode, "Ski Trip". In "Eric's Stash", a few episodes later, though inflamed by Laurie, it's revealed that Eric still resents Hyde for it to the point he blames Hyde for stealing some money from him. It was Eric's father, Red, who took the money to buy a new hot water heater.
-   _The Walking Dead (2010)_: In the episode "The Grove", after Carol confesses to Tyreese for killing Karen and David and offers her gun to him, Tyreese forgives her but tells her he will never forget what she did.

    Music 

-   Aretha Franklin's 1995 hit, "Willing To Forgive". Almost invokes the trope word for word in the chorus (with potential "What's good for the goose" thrown in).
    
    Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
    
    'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
    
    And I guess I can go on although I must admit
    
    I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time
    
-   Papa Roach's "Blood" pretty much deals with this trope. This line in particular:
    
    _I will forgive, but I won't forget  
    And I hope you know you've lost my respect_
    
-   The Corrs' "Forgiven, Not Forgotten" is about a woman grieving over the loss of her lover who committed suicide. She's forgiven him for leaving her behind but is still emotional over this.
-   Inverted in Bring Me the Horizon's "True Friends", which is about the protagonist venting about an ex-friend who betrayed him.
    
    _I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you. 'Cos I'll forget but I'll never forgive you.  
    Don't you know, don't you know? True friends stab you in the front._
    
-   Willie Nelson had the number one hit "Forgiving You Was Easy" (the next line is "But forgetting seems to take the longest time).

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Bible_: Exodus 34:7 gives the implication that God is good, kind, compassionate, and merciful, yet this doesn't mean that He will let the guilty go unpunished for their sins.
    -   In 2 Samuel, Shimei, a relative of King Saul, curses King David. After Absalom was killed by Joab, Shimei asks David to spare his life, to which David agrees. In 1 Kings, as David lies dying on his deathbed, he declares that Solomon will succeed him as king of Israel, and charges Solomon to not hold Shimei guiltless but to properly deal with his enemies. After Solomon is crowned king, he has Shimei restricted to Jerusalem, not to cross the Brook Kidron under penalty of death. When Shimei heads to Gath to recover his slaves, Solomon has Shimei executed.
    -   Culture-wise, the Edomites are a case of this, since their ancestor Esau was depicted as forgiving his brother Jacob of cheating him out of his inheritance in the Book of Genesis, but later in the Book of Obadiah they have gotten to the point of aligning with Israel's enemies to cut them down at the time when the Babylonians were invading the land of Judah.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   A trademark of Dutch Mantel's booking, particularly in regard to the ever-popular Heel–Face Turn. The Colon's and the Gonzales families may work together to protect CSP/WWC from the usurpers like El Maestro, La Revolucion, or invaders from independent coalitions(New Wrestling Stars and New Empire), IWA PR or Mexico (AAA, Konnan and Alberto El Patron in particular), but the Colon family will never forget that Ray Gonzales decided to make the feud with family patriarch Carlos personal by dragging his children into the business and the Gonzales family will never forget Carlito taking things beyond WWC's business when he trashed the Raytings Mini Mart. Similarly, IWA PR's roster rallied to help Savio Vega when Jeff Jarrett sought to take the company with the backing of NWA\-TNA, they ultimately joined him in his invasions of WWC, but never forgot the abuses they suffered under his "My way or highway" policies.
-   The Undertaker said this to the Ministry of Darkness from their failed attempts of trying to kidnap Stephanie McMahon after they defeated The Brood at WWF Backlash 1999. Later that night, the Ministry tried to capture Stephanie, only for her limo to drive away. When Stephanie asked the driver to stop, it was revealed that the Undertaker was driving the limo.
-   A couple of years prior, when Paul Bearer was begging the Undertaker to forgive him for his betrayal, Taker had stated that betrayal is something he would never forget, but he contemplated forgiving Bearer. It was all a ruse, and Undertaker knocked Bearer on his ass and was about to perform a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown on him until Mankind saved Bearer by throwing a fireball to the Undertaker's face.

    Tabletop Games 

-   An aversion in _Deathwatch_: as your armor's history, you can get the option "To Forget is to Forgive. Never Forget." It grants an automatic Hatred against whichever enemy killed your armor's past owner. This being _Warhammer 40,000_, however, you're probably not doing it right until you have Hatred for _everyone._
-   Inverted by the dwarfs in _Warhammer Fantasy_, whose language lacks a word for "forgiveness". To a dwarf, a matter can be _settled_, at which point it is promptly forgotten, but an unpaid debt or a wrong will gnaw on a dwarf his entire life. Indeed, dead dwarfs pass down any of their debts or wrongs they haven't repaid to their family or their community, with most major dwarf settlements having a communal "Book of Grudges" where every unsettled matter is remembered forever, waiting for the community's chance to pay it back in a suitably disproportionate manner.

    Video Games 

-   At the start of _Assassins Creed IV_, Edward usurps the life and identity of a treacherous former Assassin named Duncan Walpole.

The Caribbean Brotherhood partially forgives Edward and only spare his life because Mary Read vouches for him. They appreciate his skill in battle, his possession of the Eagle Sens, and his nature as a Wild Card but do not recruit him due to the above incidents. It is only years later and much Trauma Conga Line before Edward becomes Older and Wiser and finds his place among the Brotherhood.
-   During the Golden Ending route of _Aviary Attorney_ Jayjay can grudgingly forgive Inspector Volerti for nearly getting an innocent man killed in order to see if Jayjay is an infamous Serial Killer, but it's clear that his opinion of the Inspector has changed. In the other routes, where there's no 'nearly', he's less sanguine.
-   _Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem: Heroes of Light and Darkness_: Katarina is confronted by Cecille, who is clearly still hurt by her betrayal at the end of the prologue in their support conversations. Katarina accepts it, and vows to work hard to earn back her trust and friendship.
-   _God of War_
    -   For the Greek saga: In _God of War_, Kratos is told that his Accidental Murder of his wife and child will be forgiven if he slays Ares, who is busy laying waste to Athens. He takes this to mean he will be able to forget and lose the Past Experience Nightmares he has had every night since. Unfortunately for him, Athena takes away this impression. As she herself says, they promised only to forgive him, as not even the gods could forget what he had done. And unfortunately for _them_, this led to Kratos's increasing mistrust and misgivings of the Gods, which ended up in the wholesale destruction of Olympus. This whole example acts as a Deconstruction.
    -   For the Norse saga: In _God of War Ragnarök_, Freya desires revenge after Kratos and Atreus killed her son Baldur, and repeatedly tries to kill the pair throughout the first act of the game. When she's forced to join Kratos and Atreus to stop Odin and when she and Kratos are alone together, Kratos opens up to Freya about his own family — his brother Deimos, his wife Lysandra, and his daughter Calliope — making her realize that they both share the pain of Outliving One's Offspring. She doesn't forgive Kratos until she meets the Norms where Freya is hit with Brutal Honesty that Baldur's demise was her fault, since she made him Feel No Pain and refuse to tell him how to undo it, which drove Baldur insane. Even after breaking her curse so that she can freely travel between realms again, Freya admits that there's a part of her that will always be angry at Kratos for what happened, even if she admits that what happened to Baldur was ultimately her fault.
-   In the post-game of _Hades_, Zagreus tells Persephone he doesn't hate Hades and never did, but his resentment of him may never be totally gone even after their relationship has been patched up. For his part, Hades is fully aware that Zagreus may never forgive him for everything that happened and accepts the blame, admitting that he deserves it for being a bad parent.
-   The Sangheili/Elites in _Halo_ after they have their Heel–Face Turn and team up with humanity to stop the Covenant. It's made crystal clear that even though everyone is (mostly) willing to move past the near-annihilation of the human species that the Sangheili committed against them since there are more pressing matters at the time, humanity at large has _not_ forgiven or forgotten what the Sangheili did. The relationship between them continues to be rocky at best well into the future.
-   In _Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire_, Aloth forgives one of his Abusive Parents; either his negligent, absentee mother or his domineering, violent father. Which one depends on choices made in the first game. In the case of his father, forgiven in Aloth's more morally ambiguous path, Aloth forgives him because he comes to see him as "a weak man" who tried to be a father but simply wasn't cut out for authority.
-   _Red Dead Redemption II_: John Marston had left the gang for a year and is welcomed with open arms from most of the gang. Arthur Morgan, on the other hand, is less than forgiving, disgusted that John had left the entire gang as well as Jack (whom at first John doesn't believe is his son). Eventually, Arthur starts warming up to John again after the latter is determined to get Jack back from Angelo Bronte.

-   In _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, Makoto forgives the first victim, Sayaka Maizono, an acquaintance from middle school that he had a crush on, for trying to kill someone and frame him for the crime. At the end of the trial, Makoto repeats a joke that Sayaka had told him, and in the second game, he uses Sayaka's Dying Clue of 11037 as a password, saying it came from someone who saved him. However, that doesn't mean he's forgotten what happened, as toward the end of the first game, he's baffled why Sayaka would willingly agree to stay in Hope's Peak Academy despite being desperate enough to escape to try to "graduate."
-   In _Umineko: When They Cry_, Yasu/Beatrice forgives Natsuhi for throwing him/her off the cliff, saying s/he has tormented her long enough.

-   Froge from Froghand praises Good Old Games for not having any DRM, and thus making it easy to fileshare its games, yet brings up his (alleged) rejection of his (allegedly) popular game.
    
    Good Old Games rejected my Good New Game for unspecified reasons despite universal praise from everybody who played it, as opposed to those two dozen or so people who I sent copies to and didn't, those bastards. But I will admit that hosting files which make it super easy to spread is, on the whole, the thing the gaming industry needs most right now.
