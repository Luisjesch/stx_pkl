When a television series isn't canceled abruptly, writers have time to wrap things up. There seem to be a pretty standard set of types of Series Finales to end on, provided the show's creators have time to plan it out in advance. Most of these can all be mixed together as one wishes. Occasionally, the series may then be Un-Cancelled, and the writers find themselves in a corner, leading the series into a Post-Script Season.

-   Villain Death: The main antagonist dies, ideally, by being defeated by the good guy. This may just be the set up for the proper ending which may take on any of the below forms.
-   Birth: A long-running couple gives birth to their first child.
-   Back to Normal: In a supernatural or superhero show, the main character is robbed of their supernatural abilities/technologies/friends and goes back to living a normal life (or, at the very least, tells his or her loved ones about his or her powers and decides to go on the run and try to live a normal life while keeping his or her powers under wraps).
-   Cliffhanger: The viewers are left hanging on what happened. Similar to the Gainax Ending or the All Just a Dream ending, this ending isn't very popular with most fans (unless a more skilled writer knows how to work with it). Most of the time, it's used in series that get canceled thanks to Executive Meddling rather than end because the creator planned on ending it, but there are cases where a cliffhanger is seen on a series that ended due to the creator wanting it to end it there rather than being Screwed by the Network (cf. _The Amazing World of Gumball_) and usually, a finale movie, short-lived post-script season revival, or, at the very least, the creators themselves answering fan questions online or at a convention is used to tie up any and all loose ends and answer viewer questions.
-   Distant Finale: The show flashes forward into the future to show what happened to the main characters. Can be used in conjunction with the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue (whether it's a montage within an episode or just a full episode or chapter)
-   Gainax Ending: In the end, something happens...and nobody understands what the hell actually happened — unless the viewer is really good at drawing conclusions and can piece together what happened, and even if a viewer can do that, there would still be loose ends and unanswered questions to plot holes and noodle incidents.
-   Graduation: If the series centers on kids in school, expect this to be the final episode, especially if it's a high school series. If it's a live-action show with aging actors who would resemble graduating high school students by the end of production, then it's all the better. A series centered on college students rarely have this as an ending (as most college shows, whether or not they're spin-offs, don't last) but the graduation ending on college shows does exist.
-   Grand Finale: Failure Is the Only Option stops being in effect, and with failure suddenly _not_ the only option, the series premise is finally resolved. Since Tropes Are Not Bad, this stock ending can be met with lots of fanfare as the characters we root for succeed.
-   Here We Go Again!: The series ends on a middle note, referencing something from one of the earliest episodes and showing that Nothing Really Changed after all.
-   "Everybody Dies" Ending: Everyone dies or gets killed (main characters, main antagonists, even side and one-shot characters). Can be used in conjunction with the trope Last Episode, New Character if one wants to set up a spin-off series.
    -   Bolivian Army Ending: Basically, the above mixed with Cliffhanger; a character is about to die, but it's left up in the air as to whether the character actually dies.
-   Last-Minute Hookup: The two Will They or Won't They? characters finally get together.
-   Moving: The cast or the principal stars move away. This is usually the case in family sitcoms, and some that end this way are Clip Show episodes. May go hand in hand with a graduation ending as the high school students go their separate ways.
-   Stock Sitcom Grand Finale
-   Walk Into the Sunset and And the Adventure Continues: The series ends with the characters going off on another adventure. This ending is the one ripe for fans to either write fanfiction about what happens after the series ends or fans to pester the creators into continuing the series with a spin-off or a reboot.
-   Wedding Finale: The main couple or a pair of supporting characters are married off.
-   "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue: Sometimes used in conjunction with other ending tropes (particularly the "Graduation" ending, the "Moving Out" ending, and the Distant Finale ending); what happens to the characters in the future is summarized either in a captioned statement, a montage (as seen with the endings to _Regular Show_, _Adventure Time_, and _OK KO, Let's Be Heroes_), or a voiceover narration, usually on a person-by-person basis.
-   The entire series is revealed to be All Just a Dream (whether it's from the mind of someone dying, someone unconscious/in a coma, or from someone sleeping). Often, this is the bad writers' way out of a series or done to retcon anything considered Fanon Discontinuity. If you're a series writer, use caution and sufficient foreshadowing and Fridge Brilliant (and/or fridge horrific) call-backs before using this.
-   Final Battle: An action/adventure series usually ends with this. May be a precursor to any of the above.

**As you might expect, this is an ending trope. Expect unmarked spoilers.**

-   The infamous ending to Stephen King's _The Dark Tower_ series, where (after a full page of the author urging the reader to stop right there because endings can never satisfy the buildup a story creates) Roland finally enters the Tower, only to find that it resets him back to where he started in Book 1 of the adventure (albeit with the implication he has a chance of getting it right this time).
-   The animated series _Mighty Max_ ends with Big Bad Skull Master killing all the supporting characters, only to be defeated by Max at the end in a move which teleports Max all the way back to the first episode of the series (although, as he retains his full memories of the entire series, presumably he has a chance of doing better this time round).

It turns out Fraggle Rock exists there too.
-   In the last episode of _Friends_, Chandler and Monica move to the suburbs, and it's mentioned that all of them have lived in that apartment at some point. (Phoebe was established as having shared it with Monica prior to the first episode; Ross gets a retcon that he stayed there for a while when his and Monica's grandmother still lived there.)
-   The Series Fauxnale of _Scrubs_ has J.D. moving to a different hospital. (Then he moves back to Sacred Heart when it gets Un-Canceled, only it's not the same Sacred Heart any more.)
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, whose producers knew they weren't getting a movie, has this happen to many of the characters following the Final Battle — Sisko is taken up to join the Prophets, Odo returns to the Great Link, O'Brien takes a teaching job at Starfleet Academy, Worf becomes the Federation ambassador to the Klingon homeworld, Garak remains on Cardassia after the war, and Rom goes off to become the Grand Nagus.

Will They or Won't They?

-   _How I Met Your Mother_ ends when Ted realizing that he really did love Robin the whole time and goes to her apartment with the symbol of their love, the blue french horn.

Gainax Ending

-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ is the most infamous, though the actual ending is relatively easy to understand if you take a College Course on Philosophy, Psychology, and/or Religious Studies.
-   _The Prisoner (1967)_: In the end, everyone goes crazy, wears weird costumes, and sings Dem Bones all day long. Would have been the Trope Namer if Gainax wasn't so infamously divisive at endings.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_'s first finale (when Comedy Central had canceled them, and the Sci-Fi Channel hadn't yet Un-Canceled them) has Mike and the bots fly the Satellite of Love out to the edge of the universe, where they all ascend as beings of pure energy. Meanwhile, Dr. Forester reenacts the notoriously confusing ending of _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (with the Monolith replaced by a giant VHS tape labeled "the worst movie ever") and reverts to a baby, and his mother Pearl takes the opportunity to Raise Him Right This Time.

Other

-   _Parks and Recreation_ had so many series fauxnales that several episodes fall into some of these tropes. "Lil Sebastian" (Season 3 finale) falls into the And the Adventure Continues trope, with Leslie thinking about running for city council, Tom quitting his job, and Ron's ex-wife Tammy 1 returning. "Leslie and Ben" falls into the wedding trope, with Leslie and Ben's wedding. "Moving Up" is a Distant Finale, with a 3-year Time Skip. The actual series finale is a "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue.
