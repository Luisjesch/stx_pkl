_"You and I have a tendency towards corpulence. Corpulence makes a man reasonable, pleasant and phlegmatic. Have you noticed the nastiest of tyrants are invariably_ thin_?_"

The big, fun, lovable fat guy. May be a Boisterous Bruiser depending on how much they like to fight and shout, or just a Gentle Giant. Often a king or other aristocrat whose wealth and lifestyle lends itself to fabulous feasts, a Chubby Chef who delights in his/her craft, or in contrast a modern young man whose weight makes him more identifiable. Depending on the fandom, he can also be a Big Beautiful Man.

Almost Always Male it seems, probably because of the usual Double Standard about attractiveness and such and most likely classed as a Tomboy. If female, though, she's likely to be a Big Beautiful Woman and maybe a Sassy Black Woman, or often, simply a female variant.

Contrast the Fat Bastard, which is when the fat person is, well... a bastard, and this trope's corollary Lean and Mean, when a skinny person is unpleasant. See also Fat Comic Relief.

Nothing to do with the song from the musical adaptation of _Heathers_.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Tetsuro "Poppo" Hisakawa from _Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day_. Then it's subverted, because in good part this is a facade. In reality, Menma's death affected him _way_ more than he lets others see, specially because _he saw her die and couldn't do anything about it_.
-   _Area no Kishi_: Araki is a skilled football/soccer player with a comedic, laid-back personality. He's also chubby due to his bad eating habits and out of form after temporarily retiring from his beloved sport.
-   In _Assassination Classroom_, Akira Takaoka comes off as this. A big guy who is a lot friendlier than Tadaomi Karasuma, even bringing snacks to his first day of teaching the class. It is soon revealed this is a complete act as he is actually a Sadist Teacher who fully enjoys inflicting pain on children if they go against his orders.
-   _Bleach_ has Kirio Hikifune, a genial Big Beautiful Woman who's a Supreme Chef and a member of the Zero Division and former captain of the 12th Division. However, when she expends most of her spiritual energy, she turns into a hot lady that can give Rangiku a run for her money.
-   Junpei "J.P." Shibayama of _Digimon Frontier_. Bit of a Dogged Nice Guy. Known for his magic tricks and giving of chocolate. He was actually rather friend-less and insecure deep down, as revealed in his backstory, but with some Character Development he fits in better.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   The Ox King, Chichi's father - originally introduced in the original _Dragon Ball_ as a wicked warlord, but quickly turns out to be a decent guy and a doting father (and as the series progresses, doting grandfather).
    -   _Dragon Ball Z_ has Android #16, the biggest and tallest of the trio with Androids #17 and #18. While #17 & #18 are bratty, cocky, and hotheaded, #16 is calm, gentle, and cherishes things like nature. He refuses to engange in any fight, unless it fulfulls his programming to terminate Goku; but he eventually steps into battle against Cell when he realizes that Cell will destroy the nature he came to love.
    -   _DBZ_ also introduces Majin Buu's fat form, especially after his Heel–Face Turn. He's childishly cheerful and treats combat as a fun game.
-   Kurita of _Eyeshield 21_ is a more subdued version of this trope. He's gentle, friendly and fun, but hardly boisterous.
-   In _Great Pretender,_ Kim Shi-won is a Rare Female Example. She's a heavyset Cool Old Lady who simply _loves_ being a con woman. She seems to treat it as a game, and is always boisterous and open to her fellow team members.
-   Rider (Iskandar/Alexander the Great) in _Fate/Zero_ is a downplayed version in that he was incredibly muscular instead of fat (he has arms bigger around than most people, period). He is easily the largest Servant in terms of both height and general body mass, and at the same time thinks that every new thing in the modern world is just AWESOME and is an avid gamer, naturally (being who he is) he plays strategy games. We can only assume that he was pretty damn good at them too.
    -   Honestly, this guy takes both Boisterous Bruiser and Big Fun to the max, everything he does is specifically meant to be both awesome and fun. Really, it seems that by his definition, for something to BE awesome at all it has to be fun. Take for example the infamous King's Banquet, where he shows up out of nowhere at the Einzburn castle with a literal cask of wine and asks saber to join him in drinking it. He shows up in a T-shirt and jeans _while driving a lightning bolt shooting chariot_. And he somehow managed to convince Gilgamesh of all people to come too?
-   _My Hero Academia_ has BMI Hero: Fat Gum, a professional hero in Osaka who is recognizable for his cartoonishly bulky physique and a friendly personality to match. His bulk has practical applications as well, thanks to his Quirk "Fat Absorption". In a pinch, he can also burn that fat for a considerable boost to his strength and agility (which also has the effect of transforming him into a muscular Hunk), but he will always worf down takoyaki afterwards to return to his ideal bulky physique.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   The series has Choji who is a Big Eater with a Big Heart who's willing to defend his friends with his life. But remember not to call him fat.
    -   His dad Choza also qualifies; in the databook, he's described as 'an extreme glutton' and 'very loving'.
-   _One-Punch Man_ has S-Class Hero Pig God as this. Although he initially seems to be just an obese man only interested in eating, he drags himself (while severely injured) all the way from the hospital to a recent battlefield in order to make sure none of the monsters he fought can escape, telling the people who come to get him that it's his responsibility. And overall, his facial expressions convey a strong sense of determination, especially when his fellow heroes are in danger. He also reacts with visible concern when his peers are injured. He even seems quite non-threatening to speak to, when he's not eating.

    Comic Books 

-   _Be Prepared_: When Vera and Phillip first arrive at camp, one of the counselors, Grusha, greets them in a very enthusiastic way.
-   _The Golden Age_: Bob Daley used to call himself Fatman during his days as a crime-fighting sidekick and is a friendly man who is quick to try and help his friends. His joviality only vanishes when he is feeling mistreated by Thompson.
-   Volstagg from _The Mighty Thor_, who is explicitly based on Falstaff. (In one comic, two orphaned children - who he would later adopt - mistook him for Santa Claus.)
-   Obelix from _Asterix_ \[PUNCH\] "It's all muscle, that's what it is!" He's not fat, he's "low chested."
-   _Generation X_: Subverted. Mondo seemed at first to be a party animal. As it turned out, he was a spy planted by the villain Black Tom Cassidy, who eventually turned against them. He also wasn't the real Mondo.
-   _Il Grande Blek_: Professor Occultis, who is a very likeable person to talk with.
-   Fat Cobra from _Immortal Iron Fist_ is a Big Eater and womanizer who loves a good fight and is quite friendly.
-   _100 Bullets_: Daniel Peres is more serious than most versions of this, but he's introduced lounging by the pool with Benito and Megan and later spends the night at a casino, while never displaying any cruelty or snobbery, unlike so many of the other (far slimmer) Trust leaders.
-   _Wonder Woman_
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_, _Sensation Comics_ & _Comic Cavalcade_: Golden Age Etta Candy, who was a cheerful prankster, Boisterous Bruiser and unapologetic candy loving Big Eater.
    -   _Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman_ "Ghosts and Gods": Etta is a plump good natured prankster who loves to punch Nazis.
    -   _The Legend of Wonder Woman (2016)_: Etta is a Big Beautiful Woman with a great sense of humor who is kind, fun and the life of the party.

    Fan Works 

-   _A Diplomatic Visit_: Big-Cheer the wolf, the widest and friendliest of the trio from Big Apple Orchard, who got his name for always being a little bigger than his littermates and having a near-constant smile on his face.

-   _Kindred_: It's mentioned that Salma, one of the Sultan's now-deceased concubines, was a Big Beautiful Woman who could make people laugh easily.
-   Diplomatic Incident from _Legionnaire_ is a senior statesman, an accomplished spy, a political mastermind, and this.
-   Fredbear and Freddy Fazbear are both large and have this as their programmed personalities in _Something Always Remains_. In this universe, it's because Fredbear's personality and girth were based on the owner's - Bonnie Wickes - dead husband, Freddy Wickes. Freddy Fazbear kept this personality and design when Fredbear's Family Diner was retooled into Freddy Fazbear's Pizza after Bonnie's death.
-   Hurley from _We Can Be Heroes! (Steven Universe)_ is a fat, jolly, Muppetesque alien and one of the nicest people Lapis meets in the Nova Veluti system. Thanks to him letting her hitch a ride when her ship ran out of fuel and got towed away on top of that, he endears himself to her in a hurry.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Anastasia_ has Vlad - the cheerful, exuberant fatherly presence to Anya (who frequently takes her side over Dimitri). He also has a companion in Sophie who is also full-figured, energetic and charismatic, also a Big Beautiful Woman to boot.
-   Maui of _Moana_ is a large demigod (while muscular, he's also on the hefty side) who, in addition to being fun-loving and cheerful, is also very boisterous and full of himself. It's eventually revealed that some of this personality is a mask: he was abandoned by his parents as a baby, and thinks that nobody really loves him. As such, he's compelled to give humans gifts and miracles to keep their affection.
-   PJ develops in this direction in _An Extremely Goofy Movie_, becoming the center of attention at the disco briefly and spending much of the last part of the film enjoying himself (except for one brief relapse and a moment of peril). Before that point—in the first part of the movie, the predecessor, and the series—he _was_ kind and friendly, but "fun" was _not_ how he would be described most of the time. He was a Nervous Wreck and a Shrinking Violet who was very pessimistic, sometimes downright despondent, not usually enthusiastic, and even when he was it would be subdued compared to those around him with similar goals. The reason for this change? He earned his happy ending.

-   Po the Panda from _Kung Fu Panda_ _acts_ like this, to mask his insecurity at being the fat oaf at the Furious Five's kung-fu school. He gets more serious as the film series progresses, but he still remains a nice and fun guy.
-   _Shrek_, in a Jerk with a Heart of Gold sense. He puts on a Fat Bastard facade (literally since he's voiced by Mike Meyers) because he doesn't like how "people judge me before they even get to know me."
-   _The Book of Life_:

-   The Candlemaker is a rather big jovial ball of wax.

-   Baloo, from _The Jungle Book_ and _TaleSpin_, is this, but in bear form.
-   "Big Daddy" LaBoeuf of _The Princess and the Frog_, who is a rare positive example of a Fat, Sweaty Southerner in a White Suit.
    -   Lewis the Alligator - notable in that he's the very first alligator to not be a total jerk.
-   Jethro from _The Prince of Egypt_ is both tall and broad, and his attitude helps bring Moses out of his depression.
-   _Cats Don't Dance_: Tilly the hippo is one of the friendliest characters and the first of the animal actors to give Danny a warm welcome.
-   Gloria the Hippo from _Madagascar_ is a rare female example. Her kind personality gets others to enjoy her company a lot. Many male characters find her attractive as well.
-   John Silver from _Treasure Planet_, even after his reveal as the Big Bad Friend. He's savvy, charismatic, an irrestible Large Ham, and an encouraging mentor to the insecure protagonist.
-   _Barbie in A Christmas Carol_: As per usual, the Spirit of Christmas Present—although it's a rare female example.
-   _Ratatouille_: Émile is chubby and the nicest rat around.
-   In _Turning Red_, Mei's giant red panda form is eight feet tall, on the chubby side, extremely fluffy and huggable, bubbly, energetic, and generally lots of fun to be around. When she's in a good mood, that is. When she's not...
-   _Zootopia_: Officer Benjamin Clawhauser, a fat, cuddly, Ambiguously Gay, food-loving cheetah who is a Gazelle fanatic, and the warmest, bubbliest, most welcoming member of the Zootopia Police Department.
-   _All Dogs Go to Heaven_: King Gator, a huge alligator who likes to sing and dance. While befriending Charlie, he puts on a show-stopping musical number.

    Films — Live Action 

-   In _Remember the Titans_, Louie is the first to easily break racial tension, and can crack a joke or two: "I just gave your mamma a piggy-back ride, and she weighs _twice_ as much as I do!". His actor Ethan Suplee may have been this before he lost _200 pounds_.

-   _Best Night Ever_ has a female example. Janet is chubby (by Hollywood standards; by normal standards she's average size) and constantly cheerful and bubbly.

-   The Trunchbull of _Matilda_ is most definitely _not_ an example, but she claims to be in a one-off line, saying "I like a joke as well as the next fat person".
-   _Julie & Julia_ has both Julia and her sister, more tall than fat at 6'2" and 6'4" respectively, but boisterous and bursting with good humour.
-   _The Three Musketeers (1993)_ has Oliver Platt's version of Porthos, the life of any party and (he claims) quite successful with the ladies.
-   _Murphy's War_: The helpful, compassionate, and relaxed Louis is the most heavyset character in the film.
-   _Mystery Road:_ The shopkeeper (who is credited as Robbo but called Mick in the movie itself) is a bit paunchy and is pleasant in a casual way. He seems to get along well with Jay (who buys ammo from him) and is quick to cooperate when Jay asks about who has been buying knives like the one used in the murder.
-   _Land of the Dead_: The heroes are accompanied by several of Kaufman's soldiers, one of which is a fat Samoan named Pillsbury. He's just there as comic relief, basically.
-   Tracy Turnblad from _Hairspray_ is a rare female example. She’s energetic and optimistic, which gets her to be a popular dancer in the Corny Collins Show.
-   Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle is a significant Trope Codifier for his Acrofatic turns in the silent film era (even some times winding up with the girl, as in _Leap Year_ and _The Life of the Party_ (both 1921).)
-   In _Antebellum_, Veronica's friend Dawn is Big Beautiful Woman and Sassy Black Woman who makes no secret of the fact that she intends to use their night out to get laid _and_ text Veronica all of the details as it is happening.
-   _Shotgun Stories:_ Boy is one of the paunchier characters in the movie, is more easygoing than his brothers, and coaches basketball for little kids.
-   Wendover from _Doctor in Trouble_ is a rather stout man and consistently manages to be the most fun-loving passenger on the _Golden Horn_, which causes lots of irritation for Captain Spratt and the other passengers:
    
    **Wendover**: Avast behind!
    
    **Fat Woman**: _Cheeky!_
    

    Folktales 

-   Robin Hood:

-   The animated adaptation featuring _Mr. Magoo_ portrays Friar Tuck as being a Big Eater with food nearby.

-   Santa Claus is depicted in legend as a jolly overweight old man who brings presents to people around the world every Christmas. As far back as 1823, Clement Clark Moore's poem _A Visit From St. Nicholas_ described his "little round belly, that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly."

    Literature 

-   Porthos of _The Three Musketeers_ starts off the rollicking, boozing, woman-chasing party animal of the Musketeers. As the series wears on, Porthos seems to get physically larger every time he's described, until by the final book, he's practically a giant.
-   Mr. Fezziwig from _A Christmas Carol_, Scrooge's jolly, jovial employer who hosts a Christmas party for his employees, including Scrooge, is known for his generosity, and is quite a bit of a dancer.
    -   The Ghost of Christmas Present has a big feast laid out when Scrooge meets him, and shows Scrooge the festive mood of the yuletide season being celebrated by miners, the Cratchit family, and Fred's party guests.
-   In the _Aubrey-Maturin_ series, Captain Jack Aubrey has often been chided by Stephen Maturin over his weight. He weighs around 18 stone, which is roughly 250 pounds. Of course, he's also an excellent fighter, which puts him squarely in Stout Strength (and Genius Bruiser, considering his tactical prowess and achievements in astronomy and mathematics) territory. He also loves to party when he has the chance, and he's been known to make an utter fool of himself in social occasions, which makes him a Boisterous Bruiser too. The ladies seem to appreciate it too: He's practically the James Bond of the Napoleonic War era.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   King Robert Baratheon. Also a slight deconstruction; as a Boisterous Bruiser put into the role of king and forced into a loveless political marriage after the woman he fought the war for in the first place died, Robert's been unable to exercise most of his appetites (the ones that aren't drinking and whoring), which has led him to grow fat. The jovial humor masks a _heavy_ accumulation of grief, rage, and utter disappointment.
    -   Wyman Manderly is widely seen as this, a massive man who enjoys food, wine, and jests. In A Dance with Dragons, it's shown that this is a ruse; his revenge against the Freys reveals a cunning and ruthless mind behind the merry facade.
    -   Deconstructed with the historical ruler Viserys I, the "Young King" who presides over the Targaryen dynasty at arguably the peak of its power. By all accounts, he was a blast to be around in court, but his intent to preserve the peace and prosperity that his predecessor and royal grandsire had achieved fifty years ago made him blind to the rifts forming within that court. As time goes on, the conflicts burst out into the open, and Viserys' health slowly begins to fail, to the point that he grows so fat and out-of-shape that he has to be carried round in a chair—but as long as he still lives, he's the only thing from turning that conflict into open war. And sure enough, when he does die, it's not long before the Targaryen line fractures into a crisis of succession and a civil war that leaves almost no one in Westeros unscathed—least of all the Targaryens.
    -   Also deconstructed in that Westeros is a highly martial feudal society, so being fat is a sign of weakness. Being fat is one of the reasons why Samwell Tarly got exiled to the Wall by his warrior of a father.
-   _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_: Rowley is larger than Greg, and more cheerful and optimistic than him.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Nanny Ogg — a very plump witch who loves food, booze, and music and can even get a date despite having "a face like an elderly apple," because she's _that much fun._ A good demonstration of this occurs when she meets Casanunda, who asks her out mainly because he Really Gets Around, but it's noted he has a great time in the process.
    -   Archchancellor Ridcully is one of the few wizard examples; many other wizards are fat and love food, but are do-nothings or actually nasty. Ridcully on the other hand likes sports and jokes and is a Boisterous Bruiser.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Hagrid (whose size comes from being half-giant) is one of the more amicable characters in the series. He is a very kind warmhearted man, who likes to invite Harry and his friends for tea and biscuits every once in a while during their stay at Hogwarts. Hagrid is essentially the first true friend of Harry.
    -   Subverted with Professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn is explicitly described as being obese, has a friendly larger than life personality and occasionally throws parties at Hogwarts. On the other hand, he shows obvious favoritism to students with good family connections or great academical talent. Only these students are invited to his parties.
    -   Subverted by the entire Dursley family, sans Petunia. Uncle Vernon, as well as his son Dudley, are described to be obese but only ever display reprehensible behavior, most prominently seen in the way they treat Harry. Even worse is Vernon's sister Marjorie, a dominant and nasty woman who only seems to be just tolerated by her family members. Fortunately, Dudley gets better through Character Development.
    -   Subverted with Ludo Bagman. A strongly-built man gone to seed after leaving Quidditch, he constantly acts like this, but is is a self-centered gambling addict whose personality may just be a facade.
    -   Played straight with Friendly Ghost, The Fat Friar. He is an overweight friar who died from being hanged.
    -   The Fat Lady, the portrait guarding Gryffindor Tower, is a fun-loving figure who makes a habit of getting quite drunk over Christmas. Naturally in the third film, she's played by Dawn French.
-   Sgakahav "Sig" Wilobst, the owner of the Wilobst Pioneers Ltd mercenary/gun-running firm in _Riesel Tales: Two Hunters_. He is this to an extreme literal level — his species is, on average, eighteen feet tall, and he has a big, jolly personality to match. Sookaiya Venatosh, one of his mercenaries, is this to a lesser extent.
-   _Knaves on Waves_ has Carnage, who is exceedingly huge, charismatic and festive, even while he's committing atrocities.
-   _Mr. Men_: Many of the Mr. Men and Little Misses that are defined as being happy go lucky (Like Mr. Happy, Little Miss Sunshine and Little Miss Giggles) or being energetic (such as Little Miss Fun) tend to be round in shape.
-   According to _'Twas the Night Before Christmas_, and to virtually every depiction that's followed it since, Santa Claus has "a broad face, and a little round belly / That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly."
-   Delly Carwright from _The Hunger Games_, comparatively. Katniss says that Delly wasn't really fat, but she had a few pounds to spare (in contrast to the majority of District 12). Fittingly, she's friendly, cheerful, and a total Nice Girl.
-   _BattleTech Expanded Universe_ novels introduce Chandrasekhar Kurita, a portly, good-natured member of the Draconis Combine royal family. Described as "buddhaesque," he was often regarded as "the fat fool" because of his cheerful nature and hedonistic love for food, women, and parties. This was almost certainly a form of Obfuscating Stupidity, because he proved to have amazingly sharp political and business acumen to make up for his lack of military aptitude or royal ambitions. In one of the most brilliant applications of his natural talents as the Big Fun, he even tried to undermine the strength of their hidebound, honor-obsessed foes the Clans by encouraging their supporting castes to simply have fun, enjoy their lives, and not be beholden to the warrior caste's whims. Stories set in late 32nd century suggest that his efforts to tempt the lower castes actually succeeded where almost all other efforts to undermine Clan culture failed.
-   Enforced and deconstructed in the 1929 short story _Big Blonde_. The once played-straight Hazel Morse ends up suffering from a suicidal depression, but her peers dislike being around her when she's sad. As a result, Hazel pretends to be happy even though she isn't.
-   Falstaff in _Henry IV_ and _The Merry Wives of Windsor_— though he's also something of an Inappropriate Role Model for Prince Hal.
-   Hangbelly, the jovial, large First-Walker, from _Tailchaser's Song_.
-   Deconstructed in _Fat Kid Rules the World_. The depressed and obese Troy doesn't understand why people seem to think fat people are inherently funny. People always seem to laugh at him no matter what he does, and he's seen this trope so much in media, but he doesn't get _what_ is so funny. Troy himself is anything but Big Fun—being a friendless, awkward Loser Protagonist on the verge of suicide until he meets Curt.
-   _The Horse and His Boy_: King Lune is heavily implied to be this: he's certainly fat, but he's described as jolly, and he throws great parties.
-   James Herbert:
    -   In _Fluke_, jolly, heavily overweight Bella briefly takes in and feeds the titular dog.
    -   _Portent_: Avuncular, heavily overweight geophysicist Hugo Poggs, and Bibby, his not quite as big but just as nice wife.

-   _The Reluctant King_: King Ishbahar of Iraz is obese due to loving food (even his "tea" features an enormous amount) while also very nice and cheerful, all together fun being around.
-   _Chocoholic Mysteries_: Red-headed Dorothea "Dolly" Jolly, introduced in _Frog Frame-Up_, is six-foot-three, 250 pounds, and pretty much always cheerful.
-   In _One Hundred Years of Solitude_, Aureliano Segundo is fat for most of his life and is a fun person to be around as he eats in feasts, plays the accordion and gives constant raffles.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Fate: The Winx Saga_ has an original character called Terra, who's a caring Team Mom figure, although has plenty of neurosis and insecurities. She lampshades the trope when Riven makes fun of her weight, proving to Beware the Nice Ones.
    
    **Fate:** People always think that they can treat the big girl like shit. Because we’re sweet and harmless, and we should be happy that you’re even talking to us. But sometimes we’ve had a really really bad day and some squirmy little asshole says the wrong thing at the wrong time and suddenly we’re not happy that you’re talking to us and we’re not sweet and most of all we’re not harmless.
    
-   _Game of Thrones_: For all his flaws, Robert's boisterous amiability among fighting men is the main thing holding his kingdoms together. In the _Histories and Lore_ segments, Stannis—who is usually very critical of his brother—admits and praises Robert's gift for inspiring loyalty and converting sworn enemies into True Companions with his carousing.

-   _Power Rangers_
    -   Bulk from the first few years of the series started as The Bully and one of Those Two Guys, but Character Development resulted in his mellowing out and showing a nicer side. Best exemplified by his return to the franchise in _Power Rangers Samurai_, where he is (or at least tries to be) the mentor to his best friend's son.
    -   Ernie, the owner of the Youth Center in _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ to _Power Rangers Zeo_ is this. He is frequently seen helping his clientele, by listening and advising them about his problems and also organizes many kinds of fun activities at the Youth Center.
    -   Ms. Appleby, also from MMPR, is the kindhearted teacher of Angel Grove High. She shows a lot of interest in her student's activities and has massive amounts of patience with Bulk and Skull, even playing along in their antics sometimes.

-   Gordon Crisp on _Freaks and Geeks_. At one point he and Harris even lampshade the trope.
    
    **Gordon:** My whole family's big-boned. It's genetic.  
    **Harris:** Besides, the world loves jolly fat guys. Burl Ives. Jackie Gleason.  
    **Gordon:** Santa Claus. Curly. Raymond Burr.  
    **Neal:** No. Raymond Burr isn't jolly.  
    **Gordon:** Well he was extremely nice to me at last year's auto show.
    
-   All of the gnomes that appear in the Belgian children's series Kabouter Plop by Studio 100. Well at least the main 5 characters except Smal who is thin.
-   Deconstructed in an episode of _Empty Nest_ where a one-shot character appears to be this, but turns out to be a Stepford Smiler who's adopted a cheerful persona because Big Fun is just about the only positive trope that overweight people can aspire to.
    
    **Danny:** I learned a long time ago that if you're fat and funny, people like having you around - you're a "great guy." But if you're not funny, then all you are is fat.
    
-   Parodied on _MadTV_. After cast member, Will Sasso, ended up losing a lot of weight, Debra Wilson pulls him aside backstage, and tells him he was much funnier back when he was fat, leaving Will desperate to try and put the weight back on.

-   _Saved by the Bell_:
    -   An episode with a date auction has Zack being bought by a larger girl called Wendy, who's very sweet and energetic. Unfortunately, she gets very offended when Zack shows signs of backing out of their date, but they patch things up in time for the dance.
    -   Lampshaded when Screech gets annoyed at his overweight Bad Boss Leon Carosi.
        
        "Haven't you heard that fat people are supposed to be jolly?"
        
-   Referenced in _Seinfeld_ when Jerry is worrying about some recent weight gain.
    
    **Kramer:** You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
    

-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_ has Marge in the episode "A Piano in the House," a heavyset woman who is extremely cheerful, friendly, and jovial, and cracks more jokes about her weight than anyone. In a rather sad scene, the magical piano forces her to admit that deep down, she wants to be loved and to be seen as beautiful, but fears it'll never happen. While she is genuinely kind and fun-loving, it's implied she's making jokes at her own expense so no one else can do it behind her back.

    Music 

-   Paul Baloff, the late lead singer for Thrash Metal band Exodus, fit this trope. Some people even nicknamed him "The John Belushi of Heavy Metal" because of his outgoing, uninhibited, party animal personality.
-   Fats Domino, of course. His first hit was "The Fat Man."
-   Most members of Bowling for Soup are at least overweight, and they sing songs about being happy and are sometimes downright silly. Even most of their songs about heartbreak are fairly optimistic and/or funny.
-   "B.F.F.!" by The Aquabats!, a song about Fat Best Friends, has this to say on the matter:
    
    _These jolly giants are never cruel.  
    All big people are really cool!_
    
-   Fats Waller exuded this image of a performer who is big, fat and entertaining and fun to be around, so much so that his stage name "Fats" was based on it.
-   The 80's rap group The Fatboys made this an Invoked Trope with their large sizes and their upbeat party-friendly music, including a collaboration with the Beach Boys.
-   Notorious B.I.G. occasionally showed this, especially with 'Juicy' his ode to just how much he loved the party lifestyle.
-   Lizzo, with her big size and infectious personality to match. Best known for her upbeat Self Empowerment Anthems.
-   George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher of Cannibal Corpse. Standing tall at 6'1, his long hair, shadowed eyes, and thick girth (and neck) makes him look like someone who's not to be fucked with. But he's also a _World of Warcraft_ player, a loving husband and father to his two daughters, and a Nice Guy overall.

    Myths & Religion 

-   As pictured (this particular statue is located by Emei Lake, Taiwan), Budai, also known as Hotei. He fits into both Japanese Shinto and Buddhist traditions, as he's one of the Seven Gods of Fortune in Japanese belief, but also considered to be an incarnation of the future Buddha Maitreya, who would appear in a dark age when the tenets of Buddhism are forgotten and nobody can reach enlightenment - a time where everyone needs a laugh, as you'd imagine. He's commonly mistaken for the mainstream Buddha (real name Siddhartha Gautama) by non-Buddhists, although it is true that he brings good luck if you rub his belly.
-   In Hinduism, Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of knowledge, is often depicted with a potbelly. He's also known for being jovial, fun-loving, and good-natured with a major sweet-tooth.
-   The Dagda of Celtic Mythology. Some religions regard their father gods as stoic, handsome loving figures. The ancient peoples of Ireland thought of theirs as a comical, singing, dancing, fat old guy with his rump hanging out of his trousers. And he is _awesome_.
-   Shinto goddess of merriment Ame-no-Uzume, a Big Beautiful Woman who loves to party and invented the strip-tease.

    Pinball 

-   The gambler in _High Roller Casino_ is a big, beefy Texan (complete with hat) who speaks very bombastically.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The "Traveling Face Enforcer" Haystacks Calhoun, as the title implies, was a beloved attraction for his honor and friendliness, as well as for his surprising athleticism considering he was 600lbs.
-   This was André the Giant's gimmick for most of his career, a big fun heavy drinker who would parade multiple fans around on his arms, that being the parts when he wasn't under the corrupting influence of Bobby Heenan.
    -   It wasn't just a gimmick. He actively cultivated this trope in Real Life too. Knowing that his acromegaly would kill him at a young age, he set out to have fun in his life while he was alive and make others happy too.
-   The National Wrestling Alliance cultivated such an image for Dusty Rhodes to contrast him with Ric Flair during their long running feud.
-   While wrestling in CMLL, Brazo De Plata's waistline steadily expanded to the point fans started calling him Súper Porky. Hearing this, Plata embraced the name and started adding more comedy to his matches, which ended up making him a special attraction. These traits would carry onto his daughter, Goya Kong.
-   Both All Japan Pro Wrestling and New Japan have had Yutaka Yoshie of the "air bag" suplex fame on their rosters. Initially his defining trait was his judo background, but after leaving the country for the German Catch Wrestling Association, he returned to Japan in 2000, having gained muscle and fat, becoming a pink clad sumo and a comedic counterpart to Hiroshi Tanahashi. He would later do similar with Steve Corino as Y2P–160 kg in Pro Wrestling ZERO1.
-   This was The Blue Meanie's gimmick for most of his career, especially when parodying Scott Hall as part of the "blue World order".
-   Koji Kitao became such after returning to puroresu via Wrestling Association R to atone for his past misdeeds as a sumo and as a pro wrestler, also forming an alliance with the similarly shamed joshi Shinobu Kandori. This lead to further investigation into his blackballing from Sumo, which allowed his official return to that sport too.
-   Rikishi, after he became the hip hop dancing sumo wrestler of Too Cool and gained a reputation for shaking his butt.
-   Montel Vontavious Porter formed the World's Strongest Tag Team for the purpose of defeating Chris Jericho, who was teaming with Big Show. But then Motive Decay set in as he spent more time trying to prove The Miz wrong, to prove his partner Mark Henry did in fact have personality. He was successful in getting Henry to open up and have fun at first but then the aforementioned Big Show tried to break Henry's leg, causing Henry to snap, resent the "personality" reveal and vow to destroy everything.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ has the Elysian dragons. These beings hail from the plane of pure Good, but have decided that since goodness is tied so closely to happiness, the best way to promote good is to eat, drink and make merry to excess. As such, one of their Breath Weapons is a cone of inebriating gas, and they overindulge on food and drink to the extent that they develop prominent guts despite their draconic metabolisms. Elysian dragons usually make their lairs close to other races' settlements, and live to ensure that they and those around them enjoy themselves as much as possible — as a consequence, Elysian dragons reproduce at a rate that other dragons find irresponsible, and sire more half-dragons than all the other extraplanar dragons combined.
-   _Grim Hollow_: Ogresh are a humanoid race known for being very obese (adults in the latter stages if their lives can reach up to seven-hundred pounds), and also being incredibly charming and likable. These go hand-in-hand: the Ogresh have such insanely large appetites that they rely on other species to survive. Ogresh are born with instincts that make them The Social Expert, so they can attach themselves to a community that can feed them, often getting positions as advisors and ambassadors.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy_ and _Warhammer 40,000_: Disturbingly used with followers of Nurgle, who are indeed fat (or morbidly obese) and jolly... and also evil to the core, devoted to spreading disease and pestilence everywhere they go. Nurgle himself is essentially _Santa Claus_ who truly loves all his followers; it's just that rats, vermin and bacteria are worthy of love too.

    Video Games 

-   There is a shown aversion in Stuart Black of the Campaign of _Age of Empires III_. It is said that fat men almost always show joy, but Stuart only shows cowardice.
-   Following his retirement from villainy and Heel–Face Turn in _Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time_, Dingodile has not only put on some extra pounds, but has become a lot more open and friendly than before, wanting nothing more than to run a successful diner in the bayou, and being on good terms with the Alternate Universe Tawna. Not to mention his Shipper on Deck antics with the two N. Tropys.
-   The borderline round Sasquatch from _Darkstalkers_. It's mostly fluffy fur, but he's got no major issues to deal with involving the other characters of the series. He enjoys making snowmen in the middle of a fight too.
-   The eponymous _Dave the Diver_ may be very rotund, but he's a pleasant guy who's willing to brave the dangers of the Blue Hole just to help his friends in need.
-   Forrest Kaysen of _Deadly Premonition_ is an enormous sapling salesman with an unfailingly jolly attitude and a friendly pet dalmatian. He's good with kids and becomes a steadfast ally in some of the game's later acts. Absolutely none of this means that he's _nice._ He isn't. He really, really isn't.
    -   Forrest Kaysen of _D4_ is a jovial Big Eater detective who helps out his former partner, David, in his work and everyday life. He is currently the most laid-back character in the game. Only time will tell if this will change.
-   In _Dragon Quest V_, Rodrigo Briscoletti is very fat and very jovial.
-   Lieutenant Amodar of _Final Fantasy XIII_ is a Reasonable Authority Figure from the seaside town of Bodhum who encourages Lightning to take some time off even in the middle of a suspiciously unpleasant string of events. _XIII-2_ also reveals that he's fond of quizzes and likes to spin a chaingun with a grin on his face.
-   Both Brom and his daughter Meg from _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_ are rather upbeat, cheerful country folk. Brom explains that the girth itself is rather useful for managing farm equipment.
-   _Grand Theft Auto_:
    -   Big Smoke in _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_. Sadly, just like Zeke below, Smoke ends up betraying you. But unlike Zeke, Smoke doesn't recover from it.
    -   Roman in _Grand Theft Auto IV_, whose chubby physique, optimistic outlook, and brash personality contrast with Niko's thin frame and more serious behavior.
-   Bobbie Grail in _Growing Up_ is a plus-sized woman who enjoys belting out her favorite showtunes with the Player Character. She doesn't like it when she's told to be quiet.
-   Zeke in _inFAMOUS_. By all accounts, a friendly, easygoing kind of guy. Sadly, his urge to become a superhero results in him betraying Cole later in the game. Thankfully, he recovers in the sequel, becoming a much better friend to Cole in the process.
-   Coach from _Left 4 Dead 2_, being the most level-headed member of the survivor team and serving as a middle ground in personality between Rochelle, Ellis, and Nick.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ has Daruk, the Goron Champion. A Boisterous Bruiser who laughs in the face of danger, he brings levity to almost any situation and will give back slaps and group hugs at the drop of a club.
    -   Most of the gorons from _The Legend of Zelda_ series as a whole would also qualify, besides a few of the more serious ones. For instance, in _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_, they are very welcoming to Link and eventually offer him a "goron hug", despite all of them being at least three times his size.
-   Fatman from _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_ would qualify, except for the detail that his idea of fun is blowing things up with bombs. Still great fun at parties if you check him for C-4 at the door.
    
    **Fatman:** _Laugh, and grow fat!_
    
-   While Reinhardt of _Overwatch_ isn't exactly fat, he _is_ both the largest character in the entire game (clocking in at 7'5") and the biggest Boisterous Bruiser in the cast, as well as a genuine Nice Guy.
-   Hala from _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ is a heavyset Cool Old Guy who is very friendly towards the player character and is a bit of a Boisterous Bruiser (for instance, he's shown riding on top of a Tauros like it's a surf board during the credits).
    -   In the same games, Mohn is an amnesiac castaway who's decided to turn the island chain he's stranded on into a Pokemon resort. He admits his size is from living on high-calorie Poke Beans.
-   The Wii version of _Punch-Out!!_ gives us returning challenger Bear Hugger, who, while easily one of the physically _widest_ and most rotund boxers to get in Little Mac's way, is also an entertaining, goofy Boisterous Bruiser with a big laugh, whose lines are pure comic gold, usually playing into his Canada, Eh? stereotype for all it's worth. He also seems to be in it for fun rather than harboring any serious thoughts of contending or being outright Ax-Crazy.
-   _Resident Evil Village_: One of Ethan's few allies in the game is the Duke, an amiable and very rotund man who serves as the game's merchant, providing Ethan with weapons, supplies, and information.
-   Mike from _River City Ransom: Underground_. He loves a brawl, always has a huge smile on his face and is always stuffing said face. His sprite actually has his belly poking out from under his shirt! His fighting style is even the most comedic and over-the-top of all the playable characters.
-   In _RuneScape_, the patron gorilla god of Ape Atoll turns out to be a fun-loving Hard-Drinking Party Girl, in contrast to her violently xenophobic simian followers.
-   E Honda in his various adaptations throughout _Street Fighter_ seems to have many friends and allies. Probably due to exactly how seriously he's taking the tournament. As of _Street Fighter IV_, he wants to join the IOC to make Sumo Wrestling an official Olympic sport, he has friendly-yet-serious wrestling matches with Hakan over whether Sumo or Turkish Oil Wrestling is the "better" sport, and he's more than happy to supply El Fuerte with his recipe for Chenko Stew.
-   Gordo the Round in _Skies of Arcadia_ starts off as a Fat Bastard, but he pulls a Heel–Face Turn, opens up his own gourmet restaurant, and becomes the game's Big Fun after he is defeated.
-   _Spyro the Dragon_: Some of the crystallized dragons are depicted this way in the _Spyro Reignited Trilogy_. Of note are Magnus, a jolly Large Ham with the physique of a sumo wrestler, and Maximos, a very heavyset dragon who cheerfully confides to Spyro about the best way to cook a vulture.
-   The Heavy of _Team Fortress 2_, at least to his own team. To everyone else, he's describable as "a big, shaved bear that hates people."
    -   And unlike most other examples of this trope, the Heavy is actually strong and very well capable of fending for himself.
-   Despite being a skeleton, Sans from _Undertale_ is rotund, and he normally enjoys pulling pranks and making puns.
-   The pandaren of _World of Warcraft_ and its _Mists of Pandaria_ expansion are an entire species of anthropomorphic pandas that love to eat, drink, and be friendly. They also practice kung fu, and the reason they're so jolly is because in Pandaria, negative emotions turn into demons.
    -   They also have a philosophy that the fatter you are, the stronger you are. To quote Chen: "Size equals strength" when his niece pointed out that he only liked being around a fatter panda because he looked thin in comparison. If you're familiar with Chen, he's definitely the WoW incarnation of Big Fun and Acro Fatic. Watch the cinematic where he kicks the ass of two very strong human and orc warriors, WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT. Using only the handle for a barrel of beer.
-   Miqol, father of Egil and Vanea from _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_ and the leader of the Machina, is the fattest (semi-)biological character in the game, being about the size of the world's biggest ball of twine, and he's incredibly friendly and forthcoming to the party, who all hail from the opposing continental Titan of Bionis.

    Web Comics 

-   Reagan from _Templar, AZ_. Besides being a BBW and the owner of a porn shop, she's probably the funnest of all the cast to be around.
-   Another female example is Jamie from _Girls with Slingshots_, a BBW who is as sweet, friendly, and helpful as she is... uh... boobs.
-   Dead Winter's Lou Panzetti is the local fat Italian-by-blood plumber, whom is as cheerful, chatty, friendly, kind and smart as he is overweight. He's got a lot of flab but he's got a lot of heart to match.
-   _El Goonish Shive_ has Jerry, who proclaims himself to be "a friendly, jolly fat guy \[...\] like Jackie Gleason, or Santa Claus" to reassure Grace about his benign intentions (unfortunately, Grace has never heard of Santa Claus).
-   Mooner, the "overweight party catalyst" from _Chainsawsuit_'s _Boner College_.
    
    **Mooner:** The fat makes me party way more and better.
    

    Web Original 

-   _ATTACK on MIKA_:
-   BFF Nella. She has issues, of course (mostly to do with being abused) but she's a lot happier than the more conventionally pretty, jerkass, Broken Bird Nostalgia Chick.
-   Both Jessica and Janel of _Fat, French and Fabulous_ qualify, and they spend most of the show cheerfully discussing death and dismemberment and joking back and forth.
-   Jon Jafari. Despite having been one half of Game Grumps he spends 70% of the show laughing, singing and being generally likeable and fun with his more reserved co-star Arin Hanson (Egoraptor).
-   Big Chungus, an awesome variation of Bugs Bunny. Also, he's not fat, but _thicc_.
-   _Eddsworld_: If the designs from the episode "Saloonatics" are canon, then Edd is both chubby and also enthusiastic and kindhearted (though he occasionally has moments where he acts like a jerk). It's worth noting that the real life Edd Gould (the show's creator and inspiration for the character of Edd) was this in real life too.
-   _Manic Pixie Dream Wife_: Chance is a big, fat, fun and fun-loving guy. Only occasionally he feels down... especially when his wife's antics become too much. And it turns out his work and life, in general, made him very depressed, and that's why Simone felt she needed to keep cheering him up and act her crazy and fun role-plays associated with manic-pixies.
-   Shaz from _Less is Morgue_ is one of the largest characters in the cast, and they're also a limitless font of bizarre energy and enthusiasm.
-   Queen Lilie from the _Britsune Garden Series_. She isn't very fat, but she's often described as being "plump". At the same time, she's often shown to be a Cool Old Lady (though she has her moments where she acts serious).
-   Professor Peter Port of _RWBY_ is a, well, portly old professor, as well as a Boisterous Bruiser and Cool Old Guy, whose lectures mostly consist of giving long-winded narrations about his youth hunting monsters, and giving some surprisingly deep advice to his students when they need it.

    Western Animation 

-   Both Flavio and Marita, the Hip-Hippos from _Animaniacs_. (Unfortunately, they're also Rich in Dollars, Poor in Sense, though they're also Nigh-Invulnerable so their antics never hurt them.)
-   Iroh from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ is a jovial and affable old man with a big belly. He's even funnier alongside his thinner and younger nephew, who takes everything seriously.
    -   Pipsqueak acts this way. The fact that he calls himself "Pipsqueak" should be proof enough.

-   In _The Legend of Korra_, Bumi is a boisterous, pot-bellied guy who serves as a Cool Uncle to Tenzin's kids. He's fitter than most examples, though, since he does seem fairly agile.

-   Kon Kujira from _Grojband_ is the largest and heaviest member of the band, but also a cheerful, energetic, and fun-loving goofball.
-   Referenced in _Family Guy_, when Peter angers Lois by commenting on her gaining weight;
    
    **Peter:** Geez, I thought you people were supposed to be jolly.
    
    -   Before Flanderization, Peter used to be Big Fun Jerk with a Heart of Gold, but now is just a Fat Bastard.

-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   The titular character, along with Cool Big Sis Amethyst. Both are very energetic and playful, as well as pretty chubby.
    -   Smoky Quartz, their fusion, takes it up to eleven. They have the biggest BMI out of the main cast and can't resist any opportunity to make a joke.
-   Homer Simpson from _The Simpsons_, at least to himself.
    
    **Homer:** Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt.  
    **Marge:** So?  
    **Homer:** There's only two kind of guys who wear those shirts: gay guys and big, fat party animals. And Bart doesn't look like a big, fat party animal to me...  
    **Marge:** So, if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?  
    **Homer:** Right. Thank you.
    
    -   Mr. Burns, of all people, is briefly this in "Guess Who's Coming To Criticize Dinner." During Homer's stint as a food critic, his blind love for all things food leads to a few Springfielders getting fattened up. The now obese Burns happily declares he's "never felt jollier" but his shins suddenly collapse again.
    -   Kent Brockman started a report on obesity by saying, "Americans have grown up with the image of the jolly fat man, Dom De Luise, Alfred Hitchcock, and, of course, Santa Claus. But in real life, Santa would be suffering from gall stones, hypertension, impotence, and diabetes."
-   Shiny from _Super Giant Robot Brothers!_ is a Humongous Mecha equivalent of the trope, in that he's boisterous and humorous.

-   Spud, a member of the original Titan Force Five in _Titan Maximum_. By the events of the first episode, he's been dead for a while — he fell off a 400-story building during a cocaine binge with a prostitute. That guy _really_ loved to party.

-   _Gravity Falls_ has Soos, the portly, fun-loving Manchild handyman at the Mystery Shack. He's almost always eager to join Dipper and Mabel in their hijinks, whether it's hunting for monsters or using Mabel's "bezazzler" to make him a human disco ball.
-   Sir Morris and Sir Boris from _The Big Knights_ count as this; the princesses' aunts Lily and Iris even more so, being even more jovial and boisterous distaff counterparts to the Big Knights.
-   In an episode of _The Critic_, Jay meets with an image consultant in an attempt to improve how people perceive him. At first, he thinks that the consultant will tell him to lose weight, but instead, he tells him he needs to be "round and jolly like Santa Claus or Rush Limbaugh." Jay takes the advice too close to heart and ends up about three times his original size! It turns out that Marlon Brando had the same image consultant.
-   Gene from Bob's Burgers is easily the zaniest of the three Belcher children, as well as the heaviest.
-   _Molly of Denali_: Grandpa Nat is just as energetic and fun-loving as his granddaughter, and, judging from his design, he appears to be a bit on the burly side.
-   _Work It Out Wombats!_: Amado on the portly side and he's very effusive and boisterous.

    Real Life 

-   Gabriel Iglesias is a perfect example. But he's not fat, he's "fluffy"!
-   Daniel Lambert. Despite having worked as a gaol-keeper, he is best described as a nice guy and a loved local figure. It helped that morbidly obese people weren't viewed as harshly in 18th/19th century England as they are now, but are rather regarded as marvels to be seen.
-   Benjamin Franklin is the quintessential American example. As a junior printer, though, he was in excellent shape from carrying large cases of heavy lead type.
-   U.S. President William Howard "Big Bill" Taft, known for his appetite and enormous size, was a man with impeccable morals. He was incredibly loyal (some might say blindly loyal) to his friends and his political party. One journalist wrote of him, "He seemed to me an American bison, a kind and gentle one." He was also known for throwing lavish and expensive banquets at the White House.
-   King Edward VII of the United Kingdom was fat and reputedly a Big Eater, yet he was a very competent ruler and one of the most popular Kings the British people had.
-   Andrew Zimmern, the bald and huge host of the show _Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern_. His usual approach to everything in life is with a smile and an optimistic attitude. He'll at least try a food, even if he finds it disgusting. He never gets outright angry or shows incredible disgust for anything. Not even the infamous durian, the only food he absolutely cannot eat (even after trying 3 times, he still couldn't swallow), was enough for him to straight up turn away from.
-   A lot of rappers seem to cultivate this image. Guys like The Notorious B.I.G.., Fat Joe, and Cee Lo Green (despite only being 5'5") are all pretty heavy and generally seem like the type of people who knew how to party.
-   Fitness guru Richard Simmons mocked this trope in his first self-help book, _Never Say Diet_, by way of a true-or-false quiz entitled "Are Fat People Jolly?" Basically, the reader was invited to choose whether or not certain health-related or societal consequences of being overweight were fun to deal with:
    
    Not getting into the college of my choice because of a weight problem is _jolly_.
    
    Dying twenty years earlier than necessary is _jolly_.
    
    Being passed over for a job for an equally-qualified candidate of ideal weight is _jolly_.
    

-   G. K. Chesterton was 6'4", weighed about 300 pounds, and had a famous love for nonsense, paradox, and whimsy.
-   This article noting the personality traits that cause weight gain are: being neurotic, being an extrovert, being open to experience, and agreeability. The last three are very jolly traits.
-   Downplayed with the late weatherman Willard Scott. He was 6'3'', pudgy, and certainly jovial, but most of the time he possessed a childlike naïveté and made friends easily. To the point where similarly Big Fun weatherman Al Roker made a joke about it in the 1995 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade: "We got 45 million people watching \[the parade\] at home\[...\] that's only about 8 more than Willard knows personally."
-   The antidepressant Mirtazapine, as a side effect, causes an increased appetite and as such people who are taking it often put on a decent amount of weight. Not exactly "fun", but antidepressants will usually make you more sociable, at least.
-   _**BRIAN BLESSED**_ has a reputation for both loudness and a generally good nature. While quite average in height at only 5'8", he is 250 pounds, most of that is muscle. He jokingly calls himself "a stunted giant" and once compared himself to a bearded gorilla. Though more soft-spoken and moderated in private, he fully understands that the public loves his Large Ham tendencies and he goes right along with it, complete with an infectious laugh and a voice that can only be described as 'distinctive.'
-   Jazz pianist _Fats Waller_ wasn't called that for nothing. He was also a man of impressive height (both fat, tall and jolly). He was surely one of the funniest and most likable guys to hang around with in Harlem during The Great Depression.

-   Guy Fieri has a persona of being a big cheerful goofball for his show _Diners, Drive-ins and Dives_, but other shows reveal that he's always had an enthusiastic goodnatured streak. Even when presented with food that isn't to his taste, he still goes for it and never talks down a host restaurant.
-   Jack Black certainly plays up this persona. Definitely a chubby guy, he comes off as a lovable, gregarious goof.
-   Steve Irwin was a bit on the burly side and was Fun Personified, taking great pride and joy in his work as an animal conservationist - a career that saw him come face-to-face with all manners of dangerous creatures, all of whom he faced with a big heart and a big personality.

-   Comedian Bert Kreischer certainly plays up this persona. A large guy at 6 feet with a prominent belly (even more visible since he's also a Walking Shirtless Scene), several bits in his standup are about him being quite the party animal, and sometimes even has drinks with his fans after shows.
-   Part of the reason why actors and crews loved working with Albert R. Broccoli on the _James Bond_ films was because he'd take them to shoot in exotic locales and make sure people enjoyed the experience. If things went wrong, he'd do what he can to cheer people up. For example, when everyone became miserable over bad food during the production of _The Spy Who Loved Me_, he first arranged for familiar treats to be trucked in from England. When the cargo arrived mostly stolen and spoiled, he cobbled together a large pot of spaghetti which was greatly appreciated and raised people's spirits.
-   Children's author and illustrator Tomie dePaola is remembered by those who knew and loved him — family, friends, colleagues, and the lucky fans who met him — as a big sweetheart, with a childlike sense of joy and a ready laugh. Around the late 90's and early 2000s, he put on a fair amount of weight<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , which added to his image as a true teddy bear of a man.
-   André the Giant liked having a good time and making sure those he considered friends were also enjoying themseves. Stories abound of André taking others on nights on the town and treating them to enormous meals and endless drinks<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . In his memoirs, Cary Elwes recalls André goading him into trying out an ATV (hurting himself in the process) and later following André on a pub crawl and struggling to keep up even though he was drinking regular-sized beverages while André was consuming _entire pitchers_.
-   Fat cats (as in literal ones, not rich corporate executives) are very popular due to their reputation as lazy yet adorable as well as a meme about "chonky" cats, or "chonks" for short. The Facebook group "THIS CAT IS C H O N K Y" was initially focused around these types of cats, although it has since become a general purpose cat appreciation group.
