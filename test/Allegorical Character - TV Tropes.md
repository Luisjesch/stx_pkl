_"We live in a world where even kings have vices. Well then we are the kings and we are your vice!"_

While some fictional characters are only meant to represent themselves, others are meant to represent something larger than themselves in order to make a point. The author uses this character to represent X, whether X is "Women," "Christians," "Atheism," "Illegal Aliens," "The Bush Administration," or even "You." It's the difference between "Oh, Bob just tripped over the cat again; he is such an idiot" vs. "Bob just tripped over the cat again; men are such idiots."

Sometimes characters are created to be this. Other times, an existing character is (either temporarily or not) drafted into the role by being written as the voice/face/advocate of (topic) for an episode. This can even happen outside of the official canon; in fact, the more this is used outside of the original work, the stronger the case may be for the character being an effective symbol of X.

Please note that the character in question may be a perfectly well-rounded and very much individualized character, but he is so closely linked to a certain concept, that he is often used allegorically as a way of talking about that concept (e.g. Superman and idealism).

If _all_ of the characters in the work are written this way, then you might just have a full-blown Allegory on your hands. It's also possible to have characters be this in-universe, particularly in a Mental World or in a World of Symbolism\-type of story.

When no extra meaning is intended by the creators, then it may be that you have Everyone Is Jesus in Purgatory—although adherents to Death of the Author would point out that just because the allegory wasn't intended, doesn't mean it isn't there.

## Other examples

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest_: There's Kouki Amanogawa. In a Deliberate Values Dissonance way. Kouki's views of "justice" (in a Good Feels Good way), The Needs of the Many (i.e. thinking of the group besides one's own individuality), bullying, and the use of Victim-Blaming aren't all that different from what most of Japanese society thinks and functions as, and showing the ugly sides of it.
-   _Record of Ragnarok_: Jack the Ripper represents the malice of humanity, best illustrated by the titles given to him by the announcer Heimdall (e.g., "The Darkest of Evils", "Humanity's Greatest Evil", etc.). The premise of Round 4 has him going against Heracles, whom the narrative clearly associates with justice. Lastly, the main character Brunhilde, besides describing Jack as "the most despicable scum in human history", has something to say about this.
    
    **Brunhilde**: Geir. What is the one thing that humanity excels above the gods in...? Do you know?  
    _\*Beat\*_  
    **Brunhilde**: It is... **malice**. The personification of that endless abyss shall bore into the soul of the most righteous god...
    
-   In _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Helios/Pegasus represents the personification of dreams and faith. Chibiusa is content to befriend him and keep their dreams pure, despite being tempted to do more. This is in contrast to Big Bad Nehellenia whose corrupted dreams include wanting to _own_ him.
    -   Nehellenia can be seen as the embodiment of childish nihilism. Her entire motive in _Stars_ is wanting to destroy Usagi's life, kidnap her friends and lover, and erase Usagi's daughter out of existence because she is deeply envious of the happiness Usagi has with her loved ones.
-   _Tomie_: Junji Ito has stated he wrote Tomie as a representation of his fears of emotionally manipulative women. She's also been noted as a stand-in for the cycle of abuse, representing a regenerating, cyclical force that was created as a result of her teacher committing statutory rape and getting her killed by accident. She haunts the world by relying on parasitic exploitation and driving innocents into either obsession or hatred, which both lead to their doom. Similar to real-life abusers, the most viable tactic for survival seems to be to ignore her.

    Art 

-   Charity was a popular character in paintings meant to be the Anthropomorphic Personification of her namesake. Artists like William-Adolphe Bouguereau made multiple portraits of the virtue, including one that highlights the difficulties of the demands of love while still glorifying it.
-   _Civic Virtue Triumphant over Unrighteousness_:
    -   The male figure itself is "Civic Virtue".
    -   The two female figures lounging by Civic Virtue represents "vice" and "corruption," being sirens who attempt to capture Civic Virtue, only to get trapped in their own nets.
-   _Dawn_ (William-Adolphe Bouguereau): The woman presented in the image is meant to represent the time of dawn.
-   Sandro Botticelli's _Fortezza_ is a regal and armored woman as an allegory of fortitude (_"Fortezza"_ in Italian).
-   _Nue Couchée_: The sculpture is a representation of the horrifying implications of the Male Gaze, of how it hurts women on so many levels. Specifically, by twisting their bodies in unnatural ways for the sole purpose of Fanservice; therefore dehumanizing women. Fitting, since the thing only barely looks like a person.
-   Many of the non-human characters in Naudline Pierre's paintings are meant to act as Anthropomorphic Personifications of different aspects of the main character on her spiritual journey.

    Comic Books 

-   _American Born Chinese_: Chin-Kee represents Jin's frustration with his Chinese roots and how he perceives the way other people, namely his white peers, perceive him because of them. Every year, he comes to Danny's school and ruins his life. No matter what Danny (Jin) does, he can't escape him, because Chin-Kee is part of him whether he likes it or not.
-   _Flex Mentallo_: In practice, the entire cast is allegorical to a variety of different concepts. The main ones are Flex Mentallo (who represents all that is pure and idealistic about superhero stories and innocent fantasies in general), Wally Sage (who stands for the many complexities of being both audience and author to art) and Lord Limbo (who stands for the enigmatic, transcendental nature of superhero fiction). Other prominent characters such as Lt. Harry (a all-purpose stand-in for the hapless citizens of superhero fiction and, by extension, regular humans outside of comics) and The Hoaxer (who gestures towards the impossibility of fully comprehending reality) are also examples, and it is part of the narrative's goal for the reader to navigate the allegories in the cast.
-   The DCU:
    -   Superman — This Character is the pinnacle of humanity's ideals and faith in humanity.
    -   Batman — This Character is the determination to stand up to injustice and always doing the right thing no matter the cost.
    -   The Joker — This Character is the epitome of madness incarnate.
    -   Harley Quinn — This Character is the representation of a toxic relationship and then breaking free of one.
    -   Wonder Woman — This Character is Women's Strength & Courage (often associated with Feminism).
    -   Queen Atomia — This Character is the dangers of nuclear experimentation.
    -   Darkseid — This Character is the representation of tyranny and oppression.
-   Marvel Universe:
    -   Captain America — This Character is The American Dream (and often the Dream's disconnect from modern American politics and social trends.
    -   Spider-Man — This Character is the will to overcome tragedy and strife.
    -   The Punisher — This Character symbolizes the will to kill criminals and other villains, despite the objections of the superhero community.
    -   Jean Grey — This Character is the representation of how absolute power can corrupt absolutely.
    -   _The Sentry_: A recurring enemy of Sentry, even appearing more than the Void, in the _Age of the Sentry_ mini is a villain named Cranio who has three brains. He always boasts of being three steps ahead of him and is a recurring figure in hallucinations. Given Sentry normally has three personalities in conflict with each other he might be a representation of Bob being his own greatest enemy and the greatest threat to others.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_: Peter B can be seen as a commentary on how it feels watching Peter's life get destroyed repeatedly as he never gets married to the woman he loves, and keeps dealing with the same problems as an adult that he did in his youth. It stops being as relatable as it did when he was in his teens or twenties, and starts just being depressing.
-   _Son of the White Horse_: The three main dragons, representing the evil side effects of technological progress. Certain interpretations of the source tales also view Fanyűvő and his brothers under the same light, especially in the versions where they're villains. The movie obviously adopts a different approach to their portrayal, but they're still walking mythological symbols rather than individual, fleshed-out characters.
-   _The Kidnapping of the Sun and the Moon_: The dragon can represent anything bad and the hero can symbolize humanity's strength to fight back and restore peace.
-   _NIMONA (2023)_: The Director is the living personification of paranoia and the horrible things it drives people to do. She seeks to destroy everything she doesn't understand or can't control because they scare her, and she's too scared to get close enough to learn how baseless her fears are.
-   In _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_, the Wolf bounty hunter may appear to be symbolizing "death", as he gives an appearance usually associated with The Grim Reaper - he has sickles, a black poncho with a hood, and a face mark that resembles that of a skull. The Wolf's defeat of Puss after the cat learns he is on his last life of nine works as a symbolic reckoning with mortality after a life of reckless danger. Defied when the Wolf reveals he _is_ Death. Not metaphorically, rhetorically, poetically, theoretically, or any other fancy way. He is Death straight up, and he's here to reap Puss early because the cat didn't value any of his previous lives.
-   _South Park: Joining the Panderverse_: Kathleen Kennedy is used as a representative for all of Disney and pretty much Hollywood in general (since that's how people treat her), the amount of control she has over the company being ridiculously exaggerated, and Cartman represents all obnoxious fans who do nothing but complain about the things they allegedly love and insist that "wokeness is ruining movies", he was said to have been single-handedly responsible for every piece of hate mail Kennedy received. The Big Bad was a fusion of the two to demonstrate the bitter cycle of doubling down the two create.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _A Nightmare on Elm Street_: Freddy Krueger is the embodiment of Generational Trauma. While Freddy was a child-killer when he was human, as a Nightmare Weaver he had since become Springwood's Dark Secret and the adults of the town have since tried to suppress the truth of his existence rather than confront it. At best, the adults ignore or gaslight the kids into thinking that Freddy is nothing more than a figment of their collective imagination. At worst, the adults will arrest, drug and/or institutionalize the kids (as was the case in _The Dream Warriors_ and _Freddy vs. Jason_), doing everything they can to control the kids while leaving them all the more helpless against him.
-   _The Dark Knight Trilogy_:
    -   The Joker is practically the face of Terrorism after the 9/11 attacks. After taking control of organized crime and murdering many of the criminals involved, the Joker turns to large scale terrorism, with all law enforcement agencies taking action. Certainly, the level of State of Emergency during the film's climax is very evocative of the 9/11 attacks. In fact, some commentators and authors have compared the premise of the film to the Global War on Terrorism.
    -   Bane from _The Dark Knight Rises_ seems to represent the idea of Revolution, particularly those that involve uprisings and armed rebellions. In fact, Bane's revolution in Gotham is explicitly designed to be evocative of The French Revolution. Some commentators and authors have even noted parallels with The Arab Spring.
-   _Game of Death_: The characters in the pagoda are this in the original version. One could ask if they spend all of their lives in the pagoda waiting for some challenger, however, they represent the formalized system of martial arts that Bruce Lee wanted to prove wrong. They are all beaten with some ease, however Kareem-Abdul Jabbar has an unknown fighting style that represents the highest level of martial arts.
-   _Grimcutty_: The titular monster is a personification or parental worry (and to a degree, mistrust of their children). It appears to attack children whose parents are worried about, often cutting them or harming them in such a way that justifies the worries of the parents, which in turn makes it more likely to appear to hurt the children further. The first child to be afflicted with it has his mother become so paranoid with the idea of him getting hurt that she eventually locks him up in a padded room.
-   _Manila in the Claws of Light_: Julio is a metaphor for the hand-to-mouth Filipino poor, who are kept in hopeless situations by those in power and can only respond with either patience or small-scale violence.
-   Godzilla himself started in _Godzilla (1954)_ as an allegorical character representing the Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the destruction caused. His flesh was designed to resemble the keloid scarring of the hibakusha, and footsteps were deliberately made to sound like explosions.
-   The Three-headed Knight from _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ can be seen as a Take That! towards bureaucracy. The body of the knight can only act once all three heads agree. But by that time, new developments have taken place that render their previous agreement useless. In this case, Sir Robin appeared, causing the Three Headed Knight to argue how to deal with him. But after reaching an agreement, Robin already left. Likewise, a large company or institution might run into trouble adapting to new technological advancements or other societal developments. When the administration of said company or institution finally decided how to deal with said developments, other developments have already taken place.
-   In many films about the _RMS Titanic_, a handful of named characters take up traits, quotes or actions of different people onboard, to avoid having to spend time with lots of characters. Sometimes fictional characters are used to avoid Historical Villain Upgrade.
-   _X-Men Film Series_:
    -   Across the First Class trilogy, Professor X represents empathy, and depending on the story, he can also be a figure of peace, hope or love. For _X-Men: First Class_, he's emblematic of serenity, and without his participation during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the planet would've plunged into World War III (no Charles = no peace). For _X-Men: Days of Future Past_, his 1973 self must regain hope, otherwise by 2023, mutantkind is doomed to extinction (a hopeless past Xavier = a hopeless future for mutants). For _X-Men: Apocalypse_, his love is the only thing that can conquer fear (Jean Grey's trepidation over her Phoenix Force disappears when she senses the utmost trust the Professor has in her), hate and anger (the last two are felt by Magneto, but once he recalls how much he loves his old friend, he betrays Apocalypse); in this case, Charles = The Power of Love.
    -   Furthermore, Xavier's emotional state is a metaphor for America's mindset during the time period these movies depict. In 1962, the character's optimism is an extension of the hopeful outlook President Kennedy's administration tended to exude, whereas Charles' melancholia in 1973 is not unlike the general malaise American citizens felt while under the shadow of The Vietnam War. Xavier's descent into despair began in 1963, which is the same year Kennedy was assassinated—the end of "Camelot"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  parallels the end of Professor X's school. At least in the Alternate Timeline, Charles starts to piece himself together again shortly after the Paris Peace Accords are signed. The '80s in the USA was an era of excess and materialism (both were regarded as not just acceptable, but _desirable_), so Xavier's vanity is at its peak in 1983, and we get to see much more of his lavish estate and everything he owns within its boundaries. The combination of his smug demeanour, dressing like he had just stepped off the set of _Miami Vice_, and driving around in a gorgeous, well-maintained vintage car announces to everyone that "I'm beautiful, I'm rich, and I love it."
-   _The Thief_: Toljan clearly symbolizes Josef Stalin. The Stalin tattoo on his chest is the most obvious sign. Katya and Sanya represent the Russian people, looking for a father figure/protector, meekly submitting and accepting his crimes as the Russian people submitted to Stalin.
-   _Pan's Labyrinth_
    -   Captain Vidal is fascism incarnate, in his obsessions with complete control of every aspect of his life, in securing a son only to carry on his name, and then dying a glorious death.
    -   According to del Toro, the Pale Man represents the Catholic Church, which was highly complicit in Spanish fascism at the time the movie takes place. There is also the part about him sitting at a table loaded with all sorts of delicious food that he does not eat, but will kill and consume anyone who takes as much as an apple.

    Literature 

-   Bruno in _The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas_ is meant to represent a naive Germany unaware of the actions of Nazis.
-   The Garden of Eden atop _Dante's Purgatorio_ is littered with people who represent moral and religious concepts, some falling under Anthropomorphic Personification and some being too weird to fall under a specific sub-trope:
    -   The twenty-four elders with wreaths on their head represent the books of the Old Testament of The Bible.
    -   The four green animals with six wings each and many eyes represent The Four Gospels.
    -   Two elders appear in together, one being a doctor to represent Luke's Acts of the Apostles and the other a swordbearer to represent Saint Paul's letters.
    -   Four humble men who follow without comment represent the writers of the lesser epistles.
    -   At the end of the parade, an old man who looked as if he was asleep advances, representing the Book of Revelation.
-   _Noli Me Tangere_ and _El Filibusterismo_ has characters portraying the status of the Philippines and its people during its colonial era.
-   Atlantis in the dialogues of Plato, _Timaeus_ and _Critias_. Atlantis was an empire that embodied everything Plato saw as flaws that an ideal nation state should avoid. This is why despite all of Atlantis' power it still ultimately is unable to overcome Athens and sinks beneath the seas.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In episode He's Alive, Hitler is the literal manifestation of hatred and prejudice, with his return being only possible when Peter attempts to revive the Nazi movement in his city. Once Peter is killed at the end of the episode, Hitler simply returns to the shadows to seek out another Neo-Nazi. As Ron Serling puts it, Hitler is alive and immortal so long as people continue to practice hatred and prejudice.
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_'s Freudian Trio:
    -   Kirk: Leadership
    -   Spock: Logic
    -   McCoy: Emotion
-   _Star Trek: Discovery_: President Laira Rillak's a perfect representation of the problems that the Federation has always faced, in that she preaches about unity and goodwill in public, but in private she’s The Needs of the Many (even if Jerkass Has a Point about Michael’s trauma) and concerned with military prowess and getting everyone in under the Federation again.
-   In _Jessica Jones (2015)_, Kilgrave is pretty much the personification of stereotypically masculine vices, often associated with rape, entitlement, and negative aggression.
-   _Doctor Who_: The Skithra from "Nikola Tesla's Night Of Terror" are a distillation of all of Thomas Edison's flaws with none of his redeeming qualities - They both exploit inventors like Tesla for their own benefit, but unlike the merely-less-prolific Edison, the Skithra don't create anything at all.
-   _The Boys (2019)_
    -   Vought International is an allegory for modern-day commercialism. Vought International has no integrity and is content to turn a blind eye to Supe misdemeanors and outright deaths because the supes are too valuable and profitable an asset to see locked behind bars and will use corporate intervention to either silence witnesses or throw money at the problem to ensure it stays away. Vought will only publically condemn the problem to pay lip service and have no issues with ignoring the problem altogether behind closed doors. As shown with Compound-V and Soldier Boy, Vought has the power to make a difference but would rather use their power to make money than do anything practical.
    -   Homelander embodies the dark underbelly of America by voicing its most controversial standpoints, i.e. the America First policy, hypermasculinity, religious fundamentalism, reproductive rights, and the war on terror. His name is based on Homeland Security, and he even wears a cape in the style of the American flag with eagle imagery on his costume, and while he is picky enough to curl up his cape when he sits so as not to sit on the American flag, it becomes drenched in the blood of his victims on more than one occasion.
    -   Soldier Boy’s pretty much the physical embodiment of toxic masculinity and the US military.
        -   As the embodiment of toxic masculinity, Soldier Boy matches the criteria for the stereotypical Manly Man, i.e. has a beard, hot-blooded, muscular, and stoic, but these traits are shown to be unhealthy. His hot-bloodedness makes him aggressive and abusive toward his teammates in Payback, he discriminates against the non-whites and non-heterosexuals, he's sexist and misogynistic, and his bottled-up emotions are now symbolically expressed through nuclear blasts whenever his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is triggered by a Russian song called "Escape".
        -   As the embodiment of the US military, Soldier Boy is one of the most powerful and influential forces in the world, but he accidentally kills innocent people with nuclear explosions and then acts like he’s the good guy for the most part. Homelander's response to the danger he represents also mirrors the Trump Administration's "nothing to see here" response to the then-emerging COVID-19 pandemic.
    -   Supes: The supes in the series are used as a critique of celebrity culture, namely the greed for fame, how their egos outpace their capabilities, and how their misdeeds are usually covered up through corporate intervention.
    -   Blue Hawk's the embodiment of police brutality and his costume resembles a motorcycle police officer's uniform. While Blue Hawk insists that his actions aren't racially motivated, he displays police brutality by revealing that he's quick to anger, relies on lying to save himself from the consequences of his actions, and has no qualms using his powers on unarmed black civilians. He's also believed to be based on George Zimmerman.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Todd, the new husband of the ex-wife of Mother's Milk, personifies people who peddle baseless conspiracy theories and blindly follow people with personality cults built around them. In Todd's case, he's an overzealous fan of Homelander who tries to push his beliefs onto his stepdaughter Janine, which disturbs her father Marvin who _has_ seen what Homelander is really like. He also follows the baseless conspiracy theory that Starlight is sex trafficking children, which he got from the Homelander rally he brought his stepdaughter to, one that is reminiscent of Trump rallies. Notably, at the end of the Season 3 finale, he has become so devoted to supporting Homelander that he is the first person who cheers after the supe executes a protestor in broad daylight.
-   _Don't Hug Me I'm Scared_: Warren the Eagle's the embodiment of intrusive thoughts and insecurities. Warren feeds Yellow Guy's fears that Red Guy and Duck hate him and he literally crawls into Yellow Guy's brain and ruins his happy place. After removing him from Yellow Guy's head, Red Guy and Duck sing about how everyone has a worm in their brain that tells them negative and upsetting things (such as how Red Guy can't wear denim and that Duck is responsible for many deaths after forging documents) and they should be ignored.
-   _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_: In episode The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 7 this is discussed, while trying to make a new villain, Dennis explains why they chose Karen White. According to Dennis, entitled white women are the only group they can vilify for their movie but the gang finds her too "cunty" for their movie and decide to switch Karen with a flood to avoid controversy. Instead, they now find the character unlikable and eventually make "Don Cheadle" the director, who turns the film into a documentary about white saviors.
-   _Just Beyond_: In episode "My Monster", The Squeember is a physical representation of stress and anxiety.
-   _Kamen Rider Outsiders_: The AI Zein is a cautionary tale for authoritarianism taken to the most logical and terrifying extremes: abuse of power, stifling individuality, forced compliance, fearmongering through gaslighting, surveillance, and violence, and the ability to evade accountability due to being an artificial intelligence, by using someone as a scapegoat to take the blame for its actions.

    Music 

-   While at first Eminem's Slim Shady character was a way to express his Hair-Trigger Temper, self-loathing and desire to say things to piss people off, Eminem claimed that as time went on, he began to imagine Slim as the personification of his own fame. This is especially apparent in "When I'm Gone", where Slim kills himself in order to become Marshall again (allegorising how Eminem needed to step out of the spotlight for the sake of his own mental health), and in his Career Resurrection album _Relapse_, a Concept Album where Slim's murder rampages serve as an allegory both for the life-destroying effects of fame, and for the way that fame pushes people into the clutches of drug addiction.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Magic: The Gathering_ the ancient sphinx Azor represents colonialism, specifically the conceit that it's done to benefit the colonized — he travels between planes remaking their governance into what he considers to be perfect, orderly systems, and when chaos and suffering result because of his interventions he blames the people for failing to live up to his designs.
    
    **Azor:** I _**fixed**_ this plane—  
    **Vraska:** This plane was never broken!
    

    Theater 

-   _Cesare - Il Creatore che ha distrutto_ has Angelo, a Florentine commoner who befriends Cesare Borgia at school. As his name implies, he's angelic, and often represents a more pure view of the situation than what occurs to the other characters, who are used to the Crapsack World of politics in 15th-century Italy. As soon as Cesare hears his name, he sings a song about how it means "Angel", and that leads him to think about how far the Vatican is from the purity it should have. Angelo also isn't afraid to challenge upper-class characters on their views — Cesare himself doesn't mind a little _disputatio_ in the classroom, but others aren't so nice. Cesare ends up having to rescue Angelo quite a few times until the end where Angelo returns the favor, stepping in front of a dagger for Cesare.
-   Medieval morality plays tended to feature a character called the Vice, who was a personification of a sin, such as Covetousness, Lust, or Gluttony. While originally played for drama, the Vice was eventually played for comedy and tended to be the most popular character in the play.
-   In _A Street Car Named Desire_, Blanche is the classical antebellum south that's dying away, and Stanley is the new, more industrial south that's emerged since the then-recent end of World War 2. Neither of them are exactly sympathetic.

    Web Comics 

-   In _Three Jaguars_, the three jaguars are in fact personalities facets of the artist/writer.
-   In _Koan of the Day_, every single one of the characters is allegorical.

-   _The Homestuck Epilogues_: Fitting the fanfiction metaphor, the narrators for both timelines represent the kind of authors that write it:
    -   Ultimate Dirk is the fan that writes Darker and Edgier and canon-compliant fics, mixing Fanon Discontinuity with Start My Own when the work they like heads in a direction they don't agree with.
    -   Muse Calliope is the fan that enjoys writing fluff, AU, and shipping fics, even if the results are out of character. Despite being in control of a universe they "know" isn't the real deal, they still see it as just as living as the true universe.
-   _Supermarioglitchy4's Super Mario 64 Bloopers_: Lawyer Kong acts as a living embodiment of Nintendo's obsessive compulsive enforcement of their copyrighted properties. He even goes so far as erecting a firewall that separates Nintendo-owned characters from SMG4's characters alongside third-party characters and maintaining the family-friendly facade by force.
