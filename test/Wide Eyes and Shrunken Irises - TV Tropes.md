**Calvin:** What do you do, wait until you see the whites of my eyes?!  
**Hobbes:** Boy, you should've _seen_ them! They were as big as dinner plates!

A good sign that a character is absolutely terrified is if their eyes are bulging wide open and the irises and pupils are visibly shrunken, or even absent. This gives the impression that the character is screaming inwardly, even if they're speechless with shock. It comes across as striking and, if done well, can even be scary. Often a warning sign that the character is about to freak out. May also involve Tears of Fear.

Can also happen if a character is badly injured, with bonus points if the scene cuts away to a Scream Discretion Shot. On the flip side, it can also be used when a character is very, very angry.

A very minor case of Artistic License – Biology: while the _pupil_ inside the iris can indeed shrink due to fear, the iris itself does not. Regardless, most artists consider it an Acceptable Break from Reality (see Open the Iris for reasons why).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Frequently overlaps with Oh, Crap!. In Anime, this may be replaced with Blank White Eyes instead.

Contrast Open the Iris, the trope's physical opposite. If this effect only happens to one eye and not the other, it's a case of Mad Eyes. Not to be confused with Sphere Eyes, which always look like dots. Nor has this anything to do with a Wide-Eyed Idealist.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Happens on a regular basis in the _Bleach_ anime, usually when one character is impressed by another character's power/abilities.
    -   And Arisawa does this in chapter 410 when Aizen states he intends to kill her and draws his blade.
-   Most _Code Geass_ characters do this, resulting in some pretty disturbing faces.
-   Early in _Doraemon: Great Adventure in the Antarctic Kachi Kochi_, Doraemon had this expression after hearing Nobita's suggestion to build their own amusement park on an iceberg.
-   Most characters on _Higurashi: When They Cry_ do this when they're really scared, but Satoko has a habit of giving particularly haunting moments. One of these is Satoko's reaction to Keichii standing by her best friend's corpse in _Tatarigoroshi-hen_. Satoko freaks out, believing that Keichii was responsible, and while doing so, gives a picture perfect demonstration of the trope. Her reaction upon getting out of the river and returning to her school and finding her friends dead elicits this reaction from her as well, and it is also the expression her classmates are wearing. Gives a truly ghoulish impression. Keichii does it a few times as well.
    -   It's also used fairly often to show a character is going Ax-Crazy, to the point that most instances of Nightmare Face in the series include this.
-   Occurs often in _One Piece_\- in Oda's art style, the shrunken irises are often split into two half-circles with a tiny dot in between for the pupil.
    -   Most others get a mix between anger and fear, but Luffy's is almost always rage when this happens.
        -   This notably happens only for the male characters. The female characters (and sometimes Chopper) avert this trope, because even though their eyes widen, their irises (which gain thicker outlines) and pupils stay the same size. In addition, their irises become white (only in the manga. In the anime, their irises gain a lighter shade of their regular eye color) and lose their shine. For example, here's an image of a very angry Nami.<small>◊</small>
-   _Pretty Cure_:
    -   _Futari wa Pretty Cure_: Nagisa and Honoka, realizing there's a monster behind them.
    -   _Futari wa Pretty Cure Splash★Star_: Saki, freaking out about Flappy's glowing ears, and later in the same episode, realizing that she's about to have her favourite meal, hamburger curry.
    -   _Fresh Pretty Cure!_: Tarte, realizing that Love's mother has spotted him.
    -   _HeartCatch Pretty Cure!_: Sasorina, shocked at Tsubomi's transformation into Cure Blossom.
    -   _Suite Pretty Cure ♪_: Hummy, realizing the Notes are missing.
    -   _Smile PreCure!_: Played for Drama: All five Cures, when Joker's influence gets the better of them and they become engulfed by Bad Energy.
    -   _Doki Doki! PreCure_: Ai-chan, upon hearing Mana's comically bad singing.
    -   _KiraKira★Pretty Cure à la Mode_: Ichika, freaking out when running into Himari.
    -   _Star★Twinkle Pretty Cure_: Prunce, after eating a jalapeno and realizing how hot it is.
    -   _Tropical-Rouge! Pretty Cure_: Manatsu, getting way too excited about exploring the city.
    -   _Hirogaru Sky! Pretty Cure_: Sora and Mashiro, realizing how close the Sky Jewels really are.
-   Inverted by Maka and sometimes Black☆Star in _Soul Eater_; their pupils are invisible unless they're particularly shocked or angry. Everyone else in the series plays this straight.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ has some moments with this trope, especially when Shinji freaks out in End of Evangelion, upon seeing Asuka's dismembered Eva Unit . Epic Freak Out ensues, and again shortly after upon seeing the Giant Naked Rei/Lilith.
-   _Shaman King_ characters tend to do this, along with sporting white-colored irises for that instant.
    -   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ also has this happen both with human and Beastmen characters. In both series, this usually happens when someone is really shocked, horrified or furious. Simon ends up Locked into Strangeness after Kamina dies, with his eyes in a constant state of this combined with them turning white.
-   The OEL Manga _My Cat Loki_ features this whenever the titular cat Loki is scared.
-   Part of an Oh, Crap! moment for the villain of _Domu_ by Katsuhiro Otomo. Reaches epic levels insofar as it is a silent panel the size of an entire two-page spread.
-   In _My Hero Academia_, All Might himself develops these after hearing from All For One that Tomura Shigaraki is the grandson of All Might's mentor; Nana Shimura. What follows is All Might suffering a huge Heroic BSoD during the fight.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Since most of Kakashi's face is permanently hidden (usually just the one eye is left clear), this is what allows us to notice he's having an Oh, Crap! moment.
    -   Naruto himself gets a noteworthy set of these when Hinata gives him her Anguished Declaration of Love just before almost getting killed by Pain. Notable in that they are not momentary; he is so shocked, he has them for the ENTIRE SCENE. And then he, quite understandably, goes berserk. Oh boy, _does he_.
-   In _Death Note_, Light does this several times - most noticeably after he realizes the titular notebook is for real.
    -   Also, Light gets them when he's starting to go insane.
    -   Mello also does this all the time.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_ already has most characters displaying proportionately small irises/pupils, but when they're frightened or under stress, their pupils shrink to pinpricks &/or go white.
    -   As a side note, Super Saiyans lack pupils, arguably, this makes them _really_ scary.
-   In _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_, we have Quattro(see the anime image for Oh, Crap!), who has a very good reason to be terrified.
-   Edward Elric does this a lot in _Fullmetal Alchemist_.
-   Accelerator of _A Certain Magical Index_ does this quite a lot (because of his insanity) but the most prominent is when Amai Ao is about to shoot him in the head and he knows he won't be able to deflect it.
-   Most _Fairy Tail_ characters inverts this for their pupils are usually invisible unless shocked or angry.
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_, it happens to Relena when Heero raises his gun to her at the end of Episode 2. Of course, she's saved from his Ineffectual Death Threats by a Duo Ex Machina.
-   Saionji does this in _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ during a duel, not to indicate fear or shock, but focus on defeating his opponent. The quick shift makes him appear deranged and potentially murderous.
-   _Future Diary_:
    -   Yuno Gasai has some horrifying examples in the anime version. Bonus points when she's smiling or laughing maniacally.
    -   Also in the anime version, Marco Ikusaba sports a pair of these in his backstory. A perfectly understandable reaction to witnessing your girlfriend being gang-raped.
-   This happens on occasion in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_, such as when Germany sees that the invading aliens have rendered his tanks useless in The Movie.
-   In _Digimon Tamers,_ Guilmon is a childlike, friendly dinosaur Mon. He's also _crazy_ powerful by Rookie-level standards<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and when in a battle mindset can be feral and scary even to his friends. The signal that you should stop d'awwing over him and get out of his way in a _big_ hurry is when his pupils suddenly shrink to pinpoints.
-   An understandable reaction<small>◊</small> from "Speed O' Sound" Sonic running junk-first into the fist of the titular _One-Punch Man_ in the anime. Yes, it's Sonic's fault because he's the belligerent loony while Saitama comes off as sharp as his smooth, bald head.
-   Popuko of _Pop Team Epic_ naturally has wide eyes, but when she gets angry (which happens very easily), her irises shrink to the size of periods.
-   Happens to Vicious in the _Cowboy Bebop_ episode "The Real Folk Blues (Part 2)" when Spike shoots him during their final duel.
-   Shinji in the 2010 movie adaptation of _Fate/stay night_ sometimes looks like he crept his way straight out of the _Higurashi_ anime. Not surprising, since both are Studio DEEN productions.
-   In the animated short _Sonic: Night of the Werehog_, a tie-in to _Sonic Unleashed_, when Sonic notices the full moon, the camera pans in close to his eyes, and we get a shot of his pupils shrinking in both fright and shock... you know, before the painful transformation into a werehog kicks in.
-   In the first chapter of the _Asteroid in Love_ manga, Ao gets this when the other new member says she wants to find an asteroid. Downplayed when it is adapted in the first episode of the anime, when her irises only shrinks a little when that other member's companion calls her "Mira". This is a benign example, however; the reason Ao gets this is because she had The Promise of "finding an asteroid together" with _this_ Mira many years ago, but soon parted due to her family Really Moves Around.
-   In _Sgt. Frog_, this is Tamama's default expression whenever someone pisses him off.
-   In a flashback of _Kotoura-san_, this is used to show Yuriko's horror when she found her mother Driven to Suicide.
-   In _Kill la Kill_, Ryuko Matoi has this reaction when Nui Harime, whom she literally just met, reveals that she owns the other half of Ryuko's Scissor Blade, and is by proxy the one who murdered Ryuko's father, Isshin Matoi. She also gets the absolutely _pissed_ version of this, coupled with a furious scream of _**"YOU BITCH!!!"**_, when she flies into an Unstoppable Rage towards Nui in response to this revelation. And it is _terrifying_ to behold.
-   In _Soreike Anpanman_, Baikinman does this when in shock, and his irises can become particularly small. You almost can't even see them!

    Comic Books 

-   Qwackerjack in the _Darkwing Duck_ comic, after the Crimebots mention Negaduck.
-   Shadowcat busts this expression out for a full four panels in _X-Men Forever_ after Wolverine, who is supposed to be dead, ends up impaling her with his bone claws from the back.
-   In a _Ghost Rider_ tie-in to _World War Hulk_, Doctor Strange gets these when the Ghost Rider spirit takes over from Johnny Blaze. Blaze might have defeated the Hulk and saved the Illuminati, but the Ghost Rider decides Hulk is in the right and rides away.
-   This happens in Godzilla Rulers of Earth when Godzilla sees a Destoroyah juvenile kill a man in front of him.
-   As noted in the Page Quote, this happens to Calvin frequently when Hobbes attacks him.
-   _Captain America_ villain Zaran showed an exaggerated version of this once, i.e., with no irises<small>◊</small>.

    Fan Works 

-   In _The Apprentice, the Student, and the Charlatan_, Nova Shine does this when Twilight confesses her love to him. He has crippling Commitment Issues, and had been trying to keep her at arm's length while he sorted his own feelings for her, causing him to freak out.

-   In _Glitter Force: Into the Glitterverse_, Cure Moonlight gets these after Joker, whom she had previously brutally murdered, has been brought back to life, and is not very pleased with her.
-   _Pokémpanions: Growing Apart_: Carla gets this reaction when she's told she's betrothed to her school bully Carnivine.
-   _Sword Art Online Abridged_ makes good use of this trope, along with other eye animation edits, to spice up character interactions.
    -   In Episode 5, a whole crowd of players planning a raid (with the exception of Asuna) reacts this way when Kirito walks off-screen to "say hi" to an NPC who doomed his guild.
    -   Kirito prior to his Character Development is sometimes seen with this expression, but not for the usual reasons. If his eyes are like this, especially if combined with a grin and/or laughter, it's a clear sign that someone has pressed a Berserk Button and is about to regret it.
    -   In Episode 14, Leafa ends up with this when Kirito belatedly introduces himself, and she realizes that the player she just spent an evening roleplaying with - and who she complimented for his "sweet patootie" - was her hated older brother.

    Films — Animated

-   Darla Dimple in _Cats Don't Dance_ does this at the end when she sees that her attempt at sabotaging Danny's show actually _improved_ it.

-   Scar in _The Lion King (1994)_ does this shortly before he is eaten by hyenas. Simba did it, too... just before a stampede rains down on him.
-   Mr. Potato Head in _Toy Story_ does this right before RC slams into him. Other characters in the movie do this (notable being Woody)
-   Stinky Pete from _Toy Story 2_ does these eyes when Buzz and the gang flash him with cameras and when Woody points to a young girl's backpack for his friends.
-   Happens in _Monsters, Inc._ when Mike and Sulley see Boo running through the restaurant.
-   _Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas_ :
    -   Mickey Mouse does this during the Disaster Dominoes sequence of Pluto wrecking his decorations.
    -   Louie does it during the "Mission: Impossible" Cable Drop, then all three nephews have this before crashing into a cartload of Jailbreak Bobs.
-   Happens to Mickey Mouse in _Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers_ when he is trapped in a dungeon that begins to flood and fully realizes the danger he is in when he sees an inscription high up on the wall reading "You Must Be This Tall to Survive This Dungeon".
-   In _Help! I'm a Fish_, Fly's eyes do this just as a crab slashes one of its claws at him and slices his side open.
-   A rare realistic depiction in _ParaNorman_. Norman gets a vision of the famous witch trial of Blithe Hollow, in the position of the accused. Norman tries to defend himself, until he hears someone behind him, crying. His irises narrowing<small>◊</small> in shock is a nice touch to The Reveal that the "witch" was a little girl who talked to ghosts.
-   Happens to Goofy himself in _An Extremely Goofy Movie_, after he takes a considerable fall in his daydream and hits the pavement _hard_.
-   In _Aladdin and the King of Thieves_, this was the giant turtle island's reaction when Genie entered inside it as a distraction.
-   In _Oliver & Company_, Bill Sykes shows these eyes just before he gets killed by an oncoming train.

    -   Miriam, Priya, and Abby, seeing Mei's panda form for the first time.
    -   Mei, realizing that Stacy had caught her in her panda form (and Stacy, reacting to Mei's panda form).
    -   Mei, realizing that Tyler had put up embarrassing posters of her crush on Devon all over the school.
    -   Tae-young in the closing photo of all the cast together, when Abby jumps on his back.
-   Pinocchio does this when he discovers that Lampwick has turned into a donkey and then starts to turn into a donkey himself.
-   _The Bad Guys (2022)_: The Big Bad of the film, Professor Marmalade has an absolutely priceless reaction of this sort when Mr. Snake blows up Marmalade’s mansion with the Love Meteor, proving Marmalade stole the meteor and embezzled his own charity funds and outing Marmalade to everyone as the manipulative conniving schemer that the character truly is.
-   _All Dogs Go to Heaven_: Charlie has these after Itchy, having seen him get hit by a car earlier that night, screams in his face.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   It occurs in _¡Three Amigos!_ during the duel between Ned Nederlander and that German guy.
-   _Psycho_: Marion Crane's eyes do this, though in an Artistic License – Biology moment.
-   This happens to Jessica Rabbit in _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, in the only scene where you really get a good look at both her eyes ("Oh my God, it's DIIIIIIP!"). And, indeed, her face looks more childlike (symbolizing her fundamental fear of Dip), and loses its more mature look, much like how many other toons do when faced with an instinctual fear. Judge Doom also has this look when he sees the Dip nozzle pointed at him was just turned on.
-   Happened in the American version of _The Ring_ with a very good close up of Rachel's eyes when viewing the cursed tape for the first time.
-   _The Great Muppet Caper_: At the end of the "Happiness Hotel" number, Gonzo takes a picture, and the flash from the camera leaves everyone, even Muppets who normally don't _have_ eyes, in this state from being blinded.
-   In _Muppet Treasure Island_, Captain Smollet (Kermit) eyes bulge and get tiny irises as he grabs Benjamina Gunn (Miss Piggy) and keeps her from plummeting off a cliff. In this case, it's less from fear and more from the physical strain of catching and holding up a pig twice his size — and all the more jarring because he's a puppet whose eyes otherwise don't change _at all_.
-   It's an easy to miss moment in _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_, but it's done by Elizabeth when she first sees the crew of the Black Pearl under the moonlight.
-   This happens to the animated Cruella DeVil in the video game Roger made in the live action _101 Dalmatians (1996)_ movie when a keg of dynamite is thrown at her.
-   Large Marge's Nightmare Face from _Pee-wee's Big Adventure_.
-   _Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory_: Mrs. Teavee gets this look when her son, Mike, attempts to travel via Wonkavision.

    Literature 

-   In _Dragon Bones_, Oreg, who is magically bound to Ward, gets increasingly uncomfortable when Ward is too far away. After they have been separated for a considerable amount of time, Oreg's pupils are described as "small as the points of needles", and he's in a state of shock.
-   _Summer Knight_: Upon being told that a man named Ronald Reuel was murdered, Bob the Skull's Glowing Eyelights of Undeath shift from candleflames to pinpoints.
-   _Go to Sleep (A Jeff the Killer Rewrite)_:
    -   Randy taunting "If I knew this emo lookin' fucker was going to be like this I would've pushed him instead." pushes Jeff into a trance-like state of rage. He stops suddenly in his tracks and his change in expression is described as "eyes widened, as his pupils and irises appeared to shrink."
    -   Some drawings show characters with widened eyes and shrunken pupils in moments of shock, or otherwise in Jeff's case. Randy and his gang wear the same horrified reaction when they accidentally burn Jeff alive. As Jeff's sanity weakens, his smile looks manic as his pupils get smaller, which eventually carries into his Slasher Smile. When Liu discovers Jeff's bloody smile, he has the same shrunken irises as his brother, but from terror instead of insanity.

    Music 

-   Murdoc is seen sporting these in the Gorillaz' music video for "The Lost Chord," as him and the rest of the band watch from a lighthouse as Plastic Beach crumbles down around them. Understandable, especially considering that Plastic Beach is a source of rather... _complicated_ emotions for everyone involved.

    Video Games 

-   _Dragalia Lost_ has this happen to Euden in Chapter 15 when some damning revelations come out. He learns from Nedrick that the man in front of him is the ACTUAL Euden who was said to have died of wyrmscale as a baby and the one that the main Euden is a Replacement Goldfish. To prove his claim, Nedrick shows him the book that will only glow for those of Alberius's bloodline. It glows for his twin sister, Zethia, but when it's Euden's turn...it doesn't!
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_, Link does this whenever he is hurt or surprised.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks_, Zelda does it in the scene where she learn the Demon King plans to possess her body.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_, when Midna discovers the Mirror of Twilight has been broken, her eyes do this.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_ and _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, Gorons get these kinds of eyes when startled or shocked. It's notable because their eyes otherwise lack visible irises.
-   Thane's eyes in _Mass Effect_ end up looking a bit like this while he's having a flashback - it likely just has that effect due to the fact that his flashbacks are the only times his irises are easy to make out.
-   _Ollo in The Sunny Valley Fair_: Ollo's first reaction to seeing the prize-winning tomato.
-   In _Street Fighter IV_, activating a Super Combo or Ultra Combo will make the screen darken and the action slow down. This is not terribly different from conventional 2D Fighting Games using 2D graphics, which usually darken and go slow-motion/pause for super moves as well. A nice touch that _is_ different in this game (which uses 3D graphics) is that you often get to see the other fighter’s eyes slowly do this as they get that gut feeling that their opponent is about to open a biiiiig can of whoop-ass....
-   Kaguya from _Touhou Project_ does this at 02:15, but it's not out of fear.
-   _Epic Mickey_: Splatter the Shadow Blot with paint. No seriously, do it, it's priceless.
-   Vincent from _Catherine_ pulls off a spectacular example<small>◊</small> for one of the promo arts of the game.
-   _World of Warcraft Cataclysm_: Deathwing gives an absolutely beautiful example when he sees Thrall holding the Dragon Soul. Deathwing ''created'' the Dragon Soul, he knows perfectly well just how much damage it can do. It's probably the first time he showed anything besides rage in the game.
-   This happens _a lot_ in the _Joe & Mac_ series. It occurs whenever Joe, Mac, the enemies, and even the bosses receive damage. It's especially funny in _Joe & Mac 2_ considering that the dinosaur bosses in that game look more realistic compared to the other entries in the series.
-   Used to hilarious effect by Ludger in _Tales of Xillia 2_, after he tests out a mind-reading device on Musee and learns that she's a lot wackier then she lets on; the accompanying dumbfounded facial expression making it all the more priceless. However, it's also used in a serious fashion throughout the game, often as a result of a mortal wound.
-   Male characters in the original _Tales of Phantasia_ on the Super Famicom spot funny popping eyes when they take damage.
-   The "Shocked" expression for characters in _Final Fantasy V_ have notably small eyes with wide open mouths.
-   When Toy Bonnie attacks the player character in _Five Nights at Freddy's 2_, his irises are noticeably smaller than normal.
-   Used to varying effect in _Yandere Simulator_. In the case of Yandere-chan, they slowly shrink when the player gets a Game Over by way of Senpai rejecting her or a teacher expelling her. For everyone else, they appear in the same fashion when they see something bad happen (either you killing someone or happening across a corpse). If they see you commit a murder, but you get away with it, their irises remain shrunken as a way of saying that they know you killed someone and they're going to damage your reputation continuously by spreading the word of your crime around the school.
-   The intro cinematic for _Jazz Jackrabbit 2_ shows the titular Jazz wreaking havoc on a few helpless mooks... before coming face to face with one three times his size. Cue the Oh Crap Face, before little brother Spaz bails him out.
-   _Eternal Senia: Hydrangea After The Rain_: Little Fairy has such an expression, but with no iris at all, she's the character in the Start Screen and tapped, when she says:
    
    Ahh! Careful Senia! You almost hit me!
    
-   The Final Boss of _Resident Evil 2_ (both the original and the remake) does this immediately before dying.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ has two examples:
    -   Yuri develops a habit of making her eyes look like this as she undergoes Sanity Slippage. Occasionally she throws in a nice big grin for good measure.
    -   At the end of Act 2, Natsuki gets these when she sees Yuri's decaying body, upon which she vomits and runs out of the room.

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_, the main character does just this when he is very, very angry. Lampshaded in the Alt Text.
-   In _Blip_, Hester's irises are normally the size of saucers, so seeing them shrink to pinpricks really sells that she's in a state of shock.
-   Frequently used in _Everyday Heroes_; for example, here when Mr. Mighty is scaring off the homeless guy who came to rob a convenience store.
-   _Dragalia Life_ can have this happen on a regular basis with some of the slapstick that goes on.
    -   #103 has Cibella lifting weights to get stronger which prompts the resident Armsmaster Celliera to offer to put her through a workout. Euden overhears it and goes wide-eyed remembers having a nightmare of her taking his friend Luca out and coming out super tall and buff, then worrying if she does it to Cibella, the same would happen to her, prompting him to try and break it up.
-   _Homestuck_ gives us some of<small>◊</small> the<small>◊</small> best<small>◊</small> reaction<small>◊</small> shots<small>◊</small> ever,<small>◊</small> courtesy of a few trolls.
-   In _Last Res0rt_, while still used as an expression of shock, these eyes along with a slightly agape mouth are the telltale sign that someone's under the Compelling Voice of a Celeste.
-   The expression _The Order of the Stick_ characters make when they're scared sort of evokes this. Including for Xykon himself: the skeleton with Glowing Eyelights of Undeath suddenly gains Expressive Orbits.
-   Souls in _Jack_ have teeny irises, if they are unjudged or hellbound. Once they are judged ready for heaven, or if the hellbound seek redemption, the characters' irises get even bigger and more expressive than when they were alive. Corpses' eyes look like this as well.
-   In _The Other Grey Meat_ Pretty much every other strip.
-   _Pixie and Brutus_: Randal the raccoon's fear after hearing Brutus threaten him for threatening Pixie comes across clearly thanks to very big eyes and pinpoint irises.
-   Happens in _Questionable Content_, with lampshading by the author at least once.
-   Black Mage does this a few times in _8-Bit Theater_, though given the fact that his eyes glow like two little lights under his hat, its hard to really say if he's a true example, even if his eyes do visibly shrink.
    -   Also, the current page picture<small>◊</small> for Puff of Logic.
-   _Strays_ here
-   Mark, of _FreakAngels_, exhibits classic tiny, tiny irises as he goes into his furious, terrified rant in Episode 0134.
-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_ had Kat eyes doing this when she was told about certain Power Tattoo. Repeated in a later scene that ends in a triple Beat Panel and deserves it.
    -   Annie gets her turn on the last page of chapter 36.
    -   In 751, Kat's eyes go from Black Bead Eyes, to this, to Blank White Eyes within three panels.
-   When Tanna of _Ears for Elves_ first sees Rolan (who is moving at high speed), her widened eyes, tiny irises, and high arched eyebrows indicate her surprise/shock. The black and white explosion-style background also shows suddenness.
-   In _Sequential Art_, this often happens to Kat, who as Cat Folk normally has massive irises.
-   In _Savestate_, Riley has this reaction when she first meets Harvey.

    Western Animation 

-   In the episode of _American Dad!_ where Roger tricks Steve into joining a drug manufacturing operation by telling him it's Hogwarts, towards the end of the episode Roger gets knocked face first into a pile of some unspecified drug. When he pulls his face out, his pupils first dilated rather large, and he proceeded to disarm and kill every thug attacking him, and shoot a bunch of rounds into the ceiling because we was wired. Then, with one thug left, Roger realizes he has run out of ammo to use against the last armed thug, which causes his eyes to shrink to a pinpoint, and him to touch the TV in the room and call "Ah, TV is safe!"

-   _Teen Titans_' Beast Boy when he transforms into The Beast.
-   Many _Total Drama_ characters have big, expressive eyes, with irises that tend to shrink visibly during Oh, Crap! moments. Heather is the most prominent example, partly because she has the most expressive eyes of the entire cast and partly because she simply has more screen time than most.
