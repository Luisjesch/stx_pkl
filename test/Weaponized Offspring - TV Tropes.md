Don't you just hate family reunions?

**Boomstick:** What is it with creatures from the _Mario_ universe usin' their babies as weapons? Is it that effective? I'm gonna have to test this out, maybe some sort of baby-launcher...  
**Wiz:** Boomstick! That is a terrible idea! Anytime you wanted to reload, you'd have to wait nine months!

A creature, very often seen in video game boss battles, which creates smaller versions of itself or gives birth to attack its enemies. Sometimes there is an explanation, such as it being the queen of a race of Bee People or is the Mother of a Thousand Young, sometimes there isn't. Sometimes a monster will just spawn smaller copies and send them after the enemy with no other indication that it is actually female (sometimes it will be explicitly stated as male, on top of things).

This, in video games, tends to happen just to make the boss fight more difficult and/or annoying. Usually these characters have a seemingly endless supply of offspring to launch at potential attackers. It's probably worth noting that eggs don't need to be fertilised.

Natural selection favors those who pass on their genes, which requires at least some of their offspring to survive long enough to reproduce. However, in the case of eusocial insects such as bees, ants, and termites, all but the queens and drones are sterile, so it doesn't matter if they die as long as it helps their mother survive long enough to produce fertile offspring that can pass on their genes.

A sister trope to Tyke Bomb, and subtrope of Mook Maker and Abnormal Ammo. Daughter of Monster Is a Mommy. Related to Flunky Boss and Asteroids Monster. Also a subtrope of Living Weapon and Natural Weapon (since the ability to produce offspring is pretty inherent). Compare Doppelgänger Attack, Proj-egg-tile. Contrast Spawn Broodling: this trope is about attacking or creating allies by giving birth; Spawn Broodling is about attacking or creating allies by _making the enemy give birth_. See also Drone Deployer.

## Video Game examples:

    Action Adventure  

-   _Ecco the Dolphin_ has several levels with a Mister Seahorse that shoots its young at Ecco.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Queen Gohma in _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ lays eggs as you fight her, which if not destroyed hatch into baby spiders.
    -   The Mothula enemies from _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_ counter-attack by launching a blast of Morths at you which cling to Link to slow him down.
    -   The Deku Toad from _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_ is first seen when tadpoles drop from the ceiling and attack you (it repeats this tactic later on). Armogohma also uses her broodlings to assist her similar to the Ocarina of Time incarnation.
-   _Metroid_:
    -   _Metroid Prime 2: Echoes_ has the Chykka, guardian of Dark Torvus, who spawns Chykklings during the fight against her. This generally makes the fight easier, since Chykklings are easily destroyed and usually drop profuse amounts of health and ammo.
    -   _Metroid Prime 3: Corruption_:
        -   The Fargul Hatcher, which is not a boss but appears in only one spot on the planet Bryyo, also uses this form of attack by spawning a wave of Fargul Wasps at Samus.
        -   Metroid Hatchers, as their name suggests, spawn Phazon Metroids from time to time.
        -   The Leviathans act as these, being the offspring of Phaaze that are sent to corrupt and destroy the universe.
    -   _Metroid Fusion_ has enemies in the water zone that launch rotating eggs (maybe they're eggs...?) from their abdomens.
-   Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum from _American McGee's Alice_ can open up and spawn smaller, weaker copies of themselves.
-   In _inFAMOUS 2_, the Hive Lord enemy will create pods that sprout from that ground. The pods hatch Spikers if the player doesn't destroy them fast enough.
-   Mother Smiles in _Killer7_ lay eggs that roll towards the player. They hatch if they get close to the player, or if they're shot, turning into a vanilla Action Bomb Heaven Smile.
-   The seahorse in some _Ecco the Dolphin_ levels does this, spitting out baby seahorses from his pouch.
-   _Brütal Legend_:The Tainted Coil are a demon faction that kill and dominate humans as they are flawed and bootleged copies of the old metal gods, they breed with the use of some special demons Battle nun, War father and Overblesser that impregnate themselves to the ground and make womb egg where other demons spawn, also from syringes being shot from their stage
-   _Monster Hunter_:
    -   _Monster Hunter 3 (Tri)_: The Gigginox will periodically lay a cluster of eggs on the ground, from which Giggi will emerge, sucking the health off of any Hunters they latch on to. In G Rank, it'll start laying the eggs on its back, for the sake of making it more difficult to destroy them. The eggs, however, are far preferable to the alternative of dangerous poison bombs.
    -   _Monster Hunter: Rise_: The Rakna-Kadaki can throw its Rachnoid offspring at Hunters and coordinate attacks with them.
-   The Spider Queen boss from _Ninja: Shadow of Darkness_ can pursue the player, but have no attacks on her own, save for releasing a web that ensnares the titular hero. But then, she will also lay several eggs, which hatches into baby spiders and starts attacking the player, who must perform some quick Button Mashing to break free from the web, kill the baby spiders via Goomba Stomp, and continue fighting the Queen.
-   _Shantae_:
    -   _Shantae: Risky's Revenge_: One of the Squid Baron's attacks involves calling down his baby warp squids to attack Shantae. This gets a Lampshade Hanging in his introductory trailer for _Shantae and the Pirate's Curse_
        
        **Squid Baron**: The way I teleported around, dropping from the ceiling. I put you in such danger.  
        **Shantae**: Not completely! What about the little squids you spawned from time to time? Attacking them let me get my hearts back. That counts for something, right?  
        **Squid Baron**: _(Suddenly panicking)_ I forgot all about the children!
        
    -   _Shantae and the Pirate's Curse_: The Empress Spider will lay eggs in one of her moves. They will then hatch to release baby spiders that will attack Shantae.

     Action RPG  

-   The Ravagers in _Mass Effect 3_ release tiny Swarmers when wounded, which crawl towards the attacker and try to push them into the Ravager's line of fire.
-   One of the Divine Beasts in _Solatorobo_ lays eggs in midair that hatch into small birds that attack you.

     Eastern RPG  

-   _Baten Kaitos Origins_: Holoholobird, the first boss of the second disc, is supported by two of its chicks. If you kill any of them, the bird will lay an egg, which will hatch into a new chick shortly after. These chicks can heal the bird, and their attacks _tear through_ defense magnus, contributing much of the boss' difficulty.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Vespiquen has three exclusive moves where she unleashes a swarm of drones to attack, defend or heal herself respectively. She's also based on a queen bee, naturally (see Real Life section below.)
    -   Dragapult is a motherly Pokémon that carries several Dreepy within the holes on its head. It also shoots the Dreepy like bullets. The Dreepy actually look forward to this, for some reason.
    -   Mega Kangaskhan borders on this, letting its baby out of its pouch so the baby can fight alongside it.
-   In _Final Fantasy VII_, the Grangalan outside Costa del Sol can spawn smaller versions of itself known Grangalan Jr. for the second generation and Grangalan Jr. Jr. for the third and smallest generation.

     First-Person Shooter  

-   The Gonarch from _Half-Life_ creates Headcrabs (who are essentially smaller versions of it) during the fight against it.
-   Shial from _Blood_ has spawning of regular spiders as its only attack.
-   The 1996 release of _Duke Nukem 3D_ had Duke face the alien queen as the Final Boss. The queen routinely birthed drones that could fire shrink rays at Duke, making him very squishable.
-   Spiderant Queens from the _Borderlands_ will spawn waves of Spiderantlings if they receive critical health damage, to the point that killing one with a critical hit to the abdomen causes it to burst open and release even _more_ Spiderantlings.

     Fighting Game  

-   _Mortal Kombat X_ features D'Vorah, a living-hive-insect-lady. She throws all kinds of bugspawn at her enemies, and even has a Brutality in which she implants a larva into her opponents' chest cavity, which explodes after a few seconds of painful incubation.
    
    **D'Vorah**: You will feed this one's young!
    

     Hack and Slash  

-   Cerberi in the first _God of War_ game spit out puppylike Cerberus Seeds that, if given enough time, will grow into full grown Cerberi.
-   Echidna from _Devil May Cry 4_ uses her Chimera Seeds as weapons, both as projectiles and as a Mook Maker. She then has the nerve to act outraged when you blow said seeds out of the sky or smash them with your Devil Bringer.

     Platform Game  

-   Several stages in _Mega Man 2_ contain birds that fly across the top of the screen, dropping an egg partway through. If the egg hits a solid platform, it will hatch into a swarm of tiny birds that can be hard to avoid. Of course, since both the main bird and the mini-birds are robots, they're not _literally_ offspring, but the spirit of the trope clearly applies.
-   Yellow Paragoombas in _Super Mario Bros. 3_ attack by releasing Microgoombas from the air; oddly enough, the microgoombas are not actually its offspring. Straighter examples can be seen with Blooper Nannies, which send their Blooper Babies in a spiral to swarm Mario, and Big Bertha, who attacks Mario by spitting her kid at him and then retrieving it.
-   Subverted by the Yoshi species of _Super Mario Bros._. They do lay eggs that hatch baby Yoshis and can also throw their eggs as a weapon, but the eggs they use for throwing don't contain babies (and are spawned from enemies they've eaten).
-   In _Super Ghouls and Ghosts_, the boss of the first stage is a giant bird which spits eggs out of its mouth which hatch into smaller, groundbound bird monsters which attack you.
-   _Skylanders_ has Sonic Boom, a griffin whose children are cursed to constantly be reborn as eggs. Because of this, she decides to train her children to fight as soon as they hatch, so that they can be able to defend themselves at any time. It can be upgraded in various ways, including the ability for the eggs to inflict damage before the babies hatch from them. They also manage to inherit her sonic abilities. Also Double Trouble, a witchdoctor, sends miniature clones of himself to attack.
-   In _Mega Man X_, Storm Eagle can fire eggs which will hatch into robotic birds that will attack you.
-   In _Mega Man Zero 4_, Popla Cocapetri (a chicken) can lay an egg with 2 legs that will run about, harrassing you. The egg is hard to kill, too.
-   _Donkey Kong 64_: The spider mini-boss will send groups of smaller spiders (possibly its children) after Tiny Kong.
-   _Umihara Kawase_ features a giant tadpole which lays eggs that hatch into frogs that will stun Umihara if they touch her.

     Real-Time Strategy  

-   In the original _StarCraft_ the Zerg's Queen units could spawn broodlings, in _StarCraft II_ the Brood Lord does that as does Kerrigan.
    -   The _Heart of the Swarm_ expansion to _Starcraft II_ introduces the Swarm Host unit that spawns short-lived locusts. The Primal Zerg Pack Leader Slivan the Eternal Mother resembles a massive Swarm Host. In another mission the Brood Mother Niadra spawns several zerglings without the use of a hatchery.
        -   Heart of the Swarm also had this as an upgrade option for Banelings: When it explodes it becomes two smaller Banelings.
-   _Warcraft III_:
    -   Nerubians and Hydras from spawn two smaller Nerubians / Hydras on death. In the Nerubian's case it's explained as their carrying their young into battle.
    -   Crypt Fiends and Nerubians attack with what seems to be tiny, floating spiderlings. You can also notice that said spiders will float back to the user after being cast. Furthermore, the description of the Nerubian unit implies this.
-   _Pikmin_:
    -   _Pikmin 2_: The Empress Bulbax lays Bulborb larvae to attack you when you face it, except in the first encounter.
    -   _Pikmin 3_: Partway through its battle, the Vehemoth Phosbat activates pods scattered around its arena to spawn streams of baby Phosbats to harry your squad.

     Roguelike  

-   In _NetHack_ it's possible for a character polymorphed into a female monster (regardless of what gender they were beforehand) to lay eggs. Cockatrice eggs can be thrown in order to stone an enemy. Throwing eggs you laid results in a luck penalty though. Alternatively a character that finds an egg can carry it with them, and it may become a tame monster upon hatching.
-   _The Binding of Isaac_:
    -   From the enemy side, the Mulligans are an unwilling example, as they are living insect hives, but there's also the gray spiders that attack by ocassionaly spawning an egg sac that periodically shoots smaller spiders, Chub, who among her boss battle tactics is to spawn Chublings and, of course, there's It Lives, who is Isaac himself, as a fetus, fighting inside his mother's womb.
    -   From the player side, Tainted Lilith's version of Gello has it bursting out of their stomach like it was an unborn demon fetus bound to them with their umbilical cord that attacks on their stead. And with C Section item, Isaac can shoot out fetuses from his stomach that deal damage when coming in contact with an enemy.
-   _Brutal Orchestra_ has the Mungling Mud Lung, a pair of Mungs occupying a corpse together that can "mungle" to create a baby Mungie, which then joins the fight.

     Shoot 'em Up  

-   This is the attack of the final boss of _Apidya_, a giant hornet that keeps releasing bees at you.
-   Akhamafold Octopod from _Super Cyborg_ will spawn the stage's recurring spider-like enemies throughout it's boss battle via an egg sac from it's abdomen.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Star Resistance_: The giant dog head bioweapon Gustav produces two enemies throughout the latter half of Stage 3: Gustav cells, which drop as egg-like masses before sprouting into tall, undulating stalks; and Gustav children, headless dogs that wander the ground. It produces the children during both phases of its boss fight, producing extra distractions while you dodge its eye beams, and the cells while chasing it between phases.

     Simulation Game  

-   Thanks to the detailed simulation and Wide-Open Sandbox nature of _Dwarf Fortress_, it's completely possible, even with a vanilla version, to use quickly reproducing non-pasture animals such as turkeys or peafowl as an infinite source of ammunition to blast off lava cannons onto enemy hordes. The trick is to set the ammo on fire prior to launch. And of course, you probably have some dwarven kids running around as well, contributing nothing and learning nothing while depleting your booze stock for nine years. For a specific _DF_ example, there's Boatmurdered: "A few more war dogs ran out and attacked. I have to say I'm slightly terrified by them. One of the bitches actually _gave birth_ while she was attacking, and her _puppies_ joined in on the carnage." Militia dwarves tend to go into battle carrying their infants, which can lead to the poor kid being used as a club. Or a shield.

     Survival Horror  

-   In _Resident Evil – Code: Veronica_, Alexia's penultimate boss form turns her into a Queen Ant like creature that constantly births small poisonous insectoid enemies that run interference while Chris tries to fight her.

-   The Daedra Spiders in _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_ send little mini-versions of themselves to attack and paralyze you.
-   Matilda in _Angry Birds_, who has an egg bomb as her schtick.

     Wide-Open Sandbox  

-   _Terraria_:
    -   The Eye of Cthulhu shoots out mini-eyes to attack the player as a sort of ranged attack.
    -   The Brain of Cthulhu shoots out flying eyeballs that serve as its life bar.
    -   The Queen Bee rapidly fires out bees to chase you down and damage you. After killing it, you can get a weapon that allows you to do the same thing.
    -   The Wall of Flesh shoots out burrowing worms that attack the player as well as the feeders that extend on cords to attack the player.
    -   Plantera sprouts vine attached attack mouths like the wall of flesh has in its second stage.

     MMORPG  

-   Happens too many times to count in _World of Warcraft_. Perhaps the most infamous example was Onyxia and whelps which she spawned occasionally. The same whelps would also spawn when a player came too close to piles of eggs in the room, and Onyxia happened to have a fearing attack which caused characters to run uncontrollably, often leading to MANY WHELPS! NOW, HANDLE IT!

    -   This is also suspected from jinjurikis as they have tailed beasts sealed inside them, but actually both the jinjurikis and the tailed beasts were normal people with personal feeling and agendas but biased humans suspected their are demonic entities that only enjoy carnage, it was greedy warmongers that made the tailed beasts and jinjurikis fuel their hatred for humanity for unfairly treating them as monsters and for wanting to use them as weapons for personal gain. Best case scenario was with Naruto and Kurama whom had people who cared for them and wanted them to be happy, worst case scenarios were Gaara whom his uncle tried to kill him as a child to prevent him from destroying the village and get revenge his mom died at childbirth, despite that isn't his fault, and Rin whom became an unwilling jinjuriki putting Isobu inside her to become a troyan horse.

-   In _Ender's Game_ (and sequels) the Formic queen gives birth to all her soldiers, since the Formics are an insect race.

    -   Princess Bala would also keep breeding the colony with her husband Z, starting with 1 million or 2

    Real Life 

-   This tends to be the case with social insects; all of them except for queens are infertile and only exist to fight off threats or gather food.
