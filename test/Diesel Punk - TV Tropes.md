Dieselpunk is a Punk Punk genre of Speculative Fiction based on the 1920s\-1940s period, spiced up with retro-futuristic innovations and occult elements. The Dieselpunk narrative is characterized by conflict vs the undefeatable (nature, society, cosmic powers), heavy use of technology, and Grey-and-Gray Morality. The protagonists are often Heroic Neutral and have low social status.

Generally, Dieselpunk can take inspiration from 1920s German Expressionist films, Film Noir, 1930s Pulp Magazines and Radio Dramas, and 1940s Crime and wartime comics, period propaganda films and newsreels, wartime pinups, and other entertainment of the early 20th century. As this covers a broad spectrum, the precise sources of inspiration can vary greatly between dieselpunk works. Like Steampunk, Dieselpunk is a genre dictated primarily by its aesthetics rather than by its thematic content. Both grime and glamour have their place in dieselpunk. Vehicles may have exposed engines and customized exteriors.

Dieselpunk overlaps with Two-Fisted Tales and Raygun Gothic, but differs mostly in its Punk Punk themes. Two-Fisted Tales explore settings such as Heroic Fantasy and Space Opera that are not properly a part of Dieselpunk, and Raygun Gothic tends to reference a period both chronologically and technologically more advanced or just shinier and more optimistic. Typically, Dieselpunk roots itself in urban and wartime settings of the 1920s to the late 1940s, both literally and figuratively "down to earth".

If a Dieselpunk setting is presented as an Alternate History, a common point of divergence from our timeline is that The Great Depression never happened, leading to further economic and technological growth and less of the warmongering typical of the inter-war era. World War II may still happen in some Dieselpunk settings, though; see below.

The term Dieselpunk was popularized by Lewis Pollak and Dan Ross in 2001 as the genre for their RPG _Children of the Sun_. Pollak stated that it was intended to be on the "darker, dirtier side of Steampunk" and should be considered a "continuum between steampunk and Cyberpunk." (On the other hand, noted reviewer Kenneth Hite described _Children_ as "Not really diesel, and not really punk.")

To be noted: unlike the 2000s, the Diesel-powered car in the 1930s was a rare curiosity, only a single model being put into small-scale production in Germany during that age (and almost exclusively used as a taxi), but on the other side the vast majority of the population could not afford cars back then. The life of an ordinary citizen was far deeper influenced by the oil-burning locomotive, bus, ocean liner or neighborhood power plant. Still, during this period steam engines _were_ gradually being replaced by diesel engines in many areas.

## Dieselpunk Variations

### General

Vastness is key. This was the age of the Zeppelin, the dreadnought battleship and the ocean liner, the flying-boat airliner, of clockwork wonders and the skyscraper. It also saw the first multinational corporations (in the modern sense), large-scale social engineering, and mass political movements. World War I was still fresh in memory as the Great War, the most colossal conflict in the history of mankind. Man is dwarfed by his creations and things are subsumed into abstractions.

Period technology encompasses everything found in Steampunk, but internal combustion and electric power in combination with new materials (better alloys, plastics, etc) makes machinery lighter, stronger, and more versatile. The airliner is the prime example of this, but cars, trucks, tractors, and diesel-powered electrical generators are even more important in reshaping the world. Armored vehicles and usable submarines are less common but still important innovations. Wireless radio leads to the rise of broadcasting as an information medium. Anachronistic super-advanced technology, often of the Awesome, but Impractical variety, such as Giant Flyer, Spider Tank, Disintegrator Ray might occur. Such technology might be secret super weapons of a villain, or Homemade Inventions by the hero or his friends.

Although the Dieselpunk aesthetic can overlap with Raygun Gothic, and though Dieselpunk is known for featuring Tesla technology and Wunderwaffen-style super-weapons, Dieselpunk typically does _not_ include transistor-based technology, other electronics or atomic power. In fact, another Punk Punk genre label, Atompunk, was coined to describe fiction in this mode. Atompunk (such as the _Fallout_ series and the comic book _Fear Agent_) takes inspiration from 1950s-era aesthetics and fashions such as Googie architecture and Jetsons-style technology, which typically lie outside the bounds of Dieselpunk. The analogue sci-fi of _Metropolis_ and _Things to Come_ are closer to the Dieselpunk tradition as it stands.

Dieselpunk often focuses upon air travel and combat, including such ideas as literal "flying fortresses", air pirates, dirigibles, early UFOs, hotshot flyboy pilots, etc. Fascination with military hardware, weaponry and uniforms of the early 20th century is also often in evidence and a great amount of Dieselpunk media is concerned with war, especially the Second World War and fictional variations thereof. Owing to its pulp roots, Dieselpunk is often very adventure-based, full of exotic locales such as Mysterious Antarctica, The Shangri-La, the Hollow Earth, etc. Some Geographic Flexibility is to be expected.

Dieselpunk fiction can encompass the supernatural as well. In dieselpunk adventure, occult practices are Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane, and maybe Magicians Are Wizards. The works of H. P. Lovecraft, tales of Nazi occult research, contemporary expeditions to 'mystical' places such as Egypt, and early research into relativity and quantum physics have greatly contributed to the occult mystique that informs Dieselpunk. This tends to contrast with the 19th-century Gothic themes and spiritualism that show up in Steampunk.

As Dieselpunk is a post-modern look at the past, it is not limited to the tropes and stereotypes that characterized fiction of the day — instead, it can use these tropes to comment upon the past and reinvent it. Dieselpunk (along with steampunk) can encompass a range of authorial voices and themes. Female characters in Dieselpunk tend to be strong, encompassing flappers to pin-up girls and much more, and can include Rosie the Riveter\-type action heroines, glamourous femmes fatales, costumed crusaders, archaeologist badasses, dragon ladies, tough-talking reporters and other types common to pulp fiction of the era. Both male and female characters are typically Badass Normals with universal drivers' licenses.

Sub-genres are listed below as possible avenues of exploration, but as these categorizations may only describe one or two works, if any, they should be taken with a grain of salt.

### Diesel Deco/Deco Punk

Also called "Ottensian" Dieselpunk after Nick Ottens, some guy on the Internet, who postulated it. This is the most optimistic form of dieselpunk. Progress seems unstoppable and the future is bright. Things are designed to be stylish and opulent, ornamental and efficient at the same time. Think Bauhaus architecture and design, Art Deco, Expressionism, the 1939 New York World Fair. A good setting for a Science Hero.

### Diesel Noir and Dark Deco

Similar to Diesel Deco, but generally Darker and Edgier. Emphasizes the downside of economic and technological progress. Society is plagued by crime and corruption, technology seems to be at its most effective in producing increasingly effective weaponry. The occult basically amounts to Black Magic (including exotic religions), Sealed Evil in a Can might turn up in an archeological dig and subsequently have to be stopped to avoid The End of the World as We Know It.

### Diesel Weird War

World War II is being waged (or World War I in some instances), but one or both sides are introducing superweapons, alien technology and/or occult forces into the mix, often with one or more Mad Scientists behind it all. For a less extreme variant, something like the real-life exploits of the nascent Special Air Service in collaboration with the Long Range Desert Group (briefly, Lawrence of Arabia upgraded with blast-incendiary explosives and "gunship jeeps"). (See Weird Historical War.)

### Diesel Dystopia

Also called "Piecraftian" Diesel Punk, again named for some guy on the Internet. World War II did start and may still be in progress; if it isn't, either some kind of Cold War is being waged, or a One World Order has been established. Either way, The Government is intrusive and ruthless, ostensibly to protect the citizens. The political ideology might be any kind of totalitarianism, either one of the many real life examples of the period, a mashup of those, or a completely fictional analogue.

### Diesel Desolation

World War II did start and ended because there isn't anything left to fight over, and very few resources left to fight with, or even to sustain civilization. It's essentially a post-apocalyptic milieu, and certainly not a very common dieselpunk flavor.

    Period Works 

Dieselpunk is a modern genre, but some of the films and books of the period fit well, in the same fashion that Jules Verne's books can be posed as Steampunk.

## Sorted by author:

-   Pretty much any Film Noir or crime film of the period.
-   Most of The Soviet '20s' sci-fi:
    -   _The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin_, a.k.a. _The Garin Death Ray_, (1926-1927) by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy. It falls between Diesel Noir and Diesel Weird War, as the author manages to poke some fun at The Roaring '20s and The Soviet '20s between the lines and also to imagine a dystopian world where Capitalist and Socialist-Revolutionary forces fight each other with poison gas, airships and Death Rays.
    -   _Aelita,_ by the same author, about heroic Mad Scientist and Russian Civil War veteran flying to Mars, sparking a proletarian revolution there, and engaging in Inter Species Romance (though it turns out to be not so interspecies, after all, as the Martians are refugees from Atlantis). Notable for probably the first application of Relativity Theory in science fiction, use of Ancient Astronauts trope, and Atlantis myth. See also the 1924 film adaptation.
    -   Some works by Mikhail Bulgakov, all are united by Gone Horribly Wrong trope, satire on contemporary reality, and scepticism towards communism.
        -   _The Fatal Eggs_, about Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever, through unfortunate application of ray icreasing growth and size of organisms.
        -   _Ivan Vasilyevich_ — a Time Travel story, with wacky adventures and Black Comedy.
        -   _Heart of a Dog_ — Artificial Human as failure of New Soviet Man idea.
    -   _Loss Of Sensation_ — where robots look not like humans, but like retro-Mecha, and are used to destroy capitalist system and free workers.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Some of the works of Karel Čapek
    -   _R.U.R._ (1921)
    -   _War with the Newts_ (1936)
-   The surreal dystopian writing of Franz Kafka, e.g. _The Metamorphosis_ (1915)
-   By the director-writer couple Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou:
    -   _Metropolis_ (1927), also a novel.
    -   _Woman in the Moon_ (1929) features retro-space flight (strikingly realistic), an aviatrix is the eponymous protagonist, a conspiracy of capitalists (including one Yellow Peril), a Mad Scientist (a benevolent version) and an atmosphere of pulp fiction of the epoch. Inspired several German rocket scientists, including Wernher von Braun, in their pioneer rocket work.
-   H. P. Lovecraft and his _Cthulhu Mythos_ crop up frequently in dieselpunk.
    -   _The Colour Out of Space_ (1927)
    -   _The Dunwich Horror_ (1929)
    -   _At the Mountains of Madness_ (February-April, 1936)
    -   _The Shadow Over Innsmouth_ (April, 1936)
-   H. G. Wells can be seen as a contemporary bridge between Steampunk and Dieselpunk, the evolution of his works reflecting a transition from one to the other over the course of his career
    -   _The War of the Worlds_ (1898) is an interesting hybrid, the protagonist and initial setting fitting more into proto-steampunk, but the bleak depictions of global conflict with an inhuman Industrialized Evil cast a shadow towards the era that would inspire dieslepunk
    -   _The Land Ironclads_ (1903) and _The War In The Air_ (1908) - again, Wells makes unsettlingly prescient extrapolations on the future of warfare, forseeing bleak global conflicts where barely-trained ex-grocery-clerks find themselves cowering in trenches from literal war machines and watching in horror as cities are obliterated by fleets of bomb-laden aircraft.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   _The Shape of Things to Come_ (1933) by and its 1936 film adaptation _Things to Come_

## Sorted by title:

    Anime and Manga 

-   _The Big O_ (1999-2000)
-   _Black Cat_ (2005-2006) has modern technology pop up, but the setting overall has a very Diesel Punk aesthetic and feel to it.
-   _Despera_, a project by Yoshitoshi Abe seems to be taking place in a setting like this.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_ (2001-2010), a rare combination of dieselpunk and Magitek.
-   _Futago no Teikoku_ is set in a Constructed World heavily based off 1930s Asia, with much of the technology, such as flying airships, modeled on World War II era advancements. The central conflict is itself a Fantasy Conflict Counterpart of WWII, particularly Imperial Japan's occupation of China.
-   _Kerberos Saga_
    -   _Kerberos Panzer Cop_ (1988-2000)
    -   _Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade_ (1999)
-   _Last Exile_ (2003) combines dieselpunk with Steampunk.
-   _The Magnificent Kotobuki_: (2019) World War 2 airplanes flying from cargo zeppelins firmly plants the show here.
-   _Metropolis (2001)_, also the manga by Osamu Tezuka.
-   _REDLINE_ (2010) is a mix of Space Opera and a load of dieselpunk elements.
-   _Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise_ (1987) shows an early Cold War era version of this trope.
-   _The Sky Crawlers_ (2008) depicts a future in which war has been eliminated, but corporations wage a continual war using clones and WWII-style aircraft for the public's amusement.
-   Some of the Studio Ghibli films take place in a mythical Diesel Deco-style Europe:
    -   _Castle in the Sky_ (1986). The villains are based around this trope, while the heroes are more rooted in Steampunk.
    -   _Kiki's Delivery Service_ (1989)
    -   _Porco Rosso_ (1992) takes place in a fictionalized Mediterranean setting between WWI and WWII. Besides (possibly) fictional use of air pirates and the magical realist-style presentation of Porco's being a pig, _Porco Rosso_ incorporates historically accurate cues that indicate Italy is about to come under Benito Mussolini's leadership.
    -   _Howl's Moving Castle_ (2004)
-   _Super Atragon_ (1995): The undersea-battleship ''Ra'' is a superbly rendered piece of dieselpunk technology and style, plowing the seas of the modern world.
-   _Texhnolyze_ is a mixture of dieselpunk aesthetics and Cyberpunk technology.
-   _Vampire in the Garden_ takes place in a post apocalyptic setting modeled on the Soviet Union with mostly pre 1980's technology and remarkably held back dose of Soviet Superscience.
-   _Xam'd: Lost Memories_ (2008-2009)

    Art 

-   A Pixiv artist known as coh, N&S, and k.y. has created a series called "Mars Expedition", featuring girls wearing various headgear with false animal ears on them, alongside various other Moe tropes, representing several countries from throughout the world, all with a very WWII-style dieselpunk look to them.
-   Polish painter Jakub Rozalski uses his paintings to document the 1920 Polish-Soviet War, but with giant mechs and... bears?!
-   The art of Stranski (the working name of Lorenzo Etherington), and his guides on how to draw, and how to tell stories with art. Ruined jungle temples, ukelele wielding catgirls, tiki idols, dragon ladies, stoic lion men, more or less realistic period vehicles. Mostly found online or in galleries but some very limited editions were published on Kickstarter.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_ (1995-2010)
-   _Atomic Robo_ (2007-) is a walking incarnation of this trope who's matured over the decades (he's been punching all kinds of strangeness in the face since the 30's) into an all-around Science Hero.
-   _Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham_ is Batman as written by Mike Mignola- our caped crusader in a shadowy 1920s setting. With Cthulhu.
-   _Carbon Grey_ (2011-)
-   _Chassis_ (1999-2000): The story is set in an alternate universe circa 1949, complete with flying race cars and villains clad in zoot suits.
-   _Dick Tracy_ (1931-), even at the time of its creation, included sci-fi elements that made it influential on dieselpunk.
-   _Dust_ by Paolo Parente, the inspiration for the Dust series of Tabletop Games below.
-   First Wave (2009-2010) is a cross between Diesel Noir and Two-Fisted Tales, with many of the Pulp Magazine heroes crossing over with newspaper comics' The Spirit and another guy from the Thirties.
-   _Hellboy_ (1993-) and its spinoffs such as _Lobster Johnson_. And _B.P.R.D._ (2002-)
-   _Ignition City_ (2009)
-   _Iron And The Maiden_ (2007)
-   _Marvel Noir_:
    -   _Iron Man Noir_ (2010), featuring Tony Stark's "repulsor pump" pacemaker, the Iron Man armor itself, and Baron Stucker's lightning-hurling Power Fist — not to mention background stuff like the sleek super zeppelins. It's unique among the _Noir_ stories for not even trying to be realistic.
    -   _X-Men Noir_ is the least fantastic of the _Marvel Noir_ settings, but introduces one dieselpunk element in the story _Mark of Cain_, the Office of National Emergency's Dirigi\-Carrier.
-   Several comics by Dean Motter including:
    -   _Mister X_ (1984-1990)
    -   _Terminal City_ (1996-1998)
    -   _Electropolis_ (2001-2002)
-   _The Nevermen_ (2000, 2003) features mechanically enhanced '40s-era fighters keeping the city safe from crazed supervillains.
-   _Pork_ (1984-2012)
-   _Sandman Mystery Theatre_ (1993-1999) brought us a Grimdark pulp superhero fighting serial killers and bizarre menaces in a 1930s City Noir.
-   _Star Noir_ (2023-present) tells the story of a human detective reluctantly pairing with an alien to catch a shapeshifting serial killer in 1947 Los Angeles.
-   _Tyson Hesse's Diesel_ (2015)

    Fan Works 

-   _Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space_ is an Affectionate Parody of Atom Punk, but a flashback scene has our hero as an Ensign Newbie fighting an airborne invasion by a 1930's-type Yellow Peril supervillain.
    
    "Steady boys," said Captain Janeway, sipping calmly from a huge thermos of coffee. The determined countenance of the world-famous aviatrix put steel in every man's heart and loins. "Shields up, go to Red Alert, load torpedoes. Put those yellow swine on visual."  
    The crew leapt into action. Armor plate was cranked over the portholes of the streamlined wheelhouse, red filters slid over each lantern and powerful telescopes trained on their foe. Aerial torpedoes shunted into their launch tubes; compressed air pumped into the chambers of the pneumatic cannon. A science-officer wearing a pair of elephantine acoustic-locator ears called out the range and bearing of their target. The ship's computer calculated the firing solution with his slide rule and passed it on to the gun deck via voicepipe.
    

    Film — Animation 

-   _9_ (2009), especially when we see parts of the backstory.
-   _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_
-   _War of the Worlds: Goliath_ takes place in an alternate 1914 on the cusp of World War I, with walking tanks and giant heavily armed airships thanks to retroengineered alien technology.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _The ABCs of Death_: The "H" segment is set in a universe where World War II was fought by anthropomorphic animals. The setting has very diesel punk feel: especially Frau Scheisse's elaborate industrial Death Trap.
-   _The Abominable Dr. Phibes_ (1971) is either very early Diesel Punk or very late Pulp Horror.
    -   _Dr. Phibes Rises Again_ (1972)
-   _Batman Film Series_:
    -   _Batman (1989)_
    -   _Batman Returns_ (1992)
-   _Brazil_ (1985)
-   _The Call of Cthulhu_ (2005)
-   _Captain America: The First Avenger_ (2011) It plays straight the trope in regards to technology used — creations of the 1940s blown up to the next level.
-   The live-action adaptation of _Casshern_ (2004) takes place in an effectively-portrayed Diesel Weird War/Diesel Desolation setting.
-   _Cast a Deadly Spell_ (1991)

-   _The City of Lost Children_ (1995) is heavily dieselpunkish in design, in a dark and ominous way. The same goes for the Playstation game based on it.
-   _Dakota Harris_ includes alien technology, Nazi agents, a lost Polynesian civilisation, and a gang of Sky Pirates operating in the Bermuda Triangle.
-   _Dark City_ (1998) seems at first to be set in a stylised version of 1940s/1950s America, but gradually reveals itself to be a Sci-Fi film which is not set in America at all.
-   _Daybreakers_ — even though it's set in the future, it has substantial Diesel Punk aesthetics.
-   _Dimensions: a line, a loop, a tangle of threads_, an independent film about time travel, set in the 1930s.
-   _The Element of Crime_ (1984) combines Diesel Noir and Diesel Desolation, for very grim results.
-   _Frankenstein's Army_ is mainly Weird War horror and gore but also has some subtle dieselpunk technology in the Russian soldiers' radio and camera gear.
-   The Polish film _Hardkor 44_ is heavily dieselpunk. Set in Warsaw in the summer of 1944, as the Soviet army bears down on Warsaw, it recounts the Warsaw Uprising by the Polish Resistance, to liberate the city before the Russians get there. Then things get weird. As in "The Nazis have cyborgs and mecha" weird.
-   _Hellboy:_
    -   _Hellboy_ (2004)
    -   _Hellboy II: The Golden Army_ (2008)
-   _The Hudsucker Proxy_ (1994).
-   _Ilang: The Wolf Brigade_ (2018) as a Korean live-action update to Jin-Roh.
-   The _Indiana Jones_ films. In fact, if you want to explain dieselpunk to someone, the Indy films are probably the best place to start.
    -   _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ (1981)
    -   _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom_ (1984)
    -   _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ (1989)
    -   _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_ (2008)
    -   _Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_(2023)
-   _Iron Sky_ (2012) contrasts the dieselpunk of the Moon Nazis against the white plastic/metal iTechnology of 20 Minutes into the Future.
-   _J-Men Forever_ (1979) by the The Firesign Theatre parodies this style.
-   _The Mummy Trilogy_
    -   _The Mummy_ (1999)
    -   _The Mummy Returns_ (2001)
    -   _The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor_ (2008)
-   _Mutant Chronicles_ (2009)
-   Russian film _Pervye Na Lune_ ("First on the Moon") is a Mockumentary about secret Soviet flight to the Moon in 1938 (sic!), which features many elements of style of early USSR — parades of athletes, propaganda boasting about sports and industrial records, dreams about world revolution and building of communistic utopia, and omnipresence of NKVD surveillance with following purgings of dissidents.
-   _The Phantom_ (1996)
-   The 1995 film adaptation of _Richard III_ by William Shakespeare. It is set in 1930s Britain (coupling Diesel Dystopia with Putting on the Reich and numerous Shout Outs to _1984_)
-   _The Rocketeer_ (1991)
-   _The Shadow_ (1994)
-   _Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_, set in an alternate 1939, straddles a midpoint between this and Raygun Gothic. The zeppelin, Joe's plane, the flying airstrip and the amphibious aeroplanes look relatively banged-up and industrial, while Totenkopf's robots, hologram and rocketship are streamlined and Art Deco.
-   The film _Sucker Punch_ (2011) is heavy on the dieselpunk.
-   A Hungarian film starring Mark Hamill, _Thelomeris_, is a mix of dieselpunk and clockpunk.
-   _Things to Come_ - an adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel _The Shape of Things to Come_ - could perhaps be called the Trope Codifier. It is a series of vignettes involving an apocalyptic never-ending world war fought with super-weapons, germ warfare that results in zombie-like infected pursuing survivors through desolate city ruins, a post-apocalyptic wasteland ruled by feudal warlords in the rags of WWI uniforms, a secret cabal of scientists in giant aircraft who seek to rebuild the world through the miracles of Diesel-Punk super-science (similiar to the Benevolent Alien Invasion plots that would follow in the '50s), a Crystal Spires and Togas utopian future forged from diesel-and-electrical-powered industrial might (weirdly taking on most of the trappings of an Orwellian Dystopia played straight, such as an elitist ruling class and giant public view-screens for a "Big Brother" style leader to give thundering filibusters on), and a metropolis threatened by megalomaniacs driven by fears of whatever awaits mankind's first trip into space, and defended by caped Proto-Superhero Science Hero types. Most of these ideas would develop separately on their own before coming back together in various combinations as different flavors of modern Diesel-Punk.
-   _Titus_ adapts the play Titus Andronicus by William Shakespeare to a surreal Alternate History where Rome survives to the present day that seems at times like a dieselpunk version of Fascist Italy.
-   _Watchmen_ (2009) — the parts set in the 1930s and 1940s.
-   _Yesterday Was a Lie_ — _Dark City_ meets _Sin City_ meets quantum physics and the nature of reality.

**Films not specifically dieselpunk, but which are related or inspirational to the genre:**

-   _Inglourious Basterds_ gives WWII an alternate history ending with some serious punk attitude.
-   _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_ does this without actual advanced technology, dealing more with changing societal standards.
-   _Sin City_ doesn't actually include dieselpunk tech elements (although an incredibly high-tech medical science is at least hinted at), but as a revisionist neo-noir, it's definitely got a dieselpunk attitude.
-   Elements of _Up_, especially the younger days of Carl and his hero, explorer Charles F. Muntz.

    Literature 

-   A major part of _Ack Ack Macaque_ by Gareth L. Powell is a MMPORG starring the title character set in a Weird War WWII featuring things like tripod tanks and Nazi ninjas.
-   _The Angaran Chronicles_ _current_ timeline is set on the continent of Angara during their Industrial Revolution the technological level being at our 1940s. But with elves and dwarves. The novella _Hamar Noir_ is _Diesel Noir._ Although set during their Victorian era.
-   The flashback segments of Nick Harkaway's _Angelmaker_ have elements of this, particularly the train and submarine used by Edie's employers.
-   Arguably, _Atlas Shrugged_ (1957) which seems to be taking place in an Alternate Universe 1940s where WWII never happened, most of the world went Communist, and _someone_ invented, then destroyed, a futuristic power generator that converts atmospheric static electricity into direct current. The setting qualifies, but the theme is D'Punk inside out, with typical protagonist/antagonist roles reversed.
-   _Baccano!_ (2003-present)
-   The novel _Bitter Seeds_ (2010) by Ian Tregillis , which is set during a WW2 where psychic Nazi supers fight demon-summoning British blood-sorcerers. Quite GrimDark.
-   _Bone Song_ (2007) seasons this with heavy doses of Fantastic Noir and Urban Fantasy.
-   The _Clockwork Century_ series by Cherie Priest, an Alternate History American Civil War where the Republic of Texas discovered oil fifty years early. The Confederates are quite proud of their 'walker' which runs on diesel as opposed to the Steampunk Union verions. Coal-diesel engines are also used by paddlesteamers and the eponymous Cool Train in _Dreadnought_.
-   Ian McDonald's _Desolation Road_ (1988) and _Ares Express_ (2001) are a mix of this, Desert Punk and Cyberpunk with the non-city areas being Desert Punk and the cities being a mix of Diesel and Cyber.
-   Taylor Anderson's _Destroyermen_ (2008-) series is this mixed with Ocean Punk. Its titular heroes are the crew of a World War II destroyer that gets transported via a time-space rift to the Pacific Ocean of an Earth where the dinosaur-killing asteroid never hit and evolution took a different course.
-   _Doc Sidhe_ (1995, 2001) by Aaron Allston mixes dieselpunk with Urban Fantasy.
-   _Empire State_ (2012) by Adam Christopher is this taking place across several dimensions and times and combines Noir with Weird War as the eponymous Empire State is in a never ending war with a mysterious Enemy.
-   _The Ghost (2010)_ by George Mann takes place in a world that is moving from Steampunk (coal driven cars, airships) to this (biplanes with rocket boosters) with hints of Ray Gun Gothic (holographic statues and videophones).
-   Larry Correia's _Grimnoir Chronicles_ combines this, magic wielding mutants called Actives and Alternate History.
-   The _Hikūshi_ light novels with their emphasis on World War II-style air combat:
    -   _The Princess and the Pilot_
    -   _The Pilot's Love Song_
    -   _Toaru Hikuushi e no Seiyaku_
-   _The Iron Dream_ (1972) by Norman Spinrad
-   _Iskriget (The Ice War)_ (2011) by Swedish SF author Anders Blixt is an "antarctic" spy adventure taking place in an alternate 1940, in which German and Czech republicans rebel against the heavy-handed rule of the Habsburg emperor. It includes, among other genre attributes, diesel-electric Miyazaki-style cloudships and ice juggernauts.
-   Jonathan L. Howard's _Johannes Cabal_ series straddles this and Steam Punk.
    -   The first book, _Johannes Cabal the Necromancer_ (2009) is more Steam.
    -   The second book, _Johannes Cabal the Detective_ (2010) is more Deco Diesel.
-   _The King in Yellow_: A collection of loosely-connected early cosmic horror stories written in the 1890s, which projects "20 Minutes Into the Future" a weirdly dystopian world under Pax-Americana following an alternate-future world war, with a seemingly shining future corrupted instead by the unearthly influence of a mysterious, mind-shattering alien play, "The King in Yellow", with most of the stories in one way or another describing the impact of the play on doomed, mad, and despairing characters who succombed to the irresistable temptation to look upon its forbidden pages. The setting comes across today like Lovecraftian alt-history set in a strange sort of Diesel-Punk world of gigantic floating battleship-fortresses, friendly neighborhood suicide-booths for final relief of all the world's remaining ills, and an uneasy contrast between the shining light of utopian progress, and the secret influence of a foul, shadowy, otherworldly corruption just beneath the surface.
-   Though _Leviathan_ (2009) by Scott Westerfeld is definitely in the Steampunk genre by how it's presented and what kind of story it is, the Clanker technology is more dieselpunk, as they frequently use gas, oil, kerosene, and diesel, not just steam. Also, the Darwist's "beasties" are a good example of Bio Punk.
-   As with all subgenres, there is a _Mammoth Book of Dieselpunk_, edited by Sean Wallace.
-   Bruce Sterling's novella, _Pirate Utopia_ takes place in the city-state of Fiume, along the Italian/Yugoslavian border shortly after WWI, an anarchistic enclave where they experiment with death rays and radio guided missiles.
-   The planet Saraksh in _Prisoners of Power_ (1969), one of the Noon Universe novels of the Strugatsky Brothers. There are several dieselpunk Human Aliens civilizations in the series. Practically all of them are attempts at subtly criticising the state of Soviet society and the military during the Cold War era. One particularly disturbing case was the ironically-codenamed planet "Hope", which suffered from a severely polluted environment for years and was struck one day by a mysterious Depopulation Bomb. It's been a Ruins of the Modern Age Scavenger World ever since.
-   _Running with Rats_ is a dieselpunk fantasy about a group of rebels against a slave society.
-   _The Shape of Things to Come_: It might be unsurprising that the foundational sci-fi author H.G. Wells would have been ahead of the curve on an Unbuilt Trope version of Diesel-Punk, as he was on many other science fiction tropes: in this 1933 projection of the future of a world thrown into an apocalypse by a lengthy world war, one can find many of the Unbuilt tropes of many sci-fi subgenres, in a setting that today looks prescient of Diesel-Punk, and was (along with the 1936 film adaptation) doubtless heavily influential over the subgenre.
-   _Shattered Continent_.
-   _Six Chances_ is a dieselpunk fantasy featuring weapons fueled by vitae and psychic links between individuals who are on opposite sides of war that is on the horizon.
-   _Spacecraft of the First World War: A Compendium of Fighting Vessels of the Great Powers_ is a speculative fiction e-book by William Flogg, which is a sort of spin-off of _War of the Worlds_, set in the 1910's in the aftermath of the Martian Invasion and laid out like a vessel encyclopedia à la _Jane's Fighting Ships_; following the Martians' failed invasion, humanity gathered and reverse-engineered their leftover technology, utilizing it to create Anti-Gravity devices and interplanetary warships—_during the_ _World War One_ _era._
-   The _Tales of the Ketty Jay_ take place in a Magitek dieselpunk world of airships and jet fighters.
-   _Victoria: A Novel of 4th Generation War_ gradually develops into a Retro Universe based on this. By the end of the story, the Victorian state uses little "real" technology invented after the 1930s, but has still developed cold fusion, Tesla-tech and various other kinds of Super Science. They also make extensive use of zeppelins, politics and culture have a strong pre-World War II touch (including Nazis), and people dress in 1930s to 1950s fashion.

    Live Action TV 

-   _Caprica_ (2010): Syfy's _Battlestar Galactica_ spinoff is a mix of dieselpunk and cyberpunk. The in-story virtual game "New Cap City", which plays an important role in the series is pure Diesel Punk of the Noir variety.
-   In a _Fringe_ (2008-) episode, Brown Betty had a world straight out of the 1950s, yet everyone was using (Retraux) cell phones and computers. And Walter's lap took it to the next level.
-   _Gotham_: Diesel Noir to be precise. The series has a very 1930s-1940s aesthetic, but more modern devices like cell phones are common.
-   A 2013 mockumentary on The History Channel called "The Great Martian War" blended film footage from World War One with CG of Martian tripods. Watch some footage of it here. There was also a video game based on the film.
-   While the original book version of _His Dark Materials_ is generally regarded as describing its heroine Lyra’s world as Gaslamp Fantasy in style, the BBC/HBO adaptation goes for a _lot_ of Art Deco imagery (appropriately enough given all the passenger airships, which belong more in the 1930s than the Victorian age), creating something of a Dieselpunk feel overall.
-   _Tales of the Gold Monkey_ (1982-1983), a single-season series from The '80s of the Deco and Two-Fisted Tales variety.
-   In _Tin Man_ (2007), parts of the O.Z. (especially Central City) have a strongly dieselpunk aesthetic.
-   In 2010, Toyota created an ad series for their Avalon series that were decidedly dieselpunk. The first, "Train," was set in an art deco train station (complete with a Twentieth Century Limited-inspired locomotive), where the characters are wearing 1940s-inspired clothes and a cover of Mr. Sandman by Pomplamoose plays in the background. The second, "Plane," depicted men and women in 1940s-inspired aviation uniforms as a Douglas DC-3 flew in the background.

    Music 

-   The emerging musical genre known as Electro Swing captures the essence of dieselpunk through remixing vintage jazz-style music and swing with modern technology and house beats.
    -   For instance, the animated music video to "Rock It For Me" by Caravan Palace. It's pure dieselpunk, with a giant _The Iron Giant_\-inspired robot taking on an alien invasion, built in a factory eerily reminiscent of scenes from _Metropolis_.
-   Many modern swing and jazz revivalist bands who either faithfully recreate or apply contemporary twists to vintage music have also been considered part of the dieselpunk genre, such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Royal Crown Revue and Squirrel Nut Zippers. In 2019, swing-ska band the Cherry Poppin' Daddies released a song and music video entitled "Diesel Pun X", whose lyricism and musical/visual aesthetic draws directly from the dieselpunk genre.
-   Electric Light Orchestra's music video for "Hold On Tight" is a fourth wall-breaking tribute to pulp serials of the 30s and 40s.
-   The video for Michael Jackson's _Smooth Criminal_ was very dieselpunk, set in a speakeasy with flappers and gangsters, but with a lot of punk attitude and fantastic goings-on.
-   The video for Lady Gaga's _Alejandro_ is one-sixth this, one-sixth Ho Yay, one-sixth Those Wacky Nazis, and the rest is you know... Lady Gaga.
-   The Mechanisms were a dieselpunk cabaret band, which also incorporated various genres such as folk and jazz.
    -   Dr. Carmilla was the former frontwoman of The Mechanisms and self-described herself as incorporating Visual Kei.
-   Postmodern Jukebox creates covers of modern songs in the styles of the 1910s-1950s.
-   Therion's music video for "Initials BB" features dirigible battleships over what appears to be London, with ranks of scantily clad Germanic-uniformed women marching (and inexplicably flashing their breasts).

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Age of Steel_ is a game set in a world similar to ours in the 1920s, with diesel-powered mechs, airships and personal automatons being commonplace.
-   _Akroydiesel Age RPG_ is a dieselpunk game, complete with airships, anti-gravity dogfights, and diesel-powered mechs.
-   _AT-43_ the U.N.A., Red Blok, and the Karmans have this as part of their theme, while mixed with Cyberpunk which the Therians use. The setting is a typical space dystopia, albeit some what nicer that most.
-   _Call of Cthulhu_ (1981)
    -   _Masks of Nyarlathotep_
-   _Children of the Sun_ (2002).
-   _Cosmopol_ (2010) ... and how.
-   _Crimson Skies_ (1998)
-   _Daredevils_ (1982) by FGU.
-   _The Day After Ragnarok_: an After the End rpg where the Nazis manage to summon the Midgard Serpent at the end of World War 2. The giant serpent is killed when the Americans fly the Trinity Device into its eye on a suicide mission. Much of the world is devasated by the serpent's radioactive blood and venom and its body crushing most of Europe and North Africa. The surviving nations harvest strange elements from its body allowing some very dieselpunk developments, like jetpacks and Marconi pistols (a heat ray); magic and the supernatural make a comeback as well, mixing in elements for the most part deliberately mimicking Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories.
    -   In fact, there are several hints that the events of the Conan stories actually happened in this setting. Djehuti-Yamun, leader of the world-wide serpent cult known as the Children of Set, is heavily implied to be Thoth-Amon.
-   _Dust_, a series of wargames, based on Paolo Parente's comic and set in an alternate 1947 with walking tanks, energy weapons, superheroes, zombies and war-apes.
-   _Eberron_ (2004) has a Magitek version.
-   _Gear Krieg_ (2000), basically the same premise as _Weird WWII_
-   _GURPS Cliffhangers_ (1989) by Steve Jackson Games.
-   _Hollow Earth Expedition_ (2006) by Exile Games Studio. Two-Fisted Tales meet _The Lost World_.

-   The _Magic: The Gathering_ setting of New Capenna has one foot firmly in a Magitek take on this trope, complete with hovercars, energy weapons, and mind-bogglingly massive Art Deco architecture, all running on a not particularly ethical or sustainable powersource.
-   _Mutant Chronicles_ which is set in a dystopian future where Earth is abandoned, and most of the solar system is colonized by mega corps who derive their style from old Earth cultures, from Feudal times to Cold War era society.
-   _Operation: Fallen Reich_ (2009) by Fallen Publishing.
-   _Pulp Hero_ (2005) by Hero Games.
-   _Ravaged Earth_, a Savage Worlds setting by Reality Blurs. It is 30+ years after the Martian invasion, and the world has undergone drastic changes thanks to the effects of the alien metal the Martians' tripods were made of.
-   _Roan_ is a game with a setting based on _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, although with multiple divergences, one of the most explicit being the 1940's technological levels and the deliberate focus on pulp-style derring-do.
-   Despite _Rocket Age_ being Raygun Gothic, the Nazis have war-walkers based on Ancient Martian design and the airships also qualify.
-   _Rocketship Empires 1936_ (2008)
-   _Secrets of the Third Reich_ (2008), a World War II wargame by Westwind Productions, which has, amongst other things, mecha, powered armour, and vampires. To say nothing of the werewolves.
-   _Scythe_, based on the art of Jakub Rozalski.
-   _Trail of Cthulhu_.
-   In _Warhammer 40,000_ (1987), thanks to its Schizo Tech setting, the machines and equipment of the Imperial forces can have a very dieselpunky feel to them. For example, the Imperial Guard Leman Russ battle tank and the Imperial Navy Lightning<small>◊</small> fighter.
    -   The Orks' vehicles are a mix of this and a scrappy post-apocalyptic style. In particular, their aircraft tend to be scrap-encrusted pastiches of real-world designs from the 1940s and 1950s.
-   _Weird Wars_ (2001), a little-known World War II equivalent of _Deadlands_ .
-   _GURPS WWII: Weird War II_ (2003), World War II with Giant Tanks, Diesel-Powered Power Armor (though if you want, you can design it to use gasoline), Nazi Super Science, Soviet Super Science, Allied Super Science, _Japanese Super Science_, intercontinental bombers, psychic powers, conspiracies, flying saucers, aliens<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Death Rays, ray guns, conspiracies before the war, Kaiju, Mecha, Alternate Timelines<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , (non-superpowered) cannibals, super soldiers, a ton of different types of magic, conspiracies after the war, non-giant monsters, superheroes, high-tech jets, the Hollow Earth, and that's just scratching the tip of it. Some of the other WWII books edge into this with stuff like the Maus and other weapons and vehicles that never got produced or mass produced.

    Toys 

-   LEGO Adventurers (1998-2003)

    Video Games 

-   _Airfix Dogfighter_ (2000)
-   _Akai Katana_ (2010) takes place before or during World War II
-   Anamnesis
-   _Bendy and the Ink Machine_ is a First Person puzzle horror game based on the Inkblot Cartoon Style of animation of the 1930s, and is done in black and sepia tones.
-   The _BioShock_ series take place in a very distinctly Bio\-dieselpunk world, complete with analogue vacuum-tube computers/robots and a jaw-dropping Art Deco setting. It does not entirely fit any of the types above, as it is set in an abandoned (well, by anything we could reasonably call inhabitants) Underwater City and we do not know how different the surface world is. However, the setting does apply. Often erroneously referred to as steampunk, possibly because the hacking minigame in the first game involves flowing water, leading to some people to think they're powered by steam.
    -   _BioShock_ (2007)
    -   _BioShock 2_ (2010)
-   _Call of Duty: Zombies_ (2008, 2010) has some elements of World War II dieselpunk, namely the Wunderwaffen and Teleporters developed by the Nazis.
    -   The zombies level featured in the 4th DLC of _Call of Duty: Black Ops II_ takes this theme to a whole new level with a World War I setting featuring giant robots, wireless transmission of electricity, and a special zombie-operating Powered Armor that actually runs off of a diesel backpack.
    -   _Call of Duty: Black Ops III_ returns zombies with a distinctly Film Noir\-inspired yet patently dieselpunk setting.
-   In _Civilization: Beyond Earth_ units built by the Purity factions have a definite dieselpunk flair. Take a look at their tanks<small>◊</small>, their warships<small>◊</small> and their Airborne Aircraft Carrier the LEV Destroyer<small>◊</small>.
-   _Command & Conquer: Red Alert_ (1996)
-   _Crimson Skies_ (2000) all the way, to the point of being the Trope Codifier of this style in Video Games. Emphasis on dieselpunk Sky Pirates, Cool Planes and Cool Airships.
-   _Cuphead_ is likewise based on Inkblot Cartoon Style very evocative of _Merrie Melodies_ or _Betty Boop_, but is a colorful Run-and-Gun\-style game, and features a jazz score reminiscent of the era.
-   _Dino D-Day_ (2011): World War 2 meets _Jurassic Park_.
-   The _Dishonored_ series:
    -   _Dishonored_ (2012) has the rare In-Universe material Justifying the setting, a specially treated and processed "whale" oil known as trans. The substance itself would be identical to diesel if it wasn't luminous blue or incredibly volatile.
    -   _Dishonored 2_ continues with even more pseudo-magic clockwork machinery.
    -   _Dishonored: Death of the Outsider_ has an occult-driven Cyborg as a protagonist.
-   _Factorio_, an addictive factory-builder, uses a decidedly diesel punk aesthetic, which fits in quite nicely with all the pollution produced by many a factory players end up building. Among the non-period things rendered in the aesthetic include nuclear reactors, laser turrets and the rocket you launch to win the game.
-   _Fallout_ — Usually classified as atompunk, but takes place in a retrograde enough world to qualify (a world with atomic power but without the transistor<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ). It's actually deconstructed in that the inefficient technology ended up depleting resources faster, thus causing the conflicts that lead to The Great War.
    -   _Fallout_ (1997)
    -   _Fallout 2_ (1998)
    -   _Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel_ (2001)
    -   _Fallout: Van Buren_. Cancelled before its release in 2003.

    -   _Fallout 3_ (2008)
    -   _Fallout: New Vegas_ (2010)
    -   _Fallout 4_ (2015)
    -   _Fallout 76_
    -   There are also some _Fallout_ Fan Games with their own pages:
        -   _Fallout 1.5: Resurrection_ (2013)
        -   _Fallout: Sonora_ (2020)
-   _F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch_
-   _Gadget: Past as Future_ is a 1998 point-and-click adventure game set in an Art-Deco styled nation only known as "The Empire" where bits of meteorite that fell to the Earth containing an unknown substance (called xenium in the art book) became the country's primary fuel source to power not only some of the trains, but also many of the titular gadgets seen throughout such as the Sensorama, which was originally intended by the Empire's dictator to be a brainwashing device, and the Ark, an excavating drill that can transform into a plane. Players take on the role of a government agent hired to investigate a group of scientists who claim that a planet-destroying comet is rapidly approaching.
-   _Grandia_:
    -   The Port Town of Parm and the Garlyle Forces from the first _Grandia_ straddle a vague line between this and Steampunk.
    -   _Grandia Xtreme_: Nortis, of the Kaiserreich variety.
-   In Ross Smith's "Timeline" _Half-Life_ mod trilogy (c. 1999-2002), rogue Black Mesa scientists adapt teleporter technology for time travel, specifically to help the Nazis complete their Sänger AmerikaBomber and heavy water projects and conquer the United States. Gordon Freeman must stop the Nazi invasion of time itself.
-   _IL-2 Sturmovik_ (2001) offers a more realistic than Rule of Cool take on the aesthetic, justified by bits of actual WWII history.
-   _InSomnia: The Ark_ is a dystopian dieselpunk RPG that takes place in a decaying art deco space station.
-   _Iron Brigade_ (2011), best described as "World War I with Mecha — against an invasion of television monsters."
-   _Iron Grip_ (2006)
-   _Iron Harvest_ is a Real-Time Strategy game set the same universe as _Scythe_.
-   _Iron Storm_ (2002) is set in 1964, in an Alternate History setting where World War I never ended. You'll see televisions and helicopters, while fighting in trenches and mud. Also, the weaponry is fictional but credible for alternate technology from the 1950-1960s.
-   While borrowing more Cyberpunk themes, _Jak and Daxter_ certainly contains Dieselpunk aesthetics, most prominent are the zoomers. Haven City also has some of this aesthetic.
-   _March of War_: While atomic does appear in this MMOTBS, it is exclusively as a special superweapon project. The rest of the technology is entirely rooted in dieselpunk themes, albiet with... modifications for some of the factions.

-   Parodied in the _Metal Slug_ series, which (although ostensibly taking place 20 Minutes into the Future) are set in a bizarre version of WWII(with some Korean/Vietnam-era trimmings), where propeller-powered planes, railway guns, and zeppelins coexist with Humongous Mecha, Land Battleships (literally a _Yamato_\-class battleship with tank treads bolted on), Zeerust aliens, and Wave Motion Guns.
    -   In the seventh entry, the villains are a time-traveling army from the future . . . still driving the same WWII-era vehicles, except now they're painted blue and shoot laser beams.
    -   Same thing applies for the 2021 remake, _Metal Slug Code J_.
-   _Nazi Zombies_ had ended its _Call of Duty: Black Ops II_ DLC line with Origins, a very much dieselpunk World War I setting. Giant Mechas, diesel-powered armor, perk drinks, tanks, and weaponry. All of this makes the return of the original crew from earlier games so much more awesome. And of course, the main appeal, the antagonists.
-   _Nocturne_ (1999) revolves around 1930s pulp heroes fighting off mad science and Lovecraftian monsters in a very dieselpunk mode.
-   _Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-slick Precipice of Darkness_ is about an Occult Detective agency battling Eldritch Abomination Gods in an Anachronism Stew version of 1920s America overrun with oil-and-clockwork powered robots and mad cultists. It couldn't possibly be any _more_ dieselpunk!
-   _Power Strike II_ (1993), a Sega Master System Vertical Scrolling Shooter by Compile, released only in Europe and Australia (not to be confused with the Game Gear title of the same name, also by Compile, which is a completely different, more conventional space shooter). The main character is a bounty hunter, whose job is to shoot down Sky Pirates in an alternate 1930s setting.
-   _Progear_ (2001) has technology somewhere between World War I and World War II.
-   _Pulp Adventures_ is a Two-Fisted Tales story set in the Thirties and its Massive Multiplayer Crossover roster of available party members includes the Rocketeer, as well as Nazis with jetpacks.
-   In the _Resistance_ series, WWI ended differently and WWII never happened. Unfortunately, Asia and Europe got invaded by aliens instead.
-   Outerlight Ltd.'s _The Ship: Murder Party_ (2006), a very warped tale set in an art deco cruise liner.
-   _Silent Storm_ (2003) starts as a relatively realistic game focussed on managing a commando team during World War II (there are an Axis and an Allies campaign), then it switches to a plot involving a Thor Hammer Organisation (THO), Nebulous Evil Organization supplying both sides with Energy Weapons and Powered Armors, in order to weaken them enough to be able to Take Over the World by themselves. Its first sequel, the expansion pack _Silent Storm: Sentinels_, is set not long after the end of the war and features the eponymous Sentinels as a secret multinational (party members from both sides of the previous game are available) organisation struggling against THO, while the high technology is still there.
-   _The Sinking City_ combines dieselpunk tropes with Lovecraftian horror.
-   _Skullgirls_ (2012) definitely draws on the dieselpunk aesthetic, although the makers prefer to call it Dark Deco.
-   _The Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces_ (2008), a video game for Nintendo Wii loosely based on the anime The Sky Crawlers.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab_ starts off with a Ratfinks-inspired level, named _Diesel Dreaming_, where SpongeBob races against Nightmare Face versions of Patrick, Plankton, and Gary.
-   _Douglas Adams' Starship Titanic_ is thoroughly suffused with Art Deco, from the design of the starliner itself to its robot staff. Better still, it actually uses Dieselpunk motifs such as pneumatic tubes.
-   _Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor_ (2012) shifts to a WWII Punk setting...in 2082. Justified in that microprocessors are no longer in production due to silicon-eating microbes appearing as early as 2020, hence the technological regression.
-   _Tales of Xillia_: The world of Elympios that you visit fairly late in the first game and where much of the sequel takes place is a decaying land where the dingy cities are full of skyscrapers, and the background music is heavy on jazzy saxophones. Its largest city (and only city in the first game), Trigleph, looks like it was pulled straight out of a Film Noir hard-boiled detective movie.
-   _Tower 57_
-   _Turning Point: Fall of Liberty_ (2008)
-   The retro-cult Taerkastens from _Urban Assault_, are a 26th century version of this. Since the Taerkastens eschew electronics and related tech, they use propeller powered war planes and giant zeppelins when the other factions are using more standard futuristic units. But what they lack in the electronics department, they more than make up for by being on the leading edge of engineering and material design. The Taerkastens have the most heavily armored units in the game.
-   The _Valkyria Chronicles_ series of games is based in an alternate reality continent of Europa, loosely based on WWII Europe. "Ragnite ore" takes the place of petroleum in the game, which is centered on the small country of Gallia, a state rich in said ore, and sought after by the Atlantic Federation and the East Europan Imperial Alliance (roughly, the Allies and the Axis).
    -   _Valkyria Revolution_
-   The _Wolfenstein_ games.
    -   _Castle Wolfenstein_ (1981)
    -   _Beyond Castle Wolfenstein_ (1984)
    -   _Wolfenstein 3-D_ (1992)
    -   _Spear of Destiny_ (1992)
    -   _Return to Castle Wolfenstein_ (2001)
    -   _Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory_ (2003)
    -   _Wolfenstein_ (2009)
    -   _Wolfenstein: The New Order_ (2014) is a Diesel Dystopia set in a world where the Nazis have won.
    -   _Wolfenstein: The Old Blood_ (2015)
    -   _Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus_ (2017) continues the dystopian tale of the New Order.
-   _World of Tanks_ is set in the period in which this genre is set and many of the vehicles never came off of the drawing board.
    -   Same applies for _World of Warships_.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

    Western Animation 

-   _Archer Dreamland_, the eighth season of _Archer_, takes the super-spies cum drug lords cum detectives back to 1940s Los Angeles.
    -   But even more dieselpunkish than _Archer: Dreamland_ is the parent series' _next_ season, _Archer Danger Island_, a pulp adventure that winds back the clock some more to the late 1930s (this is all a coma dream in the real Archer's head), set mostly on a French-colonial Polynesian Pacific island.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_ (1992-1995, 1997-1999). To a lesser extent _Superman: The Animated Series_ keeps some of Superman's timeless feel from the 30/40's.
-   _Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines_ could be considered a humorous take on this concept, with its pseudo-World War I setting and outrageous aircraft designs.
-   _The Legend of Korra_ (2012-2014), a sequel series to _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, is a Far East Science Fantasy, Urban Fantasy variant of this, complete with power plants being staffed by people with lighting powers. It's particularly apparent in Republic City, a Culture Chop Suey of various 1920s-era metropolises with the Asian aesthetics accentuated. The soundtrack has been described as "1920s New Orleans jazz but if it were invented in China".
    -   And just like that, it takes more books until the punk's theme and aesthetics eventually appears through most of Book 3 until with Book 4 finally become thing in the universe both technologically and politically with dieselpunk-style giant Mecha that avatar crew face with.
-   _Mr. Hublot_: Everything is mechanical—Mr. Hublot, the dog, the flies that the dog tries to catch, Mr. Hublot's flowers. The robot people fly to work via propellers in their heads. Yet the cars and the architecture have a 1950s flavor.
-   _My Life as a Teenage Robot_ (2002-2006). Though it's a little more leaning towards Raygun Gothic than Diesel.
-   Second episode of season 3 from _Rick and Morty_ have main plot to explore a dimension that Human civilization has already destroyed while ago and focuses on _Mad Max_ Raiders with their lives and their dieselpunk cars.
-   The Disney cartoon _TaleSpin_ (1990-1991) and its 1930s pulp adventure style was a high-flying, lighthearted brand of diesel.
-   _What If…? (2021)_, in an episode giving an alternate look at the above mentioned _Captain America: The First Avenger_, expands on it by having Iron Man's father building a suit of armor similar to his during World War II, nicknamed "HYDRA Stomper".

    Real Life 

-   Britain's failed death ray, an ambitious project which laid the foundational principals for modern radar in the process of trying to figure out if a practical death ray was possible with then-current technology.
-   Since Doctor Steel was a Steampunk musician who leaned on dieselpunk tropes as well, it isn't surprising to see a lot of dieselpunk fashion sense in the uniforms of the Army of Toy Soldiers.
-   Those Wacky Nazis designed a series of "superweapons" termed _Wunderwaffe_ (German for "wonder weapon") before and during World War II. Many of them were outlandish and never made it past the prototype stage, but in retrospect were heavily dieselpunk in their design. In fact, many dieselpunk aesthetics are inspired or pulled directly from _Wunderwaffe_ designs, such as those featured in _Captain America: The First Avenger_. Let's take a closer look at a few shall we?
-   A lot of WWII tech of the type actually used also qualifies. Prime examples include the Avro Lancaster, Catalina, many tanks including the Char B1-bis, Grant, Matilda, and Vickers (and most tanks, particularly British ones, really), and the khaki or black uniforms, with their peaked caps, berets, or Brodie helmets. Pretty much all early war British equipment would count.
-   The GM Futurliners, a set of bus-sized art deco vehicles used as a traveling museum presenting the wonders of 1940-50's era technology.
