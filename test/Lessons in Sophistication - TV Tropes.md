**Pops:** Why, I bet you I can turn Johnny from simian to sophisticate by next Tuesday!

**Karl:** And the loser has to perform a Mexican hat dance for twenty-four hours straight!

**Johnny:** _(balancing spoons on his face)_ Hey, look at me - I'm spoon man!

**Pops:** _(beat)_ Better make that Wednesday.

Being a cultured and classy individual doesn't always come naturally. Sometimes you need lessons — Lessons In Sophistication. These may include instruction in the world history, deportment and etiquette classes that teach good posture and regal carriage, education about proper forms of address for nobles and diplomats, what to wear, and relevant trade skills to whatever your craft may be. For women especially, this may including dance lessons and other high class forms of sport and entertainment. All the kinds of things a Proper Lady at court, or Quintessential British Gentleman would need to know to carry themselves in the presence of both great and small. Doubly necessary if she's a common girl with a Really Royalty Reveal, and now needs to act the part of a Princess Classic.

But do people _appreciate_ these lessons? Hardly. They'll probably find the manners stiff and antiquated, the history dry and uninteresting, and the deportment painful and unnecessary. If she's a Rebellious Princess, or a former Street Urchin, she may sneak out of her lessons or openly refuse to participate.

Since traditional "proper" gender roles for women tend to be seen as repressive, a female protagonist's story is usually on the side of the "uncultured", cheering on her attempt to challenge tradition, chronicling her pursuit of more relevant skills, and capping it off with a moral about the importance of staying true to yourself. Because of the lament that "chivalry is dead" for young men it tends to be encouraged that they accept the old ways. This could mean becoming more like a Gentleman and a Scholar.

As the trope continued to develop, the formula became so recognizable that the plot may actually punish the women and men alike for their School Is for Losers attitude, throwing in a twist by having something from the Lessons in Sophistication be a Chekhov's Skill that becomes improbably necessary to the plot, or even just genuinely useful if she decides to take her role in society seriously. It is related to Royal School (where those lessons are taken).

-   The princess lessons thing is used for contrast in _A Song of Ice and Fire_. The Stark sisters, Sansa and Arya, receive them.

    Webcomics

    Western Animation 

-   Surprisingly, Toph Beifong from _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ does this—she was born in Earth Kingdom High Society, so she does know how to act like a Proper Lady (she simply chooses not to). She's able to help clean up Katara for a palace party hosted by the Earth King but she doesn't even attempt with Sokka and Aang. They're hopeless.
-   _Carmen Sandiego:_
    -   While being raised on V.I.L.E. island, likely Carmen received these lessons in her youth when being tutored, or as part of her classes in thief school.
    -   Carmen must later give Zack these lessons in "The Duke of Vermeer Caper," when V.I.L.E. agent Dash Haber arrives early to a meeting and is looking for "The Duchess," an alias Carmen is using, but Zack opens the door and improvises himself as "The Duke." These lessons range from table manners, to art history, and to diction lessons so Zack won't speak with his native Bostonian accent.
-   _The Flintstones_: Fred goes through one of these to become "Frederick J. Mumblemumble" so he can hang out with the snooty wealthy of Bedrock on their own territory.
-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_: In "My So-Called Wife", Mr. Herriman has to teach Coco how to behave like a lady when a rich benefactor thought that she was his wife and the two were invited into his mansion for the charity. All the while, Mac teaches Bloo what sarcasm means.
-   _Hey Arnold!_: The episode "Polishing Rhonda" had Rhonda and Big Patty signed up for a finishing school by their parents when the two of them got into a scuffle in school. Rhonda fared poorly due to her Spoiled Brat tendencies, while Patty excelled. Rhonda eventually goes to Patty for help and the two ultimately pass.
    -   Done again in an episode with Helga trying to gain the attentions of Arnold by striving to be more ladylike—specifically, like Lila (who Arnold was crushing on at the time). She even seeks out Lila for these kinds of lessons—the two of them practice kindness towards others, going to operas, dressing properly, and curtsying.
-   The _House of Mouse_ short "How to Be a Gentleman" has Goofy undergoing these, with mixed (and hilarious) results. Like saying "My queer Dean, delighted to acquaint your maintenance" to the Queen of England (as his _second_ attempt; "Heya, Liz" was right out), and trying to get into a "Country Club" by wearing overalls and slinging a giant wooden bat over his shoulder—"I'm country! And I got a club!"
-   Wendy took such lessons in an episode of _The Legend of White Fang_. Notably, during her first attempt to bake a cake, she used all the yeast she had.
-   _Recess_ had an episode where the Ashleys challenge Tomboy Spinelli to a Beauty Pageant. Bizarrely, sports loving Vince is the hyper-competent coach schooling Spinelli in how to win in a Pageant. His justification is that his characterization is hyper-competitive and will learn how to win at _**any**_ competition; he's meticulously studied Beauty Pageants just in case one of his friends was challenged to win one. Ultimately, Spinelli wins by explaining to the judges that her rehearsed lines weren't really who or what she's all about, and they in turn find it refreshing that for once, someone isn't using the same cliched lines.
-   _Sofia the First_ has six-year-old Princess Sofia, who was Adopted into Royalty after her commoner-mother gets remarried to a king (both Sofia's mom and the King were widowed in previous marriages). She's ultimately enrolled at a princess school with other international princesses—and unlike most examples of this trope, Sofia genuinely likes it.
    -   In the last season, Sofia has to pass these lessons on to her tomboy partner Crysta, a fairy who never earned her wand due to not being dainty enough. Crysta is initially resistant, but finds she enjoys the validation that comes with fitting in with other fairies and manages to find a middle ground.
-   In the _Sonic Boom_ episode, "My Fair Sticksy", when Sticks gets nominated for an Awardy Award, Amy decides to teach her how to be more lady-like so that people will see her more as a lady than as a feral badger, especially around her, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. Although Sticks doesn't really get the hang of any of it, Sonic decides to escort her so that he can keep an eye on her. After the Awardy Award both Sticks and Dr. Eggman were nominated for gets awarded to Leroy the Turtle, Eggman takes out his anger by attacking Sonic and his friends. Sticks tries to remain ladylike at first, but when her friends all get captured, she decides to go back to her old ways, and in the end, it saves her friends.
-   Played straight and subverted in an episode of the short-live animated series, _The Wuzzles_. Butterbear and Crock have a wager that she can teach his slovenly henchbeast, Brat, to be a proper gentleman for an important party and succeeds. The subversion comes when her friends (after getting scolded by Butterbear for their lack of good manners and are forced to learn classy behavior in time for the same party) go find a book on how to be classier, Crock overhears them and thinks the book is for Butterbear in teaching Brat, and puts the title of a book on classy behavior on a book for "teaching 'bad manners'". Instead of learning how to be proper, they're taught to behave even worse.
