Fangs for the memories!

_"And when she was doing it, I_ liked _it, Ben. That's the hellish part. I actually had an erection. Can you believe it? If you hadn't been here to pull her off, I would have... would have let her..."_

When a vampire is hungry and isn't quite so decent or hard up as to lower himself to only buying blood at the butcher's or trapping and draining small animals instead, their dietary supplement of preference is human blood. They can survive on the blood of lesser beings, sure, but human blood is the good stuff — it's the difference between artificial processed cheese food and genuine aged cheddar as a human palate would comprehend it.

The decent sort of Friendly Neighborhood Vampires tend to feel bad about what they must do to their victims. Kiss of the Vampire is vampires who can make the experience of being a drink box not just bearable, but pleasurable for the donor.

Vampires who are in love with their partner fall under this category, as do the ones who tend to regret being undead creatures of the night who must drink blood to survive, though it is not a strict limit. The effect of the bite and draining being pleasant to the victim also may depend on the vampire's circumstances. If the undead blood drinker is injured, enraged, or starved, the effect may not be enough to counteract the pain of a crazed vampire's attack. The vampire may flip out completely and savage the victim. This may lead to Angst when the vampire comes back to his senses and realizes he went outside his preferred mode of behaviour.

This is often justification for the Fridge Logic question, why do the victims always stop struggling when the vampire bites them?

Naturally, common aversions occur in family fare involving Vampires. The bite isn't painful, but it is rarely portrayed as overtly sensual or orgasmic either.

See Our Vampires Are Different. See also Vampire Bites Suck for the vampires who don't have the type of consideration shown here. For extra horror, go for _both._ I.e., it's bloody, messy, deadly...and you're enjoying every second of it. If the vampire also gets turned on by feeding on blood, then they're Hemo Erotic. A person seeking the kiss is likely a Voluntary Vampire Victim. See Bite of Affection for biting a loved one without the need of being a vampire.

Not to be confused with the 1963 Hammer Horror film _The Kiss of the Vampire_.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   The bite of the tiny vampire Shinobu-chan from _Bakemonogatari_ is unusually graphic by anime standards with regards to the unhealing bloody holes she leaves in Koyomi's neck, but the way she sits on his lap while drinking and he pats her back to let her know when to stop is _adorable_.
-   Vampire bites in _Black Blood Brothers_ are depicted as very pleasurable, so much so that a woman will squirm and moan orgasmically as she is being fed upon. One character even goes so far as to say that sex pales in comparison to being bitten.
-   Though it is only mentioned once, Nathan from _Blood+_ points out that it is "pure bliss" to have Diva drinking his blood.
-   Jean-Marais in _Dance in the Vampire Bund_ describes sucking blood and having one's blood sucked as the ultimate pleasure, against which human intercourse "pales in comparison." As if the rape overtones of his newly turned followers "gang-draining" several unwilling schoolgirls and a _nun_ were not blatant enough.
-   In _Diabolik Lovers_ (the anime, episode 2), Ayato kisses Yui before biting her while she is drowning underwater.
-   _Genesis of Aquarion_ does a variant of this trope- Hot-Blooded protagonist Apollo at one point offers to feed the Really 700 Years Old crippled vampire his blood, and notes that it has a rather relaxing effect. Love Interest Sylvia is not pleased, but tries to hide it (poorly).
-   Subverted in _Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics_ episode "The Crystal Ball," although it is a wicked witch, not a vampire, who routinely bites the neck of an innocent princess, in one of the most cruel and sadistic scenes ever imaginable. The princess also turns into a corpse afterwards, and somehow regenerates.
-   _Hellsing_ has very few cases of this, as normally Vampire Bites Suck and Alucard's victims tend to have their whole damn throats ripped out once he sinks his fangs in, however when fighting Rip Van Winkle, her death scene becomes extremely sexual as Winkle gets a Luminescent Blush when Alucard bites her and she starts gasping<small>◊</small>.
    -   The gonzo anime played it completely straight with Seras getting turned into a Draculina, Alucard gently bites her neck... he even kisses her.
-   Episode 5 of _Is This A Zombie?_ starts with vampire ninja Sera literally kissing Haruna on the lips then biting her on the neck. The kiss apparently acts as an anesthetic so that the bite won't be painful.
-   In _Karin_, Vampire bites suck out emotional states. Most of the Maaka/Marker family suck out things like dishonesty, stress, and unhappiness, which gives the human "victims" a healthy boost to their mental state. Of course, then it turns out Elda sucks out _love_, at which point things stop being so fun.
-   _Master Of Mosquiton_: In most cases, Mosquiton's bite only causes Inaho to blush. But when he bites her to empower himself, near the end of episode 2, it causes her to visibly achieve orgasm; making her go weak-kneed and slump to the floor, panting.
-   In _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_, this is Lady Bat's power, which he uses to put his opponents into a daze before singing. He even refers to biting people as "kissing".
-   In _Midnight Secretary_, according to Kyouhei, blood tastes better when partner has an orgasm. Even more so if one falls in love.
-   _My Monster Secret_ plays this literally. When Asahi sees Youko eating a normal lunch and asks about blood-drinking, she gets offended and calls it sexual harassment. Afterwards she explains that blood-sucking is an incredibly intimate act among vampires, and is sometimes used in place of a kiss at vampire weddings. Later chapters take it a step further, with Akane Trolling drops a bombshell by telling the couple that blood-drinking is more akin to _sex_, and compares Youko to a sexual predator taking advantage of a naive girl. Despite her trolling, she's actually correct: vampires can even reproduce via blood-sucking, and by the end of the series Youko is pregnant with Asahi's child. Her vampire father Genjuro is surprisingly understanding and admits that he never told Youko because he was too uncomfortable having The Talk with her.
    -   The gag is referenced a few chapters later when the pair goes to an amusement park's Haunted House. An employee dressed as a vampire leaps out and shouts "I vant to suck your blood!", but gets shouted down by an offended Youko and slinks away in embarrassment.
-   Evangeline A.K. Mcdowell of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, because of her small state, usually delivers more-or-less painless drinks of blood. Then other times, she really does deliver kisses, also more-or-less painless. Whether she'll admit it or not, she does care about her apprentice. Earlier in that same scene, she played this as straight as possible in what could be the most risque scene in the course of the series (NSFW, obviously). <sup>*&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Nightwalker_, vampire bites give sexual pleasure if Yayoi's behavior is any indication. The show also has a literal example of a kiss from a vampire, transferring blood by mouth apparently as part of the process of turning someone into a vampire. That was more of an Emergency Transformation than anything else.
-   _Night Warriors: Darkstalker's Revenge_ plays both versions of this with Demitri and Morrigan, the first time is during their initial fight when Demitri (in his bat-form) bites Morrigan's neck which causes her to react in pain leaving four big bite marks. The second time is when Morrigan finds Demitri after Pyron defeated him, as she approaches Demitri gets up and bites her but this time it becomes sensual with Morrigan reacting in pleasure.
-   Inverted by Ageha of _Omamori Himari_. Sucking Yuuto's blood gets her aroused (or more precisely, the demon slayer power in it does). Also subverted in that she made him unconscious first.
-   Moka Akashiya of _Rosario + Vampire_, who gives one of these almost every chapter early on (with a distinctive "kapuchuu~" in the Animated Adaptation, personified as a kiss - actually, it's a two-part action, as "kapu" is the sound of a bite and "chu~" is that of a kiss), followed by Tsukune Aono not particularly enjoying getting his blood drained. However, he's not particularly harmed either: after the first time, he still has enough energy to run around in a panic. Humorously, she still likes to do this even after Tsukune becomes a vampire like her, as shown in the series epilogue. The narration even calls her a cannibal.
-   _Seraph of the End_:
    -   Krul literally kisses Mika on the mouth to turn him into a vampire. It was painful at first, but after that he found it immorally pleasurable and was unable to control his thirst for her blood, to the extent he drank from her everyday for 4 years until Krul was forced to part with him.
    -   The light novels describe vampire biting as pleasant for both the vampire and the one they are biting. It explains why Yuu and Mika blush when they have their biting scene.
-   In _Shiki_ vampire bites don't seem to be particularly painful (Masao even looked like he might have been enjoying it a bit in episode 5) and the bite marks aren't very severe (a doctor mistakes them for insect bites). Also, it's speculated by Toshio that the bites might inject a narcotic substance into the victim to keep them under control. It should be noted that while bites don't cause any immediate harm, multiple drainings can lead to death.
-   There's Hazuki and Kouhei in _Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase_ with Hazuki doing all the vampire kissing. Even Elfriede does this to Kouhei, as well.
-   The bite of _Vampire Princess Miyu_ is effectively a Lotus-Eater Machine - those bitten are permanently captured in a delusional fantasyland of pure joy and happiness. She usually deals it out to humans who've just barely survived a traumatic encounter with the Shinma she hunts, thus making it a sort of 'mercy'. Still doesn't change the fact that they'll spend the rest of their lives staring empty-eyed into the wall, though.
-   _Vassalord_ features Charley, who lives off the blood of his (similarly vampire) master Johnny. Johnny enjoys being bitten enough that he once hauls Charley into the airplane lavatory for a quickie. As if they didn't have enough UST Ho Yay already.

    Comic Books 

-   Subverted in _American Vampire_: after fighting under the new moon, Pearl's left weak and incredibly thirsty so Henry lets her feed off of him. She does make it up to him, though. Blood must been an aphrodisiac for them.
-   Fables spin-off _Fairest_ has this with Tomoko. Technically, she's a Kitsune rather than a vampire, but she feeds on her lovers' blood, and her sex scenes with Rapunzel certainly fit this trope, being neat little punctures that appear to be intensely pleasurable for both parties. When feeding off Jack, however, it's much messier, more violent, less enjoyable, and would have killed him without his regenerative abilities, so maybe she only uses this trope with partners about whom she actually cares.
-   In Purgatori's backstory, she was turned into a vampire by being bit in the breast by her sire Rath. Her reaction was rather... loud and ecstatic.
-   Screamqueen's bite in _Scare Tactics (DC Comics)_ seems to have this effect (at least, when she wants it to).

    Fan Works 

-   _The Bloomer Lady_: Non sexual version in this (book) Dracula version as one of the kids vampire!Lucy drank from, the way the story is told it seems the kid felt calmed and peaceful.
-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Smurphony Of The Night", Lord Vladimir Smurfula seduces Smurfette with his Mind-Control Music to get her to fall in love with him so that he could apply his first bite on her.
-   The _Rosario + Vampire_ fic _Here In My Arms_ explicitly declares vampire bites to be pleasurable. When the newly-vampirized Tsukune bites Mizore, the experience gives her an orgasm, and when Kurumu is bitten, her response:
    
    **Kurumu**: I think I just lost my virginity.
    
-   At least one _Kingdom Hearts_ fan-fic has Sora discovering his vampire "costume" acts a little differently when he visits Halloween Town with Riku and Kairi.
    
    **Kairi:** You really shouldn't wear him out like that too often. If you get hungry again, you should probably switch off between the two of us.
    
    **Riku:** Great, encourage him. We'll be lucky if we don't need a transfusion when we leave here.
    
-   In _Nosflutteratu_, Rainbow Dash tells Twilight that being fed upon feels good in a weird way.
-   Not sure if this counts, but there's one Sherlock fanfic, _Stranger at the Gate_, where vampires need to drink human blood before they get erections and, by extension, have sex. Once John figures out Sherlock's a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire, there is a bit of Kiss of the Vampire going on.
-   Another Sherlock Holmes example in the fanfic _L’arbore di Diana (In Diana’s Garden)_ where Watson feeds a starved-crazed vampire Sherlock with his blood and describes it as tender, warm experience. Holmes's usual method of feeding (usually on human criminals) is more a case of Vampire Bites Suck but the reason Watson finds it so pleasurable is because he offered his blood to Holmes out of love.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   One of the _Blade_ films showed a couple of vamps putting razor blades in their mouths before making out.
    -   The first film had Blade feeding on the female sidekick in a moment of desperation. At first she stoically endures the pain, but after a minute or two she's clinging to him, moaning while he kind of...growls.
    -   Possibly occurs in the third film; the goth girl Drake attacks struggles initially, but once he actually gets his fangs in her, there is an audible change in the tone of her scream, and she seems to be pulling him closer to her rather than pushing him away.
-   In _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, vampires were able to hypnotize their prey into either not minding or not reacting to the bite.
-   _Deadtime Stories: Volume 1_: Implied in "House Call". Mrs Norman tells Dr. Marsten that one of the neighbour girls has been meeting Jimmy in the orchard and allowing him to suck her blood. The cut shows her seeming to enjoy this process immensely.

-   The Hammer Horror films, especially the ones with Christopher Lee as Dracula, have the victims get all... breathless... as a vampire bites down on their exposed necks.
-   In _Interview with the Vampire_ a prostitute is lying there contentedly enjoying Lestat's attentions to her breast until she looks down and realizes she's bleeding out from him being something of a messy eater.
-   _Kiss of the Damned_: Paolo seems to find Djuna's bite pleasurable as she feeds on him (they're having sex at the same time, granted).
-   The prostitute bitten by the Master vampire in _John Carpenter's Vampires_ certainly seems to be enjoying herself when Vladek is between her legs.
-   _Love at First Bite_: The woman being bitten by Dracula seems to be (based on the sounds she's making) in the throes of, if not an orgasm, than something just about as good. The scene just afterward builds upon the implication that it was the equivalent of good sex.
-   Subverted in _Near Dark_, where Mae starts out kissing Caleb in a moderately-sexy way, but he cries out in pain and pulls away from her when her teeth actually break skin.
-   In _Once Bitten_, the vampire's bite was accompanied by euphoria and partial amnesia. He couldn't remember much about the prior night. In this case, she's not biting him in the neck, but on the inner thigh, because it's "closer to the source" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  This causes problems for his buddies later when looking for a bite mark, because grabbing a fellow student in the shower to closely examine his crotch tends to give one a reputation that's difficult to live down.
-   _Queen of the Damned_ is an interesting example. While some of the victims in the film do not seem to struggle and are visibly enjoying their bite, others are screaming in pain and definitely NOT enjoying it. Apparently it depends on how vicious the vampire goes about his biting.
-   _Theresa & Allison_: Some of the humans the vampires bite enjoy it, and agree to this on a continuous basis.
-   _Vampire's Kiss_: Peter comes to enjoy being bitten and fed on by Rachel, coming back for more multiple times. It may just be all in his mind however.

    Literature 

-   A vampire's bite in the _Anita Blake_ series is as painful as you might expect, unless the vampire put the victim into a trance beforehand, in which case it feels really good. Except for Asher. His bite is of the orgasmic variety. Victims can become addicted to Asher's bite, and can experience flashbacks of the feelings said bite causes.
-   In J.R. Ward's _Black Dagger Brotherhood_ series, this is almost always the case. Regardless of the combo (vampire/vampire, vampire/human, vampire/sympath... you get the idea). The vampires almost always find the feeding experience pleasurable, and it's specifically described in _Lover Eternal_ that the act of Rhage drinking from a vampire woman named Layla had "a shocking level of intimacy." This deserves special mention because he was desperately trying _not_ to feel anything for her. He wanted to feed from the human woman he'd fallen in love with, Mary, but since she wasn't of his kind and it's impossible to "turn" a human, he would've killed her before his body regained the nourishment it needed.
-   In Tanya Huff's _Blood Books_, Henry generally feeds by taking blood from his partners during sex. They usually don't even notice.
    -   It's also plainly erotic for the victim, even for those with Incompatible Orientation, as Vicki and a (male) friend discover when they force him to drink from them to save himself.
-   In the _Bloodline_ series, vampire bites are revealed to be intensely pleasurable experiences, comparable to sex. Even unwilling victims will melt into a puddle as they’re bitten. And for the vampire doing the biting, it goes beyond just simple feeding- it’s explicitly an intimate and sensual experience for them as well.
-   Vampire bites in Moore's _Bloodsucking Fiends_ aren't particularly painful and heal quickly, thanks to a minor healing agent in their saliva (which Tommy then attempts to convince Jody to use on his stubbed toe, with very little success). If the vampire is clever enough, they can even feed without the victim noticing at all — Tommy assumed that Jody was giving him a hickey until she pointed out the blood on her teeth and flat out _told_ him what she was doing.
    -   The sexual connotations are subverted in the sequel. Because she turned Tommy, she has to find sources of blood other than her boyfriend. After reluctantly feeding on a passed-out homeless man with a huge cat, the following conversation occurs:
        
        **Tommy**: How was it?  
        **Jody**: How do you think it was? It was necessary.  
        **Tommy**: Well, I mean, when you used to bite me it was kind of a sexual thing.  
        **Jody**: Oh right. I planned all this because I wanted to fuck the huge cat guy.
        
-   _Carmilla_: Laura (who is not aware that she is being fed on by a vampire, and who thinks she is just having bad dreams) perceives Carmilla's bites in a semi-conscious state as "a hand \[...\] drawn softly along my cheek and neck", followed by a feeling "as if warm lips kissed me, and longer and more lovingly as they reached my throat, but there the caress fixed itself". Despite Carmilla's apparent wish to make her bite painless, maybe even pleasurable to Laura, this is not truly successful; the actual bite (which is not felt by Laura) induces physical reactions that are evocative of orgasm ("my heart beat faster, my breathing rose and fell rapidly and fully drawn"), only to pass over into "a sense of strangulation", a "dreadful convulsion", and loss of consciousness.
-   In Mercedes Lackey's _Children of the Night_, the vampire doesn't even have to be conscious for this to kick in. The heroine suggests it's a survival mechanism, to make sure the food doesn't get away too soon. In fact, when the vampire is unconscious, it induces overwhelming pleasure to the point of the heroine almost passing out, whereas when the vampire is conscious, he says it's possible to tone it down.
-   Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' _Den of Shadows_, Nyeusigrube vampire bites are generally enjoyable, but if a bitten human struggles they have the potential to become a very strong vampire. There is a vampire bloodline that specifically only turns humans if they fight. Two of her books are narrated by vampires in that line (Risika of _In the Forests of the Night_ and split between Aubrey and Jessica in _Demon In My View_).
-   The kiss/bite of the vampire is an analogy for rape in Bram Stoker's _Dracula_ novel. Instead of trying to seduce Mina Harker like Carmilla did with Laura, Dracula tricks one of the mental patients in Dr. Seward's house into inviting him in and physically forces Mina to drink his blood against her will, leaving the traumatized girl to go through periods of denial, anger, and depression while viewing what she suffered that night as a Fate Worse than Death than which nothing could possibly be worse. Since most Gothic literature of the 18th and 19th centuries used the word "seduce" where we would use "rape," Stoker gets major points for being possibly the first author since Edmund Spenser to recognize the difference between seduction and force. Then along came the movies that ship Mina with her metaphorical rapist with the public's approval. The adaptors apparently somehow got Stoker's novel confused with _Carmilla_ and _The Phantom of the Opera_.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   _Grave Peril_ explicitly describes Red Court vampire saliva acts as a venom to paralyze their prey, particularly since it functions as a highly addictive narcotic. So addictive, in fact, that Harry, just _remembering_ what it was like to be under the influence, starts drifting into the euphoria state on the spot. And they call it their Kiss. On the other hand, the White Court are Emotion Eaters and the Black Court are straight _Dracula_ types.
    -   Though the Lord Raith, supreme ruler of the White Court was noted to have coined the term "Kiss of Death" — his own House Raith feeds on lust, they manage to excite emotions in their victims and drive them into a state of pleasure that drowns out everything else, even death. In one book, Harry's apprentice Molly tries to get a read off of the victim of a Raith's attentions to figure out how she died... and gets something else entirely. Something that Waldo Butters hasn't gotten in two years and Harry Dresden hasn't gotten in _four_. I mean, damn.
-   In the _Evernight_ series, vampire bites are treated as being very intimate and second-only to sex, provided its consensual. Unwilling participants find the experience pretty awful and that goes for both vampires and humans.
-   John Alfonz in _Family Bites_.
-   In Octavia Butler's novel _Fledgling_, not only are vampire bites profoundly enjoyable, chemicals in the saliva develop a symbiotic bond between the vampire and the human that make them intensely interested in each other, irrespective of their usual preferences.
-   In the Richard Lee Byers book _Unholy_ (set in _Forgotten Realms_) drinking someone's blood is beyond an erotic experience for the vampire, and they have the power to make the victim feel the same thing. Some victims, however, find the experience inherently erotic, whether the vampire is trying or not.
-   In _The Hollows_ series by Kim Harrison, the saliva of vampires contains neurotransmitters that make the pain of a vampire's bite feel like pleasure. Vampires can also sensitize their victim's bite so that only that vampire can affect the victim, leaving the victim mentally bound to that vampire.
-   In _The House of Night_, vampyre bites are extremely pleasurable to both the 'victim' and the vampyre inflicting the bite. Applies to both kinds of vampyres, even if the vampyre and the human are of the same gender.
-   The bite of a vampire in _The Immortal Rules_ supposedly has soothing properties...all the better for the victim not to resist as their blood is being drained away. However we never actually see this happen as every time the protagonist feeds, it is obviously painful and terrifying for the victim. This is slightly justified both by the fact that she is an extremely new vampire, and by the fact that those she fed on were opponents in the middle of _trying to kill her_, so she wasn't as inclined to use finesse.
-   The feeding-from-the-thigh thing is also mentioned in the _Kitty Norville_ books—in the context of a young woman calling into the main character's radio show tentatively wondering how she can... wean, so to speak, her vampiric lover from said vein and more to the conventional neck-feeding. And also how she can get him to wear poet shirts more...
-   While this trope is present in _Midnight Illusion_ by Jane Linnet, unfortunately, circumstances result in the Friendly Neighborhood Vampire having to go for the nearest food source, as there's no time to wait for anyone else to arrive. Since said vampire is Ambiguously Bi and the human is a straight man, it's incredibly awkward and played for laughs. Said vampire does note that feeding on someone always overrides Incompatible Orientation on both the vampire and human sides of the feeding.
-   The trope shows in _The Mortal Instruments_ series, Simon who is a vampire has hunger for blood and Izzy ends offering her blood while enjoying it.
-   In the _Night Huntress_ series, vampire venom spreads through the donor's blood and arouses them. Vampires often use this as foreplay with their human lovers, although it can also be used to make rape victims less aggressive.
    -   They actually have three sorts of venom they can choose to use. The type detailed above, one that makes the victim more susceptible to suggestion, and one that is exceedingly painful.
-   In the _Night World_ series, a tranced victim will not feel anything, and an unwilling victim actually feels a pain akin to having ones soul sucked out. However, a willing victim gets a feeling of the vampire's mind, and since most of the vampire bites we see with a willing victim include the 'soulmate principle'...
-   In _The Otherworld Series_, vampires can choose whether to make their feeding pleasurable or painful to the victim.
-   In the _Ravenloft_ novel _Vampire of the Mists_, when Jander feeds from Anna for the first time, the narrative notes that she moaned, but did not pull away. Later on, when Jander is describing what feeding is like for both vampires and their victims, he compares it explicitly to sex. On the other hand, the book also uses the opposite trope, Vampire Bites Suck, for when vampires lose control during feeding.
-   The vampires in Larry Niven's _Ringworld_ series use pheromones to seduce victims into a crazed sex-mood. They then take advantage of the fact that the victims are either having sex with the vampires or each other to eat to their heart's content.
-   In the _Sabina Kane_ novels, scenes involving vampires feeding on other vampires have very strong BDSM overtones, with feeder as dom and feed-ee as sub. Sabina is very aroused after Clovis feeds on her (though she resists the temptation to act on it), and Clovis later refers to having "vein-fucked" her.
-   Stephen King's _Dracula_ tribute _'Salem's Lot_ uses this. All the vampires put victims in trances before even the first bite. Well, it's implied that Straker's death was more of a gruesome one. Barlow, in his letter to Ben _et al._, makes oblique reference to his own appetites betraying him.
-   In _The Silver Kiss_ by Annette Curtis Klause, Vampire Bites Suck unless the victim has been put in a euphoric trance.
-   _The Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries_ describe vampire fangs as injecting an anti-coagulant, and the saliva a coagulant and agent to assist healing in their victims. But the vampires who indulge with a victim to make it part of sex, often choose an inner thigh vein rather than, necessarily, the neck.
    -   Unfortunately, if a vampire is newly risen or starved for blood, he'll go into immediate attack mode. Attack mode includes raping the victim while drinking from him/her.
-   Happens in a _Sweet Valley High_ book when a mysterious guy shows up from out of town just as a bunch of bodies turn up drained of blood. He preys on several girls (they go along with him pretty willingly, vampire magnetism or something) who don't even realize their blood is being drained. They just describe it as really pleasurable neck sucking/biting.
-   According to reformed vampire Otto Chriek in the Discworld novel _The Truth_, "Let's just say they don't alvays scream."
-   Played straight in _The United States of Monsters_ by C.T. Phipps, particularly _Straight Outta Fangton_, as a vampire bite is apparently so pleasurable that both vampires and humans find it to be one long drawn out orgasm. This notably makes the newly-turned monogamous heterosexual Peter Stone uncomfortable even as other vampires gleefully indulge in it.
-   In the _Vampire Academy_ series, a vampire bite from the non-immortal Moroi vampires cause euphoria and can be addictive. So addictive that there are people who are volunteer feeders for them and are addicted to it the same way drug addicts are. A Dhampir letting a Moroi suck his/her blood during sex is the kinkiest thing imaginable in their world, and such Dhampirs are stigmatized and called "blood whores". In fact, any instance of a Dhampir giving blood to a Moroi is labeled like dirty by the public regardless of how non-sexual the context is. The narcotic bite of the undead Strigoi is ten times as potent as the Moroi.
-   Anne Rice's _The Vampire Chronicles_, as well as The Film of the Book for _Interview with the Vampire_. That is, when a vampire doesn't simply rip off the victim's head and drink all the blood in one gulp. Or...cracks the skull open to get to the last dregs in the brain...
-   P.N. Elrod's _The Vampire Files_ series does not describe the bite as sexy/euphoric, except to say that the sex is better for Jack if he can drink at the moment of climax. But his girlfriend doesn't seem to mind, so it must feel at least painless to her.
    -   Actually, in book 2, _Lifeblood_, Bobbi explicitly states that Jack's bite is preferable to normal intercourse because "it just goes on and on...." In the same scene, Jack refers to the fact that the act of feeding from her stimulates the pleasure centers in the same way that sex previously did.
-   Subverted in the _Vampire Memories_ series by Barb Hendee: Wade is, at least initially, turned on by the thought of Eleisha feeding on him, but she shuts him down, saying explicitly that it would not be sexy, but that it would hurt.
-   In _The Vampyre_, John Polidori's Lord Byron Expy, Lord Ruthven, also predates Dracula by quite a bit of time. He was written as a seductive rake whose attention to young women is just the pre-dinner show. (Polidori was not fond of Byron's womanizing.) So yes, the people who claim that vampires = sex is a modern invention are full of nonsense.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffyverse_ seems to have examples that fit this trope and its flipside, Vampire Bites Suck. Vampire bites in the Buffyverse can apparently induce euphoria, addiction or both; Word of God states Vampire bites stimulate the victim's pleasure receptors.
    -   In season 5 Riley pays to get bitten. However, his addiction could be more masochistic in nature; he was clearly growing addicted _to_ the pain of being bitten and the resulting adrenaline rush. It was related to his feelings of inferiority.
    -   In "Graduation Day" Buffy needed to get Angel to bite her because the blood of the Slayer was the only thing that could cure a poison in his blood stream. It starts off with them both standing as he bites her, then they fall to the floor with him on top and though Buffy is obviously in pain at first it takes on a decidedly more sexual appearance after a second with her moving her legs up around him. So it hurts at first, but starts feeling good after a while. At the climax of the experience, Buffy's body shudders and her leg kicks out violently, sending a bench and urn crashing to the floor. This was a deliberate attempt to equate the experience with sex and the violent ending spasm with orgasm in a way that would avoid the censors, according to the Word of God. However, her final expression before losing consciousness is pure horror, while Angel still keeps drinking.
    -   In "Buffy vs. Dracula", Dracula draws out of Buffy that she enjoyed Angel biting her and desires to repeat the experience. Dracula obliges. Buffy then hides Dracula's bite from Love Interest Riley as if it's a shameful hickey. Riley's insecurity over this and her attraction to Angel fuel his later behaviour (paying the vampire equivalent of prostitutes to bite him).
    -   In _Angel_ it’s revealed Darla in particular gets off on being bitten by Angel as seen frequently in the flash backs. When Darla messes with Angel by pretending to be a normal woman under Wolfram & Hart’s orders, Angel made her break her role by biting her neck. Which caused a orgasmic reaction and turned her back to her usual Darla-personality.
    -   In the _Buffy_ Season Eight comic, with vampires having become a public fad started by vampire actress Harmony Kendall, there are a lot of humans who get bitten by vampires on purpose. The vampires and humans seem to have established some kind of truce: humans let the vampires bite them, and in return the vampires will leave them alive and only feed off the ones who want to be bitten. The human groupies gain a rush out of this deal and the vampires a steady food supply. Not all vampires agree with this, however, since they are soulless and inherently evil, which ranges from Stupid Evil to Affably Evil. Some are either too set in their ways or too careless to play within Harmony's rules and continue killing people, making themselves fair prey for Slayers and other hunters of vampires.
        -   In the same season Angel manages to calm down Dark Willow by biting her neck; impressive since it took Xander's power of love and childhood memories to stop her last time.
-   In a departure from the books, _The Dresden Files_ shows flashbacks of Harry having a love affair with Bianca St. Claire, a high-ranking member of the Red Court who runs a brothel as her day job. She's implied to feed on him during sex.
-   In _Forever Knight_ vampirism is often compared to addiction. The flashbacks in one episode had a woman continuing to sneak out at night to visit Nicholas even though she knew his feeding on her would eventually kill her. He does end up killing her and feels bad about it, but knows he'll be drawn to find another victim and begin the process again.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_:
    -   "In Throes of Increasing Wonder...": Louis de Pointe du Lac finds Lestat de Lioncourt biting him pleasing. However, this only applies to _un petit coup_ ("the little drink"), as Lestat calls it, where he doesn't drain the person completely and heals the wound afterwards. Louis notes that it awoke feelings of intimacy within him despite the significant physical toll on his body.
    -   Near the beginning of "A Vile Hunger for Your Hammering Heart", Rashid briefly closes his eyes and grins while Louis is feeding on his blood, so it must be a pleasant sensation for him.
-   Kiva-la seems to give these out in _Kamen Rider Decade_. Though if Narutaki's reaction is any indication, he might be getting a little _too_ much pleasure for a kids' show out of it.
    -   At the end, she gives one to Yusuke's corpse, not only bringing him Back from the Dead and also making him Brainwashed and Crazy, just in time for his participation in the Bolivian Army "Ending".
-   _Scrubs_ has three examples of this, each part of JD's fantasies. One features him being bitten by two female vampires, quite messily, and sheepishly admitting to liking it. The other two examples are JD biting women, as Dr. Acula, who both immediately have orgasms.
-   On _Shadowhunters_ vampire bites contain venom that causes intense euphoria in the subject. Isabelle actually seeks this from Raphael as a substitute for the Fantastic Drug _yin fen_, which is made using vampire venom and to which she has become addicted.
-   Although it's not even close to a 'kiss', when the Wraith of _Stargate Atlantis_ feed on a person, the person drifts into this expression. It's hinted that the body experiences a sensory overload so they're not killed instantly. Beckett explains that they inject an enzyme that acts as a steroid of sorts in order to keep the victim alive for as long as possible. Aiden Ford gets addicted to the enzyme, as it makes him incredibly strong for a human and is later seen capturing and "milking" Wraith for it, a sort-of sick reversal.
-   _True Blood_ has a slight subversion. By Sookie's reaction, the bite actually is painful. But there is an entire subculture of people who are into the being bitten experience. They're called Fangbangers, and they seek out vampires to bite them (particularly during sex), or willingly make themselves drink boxes.
    -   In a particularly funny moment, Eric Northman pays a prostitute to let him suck blood from her neck and she shows to be clearly enjoying being bitten, but this makes Eric frustrated and he asks her to pretend she's disliking it.
-   _Ultraviolet (1998)_. A woman comes across a vampire feeding on a security guard and faints. She's woken up by the same security guard, who's concerned for her and hasn't noticed anything unusual happen to him, implying some sort of hypnosis. It was said earlier in the series that vampire bites make the person bitten more 'suggestible' and can only be seen under UV light, with obvious benefits for covering the vampire's tracks.

    Music 

-   The music video for "Chasing The Sun" by The Wanted features the band romancing several women. All the women are vampires, and all of them bite the lads in a sexy manner.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: "Romanticize it, glamorize it, call it what you will. To me, it will always be carnal, bloody murder."
-   In _Van Richten's Guide To Vampires_, Ravenloft's greatest monster hunter/expert attributes victims' compliance to a combination of vampires' charm-gaze and fast-talk, perhaps facilitated by some morbid, self-destructive subconscious impulse on the victims' part. The sex-appeal aspect isn't explicitly mentioned — Van Richten is an Expy of Van Helsing, a Victorian-era scholar, after all — but it's implied.
    -   With vampyres, _living_ monstrous humanoids from Ravenloft who share real vampires' feeding habits, it's their narcotic saliva that dominates and pacifies their victims.
    -   _Dungeons & Dragons_ werebats may also drink the blood of their prey, but they evidently don't have any means of subduing their victims other than brute force, so their attacks are unpleasant.
-   _Shadowrun_. Essence Drain (as practiced by vampires and other Awakened creatures) triggers a release of endorphins that causes ecstasy in the victim, which can lead to addiction and the victim seeking out such creatures in order to be drained. Vampires must take some of the victim's blood in order for the drain to occur.
-   A pleasurable, almost sexual experience is how The Kiss is described in both _Vampire: The Masquerade_ and _Vampire: The Requiem_. From _The Masquerade_ core rulebook, revised edition:
    
    What is it like? My dear, words can not describe it. Imagine drinking the finest champagne and the sensation of the most sensual lovemaking you've ever experienced. Overlay that with the rush the opium fiend feels as he takes that first breath on the pipe, and you have some sense, some tiny, infinitesimal sense of what it feels like to drink the blood of...a human being.
    
    -   Both settings mention "Blood Dolls", humans who become addicted to the experience of being fed on. In _Vampire: The Masquerade_, it's actually the clan weakness of the Giovanni to have their Kiss be horribly painful.
    -   Also The Kiss is described to be the only real pleasure a vampire can ever feel, since every other thing they enjoyed before tastes stale and they have no real sexual desire whatsoever. But as some kind of compensation it is described to feel unbelievably good!
        -   In _Vampire the Masquerade 20th Edition_ and in _Vampire: The Requiem_, they do have sexual desire and the ability to have sex if they want. Unlike in Revised where they were just dead and that was considered a tacky way to feed.
    -   Similar to the original Giovanni, the _New World of Darkness_ has a Mekhet bloodline known as the Qedeshah who also do not receive the benefits of The Kiss as a bloodline weakness, making them major potential Masquerade breaches.

    Video Games 

-   Deconstructed in _16 Ways to Kill a Vampire at McDonalds_, where it's explained that being bitten by a vampire feels really good... because it actually injects drugs into the victim, so they can't fight back and won't scream while they are being sucked dry.
-   In _Baldur's Gate III_, if you let Astarion bite you, his bite is noted to feel _pleasant_. Taken further if you decide to romance him; as you can encourage him to bite you during sex. This is in contrast with how he bites enemies in combat, ripping the blood from their neck.
-   Rayne's full body, arm-and-thigh-locking embrace appears to stun her victims with pleasure in _BloodRayne_. But if the Kiss is ever broken, Mooks can go right back to attacking without a lingering pause.
-   In _Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2_, the few times Dracula feeds from a willing donor whom he doesn't want to injure (and not an enemy or victim he's messily shredding), it's animated to resemble a romantic kiss.
-   There are plenty of enslaved humans in _Lunar Knights_ who completely enjoy the sensation of their regimental vampire bites. Since the humans are fed on pretty much everyday, the bite is completely subverted altogether — the humans get _bottle caps on their necks._

    Webcomics 

-   _Eerie Cuties_: Layla's bite has been shown to arouse her "victims"; most notably, Tiffany and Brooke.
-   _Last Res0rt_ has Jigsaw unwilling to feed on her (sleeping) lieutenant Daisy until she remembers that it's supposed to be harmless, "like bloodwork". After some initial hesitation, both Jigsaw _and_ Daisy are starting to enjoy it a bit too much, at least until Jigsaw freaks out and bites a little TOO hard, going from Subversion to example to Vampire Bites Suck in only a few panels.
-   Lampshaded in _The Order of the Stick_ when Elan lets Vampire Durkon feed on him.
    
    **Elan:** Do we at least share a mystical bond that draws me into a mesmerizing web of erotic subtext?
    
    **Durkon:** Na.
    
    **Elan:** Man, real life vampires are _way_ less interesting than fictional ones.
    

    Web Original 

-   _Gaia Online_ pulls this off in the Halloween 2008 event comics. A vampire caught "attacking" a human and his supposed victim are both blushing, sweaty, and quick to insist that "It's consensual! Yeah!"
-   In _Metamor City_ vampires inject a narcotic venom through their fangs. Then they start to see glimpses of one another's memories as their souls intermingle, it's apparently better than sex.
-   _Vamp You_, the vampire porn site, relies on this trope a ton, especially when it combines turning scenes, and sex scenes.
