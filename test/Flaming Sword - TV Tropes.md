_"Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden. He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."_

This is what happens when you combine two of childhood's most reviled taboos... playing with sharp objects, and Playing with Fire.

Great-great-great Grandfather to the Laser Blade, this is a blade that is _on fire_ (or possibly _made_ of fire). These are usually wielded by divine and infernal Messengers alike, because nothing says "Gonna smite your ass" like being able to cut someone and burn them at the same time. Also a favorite trick of the Magic Knight, who may also vary it with different elements.

Sub-Trope to Elemental Weapon. Contrast Hot Blade, for when swords are warm enough to glow, but not to actually burn. A type of Impossibly Cool Weapon, for when your Cool Sword really needs that special touch. See also Incendiary Exponent, Fire-Breathing Weapon, and Oddly Shaped Sword (if the sword is flame-shaped). Don't expect it to ever be touched upon just how much Nightmare Fuel and Body Horror this should inflict on anybody on the receiving end. (Fire _or_ a blade is bad enough.)

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Berserk_:
    -   Isidro's Salamander Dagger, a gift from the witch Flora, has a blade crafted from molten lava and crawls with the spirits of fire elementals. A stab from it can unleash a burning power that's hot enough to melt steel.
    -   During the Kushan invasion of Vritannis, when Guts and Serpico are fighting the sorcerer Daiba and his giant water elemental familiar the Kundalini, Schierke comes up with a spell to enable Guts to counter the serpent's water cannon and make its true body vulnerable. Using the same spell she employed earlier to destroy a group of Daka with a wheel of fire, she superheats Guts' BFS so that it vaporizes the water it touches into steam.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Captain-commander Yamamoto, besides being on fire himself when fighting, has a flaming sword. Since he can drive people to the ground with a glance, it's no surprise that his sword puts off enough heat to burn the clouds out of the sky. His Bankai trades in the fire for all the heat of his flames being concentrated along the edge of his blade. The heat is so intense that just by touching the ground with the sword's **tip**, he atomizes the ground in the direction he was cutting.
    -   The Filler villain Shusuke Amagai's bankai. It's a BFS with an afterburner for a hilt.
    -   Isshin Kurosaki's Shikai is surrounded by flaming reiatsu.
    -   Bazz-B, Sternritter H - "The Heat", can create a blade of concentrated flames extending from his hand using four of his fingers. Attacking with it creates an explosion massive enough to dwarf an entire city, and the flames are strong enough that the sword can cut through solid stone.
-   The sword Kurikara in _Blue Exorcist_.
-   The titular character of _The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird_ has one, naturally dubbed "Flame Sword". Oddly enough its upgraded version actually switches it to a Hot Blade.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_:
    -   Stiyl Magnus and his fire demon Innocentius both wield swords of solid flames.
    -   Fiamma of the Right's flaming sword also doubles as a BFS that's _**forty kilometers long**_.
    -   A minor antagonist named Richard Brave wields Lævateinn, a flaming sword of his own creation that uses a combination of magic and science to work. Unfortunately, creating this weapon caused the Magic Side to condemn him as The Heretic for violating the laws separating Science and Magic. Richard swore revenge for this injustice and for the Magic Side dissing his awesome creation.
-   Variation done in _Code Geass_. The Japanese Knightmare Frames wield superheated chainsaw katanas, with General Tohdoh having a customized version with rocket thrusters.
-   Akari from _Day Break Illusion_ has one. Unusually, it's a rapier, and not actually flaming. Just made of of concentrated fire (or sun, rather).
-   Kyojuro's Flame Breathing and Tanjiro's Sun Breathing in _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_ are actually subversions. Their attacks are associated with the movement and power of fire and in the anime are visualized to look as if their blades are on fire, but in reality their techniques are just highly advanced sword techniques and the flames are special effects. However, this is played straight when Tanjiro's first use of Sun Breathing is supplemented by Nezuko's recently-developed Demon Art of setting her blood on fire.
-   In _Digimon Data Squad_, Shinegreymon gets one when using his True Burst Mode.
-   In _Digimon Fusion_, Dorbickmon uses them for his Tyrant Collbrande attack. Bonus points because it is a flame shaped into a sword.
-   Miyako from _Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure into the Underworld_ can spontaneously summon a fire-sword from her medallion to battle demons, setting any demon mooks in her path on fire.
-   Dai, the eponymous hero from _Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai_ has used fire magic on some occasions to turn any sword he wields into a Flaming Sword. But this isn't limited to fire spells, as he can also combine his sword with lightning magic for an even stronger power-up.
-   In _The Executioner and Her Way of Life_, Ashuna Grisarika's signature weapon is a sword which she sets aflame with her magic.
-   In _Fairy Tail_, Natsu has twice used such a sword under varying circumstances.
    -   The first time was in Edolas, where he couldn't use his normal magic due to lack of Ethernano until Mystogan gave him the X-Balls and had to rely on a magic sword that in theory could be used up to 100 times by drawing upon the stored magical energy to form a flame blade. Unfortunately, due to both his usual recklessness and lack of skill he used up all the stored magic energy in a single attack that blasted fire everywhere.
    -   The second time was in the Tartaros Arc where Silver threw one to him and Lisanna to escape their magic-hampering cuffs and their cell. Unlike the Edolas sword, this one had a proper blade but when touched would rapidly heat up until it caught fire. It worked out pretty well for him, but he ended up breaking it in two when he attacked Zeref with it, to no effect on the Black Wizard.
-   _Flame of Recca_ has Saiha's En Jin, which focuses Recca's flame into a fire blade attached to his wrist.
-   _Hoshin Engi_: Nento Dojin's paope is the Hienken (Leaping Flames Sword), a hole-riddled sword which is enveloped in flames. Downplayed as Nento is so powerful he can perform flame jutsus powerful enough to outmach many Paopei.
-   In _Kaze no Stigma_, Ayano has Enraiha, a wooden sword always in flames, other than the times she gets disarmed and Enraiha is on the ground.
-   Signum's Laevatein in _Lyrical Nanoha_ is both this _and_ a Whip Sword. Bonus points for being named after the mythical Norse sword that will bring about the end of the world, and for Signum (a.k.a. "Blazing General") bearing resemblance to Archangel Michael (a.k.a. "Strategos of the Heavenly Host"). When using _Karyu Issen_, Signum and Agito create a shaft of flames and holds it as if it were a sword. By swinging her arm, she can throw the condensed flames against enemies that are far away.
-   In _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_, Alibaba Saluja's sword becomes fused with the fire Djinn Amon, thus allowing him to utilize the power of its flames. Later on, his sword gets bigger the more he uses its power, and gradually it gets to the point where it's completely enveloped in flames.
-   In _Magic Knight Rayearth_, Hikaru's sword does this in a variation: it only ignites if someone that isn't her touches it. Later, in the anime version's second season, the Rune God Rayearth's sword is almost constantly alight. When the series got into _Super Robot Wars T_, the flame sword became her most powerful solo attack, surpassing her signature, named spells like Flame Arrow or Ruby Lightning.
-   _Naruto_: Itachi’s Susanoo, a spirit warrior projected by the wielder of the Mangekyo Sharingan, uses the Totsuka no Tsurugi; a spirit blade looking like nothing so much as a long flame, although it stabs through and sprays blood out of Orochimaru quite well. (In the manga it looked less like fire and more like a liquid which, going by the description in the databook, is actually _sake_ of all thing. Cue Fridge Brilliance: Orochi from Shinto mythology was slain after drinking too much sake. Some other characters in the franchise can channel their fire element chakra through any sword to turn it into one.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ shows Quartum's magic spear and _Gladius Divinus Flammae Ardentis_.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Zoro once had all three of his swords on fire during a firestorm, and used them to great effect during the Little Garden Arc. Also, he can apparently light his swords on fire with the force of his swing, which he used to defeat Ryuuma. May also qualify as a Desperation Attack.
    -   Hannyabal uses a flaming _naginata_ called Kessui.
    -   Fossa of Whitebeard's Commanders is able to set his sword on fire, by lighting it with his cigar.
    -   Kin'emon has a fighting style revolving around this, to an extent: it allows him to not only cut with fire, but to cut _fire itself_. Zoro later learns to copy his technique, and uses it to great effect in the Wano Country arc.
    -   Caesar Clown can create a flaming sword by compressing oxygen in the shape of a sword with his powers, and then lighting it on fire.
    -   Charlotte Oven of the Big Mom Pirates can ignite both his sword and himself by using his Devil Fruit power, which allows him to increase an object's heat.
-   Shishio in _Rurouni Kenshin_. It's a particularly nasty one, too. Instead of using magic or a napalm-like substance, Shishio's sword burns because, after using it to kill countless people, the blade's serrations have become filled with human fat. One spark from a clash of swords, and all the fats and oils the sword's soaked up go into a blaze.
-   An inversion appears in _Sekirei_ with Tsukiumi's Water Blade.
-   Shana of _Shakugan no Shana_, contractor to the Flame of Heaven, can set her sword on fire. It makes a complement to her large flaming wings, fireballs, and hair.
-   Madoka Mawari has two in _Tenjho Tenge_. She also burns her skirt off to give herself higher mobility while using them.
-   Starjun's sword from _Toriko_, though according to him it's actually a Flaming Kitchen Knife.
-   In _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_, through a unique mishap involving a virtual MMORPG and a Reality Warper feather; both Syaoran and Kurogane end up with flaming swords outside of the game as well.
-   _Voltron_; a Humongous Mecha with a Blazing Sword!
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, the Flame Swordsman's Flaming Sword of Battle.
-   Hiei in _YuYu Hakusho_ occasionally uses the Sword of the Darkness Flame. Kuwabara's Rei-ken is a combination between this and a Laser Blade, since it's made of his own ki.

    Card Games 

-   _Faith And Redemption_, The Moral Substitute to _Magic: The Gathering_, features a giant flaming sword on the back side of its cards.
-   _Godforsaken_: Dragontongue weapons trail red fire and black smoke, and scourge their targets with flames.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   The Flame Swordsman card depicts a warrior wielding an orange blade wreathed in a thin layer of flame. The Blue Flame Swordsman is much the same, but with a blue blade and blue flames.
    -   The Burning Bamboo Sword, if you can believe a wooden sword being set on fire.

-   In _The DCU_, the Jean-Paul Valley incarnation as Azrael not only wields a flaming sword, he can _shoot_ several of them. Azraels throughout history have wielded a flaming sword in their guise as angels. The _Knightfall_ novelization lovingly details how the sword has advanced through the centuries, from a sword wrapped in soaked rags and set on fire just before Azrael's appearance, to its then-current twin hollow gauntlet-mounted daggers with compressed air propelled through them to fuel the fire.
-   Johnny Storm (the Human Torch, a guy who is a master of flame in all its forms and can't be burned by them) of the _Fantastic Four_ had the bad luck of running into Hellfire and an archangel's flaming sword in the same story arc.

    -   In _Judgment In Infinity_, the Horseman of War is armed with a flaming broadsword.

    Fan Works 

-   In _The Matrix_ fanfic _Bringing Me To Life_ during chapter 25 - Maze, Max gets hold of a sword and dips it into some flames, because the giant ants hate fire. It lasts nearly the whole chapter until it breaks from the stress.
-   _Child of the Storm_ has Harry's sabre - accidentally designed after a _shashka_, the Cossack Sabre - Curtana, which he often imbues with fire magic to make its blows have more impact on opponents with a powerful Healing Factor. This has been known to include an outright Groin Attack. No, Harry does not fight nicely.
-   _Children of an Elder God_: Asuka wielded a flaming sword when she fought Nyarlathotep.
    
    Two swords came out. One was covered with orange-red flame, the other shone with pale moonlight. They rose, dispelling the gloom that had fallen upon the balcony, then sliced down in unison. The Regent caught one with each hand, and the fire and light were snuffed. "Fire dies and light fades." His hands twisted and the flaming sword was wrenched from Asuka's hands, falling at Cassilda's amber-frozen feet.
    
-   _DNMC_: D'Arg sports two that are powered by his Dust-infused blood. They also double as shotguns.
-   Yayoi from the _Horseshoes and Hand Grenades_ side-story _Month of Sundays_ gains a flaming saber.
-   _one day at a time (Nyame)_: At the beginning of the story, it's mentioned that Jason managed to kill Ra's al Ghul using a 'sword...glowing with mystical fire'. It's not until the very end of the story that it's revealed to be The Balance, a weapon forged by Death of the Endless. Two of its nicknames are 'Azrael's Blade' and 'The Flaming Sword', heavily implying that it is _the_ Flaming Sword that once guarded the Garden of Eden. What's special about the sword is that anyone killed by it has their soul marked by Death, ensuring they can _never_ come back to life.
    -   In _the superhero game_, it's revealed in the previous timeline, Jason's Swiss-Army Weapon has a single-sword configuration that can set itself on fire. Presumably it was inspired by the Balance.
-   The Pyrefrost Beowolf in _Raindrop's Hearth's Warming Eve Miracle_ has two pairs of claws and two scythes that emit powerful _blue_ fire from them.
-   In _Son of the Sannin_, Sasuke is trained by Itachi and Shisui in the use of katanas. One of his techniques, Fire Release: Burning Edge, coats the blade in flames to increase its power.
-   Blackfire in _With Strings Attached_. Bonus coolness points because the flames are, well, black.

    Film — Animation 

-   In _How to Train Your Dragon 2_, Hiccup wields a retractable sword coated in Monstrous Nightmare spit, with a mechanism to ignite it when needed.

-   _Dr. Wai in "The Scripture with No Words"_: Dr. Wai and the Big Bad fights each other with burning Whip Swords.
-   _Fire Dragon_: The titular protagonist wields a fire-sword, which she can ignite using her _qi_.
-   The same effect is achieved in _The Force Awakens_ with Kylo Ren's unstable, ragged lightsaber. It perfectly mirrors his somewhat unstable psyche.
-   The High Priest of the Mayan temple in _The Fountain_ wields a flaming sword with which to defend the Tree of Life. It's actually a bit of Deconstruction, as the Mayan priest distracts Tomas with the sword and stabs him in the gut with a dagger.
-   _Freddy vs. Jason_: When Jason attacks a rave, one of the teens throws grain alcohol on him, then lights it with a torch — which results in a **flaming** unstoppable killing machine. His machete also ends up covered in flames. Every time he swings it, it leaves a wake of fire behind it.

    -   The Witch-King in _The Return of the King_ wields one during the siege of Minas Tirith, though only in the extended edition of the movie.
    -   When Aragorn first draws Andúril (meaning Flame of the West), ghostly fire runs down it. In case you're wondering, it's that sword that Elrond and Arwen forge from the shards of Narsil.
-   In _Noah_, Methusaleh is shown destroying an army of Cainites with a huge blast from his flaming sword.
-   _Pacific Rim: Uprising_: The rogue jaeger, Obsidian Fury, has two flaming _chainsaw_ blades built into its weaponry.
-   In _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest_, Will Turner lights his sword on fire by dipping it in oil then smashing a lantern, in an attempt to intimidate and fend off a number of Davy Jones' crew. He never actually fights anyone with his flaming sword. This is because the prop for this scene was actually quite dangerous as it was a tube through which flammable liquid was pumped to fuel the fire.
-   _The Scorpion King's_ Big Bad had flaming swords (due to being dipped in lamp oil) during the climactic Boss Battle.
-   The Headless Horseman from Tim Burton's _Sleepy Hollow (1999)_ wielded a variant. While it didn't appear to be burning, it was so hot from the eternal flames of Hell that it still cauterized any wounds inflicted.

-   In the _Fighting Fantasy_ title _Island of the Lizard King_, swords like this are the only thing that can harm the Lizard King; and he uses them himself, oddly enough, keeping them in his fortress.
-   _Lone Wolf_:
    -   The Sommerswerd has holy sunfire on its edge when it faces particularly evil foes. This property is on display in the videogame spin off.
    -   The Darklord blades, like Helshezag or the Dagger of Vashna, are surrounded by _black flames_ when used.
    -   If Lone Wolf has reached the rank of Sun Lord or higher and has Grand Weaponmastery, he can turn an ordinary sword into a Flaming Sword. Not nearly as powerful as the Sommerswerd, but useful in places where drawing the Sword of the Sun will get you killed.
    -   Flaming swords are the favored weapons of Nadziranim under the ice dragon form.
    -   In _The Dungeons of Torgar_, Baron Shinzar wields Ogg-kor-kaggaz, a huge flaming axe.

    Literature 

-   True to the series' roots, the hero of _The Belgariad_ ends up wielding a Thunderbolt Iron BFS that was forged by a royal ancestor and burns with blue fire due to the attached MacGuffin.
-   Though ironically the protagonist of _The Blade of the Flame_ doesn't use a flaming sword, his half-orc partner Ghaji gets a flaming axe during their infiltration of Dreadhold. They have to use it up to defeat the dire wereshark invasion in the climax of the series, however.
-   Dyrnwyn in _The Chronicles of Prydain_. This is the same sword that is one of the 13 hallows, or treasures, or Britain.
-   In _Codex Alera_, any sufficiently skilled firecrafter can light their sword on fire; however, it takes quite a lot of power to be able to do so, and as such is a technique mainly used by the immensely powerful High Lords. As a bonus, the flames High Lords wreath their swords with are typically in the signature colors of their noble house. Being struck with one of these is what killed High Lord Aquitaine; were it a normal wound, he could have simply watercrafted it shut, but a flaming sword's wounds cauterize themselves, making healing impossible. They're also favored for anchoring firecraftings.
-   _The Darkangel Trilogy_, in the final book Erin, the faithful companion of Aeriel, is given the "glaive" _Burning Bright_ (glaive used in this context, is an old word for sword). Burning Bright is a fiery sword of great power and can withstand direct strikes from the Blade Adamantine, an Absurdly Sharp Blade that's an artifact of the Ancients.
-   The sword of _Discworld_'s Chaos is made of blue fire, a flame so hot that it goes to the other side and becomes absolute _cold_. On his off days, he uses it to keep the milk he sells fresh. Also, in _Lords and Ladies_ magic is described as being like "a flaming sword that _burns all the way down to the pommel_" to emphasise how dangerous using it is, and why wizards and witches don't use it for mundane things.
-   In _The Divine Comedy_, angels that guard the entrance to Purgatory bear flaming swords meant to scare off any serpents or demons that wish the corrupt the repentant souls. The swords strangely enough have had their points remove, which according to Robert Hollander signifies that their fighting days are over after Jesus defeated Hell with his Crucifixion.
-   In _The Doomfarers of Coramonde_ the character Strongblade carries a magical greatsword called "Flarecore" (aka "Blazetongue") that can burst into flame when the appropriate magical verse is chanted.
-   _Doctor Who_ Expanded Universe: Russell T Davies' 2018 novelization of "Rose" has the title character shown a picture of a future incarnation of the Doctor described as a "tall, bald black woman wielding a flaming sword".
-   _Dragonvarld_: During the battle in _Master of Dragons_ between the warrior women of Seth and the dragon army, the latter's commander has a spell cast on her sword which ignites it with flames. She cuts down several dragon warriors using it, whose armor otherwise stops ordinary weapons.
-   Orson Gregory in _The Dreamside Road_ uses a sapphire-colored sword of fire as his primary weapon.
-   _Fablehaven_ features Vasilis, the Sword of Light and Darkness, which is a flaming sword. The flames reflect the heart of the wielder: when Seth wielded it, the flames were scarlet; when Kendra wielded it, the flames turned pure white.
-   In _Farworld: Land Keep_, there is a type of sword called a Flazite, made of dark metal with flames "leaping about on the surface" despite the rain. It gets worse- one scratch, and your blood turns to fire. And...it's pointed at our heroes. Crap.
-   Variation in _Fengshen Yanyi_ with the demigod Nezha: out of his many magic instruments, his main weapon is a long spear whose blade is costantly covered in flames. Later, the fire taoist Luo Xuan uses his Bright Heaven Seal on his Flying Smoke Swords to turn them into "glowing blades giving off fiery smoke" to fight Princess Longji.
-   In _Good Omens_, Aziraphale, Angel of the Eastern Gate, has one. He ends up giving it to Adam and Eve to help them survive after they are cast out of the garden of Eden. God's reaction goes as thus:<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    "25. And the Lord spake unto the Angel that guarded the eastern gate, saying Where is the flaming sword which was given unto thee?  
    "26. And the Angel said, I had it here only a moment ago, I must have put it down some where, forget my own head next.  
    "27. And the Lord did not ask him again.
    
-   _Inheritance Cycle_: Late in _Brisingr_, Eragon gets the titular sword. Whenever he says its name (which means fire in the ancient language), it ignites. One character at least has the sense to point out this is incredibly cheesy. He finds out by saying the name of the sword and then dropping it in surprise. Flametongue swords in _Dungeons & Dragons_ do the same thing.
-   In _The Lay of Paul Twister_, the angelic paladin Aylwyn has one of these (appropriately enough) that she can Summon to Hand. Other Paladins may or may not have similar weapons.
-   _The Legend of Drizzt_: Obould takes it a step further. It's not just a flaming sword, it's a flaming _claymore_.
-   In _The Otherworld Series_, the demon Bad Ass Luke wields a flaming sword.
-   In the _Paradox Trilogy_, Devi owns two thermite swords: Phoebe and Elsie. They are incredibly potent while burning, but have a significant downside in that they only last eighty seconds after being activated before burning out and turning brittle.
-   In _Literature/Saga of the People of Tattúín River Valley_, Lightsabres, or Ljósamækar in the original Old Norse, forged by Dúkú Jothason are this, and unlike in Star Wars, they have flaming blades. There are also only two.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, flaming swords are a religious aspect of the religion of R'Hllor. Their messianic figure wielded a flaming sword called Lightbringer. Several followers of R'Hllor also wield flaming swords of various authenticity.
    -   Thoros of Myr wields a flaming sword in melees and battles, but it's just a trick. He buys a cheap sword beforehand and douses it in flammable wildfire to intimidate his opponents and spook their horses. It's said to also ruin the sword in the process.
    -   Stannis Baratheon acquires a flaming sword he calls Lightbringer, said to be _the_ Lightbringer recreated. Upon closer inspection it's a magical trick. The flames shed light, but not heat. The flames of the legendary, true Lightbringer would burn.
    -   Lord Beric Dondarrion wields a flaming sword when he duels Sandor Clegane. After cutting his palm on the blade, fire bursts from the blood. Unlike the other swords, the flames really burn, which is bad for the pyrophobic Sandor. However it's mentioned earlier that setting your sword on fire makes the steel brittle, and Sandor wins because the sword breaks when Dondarrion is about to make the killing bow.
-   Subverted rather neatly in Harry Turtledove's _Tales of the Fox_ series. The protagonist, amateur wizard Gerin the Fox, discovers an ancient book with a section titled "A cantrip which produceth a flaming sword." Gerin proceeds to hang a lampshade on Ye Olde Butcherede Englishe. Then he tries the spell. It works; his sword bursts out in pure, smokeless elemental fire. Then he discovers the problem with the spell that explains why not everyone uses it. The spell covers your sword blade in fire... but gives you no insulation or protection from the heat _created_ by the fire. Luckily for him, he manages to drop the sword in a barrel of water before his hand gets blistered too badly.
-   The Balrogs in Tolkien's Legendarium (_The Lord of the Rings_ and _The Silmarillion_) wielded not only a flaming sword, but also a flaming cat-of-nine-tails whip. Well, the one in _The Lord Of The Rings_ used a flaming sword at least. Gothmog (the leader of the Balrogs) used a flaming axe, the weapons of the other Balrogs are not known, but were presumably flaming as well. Also, while Andúril is not on fire, it does shine "as though on fire." Even more, Túrin son of Húrin has his own blade, which after a very Kamina-esque speech, he thrusts in the air and a great fire leaps up all around him. One of Gurren Lagann's writers just has to have read that for Kamina. At one point Andúril did burst into actual flame, courtesy of Gandalf the White. Also, the Witch-King's sword has red flames during his encounter with Gandalf, just as depicted in the extended movie version.
-   In _The Traitor Son Cycle_, one of the villains, the Black Knight, has a magic sword, the blade of which can be set on fire by his will. It turns out the "sword" is no mere weapon, it's actually a gate artifact to a fiery dimension though the series never goes anywhere with this tidbit of info.
-   Phoenixfire, a student at Whateley Academy in the _Whateley Universe_, can manifest fire all over herself and also manifest a sword that is _made_ of fire. Her mom the superhero (Magma) can do the exact same thing.
-   Rand of _The Wheel of Time_ uses a sword made of fire from time to time, especially early on before he learns to use his powers in far better ways. He _is_ a blademaster, though.
-   The Midnight Angel from the _Wild Cards_ series is able to summon a gigantic flaming sword as one of her powers.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, Giles uses a baseball bat dipped in flaming holy oil to fight the vampire Angelus in a modern take on this trope.
-   In _The Fallen_ mini-series, angels and Nephilim can wield swords made of pure divine fire, which they can summon from thin air. Being hit by one usually incinerates the target. Strangely enough, the protagonist, a regular kid until recently, can match his swordfighting skills with angels, who have been doing this since before humans were around, and The Devil.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Flaming swords have religious significance in the religion of R'hllor, the Lord of Light, due to fire being his symbol.
    -   Stannis is introduced during a religious ritual to R'hllor in which he pulls a flaming sword from a burning idol. The sword is supposed to represent Lightbringer, a flaming sword of legend, but it quickly gutters out.
    -   Beric Dondarrion causes his sword to magically burst into flame and uses it to fight a trial by combat with Sandor Clegane, who is pyrophobic. Beric loses because the flame makes the sword brittle and it breaks.
    -   Thoros of Myr is famous for using wildfire to set his sword afire in battle and tourney.
    -   Beric cut his hand to enflame his sword against Sandor. Later in the series he and Thoros were able to ignite and snuff their sword flames at will as if they were holding lightsabers.
    -   Just before the start of the Battle of Winterfell, Melisandre causes the _arrahks_ of the Dothraki cavalry to burst into flame in order to give them a better chance against the Army of the Dead. Sadly, it doesn't do much.
    -   The flaming swords in the show are _not_ done by CGI. It's an actual practical effect, albeit one that can only be used for a few minutes at a time because either the fuel powering it runs out or waving it around puts the flames out naturally.
-   _Good Omens (2019)_: As in the books (see Literature above), Aziraphale had one of these while guarding the gate of the Garden of Eden before giving it to Adam and Eve. A Running Gag throughout the series is other characters asking why he doesn't have it anymore. The show also confirms that it is in fact the same blade presented to War on the eve of the Apocalypse. After she's defeated, Aziraphale returns it to the Delivery Man who comes to collect the Horsemen's effects rather than keep it.
-   _Guardian: The Lonely and Great God_: Kim Shin's sword has blue flames surrounding it.
-   _Kaamelott_ has Excalibur, but fortunately it extinguishes itself whenever Arthur puts it down. As he discovers later, it only catches on fire when held by a person of incredible destiny, to his sword master's chagrin and Perceval's surprise. It can't ignite anymore once Arthur comes back to reclaim it in The Movie, _Kaamelott: Premier Volet_... until the climactic duel against Lancelot, where lightning struck Arthur and reignites the sword.
-   _Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire_. Yes, that is the show's name, and yes that is the title character's weapon. However, being a parody and all, Krod has no control over the flaming part. It tends to catch fire when he's "excited". The first time someone asks about it, Krod says he thinks the sword is somehow defective and he needs to get it fixed.
-   As of "Journey Into Mystery", the titular protagonist of _Loki (2021)_ is given one of these by Kid Loki, a variant of himself. Wordof God confirms the sword to be Lævateinn itself.
-   The Flaming Sword serves as a recurring MacGuffin during the second season of _Lucifer (2016)_. God claimed to have destroyed it during Lucifer's rebellion but actually just took away the "flaming" ability and gave it to Azrael, the Angel Of Death. In this state it's still a formiddable weapon that's capable of killing Celestial beings and also causes a Hate Plague if handled by a mortal. At the end of the season Lucifer recovers the missing pieces, restores the fire ability and, with it, the power to cut through the fabric of the universe. On doing this Lucifer immediately throws the blade into the void as it's clearly too powerful to have lying around on Earth. Then in Season 5, Michael has Gabriel (who as Angel of Messages can travel between dimensions) retrieve the blade for him as part of his bid to become the new God when the old one retires. However, Lucifer ultimately defeats him and takes the sword for himself.
-   The Sword of Kells on _The Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nóg_, wielded by Rohan the Mystic Knight of Fire.
-   _Power Rangers_ has the Shogun Megazord Fire Sabre and the Lightspeed Megazord Sabre. The elementally-powered Rangers will occasionally get to do this too, such as in _Lost Galaxy_, _Mystic Force_, and the _Super Sentai_ seasons _Choudenshi Bioman_ and _Samurai Sentai Shinkenger_. Some of these and _Super Sentai_ examples involve _really lighting the weapons on fire_. The Centaurus Phoenix of Mystic Force had this back in Magiranger.
-   _Ultraman Ace_: Ace was on the receiving end of one of these when he fought an extremely formidable monster called Firemons. The sword was so hot it badly burned him even with a light slash. Then Firemons does a hot knife through butter impression and impaling Ace with it (don't worry he gets better).
    -   _Ultraman Taiga_: The titular Ultra can summon the Taiga Tri Blade, which is a sword coated with flames capable of inflicting burning damage to his enemies.

    Music 

-   The song Flaming Sword by the British New Wave Band _Care_.
-   _Jerusalem_ mentions a bow of burning gold, which _might_ be supposed to mean something like this trope. The chariot of fire, on the other hand? We've got another trope for that.

-   In The Bible:
    -   God had Cherubim with these to prevent Adam and Eve and their descendants from returning to the Garden of Eden.
    -   A prophesy in Revelations says that Jesus will return to Earth, pull a flaming sword _out of his mouth_, and finish Satan off for good.

-   In Norse Mythology:
    -   Surtr, the leader of the giants of Muspelheim had one (called "Lævateinn"); his having it plays a major role in Ragnarok. It will burn nearly all of the earth. Oddly enough, he gets stopped by a _tree_ (granted, it _was_ Yggdrasil).
    -   Lævateinn itself was forged by Volundr and owned by Loki. The Old Norse translation means "Damage Twig" and may in fact not be a named sword, but a kenning for a sword.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dreadfleet_: The pleasure-ship _Flaming Scimitar_ is named in honour of the Sword of Fiery Curses, the magical burning blade wielded by the ship's captain, the Golden Magus. In-game, the powerful magical sword gives the Magus a bonus during boarding actions.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Balors (demon generals and Balrog expies) wield flaming swords alongside flaming whips.
    -   Druids can temporarily wield a scimitar made of fire with the Flame Blade spell.
    -   Various magical flaming swords have been available since the earliest editions of the game. By third edition, any magical weapon can have an additional fire damage enchantment applied to it.
-   _GURPS_: The Flaming Weapon spell from _GURPS: Magic_. A naturally flaming sword requires a valuable ruby to be placed on the hilt.
-   _In Nomine_: One of the examples of common relics in the core rules is a flame sword.
-   _Legend of the Five Rings_: There's a fire spell that creates a sword _out of fire_.
-   _Princess: The Hopeful_: The Fuoco upgrade to the various Regalia weapons is Flaming, which does exactly what it sounds like it should.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   In general, many daemons of Khorne, the War God of Chaos, carry flaming weapons. The Bloodletters that make up the majority of Khorne's daemonic forces, for example, wield murderously sharp and barbed Hellblades that burn with the fire of the Blood God's rage.
    -   _Mordheim_: The Sword of Rezhebel spell allows the human warlock who casts it to summon a flaming blade to their hand, boosting the warlock's close combat abilities.
    -   _Warhammer 40,000_:
        -   The force weapons used by psykers can be used to channel the user's Psychic Powers, something usually depicted in the background and artwork as setting the blade on fire.
        -   The sword of the God-Emperor of Mankind, taken up by the Primarch Roboute Guilliman after his father's 'death', is wreathed in flames and capable of outright killing daemons.
        -   The Astartes relic known as the Burning Blade is a large and ancient weapon that burns with a fire capable of melting even the thickest armour. The 8th Edition rules for the Burning Blade represent this by giving the weapon the best Armour Penetration value of any weapon in the arsenal of the Adeptus Astartes.
        -   The sheer hatred and bitterness of some Heretic Astartes Lords is so powerful that it manifests as spectral flames that surround their weapons. The 8th Edition Warlord Trait 'Flames of Spite' represents this by giving these fire wreathed weapons a chance of inflicting mortal wounds.
        -   The Firesabre is a relic weapon of the Aeldari Craftworlds that is said to have been forged from the fang of the great drake Draoch-var. The razor-sharp blade burns with the fury of the mythic dragon and its ethereal fire spreads like a living thing. In game terms, the 8th Edition rules represent this mythical fire by giving the weapon a chance of inflicting mortal wounds to those it strikes.
        -   The sword wielded by Saint Celestine, The Ardent Blade, is wreathed in the flames of the Emperor's wrath. The Living Saint is able to unleash these flames in a wave of fire equivalent in power to a heavy flamer.

    -   _Warhammer Fantasy_:
        -   This is the major schtick of the Bright Wizards (though other wizards have similar weapons). One of their spells, the Flaming Sword of Rhuin, can light the weapons of friendly units on fire. This increases the damage they deal and prevents enemies damaged or killed by fire from regenerating, which is very useful against monsters that otherwise just refuse to die. The basic Bright Wizard also depicts them wielding a flaming blade.
        -   Solkan, a god of fire, the sun, and vengeance, is usually depicted in in-universe religious art as wielding a flaming sword.

    -   Reused a few times down the line - Hordika Vakama's swords get special mention for having flamethrower nozzles worked into the design.
    -   Jaller Inika's Energized Flame Swords and Ackar's Flame Sword.

    Video Games 

-   The ReignBringer in _AdventureQuest_, another of Artix Entertainment's games, definitely fits the bill, it being the most famous of all the fire swords of the various games.
-   One of the divine powers available in _Age of Mythology_ is named "Flaming Weapons", and is obtained by picking Njord as the Heroic Age god. It gives your soldiers a damage boost (150% base attack power) for a considerable time, particularly against buildings. If used after all weapon upgrades are researched, the effect is _devastating_.
-   In _Assassin's Creed Origins_, one of the most powerful weapons Bayek can wield is his friend Hepzefa’s Sword, which is constantly aflame.
-   In _Athena_, Athena's most powerful melee weapon is the Flame Sword, which has enormous range and power. Unfortunately, it hurts to swing it.
-   _Baldur's Gate_ and its sequel have several examples:
    -   The second level druid spell Flame Blade creates a scimitar made of fire.
    -   Xan's Moon Blade is alight with blue flames, and gives him resistance to fire. (But since Xan is a very Squishy Wizard, it won't see much use in combat.)
    -   Durlag's Tower yields "The Burning Earth", a flaming longsword that has useful bonuses against various creatures, including shape shifters and undead.
    -   Some Battle Horrors and Doom Guards also wield flaming swords.
    -   Several weapons in BG2 deal fire damage, including "Stonefire", "Blade of Searing" and "Sword of Flame", and "Angurvadal". Most are useful for killing trolls.
    -   In _Dark Alliance 2_, you can apply jacynths to weapons enchanted with runestones in order to create fire-enchanted weapons. All of these fire weapons will burst into flames whenever enemies are close by. Also, the dungeon set in the Hammer's Hall features Helmed Horrors, red animated armor constructs wielding massive falchions imbued with elemental energy, some of them being fiery.
-   There are many of Sagi's fire element weapon magnus in _Baten Kaitos Origins_. When any fire-weapon is equipped, Sagi's held weapon leaves a red-orange trail behind it, and the blade appears to burn.
-   _Battle for Wesnoth_:
    -   In the original campaign, "Heir to the Throne", a flaming sword can be found and equipped by any of your sword-wielding unit in the "Snow Plains" scenario.
    -   In _Under the Burning Suns_, if you manage to keep Elyssa alive until scenario 7, she will leave the party and give the elves a flaming sword as a parting gift. The sword can be equipped by any non-Dust Devil unit.
-   _Battle Moon Wars_ Takumi has a Magitek broadsword that can burst into blue flame. He is justifiably proud of it, as it can match The Berserker from _Fate/stay night_.
-   _Betrayal at Krondor_ featured various ways one could augment blades. One could coat the blade in flammable naphtha or cast the Steelfire spell to obtain this trope temporarily.
-   _Beyond Oasis_ brought us the Omega Sword. It's not clear if the sword itself is on fire, but it certainly lights up enemies as if they were. Going through the Bonus Dungeon gave the player access to one that would never break.
-   In _Black Tiger_, the final weapon you can purchase is an Epic Flail with a fireball for its head.
-   _Bloodborne_: You can set your sword on fire with Fire Paper. It is as awesome as it sounds.
-   _Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain_:
    -   Kain can get one of these fairly early on. It's extremely powerful, but has the disadvantage of burning your opponents to ashes, thus leaving nothing to feed on - remember, Kain is a vampire.
    -   There's also the Fire Reaver that Raziel can get in all three of the games he's in.
    -   Later in the series, it's revealed that the Hylden champion is supposed to wield a flaming sword. Raziel takes this to mean that he is the Hylden champion, because the Wraith Blade quite resembles a flaming sword.
-   In _Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night_, Muriel can use a Flame whip and has swords, spears and great swords that are flaming weapons.
-   In _The Bonfire: Forsaken Land_, the most powerful weapon that you can develop for your guards and warriors is the flaming sword. These are nearly Lost Technology items learnt through ancients texts and then made from sunstones via the solar forge - a magical forge developed by your alchemists. The flaming sword is a great improvement on the already formidable steel sword. The second game retains the flaming sword and adds solar items (which include armor as well as weapons).
-   In the _Shadows of Evil_ map in _Call of Duty: Black Ops III_, you can obtain the Apothicon sword, which kills anything it hits instantly. This can be upgraded into the fiery Keeper Sword, which does the same but lasts longer.
-   In _Castlevania_, some of the entries have flaming swords, whether it's the Firebrand or the Flamberge, or something else. In particular, _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_ has a pair of flaming swords, the Firebrand and Marsil. Not only do both swords have a fire aura, but with a command input both can generate a wave of flame, with Marsil's long enough to hit something a 1/5 of the screen away. Additionally many Castlevania games having flaming whips for your Belmont to use.
-   _Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead_ lets you add a gasoline tank to some swords once your mechanics skill is high enough, resulting in this. The Rising Sun (flaming katana) is especially cool to have.
-   The cover of _Chrono Trigger_ depicts Marle enchanting Crono's sword with fire magic. While that _is_ a real move in the game (Fire Sword), Marle is An Ice Person, and casts the _inverse_ of Fire Sword (Ice Sword). Lucca grants Fire Sword when teamed with Crono.
-   In _City of Heroes_, Fire Melee and Fire Manipulation give the player access to swords made of fire.
-   The _Crisis Core_ version of Odin has his Zantetsuken start as one of these, get the flame extinguished, then have it rekindle before landing the killing blow.
-   Prince Ross wields a flaming BFS in the _Dark Parables_. He's the Guardian of the Fiera Rosa, so all of his magic powers are fire-oriented, and presumably this allows him to add the flaming characteristic to an otherwise ordinary greatsword.
-   _Darksiders_: When War goes into Chaos Form, he gets a giant flaming sword to go with his huge infernal demon form.
-   _Dark Souls_:
    -   One is used by Gwyn, Lord of Cinder. If you use his soul in a weapon ascension, you can make a non-flaming version. You can set your own sword on fire by using a Charcoal Pine Resin.
    -   Inversions include Dragon upgrades from _Demon's Souls_ and Fire/Chaos upgrades in Dark Souls gives your weapons fire damage, but the weapon itself doesn't burn. Played straight with Queelag's Furysword, which does burst into flames with every swing. This also holds true for the version used by the Boss as well.
    -   Played straight with the Smelter Demon Sword in _Dark Souls II_. It's a huge sword-shaped piece of volcanic rock with veins of lava that unleashes flame with each strong attack. You can also, in addition to the Charcoal Pine Resin method from the last game, cast the Flame Weapon pyromancy on a compatible weapon, setting it ablaze.
    -   _Dark Souls III_ has the final Abysswatcher's sword light on fire as he shifts into Lord of Cinder status (technically all the Lords of Cinder do this, but Yhorm and Aldrich don't wield swords). Pontiff Sulyvhan wields one imbued with the Profaned Flame, as does the Dancer of the Boreal Valley. Prince Lorian's sword is imbued with fire it absorbed from the Demon Prince he slew with it. The Ringed Knights in the Ringed City DLC can temporarily set their swords ablaze for extra damage. And, naturally, the Soul of Cinder, the embodiment of the First Flame, wields a Morph Weapon whose most common form is a flaming sword. The Ringed Knights introduced in the _Ringed City_ DLC also wield flaming swords. Interestingly, their swords were not originally flaming swords but were instead blades of darkness forged in the Abyss. The gods placed a seal of fire on these weapons to cut them off from the Dark. That waning seal is the source of their flame. The Flame Weapon pyromancy from last game also returns, though this time under the name "Carthus Flame Arc".
-   _Demon Skin_ has a Big Red Devil boss who uses a flaming BFS to rough you up. Meanwhile one of the game's power-ups sets your weapon alight for more damage.
-   _Destiny 2_ has the Warlock Super Daybreak. The Warlock creates a sword from solar light, grows flame wings and throws waves of fire at enemies. Alternatively, they can plant the sword into the ground and create a Well of Radiance that rapidly heals and buffs the damage of any allies inside.
-   The _Devil May Cry_ series has quite a lot of flame-related melee weaponry in both Dante's and his enemies' hands. Somewhat fitting considering the whole demon-slaying thing going on.
    -   In _Devil May Cry_, Dante gets Ifrit, a pair of Devil Arm gauntlets imbued with hellfire.
    -   In the prequel _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_, he gets twin Devil Arm swords named Agni and Rudra, having powers over fire and wind respectively. Dante can also fight demons that are wielding flaming scythes.
    -   Nero's Red Queen sword in _Devil May Cry 4_ and _Devil May Cry 5_ has an Exceed system, which has him rev the sword like a motorcycle, with oil being released onto the blade until his blade can go hot enough that when reaching a certain level of Exceed, his attacks are not only stronger but backed up by flames.
    -   In _DMC4_, there's also the boss Berial, a massive flaming leonid centaur demon that hails from and is titled as the "Conqueror of the Fire Hell". Naturally, he has control over hellfire and carries a massive flaming sword.
-   _Diablo II_:
    -   The Archangel Tyrael used a sword that burned with holy flames, before Baal wrestles it away.
    -   The sorceress can also enchant weapons with fire. This ability is almost completely useless in solo play, due to their Squishy Wizard status. But with the right gear and Minmaxing, they _can_ dish out 100k+ damage per hit turning them somewhat into Glass Cannons dealing more damage than anything else in the game.
-   In _Disgaea 4_, the Dragon's Flame Slash magichange attack has the dragon turned sword ignite itself before its wielder strikes the target, who proceeds to catch on fire, then explode.
-   In _Dominions_ there are several craftable blades which are aflame, such as the Fire Brand or the Flambeau. Also, there is a major bless which sets the weapons of your holy units on fire.
-   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, flaming blades can created via enchanted lyrium runes or the Flaming Weapons spell, maintained by one of the Mages in the party. The Templars also have flaming swords depicted on their armour, symbolising the Sword of Mercy that provided the Mercy Kill to the Prophet Andraste when she was put to the flame. Their actual weapons however are normal steel, presumably because their Anti-Magic abilities render enchanted blades useless, since any magical flames would be quickly snuffed out.
    -   The Inquisitor wields one in promotional art for _Dragon Age: Inquisition,_ as a nod to the fact that the character is the Herald of Andraste. Whether s/he uses one in the game is up to the player.
-   The Elf's Salamander Oil skill in _Dragon's Crown_ lets her coat her dagger in fire while its active, dealing more damage against certain enemies and inflicting Burn status to those it hits.
-   _Dragon Quest_:
    -   The series has these as a staple, and will typically cast a fire spell when used as an item.
    -   _Dragon Quest_: The Flame Sword is the second most powerful weapon you can wield.
-   In _Drakan_, one of the pickup weapons Rynn can use is this. Not only does it set its victims on fire when it hits, it even doubles as a torch for illuminating dark places. As a bonus, the first one Rynn gets to pick up has an alternate attack that creates an expanding ring of fire that burns everything around her. Unlike most swords of this type, the one in this game is not so durable.
-   One _Dwarf Fortress_ succession fort, Deathgate, somehow ended up with a sword made out of fire. This fire was part of a demon's corpse that the moody dwarf had somehow dragged to its forge. It proceeded to kill the three dwarves who were assigned to bring it to its shrine.
-   _Elden Ring_ has several examples:
    -   Fire Grease can be applied to normal weapons to make them flaming ones temporarily.
    -   The Ash of War "Flame Strike" can grant a weapon flame properties briefly if the initial strike is followed up with a strong attack.
    -   The Blasphemous Blade is an inversion in that the sword itself isn't lit up with flames but does inflict fire damage. Its unique Ash of War "Taker's Flame" also unleashes a wave of life-stealing flame at enemies.
    -   Helphen's Steeple's Ash of War "Ruinous Ghostflame" temporarily covers the sword with Cold Flames instead of regular fire, adding Magic damage and Frostbite buildup to attacks.
    -   The Godslayer's Greatsword's Ash of War "The Queen's Black Flame" covers the sword with Black Flame which deals fire damage and inflicts a brief hitpoint sapping effect. This effect is _proportional_ to the target's maximum health, making it more effective against opponents with large health pools.
    -   A few Man-Serpents wield **magma** curved swords which can be farmed off of them for the player's use.
    -   When a Magma Wyrm Turns Red they spit magma on to their massive curved greatswords. One Magma Wyrm drops this sword after defeat. The Magma Wyrm's Scalesword's Ash of War "Magma Guillotine" has the player smash the sword into the ground and cause a small eruption of magma.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   Throughout the series, you can find countless swords enchanted with fire damage (or enchant one yourself). And it's not limited to swords either, you can enchant _any_ weapon with such an effect. Downplayed in that they won't actually be _on fire_, but they will have a slight red/orange sheen and will inflict fire damage upon strike.
    -   _Morrowind_'s _Tribunal_ expansion has you tasked with reforging Trueflame, the flaming iconic weapon of the original Nerevar. Unlike a standard fire-enchanted weapon, it does actually burn with flames. (The flaming component turns out to be a rare tar that burns eternally when set alight, but has become Lost Technology since the blade was originally forged, complicating matters.) Tribunal deity and the original Nerevar's wife, Almalexia, wields its twin blade Hopesfire, a lightning equivalent.
    -   The Sword of the Crusader, in the _Knights of the Nine_ expansion to _Oblivion_. Like the Trueflame in _Tribunal_, you first need to recover it as an ordinary sword, and in this case, reconsecrate it to the Divines before it will light on fire for you.
-   In the doujin fighting game _Eternal Fighter Zero_, Mishio Amano's fighting style involves enchanting her spear with fire or lightning to access different movesets.
-   In _Eternal Sonata_, any BFS in Jazz's hands can be used in the special attack Heat Blade. "The fire on the blade burns all."
-   Any melee weapon with a Flame Augmentation in _Fable_ will do this from time to time. You can put a Flame Augmentation on a _frying pan_.
-   _Fallout 3_'s Shishkebab is one of these. The ingredients? Lawn mower blade for the blade itself, motorcycle gas tank for the fuel storage, motorcycle handbreak for the handle/trigger, and pilot light to ignite it. With the right perks, it is one of the best melee weapons in the game, and flat-out _the most powerful_ in the pre-expansion game. It returns for _Fallout: New Vegas_, complete with a unique variant made available with the _Gun Runner's Arsenal_ DLC. It's still pretty good, though not quite as much as it was in _Fallout 3_.
    -   The Shishkebab returns in _Fallout 4_, where it is now more compact, no longer requires the motorcycle gas tank, and is made from a wakizashi rather than just a lawnmower blade.
-   _Fate_: You can double up on enhancements, creating a Flaming Sword of Fire. Weapons with Fire as a property can also have Frost, Lightning and/or Holy enhancements.
-   In the bootleg NES game _Felix the Cat by Dragon Co._, Felix the Cat's first power-up is gaining yellow Knight armor, complete with a (useless) shield and a sword that gets covered in flames each time he swings it on the ground. In mid-air, it doesn't have the flame effect, though.
-   _Final Fantasy_ games often have elemental weapons of this variety, or the means to apply the effect to your existing weapons, conveniently for sale at your local store. Or at least in some treasure chest somewhere. They also tend to include other elements to varying degrees. The Flametongue and Icebrand<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>  have been available since _Final Fantasy_, with many games including a Thunderblade to round out the classic trielemence.
    -   The Mystic Knight job originating in _Final Fantasy V_ can apply Black Magic spells to their sword. Among those spells is Fire.
    -   Vivi and Steiner collaborate to produce this effect in _Final Fantasy IX_.
    -   _Final Fantasy XI_ has such effects as native abilities for Red Mages and Summoners, as well as some weapons possessing some lesser effects.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   The Flame Sword in _Genealogy of the Holy War_ and _Thracia 776_, which can be used to sling fire at enemies outside melee range.
    -   The titular sword of _The Binding Blade_ has the same ability; Roy also sets it alight for his critical hit animation while wielding it.
-   _Flash of the Blade_ ends with a Sword Fight with you wielding the holy weapon called Lightbringer, against an Evil Weapon called Soulstealer who ignites itself to battle you.
-   In _Genshin Impact_, Hilichurl Berserkers wield flaming clubs that they'll charge at you with, and Blazing Axe Mitachurls wield flaming axes that they augment their attacks with. Both can have their weapons extinguished with Cryo or Hydro damage, but they'll reignite them after some time.
-   In _Ghost of Tsushima_, some Mongols will cover their swords in oil and ignite them to create a flaming blade. Jin Sakai, himself, can also set his katana aflame after learning the Undying Flame technique.
-   Kratos from _God of War_ has the Blades of Chaos, two short swords on the end of variable length chains that light on fire when he attacks with them but cool down when he hangs them from his back. In the Norse series, the Blades of Chaos' fiery properties actually come into play as Kratos digs them up in order to delve into Helheim. Not only can they deal fire damage but they can also be used to burn down certain thorns in the way.
    -   Ragnarok turns this up a notch by revealing that the Blades don’t contain just any fire, it’s _primordial_ fire, one of the original elements that created the world and the same one that Prometheus stole from the Olympians in Greek myth.
-   _Guild Wars_:
    -   First game: Fiery Dragon Sword, Fiery Embersteel Blade and Fiery Gladius. A quasi-inversion is the Icy Dragon Sword and the Glacial Blade. The Icy Dragon Sword even has blue 'flames'.
-   In _Guild Wars 2_, Rytlock Brimstone has the Sohothin, a flaming sword. Elementalists can also conjure fiery greatswords, which can be used by anyone against enemies.
-   Elemental effects are a large part of the _Guilty Gear_ games. Sol Badguy actually wields a sword that has no sharp edge or point but is a great vessel for his fire magic, and French cop Ky Kiske has a regular sword charged with lightning magic.
-   In the third _Heroes of Might and Magic_, there is an artifact called the Red Dragon Flame Tongue, part of a set of artifacts. In addition, the Archangels wield flaming swords which, for bonus points, are flamberges (a sword made to look like a flame). Also, while Armageddon's Blade isn't _technically_ on fire, its ability to call down a rain of fire on the battlefield surely counts for something.
-   The Judgment Of Shamash from _Honkai Impact 3rd_. A legendary weapon created from the remains of the Herrscher of Flames, the 7th Divine Key allows the user to wield flames in battle. Its more common form is as a pair of handguns, but its full power can only be unleashed when it takes the form of a great sword. The flames generated by the Judgment Of Shamash in its 0th form are so powerful, only its original user was able to wield it safely because he was An Ice Person. Over the centuries, it was wielded by many members of the Kaslana clan, an act that eventually cost their lives.
-   The _Ittle Dew_ series has Fire Swords with practical applications, such as lighting torches:
    -   The Fire Sword in _Ittle Dew_ is usually the first item a player will acquire.
    -   The Fire Sword in _Ittle Dew 2_ is in the Star Woods Dungeon.
-   _Joe Dever's Lone Wolf_: in act III you may run into Drakkarim soldiers wielding blades coated in oil and set ablaze: all their melee attacks have a chance of setting Lone Wolf ablaze, dealing massive damage over time. This trick was apparently devised by the Big Bad of the game, Lord Gunzar.
-   _Just Breed_ has a truly nasty one, overlapping with Fire-Breathing Weapon — it's just called a generic 'flame sword', but every time you attack with it, it hits nearly half the battlefield with an absurdly massive area-effect cone of fire.
-   _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_ has the Firestorm Command Style which wraps the Keyblade in a shroud of flames.
-   _Kingdom of Loathing_: To start off, there's the _flaming cardboard sword_, where even the narrator wonders why it doesn't crumble to a crisp. There's also the icy-hot katana, along the same lines as the Sword of Fire and Ice mentioned for _Magic: the Gathering_.
-   _Kirby_:
    -   Combining the Cutter and Fire powers in _Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards_ resulted in a flaming sword that is about twice his size.
    -   In _Squeak Squad_, it's combining fire and sword, naturally. Not big, but appropriately fiery.
    -   Not only does this combination return in _Star Allies_ if a swordfighter is given the "Sizzle" element, but the recurring boss Flamberge also wields one herself.
-   In _League of Legends_:
    -   Kayle can set her sword on fire. This also gives her Sword Beams.
    -   Gangplank's passive has him ignite his cutlass.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   In _Phantom Hourglass_, if you return 10 Power Gems to the spring at Spirit Island, and equip the Fairy of Power, Link's sword becomes coated in flames. Ten more and they burn hotter and the tip is aflame.
    -   _Spirit Tracks_ gives these kinds of swords to Torch Phantoms so as to act as a light source; beyond that, there's nothing else different about them.
    -   In _Breath of the Wild_, there's the Flameblade and Great Flameblade (as well as the Flamespear), which on the surface look like ordinary heated weapons, but ignite when slashing and set everything in their path ablaze. You can also set wooden weapons on fire for a similar, yet weaker effect. The sequel changes the weapon system so that you can't find these in the wild, but you can certainly build them by fusing a Fire-Breath Lizalfos horn to the end of a weapon.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: Conquest_ has warriors that can set their swords on fire. Not many people were pleased with it.
-   In _Lost Odyssey_, wearing a fire-elemental ring gives you one of these (or a flaming staff, or what have you.) There are also air, earth and water variants for their respective rings.
-   The Fire Sword is one of Nash's earliest power-ups in _Lucifer Ring_, which sets his blade alight and handily hacks up most enemies with ease.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   Zero gets many techniques that use these in the _Mega Man X_ and _Zero_ series. Most of these attacks are executed in a manner similar to the Shoryuken.
    -   The weapon of Sword Man (which Mega Man can acquire) in _Mega Man 8_ is called the Flame Sword. Or "Flame Suword".
    -   Throughout the _Mega Man Battle Network_ series, Swordy Two enemies have flaming swords and Swordy Three enemies have ice swords. You _also_ have fire and ice swords once you've beaten them. In the third game, along with the fire and ice swords, there are also swords made of electricity and bamboo. There is even a Program Advance in that game that allows you to smack your enemies with _all four swords_ in just _one and a half seconds_ for _massive_ elemental damage.
-   _Minecraft_: This trope can be invoked if you enchant a sword with the Fire Aspect enchantment. While the sword isn't physically on fire, any mob hit will be ignited for a few seconds. It's spinoff, _Minecraft Dungeons_ also allows the player to invoke this trope, provided it's one of the enchantments available for the weapon.
-   _Monster Hunter_ downplays this trope with swords, axes, hammers, etc. that only shed fire from their entails while hitting a monster.
-   _NetHack_ has a couple which seem to fit the bill; Fire Brand (which is actually pretty rubbish - its cold counterpart, Frost Brand, is _far_ more useful) and Sunsword (which is more for dealing with undead, but at least it doubles as a torch).
-   In _Neverwinter Nights_, the player can apply alchemical fire to a sword to make it burn and deal fire damage. You can also apply visual effects to swords with the toolset, which include (in addition to flaming) glowing yellow-white with holy power, dripping acid, crackling with electricity, giving off visible sound waves, generating a miniature blizzard, and glowing red with unholy power. The actual effects that the appearance would create require manipulating the weapon's properties too, though.
-   In _Nexus Clash_, the Holy Champion class can learn the Cloak of Flame skill. It turns the character into living fire, giving them a flaming sword, the ability to throw fireballs, a "rain of fire" area attack, and a burning aura.
-   _No More Heroes_ has Bad Girl, who wields a flaming _baseball bat_, made possible by her spitting alcohol all over it and lighting it up.
-   The Vulcans (not the space-elf kind!) from _Odin Sphere_ have flaming swords and flaming hair to match, and getting hit by them results in catching aflame for a good deal of time.
-   The Seven Strike in _Ōkami_ looks like it's on fire, as well as being red and orange. Despite this, it's not actually on fire - the effect is merely its prongs moving. The _actual_ fire weapon isn't a blade.
-   A sword (or axe, or mace) in _Overlord I_ will have a red glow that gives a similar effect if upgraded with red minions, although it doesn't actually have visible flames.
-   One of the forgeable weapons in _Overlord II_ is The Scorcher, a flaming sword made from a dragon's entrails. It even roars like a dragon when swung.
-   Zhin from _Paladins_ wields a flaming Chinese sword that sends out waves of fire with each swing. However, the fire is not magical and must be replenished by pouring oil onto the sword.
-   _Parasite Eve 2_'s Big Bad, No. 9, wields one of these in the first boss battle, before ditching it in favor of a gunblade in subsequent appearances.
-   In _Persona 3_, it's possible to obtain Surt's flaming sword as a weapon for the main character and Junpei.
-   _Phantasy Star Universe_ has the Crimson, an S-rank saber that glows red and is constantly on fire. There's also a Twin Saber version called the "Two-Headed Ragnus." Unfortunately, while they look badass, their damage output isn't that great compared to other S-ranks in the same category.
-   _Pirate Hunter_ have flaming swords the titular hunter can collect, which turns his cutlass into a fiery weapon capable of inflicting scorching damage on pirate mooks. If he have any surviving NPC Red Shirts around him, he can pass this weapon to all his allies so their cutlass and bayonets can incinerate foes as well.
-   You do not get to pick up and attack with a Flaming Sword in _Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame_. In Ancient Persia, a Flaming Sword picks itself up and attacks you!
-   In _Psychonauts_, Oleander's dad gets flaming meat cleavers the second time you fight him.
-   Paladins in Sierra's _Quest for Glory_ series have blue flaming swords. They're slightly more powerful than the Fighter's regular sword, but not by much.
-   In _Rastan_, the Fire Sword was the strongest of the weapons the title character could obtain, and would shoot fireballs when swung. _Rastan Saga II_ turned the flames into an add-on power-up instead of a weapon in itself.
-   In _Ristar_, this is one of the items you can find in one of the Bonus Stages. It is officially referred to in the game as the "Fire Blade".
-   _Romancing SaGa_:
    -   Not only is there a Flaming Sword, but an Ice Sword, an Earth Sword, a Water Sword, and an Illusory Sword as well, there is even a Flaming Axe; each allowing the wielder to channel certain types of magic.
    -   A Cosmic Keystone in the game is also one and can shift into 3 different types and helps channel magic as well.
-   _SaGa Frontier 2_: The Firebrand, Finney Kingdom's sacred treasure. Any potential king of Finney undergoes a Rite of Passage where they hold it up in the air and, if it generates flames, proves their worth as a ruler. But for Gustave XIII, nothing happens.
-   Kazuki in _Samurai Shodown_ wields a flaming sword. The series goes further in _Samurai Shodown V_ when a demon who looks like Kazuki wields Chains of Fire instead. _Samurai Shodown 2_ has the Weapons Kitchen Sink: Neinhalt Sieger has a flame-enhanced huge gauntlet (which also helps him with his flaming leap), and Wan-Fu uses a flaming stone pillar.
-   The Flameberge (not a typo) in _Scribblenauts_. Typing in "Flaming Sword" works just as well though.
-   In _Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2_, if Sparkster finds a flame orb, it powers up his sword, turning it into this and making it three times more powerful. If he gets hit, however, he loses its powers.
-   _Super Smash Bros._:
    -   Roy in most games barring _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_ has a normal special attack which coats the Binding Blade in fire and can be charged (but overdoing it makes him take damage), and his Final Smash is a flame-enhanced version of Marth's Critical Hit.
    -   Ike from _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_ has a normal special attack that creates a plume of fire by using Ragnell (Aether), and a Final Smash where he lands consecutive close hits while Ragnell is on fire (Grand Aether).
-   _Tales of Arise_ has the Blazing Sword, a physical manifestation of the astral energy contained in the master core of fire. In a deconstruction, it's too hot for any normal person to wield; the only reason Alphen is able to use it is because he can't feel pain, and he has an astonishing tendency to injure himself while fighting with it.
-   Kratos uses one of these in _Tales of Symphonia_. Near the end of the game, he gives it to his son, Lloyd.
-   _Terraria_:
    -   The Fiery Greatsword is one of the most powerful non-hardmode weapons. Sunfury is a flail version. The console-exclusive Infinity +1 Sword Tizona also emits flames when swung, although it doesn't look like it's on fire by default. The reason for the flames is in the name: Tizón translates to "burning stick" or "firebrand".
    -   Having a Magma Stone equipped and swinging any melee weapon will add a fiery particle effect to the weapon (and its projectiles) and set targets on fire.
    -   Equipping the Flame Gauntlet, wearing the full set of Frost Armor, or downing a Flask of Cursed Flames will add regular, frostburn, and cursed fire, respectively to your melee weapons. And yes, all three can be applied at the same time.
-   _Tibia_ has one aptly named Fire Sword, is not the best but most new players use one because is cheap.

    -   The incendiary trait gives high elven mages flaming attacks, along with enough other bonuses to turn their melee ability from Squishy Wizard to Glass Cannon.
-   In _Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil_, The Optional Boss Flandre Scarlet has a gigantic flaming _rod_, that's swung around as a sword. There's also Hinanawi Tenshi's sword. Both also appear in the fangame _Gensou Skydrift_ as part of their respective owners' Last Words, although only Flandre uses hers to attack directly.
-   In _Trine 2_, one of the knight's upgrades is the flaming sword, which increases damage, and is capable of lighting explosives.
-   You can snag one of these pretty early in _Ultima IX_. As with all good flaming swords, it doubles as a handy torch in the dark.
-   _Warcraft III_'s Doom Guards have them. Orc Blademasters don't use them, but they do come from the Burning Blade clan... unless they have an Orb of Fire, which orbits the hero's weapon and allows him to throw fireballs.
-   Enchanting weapons with elemental properties has been a staple of _World of Mana_. In _Trials of Mana_, Duran's dark-aligned classes all specialize in such magic, as does Charlotte's light-aligned classes. Two of Kevin's classes possess similar spells, which don't enhance a weapon's damage with an element, but instead add HP or MP draining effects.
-   _A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky_: The Fire Slash skill:
    
    Slashes the enemy with a flaming sword.
    
-   _World of Warcraft_: You can have an enchanter put a spell on your melee weapons, which some of these give your weapon a certain glow, whether it be on fire, blue for an icy death, or even green. There's also an Orc Clan whose weapons are flaming swords. Their name? The Burning Blade. Plus, if you excavate artifacts via the Archaeology profession in _Warlords of Draenor_, you learn that they use a kind of flammable oil called Blazegrease, which they would coat on their swords and which would ignite unpredictably when the wielder of the weapon was in combat, for the sheer intimidation factor.
-   The Promethean Blade power-up from _Xena: Warrior Princess_ sets Xena's sword on fire, which lasts for a whole minute. Every slash Xena inflicts will result in lingering burns that drains an enemy's health.
-   Pyra of _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_ has her version of the Aegis Sword emit flames from it, which protagonist Rex uses. She also joins Roy and Ike in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_. Another Rare Blade, Dagas, has a greataxe that emits blue flames when his Driver is in battle.
-   In _Yandere Simulator_ Yandere-chan can turn the Ritual Knife into this if she heats up the knife with blowtorches and then sticks the still hot-blade back into the skull. This convinces the Flame Demon to give her a taste of his fire and he ignites it. Anyone stabbed with that knife instantly catches fire.
-   This is a common weapon in the _Ys_ series. In most games, it's either the Infinity +1 Sword or close to it.
