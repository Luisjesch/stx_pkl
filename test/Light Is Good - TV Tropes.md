_"Then God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good."_

It's one of the deepest ideas in our collective (un)consciousness. The Sun brings heat, makes plants grow, helps us wake, explore, work, create. Gods of the Sun and Moon are associated with law, arts, the mind, justice, protection, inspiration, all the things that make up the best part of being _human._ (And even the _other_ nice thing about being human gets this treatment — Venus is, after all, the Morning Star.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) The light bulb coming on over one's head is the genesis of a great idea. By light we can see the world; by extension, light lets us confront evil and destroy it, both within and without ourselves.

It's the more or less obvious conclusion.

Almost _every_ RPG does this, some more than others. (It's _always_ the holy magic that heals, never the dark.) For characters with light-based powers with this connotation, see Light 'em Up. Holy Hand Grenade is not out of the question.

The corollary, of course, are Dark Is Evil and its sub-tropes. Light Is Not Good originated as a subversion of this trope. Note, however, that Good Is Not Nice can also come into play if said hero has an affinity for light, and both Light is Good and Light Is Not Good may come into play, as a Hypocrite tries to pose as a good guy by taking on the trappings suitable for the good guys. If a story wants to use Light is Good and Dark Is Not Evil at the same time, it's generally justified as both forces being necessary for a truly stable and peaceful world, with the perceived 'evil' of darkness being a misunderstanding between the sides. See Light/Darkness Juxtaposition.

Why having the sun appear is good. Also the reason White Magic is called that. Related to Heaven Above, since the sky and the light-bearing suns often go hand-in-hand when depicting the good God. This trope's relationship with the sun can often lend it to be used similarly to Rays from Heaven, Cue the Sun, and Watching the Sunset. See also Holy Halo, and Shining City. See also White Is Pure.

For more chromatic inspiration, see Color-Coded for Your Convenience. For light used as one of the Elemental Powers, see Light 'em Up.

Light Is Not Good is a subversion of this trope.

To counter her new dark-themed powers, Denji decided to fight her with the power of light… by lighting himself on fire after dousing himself with gasoline, using his new found “shining power” to jump a startled Doll Devil who couldn’t believe how psychotically stupid and determined her opponent was. To her horror, Denji’s plan worked; the Doll Devil’s regenerative powers slowed to a crawl from Denji’s attacks, forcing her throw all her human doll minions at him just to slow him down. In the end, he managed to rip apart her main body, then dunked her with Kobeni’s destroyed car, resulting in the Doll Devil blowing up in a fiery explosion.
-   _Death Note_:
    -   Subverted for Light Yagami. He appears to be a pretty good guy at first (or at worst a Well-Intentioned Extremist) whose ideas of morality and justice are just slightly askew.

-   The two main heroes in _Fullmetal Alchemist_ are blonde, with gold eyes to boot.
    -   That said, aside from the homunculi, the overwhelming majority of the villains invoke Light Is Not Good, and the only characters with anything resembling light powers are both villains.

-   Purity goes with light in _Sailor Moon_, and it becomes a common theme (most easily seen in the first anime's _SuperS_ season).

-   In _Kaiju Revolution_, Mothra is a brightly colored benevolent kaiju who produces light from her wings. In fact, her species replaced Ghidorah as Earth's light-based protectors after he went bad.
-   Deconstructed in _The Queen's Consort_, as while light is something embraced and dwelt upon by most of fairykind, it is not a simple case of "light = good, dark = bad". In-fact, one of the biggest dilemmas in the story is that a random solar flare gives Elsa magic-based amnesia, making things harder for when the ritual to keep the darkness away needs casting.
-   In _RainbowDoubleDash's Lunaverse_, a world defined by its fear of the Sun, Princess Cadence stands out as the one example of this trope. Despite her Incorruptible Pure Pureness, she still chooses to evoke the Sun in her dress and heraldry.

-   _Isle of Dogs_:
    -   Chief starts out as Dark Is Not Evil, being a black-furred dog with a gruff attitude and a determined attitude that helps his pack survive Trash Island.

-   The Light Side of the Force in _Star Wars_. The Expanded Universe is a bit more relaxed with this, though. Oddly enough, nobody ever calls it the "Light Side" in the original and prequel trilogies... it's only ever "The Force" and "The Dark Side of the Force."

    -   The first thing Bernadette, a genuinely good Christian, can think of when asked to describe Heaven is "a great light," before going on to describe the songs the saints will sing and the great joy they will feel.
    -   Maria's mother insists her daughter is given a white dress in the penultimate scene, because she believes her daughter has proven herself to be completely pure, ignoring how self-destructive Maria's devotion has become.
-   _Terminator: Dark Fate_: The heroic cyborg, Grace has a golden subdermal armor who was sent to the past to protect Dani, in contrast to the Rev-9, the Terminator sent to kill Dani, who has a black endoskeleton and liquid metal skin.

    Literature 

-   In mythology and fantasy stories, light (particularly sunlight) severely impairs or even harms monsters.
-   _The Armor of Light_ by Melissa Scott and Lisa A. Barnett.
-   The Child of Light (and the Prophecy of Light) in _The Belgariad_.
-   In Poul Anderson's "Brave To Be A King", a beggar urges, "Alms for the love of Light!" Later, two time travelers makes themselves glow to convince a king that they are heavenly messengers.
-   The Light Casters from _The Caster Chronicles_. They have light-based magic, and are good-natured and heroic.
-   T. S. Eliot's _Choruses from "The Rock"_
-   Downplayed in Jeramey Kraatz's _The Cloak Society_. Still, light powers belong to good characters.
-   The Light in _The Dark is Rising_ series of novels is good, but not nice. However, while Dark Is Evil is mostly played straight, Light occasionally is actually evil as well too, with later installments blatantly stating that balance is better.
-   _Daughter Of The Son_: Orsina is a paladin, with her organization being called the Order of the Sun. Further, her sword can be lit up to guide her way after she prays to trigger it. She's the titular Daughter of the Sun as well naturally. The symbol of the Order is a golden sun, which Orsina wears on her tabard. She can also cast a shield made from golden light around herself.
-   As Dante explains in _The Divine Comedy_, "On high, joy is made manifest by brightness, as, here on earth, by smile." What he means is that the saints living in Paradise are encased in light that gets progressively brighter the closer they are to God. By the time Dante has ascended the first three spheres of Heaven, the light of the blessed is too bright for Dante to recognize people he knew back on Earth.
-   In _The Dresden Files_, sunlight is anathema to most creatures of the Nevernever, and can disrupt more negative and evil enchantments and spells. Also, the Swords of the Cross emit light that cancels out the powers of the Denarians.
    -   Plus the Summer Faeries tend to be fairly benevolent whereas the Winter ones are actively sadistic, although both sides are manipulative and capable of great crimes, when you put the two Courts next to one another it is played fairly straight
    -   The Archangel Uriel, who means a _the Light of God_ appears several times in the series, both to offer help to Harry, Giving Harry the power to use Soulfire to counter-act Hellfire.
-   King Arthur's diatribe against the night from _The Faerie Queene_ includes a brief praise for the day. He describes how it exposes evil for all to see and gives rise to honesty that humanity needs in order to thrive.
    
    _"For day discouers all dishonest wayes, / And sheweth each thing, as it is indeed: / The prayses of high God he faire displayes, / And his large bountie rightly doth areed."_
    
-   In _Gone_, the main protagonist, Sam Temple, gains the ability to create "Sammy Suns", orbs of green light, and later, the ability to fire lasers.
-   _Harry Potter_: Given _J. K. Rowling's_ dedication to Meaningful Names, it is hardly a coincidence that the Albus Dumbledore's first name means 'white'.
    -   The Patronus Charm, a powerful defensive spell, manifests itself as a luminescent silver animal, which is used to drive off the Dementors. Word of God states that any Dark Wizards or Witches attempting to create a Patronus would instead be devoured by maggots erupting from their wand.
-   James Herbert:
    -   _The Dark_: Light sources hold at bay the titular Dark, an ethereal concentration of darkness-embodied malignancy which drives people murderously insane.
    -   _Portent_: Multicoloured spectral orbs, while portentous to natural disaster, are part of a force which intends humanity's survival.
    -   _Once_: Tiny, winged, brightly glowing _faerefolkis_ prove to be benevolent.
    -   _The Secret of Crickley Hall_: Benevolent ghosts appear as white shadows, brilliant points of light, and radiant orbs.
-   The default in _The Lord of the Rings_ and J. R. R. Tolkien's other words, though there's more subtlety to it than that: the Elves are associated with the cold light of the stars and later the moon, while Men are associated with the hotter, harsher light of the Sun. Tom Bombadil also notes that he remembers when 'the dark under the stars was fearless, before the Dark Lord came from Outside', so Dark is not intrinsically evil.
-   In Robert A. Heinlein's _Magic, Inc._, the heroes storm Hell because light always overcomes darkness (since darkness is merely the absence of light), and they are the forces of Light, so it does not behoove them to sit around reacting to the demonic forces.
-   In Jennifer Crusie's _Maybe This Time_, Andie urges ghosts to Go into the Light, assuring them that it's probably good, because light is.
-   In Teresa Frohock's _Miserere: An Autumn Tale_, only good guys can cast the light spell. It is not very powerful, but very useful for establishing yourself.
-   _Mistborn: The Original Trilogy_:
    -   Elend, when he becomes the Good King and later Emperor, he dons an all-white outfit, in contrast to Vin's black clothes.
    -   The Big Good, Preservation, associated with white; as he manifests as the white mist, and opposes Ruin, the Big Bad God of Evil who is associated with black.
-   Light magic in _My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!_ is only confirmed to be able to dispel curses, detect dark magic and heal injuries. The only major character to have this affinity is also an All-Loving Hero in all timelines.
-   _Night Watch (Series)_: Light Others live and breathe this trope... though, it can be said that the series examines this trope, bends it, reshapes it, subverts it, _averts_ it, and when all else is lost, the author throws in the towel and says that all bets are off.
    -   It's a bit of a deconstruction of Character Alignment in general, but this in particular: the series features both Totalitarian Utilitarians and Knights Templar as a means to explore how people who can't knowingly betray their principles can still cause a lot of damage. At one point one of the Dark Ones invokes Evil Is Petty to explain why the Light Ones with their world-encompassing ambitions are so much more dangerous than the Dark Ones who are just selfish.
-   _An Outcast in Another World_ has a more literal example. His trip through the void has traumatized Rob, and complete darkness freaks him out. Mentally speaking, natural life is his friend and ally. Dungeon entrances are also pitch-black to signify how dangerous they are.
-   The poem "Oxalis", by Nancy Cato, lovingly describes the flowers gleaming "like a streak of sunlight".
-   In John Milton's _Paradise Lost_, continually used, for the angels, include those that later fell.
    
    _how chang'd  
    From him, who in the happy Realms of Light  
    Cloth'd with transcendent brightness didst outshine  
    Myriads though bright_
    
-   In L. Jagi Lamplighter's _Prospero Lost_, Father Christmas tells Miranda, Mab and Mephisto that they can stay a while because all who serve the Light are welcome.
-   In the land of Caederan, Light is one of the two "supra-elements" that surround and infuse the four elemental magics. Each element has a light aspect, which is the proper and natural use of that element. In addition, it is possible for someone to turn you into an orah, those who "live aligned with light alone," and can access the light side of each of the four elemental magics. It's mentioned specifically that fire called by an orah burns hotter and cleaner, and is much easier to prevent from running amok, as compared to fire called by an aesh.
-   This is a major element of the setting in _Shadow of the Conqueror_ alongside Dark Is Evil. The de facto religion of Hamahra, Lightseeking, seems to be based on this.
-   _Slayers TRY_ introduces Filia Ul Copt. She is the Good Shepherd of Cepheid, wears white, and has holy magical abilities.
-   In _Smoke and Shadows_, the heroes call upon "The Light of Yeramathia" to destroy the Shadowlord.
-   In Robin McKinley's _Sunshine_, Sunshine herself. Yolonda wisely refuses to believe evil of anyone who draws power from sunlight even though she hobnobs with a vampire.
-   _Tairen Soul_:
    -   A term of romantic endearment between Fey is: "The Great Sun rises in your eyes, beloved."
    -   The heroine is compared favorably to Erimea, an in-universe star that illuminates the dark skies of winter.
    -   When Ellysetta saves the tairen cubs, their souls are depicted as living light, in stark contrast to the Well's anonymous shadows.
-   Subverted in a weird way in Eve Forward's _Villains by Necessity_ with the Good/Light side. With the "heroes" of the world constantly eradicating every single evil they come across, thus endangering the world's balance, it quickly becomes clear that they don't exactly live up the "Good" part in their name.
-   In _Warrior Cats_, characters use rhetoric about the heroes being light fighting the darkness, their ancestors become stars, and the cats go to the Moonstone which allows them to contact their benevolent ancestors and glows with moonlight. Most cats with light-related names are clearly good (Firestar, Whitestorm, Whitewing, Sunstar, Moonflower, Brightheart, Briarlight, Brightspirit, Shiningheart, etc.) — everyone besides Sol.
-   _The Waterfire Saga_:
    -   The friendly optimist Neela just so happens to have light-based powers, meaning that her body constantly glows. Naturally, she glows brightest when happy.
    -   In the first book's finale, the protagonists cast a spell that merges their souls (and various magical powers). This results in the heroes glowing with Neela's shared magic.
-   In the _Wheel of Time_ series, the Creator and the Light.
    -   Subverted (for the most part) with the Children of the Light.
-   Diane Duane's _Young Wizards_ series works with this considerably, especially in the first book, although they play with it increasingly through the series and at the end of the third book have a decisive Redemption arc where it is shown that Dark Does Not Have To Be Bad. The fact that the Powers don't live within linear time means there are still loads and loads of incarnations of the Lone One running around being evil for books and books more, but they've finally given him the chance to start going home.

    Myths & Religion 

-   In the Lusitanian Mythology, the god Endovelicus was associated with light and healing, being obviously benevolent. However, the same mythology also has Neto, a sun god associated with war, and when Christianity settled in Endovelicus became identified with Lucifer.
-   Norse Mythology has multiple examples:
    -   Freyr, the god of Summer, closely associated with the sun, and was an agricultural deity, and largely considered a benevolent force.
    -   Baldr, the god of light is another example, as many describe him as being the most benevolent and beloved of gods. The "Prose Edda" describes him as being "most gracious" and "fairly spoken".
    -   Heimdall also counts, as he represents the benefits of fire.
    -   Sunna, Goddess of the sun counts, as her shield Svalin protects the world from being burned in a flaming inferno.
-   Manichaean scripture spread the idea of light being good and darkness being evil, which is likely why it sometimes shows up in mainstream Christian rhetoric despite the Bible not favoring either (as in the cases of Milcom, Satan and Lucifer being bad and the shade of the lord good). However, there are many a passage in canon Christian scripture that can be taken this way if not put against the work as a whole.
    -   I John 1:7 — But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.
    -   Job 33:28 — He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'
    -   Psalm 18:28 — You, O LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light.
    -   Isaiah 50:10 — Let him who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.
    -   John 1:4-5 — In him was life, and that life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.
    -   Romans 13:12 — The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
-   Islam: The Qur'an has the An-Nur (Meaning The Light) chapter that compares God to a majestic light:
    
    24:35: "Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is a niche wherein is a lamp—the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a glittering star—lit from a blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western, whose oil almost lights up, though fire should not touch it. Light upon light. Allah guides to His Light whomever He wishes. Allah draws parables for mankind, and Allah has knowledge of all things.
    
    -   The Islamic depiction of angels are as being made of light that serve God's will, and as a result are incapable of sinning.
-   Amaterasu of the Japanese pantheon is this trope taken to the umpteenth degree, being both the resident Goddess of the Sun and Goddess of Good. While almost all other gods of the Shinto pantheon have at least one temporary lapse into Jerkass God territory each, the worst slip-up Amaterasu ever had was when she hid away in a cave, denying the world her light for a time, and that was after her brother Susano'o, resident God of Storms, butchered one of Amaterasu's horses and fatally threw its carcass at one of her handmaidens.
-   Celtic Mythology has Lugh the Long-Handed, is the god of the sun and light in general, fertility, and famous for having liberated Ireland from the monster Balor. There is also Brigid goddess of healing, pottery and smithwork and was associated with light and the sun. A beloved Goddess, the Christians chose to make her a saint instead of demonizing her like the rest of the Irish pagan gods.
-   In Zoroastrianism, Ahuras / Yazatas are venerated beings of Zoroastriansim, and closely associated with light. In fact, Zoroastrianism is the first religion to embrace the Light Is Good / Dark Is Evil Duality, making this a Ur-Example.
-   Aztec Mythology has two examples:
    -   Quetzalcoatl is god of light, the Morning Star, and his human form is described as being very light-skinned, and he was a benevolent god, and the only god who did not demand human sacrifices.
    -   Nanahuatzin who changed his name to Tonatiuh, the sun god, who stepped up and sacrificed himself, became the sun god when Tecciztecatl refused to do so. Played with a bit, as he as called for human sacrifices to keep the sun from moving across the sky.
-   Egyptian Mythology has Ra, the Sun God, and Top God of the Pantheon, and responsible for protecting reality from Apophis, the embodiment of chaos and destruction.
-   Hindu Mythology has several examples:
    -   Surya the Sun God who was responsible for bringing light to the world, and teaching the hero Hanuman.
    -   The sister Goddesses Usha, Goddess of the Dawn who drives the demons of the night away, and Rati, the goddess of the Night, embodied by the stars who keeps the demons away during the night.
    -   Shiva is an odd example as he is a Destroyer Deity, but also the god of change and rebirth.
-   Inca Mythology has Inti the Sun god, who is largely seen as a benevolent and generous deity, as he is responsible for light to grow crops.The Inca considered him the patron god of their empire.
-   _The Kalevala_: Ilmatar, a virgin spirit of the air who helped create the world, and wears white and when appearing is sometimes surrounded by light/shining aura. She is very benevolent and her purposes, despite the passivity, are good.

    Sports 

-   Canadian figure skater Beres Clements performed to the _Angels & Demons_ soundtrack for his long program during the 2020-2021 competitive season, and the white part of his costume represents the angels in the title.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Sun gods in _Dungeons & Dragons_ are generally always of a good alignment. Pelor from Greyhawk is Neutral Good, Lathander from the Forgotten Realms is Neutral Good. Amaunator, the defunct Netheril sun god, averted this trope by being Lawful Neutral, but upon being reinstated in the fourth edition (by fusing with Lathander) became Lawful Good. He became Lawful Neutral again in 5th edition.
    -   Prior to the 4th edition, where they could be good or evil, angels and metallic dragons, who will actively attempt to aid weaker races. The 4th edition still played this straight with the good dragon god Bahamut.
-   _Exalted_ gives us The Unconquered Sun, the divine embodiment of virtue and righteousness, created by the Primordial of dickery solely because he wanted to find out what would give him purpose. And boy, did he succeed there, as the Unconquered Sun saw that the Primordials were yoking Creation about and helped lead the struggle to overthrow them. His chosen, the Solar Exalted, are supposed to be like this... save for that little Great Curse thing.
-   The white color in _Magic: The Gathering_ uses a sun for its symbol. It has by far the lion's share of cards concerning healing, protection, spells that disarm creatures or only destroy/remove creatures when they attack you, and creatures traditionally associated with good such as angels, knights in shining armor and honest soldiers. Depending on the block, white cards can just as easily make for Light Is Not Good, however.
    -   In terms of characters wielding White Magic, the most famous are heroic, but there's a sufficiently large amount of paranoid Knight Templars as well. So light is neutral in this setting.
-   In _Nobilis_, the Magisters of the Light are the manifestations of humanity's desire to survive and are protective of human life. Zig-zagged, however, as that can mean becoming Well Intentioned Extremists protecting humanity at any cost, and the ethics vary between individual members, but generally, they prefer moral methods for their goals.
-   _Princess: The Hopeful_: Includes this as the Magical Girl heroes powers come from Light, which is formed from there feelings of love, compassion, and friendship. Notably, each act of good brings more light into the world. They also fight against the Darkness, an all-consuming force that seeks to destroy everything on Earth.
-   _Sentinels of the Multiverse_
    -   Fanatic; plays with this, as she is a hero with white, angelic wings, and has holy-type powers, but as the name implies, she does lead towards Knight Templar tendencies.
    -   Dr. Medico of The Southwest Sentinels / Void Guard, as a being made of golden light and Actual Pacifist who uses his powers to heal others.
-   Both subverted and played straight with the Living Saints of _Warhammer 40,000_. They are shining examples of all that's good about humanity, avatars of the Immortal God-Emperor of Mankind, shining with light that causes most heretics to repent and desire to serve the Imperium, that fills the hearts of the faithful with unshakable courage and joy in serving the Emperor. Within the Imperium, almost universally accepted as unambiguously morally good, serving humanity selflessly in and out of combat and eventually sacrificing their lives for the good of the Imperium. Outside the Imperium, they're probably viewed no better than any other Imperial tool.
-   The Stellaknight archetypes' appearance and implied role in the _Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG_ saga started in The Duelist Advent implies that they are benevolent or even heroic.

    Theatre 

-   Cats: Victoria, the pure white kitten is a sweet and kind kitten who is one of the first to accept Grizabella and the very first to physically touch her.

    -   _Michael Jackson THEIMMORTAL World Tour_ had the Mime,
    -   _Michael Jackson ONE_: the MJ Warriors wear white and fight against the evil Tabloid Junkies who are Redand Blackand Evil All Over.
-   In John Milton's _Comus_, the older brother invokes this to assure his younger brother:
    
    _Virtue could see to do what Virtue would  
    By her own radiant light, though sun and moon  
    Were in the flat sea sunk._
    
-   Jesus Christ Superstar: Jesus Christ in the play is wearing white clothes in most productions.
-   William Shakespeare's _Macbeth_ invokes it:
    
    _Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;  
    Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,  
    Yet grace must still look so._

-   In _BIONICLE_, every sentient character has a dark side and light side, representing good and evil. These could be tapped into, to obtain either light or shadow powers, and naturally, shadow is easier to master and makes one corrupt. To those who have light or shadow powers from the get-go, obtaining the opposite "element" can prove difficult, since the two powers tend to cancel each other out. This is a mostly late development, however. While bad guys were since early associated with darkness, the light in Bionicle was originally more ambiguous and meant to be "special" rather than "good".
-   The _Transformers_' god, Primus, is often referred to as the "Lord of Light", and the Matrix of Leadership is meant to "light our darkest hour."

    Video Games 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies_, Bobby Fulbright, the main detective of the game, wears a white outfit and is dedicated to pursuing justice. Sadly, the spy who killed him and stole his identity doesn't hold those ideals himself.
    -   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_: Nahyuta Sahdmadhi, the main prosecutor who wears an all-white outfit with gold accents and has pale hair appears to be an antagonist, but only agrees because his mother and sister are being threatened, and is one of the Defiant Dragons trying to overthrow the corrupt regime, and at the end of the game, becomes the Good Chancellor.
-   In _Alan Wake_, light is _so_ good that flashbang grenades are lethal against evil.
    -   The sheer brightness from the lighthouse in the second DLC "The Writer" is very much One-Hit Kill against the Taken. So as long the boulders are cleared out.
-   _Assassin's Creed_: The titular Assassin Brotherhood is an organization driven to protecting humanity's free will from the manipulations of the Templar Order, and are closely associated with the colors white and red and the main outfit for many of the heroes such as Altaïr, Connor, Ezio, Desmond, Bayek and Aya). The Assassin robe is usually a white, hooded outfit with a red sash. Their creed even specifically mentions "we work in the dark, to serve the light."
-   _Bayonetta_ has angels who avert this trope big time, but the Lumen Sages they work with play it straight, when the sages aren't being brainwashed.
-   _BlazBlue_: Hakumen, the de facto leader of the Six Heroes who defeated the Black Beast, and wears white armour, and calls himself the White Void. He appears as the Hero Antagonist of the game, and is an Anti-Hero with Good Is Not Nice tendencies, though he mellows out later on.
-   _Boktai_ has the solar child Django and his solar empowered gun.
-   Aurora, the titular _Child of Light_ has light-elemental powers that she uses to fight the Queen of Darkness. She wears light yellow clothing and a completely white outfit at the end of the game.
-   _Darksiders_
    -   The angels are this, as they are Hero Antagonists in the beginning, but eventually help against a common threat. Archangel Uriel, for instance, does a Face–Heel Turn after discovering Abbadon's treachery, Azrael assists War in the second game, Nathaniel helps the fight against the Corruption, and Jamaerah is a decent fellow once freed of the Corruption.
    -   Strife, the Rider of the White Horse, wears a white mask, and is the Horseman most dedicated to saving humanity.
-   _Destiny_ has the Traveler, a Big Good bright white object is what's been keeping the human race alive for hundreds of years. The beneficial powers it grants are even called "Light." It acts as the main opponent of the Big Bad, The Darkness,which is responsible for driving humanity into near-extinction.
    -   The Speaker of the Tower, who acts as an interpreter of the Traveler and is the secondary Big Good, wears a white masks and robes.
-   _Devil May Cry_:
    -   _Devil May Cry 1_: Trish has blonde hair, lightning powers and later games depict her with a Devil Trigger that surrounds her with yellow lightning bolts. She is also named after Beatrice, one of the heroines in _The Divine Comedy_ who served as one of Dante's guides.
    -   _Devil May Cry 2_: Lucia is the most blatant example in the franchise. She wears a white cape, her name is Latin for "light" and her Devil Trigger more resembles an angel than a demon.
    -   _Devil May Cry 3_: Lady wears a white top and her true name is a reference to the Virgin Mary.
    -   _Devil May Cry 5_: Nero's true Devil Trigger has a more human/angel look compared to Dante's, lacking the reptilean features and having feathered wings.
    -   _Dm C Devil May Cry_: The reboot version of Dante falls under this, as he is half-angel in this game.
-   _Dragon Quest_ in general has light as a force of good and holiness, with the Big Bad usually representative of Dark Is Evil. It also works in gameplay: Usually _only_ the Hero of the game is capable of casting the Zap line of spells to symbolize their goodness.
-   The first _Fable_ has this in spades, with light clothing giving you good points and dark clothing giving you evil points, and good characters morphing to have lighter features. The sequels ease up on it, but it's still present.
-   The _Final Fantasy_ series uses this along with the brother trope:
    -   The Warrior of Light.
    -   _Final Fantasy III_ has the warriors of light, to contrast the equally heroic warriors of darkness.
    -   While Cecil Harvey originally followed the brother trope, he manages to redeem himself as a Paladin, originally being a Dark Knight.
    -   The white materia, Holy, in _Final Fantasy VII_, summoned by Aeris, is used to combat the Black Materia used by Sephiroth.
    -   In _Final Fantasy VII_ Minerva, the Guardian of the Lifestream, goddess of LOVELESS, and protector of the planet, wears white and gold armour.
    -   In _Final Fantasy VIII_, Rinoa Heartilly is associated with angel wings, being her Limit Break, a nice contrast from Squall, The Hero dressed in Black.
    -   In _Final Fantasy X_, Yuna serves primarily as The Heroine in a white/blue kimono. Her Summon Magic often involves light.
-   The _Fire Emblem_ series uses this often in combination with Dark Is Evil, especially in the older games. Light magic is often supereffective against dark magic, with users of light magic dealing heavy damage to dark magic users, while taking less damage from them in return. In games with monsters infesting the world map, light magic is supereffective against them as well. It's especially true in _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_ when the 11th-Hour Superpower, the light tome called the Book of Naga, is the only weapon capable of easily taking down the Big Bad, a demon-possessed dark mage from a Cult of evil dark mages whose tome ordinarily cuts all damage he receives in half.
-   _Gift_: Gift's Yellow Crystal power allows to kill Little Darks around him and survive in very dark places.
-   _God of War_ After God Of War I, Kratos is powered by the Light of Hope. His sole redeeming trait, for a given value of "redeeming", is his stubborn refusal to give up hope (of revenge, of closure, etc.) and die. Ultimately, the realization of the kind of power that gives him leads him to try to atone by killing himself and releasing hope to the world to help make up for the destruction he's caused.
-   _Guilty Gear_: The Missing Link: Ky Kiske is this in contrast to Sol's Dark Is Not Evil. He's wearing white and blue and uses lightning, and though he has Knight Templar tendencies early on, he quickly proves to be a Nice Guy through and through.
    -   While Sol Badguy is mainly a case of Dark Is Not Evil he possesses the Outrage Senga (which makes up part of his Junkyard Dog MK III sword in Xrd), which is capable of channeling and amplifying light-based magic.
-   In _The Haunted Mansion_ video game, evil ghosts cannot inhabit a lit room. Every puzzle in the game is figuring out how to light up the current room.
-   Palutena of _Kid Icarus_ is the good goddess of light. Her sister, in contrast, is the evil goddess of darkness. The Hero of the game is also rather light aligned with his own antagonistic Shadow Archetype to deal with, though he is aided by a shady Anti-Hero.
-   "I know now, without a doubt, _Kingdom Hearts_ is Light!"
    -   In the game proper, all the heroes, Sora, Roxas, Xion, King Mickey, Aqua, and Ven, all have light-based attacks.
    -   This is also carried over for Sora's Guest Fighter trailer in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_, as the light from his Keyblade is what allows all the other Smash characters to live again after the extinguising of the flaming Smash logo froze them into trophies. It serves as a direct contrast to _Ultimate_'s Big Bad Galeem, whose own light brought an end to the fighters' lives.
-   Lux and Leona from _League of Legends_ fit this to a T, the former having light-based skills while the latter has sun-symbolism.
-   _The Legend of Heroes - Trails_:
    -   _Trails in the Sky_: Ries has Mirage-aligned slots and her S-Crafts summon angelic creatures.
    -   _Trails from Zero_: Elie has silver hair, dresses in bright colors, and later on recieves Space as a secondary element, and is an all around Nice Girl and heroic individual.
    -   _Trails of Cold Steel_: Alisa's main Quartz element is Space, several of her Crafts are light-themed, and she has an angelic motif in her Master Quartz and S-Crafts (Radiant Ark gives her wings while the name of her S-Craft in III is taken from an angel).
-   This is a reoccurring theme in _The Legend of Zelda_ games:
    -   A reoccurring weapon that Link receives is the Arrow of Light. These are used against the main antagonists who have an affinity for darkness.
    -   One of Link's allies in _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ is Rauru, the Sage of Light. Also, like the aforementioned statement for the _Zelda_ series, one of Link's weapons is the Arrow of Light, which is used in the final battle against Ganondorf.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_, the Light Spirits of the four springs, who aid you and who keep the land peaceful.
    -   This trope is sprinkled liberally throughout the games as a whole. Many of the climatic scenes involving Link use dramatic lighting to grand effect — just watch any of the Master Sword sequences. Probably most prominently displayed thematically in _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_, where Ganondorf's dark power has corrupted the Sacred Realm (a Golden Land where the Triforce once resided) and turned it into the dangerous and evil Dark World. Subverted somewhat in _Twilight Princess_.
-   _LunarLux_:
    -   While all Lunex Warriors can use Lux Combos, Bella has a particularly strong affinity with Lux due to being a descendant of the Ancients. This allows her to use Lux to read the emotions of Murks and wield the Relic Sword.
    -   Although Chronos is an example of Dark Is Not Evil due to being a Murk, it turns out she can still use her Lux abilities that she had in her human life as Thea Grey. She uses this to temporarily transform into a blue glowing form resembling her human self.
-   Dr. Light, the good scientist in _Mega Man (Classic)_.
-   Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun and mother of all life, in _Ōkami_.
-   _Overwatch_ has several examples:
    -   Mercy, a healer who resembles an angel dressed in white, and the most non-violent members of Overwatch.
    -   Orisa, a green, yellow and white robot defender of the city of Numbani
    -   Symmetra, who uses Hard Light technology in her gameplay, and is the Token Good Teammate of Vishkar Corporation who also use HardLight, but are ''not'' this trope.
-   _Pokémon_: Ralts and its evolutions Kirlia and especially Gardevoir and Gallade are angel-like Psychic/Fairy-type Pokemon (pure Psychic-type prior to Generation VI and Psychic/Fighting-type for Gallade) who are predominantly colored white with green hair and are extremely loyal and protective towards their trainers.
-   _Pokémon Black and White_: _Pokémon Black_ has the player character pitting the white-colored Reshiram against N's black-colored Zekrom. _White_ inverts this, with the player pitting Zekrom against N's Reshiram.
-   _Pokémon Black 2 and White 2_: _Pokémon White 2_ has N using Reshiram to help the character battle against Ghetsis's Kyurem.
-   _Prayer of the Faithless_: The first Holy attack seen is Piercing Light, which is the initial way to Status-Buff Dispel monsters who power themselves up with the corrupting, violence-inducing magical force known as Miasma.
-   In _Shall We Date?: Angel or Devil_, two love interests are angels who wish to claim the protagonist.
-   _Shantae and the Pirate's Curse_ introduces to the series the concept of Light Magic, which is the power inherent to Benevolent Genies, and since the titular heroine is a half-genie, she naturally possessed it too. In addition to being the magic inherent to genies, Light Magic is the only thing that could harm the Dark Magic-fueled Pirate Master, though Light Magic could also be corrupted into Dark Magic if it was used for evil. However, the opposite is also true, and Dark Magic could be converted back into Light Magic if it's in the possession of a good person.
-   In _Smite_, if there's a Light-based deity (mostly sun), they're going to be good and benevolent deity, such as Khepri and Amaterasu. Ra zig-zags on this, though. He used to be a good deity of light, but then got horribly poisoned by Isis (she has her reasons) that he snaps and starts using his light more destructively while being a jerk about it, but he's still keeping the world light from being consumed by Apophis' darkness.
    -   Athena also counts, as she wears gold and white, and is mostly good, working to protect humanity from the gods that wish to enslave them; though she does have her Jerkass God moments, such as what she did to Arachne and Medusa.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_: Quite common among the good guys.
    -   Sonic and Shadow's Super Modes turn their fur gold.
    -   Tails is a fox with yellow fur. His own Super Mode surrounds him in a golden aura.
    -   Silver has white/silver fur and a Golden Super Mode like Sonic and Shadow. He even has a technique called "Shield of Light".
    -   _Sonic and the Black Knight_: The final battle against Merlina has Sonic wearing gold armor.
-   In _StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm_ after Kerrigan kills General Warfield, a beam of light shines on her face as she calls the Swarm off, allowing his men to escape.
-   In _Tales of Graces_, the Hero, Asbel Lhant, has a case of Chronic Hero Syndrome and frequently wears white in the game, so much so that it is lampshaded by Sophia at one point. Though we never hear the answer, Asbel had to think about it for a while.
-   _Total War: Warhammer_: Alarielle the Radiant, Everqueen of Ulthuan, is a High Elf who wears a beautiful gown of pure white, wields White Magic, is lithe and golden, and is possibly one of the kindest souls in the World.She likely embodies this trope better than any other character in the franchise.
-   The power of the Holy Light from the _Warcraft_ universe can only be used by good-hearted people (among other lesser requisites), has the power to heal and damages undead and demons. Sure there are people who aren't precisely good, however, they are able to use it since it still works if you're good only in your own mind.
    -   Of the members of the Alliance, the Exodar faction of the Draenei race make light their philosophy, and many of them use use light-based spells when attacking, and are considered least corrupted of the Alliance and the most dedicated to stopping the Legion. The Vindicaar faction of the Draenei also falls into this, having a gold and white coloration but are much more aggressive than the Exodar.
    -   Of the Draenor Gods, one of the most benevolent is Rukhmar the Sun Goddess, who combines this by having dark armour and head, but is a goddess of the sun.
    -   The night elf diety, Elune, the Moon Goddess, associated with the larger of Azeroth's two moons, the White Lady. She is a largely benevolent goddess, and implied to be one of the goddesses on the Holy Light.
    -   In the Player classes available, one of the choices is the Paladin, who draw power from the Holy Light, or in the case of the Sunwalkers Tauren Paladins, the sun.
-   Light represents life and benevolence in _Wick (2020)_. If Wick's flame goes out he dies, lighting candelabras sets them as checkpoints and the goal is to bring the light back into the cathedral and drive back the darkness. Mara and the demonic flies actively seek to prevent the light from being restored.
-   _XenoGears_: The last form of Fei's Weltall takes the appearance of a pure white mecha.
-   _Yakuza_: The Hero, Kazuma Kiryu, who wears white clothes, and is shown as a Nice Guy, so long as you don't do anything to make him angry. Like target his adopted daughter.
    -   The daughter in question, Haruka Sawamura, shares her adoptive father's white clothing and is a sweet and gentle girl.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_: There is a legend about silver eyes that says anyone born with silver eyes is destined to be a great warrior whose eyes shine like mirrors, reflecting the light of the world onto darkness. As a result, Silver-Eyed Warriors are believed to be able to kill the Grimm with merely a glance. Ruby Rose, who learns about this legend in Volume 3, is the silver-eyed leader of the fight against Salem, who has a great deal of interest in capturing her because of those eyes. Silver-Eyed Warriors possess the power of Light, being able to activate a blinding flash of pure light all around them that destroys any Grimm caughting with its effect. Grimm can be turned to stone, blinded or vapourised by this power. The power comes from the God of Light, who also had silver eyes, and Jinn implies that they may have been passed on to humanity through two silver-eyed children that were fathered during one of Ozma's past lives; Ozma's Resurrective Immortality was bestowed upon him by the God of Light when he was tasked with the job of redeeming humanity for a past wrong that was instigated by Salem, who targets Silver-Eyed Warriors for either death or corruption.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_ Both inverted and played straight in that Dr. Horrible (the villain/protagonist) wears white while Captain Hammer (the hero/antagonist)wears black. Dr. Horrible's white outfit also represents his innocence and kindness, which is sharply contrasted when he switches to a blood-red lab coat to represent the blood on his hands, and as a standard villain color to demonstrate that he's taking his villainy more seriously.
-   In _Worm_, Scion is this; he's a gold-skinned man dressed in white spandex who does nothing but save people. As of Interlude 26, this is averted in the worst possible way.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ includes the Order of the White Lotus, a secret society dedicated to transcending the borders of the four nations in the search of order and truth.

-   _Justice League: Gods and Monsters_: This version of Wonder Woman, Beka wears a primarily white costume, and out of the trinity, is closest to her traditionally heroic counterpart, counting as the Token Good Teammate.
-   Played with in Raava in _The Legend of Korra_. On the one hand, she is the spirit of light and peace, certainly better than Vaatu, and eventually fused with Wan to create the Avatar. On the other hand, she is also an example of Good Is Not Nice, given she has disdain against humans, to the point that she had to be convinced to work with a clearly repentant Wan. Her essence can also be used by malevolent people for their own purposes, like Unalaq, which is the first person seen to use light energy. Though the fact that he later only uses dark energy in his waterbending and Jinora uses light without a medium would fool you otherwise.
-   _Max Steel 2013_ The hero; Max McGarth aka Max Steel, dons a white suit of armour, in contrast to the black and green outfit of the original, though he does gain a similar suit later.

    -   Her closest allies Princess Glimmer and Queen Angella draw their power from the Moonstone, giving them light-based powers.

-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: The Daughter, a being that embodies the Light Side of the Force, being compassionate and selfless, and wears a white dress with gold decorations.
-   _Steven Universe_ plays with this trope. The Gems, beings made of Hard Light, are strongly associated with light, which enhances their visual of heroism and awesomeness. Rose Quartz is decked out in white and has a saintly appearance. However, over time we learn their faults and mistakes, showcasing that in spite of their initial image of perfection, the Crystal Gems are anything but, and have their own hang-ups that need to be solved through talking, not using a veneer of righteousness.
