**Jane:** Does he ever like to have a temper tantrum now and again? I mean, he's the CEO of a large company and that comes with a lot of pressure, so... maybe he likes to let off some steam, throw a vase around or something?  
**Grace:** Are you suggesting that Mr. Rochester, your employer? — makes sport of throwing decorative glassware? — in the middle of the night? — in his OWN HOUSE? — where his DAUGHTER sleeps? — because he needs to let off little STEAM — every once in a while?

Sometimes you are just _angry_. Angry enough that you decide to take it out on something or someone. Physically. This violent behavior may target a simple inanimate object, an opponent in a boxing match, or other similar situation, or maybe some convenient villain who happens to be in the area. Anyway, the point is that you are resolving your anger in a violent, but still somewhat socially acceptable way.

The psychiatric term for doing this in a therapeutic context is "catharsis". At one time this was all the rage, but it has fallen into disfavor among psychotherapists in the last few decades, as evidence has emerged that all it does is reward violent outbursts.

Can cross with Percussive Prevention if the person being prevented is getting on the preventer's nerves. Can cross with Percussive Shutdown in cases where a device stubbornly continues to function. This can also cross with Working Out Their Emotions, where they're getting some exercise while also pummeling something in anger. Contrast Get A Hold Of Yourself Man, where the violence is meant to help calm the victim, and Percussive Maintenance, when the violence is motivated (at least partially) by attempting to make something work. Cathartic Chores may involve a good deal of anger directed at things like surfaces or dishes that need to be cleaned. Contrast Cope by Creating.

Subtropes of violence against inanimate objects to relieve stress include:

-   Agitated Item Stomping
-   Appliance Defenestration
-   Burn Baby Burn
-   Dartboard of Hate
-   Distressed Woodchopping
-   Door Slam of Rage

-   Paper Destruction of Anger

-   _The Good Hunter_:
    -   Chapter 2 plays this trope for drama. Cyril sees red, subverts Bystander Syndrome, and beats up four noblemen that are harassing a commoner.

    -   Played for Laughs in _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_. Not that Rocket doesn't enjoy more lethal versions of this trope, but after he's guilt-tripped into doing something noble for once he repeatedly kicks a clump of grass sticking through the floor.

    "The Silastic Armorfiends were an insanely aggressive race who lived on the planet Striterax approximately twenty billion years ago 'when the universe was young'. They were extremely keen on fighting—one of the best ways to deal with a Silastic Armorfiend was to lock him in a room by himself, since he would beat himself up sooner or later. They wrecked the surface of their planet in constant wars, and the whole population lived within bunkers deep below the surface. ''In an attempt to deal with the problems their violent nature created, the Silastic Armorfiends passed a law that anybody who had to carry a weapon as part of their normal work (including policemen, security guards and primary school teachers) must spend a minimum of 45 minutes each day punching a sack of potatoes. It was hoped that this would allow them to work off their surplus aggression. This plan worked only until someone had the idea to simply shoot the potatoes, and the Silastic Armorfiends were excited about their 'first war for weeks'."

He never actually acts on those threats.

    **Morgana:** And killing things mends a broken heart?  
    **Arthur:** No, but it's good fun.

This, I think, is a ... porcelain tea service, in the style of Louis the 15th, isn't that right? _\[crash\]_ Now that's a fascinating sound! _\[tapping sound\]_ And this is called a "stained glass window," hand-crafted by your adoring flock ... they've gone to a lot of trouble to capture your likeness, haven't they? _\[smash\]_

Unlike every other QTE, however, this one doesn't end on it's own— it keeps going as long as the player continues to mash the button, past the point where the screen is a solid mass of red. It doesn't end until the player chooses to stop, allowing both Kratos and the player to work out their frustrations with everything Zeus has put them through.

-   The WiiWare game _Stop Stress_ is all about this trope, as you take control of a guy going around smacking things with a hand held object. However, playing the game is about as likely to induce stress as it will relieve it.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Queen of Thieves_, after an argument between Nikolai and the heroine late in his first season, Nikolai offers to let the heroine vent her frustration by taking some swings at him with one of his fencing sabers. It's particularly effective in this case because the root of their argument lay in each of them feeling that the other didn't trust them; letting her whack at him for a bit with a weapon, even a safely blunted practice weapon, not only provides the visceral satisfaction of catharsis but also serves as a concrete demonstration that they can and do trust one another.

    -   Zuko deals with his anger in this fashion _a lot_.
    -   The fact that the Fire Nation's firebending depends on rage is a plot point: once free of the need to work out his inner conflict (by realizing he should stop trying to win his father's approval despite recognizing that his father is a monster), Zuko can no longer use it, so he and Aang take a trip to meet the original firebenders: dragons.
