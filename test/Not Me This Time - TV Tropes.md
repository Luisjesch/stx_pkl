_"Oh, for crying out loud, no! I had no intention of committing any crimes!_ ...today._"_

In a series with a recurring Big Bad, it is sometimes the case that a side-villain or Monster of the Week is introduced to cause havoc and shake things up.

Of course, since this is a series with a recurring Big Bad, our heroes may feel perfectly justified in going after the usual suspects. This trope refers to such scenes, in which our regular villain is forced to inform the heroes that this installment's Evil Plan is not their doing. This may or may not be believed at first, but after the villain's innocence is established, expect them to curtly dismiss the heroes.

Traditional Truce Zone requirements mandate that regardless of all the crimes they committed _yesterday_, if caught for the wrong thing today, the heroes have to let them go. Either that or the Big Bad got Off on a Technicality for _yesterday's_ crimes. Another possibility is the usual villain not having been defeated yet - and the heroes don't want to waste time and resources on beating him right now, in the middle of a crisis.

This trope can be chalked up to The Law of Conservation of Detail: if you're going to have your villain appear, it might as well be relevant to the plot at hand.

An occasional subversion is for the usual suspect to claim innocence, convince the hero that somebody else did it... and then have it turn out that the original suspect is guilty after all. In some cases, the Frame-Up inspires the villain to actually do it afterward.

This trope may also occur with any character who has a recurring habit. It may or may not lead to Evil Versus Evil or Enemy Mine, depending on the story. A villain might be upset that they were blamed and maybe even suffered a beatdown for something they didn't do. Or that a plan of their own got thwarted because of the false accusation that made the hero seek them out. Or that they were accused of a crime they consider beneath themselves or almost denied a triumph they seek for themselves. Any of these reasons is enough for them to be pissed at the person who _really_ did it.

Also see Villains Out Shopping, which might explain the villain's innocence. Compare Guilty Until Someone Else Is Guilty, and Motive Misidentification, where the Big Bad is responsible, but for different reasons than the heroes initially suspect. Contrast Insists on Being Suspected, when they were never suspected in the first place, and Hijacked by Ganon, where it seems like a new villain is at fault but the Big Bad is revealed to be pulling the strings. May overlap with Card-Carrying Villain and/or Villains Never Lie if the heroes believe the story because it would be out of character for the villain to deny his crimes rather than boast about them.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Curtis_, Greg and Diane Wilkins are in their bedroom for the night, only to hear a crash originating from Curtis and Barry's room. They naturally assume that they got into a fight again.

The next strip reveals the cause for the crash were hailstones the size of eggs or golf balls.

    Films — Live-Action

-   At the end of _Bostock's Cup_, it becomes apparent that a large part of fictional team Bostock Stanley's surprise FA Cup run and eventual win was the result of the producer of the Film Within a Film that chronicled their run using bribery and other illicit means to get them to the final. However, he denies having rigged the final itself, pointing out that the film would have worked just as well if they lost, and that even if he'd wanted to, he knew that Bostock's final opponents, Leeds United, had probably already offered the referee a larger bribe than he could afford.
-   _The Bravados:_ Zachary and his men are guilty of multiple murders, but they didn't rob and kill Douglass's wife. In fact, they unknowingly rob and kill her actual murderer during their Run for the Border.

-   _Gremlins (1984)_: Billy rightfully suspects Mrs. Deagle of abusing his dog Barney by stringing the poor thing up with a bunch of Christmas lights, since she had already made threats to do even worse. However, she's not responsible, it was Stripe and the other evil Mogwai.

-   In _The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2_, When Snow is confronted by Katniss about the bombing that killed Prim, he tells her that he wasn't responsible, citing the fact that he would not do something so petty unless it benefited him.

    -   A far less humorous example comes in the followup, _Thor: Ragnarok_. When Thor and Loki find Odin to take him home, he serenely tells them that he hears his late wife calling to him. Thor angrily tells Loki to lift his enchantment but Loki's look of concern and subtle head shake confirms he's not to blame this time. Then Odin reveals that he had already broken free from Loki's spell.
    -   Lampshaded when Doctor Strange starts to open a portal beneath Loki's feet and he exclaims "This isn't me".
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides_: Jack Sparrow is believed to be trying to locate a ship to find the Fountain of Youth, as well as recruiting a crew.

While Slide is indeed a ruthless killing machine (and even rubs it into Joshua's face that if he could make Joshua suffer by killing his spouse, he _would_), turns out it isn't the case. The assassin who killed Joshua's wife is none other than the _other_ protagonist, Lai Lai Zhen, under Big Bad Powers' orders.

    Game Shows 

-   On _Taskmaster_, Alex _loves_ to sneak traps and pitfalls into tasks to trip up the contestants. So, during "Exit the caravan exactly 20 minutes after you entered the caravan", when Mae finds a clock on the roof that has moving gears but _doesn't work_, she and even Greg assume Alex did it deliberately to trip up contestants "lucky" enough to find and use it. Alex points out that this time it was Mother Nature:
    
    **Greg:** How's it make you feel that Alex would put a clock that doesn't work on the roof of the caravan?
    
    **Alex:** I need to point out here the clock _was_ working, but it rained during May's attempt and then it stopped working.
    
    **Greg:** Ahhhh. I thought it was one of your sneaky things that makes you all fizzy under your duvet.
    

    Music 

-   Bob Marley's "I Shot the Sheriff" has him confess to shooting the sheriff, but he then clarifies that he _didn't_ shoot the sheriff's deputy.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The during the rivalry between "Stone Cold" Steve Austin and The Rock for top superstar status during the Attitude Era, both wrestlers did a lot of ambush attacks on each other. The most brutal happened during _Survivor Series 1999_ when Stone Cold got run over by a car. The Rock, himself, didn't confirm nor deny he was responsible, so the battles continued. Nearly a year later it was revealed that The Rock wasn't behind the attack, it was his friend, real-life relative, and sometimes wrestling partner, Rikishi, who claims he did it to help him out as appreciation for breaking barriers as a person of color in the wrestling business and didn't want Steven Austin or anyone to stop his momentum (This was actually Blatant Lies; Rikishi was actually recruited to do so by Triple H).
    -   Speaking of Triple H, he was initially a suspect in the runover because he was scheduled to defend his WWF Championship against both Austin and The Rock that night and had attacked Stone Cold while he'd been giving an interview earlier that night that had led to Austin getting run over while he was chasing Triple H. Triple H claimed that while his attack on Austin was meant to be a plan on lead him into a beatdown by Triple H's D-Generation X cohorts, he hadn't ran over Austin (Of course, as revealed above, this was actually a Subversion, as while he hadn't done the actual runover, he'd gotten Rikishi to do it for him).
-   While in Ring of Honor, Raven wooed and recruited Trinity to humiliate and beat down CM Punk, who responded by calling on his girlfriend Lucy to do the same to Raven before fulfilling his obligations to Pro Wrestling ZERO1. When Punk returned from Japan, he found Lucy had been attacked and a calling card eerily similar to that used by Raven's Nest, but Raven was proven innocent, as it was actually the mark of the Prophecy, which lead to Punk leading the Second City Saints after the group's leader Christopher Daniels, who still wasn't the culprit. It was new recruit BJ Whitmer.
-   A third example occurred during the holiday season of 2008-2009, when Jeff Hardy was WWE Champion and Edge was Number One Contender. Hardy was repeatedly wronged by a mysterious assailant who ambushed him backstage at _Survivor Series_, ran his car off the highway...and nearly burned him alive by sabotaging his in-ring entrance pyrotechnics when Hardy was coming down to the ring to be interviewed on _The Cutting Edge_. Hardy himself and all the commentators were convinced that Edge was behind all the mischief, but Edge kept insisting he was innocent. And he was: the person who'd been stalking Jeff Hardy for two whole months, and who finally cost him his championship at the _Royal Rumble_, was Jeff's envious older brother Matt, who admitted that, for good measure, he'd also burned down Jeff's house nearly a year before and killed his dog. Of course, Edge wasn't too sorry about this anyway, since Matt's interference enabled him to win the title.
-   In _WWE Smackdown_:
    -   A storyline in 2010 involved Kane looking for the one who put The Undertaker in a coma. When he accused CM Punk of doing the deed, Punk replied that while he wanted to do it, it wasn't him this time. Kane proceeds to identify Rey Mysterio as the attacker. Subverted; it was _Kane himself_ who was responsible for it all.
    -   An early storyline in 2011 had Smackdown General Manager Teddy Long getting taken out. Since Wade Barrett had just formed The Corre on that episode, had done something similar to the previous Raw GM during his time as The Nexus leader, and Teddy had just tempted fate by telling them that he would not allow himself to be cowed by their beatdown antics like the current Raw GM was, they were naturally the first suspects. However, they denied having anything to do with it. It eventually turns out that they were telling the truth. It was Vickie Guerrero and Dolph Ziggler that did it.
-   Since arriving in NXT, Kevin Owens laid waste to numerous wrestlers and even tried to end the career of his former friend Sami Zayn. However, when Hideo Itami was found injured in the parking lot and Owens was nearby, he responded with this, and has continued to respond as such every time he's questioned about it. He even asked commissioner William Regal why he'd deny attacking Itami when he's bragged about every other atrocity he's committed.

    Puppet Shows 

-   In _The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss_ episode "The Snoozer", Yertle the Turtle announces his intent to build a huge statue of himself at the site of the Snoozer, an existing and popular statue. When the statue disappears, Jane Kangaroo assumes Yertle is responsible, and when Horton insists "We shouldn't jump to conclusions, We should walk slowly and carefully to conclusions" decides that anyone who defends him must be an accomplice. It turns out the statue wasn't stolen at all. It woke up. Even Yertle is surprised at the idea of being innocent of something, and says it feels weird.

    Theatre 

-   In _Orpheus in the Underworld_, given Jupiter's many, _many_ lovers and indiscretions, the whole of Olympus is shocked when for once it's Pluto who kidnapped a girl to make his bride.

    Theme Parks 

-   In the Midship Detective Agency attraction for Disney Cruise Line, one of the cases the guests have to solve is who kidnapped the Dalmatian Puppies from _101 Dalmatians_ on the ship. One of the suspects is Cruella De Vil, who despite her threats against the dogs in continuity, has an alibi, as she wasn't even on the ship at the time they were kidnapped. The culprit tends to be randomized, for the cases.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Urban Legends 

-   One legend involves a driver who picks up a scary-looking, scruffy hitchhiker. The driver immediately regrets this, and begins to fear that the hitchhiker might try to rob or murder him. Away down the road, he sees another hitchhiker. This one is very well dressed and good looking, so the driver picks him up, thinking that this will help potentially protect him from the scruffy hitchhiker. The well-dressed hitchhiker pulls out a gun and tries to rob the driver, but is outwitted and knocked out by the scruffy hitchhiker. The driver confesses to the scruffy hitchhiker that he originally suspected him of being a robber. The hitchhiker tells him that he is actually a robber, but, "Today's my day off."

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   In the fourth case of _Ace Attorney Investigations_, Edgeworth suspects that Manny Coachen was responsible for killing Byrne Faraday, as Byrne had prosecuted him for killing Cece Yew (and he was almost certainly guilty, but got off because the decisive evidence was missing), but Detective Badd says that while Coachen attended the day's trial, he was being watched by the police the entire time, giving him an alibi.
    -   The first case of _Investigations 2_ involves an assassination attempt on a foreign president. A witness is involved who is very clearly the assassin Shelly De Killer. He denies he had anything to do with it. He's telling the truth, though he had _planned_ to kill the president before things went out of hand. The president's assassination was actually staged, and De Killer was the only witness in the case who _wasn't_ in on it.
    -   Case 4 of _Investigations 2_ reveals that one of Manfred Von Karma's evidence forgeries was actually orchestrated by someone else behind his back. Specifically, the one in the case where he received his first penalty.
    -   In the first case of _Dual Destinies_, Ted Tonate, a police bomb technician, is exposed as the killer of a detective, as well as the one who blew up the courtroom in the opening. But in the game's final case, he admits that while he did kill the detective, he didn't blow up the courtroom, someone else stole a remote that detonated said bomb. He even warned everyone to evacuate when the bomb was about to go off.
    -   In the fan-made case _The Empty Turnabout_, Athena Cykes murdered Simon Blackquill six months ago, and only Apollo knows it. The game presents Apollo in such a way that it appears he only took this case because he suspects she also killed Ian Arts and wants to finally bring her to justice. But she didn't do it, as it turns out.
    -   In a meta sense, every tutorial case in the main series follows a very specific formula: the trial only lasts one day with no investigation segments. The single eyewitness is a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing who intends to frame the defendant to cover up their own crime. All except for _Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney_, where the single eyewitness _is_ lying about what they saw and they're still a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing, but a cross-examination reveals that they aren't the killer. They lied because they were unconscious during the murder. The actual killer was Apollo's mentor, Kristoph Gavin.
-   _Case 03: True Cannibal Boy_: Marty, who went crazy in _Extra Case: My Girlfriend's Secrets_, isn't the one who killed Sally, as that was the original Cannibal Boy. However, he is responsible for killing two women in a mad attempt to get Sally a new body. In the true ending, he kills Lily to accomplish this goal. At this same time, Lily and Brucie wrongfully assume the Cannibal Boy killed the woman near Silversmith's.
-   In _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, Genocide Jack is both a Serial Killer _and_ Toko Fukawa's Split Personality. However, Genocide Jack is accused of three different murders throughout the first game, from the second case to the fourth case. But throughout the entire story, she is responsible for none of the murders. She did **not** murder Chihiro Fujisaki and then creepily crucify their lifeless body, despite how the evidence _does_ point at her. It ultimately turns out that Byakuya Togami was the one who staged the body like that in order to frame her, but he isn't the killer either; he only did that to "keep things interesting" and test the perceptiveness of his classmates. Jack even points this out, saying her motivation is based on Pragmatic Villainy when it comes to murder in the killing game. Because Jack doesn't want to kill anyone without using her Calling Cards — which would make it very obvious that she's the killer — Jack decides that the easiest solution is to simply not kill anyone. It gets lampshaded by Ishimaru.
    
    **Ishimaru**: "I have no idea what's going on anymore...! Could such a heinous villain really be innocent!?"
    
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_: In _Maekashi-hen_ (and _Watanagashi-hen_ to an extend), Shion blames her grandmother Oryou and many others connected to the Sonozaki family to be responsible for Satoshi's disappearance. By the end of _Maekashi-hen_, Mion reveals (too late) that their grandmother kept her word of leaving Satoshi alone, since Shion took responsibility for that, but Shion doesn't believe her sister. Later in _Matsuribayashi-hen_, we learn what really happened to Satoshi. After killing his aunt and buying the big stuffed animal for his sister Satoko, he met Dr. Irie who noticed that Satoshi was about to enter the final stage of the Hinamizawa Syndrome and he immediately took him to the hospital where the boy would get his treatment in secret and hidden to the public, while the murder on the aunt is covered up by the Yamainu due to Dr. Irie's request.
-   _Zero Escape_ Trilogy:
    -   K's route in _Virtue's Last Reward_ has Dio, who claims that while he killed the old woman they discovered at the beginning of the game, he wasn't responsible for Luna and Alice's deaths. Turns out, he was telling the truth.
    -   Series-wide example. The Nonary Game in _Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors_ is orchestrated by a person called Zero. In _Virtue's Last Reward_ there is another Zero masterminding another Nonary Game, but the original Zero is working behind the scenes with the new one. In _Zero Time Dilemma_ there is yet another Zero with new Deadly Game... and for once the original Zero has nothing to do with it.

    Web Animation 

-   _DSBT InsaniT_:
    -   In "The Camping Webisode", Koden tells Alex and Seth not to beat up Andy for Frets, Martha asks "why", and Koden, knowing Alex is the one to say stuff like that, does a Double Take when he realizes it didn't come from him for once.
    -   In "Untamed and Uncut", Evil Balloon is the one to die in an instant rather than Balloon. Balloon is, of course, delighted about surviving the episode.
    -   In 'Carneelval', Bill is the one lamenting about craziness ruining a fun outing rather than Koden.
        
        **Bill**: I thought we could just have a fun time without another bad guy showing up! Now I know how Koden feels.
        
-   _Homestar Runner_: The short "Play Date" involves Homestar hanging out with Strong Mad, who repeatedly causes him harm because Strong Mad Does Not Know His Own Strength. When Homestar tries to relax, a meteor falls on his head. Strong Mad had nothing to do with it.
    
    **Strong Mad:** THIS ONE'S NOT MY FAULT!
    
-   In mashed's _OmniLeaks_ animated short, Winston, Mercy, Lucio, Tracer, Zarya, Genji, and Reaper capture Sombra, convinced that she leaked embarrassing secrets about them (the titular OmniLeaks). Sombra is thoroughly confused by the accusations but admits that she wished she had leaked the info after hearing the hilarious Leaks. It's hinted to have been Doomfist, but given that Winston's passwords are ALL "password", it could have been anyone.
-   In _Red vs. Blue_, when Caboose claims that the crash that stranded them on Chorus was not his fault, no one takes him seriously. But in this case, he really was innocent- it was _everyone else's_ fault. And the crash was actually caused by a tractor beam. The team's antics just ripped the ship in half instead.

    Web Original 

-   The SCP Foundation's SCP-682 is an Omnicidal Maniac. There is one point in the test log (mostly a list of spectacularly failed attempts to kill it) where somebody shoved Dr. Clef into its enclosure and locked the door. The document goes to great lengths to point out that the subsequent death by neck-snap of the person who pushed him in there was _definitely_ due to 682 somehow managing to break containment without visibly disappearing from its enclosure, and not in any way caused by Dr. Clef.
-   _SF Debris_: "Next week, we return to _Star Trek: Voyager_, where someone is experimenting on the crew... and it's not Captain Janeway this time."

    Web Videos 

-   In _Atop the Fourth Wall_, both Linkara and the audience assume it was Mechakara who broke the Continuity Alarm. However, when he's finally confronted, he admits he didn't do it. As it turns out, it was Linksano who broke it.
-   During _Cornerstone_, the group (mainly Rythian) assume that Smiffy and someone else are posing as creepers to try and scare the others after Smiffy has tried it before and died for his trouble. It turns out that no, those are actual creepers. Sjin also kills the wrong person for stealing his jetpack.
-   Despite being the Token Evil Teammate for Hat Films, there are occasions when Smiffy's Pyromaniac tendencies get him blamed for fires he didn't actually start. One example is in Minecraft 1.8.2 XBLA #5, when Ross accidentally places lava inside their (partially wooden) house, setting it on fire. Trott immediately shifts the blame to Smith, due to his habit of burning down their houses. He was similarly accused of stealing items, causing them to actually kill him... only to be stunned to not find them in his dropped inventory. Turns out they just missed them among all the junk in the chest.
-   The Hitler Rants videos on YouTube normally sees either Fegelein or Himmler (or often both) pulling antics on Hitler. Once the spin-off series based around Josef Stalin and the cast of _Das Boot_ got their own antic masters, Fegelein frequently had to explain to Hitler's staff that he wasn't involved in whatever embarrassment had just befallen Hitler, often with little success.
-   _Kittisaurus_: Claire discovers a silicone plate from her food steamer has been chewed up and there are bits missing, so part of it is in one of her cats' stomachs. Initially she suspects Big Eater Lulu as he tries to steal the plate from her due to it smelling of food. In the comments she reveals Dodo (who makes Lulu look _picky_ by comparison) was the culprit as he threw the pieces he ate back up.
-   _Noob_ had this happen twice:
    -   Gaea, a known Manipulative Bastard, has a video that is very compromising for her faction's top player end up on her blog. It took a solid alibi to convince her own Guild Master that she had gotten framed.
    -   _The actual poster of the video_ later got this, mostly due to them happen to be in the same faction as the female player that had just broken one of the male protagonist's hearts. On a side note, part of the audience was suspecting said female player to be working for him all along up to that point.
-   During Sips' _Garry's Mod Murder!_ series, Ross of Hat Films becomes The Dreaded as the murderer due to his shouting "EAT SHIT" at the top of his lungs. In at least one case, however, he's mistaken for the murderer as his efforts to shout "EAT SHIT" and put them off fail, resulting in him dying and everyone else assuming it's him.
-   The Channel Awesome team review of _The Last Airbender_ has a group of reviewers forced to watch the movie; the group initially thinks The Nostalgia Critic is behind it, since last year he did exactly that with _Dragonball Evolution_. When they contact him, he's horrified at the idea of anyone sitting through it. It was JewWario, he accidentally left the disc there after borrowing Y: Ruler of Time's _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ DVD.
-   _There Will Be Brawl_:
    -   Who's the butcher and/or Peach's kidnapper? Bowser? Ganondorf? Mario assumes Bowser, but Luigi is the main character and has no idea, so we have no idea.
    -   Played with in that it _was_ Ganondorf, using the butcher_s_, as well as Olimar and others. Ganondorf was then hijacked by the biggest evil in the series, _Kirby_.
