In Western culture, the color white is symbolically tied to goodness. Tropes like Black-and-White Morality and White Magic exemplify how "white" is used as a synonym for "good". So ingrained is this concept that good characters in fiction tend to dress in white, usually while opposing a black-clad foe.

In The Western, the good guy wears a white cowboy hat. Prince Charming rides in to save the Damsel in Distress on a white horse. And Good witches wear white to show they're not a Wicked Witch. Heroic and morally righteous characters everywhere tend to wear white.

This trope is nearly ubiquitous in the West, but it's become increasingly popular to subvert expectations by playing with the trope. It's also not common to the same extent in every culture, such as East Asia where white is associated with death and occasionally villainy. As such, **do not list aversions.**

## Trope relations:

Tropes that complement Good Wears White:

-   Evil Wears Black: This trope's Evil Counterpart. The white-clad hero usually has an evil foe who wears black (includes purple).
-   Gold and White Are Divine: Gold and white are the colors of angels and gods, who are usually divine forces of good.
-   Light Is Good: Light and holy powers as a force of good. Characters associated with light may or may not wear white. That said, it is possible for a characters to have light or holy powers and wear different colors, even black.
-   Virgin in a White Dress: Since Nature Adores a Virgin, a character's white dress can symbolize both her sexual purity and purity of heart.
-   White Is Pure: When white is worn by virtuous characters and those obsessed with cleanliness.
-   White Magician Girl: A caring, girly, support-oriented White Mage. Often wears white, though not a requirement.

Tropes that subvert Good Wears White:

-   Movie Superheroes Wear Black: Heroes in more "serious" adaptations wear darker clothes.
-   Villain in a White Suit: A villainous leader whose white suit symbolizes his ruthlessness and authority.
-   White and Red and Eerie All Over: White with red accents signifies that despite wearing white, something is terribly wrong with the character in question.
-   White Mask of Doom: A menacing character made more malevolent with a featureless white mask on their face.

Not to be confused with:

-   Dark Is Not Evil: Darkness or traditionally evil things that aren't evil. A hero with dark powers can still wear white and qualify for this trope.
-   Ethereal White Dress: This character's white dress marks her as mysterious and otherworldly, but she could be good, evil, or neither.
-   Light Is Not Good: Light as a force of evil doesn't mean a character wears white. These characters can wear white, but can also still wear evil.
-   The Rich Have White Stuff: Rich characters, whether they are a Corrupt Corporate Executive or The Good King, tend to wear and have a lot of white.
-   White Shirt of Death: White clothing foreshadows a character's violent death, regardless of their morality.

Overlaps with Good Colors, Evil Colors when paired with a black-clad villain. Compare Blue Is Heroic, Red Is Heroic, Pink Heroine, and Primary-Color Champion for other good color schemes.
