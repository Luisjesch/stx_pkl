The least clean thing in this image is the dirt they're standing on.  
_Song of the Angels_ by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1881)

This trope is about white being associated with cleanliness, virtue, and innocence. In color psychology, white represents cleanliness, freshness, innocence, and purity.

Due to white being the lightest color on the color spectrum, any blemishes, imperfections, and stains are easily spotted, and it also represents how something is fresh and new, free of deterioration and decay. This shows how a character can be disturbingly disconnected from the real world, implying they are obsessed with cleanliness and hygiene. Or it suggests they are obsessed with sterility, they want everything to be fee of bacteria.

White could also symbolize how a character is sophisticated and stylish, valuing sumptuous white clothing, and has luxurious tastes that they are ritualistic dedicated to keeping clean and organized. Implying a character has high expectations for keeping their possessions clean and pristine because they like to flaunt their wealth, look extravagant, and appear opulent. Personality-wise, they are very nervous and easily upset if they think their possessions are sullied by dirt and other substances.

In negative meanings of white, the color is also associated with blankness, coldness, emptiness, and stark environments. When a room is decorated in white, it shows how the owner is impersonal and obsessed with perfection, which creates feelings of anxiety and discontent in other characters because their home appears artificial and unrealistically flawless.

White can also be used metaphorically to represent a character's moral purity, as white can be used as symbolism for how they are unsullied by sin or moral wrongness, a blank slate. Characters who wear white are usually portrayed as innocent and morally commendable in comparison to the rest of the cast. So white becoming stained with red symbolizes tainted purity and ruined innocence, for better or worse depending on the story you want to tell. White is an absence of color, so it allows the creator use dirt, stains, and other blemishes as a storyboard of progress in a hero's journey.

In real life, morality is complex, culturally appropriate, and relative so a character in white doesn't have to be a squeaky clean hero, a bastion of virtue, or unrelatably flawless. It does allow the author to show how cultures differ from each other, as one character might be a hero in one culture but can be seen as a villain in another. Virtue Is Weakness can be fully in play when a character is in an unforgiving environment or when they are put in a position where they will have to skirt their morality in a gray line to survive unrelenting danger. White can be used to invoke self-righteousness or loss of innocence.

A character wearing white can be a Knight Templar who has extreme views of justice and is extremely self-righteous to the point where they hurt or kill people for minor discretions. In other cases, a character in white can be Token Wholesome who has a character arc where they have to learn self-preservation, they have to learn that compassion, empathy, and honesty can be easily exploited, or they have to learn that kindness can often be rewarded with treachery.

In European culture, white carries positive associations because it's the best environment to grow white flowers. In Greece, white is the color of mourning as the Ancient Greeks hoped their dead would follow the light so they can find peace in the afterlife. In Finland, white is only worn by brides on their wedding day. In Asian cultures, white is associated with purity during weddings but is mainly associated with death because white is used mainly during funerals and became associated with ghosts and evil spirits.

In Peru, people have to wear white on the holy week to represent repentance and forgiveness to honor Jesus Christ when he was crucified and eventually resurrected. In Colombia, white flowers are a sign of respect. In Arabic countries, white is worn by babies and young children to protect them from evil, and white amulets are worn as protection from evil spirits. In African cultures, white also protected them from evil spirits and is seen as a symbol of wealth and prosperity. In most religions, white is a holy color known to represent purity, peace, tranquillity, and overall prosperity in the afterlife.

When it comes to animals, this trope can overlap with White Wolves Are Special and White Stallion as both involve the color white being used to signify importance.

Can overlap with Good Wears White, Gold and White Are Divine, Light Is Good. Virgin in a White Dress is a subtrope. Inverted with Light Is Not Good, and Villain in a White Suit. It can be paired with Characteristic Clothing Colors, Clothing Reflects Personality, Meaningful Appearance, The Rich Have White Stuff, and Symbolism when the color is used to show the character's ritualistic obsession with cleanliness. Compare Heavenly Blue.

It can be related to Ascetic Aesthetic, where white is used to invoke an ominous feeling through its stark simplicity, Blood-Splattered Wedding Dress and White and Red and Eerie All Over, where white and red are combined to create a creepy color scheme since white is used to represent purity and sterility. See also Pure Is Not Good, when purity can also mean sterility.

    Advertising 

-   Mr. Clean is the brand name and mascot of the Procter & Gamble company. He's a bald man who wears white to show the effectiveness of a cleaning product.
-   Cruelly subverted in one "got milk?" televised ad. A jerkass on his cell phone fires an underling, cackles about it, then steps into traffic, where he's presumably killed (a Gory Discretion Shot). He suddenly finds himself in Fluffy Cloud Heaven, which is almost all whiteness. There, an apparent white toga angel bids him, "Welcome to Eternity." The only things in sight that aren't white are a goldfish in a glass fishbowl, and some cookies on a white china plate. When the jerkass goes to a white refrigerator for milk, however, he discovers that every carton is empty. "Where am I?" he asks with growing alarm. Cut to the "got milk?" logo on fire. Fluffy Cloud Heaven? Nope, the other one.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: In her first appearance, Mimimi is dressed entirely in white, and the first thing she does when she meets Rentarou is buy him a white outfit. It's later shown that she values inner beauty just as much as she values outer beauty.
-   In _DEVILMAN crybaby_, a modern remake of the manga _Devilman_, Ryo Asuka is a blue-eyed youth with light blond hair, and associated with the colour white, since he is seen in white clothes during the course of the anime. This is deliberate: his _true_ incarnation is Satan, an angelic androgynous being with white feathery wings, evoking the pop culture image of angels, in contrast to the titular Devilman, a demonic antihero.
-   In _Digimon Frontier_, the main antagonist is a Digimon named Lucemon: an angelic-looking, blue-eyed blonde boy who wears a white toga. Again, he evokes the imagery of purity associated with angels in popular culture (white robes, golden hair).
-   _KonoSuba_: Invoked by Claire, the personal retainer to Crown Princess Iris. She always wears a spotless white suit (one generally worn by males) to demonstrate the purity of her loyalty to Iris. Most people who get to know her are aware that her loyalty might be a bit _too_ strong. That said, she's a genuinely skilled and powerful warrior, with the fact that she can keep her suit spotless even in combat being a source of intimidation.
-   In _Psycho-Pass_, a person's digital hue reflects their stress levels and darkens when stress and heightened "negative" emotions are consistently present. Violent urges, nervous reactions, and emotional outbursts in an individual can cloud a hue, and people will often make fun of those with darker hues simply by referring to them as their color. Lighter hues reflect higher social standings, and the people with these are often considered to be enviable, upstanding citizens who are much more likely to succeed.
    -   Inverted with Shogo Makishima, the overarching villain of the show with white hair and light gold eyes and a wardrobe consisting of lighter colors. Though his hue is "pure white," it is revealed that he is criminally asymptomatic and thus his hue will not change even when he is engaging in violent crime.

    Arts 

-   _David_: The titular king is represented as the embodiment of Christian virtue — unwavering in his faith in God and exhibiting fortitude (one of the seven cardinal virtues) and moral purity. He is sculpted on white marble.
-   _The Problem We All Live With_: Ruby Bridges is the only character in the painting who is drawn wearing white and it remains unstained and unblemished as the racist mob throws tomatoes at her.
    -   Since Norman Rockwell was an advocate of civil rights, the use of white is to symbolise how Ruby is just an innocent child going to school like everyone else. It also shows that what's supposed to be a good sign of societal progression is being tainted by the fact that the angry, white crowd are throwing tomatoes at her and she's having to be escorted by 4 US marshals.
    -   The use of white also serves as a contrast to the stained and vandalised brown wall behind her, which is stained by a tomato and vandalised by racist graffiti. It is a visual metaphor for how the so-called purity of white America is only being ruined by their own bigotry and hysteria over an innocent child who's just going to school like any other kid in America.

    Comic Books 

-   _Invincible_: A Pure Is Not Good case, as the Viltrumites are a powerful galactic empire obsessed with their belief in Social Darwinism, Might Makes Right, and their own purity. They tend to dress in either all-white or nearly all-white.

Only to realize too late how dangerous Jean Jacket really is as he, and everyone else at the Star Lasso Experience, is abducted and consumed by the creature. The red and white suit is a metaphor for how he failed to learn from his experience on _Gordy's Home_ and how he has gotten more blood on his hands because he couldn't properly process his trauma.
-   _Ready or Not (2019)_: Invoked by Grace Le Domas's white wedding dress as it is used to represent Grace's determination to survive the night. The condition of the dress becomes more damaged and stained as the film continues as Grace is forced to defend herself and escape from her in-laws.
-   _Star Wars_: The Grand Admiral's uniform in The Empire is colored in stainless white and it reflects their work ethic, specifically how they lack it.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Throughout The Bible, white as the colour of purity and redemption is a recurring motif.
    -   The redeemed and the elect get to wear radiantly spotless white robes in Heaven, for instance, and a metaphor for sin and the fallen condition of Mankind is that of an otherwise pure white garment sullied by the slightest drop of red.
    -   As a motif, The Holy Spirit is associated with white doves because the color is associated with purity and because of the Holy Spirit's description in The Bible as descending like a dove.

    Visual Novel 

-   _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_: Played with. Kokichi dresses in a primarily white uniform and looks very much like a child, giving him an innocent appearance and representing the 'truth' half of his Duality Motif. However, this is offset by the fact that the outfit also resembles a straightjacket and Kokichi is a self-admitted liar who is _far_ from innocent, even if he was Good All Along or a Well-Intentioned Extremist at worst.

    Web Videos 

-   _Pop Cross Studios_: In Christian Pearson's Multiverse Tales, Clayton, the leader of the Predator Coalition of Demon Hunters, has Mystical White Hair, and, as this video reveals, he used to be Terrified of Germs, just like his father, who obsessively cleaned every surface in their house constantly and rarely ever left home, to avoid interactions with germs. Clayton himself was afraid enough that he wouldn't even set foot in a park, for fear of getting his shoes muddy and having to clean them off. And because father and son's fear of germs was so powerful, it caught the attention of the demon Mysomucus, a seven foot germ who broke into their house, planning to eat them both. Clayton was able to overcome his fear once he realized that the mucus and grime Mysomucus was covering them with felt disgusting, but wasn't actually hurting him, but his father was paralyzed by fear and could not do the same, so the demon ate him alive, but spared his son. Afterwards, Clayton began to entirely overcome his fear through tons of dirt-connected exposure therapy, including doing mud runs, but in this video (which Christian released _before_ revealing Clayton's backstory), he still shows traces of his former obsession with cleanliness by snapping at his former girlfriend, Cosmara Noroi, for touching him with her sticky, black, shifting demonic arm. (Yes, Clayton's a hero, but he's also a jerk)

Unfortunately, this innocence and purity of focus also become her Fatal Flaws, pushing her into Ambiguous Innocence territory once her Secretly Selfish and insensitive traits become apparent.
    -   White Diamond's powers _literally_ bleach rebellious gems prior to making them empty dolls for her to control. Given that White is a Control Freak who views herself as literally perfect, she naturally sees this fate as being a great honor rather than the Fate Worse than Death is clearly is to the viewer.
-   _Teen Titans_: When Raven meditates and purges Trigon's influence, her robes and cloak become pure white.
-   _Transformers_: When he was first mentioned in _The Transformers (Marvel)_, Prima the First Prime was depicted as being a fairly ordinary-looking Transformer. However, as the franchise developed, more recent depictions of him (e.g. the comics by _IDW Publishing_, the backstories of _Transformers: War for Cybertron_, _Transformers: Prime_ and _Transformers: Cyberverse_) show him as being a shining warrior with a pure white body due to his title of "Warrior of Light". In universes where he's a genuinely divine being, he's described as being the closest in temperament and personality to the Transformer creator-god Primus, and deliberately tries to invoke Light Is Good to inspire others... even though he is also a firm believer that Good Is Not Soft.

    Real Life 

-   Medical professionals and scientists wear their iconic white longcoats (although they also come in sky blue and light green) to spot stains. Through their jobs, they can become unknowingly contaminated by chemicals, biological samples, etc, so if they or someone else notices a stain on their garments, they can immediately take it off and get a clean one (and get in a decontamination shower if necessary).
-   In the 19th century, Marie-Antoine Carême deliberately chose white as part of a chef's uniform to show stains and messes on the uniform, thereby showing the abilities of the chef and assuring the customers that their food is free of contamination.
-   In a biological sense, a sign of good dental care is having white teeth. In other cases, white eyes are a sign of good health.

Some also consider it to be a "palate cleanser".
