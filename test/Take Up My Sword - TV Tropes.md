_"Take up our quarrel with the foe:  
To you from failing hands we throw  
The torch; be yours to hold it high.  
If ye break faith with us who die  
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow  
In Flanders fields."_

— **John McCrae**, "In Flanders Field"

The Hero has been progressing in his quest against the Big Bad. Then he dies. Wait! What?! That's not supposed to happen!

Well, now what? Do we have a Downer Ending? No, no, we need a replacement Hero. Time to present The Lancer Ascendant: someone who will take up The Hero's sword (and other weapons) and go on to defeat the villain. This can be literal, invoking It Was a Gift, or metaphorical. When it's not only literal but the MacGuffin, see the subtrope I'm Dying, Please Take My MacGuffin.

Most often used at the beginning of a show, to explain exactly how some callow youth loser got the job of defeating the Big Bad. In this case, it was a head fake that had you thinking The Mentor was actually The Hero. (Which makes the first guy a Decoy Protagonist.) Occasionally done with the original Hero as a ghost or shade, unable to rest until someone completes his aborted quest.

When it happens later in the season (or in later seasons) it can be a real shocker. May feature in Dying to Be Replaced.

Occasionally used at the ending, to slightly sweeten the tragedy by showing that someone will continue the fight.

When it happens to superheroes or supervillains, it is often the case of Legacy Characters.

In military situations, often combines with a Field Promotion by the dying hero.

This is likely to create a Mirror Character.

Subtrope of Changing of the Guard. (Specifically, if the position is vacant by death.) Good Counterpart to the Dragon Ascendant. Related to Her Heart Will Go On, Taking Up the Mantle, and Bequeathed Power. In its darker forms, leads to Feuding Families, or may be a genesis to, or simply another stage in, the Cycle of Revenge. See also, The Chooser of the One. Passing the Torch is when The Hero decides their succession... and is still alive for a while afterwards.

When listing examples, remember that it has to be more than the literal "someone gives someone else a weapon" part to qualify.

## As this is a Death Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    "Take it. You're team captain now."

-   In _Highlander_, Ramirez finds and trains Connor MacLeod so that somebody would have a chance of defeating the Kurgan. When the Kurgan takes the aged immortal's head, Connor takes Ramirez's sword and uses it as his own from that point on, later using it to behead the Kurgan and fulfill his mentor's wish.
-   _Iron Man 2_: In a movie that starts off with a speech about the importance of legacy, this is going to come up a lot.
    -   Howard Stark reveals that he discovered a new element that would perfect the arc reactor and revolutionize energy. However, he lacks the technology to create it and leaves it up to Tony to solve the problem.
    -   Rhodey is set up by the dying Tony to take over as an armored hero. As Fury points out, the only way Rhodey could have activated the Mk. II was if Tony had already given him clearance to do so.

-   _The Princess Bride_. After Domingo Montoya's death, his son takes up the masterpiece of a sword that his father made for the Six-Fingered Man. The son later spent the rest of his life training to avenge his father's death. The rest, as they say, is Florinese history...
-   _Purgatory_: Wild Bill gives his badge to Sonny when Sonny declines to take the easy way to Heaven.
-   _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ also deals with the importance of inheritance and legacy as Tony Stark died in _Avengers: Endgame_ but not before leaving E.D.I.T.H. and thus control of Stark Industries' information gathering and weapons technology to be handed over to Peter Parker. Peter is also throughout the movie, pushed towards and ultimately assumes the mantle that Iron Man once held as the hero of the MCU.
-   _Star Trek (2009)_:
    -   Nero kills Lt. George Samuel Kirk as he tries to stop him, and 25 years later his son finishes the job.
    -   Spock (and later Kirk) taking over from Pike.

-   _The Bible_: The Book of Joshua opens with God telling Joshua that his mentor, Moses, has died, and he must take over as leader of the Israelites.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Pendragon_: Since the game is set on a quick timescale, any player character is expected to die in the course of a campaign. When that happens, it is assumed that his lands and titles will pass to his heir, who will become the player's new character.
-   _World of Darkness_: This is the big reason why the Vampires don't go out of their way to kill Hunters. Kill one, and you'd just get one or more to take their place.

    Theatre 

-   _West Side Story_ has an example that's tragic rather than heroic: after Bernardo kills Riff, Tony picks up Riff's switchblade knife and immediately uses it to kill Bernardo. In the 1961 film version, the dying Riff actually hands the knife to Tony just before he collapses, silently requesting this trope.
-   In _Wicked_, Elphaba hands the Grimmerie off to Glinda before "melting."

    Visual Novels

-   In the Demon Tsukuyomi case of _Spirit Hunter: NG_, a time-displaced Killer Peach passes her katana onto Akira, signaling her approval at him continuing the investigation into Sumii Group that she could not.
-   In the fifth arc of _Umineko: When They Cry_, Beatrice is killed by Erika Furudo. As a result, Battler becomes the Endless Sorcerer. It's an unusual example, considering that he's taking up the role of the woman who has acted as an antagonist until now.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_:
    -   In the Volume Three finale, "End of the Beginning", Professor Ozpin is missing/presumed dead. Qrow Branwen takes over as the Big Good and carries Ozpin's cane. At the end of Volume 4, he later gives it to Oscar, whom Ozpin has selected as his successor. Volume 5 later reveals that Oscar is actually Ozpin's latest reincarnation, so it's more of a case of "Take Up My Own Sword".
    -   At the beginning of Volume Four, Jaune's gear is upgraded with metal left from Pyrrha's armor.
    -   Neo takes up Roman's hat after he dies while fighting Ruby, and seeks to kill Ruby to avenge him.

    Webcomics 

-   _Spinnerette_: Tiger inherits his powers this way. He found the former Tiger dying from a gunshot wound and received the Spirit of the Tiger from him as the man's final act. He was already a cop on the beat, so he didn't inherit the purpose but rather traded "policeman" for "superhero".

    -   They tried to do this with Matrix's backup clone, little Enzo. Fortunately for everyone, Little Enzo refused.
-   _Samurai Jack_: In Season 5, Aku kills the Scotsman and breaks his sword in half. In the final episode, the Scotsman's daughter Flora wields the half with the hilt in battle.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   In _Transformers: The Movie_, Optimus Prime gives the Matrix of Leadership to Ultra Magnus but Hot Rod ends up with it by the end.
    -   Defied in _Transformers: Prime_, since Smokescreen made the wisest decision of his young life and used the Forge to revive Optimus, thus eliminating the need for Smokescreen receiving the Matrix of Leadership.

    Real Life 

-   One of the strangest examples of this trope involves the Console Wars. When Sony released its PlayStation 2 console, it absolutely creamed the Sega Dreamcast, and Sega knew that combined with the heavily-bungled release of its Saturn console years earlier it meant the writing was all but on the wall for the company's console division. Sega handed the reins to its slot in the competition over to Microsoft, even going as far as to assist in development of the original Xbox hardware and release some exclusive titles for the platform. The rest, as they say, is history.
