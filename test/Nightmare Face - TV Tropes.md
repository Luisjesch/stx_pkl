"Can I be scary? Well, whaddya think of _this_?"

_\[W\]hen she turned, it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her, his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile. "You are shaking, girl," he said, his voice rasping. "Do I frighten you so much?"  
He did, and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face..._

The human face is supremely important on a social and biological level. Most of our non-verbal communication comes from reading subtle facial movements, and its importance in our cognitive thinking is best shown in our tendency to see faces in inanimate objects (think of how many times you've looked at a rock face and thought you'd seen two eyes and a mouth). So there is something genuinely disturbing to most people about seeing a face visibly distorted, mutated, or rearranged ... so, naturally, this type of Body Horror is one of the most common Horror Tropes.

A Sister Trope and effective primary component of Nightmare Fuel.

It is in fact at least Older Than Feudalism — armies over the world have based their war masks around this trope, and in mythology and folklore, just about any self-respecting demon or supernatural evil will have one.

More recently, it has also become a staple of Surreal Horror.

This is a main symptom of Coming Back Wrong. Most humanoid examples of Our Monsters Are Weird will fit this trope.

This trope is commonly doubled with the Jump Scare in a Screamer Prank.

Sub-Tropes include:

-   Black Eyes of Crazy: A character is shown to be evil by having black sclera.
-   Black Eyes of Evil: Evil characters' eyes are completely black.
-   The Blank: No facial features at all.
-   Cheshire Cat Grin: An unusually wide, mischievous smile.
-   Cute Creature, Creepy Mouth: A cute creature has a horrifying mouth.
-   Eyeless Face: A face is devoid of eyes and eye sockets.
-   Facial Horror: The face is disturbing because of scarring.
-   Game Face: A character's face becomes frightening when they reveal their true self.
-   Ghostly Gape: The eyes and mouth are empty black pits.
-   Glasgow Grin: A large grin created by slicing the cheeks.
-   Glowing Eyelights of Undeath: Undead beings have glowing eyes.
-   More Teeth than the Osmond Family: A character's mouth is full of numerous sharp teeth.
-   Red Eyes, Take Warning: Red eyes indicate a character is evil or dangerous.
-   Scary Teeth: Character has a mouthful of sharp, predatory fangs or heavily rotten, disgusting teeth.
-   Slasher Smile: Character has an evil, bloodthirsty, frightening grin.
-   Two-Faced: One side of the character's face is disfigured, distorted, discolored, or otherwise different from the other side of the face.
-   Wide Eyes and Shrunken Irises: Beady irises generally indicate that a person is unhinged.

See also:

-   This trope's well-meaning (but still scary) sister, The Grotesque.
-   Game Face, which comes into play when a supernatural villain disguised as a human flashes his true form's Nightmare Face to scare someone.
-   Demon Head, cousin to this trope.
-   Demonic Head Shake, when the head shakes uncontrollably
-   Take Our Word for It, when the face is too grotesque to even show.

Interesting tidbit: this is one theory as to why some people are afraid of clowns. Exaggerated mouths, bulbous noses, and pin-prick eyes are downright terrifying to young children who haven't yet figured out that the person is just wearing make-up and not _deformed_.

    Advertising 

-   Some of the scarier vanity plates sometimes used these. Some notable ones include the VID Mask, the Klasky-Csupo Robot and the Nickelodeon Pinchface.
-   This horrific 60s print ad from Mobil<small>◊</small>, created to advocate against driving with tension. And it does so by showing a _horrifically_ distorted face. Interestingly, this image is actually of a dancer named Killer Joe Piro, and the original photograph was taken mid-dance, giving it its creepy look.
-   90s Rice Krispie Treats commercials showed kids who, upon having none of the treat left to satisfy their craving, would morph into a disturbing..._monster_ of some kind while bellowing "_**IIIII WAAAAANNNTTT OOOONNNNEEEE!!!**_" Brrrr.
-   This Scotland Against Drugs PIF. Let's just say the title of the upload ("I've Just Shit Me Pants") is VERY apt.
-   Infamously, this Eggo commercial from 2001. A boy tries to steal some of his sister's waffles, only to immediately regret it.
-   This anti-smoking PSA from the 70s has an animated variation of the "Three Little Pigs" story, and the Wolf gives off such a face right at the camera before leaving his place to get to the pigs' straw house.
-   Wario in the infamous commercial for _Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins_. "Obey Wario, DESTROY MARIO!!!"

    Comic Books 

-   The eponymous _Jonah Hex_. (That second link includes an informative essay on what the result of Hex being unable to close his right eye would lead to.)
-   _Batman_:
    -   Two-Face, obviously. Well, half of him. Varies from artist to artist, with Tim Sale's rendering<small>◊</small> being particularly gruesome.
    -   The Joker, naturally. Frozen Face with a Slasher Smile? Check. Permanent Uncanny Valley Makeup? Double Check. Looks like a Monster Clown from your worst nightmares? Quintuple _check_. Taken up _several_ notches in _Death of the Family_. Prior to the story arc, Joker was last seen having his face _surgically removed_ and left for the police to symbolize his "rebirth". When he returns, still without a face, he steals his original, preserved face from the GCPD lockup and proceeds to wear it like a mask<small>◊</small>, using several hooks and leather straps to stretch it across his head in a grotesque parody of his original face. As the series goes on, the face starts to visibly decay and attract flies and at one point Joker even wears it _upside-down_ to psychologically torment Red Robin.
    -   The Great White Shark lost most of his face (including ears, nose and hair) after being locked in a freezer and has since filed his teeth into points. As a result, he's nothing to scoff at, either.<small>◊</small>
-   _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_:
    -   Vos. Oh sweet holy crap, Vos. Vos is a Decepticon Justice Division member, and he combines Cold-Blooded Torture with this trope. Transformer faces have been pretty ugly before, but somehow this<small>◊</small> takes The Blank, inverts the concept of the Face Stealer (a Face _Giver_, perhaps?), and comes out the other side unsettling and terrifying.
        
        **Vos:** wear. my. faaaace.
        
    -   Vos now has competition in the form of the _incredibly_ creepy Sunder<small>◊</small> from the same series. It probably comes as little surprise that he's a Serial Killer.
-   Implied for Doctor Doom of _Fantastic Four_; first he gets his face scarred up by being caught next to an exploding machine (though precisely how badly scarred varies), and then he, in some tellings at least, puts his trademark metal facemask on. While it's still _red hot_.
-   _Judge Dredd_:
    -   Judge Fear, one of the Dark Judges, is able to kill by simply revealing his face, though the reader never sees it. Averted once by Dredd himself.<small>◊</small>
    -   Dredd himself for that matter. The first time we "see" his face with his helmet off, there is a big black bar over it reading Censored For Graphic Content and the gang holding him at gunpoint are so horrified at what they see that they decide Dredd needs to die immediately. And while never taken to that extreme again, under Carlos Ezquerra's pen, both Dredd and his clone father Judge Fargo tend to look like lumpy lipless potatoes as they get older.
    -   This forms a significant portion of the character named Otto Sump. Put simply, he is the ugliest man who has ever lived. Just _how_ ugly is Depending on the Artist, but the only person in all of Mega-City One who _doesn't_ find it hard to look at him for more than five seconds is Dredd himself.
-   _Paperinik New Adventures_: Raghor's face is usually under a helm,but when he takes it off...not only he seems to be completely scarred,but he also has Medusa-like tentacles.
-   Rhona Burchill from _Ultimate Fantastic Four_ has one courtesy of self-inflicted brain surgery to boost her own intellect, which left her with a large bald spot that exposes a very ugly, ragged scar and unnaturally bulging skull.
-   Crazy Jane from _Doom Patrol_ has several, including Black Annis and a personality whose _head is a sun that shoots smaller suns_.
-   _Wonder Woman_: Some members of the Greek pantheon like to manifest with horrific things for faces, most notably the fear god twins Phobos and Deimos, who each like to appear with a desiccated dog skull for a head, or in Phobos's case to manifest with shadow and twisting cobras for a face. Their father Ares also tends to go the shadow route, manifesting with formless darkness and two glowing red eyes beneath his helmet is his go to look.
-   Irish Mob member Finn Cooley, a memorable one-off villain in _The Punisher MAX_. A bomb went off in his face before he could get away, and now everything above the lower lip is just skull wrapped in sticky exposed musculature. At all times he either needs a transparent face mask or a mess of bandages to hold it in place. In spite of all that, he was one of the less nightmarish mobsters in that storyline.
-   In _Faith: Dreamside_, Belu's minions all have large yellow eyes and wide, sharp-toothed grins.
-   The chapter of _Tales from the Dark Multiverse_ dealing with _Knightfall_ features a version of Bruce Wayne sporting yellow eyes and a Slasher Smile as a result of the torture he was subjected to as he gets revenge on Azrael.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_ is no stranger to the stuff of nightmares, but most _Sonic_ media avoids this particular sub-trope. _Sonic the Hedgehog (IDW)_, however, features several notable examples.
    -   Mimic the Octopus, a new villain introduced in the _Tangle & Whisper_ miniseries, is a shapeshifter with Black Eyes of Evil and wrinkled lips (as part of a Skeleton Motif). He can show these features while disguised as someone else, with terrifying results.
    -   During the second major arc, Dr. Eggman causes a Zombie Apocalypse (on purpose) with his Metal Virus bioweapon, which turns its victims—including some of Sonic's allies—into evil robo-zombies. The faces of these "Zombots" are intimidating by default, but they turn outright _demonic_ when silhouetted, as Sonic's Zombot-ified friends demonstrate.
    -   Hell, even Robotnik gets a few of these in some panels being casted in shadow, and only being able to see his eerie grin and glasses which, while totally matching his Eggman Empire logo, is quite creepy-looking on the guy himself.
-   In _Pumpkin (Jason Conley)_, the titular vigilante develops a hideous face like a jack-o-lantern whenever she transforms.

    Comic Strips 

-   Villains in the original _Dick Tracy_ newspaper comic were notoriously Nightmare Faced. This waned at about the time Chester Gould suffered a Creator Breakdown, but has returned with the new artist, Dick Locher, who absolutely _loves_ this trope.
-   Al Capp's _Li'l Abner_ had a character named "Lena the Hyena" whose face was never shown, but by reputation and the reactions of other characters was this. Capp eventually ran a contest for readers to send in their own depictions of Lena. The winning entry, by Basil Wolverton, can be seen here<small>◊</small>.

    Fan Works 

-   _Glitchtale's_ Season 2 Arc Villain, Bête Noire, _excels_ at this (fittingly for an someone whose power is rooted in Fear). If you don't mind spoilers, see here<small>◊</small> for an example. Looking like a cute little girl most of the time, in reality her body is a shell made from a dead little girl's corpse. Her true form has sharp teeth, a wide Slasher Smile, and the skin can be torn off to reveal inhuman pink flesh that looks disturbingly like someone who's been Flayed Alive.
-   _TS!Underswap_:
    -   Temmie follows in Flowey's footsteps by busting out a few of these, complete with evil cackling.
    -   Asgore makes a scary face during his final attack on a genocide run, as a reference to one of Toby Fox's original concepts.
-   _Underverse_:
    -   Especially with their already eerie black-and-white designs, X-Chara and later on X-Gaster are very good at pulling this, with wide jagged-mouth Slasher Smiles and creepy Black Eyes of Evil that have sinister red and purple irises.
    -   Ink Sans of all people does one as well in _Xtra Scene 2_, though it's implied to have been a dream (or possibly Foreshadowing that he isn't all that trustworthy). It's currently the page image for the Nightmare Fuel page for the series.
    -   Unsurprisingly, Flowey does this in _OWNERS_.
-   Played for Laughs with Ayla in _Vow of Nudity_. She's a changeling wizard with face-blindness, so her human form includes a horrifyingly uncanny amalgamation of blurry and misshapen facial features, but her neighbors and fellow cityfolk all pretend she's nailing it out of respect for her feelings.

    Literature 

-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Voldemort is described as having a face like a skull, with glowing red eyes and slits for nostrils. It's hinted that his involvement with the Dark Arts warped him; in later books it's explained that he got this way by splitting his soul to achieve immortality through his Horcruxes — he actually used to be handsome as a young man. Ralph Fiennes does a pretty good job of conveying this description in the movies.
    -   The Made of Evil Dementors were even worse, although it's mitigated somewhat by the fact that they wore hooded cloaks and wraps covering up most of their decaying skin. The one part that _isn't_ covered besides their "slimy-looking" hands is the giant black hole where their mouths should be, and it's said that their eye sockets are completely empty and covered with scabbed-over flesh.
-   Quasimodo in Victor Hugo's novel _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ is described as being so ugly, people mistake him for the Devil.
-   In _Invisible Monsters_ by Chuck Palahniuk, the main character's lower jaw is shot off. This fanmade image<small>◊</small> **(WARNING: gory/NSFW)** gives a pretty good idea of why this is a bit of an upsetting thing.
-   _The Kane Chronicles_:
    -   Menshikov, whose face was burned when he tried and failed to awaken Ra.
    -   A heroic example can be found in Bes, whose trademark attack is to scare the shit out of his opponent by distorting his face hideously and screaming "BOO!" Not that he's that handsome when he's not making that face.
    -   From the first book (and second to an extent) there is a demon named Face-Of-Horror who is Exactly What It Says on the Tin and worse. Compared to how other demons can be called Death-to-Corks and have corkscrews or other objects (or limbs) replacing their heads, Face-Of-Horror is a legitimately terrifying demon. If any of you are wondering what Face of Horror looks like: scaly, clawed talons instead of feet, and his face seems to have all the skin torn off, leaving only muscle. Anyone else reminded of a certain monster from _Attack on Titan_?
-   _The Phantom of the Opera_.
-   _Redwall_:
    -   Slagar the Cruel has a badly mutilated Two-Faced look thanks to a snakebite in his youth.
    -   Riggu Felis from _High Rhulain_ is probably even worse. After having his face raked by an osprey's talons, he is described as looking like this: "The black-and-grey-striped fur was normal from ears to eyes, but below that it was red, glistening flesh and bone. The whole muzzle, nose, and upper lip had been torn off. Half of the warlord's face was a frightful mask - a spitting, bubbling skeleton, as he continualy sucked air to breathe."
-   "The Dream" from _Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark_. Let's just say the pale woman from the original edition will make you wish you slept with a _Warhammer 40,000_ weapon next to your bed. The illustration from _The Thing_ is spookier still, and as for the illustration from _The Haunted House_... we would post a link, but we're too scared to search. If you're feeling brave, _The Haunted House_ provides the page image for Ghastly Ghost.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Sandor "The Hound" Clegane, who had the left half of his face burned off by his older brother when he was a kid.
    -   Lady "Ser" Brienne of Tarth _was_ known for being extremely plain. But after the encounter with Biter she has now a very similar disfigurement to the Hound's, except caused by festering teeth of an evil idiot rather than by fire.
    -   Lady Stoneheart formerly known as Catelyn Stark, who, before having her throat cut, tore up her own face out of grief and insanity, and was then thrown in the river, where she spent considerable time before being resurrected. The result is not pleasant.
-   In John French’s _Thousand Sons_ novels, the sorcerer Ichneumon is so heavily mutated by the powers of Chaos that his face no longer resembles anything even remotely human. One half of his face is covered with clusters of eyes, and the other half is dotted with lamprey-like mouths. Ctesias, a fellow sorcerer, is so put-off by the sight of it—and by Ichneumon’s obvious pride at having been “blessed” with such a hideous face by the Chaos Gods—that he can’t think of anything to say for a long moment.
-   Brightheart from _Warrior Cats_ has half of her face _torn off_ by a pack of dogs, leaving her permanently scarred and missing an eye. This picture from _Cats of the Clans_ sums it up nicely.
-   In _Wax and Wayne_, Bleeder displays one of these between forms, a skinless face "of stretched muscle and grinning teeth". When she realizes she's been seen she makes another one by trying to copy the cabbie's face over the wrong bones, leaving her face a twisted nightmare.

    Music 

-   Aphex Twin's "Rubber Johnny". In fact, Aphex Twin has played this trope for Surreal Humor and Surreal Horror (sometimes both at the same time) in most of his music videos.
-   Quite often used on the album covers of noise musician Aaron Dilloway (of Wolf Eyes fame).
-   The last scene in Lady Gaga's video "Alejandro" in which the film burns up from the eyes and mouth out.
-   In the music video for Madonna's "Bedtime Story", there's a part near the end where Madonna's mouth has been replaced by an eye and her eyes by two mouths.<small>◊</small> Do NOT click on that image! You have been warned.
-   In the music video for "Mama," by Genesis, when Phil Collins laughs. Also done in live performances of the song as well.
    -   "In the Air Tonight" does this as well. When the drum solo kicks in, Collins' black-and-white visage suddenly transforms into a blazing, brightly-colored, and VERY angry thermographic image.
-   Soundgarden's video for Black Hole Sun. It has this suburban neighborhood of creepy smiling people whose faces very suddenly become horrifyingly distorted.
-   Barry Godber's cover artwork from King Crimson's _In the Court of the Crimson King_.
-   The album cover of _The Miracle_ by Queen shows a composite of the band members' faces.
    -   The Gentle Giant on Queen's album cover of _News of the World (Queen)_.
-   The shaving weaselman on the cover of Frank Zappa's _Weasels Ripped My Flesh_.
    -   Zappa's face on the TV on the cover of _Over-Nite Sensation_.
-   Captain Beefheart's face on the album cover of _Trout Mask Replica_ is covered by a carp's head <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , showing a face you wouldn't want to see near your window at night.
-   The little girl on the cover of _Beautiful Freak_ by Eels has large creepy eyes.
-   Tom Waits' close-up face on the cover of _Bone Machine_.
-   Every friggin' album cover Marilyn Manson appears on (_Smells Like Children_, _Mechanical Animals_, _Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)_) is haunting to watch.
-   2-D from Gorillaz has no eyes, just two gaping holes. It's quite frightening in close-up, such as in the music video of "Feel Good, Inc." from _Demon Days (Album)_.
    -   Ironically, he's considered very handsome In-Universe.
-   The official music video (not the earlier fan-made one) for "Kids" from _Oracular Spectacular_ by MGMT, featuring deformed rubber masks with grotesque protruding eyes and tongues. Then you notice that _a small child is crying_ and reacting to these horror faces.
-   Björk in the music video of "Alarm Call" for _Homogenic_, where she changes into a monster with More Teeth than the Osmond Family!
-   Iron Maiden: Any cover where Eddie the Head makes an appearance, especially Iron Maiden.
-   Ozzy Osbourne’s face on the cover of Down to Earth has a much more skeletal and macabre look throughout his body and face, and two heads coming out of his head screaming as if they’re in pain, as it’s really a nightmarish look!
-   The music video for Michael Jackson's "Ghosts" has a lot of creepy moments in it thanks to its supernatural aesthetic, including Michael stripping himself of his skin into a skeleton, but one face<small>◊</small> from the music video has become rather infamous for its creep factor.

-   The music video for Azealia Banks' "Yung Rapunxel" features her eyes replaced by mouths, with each mouth working independently to lip-sync the lyrics of the song.
-   The album cover for _Monster_ by R.E.M. is a close up of a bobcat-lynx-cougar... _thing_ drawn in black marker on a balloon. It is _very_ disquieting.
-   The cover for _Runner's High_ by _The Pillows_ is a pastel drawing of a white rabbit with its mouth wide open and a pair of absolutely _bloodshot_ eyes. It's guaranteed to frighten children.

    Mythology & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology: The Gorgons, whose faces would turn you to stone. They supposedly had been beautiful originally, before they became like this. And some think they might still be beautiful, but there is no way of finding out. In the original, only Medusa could petrify with a look; her sisters had different powers (one just caused people to instantly drop dead).
-   Celtic Mythology: One of the many horrific details of Cu Chulainn's infamous _riastrad_ or "warp-spasm" was that one of his eyes would bulge out of the socket (and fall out) and the other would be sucked in, his lips would peel back to reveal a Slasher Smile with More Teeth than the Osmond Family, and his mouth would stretch down to his chest. Even if he wasn't exactly an evil guy, people tended to be really uneasy around him.

    Podcasts 

-   A recurring motif in _I Am in Eskew_. The main protagonist, David Ward, sees them on the blueprints of an unending, blank building he visits, the audience that watches him and Allegra, and especially on his fake son, Happy Jack Adam, who he is forced to live with after he lets Jack kill his fake daughter, Lucia.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! East Academy_, Marcus shows one during his Breaking Speech to Gretel. it is apparently based on the photo of his RPer.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The krenshar, a catlike monster introduced in 3<sup>rd</sup> edition to give low-level paladins a use for their fear immunity, uses its complex cheek and brow musculature to _fold its whole face back_, exposing bare muscle and bone, when using its _Scare_ special ability.
    -   Changelings from the _Eberron_ campaign can take the "Disturbing Visage" feat, which among other tricks can unnerve foes by looking more intimidating. The illustration on the _Races of Eberron_ sourcebook definitely falls into this trope, but exaggerates the actual effectiveness of the feat.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade_:
    -   The Nosferatu have this as a Clan Curse, as their founder was Punished with Ugly by Caine himself, and anyone embraced into the clan will follow suit. They can't live in normal human or vampire society, but they've learned to cope, woe be to anyone who underestimates this.
    -   The Tzimisce do this by choice. Their Vicissitude discipline allows them to mold flesh like clay, and as one of the more inhuman clans, they modify themselves and their servants into horrifying forms, faces included.

    Toys 

-   The Rahkshi from _BIONICLE_. Averted in the toys themselves (due to the limitations of toy design), but it is used in full force in the movie _Mask of Light_ to unleash pure Nightmare Fuel on other characters (and the viewers, naturally).
    -   The Barraki also count. They all have these freakishly bulbous, emotionless eyes that seemingly stare into nothingness. Pridak takes the cake, however, with his butt-ugly Slasher Smile, and what looks like blood splashed all over his face (which is actually his natural coloring, according to Word of God).
    -   Makuta, being a Shapeshifter\-race, are full of examples, and many of the fan-built Contest Winner Cameo figures have these as well.
-   The Evil Wand toy discovered by a parent at an Ohio dollar store has a hidden image under the foil on the wand: A disturbing photo of a girl with glowing orange eyes and a bloody, rapacious Slasher Smile cutting into her wrist with a knife.

    Visual Novels 

    Web Animation 

-   Pinkie Pie in Mister Davie's version of _Cupcakes (Sergeant Sprinkles)_ pulls off a series of increasingly disturbing expressions that all technically qualify as happy smiles.
-   Ax-Crazy Fluttershy from the _PONY.MOV_ episode "Shed" sports this during her Sanity Slippage Song intending to eat Rainbow Dash's brain. Oh no...
-   In _Homestar Runner_, Sir Shmallow (a 1930s version of the already-horrific Marshy the Marshmallow) briefly assumes one of these while screaming at the viewer to "Look lively!"
    
    **The Homestar Runner:** That monster's gonna give me nightmares.
    
-   In the flash parody _Nin10Doh: To the 64th Power,_ an Ax-Crazy Paula (of all people) sports an absolutely demonic one when Ness confronts a Runaway Dog, and again as she says those last two lines of her sentence:
-   In _Alfred's Playhouse_, Alfred makes creepy faces _constantly_.
-   Flippy's Ax-Crazy Split Personality Fliqpy from _Happy Tree Friends_ has one consisted of wide, demented eyes with Creepy Shadowed Undereyes and a fanged Slasher Smile pasted on his face the majority of the time.
-   Used frequently in _Sr. Pelo_'s _Mokey's Show_, in which the faces the characters randomly make in later episodes become more and more grotesque. One of the best examples are the faces Momi makes in Is Not Christmas, but this particular one really takes the cake for being absolutely horrifying.
-   _Squimpus McGrimpus_: The _Five Nights At Freddys_ analog horror serie's Signature Scene is one of these. In "Facial Recognition Testing", we get to see how the animatronics see William Afton; while the grey smug little smile he has before it all goes wrong is unnerving, it's outdone when we get to see the juicy part: Williams face contorted into a Slasher Smile, tinted purple, and warped to a freaky shape. "Finale" makes it worse, as when Michael burns down Fazbears Fright, in turn killing Springtrap, we get to see the horrific revision of Aftons portrait, now tinted red and his face warping into a terrified expression to match his ultimate fate.

    Webcomics 

-   _Ctrl+Alt+Del_: In the _Starcaster Chronicles_ segment, Cort met up with a Knowledge Broker named Ssissimias to look for a job that pays in advance. Then it's revealed that Ssissimias is a Hive Mind of Puppeteer Parasite infesting the corpse of a man, with holes on its right cheek where the worms poke out at times. They are affable and reasonable, but warns Cort that if he ever crosses them, he will be their next meat puppet. Tryphophobics, beware.
-   _8-Bit Theater_: Comedic In-Universe example is Black Mage. Let's just say he doesn't show his face for a reason.
-   _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_'s background material gave us this. Oh Lordy. Gee, I wonder what that clan feeds on...
-   _Stardroids_:
-   Characters in _Mias World_ are known for suddenly pulling ones that would cause most people to shit themselves. Especially King and '44.. Seriously, Jesus Christ.
-   _HoodRats!_: Skyblack plays this trope more than once, usually when the comic wants to highlight how dangerous she is. Here are some examples.
-   _Homestuck_ has a few. Particularly notable is Jack Noir, who... holy shit.<small>◊</small>
-   _Mob Psycho 100_: Any time Mob displays anger is usually a case of Tranquil Fury, with little change of expression. When he discovers however what appears to be as the burning corpses of his family in a house fire, his expression becomes a _downright terrifying_ face of overwhelming, burning rage. Sweet dreams everyone<small>◊</small>.
-   _Sleepless Domain_: When Tessa relives her Dream, things quickly start going off the rails as Goops inserts her own memories, causing the Girl in the Dream's face to melt away into her own terrifying Slasher Smile. Sweet dreams, Tessa!<small>◊</small>
-   _Romantically Apocalyptic_'s main protagonist, "Zee Captain" has a face like this, apparently. In issue 23, he confronts the aliens that abducted Snippy after OWNING one of them with a slice of cake(!) and forces them to gaze upon his Angry face, removing his gas mask in front of them. We don't see, but the alien's reaction says a lot!

-   _Trevor (2020)_: Trevor's face is going through some Facial Horror by the time the audience gets to see it, and it isn't exactly getting any better.
-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_ has a couple of instances...Zimmy's already a little creepy, given she's got some kind of black clouds where her eyes should be. Then this happens in the middle of a psychic jaunt Astral Projection into an unconscious Antimony's subconscious.
-   _Violet Zombie_: Penelope Martinez demonstrates this ability frequently, either to scare people or just for fun.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_. Tagii is not happy about being cut off from her external senses by Thurl, and as a result of her treatment takes up a far more ghoulish appearance that reflects her condition.
-   In _Commander Kitty_, Zenith picks up this kind of expression when she realizes Nin Wah is present. She shows off a subtler yet simultaneously _far_ creepier one when she's about to disembowel Ace and company.
-   In _Monster Pulse_, energy ghosts can cause a human's body part to become autonomous. One example is Michael Rjinder, whose entire skin has become such a monster. It usually placidly sits on his body, looking eerie with its striations. But when it gets excited...
-   _The Property of Hate_ gives us Click's waterlogged face during "Ex position." You're bound to get nightmares from seeing it.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Pandora's face turns monstrous when she gets angry. Her eyes become like a cat's, and her teeth become sharp and with pronounced canines.
-   _Sweet Home (2017)_: The author's trademark style shines through with the monsters and the monster infected, giving them one of these anytime any one of them does anything evil. The criminals also get it sometimes, to a lesser degree, as well as Hyein after her Sanity Slippage and Hyun when his monster side takes over.

-   Half of the creepy images hosted on the Creepypasta Wiki will want to make you sleep with a gun under your pillow. Especially Jeff the Killer one. Let us not forget about any variation of the smile.jpg found on that site either.
-   TV Tropes:
-   _deviantART_: This Manticore
-   The Hellbeast in _NES Godzilla Creepypasta_.
-   _Whateley Universe_ story "The Turks or the Geek": Carmilla threatens a superpowered mutant. Hundreds of tentacles come out of her body and grab him. Then her face splits. Down the center. Inside are teeth and more tentacles, and a lot of the tentacles have eyeballs on the tips, and... It's so horrifying the guy wets himself.
-   This fan-made image of the Creepypasta _Suicide Mouse._
-   An unintentional example. There are a couple<small>◊</small> of jokes on the web about the Rejuvenique mask being this. Because despite never being portrayed as such in the commercials, it's still creepy. Why? It's a mask that looks like this<small>◊</small> and delivers tiny shocks to the face.
-   Killerbunnies' Io "Nightmare Fuel" McMorrison posses a somewhat milder example of this trope. To elaborate further, she has with her wide, somewhat angry looking blue eyes and her teeth are growing through the skin to outside of her mouth. Naturally,on the note of her teeth, with such a deformity, one wonders how she eats.
-   And then of course there's the infamous Momo of the Momo Challenge, which originated as a creepy statue in Japan with giant blank, staring eyes and a rather unsettling smile.
-   The picture in the Creepypasta ''Teeth.jpg<small>◊</small>. It was made from one of the protagonist's friends with more than just Photoshop.
-   Science and math-based artist Robby Kraft composed a face from various inanimate objects resembling faces, i.e. pareidolias. The result is worthy of a Creepypasta.
-   This image of a cross between a pig-tailed girl, a chunky middle aged man, and a monkey adorned many an early flash animations and Youtube videos in the 2000s. It actually happens to be the result of a photo mashup from an early photo editing software app called Kai's Power Goo.

-   In _Marble Hornets_, near the end of Entry #22, and in one of totheark's video responses.
-   Speaking of Marble Hornets, the Observer from _Tribe Twelve_ has a pretty nightmarish face at the end of COMECLOSER.
-   A Running Gag in Mr. Plinkett Reviews is for him to react (or overreact...) to an inhuman looking face:
    
    OH MY GOD, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR _FACE_!?
    
-   Todd in the Shadows is revealed to have this in _To Boldly Flee_, neatly explaining why he does all of his reviews in the shadows or wearing a mask. Naturally, the other characters see it but the audience does not. The horrifying thing about his face? According to Word of God, his face is a mirror into people's souls — the worse you are, the worse his face looks. Which is why the Makeover Fairy and The Nostalgia Chick have both reacted in horror to it. The fact that Lupa remained calm when seeing Todd's face may lessen this slightly (indicating that good people see a more normal-looking face). The concept is still pretty creepy, though.
-   "The Glitch" by _Corridor Digital_ focuses on a group of game characters as they try to evade a series of game-breaking glitches. Mario falls into a glitched portion of the game world, and just before he sinks in completely, his face suddenly and graphically morphs into several hideous visages as his screams digitally decompose.
-   The reason why Laina Morris became well-known as the Overly Attached Girlfriend. And she only needs to open her eyes wide and smile to do so.
-   This trope plays a major role in Illusion of Bias when the girl is unhappy the she lost her face. She then has a nightmare where she has a hideous face.
-   The entirety of _Monster Factory_ is based on this trope. Out of all of the monsters in the series, Truck Shepard has by far the most nightmarish face, because its features have been horribly distorted thanks to a little hacking. For example, at one point his cheek stretches into infinite and his eye is several inches away from his face. In the words of Griffin, "Yikes!"
-   _Bedtime Stories (YouTube Channel)_ has Michael Taylor's face at the ending of "The Devil Made Me Do It". It didn't help that the narrator had mentioned that there were still 3 demons still possessing him after an incomplete exorcism.
-   The "basic" expressions for the Inhuman Emotions that the Fantastic Drug Thalasin+ enables you to experience. Junji Ito would be proud.
-   _Lights Out (2016)_ Good luck sleeping tonight.......or ever again. Just watch Diana's true form when the lights are on - espeically in the 2013 short film when that......thing appears on the woman's bedside table. It is seriously nightmare fuel and we advise you not to search it. For those of you that want a description of the jumpscare without searching it, here it is: the creature in the short film is a nightmarish humanoid with a female-like appearence, dead white eyes and a mouth full of sharp teeth, alongside long brown hair.
