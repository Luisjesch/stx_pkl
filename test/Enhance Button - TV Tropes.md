**Zapp:** Why's it still blurry?!  
**Kif:** That's all the resolution we have. Making it bigger doesn't make it clearer.  
**Zapp:** It does on _CSI: Miami_.

The detective and a forensic technician are hovering over a computer screen showing grainy CCTV security camera footage of a major crime. _"Zoom in. Now... enhance"_ says the detective. The image gets bigger and zooms in so clearly that we see the suspect's neck tattoo and necklace. _"Enhance more"_ says the detective and now he can read the perp's monogrammed initials on his shirt in a reflection.

A staple of any crime drama and Police Procedural, the "Enhance Button" is a computer function that allows you to turn a tiny, blurred, or grainy image into a clear, unmistakable piece of evidence. It's nearly always heralded by someone standing next to the computer ordering it (or the technician operating it) to "Enhance."

This allows characters to glean information beyond what the picture itself actually contains. As such, most Enhance Button functions are impossible in real life. The Enhance Button derives from legitimate Real Life "image enhancement" techniques that allow you to change things like colors or saturation, or compare frames of a video, which will create a clearer image than before. But there's still a limit to what it can do, and it can only work with the data in the photo. The Enhance Button in fiction _adds_ data.

The most unrealistic cases will even allow you to change the camera angle, see through or around things, or pick up tiny reflections in unlikely places. They also have an incredible zoom, which creates new pixels rather than simply enlarging them. Also cringe-inducing is where the source image is an old, low-resolution VHS tape from a gas station security cam.

Sometimes a technician will point out this impossibility but nevertheless be able to "clean up" the image with his mad computer skillz, with an appropriate Hand Wave or technobabble ("I applied a Fast Fourier Transformation algorithm to the vector flux capacitor") to explain how he did it. This is based off a Real Life technique where you can _guess_ what's in the picture based on the position and color of the pixels, the way you might be able to guess the words of a missing page in a book based on the text of the surrounding pages. This kind of thing is good for guessing things from a limited range of possibilities, like license plate numbers, but not much else.

The Enhance Button is a common part of the Rewind, Replay, Repeat sequence, where some kind of investigator is looking through pictures or video footage for evidence and gets to spot a clue that's not initially obvious. It's often also got Facial Recognition Software and an Omniscient Database to help identify individuals. Interestingly, the investigator rarely uses the Button himself; he has to order the techie on the computer to do it, hence the ubiquitous command, "Enhance". Conversely, the techie rarely enhances on his own initiative, even though he knows the software better than anyone and can guess what his boss wants him to do.

It's such a ritual that it's not uncommon to lampshade or parody the phenomenon, with a tech-illiterate investigator who expects this to work, or with a _clearly_ impossible enhance button that wraps around to Rule of Funny.

An enterprising Troper has edited together a montage of the abuses of this trope covering many of the film and live action TV examples: _Let's Enhance_. Ironically, since the original, the creator has, uh, enhanced the quality and made an HD version. (The above link is for that HD version.)

    Anime & Manga 

-   Subverted in _20th Century Boys_: Fujiki and Yoshitsune have some old pictures magnified so Kyoko will have an easier time identifying someone in them, but she points out that it just makes them blurrier.
-   In the climax of _Belle (2021)_, Suzu and her friends are able to pinpoint Kei and Tomo's location in Tokyo, thanks to Hiroka enhancing a video of their apartment and discovering a pair of buildings seen from a window that Kamishin pointed out.
-   In _Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040_ episode 7, a worker in an undersea base discovers that his wife is cheating on him when he enhances a video message from her and sees a naked man sitting on her bed reflected in the bezel of her watch.
-   In the _Case Closed_ episode "Scoop Picture Murder Case" Professor Agasa scans an image from a magazine and zooms pretty far in to help Conan find evidence - in the reflection on a mirror, which is partly behind a fire, at night. Of course he can enhance it with his advanced algorithms which account for air humidity and the position of the stars. Literally.
-   The _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ episode "Interceptors" had almost an exact reference to the similar scene from _Blade Runner_ mentioned below; the terminology used by the voice-activated photo-enhancement program is even identical, with Togusa saying lines like "Enhance 32 to 50" just as Deckard does. The enhancing does bupkis for the investigation. Togusa's "Eureka!" Moment comes after hours of pointless enhancing when he comes to a picture of a mirror that doesn't reflect a _camera._ This is when he realizes that the pictures were taken with the (minimally-enhanced) subject's _eyes._ Someone lo-jacked the subject with Nanomachines!
-   Every so often in _Great Teacher Onizuka_, somebody wants to un-mosaic an image, either to identify a person in it or just to ogle their concealed body parts. While impossible in real life, this always works in the setting. There's a bit of blink-and-you'll-miss-it justification at one point, implying that the mosaic functions in all commercial and most freeware graphics packages were written by a grand conspiracy of perverts, who devised ways to embed the original image data in the end result — making mosaics reversible.
-   Parodied in a _Honey and Clover_ episode, in which one of the characters pauses, rewinds, enlarges, and enhances the face behind the waterfall _of one of his own memories._ It works, naturally, although it helps that he was obsessed with the character in question.
-   _Lycoris Recoil_ has people trying to figure out who is in an accidentally taken, grainy, picture of an arms deal. By Episode 4, the trade has been rudimentarily replicated in 3D from one photo.

-   The beginning of _Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns_ shows a grainy image of Mewtwo standing on a mountain, which the technicians keep enhancing it so it becomes clearer.

    Comic Books 

-   _The New Universe_: The short-lived comic _Spitfire and the Troubleshooters_ has an exceptionally implausible example, where a character uses a special helmet that visualizes computer data, and ends up "enhancing" an image of a villain's face — generated from a _written_ report.
-   _The Transformers (Marvel)_: In issue #11, Shockwave accesses Rumble's brain to find out if he saw anyone breaking into the captured Ark. He uses his "more advanced" robot brain to enhance a pixelated image from Rumble's memory, revealing that Buster Witwicky had snuck in because he was too small to be noticed by Rumble at the time.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _The Bad Guys (2022)_, Ms. Tarantula is able to instantly recreate Diane Foxington's pupil from a selfie Mr. Wolf took with her earlier to bypass a retina scanner. With the film being what it is, it's Played for Laughs.
-   In _Big Hero 6_, Hiro's friends show him some security footage from Krei's "Project: Silent Sparrow", and Professor Callaghan attacking Krei after the teleportation portal fails, evidently killing the pilot. Hiro zooms in on a shot of the pilot, and discovers the name "Callaghan" printed on her helmet, revealing that she was Professor Callaghan's daughter and that he was seeking revenge against Krei for her death.
-   In _Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island_, a bit of camera footage is enhanced, through the controls on the camera that recorded it no less, to show a ghost that was present during the recording. It's not _just_ an Enhance Button, though; Fred explicitly describes what he's doing as he enhances the image, and reveals that he has to alter the contrast and sharpness to reveal the ghost, which is invisible to the naked eye.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Averted in _Accidental Hero_, when the reporters are trying to zoom in on an image of the mysterious rescuer in the background of a video recording:
    
    **Joan:** There's no face. There's nothing really to work with. Big dots, that's all you're gonna get.
    
-   In _Avatar_, the Big Bad needs an Enhance Button to be able to positively identify Jake when he's trying to stop the bulldozers.
-   Exaggerated to the point of sheer ridiculousness in _Baby Geniuses_: The Big Bad's right-hand scientist showcases in the middle of the opening Info Dump about how babies are actually super-geniuses with their own secret language by showcasing "computer extrapolations" of babies' doodles and random slamming of a piano's keys that reveal the doodles are actually notes in a long-disappeared cuneiform alphabet (ancient Babylonian, for the sake of the pun) and the piano playing is actually a Mozart-level symphony.
-   _Blade Runner_ infamously uses this when Deckard analyzes a snapshot to bring out truly magical levels of detail. He's even able to follow a reflection around a corner. Nonetheless, it is set 20 Minutes into the Future (2019).
    -   The 1997 tie-in video game allows the player to replicate this feat.
-   In _Blade: Trinity_, the Nightstalkers get one piece of Drake's armored skin. Their computer is able to "extrapolate" the rest of Drake's body from that one spike.
-   This forms the plot of _Blowup_; a photographer tries to investigate a murder he believes he caught on camera, but loses resolution as he tries to enhance his picture.
-   Averted in _The Bourne Identity_: The police are able to "sharpen" a blurry image of Jason Bourne, but it's far from perfect and they have to call in a police sketch artist to look at it. Even then, he can only provide about four or five educated guesses.
    -   On the other hand, it was played ridiculously straight in _Jason Bourne_ even compared to other trope examples, producing a perfect image from a low-resolution security camera still. You'd think that Paul Greengrass of all people would recognize the difficulty in getting a perfect camera image...
-   In _Bringing Down the House_, the protagonist joins a dating service, but his date isn't the person shown in her profile picture. She shows that she is indeed in the picture — in the background, in handcuffs, visible only with an Enhance Button.
-   The 1948 film _Call Northside 777_ provides the earliest example; a reporter proves that a witness lied in a trial eleven years earlier by blowing up an old photo of the witness with the accused. He can thus read the date on a newspaper in the background, revealing that the witness saw the suspect a day before she claimed to.
-   In the _Charlie's Angels (2000)_ movie, they enhance the image of a normal CCTV tape taken in a normal parking garage at night, and spot their target through the reflection in the door of a nearby car.
-   Variant, downplayed example in the first _Darkman_ movie: Dr. Westlake's face was destroyed in an explosion, so he wants to create a mask using his synthetic skin that will restore his original appearance. However, he only has access to a single photograph of his original face, and the photo has been damaged, showing only half of his full face. He sets his computer to construct a 3D model of his face by mirroring the data from the complete half onto the other half, since his face is largely symmetrical. The computer is working to reconstruct a very limited image with clearly established boundaries and results, but it still takes days to complete.
-   Played with in _Déjà Vu (2006)_. A secret government agency is using satellite data to reconstruct every aspect of an area in 3D, allowing them to zoom in at ground level, go inside structures, and even recreate audio. The protagonist is extremely skeptical, before it's revealed that they're folding space-time to view past events in real time.
-   Averted in _The Departed_: After a long, tense scene in which Colin Sullivan is pursued through the streets by Billy Costigan without their ever clearly seeing each other, he finds Costigan on security camera footage. There is no enhance button, and zooming in reveals nothing.
-   In _Disturbia_, the protagonist apparently has a good enough video camera that he can enhance a split-second image seen through a hole in a grate, in a dark house, into a high resolution image.
-   In _Eagle Eye_, agents Morgan and Grant try to get a clear image of the suspect from CCTV footage of a moving bus. Morgan asks the tech to enhance a completely dark section, revealing a reflection with the face of a different suspect.
-   _Enemy of the State_:
    -   The NSA uses two takes from separate frames from a security video and rotates the camera angle to see a shopping bag hidden behind someone's back. They try to mitigate the ridiculousness by handwaving about how the computer is "speculating" and being unable to find out what's _inside_ the shopping bag, which is what the Big Bad really wants to know.
    -   The trailer contains a scene where Zavitz, viewing the footage from his wildlife camera, pauses and rotates the view to see Reynolds' henchman stick a needle in the congressman's neck. In the actual movie, he simply sees it in the background and zooms in.
    -   Spoofed in a scene where Dean and Brill are talking on top of a building, and the government goons are watching them by satellite. One of the goons asks if they could zoom in and see their faces:
        
        **Fiedler:** The satellite's 150 miles up. It can only look _straight down_.  
        **Krug:** Huh, seems kind of limited.  
        **Fiedler:** Well, maybe you should invent something better.  
        **Krug:** Well, maybe I will!
        
-   In _Evidence_, criminal investigators looking through dark, partially corrupted footage are able to "enhance" it enough to get clear images out of pixel soup.
-   In _Fast Five_, Dwayne Johnson's team uses this to track down Dominic Torreto. The enhancement itself doesn't actually reveal a clear photo because he's masked, but it's clear enough that they're able to match him by facial structure.
-   _The Fugitive_ provides an audio example; the background noises on a wiretap recording are enhanced until the team can clear make out the name of a train station being broadcast over a distant PA system.
-   In _F/X 2_, Rolly uses an Enhance Button to get an image of the killer. It takes several zooms, and each takes more time than the last, but he eventually gets a picture that's slightly over-saturated and blurry, but still altogether too clear as he discovers when the killer choses that moment to turn up in his room.
-   Both _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)_ and the Swedish film which preceded it have ridiculous uses of Enhance Buttons on photos taken from a distance, 30 years ago, on ordinary cameras, by ordinary citizens completely unrelated to the case. This indeed helps them identify the murderer. The original novel is guilty of this to some extent but is more explicit in how much guesswork and Photoshop there is in the process.
-   Parodied in Mel Brooks' _High Anxiety_. As a secondary character blows up a photograph, he pins up a series of even greater enlargements until he finally gets one roughly 20 feet across, which he examines with a magnifying glass before exclaiming, "Aha!" It's oddly more realistic than most examples, because it's from a medium-format camera, which even back then could easily take 150 megapixel photos — the _real_ unrealistic bit is where he can get photo paper that big.
-   In _Honey, I Blew Up the Kid_, two lab technicians muse over a very blurred photo of Adam and his stuffed bunny, thinking it's an alien. When Dr. Hendrickson arrives, he presses one button which completely unblurs the photo.
-   In the first film adaptation of _Judge Dredd_:
    -   A Judge is able to feed a physical photograph into a computer and remove the artificial layers to reveal the original image beneath, implying that the computer-generated layers are part of the hard copy (and that the fakers never thought to "flatten" them into a single layer).
    -   In an aversion, Dredd's defense counsel maintains that CCTV footage of Dredd supposedly murdering someone is too low-res to be admitted into evidence. They point out that his face cannot be seen at the angle in question, he never speaks, and his uniform could be a forgery.
-   Used twice in _Kingsman: The Secret Service_:
    -   When the Kingsmen watch TV footage of Valentine announcing his free Sim card deal, they are able to zoom in from a wide angle shot to a crisp close-up on the scar on Valentine's assistant's neck.
    -   When they analyze footage taken with Harry's spy glasses at Valentine's place, they are able to zoom in on an envelope carried by one of Valentine's assistants, which clues them in on the "South Glade Mission Church".
-   Used to chilling effect in _The Last Broadcast_. Ostensibly a documentary looking into the murder of three filmmakers years after the event, the documentary maker asks a photographic expert to enhance an blurry image of a monstrous-looking creature. The image is returned to throughout the film, each time being slightly clearer, but is only revealed at the end. The image isn't just blurry; it's also stretched vertically, and it turns out to be a picture of the documentary maker himself, who is implied to be the original killer.
-   In _Looney Tunes: Back in Action_, the Big Bad gets a hold of a photo of a secret map, with Daffy Duck blocking the important part. He seems to expect an Enhance Button to be able to "remove the duck". No one responds to his increasingly angry commands, and he breaks the glass the photo is projected on.
-   A non-tech version appears in _Lucy_, where the title character uses her powers to scan the memories of the Big Bad to learn where the other drug mules were being sent to, using mundane glances to a reflection off _someone's eye_.
-   In _Next (2007)_, FBI agents zoom in and enhance a grainy frame of CCTV footage enough to get a VIN number from an SUV.
-   The climax of the film _No Way Out (1987)_ hinges partly on the excruciatingly slow "enhancement" of a tiny, blurry Polaroid picture — continuously displayed with a Viewer-Friendly Interface so the moviegoer can see just how close it is to implicating Kevin Costner as a Soviet mole. The computer program doing the "enhancing" is explicitly stated to be guessing what's there rather than magically creating missing data, but the resulting image is still incredibly accurate.
-   In _Patriot Games_, Jack Ryan is looking for the Big Bad in a photo with a large group of people and asks the tech to zoom in on a number of different people, frustrated that he hasn't found what he's looking for. But after a protracted scene of zooming and enhancing, Jack finds what he's looking for: "Tits." It's based off a similar scene in the novel, where the tech explains to Jack that a woman would have to be at least a C-cup for there to be any visible cleavage in the photo.
-   In _The Pink Panther (2006)_, investigators zoom in on the picture of Clouseau's airport accident, revealing the Pink Panther diamond on the bag scanner's screen. Interestingly, you could see it without enhancing, making the Button unnecessary.
-   In _Renegade Force_, investigators are looking at the video of a crime scene and want to enhance a brief reflection on a silver vase — not just a fleeting image, but also a warped and degraded one. They send the footage to "the lab", which sends back several high-quality prints of a gloved finger resting outside the trigger guard of an automatic weapon.
-   In the American version of _The Ring_, video producer Noah employs a more realistic version when breaking down the Cursed Video frame by frame. He notices that one frame has a jittery video bleeding from the side of the frame, meaning that there's something outside the frame, in the overscan. His professional equipment allows him to read the overscan, which shows the Moesko Island Lighthouse. Rachel has to use the high-end processors and tracking heads at her newspaper's media department to get a clearer image.
-   _Sneakers_.
    -   While the team is watching a videotape of Gunter Janek's office, they zoom in on an answering machine and its image becomes clear.
    -   While the team is watching a video of a man getting into a car:
        
        **Bishop:** Can we get plates?  
        **Mother:** Let me see. Zooming in. Another bump. Enhancing. There's your plate. 180 IQ.
        
-   In _Species_, they get a blurry still from a video camera and manage to enhance the image in the lab, if only slightly.
-   In the _Stargate_ movie, technicians use several presses of the Enhance Button to discern glyphs on the other side's Stargate.
-   In _Star Trek: Generations_, The Duras sisters are able to enhance the feed from Geordi's VISOR to ridiculous extents, being able to see the Enterprise's shield frequency. Then again, the VISOR is a futuristic Everything Sensor, so it may just be that high resolution; Geordi simply doesn't use it at that setting because it's rarely needed.
-   _Star Trek Into Darkness_ takes this trope to the single most absolute extreme humanly possibly in the history of media. During a conference discussing the recent bombing of London by Khan, Kirk is looking over pictures of the aftermath and, upon locating one with the perpetrator in view of the camera, zooms in, completely changes the angle, and is able to find a bag that he was carrying at the time of the crime. Now granted, this is the future. So who knows how camera's are working now.
-   Mocked in _Super Troopers_, in a scene where Ramathorn, sitting at a computer, is tasked with printing off a photo of a suspect. He at first trolls his superior by repeatedly saying "Enhance!" between random keystrokes, before his exasperated superior yells at him to "just print the damn thing!"
-   In _Taken_, Brian Mills gets a lead on his daughter's kidnapping by enhancing a photo found on her camera phone card, in which the spotter is a faint reflection on a nearby phone booth. Crazily, he does the enhancing at a subway station photo kiosk, although the original photo may have been higher-resolution than the kiosk shows.
-   Used near the climax of _The Truman Show_: Christof gets suspicious at Truman taking an impromptu nap in the basement and, reviewing the footage after he's supposedly gone to sleep, focuses on a blurry motion which, after enhancement, reveals the hand of Truman crawling away.
-   In _Underworld (2003)_, the protagonist has a picture of someone whose face is only four pixels large. But at the press of a button, it becomes a clear image of her love interest.
-   Largely averted in _U.S. Marshals_; zoomed-in CCTV footage is visibly pixelated, and the focus is fuzzy, if not quite as bad as it should be. Nonetheless, it provides Gerard and his team useful clues about the homicide their fugitive committed.

    Literature 

-   Michael Connelly's novels:
    -   _The Narrows_ subverts this trope. Our protagonist detective, who knows little of computers, asks another character to "enhance" a digital picture this way, only to be told that it's impossible.
    -   In _9 Dragons_, this is played realistically, with the use of a computer program to "guess" or fill in the image.
-   Subverted in _Animorphs_: Marco spots an Andalite on a TV show. He visits Ax, they replay the footage together, and confirm that yes, it's an Andalite. They still can't figure out who it is, so Marco suggests zooming and enhancing. Ax protests that he can't get better detail than what he has without the original video reel.
-   _Artemis Fowl_'s title character uses the C Cube to enhance low quality video into much higher quality one. It's Handwaved as fairy technology; a previous book suggests it works by removing impurities in the wire that transmitted the footage (which wouldn't do squat for the digital signal itself, but whatever.)
-   A character does this _by hand_ in one _The Baby-Sitters Club_ novel. After she's blown up a couple photos as much as she can and still can't make out a background detail, she photographs the pictures and then blows _those_ photos up, resulting in a perfectly clear and damning piece of evidence.
-   A _BattleTech_ novel, _Assumption of Risk_, has an entire chapter dedicated to a minor character enacting this trope. Then again, the year is 3055 and holographic display technology is widely available, to say nothing of the Humongous Mecha of the setting. It probably isn't too much of a stretch to expect some absurdly high-resolution camera equipment in this setting.
-   The heroine of the _Cam Jansen_ series can use her "Photographic Memory" in this way to solve minor crimes. While eidetic memory is rare in Real Life, it does kind of work like this, allowing one to see new details in old memories as if one were looking at a photograph. But this character uses it to ridiculous extremes, such as being able to read the address on a magazine carried by someone walking by.
-   Zig-Zagged in _Congo_: The hunt to enhance a piece of footage that displays one of the killer gorillas storming the first ERTS camp requires multiple specialised computer programs, some of which need to be run to counteract a degradation of the footage that the previous program unwillingly creates, and all of which need a long amount of time. Ross can work the programs faster and more efficiently than anyone. The resulting picture is still bad enough that Travis at first thinks Ross found a rookie programmer's Easter Egg. But it's still just good enough to convince Travis that Ross can be the "console hot-dogger" for the second expedition.
-   Hand Waved in _Dirty Martini_ by J. A. Konrath, where a tech-savvy police grunt drops some Techno Babble to describe how they were able to filter and blow up a grainy picture until it became legible.
-   The _Discworld_ book _Feet of Clay_ parodies the trope with a sort of Victorian-era proto-CSI, asking an imp to paint smaller and smaller portions of the victim's eyes, eventually revealing the burned-in image of the last thing he saw. Fortunately, the imp is the main component of a Magitek camera with an incredible zoom. And even then, he only gets barely more than a couple of dots of light — which is still enough to give Vimes the clue he needs.
-   Done realistically in _The Hunt for Red October_: While the CIA does enhance poor quality photos of the eponymous submarine, they need to map the lens of the actual camera used to take the photo (not a similar camera) and use that map to break the photograph down into as close to the original image as possible — which still isn't perfect.
-   In _Inferno Roger Macbride Allen_, a computer compiles images from multiple security cameras to create a full representation of what's going on at a party. If anyone wanders out of frame in all of the cameras, the computer extrapolates as to where they were in the room during that period (although the image is low-quality).
-   Isaac Asimov's _Foundation Series_: "The Merchant Princes": Hober Mallow records the events when a Foundation missionary seeks refuge aboard Mallow's ship on the planet Korell. He later enhances an image on the Visual Record that shows an invisible tattoo on the missionary's arm. The tattoo says KSP, proving that the missionary is actually a plant - a member of the Korellian Secret Police.
-   In the _Jack Reacher_ novel "Die Trying" by Lee Child, the FBI takes the security footage of a crime, isolates the faces, and then mathematically rotates the side shots to make them full face images. The technician explicitly uses words like "hypothetically" and "simulation", points out that the algorithm assumes that people's faces are mostly symmetrical, and states that if one of the people was missing an ear or had a scar, they wouldn't be able to get that part right. The FBI lead investigator accepts the limitations but finds that the results are actually helpful in the case.
-   Done realistically in _The Martian_: At some point a NASA engineer laments that a satellite photo's low precision is making their work difficult; they're told that the NSA _already_ ran the photo through the enhancing software they use for Spy Satellites, and this is the best they could get.
-   Used well in Michael Crichton's _Rising Sun_ (as well as in the movie); the Enhance Button is needed because the security footage of the murder has been doctored to remove the killer and replace him with another suspect. The police is totally fooled by the doctored tape, but the Japanese audio-video wizard isn't, and she can reconstruct the footage to prove it's doctored — although not to see who the real killer is. (For that, they have to obtain an original copy.) She can do it because she can see how sloppy the editing is and claims that they were hoping no one would notice:
    
    "They think we will not be _careful_. That we will not be _Japanese_."
    
-   Subverted in Scott Westerfeld's _So Yesterday_: The protagonist asks a friend who works in computer graphics to blow up and enhance a low-quality picture from a cell phone camera. The friend explains that this is impossible, and shows what happens when you zoom in — but also shows that _blurring_ the photo can actually make it more comprehensible.
-   In the Star Trek Expanded Universe novel _Ship of the Line_, the 23rd-century border cutter USS _Bozeman_ (from the TNG episode "Cause and Effect") tries to identify a Klingon heavy cruiser (trying to make a sneak attack on a Federation outpost), but it's too far away to see any marking clearly. The computer, however, can still extrapolate from available sensor data of a blurry image to make out the letters; Klingon characters look like this<small>◊</small>, and some characters are easily recognizable from a distance, so the computer can extrapolate around those.
-   In one of the _Tom Swift_ novels, saboteurs take out a camera under their boat. To prove it was deliberate, they use the Enhance Button on its last (blurry) image to reveal the knife that cut the cord. Lampshaded in that they discuss that the computer is pretty much just making stuff up to fill the missing data.
-   Played for Laughs in Rick Cook's _The Wizardry Cursed_, when a group of high-ranking U.S. Air Force officers get a perfectly clear photo of a dragon, complete with dragon rider. Since they can't possibly believe in dragons, they decide that the photo is "out of focus", and "enhance" it until they can convince themselves that it's some new top-secret Soviet stealth airplane. By the time they break for dinner, they are arguing over the serial numbers on the tail.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Federal agents in _24_ seem to do this a lot, such as when the FBI finds out that Tony Almeida is still alive.
    -   They do get a chance to lampshade it once: the Chinese government produces an enhanced photograph of a CTU agent illegally entering a Chinese embassy, and Jack Bauer immediately denies its authenticity by saying it was digitally altered.
    -   Averted in season two: when CTU has to find out what was written on a burnt piece of paper they call in a specialist with his own equipment (which is _better than what CTU has_) and it still takes him close to an hour to extract something actionable.
    -   Played straight in season six with the security camera footage of Jack, entering the building where David Palmer was shot from.
-   Parodied in _30 Rock_: Jack receives an old home movie of his younger self opening a now-forgotten birthday gift, but the object itself is always out of shot. Curious, he summons a techie to "zoom in and enhance" on the wrapped box to find out what's inside. The tech tells him he can't do that, but he has a better solution: just call the original gift giver and ask.
-   Averted in _Alias_: Marshal is working to get a better look at a murderer's face from a very poor-quality security camera. He creates a rendering program that takes the movement of the face in the image and attempts to reconstruct the face from there. It takes a day or two to render, and ends up failing due to a virus.
-   _Angel_:
    -   Inverted in an episode in which Angel is given a visual image taken from the _psychic imprints_ of a blood sample. Angel asks if it can be cleaned up at all, only for Wesley to tell him no — because it's not a real photograph.
    -   Played straight in "Dad" when the demonic lawyers zoom in 100x on Lorne's shirt pocket. Then again, they're demonic, so maybe their CCTV footage is high-definition.
-   In _Babylon 5_, not only is the computer able to enhance a motion-blurred image to perfect clarity, but it is also able to figure out from a vague verbal instruction which portion of the image Londo wants to enhance.
-   Mocked in _Barry_. Cops come to Barry's acting class with a video of a killer (actually Barry himself) shooting out the mobster who killed one of the aspiring actors. An actor suggests the cops use the "Enhance button" to get a clearer look at the picture, to which the detective answers "That's not a thing".
-   In _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_, a character says it'll take a day to enhance the picture of someone's reflection in a computer mainframe, as seen in CCTV footage. The computer ultimately produces a crystal-clear image of the character who had been implicated of sabotaging the mainframe, but in a variation, the image turns out to have been faked by the Cylons in the first place. Despite the outcome, however, it still contains the fundamental aspects of the trope: it produced a clear image, and everyone involved expected this.
-   Parodied in _The Big Bang Theory_ when Howard and Raj find a drone crashed in Howard's backyard and use footage from its onboard camera to try and return it to its owner. They spot a pin on the owner's lapel in the video, and Raj tells Howard to zoom in on it. Howard picks up his laptop and, making a "zooming" sound effect with his mouth, shoves it into Raj's face.
    
    **Raj:** Yeah, I know you're being a jerk, but it's actually helpful.
    
-   In the _Blake's 7_ episode "Stardrive", a Federation patrol is blown up by a tiny one-man spacecraft pulling a Hyperspeed Ambush. It's too fast to be seen by the naked eye, so they have to rewind a recording frame by frame to find the attacker. Despite this, the resolution is still high enough to zoom in on an insignia on the pilot's helmet and establish who he is. At least they have the excuse of this taking place in the future, when camera technology would have improved considerably.
-   _Bones_ has all kinds of crazy image stuff:
    -   In "A Boy In A Bush", this trope is subverted at first, when Booth asks to zoom in and is told that it won't work because the image only has so many pixels. Ten minutes later, they find a reflection in a door taken by the same security cameras by "repolarizing" it to do exactly what they just said they couldn't do. (Angela later claims to have a patent pending on the device, implying that it doesn't do anything we would know how to do yet.)
    -   In another episode, Booth and Bones take a scan of an image from a printed tabloid newspaper showing a dead victim, zoom in on the girl's _eye_, and reconstruct the reflection of a building in the background. This should not have been possible given how many different things should have degraded the image along the way, even if the camera is really good.
    -   In "The Body In The Bag", Booth manages to get his hands on a tape that has the Victim of the Week having sex with her murderer, but since she's on top of him (only her bare back is visible) they can't see him. But Angela manages to identify him by using the reflections of his face in the objects in room and enhancing them until she can identify his face.
-   _The Brady Bunch_ has a low-tech example: Greg is demoted to football team photographer. He takes a shot of what appears to be the opponent's game-winning touchdown. With his darkroom equipment, he enhances the photo and reveals that the player's foot was out of bounds, giving his team the win (and making him the hero). The real NFL often zooms in its footage to review plays exactly like this, to varying degrees of success.
-   Averted in an episode of _The Bridge (2011)_ when the Swedish cops are looking at a supermarket security camera video of a suspect. Saga asks if they can enhance the image to get a recognisable face, but their tech guy explains that the original quality of the recording is too poor to get anything more.
-   Parodied in _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_. When presented with a grainy surveillance image that has a detail they need, Jake declares "It's time to _squint_".
-   Parodied in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, when viewing some fuzzy CCTV. One character asks another to zoom in on an element, and after being told no:
    
    **Cordelia:** So? They do it on television all the time.  
    **Xander:** Not with a regular VCR, they don't.  
    _\[This is followed a few lines later by the immortal exchange:\]_  
    **Oz:** What's that? Pause it.  
    **Xander:** Guys! It's just a normal VCR. It doesn't... Oh, wait, uh, it can do pause.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
-   _Castle_:
    -   Subverted in "Almost Famous": A character is requested to zoom in on an image, and the image gets blurrier and more pixelated. The character is asked to zoom in again, and yet again, the image gets blurrier. They're still able to identify the subject of the picture, but it's nothing a real computer couldn't do. They try it again in the following episode, "Murder Most Fowl", and Beckett lampshades Castle's expectation that this will work:
        
        **Castle:** The enhancement only increased the pixelation on all these! You can't even see there's a side-view mirror!  
        **Beckett:** It's not like on _24_, Castle — in the real world, even zoom-and-enhance can only get us so far.
        
    -   Then they start playing it straight. In series 8, they take the CCTV footage of an internet café and "enhance" a laptop screen by zooming in on its reflection in the mirror. They can read the scanned document from the laptop screen, including the smudged-out notes scribbled in the margin.
-   An episode of _Chuck_ has Morgan and Casey trying to hunt down Chuck and Sarah after they go AWOL. After locating Chuck in a CCTV image, they don't even bother with enhancing; they just zoom right in on the ticket which is as clear as if it's being pictured from a few inches away, despite the original image being kind of grainy and taken from enough of a distance that even figuring out that it was him was a really impressive feat on their part.
-   Subverted in _Cobra Kai_. A kid uses a handheld camera to record a fight between Johnny and Daniel. Afterwards they are viewing the footage and Johnny asks to see it from another angle. The kid considers the stupidity of the request before pointing out that there was one camera so there is only a single angle to view.
-   _The Colbert Report_ loves to skewer this trope, often in combination with a Bat Deduction, as in this sketch. Fundamentally, they just make up whatever the enhanced image looks like (usually something ridiculous) and photoshop it in.
-   Parodied in the _Cold Case_ episode "Time to Crime": Detectives Vera and Jeffries are watching a videotape and notice something interesting in the background. Jeffries says, "Let's enhance this." The two detectives then get up from their chairs and walk closer to the TV screen. Vera laments that their station is too poor to have one of those zoomer things.
-   _Columbo_:
    -   In the 1975 episode "Playback", a recorded surveillance video serves as an alibi. A frame is enhanced (off-screen) to reveal that a tiny white rectangle, at most a few video lines in size, is an invitation with clearly readable writing.
    -   In "No Time to Die", Columbo's nephew's bride is kidnapped. The cops spot the kidnapper in the background of one frame from a security camera. They're able to not only zoom in on the man's face, but also _read the writing on his class ring._
-   Averted in _Common Law_: The detectives have a picture of a suspect driving a truck, but it is too low quality to tell them who the man is. They call in a police sketch artist and have him draw a composite sketch of the suspect based on the features they can see. It's a very generic likeness, and in the end it doesn't really help their case much on its own.
-   _Community_ plays with the trope:
    -   In one episode, Pierce and one of his elderly friends appear to be playing the trope straight on the computer — only for the camera to zoom in and reveal that they're just trying to make the browser text big enough for them to read.
    -   "Basic Lupine Urology" is a Parody Episode riffing on _Law & Order_, so of course this is subverted. Britta seems like she is about to enhance a photo, then instead just shows off her ability to use a sepia filter.
        
        **Britta:** I transferred, or "downloaded," Todd's photo to this computer, and as you'll see, with a few adjustments I can make the entire image... _\[taps clumsily on keyboard\]_ old-west color. _\[Everyone is unimpressed.\]_ I don't know, I thought it was cool.
        
-   Since _Criminal Minds_ focuses on criminal behavior, they usually skim over the collection of physical evidence. By the time the audience sees the picture, it's already been "enhanced", so maybe the sources are just incredibly clear. But in one episode, the unsub sent the team pictures he'd taken of them. They zoom in on Blake's sunglasses and get a crystal-clear reflection of the unsub, despite sunglasses lens being curved, the unsub being at a distance, at an angle, through a chain-link fence. The worst part: all they see is his camera, gloved hands, and the window of the car he's sitting in. They don't even get anything useful out of the miraculously enhanced picture.
-   The Enhance Button is a staple of the _CSI_ franchise, particularly the New York and Miami versions.
    -   All three CSI shows use the Enhance Button to construct a recognizable image from the reflection in someone's _eye_. It being dark and the footage being from a grainy CCTV camera just makes it worse.
        -   One _CSI_ episode resorts to an eye reflection after being _unable_ to enhance the photographer's partial fingerprint over the camera lens (enhance it enough for anything useful, at least). The subject's eye doesn't contain enough to identify the photographer, but they can make out a porthole, keying the team into checking which of their suspects owns a boat.
    -   One _CSI_ episode uses the Button to obtain a recognizable image of the person behind the camera, by looking at the reflection of someone's sunglasses in the window of a car — a _double_ reflection.
    -   Another _CSI_ episode uses a 3D crime scene scanner in this manner. Such devices do exist, using a laser to create a 3D image of an area. However, _CSI_'s version lifts the body off the bed to look at the stains on the sheets underneath it. That's the equivalent of taking a photo of a guy, "stripping away" the skin and muscles, and looking at what _color_ the guy's bones are.
    -   One _CSI: NY_ episode uses the Button to get a positive fingerprint ID — after the suspect waves his hand in front of the camera lens.
-   Subverted in _Due South_ when the detectives are trying to identify a suspect in the crowd of a hockey game from the TV broadcast. One asks about zooming in on his face, and the TV owner helpfully explains the resolution problem (while namedropping _Blow Up_ and _Blow Out_, which are built around this trope). But the detectives can still work out his _seat number_, as they suspect he's a season ticket holder. Then they show the footage to an elderly deaf lady, who gives her best guess at lip-reading what he might be shouting.
-   In _Early Edition_, the characters want to enhance a thirty-year-old photograph which shows a potential presidential assassin. For plot reasons, this takes several hours. When it's done, it's clearly someone they're helping. But just to hammer this home, one of them says, "Can you age that by thirty years?" A few keys are pressed, and the people in the picture age _instantly_.
-   _Elementary_ has a low-tech version: Sherlock takes a remarkable number of photos of his suspect as a very long train passes by, and then prints them and cuts out all the little slivers of face, until he has a reasonably good idea what his suspect looks like.
-   In _Family Matters_, Steve is testifying in a trial and points out that the security camera footage showing the defendant robbing a jewelry store may have been altered. He proves it by replacing the defendant's face with the judge's. Then he uses the Button to show the perp forgot to edit his face out of a mirror in the store. It turns out to be the bailiff. Justified in that Steve is a Mad Scientist who often does impossible things like this.
-   Averted in _Fargo_: The cops have security footage of Lorne Malvo, but it's too low quality to make a positive identification. When Gus arrests Malvo, Malvo is able to convince the other cops that it's just a case of mistaken identity.
-   In the pilot episode of _Farscape_, the protagonist is blasted into deep space, positioned perfectly to deflect an interstellar fighter into an asteroid, killing the pilot. This pilot turns out to be the brother of a fleet commander, who upon viewing the footage of his brother's demise demands that his crew "peel the image". This process takes some time, but it produces a crystal-clear likeness of the main character, and the interior of his spacecraft, right through the canopy.
-   In Chapter Eight of _The Firm_, Ray McDeere enlists a "hacker" to help him enhance a man's reflection in a car window to get a high-quality image of the tattoo on the back of his neck. "And if I just enhance this area..."
-   _The Flash (2014)_: In the Christmas Episode "Running to Stand Still", both Team Flash at S.T.A.R. Labs and Patty at Central City Police Station are able to zoom and enhance a video the Trickster broadcast across Central City to see a reflection of a teddy bear in his eye, cluing them in on his location. Given that when The Flash and Patty arrive at the location, the Trickster has prepared a trap for them, it looks like he planned for them to do this.
-   Double subverted in the _FlashForward (2009)_ pilot. The FBI finds footage of someone who might have stayed awake during the visions, but when they try to enhance his face, it's just as blocky and pixelated as before. But they give it to the NSA, who finds a ring on the man's finger they "enhance" to the point that they can identify the specific ring. It might have been because it's a lot easier to extrapolate the shape of a simple object like a ring than a human face.
-   In the _Flashpoint_ episode "Severed Ties", the tech guy is able to take a photograph with a blurred girl in the background and sharpen the image of the girl, while blurring the rest of the image, with the touch of a button. It's as if he's just changing the focus on the original camera. There's real technology that can do that, but it requires a special camera.
-   In Cinemax's After Dark show _Forbidden Science_, a character uses "Zoom and Enhance" to view a document held in another character's hands.
-   Zig-zagged in _Fringe_:
    -   In "The Bishop Revival", Olivia sees a suspicious character in a wedding video and asks Astrid if she can enhance it. The image Astrid produces is enlarged and very grainy. She says, "That's the best I can do."
    -   In one episode, CCTV footage is "enhanced" and slowed down to show a bullet moving slowly across the screen (and being caught by an Observer). This would require a camera filming at several thousand frames per second, which a cheap CCTV camera probably isn't going to do. A season 4 episode shows the same technique to reveal an Observer moving too quickly for the eye to otherwise detect, with plenty of frames still left over.
-   The "magic zoom" is used very frequently in _F/X: The Series_. They justify it by claiming it's "fractal enhancement", and that they're analyzing high-quality film from movie shoots, so they have multiple high-quality frames from which to get pixels.
-   _House_'s Enhance Button dances on the brink of absurdity. The gang is trying to interpret a heart scan, but they can't make out any detail on the small computer (and say "the pixels are the size of Legos"). They move the footage to bigger and bigger screens before projecting the footage in the hospital's cinema, which solves the problem but creates a different one (ignoring that if the problem was blocky pixels, the pixels should have gone from being Lego bricks to house bricks) — why is it so difficult to look at routine medical diagnostic images on regular hospital equipment?

-   Subverted in the British show _KYVT_: In the murder special, the characters examine some CCTV footage and attempt to zoom in, only for the enhanced version to be even worse than the original.
-   _Las Vegas_ takes the Enhance Button further than likely any other show on this list. Surveillance is built into the premise — as noted in the pilot, Las Vegas has more surveillance cameras per capita than any other city in the world, and the characters use them to solve crimes in their casino. But nearly every episode involves them zooming in to identify individuals from at least twenty feet away and using absurdly sophisticated facial recognition software (for a casino, at least). For example:
    -   In "Can You See What I See?", Mike uses camera footage from two different convenience stores to create a composite image of Ed driving through a green light (and not the red one he was given a ticket for). Among other things, he straightens a diagonal image and uses the reflection on a TV to zoom in on the Stratosphere Tower more than five miles away. And he goes to obscene effort just to get his hands on the footage (even getting a job at the place that had one of the tapes). In the end, Ed shows it to a judge he knows, who notices that he wasn't wearing a seat belt.
    -   In "Two of a Kind" (a crossover with _Crossing Jordan_), the boys use four separate photos of a crime in progress to end up with a perfect 3D simulation of the room, revealing the face of a female culprit which wasn't anywhere in the recorded material. There's a slight Hand Wave that the computer "extrapolated" the new information from what they already had, but it's not shown how it did so.
    -   In "To Protect and Serve Manicotti", they start with CCTV footage of a guy's head shoved onto a restaurant counter by Sylvester Stallone's recurring character, with his hand concealing nearly all of the man's face. They then remove the hand, fill in the missing features, do the same to the other half of the guy's face, and end up with a complete 3D rendering of the guy's head by pure guesswork.
    -   In "Shrink Rap", Mike holds a special filter up to an image of cards on the screen, revealing the markings in invisible dye which a cheater has been applying to them. The only problem is that the screen shouldn't be capable of displaying anything outside the human-visible spectrum of colors.
-   Every show in the _Law & Order_ franchise has used the Button to some degree. In the original _Law & Order_, the Button has been used to:
    -   Enhance a Home Porn Movie to reveal the victim's tattoo;
    -   Enhance CCTV footage to reveal a decal in a car's window, showing which rental agency it's from;
    -   Enhance footage of a restaurant party, zooming in on a blurry image to reveal the restaurant's logo on the waiter's jacket (although this time, the logo is no less blurry; the techie just happens to recognize the logo);
    -   Remove a man's voice from a phone call, identify the vague noise in the background as water lapping against a boat, and from that identify the _type_ of boat;
    -   Identify a blurry image on a man's hat, which was previously out of frame; Logan asked the tech to "push it up a few frames."
    -   Subverted in an episode of _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_: The defendant (played by Robin Williams) is caught on a security camera, and the enhanced image showing his face is presented as evidence. The defendant, representing himself, shows the jury the original image, which is just of a blur wearing a baseball cap, and then cross-examines the enhancement guy and gets him to admit that the image of his face was, in essence, little more than guesswork on the part of the computer. The jury returns an acquittal.
        
        _"I don't care how sophisticated your software is — a guess is not the truth."_
        
-   _Lie to Me_ pulls this one a lot, when Cal needs to analyze a subject's body language but can't without some magical image-enhancing technology which can zoom in to see how much their pupils are dilating. Heck, even Cal himself has eyesight with optical zoom that helps him see pupil dilation like an eagle, if he is right there with the subject.
-   In _The Lost Room_, Jennifer Bloom "enhances" fifty-year-old footage of the Conroy Experiment and finds the Occupant's face in the midst of the chaos. Not only does this not make any sense plot-wise (the Occupant was miles away in a sanitarium at the time), but that piece of information doesn't even change anything. Even more annoyingly, the sequence wasn't in the original script to begin with; they added it during filming.
-   In one episode of _MacGyver (1985)_, this was coupled with some superficially realistic-sounding Techno Babble: "Create a bitmap. Now increase the Z-axis while holding the X and Y axis steady." While this sounds ludicrous, it's basically the 1980's equivalent of getting a high resolution image file from a film negative and using the zoom function on your computer.
-   In the _Major Crimes_ episode "Long Shot", a blurry shot of a license plate on a suspect's car actually sees their computer guy offer a few hours of "pixel magic" that will "maybe" turn something up; it does.
-   _Midsomer Murders_ usually avoids this trope, but in "Days of Misrule", WPC Stephens is able to enhance a photo from a speed camera to reveal a crucial piece of evidence in the rear window.
-   The original 1966 version of _Mission: Impossible_ has an Enhance Button without a computer. In "The Bank", Barney pauses a recording of a bank vault on a black-and-white CRT screen, and Jim Phelps uses a _pocket telescope_ to zoom in on the screen and read the number of a safe-deposit box.
-   Averted and parodied in the _Monk_ episode "Mr. Monk and the Birds and the Bees". Stottlemeyer and Disher look at a surveillance tape of their suspect and try to enhance it, but it's still too blurry to make out who the people are. Stottlemeyer sarcastically suggests that the blurs could be Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers (Randy informs him that Ginger Rogers has been dead for years). Randy then points out the blurs on the screen, by circling them with a permanent marker.
-   In _Mystery Diners_, the Enhance Button is used repeatedly in the Anchor Bar (S10/10) episode. Surveillance footage taken outdoors at three in the morning in murky green light — which was blurry even at normal magnification _and_ taken in the dark - is blown up to reveal the unidentified suspect has a large tattoo on his forearm. This appears as a big undifferentiated dark smear. Charles orders the pixelation to be cleaned up. Miraculously, a clearly detailed and identifiable tattoo of a dragon is revealed. This is used later to identify a suspect.
-   _NCIS_ goes back and forth on the Button. Perky Goth technician Abby sometimes tries to explain that she can't enhance the photo, but her boss doesn't understand the tech and just expects her to work her magic. And sometimes, it is magic, like when she enhances a blurry reflection in a car door to reveal that the person's hand is missing a couple of fingers, or when she enhances CCTV camera footage from a hundred feet above a carrier deck to see a _pill_ lying on the ground.
-   Played for Laughs in the Belgian show _Neveneffecten_: When asked to enhance a blurry screen, the computer technician remarks that he normally can't, but they sometimes make exceptions for TV shows.
-   Parodied in _NTSF:SD:SUV::_, where the Enhance Button is so powerful, they can even search through the pockets of the person in the picture.
-   A first season episode of _NUMB3RS_ deconstructs this trope. Charlie and Amita use a program that allows them to "zoom in" on a poor-resolution image, but they also make a point to explain that what they're seeing isn't _actually_ information contained in the original image (in fact, Amita explicitly shows them that just magnifying the image accomplishes nothing because "the information's just not there"), but rather a predictive tool that extrapolates from the existing data to fill in the missing information as best it can.
-   _Person of Interest_:
    -   In one episode, Finch tries to enhance a camera phone video, but can only turn a small blurry face into a larger blurry face. He does manage to work out a rough description of some distinguishing features from the enhanced image, and he uses a different program to identify possibly suspects who have said features.
    -   In "God Mode", Reese is shooting at a bunch of attacking mooks with guidance from the Machine. The Machine gives a perspective straight out of _Enemy of the State_, allowing the viewer to rotate the image — except it already has the building's blueprints, and the human characters are flat and poorly rendered.
-   In the _Pretty Little Liars_ episode "A Kiss Before Lying" (Season 2, Episode 18), Caleb is in the process of decrypting a video found on A's cell phone, when he shows Aria, Spencer, and Emily a frame they previously hadn't seen. After catching a glimpse of a blurry driver's license on the ground, Caleb proceeds to zoom into the frame twice, enhancing and showing the girls a very clear photo of Alison's second fake ID.
-   _The Professionals_ has The '70s' equivalent in "Involvement". Bodie and Cowley are using a slide projector to go over some surveillance photos. Cowley sees someone lurking in the background of a shot and has Bodie adjust the projector lens to blow up the image. It helps in this case that the lurker turns out to be Doyle, so he's easily recognised.
-   In one episode of _Profiler_, they're trying to figure out how a mole is leaking information from inside the FBI. One theory is that he's giving out security camera footage, but they point out that the cameras specifically don't have an Enhance Button precisely to prevent anyone from reading confidential information from the footage. It turns out that the mole affixed a cleverly-hidden telescoping device to the security camera.
-   The _Red Dwarf_ three-parter "Back to Earth" has a ridiculous parody of the phenomenon (part of an episode-long pastiche of _Blade Runner_). The _first_ command is to "uncrop", and it gets crazier from there. To see the other side of a business card, they enhance several different reflections (one from the metallic "H" in Rimmer's skull, and the rest from very distant objects, one of which is a faucet in someone's bathroom) before getting a clear image of the back of a guy who was not even in the original image. Then when they read the address on the back of the business card, Kryten asks if it would have been easier just to look him up in the phone book.
-   In the _Rizzoli & Isles_ episode "I'm Your Boogie Man", Maura uses an enhance button which is apparently sophisticated enough to expand an image caught by a webcam reflected off of a person's eyeball.
-   Averted in an episode of _Rookie Blue_ when Epstein is asked to do this to find out who shot a man dressed as a chicken (It Makes Sense in Context) and answers that this isn't actually a thing.
-   In _The Sarah Jane Adventures_, Sky asks Mr. Smith to move back a tenth of a frame to find a glitch in a holographic celebrity. This assumes that a "frame" is a measurement of time, which it isn't; it's just one of the many images that make up a video. You can only move back one frame at a time, and if the glitch happened between frames, you're out of luck.
-   Parodied in _The Sarah Silverman Program_: Sarah spots a curious detail in the background of a photo. Despite being the only person in the room, she tells no one in particular to "enhance to 125 percent". She then pulls out a magnifying glass and looks dramatically at the image. When that's not enough, she calls for another 50% and pulls out an even smaller magnifying glass. The process is punctuated with dramatic camera work and high-tech sound effects like a _CSI_ enhancing sequence, but the image it reveals is exactly what you would expect if you looked at a photo with a magnifying glass — i.e., just bigger and blurrier. Despite this, Sarah declares the image proof of... something (the viewer never quite finds out what).
-   One episode of _Sliders_ can't seem to make up its mind. They use the Button to zoom in and enhance the reflection on a champagne glass to see a matchbook and identify the hotel printed on it. They wanted to show that this was a special image, but rather than just say it's very high-res, they give the following nonsensical Techno Babble:
    
    _"Of course, it depends on if it's a rasterized image or not. I mean, if it's a bitmap like a TIFF, then it'll get dotty if we blow it."  
    "Yeah, right, but if it's a JPEG, it depends on how lossy it is."  
    "We are in luck — it's rasterized. We can make this thing into a billboard and never lose res."_
    
-   In _Smallville_, Jimmy and Lois use the Enhance Button on a photo to reveal that Lex killed his father. But the computer at the _Daily Planet_ isn't "powerful enough" to do the enhancing, and they didn't think to make more than a single copy.
-   _Spooks_ goes back and forth on this. One episode shows MI 5 taking an image captured by a spy satellite, "enhancing" it, and rotating it to see the face of one person and the _shape of his sunglasses_.
-   The _Stargate SG-1_ episode "Endgame" uses the Button to enhance the image of a camera pointed at the Stargate and identify the person who left a tracking device on the gate. Presumably, they could achieve the same result more realistically if they cobbled together security footage from multiple cameras (plausible for such a high-security complex), but it was faster this way.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
    -   "Duet" has a possible war criminal apprehended by the crew. After finding that the only known picture of him is blurry and small, they enhance it to perfect clarity and zoom in on different faces. (Like the _Blade Runner_ example, this may be because they have magical future technology.) It's also downplayed, since at first it just does a realistic low-resolution zoom on the face; when Sisko complains, Dax tells him that the computer is still processing.
    -   In another episode, Sisko recovers a painting of an ancient obelisk containing markings on all sides. Naturally, only the forward-facing markings are visible in the painting, but Sisko needs to see all of them. He notices a waterfall behind the obelisk and uses his computer to reconstruct the markings from the waterfall's reflections. Except this is a _painting_, and this can only work if the original painter was incredibly anal about the reflections. Perhaps A Wizard Did It — the people who made the obelisk might have anticipated the need for this in the future, given their near-inability to think of time as a straight line.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
    -   In "The Vengeance Factor", the crew finds a picture of someone with their face half hidden, and they're able to reconstruct the person's entire face, implicating her as the episode's villain.
    -   In "Identity Crisis", Geordi asks the computer to isolate and enhance a quadrant of footage to show a sliver of a shadow, transfer the scene to the Holodeck, then remove the characters who were obscuring the shadow, before extrapolating the general 3D volume of the shadow-casting object. Justified in that Geordi is shown to be _really_ reaching in his attempt to find even a possible answer; the computer initially tells him there simply isn't enough data to tell him what he wants to know, so he plugs in what's essentially a guess for one of the missing parameters so that the computer will have enough data to make an estimate on the rest. Even then, what he gets is basically just the 3-d equivalent of a silhouette — an approximate position and rough shape, but no features or details.
        
        **Geordi:** All right, let's say that my friend and I here are about the same size, say 1.7 meters. _Now_ can you extrapolate its shape and its position?  
        _\[an object appears... just in time for Geordi to start metamorphosing into a creature just like it\]_
        
    -   "Unification, Part 1" starts with a Starfleet admiral enhancing an image and discovering that Ambassador Spock was on Romulus. The camera that took this image was in another star system and picked him out of a crowd. Future tech indeed!
-   Inverted in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "The Corbomite Maneuver" when the crew is looking at an image of a Big Dumb Object, and they can't see the entire thing unless they zoom _out_. But for this to work implies the same principles that power the garden-variety Enhance Button. One can assume from this scene that the ship's forward-facing cameras must normally be tightly zoomed-in, and they simply reduced the magnification back towards a more normal view.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Seems like every other episode the ship receives some kind of garbled transmission. All it takes is Harry or Seven to announce "Compensating!" and run a few filters, and the message becomes perfectly understandable, if not always crystal clear.
-   Used frequently in _Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye_:
    -   In multiple episodes, they enhance people's mouths in grainy surveillance footage so Sue, a deaf lip reader, can tell what they're saying.
    -   In "Assassins", Jack and Bobby tell a Stupid Crook that they can identify him by digitally removing his ski mask from the surveillance photos. He believes them and confesses.
    -   In "The Leak", Tara tries to find clues about a terrorist's location based on a video he sent a news station. She enhances a barely visible spot of color behind a white curtain and comes up with a brightly-colored, easily readable neon sign for a diner.
    -   In "The Mentor", Tara finds a clear reflection in the pupil of a man in a photograph.
    -   In "Spy Games", Tara enhances and rotates images of suspects' heads to identify them by their ears.
-   In the _Supernatural_ episode "Devil May Care", Sam zooms in on a grainy figure in a security video being played on a touchscreen tablet to reveal a clear image of Abaddon.
-   Subverted in _Take Two_. Samantha, an actress who spent years playing a cop on TV, is now working with private eye Eddie. In the pilot, they watch a video with Eddie giving Sam a This Is Reality moment.
    
    **Eddie:** You can't enhance video resolution. That's scientifically impossible.  
    **Sam:** We did it all the time on the show.  
    **Eddie:** And every time, it was moronic.
    
-   The pilot of _Threat Matrix_ shows Homeland Security examining a traffic camera footage, removing a man from the image, and revealing the briefcase the criminal was holding.
-   Averted in the _Torchwood_ episode "Day One"; Toshiko is trying to match a CCTV image to a database, but the CCTV image is "too low-res", and that's that.
-   Taken to an absurd extreme in _V (2009)_. The Visitors are able to analyze footage of an explosion caught by a fairly standard surveillance camera _outside_ of a building and reconstruct not only the specific explosives used, but even a _fingerprint_ supposedly left on one of the explosives _inside_ the building. Justified to the extent that the results were actually fake, but absolutely _no one_ from Earth who did not already know better questioned the viability of the method — or even asked how it could possibly work. Without context, a viewer could easily mistake the scene for parody.
-   Averted in the Krister Henriksson _Wallander_ episode "Blodsband": Wallander asks Nyberg if he would be able to enhance some surveillance footage and is told that that wouldn't improve anything.
-   In the episode "The Night of the Hangman" of _The Wild Wild West_, Artemus Gordon uses a projector to do this with photograph. While searching for clues he is able to easily zoom and pan across the image despite the series being set in the 1870s. The concept is even made fun of as the critical clue (a large balloon) is not visible in the part of the image he has zoomed into.
-   In _The Wire_, Roland Pryzbylewski uses his Enhance Button to reveal a photo of a license plate. It's not so much about the enhancing as it is about his very openly showing off his ability to do that:
    
    **Daniels:** Sometimes you still scare me, you know that?
    
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   Averted in "Shadows", when Scully comments that a blurry photograph on a computer monitor can't be enhanced because the resolution is too poor.
    -   In "Ascension", a thumb-sized section of a still from a cop-car surveillance camera is enhanced to reveal a crystal-clear image of a central character, giving the police a chance to save her. Even more incredibly, the footage doesn't otherwise relate to Mulder's case at all, and he was watching it by random chance.
    -   "The Calusari" has the first appearance of Dr. Charles Burk, the FBI's resident digital imaging expert, and creator of a special photo enhancement software. He and Mulder use it to identify photon distortion caused by an "electromagnetic cloud" which is supernaturally luring a child into the path of an oncoming train.
    -   In one episode, the magic software takes a photo of white noise with a vague blur, removes all the white pixels, and inexplicably leaves an image showing a vital clue. Then again, the image was placed there by a ghost, so maybe the normal rules don't apply.
    -   In "Rush", the Button colorizes black-and-white security camera footage, allowing Mulder to identify a blur on the frame as a school's letter jacket — even though the blur was on screen for exactly one frame (i.e., 1/30th of a second).

    Music 

-   Parodied in the They Might Be Giants song "Unpronounceable":
    
    _Zoom and enhance  
    If that were even a real thing  
    Which it isn't_
    

    Podcasts 

-   In _Wolverine: The Long Night_, Marshall examines a dark image, so he zooms in and presses "clarify" to see the license plate number.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   In the 2002 WWE Raw, Shawn Michaels was brutally attacked in his car in a parking lot, and Triple H declared repeatedly that he would hunt down the attacker. However, Michaels appeared on the TitanTron with a video that he enhanced and "cleaned up" to reveal that the attacker was in fact Triple H himself. This led to a long on-camera rivalry between the two.
-   In 2018, NXT wrestler Aleister Black was attacked in the Full Sail parking lot, and general manager William Regal commanded a thorough investigation to find the culprit. Surveillance footage of the incident was released, revealing that there was a witness standing on top of a building. The footage, despite being extremely dark and blurry, was indicative enough that Nikki Cross was the witness, and revealed that she indeed saw who the culprit was.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Cyberpunk 2020_, one cyberoptics option will enhance an image and give you a bonus to Advert/Notice checks. It's the only such option that will give you a bonus.

    Video Games 

-   Played rather conservatively in _Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere_: During a video analysis of the test flight of X-49 Night Raven, the characters pause the camera footage, zoom in on the pilot's face, and manipulate the contrast to reveal the face behind the visor. Weirdly, the investigator can't get a good enough look at the pilot's face until the photo is printed out.
-   In _Batman: The Telltale Series_, Batman notices a reflection on the glasses of a hostage in a ransom video, and instructs the Batcomputer to extrapolate a 3D virtual-reality recreation of the room from it, which is detailed enough to include readable text on the label of the water heater across the room and the bus stop sign outside the window.
-   In the intro video to _Battlezone II: Combat Commander_, Voyager 2 first appears to have an Enhance Button, scanning the Dark Planet and repeatedly zooming in on small sections of each scan. However, in the final scan, the light source it is observing is noticeably pixellated, though still detailed enough for Voyager to detect the light from a missile launch, whereupon Voyager enters combat mode.
-   The video game _Blade Runner_ requires you to perform the same Enhance Button sequence that famously happens in the movie. Fortunately, it's actually pretty cool to do it, and at least it's future tech.
-   Deconstructed in _Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun_ in Nod's introduction to Umagon. Slavik and Oxanna are examining recently-recorded footage, cutting, turning, zooming in, and finally ordering CABAL to extrapolate missing data to remove shadows. The resulting image is grainy except for the extrapolated parts, which are uncharacteristically smooth (and lack the Tiberium infestation later seen on the real Umagon). It does clue Oxanna in to the fact that the woman is a mutant, but not who she is. We later find out that CABAL's massive computing power comes from its being powered by human brains.
-   _Cyberpunk 2077_ has its own high tech version with the "Braindance editor". Semi-Justified in that you only get what the recorder's cyberware enhancements picked up, but you can still move around in it to view different angles, and get data the recorder didn't notice, and even download whole files when the recorder only saw a single screenshot.
-   In _Love & Pies_, Yuka runs the photo of Amelia's mom, Freya, working with Benny Benson and a mysterious silhouetted figure through several apps, revealing the figure's identity: Sebastian Corps.
-   In the non-Titanium version of _MechWarrior 2_, "Image Enhancement" will blacken the screen and display everything as wire frame models — which does have the benefit of at least displaying the status of the enemy Mech's body parts.
-   _Tales from the Borderlands_:
    -   Parodied in episode 2, when Sasha tries to "enhance" the map of the Gortys Project by shouting "Enhance!" at the computer. You can get Fiona to join in, but eventually Vaughn will shut Sasha up and explain that computers don't work that way.
    -   Played straight in episode 4, where Rhys is able to enhance a holographic map of Helios projected from his cybernetic arm. Sasha's a bit annoyed that it works for him.
-   Parodied in _Tales of Monkey Island_ Chapter 1, where Guybrush uses an analog optical telescope as an Enhance Button. He asks his first mate Winslow to "enhance the upper right quadrant" – Winslow just turns the telescope to increase the zoom. Guybrush then asks for "full enhancement", and Winslow holds up a _second_ telescope at the end of the first one.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   In _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_, Edgeworth takes the security camera footage of the murder and uses the Button to zoom in on a car parked outside the building, showing that the one who ordere the murder was in the car — because he could see the reflection of his medal in the window on the opposite side of the car to the one facing the building.
    -   In _Gyakuten Kenji 2_, the Button in a video analyzing machine Gumshoe calls "Mr. Analysis", and it's used twice. First, they look at footage of an apparent dog attack, zoom in on a mirror, and identify the victim as a police officer by his uniform actually a disguiced prisoner trying to escape and his mud-covered pet bear jumping on him . The second time, they zoom in _between_ a set of shut window blinds to see what's going on behind them.
    -   Downplayed in Case 4 of _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_, where a photo is "blown up" but the faces aren't any more visible; fortunately, it becomes vital evidence for a different reason. In addition, the photo in question is a film photo, and the blown-up image was made by creating a totally new digital photo from the negative rather than zooming into an existing photo.
-   In _Virtue's Last Reward_, Phi and Sigma are checking out the security footage from the cabin where Luna and Alice's bodies was found. During a part where K is looking at his bracelet, they zoom in on the bracelet to see that it's says "00:21", meaning it's about a minute before K met up with the two of them in the Floor B Warehouse, which gave them the basis for the timeline of the events on the footage.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Although to be fair, it is 2028. And to be even more fair, it's _actually_ 2074, as the game eventually reveals.

    Webcomics 

-   Parodied in this _Bug_ comic:
    
    "Hey! Less whining, more enhancing."
    
-   Invoked outright in this _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_ comic, where the technician _deliberately_ keeps his camera at the lowest resolution available just so he can technically do this.
    
    _Setting all the security cameras to display extremely low resolution has made it much easier to impress my boss._
    
-   Parodied in _Bitmap World_ issue 38: Harry is watching a movie where the characters enhance a picture so much that the suspect's DNA is visible.
    
    **Harry:** This movie is stupid!
    
-   _El Goonish Shive_ averts this trope, and parody's _CSI_'s usage of it in this comic's commentary:
    
    _Of course, if this was_ CSI_, some dude would magically multiply the resolution of the image, clean it up, and get the license plate of a nearby car from a reflection in Elliot's pupil._
    
-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_ plays the trope deadpan straight in this comic, but then lampshades it in the commentary after.
-   Parodied by _Nedroid_ in Crime Lab. Luckily, the killer's face just happens to be a 4x4 block of pixels and compression artifacts.
-   Parodied in _Paranatural_: What the Vice Principal claims is the enhanced image is actually the image crudely redrawn in MS Paint to be more offensive.
-   Played with in _Shortpacked!_: Batman has an image enhanced more and more to see the culprit's face, to the point of zooming on a spoon a passerby just happens to be holding at the right angle — only to realize that everybody's face looks the same anyway.
-   In _The Way of the Metagamer_, Joel Robinson invents a justified version of this trope.

    Web Original 

-   Parodied in Henry & Aaron's ABC2 Christmas Special, where they clear up and zoom in on white noise in the background of some video footage and get an incredible sharp image of the villain.
-   Subverted by SCP-191, as seen here, as it is explicitly stated that SCP-191 "had to guess" as to the missing data. The images produced in another impossible CSI-like process, however, while still being inaccurate, were very convincing to someone unfamiliar with the location depicted.
-   CinemaSins calls it the "Zoom and enhance cliche" and it's an automatic sin.
-   Mocked in the pseudo-documentary of _A Shoggoth on the Roof_: One investigator watches an old Super-8 film of a performance over and over again. He notices a strange figure standing in the background whom no one really pays attention to ("Maybe he was the writer?"). He asks a technical person: "Can we enhance this photo to get a better image of this man's face?" She laughs, then tells him they can't. He sighs and then asks if they can just take a really good freeze-frame.
-   Parodied on _JonTron_ when he's ripping on _Dan Aykroyd's_ Crystal Skull vodka and is watching a video of Mr. Aykroyd discuss his interest in the occult and supernatural while showing stock images of ghosts and alien spaceships. Jon decides to enhance an image of a Black Triangle U.F.O, pulls out an elaborate console with settings to magnify and enhance, and the image turns into a video of a chubby Asian man giggling furiously in front of a plate of food. Naturally this passes without mention.
-   _LoadingReadyRun_ mocked this phenomenon in their CSI parody. A lab tech uses a new software package to restore a security tape that was wiped with a magnet. However, the culprit is facing away from the camera, so he zooms in on the toaster and enhances the pixels, creating a crystal-clear picture of the toaster, but with no reflection. He runs a filter to find the reflection, extrapolates it into a full photograph, flips it, and zooms in a second time to get an image of the perp's name tag.
-   Many customers on _Not Always Right_ seem to expect photo studios to be able to do this kind of thing:
    
    "All you do is click the fix button and it's done in five seconds."  
    "Crop this guy out so I can see what's behind him."  
    _\[Showing a photo of a house\]_ "Rotate 180 degrees, so I can see the back of the house."  
    "Please remove this cow so I can see the face of my ancestor!"  
    _\[Showing a photo of someone with his back to the camera\]_ "We need to see this person's face. You need to turn the person around 180 degrees."  
    "I have these photos of a masquerade ball. I need you to Photoshop the masks off."
    
-   _OverSimplified_: Parodied in the "Pig War" video after the line between British and US territories has been finalized, the narrator is informed of a discrepency and orders a zoom in on the line between Oregon Territory and British holdings followed by an enhance. He actually enhances it too much and winds up with an image of James Douglas on the latrine.
-   A running gag in _CollegeHumor_'s _Kingpin Katie_ series is people saying "Computer: Enhance" as they perform completely normal functions like zooming in on a picture on their smartphone or entering something into a web search.
-   Kassem Gharaibei made a short called "Crime Cops" that revolves around amping up the ludicrousness of every single cliche involved in this concept. A team of two detectives and two editing experts are tasked with investigating a robbery, and the only photographic evidence available is a low-resolution picture taken on a "Suzy Superstar" camera _that's facing the opposite direction **of a room with closed window shades.**_ So how do they manage to solve it? By zooming into _the reflection of a car window_, then into the window itself, and finally applying a variety of absurd filters in an effort to brighten the final image enough to reveal the true culprit.
    
    **Brisby:** Wait a minute...Gitch, you've been programming a bit-nine candelabra vex filter. Is it ready?  
    **Gitch:** It's not fully coded, I don't have the pixel-  
    **Gutiérrez** Apply it...it's okay...do it.  
    **Gitch:**...okay...applying bit-nine candelabra...and execute.  
    _\[A superimposed clip-art candelabra magically cleans up the image quality.\]_  
    **Gutiérrez** _\[Smirking\]_ And liftoff.
    

    Western Animation 

-   Defied hilariously in _Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales_. C-3PO is hunting down R2-D2 and finds a video of him getting put into a shuttle. He asks a droid to magnify the picture and is told constantly that he can't. Annoyed, the droid ends up grabbing Threepio and slamming his face closer to the screen.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_ frequently uses the enhance button. In one episode, Batman is trying to identify who robbed the safe at a boxing match and asks his Magical Computer to play the security footage in super slow motion. Then he zooms in on a thug's tattoo (visibly only for a couple of frames) and enhances it so well, he can match it up with his Facial Recognition Software and identify the thief.
-   The cartoon version of _Battletech_ uses a variation of this: The enemy mechs (and later the good guys) are equipped with a system called Enhanced Imaging, ostensibly to aid in combat by making the situation clearer. What this in fact does in terms of the show's effects is turn detailed traditional animation into untextured 3D models.
-   Lampshaded in an episode of _Ben 10 (2016)_, where Ben asks his cousin Gwen to do this when he notices that the movie footage they've been recording on her phone might have clues to where the episode's villains went. She skeptically does so and is surprised that it works, staring at her fingers in awe.
-   In _The Cleveland Show_, Cleveland Junior is able to zoom and enhance a YouTube video.
-   Parodied in _Clone High_: Abe Lincoln watches a videotape and, upon seeing something of interest, rewinds it and tells _the VCR_ to zoom and enhance the image. It does so dutifully.
-   In the second episode of _Detentionaire_, Lee manages to enhance a blurry photo of someone's hand so much that he can see details like a class ring and a scab.
-   In an episode of _DuckTales (1987)_, the nephews are able to clearly identify a culprit on a surveillance tape by holding a magnifying glass up to their TV screen.
-   One episode of _DuckTales (2017)_ has Huey trying to act as a detective. He repeatedly demands someone to "enhance" a smartphone picture he's looking at, which prompts Dewey to simply pinch with his fingers to zoom it in on something in the background. Huey treats this as a standard Enhance Button.
-   Parodied in the _Futurama_ episode "In-a-Gadda-da-Leela", where Zapp Brannigan asks for a section of the screen to be magnified:
    
    **Zapp:** Why's it still blurry?!  
    **Kif:** That's all the resolution we have. Making it bigger doesn't make it clearer.  
    **Zapp:** It does on _CSI: Miami_!
    
-   _Gargoyles_ does this a few times, with Elisa Maza (an NYPD detective) zooming in on security camera footage to identify suspects.
-   Parodied in _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_: While looking through security footage, Phil modifies the image:
    
    **Phil:** Hello, and who do we have here? Enhance! Contrast! Tint! Bright! Sleep mode! Vertical hold!
    
-   Justified in the _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_ episode "Angel", where the camera in question was invented by a Mad Scientist and was said to take pictures at an insanely high resolution.
-   Parodied often on _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "24 Minutes", an episode-long spoof of _24_, Principal Skinner orders Lisa to enhance a photo of a message carved into a classroom desk. It turns out to be a slur directed at him, causing him to shout, "De-hance! De-hance!"
    -   Bart is going through the school newspaper archives and sees an old picture. He tells Lisa, reading over his shoulder, to "zoom in and enhance!" Lisa responds by grabbing the back of Bart's head and shoving his face closer to the screen.
    -   In "The D'oh-cial Network", Patty and Selma show Lisa their profile picture on SpringFace — a picture of two hot blondes. Lisa points out it's not them, to which they zoom in on the picture to show their reflections in one blonde's sunglasses.
-   Parodied in the _Space Ghost Coast to Coast_ episode "King Dead": Space Ghost tells Moltar's console to "zoom in" on a frame from a VHS ransom video. The computer zooms _way_ in until a single yellow pixel fills the entire screen as a calm computer voice says "Enhancing. Enhancing complete. Yellow... block." From this giant pixel Space Ghost somehow recognizes the interior of his own apartment.
-   In _Squidbillies_, Early is on trial for attacking baseball players during a game and is examining the evidence footage:
    
    **Early:** Zoom in! Enhance!  
    **Lawyer:** We can't do that — that's really more of a sci-fi thing.  
    **Early:** 'At's a shame. 'Cause if y'all could, you could see that my hat reads, "Gynecologist: Saturday Nights Only". 'At's funnier'n hell. I got that at a truck stop in Ellijay.
    
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: Played absolutely straight in "The Academy", in which Ahsoka Tano enhances a hologram to show the hidden face of a hooded figure — which was recorded _from behind_.
-   The first season finale of _Teen Titans_ has Slade deliver a recorded threat, then it turns out, _bank_ on the Titans being able to see something reflected in a metal surface, which Beast Boy calls "squiggly lines. Way informative." before a few keystrokes refine it into a legible sign, which (this part is realistic, if unnecessarily showy) inverts horizontally into where they need to go.
-   In the _What's New, Scooby-Doo?_ episode "Riva Ras Regas", the gang finds out that a video recording has been digitally altered, with a fake animation of falling rocks overlaid over it. Velma somehow manages to remove the rocks to reveal the original footage underneath.
-   In the _X-Men: The Animated Series_ episode "Time Fugitives: Part 1", Beast uses an Enhance Button to see what Creed used to infect himself:
    
    **Beast:** Image Scan Mode... Closer. Stop. Closer!
    

    Real Life 

Part of the belief that an Enhance Button will work derives from a misunderstanding of certain Real Life image enhancement techniques that aren't nearly as magical as TV makes them out to be. However, they can still work in certain situations:

-   It's possible to enhance old movies and TV shows to create HD versions. Good film negatives can capture amazing amounts of detail, and high-quality film was being used for such purposes as far back as the 1920s. It's just that people didn't have the equipment to display that level of detail back then, particularly not at home. The difference with the Button is that the footage always had a ton of detail; it's the screen you're viewing it on that's different. However, this only works if the movie/show was recorded directly to film: kinescopes of live TV broadcasts are stuck with the resolution of the monitor used to produce them and videotapes have a fixed resolution, which means productions preserved on those formats (including Video Inside, Film Outside productions) are unsuitable for HD remastering.
-   If you have a very high-resolution image to begin with, it is possible to do some ridiculous Enhance Button things, including distortion-correcting reflections in people's eyeballs and reconstructing a scene from the point of view of the light illuminating the scene.
-   The super-resolution technique can increase the resolution of a video by overlaying different frames where the image has shifted by fractions of a pixel — something that naturally occurs during video recording. It only works for data where the original limiting factor of detail is the resolution of the image sensor, rather than the quality and accuracy of the focus. A similar technique can reverse the effects of a Dizzy Cam so that the object of focus is always "centered".
-   Text is relatively easy to enhance, even if it's as little as three pixels tall, because there's only a finite number of possibilities as to what any given character could be. You still need some Photoshop, Javascript, and a little statistical analysis. Law enforcement has specialized software to do this, although you can also get it yourself as a Photoshop plugin.
-   Older CRT TVs have an "overscan" feature, which crops the footage slightly to fit it properly on the screen. If you fiddle with the footage, it's possible to catch something in the overscan that you couldn't before, simply by shifting the display to one side. That said, modern digital TVs don't need this, so this is rapidly disappearing as an option.
-   A deconvolution filter can fix a bad focus or motion blur to get a slightly better focus. It still can't restore any information genuinely lost by the initial defects and can't fix the focus completely.
-   It's possible to reverse certain Photoshop effects because they aren't meant to truly obscure the image; the original data is still there. INTERPOL once caught a pedophile this way; he used a simple spiral blur to hide his face, only for a simple Photoshop filter to reverse the process.
-   The compressed sensing technique uses a series of mathematical tricks to take a fuzzy, corrupted image, pull out a random sample of 10% of the pixels, and make a much sharper image.
-   Vector graphic images (like SVG images) can be enhanced indefinitely, as they're defined not as a series of pixels arranged a certain way, but rather shapes and lines drawn relative to each other. This is most often used for things like diagrams, though, rather than security camera footage. There exists vectorizer software that converts line art in bitmap formats into a vector format, gaining all its benefits, though it's imperfect because it has to guess the outlines of objects on the picture, and cannot always vectorize them losslessly.
-   Some digital cameras will take full-resolution pictures and crop them down to a selected lower resolution, meaning that if you still have the raw data stored on the camera, it's possible to "enhance" the image.
-   The RAW photo format allows your camera to shoot a photo alongside most information captured by the camera's sensor. This lets you make much more drastic changes to a photo than a normal jpg or png file. For example, a wall that's directly reflecting sunlight would be a solid white plane in a conventional file format, while a RAW file usually contains enough information to edit into a decent picture.
-   An algorithm created by Japanese programmers, amusingly called _Waifu2x_, can upscale pictures reliably to a high-quality image, in a way Photoshop can't (mainly because it's very processing-intensive). It works best with flat artwork, but it can also produce good results with other images, depending on how much picture noise they contain. It can't restore detail that wasn't in the original image, so the results can look soft and waxy, but it's probably the best approximation of an Enhance Button that currently exists. Here's the documentation on Github, as well as an online version.

In other cases, scientists are working on techniques that can replicate more ridiculous Enhance Button functions in Real Life:
