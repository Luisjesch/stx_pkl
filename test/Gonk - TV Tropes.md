Over-the-top ugliness dotcom.

_"#461: Tasha's Uncontrollably Hideous Sister is not a real spell."_

Pretty much the only way in animation to make someone ugly or unusual looking is to do it deliberately and without subtlety. This character is not just unattractive, they're absurdly ugly. The result can be extremely jarring if it deviates too much from the rest of the show's look, though that's usually the point as these characters are usually intended as comic relief.

While this trope is applicable to almost anyone who looks rather unorthodox with their physical design, probably the easiest type of individual to be classified as such is the one who _behaves_ _**very**_ _badly_ in front of others, much more so if it's their default trait, especially since that can indicate or suggest that they're basically **ugliness personified**, to which the trope itself can also act like an automatic version of Evil Makes You Ugly, as well as being a much more negative relative to Ugly Cute, from such moral case.

Occasionally, Artistic Age means that Gonk gets applied to make older characters seem downright decrepit in order to seem older than the generically young cast.

An example of Non-Standard Character Design. Compare Oddball Doppelgänger, Beauty Equals Goodness and Beauty Is Bad.

Please note: While it is possible for characters to be "Gonk-ified" at some point, it's usually only temporary. Real Gonks look ugly by default.

This trope isn't as common in live-action media as you might think, due to the fact that very few actors (especially women) will take a role where their ugliness is a character trait. In most cases, "ugly" characters will have conventionally attractive actors in bad makeup or unflattering clothing. Or they'll be an offscreen character whose ugliness is constantly stated but left to the viewers' imagination. Lastly, a hideous female character might be played by a man in drag, making it easier for viewers to laugh at "her" appearance.

Not to be confused with a popular 60s and 70s toy. They fall in a better category. Nor is this to be confused with the Gonk and Geefle from _Sesame Street_. Or the power droids from _Star Wars_. Or the Herbert Chappell composition that was best used in _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_. Or the Squonk of North American legend.

_Remember: This is not a place to complain about character designs you personally find to be ugly or to list examples of Informed Ugliness. Gonk characters are emphasized in-universe to be extremely ugly and/or depicted as ugly by having an unconventional appearance compared to everyone else in the work._

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Okada from _Alive: The Final Evolution_, the only power-user who is overweight. He sweats constantly, may have a subtle hentai fetish, and suffers from an inferiority complex due to his physical appearance. His power involves killing victims who break their "promises" (for ex. two guys are killed when they call him fat despite being promised not to say so).
-   Many of the titular Titans from _Attack on Titan_. They are generally designed to look like misshapen mockeries of human beings with ridiculously goofy facial expressions. This doesn't make them any less terrifying in-universe. The ones shown that _don't_ qualify for this trope (the Colossal Titan, the Armored Titan, Eren and the Female Titan) are even more dangerous.
-   Kimura from _Azumanga Daioh_, with his perpetually gaunt and slack-jawed expression.
-   Dan in _Bamboo Blade_ is short and has a head shaped like an acorn. Yet he's got a girlfriend, is ranked high in the school, can draw very well, and is shaping up to be good at kendo. He's probably the luckiest male in the entire show, and most fans think him a victim of a _The Ping-Pong Club_ Lawyer-Friendly Cameo.
    -   Dan is basically permanently Super-Deformed. Only _once_ in the entire series (and only in the manga) is he portrayed like the other characters, and the manga has to point out that yes, that _is_ Dan.
-   The anime _Basilisk_ features some downright grotesque character designs. Tokugawa Ieyasu has a deformed chin that looks like a huge scrotum.
-   _BECK_ has at least a couple. Koyuki's friend Tanabe appears to be fourteen going on forty at the start of the series, and the gentleman who sells him his Fender also has some physical oddities.
-   _Bleach_: Some of the Red Shirt or Mook level humans, shinigami and hollows have an Art Shift into this appearance to create the impression of someone who's not important to the long-term story but who is an issue that needs dealing with immediately. The most significant example is Oomaeda, whose entire family have a creepily similar appearance with the exception of his little sister, who is gorgeous and drawn normally. Oomaeda is usually comic relief and receives no respect from anyone. Whenever he is portrayed more sympathetically or seriously, the artwork shifts accordingly.
-   Done in a very literal way in the _Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan_ anime when one of Sakura's classmates is turned into a monkey. His face and head are animated in a paper cutout style, in a completely different form of animation from the rest of the show.
    -   Let us not forget about the angels with their halos removed. Extreme case of explosive diarrhea happens. Poor bastards.
-   Captain Harlock's sidekick Tochiro (and his seemingly endless line of identical ancestors. How a family line with men that ugly manages to continue on for so many millenia is the greatest mystery of the Leijiverse). A sizeable portion of the captain's crew of Jolly Space Pirates also has the look. It's a running joke among fans that Harlock makes a point of not recruiting anybody handsomer than he is, while making sure he also has several beautiful women on the ship. Most incarnations of 999's Tetsuro are also Cartoonish Companions, though he was considerably bishified in The Movie. Also, the entire population of Earth, sans cyborgs, during the Big, Fat Future of the manga's second story arc.
-   Mrs. Q from _Ceres, Celestial Legend_, all the way. Her face brings instant funny. And therein lies her purpose.
-   It's a blip, but one episode of _Cromartie High School_ took place in what was basically a gender-flipped version of the main (male) characters' high school. The "girls" in the school were very much as if the delinquents were crossdressing... _poorly._ Moustaches and all!
-   Inverted in the original manga of _Cutey Honey_. Every character is downright ugly (specially the girls) with the exception of Honey, Natsuko, Seiji and his little brother, who in contrast look like the Non-Standard Character Design.
-   _Death Note_ has idealised-but-largely-realistic character designs for its human cast, with even the unattractive ones (like the sleazy Fat Bastard TV channel director Demegawa) merely being realistically plain. Despite this, there are some characters who do look disconcertingly inhuman:
    -   Higuchi, the brutal, low-functioning sociopath Corrupt Corporate Executive from the Yotsuba organisation is the least human-looking human in the manga, resembling an unsettling part-lion Half-Human Hybrid. Beneath his mane of spiky hair, he's got a long, strangely bestial face with a sloping brow, sharp, predatory eyes, and a thin, lipless mouth - and that's in his resting expression. When he contorts his face into a Slasher Smile, he looks outright demonic.
    -   While all of the shinigami look like demons made from spare parts, Jealous is particularly weird even among them. Rather than looking fearsome or bestial, he resembles a very crudely-made patchwork doll that's not the least bit threatening.
-   _Desert Punk_ has quite a few. If a character is unnamed or over 40, chances are they're gonks. The titular character is pretty normal looking but becomes gonked out if he's doing something disturbing.
-   _The Devil is a Part-Timer!_ has the main characters' landlady, so much so that the guys (who are _The Devil and a demon_) are freaked out the first time they see her.
    
    "Is it ... _human?_"
    
    -   When they see a picture of her in her swimsuit, Maou and Lucifer both pass out and Alciel throws up. Alciel later tries to use the picture as a weapon.
-   Calmaramon of _Digimon Frontier_, who Slide-Digivolves from the idol Ranamon is Gonk in her universe, something which causes her to lose her entire fan club. Think Ursula from _The Little Mermaid (1989)_ meets anime. A picture doesn't really tell you much, you have to watch the show and hear her laugh to truly understand her Gonk.
-   Sumiyoshi from _Excel♡Saga_. One episode has his gonkness drained out of him, turning him into a generic Bishōnen. His friends are visibly shocked, and he doesn't seem to be pleased with the change either. It was eventually shown that he gets it from his mother.
    -   The Puchuus in the anime are cute mascot characters whose faces become Gonk (resembling scarred, haggard manga assassin Golgo 13) when they are injured or killed.
-   The linemen Kurita and Komosubi of _Eyeshield 21_ are both pretty gonk, though in an Ugly Cute sort of way. In contrast to most examples, they are part of the main cast and are every bit as important and well-developed as their more attractive team members.
    -   Kasamatsu of the Taiyo Sphinx. He's about as tall as the average character in the series, but he's about three times as wide, with a really exaggerated face. He really, REALLY stands out among the other two important members on his team, the bishounen Harao, and the adult-looking Banba.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Virgo's initial appearance under the ownership of Everlue, who's a decent example himself. This is because Virgo is so loyal to whoever her master is that she actually changes her looks to whatever pleases them most. Under Lucy's ownership, she's one of the prettiest characters in the series.
    -   Ichiya has one of the sexiest voices in the series, but he's a short man with a big, square face and nose. Even when he buffs up, the face remains the same and makes people hate him even more. All the more obvious when the guild he's The Ace of, Blue Pegasus, is the epitome of pretty boys and girls, though they still respect him heavily for his abilities.
    -   Wall Eehto of Alvarez in his first appearance has Creepy Shadowed Undereyes that are ridiculously close together, disproportionately-long arms and legs compared to the rest of his body and a single Hair Antennae. In his case, however, it's justified because not only is he a robot, it's just a puppet body. The real Wall, despite being a robot as well, is more in line with a Bishōnen.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   The Armstrong family where the father and the mother and the middle children look pretty much the same except for the oldest and youngest.
    -   Gluttony, who basically looks like a bigger, more menacing Ziggy.
-   _Getter Robo_ teams always have "The fat guy", with varying levels of gonk. Musashi from the original looks a bit gonkish, especially compared to his impossibly handsome teammates (and his ridiculous, slapped together "uniform" doesn't help, either), but most of the subsequent incarnations had Musashi or his equivalent drawn with the similar rugged good looks to his compatriots. Kaede from the all girl Getter Robo Zan team is probably the gonkiest of all the Getter pilots (being a Distaff Counterpart of Musashi), but then again all the girls on that team are pretty homely by anime standards.
    -   When you compare the likes of Musashi, Benkei, and Gai to the worst this trope has to offer, it's a little harsh to call them outright gonky just because they're big.
    -   Far, _FAR_ more gonkish are "Build Angels" Mido and Monko of Kotetsushin Jeeg. Mido is tall and slender to a creepy degree, while Monko might have been able to pass for a bodybuilder-style Amazonian Beauty if she didn't look like she had a man's face pasted onto her body.
-   An unusual example in a serious anime is the sinister Kazundo Gohda (or Gouda) from _GitS: 2nd Gig_, whose face was hideously disfigured in an accident. Gohda decided _not_ to have his face reconstructed because his new appearance made him distinctive and nobody who meets him will ever forget him. This is deliberately contrasted with Hideo Kuze, the show's nominal (but less villainous) villain, whose prosthetic body wears a handsome mask-like face.
    -   The Home Affairs Minister, on the other hand, is the conventional sort.
-   _Girls Saurus_:
    -   Ichigo<small>◊</small>. Sweet mother of god, Ichigo.
    -   Pre-weight loss Haruka was rather ugly as well, though definitely not to the same grotesquely ludicrous degree as Ichigo.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_: Onizuka in intense moments of surprise, exasperation, fear, hunger, or pretty much anything else. A lot of the male cast, in fact.
    -   The main examples: other Fukada girl (nicknamed "Jaws"), the biology teacher (nicknamed "Chihuahua") and Takao (aka "Big Red").
-   In _The Hating Girl_, any character that's inherently negative is drawn as being quite ugly, and the main characters get the same treatment whenever they take on negative traits. It's especially pronounced for delinquents (and Asumi when she starts acting like one) and for the rude, lecherous upperclassmen.
-   One character from _His and Her Circumstances_ who was the Class Representative of another class who has the head of a _real person_.
-   _Hoshin Engi_: Choukoumei's three sisters, Venus, Queen and Madonna, don't share their brother's handsome looks and are grotesquely ugly. They're convinced to be Beautiful.
-   _Hunter × Hunter_:
    -   Senritsu's original design was this, though once she got a speaking role she got a facelift to Ugly Cute.
    -   Biscuit's real appearance, at least in her opinion (she's enormously tall and muscular, although not exactly ugly).
-   Played for laughs in the anime version of _THE iDOLM@STER_. The girls wanted to be more adult, wearing make-up, high heels, padding... It... doesn't end well.
-   Itsuki/Iggy in _Initial D_ has gonky features (helped by the author's drawing style, though).
-   _Ino-Head Gargoyle_: One of Saejima's regular prostitutes is nicknamed "Little Grey Alien" for her huge eyes. Combined with her small puckered mouth, she has an ugly appearance. It turns out She Cleans Up Nicely and only looks like that to avoid anyone recognizing her on the job. Her friend is so ugly that even Saejima rejects her.
-   A number of characters in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ are incredibly ugly or odd-looking.
    -   The cops who beat up Smokey and later smear a booger on Joseph's face in _Battle Tendency_ certainly qualify, as do some of the Nazi Mooks guarding Stroheim's base.
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_:
        -   J. Geil is bald, with a deformed head, no pupils, and two right hands. His design is actually based on Michael Berryman, and unlike most examples, where this trope is Played for Laughs, it makes him genuinely creepy.
        -   At first, Nena is shown to be a beautiful Indian woman, but after Joseph defeats her Stand, Empress, it's revealed she's actually a short, fat, big-headed white woman hiding inside another woman's body.
        -   ZZ, the Stand User of Wheel of Fortune, turns out to be this once he's revealed, having a scrawny body with unnaturally muscular arms.
        -   Iggy, the Crusaders' Team Pet, was a rather ugly dog when he was first introduced. He grew out of it as the series progressed, looking more human-like, or at least a cartoonish chihuahua rather than a realistic Boston Terrier.
        -   Mariah is normally a beautiful Ms. Fanservice, but her face becomes over the top ugly whenever she gets angry.
        -   Nukesaku is comically short and big-headed.
    -   _Diamond Is Unbreakable_:
        -   Shigekiyo "Shigechi" Yangu, one of the ugliest character of the entire franchise. He's short and fat, apparently bald, his crown is textured by short spikes, he has thick, drooping earlobes, small, high eyebrows, misaligned teeth, and he is missing his left maxillary central incisor. However, his childlike appearance may cross somewhere into Ugly Cute for some people.
        -   Toyohiro Kanedaichi wears a mask, and while the audience never gets to see his actual face, the heroes reaction to it implies that he's this.
        -   Masazo Kinoto has a small, x-shaped patch of hair on his crown, completely bald everywhere else, large lips, and big, beady eyes.
    -   A number of villains from _Golden Wind_ are this:
        -   Polpo, who is impossibly obese, has inhuman-looking black eyes, and a pointed nose.
        -   Pesci. There's a reason fans often compare him to a pineapple.
        -   Ghiaccio isn't inherently ugly, but his constantly angry expressions cause him to somewhat appear as this.
        -   Carne most definitely qualifies, looking hideous and lumpy with barely any neck and a _square head_.
        -   Proportionally, Secco is overall normal, but his wide mouth, sharp teeth, and Overly-Long Tongue make him look rather odd.
    -   _Stone Ocean_:
        -   Guccio. I mean, just look at him.
        -   Ungalo, one of DIO's illegitimate children, has none of the natural attractiveness of his father or brothers, having very wide-set eyes, a flat nose, and buck teeth. It's quite possible that this is all a result of his drug addiction.
    -   _Steel Ball Run_:
        -   Stephen Steel is rather plain, but his cartoonishly simple hair on his otherwise realistic looking body causes him to lean on this.
        -   Pork Pie Hat Kid has wide eyes and a strangely angular face. And then he loses the pipes on his head, and suddenly he's even worse.
    -   Tamaki Damo from _JoJolion_ is overweight, with a combover and no chin. When he's introduced to the rest of the Higashikata family, they are left completely baffled on how a man like him could end up with Hato.
-   A few characters from _Karate Shoukoushi Kohinata Minoru_, most notably Kevin and Hayama.
-   Kemeko from _Kemeko Deluxe!_. Short, ugly and yet thrown into more outfits and situations than a character of this type should be in.
    -   Curiously, when seen early on in some sort of maintenance bath, Kemeko appears to be patently feminine, only to revert the instant its cleaning cycle is finished.
-   One of the more prominent running gags in _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ involves Ragnarok member Loki having numerous body doubles a la Saddam. One of the body doubles is moderately gonky and looks extremely out of place when compared to the rest. Come to think of it, he<small>◊</small> bears a passing resemblence to Henchman 21.
-   _A Man and His Cat_: Fukumaru goes un-adopted for so long because he's seen as fat and ugly. One visitor even calls him "snotface". Kanda on the other hand believes Fukumaru is adorable.
-   Deconstructed on three separate occasions in _MÄR_, all of them by villains from the Chess Pieces.
    -   The first gonk, Rapunzel, is an extremely ugly, hag-like 29-year-old whose sensitivity about her appearance has turned her into a violent, murderous, backstabbing psychopath who enjoys killing everything that's "ugly" to her, especially women.
    -   The second gonk, Emokiss, is equally sensitive, though unlike the previous example her ugliness is self-inflicted, as she's constantly seen eating. She actually destroys her sentient Guardian $RM after it comments on her ugliness.
    -   The third gonk, Kouga, is not NEARLY as sensitive as the previous two; his problem is that, because of his ugly face, he has become delusional that ugliness equals goodness. Because of this, naturally, he is the only one of the three gonks in _MAR_ whose sheer disgust for beautiful people is actually genuine, and NOT from denial.
-   Most of the humans' design in _Midori No Makibao_ crosses into this trope. Humans in the series are often drawn with large lips and impressive nose holes
-   Ryu from _Mobile Suit Gundam_ is a bit of a borderline case, as he's usually drawn in a slightly different style than most of the main characters, but he's not really ugly (in fact, in the novels Sayla has a bit of a crush on him before she ends up getting together with Amuro).
-   Every single male monster shown so far in _Monster Musume_, in sharp contrast to the attractive if occasionally dangerous looking monster girls. First were the orcs, who were ugly pig men, followed by the male centaurs, who managed to make the orcs look downright Bishōnen.
-   Takeo Gouda, the protagonist of _My Love Story!!_ is a massive dude with a large nose, large lips and a very plain haircut. His best friend Suna however is a thin, handsome guy of average height. In any other story, Suna would be the protagonist while Takeo would be the Bromantic Foil. Takeo's girlfriend thinks he is gorgeous and his lips remind her of a movie star's.
-   Kaoru from _Nana & Kaoru_ and his mother at first, although this is more of a Generic Cuteness failure on her part. Both are moving away from this, especially since Kaoru started running and putting some effort into studying.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Konohamaru's early attempts to perform the Sexy no Jutsu were frequently comically grotesque. An entire early episode was devoted to his mastery of it.
    -   One of the Tsuchikage's bodyguards is a giant named Akatsuchi who has big fat cheeks, a bowling bin-shaped body, and a bulbous nose. In fact, the Tsuchikage himself also has an even weirder looking nose.
-   Many of the youkai in _Natsume's Book of Friends_ look this way. Nyanko-sensei in particular, has come to be known by Natsume's friends as "Natsume's really ugly cat" - if they don't mistake him for a pig, that is. This is accurate, though: the vast majority of yōkai are described in folklore as _really_ bizarre-looking.
-   In the infamous "Sandbox Sequence" from the complementary conclusion to _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, _The End of Evangelion_, Shinji sees two doll-like girls with very disturbingly-accentuated features, that definitely fall under Gonk. As with _Perfect Blue_, it is **NOT** played for laughs.
-   In _Nijigahara Holograph_, Takahama stands out from his classmates because of his round, slightly bulging eyes and almost simian facial features<small>◊</small>.
-   The world of _One Piece_ is not only a World of Ham, but a World Of Gonk living in harmony with a World of Stunning. So many characters, ranging from protagonists, antagonists, and even neutral background characters, are incredibly out there and ugly, yet go hardly unnoticed because it just happens all the time. Worth noting that the Grand Line has more gonk than the rest of the ocean; whether this is due to Oda's art evolving to be more free or the Grand Line actually being just that weird... we're not too sure.
    -   Alvida, setting the standard as the first villain we see. The funny part is that she was immensely proud of her "beauty" and hated it when people pointed out her looks... then she ate the Smooth Smooth Devil Fruit between story arcs, losing all her excess fat and becoming _genuinely_ stunning.
    -   Wanze and Duval. So Gonky that repeated kicks to the face rendered them _better looking._ Duval happens to look exactly like the poorly drawn wanted poster of Sanji, which in and of itself is Gonky in how it exaggerates Sanji's attributes, especially his spiral eyebrow.
    -   Although Oda has an _appreciation_ for transvestite culture, he expresses it in a very odd way; the One Piece world is full of Drag Queens, and they tend to be amongst the _gonkiest_ characters in the series. The two biggest examples are Emporio Ivankov, a transvestite based on Dr. Frank-N-Furter, has quite an odd facial expression with a face locked into an almost perpetual grin and eyes wide open (his female form, on the other hand, is more conventionally attractive). And Mr. 2 Bon Clay, who is so ugly that when he decided to make the world's weirdest face from a collection of all the faces he's encountered, he only had to add Usopp's nose in place of his own. And then Sanji landed in the Ironic Hell of the Kamabakka Kingdom, an island nation populated exclusively by incredibly ugly crossdressing men.
    -   Most of the members of the Blackbeard Pirates are gonks, such as the titular Captain (Luffy's evil counterpart) and most of the new members. This may go with the crew perception of being Psycho Rangers to the Straw Hats.
    -   Big Mom is a particularly terrifying example, being incredibly huge with bulging eyes, a large nose, and a permanent grin. Doesn't help that she _eats_ her own crew mates and destroys islands under her protection that don't pay her back in candy. Several of her children qualify as well, with varying degrees of ugliness from "somewhat iffy" to "almost as horrible as mom". Only a few manage to avoid inheriting her ugly genes.
    -   Inverted with Sabo is the only noble child who is cute and attractive and the Token Good Teammate compared to the rest of the Royal Brats. seen in the Goa Kingdom. He also looks great as an adult.
    -   Kokoro has to be one of the most hideous characters in the entire series. LOOK AT HER.
    -   Speaking of the royal brats in question, it'd seem male Celestial Dragons are generally varying degrees of ugly (when not related to Doflamingo), going from "homely guy you'd meet in real life" to "disgusting". Either the creators of the world weren't nearly as perfect as some say or all the royal excesses have done a number on their faces. And the one that reformed looks _much_ better since then, so Evil Makes You Ugly may apply.
-   _One-Punch Man_ has a fitting character in the origin story of its titular one. Before deciding to be a hero and training so hard that he went bald, he saves a kid with a chin that literally resembles a rear end. Yup. Most of the monsters fit this trope as well.
-   A strange example occurs in _Ouran High School Host Club_ when the host club does this in an attempt to cheer up Haruhi. Since the show already has quite a few crossdressers, they (with the exception of Kyouya, natually) end up in hilariously overdone makeup to make the situation funny.
-   _Pani Poni Dash!_ has several, most notably Yankee, whose picture is at the top, and the hordes of identical Itou-sans. Then there's the characters who are drawn to look very similar to their real life originals, which... doesn't quite mesh with the Puni Plush cuteness of the rest... the Tommy Lee Jones Circa Men in Black for example is especially jarring, as he's mostly seen with Ichijou...who often sports an even simpler face than normal.
-   Me-Mania<small>◊</small> in _Perfect Blue_. NOT played for laughs.
-   One episode of _Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl_ has Team Rocket stressing over their current fitness, going from delightfully plump to outright gonk.
-   Most of Tsukimi's friends in _Princess Jellyfish_ fall on the Gonky side, especially compared to their gender-flipped Nerd Nanny, Kuranosuke.
-   Notable exception — _Princess Nine_'s Mao Daidouji being heavy-set is important to her characterization, but she is drawn in a realistic style.
-   Andre from _Prison School_. He's large, has an egg-shaped body, a face that is way too small for the rest of his head and oversized Buddha-like earlobes.
-   The OVA _Puppet Princess_ takes this to extremes. Every single reaction closeup has the characters' faces contorted into ridiculous and nightmarish expressions, complete with Hellish Pupils.
-   Konatsu's step-family in _Ranma ½_ is deliberately made hideous, despite them being hostesses at the "Sexy Kunoichi Tea Spot" (a brothel, the reader is made to assume, or at least an extremely exclusive parlor.) His stepsisters are either gangly and monkey-like, or gigantic and with lips so huge they are her entire face. To say nothing of the shrunken, yakuza-faced step-mother. This makes Konatsu by far the most attractive woman, even though he's a guy.

-   In _Reign: The Conqueror_, Diogenes is short and ugly with bad teeth.
-   In _Rurouni Kenshin_ most minor villains, especially those belonging to gangs, are Gonks.
    -   A group among Shishio's followers, the Priests of Abukuma, are particularly notable. Each one of the four have the most comically hideous faces, and the first thing they even talk about is sex!
    -   And in _Samurai X_, we have Iizuka, Kenshin's 'handler', drawn noticeably less attractive than the rest of the male cast likely because of his propensity for betrayal.
-   Another exception, _Sailor Moon_ has one of Usagi's schoolfriends who pops up now and then in the first few episodes of the show. She's chubby, but not ugly in any way. She gets the Beither Chuck treatment pretty fast along with the rest of Usagi's former friends after other Senshi start showing up and she hangs out with them instead. Sadly, while the other girls had names, this character never did (and this is a show that has been known to give names to the most minor of characters in the guidebooks) so fans can only identify her as "Usagi's Fat Friend".
    -   Some of the episodic Youma/Daimon/Whatevers are pretty damn gonky too, with the final season, as serious as it's supposed to be, having a ludicrously high ratio in comparison to arcs where that would be more fitting, say the Dark Circus arc. (The completely ridiculous looking 'sailor parody' phages)
-   _Samurai Champloo_ utterly subverts this, being able to have attractive and unattractive characters from one end of the spectrum to the other and in between without any stylistic major shifts.
    -   In one episode, Fuu is forced to work off her debt in a brothel. While "on display," she deliberately contorts her face into Gonk Mode to discourage customers from choosing her. Unfortunately, that face happens to catch the eye of another Gonk...
-   Several side-characters from _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_ are drawn completely different from the main cast. Chiri Kitsu shifts to a Gonk as needed.
-   _The Seven Deadly Sins_: In contrast to King's normal child-like fairy form, his human form is a fat slob-looking man.
-   Actually averted in the film _Spirited Away_. Miyazaki didn't want his female protagonist Chihiro to be overly beautiful, in order to reinforce her presentation as an average girl at the film's beginning. He managed to succeed at this task without having her look exceptionally ugly or out of place, capturing just the look he was going for.
    -   Yubaba, the witch that runs the bath-house, is Gonk. And, obviously, her twin sister, Zeniba, would be as well.
-   _The Story Between a Dumb Prefect and a High School Girl with an Inappropriate Skirt Length_: Tsukishima when he's outside the library is nearly unrecognizable as the same person as the Hot Librarian he is inside (surrounding him with books can cause him to revert to his Bishōnen form).
-   Kimo-o in the manga _Stripe Blue_. He's totally unaware of how freaking creepy he looks, and the fact that he also _acts_ like a lunatic doesn't help.
-   In _Team Medical Dragon_, it's possible to identify the good and bad guys by one characteristic alone: most of the time, the good guys are drawn incredibly attractively, while evil characters invariably look like the products of 18 generations of inbreeding.
    -   The villains sure are ugly (as hell), but the sympathetic male characters range from heroically handsome over small and dorky to The Big Guy. The women, of course, are attractive. The patients look sickly.
-   Tenchi's classmate Kazuhiko Amagasaki in _Tenchi Muyo!_ is an iconic one, to the point he actually had a short-lived subtrope inspired by him ("The Fat Guy with Big Lips and Pimply Nose"). He appears mostly in _Tenchi in Tokyo_.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_:
    -   Attenborough who is best described as a crazed muppet.
    -   Leeron may count too, the guy may aim to be a Bishounen, but he still looks like a frog.
    -   Jougan and Balinbou aren't exactly pretty either.
-   Another exception — In one episode of _Tenjho Tenge_, we learn where female villain Emi Isuzu keeps all her hidden knives: she's really quite obese, and uses ki techniques to compress her fat and use it to carry concealed weapons. However, her full-sized form is completely Gonk-free, though it doesn't stop Maya (who learns Emi's big secret) from teasing her about it.
-   The unnamed school principal in _To Love Ru_, a fat and short pervert. When he sees a girl he likes, he usually rips off all his clothes.
-   Buppa, a gang leader in _Tokyo Tribe 2_, from the infamous "Goosh Goosh" sequence.
-   Inko-chan from _Toradora!_ is a pet parrot Gonk, of all things.
-   Played for Laughs in _Uncle from Another World_, where Uncle has this appearance during his more exaggerated moments. In truth, he is not _hideous_\-looking, but is still gaunt and homely in appearance, which led to him being mistaken for, and feared as, an orc in the other world where everyone is beautiful.
-   Soban the leader of the Butsumetsu gang from _Urusei Yatsura_ is incredibly ugly and deformed compared to everyone else with his huge bald head, beady little eyes, massive lips, and big crooked teeth.

-   _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_ High school student and gang member Kuroda looks like an unholy union between a Beatles member and an oversized rat. Don't expect his twin brother to have any striking good looks either. Despite his muscular physique and rather handsome countenance, Dou also counts in his own feral way.
-   A lot of the lesser villains in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_. While Ushio and Kai look rather decent, the others like Kujirada and Nezumi (whose name means 'rat' in Japanese), are outright gonk!
    -   And then there's Hobson, as seen here<small>◊</small>, lampshaded in Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series by Kaiba who thinks Hobson is a mutant, although Hobson does use Hulk Speak so he might have a point.
    -   The Seto Kaiba imposter (posing as his ghost) in the Duelist Kingdom arc is horrendously this once he drops the charade.
    -   Yu-Gi-Oh DM's spinoff series, _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ also deserves a mention. Following in the footsteps of its predecessor, GX has numerous Gonky characters (mostly villains), the most notable of which being Professor Chronos de Medici (Vellian Crowler) and V.P. Napoleon (Jean-Louis Bonaparte). Jun Manjoume's spirit partners, the Ojamas, also qualify. To be fair, though, the series makes up for all the Gonk with an entire gang of cute/Bishounen heroes.
-   Several demons in _YuYu Hakusho_ and, even more so, the crimelord Tarukane.
    -   And then there's Kuroko Sanada-Sato, Sensui's predecessor as Spirit Detective. Sure, she's beautiful<small>◊</small> in the present, but one look at a photo of her and her friends during her tenure made many readers do a Double Take.

     Arts 

-   _Abaporu_: The Abaporu deliberately has a distorted anatomy, with a giant foot and hand culminating in an undersized head.
-   Quentin Matsys' painting "The Ugly Duchess", which is believed to be the inspiration for the Duchess in _Alice in Wonderland_.

    Asian Animation 

-   Big M. of _Happy Heroes_ is deliberately made to look ugly, with his puffed-up lips and zig-zagged mustache, contrasting heavily with the much more adorable appearances of the Supermen, their non-biological father Doctor H., and even Big M.'s own assistant Little M. In-universe, Big M.'s so ugly that anyone who looks right at him throws up on the spot.
-   In _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Joys of Seasons_ episode 66, Tibbie is one of the cheerleaders at a racing event and has a group of boys smitten over her. The other two cheerleaders with her, who have visibly different-looking lips and eyes and are much uglier as a result, don't attract as many boys for obvious reasons.

    Fan Works 

-   _Equestria Girls: Friendship Souls_: Hydia. She's just as ugly as her G1 counterpart; short, fat, and looking more like a toad than a human. Her children follow the pattern.

    Comics 

-   "Big Ethel" from _Archie Comics_ was once six-foot, scrawny, buck-toothed, and with a nose that would shame _Pinocchio_. Over the years she's steadily been toned down (with the moniker "big" being dropped entirely) and become _much_ easier on the eyes, to the point that she's now only _slightly_ less attractive than Betty and Veronica.
-   _Doom Patrol_ gives us Dorothy Spinner, a perfectly sweet teenage girl who unfortunately has an unusually simian-looking face, but she's adorable compared to her older Dark Future counterpart from the _Doom Force_ one-shot, who is afflicted with both a wrinkled monkey face _and_ a horribly (and deliberately) Liefeld-esque physique.
-   _Judge Dredd_: This, in a word, sums up the life of Otto Sump, the ugliest man in Mega-City One and quite possibly the planet. And that includes mutants and undead creatures in that calculation. He's so impossibly ugly that the city's face-changing machines have absolutely no effect on him. One would call it "a face only a mother could love", except his mother tried to abandon him at birth and only took him back to avoid legal consequences.
-   The Yellow Bastard from _Sin City_ stands out.
    -   Marv's a gonk, due to the impossible skeletal structure of his face. It's stated in "The Hard Goodbye" that Marv is so ugly even the prostitutes won't touch him. Goldie was the one exception, and when she gets murdered he spends the entire rest of the story on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge against her killers.
-   Penelope Platypus from _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_ looks more or less like a cartoony platypus on two legs wearing a backpack, while other original females from the comic have the figures of developed young women, yet still retain animal heads and fur.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: The Golden Age Duke of Deception is a shriveled man with twisted facial features and two different sized eyes. Deception is not depicted to be easy on the eyes, being uglier than Doctor Psycho whose unattractive features are a plot point.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Most of the underground-dwelling outcast mutants were very ugly. In fact, many of those who were not ugly to begin with had their features marred by the flesh-shaping member Masque, as their way of showing disdain for the society that rejected them.
    -   Toad was described as having an extremely odd, unpleasant face.

    Films — Animation 

-   _101 Dalmatians_:
    -   Horace and Jasper. Everything from their disproportional builds to their huge noses makes Cruella De Vil's henchmen a lot uglier than any human character in the film (except for their boss, maybe).
    -   Cruella De Vil, as stated above, also qualifies. Her skeletal figure and sickly grey-lilac skin, along with some really unnerving facial expressions, leaves no one to wonder who the main villain of the film is.
-   _All Dogs Go to Heaven_ has King Gator, the grotesque crocodile who has horrified children for years with his sexually ambiguous nature and innuendo (specifically, the song "Let's Make Music Together").
-   Gaetan "Mole" Molière from _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_. With his cartoonishly squat proportions and enlarged teeth, he resembles his animal namesake more than anything. His telescope goggles also exaggerates his facial expressions, making him stand out even more amongst the other characters.
-   Beavis And Butthead's fathers from _Beavis And Butthead Do America_ aren't much better looking than the titular duo, being overweight, balding, wearing slobby dress code, and having just as unappealing faces as their sons.
-   General Posada from _The Book of Life_, is short, fat, and ugly.
-   Two cars in Paris in _Cars 2_ have mismatched eyes on their windshields, have dented bodies, and crooked teeth inside their bumpers. However, a forklift artist for some reason actually decided to draw them as both being extremely attractive-looking.
-   _Coco_: "Everyone Knows Juanita" seems to be describing such a person, with the punchline revealing that Juanita is actually an object of desire for the even uglier singer.
-   Mel Meh from _The Emoji Movie_ has a Donald Trump-like hairstyle, bags under his eyes, and a huge frown on his face.
-   In Ralph Bakshi's _The Lord of the Rings_ most of the hobbits are fairly normal looking and the younger ones look like children, but Samwise is very ugly. He has a huge head, crooked teeth, a big nose and chin, and at times seems to have a lazy eye.
    -   The other hobbits are aristocrats, or what passes for it in the Shire: Merry is the son of the Master of Buckland (Saradoc Brandybuck), Pippin is the son of the Thain of the Shire (Peregrin Took), and Frodo is from a wealthy family closely related to both the Brandybucks and the Tooks. Sam is, basically, the son of Frodo's groundskeeper.
-   Roz from _Monsters, Inc._ has a much more realistic appearance than the more cartoonish-looking monsters that make up the rest of the cast. Then there's her age and hair.
-   _Quest for Camelot_ utilizes this with its villain, Ruber. His huge misshapen body and shrunken face makes him really stand out from the other Knights of the Round Table, who are perfectly normal-looking people.
-   Mok Swagger from _Rock and Rule_. Despite the entire cast consisting of anthropomorphic furries, most look human, while Mok looks severely deformed, or like a plastic surgery experiment gone wrong.
-   So many of Spark Plug Entertainment's characters are like this, but the best example is the lantern-jawed bee Pistol in _Plan Bee_.
-   The Kingpin in _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_ was based on Bill Sienkiewicz's depiction of the character — which results in a Tiny-Headed Behemoth that clashes with the other characters, including his own family, an anime girl, a black and white Spider-Man, and a cartoon pig.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Danny Trejo is typically cast in frightening roles precisely because his unusual features make him look intimidating. Peter Lorre would be an earlier example, with an appearance that made him easy to accept as a villain. Ditto the character actor Brion James.
-   The orcs in Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth trilogies are all hideous, but at least two stand out more than the rest.
    -   The Great Goblin from _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ is twice the size of his brethren - both vertically and horzontally - and he has a beard made out of fat hanging from his jaw.
    -   Gothmog - the orc general from _The Return of the King_ - looks like Sloth if he was a villain.
-   In _CJ7_, one of Dicky's classmates is a girl who looks like an adult male. She's supposed to be TEN.
-   Joseph Goebbels in _Downfall_. The man looks like a skeleton with sunken eyes that wears a flesh mask.
-   King Einon from _Dragonheart_, or at least according to The Nostalgia Chick. Like the Garry Shandling example above, it has a lot to do with his often over-the-top facial expressions.
-   Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stands out in both the 1984 and 2021\-2023 film adaptations of _Dune_. He's grotesquely obese in both, though the 1984 one goes the extra mile with his face, which is covered with suppurating sores.
-   One classic example of a particularly ugly Gonk is "Sloth" of _The Goonies_ fame. His Gonk-ness was actually so striking, his initial appearance was enough to shock and initially terrify one of the protagonists, "Chunk", before he was later revealed to be a Gentle Giant.
-   The main actor playing the main character in _Gummo_ looks quite unusual, which actually fits very well with the overall strangeness of the film.
-   In _Home Alone_, Kevin recoils at a photo of older brother Buzz's girlfriend. We see the picture too and she is this trope. Her "actress" was actually a boy in drag; this way, director Chris Columbus could play up "her" ugliness as much as he wanted without humiliating an actual girl.
-   The _Killer Klowns from Outer Space_ are a Monster Clown Species that looks grossly deformed and disproportionate, to the point you'd wonder how on Earth could their victims be fooled into assuming that they were regular people in clown makeup and not run for their lives the moment they see them approaching.
-   Dinosaur Rex from _Little Man_. He looks a bland Korean knock-off of a Barney toy.
-   The Predators quite fittingly fall into this with their rather inhuman faces compared to the humans they hunt.
-   Johnny of _The Room (2003)_ is rather creepy looking with an indeterminate accent, yet beloved by all.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   Certainly Jabba the Hutt from _Return of the Jedi_ qualifies, and his throne room is an all-out Gonk-fest. Much the same can be said for the Mos Eisley cantina in _A New Hope_, although many of its patrons are basically Beast Men and slightly-less-than-anthropomorphized animals.
    -   Post disfigurement/unmasking, Palpatine barely passes for human, having whitish-yellow skin, glowing eyes with raw-looking eye sockets, and gnarled, claw-like fingernails.
-   In _What Planet Are You From?_, Garry Shandling played a Gonk. It counts as character design because the problem wasn't his natural features so much as his 'I just ate a bag of lemons' expression.

    Literature 

-   According to the original drawings for _Alice in Wonderland_, both the Queen of Hearts and the Duchess could easily be the trope image.
-   Corporal Nobby Nobbs from _Discworld_ is described as ugly enough to A) require documented evidence to prove that he's (probably) human, and B) completely avert and/or subvert the Attractive Bent-Gender trope (this is footnoted in the text itself). Official art of him fits the trope, depicting him as big-nosed, hunched-over, awkwardly skinny, and covered in blemishes.
-   The chinless, goatish-faced character of Wilbur Whateley from _The Dunwich Horror_ easily qualifies. His "twin" brother is even worse.
-   The descriptions of Dolores Umbridge in _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_, which start with "frog-like" and get less flattering, set her apart as grotesque compared to the rest of the Ministry and an obvious villain to the students, to underline the catastrophe of the Ministry's eventual take-over of Hogwarts (with her in charge). Averted, with unexpected effectiveness, in the film.
-   Phryne in _Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?_. In the novels, she's described to have a boulder-like body, and relative to that size her limbs are too short and her head too large. The Animated Adaptation makes her look like an entirely different art style and that she should belong in a different series altogether. When Bell first sees her, he wonders if she was a monster.
-   Ichabod Crane, the protagonist of _The Legend of Sleepy Hollow_, is described as rather odd-looking, having a small head, big ears, a long nose, long arms and legs, and a very skinny build. The narrator even compares him to a scarecrow and a grasshopper.
-   _Neuromancer_'s Ratz.
    
    The bartender's smile widened. His ugliness was the stuff of legend. In an age of affordable beauty, there was something heraldic about his lack of it.
    
-   One of Count Olaf's henchmen in _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ is a large person who looks like neither a man nor a woman, appropriately called "The Person of Indeterminate Gender".
-   Carl Hiaasen's books _Star Island_ and _Skin Tight_ contain the ex-con turned bodyguard Chemo, who has a deformed face due to an electrolysis procedure that went horribly wrong. Then he took a medication that promised to fix it, but instead made it look like cereal was glued to his face. He went to prison for killing the incompetent electrolysis doctor.
-   _Survivor Dogs_: Almost every time Whine is mentioned, he's referred to as "ugly". He's a Pug mix so he might look Ugly Cute to humans, but his squashed muzzle and beady eyes are disturbing to other dogs.
-   Stillborn in _Sword of Shadows_ is considered the ugliest man in the North, described in vivid detail. He's a member of the Maimed Men, a renegade clan of outlaws so called because they typically ritually mutilate all new members. Stillborn escaped this fate, mostly because he was _so_ ugly the other Maimed Men decided there really wasn't anything they could do to make him look _worse_. But he's a pretty decent guy once you get to know him.
-   _Warren the 13th_ is described as looking toad-like, thanks to his huge eyes, elongated jaw, and misshapen teeth. This is a minor source of angst for him, as all the other Warrens before him were known for being physically attractive.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Likewise, Howard's mother in _The Big Bang Theory_. She's said to be inhumanly fat and generally disgusting in both appearance and mannerisms (although much of this is probably exaggeration by Howard), with all of her dialogue shouted from off-screen in an incredibly grating voice.
-   _The Brittas Empire_: Throughout the series, Colin looks like he's just crawled out of a coal mine in 1970's Newcastle. He has a septic, diseased right hand covered in moldy bandages, which complements the massive boil on his right cheek, his disgustingly greasy, matted hair, filthy clothes and persistent bad body odour. He retains these "characteristics" for the show's entire run. Subverted in one episode where Colin turns up clean-shaven in a suit, tie and blazer, impersonating Gordon Brittas for a day while his illegitimate Australian daughter is visiting him.
-   _Doctor Who_
    
    -   The Sontarans.
    
    **Guard:** He looks like a giant baked potato!
    
-   Half of the non-Puppet aliens in _Farscape_. They seem to try to go overboard on crusty features and grotesque prosthetics. Good examples are the "Tavloids" (Tavleks) in the Season 1 episode "Throne for a Loss", with their oversized mouths and metal-dome heads; and _especially_ the "Plakavoids" (Plokavians) in Season 2's "The Ugly Truth", whose faces appear to be melting off their skulls.
-   Father Jack from _Father Ted_ is incredibly ugly, with stringy unwashed hair, crusted lips and skin, and a near-permanent grimacing snarl. Word of God says that Frank Kelly always had to eat alone when on set because the make-up that was used to transform him into Father Jack was disgusting enough to put the rest of the cast and crew off their meals.
-   Peg's mother was implied to be one of these on _Married... with Children_, although we were fortunate enough to never actually see what she looked like. Chances are we'd probably Go Mad from the Revelation, after all.
-   _Match Game_: Several questions over the years have featured characters who were super ugly, asking the contestant to fill in the blank with something to compare the subject's ugliness to. Usually, the punch line is a movie monster, such as King Kong or Frankenstein.
    -   Originally the questions featured "Ugly Edna". When real girls named Edna started getting bullied because of it the show changed it to "Ugly Alfreya".
-   _Sanford and Son_: Fred's cruel jokes about Aunt Esther have included remarks about her being as grotesque in appearance as King Kong and Godzilla, among other movie monsters.

    Manhwa 

-   _The Breaker_ (manhwa) has Mamungi. The protagonist calls him an ork, but his badass master just calls him frog-faced.

    Music 

-   Frank Zappa: Bobby from "San Ber'dino" is a guy who lives in a trailer park and "looks like a potato." The unnamed woman he loves is apparently similiarly unattractive.

    Newspaper Comics 

-   _Cathy_ bears the unusual distinction of having a Gonk protagonist, with gigantic eyes, stringy hair, and no nose. Out-of-universe, she's sometimes considered Ugly Cute, but in-universe she remarks that the only people who've ever called her attractive have been trying to sell her things.
-   _Garfield_ has no recurring Gonks, but a lot of ugly one-shot characters. They tend to be very well-detailed, perhaps to contrast better with the detail-light main cast. They do have to go the extra mile, but they are perfectly capable.
-   Large, hideous, insane and violent ladies has been a staple of _Pondus_ from early on, almost always in relation to Casanova Wannabe Jokke (later replaced with Ivar and Hugo) hitting on them and getting hit for it.
-   Hildegard Hamhocker from the comic strip _Tumbleweeds_ was such a Gonk that Tumbleweeds described her as "the only girl (and I use that term loosely) in Grimy Gulch." She wanted him to marry her, but he wasn't having it. She's got buck teeth, a vacant stare and an upturned beak nose.
-   _For Better or for Worse_: Many, _many_ background and minor characters look bizarre, with unusual faces, bad hair and pointy noses or other ugly or exaggerated features. It’s especially jarring in the later years when the strip gained a realistic art style.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The French Angel was billed as "So ugly, he's beautiful." He had acromegaly which, among other things, gave him an abnormally large heard. Angel gimmicks soon spread across North America as French Angel got over. Some of them had deforming diseases, some used makeup, one(Super Swedish Angel) was just fat, most of them were short and all of them were ugly.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Pathfinder_ While all of the other Runelords are pretty, or at least average-looking, Zutha, the Runelord of Necromancy and Glutonny looks like a hideous, morbidly obese man with a really bad case of jaundice. His lich form is even worse, with visible bones protruding from his neck.
-   In _Rocket Age_ Julandri labourers are naturally unattractive, as are Iotes and Chanari. Anyone with the unattractive trait will also count as this.
-   _Vampire: The Requiem_: While Nosferatu usually have a Looks Like Orlok appearance, many have some other hideous and inhuman face, and some are simply Uncanny Valley.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_: Whereas most other games's art has very good-looking people, _Warhammer Fantasy Battle/Roleplay_ and its spin-offs are famous for averting that. That hunchbacked, grossly fat oaf with a lazy eye and hairy warts is not a mutant, that's a representation of the average Old Worlder. Even the elves aren't pretty in the first Warhammer editions - more scars and eye-patches than a pirate crew. Though there is some movement away from the "everyone is fugly" character depiction.

    Toys 

    Video Games 

-   The video game version of _Alice in Wonderland (2010)_ turns several characters into these. The Red Queen is the most obvious example, since she was already a gonk in the film; but even the genuinely attractive White Queen is rendered as an overly pale waxy-looking figure with oddly proportioned facial features.
-   _Ape Escape_: Monkey Yellow is a good example of this looking much more like a rubber duck than a monkey. And he considers himself the best-looking character in the series.
-   _Bloodborne_: Several minor NPCs have their faces modified with 'facial deformation' sliders the player can't access, which skew the angle of their facial features. It's apparently meant to represent the side effects of rampant Old Blood use on the populace of Yharnam.
-   _Breath of Fire_:
    -   Most of the Shamans from _Breath of Fire II_ are slender-figure elemental girls with little clothes on, except Solo, the Earth elemental who is simply huge, Fan Disservice material. See the difference yourself.<small>◊</small>
    -   Yohm from _Breath of Fire IV_ is pretty much the prototypical example of Geezer Gonk. Stick legs, round body, his nose looks like a potato, and the impression one gets is of Anpan Man gone terribly wrong and evil.

-   _Deadly Rooms of Death_: Beethro, plus several other characters. Since Beethro is the player character, his is by nessesity a case that one can get used to.
-   _EarthBound (1994)_:
    -   Lardna Minch is a prime example. Maybe it's something about how her mouth is bigger than the rest of her head, or how plastic and grotesque her smile is, but it's kind of disturbing.
    -   Lardna Minch's son Pokey looks quite disturbing, even for someone of his weight. His hair obscures his eyes and his mouth is always open; when he fights alongside Giygas in the final battle, he appears to have blue skin. His 3D models in _Brawl_ are even creepier.
-   _Fallout 4: Nuka World_ has the Raider Radio DJ "Red Eye", at least in relation to everyone else, even ghouls. Red Eye, called that due to his bloodshot eyes, is never seen but has his own actor in game and while he has the same body as every other man in game he has oddly big lips and beady black eyes, unlike anybody else in game.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Many characters in the first six games in the series are Gonks, due to the fact that main artist Yoshitaka Amano has no middle ground between "is that even human" and "TAKE ME, YOU GORGEOUS DEVIL, TAKE ME".
    -   _Final Fantasy IX_: Queen Brahne outranks most of the monsters in the game in sheer ugliness for no easily explained reason. This may be a vague dig at Beauty Equals Goodness (compared to the villainous but attractive Kuja) as her subjects usually insist Brahne is a competent and respectable leader, at least pre-game. It is particularly bizarre because her daughter doesn't look anything like her which theoretically isn't a problem because Garnet is revealed to not be her biological child. Except that Garnet was adopted by the royal family because she looked close enough to the real Princess Garnet to take her place, which means that Brahne still had a biological child that looked nothing like her.

-   _Harvest Moon: Island of Happiness_:
    -   Gannon the carpenter is considerably less attractive than the other inhabitants of the island. His daughter Eliza, on the other hand, is so cute it hurts.
    -   The Gourmet is so ugly, some fans are convinced he's not actually _human_. _Island of Happiness_ and related replaced him with a cute kid Expy.
-   When speaking, _Hotline Miami_ characters are rendered as detailed animated "talking heads" that are intentionally drawn to look "ugly" (for lack of a better word), adding to the surreal atmosphere of the game.
-   _Inazuma Eleven_: Kabeyama is fat, has a weird hairstyle, a big nose, big lips and in a series more or less full of pretty boys he _really_ stands out with his ugliness, even among the less attractive characters. But then, most of the other first-years aren't exactly lookers, either.
-   _Jet Set Radio_ has a collection of colorful and unique-looking characters. Soda<small>◊</small> takes this a step further with his tall height, long limbs, big nose, and odd hairstyle, which make him look sorta like a Muppet.
-   The _Kirby_ franchise is set in a Sugar Bowl mostly full of Waddling Heads and other Ridiculously Cute Critters, but Lord Hyness from _Kirby Star Allies_ is eventually revealed to be an extremely odd-looking goblin with an enormous nose and bulging chameleon-like eyes that move independently of one another once Kirby knocks the hood off his cloak. He actually has a complex about anybody seeing his odd-looking face, and getting his hood knocked _sends him into a violent rage_.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:

-   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_ has a Great Fairy in the Dark World who is incredibly fat and has a very bulbous nose. She states that she looks like this due to the dark powers from Ganon corrupting the land. In the ending, she's returned to normal after Link uses the Triforce to undo all of Ganon's evil wishes.
-   Dampé the gravedigger is typically depicted as an Igor-like figure with a hunched back, sloping and pointed forehead, protruding brows, flat teeth that protrude from his closed mouth despite most of them being missing, and apelike arms that hang almost to the ground.
-   The Gerudo tribe is known to have rather good-looking members, also including the Great King of Evil himself. But then we have Koume and Kotake, a wicked pair of old twin sisters whose proportions are very exaggerated compared to the rest of the race. This changes in the second half of their boss fight where they combine and become a Hotter and Sexier version of themselves.
-   The generally handsome members of the Zora race have their King Zora, who mostly looks like a fat Humpty Dumpty\-esque toad with a pronounced lower lip. This is toned down in _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ where the Zora king is still pretty chunky, but he has a lot of muscle as well and his face looks somewhat old instead of ugly.

-   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_: Dr. Borville is elderly, bent and withered, with a face dominated by ridiculous poofed-out hair, gigantic wing-like ears, thick coke-bottle glasses, and a pronounced lower lip from whose corners two teeth visibly protrude.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: Kilton, who runs the monster based Fang & Bone shop, is a Hylian. Unlike the rest of the Hylians, which look like the average human, Kilton is quite short and a little chubby, and has light green-blue skin, barely any hair, bright red lips with fangs painted onto them, and a tapering head as tall as the rest of his body.
-   _The Legend Of Zelda C Di Games_: The main characters are drawn heavily off-model, and everyone else is downright grotesque.

-   Borgan from _Lunar: Eternal Blue_. Used for a hilarious bit of Fan Disservice in-game, where they sneak a picture of him in the collection of pictures of the game's more attractive characters.
-   _Mega Man Battle Network_: Gutsman's operator Dex. His _Star Force_ Expy Bud also falls under this. Dex looks like some strange obese shark person, while Bud is some obese guy with his hair shaped into horns. This might be a possible Shout-Out to _Astro Boy_ 's designs; Osamu Tezuka characters have a distinctive old-school flavor that often looks really strange to newer anime fans.
-   Larsa, the Final Boss of _Mushihime Sama Futari_, is a very obese and ugly woman. Averted with her One-Winged Angel form, who crosses the Bishōnen Line into a more conventionally slender and beautiful woman.
-   _Persona_:
    -   Igor, master of the Velvet Room, is definitely this, even without the overly long nose.
    -   _Persona 4_:
        -   Hanako Ohtani, a fat female student for whom 'the joke' is that she doesn't realize that she's hideous, and hence ends up in the likes of a beauty pageant where she is shocked and disappointed that she doesn't win. Hit even harder in the P4 Golden edition of the game: after receiving an (obviously misdirected) love inquiry from Yosuke, she interprets it as a genuine expression of interest to Yosuke's horror before squashing his bike.
        -   Homeroom teacher Kinshiro Morooka, aka "King Moron," seriously needs a dentist. Possibly a dentist with a hacksaw. He also bears a striking resemblance to Steve Buscemi, which just makes things worse. (His replacement, Miss Kashiwagi, is not exactly a gonk, but is an Old Maid.)
        -   And then there's Mitsuo Kubo's fish-eyed face making him look for all the world like the Gerber Baby, but in his case he's supposed to be unsettling for a different reason.
    -   _Persona 5_:
        -   Junya Kaneshiro, a fat and homely crime boss who is similar in build to Hanako that serves as one of the major villains in the game. In his Motive Rant, he claims that he was driven to crime because there were not a lot of options for a poor and ugly person like him.
        -   Principal Kobayakawa, whose body can be described as egg-like, looking similar to an older version of Kaneshiro without a visible neck.
        -   Downplayed with Lala Escargot, who's a heavy-set Drag Queen with a noticeable double chin.
-   _Pokémon_
    -   Stunfisk in _Pokémon Black and White_. It's arguably not _so_ bad, but it lives in a world of cuteness. Ironically, in the anime, Cilan, a character known for his good looks and Bishonen-ness, is the one who catches it.
    -   Jynx is a Gonk all the way from the Indigo League. It also looks like a blackface caricature, possibly intentional assuming it's a combination of Black Pete and an Opera Singer. Another interpretation is that it was based on Japanese fashion trend "Ganguro" but Gamefreak admit they don't remember what they were thinking when they drew it, most likely it was this trope.
    -   Binacle from _Pokémon X and Y_. Two barnacles attached to a rock, each with a rather squashed, nonstandard design for a face. Some people have jokingly compared it to _The Ugly Barnacle_.
    -   Bruxish is a reef triggerfish Pokémon introduced in _Pokémon Sun and Moon_. "Some bizarre result of a cosmetics factory polluting the local reservoir" is a fairly accurate description of its appearance, what with its wild pink/yellow/gold/purple coloration, flower-shaped lure, thick fish-lips, and sharp teeth. Said teeth are not just for show either: with the Ability "Strong Jaw" their signature move Psychic Fangs is boosted by 50% along with their Same-type Attack Bonus 50% boost. Their garish colors also give them the "Dazzling" Ability, which prevents Priority moves when used solely on the Bruxish.
-   Prince from _Power Instinct_ is a fat, ugly parody of all the Prince Charming stereotypes... until you knock him down. When he hits the ground, he briefly transforms into a Bishōnen.
-   _Psychonauts_:
    -   Bobby Zilch has crooked, misshapen teeth with his gums prominently showing.
    -   Crispin Whytehead looks like a deformed caricature of Steve Buscemi. His facial features are squashed down and he has giant, bright red lips.
-   _Psychosomnium_: Shirley, the only female in the game, looks like a bizarre mutant (not that the brown blocky people in this game are very handsome.)
-   _Punch-Out!!_:
    -   King Hippo is obese and barely looks human. _Captain N: The Game Master_ takes it one step further and gives him blue skin.
    -   Aran Ryan looks fine in his character art (one could maybe call him handsome) but his character model has a constant hideous sneer that makes him look extremely ugly in-game.
-   _Resident Evil Village_: While the other three Lords look okay (Dimitrescu is a Statuesque Stunner, Heisenberg is a little rough and scruffy but otherwise pretty handsome and Beneviento looks like a normal woman save for a cluster of Mold on her eye), Moreau is extremely ugly compared to them, being a very deformed hunchback.
-   _River City Ransom_: Most of the characters in the _Kunio-kun_ games are generically cute... except for Misuzu, who is a seven-foot schoolgirl with a head the size of a pumpkin and the face of a middle-aged woman.
-   _Robopon_ has Gonks in quite a few Robopons' evolutions, particularly in the first game-Uggy is one example. Even more jarring if they evolved from something cute.
-   Each installment of the _Rune Factory_ series features a member of the De-Saint Coquille family who, aside from being a humongous Big Eater, have a noticeably gonkish design. They also tend to have adorable daughters who can be married to the player.
-   Gen-An Shiranui from _Samurai Shodown_ is so terrifically ugly that it is impossible to even tell his _species_. (He's not a tengu, and he's not an oni, but he definitely isn't human...)
    -   He's a follower of the dark back, and in the second game he's a zombie.
    -   There's also obese Texan ninja Earthquake, and then there's Kusaregedou, who's uglier than Gen-An and Earthquake combined, which is to be expected seeing that he's a Gaki, a type of spirit that's cursed to be eternally hungry for the things they did when they were alive, which in his case was cannibalism. Fittingly enough, he was also designed to be a combination of the above 2 characters.
-   Octavian the Eagle of _The Secret World_ is easily the ugliest character in the game - all the more startling considering he still qualifies as a human being and not some kind of demon. On top of being built like a bear and standing a head taller than any other character in the game, he has a immensely craggy face, complete with Perma-Stubble, a Lantern Jaw of Justice, a heavily-furrowed brow, an overly-wide and permanently-unsmiling mouth, and numerous old scars running across his eyebrows, lips and cheeks.
-   Jim from _Square's Tom Sawyer_, who has pitch black skin, beady white eyes, an orange afro, and huge caterpillar-like lips.
-   Rufus from _Street Fighter IV_, although as a martial artist, he's definitely in-shape (if you consider spherical a shape, that is).
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Wario and Waluigi: with their big pink noses, wicked mustaches, exaggerated bodily proportions, and perma grimaces; they resemble caricatures of Mario and Luigi more than anything. However, that's part of their charm.
    -   Mario himself was a gonk in _very_ early promotional artwork of the original arcade version of _Donkey Kong_. His design has long since evolved into something much cuter.
-   Most of the fighters in _Super Strip Fighter IV_ are, naturally, beautiful, scantily clad women with various fetish-related moves. All except for Jin Tendoh. He's the Fat Guy with the Big Lips and Pimply Nose. And yes, you can strip him.
-   _The Twins (2020)_: Bob and Buck are both very hideous, having odd shaped heads with Pointed Ears, long crooked noses, sunken eyes, and large, stretched lips, making them resemble goblins. Bob is even uglier than Buck, being bald and fat.
-   _Undertale_: Burgerpants looks like something out of _Ren & Stimpy_, frequently making deranged and ugly facial expressions that are taken straight out of his concept art.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles_:
    -   _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_, despite having a pretty attractive cast for the most part, has an example in Mumkhar. This is maybe to show he's Obviously Evil and the traitor of the Dunban, Dickson, and Mumkhar group of heroes. Dickson at least looks like a decent old man, and Dunban is easily one of the most attractive male characters in the game. Except Mumkhar isn't the only one who is a traitor...
    -   _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_ has Bana, the Chairman of the Argentum Trade Guild, who is a serious standout compared to the rest of the Nopon. Like Mumkhar, this was done to showcase his Obviously Evil nature.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   The games have otherwise normal to attractive characters with a few gonk moments, but special mention must go to eternally gonk Sal Manella, the sweaty otaku TV director, and perverted hospital "director" Hotti.
    -   Mike Meekins, the clumsy officer with a No Indoor Voice may not as be as ugly as Sal Manella or Hotti, but he's incredibly gonkish when compared to his fellow workers with his beady eyes and ridiculously big chin.
    -   Spark Brushel in _Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney_. The man looks more like a character from _Looney Tunes_, due to his Non-Standard Character Design.
-   _Danganronpa_:
    -   Hifumi Yamada from _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_. Being the only obese character, it's even more noticeable.
    -   The sequel has Teruteru Hanamura, who is stouter than the other males and has eyes that are drawn as two black blotches. They become normal if he's shocked, angry or lustful. He's also thought of as being funny-looking In-Universe.
    -   _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_ has Ryoma Hoshi, who, like Teruteru, is way shorter and almost plush-like in comparison to the rest of the males. His eyes are also a lot more circular in comparison to the others.
-   The artist for _Spirit Hunter: NG_ clearly had fun with Maruhashi's over-the-top, ridiculous expressions, none of which are flattering.

    Webcomics 

-   _Abnormality_ gives us Catwoman and Batman right here. Wonder Woman comes off as decently average. Superman is, well, whatever the hell THAT is.
-   Waluigi in _Brawl in the Family_ is particularly hideous among a cast of generally adorable characters.
-   _Bronze Skin Inc._: In addition to a disproportionate chin, Otto has a huge hump that doesn't fit his body, giving him the ugliest appearance of the characters.
-   Brida from _Furry Fight Chronicles_ is the Tendonchi Master of Pink Businesses, who is portrayed as a Perpetual Smiler with a tendency of making an exaggerated Wild Take after another.
-   On his first appearances, William Winsbury in _Gunnerkrigg Court_ is markedly uglier than the main characters, with his odd colouring and pointy teeth. After some Art Shifts, and as he becomes a less unsympathetic character, he gets rather more handsome.
-   Equius in _Homestuck_ wears a pair of shades with cracked lenses to hide some really huge bags under his eyes, has stringy hair, a set of broken teeth and tends to sweat a lot.
-   _Ménage à 3_ has a very pretty lead and secondary cast (of both sexes), one or two Hollywood Homely supporting characters — and Eulice, the downright simian landlady. (Though even she claims that she used to look like sex goddess DiDi.)
-   Turns up now and again in _Ow, my sanity_. Once lampshaded (most likely by coincidence) by having _**Nancy**_ actually get squicked enough into _feeling fear_.
-   Cuntons of _Vegan Artbook_ is noticeably uglier than any of the other main characters. This was completely intentional since Cuntons is a Take That! at someone the author hates and nothing more than a Hate Sink Straw Woman in and out of comic.
-   In _Weak Hero_, the prettiness of a character tends to denote how important they are to the story. Even with that said, recurring Mook Helmet's appearance stands out from the crowd. With his tiny black eyes, widely set mouth, and grey skin, he barely even looks human in some shots.

    Web Original 

-   Achievement Hunter made a Gonkish character for Kerry when he joined the team over _Grand Theft Auto V_ on the Xbox One. The reasoning being that he transferred his character from the 360 version to the Playstation 4 version.
-   Jerma985 once held a contest with Star of who can make an ugliest character in his 'Saint Rows 2'-Who is Uglier?'\\. YMMV on who won.
    -   Jerma encountered a a morbidly obese lady during 'Judge Jerma'. A lady so obese her neck is essentially non-existent with all the fat in her collarbone and her pot belly needed a wheel attachment to support as she was walking. She even had a 'Oh Yeah' caption printed on the back of the shirt so that Jerma can make his signature 'byeah' joke.
-   The Youtube gaming channel _Polygon_ has a highly popular "Monster Factory" section, in which the cast tries to create the most hideous character possible in a variety of games - and laughs their behinds off throughout.

    Western Animation 

-   Many characters from _The Adventures of Figaro Pho_ are designed this way, and treated as such In-Universe. For example:
    -   The mailman, adding to the many ways that he is the show's Butt-Monkey.
    -   Those Two Guys, who are bald, middle-aged men.
    -   The Monster Clown from the show's opening and "Fear of Clowns" episode.
    -   The bald old lady who runs the store.
-   _Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog_: Although Dr. Robotnik is the only major human character in the show, his bizarre, exaggerated face still stands out.
-   Most of the characters from _Adventure Time_ who don't quite fit in with the standard character design of the oUo face end up invoking this trope. Special mention goes to Xergiok, many of the monsters, the Tree Witch, and arguably, Lemongrab. In a show where most of the characters have very similar faces, the difference can be extremely jarring, and the gonks may not even appear to be from the same show.
-   In _Æon Flux_, Bambara is a pot-bellied man with bad teeth and an ugly face. This makes him stand out compared to the more normal-looking characters.
-   _American Dad!_: Apparently, Francine is hideous when she didn't bother to do her beauty regimen for two weeks. She stopped taking care of her appearance out of spite when Stan said he only appreciated her for her looks. Stan had to turn himself blind (and jobless) so he can tolerate living with her, which ultimately invoked an aesop proving both of them are just as shallow.
    
    **Roger ("Jeannie Gold"):** Alex, Ronnie, cut! Momma's not making a monster movie!
    
-   Beavis and Butt-Head are a rare main character example. They have _enormous_ foreheads, chins, and lips compared to the rest of the cast who are more realistically proportioned.
-   Warren, one of Bobby's friends from _Bobby's World_ is one of the ugliest kids featured on the show, he has both eyes on one side of his face, messy hair, a big pot belly that sticks out of his shirt, crooked teeth, and long pointed lips that look like a crocodile's jaws.
-   Pothole McPucker from _Camp Lazlo_, the hog mayor of the nearby small town of Prickly Pines with a nauseous appearance in a show with cute, simple character designs.
-   Ms. Endive from _Chowder_. She's much larger than any of the other characters with green hair, orange skin, and a long aardvark-like nose. All the other characters in the show seem to acknowledge this, too.
-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_ has a couple of examples, which are much easier to be identified with its numerous villains, but one representative for that show is **Eustace**, who's overall ugliness is aided by his physical features, including his signature big chin.
-   In the _Danger Mouse_ episode "The Spy Who Stayed In With a Cold," Agent 57 is assisting DM while Penfold is bedridden with a cold. DM asks 57 what he really looks like. Upon seeing it, DM wishes he hadn't asked.
-   In one of the later episodes of _Dexter's Laboratory_, Dexter attempts to give himself 40/40 vision to eliminate his need to wear glasses. It works in that he can see without his glasses, but he sees _so_ perfectly that everyone around him is now a horrifying caricature of how they normally look.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_:
    -   The Kanker sisters, who are the terrible trio of girls who often abuse the titular Eds rather amorously. However, Lee is the best candidate among her sisters for this trope, as Marie obviously falls more on Generic Cuteness, and May is more hugely on Ugly Cute. For Lee, her overall apearance, which includes her eyes being almost always covered by her hair, makes her look _very_ unappealing (even if she actually has very pretty eyes, which are only shown in a few occasions throughout the show).
    -   Ed, in the first season, albeit a more Downplayed example when compared to Lee, especially considering his normally joyful personality. Starting with season 2, he underwent Art Evolution to make him more stylized and less Ugly Cute; his head became a smoother, more simplified triangle shape, and his gums became less prominent when he would speak.
-   Yukk is the canine mascot of Mighty Man in Ruby-Spears' _Plasticman_ series. Yukk is so ugly he has to wear a doghouse over his face.
-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_:
    -   Duchess. Pretty much all the other friends are either straight-up cute (Mac, Bloo, Mr. Herriman) or at least Ugly Cute (Coco, Eduardo, Wilt). Duchess is _hideous_, looking like a nightmare example of a cubist painting: her body is literally two-dimensional, she has sickly yellowish-green skin, a nose like an elephant's snout, _a vertical mouth **and one of her eyes points the wrong way**_.
    -   Terrance is a human example. He was made to be as ugly as humanly possible, with the crooked teeth and the acne.
-   _Inside Job (2021)_: Glenn Dolphman was a part of a government experiment to make him a dolphin/human hybrid. The end result gave him a malformed, swollen face that juts out like a dolphin's. He's hideous to the point where his features make people believe him to be a child predator and a dating app's Sexiness Score ranked him as a zero on a scale of one to ten.
-   _Looney Tunes_: In "The Unmentionables", the guest at Rocky and Mugsy's party seem to be a homage to the deformed villains in _Dick Tracy_: they include Jack "Legs" Rhinestone (wearing ladies' socks on his legs), "Baby Face Half" Nelson (whose face is the size of his cigar end), "Pizza Puss" Lasagna (whose face looks like the surface of a pizza), "Pistol Nose" Pringle (whose nose is shaped like a pistol, and breathes out cigarette smoke), and "Teeth" Malloy (whose giant teeth take up his entire face).
-   _Mr. Bogus_: The huge and ugly Evil Knockoff of Mr. Bogus from "Computer Intruder" and "Bad Luck Bogus" is meant to resemble a rather hideous version of Bogus.
-   _My Little Pony_:
    -   _My Little Pony 'n Friends_: In "The Golden Horseshoes, Part 2", the goblin brothers are comically ugly — besides all being short, squat and green, one has broad and frog-like lips, another a projecting beaklike mouth, and the third a stump-like, flat-topped head with three small horns.
    -   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
        -   Snips and Snails (_especially_ Snips, who looks more like a buck-toothed piglet than anything equine). They're unicorns like some of the other mane cast but even among the colts of the series are pretty ugly, just barely bordering on Ugly Cute.
        -   Bulk Biceps, the insanely buff pegasus (with incredibly tiny wings), easily qualifies.
        -   The transformed Saddle Rager from _Power Ponies_ looks rather... grotesque to say the least. Masculine pectoral muscles, freakish proportions, and just the overall shape of it came off as fairly disgusting. Justified as, being the Equestrian equivalent of the Hulk, her transformed state is _meant_ to be massive and deformed.
        -   The last few seconds of the episode "Canterlot Boutique" feature an obese, almost misshapen pony (credited as "Incidental Pony" but nicknamed "Whoa Nelly" by fans and referred to as the "Love Yourself pony" among the show's animation staff) with a cutie mark of her own face as a customer looking for the Princess Dress. She makes cameo appearances in at least two other episodes as well.
        -   According to the Art Of Equestria Guidebook this was the intent with Queen Chrysalis, who was drawn differently to look "Gollum-esque and rotten, like she crawled out from under a log". It did _not_ translate that way in the actual show, where by pony standards she's actually pretty easy on the eyes and looks more like a gothic supermodel. Even her minions the changelings are Creepy Cute at absolute worst (and pretty darned adorable when they want to be).
        -   Discord is the clearest example. While he is supposed to have the head of pony, it's much longer than that of any of the cast with a sunken narrow section between the mouth and eyes, has a scraggly beard and overgrown eyebrows, and very asymmetrical complete with a snag tooth. Notably his appearance is supposed to be jarring in-universe as his mismatched parts represent disharmony.
        -   Oh _wow_ adult Twist. She looks like someone took Snails, beat him with a stick, and then recolored him. They actually just reused this character's model, but for whatever reason it just looked much worse with Twist's mane and glasses.
-   Bloth in _The Pirates of Dark Water_, although he may be intended to be some sort of ogre. To give you an idea: he has inhumanly pallid skin, an oversized snaggletoothed mouth with puffy blue lips (earning him the epithet "fish lips" at least once), his one functional eye is yellow and beady, the other is ruined by a scar, he lacks eyebrows, and he's bald with a stringy forked beard.
    -   Not just him either; the extreme divergence of body and facial types between natives of different islands makes for some **really** weird-looking people.
-   _Recess_: Randall Weems resembles a human-lizard hybrid.
-   _Samurai Jack_:
    -   **AKU**, the personification of evil all throughout the show, largely supported by his big sharp teeth.
    -   The Scotsman is not a pretty sight, but his wife is even bigger and uglier than he is, and considerably more angry. It gets funnier: it's shown in the Time Skip prior to Season Five that the pair have had a large number of daughters who are all amazonian _knockouts_.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Hans Moleman, the diminutive and impossibly wrinkly old man ("I'm 31 years old!") with enormously thick glasses and terrible luck. He earned his appellation from the production crew when they noticed how shriveled and unrealistic he was. According to a DVD commentary for one episode, a number of viewers were disgusted by Moleman's appearance, and he was reused in order to annoy those people.
    -   Moe the bartender looks like Randall from _Recess_ as an adult. He's often acknowledged to be this in-universe as well, as he's been described as made of "cauliflower ear, lizard lips, little rat eyes, caveman brow and fish snout". It was even admitted in the commentary for "Pygmoelian" that due to this trope, few people care if he's drawn Off-Model.
-   _South Park_:
    -   Subverted with Ugly Bob in "Not Without My Anus", who is by all accounts extremely hideous but is rendered with the same facial and bodily features as his fellow minimalistically-drawn Canadians.
    -   Played with in "How To Eat With Your Butt": Ben Affleck's head is made with a photo of the actual celebrity, but he is revealed to the the child of a couple with butts for faces.
        
        **Cartman:** "I guess now we'll have to call him Ben **Ass**fleck!"
        
    -   Sarah Jessica Parker in "The Tale Of Scrotie McBoogerballs": While every other character in the series has basically the same facial layout, her face is an ugly exaggerated caricature, as a Take That! to the real celebrity.
    -   "It's A Jersey Thing" delivers a similar Take That to Snooki, portraying her as a hideous rat-like creature.

-   _The Star Wars Holiday Special_: Han Solo in the animated segment. He looks nothing like Harrison Ford _or_ anyone else in the cartoon. Scroll down to the bottom of this page and compare Luke and Han.
-   Max from _Total Drama Pahkitew Island_. The writers have outdone themselves to make him as ugly as possible: An oversized head, grey skin, purple hair, a pig nose, and multiple chins.
-   Gorgeous Gal, a huge elderly featherless bird who wore a green dress, lots of jewelry and a white wig is supposed to be this in the _Woody Woodpecker_ short 'A Fine Feathered Frenzy.' When Woody sees her for the first time he turns white as a ghost and passes out. She even breaks a hand mirror by batting her eyelashes at it. Gorgeous Gal's face is actually rather cute like most cartoons of that era. She also flirts with the woodpecker with a sexy voice so not all members of the audience who view this cartoon find her completely unattractive. Woody however is not interested but she is much older than he is. Also compared to Gorgeous Gal he's about the size of a puppy. Gorgeous was still smitten and enjoyed lifting him up and forcibly pressing her giant red lips against his. She also marries him and makes love to him off-camera despite the woodpecker's feelings.

    Other 

-   Gaia Online decided to pull a fast one on the members when asking if they wanted cute child star Timmy to remain a child or become an adult. After the votes were tallied and adult Timmy was chosen, he was aged up as promised and turned into an incredibly ugly and gangly man with an enormous honker (while everyone was expecting yet another hot anime guy). One member actually responded by posting a smiley called "gonk". The adult look was based on H.I. "Hi" Mc Dunnough (Nicolas Cage) in _Raising Arizona_, and a surprisingly large number of users thought he was Hollywood Homely at worst. In-universe, he was able to charm a girl with a boyfriend (and got Doctor Singh into a catfight with said girl over him). Then again, there was Reapersun's Fan Disservice art of him in the man-thong from _Borat_...
-   Give the Freelance Astronauts access to a character creator and they'll make another horrifying incarnation of Dongs "REO" Speedwagon. In _Oblivion_ she was a crone-like, green-faced, blue-haired dark elf with butterfly wings and a penchant for bludgeoning people to death with a fish. In _Saints Row 2_ she was an obese, slack-jawed, blue-haired woman with poor posture and a man's voice who was so disturbing that Maxwell scrapped her for Gangsta Link. And now in _Mass Effect_ we have Dongs Shepard, with a man's head on a woman's body and something _seriously_ wrong with her neck.
-   One version of Major Lazer's "Keep It Going Louder" takes butterface to a whole new level.
-   One of the videos for Simian Mobile Disco's "Hustler" definitely gonks the girls out at the end. I guess that's what they get for eating so much...
-   Stephan Remmler of German rock band _Trio_ combined his Gonky looks with his German Humor as a Deadpan Snarker to comedic effect. He showed off his big jaw and ears, as well a goofy haircut and wide-eyed performance.
