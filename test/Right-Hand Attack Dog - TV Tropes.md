_"You've no doubt seen a dog lose its mind when a stranger comes near its home. That territorial instinct is multiplied as their territory expands. If a dog's home is several acres of farmland, it greets every visitor with primeval murderous instinct. Growing up, if we wanted to get home safely from the bus stop, we had to fill the weakest child with dog poison. An encounter between country dogs contains no comical ass sniffing — it's a snarling cartoon cloud of mortal combat."_

In contrast to the generally sedentary Right-Hand Cat and the common stereotype of Heroes Love Dogs, this is what happens when the villains' pet plays an active role as a guard/weapon against the heroes. Expect Fluffy the Terrible in terms of naming and for the villain to be a confirmed Fluffy Tamer. Typically, villains will either show a Nightmare Fetishist streak and be oblivious to how savage their pets are, and will treat them kindly, or else, they will use the pets to (perhaps even literally) Kick the Dog, sometimes by feeding underlings and other poor unfortunates to them. Finally, as the title suggests, when the creature in question isn't a fantasy animal, it's (not necessarily but) very likely to be some kind of canine (usually a Vicious Angry Guard Dog).

Dogs are very faithful and loyal to humans, and given most villains are humans, they also tend to own and love dogs as their loyal companions. As so, the dogs tend to have strong Undying Loyalty to them, and will follow the Diabolical Mastermind's orders. In addition, dogs are pack animals who are also very prone to attack strangers and random visitors due to their lineage, making them the perfect attack animals for the villains while retaining loyalty to them. Cats on other hand are solitary animals who can be fickle and sometimes can betray the villains' loyalty, so some villains don't see them fit.

Heroes who dare to mess with these dogs, on other hand, may receive full-on retribution from them.

May or may not be a Post-Apocalyptic Dog.

Contrast with the various heroic Loyal Animal Companions, particularly Heroic Dog. See also Canine Companion for a non-villainous, more-generic versions.

    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, you could recruit one as a full-fledged _party member_ (one of the Origins got him for free — the perks of aristocracy), and a lot of bad guys used them to tear your party apart when you got careless.
    -   In _Dragon Age II_, Hawke's Mabari was a summonable creature in a DLC — but nevertheless deadly.
-   _Fallout_
    -   Darion, the leader of a gang of Khan raiders holed up in Vault 15 in _Fallout 2_, will sic his Baddog on the player's party.

In battle, he'll occasionally block physical attacks directed at his master and then counterattack for massive damage. Outside of the actual gameplay, Shadow warns that he'll actually tear out your throat if you get too close. Relm seems to be able to play with him just fine though, and if Shadow is KO'd in battle, Interceptor will actually protect her instead. This is because Relm is Shadow's daughter, unbeknownst to her though.
-   _Final Fantasy VII_:
    -   Comic relief bad guy Don Corneo has some sort of bizarre ape-like monster named Aps under his Trap Door. Later in a sidequest in Wutai, Corneo replaces with it a dragonish monster. Both can be quite difficult bosses.

-   _Mega Man_:
    -   In the original _Mega Man X_, Sigma sics his dog Velguarder after you before pulling out his Laser Blade.
    -   Subverted in the _Mega Man (Classic)_ series, since you never fight Treble, except in his capacity as a Combining Mecha Super Mode Powered Armor for Bass. Played straight in _Mega Man X DiVE_, as there's playable a variant of Bass with Treble following him around and helping him.
-   Thurston and Roque from _Octopath Traveler II_ have Garnet. She seems to serve as their security dog, as Thurston sics her on Partitio for trespassing on company property, resulting in Partitio's second boss fight. In the post game, if you use any of the Path Actions that result in fighting NPCs on Roque, one of his "attacks" is to summon Garnet and have her fight that turn.
-   _Pokémon_:

    -   Zig-zagged with Giovanni's Persian, which is a Right-Hand Cat in the anime and a combatant in the Yellow version game.

-   _Batman: The Animated Series_:
    -   The Joker and Harley have a pair of savage hyenas which Harley (who refers to them as "the Babies") would cuddle with.
    -   Catwoman's cat Isis is usually more of a Right-Hand Cat, but she does take an active role in her debut episode, assisting a heist by slipping through a laser sensor grid — she can see the beams, and her small size and feline agility allow her to slip between them without tripping an alarm.
-   The Joker also had a pet hyena in _The New Adventures of Batman_ although much more comedic in nature and incredibly cute, named Giggles.
-   King Max has two mean evil dogs as pets in _The Biskitts_, probably as a contrast to the cute magical puppies that the show has for heroes.
-   Glum, the guardian dog of Cladestino in _The Bluffers_, unlike most examples Glum is good and only his loyalty to his owner makes him act as an antagonist.
-   Data 7 is this to Von Reichter for all of one episode in _Cyber Six_, until he realizes he is the titular character's brother.
-   The _Jonny Quest_ TOS episode "Dragons of Ashida". The title character has large lizards similar to Komodo dragons that he considers his pets. He uses them for hunting human beings and as security for his island.
-   The titular Mr. Pickles is Tommy Goodman's villainous border collie who kills animals and people For the Evulz. A rare case where the Right-Hand Attack Dog is a Villain Protagonist instead of his owner.
-   Big Bad of _Mummies Alive!_ Scarab has Ammut. Technically a lion-crocodile-hippo hybrid but acts like a dog and even barks.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Ahuizotl, the main villain of the _Daring Do_ series, has several great cats (and a small kitten) at his command to sic on meddling heroes in general (and Daring Do in particular).
-   Snag, Cyril Sneer's pet dog (albeit with an aardvark nose) in _The Raccoons_.

-   In _The Simpsons_, Mr. Burns has a pack of hounds which he likes to release on those who disturb him at home. There is an episode where Santa's Little Helper becomes one of his guard dogs, and in the end, he protects Bart against the rest of the pack.

**Mr. Burns**: Release the hounds.

-   Mumm-Ra in _ThunderCats_ has a very similar looking pet bulldog. Makes sense considering that his enemies are cats.
-   Evil Butler Snerdly, the Big Bad of the _Top Cat_ movie _Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats_ has a right-hand hound named Rasputin.

-   _Wakfu_: Season 1 Big Bad Nox has Igôle, a weird mix of wolf, hyena and lizard, that he sends chasing The Hero Yugo and his brother Adamaï, tasking it to bring them back "without damaging them too much". Note that Igôle was originally Nox's family pet 200 years ago, but exposure to the Eliacube and Xelor magic have turned it into a deadly powerful beast, and maybe as insane as its master. In the end it reverts to its past self and gives up the chase after meeting a little girl who reminds it of Nox's youngest daughter, and decides to stay with her.
-   Chase Young from _Xiaolin Showdown_ has an army of jungle cats he uses when he fights with the Xiaolin Dragons. It later turns out they were defeated warriors he took the powers from before turning them into big cats.
