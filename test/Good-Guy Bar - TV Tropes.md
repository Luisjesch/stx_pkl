_"You can drink your fancy ales,  
You can drink 'em by the flagon.  
But the only brew for the brave and true,  
Comes from the Green Dragon!"_

The heroic alternative of the Bad Guy Bar, the Good-Guy Bar is a place where heroes and do-gooders go to unwind after hours. Since the heroes might normally be on different squads or teams, the Good Guy Bar allows heroes who don't normally meet to do so, whether to talk shop or simply commiserate with like-minded peers.

Unlike the Bad Guy Bar, a Good Guy Bar can come in a wide variety of forms, whether a stereotypical seedy dive (complete with pool hall), a posh nightclub or a five-star restaurant. The more elegant locations will be used when the author wants to emphasize (or otherwise play with) the virtuous nature of the heroes. If the Good-Guy Bar spans time and space, it may double as an Inn Between the Worlds.

Many Good Guy Bars have an implicit agreement to allow villains to patronize, so long as they don't start trouble — after all, tolerance is traditionally a heroic virtue. Such places _will_ have a strictly enforced neutrality agreement to keep everyone from fighting each other. The lowest form might be Bad Guy Bars, located in Wretched Hives, and whose powerful proprietors enforce no-violence Truce Zones.

See You All Meet in an Inn for when this sort of establishment serves as the jumping-off point for an adventure. Subtrope to Local Hangout.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Cat_ features sweeper bars where they can trade information on targets.
    -   Cat Eyes' Café in _City Hunter_ and its sequel _Angel Heart_, previously owned by Black Cat's protagonists, becomes a main hangout and client meeting point in the series.
-   _Rebuild World_: In the gritty Cyberpunk setting of these novels, Shirakabe, a Sergeant Rock Private Military Contractor, spends his free time with some of his buddies from work at a bar in the slum’s Red Light District, on the second floor where the working ladies take men to the third floor. Shirakabe repeatedly invites the protagonist Akira there to discuss contracts, despite him being underage, which leads to Akira arguing with the bartender, and Shirakabe arguing with one of the working girls about that. After enough times of this, the bartender throws up his hands and just tells Akira where to find him.
-   In _The Seven Deadly Sins_, the Boar Hat serves as the base of operations for Meliodas and the Seven Deadly Sins. It's actually a mobile home carried on the back of Hawk's mom, a giant green pig, essentially making it a literal Boar Hat. Incidentally since the Sins are criminals in the setting, it can be seen as a Bad Guy Bar from a different perspective.
-   Agil of _Sword Art Online_ opens a café; specifically, in both MMOs and in real life, each becoming the main characters' meeting spots. In video game adaptations, his bar serves as the base and an inn.
-   _Tiger & Bunny_ has the aptly named "Hero's Bar" which is themed around Hero TV (the reality crime fighting show which the main characters star in) and Wild Tiger's favorite hero of old Mr. Legend.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_ has two such locations:
    -   Bruiser's Bar & Grill is a rowdy place run by a retired superhero that serves beer, popcorn and a spirited atmosphere for superbeings who want to hang out and indulge in some good-natured roughhousing.
    -   Butlers is a super-secretive club whose clientele and employees are tightly screened. Regular dinner parties are held where heroes arrive in formalwear for tranquil evenings together.
        -   Subverted in the story "Dinner at Eight"; when Samaritan and Winged Victory go out for dinner, they deliberately avoid established Good Guy Bars to get away from "shop talk". They use their civilian identities and go to a burger joint instead.
-   In the prologue to _Batman: The Dark Knight Returns_, many of the now-retired heroes and villains gather at an underground bar to reminisce about old adventures (Martian Manhunter is the bartender).
-   _Common Grounds_ is a limited series named after a chain of coffee shops, where superheroes and supervillains meet in a neutral, non-confrontational manner.
-   When Guy Gardner from DC Comics had his Vuldarian powers, he ran a superhero bar in New York called Warriors. After becoming a Green Lantern again, he relocated it to Oa as The Big W.
-   Time In A Bottle, the British supers' pub in Paul Cornell's _Knight and Squire_. Merlin's truce magic makes it a haven for heroes and villains. In the first issue an Anti-Hero disrupts the magic, leading to a Bar Brawl.
    -   In the final issue the heroes and villains work together to trick The Joker into entering. The Truce Magic doesn't prevent you stripping someone of weapons. And _then_ they turn it off...
-   The Oblivion Bar caters to magic users and is featured prominently in _Shadowpact_ as the team's headquarters since the owner of the bar is one of its members. While the Bar allows anyone from angels to demons entry, neutrality is _strongly_ encouraged. It helps that the bartender can telekinetically choke anyone who causes trouble.
-   Kadie's from _Sin City_. Not so much of a _Good Guy Bar_ as it is an _Anti-Hero Bar_ since the main protagonists, Marv and Dwight, frequent the establishment. Not to mention that this is where a few major side characters work as well. Additionally, it's known as a well-behaved bar, a rarity for Sin City, and likely the safest place in the city, period. This is because Marv really doesn't like it when someone bothers the girls.
-   _The Transformers (Marvel)_ UK comic book series introduced Maccadam's Old Oil House, a place where Transformers of all allegiances could indulge in black-market lubricants, gambling and gossip in (relative) peace. It has since appeared in every Transformers continuity in one form or another, culminating in an appearance in the _Transformers: Animated_ cartoon.
    -   It has a private room for dead Optimuses and Megatrons to hang out in during their dead time. They take turns using it, of course.
-   The Fourth Relaunch of the IDW Transformers Series uses this quite often. Bars are a positive place which seem to represent a social gathering free from all the millennium long conflict. Swerve opens one in _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_, wherein all the bots come together on the Lost Light to drink and get together. He even has the whole place armed after Whirl had a tantrum. Burr opens up a bar on Cybertron in _The Transformers: Robots in Disguise_ and in spite of the heated tensions between the Autobots Neutrals and Decepticons, they can all come here to chat and throw back some engex. When the anarchy sets in a few Bots, Cons and Neutrals all hole up to wait out the conflict. In _The Transformers: Dark Cybertron_: When there's a lull in the action, all the active Duty Decepticons and Autobots come together get drunk and start singing old war songs, when earlier they were shooting at each other. Blurr's bar carries over to _The Transformers: Windblade_ wherein all people from all factions still frequent it.
-   _Vader's Quest_: The second issue features a bar in the swamps of Dubrava (an Imperial-occupied world) where Jal Te Gniev can wear his uniform and talk about the Rebellion freely (albeit unflatteringly). When the Imperials show up after Jal and Nevana, several of the customers start shooting at them. The Imperials set the bar on fire, and it's unclear if anyone besides Jai escapes or is spared.
-   Clark's in the WildStorm Universe; the Expy owner won't serve anyone until they show secret ID.
    -   In the Wildstorm Universe, there's also the Wolfshead's Pub in London, where England's supernatural community like to meet. Superheroes are also welcome.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: During the Broke Episode when Diana starts working at a Taco Wiz in Boston by the end of the arc most of the Justice League of America, Justice Society of America and several Titans have started frequenting the place, making the villain who decided to try and attack a customer about ten feet from the door look insanely foolish even if he did make something like a black hole in the middle of the street.
-   _X-Men_: Green Lagoon in Krakoa and Red Lagoon in Arakko are examples of this.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Shady Trough_ in _Diaries of a Madman_ is one for the Night Guard.
-   Tapper's Tavern in _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_.
-   The looper bars in the _The Infinite Loops_ are this (even if the odd looping villain does show up) as they are places for loopers to talk and hang out with one another.
-   The Red Turtle in _The Return_, well protagonist's bar since it is a Grey-and-Gray Morality series.
-   _This Time Round_, the Doctor Who pub outside continuity, a meeting place for everything in the Doctor Who Expanded Universe — and every canon they've crossed over with.
-   _True Potential_: Naruto quickly turns the other members of Team 3 into fellow regulars at Ichiraku's, to where he also drags everyone of his foreign friends visiting Konoha. After the Time Skip, they also frequent the tea-shop owned by Naomi's parents.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Rick's Cafe Americain_ in _Casablanca_. It is also a Bad Guy Bar. Because _everybody_ goes to Ricks.
-   The Green Dragon in _The Lord of the Rings_.
-   _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ has the Terminal Station Bar, sort of. The Ink and Paint Club might also qualify.

    Literature 

-   The Bucket, the unofficial pub of the City Watch in _Discworld_. Being coppers, the Watch prefers to _avoid_ shop talk there, giving Mr. Cheese the quietest patrons on the Disc. Indeed, robbing the Bucket (especially when Angua is present) is legally classified as attempted suicide.
-   McAnally's Pub in _The Dresden Files_, which caters to both sides equally. The 'peaceful' side of things is enforced by it being a truce zone under Fae law. While _The Dresden Files_ _does_ have twinkly-wee Tinkerbell-type faerie, Fae law is written and enforced by the Queens. As in, Mab and Titania. Yes, _them_. Annoying them is NOT a good idea.
    -   One reason this example applies for this trope at all is that Harry Dresden has killed most of the bad guys who might go to McAnally's. Nearly every time he goes there, Harry notes that there are a lot of ways to mess with someone that don't break said truce, and that he almost often sits with his back to the wall.
    -   The second reason this example applies: The Chicago police department didn't sign the Accords. When a large gruff fae threatens Dresden in at Mac's, Sergeant Murphy points out that she is legally allowed to shoot him if he starts anything.
-   _Callahan's Place_, the focus of multiple novels, allows bad guys in as long as they behave themselves. Lady Callahan's place, which includes a bar and a lot more, has the same policy but it doesn't work out that way at all.
-   Talisman in _The Delta Drifters_. Lucia's friends and co-workers are seen playing poker there in the first chapter.
-   The vampire bar "The Raven" in the Toronto of _Forever Knight_. It's a neutral zone and a goth haven.
-   The Leaky Cauldron in the first few _Harry Potter_ books: The wizard pub to be in London, which doubles as the main entrance to Diagon Alley. It also was Harry's safe haven when he ran from the Dursleys weeks before his third year at Hogwarts. The Three Broomsticks is also this, to a lesser extent, mostly because it contrasts heavily with Hogsmeade's very own shady _Bad Guy Bar_, The Hog's Head... That actually _plays this straight_ in the later books, being one of the sites for secret Dumbledore's Army meetings at a time when Defense Against the Dark Arts was dumbed down heavily at Hogwarts. It goes _double_ when it's revealed that the owner is none other than Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus's estranged brother, who shelters and hides the main trio, and is a vital ally in the early stages of the Battle of Hogwarts.
-   Not a bar, per se, but Honor Harrington loves to take her crew to dine at Dempsy's. Though she usually foots the bill, as it is possibly the most expensive restaurant in the universe.
-   In _Last Call at the Nightshade Lounge,_ monster-hunting bartenders work at establishments like the titular Nightshade Lounge, and gay bar Long and Strong.
-   In _Myth-O-Mania_, Classical Mythology heroes either visiting or living in Calydonia hang out at the aptly-named "Heroes".
-   The Silver Bullet in _Newshound_ is one of these, catering almost exclusively to Phoenix's shapeshifters. Its status as a safe-space for lycanthropes makes it a regular meeting place for the local werewolf pack, who use it as their _de facto_ headquarters.
-   Milliways, _The Restaurant at the End of the Universe_. The patrons aren't all good guys, but nobody causes much trouble because they are all there to see the show. It's also implied that the Big Bang Burger Bar at the other "end" of the universe is one as well.
-   The Hole In The Wall tavern in _Septimus Heap_, where several meetings of the characters occur.
-   The Star Trek Novel Verse "Captain's Table" novels use one as a framing device; the Captain's Table is an Inn Between the Worlds that only captains (of any type of vessel) are able to enter. Drinks are "paid" by having the captain tell a story to the other patrons.
-   _Sten_ has The Western Eating Parlor II, which is a Shout-Out to the clandestine savvy.
-   The Inn in Longfellow's _Tales of a Wayside Inn_ poetry collection where the characters gather to tell tales.
-   _Trail of Lightning_ has Grace's All-American bar, a de facto good-guy hangout because the heavily armed proprietor can fend off corrupt law enforcement officers.
-   The Ace of Trumps from _Wild Cards_.
    -   And, up to the Ti Malice arc, the Aces High restaurant.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Caritas on _Angel_ caters to good, evil and neutral folks alike, be they human or non-human. Popular for the drinks and the psychic karaoke. It had magical protection to enforce neutrality; no demon (non-human, including vampires) could perform an act of violence without the sanctuary spell knocking them on their ass first. Unfortunately, a demon-hunting gang of humans realized it didn't work on _humans_. After that loophole was closed, Holtz realized that it didn't prevent you from rolling a barrel bomb down the stairs into the bar..
-   Several establishments on _Babylon 5_, most notably Earhart's (reserved for EarthForce personnel and their guests), the Eclipse Cafe (part of The Zocalo, the station's marketplace), and the Fresh Air Cafe (a fancy restaurant).
-   P3 in _Charmed_, a nightclub owned by the protagonists. Often episodes will end with a scene of the sisters unwinding from their latest demon-hunting exploits.
-   Molly's in the _Chicago_ franchise. It's actually _owned_ by some of the firemen, but it can regularly be seen on all three shows and frequently scenes where a regular from one show is guest-starring on another will be set there.
-   Joe’s in _Highlander_. It was common to find Duncan, Methos and/or Richie in there in later seasons.
-   The Waterfront Bar in _Homicide: Life on the Street,_ which was also the staff hangout.
-   The Royale in _Killjoys_.
-   _Leverage_ had John McRory's Place, an Irish pub in Boston, in Seasons 2 to 4; and BridgePort Brewery, a brewery in Portland, in Season 5. Notable in that BridgePort is a real brewery that was used as a filming location for the show.
-   The Railway Arms, for _Life On Mars_ and Luigi's, for _Ashes to Ashes (2008)_.
    -   In the finale of _Ashes to Ashes (2008)_, the Railway Arms is a _really_ good guy bar — it's the gateway to Heaven.
-   The Dal Riata, the Fae bar in _Lost Girl_. Explicitly declared to be neutral ground for both Light and Dark Fae, and kept that way by The Ash, an extremely high-ranking Fae who also happens to own the place.
-   The _King Kamehameha Club_ in _Magnum, P.I._
-   _Midnight Caller_ has Carmen's, where Jack hangs out with Billy after work and meets up with Deacon and Zymak to share information.
-   The Trutone in _NCIS: New Orleans_.
-   The British sitcom _No Heroics_ takes place in The Fortress, a superhero bar with three rules: "No Masks, No Powers and No Heroics". The show also mentions The Stronghold, a Bad Guy Bar equivalent.
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: Marty's Malt Shop is the usual hangout for teachers and students alike, outside school.
-   _Power Rangers_ had the Angel Grove Juice Bar for the first few seasons, and many of the later seasons had a similar equivalent. This trope is also sometimes used in _Super Sentai_, such as the "Dinosaur Curry Bar" in _Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger_. It's become a minor Running Gag for team-up movies to mention the curry house, suggesting there's at least one Ranger / ally on every show who's visited it.
-   Another example is the bar Sam Beckett finds himself in during the last episode of _Quantum Leap_.
-   The German series _Raumpatrouille_ series has the Starlight Casino, where fleet and GSD personnel of all ranks congregate to chat, flirt, talk shop and dance in some very odd "futuristic" dances. The _Orion_ crew can usually be found here off-duty and has a fleet-wide reputation for its alcohol intake. The Starlight has a glass roof through which you can see the tropical fish in the sea above.
-   The Dirty Robber from _Rizzoli & Isles_. Starts out as a stereotypical cop bar with cheap beer, stiff shots and crappy wine, changes ownership and flirts with gourmet aspirations to the horror of the Homicide crowd, and ends up owned by Korsak, staffed by Angela, and remade _again_ into a somewhat classier cop bar (with a much improved wine selection in honor of Maura's tipple of choice).
-   _Rookie Blue_ has The Black Penny, where all the cops hide out after each episode.
-   _Star Trek_:

-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
    -   Quark's bar, though it was more of a neutral location.
    -   Near the end of the series, the Holosuite ran Vic Fontaine's Las Vegas Lounge 26 hours a day.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_:
    -   The Mess Hall was the equivalent of _TNG_'s Ten Forward, though Tom Paris would go on to create many recurring holographic bars over the years.
    -   Chez Sandrine was a recurring holodeck recreation of a bar in Marseille which was the first of many holographic Good Guy Bars
    -   Early on in the series, a Polynesian resort was used as the Good Guy Bar in several episodes.
    -   Later into the series, the holodeck representation of Sullivan's pub in the Irish town of Fair Haven ran 24/7.

-   The Road House in _Supernatural_ is a place where the good guys meet; given the ambiguous morals of the protagonists, it might be closer to a Bad Guy Bar instead.
-   _Tales of the Gold Monkey_ has the titular Gold Monkey Bar, which also served at various times as the Local Hangout, Bad Guy Bar, and/or Wretched Hive.
-   The Watchfire in _Tracker_ was where Mel and Cole, the protagonists, lived and Cole had his base of operations. It turned out to have a few other secrets as well by the series end.
-   _Walker, Texas Ranger_ has C.D.'s Bar and Grill, which is owned and operated by the eponymous Ranger's former partner-turned-restauranteur C.D. Parker.
-   _The Wire_ has Kavanagh's, the bar where McNulty and Bunk regularly go to drink, and where the Irish wakes are held. Based on a real Baltimore pub.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _Champions_ setting traditionally has Sanctuary, an entire fancy club for superheroes turned full-blown independent island resort after an edition change and the destruction of the original facilities. Supervillains can be members as long as they behave themselves on the club grounds and even find a measure of refuge there (as can _heroes_ in trouble with the law, which is how the policy originally came about); Sanctuary itself doesn't condone super-crime, but acknowledges that things may always be more complicated than they appear at first glance.
-   The Inn of the Last Home in _Dragonlance_, later on run by two Heroes of the Lance and their descendants.
-   The World Serpent Inn mentioned in several _Forgotten Realms_ sourcebooks was built in its own demiplane by an archmage from Toril, Arcane and Illithid as a neutral ground when Sigil turned out to be too violent and inconvenient for quiet business and rest. Not only is it connected to many worlds, but (unlike Sigil) is accessible to powers, and some gods visit it to relax and chat with creatures they deem interesting. It's a Good-Guy Bar since no one wants to annoy peacefully grazing deities, and some clients in a common room _can_ turn out to be gods on a tea-break. And even if there aren't any, The Bartender is an avatar himself — if some god just likes to meet new people and thinks it's funny, why not?
    -   In the _Forgotten Realms_ setting, the Old Skull Inn in Shadowdale is one of the most famous pubs in Toril; it's known for the honesty of its staff, and many groups of legendary heroes got their start here. Elminster himself, Shadowdale's most famous resident, has been seen here occasionally. There is also the Yawning Portal inn in Waterdeep, which while not strictly a good guy bar is very much a bar for _adventurers_ — the Yawning Portal had one of the most convenient entrances to Undermountain, Waterdeep's premier dungeon, and was owned by a retired adventurer powerful enough to ensure anyone wanting to cause trouble better wait until they took the trip down to Undermountain.
-   "Chez Régis" in _In Nomine Satanis_/_Magna Veritas_, where angels and demons can drink without fighting each other.
-   _Brubecks_ in _Traveller_.
    -   In the volume _Sword Worlds_ it describes soldier's clubs in which Sword Worlder humans and Aslan in Darrian service meet and tell yarns. The two groups come from states that tend to end up on opposing sides but when there is no war on, they often meet and mingle.
-   The C&C Club in _Freedom City_ appears to be a very exclusive Smoky Gentlemen's Club which doesn't reveal the criteria by which membership is offered, but in fact caters for costumed adventurers, with the full name secretly being "Cape and Cowl". Costumes are prohibited, but masks are permitted.

    Video Games 

-   Mad Moxxi's various establishments in the _Borderlands_ universe are this, and vary greatly in quality. The seediest, yet most overtly heroic would be her bar in _Borderlands 2_, serving the Crimson Raiders, Vault Hunters, and various citizens of Sanctuary. Leave big enough tips to help pay for bar expenses and she'll offer some custom submachine guns she has hidden somewhere in her cleavage.
-   _City of Heroes_ has Pocket D, an extradimensional club where heroes, villains, and regular people can all go and hang out — sort of a demilitarized zone, a la _Casablanca_. It's part tiki bar, part casino, part rave and part handy cross-town teleport station, among other things. It even features a miniature ski resort during the holiday season.
-   _Deep Rock Galactic_ has the Abyss Bar, the number one (and only) stop on the Space Rig for dwarves that are coming from or going to a mission. It has a decent jukebox, a toss-the-barrel game and a _ton_ of different beers. Plus a medbay nearby in case someone drinks way too much, which is a given considering these are dwarves and the beers go from mild to lights out with one pint.
-   The _Fallout_ franchise often features decent bars and restaurants to go with the Bad Guy Bars.
    -   _Fallout_ has the Skum Pitt in Junktown. The name sounds scary, but it's actually a respectable establishment. The bar owner Neal is willing to protect his waitress Trish by shooting dead the thug harassing her, and it's where you can recruit Desert Ranger Tycho to help you in your adventure.
    -   The Den of _Fallout 2_ is a complete Wretched Hive of lawlessness, but there is always the honest and respectable casino and bar run by Becky and the diner run by Mom. In the Den's good ending, Becky takes over and the Den prospers.
-   _Far Cry 5_ has two:
    -   The first is the Spread Eagle bar run by Mary May Fairgrave. She's in charge of the good guys in the Holland Valley region, and after Deputy Hudson is rescued, she'll be there as well.
    -   The second is the 8-bit Pizza Bar in the Henbane River. All Guns for Hire that are not accompanying the player will gather there, and they will go there if the player dismisses them from the active party.
-   The _Fatal Fury_ series has the Pao Pao Cafe, run by Richard Meyer. It's where you fight Richard in the first game and his protege Bob in the games following. Later games also have Duck King's nightclub.
-   _Final Fantasy XIII_ features the NORA house, a popular beach bar which also functions as the base of operations for the anti-establishment "NORA" gang led by Snow Villiers.
    -   In _Final Fantasy XIII-2_, "NORA" builds an identical bar in the town of New Bodhum since the original town was rendered uninhabitable due to the Purge and later the fall of Cocoon.
-   _Final Fantasy XIV_ has one of these in each of its main cities, doubling as the local Adventure Guild. It's the first place you go after finishing the introductory cutscene.
-   Telma's Bar in _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_. Inside are a bunch of hapless soldiers that stand around all day doing nothing but also La Résistance meets up there and offers advice to Link.
-   Each of the _Mass Effect_ games has at least one of these. _Mass Effect_ has the Embassy Bar and Flux (contrast with Chora's Den), _Mass Effect 2_ has Eternity on Illium and the Dark Star on the Citadel (contrast with Afterlife on Omega), and _Mass Effect 3_ has Purgatory (this time with no Bad Guy Bar equivalent). True to the "letting villains in" part of the trope, Purgatory ends up being the new "home" of Aria T'Loak, now-former pirate queen of Omega. She finds it "too uptight" for her tastes.
-   The unnamed bar in Sony's live-action "Michael" commercial, where both heroes and villains who have appeared on the Playstation 3 hang out and talk about how the player of their games (Michael) helped them in their adventures.
    -   This bar reappears in "The All-Star," an advertisement for _Playstation All Stars Battle Royale_, showing that the bar hosts battles between its patrons, with one between Nathan Drake, Cole MacGrath, Sackboy, and Kratos being the focus.
-   _Persona_:
    -   The Investigation Team of _Persona 4_ meets up at the Junes Food Court before going into the TV World. They even refer to it as their official hideout after several meetings. Justified since the TV in the electronics section of the store is their go-to entrance since it would be too dangerous to use another TV as the entrance since they don't know where they'll end up, and Teddie set up the only known exit back to the real world there.
    -   Cafe LeBlanc gradually evolves into one of the the Phantom Thieves of Hearts in _Persona 5_. Initially, it's just the place that Joker lives at. However, the other Thieves take a shine to the place and they eventually start hanging out there more often. By the time of the endgame, Sojiro lets the Thieves close down the cafe during regular hours to use it as their hideout since Joker has to lay low after Faking the Dead.
-   There's one in _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky_ as it adds in Spinda's Cafe, which is where your party hangs out before missions. Apparently, it must have a very high ceiling since giants such as Dialga and Groudon can comfortably sit at the table; somehow. Strangely enough can also be an example of an invited villain, since you can recruit and invite in Darkrai without anyone saying a word.
-   In _Shin Megami Tensei IV_ and _Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse_, both K's Tavern in the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado and the Hunter Association Bars in Tokyo fulfill this role.
-   _Skies of Arcadia_ has a few; a hidden one in the bowels of Pirate Isle, the tavern on Sailors Island but the best one is when you can build your own on Crescent Isle and find your own crew just chilling out.
-   _StarCraft II_: the cantina on the Hyperion, complete with an arcade machine and a jukebox hanging from the ceiling. Raynor is in another bar in the beginning on Mar Sara and it looks like said bar is actually _his headquarters._ Of course, since he has only a handful of troops on-world and his staff is literally a holographic head in a box, he doesn't need much.
-   The _Yakuza_ series has Serena and New Serena as a typical hideout for Kiryu and his friends that typically serves as a Player Headquarters. _Yakuza: Like a Dragon_ has the Survive Bar, which serves the same purpose for the new protagonists and is where Companion Specific Sidequests usually kick off.

    Web Animation 

-   _How It Should Have Ended_ has the Super Cafe and the Villain's Pub. As well as the Anti-Hero Food Truck, where Deadpool and The Punisher hang out with characters like Rambo and Machete.

    Web Comics 

-   _Bar'd_ takes place in such a bar. It's of the type that allows villainous people to patronize, so long as they don't start a fight...which unfortunately happens more often than the staff would like. It's a good thing they hired a centaurian nocturn for a bouncer.
-   _The Cross Time Cafe_ webcomic exists to let webcomic characters meet up outside their own continuity.
-   _League of Super Redundant Heroes_ has the Bar of Justice, which is frequented by the heroes of Shitropolis as a place to hang out and unwind. It's also staffed by an invisible bartender, Invisiblo.
-   God and Satan are patrons in _Mandatory Roller Coaster_
-   Mr. Poole owns and runs The Old Shoe bar in _MK's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde_
-   Ridley's Bar from _Planet Zebeth_.

    Web Original 

-   In _Star Harbor Nights_ one of the main characters is taken to one by a fellow superhero, after fleeing from a burning church.

    Web Videos 

-   _Hero House_ gives us Prime's Place, where all are one. Suitably, Optimus Prime himself serves as the bartender.
-   _I'm a Marvel... And I'm a DC_: Parodied; there are two bars. Stan's for the heroes and an unnamed bar for the villains. Apparently villains are welcome at the hero bar if they don't cause trouble (Magneto plays chess with Charles in one of the early episodes), but not the other way around.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Codename: Kids Next Door_, there's Lime Ricky's, a speakeasy that was opened after the adults made soda illegal for kids under the age of 13, complete with a soda-addicted villain named Mr. Fizz acting as an evil version of Eliot Ness. Numbuh Two beat his ass good, but whether they put him out of business for good isn't clear; one thing for certain: Lime Ricky's was still in business in a later episode.
-   _Disney's House of Mouse_ is a G-rated version. It also lets in villains, so long as they refrain from any villainy.
-   Kelso's in _Recess_ is another G-rated example, where T.J. and his friends go to have soda or milkshakes.
-   The Weenie Hut from _SpongeBob SquarePants_.
    -   The Krusty Krab tends to be a regular gathering place for everyone besides Plankton.
-   "Louie's" from _TaleSpin_. Gains extra awesome points for being a giant tree on a tiny island, accessible only by seaplane.
-   The Comet Club from the animated version of _The Tick_.
-   In _Winx Club_, the Winx and Specialists hang out in the Frutti Music Bar in Seasons 4-5.
-   An early Cartoon Network interstitial featured a cafe frequented by noted cartoon second bananas such as Robin and Boo Boo Bear, where they tout no shame in being a cartoon sidekick.

    Real Life 

-   In World War II Allied officers in North Africa would use Shepheard's Hotel for this purpose. The Royal Hawaiian did the same for American submariners in the Pacific; in fact the Comsubpac, Admiral Lockwood arranged to have it on reserve for the Navy as a way to be A Father to His Men.
-   London Coffeehouses in the eighteenth century were places like this. Though they primarily served coffee rather than strong drink and thus were not bars in the strictest sense.
-   Many large military installations will have bars nearby that are largely frequented by military personnel. Some places will have entire business districts set aside for doing business with them. Whether they are Good Guy Bars or Bad Guy Bars will depend largely on your opinion of the military personnel, and how well or poorly they behave when out partying it up.
-   Depending on your taste, the Local Hangout in your hometown may be this, where the atmosphere is welcoming, the music is good, the patrons are interesting (when they behave), and the staff is friendly and ready with "The Usual" when you walk in the door. Conversely, other places that serve a social group you don't fall into may seem like the Bad Guy Bar.
