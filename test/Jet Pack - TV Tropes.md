Asbestos-lined pants and boots are optional upgrades.

_"Jetpack is useful for quick escapes. Always keep a reserve in the fuel tanks."_

A standard piece of equipment for anyone from The Future or for secret agents, a Jet Pack is a back-mounted item that uses jet propulsion to allow the wearer to fly. Strangely enough, despite them almost always being portrayed as having streams of fire (or occasionally rings of Pure Energy for more futuristic models) coming out the exhaust, nobody ever suffers Toasted Buns as a result. Nor do most ever run out of fuel, or even consume any in the first place.

Also covered here are Rocket Boots and rocket packs, which can be ideal for robots, cyborgs, and androids with trumpet limbs.

Due to its ubiquitous appearances alongside the Flying Car as a predicted technological advance, it's one of the reasons why people declare I Want My Jet Pack (the main reason we _don't_ have them, by the way, is the complete lack of protection for when you crash into something).

A Sub-Trope of Flight and Awesome Backpack. Not quite related to Stupid Jetpack Hitler, although Nazis with jetpacks may be involved there as well. Compare Helicopter Pack and Jump Jet Pack.

Strangely never accompanied by an additional jetpack on the _chest_, which would logically be required for horizontal flight (if the jetpack does not have wings) for the same reason that you wouldn't want to wear just one paraglider strap or one jet _boot_.

-   _Iron Angels_: The third movie of the trilogy culminates with its protagonist, Alex, and his sidekick piloting jetpacks with twin-gatling guns attached, which allows them to mow down hordes and hordes of mooks within seconds.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   James Bond uses a jet pack to escape to top of a building at the beginning of _Thunderball._ Bonus points for this _not being a special effect_, but was an actual flight by a Bell Aerosystems Rocketpack provided for use in the film by the US Air Force (see the Real Life section below).
    -   This same jetpack that appeared in _Thunderball_ makes a cameo in _Die Another Day_.
-   Used by the dwarf secret agent hero in the Filipino _James Bond_ parody _For Y'ur Height Only_. Given his lack of stature, he probably found it more necessary than most.
-   _J-Men Forever_: Rocket Jock (a re-dubbed Commando Cody) mutters constantly about the problems of using his atomic-powered jetpack, including the worry that his tailor might have forgotten to include the lead-lining, the need to hit his springboard in order to launch himself into the air, sore arches whenever he lands, his feet setting on fire, and the risk of drowning inside his full-face helmet should he get airsick.
-   _Kick-Ass_ has the main character saving Hit-Girl by flying into the scene with a jetpack with mounted Gatling Guns that she and her father bought over the internet previously and unleashing Glorious More Dakka upon the Mooks. While set to Elvis Presley singing "Glory, Glory Hallelujah".

    -   Iron Man's armors include repulsors in the legs and hands that allow him to fly.
    -   _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_: Sam Wilson (a.k.a. the Falcon) is a former USAF Pararescuer. His flight suit is basically a jetpack with wings, and it doesn't work after the wings are torn off during the final battle — Sam has to deploy a parachute to land safely.
    -   _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_: Quill (a.k.a. Starlord) uses rocket boots, and in the sequel the Guardians are using jetpacks (except for Drax the Destroyer, who complains that the chest strap hurts his sensitive nipples).
-   A jetpack inexplicably turns up in the fantasy-comedy film, _The Mermaid_, as one of the various gadgets developed by Liu's company.

-   _Minority Report_: PreCrime enforcement units use jet packs.
-   In _RoboCop 3_, Murphy gets his hands on a prototype jet pack to aid him in foiling bad guys.
-   _The Rocketeer_:
    -   Despite the name, this _was_ a jetpack rather than a rocket, since it was fueled by alcohol but carried no oxygen to combust it with. Here, the hero stopped Hitler from creating an army of flying Nazi stormtroopers that would conquer America — and the world.
    -   Hell, the first time they fire it up you can see an air intake fan start to move under the housing. _Everything_ we're shown in the movie marks the device as a Jetpack, but _everyone_ in the movie keeps calling it a "Rocket" — even Howard Hughes, who built it and presumably knows the proper name.
-   _The Running Man_: A jet pack is used by the Stalker named Fireball.

-   In the 1979 Disney comedy _A Spaceman In King Arthurs Court_, the eponymous astronaut has a lunar rover, the seat of which can blast off with the aid of booster rockets and clearly visible wires. He uses it to rescue the fair maiden and give King Arthur airborne support when Mordred's army attacks his castle.
-   _Spy Kids_ has Machetes' BuddyPacks. Both are in use by the heroes and villains, of course. Carmen uses one to pursue the villains to recover the Third Brain. While trying to escape, Juni accidentally activates a stray BuddyPack that causes one of the villains to get her hair burned off by the flames shooting out of pack's exhaust pipe.

    -   In _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_, Spock steals a "thruster suit" — a space suit with a rocket backpack — so that he can reach V'ger's inner chamber. Kirk uses a second such suit to meet Spock and bring him back aboard after V'ger sends him back.
    -   Spock has rocket boots (Spocket boots?) in _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_.
-   _Star Wars_
    -   Both Fetts have jetpacks, and both of them fail them in one way or another. Since they wear armor, it's at least justified why they never get burned.
    -   The Star Wars Expanded Universe has a very select cadre of (non-Mandalorian) mercenaries with jetpacks, also armored. There are also several varieties of clonetroopers and stormtroopers with jetpacks, each with different appellations like jet trooper, airtrooper, and Rocket Trooper. Since at least one of those was developed for a tabletop game, the type of jetpack troopers use comes with restrictions like fuel and where it can or can't be used.
    -   Raises Fridge Logic issues, as repulsor-field technology otherwise suggests that jetpacks are obsolete as a means of aerial propulsion. Justified by Rule of Cool and as an homage to sci-fi tradition. It is noted in a few places that Repulsor packs are not small and are not efficient when they are small. Even droids that use them don't use them constantly, because it drains their batteries. And really heavy loads still use wheels or legs to support them.
    -   Granted, Boba's is probably nostalgic, because it belonged to his father. Mandalorians as a whole are traditionalist, since they made the art of bounty hunting they don't like people taking different approaches by altering the core of their tactics (flamethrowers, wristblades and personal missiles in a world with laser everything-else).
    -   One of the clone troopers is called Commander Cody in a homage to the original Rocketman.
    -   In _Attack of the Clones_, we suddenly discover that R2-D2 is equipped with leg rockets.
    -   In _The Rise of Skywalker_, stormtroopers are revealed to have been issued with jetpacks (to the dismay of the heroes) but they turn out to be Awesome, but Impractical (a stormtrooper's aim isn't any better whilst flying and they crash with nice fiery explosions).
-   In the Failure Montage that opens _Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines_, Red Skelton is seen trying a crude 1910s version twice. Both times it ends with an Epic Fail.
-   In _Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen_, Optimus uses Jetfire's parts to form a jetpack for a time.
-   _Winner Takes All_ has a finale involving a jetpack jousting duel between the two heroes (respectively a Gentleman Thief and a Cowboy Cop) and their main nemesis, a Japanese assassin, while hovering on top of electrified floor panels. It sounds awesome on paper, but unfortunately because some Special Effects Failure (and for most of the fight the camera doesn't show what's below the three characters' feet) it's painfully obvious that all three combatants are fighting on a raised platform instead of _actual_ jetpacks.

    Literature 

-   The pulp novel _Armageddon 2419 AD_, best known as the original source of the comic strip _Buck Rogers_, is the Ur-Example of a jetpack in modern fiction <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .

-   Isaac Asimov's _The Tercentenary Incident_: Lawrence Edwards begins the story with a flotron motor worn on his back, using it to hover two hundred feet above the crowd during the 300th anniversary of America's Declaration of Independence.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The Saturday morning kid's show _Ark II_ used the "Jet Jumper" in practically every episode. It was a genuine, working jet pack flown by a stuntman. You can tell it was real by how huge and bulky it was, compared to more typically-streamlined Hollywood portrayals.

-   _The Mandalorian_:
    -   In "The Sin", the other members of the Mandalorian covert enclave arrive for their Big Damn Heroes moment by jet pack, and Paz Vizla briefly flies after the _Razor Crest_ to salute him. It's not explained why the Mandalorian doesn't have one of his own, but he wants one.
        
        **The Mandalorian:** _\[after Paz Vizla flies off\]_ I gotta get one of those.
        
    -   He finally gets the desired Equipment Upgrade in the Season One finale, though the Mandalorian Armourer cautions our hero that he must train with it first as he hasn't used one since he was a foundling trainee. As it turns out circumstances force him to use it a lot sooner in a battle with a TIE fighter.

    **The Cat:** I say let's get into the jet-powered rocket pants and Junior Birdman the hell out of here.  
    **Kryten:** An excellent and inventive suggestion, sir, with just two tiny drawbacks. A, we don't have any jet-powered rocket pants, and B, there's no such thing as jet-powered rocket pants outside the fictional serial "Robbie Rocket Pants".  
    **The Cat:** Well, that's put a crimp on an otherwise damn fine plan.

-   _Battletech_:
    -   Specially trained "Jump infantry" with jetpacks formed some of the least useless unarmored units in the original game, though their mission was frankly suicidal: to fly in, swarm huge mechs and hope to plant explosive charges before you were swatted like the vermin that, to the mech pilot, you resembled. Armored infantry also had jetpacks, a similar attack and a higher survival rate, but both were nearly useless in any area with clear fields of fire.
    -   Certain BattleMechs had jump capability themselves, allowing a "Death From Above" attack on other mechs which, in the original rules, allowed EVERY ENEMY MECH within range a free shot before your mech slammed into your target mech, hopefully mashing its head, and everyone fell down.
-   _Carcosa: Weird Science-Fantasy Horror Setting_. Among other high tech items, the space aliens on the planet Carcosa have jet packs.
-   _Champions_ supplements:
    -   _Gadgets!_. The Rocket Pack allows powered flight at a speed of 65 m.p.h. in combat and 130 m.p.h. out of combat, with a maximum flight duration of 1 hour.
    -   _Enemies_. The supervillain Lazer uses a jet pack which allows him to fly at 65 m.p.h. Interestingly, it is powered by his own Endurance rather than an onboard fuel supply.
    -   _Enemies II_. The supervillain Death Commando, a member of Deathstroke, has a jump pack that allows him to fly up to 40 meters before having to be re-charged.
    -   Organization Book 2 _PRIMUS and DEMON_. After DEMON steals the Earth Crown of Krim from PRIMUS headquarters, a Morbane (supervillain) wearing a jet pack flies with it to the local DEMON base.
-   Iron Crown Enterprises' _Cyberspace_ RPG has jet packs for police, military and corporate use. They can reach over 60 k.p.h. and are controlled by extended handgrips. Some models can be controlled through cyberware.
-   _DC Heroes_ has a jet pack that allows the wearer to fly at 100 m.p.h.
-   _Encounter Critical_. One of the items that can be purchased is a jet pack. It allows flight at a speed of 20" (by comparison, human ground movement speed is 7") and has a 23% chance of being defective. Another item on the equipment list is a Contra-Gravity Belt that doubles the jet pack's speed. The Combat Gravbelt in the _Asteroid 1618_ supplement triples jet pack speed.
-   _GURPS_:
    -   _GURPS Ultra-Tech_ has a nuclear jet pack that lets out a torrent of irradiated plasma below it. It's cool but neither particularly safe nor stealthy.
    -   _GURPS Supers_ supplement _Supertemps_. The heroes Clone and New Javelin each have a jet pack that allows them to fly.
-   The _Hollow Earth Expedition_ main rules and the supplement _Secrets of the Surface World_ has jet packs as a possible Artifact Resource for characters. They have a speed of 100 m.p.h. If the wearer carries another person, top speed is cut in half and maneuverability is reduced.
-   _It Came from the Late, Late Show II_ adventure "Bjorn on the Bayou, or Escape from Alkatrazz XII". Alkatrazz XII is a prison planet. The cyborg warden Skrank and his bodyguard Jorj have jet packs as part of their standard equipment.
-   _Judge Dredd_, _White Dwarf_ magazine #88 adventure "A Night in the Death of Sector 255". If the Judges attack the Big Bad Grag Peppard in his candy factory, he will try to escape using a jet pack.
-   _Laserburn Sci-Fi Combat Rules_ (1980). In combat, jetpacks allow long, low leaps from cover to cover. They are normally used by assault troops, either for moving into close combat range or for a quick getaway. They're powered by chemical fuel cannisters.
-   _Maid RPG_. A Rocket Pack is in the Great List of Items, so it can be used by maids.
-   TSR's _Marvel Super Heroes_, _Uncanny X-Men_ boxed set Adventure Book. At the end of Chapter 9 "Let the Game Begin", if the heroes don't find Arcade within 15 minutes after the end of the basketball game, he will put on a jet pack and try to escape.
    -   _Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game_ Adventure 3 _Fantastic Four: Fantastic Voyages_. In the adventure "Hands of the Ravager", there are three jet packs stored aboard the Skrull scout ship _Kell'rr Anelle_, and the Kree Jon-Larr has one as well.
-   _Monsterpocalypse_'s Sky Sentinel, Defender X, and Nova-ESR all wear giant jet-turbines to help them jump and fly their way across the battle maps.
-   _Princess Ryan's Star Marines_. One of the Black Guard opponents the title characters can fight are platoons of armored grenadiers wearing jet packs.
-   _Rifts_:
    -   Most flying models of Powered Armor use heavy jet systems mounted on the back, though the armor itself is usually hanging/pushed along from them in an upright position. Jetpacks are otherwise fairly rare on Rifts' Earth, though the Three Galaxies setting uses gravity-based versions fairly extensively.
    -   Also noted are a set of rocket boots used to enhance jumping ability. They fire once on takeoff, and again to brake for landing. Notable in that it's also mentioned that one has to be superhumanly tough to be able to use them without breaking your legs.
-   In _Rocket Age_, the United States was originally the only country to have mastered jet pack technology and kept it a closely guarded secret. The US Rocket Rangers use them as part of their standard equipment and Erisian 'Knight' Armor often included something similar.
-   _Shadowrun_ supplement _Paranormal Animals of Europe_. In one story, a shadowrunner escapes the charge of a wild minotaur when her jetpak (sic) automatically activates and lifts her off the ground out of its way.
-   _Spirit of the Century_. The NPC hero Jackson "Jet" Black, the Flying Soldier, had a jetpack that he used to fly into battle during World War I.
-   Mongoose Publishing's _Starship Troopers Role Playing Game_. Both Mobile Infantry Marauder armor and the similar Skinny armor have jet packs on the back.
-   _Tales of the Space Princess_ RPG. One example of a Super Science device is the Jet Pack. A character wearing one can fly at at a movement rate of 60 yards/10 seconds (15 m.p.h.) for 1 hour before needing to refuel.
-   _Terran Trade Authority_ RPG. Space Combat Armor has a built-in jet pack on the back designed for use - IN SPACE!
-   _Toon_ supplement _Tooniversal Tour Guide_, "Supertoons" setting. Toons can fly using either a Jet Pack or a Rocketpack. If you fail your skill roll, get ready for a crash!
-   _Top Secret_. _Polyhedron_ magazine #9 has a list of new gadgets for the game, including the Model Jet Pack (MJP) - Defender Series. The wearer can travel at 30 miles per hour for up to five hours.
-   SPI's _Universe_. A Jet Pack is a rocket powered (solid fuel) backpack that allows flight in any type of atmosphere, including vacuum. Using one requires the Jet Pack skill, which determines speed (up to 200 km/hour) and the chance to crash.
-   _Villains & Vigilantes_. In the original main rules, Intercrime Power Infantry were said to wear jet packs with a maximum airspeed of 65 m.p.h.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_ is full of these. Space Marine Assault Squads, Tau Crisis Suits, Chaos Marine Raptors, Ork Storm Boys, Sisters of Battle Seraphim, Eldar Swooping Hawks, and Yeld Spyrers all have some form of jet pack. Most jump infantry without wings are examples of this trope, and even some with wings are as well.
    
    Most of these groups have slightly more realistically designs. Crisis suits, Assault Marines, Raptors, and Seraphim have angled thrusters so that they don't set their butts on fire, Stormboyz don't really care about safety, and Swooping Hawks use anti-gravity vanes sculpted to look like wings instead of proper jetpacks. Also, given the rules' remarks that soldiers don't have unlimited ammunition but are instead assumed to have enough to last six turns of gameplay, it is reasonable to assume that these people merely have enough fuel in their jetpacks to last a normal-length battle instead of being unlimited-fuel affairs.
    
    The Space Marine version actually has a slightly plausible explanation for how it works. Power from the backpack reactor is used to convert reaction mass to a superheated plasma, which is directed to launch and maneuver. This explains why the Jump Pack only allows the user to make short hops, not full flight - it takes a short while to convert enough mass to perform the next Jump.
    
-   Judges Guild's _Wilderlands of High Fantasy_ (Issue N) has a plethora of relic high tech items with little description, including a "fully operational flyer harness".

    Video Games 

-   In _007: From Russia with Love_ Both James Bond and his opponent Grant can use a jet pack to fly.
-   _Adiboo: Magical Playland_: Robbytock can turn his legs into propulsors.
-   _Apocalypse_: Airborne Mooks on rocket packs are a recurring enemy after the city stage, and they have a habit of appearing near catwalks, platforms, and areas where your hero have the _most_ amount of difficulty dodging. Which makes them Goddamn Bats for players without homing missiles or a Smart Bomb.
-   Rocket Boots are a powerup in _Backyard Football_.
-   _Barry Steakfries_:
    -   _Monster Dash_ features the Machine Gun Jetpack as one of the power-ups to kill monsters with.
    -   _Jetpack Joyride_ and _Jetpack Joyride 2_ take the Machine Gun Jetpack from _Monster Dash_ and base their gameplay around it, with many Improvised Jet Pack available from the game's store.
-   _Battlefield: Secret Weapons of World War II_ has one as a jetpack pick up. However, it is only good for getting to roof tops, since it has a short range. Also, contrary to the intro video, you are limited to the smg it came with, and not the rocket launcher shown. It mostly lands in the Cool, but Inefficient territory.
-   Iva's movement ability in _Battlerite_ is provided by a jet pack. It also leaks oil onto any enemy she passes over, putting them at risk of being lit up.
-   Pey'j from _Beyond Good & Evil_ has Jet Boots, although they don't propel him very high.
-   _Blow Out_ have your character equipped with a jet pack, which allows you to hover for limited periods of time to climb up shafts or evade swarms of mutant bugs. You do need to recharge it constantly, however.
-   _Broforce_ has jetpack mooks that take off the ground when alerted. Their jetpacks are prone to malfunctioning upon contact with fire.
-   You eventually get a jet pack in _Cave Story_. Notably, it comes in two, mutually-exclusive forms. The Booster 0.8 can only angle its thrust straight down and is acquired in a normal playthrough. But, if you perform a bit of precision platforming, you can skip that Booster, which allows you to later acquire the Booster 2.0, which can fly in any direction and is required for the Golden Ending.
-   _City of Heroes_:
    -   You get a Jet Pack and a rocket pack as a reward item for finishing a mission.
    -   Rocket boots (and piston boots) are also an unlockable costume part, though they're purely cosmetic, only adding a special effect to existing flight powers.
-   The shop in _Clash at Demonhead_ sells jetpacks. They're useful, but quite expensive.
-   _Club Penguin_ features several instances of jetpacks:
    -   The minigame "Jetpack Adventure'' requires the player to fly to the finish line with a jetpack without touching anything.
    -   The character Jet Pack Guy is a secret agent who is always seen with this flying device.
    -   In the minigame "Catchin' Waves", when the player is rolled over by a wave, a penguin with a jetpack will put him back on his feet.
-   _Command & Conquer_:
    -   _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2_ has Allied rocketeers, hovering light infantry. Soviets has the Cosmonauts in expansion which are prcticaly the same, just with laser weaponry. These are, however, used only on Moon.
    -   In _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3_, Japanes has the deadly Rocket Angels. They function basically the same as the above, but instead of light anti-infantry weapons they use Macross Missile Massacre.
    -   In the _Command & Conquer: Tiberium_ series, GDI has specialist infantry units with jetpacks in _Tiberian Sun_. The Zone Troopers, Zone Raiders, and Commandos in _Tiberium Wars_ also use jetpacks, although they are for leaping rather than flying.
-   _Cortex Command_ has nearly all units equipped with jet packs, which is a good thing, because the "realistic" physics and inability to jump makes simply walking on anything besides completely flat ground almost impossible. However, if a unit carries too much weight, the jetpack becomes nearly useless, and not all units have jetpacks. Plus, they're a little fudgy to use, and if you come down too hard, you break your legs off. Or break your body. Losing legs and non-vital parts does mean losing weight, however, which makes it that much easier to fly.
-   _Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back_: The fourth-to-last and second-to-last levels feature the use of a jetpack as a game mechanic. Crash has to use it in order to travel across the corridors of the zero-gravity zone. It's also an example of Unexpected Gameplay Change, as the difficulty of the commands is why these stages have been put in the fifth Warp Room. Crash uses the jetpack again in the final battle against Cortex; the control scheme is adapted to make it so Crash goes forward automatically, so the player only needs to worry about steering.
-   The original _Dangerous Dave_ features a jetpack that can be picked up and used on certain levels.
-   The protagonist of _Dark Side_ uses one.
-   _Dark Void_:
    -   Jet packs are the main selling point of the game.
    -   Its Retraux cousin, _Dark Void Zero_, also features the use of jetpacks, although slightly more limited in scope.
-   _Dead Space 2_: Isaac has thrusters in his boots and shoulders. However, they only work in zero gravity (and certain cut scenes).
-   _Destroy All Humans!_: Crypto's suit has a built-in jet pack that can pop out and allow him to fly around.
-   _Donkey Kong_:
    -   _Donkey Kong 64_: Diddy Kong has a wooden Rocketbarrel in this game, which becomes his recovery move in _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_; he can use it when he hops onto his designated Kong Barrel, and can fly for as long as he has Crystal Coconuts left (though in certain challenges as well as during the Final Boss battle the number of that item is unlimited, for the sake of convenience).
    -   _Donkey Kong Country Returns_: Diddy uses a jetpack in this game (serving as a tool to temporarily hover in the air), though it looks much different from the Rocketbarrel in _DK64_ and _Brawl_, as it has a little rocket that comes out of a backpack to help Diddy (and Donkey Kong if he has Diddy on his back or if you combine in Co-op) float for a short while.
-   In the _Dragon Ball Z_ games, Hercule has a jetpack to fly... but from the Tenkaichi series onwards, they only get him in the air for several seconds.
-   _Duke Nukem 3D_ has one you can use whenever you want provided you still have fuel for it. _Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project_ has it as a timed Power-Up.
-   _Earth Defense Force_ has the Wing Divers (and their predecessor, the Pale Wings), female soldiers who use jet packs to navigate the battlefield. To keep their weight down and make the most of their mobility, they also forego using traditional ballistic weapons in favor of Energy Weapons. The challenge from this comes from the fact that the jet pack and weapons both draw from the same energy source, so careful management of the Wing Diver's energy is necessary to avoid running out and being left unable to fly or effectively fight back.
-   In _Elite Beat Agents_, the "Makes No Difference" stage has the agents entering the scene via jet packs.
-   Every hunter in _Evolve_ has a jetpack. This allows the mobility to traverse the maps, which are filled with canyons, cliffs, and rivers, and the agility to dodge attacks.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Star Resistance_: Turns out not all the alien characters are gifted with superhuman flight. Daitoku Igor is more mundane in his abilities, and keeps up with Sharkungo and Forcestar via jetpack. In _Attack of Darkforce_, this is also how he makes his escape when the robots he pilots get destroyed.
-   _Fallout 4_ allows players to mod their power armor with a jet pack that allows them to fly, but eats through fusion cores like a ravenous radroach.
-   _Fighting Force_ has a boss with a jet pack.
-   _Get Off My Lawn (2014)_: The second variety of aliens has them wear a jetpack. It allows them to dodge incoming shots at least once.
-   The Cyborg class in _Ghouls vs. Humans_ has a jetpack, which has limited fuel. Apart from flying, it can be used for super-jumps, or to make a rapid dodge forwards, not unlike a Flash Step.
-   _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ has a jet pack, and it was arguably one of the most fun vehicles in the entire game. It was also highly necessary to collect all the items on the rooftops in the Las Vegas-like city.
-   _Halo_:
    -   _Halo: Reach_ and _Halo 4_: What's cooler than a _Halo_ multiplayer match? A multiplayer match with **jetpacks!**
    -   _Halo 2_ introduced the Ranger-class Elites, who were equipped for EVA with anti-gravity packs and fully-enclosed helmets, though they fight planetside as well. Ranger units in later games use more traditional jetpacks, as do the Brute Jumpers introduced in _Halo 3_.
-   _Henry Stickmin Series_: In "Escaping The Prison" during the Sneaky Escapist route, Henry can try to use a jetpack to escape from the prison, which he quickly loses controls of and flies head-on back into his cell.
-   _HeroSmash_ has some examples.
    -   Some players have jet packs even though they can fly without them.
    -   Rocker from Skull Deep has a jet pack.
    -   In the trailer, Mr Purple has a jet pack.
-   _The Horus Hersey: Legions_: Units that have the Unstoppable ability have the ability to ignore units with Front Line ability. Cards that have them, are shown with jet packs on their cards to identify, and emphasis their ability.
-   _Infinifactory_ has jetpacks as standard issue on the bright red space suits the Overlords issue to all their servant engineers. It's an essential tool for designing your factories.
-   _Jables's Adventure_. Jables even lampshades the fact that, since you have the jet pack, you must be near the end of the game.
-   _Jet Force Gemini_: Lupus has jet engines equipped in his four paws, allowing him to hover in the air for a surprisingly extended period of time (making him the only character capable of crossing large chasms that lead to unique areas). Later in the game, Juno and Vela are given jetpacks to fly vertically, though they can only use them when standing on a Jet Pad to collect fuel (during that same period, Lupus has his own jet engines upgraded to use the Pads as well).
-   The old ZX Spectrum game _Jet Pac_ and its successor _Lunar Jetman_ both have jet packs.
-   _Jetpac_. In this game, the main character wears it.
-   The side-scrolling shooter _Jets'n'Guns_ is full of jetpacked mooks, and in some levels in the _Gold Edition_, you have to leave your spacecraft and infiltrate an enemy base wearing a jet pack.
-   _Jetpack_, where the jetpack provides Video Game Flight.
-   The hero of _Jett Rocket_ has a jet pack, although the use is limited.
-   Neon Boulevard from _Jitsu Squad_ have enemy mooks on hover-packs, who repeatedly attempts sniping your characters with a bazooka while hovering above the area.
-   _JumpJet Rex_ has this as its main gameplay mechanic. Rex can use his rocket boots to hover, jump, rocket upwards and dash forward, and the player needs to master these abilities to traverse the levels quickly.
-   _Kerbal Space Program_ gives its astronauts a Manned Manoeuvring Unit similar to the one used in Real Life. On Kerbin it does next to nothing, but on some lower-gravity bodies it's possible to achieve _orbit_ with them.
-   _Killzone 3_ has a jet pack, though it is Awesome, but Impractical. Though it is obviously useful for flying around, you can't crouch while using it, and using it to fly leaves you open to enemy fire. The Jetpack does have a machine gun, but it's surprisingly weak, considering that it's supposed to be an LMG.
-   The Jet ability in _Kirby Super Star_ basically grants Kirby a Jet Pack. He can use this not only to fly, but to charge at enemies and fire energy pulses, and even perform an aerial throwing attack.
-   In _LittleBigPlanet_ a jet pack is one of the powerups, and there are two versions that people can use in their levels: The Tethered Jetpack', which has a certain range that can be set by the level creator, and the Tetherless Jetpack, which has no restrictions, save for people placing Powerup Removers everywhere.
-   _LunarLux_: Jet Suits allow their users to fly by examining Jet Pads. However, the user needs authorization from the law and a functioning Jet Chip.
-   _Mass Effect: Andromeda:_ The Andromeda Initiative gives out turian Jump Jets, borrowed from the turian elite forces, as standard equipment to its explorers. No more getting waylaid by three foot high ledges! They're pretty powerful, even capable of taking the weight of a krogan. One quest ends with the quest giver asking, as terms of a deal, for one of them in trade.
-   Doris de Lightning of _Max Blaster and Doris de Lightning Against the Parrot Creatures of Venus_ wears a pair of rocket pants for the mission.
-   In certain levels of _MDK2_, Max makes use of a jetpack with limited fuel.
-   _Metal Fatigue_. The game has jet packs as optional flight accessories for combots. MilAgro and Neuropa have jetpacks with wings while Rimtech uses mundane jetboots. Mounting jetpack/jetboots make combots behave like aircraft when ordered to move beyond a certain distance; they can even use ranged attacks without landing and cannot be attacked via melee until they do land. Now the drawback: while flying, combots get zero armor and all hits do full damage which means bad news, as flying parts have about 20 HP which is INSANELY low. It's still the fastest form of travel, though.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   _Mega Man's_ Jet and Super Adapters, and Bass' Treble Boost.
    -   _Mega Man Battle Network_ has the AirShoes Battle Chip.
    -   _Mega Man X_ has the falcon armour as well as Axl.
-   _Metal Slug_: From 3 onwards, players will be occasionally granted access to jetpacks, which allows them to fly after enemies in airborne missions instead of pursuing on foot. Said jetpacks also has a missile launcher built in.
-   _Metal Warriors_: When not piloting a Mini-Mecha, Stone can move around airborne thanks to a jetpack with unlimited fuel, though his standard human size makes him an easy target for all enemies except the ones who are also outside their mechs (even then, said enemies luckily don't wear any jetpacks, so they always attack from the ground).
-   _Metroid Prime Trilogy_:
    -   _Metroid Prime_ has the Pirate Aerotroopers, which not only have jet packs but also go kamikaze on you after being defeated.
    -   _Metroid Prime 2: Echoes_: The Gravity Boost is a powerup that lets you rise up while underwater for a limited time. It doesn't work on land, so it's an underwater-only jetpack.
-   Fassad from _Mother 3_ sports a jet pack from Chapter 7 onward. Presumably this is because Fassad lost the ability to walk when he was put back together ala Humpty Dumpty after his fall from Thunder Tower. So he flies instead.
-   In _MySims Kingdom_, one of the figurines depicts Trevor wearing a jetpack. Victor wonders why.
-   Nancy Drew, of all people, gets a jetpack in the game _The Haunting of Castle Malloy._
-   In the _Pilot Wings_ series, the "Rocket Belt" is one of the vehicles that can be piloted.
-   The signature ability of the light assault class in _PlanetSide_ is their jetpacks. They are known for ambushing people from rooftops and windows.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time_: The Far Future world introduces the Jetpack Zombie, who travels quickly, and can also fly over most plants to bypass them. There's also the Disco Jetpack Zombie, a disco version summoned by the Disco-Tron 3000. Finally, the expanded levels have the Blastronaut Zombie, a faster and tougher Jetpack Zombie whose Almanac entry subverts it, funnily enough — the jetpack is just for show, and his flight capability comes from a deep meditative state and being full of helium.
-   _PO'ed_ grants you a jetpack as early as the second stage, when areas with platforming elements becomes common. You'll need to conserve enough fuel to take on the final stage where you're fighting atop an out-of-control artificial sun - run out of fuel and you'll fall into the surface.
-   The Rocketeer is one of _Pulp Adventures_ available party members and has flight-related abilities, from hovering above ground while being able shoot, to ramming the target. There's also the Nazi Rocket Troopers, who are Nazi mooks with jetpacks; the Rocketeer initially appears ingame because he has been hired by the protagonists especially to not be too disavantaged against the Nazi Rocket Troopers.
-   _Putrefaction 2_ has jetpack-wearing enemies who can take potshots if they're airborne, although you can stop them from taking off if you shoot them quickly enough. You can also aim for their packs, causing them to lose control and crash.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_ series
    -   _Going Commando_ has the "Levitator", a jet pack which gives proper flight with limited fuel.
    -   This idea was later brought back in _Into the Nexus_ and _Ratchet & Clank (2016)_, where the jetpack now allows Ratchet to engage in aerial combat. However, if his fuel runs out, he still needs to find a refueling station.
-   Two examples in _Risk of Rain_: the Rusty Jetpack only increases jump height, whereas the Photon Jetpack gives limited flight.
-   _Rocket Knight Adventures_ has Sparkster, a Rocket Knight, who, as the name implies, is a armored knight with a rocket pack, along with a sword that creates energy slashes. It's just as awesome as it sounds.
-   _Rocket Ranger_ is a deliberate homage to the original Rocketeer in video game form.
-   You can make a jetpack in _Satisfactory_ after unlocking it in one of the later Tech Tree tiers. The jetpack itself has finite fuel, but it automatically refills from fuel carried your inventory as long as you're on the ground.
-   _Sly Cooper_: This is one of Bentley's gadgets available to him in the second game, and he gets rockets in the third.
-   In _Sly Spy_, some enemies fly in on jetpacks, and when killed will sometimes drop theirs for you to use.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   _Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos_ and _Sonic Triple Trouble_ have rocket shoe power-ups in certain stages if you play as Sonic.
    -   Shadow the Hedgehog also has rocket shoes, but the only time he's ever used them to hover is in the second Dark Story cutscene of _Sonic Adventure 2_. Most of the time, he uses them like a pair of roller skates.
    -   _Sonic Lost World_ has Dr. Eggman in possession of a jet pack, and he does use it. He also uses one in _Sonic CD_ after his first boss machine is wrecked and he makes his escape.
-   _Space Engineers_ has every character equipped with a small rocket pack for maneuvering in zero-gravity. The jetpack is fairly realistic affair, with multiple jets on both their front and back for movement in all three directions, and is aligned with the character's center-of-mass.
-   _Special Project Y_ have multiple levels where you chase down enemies while wearing armed jetpacks of your own, firing at mooks in your way. The game's first mission have you pursuing enemies on speedboats with your jetpacks.
-   Jet packs can be found/purchased/stolen in _Spelunky_. In the first game, they were a Game-Breaker. The sequel nerfed it by making it blow up if you get hit by fire or bullets.
-   _Splatoon 2_'s Inkjet special weapon causes the player to don a large jet pack that constantly fires continuous streams of ink out of it as a means of propulsion while arming the player with a rocket launcher that fires explosive globs of ink. The means of propulsion also means that flying over enemies causes them to take damage.
-   _Splitgate:_ All players get a recharging jetpack that allows just a little flight each jump, and near-instantly restocks while not in use. While it won't let you fly across the map on its own it's definitely helpful, especially while taking a portal-enhanced leap.
-   Reapers in _Starcraft II_ are Terran close-combat infantry with jetpacks and dual pistols. Their jets, actually mounted on the shoulders of their Powered Armor, don't let them outright _fly_, but they are very fast on the ground and can hop over cliffs.
-   In all _Starsiege: Tribes_ games, the jetpack is an extremely integral piece of the gameplay. Someone in juggernaut armor can only achieve any significant height gain by standing still while the same person in scout armor is nigh unstoppable on flag runs. And then we have the skiing ability of players, which originally came by as a bug, but is explained away in-game via micro-bursts from the jets. By the way, only scout and assault armors have jetpacks; juggernaut armors have jetboots instead.
-   Automated Simulations' _Star Warrior_. Depending on which method you use to create your character, you can either choose a suit with a built-in jet pack for him or pay for a jet pack as one of his custom suit's options.
-   _Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire_. A jet pack has finite fuel, so you must learn to manage it.
-   _Stormland_ grants you a jetpack called the Slipstream Thruster for hovering around the planet's skies.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Super Mario Sunshine_: FLUDD's Rocket Nozzle. It substitutes plumes of fire for a blast of rapid-shot water.
    -   _Super Mario Maker 2_: In Ground levels set during night, Mechakoopas make use of jet engines to briefly hover in the air.
    -   _Wario Land_: Wario has a hat version of this that debuted in _Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3_, the aptly named Jet Cap/Jet Wario, which allows him to fly forward for a certain amount of time. Underwater too, apparently.
    -   _Mario Party 6_: The minigame Lunar-tics has two dueling characters land slowly into a pad installed in the moon. Each character has a pair of jetpacks so they can slow down their descent (by pressing or holding the A button), because the goal is to touch the landing pad as closely to 0:00 in the countdown as possible. The key here is to maneuver with the falling speed with the jetpacks to measure the best moment to land. It's actually possible for one or both characters to land past 0:00, hence why the proximity to that instant is judged by the absolute value of the instant when a character lands onto the pad. Whoever lands on the instant closer to 0:00 (be it before or after it passes) wins, but if both characters land on the exact same instant, the minigame ends in a tie.
    -   _Mario Party: Island Tour_: In the minigame Fuel Me Once, each character has to fill up a jetpack with _just enough_ gas so they can equip it and fly to a round green platform above a lake that has some dark tiles in the middle segment, positioned exactly 100 meters away from the characters' launch site. Filling the jetpack with too little gas will make a character descend into the water before reaching the destination, while filling the jetpack with too much gas will make the character fly past the platform and thus fall onto the water as well. Making things trickier is that, when the minigame starts, the gas gauge's hand will show that the fill-up speed is designated _randomly_, and the gauge itself will be covered shortly after the fill-up itself begins, thus forcing the character to time the exact moment when they have to stop the gas input. The character who lands closest to the 100-meter spots wins.
    -   _Mario Power Tennis_: Diddy Kong's Defensive Power Shot (a Limit Break that allows the player to hit the ball from anywhere as long as it's on their side of the court) has him summon his "Rocketbarrel" jetpack to fly to the ball and hit it. The design looks like a mix between the earlier _Donkey Kong 64_ design and the later _Donkey Kong Country Returns_ design.

-   In _Twilight Heroes_, a hero with enough time and resources can undertake the game's biggest construction project, the Jetpack. The diagram for building it has its own page on the game's wiki. But once you complete the task, the Jetpack serves as one of the game's best forms of transport - Range 5 (meaning it can go anywhere on the map; there are _very_ few Range 5 vehicles), flying, and without any level limit. And the only requirement to use it is the Passable Pilot skill, available in any run to any hero with five turns, 500 chips, and access to Downtown (which only takes a Moped).
-   The Aero-Divers as well as Joe Fang fly using jet packs in _Virtua Cop 2_.

    -   In _Battle for Azeroth_, the Mechagone area has jet packs available for players so they can move more freely in the landfills. It is particularly useful for players who are farming the reputation, as the latter is a requirement to unlock the flying abilities for flying mounts in the expansion pack's zones.
-   Jet packs are used by some Mooks as well as one boss in _Xain'd Sleena_. The Laser Blade ones are the nastiest, as they love dives to either attempt to impale you with their weapons or in "kamikaze" fashion.

    Real Life 

-   The primary reason why this trope has not become reality is not impossibility but impracticality; you can make a jet pack, but humans are not aerodynamic, jet packs are terribly fuel inefficient, and flying is dangerous enough in a plane. Thus it is unlikely that jet packs per the popular imagination will ever be a common form of transportation on Earth. There's also the Toasted Buns issue: the classic jetpack would _incinerate_ your butt with the jets of flame, and inflict severe burns on your shoulders and/or back (because the engines themselves are hot). Even the compressed air and high-pressure water variants have the danger that if the tanks experience catastrophic failure, the explosive result is the same as having a bomb strapped to your body would have been - and they don't allow for much control or safe travel distance.
    -   The USA did devise a working steerable rocket-pack that did what it should and did not kebab the user. It was dropped because it could only carry 21 seconds worth of flight time, the pilot was too obvious a target to ground fire, and because the heavy cumbersome hi-tech device did nothing that could not already be done as well, using low-tech resources and equipment. (For example, a parachute is cheaper, lighter, and proven technology as a means of disembarking men from aircraft in flight; ejector seats already existed for pilots to use in emergency; men could cross rivers more effectively using combat engineer bridges; and special forces could attack on the ground more effectively, without needing to fly.)
    -   Contrary to popular belief, the original military projects experimenting with jetpacks were only intended for short jumps. The idea was to allow soldiers to quickly leap across a river or bounce over a minefield, rather than sustained flight. _Those_ designs (when they worked) did avoid most of the practicality issues like Toasted Buns, poor aerodynamics, etc. But other concerns like safety, weight, and especially _noise_ (even modern jetpack engines are unbearably loud) made alternate methods more attractive. So they were still impractical but for different reasons.
    -   There was an actual turbine powered version too, the Bell Flying Jet that was the first true jetpack. It was even to the point that it was (relatively) more practical, being a good bit lighter and with a longer flight time than the Rocket Belt, and likely could have become _more_ practical in due time. Unfortunately, the creator and driving force behind it, Wendell Moore, died while it was still in the testing phase, and without his mind and driving force to perfect it, the United States military lost interest and the program died with him.
-   The opening ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles included a Bell Rocket Belt (the _Thunderball_ device) flown across the stadium.
-   Many people spend lots of time/money (attempting a successful run at) making these. A fair number had military funding some decades ago.
-   The Other Wiki has this.
-   A Swiss man named Yves Rossy used a winged jet pack to cross the English channel in ten minutes.
-   Goin' public!
-   The space shuttle astronauts' Manned Maneuvering Unit is kind of like a jetpack, although its thrust levels are so low that it's only useful in Earth orbit. (It would run out of gas after only 25 meters per second of delta-v.)
    -   The MMU's predecessor, jet shoes, is a literal rocket boot.
    -   There was also consideration of giving the Apollo astronauts these for additional mobility on the lunar surface, but this seems to have been shelved when somebody realized how phenomenally dangerous it was going to be to just walk around up there, never mind trying to fly. The regolith is basically composed of very small bits of broken glass, and that's about as good an idea to walk around in wearing something that will cause you to die if it breaks down as it sounds. As it was the suit materials were seriously damaged by the lunar dust that got into them.
-   _Hydro_ jet packs and "flyboards", although not self-contained, allow for some impressive stunt maneuvers and can propel much greater loads than any air-jet or rocket-based version.
-   The JB-9 is much smaller than the Martin motorbike-sized version, is capable of vertical takeoff and landing unlike Yves Rossy's rocket wing, and claims to contain enough fuel for 10 minutes of flight time unlike various rocket belts used in shows. If it lives up to these claims, it is perhaps the single closest example to this trope's use in fiction.
-   Want an ApolloTurbine? It's one of the traditional jetpacks.
-   Trek Aerospace, Inc. has an entire line of personal aircraft.
-   The Gravity Industries "Daedalus" jet suit was invented by British ex-marine Richard Browning in 2016, and it could be considered the first truly viable jet pack. The suit has the familiar bulky backpack-mounted jet, but it is supplemented by smaller jets attached to the forearms. The result is a highly stable and surprisingly intuitive means of flight that can fly for around 5-10 minutes and can exceed speeds of 137kph. It is still highly expensive and consumes a lot of fuel for only a few minutes of flight, but the design has plenty of potential to be improved upon. Some militaries have even expressed interest at the design, as a means of quickly boarding and egressing to and from ships without having to force the ship in question to stop.
