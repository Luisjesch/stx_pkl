Sometimes, creators feel the need to stress to the audience that a work is part of an indefinite ongoing series, in order to make sure that they look for the next installment. A particularly unsubtle version of this is to simply announce it in an out-of-universe caption instead of "The End". The traditional format is some variation of "\[HERO'S NAME\] will return".

Sometimes this can be the sad sign that a work was intended to launch a Stillborn Franchise.

Not to be confused with And the Adventure Continues, which is where the intended final installment of a work doesn't have a permanent ending, but suggests that the characters will continue adventuring into the future, or with I Shall Return, which is a character saying this in story as a promise or threat. See also To Be Continued for more serialised works, and Sequel Hook for an intentionally conspicuous plot loose end that could provide the seed for a sequel.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Aggretsuko_: The final episode of the fourth season has a message after the credits stating that "RETSUKO WILL RETURN," with a "5" briefly appearing behind it to effectively confirm a fifth season.
-   The first season of _Goblin Slayer_ ends with the words, "Goblin Slayer Will Return".
-   _Sword Art Online: Alicization_ concluded with a "Kirito Will Return" message entirely in English.

    Comic Books 

-   IDW Publishing's comic book prequel to _Bumblebee_ ended with "Bumblebee will return" to complete the miniseries generally being an homage to the James Bond films. Ironically, the comic is incompatible with the continuity of the actual film due to being based on an earlier draft where Bumblebee had earlier adventures on Earth and the final film changing the script so that Bumblebee had not been on Earth prior to the events of the film.
-   _Wasp (2023):_ The final page has the statement "The Wasp will return!", as Jan is about to learn Whirlwind has been murdered in his cell.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Alarm Clock_, the author's note on the final chapter ends with _"Ditzy Doo and Doctor Hooves will return..."_
-   _The Differentverse_: _A Quest for Harmony_ ends with an author's note stating that "The Bearers will return in... _Different Bearers: A Case of Family_", and confirms it will be centered around Scootaloo's family.
-   _A Diplomatic Visit_: The story ends with an announcement: "**To be continued in… _Diplomat at Large_**"

    Films — Animation 

-   _Rapsittie Street Kids: Believe in Santa_'s credits end with the claim that "The Rapsittie Street Kids will be back with _A Bunny's Tale_" and a voiceover from a character promising to be back with the Easter Bunny. Unsurprisingly, due to the massively Troubled Production of _Believe in Santa_, no Easter Special sequel was made.
-   _Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse_ ends with the words “Miles Morales will return in _Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse_”. Fitting, given the film’s cliffhanger ending that leaves Miles at the mercy of an evil alternate universe version of himself while Jefferson remains in grave danger.
-   European edits of _The Transformers: The Movie_ have a voiceover at the end proclaiming that Optimus Prime will return. This was an Author's Saving Throw due to massive fan backlash in the USA to his death in the film.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension_ ended with the announcement that he would return in _Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League_. The movie wasn't a success, so he didn't.
-   The 1975 _Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze_ film ended with a "Doc will return in Doc Savage: The Arch Enemy of Evil" caption. Unfortunately, due to the film's poor commercial and critical response, this hasn't happened yet.
-   Parodied by _Doctor Detroit_, whose end credits proclaim that Doctor Detroit will return in _Doctor Detroit II: The Wrath of Mom_.
-   The Trope Codifier is the _James Bond_ films, most of which (except for the very first, _Dr. No_) end with a caption "James Bond will return in \[TITLE OF NEXT FILM\]" when the title of the next film is known, or simply "James Bond will return" when it isn't.
    -   The American release of _Goldfinger_ had "James Bond will return in _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_" while _Thunderball_ came next. The international release had the correct "James Bond will return in _Thunderball_". _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_ wouldn't come out until two other movies had been made in the meantime.
    -   _The Spy Who Loved Me_ announced that _For Your Eyes Only_ would be the next film, when _Moonraker_ came between (due to the _Star Wars_ craze).
    -   _Octopussy_ ended with "James Bond will return in _From a View to a Kill_". The next film's title was slightly changed to _A View to a Kill_.
    -   Even _No Time to Die_ had the caption though the film ended with Bond's death. It was likely done to assure audiences that the franchise will continue (via Continuity Reboot) after the Grand Finale of the Daniel Craig era.
-   _Mac and Me_ ended with the titular alien and his family becoming American citizens and driving off in a car, with a sign on the back with a big pink bubble popping up saying "We'll Be Back". The movie's poor reception ensured that would not happen.
-   _Machete_ ends with the narrator claiming "Machete will return in "Machete Kills" and "Machete Kills Again" ". When _Machete Kills_ was released, the third film's name changed to "Machete Kills Again... IN SPACE!"
-   _Maradonia and the Shadow Empire_, the film adaptation of the first _Maradonia Saga_ book, ends with a caption promising a sequel titled _Maradonia and the Escape from the Underworld_. It seems to be a Stillborn Franchise.
-   The Marvel Cinematic Universe has several, both before and after its first big crossover.
    -   _Thor_ does this just before The Stinger - "Thor will return in _The Avengers_."
    -   _Iron Man 3_ ended with a "Tony Stark will return" caption, to explain to the audience that the film's ending with Tony seemingly retiring permanently from superheroing wouldn't stick (but keeping a bit of ambiguity about whether _Iron Man_ would be seen again), and that Tony-only fans should still go and see _Avengers: Age of Ultron_.
    -   _Captain America: Civil War_ ends with a "Spider-Man will return" to explain that Spidey will get his own film.
    -   _Thor: Ragnarok_ and _Black Panther_ both state that the titular hero will return in _Avengers: Infinity War_.
    -   _Avengers: Infinity War_ ends with a "Thanos will return" caption, lampshading the film's The Bad Guy Wins ending.
    -   _Ant-Man and the Wasp_, which ends on a Sudden Downer Ending, ends this caption with an uncertain question mark.
    -   _Captain Marvel_ ends with "Captain Marvel will return in _Avengers: Endgame_", though this time it's after the mid-credits scene rather than after the credits.
    -   At the end of _Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_, Shang-Chi mentions that his sister Xialing is working to dismantle the Ten Rings organization. But the second Stinger shows that she's taken it over instead, with the promise that "the Ten Rings will return".
    -   _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ has a post-credits scene which doubles as a trailer for _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_. It ends on the caption "Doctor Strange will return".
    -   _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_ has "Black Panther will return" caption. While it's not a person, but a mantle.
    -   _Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania_ ends with "Kang will return" caption, meaning alternate versions of Kang will appear in the future. However, after the firing of Jonathan Majors after being found guilty of assault and harassment, the status of the character is currently in limbo.
    -   _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_, the Grand Finale of the Guardians saga, ends with "The Legendary Star-Lord will return".
-   Some _The View Askewniverse_ films parody this with a "Jay and Silent Bob will return" caption, referring to two characters who are usually recurring minor ones.
-   The 1960's Matt Helm film series. At the end of the last film, _The Wrecking Crew_, the caption says "Matt Helm will return in The Ravagers". _The Ravagers_ would have been the fifth Matt Helm film, but it was never made.
-   _Roller Gator_ ends with "Watch for Roller Gator 2", but the sequel was never made.
-   _Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song_ ends with a caption like this, but no sequel was ever intended; instead, it serves as confirmation that the title character has survived and will one day claim his revenge on those who have wronged him.

    Literature 

-   _The Saint_ books frequently ended in many editions with Simon's "haloed stick man" symbol and the words "Watch for the sign of The Saint, he will be back".
-   The author's afterwords in the _Sharpe_ books (up to _Sharpe's Waterloo_) tend to end with the sentence "Sharpe and Harper will march again."

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The William Hartnell and the Patrick Troughton eras had "Next Week" captions after the credits aired after the last episode of a serial.
    -   The 2005 revival has occasionally done this for mid-season hiatuses and season endings, such as "A Good Man Goes to War" ending with a caption reading "The Doctor will return in Let's Kill Hitler".
    -   2019 New Year's Day special "Resolution" has "The Doctor Will Return" after the episode ends.
    -   It's done again at the end of "The Timeless Children".
        
        The Doctor will return in "Revolution of the Daleks".
        
    -   “The Giggle” ends with “DESTINATION CHRISTMAS”.
-   _Loki_: A scene after the credits in the final episode of the first season shows a TVA document of Loki, being stamped with a mark that says "_Loki_ will return in Season 2."
-   An occasional riff on _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, as Joel, Mike or one of the bots will announce that one of the characters will return in an unlikely film title. Toward the end of _The Day the Earth Froze_, for example, Crow announced, "Lemminkäinen and Annikki will be back in 'The Forests of Secrets and Lies'!"
-   _Ms. Marvel_: After the post-credits scene, the text "Ms. Marvel will return in The Marvels".

    Theatre 

-   The epilogue of _Henry IV, Part 2_ promises a continuation "with Sir John in it". In the event, Shakespeare either changed his mind (according to one theory, after receiving complaints from the descendants of the historical Sir John Fastolf over how their ancestor was depicted, and according to another theory, he fell out with Falstaff's actor, William Kempe) or was trolling the audience, as Falstaff dies off-stage in _Henry V_ without ever appearing.

    Video Games 

-   _Bendy and the Ink Machine_ chapters finish with _Bendy will return_
-   The credits of _Crash Twinsanity_ end with _Crash Bandicoot will return_.
-   Every game in the _Kingdom Hearts_ series that has a secret ending ends with the phrase "_Connect. KINGDOM HEARTS_", which is the series' unique twist on this trope since the secret endings usually directly tie into a future installment, and in many cases one of the next two games. Starting from _Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind_, which ended the Dark Seeker Saga, this phrase is changed to "_An Oath to Return_", which more directly implies this trope.
-   The comedic Hildibrand story arcs in _Final Fantasy XIV_ usually end with "Hidldibrand will return..."

    Webcomics 

-   In _El Goonish Shive_, the penultimate strip of the "Escape From The Mall" storyline promises "Kitty and Felix will return in A future storyline".

    Western Animation 

-   Parodied on the _Hercules: The Animated Series_ episode "Hercules and the Golden Touch", as part of its James Bond homage, where the narration teases a non-existent sequel.
    
    **Icarus:** Hercules will return in _From Sparta with Love_.
    
-   _Gravity Falls_: The original airing of the season one finale had Grunkle Stan state over the credits sequence that "Gravity Falls will return", promising a resolution to the Sequel Hook put in place just seconds prior.
-   _Infinity Train_: The premiere U.S. broadcast of "The Engine" ended what had been announced as a ten-episode miniseries with a short promo clip before the credits sequence, in which One-One tells the audience he'll "See \[us\] next time!" before the screen states "_Infinity Train_ will return".
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   Although it wasn't in the episode proper, the credits during the premiere of "A Single Pale Rose" (a Wham Episode that ended on a Cliffhanger) had a short preview from the next episode, followed by a caption of "Steven Universe will return." For context, this series had many long breaks between episodes that left audiences without any idea when they would resume.
    -   The premiere of the _Steven Universe: Future_ episode "Prickly Pair" ended with a caption of "The Story Continues", as no episodes beyond that had yet been announced.
-   The finale of the seventh season of _The Venture Brothers_ made this claim. As the show was subsequently cancelled, the veracity thereof has been left to be seen.
-   The _Teen Titans Go!_ episode "The Viewers Decide" ended with a version of the claim, saying that Bumblebee will not return, due to her going solo and becoming a Batman-esque superhero.
