_"Do you know what would be the best way to wipe out all of humankind if you were a space alien with a special mind-ray? Make all women telepathic. Cos' if they suddenly found out about the kind of stuff that goes on in our heads they'd kill us all on the spot. Men are not people! We are disgustoids in human form."_

The Spear Counterpart of All Women Are Lustful: Men will do anything for sex, and women are the cerebral ones.

This is the tendency for all men within a work of fiction to think primarily with their penises. As such they will be constantly trying to peek up girls' skirts or into the girl's locker room and will go out of their way (often to absurd lengths) to either catch a glimpse of something naughty or gain a minuscule chance of doing the deed. Whenever they actually get a peek at a woman's breasts, they lose all brain function. This trope is often used as an excuse to hand male characters the Idiot Ball. Men will become catatonic, prove unable to think straight, get massive nosebleeds, etc. just because an attractive woman is in the room. If a man shows any amount of interest in a woman, it's assumed to be sexual. This trope is so prevalent that, if a male character is _not_ being lecherous around women, he is often assumed to be either gay, completely asexual, or just not right in the head.

This leads to Unfortunate Implications for any male-female relationship between characters that would normally not involve sex. **Any** contact, be it between family members, at the workplace, or even in a celibate organization has the potential to be treated as perverted; especially when law enforcement is involved, regardless of the truth. Then there's the Double Standard Rape: Female on Male, suggesting that if all men always want sex and would never turn it down, then they cannot be raped by a woman. This is ripe for exploitation by a villain(ess). In addition, male sexuality or things that are made to appeal to male sexuality are frequently seen as gross, creepy and/or demeaning to women. Such material is far more likely to be subjected to scrutiny and/or backlash, especially compared to media that caters to female sexuality.

The internalization of the notion that men are incapable of self-control or seeing women as anything other than sex objects (or that sex itself is evil) leads to Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny.

All Women Are Prudes is this trope's corollary and a harmful Double Standard because it promotes the idea that female sexuality and sexual desire are somehow abnormal, with Nipple and Dimed (or other body parts) applying _only_ to women.

This is a Cyclic Trope. It was prevalent in the past that All Women Were Lustful, with men considered _less_ sexually motivated than women as recently as the Renaissance. Everybody Has Lots of Sex is when both genders are considered equal in this, usually in a Free-Love Future.

Compare All Gays are Promiscuous (what happens when there aren't any women involved to say no), I'm a Man; I Can't Help It (focuses more specifically on the idea that a man can't function without sex instead of a universal perversion), A Man Is Always Eager (which purports that "real men" _never_ say no to sex when presented with the opportunity, no matter the circumstances), and Nerds Are Virgins (just because you're a pervert doesn't mean you get laid).

    Comic Books 

-   _Lesbian Zombies from Outer Space_. Unlike most zombies, these lesbian zombies are quite attractive. In fact, the lesbian zombie "virus" will turn an unattractive woman into something more along the lines of a porn star. These creatures use their looks, and their lesbian behavior, to attract their male victims, and it tends to work on everyone in town. Maybe if the guys thought with their brains a little more, there wouldn't be so many deaths.
-   _Robin_: Tim, whose lack of perverted thoughts and chastity have caused many a reader to consider him on the asexual spectrum, has a brief moment of despair when he learns that Stephanie had to deal with inappropriate comments and touching when she was still in elementary school. In combination with the attempted rape his first girlfriend had to deal with, he wonders why women put up with and trust men at all.
-   _Ultimate X-Men_: Jean Grey, the Ms. Fanservice of the team and who has telepathy, has a Running Gag with her being annoyed that all men picture her naked or in her underwear. Even _Ultimate Spider-Man_, who is an otherwise good and loyal boyfriend to Mary Jane.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Comic Strips 

-   This is a theme in Lynda Barry's comics. Many of her older comics feature men who seem only interested in sex. One comic features two male friends having a conversation that consists only of grunts and Sexual Euphemisms. Many of the men in her later comics are somewhat predatory.
-   One _Zits_ comic has someone drop the "men think of sex every 7 seconds" quote in conversation. The girls think "That often?", the boys "That little?".
-   John Patterson in _For Better or for Worse_ constantly gazes at attractive women, even when he’s right next to his wife Elly.

    Fan Works 

-   Shows up quite often in fanfic. After all, most fanfiction is anonymous or pseudonymous and written by young people. Indeed, it often becomes the characterisation equivalent of a Plot Tumour, with sex overriding everything the characters are canonically interested in.
-   Kalash93 enjoys this trope, though he never pushes it too far. Example.
-   _The Child of Love_: Invoked. In this story, Asuka gets pregnant with Shinji's baby after a one-night stand. When they are blaming each other Shinji argues she provoked him and Asuka replies he couldn't not want it since he is a guy and all guys are perverts.
-   Hell, even _alien_ men are perverts. "The Universe Doesn't Cheat" uses it for a throwaway joke when Captain Haelivthras th’Shvrashli, an Andorian, wonders "who the _shen_ with the great rack"<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>  is.
    
    **Commander Steven Hackett:** Captain!  
    **Thrass:** Hey, I’m bonded, not dead. Look, but don’t touch, eh?
    
-   In _The Legend of Total Drama Island_, Cody lampshades this when Heather flirts with him.
    
    **Cody:** _\[makes a sexual innuendo\]_
    
    **Heather:** Down, boy! I think we’re getting ahead of ourselves, you little horndog.
    
    **Cody:** Hey, I’m a dude. It comes with the territory.
    
    **Heather:** You do have a point.
    
-   _Rosario Vampire: Brightest Darkness_: As stated on at least one occasion, just about every boy at Yokai Academy is either a bully, a pervert, or both.
-   _Olivine Romance_: The protagonist, Jasmine from _Pokémon_, is a firm believer in this concept. Her childhood friend/tormentor and modern-day would-be Casanova Morty gives her ample reason to continue believing it.
-   _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_: Erika comes across as believing this during her first appearance. It's not completely unjustified: given that she and her gym staff are portrayed as an openly lesbian community, many male trainers lost their matches due to being more focused on the girls being affectionate rather than the battles.
-   Played straight and subverted at various points in _Kyubed: Shinobi's Revenge on Naruto_. Several foreign leaders are convinced to make political deals that benefit the kitsune nation with sex and Naruto makes a fair bit of money selling (fake) pictures of Tsunade bathing to the Raikage and Tsuchikage. However, in the latter case, both buy the pictures because they realize the implications of someone successfully spying on the Hokage in her own home.
-   Discussed in _The Loud House_ fanfic _Boys and Girls_, where Lori thinks that the reason it's OK for her to fawn over Hugh but not OK for Bobby to fawn over other girls, is because boys are more likely to cheat, but Lincoln chews her out for her Double Standard.
-   In the _Law & Order: UK_ fanfic "Choices", DS Matt Devlin — a man himself — states "all men are pigs" after he sleeps over at Alesha's place to look after her after she has a Convenient Miscarriage (of her rapist's baby) and wakes up the next morning with... what most men wake up with. Despite it being a completely normal physiological reaction, he's disgusted with himself, given the ordeal Alesha's been through.
-   _The Night Unfurls_: Obviously, not every single male character is depicted as lustful in this fanfic, but several characters, like Maia and Grace, assume this to be true, noting that a normal man would stare or ogle whenever any Ms. Fanservice is present. There's also the fact that the Black Dogs are a male-exclusive mercenary group who literally want to build a Sex Empire...
-   _Horde Champion_: Arthas, Genn Greymane, Thrall, Garrosh, and Lor'themar are all portrayed as some degree of lecherous, with Arthas being alluded to have been guilty of outright rape at one point.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _All Dogs Go to Heaven 2_. Charlie doesn't even hesitate to jump up on stage during Sasha's number and try to kiss her and only doesn't because he's a ghost at that point. Even when he becomes tangible again, he continues to follow and hit on her and passes on his ability to talk to humans by turning invisible and reappearing in front of her to give her a long, hard kiss on the mouth.

    Jokes 

-   A man goes to have dinner with his girlfriend's family. While there he notices the girlfriend's 18-year-old sister is particularly welcoming, wearing a low-cut dress that jiggles whenever he looks at her. She's also particularly clumsy that evening, as she keeps dropping small objects and bends over to pick them up. During dinner, he feels her hand on his knee making its way up. Finally, after dessert, she grabs him by the necktie and hauls him off into her room, lies down spread-eagle on her bed, and tells him to take her then and there.  
    The man says nothing, turns around, leaves the room, and already has his car keys out as he passes the front door when the rest of the family emerges from the bushes outside and congratulate the man on passing the test of faithfulness, the father putting down his baseball bat to embrace his son-in-law.  
    Years pass, during which the couple get married, settle down and have a son. And when the son reaches his 18th birthday, the father passes on his wisdom:
    
    "My boy, if there's one thing I learned from courting your mother, it's this: **Always** keep your condoms in the car!"
    

    Literature 

-   _ALiCE (2014)_: Subverted. It's heavily implied that Christopher was abused by his female boss as a child and fears her doing the same to the children at the asylum when he isn't around.
-   K. A. Applegate's _Animorphs_:
    
    -   Justified; the main characters are all teenagers, after all. Marco's libido is often brought up, and he does everything from trying to get Cassie and Rachel to make out to using the internet to look up scantily clad women. Jake makes fun of Marco for it, but when Cassie's in a bikini, Jake can't stop staring. Even Ax is portrayed as being a poor student because he's always thinking about girls (he's a teenager too, albeit an Andalite teenager). Tobias is the only one unaffected, most of the time.
    
    **Tobias:** <I am never a Peeping Tom,> I said way too quickly, then added, <I cannot use my superpowers for evil.>
    
    -   Tobias's affected by other things. In _The Pretender,_ when he watches Rachel transform into an eagle, he gets waaaaay too into it.
-   Invoked: Kyra of _The Astonishing Adventures of Fanboy and Goth Girl_ is incredibly paranoid. Her friendship with the male main character comes to an end partially because she believes this (although said character doesn't really fit this trope.)
-   In Angela Carter's _The Bloody Chamber_, _The Snowchild_ includes a man who is implied to have sex with the corpse of a young girl for this very reason. It should be noted that Carter was a very outspoken feminist who was divorced multiple times. Writer on Board indeed. It should also be noted the other stories within the collection holds the view that "sex is not evil unless one party is completely dominated by the other", which is why while a lot of male characters are portrayed as sexually predatory, a large number of **heroines** are shown to be just as willing to embrace their sexuality.
-   Jerin Whistler in _A Brother's Price_ can resist no pretty woman. Every attempt of seducing him is at least halfway successful. As his eldest sister points out, though, this is not entirely his fault — he was raised to never say no to any woman, as the polygamous culture he lives in would fall apart if one of the rare men insisted on being monogamous or even celibate.
    
    **Andre:** Take a look around the world, girl. Men don't never grow up. Get a bunch of us together with no ladies around and it's all boner jokes and headlocks. Your daddy just had enough money that he didn't have to hide it like the rest of us.
    

-   Mentioned by Andre in _Futuristic Violence And Fancy Suits_ when confronted with his former bosses Stripperiffic hologram housekeeper.
-   Referenced in combination with the idea that "boys will be boys" and therefore troublemakers In-Universe in _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_. Girls are allowed to enter the boys' dormitories, but try to do the opposite and you get magically rebuffed. Ron finds this out the hard way and immediately points out the double standard. Hermione admits it's an "old-fashioned rule".
-   _Introducing Media Studies_: A section criticizes the portrayal of women in the media, illustrated by women with comically enormous breasts, and stick-thin limbs. Also in the illustration are two drooling men looking at the women, eyes literally bulging out of their skulls. Paging Double Standard...
-   _The Kingkiller Chronicle_: In _The Name of the Wind_, Kvothe often scoffs at perverted men and how they gawk at pretty woman, yet when he discovers Fela Sleeps in the Nude when she answers the door late at night with only a Modesty Bedsheet barely covering her, he similarly struggles with the urge to gawk.
-   Mark Twain employs the trope in _Letters From The Earth,_ during a casually outrageous swat at organized religion, as one of the hazards women face in a confessional:
    
    \[One priest\] admitted that in his thirty years as a confessor none had escaped him except the elderly and the homely.
    
-   Danny Capistrono of _Paraiso Street_ has absolutely no shame in eyeing women. This gets him into trouble numerous times, namely when the local PD use this as a honey-trap to arrest him and when he draws the ire of his employer by running off with Isis Arnaz.
-   Jane Rizzoli of the _Rizzoli & Isles_ series seems to think this of every man she meets with the exception of her husband; she's disgusted and disappointed with her partner Thomas Moore when he falls in love with Dr. Catherine Cordell, telling him, "I thought you were different, but here you are, falling for the same thing every man falls for — tits and ass". This is in reference to the fact that Cordell is a very attractive woman who couldn't possibly have any other qualities that a man might find appealing. She's similarly annoyed with another partner when he becomes attracted to a beautiful witness and basically disgusted with any man with an attractive wife or girlfriend. However, her attitude stems from jealousy — she herself is in love with Moore and hurt that he's never given her a second look and she's resentful of beautiful women because she's plain.
-   Every male character in Christopher Moore's _Sacré Bleu_. Especially Henri.
    
    Once it was determined that Lucien and Henri were, indeed, wretched creatures with ethical compasses that pivoted around a point at their groins, which is to say, men...
    
-   _What The Hell Did I Just Read: A Novel of Cosmic Horror_: When Marconi enlists online message board members to describe the appearance of John, Dave, and Amy, a large portion of the comments on Amy's appearance are perverse.

    Music 

-   Nothing in music, nay, not even Lords of Acid, plays this as unabashedly straight as Tonedeff's song, "Pervert." The lyrics in full are too filthy to reprint, but the chorus goes like this:
    
    You'd better check up on your girl 'cause I'm a pervert.  
    I'm a pervert, down to do some dirt.  
    You'd better button up your shirt 'cause I'm a pervert.  
    I'm a pervert, biggest freak on earth.  
    You'd better cross your f####### legs 'cause I'm a pervert  
    I'm a pervert, eyeing up your skirt  
    I said, my mind is in the gutter. I'm a pervert.  
    I can't help it, that's just how I work.
    
-   "Maenner Sind Schweine" ("Men Are Pigs"), a song by Die Ärzte — an all-male band.
-   The Cole Porter song "Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love."
-   Studio Killers demo of their song, _All Men Are Pigs_, is exactly what it says on the tin.
-   Urban Dance Squad's song "The Devil".
-   This Pharcyde lyric:
    
    Should I pursue to do you, or just stroke my knot?
    
-   _Psychostick_ puts it very simply: _"Because Boobs!"_
    
    _("And some chicks, too!")_
    
-   The men in many Frank Zappa songs are quite perverted, especially rock musicians in the presence of groupies, as albums like _Chunga's Revenge_, _Fillmore East, June 1971_, _200 Motels_, _Joe's Garage_ demonstrate.
-   "Je Loopt Je Lul Achterna" ("You Walk Behind Your Dick") by Doe Maar from _4US (Album)_ about a man who was adulterous and lost his partner as a result.
-   "Frosty the Pervert" by Bob Rivers twists "Frosty the Snowman" into this trope.
-   W.A.S.P.: Self-Ironic interpretation of the name of the band (one of interpretations): "We Are Sexual Perverts". And if you listen to early songs by them...
-   Pervert by Descendants, Exactly What It Says on the Tin. This song is also featured in the Video Game _Grand Theft Auto V_ in the "Channel X" radio station.
-   Afrikaaner singer Bok van Blerk gets right down to it in _Appel, Lemoene_(_Apples and Oranges_). In which two zef delivery drivers make a very big leery nuisance of themselves in a greengrocers' shop until Sally, the lady owner, forces an apology at gunpoint.
    
    _Ons skree nou — Wys my jou lemoene! Of jou boer-pamploene!_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    

    Radio 

-   _Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me_:
    -   The NPR program reported on a Harvard Business School study into the use of social networking. As described by host Peter Sagal: "In an unsurprising finding the lead researcher calls, quote, 'surprising,' the number one thing men do on Facebook is look at women they don't know... Harvard Business School also found that looking at women is the number one reason men read _Playboy_, watch National Geographic Channel, and _open their eyes_."
    -   Citing a British study, Peter asks panelist Maz Jobrani what men talk about at a bar<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> :
-   This trope was mentioned and joked about in one round of _Notes and Queries_ on _I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue_.
    
    **Humph:** Graeme, this is your question. Is it true that men think about sex every seven seconds?  
    **Graeme:** That is a complete phallus. ...Fallacy!  
    **Tim:** There's a woman in the front row who said "yes"... how would _you_ know?  
    **Barry:** I didn't hear the question, I was miles away.
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   The author of _Violence™: The Roleplaying Game of Egregious and Repulsive Bloodshed_ (a dark satire of hack-n-slash RPGs) notes that men love to play female character with big breasts.
    
    "Choose a gender. In reality, scum like you are almost always male, but go ahead, play a female character. One with big boobs, no doubt. Female characters popular among male players almost always have big boobs. If you don't believe me, play ''Tomb Raider."
    

    Theater 

-   _Avenue Q_, of course, has the song (and the trope) "The Internet Is for Porn". All the male characters admit to masturbating to Internet porn. Mind, Kate Monster, Christmas Eve, and Lucy the Slut are all pretty lustful themselves, though the play is fairly mum on whether or not they're frequent masturbators.
-   The Starkid musical _Me and My Dick_ begins with the main character personifying this trope.
-   Best summarized in _The Threepenny Opera_, in "Die Ballade von der sexuellen Hörigkeit" ("The Ballad Of Sexual Serfdom"):
    
    Und er beginnt nun zu verstehn (And he's starting to understand)  
    Daß ihm das Weibes Loch das Grabloch war. (That to him, a woman's hole has been his grave)  
    Und er mag wüten gegen sich und toben — (And he could resist and rage against himself —)  
    Doch bevor es Nacht wird, liegt er wieder droben. (But before night falls, he's lying right on top again.)
    

    Visual Novels 

-   Basically all of the male cast in _Higurashi: When They Cry_, except arguably Satoshi. Gone so far as to be used as an explanation for why a pro baseball player likes sweets over meat. Keiichi uses this to his advantage and bribes him to throw a baseball game.
    -   And the other team starts a cult after him after he says that it's okay to be a pervert.
    -   In a more serious example, Rena believes that men are physically unable to resist when a hot woman tries to seduce them... and that's why she hates women who use that to control men.
-   In _Majikoi! Love Me Seriously!_, excluding Cap, all men seem to be perverts. There is even a secret but very popular meeting in one of the routes where many of the students (and at least one _teacher_) buy more or less risque photographs of girls at the school.
-   _Yo-Jin-Bo_. All six bodyguards are some degree of Chivalrous Pervert, even the otherwise classy Bo and the Blood Knight Ittosai. This is purely for comedic purposes — for example when Sayori reties Jin's belt for him, all of the other guys suddenly claim _their_ belts are loose too (except for Ittosai, who complains that he can't get his loose). Aside from the heroes, there's also Dirty Old Man Yahei, who likes to watch Hatsuhime bathe.

    Webcomics 

-   Xeus from _The Beast Legion_ isn't exactly a pervert but ends up in this situation in the 300th page of the comic.
-   Bug wants NASA to know that when it comes to space travel, all anyone cares about is whether the astronauts have sex in space.
-   _El Goonish Shive_: Of the three male lead characters, Justin and Tedd are like this. Even gender-bent female characters do this. As for Elliot, though...
-   _Ghastly's Ghastly Comic_, by the nature of the beast. It seems most characters in this webcomic are rather lacking in control over their sexual whims, male or female, and some of the exceptions are male.
-   In _Gosu_, after Song Yerin and Gang Ryong discover that the late Lord Hong had hidden "clothesless martial arts tomes" in his treasure chest, Yerin tries to defend Lord Hong's honour while they burned the tomes. However, Gang Ryong notes that the pages of the tomes were _very_ well used and had stains on them, noticeably (and humorously) irritating Yerin...
-   _Ménage à 3_. The main characters are bad enough, but background characters are completely incapacitated if DiDi so much as walks in, let alone when she turns up at a strip club...
-   _MegaTokyo_: None of the boys in Largo's class object to his demand that everyone takes their clothes off, though Largo himself is oblivious to the issue. Played more seriously later, when a vast legion of fanboys obsessively try to get photos of Kimiko's panties; some of them cease this behavior when she calls them out on it, but many of them just continue treating her like a sex idol. Her voice-acting role in an H-Game sure doesn't help.
-   Drake and Daniel are probably the only males in _Moon Crest 24_ to avert this trope.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   It's a plot point when paladin Miko captures the party. Despite her readily apparent bitchiness, Roy remains continuously attracted to her and remains blind to her continually abrasive behavior. Ironically, it's after he becomes a woman himself and changes back that he does see Miko as more than a love interest. Then, naturally, he goes off on her, having realized how much of a bitch she really is.
    -   Off the whole titular party, Vaarsuvius is probably the only chaste character, having already a mate. Besides Roy, Elan thinks it's a bard duty to seduce female villains (until he gets in a relationship with Haley), Belkar continuously spouts innuendo and treats women like sex objects, and even Durkon had a fling with an evil female dwarf. Haley isn't off the hook either, blatantly ogling or fondling Elan even before they're an item.
    -   Haley seems to cause this. Roy's (dead) father seems to enjoy spying on Haley in the shower, an old halfling colleague enjoys staring at pictures of her in the bath, and the men of the team make her check for traps twice because it's like watching her pole-dance.
-   Lampshaded and defied in _Rain (2010)_ during a dream sequence (it's Rain's dream, but the way they act rings pretty true for their characters) when Rain and Maria go to bathe in a lake, leaving Gavin and Rudy behind:
    
    **Gavin:** Sooo... you wanna peek?  
    **Rudy:** Even if I wasn't gay, one of them is my sister. But I mean, I won't stop you  
    **Gavin:** Nah, I wasn't gonna go anyway. Straight as a nail, but not that kinda guy.  
    **Rudy:** Man. These kinds of scenes are boring with guys like us.
    
-   With the notable exception of Mike, _Sexy Losers_, again by the nature of the beast. (Mike's still a pervert. He's just not interested in sex with anyone but himself.)
-   _Sluggy Freelance_. When asked to paint her apartment, Torg painted Zoe's walls with a nude portrait of her. Riff seems to forget all about his quest to stop Aylee once she grows a pair of Non-Mammal Mammaries. Bun-Bun is practically addicted to _Baywatch_. And that's just the main characters. Supporting characters like Sam or Dr. Schlock often get it a lot worse.
-   In _Something\*Positive_, even God himself is a pervert who thinks Girl on Girl Is Hot and only said homosexuality was a sin so that he would be alerted to lesbian couples having sex to spite him. See here.
-   In _Unit-M_, when Shield posts a photo of herself in a low cut workout top online, she’s quickly deluged with vile, sexually explicit messages.
-   _Waste of Time_ shows this off with its own comic (comic 89, if you're wondering).
-   In _The Word Weary_, Elly's breasts are the recipient of an inordinate amount of attention on a number of different occasions.
-   To varying degrees, almost all of the males in _The Whiteboard_ have made sexually charged comments about female characters, or in the extreme cases attempted to sneak peeks of the women in varying states of undress.
-   _Yumi's Cells_: While Yumi's Naughty Cell is a chaotic force to be reckoned with, he claims to be a normal Naughty Cell compared to the others out there. It turns out he's right; the men have more distinct Naughty Cells than Yumi. Woong's Naughty Cell has a pet Naughtysaurus whose strength is comparable to Yumi's Hunger Cell. Control-Z lacks a Love Cell, so his Naughty Cell was the first to respond to a love confession. The introverted Soonrok has a tendency to unintentionally summon his Naughty Cell, a proportional, muscular Gentle Giant who recharges his energy meter when he didn't ask for it.

    Web Original 

-   _Babylon Bee_: "Study Finds 100% Of Men Would Eat Any Fruit Given To Them By A Naked Woman"
-   _Can You Spare a Quarter?_: Due to previous bad experience, Jamie always assumes that any man who takes him in will eventually want sex with him and other children. Graham eventually succeeds in persuading him otherwise.
-   Discussed and subverted in a Cracked article about how the Media is sexist and bad at math. The article also goes out to disprove All Women Are Prudes at the same time.
-   Subverted with the "I bet he's thinking about other girls" meme template, where an angry-looking woman is throwing a Death Glare to her pensive boyfriend in bed, but the boyfriend is thinking of some completely unrelated tangent ("would fish smoke cigarettes in their mouth or gills", "could Superman beat Goku", "could Jack fit on that door", etc.), replacing All Men Are Perverts with a different stereotype.
-   Things I need to tell my teenaged daughters about boys explicitly describes all teenage boys attempting to have sex with a young woman as little more than rapists who cannot comprehend the idea that women might actually enjoy sex. Ironically, the list itself makes little reference to the idea a young woman might enjoy sex, except for the segments stating that she's probably not going to get it from men, and if she tries to teach him, it probably won't be very effective for very long. It frames all male sexual desire in terms more suitable for a dog in heat. The only way for a woman to get a man to stop trying to have sex with her is apparently to present the very idea as ludicrous. No, she can't simply tell him she's not interested, she has to actively mock the idea that she would ever possibly be. Ironically, the article seems to be written by a man.
    
    However, in both cases, it is nearly unstoppable — and I say "nearly" because the only possibility of getting out clean lies in your ability to generate substantive and believable ridicule. You must be totally disappointed in him. Presuming you're not dating a rapist ... letting your male friend know the prospect of sex with him is a major yawn is probably the best deterrent.
    
-   Played With in the _Whateley Universe_ from time to time. The school has a number of transgender students but only the standard male/female sanitary facilities and a policy that students are supposed to use whatever a person seeing them on the street would _expect_ them to. Phase's ogling of the "real" girls in the showers is something of a Running Gag. Also, Nikki's glamour works on this principle. It's also a serious part of Hank's character. He was born a girl, but pretty much acts like this. Played with since everybody in Poe showers is looking, but some of them have more "evidence".

    Web Videos 

-   _The Adventures of Captain Bucky and his Space Marshals, in Outer Space_. The Space Marshals all stare at The Squadette's behind as she bends to look through the Everything Sensor, then quickly straighten up when she turns to face them. Captain Bucky then reaches out to pat her in approval — there's a poorly-edited Smash Cut to her straightening her clothes with an irritated expression on her face, implying the actor did some on-screen sexual harassment.
-   The boys over at Channel Awesome (except That Dude in the Suede). Played with in that All Women Are Lustful is in full force too, the majority of them are feminists, they like playing up the Ho Yay and Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy tends to be a trend.
-   CollegeHumor: Deconstructed in the "Every 7 Seconds" videos, which bases itself on the myth that men think about sex every 7 seconds. The guy in question can barely get through a conversation because he's constantly being distracted by sexual phantasies that appear completely real.
-   _Echo Chamber_:
    -   Tom dates Psycho Ex-Girlfriend Shannon solely because of her large chest.
    -   Also Zack.
        
        **Dana:** _\[to Tom\]_ It's just an idea. You don't have to bend over backwards to accommodate me.  
        **Zack:** Ooh! Bend over backwards to accommodate _me_!
        
-   The NSCL isn't above making jokes about his lust for certain female anime characters.

    Western Animation 

-   A rather mild version of this appears in some _Animaniacs_ and _Tiny Toon Adventures_ shorts; the male cartoon characters can't control themselves around Hello Nurse or Minerva Mink. (Amusingly, the _female_ characters also have a tendency to lose control of themselves around good-looking _guys_.)
-   Virtually every male character in _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_ are obsessed with women in some way. Master Shake and Carl Brutananadilewski are probably the biggest offenders, being porn-addicted casanova wannabes who will do anything to get laid. Frylock or Meatwad are the least perverted, but not even they refrain from having sexual desires.
-   Actually Subverted in _Beavis and Butt-Head_. The titular duo are the only ones who constantly go on a quest to have sex with women. All the other guys seem to be just as annoyed as the women.
-   Not just the men, but the dogs too apparently in _Courage the Cowardly Dog_.
    -   Courage himself demonstrates this trope after accidentally opening a door and seeing a woman showering behind it. The second time he opens it is on purpose. And he was still a pup when that happened!
    -   And in an earlier episode where Courage and Muriel are looking on the internet for a recipe to cure a sick Eustace, Muriel accidentally presses a button on the keyboard and opens another page. Hers and Courage's reaction combined with the accompanying Sexophone heavily imply he was looking at an adult website.
-   _Danny Phantom_: Danny and Tucker are definitely perverts. Danny is caught going into the girl's locker room and talks about going in there in one episode. Tucker loiters by the girl's locker room. He even gets in trouble for it in the first episode and he smiles slyly when it's mentioned.
-   Pretty much every male in _Drawn Together_ is sex-obsessed. Of course, the female characters aren't much better. In sheer number of sexual partners, Foxxy beats everyone until she makes a bet with Toot, who finds a way to have sex with _millions_ of men (against their will).
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Many male characters are like this, but Quagmire is by far the most notable and extreme example.
    -   Deconstructed in "Peter-assment"; when Peter says that his female boss is sexually harassing him, everyone else argues that men _can't_ be harassed because they're supposed to enjoy sexual attention from women, and that men who don't are either massive wimps or gay.
-   Referenced in _King of the Hill_ episode "Aisle 8A", where Connie gets her first period and spends much of it being angry at Bobby. At the end of the episode, he comes by and asks if it's a good time. She says her mother told her not to be alone with Bobby anymore because men only want one thing. Bobby asks if she knows what that thing is because he's just plain confused.
-   Tex Avery created the Ur-Example with the Red in _Red Hot Riding Hood_ who has this effect on all men. Jessica Rabbit and Hello Nurse are largely homages to Avery's Red.
-   _South Park_:
    -   Season 14 episode "Sexual Healing" has this as its basic plot, with nearly every man in the world pretending this is not the case and that the rich, successful men who go out and have sex with as many women as possible are suffering from a disease.
        
        It was an alien! Who was also a wizard! He was casting a spell! \*eyes dart around at the nearby female companion\*
        
    -   In "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy" the only reaction that the titular news gets out of various adult men, including police, is a quiet "...nice!"
    -   In _The Lord of the Rings_ episode, all the boy's fathers are very knowledgeable when it comes to porn, much to their wives' disgust. Subverted somewhat by Mrs. Broflofski and Mrs. Cartman describing a sexual act from the titled movie with unusual accuracy.
