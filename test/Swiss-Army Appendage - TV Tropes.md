_I got horns that open bottles,  
And I got horns that hold my keys.  
I got horns that, when you turn them right,  
They help me watch TV.  
I got horns that open pickle jars,  
And horns that come with hair.  
I got horns that hang my other horns,  
I always come prepared._

Often a character who is missing a limb will make the best of it by having a whole collection of artificial replacements, that get hot-swapped as the occasion warrants. At least as it applies to heroes, this is predominantly a literary trope, as viewers tend to find obviously artificial limbs unattractive. It's frequently associated with heroes who are older and/or more intelligent than average—they have to be older because they need to have had time to get injured, and coming up with the idea often seems to connote intelligence (or at least mechanical aptitude).

Frequently, the limb uses Telescoping Robot technology to generate the tool from Hammerspace.

When the replacement limbs are collectively more capable than an ordinary one would be, this becomes a kind of Disability Superpower, although the odds of suffering a Fake Arm Disarm increase. These can also include Hook Hand, Arm Cannon, Blade Below the Shoulder, Swiss-Army Weapon, Spider Limbs, etc.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Captain Hook in _The Adventures of Peter Pan_ has a second hook-hand that both looks and functions like a crab claw.
-   Guts in _Berserk_ loses an arm to a demon during the Eclipse, but it's all good because his replacement includes a gunpowder Arm Cannon and a repeating crossbow! On the other hand, the thing does _not_ have moving fingers, but powerful magnets make sure that the artificial fingers are tightly grasping his massive sword, The Dragonslayer.
-   Justimon, Cyberdramon's Mega form, from _Digimon Tamers_ has the Trinity Arm, which has three different forms.
-   Various characters in _Fullmetal Alchemist_ have "automail" limbs that also function as weapons:
    -   Ed's automail arm is only designed to be used as a limb, but his alchemy makes it a versatile Morph Weapon.
    -   Paninya has a blade in one leg and a gun in the other. Both of which prove to be fairly useful against the Elric brothers.
    -   Buccaneer at Fort Briggs is short one arm. Being from Fort Briggs, the prime center of badassery in Amestris, he naturally has several automail weapon/arms, including one which is more or less a pair of chainsaws attached to his shoulder.
    -   Lan Fan loses her arm and has it replaced by automail, but because she's a ninja, it has a retractable blade.
-   Swiss army limbs containing holdout weapons are common for the robot bodyguards and cyborg assassins in the various incarnations of _Ghost in the Shell_, not so common amongst the heroic characters. Particular instances are a double-barreled gun Batou has within his arm that he breaks out for the final fight in _Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence_, and a pump-action shotgun loaded with rolls of coins in the arm of the Chinese assassin Fem in the first season of _Stand Alone Complex_.
-   Gray from _Gunsmith Cats_ got his hand blown off the first time he ran into the heroine Rally Vincent. When next we see him he uses a hook when he want to be relatively inconspicuous, but swaps in out for a two-foot long spring-loaded steel machete he can launch at will with enough force to punch through a car door.
    -   Don't forget Bonnie from the first volume, who conceals a strangling cord inside her prosthetic thumb, and a shotgun in her leg. And the foot of that leg apparently contains a remote-controlled bomb.
-   The entire point of Go Nagai's _Kotetsu Jeeg_ and his successor _Koutetsushin Jeeg_. The title Jeegs are modular Humongous Mecha who can replace their limbs with tools and weapons such as the Mach Drill, Earth Parts, or Jeeg Bazooka. They also store one entire set of Jeeg Parts to rebuild the robot as long as the head survives.
-   Phantom, the Big Bad from _MÄR_, has all of his most powerful Ärms _grafted onto his left arm_, which is wrapped up with cloth straps to keep it hidden. It's not exactly surprising when he reveals it, but it is _awesome_.
-   Gundam GP03 Dendrobium Stamen from _Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory_ has arms which open up into long, thin grasper arms. These are not used for hand-to-hand combat, but rather to grab various armaments out of the gigantic Dendrobium Orchis mobile armor that it rides around in.
-   Franky of _One Piece_ rebuilt himself as a cyborg, with his arms receiving major modifications. His right fist is attached to an extendable chain, allowing him to fire it for either a ranged punch or to serve as a grappling hook. His left arm contains multiple ranged weapons including finger-mounted guns, a machine gun in his wrist, and a cannon which uses an aiming scope in his palm. The two limbs can also be linked together to fire off a concentrated burst of air which is later upgraded to a laser.

    Comic Books 

-   _Cable_:
    -   Early in his continuity, Cable's metal arm was one of these (it has since been retconned to be a symptom of the techno-organic virus turning his body into machinery).
    -   Cable's protege, Garrison Kane, has _four_ of these, originally given to him by the Weapon X program. Cable later upgraded them to the same 40th century tech he uses for his own arm.
-   _Catwoman_ once fought a foe called Wooden Nickel whose "power" (using the term incredibly loosely) was that he possessed a wooden arm with multiple functions.
-   _Death's Head (Marvel Comics)_: Death's Head and his successor Death's Head II both do this.
    -   The original Death's Head has several different weapons that he can swap his right hand with, including a mace, an axe, a blaster, and several different types of missiles.
    -   Death's Head II has a liquid metal right forearm with (at least) four different configurations: hand, cannon, blade weapon, and "siphon" (which is used to absorb information, knowledge, and skills from others, organics or machines alike).
-   _Daughters of the Dragon_: Misty Knight's cybernetic arm has undergone a series of upgrades over the years.
    -   Misty's first prosthesis was constructed from steel, and designed by Stark Industries. It possessed a vise-like grip and allowed limited super strength.
    -   Misty's second arm was built by Tony Stark and was made from an Antarctic Vibranium and a diamond combined alloy. Due to the new material, at close range, it can liquefy most metals including adamantium. It can generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to Iron Man's armor and can produce concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, covering an area in ice. Tony Stark later revealed the new arm allows her some limited technopathic capabilities which she used it to take control of a group of attacking robots in _World War Hulk: Aftersmash_. Daniel Rand later funded an upgrade of the arm to include magnetism and a concussive blast.
    -   Misty's third prosthetic included a Grappling-Hook Pistol hidden in the forearm and energy shield whose size she could adjust to compensate for mass protection. While working for the J.A.N.U.S. organization, her prosthesis outfitted with sonics to deal with Carnage.
    -   Misty's fourth bionic arm included Wolverine Claws and an energized charge which supposedly enhances her bludgeoning and striking power.
-   Aaron Stack, a.k.a. the Machine Man, of Marvel Comics; originally a serious superhero, later a member of adrenaline-soaked parody team _Nextwave_. All of his limbs are this — heck, he's like a more competent Inspector Gadget crossed with Bender from _Futurama_.
    
    _"I am full of useful devices."_
    
-   In _Savage Sword of Conan_, Captain Bor'Aqh Sharaq has a prosthetic arm that can be fitted with a sword, an axe or a spring-powered throwing iron.
-   Pharma, from _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_, gets two of these after losing his hands. He can apparently turn them into pretty much anything, although we mostly see chainsaws.
-   Lucien Machete from the Topps Comics _Zorro_ series had a variety of weapons and gadgets built into his Hook Hand.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Dick Tracy_ villain Dr. Plain had a prosthetic arm that contained a miniature flamethrower.

    Fan Works 

-   In the Marvel Cinematic Universe fic “14,000,606”, after Peter Parker loses his left arm triggering the Snap to destroy Thanos's army, Tony Stark and Princess Shuri collaborate to create a new arm for Peter. This arm is not only made of vibranium, but is designed to replicate Peter's ability to stick to walls and has nanites that allow it to generate its own virtually limitless webbing. Tony also talks of plans to make various new versions of the arm with this as the prototype, particularly after Quentin Beck briefly hacks the arm and turns it against Peter. The sequel shows Peter experimenting with a range of other arms with other functions, including one that can fire a repulsor blast or another capable of creating an energy shield, although he assures Michelle he would never go out with an arm that hadn't been thoroughly tested.
-   _Rocketship Voyager_. Tech Lieutenant Annika Hansen is one of the Spaceborn who have modified their bodies to work in space. Instead of the cumbersome space armor with pincers used by ordinary spacers, one of her hands is a cluster of micromanipulators to enable delicate repair work.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: Thanks to her nudity curse, Spectra the Changeling is sometimes forced to shapeshift her hand into common tools since she doesn't have pockets to carry anything around. So far she's turned her hand into a saw and a lockpick on different occasions.

    Films — Animated 

-   This was proposed for the _BIONICLE_ animated movies, as the designers didn't originally know whether to give the characters hands or stay true to their LEGO models which merely had connectors that anything could attach to. In the end, they scrapped the idea and gave them human-like hands, but a remnant survived in one scene. When Gali is swimming, little propellers flip out from her wrist.
-   In the final segment of the _Heavy Metal_ film, the villain has a mechanical hand. For the final fight, he swaps the hand for a buzzsaw-type cutting tool.
-   Japeth the mountain goat from the film _Hoodwinked!_ has an incredible number of detatchable horns that can be used for every practical purpose: including holding his car keys (which is strange since he doesn't own a car), a set can be used as a bottle opener, a set used like a coat rack, and even a set with helicopter blades that _allow him to fly_.
-   Gobber from _How to Train Your Dragon_ replaces his missing hand with whatever the situation calls for. A fork, a stein, a hammer, etc. He is even introduced as "the meat-head with attitude and interchangeable hands". Hiccup gets his own prosthesis at the end, which includes suspension and is neatly designed to fit in to Toothless' gear system.
-   A brief scene in Walt Disney's _Peter Pan_ shows Hook choosing a gold-plated hook from an assortment of hooks.
-   John Silver in Disney's _Treasure Planet_ is a cyborg, with artificial arm, leg, and eye. The arm transforms into about a million different things, from tools for cooking to a cutlass. He can even use another part attached to his leg to turn it into something akin to a plasma cannon.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Mr. Han, the Big Bad in the Bruce Lee movie _Enter the Dragon_, had a hand-stump, to which he attached a jade fist, tiger claws and a ''bagh nakh''.
-   _Evil Dead_:
    -   In _Evil Dead 2_, Ash amputates his own demon-possessed hand and replaces it with a chainsaw to battle the undead.
    -   In _Army of Darkness_, he replaces _that_ with a mechanical gauntlet strong enough to crush a metal goblet like it was play-doh. Groovy, indeed!
-   Klinger, the one-armed tattooist in _Holmes & Watson_, has had his missing hand replaced with a functioning tattoo gun. He also mentions a frosting attachment for icing cakes.
-   In _Hook_, Captain Hook has a number of swappable attachments for his missing hand, including a cup-like device he uses to hold a glove for the impromptu game of baseball he sets up to try and win the love of Peter Pan's son.
-   _Innerspace_'s Mr. Igoe has several devices he can use to replace his missing hand, including a hand which fires bullets from the index finger, a flamethrower, and a vibrator. Amusingly, the license plate of his car is "SNAPON".
-   In _Inspector Gadget (1999)_, Dr Claw is presented a few interchangeable alternatives by his Mad Scientist, Kramer. Options include an opera hand, a sushi hand, and a medieval fair hand (which is just a mace ball attachment).
-   _The Kentucky Fried Movie_ features "A Fistful of Yen," an Affectionate Parody of _Enter the Dragon_, where the villain parodies Mr. Han's hand by feature an even wider array of attachments. Like a flamethrower. And a vibrator.
-   _Lifepod_ has the 'Toolies', a sub-species of dwarf-sized humans who underwent surgery to have tool adapters on one of their arms.
-   _The Machine Girl_ (_Kataude Mashin Garu_) features a Japanese schoolgirl who loses her arm to the mob and replaces it with a machine gun as well as a chainsaw.
-   In Robert Rodriguez' _Planet Terror_, Rose McGowan's character, a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling, loses a leg early in the movie and has it replaced by a peg, and later, a machine gun/grenade launcher. That's right, it's a gun leg. Rule of Cool keeps it from exploding from all the dirt that would get packed into the barrel.
-   Robocop fits this trope more and more as the film series progresses. In _RoboCop 3_, he gets an Arm Cannon with an underslung grenade launcher, and a data interface on his normal hand. However, one of his forearms has to be detached with his other hand in order to exchange it for the Arm Cannon.
-   The T-X from _Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines_ has one of these: the liquid metal lets it be a normal hand, else it can fold about into a variety of weapons. The ones we see used are a plasma cannon, a nanomachine injector, and a flamethrower, but her navigational screen indicates there are around two dozen alternates. Including an M-41 Pulse Rifle, apparently.
-   Judge Doom from _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ has a golden one with an anvil at the end of it, which then becomes a buzzsaw.

    Literature 

-   Not an appendage, strictly speaking, but Arno Blunt in _Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code_ acquires a wide variety of bizarre false teeth at some point after having his real teeth knocked out by a sonic grenade.
-   Etienne d'Arcachon of _The Baroque Cycle_ by Neal Stephenson has a number of replacements for his missing hand, including at least one that can't be described in polite company. Yevgeny the Raskolnik has a few as well, including a flail and a cannonball to act as a counterweight for throwing harpoons.
-   Hal from _The Brotherband Chronicles_ makes one of these for Thorn, with interchangeable parts depending on what he wants to do.
-   Herzer Herrick, from John Ringo's _Council Wars_ series, uses a nifty prosthetic hand that combines a clamp and a shear with a torque amplification system befitting both the series's Anachronism Stew and his own Canon Sue status. It even opens beer bottles, though he'd much prefer to have a real hand. As both a high ranking officer, and the consort of one of the most powerful women on the planet, he could easily get his hand regrown. It's a matter of personal honor that he won't do so until after the war is over.
-   Mannie, the protagonist of _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_ by Robert A. Heinlein, has a number of different arms capable of accomplishing various mechanical tasks, as well as a "social arm."
-   Princess Langwidere in _Ozma of Oz_, one of the Oz books by L. Frank Baum, has thirty heads that she hot-swaps depending on her desired appearance.
    -   She became the spectacularly nightmarish Princess Mombi in the movie _Return to Oz_.
-   _Quantum Gravity_: Lila has some weaponry in her arms. When they start developing new functions on their own, it is explicitly noted as odd. On the other hand, she's magic-stained and has elementals floating around in there, so what do you expect?
-   Eugenides in Megan Whalen Turner's _Queen's Thief_ series has a few different prosthetics he uses to replace his missing hand, including a cosmetic false hand and a hook that he's used to kill a would-be assassin.
-   Dag in Lois McMaster Bujold's _Sharing Knife_ series. Unlike most fictional Swiss Army Appendage users, the book is not shy about the problems it causes, from straps going loose in battle, to the time it takes to switch arms, to the additional strain it puts on his body to have to support the unnatural stresses.
-   Gil Terry from _Space Vulture_ has an alien cricket arm and a telescoping beetle eye. He lost his real body parts in a sports bet and had them replaced with non-species-specific spares, much to his displeasure.
-   Artificial Human Modular Man in the _Wild Cards_ Shared Universe, as his name suggests, is this trope taken to its logical end.
-   In _Will Destroy the Galaxy for Cash_, the Gentleman Thief Daversham Derby has one of his forearms removed and replaced with a cylinder shaped device that gives him whatever tool he needs; however, this is because the device creates a miniature portal (called quantunneling) to a room in some other part of the galaxy where his assistant inserts whatever tool he non verbally requests through the mouth of the portal.

    Live Action TV 

-   Mr. Slurm, the woodshop and driver's ed teacher on _The Adventures of Pete & Pete_, has a hand missing. He replaces it with different tools, and occasionally a prosthetic hand, as the occasion warrants.
-   _The Book of Boba Fett_: Once the Mods catch up with the majordomo in the chase through Mos Espa, the two flanking his speeder start sabotaging the engines with their cybernetic apparati. One produces a cutting torch out of his forearm and cuts a deep gash into one of the engine nacelles.
-   Riderman, from _Kamen Rider V3_, has this for a right arm. Called the "Attachment" or "Cassette" Arm, it can switch between Normal, Rope (Hook, Mace, and Scythe options), Net, Power (claw), Drill, Repair (mostly for other cyborgs), and Machine Gun(!) Arms - simply by switching out a cartridge in the elbow. This is his _only_ cybernetic adjustment in the original series, which makes him something of a Badass Normal.
    -   The Zect Troopers in _Kamen Rider Kabuto_ use a variation/homage of this, designed to fit over a normal arm and perfectly capable of taking down weaker foes.
    -   Given that Riderman's is the first live-action use of this trope in Japan, and in the early-to-mid-70s besides, it can be reasonably assumed that this is the source of most other Japanese versions nowadays (Barrett Wallace's "Atomic Scissors" resemble the Power Arm, and he's also got a "Drill Arm", for example).
    -   Similar to Riderman, Kamen Rider Super-1 has the Five Hands system that lets him equip different abilities: besides his default Super Hands, he has the Elek Hands, the Power Hands, Thermal Hands (flamethrower in one arm, cryogenic spray in the other), and Radar Hands (wide-area scanning and homing missiles).
    -   Kamen Rider Fourze Homages Super-1; each arm _and_ leg is able to equip a wide variety of gear including rockets, drills, missile launchers, hammers, shields, winches, medkits, and lots more. And that's not even getting into Fourze himself being a Swiss-Army Hero as was common for the Heisei era.
-   Torque, Robert Conrad's sidekick in the TV spy show _A Man Called Sloane_, had a selection of attachments, one of which was a mini-flamethrower he used to light his cigars with.
-   The _Odd Squad_ villain the Utensiler (and her kid sister) have hands that are giant Swiss army knives, allowing them to manifest whatever utensil they might require, up to and including a vacuum cleaner. However, her hands no longer function as hands and she requires someone to open doors for her.
-   Boomer of _Pair of Kings_ has a "Swiss army toe" that can, among other implied skills, uncork bottles.
-   Kryten of _Red Dwarf_ plays it for laughs with his groinal socket attachment system.
-   The Borg from _Star Trek_ have a selection of cybernetic arm attachments — and _every damn one of them_ is Nightmare Fuel.
-   _Tokusou Robo Janperson_ uses this, with the addition that his right arm can be launched off as a wired Rocket Punch. The attachments include a sword, a flamethrower and an actual Rocket Punch.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Battlelords of the 23rd Century_ supplement _Lock-N-Load: The Battlelord's War Manual_. A Snap-On Interface allows the user to swap his weapon cybernetic limbs with normal-appearing limbs to avoid attention.
-   _BattleTech_: Omnimechs are a special type of Battlemech with modular weapon systems mounts. This allows technicians to swap out the weaponry, whether it's in the mech's arms or torso, in a matter of hours rather than taking multiple days like a similar change-out would take on a standard mech. There's also a Battle Armor device, the Modular Weapon Mount, that allows Battle Armor to perform in a similar capacity.
-   In _Cybergeneration_, the Tinman character types have all four limbs replaced with these. A skilled Tinman can do truly impressive things with them, even, if the GM permits it, glide by turning their limbs into airfoils.
-   Naturally, this is an option in several Cyberpunk games, such as _Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0_, _Shadowrun_, and _GURPS Cyberpunk_.
-   In the _d20 Modern_ campaign setting, _Otherverse America_, one character class, the Midwives, are doctors who can transform their bionic arms into a variety of medical and surgical equipment.
-   _Exalted_
    -   The Infernal Exalted have access to a number of demonic "enhancements," one of which is called the Fourfold Demon Arm. It can become a normal human hand, a claw, a tentacle, or any non-ranged weapon, though each one only has four possible transformations. Still not as nasty of some of the other Body Horror in _Exalted_, especially if you get into Necrotech and Necrosurgery.
    -   An even better example occurs with the Alchemicals, who are effectively cyborgs, and have an enhancement called Omni-Tool Implant which replaces a character's hand with a device which looks like a hand, but can unfold to produce so many tools that the character is considered to have a master level workshop no matter where they go, which essentially means they have every tool necessary to produce any kind of mundane object, up to and including things that would require a forge to produce. One of the upgrade submodules turns it into a highly advanced piece of surgical equipment.
-   In _Hc Svnt Dracones_ the half-mechanical, half-synthetic biological Cogsune have modular arms, legs, and tails that they can swap out on the fly. And the "standard" limbs can transform into the more specialized ones, many of which have reality warping abilities. i.e. the "basic" tail acts as a Bag of Holding.
-   Chaos Obliterators in _Warhammer 40,000_ combine this with Shapeshifter Weapon: they can morph their bodies into just about anything that's needed. This being 40k, "anything that's needed" usually equates to "whatever weapon is most handy at the time", though presumably even living daemonic war machines need a screwdriver or a crowbar or something occasionally. Why would an Obliterator need a crowbar in 40k? The most obvious need would be to open doors or crates, but then we're talking _ten-foot mountains of flesh, metal and gun_. Chaos isn't famed for common sense either; the whole faction seems to be either The Starscream or the kind to shoot out a door before asking if someone's on the other side.
-   By making the best of the powerful curse she's under, Jacqueline Montarri has become one of the most adaptable villains in the _Ravenloft_ setting. Having lost her own head centuries ago, she decapitates other women and wears theirs, instead. And she gains any class-based abilities which those unfortunate ladies might've possessed in the bargain. If she ever offers to show you her "collection", don't accept, because it's _not_ stamps or butterflies.

    Toys 

-   This was the schtick of the _G.I. Joe Cobra_ B.A.T., B.A.T. MkII, and it's final iteration Overkill produced by Hasbro. The right had could be switched out for a grabber claw, a laser gun, and, the case of the latter two, a spring loaded rocket launcher. Presumably the nub the hands attached too was also how they plugged into normal electrical outlets they used to recharge.
-   As per his character in _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe_ Trapjaw came with a number of hands he could switch around. On the good guys' side, Roboto had the same gimmick.
-   Ideal produced a figure in the 70s called _J.J. Armes_, a cyborg detective whose main selling point was an arsenal of snap-on hands.

    Video Games 

-   Fritz from _Brain Dead 13_ replaces his hook hands with all kinds of melee weapons, guns, and other props (blender, electric razor, etc).
-   The old Megadrive/Genesis game _Cyborg Justice_ gave you (and level bosses) the ability to rip arms off enemies and swap them with yours. The options included a circular saw, Rocket Punch and Lasers. Or you could just throw it back at them.
-   In _Evolution: The World Of Sacred Device_, all but two of the party members use Cyframes, ancient technology that has been repurposed for combat. Of the cyframes, two fit this trope the most:
    -   Mag Launcher's Cyframe is the Airacomet, a giant hand. Aside from its most obvious function (punching the crap out of things), it can be equipped with various parts to give it a wider variety of other attacks and abilities, including but not limited to elemental punches (of the Fire, Ice, Lightning variety), crushing enemies with a giant hammer, and spraying noxious fumes from a giant aerosol can. Mag also plays with this trope, as his Airacomet functions more akin to a third arm than a replacement limb.
    -   The sequel introduces Carcano, who's cyframe is a bazooka that replaces his seemingly-lost left arm, making him a more traditional example.
-   Barrett in _Final Fantasy VII_ replaces his amputated right arm with an Arm Cannon. There are also several weapons for him that aren't guns, but scissors or blades. And a boxing glove. In _Advent Children,_ after he has become a rich oil magnate, he gets an arm that can be changed from normal prosthetic hand to machine gun to laser cannon, etc., at will, without the necessity of detaching it.
-   Baiken of the game series _Guilty Gear_ lost an arm and an eye. Despite it being 20 Minutes into the Future, she didn't opt for a prosthetic. Instead she just filled that shirt sleeve with all kinds of stuff loosely attached to her shoulder, including a raking claw on a chain, and a fireworks launcher.
-   _Mega Man's_ Arm Cannon was this, in his original incarnation of Rock. This was before he had to be weaponized. May be a borderline case for this trope, as he shapeshifts/replicates things instead of hot-swapping.
    -   Technically, his "Swiss Army Appendage" got weaponized as well into his ability to adapt new weapons.
    -   Note: Rock is, and always was, Mega Man's "birth" name, and is his name when he's Clark Kenting, no matter what _Mega Man Powered Up_ says.
    -   In the animated series, Roll also has one of these.
    -   In _Mega Man Legends_, Volnutt's right arm is a very literal interpretation of this. While he has his Arm Cannon on his left arm, he also has a veritable assortment of special weapons that he can equip and swap out onto his right arm, ranging from drills, to machine guns, to shields, to homing missiles, to grenades, to swords...
-   _Metal Gear: Ghost Babel_: Black Arts Viper's left arm is a prosthetic which is apparently full of explosives and other combat-useful gadgets that he can use on the fly, giving him his name. However, the only indication we have of this outside of an informative CODEC conversation is a cutscene when his hand morphs into a projectile weapon, which he uses fairly sparingly during the ensuing battle.
-   The main character in _The Potter And The Mould_ possessed limited shapeshifting abilities which allowed him to turn his hand into all sorts of useful doohickies, from a crowbar to a screwdriver to an indestructible container for some pretty powerful acid.
-   Ustanak from _Resident Evil 6_ lost his arm before receiving his upgrade and it didn't regenerate afterwards, so instead he was fitted with various cybernetic attachments which he replaces as the situation demands. The default seems to be an oversized metal claw with built-in syringes (useful for capturing individuals and taking samples from them in a single move), but he's also seen with a drill set, a machine gun, a grenade launcher and a flail on retractable cable.
    -   Rather gruesome organic example in _Resident Evil 5_ where Wesker finally goes One-Winged Angel and has his arms replaced with hideous viral tentacles. The larger right one has sharp metal chunks entangled in it and is mostly swung around but can also fold into gigantic drill or be used as pogo stick to leap great distances. The left one can shoot viral mass as a projectile and extends to enormous range to grapple at things.
-   Depending on whether you want to play _Gyromite_ or _Stack-Up_ with it, the Robotic Operating Buddy will either have hands made of claws to hold gyros, or foam grips to hold blocks.
-   Shuzer, one of the villains in Red's story in _SaGa Frontier_, has detachable clawed hands. The hands are able to attack on their own while detached, and while they're off he can use the stumps left behind as machine guns and flamethrowers.
-   In the same vein as Barret above, Drachma from _Skies of Arcadia_ has a wide variety of hands to fix to his mechanical arm. None are guns, but there's a variety of hooks, claws, prosthetics, blades, and what-have-you.

    Web Animation 

-   In _Monkey Wrench_, Queen Tyneen the Space Pirate has a cybernetic left hand which can transform into a buzzsaw or act as a Grappling-Hook Pistol.

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Bird Feeder_, Josh's cap's abilities are a Running Gag in the comic. While he is a black-capped chickadee, and his cap ought to be an actual appendage, it appears that it's also removable. He claims that it's made of high-carbon surgical stainless steel, the bill can have a sharp point if needed, and it's shown to be extendable.
-   The Mad Scientist in _Exploitation Now_ has a robotic hand; there's some deconstruction in play since, due to the asymmetry in her weight being bad for her back, she has to take it off regularly, for instance in the shower. It comes with a vibrate function in addition to all the tools and weapons you'd expect.
-   _Girl Genius_: Captain Hawkins' prosthetic hand is shown to quickly switch between attachments, those seen include a Hook Hand, sword and slingshot.
-   A rare leg-based example in _Leif & Thorn_, Birch's foot can be swapped out for other attachments, like a clamp.
-   In _Umlaut House_, decapitated Mad Scientist Rick Hundecoph has entire _bodies_ which he could switch between, including a female one which was used the first time he met his fiance's parents (Jake being stuck in the closet at the time).

    Western Animation 

-   Baron DeKlau in the Animated Adaptation of _Ace Ventura_, after having his hand bit off by _rabid squirrels_. He has a regular cosmetic hand designed to resemble a claw-fingered monster hand which can be swapped out for a variety of things such as a machete, a bullhorn, a grappling hook, a toilet paper roller and a metal pincher.
-   _Adventure Time_: Late in the show's run, Finn gets a robotic arm created by Princess Bubblegum. The episode "Three Buckets" reveals it has many ancillary functions, most of which Finn doesn't understand and only uses by accident.
-   Both Warp Darkmatter and XL in _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ have a mechanical arm that can transform into a variety of tools and weapons, including (in the latter's case) mundane things like eggbeaters.
-   Much like the _Teen Titans_ example below, Cyborg in _DC Super Friends_ has tons of gimmicks built into his body, but his lean more towards the Inspector Gadget end of the spectrum, with extending legs and a radar dish in his head.
-   In _The Fairly OddParents!_, Truant Officer Shallowgrave has a hook that can turn into tools and weapons.
-   The _Family Guy_ episode "Joe's Revenge" reveals that Quagmire has a Swiss army _penis_.
-   Hoss Delgado from _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ has a hand that seems to turn into anything imaginable. Even things that seem useless.
-   In _Final Space_, it's revealed later on that Gary Goodspeed's prosthetic arm can transform into a number of weapons, including an Arm Cannon and a Blade Below the Shoulder.
-   Trap-Jaw in _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)_ has several attachments he uses; approximately a dozen in the original cartoon, though naturally the toy is limited to three. In the update, it only seems to have the claw and blaster, but no longer requires attachments, able to transform from one to the other as needed.
-   _Inspector Gadget_. The title character's entire body is literally made of this trope.
-   _Jackie Chan Adventures_: In an homage to _Enter the Dragon_, Jackie Chan once fights a villain with different prosthetic hands. When going unarmed against the villain's weaponized hand, Jackie grabs other hands, which turn out to have rather mundane uses, like toothbrushes, instead of weapons.
-   _Kaeloo_: The alien sheep not only naturally have weapons as appendages, the weapons are replaceable.
-   _Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart_: Badgerclops' robotic arm can produce more than just an arm cannon. It also has a vacuum, water-sprinkler, spatula, makeup applicator, microphone, audio-diary, MP3 player, sniper rifle, hammer, grappling hook and lord only knows what it _can't_ do.
-   Parodied (obviously) in the Animated Series of _The Mask_ with the titular character's form of 'Toolverine', whose forearms are literally replaced by giant swiss army knives.
-   In _Men in Black: The Series_, Jay is once given the powers of a Swiss Army knife, literally giving him Swiss Army appendages.
-   In _Ozzy & Drix_, Drix has an Arm Cannon that seems to be equipped with everything. This is lampshaded in one episode where it even has a blender mixer, and Maria asks why a cold pill would need that. His response? "You know, sometimes I wonder that myself!"
-   In the 80's cartoon _She-Ra: Princess of Power_, the villain Hordak was able to morph his hand into a variety of useful items.
    -   Hordak could morph his _entire body._
    -   Due to animation limitations at the time, Modulok got this ability too instead of being able to swap out body parts like his toy.
-   In _Steven Universe_, Peridot's limb enhancers can do a whole load of things, as long as the fingers are positioned right. They can form screens (which in turn contain her data and logs, and can operate other gem tech), helicopter rotor blades which she can use to fly and hover, an Arm Cannon, a tractor beam, and they can emit bursts of electricity. She also occasionally uses them to emote what she wants (ie: turning them into arrows while pointing at something she wants Steven to fix). When not in use, they act as regular hands.
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_:
    -   Cyborg has a cybernetic arm that transforms from hand to big cannon to whatever else seems particularly plot-relevant at the time. Then again, thanks to his cybernetics, he has more of a Swiss Army Half-Body, as writers tend to use his technological enhancements as a bit of a Deus ex Machina.
    -   This also happens to Robin in "Fracture". "Larry" (who is from another dimension) accidentally changes Robin's arm while trying to heal it from a fracture. He fails, changing it from everything from a baseball bat to a chainsaw.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   In _The Transformers_, many of the various characters have been seen withdrawing their hands into their forearms and extending new tools. Ironhide uses this especially often.
    -   Lockdown of _Transformers: Animated_ can change out his arms and weaponry with other parts—from other Transformers. They aren't always dead when he tears the pieces off.

    Real Life 

-   A number of French amputees of World War I returned to work after the war, and got various tools strapped to their arm stumps, such as scythes for agricultural work or hammers and wrenches for mechanical/industrial work.
-   Aron Ralston, the mountain climber who cut his arm off below the elbow to free himself after being trapped by a boulder for five days, has the option of attaching a hook, an enhanced plastic hand, or a rock-climbing pick<small>◊</small> to his prosthetic forearm.
-   A climber named Hugh Herr lost his lower legs to frostbite while climbing in 1982. By 1992, he's an inventor of human-assist devices, and one of his sets of prosthetic legs is built for climbing. They're about a foot longer than his natural set, and have specially-designed feet for finding footholds, to the point where his climbing buddies say he has an _unfair advantage_. He's now an Associate Professor at MIT.
-   Double amputee Aimee Mullins has about a dozen different prosthetic legs, including the special sprinting legs that made her famous when she ran track for Georgetown University, the legs that make her six inches taller than normal (yes, a double amputee has done runway modeling), and the clear plastic legs she wore in a movie. For a TED talk, she describes how she was talking to a class of children, and one girl posed the question: Why couldn't she get jet legs and fly?
-   Nadya Vessey lost both her legs when she was a child and had a prosthetic mermaid tail created for her so that she could swim.
-   J.J. Armes (mention up in Toys) is an actual person.
