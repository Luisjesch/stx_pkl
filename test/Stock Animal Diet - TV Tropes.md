This is one of the most prevalent Animal Stereotypes. Animal characters, whether Talking Animals or Funny Animals, love a certain kind of food to the point of obsession (they go crazy for it) or exclusivity (they eat nothing else).

Which food the animal character loves is determined mostly by the character's species and is usually universal across series, companies, and even media. Sometimes these diets are true. For example, cats really do go nuts for fish. Others are so ridiculously false that it's amazing they ever got started, but have been presented to us as true so often, that it's weird to think that they can't be true. Can you imagine a mouse not liking cheese? It isn't good for them.

Compare Trademark Favorite Food for human characters. Occasionally constitutes Artistic License – Animal Care if the stereotypical diet is actually dangerous.

    Ants 

Anything in a picnic basket. (Exaggerated compared to real life; ants prefer sweets, though it depends on the species.) Egg yolk, sugar and honey also show up in some works. In real life, ants are one of those clades that're so diverse that you can name pretty much anything digestible and there'll probably be a species of ant that eats it.

___

-   _American Girl_: One self-help book about dealing with disasters (_Yikes! A Smart Girl's Guide to Surviving Tricky, Sticky, Icky Situations_) has an illustration of a girl reading an enormous book titled "How to Survive an Ant Attack" while an army of ants is approaching her picnic.
-   In the _Atomic Betty_ episode "Betty Vs. The Giant Killer Ants" has 135 giant ants attack because Minimus spilled growth nectar on them. Sparky says "There goes my picnic lunch!"
-   _Cyanide and Happiness_: One web short features a morbidly humorous twist on the egg-yolk version.
-   _Donald Duck_: On one occasion, Donald has to contend with a literal tribe of feather-wearing, hollering native American ant natives intent on carrying away his food.
-   _Discworld II_: In the adventure game, you have to catch an ant colony by luring them with a picnic basket full of food.
-   _Garfield and Friends_ features ants who not only take food, but _sing_ about it.
    
    _Oh, we're the ants who ruin your dinner!  
    We're always here to mess up every day!  
    When we're around, every camper gets thinner!  
    'Cause when we get the chance, we will taaaaaake, your food away!_
    
-   _Picnic Panic_: The objective of the game is to stop ants from carrying away food in your picnic basket.
-   _Tom and Jerry_: A few cartoons have this, such as when Spike the bulldog is having a picnic with his son and ants begin carrying sandwiches and apples away with them.
-   _The Far Side_: One comic shows a line of ants making their way towards a broken Humpty Dumpty.
-   Before the days of serum glucose tests, one way to see if a person had diabetes would be to spill some of his/her urine on the ground (or have him/her urinate on the ground), and see if ants came towards the puddle. If they did, then the patient was diabetic; the disease causes the presence of glucose in urine. In fact, this is how the disease got its name: Diabetes Mellitus means "honey passing through."
-   _The Price of Sugar_: A poor artist, tired of ants stealing her sugar, leaves a bowl of sugar out every day for them so they'll stop raiding her kitchen. When her racist Cranky Neighbor threatens to report her for feeding ants, the ants kill him and turn his remains into bone carvings for the artist to sell as jewelry.
-   In the _Rugrats_ episode "Grandpa's Bad Bug" the babies try to get the "bad bug" out of Lou. Lil's suggestion is to have a picnic because she remembers their picnic being invaded by ants.

    Anteaters/Aardvarks 

Ants. Truth in Television for the most part. In real life, anteaters and aardvarks prefer to prey on termites, though of course they won't turn down the opportunity to raid an anthill should they come across one (the issue is more opportunity than preference—termites tend to be easier to get than ants where these animals live—and frankly, there isn't much difference between ants and termites if you're eating them).

___

-   _The Ant and the Aardvark_: The main premise of the cartoon. The titular aardvark won't eat anything but ants, and he has his eyes set on the titular insect.
-   _Arthur_: The title character is an obvious exception. Lampshaded in "Draw" when Francine tells Arthur to go eat an ant sandwich.
-   _B.C._: The anteater is usually hunting the ants.
-   _Muppet Babies (1984)_: In one episode, Gonzo imagines himself as an anteater going to an anteater restaurant. At the restaurant, his anteater siblings order ant burgers and red ant milkshakes. Gonzo doesn't want to eat ants, but his anteater mother said that he won't get termite tapioca for dessert if he doesn't eat his ants. That's when Gonzo finally admits that he's not an anteater as his imagination fades out.
-   _Pokémon_: Heatmor (fiery anteaters) are described as natural predators of Durant (metal ants). This even extends to their typing — Heatmor is a Fire-type, to which Durant's Bug/Steel dual typing has a 4x weakness.
-   _Shirokuma Cafe_: Played with. Even though Anteater the tamandua (an arboreal species of anteater) enjoys eating ants, he sometimes wants to eat something else like ramen.
-   _Happy Tree Friends_: Sniffles, although his attempts usually backfire and end up in him being tortured by the ants he attempts to eat.

    Bats 

Because bats are creepy, expect bats in fiction to be of the bloodsucking type (and, if they speak, speaking with an eastern European accent, complete with Vampire Vords), despite those being a minority in the bat order (3 species out of 1,240) and mostly exclusive to Latin America. Rarely a bat will be depicted as preferring small fruits or insects, with those being more common in Real Life. The sole exception is in documentaries and educational series, in which case you can likely expect real facts and sometimes even An Aesop about bats being important to nature — _The Magic School Bus_, _Bear in the Big Blue House_ and _Blue's Clues_ have all done this.

___

-   _The Batman_: When Kirk Langstrom first transforms himself into Manbat, one of the first things he does is raid the zoo and drains several animals completely of blood. When Batman hears a report about this he grumbles to himself "Langstrom couldn't have used fruits bats?" Granted, Langstrom's motivation was to be feared as the "ultimate" bat, so he likely chose vampire bats on purpose.
-   _The Butterfly Ball_: The Brown Bat is accurately portrayed as an insectovore ... which still comes under "bats are creepy", given that many of the characters are insects.
-   An episode of _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_ had Fat Cat using a trio of Jamaican bats to rob transport helicopters. He paid them in fruit, which they left at the scene of the crimes.
-   In _Eureeka's Castle_, Batly loves bugs of all kinds.
-   _Yooka-Laylee_: Subverted. Laylee is claimed by the creators to be a fruit bat, although the game suggests she also likes to eat insects.

    Bears (brown and black) 

Honey. This one is actually true. Bears go mad over honey and will raid hives when they find them. The crunchy bee larvae are a protein-packed bonus. In fact, some languages' word for "bear" actually translates to "honey-eater"; _see_, _e.g._, the Russian медведь _medvédʹ_. Bears go absolutely gaga over _any_ sweet food; it's genetic. Condensed milk is a perennial favorite of polar bears, who hardly ever have anything sweet in their normal diet. Aside from honey, fish, berries, and contents of pick-a-nic baskets are the only things bears will typically eat in fiction. However, if Bears Are Bad News is in play, you can expect them to also eat humans, which real life bears hardly ever do, and when they do it's normally because they're sick or starving. Bears are omnivores, after all, and campers in bear territory have to store their food where hungry and curious ursines can't get at them (usually, this means a tree branch high and strong enough to carry the pack, but inaccessible to even the most determined bear).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Anthropomorphic bears might also be seen eating porridge as a reference to _The Three Bears_.

Polar bears and pandas have their own folders.

___

-   In _Ace Ventura: The Animated Series_, Ace had to find the missing salmon after bears start attacking the fishermen.
-   _Banjo-Kazooie_: One half of the title duo is a bear, and indeed the Life Meter in this game is made of honeycombs.
-   _Bear in the Big Blue House_: The titular Bear loves honey and berries, as does Ojo.
-   Given a dystopian twist in _Beastars_, bears are required to take medication that limits their strength to avoid accidentally hurting people, and honey counteracts the side effects.
-   _Beowulf_. No bears appear, but the hero's name means "bear". Or rather, it's a kenning for it, because what it literally means is "bee-wolf" — the animal that acts like a wolf toward bees.
-   In _The Berenstain Bears_, the bears are basically humans in the books' world, so they pretty much eat anything else that's edible. It's pretty fitting since, as noted above, bears are omnivores (like humans). Still, they especially love honey, berries and fish. For example, in _...No Girls Allowed_, Mama and Papa lure the boys to the girls' clubhouse with a lunch of barbecued honeycomb and salmon, and in the Thanksgiving Episode _...Give Thanks,_ after Sister becomes attached to the live turkey who was supposed to be their dinner, they end up having a honey-baked salmon instead.
-   In _Boonie Bears_, the titular bears are shown on several occasions to have a fondness for honey, especially Bramble. The series' second end credits theme, "My Honey", is about a bear describing their affinity for the food and how they prefer it over anything else the forest has to offer.
-   _Brave_: Merida and her mother-turned-bear Elinor enjoy a daughter-mother moment by catching fish at a nearby river. Unfortunately, this becomes one of the first instances of her mother succumbing to the bear's instincts. In the previous scene, Merida wakes up to find that Elinor has gathered a meal of berries — though this probably isn't _too_ linked to her bear instincts, as Merida has to inform her the berries are poisonous.
-   _Brother Bear_: Fish is depicted as the main diet of the movie's bears. The sequel also has berries, which is another thing that bears eat.
-   _The Ed Sullivan Show_: Bears' love for anything sweet includes ice cream, as Ed Sullivan found out when he was holding an ice cream cone for a dancing bear doing his act. When it started melting, Sullivan took a lick and the bear saw that, roared in outrage and charged him for mooching on his ice cream.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_: If you raid the bodies of dead werebears, you may find a jar of honey.
-   In "The Fox and the Crow", a bear tries to bribe the crow with honey in exchange for his slice of cheese. But it backfires, as the crow does not like honey.
-   _The Great Muppet Caper_: Subverted. When the airplane crew member walks into the 9th class section where Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo are<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Fozzie says, "Oh, maybe they're bringing hamburgers." Played straight in _The Muppet Movie_, where he buys a honey ice cream cone (and a dragonfly ripple for Kermit). In the first episode of _The Muppets (2015)_, when Fozzie has dinner with his human girlfriend and her parents, he compliments the salmon, and the father sarcastically comments "Oh, what a surprise, he likes the salmon."
-   Jan Brett's picture book of _Goldilocks and the Three Bears_ describes the bears' porridge as being served with honey, nuts and berries.
-   _Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_: An in-universe commercial has Michelle Monaghan's character interacting with a poorly CG animated talking grizzly for a fictional drink called "Genaros". Bear: "I'm for Genaros, but what do I know! I'm a bear! I suck the heads off fish!".
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_:
    -   Honeyvore bears, as their name implies, are fond of honey, something their Compendium entry points out. One location in the Crenel Hills includes a pair of honeyvore bears hanging around an alcove holding a beehive.
    -   The stronger and rarer grizzlemaw bears don't have this association, but drop hearty salmons when they're killed.
-   _Monster Hunter Portable 3rd_: The bear-like Fanged Beast Arzuros can be seen eating honey or Sushifish. It usually goes for the former if it's hungry, but sometimes it can toss up one of the latter offscreen in freshwater areas. The introduction video for the more powerful Zinogre monster, which shows a number of other creatures fleeing from its approach, includes an Arzuros caught in the middle of a honey meal, who gives the beehive it was eating from one last hesitant look before running away.
-   _Nursery Crime_: In _The Third Bear_, honey is a controlled substance for bears, along with marmalade and porridge.
-   Subverted in _Open Season_ While Boog does try out human junk foods (his favorite being Woo-Hoo chocolate bars) he does try (and fails) to catch some fish in a river.
-   _Paddington Bear_ subverts this, his Trademark Favourite Food being marmalade. Although there's a bit of correlation, in that it's sticky, sweet stuff that comes in a jar.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Ursaring are large grizzly bear-like Pokémon that snap trees with their forelegs to get berries. Its pre-evolution, Teddiursa, is always licking its paws because they’re soaked in honey. It’s also able to make its own.
    -   _Pokémon Sword and Shield_'s Isle of Armor DLC introduces Urshifu, a legendary Pokémon based on a bear. It can gigantamax, but it will refuse to eat Max Soup (which enables it to do so) unless the player gathers Max Honey from a Vespiquen’s tree first.
-   _Seeker Bears_: Subverted. The grizzly bears don't mind honey, but they're much more fond of meat.
-   _Survivor Dogs_: In the third book, the dogs come across a "giantfur" looking for honey. Judging by how it's described, it's a black bear.
-   In _The Three Stooges_ short "Idiot's Deluxe" a bear steals the stooges food as they're camping in the woods, and we get a long shot of the bear licking the honey out of a jar with its extremely long tongue.
-   _We Bare Bears_: The main bear trio are Big Eaters at most (though Panda's a vegetarian), but they are shown to love honey. Namely honey-flavored wasabi candies given to them by Chloe. The Bears' love for honey becomes a major problem in "Beehive", in which a colony of honeybees use this to make the Bears do their bidding. Deconstructed in "Bear Cleanse" where Grizzly has been given a diet of berries and fish by the request of their doctor who suggested that for 21 days the bears should eat what their respective species normally eat in the wild. Grizzly loves his new diet at first, but when he realizes that he must stick to the new diet without eating human foods during the requested time he starts losing his cool.
-   _Winnie-the-Pooh_ is notorious within his own stories for his love of honey. He’s also occasionally mentioned to be fond of condensed milk.
-   _Yogi Bear_: Yogi seems to prefer the delicacies of the pic-a-nic basket; he raids them exclusively. The association with honey is present in his Brazilian Dub Name Change, Zé Colmeia, which translates as "Beehive Joe".

    Bears (polar) 

Seals, fish and the Yupik, Inuit, and Aleut peoples. Real polar bears also supplement their diet with carrion, particularly beached whales. Some works also have them dining on the stereotypical denizens of Earth's other pole, the penguins.

___

-   In _Minecraft_, when a polar bear is killed, there's a high chance it will drop raw codfish and somewhat smaller chance it will drop raw salmon (although they do not attack live fish).
-   _Seeker Bears_: Being a polar bear, Kallik is especially fond of seals and fish.
-   _We Bare Bears_: Ice Bear is shown as an overall Supreme Chef, with fish as his Trademark Favorite Food. In "Bear Cleanse", he was rather surprised upon learning that his species eat seals, and when he manages to find a live one he couldn't bear himself to eat it and instead befriended it before releasing it into the wild.
-   In _The Whiteboard_, Doc once ate an entire fried walrus, though he couldn’t move afterwards, and has been seen eating “Harp Seal O’s” and seal tacos. He also threatens to eat cheaters at the paintball field, as does grizzly bear Bruno.

    Beavers 

Wood. This is sort of true, as beavers will eat the leaves, small twigs, and inner bark but not the entire log itself other than wearing it down. In terms of what they actually forage for when hungry, they're generalist herbivores.

___

-   In _The Angry Beavers_, the beavers not only ate wood (for example, they use wood shavings in their cereal), but chewed on it to keep their teeth from growing too long, which is true for beavers in Real Life.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In one episode, Norbert's refusal to chew on wood because his long teeth made him popular with the other animals caused his teeth to grow out of control and trap him (along with his brother Daggett, who also stopped chewing out of jealousy) in a cage made of their elongated front teeth.
-   _Franklin_: Beaver is occasionally seen chewing on wood. Especially notable is one episode where she fells a small tree with her teeth to demonstrate her skills to her friends.
-   _PB&J Otter_: Munchy is a beaver who will eat anything made out of wood. This has both put him into and helped him out of jams, such as the episode where he accidentally ate Pinch's dollhouse, but later rebuilt it.

    Bees and Wasps 

Flower nectar, which they also use to make honey (that they might consume as well). Pollen is rarer and usually treated more as an item for pollination than actual food, though real bees actually do eat it directly. Also royal jelly (consumed exclusively by queen bees) is probably even rarer. For wasps, they like picnic foods (especially if it is sweet-tasting) and other insects (including bees). Both are Truth in Television.

___

-   _Maya the Bee_ is usually seen collecting pollen and flower nectar in media she appears in, which tend to veer toward a semi-realistic portrayal of bees.
-   _Minecraft_: Bees are bred by giving them any sort of flower, and they spend most of the day pollinating flowers to produce honey and beeswax (which can be harvested). Their devotion to the act even extends to wither roses, which damage on contact and can kill them.
-   _Pathfinder_: Melixies are a type of fey who strongly resemble insect, and most often specifically resemble bees. They are also inveterate sweet teeth whose favorite foods are sugary liquids such as honey and nectar.
-   _SMITE_: The Mayan bee god Ah Muzen Cab has a liking for sweet things such as honey, as well as an ability that sprays honey onto the ground. If the honey is placed near a beehive (planted by another of his abilities), bees will swarm over the honey and attack any enemies that step in it.

    Beetles 

In Japanese works, watermelon is seen as stereotypical stag and rhino beetle food. Not really truth in television. While beetles will happily eat watermelon, the high water content may give them diarrhea (insects don't sweat or urinate, so that's the only way to get rid of extra water). Apples (that have excess juices squeezed out), bananas, and specially made beetle jelly are a better choice to feed captive beetles. Tree sap is another common preference shown in fiction, which is truth in television, as that's part of their diet in the wild. Ladybugs (called ladybirds in the UK), which are a kind of beetle, will always be shown eating aphids. Real ladybugs/ladybirds are mostly carnivourous, but feed on a wide range of insects, though they're also known to feed on pollen and other plant materials. As a whole however, beetles are, as with ants above, one of those clades that's so diverse that, you can name pretty much anything digestible and there'll probably be a species that eats it.

___

-   _Medabots_: Metabee is based on a rhino beetle and loves watermelon. In one scene, Metabee is lured into a trap with watermelon as bait. He also sleeps with a watermelon patterned blanket.
-   _Monster Rancher_: In _Monster Rancher 4_, the Melloncho, a hybrid of Beaklon and Pancho, is a tiny beetle inside a giant watermelon. Also in _4_, the rhino beetle monster Beaklon and any monster with Beaklon as a sub-breed will usually have watermelon as their favorite food.
-   _Pokémon_: The Japanese Beetle Brothers Pinsir and Heracross both tend to be depicted as having a strong taste for tree sap.
-   In _Show by Rock!!_, Kabutomoaki loves watermelon.
-   _Tokumei Sentai Go Busters_: The beetle-themed robot ranger Beet J. Stag is obsessed with tree sap, despite not actually being able to drink it.

    Birds 

Worms or seeds. "The early bird catches the worm" is an old proverb. Common rejoinders are "Big incentive", and "The second mouse gets the cheese". Budgies, chickens, crows, ducks/pigeons/sparrows, eagles, owls, parrots, penguins, and vultures have their own sections.

___

-   In _Adventures of the Gummi Bears_, the Carpies eat worms, despite resembling vultures.
-   Walter and Clay Pigeon from _Between the Lions_ love to eat seeds. They were also seen eating oats in one episode.
-   _The Bird Feeder_: Lampshaded in #27, "Worms." Terry complains about birds being known to only eat worms, as he finds them disgusting.
-   In _The Fox and the Hound_, the two bird characters (a finch and a woodpecker) are constantly trying to catch the 'fuzzy worm', who turns out to be a caterpillar.
-   _Looney Tunes_
    -   "Fair and Worm-er" has a complete cartoon food chain, part of which is a crow trying to hunt a worm.
    -   "A Fractured Leghorn" is an unusual example of a _chicken_ eating worms. The cartoon has Foghorn Leghorn hunting a worm, though he has to compete with a cat who plans to use it as fish bait.
-   _Neopets_: One type of Neopet available for adoption is called a Pteri, which is more or less a bird in all but name. Feeding it any "worm" food (even the Hot Worm Hot Dog, which is normally classified as a Gross Food) will make it full ("bloated"), cure it of any disease it is carrying, and restore all of its hit points.
-   The song "The Bird and the Worm" by Owl City opens with this:
    
    If you're the bird,  
    Whenever we pretend it's summer,  
    Then I'm the worm,  
    I know the part, it's such a bummer,  
    But fair is fair,  
    If my segments get separated,  
    I'll scream  
    And you'll be there
    
-   In _Ox Tales_, Audrey is an ostrich who likes to bury her head in the ground to look for worms to eat.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   _Pokémon: The Original Series_: In the third episode, Ash meets his Pidgeotto when it's eating a worm. It later tries to eat his Caterpie, a caterpillar-like creature.
    -   In the games, the Pokédex entry for Wurmple mentions it being prey to various bird Pokémon, such as the swallow-like Taillow and Swellow.
    -   The Pokédex entry for Grubbin (a worm-like beetle larva) mentions that Rookidee (a chickadee) is its natural enemy, although its large jaws are sometimes enough to deter the latter.
-   _Sesame Street_: Big Bird knows how to make a birdseed cake and birdseed cookies, eats birdseed toast for breakfast, orders birdseed milkshakes at the local soda shop...
-   _Stuart Little_: In the book, Mrs. Little rewards Margalo for saving Stuart's life by making her a tiny cake with seeds sprinkled on top.
-   Tex Avery: The worm variant shows up in _The Early Bird Dood It_.
-   _U.S. Acres_: A running gag has Booker the chick trying and failing to catch a worm.
-   In _Wile E Coyote And The Roadrunner_, Wile E. Coyote often tried to lure the Roadrunner into a trap by tempting it with bird seed. This is somewhat accurate in that roadrunners really do eat seeds some of the time, though going by the cartoon alone, you'd probably never guess that rodents, smaller birds and lizards and snakes take up a larger part of their diet.

    Budgies 

Millet. Budgies are typically very fond of millet, but it's unhealthy to give it to them often due to its high fat content and low nutrition.

    Cats 

Fish, meat, mice/rats, and/or birds. Cats, ambush predators who go after pretty much any animal smaller than them, were originally domesticated to hunt mice and other animals that infest grain stores. Of course, with fictional cats, actually _catching_ mice or birds is very rare. They can have better luck with fish though, at least sometimes; for many pet owners, tuna fish is like cocaine to their cats. Unfortunate too, as due to the mercury content in an unfortunate amount of tuna, it's not good for them in large amounts. Milk is also a popular treat for fictional cats, despite the fact that many cats can end up being lactose intolerant in real life. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In the dairy vein, cats generally _love_ cheese, especially ones that have been aged a bit (as those have more of the lactose fermented away). Despite media sensationalism of cats eating dead owners, this behavior is actually much more common amongst _dogs_ than it is cats. Cats are very picky about eating already dead meat (ever wonder why your cat would prefer to catch a mangy bird off your balcony than eat the expensive food you buy for him? This is why) and so generally only eat carrion as a last resort, while dogs are scavengers who will eat just about anything they can find, carrion or no. Catnip is sometimes portrayed, but it's treated like a narcotic. In reality, catnip is not addictive despite the cats who are affected by it seeming "high". They do, however, appear to feel _very_ good under its influence.

___

-   _30 Rock_: One of Liz Lemon's greatest fears is dying alone in her apartment and being eaten by her cats, which is one reason she didn't want to own pets.
-   _Axe Cop_: Apparently supreme happiness for cats (even if they're evil Siberian witch doctor mummy cats) is a mouse planet, entirely covered in mice, where they can just go on eating mice forever.
-   _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_: Alice's cat Dinah is allegedly "a capital one for catching mice" and loves to eat birds too — as Alice tactlessly mentions while talking to a mouse and a crowd of birds. She also gets a saucer of milk every day at teatime.
-   In the _Alice_\-inspired TV series _Adventures in Wonderland_, the Cheshire Cat loves to drink cream and his favorite pizza toppings are anchovies and catnip. Alice also sometimes mentions Dinah's fondness for tuna.
-   _Calvin and Hobbes_: Hobbes loves salmon and tuna fish.
-   Caravan Palace: In the music video to "Lone Digger", a trio of Funny Animal cats go to a strip club and drink shots of milk.
-   _CatDog_: Along with bones for Dog, fish was Cat's main motif throughout the series (in fact, half his house is made of a giant fish fused to a giant bone). Cat loved fish so much he once worked in the fire department simply because they had fish chili at the time.
-   _Cat Pack_: The cats are fond of seafood. They're also fond of mice, but they have a pact not to eat a mouse character or his family so they're not shown actually hunting mice.
-   _The Cat Piano_: Alluded to. In the narrator's home city inhabited entirely by anthropomorphic cats, a neon sign can be briefly seen outside a building that reads "The Milk Bar".
-   _CSI_: Used in at least one episode where a Crazy Cat Lady is killed and her starving cats eat into her corpse.
-   _Dominic Deegan_: Dominic's pet cat, Spark, is obsessed with fish.
-   In _Fairy Tail_, there exists a race of flying, talking cats that frequently have unusual fur colors, known as Exceed. Most of them prefer fish over other foods, especially Happy. Carla, however, defies this trope by spurning Happy's attempts to woo her with gifts of fish most of the time, and Pantherlily averts the trope by display seeing a strong liking for kiwi fruit and its juice.
-   In _Feed the Cat_, the cats eat fish.
-   _Futurama_: The talking cats of Thuban 9 recall their lost homeward as an idyllic place home to, among other things, great herds of "chicken-salmon".
-   In the _Game & Watch_ game _Tropical Fish_, any fish that fall on the floor will be eaten by a cat.
-   _Garfield_: Much to Jon's frustration, Garfield is disgusted by the idea of eating mice, and often treats them as friends. He once had to cover his eyes while Arlene caught a mouse and ate it. Birds and fish are not as lucky however, since he will gladly eat those (and not just cooked ones either, living ones too). He also likes to eat Jon's houseplants sometimes. Of course, his all-time favourite food is lasagna. Sometimes he talks with whatever he is about to eat.
-   In _Get Fuzzy_ tuna is Bucky's favorite. Averted for the mice part though, he's actually AFRAID of mice. He instead prefers to try and eat monkeys instead.
-   _Happy Heroes_: In Season 7, the Miaolings, an alien race of Funny Animal cats, like to eat fish.
-   _Heathcliff_: A Running Gag is Heathcliff robbing the fish market, and ambushing the milkman so he drops the milk.
-   In the _Inai Inai Baa!_ song "Neko Neko Shanshan", which is about cats, there is a line that goes "What is today's meal? Fish!" when describing hungry cats.
-   The kittens in _Kittens Game_ feed exclusively on catnip at the start of the game. An early upgrade allows you to build pastures to reduce catnip demand by farming unspecified animals, implied by the Flavor Text ("Take a pint o' milk, Sir!") to be solely for dairy.
-   _Krypto The Super Dog_: One episode has Krypto hit by a beam that causes him to engage in cat-like behavior, including having a large hankering for tuna fish.
-   In _Lady and the Tramp_, the two Siamese cats try to eat a goldfish, then try to sneak into the baby's room to steal his milk.
-   _LOLCats_ depicts cats as hankering for cheeseburgers and anything else on the table.
-   _Looney Tunes_:
    -   Sylvester the Cat usually engages in quixotic pursuits of Tweety the canary or Speedy Gonzales the mouse that far outweigh any benefits of catching them.
    -   Claude the Cat is so thoroughly Squicked by Hubie and Bertie trying to get him to eat them, that he couldn't eat mice, and so tried to get a dog to kill him. Similarly, in an earlier Sylvester cartoon, "Life with Feathers" a heartbroken lovebird tried to get Sylvester to eat him, but Sylvester wouldn't, thinking he was poisoned.
        
        **Sylvester:** (_caving in after being tempted_): I'll do it! I'd rather die than starve to death!
        
-   In _Madeline and the Easter Bonnet_, when the girls imagine people all over Paris crying because they have no milk, they also imagine a milk-craving cat crying over his empty bowl.
-   _Minecraft_: Cats are tamed and bred by feeding them raw fish. In line with the "cats eat birds" rule, ocelots will also go after chickens.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_: Plagg, a black cat-like kwami, loves Camembert cheese and can be found snacking on it at any given opportunity.
-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_: The proprietor of the cheese shop claims to have some "very runny" Camembert in stock, but checks again and says the cat ate it.
-   _Mouse Math_: Played with — the non-anthropomorphic cat is sometimes given milk to drink, though the main character, Albert, a Funny Animal mouse, notes that he read it makes cats' stomachs hurt.
-   _Oggy and the Cockroaches_: Oggy, despite eating tons of food cats shouldn't be eating, is a big fan of milk (he often heats it on the stove) and fish. He's actually too afraid of mice to even attempt to eat them.
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: Minerva, Mrs. Davis' pet cat, shows an affinity to several stock cat foods.

    -   In "Taxidermists", Minerva gobbles up a large fish Mr. Conklin intends to enter in a fishing contest.
    -   Minerva shows excitement anytime someone mentions mice in her presence.
-   _Persona 5_: The Phantom Thieves' resident sentient kind-of cat Morgana is nuts about sushi, specifically fatty tuna.
-   _RWBY_: When Blake Belladonna is revealed to be a Cat Girl Faunus, Ruby seems to think it explains why she eats so much fish. At the tournament in Volume 3, she has an extra portion of fish cooked specially for her noodles, and is the most enthusiastic of the team over the meal. The spinoff series, _RWBY Chibi_, also shows her wanting to eat all the fish when she and the other characters crash Weiss' beach vacation, and Weiss later attempts to buy her silence for a Noodle Incident with a lifetime supply of tuna.
-   _RWBY: Scars_: The cat Faunus Blake is a pescetarian who is especially fond of seafood.
-   _Shrek_: Puss in Boots is fond of milk. The spinoff film starring him and its sequel have it shows it as being the feline equivalent of alcohol, with the former having it being served at the cat tavern where he first meets Kitty, and the latter showing that it contributed to one of Puss' deaths when he jumped off a tower while under its influence after "drunkenly" claiming he'd land on his feet.
-   In _Supergirl_ story "Supergirls Super Pet", Streaky the Supercat -and every alley-cat in Midvale- crave for milk, to the point that Streaky bumps a milk truck, tipping over a bunch of milk-cans, just so all cats can have a free drink.
-   _Tailchaser's Song_: Cats are especially fond of "squeakers", a catch-all term for rodents and rodent-like animals.
-   _Tom and Jerry_:
    -   Tom often has a bowl of milk. Almost as often, Jerry tries to steal it from him. Just as often, however, he eats more human fare.
    -   Tom also often tries to eat birds, and the occasional fish, that Jerry befriends. He rarely tries to eat Jerry himself except in the shorts made by Chuck Jones.
-   Luxor from _Tutenstein_ loves his fish. In one episode where he and Cleo switch bodies, he requests a fish-flavored pizza while in her body, much to the disgust of her friends. And in the episode "Tut Jr." he requests tuna and liver as a snack to make Cleo's little cousin.
-   _Varjak Paw_: The city cats wish they could catch pigeons, but none are fast enough to so they're forced to eat human rubbish. Varjak is the first cat who figures out how to hunt birds.
-   _What Can I Say Except You're Welcome_: Princess Rhaenys' kitten Balerion accidentally kills her grandfather, the mad King Aerys II, by tripping him and making him fall down the steps of the Iron Throne. Her mother Princess Elia declares that Balerion is an agent of the Stranger who has been sent to punish them for holding a deadly mockery of a trial by combat. Somehow, this leads to a better future for all of Westeros, and the very last line declares:
    
    _Most of all, the salmon trade with Braavos explodes, as Balerion loves salmon. And the will of the gods is not to be ignored._
    
-   In _Warrior Cats_, all four Clans have territory-specific prey that they catch regularly, generally zig-zagging this trope in each individual case.
    -   ThunderClan, who live in a forest, eat squirrels, rabbits, voles, mice and various sorts of birds.
    -   RiverClan specializes in catching fish, which the other Clans — unusually enough — find gross and off-putting.
    -   WindClan tends to focus on the birds and rabbits available in their moorland home.
    -   SkyClan, whose own forest had little underbrush but a very thick canopy, ate tremendous amounts of birds. In the modern day, however, they have a fairly generalized feline diet.
    -   The Tribe of Rushing Water eats a lot of birds, up to and including raptors such as hawks and eagles, as well as fish, as that's what's available in their mountains.
    -   ShadowClan mostly averts this, eating lizards, frogs, snakes and rats (although that last one caused trouble for them when some cat dropped a contaminated rat on the fresh-kill pile and made the entire Clan sick).

    Chickens 

Corn, which is Truth in Television. Real-life chickens are omnivorous, though, and will happily eat both plant and animal matter. Corn, being mostly empty calories, should be given as a treat rather than a mainstay of a chicken's diet.

___

-   _Futurama_: The hyperchicken attorney nearly attacks a witness on the stand because he **thought** she was corn.
-   In _George's Marvellous Medicine,_ George gets a chicken to try his medicine because the chicken thinks the medicine is corn.
-   _Hay Day_: Chicken feed is made from 2 stalks of wheat and 1 ear of corn.
-   _Here Comes Peter Cottontail_: The hero has a rooster who is supposed to crow when the alarm clock goes off (I know, kid's movie, just go with it). The villain gives the rooster corn-flavored bubblegum to prevent the morning's wake-up call. The gum is of the overly-sticky variety and prevents the rooster from crowing properly.
-   _Silly Symphonies_: In "The Wise Little Hen", the eponymous hen tries throughout the short to get a pig and the debuting Donald Duck to help her plant her corn, but they fake a stomach ache, leading her and her chicks to do it themselves. The cartoon ends with the hen and her chicks enjoying a Food Porn feast of corn muffins, bread, soup, and butter-slathered corn on the cob, while Donald and the pig get only a bottle of castor oil to "cure" their stomachs.

    Cockroaches 

Like flies, they will be often seen eating rotten food, meal leftovers or any other disgusting shit they are able to find, including actual fecal matter. Some may even eat trash like used toilet paper or pizza cardboard boxes.

    Cows 

    Coyotes 

    Crocodiles/Alligators 

Humans, or just anything that moves. Truth in Television for a few large species crocodiles (mostly the Nile and Saltwater Crocodiles), which cause more human fatalities than any other predator and actually view humans as a food source; in fact, they will take on any sort of prey of suitable size. On the other hand, when on land, most crocodilians including alligators are more likely to run away from a human thanks to their low-set eyes (all they see are the feet of some giant, who may be a danger to them). In the water, though, you're on their turf. In some states with a high wild gator population, it's illegal to feed them, as this makes them more likely to approach a human than run away.

___

-   Alligators tend to have a taste for waterfowl and frogs.
    -   _Count Duckula_: In one episode, the Count attempts to get away from a gold-smuggling captain by jumping into the bayou and swimming back. The captain then proceeds to show him the alligators lurking in the bayou and asks him what their favorite dinner is. As the Count nervously tries to answer the captain explains it's duck. Upon hearing the word, the gators become excited, holding forks and knives.
    -   _The Princess and the Frog_: In their frog forms, Tiana and Prince Naveen are in danger of being eaten by a pack of alligators. This gets subverted by Louie, who shows no intention of eating anyone.
    -   _Sitting Ducks_: The alligators enjoy eating ducks, which in turn makes Bill and Aldo's friendship a forbidden one.
-   Nile crocodiles usually go after zebras and wildebeests, especially when they migrate across rivers.
    -   _Pearls Before Swine_: The crocodiles seek only to catch and eat zebras, and named their fraternity Zeeba Zeeba Eata. They never have any luck in catching the strip's resident stripy equine Zebra, however, due to their amazing stupidity.
-   _Batman_: Killer Croc (though he's technically a human with a genetic disorder that makes him look like an anthropomorphic crocodile) has been depicted as consuming human flesh in recent years.
-   _Kissyfur_: The alligators Floyd and Jolene are always trying to eat everything made of meat, especially the cubs of the series.
-   _Peter Pan_: The reason why Captain Hook hates Peter Pan is because Peter cut off his hand and threw it to a crocodile, and the crocodile liked the taste of Hook's hand so much that now he's always chasing him, and except in adaptations that spare him, finally gets him in the end. In some adaptations, including the the live action film and Fox' animated series, the crocodile is still a danger for everyone, not just Hook.

    Crows 

Corn, or sometimes other farm crops. Also carrion, especially eyes. Crows are opportunistic omnivores and scavengers and will eat just about anything they can get a hold of. This includes working in teams to steal food from other animals and even humans.

___

-   _Barney Bear_: The short "Cobs and Robbers" where Barney is a corn farmer and two crows dress in a scarecrow suit and try to steal his corn.
-   _Discworld_: Quoth the Raven makes a running gag out of his love for eating eyeballs.
-   _The Far Side_: One strip has crows about to enjoy an unusually generous portion of roadkill.
-   A _Family Guy_ cutaway gag shows a group of crows sitting on a power line, tricking a particularly annoying crow into dying a High-Voltage Death by telling him the telephone pole is full of corn.
-   _Little Bear_: One episode has a group of mischievous yet goodhearted crows eating from Little Bear's corn field.
-   The _Looney Tunes_ short _Corn Plastered_ revolves around a farmer in pursuit of a Clever Crow that keeps stealing his corn.
-   _Magic Adventures of Mumfie_ has the same thing as the _Wizard Of Oz_ example occur to the Scarecrow in that show, which could lead to funny moments.
-   One _The Pink Panther_ short has the titular cat run a corn stall only to be set upon by two hungry crows who repeatedly eat his wares. Eventually, he allows them to have _some_ corn... only for them to invite the rest of their friends to feast on the rest.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest_: Early in, crows are shown to eat eyes of living people locked in suspended cages.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Lord Commander Mormont's raven regularly begs for corn by name. Also, one of the books is called _A Feast for Crows_ — in reference to carrion, not corn.
-   _Warrior Cats_: The cat term for rotten meat no longer fit to eat is "crow-food".
-   _Winnie-the-Pooh_: Many segments involving Rabbit involve him being driven nuts by crows invading his garden.
-   In _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_, crows come from miles around to eat the corn in the Scarecrow's field and mock him.
-   A German children's song about horse riding has a verse which can be roughly translated as: "Does \[the rider\] fall into the trench, the ravens will eat him."

    Deer 

In Japanese works, deer are often shown to have a fondness for senbei rice crackers. This likely stems from the practice of vendors in the famous Nara Deer Park selling specially-made "shika senbei" to feed the deer. Because these deer have no fear of humans, they will line up to be fed them and some have even learned to "bow" for them. The shika senbei are only sold in Nara and not made for human consumption, but media will sometimes show any deer in any place eating regular rice crackers made for humans. Obviously, rice crackers aren't a part of a deer's natural diet.

___

-   _Katamari Damacy_: _We Love Katamari_ features deer humorously placed near rice crackers, and Flavor Text for deer in the collection notes that they love rice crackers, just like old men.
-   _Lucky Star_: One episode features the girls visiting Nara. In one scene, Tsukasa feeds the deer rice crackers and gets swarmed by them.
-   Nara's official mascot character is a deer named Shikamaro-kun, and quite a few of The Merch depicts him munching on shika senbei.
-   _Nichijou_: The principal attempts to distract an aggressive deer by feeding it rice crackers. It doesn't work.

    Dogs 

Bones, most commonly Stock Femur Bones. This is only partly true because dogs love _chewing_ on bones, since the act of chewing relieves stress and boredom. Actually _eating_ bones isn't the point, and can lead to throwing them back up if their stomach gets irritated from the bone shards. Many dog-owning tropers can attest to the fact that dogs will chew almost anything they're given. Or just happen to find.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  They may be after the marrow _inside_ the bones as well, or the connective-tissue coating (periosteum) that fresh bones have on their surfaces. Also sausages, and a common gag in cartoons is a dog running along with a sausage link, possibly being chased. In British comics, back in the days when butcher's shops were more common, dogs loving meat products, longingly looking at a butcher's shop window with their tongues hanging out and trying to steal strings of sausages from butchers making deliveries was almost as frequent as depicting dogs eating bones. Other commonly depicted, safer doggy delicacies include steak, bacon, cheese, and peanut butter; in darker works they also enjoy corpses, which is Truth in Television as almost all carnivores will scavenge opportunistically. In Real Life, dogs will go crazy for certain veggies like squash, sweet potatoes, and green beans, and those with a sweet tooth also tend to like fruits like bananas, though some can be oddly picky about it (refusing fresh banana but loving dried banana chips or vice versa, for example). Some dogs also like to chew on ice cubes, which can make an inexpensive and less fattening training treat if your dog likes them.

___

-   Some cartoons go as far as showing dogs hankering after fossilized bones, despite the fact they're made of stone.
    -   _Bringing Up Baby_: A key plot point is that Katherine Hepburn's dog has buried an important dinosaur bone that Cary Grant needs for his museum.
    -   _Jackie Chan Adventures_: In one episode, Jade's pet dog, Scruffy, is possessed by a demonic Japanese oni mask that mutates it into a gigantic beast. Before becoming completely taken over, Scruffy engages in typical dog antics, including stealing a dinosaur bone from the local museum and trying to bury it.
    -   Subverted in the _Looney Tunes_ short _Bone Sweet Bone_. It had a dog whose owner, a paleontologist, accused him of burying one of his dinosaur’s bones. As it turns out, the paleontologist had the bone with him the entire time.
    -   _Mega Babies_: A robotic dog is constructed to keep the trio of super babies company. Of course, the robot malfunctions, culminating in it causing trouble around the city, including stealing a generic dino bone.

    -   _Up_: One of Muntz's cleaning dogs is shown cautiously nibbling on his fossil displays when Muntz isn't looking.
-   _Adventure Time_ subverts this with Jake, whose Trademark Favourite Food is sandwiches. He does love bacon, though.
-   Aesop's Fables tell a fable about a dog who was carrying a bone and saw his reflection in a river. The dog, desiring the bone in his reflection's mouth, barked at it, dropping and losing his own bone, in order to tell a moral about the dangers of envy. Some versions of the story replace the bone with a piece of meat instead.
-   _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_: One of the riddles revolves around a dog getting angry because Alice took its bone.
-   The Beggin' Strips commercials feature the bacon variant.
-   In the Bible (and the rest of Abrahamic scripture), dogs are (more accurately) portrayed as carrion eaters. Queen Jezebel in particular is depicted as meeting a messy end and not even getting the dignity of a proper burial because her corpse is eaten by dogs (as prophesied earlier).
-   _CatDog_: Bones are Dog's main motif (in fact, half of his house is made of a giant bone fused to a giant fish, which is Cat's motif). He even once stole the bones of a Tyrannosaurus rex from a nearby museum and when arrested, was eating the bones of dead prisoners, whose cannibalistic behavior horrified cat (although in the end it was All Just a Dream by Cat).
-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_: One episode has a magical giant bone so irresistible to dogs they licked it until they died of starvation. Courage managed to escape this fate through sheer Heroic Willpower.
-   _A Dog's Way Home_: Bella loves cheese, but not for the actual food itself. Her owner plays a game where he holds up a _tiny_ bit of cheese in front of her nose so cheese has become Bella's Comfort Food.

-   _Family Skeleton Mysteries_: Dogs and their love of bones, including Sid's, are mentioned a few times. Sid himself is terrified of dogs who feel they and Sid should have the traditional dog-bone relationship.
-   _Happy Heroes_: In Season 7, the Woofians, an alien race of Funny Animal dogs, like to eat bones.
-   In _Hitman: Blood Money_, one of the targets has a loud lap dog that can easily alert him and the only way to subdue it is to drop a sausage injected with sedatives (or poison) on the ground. The dog will immediatly eat it.
-   _Homestuck_: Bequerel, Jade's canine guardian, loves eating steak above all else. Since he's also a godlike being powered by the energy of a sun, he also happens to prefer his steaks irradiated.
-   _Krypto The Super Dog_: Bones are often a favorite food of choice for Krypto and his super canine allies.

-   _Mickey Mouse_: One episode has Pluto try to steal a large bone from a sleeping lion in the zoo because his bone was too small.
-   _Minecraft_: Dogs are tamed by feeding them bones, although, after that, they can eat any type of meat. Tamed or not, they'll also gleefully chase after skeletons without waiting for an excuse.
-   _Scooby-Doo_:
    -   In _A Night of Fright is no Delight_, it's shown that Scooby-Doo is not afraid of haunted bones.
    -   _Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost_: Subverted. A restaurant owner offers to give Scooby a bone, only for Scooby to turn it down in favor of the restaurant's food.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_: One episode has the Satellite of Love being attacked by a horde of demon dogs just because it's bone-shaped.
-   _Mythbusters_: The Mythbusters attempted to recreate the trope that an Angry Guard Dog could be placated with a steak. It wasn't quite as successful as is often shown in fiction: Kari was able to walk in an enclosure, open a safe, take what was inside, and probably would have made it out if Tory didn't throw the steak inside (or if Tory had had another steak ready when the dog came back to him), but the team also advised against viewers repeating the stunt as dogs can be trained to ignore this sort of thing.
-   _One Piece_: The Straw Hats end up in a remote country populated by humanoid mammals called Minks. Dog Minks take a special liking to Brook (a living skeleton), for the expected reason, although Brook is much less happy to be constantly hounded by canine people eager to get a taste of him.
-   _Queen Zixi of Ix_: Subverted. When Ruffles the dog gains the power of speech, he complains that he doesn't like bones, and can't understand why humans keep giving their dogs bones instead of _meat_.
-   _RWBY Chibi_: In one skit, Yang and her father Taiyang debate over how to get Zwei to take his medicine. Zwei becomes very enthusiastic when Tai suggests covering it with peanut butter, and is visibly disappointed when Yang shoots down that idea in favor of having Ruby snipe the pill directly into his mouth.
-   _Son of the Mask_ had the cartoon baby trick the mask-wearing dog with an exploding bone, Looney Tunes style.
-   In _The Sooty Show_, Sweep loves bones to the point where he can't understand why everyone else doesn't like them as much as he does. For example in one of the spin-off books he genuinely thinks an ideal birthday present for someone else would be an oil painting of a bone. Sweep also loved sausages just as much, with other characters often referring to him as "sausage brain".
-   _Tailchasers Songs_: The "Just So" Story for why dogs and cats don't get along involves a dog city with a monument made of bones. A sly cat knocked down the monument. Dogs will never let the cat species live that moment down.
-   _Tintin_: Tintin's dog Snowy, as well as sharing Captain Haddock's love of Loch Lomond Whisky, is a little too fond of bones. He not only steals a femur from a dinosaur skeleton in a museum, he can be distracted by a bone in the middle of a life or death mission for his master.
-   _Tom and Jerry_: Spike the bulldog loves bones so much that he's almost always shown sleeping with a bone resting under his paw.
-   _Undertale_: The Annoying Dog likes to steal bones from Papyrus the skeleton (not from Papyrus himself, but rather his bone collection, Undyne's collection of bones he gave her, and even his bone-related special attack), much to his chagrin.
-   _Wallace & Gromit_:
    -   Gromit's bedroom is wallpapered with a Stock Femur Bone pattern. In _The Wrong Trousers_, when the new tenant takes a shine to his room and he's stuck moving into the shabby spare room, he and Wallace start fixing it up by applying that same wallpaper to it.
    -   One of the comics has Gromit briefly bedridden after appearing to come down with rabies (actually soapsuds in his drink), with Wallace serving him his favorite meal: bones on toast.
-   _Yo-kai Watch_: Manjimutt is a dog Yo-kai whose fondness for bones proved to be an obstacle when trying to escape prison. When he tries to dig his way out in episode 12, he follows the bones and he somehow ends up back in his cell.

    Dolphins 

Fish. This is, of course, Truth in Television; fish is the main food for dolphins as well as mollusks and crustaceans.

Orcas (yes, orcas are a type of dolphin) have their own folder.

___

-   _Minecraft_: Dolphins drop cod when they die, and can be made friendlier by feeding them fish.
-   In the _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ franchise, dolphins' final message message to human-kind before leaving Earth, misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the "Star Spangled Banner," was "So long and thanks for all the fish." This was turned in a complete song number for the film adaptation.

    Dromaeosaurs/"Raptors" (_Velociraptor_, _Deinonychus_, etc.) 

Most works of fiction (and documentaries) tend to depict dromaeosaurs hunting down animals much larger than themselves. While they certainly were capable of taking down large animals, it wasn't nearly as common in Real Life. It's now believed that "raptors" prefered to hunt down smaller to medium-sized prey while only taking down larger prey during opportune moments (IE: very old, sick, or injured individuals that would be easier to take down). Likewise, there was a limit to the size of prey they could take down. Expect fiction to forget this and feature _Velociraptor_ taking down a dinosaur that would've been much too big for it in reality. Let's also not forget that _Velociraptor_ was the size of a turkey at best; the person-sized species that matched the profile of the traditional raptor was _Deinonychus_. There were also a few larger (grizzly-sized) species such as _Utahraptor_, _Dakotaraptor_, or _Achillobator_.

___

-   _Deinonychus_ will almost always be depicted taking down a _Tenontosaurus_. While there is some debate over whether they could take down a full-grown _Tenontosaurus_, they were certainly capable of hunting juveniles.
-   _Velociraptor_:
    -   Many works of fiction and documentaries depict _Velociraptor_ hunting _Protoceratops_, inspired by the discovery of a fossil of a _Velociraptor_ and a _Protoceratops_ locked in combat before they were presumably being buried in a landslide.
    -   If humans are featured, expect _Velociraptor_ to immediately put them on the menu. While it probably would take more than one _Velociraptor_ to take down an adult human, the situation would likely be more of an inversion in reality since humans would be quite capable of hunting dromaeosaurs (especially _Velociraptor_, which, again, were poultry-sized) as a food source, and (given that dromaeosaurs are maniraptors and very close cousins to modern birds) probably think they taste like chicken. Larger dromaeosaurs such as _Utahraptor_, _Dakotaraptor_, and even _Deinonychus_, however, would likely be able to prey on humans.
-   _Monster Hunter_: Various Bird Wyverns, which are notable raptor-like in appearance, are shown hunting a variety of other monsters as nourishment. Most notable are the Jaggi, which attack anything around them; given their propensity for fighting monsters larger and more powerful than they are (like the Lagiacrus in _Tri_ and _3 Ultimate_), it's a miracle their entire species hasn't been exterminated.

    Ducks/Pigeons/Sparrows 

Breadcrumbs, fed to them by a Homeless Pigeon Person most often. In Real Life, breadcrumbs are the equivalent of junk food to birds. Sure, it's got easily accessible carbohydrates... But that's _all_ it's got. City-living tropers are advised to find better ways of getting rid of excess bread, because it's unhealthy to the birds and their environment in the long run. If you're looking for something to feed the ducks in the park with, try grapes, rolled oats, peas, or frozen corn. Or for that matter, just don't — wildlife officials generally urge not to feed at all, as it causes the wildlife to lose its healthy fear of humans, turning them into pest animals. Ducks in media will also eat fish, which they rarely eat in real life. Real ducks mainly feed on plants and invertebrates.

___

-   _Breadwinners_: The title characters are ducks whose job is to deliver bread to all the other ducks on their planet.
-   In _Princess Tutu_, Duck's favorite food (both in human and duck forms) is any kind of bread.
-   In _Sarah & Duck_, bread is the Trademark Favorite Food of the latter titular character.
-   _The Summer of the Swans_: One scene shows Sara taking her mute brother Charlie out to the pond to feed bits of rolls to the swans.
-   _Viva Piñata_: In order to make the Quackberry a resident of your garden, you'll need to feed it bread.

    Eagles and Hawks 

Fish, birds, rabbits, rodents, house pets, and sufficiently small children. In the case of harpy eagles, monkeys and sloths. Bald eagles are almost always depicted as fish-eaters; while fish do seem to be their preferred prey in Real Life, they also often go after waterfowl or carrion.

___

-   In the _Between the Lions_ episode "Something Fishy", Cliffhanger disguises himself as a big fish so an eagle can get him off the cliff. Leona later dresses up as one so she can be carried by the eagle.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   The eagle-like Pidgeot is stated in the Pokédex to prey on the fish-like Magikarp. A random event in the mobile spinoff game _Pokémon: Magikarp Jump_ will actually show a Pidgeotto (the pre-evolved form of Pidgeot) snatching up your Magikarp if it jumps at the wrong time.
    -   The Pokédex entry for Rufflet (a bald eaglet) in _Pokemon Ultra Sun_ mentions that its claws are strong enough to break the shells of Shellder (a clam) and allow it to eat their insides.
-   _The Secret Life of Pets_: Tiberius the hawk attempts to snatch up several of the housepet characters a few times, though this often leaves him embarrassed that his instincts are showing. An Imagine Spot on his part also has him dive-bombing a hapless squirrel.
-   _Warrior Cats_: Hawks and eagles are some of the few predators even adult cats have.
-   There's a viral video hoax that allegedly shows a golden eagle attempting to carry off a baby, though it (thankfully) isn't successful.

    Elephants 

Peanuts and buns (UK). The peanut concept is a result of gullible circus audiences being persuaded to buy overpriced peanuts to eat for themselves or to feed to the animals. After the show, the elephants go back to their pens and eat hay. In real life, elephants can only digest about 40% of what they eat, so in one day they need approximately 400 to 600 pounds of food. Needless to say, if they go for peanuts exclusively, they're dead. The real "nut" that elephants are crazy about is _coco_nuts, which they love so much they'll eat it with its shell. They also eat coconut palm tree leaves on a regular basis. Elephants also have a love for chocolate more than peanuts and also a hankering for sugarcane, even robbing sugar cane trucks in Thailand. Elephants apparently also love watermelon; an Animal Planet show shows them eating it enthusiastically. Probably justified, since it's sweet (which often means a high-energy food) and extremely juicy (it's not called a _water_melon for nothing). They also like bananas. Buns are partially Truth in Television; elephants in captivity do enjoy eating bread, and the buns would also have been sugary, and partially British zoos' equivalent of the peanuts (in the days before there were signs saying "Do not feed the animals" — the erratic behaviour that led to London Zoo selling Jumbo is now believed to be due to tooth problems caused by this diet).

___

-   _Babar_:
    -   One episode shows that the elephants of Celesteville have a peanut patch for making peanut butter.
    -   In The Movie, during the introductory Victory Parade sequence, Babar's kids throw peanuts as treats for the townsfolk.
-   _The Beano_:
    -   The Bash Street Kids are told that elephants have a good diet. Fatty is pleased with learning this as he thinks an elephant's favourite food is buns, so takes it to mean he can eat lots of buns.
    -   In the comic itself, one issue sees Minnie the Minx saying elephants are her favorite animal and decide she wants one as a pet. She can't get a real one, so she gets Fatty Fudge as a substitute by dressing him up as an elephant and feeding him buns in a Motivation on a Stick way.
-   In _Benjamin Blümchen_, the Trademark Favorite Food of the title pachyderm is sugar cubes.
-   _Cats Don't Dance_: Woolie the Elephant makes peanut tea for Danny when they first meet, and rambles on random factoids about peanuts.
-   _CB Bears_: In his segments, Undercover Elephant's love of peanuts caused him to blow his cover.
-   Disney:
    -   Classic Disney Shorts: "Working for Peanuts" has Chip 'n Dale trying to steal peanuts from an elephant at the zoo while trying to avoid the wrath of zookeeper Donald Duck. A similar peanut-loving elephant appears in the Goofy short _The Big Wash_.
    -   _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_: "An Elephant Never Suspects" has the rangers accused of peanut thievery by most of the animals at the zoo, including a group of elephants. The peanuts were actually being used by a pair of panda siblings in a machine made entirely out of bamboo, with the peanuts made into peanut butter as fuel for the machine.
    -   _Dumbo_: Timothy wins the trust of the titular character by offering him a peanut.
    -   _Tarzan_: Peanuts seem to be the Trademark Favorite Food of Tantor the elephant. In fact, he claims that the titular character might be a subspecies of elephant because he loves peanuts as well.
-   _Donkey Hodie_: In "A Big Favor For Grampy", Duck Duck suggests that peanuts will help Gregory, Grampy's pet elephant, walk. Donkey Hodie tries to use a giant peanut to help Gregory walk, but it fails. Earlier in the episode, we see a pet dish with peanuts that is decorated with an image of a peanut, and this same dish also appears towards the end of the episode.
-   _The Heroes of Olympus_: Subverted in _The Son of Neptune_. A passing mention is made of Frank accidentally giving Hannibal the elephant indigestion by feeding him peanuts.
-   _Horton Hears a Who!_: The film adaptation has a scene where the titular elephant says that his breath smells like peanuts, and then complains about peanut bits getting stuck in his teeth.
-   _Krypto the Superdog_: One episode has Streaky assisting the Dog Star Patrol in their mission to catch the thief responsible for stealing the world's supply of peanuts. The perpetrators turned out to be a group of space elephants that were stealing all of the peanuts, because as we all know, elephants love peanuts.
-   _Little Einsteins_: The episode "Little Elephant's Big Parade" involves Leo, Annie, June, and Quincy helping an elephant grow taller for the parade by feeding her magic peanuts.
-   _Madeline_: In "Madeline's Birthday at the Zoo", Madeline and Pepito lure the escaped elephant back to its cage with hot roasted peanuts.
-   _Magic Adventures of Mumfie_: In one story, Mumfie gives the other Fox Cubhouse characters peanuts to give to Rimba. This example is odd, seeing as this trope is averted by the actual show itself, where Mumfie's favorite foods are sweets, mashed banana pancakes, sandwiches and mashed potatoes.
-   _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_: In "Chuckles Bites the Dust", the kids' show host Chuckles the Clown dresses as one of his characters, Peter Peanut, as Grand Marshal of a local parade. Unfortunately he's marching in front of a group of circus elephants, which according to the observers, "shells" him to death.
-   _Mr. Bogus_: In the second act of "Hipster Tripster", Bogus finds himself facing against an elephant at the zoo when trying to acquire some of the elephant's peanut cache.
-   A couple of Pay Day candy bar ads involved an elephant going after a hapless man's Pay Day bar, because it had peanuts in it.
-   _The Penguins of Madagascar_: The elephant goes crazy from hunger after the zoo lost power and tried to eat lemur Julian because he looked like a peanut.
-   _The Simpsons_: Lampshaded in "Bart Gets an Elephant", where Bart gets a pet elephant and names it Stampy. To solve the food problem, Homer follows this trope by giving Stampy a whole bag of peanuts to eat, which causes it to become sick and weak. Lisa then says that "he can't just eat peanuts, dad, he needs plants to live." Learning from his mistake, Homer has Stampy strip all the leaves from a nearby park.
-   _Too Many Buns For Rosie_, by Eva Haddon, lampshaded this. It was about an elephant who loved buns, but ate too many of them which made her unhealthy until she switched to eating fruit and vegetables.
-   In _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, a film producer who has been working on a film starring the cartoon elephant Dumbo remarks that the best part about it is that the star is literally paid peanuts.
-   Some of the recent advertisements for Wonderful Pistachios feature a talking elephant named Ernie (voiced by John Cena) shilling their trademark product, who states that he's doing so because he's tired of peanuts.
-   _Zoo Tycoon_: Peanut dispensers are among the enrichment items available for elephants in _Zoo Tycoon 2_. If given an easel as another form of enrichment, elephants will occasionally paint a picture of a peanut.

    Fish 

Worms, usually hanging in a fishing hook; Cartoon Cheese is an uncommon but not unheard of bait alternative. Aquarium pet fish get those flakes that come in shakers. Always a Bigger Fish is also popularly depicted with fish (hence the name), with smaller ones getting eaten by bigger ones and so on. Of course, real fish are, again, a clade so varied that there's a species for any aquatic diet you can think of.

Sharks and piranhas have their own sections.

___

-   _MAD_: Parodied in a comic featuring Ariel from _The Little Mermaid_ grossing out an amorous sailor by chowing down on a can of live worms.
-   _Finding Nemo_: The DK Essential Guide mentions that Bubbles the yellow tang's favorite food is dried mealworms, a common aquarium staple.
-   The YouTube series _The Shark Puppet_ stars a shark whose Trademark Favorite Food is cheese, probably referencing the "cheese as bait" trend associated with fish.
-   _Spongebob Squarepants_: Fish are typically shown eating human food and leading human lives, but the episode _Hooky_ has one of the fishermen use cheese as bait on a fishing hook.

    Flies 

Anything rotten or smelly will usually have a bunch of flies circling around it (including poop and very dirty or dead animals), with some disgusting maggots being present as well in extreme cases. They're also shown to be attracted to anything sugary, such as honey, sugar cubes, or fruit. Also, soup (which is apparently so good that they can't help but literally dive in). Real flies are, usually, generalist omnivores with very varied diets. They do indeed frequently eat gross stuff and are important decomposers, but their diet is by no means limited to this. There are even bloodsucking flies (though the experience isn't quite the same as getting bitten by a mosquito).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Foxes 

Chicken or rabbits. Real Life Foxes are omnivorous scavengers; as such they'll take any food they can get but they especially love chicken. There's a reason "Fox in the henhouse" is an old saying. Real foxes seem to like rabbits; _Time_ magazine, citing the Virgina Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, claimed that 44% of the red fox's diet is rabbits. In Japanese works, Kitsune are said to love fried tofu.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Part of the reason that Foxes and Chicken became so deeply ingrained in pop culture ties into the fact that Foxes are smart enough to learn that chickens are caged and can't migrate after one of them gets nabbed, so if they have one successful hunt they know they can come back and the chickens will still be there ready to be picked off. This combined with enough determination to chew through wire and wood, dig into the floor, or just full-on open the doors have made foxes a perennial headache for chicken owners since the birth of animal husbandry.

___

-   The standard Fox-Chicken-Grain Puzzle (i.e. if the fox is left alone with the chicken, or whatever prey animal is present in the puzzle, it will eat it).
-   _Fantastic Mr. Fox_: Chickens are among the prey Mr. Fox steals for his family.
-   _Felicia, Sorceress of Katara_ is a vixen sorceress and has a thing for chicken.
-   _The Foxbusters_: The title characters are chickens who defend their flock against a family of foxes.
-   _The Game of the Gods_ references this when one character threatens to use a Forced Transformation. "I will turn you into a rabbit and put you among foxes."
-   _Happy Harmonies_: "The Hound and The Rabbit" features a villainous fox that tries to devour the rabbits a hound has recently befriended.
-   _Looney Tunes_:
    -   _A Fox in a Fix_ revolves around a fox disguising himself as a guard dog so that he can eat all the chickens he wants.
    -   _Fox Terror_ has a fox constantly tricking Foghorn Leghorn into leaving the farm (and taking the Barnyard Dawg with him) to get at the chickens.
    -   _Rabbit Stew and Rabbits, Too!_ is all about a vulpine Expy of Wile E. Coyote trying to hunt down a rabbit, who in turn is an Expy of the Road Runner.
-   In _Minecraft_, foxes will try to hunt and kill rabbits and chickens on sight.
-   _Rabbit's PhD thesis_ inverts this. The thesis claims that _rabbits_ eat foxes, so the rabbit lures a fox into her rabbit-hole to see the thesis and the fox disappeared. The rabbit's thesis advisor is a lion who eats foxes.
-   _Shaun the Sheep_: A fox trying to steal chickens and other animals like Timmy the lamb is a recurring villain.
-   _The Tale of Peter Rabbit_: A fox threatened the rabbits in _The Tale of Mr Tod_, while in _The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck_, the main villain is a fox who wants to eat the titular duck. Mr Tod is a recurring villain in the Animated Adaptation _Peter Rabbit_.
-   _U.S. Acres_ features a fox constantly trying to steal the chickens.
-   _Zootopia_: When the creative team was developing the story, they knew it would involve a World of Funny Animals that focused on mammals. They wanted their protagonists to be smaller animals and "natural enemies" in the real world. A fox and rabbit was their first choice and never changed despite many significant story changes that occurred during development.

    Frogs and Toads 

Flies, which they catch with their long, sticky tongues. In Real Life, of course, they are not picky eaters and will go after pretty much any insect they can get their tongues (which are actually short in real life) on, with larger species eating vertebrates as well.

___

-   In _Battletoads_, the 'Toads restore their health by eating flies.
-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_: Among the strange phenomena plaguing Courage and his owners were a group of bullfrogs led by their king who invaded their house and tried to build a pond in their living room. They force the Bagges to act like frogs, including catching flies with their tongue, and use Courage as a fly catcher by covering him in honey. Courage rids the house of the frogs by catching flies with fly paper, stapling the fly-covered paper on the walls above where the frogs were preparing to feast on Eustace and Muriel, catching their attention where they all get their tongues stuck together on the sticky fly-paper trying to get the flies, and then grabbing all their tongues and flinging them off into the far distance.
-   Disney:
    -   _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_: One episode has a frog force a tribe of beetles to find him a fly because he's tired of eating beetles, and naturally they capture the fly member of the Rescue Rangers, Zipper.
    -   Disney Channel: In one game available on the _The Emperor's New School_ section of the website, "Red-Eyed Tree Frog Man", frog!Kuzco can eat flies with the player's aid to gain extra time.
    -   _The Princess and the Frog_: After being turned into frogs by a magic spell, Tiana and Prince Naveen fall prey to their animal instincts and try to eat the Plucky Comic Relief firefly, Ray. Tiana was even embarrassed that her instincts are showing.
-   In _Flushed Away_, one way to distract the Toad and Le Frog is to show them a fly, at which point they'll try like mad to get at it with their ridiculously long tongues, occasionally engaging in fencing matches with one another.
-   _The Muppets_: Kermit the Frog has been quoted as saying that time's fun when you're having flies.
-   _Rocko's Modern Life_: Mr. and Mrs. Bighead (and any other toad) tend to catch any fly that flies around their vicinity with their tongues. Mr. Bighead also enjoyed it. Like real toads, Mr. Bighead also enjoyed eating other insects, including the ones that tried to eat his precious garden, and even kept a bug jail for future consumption (before Rocko saved them).
-   In _The Tale of Mr Jeremy Fisher_, while Jeremy plans to catch minnows to eat, he takes butterfly sandwiches on his fishing trip. In the end, after he fails to catch any minnows, he and his friends have a roasted grasshopper with ladybug sauce for dinner instead.
-   Froggy and his family (from the book series of the same name) are _Funny Animals_ who act and live like humans, but still eat flies at every meal.
-   _Kaeloo_: The titular character, a frog, eats flies. The other characters are disgusted by this.

    Goats 

Tin cans or other junk and metal. Paper, too. In case you were wondering, this started from people misinterpreting goats trying to eat the labels (and glue) off cans. Now you know, And Knowing Is Half the Battle. Goats' genuine taste for paper sometimes turns up in variants of the homework-eating-dog scenario. Now and then this is also applied to sheep, implying that sheep and goats are being used interchangeably (see also mice, rats and cheese).

___

-   _Daffy Duck_: One Wartime Cartoon, "Scrap Happy Daffy", has Nazis sending a goat to eat piles of scrap metal that Daffy was guarding for the war effort.
-   Disney:
    -   In _Beauty and the Beast_, when Belle shows off her book to a group of sheep, one of them partakes of a bite of one the pages.
    -   In _The Hunchback of Notre Dame,_ Djali the goat is seen munching on Quasimodo's wooden sheep figurines when he isn't looking.
-   In _Eternal Sonata_, there's a brief quest in which there are three goats on a walkway blocking a narrow path and Allegretto, the character you control in the field, has to feed them scraps of paper in order to get them to move. Later, if you talk with a random NPC mailman, you discover that those paper scraps were letters that he was supposed to deliver to Viola, who just joined your party.
-   _The Garfield Show_:
    -   In one episode, Garfield gets turned into a goat and says that he got a craving for tin cans.
    -   Subverted and lampshaded in a later episode, where a goat becomes offended when Garfield gives it a tin can instead of food. However, Garfield only meant for it to lick the glue off the can.
-   _Kung Fu Panda 2_: A Running Gag has the goat Soothsayer repeatedly taking a bite out of Lord Shen's robes.
-   _M\*A\*S\*H_: In one episode, a goat that Klinger has purchased eats the unit's payroll. The investigating major from I-Corps doesn't believe that the money was eaten by a goat and decides that Hawkeye — who was paymaster — is responsible for the missing money and decides to have Hawkeye's wages garnished until the amount is paid back in full. Hawkeye, Klinger and Potter conspire to get the major out of the VIP tent, then turn the goat loose in the VIP tent where it eats an important report that the major had been working on for his superior officer. They then make a deal with him — if the major will confirm that a goat ate their payroll and absolve Hawkeye of the blame, then they'll verify that the same goat ate his report.
-   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ Grover, the half-goat satyr would like to eat tin cans, apples, and such.
-   _Popeye_: One cartoon randomly featured a Funny Animal goat who eats steel, and eventually eats an entire navy ship.
-   _Shaun the Sheep_: The goat eats anything he can find in the garbage dump that he's often found at.
-   _The Simpsons_: Lampshaded in "Lisa the Vegetarian". The family visits an amusement park that has a petting zoo, and Homer tries to get a goat to eat a tin can, but the goat isn't interested. Marge tells Homer that they're supposed to feed them from the animal feed stored in a machine.
-   _Steamboat Willie_ again — a goat being transported on the boat eats Minnie's ukulele and sheet music. (So what do they do? Bend its tail at right angles and use it as a hand-cranked phonograph!)
-   _U.S. Acres_: In "Temp Trouble", Aloysius Pig's pet goat licks the glue off a tin can, and Aloysius gives him 10 demerits.

    Hamsters 

Seem to enjoy sunflower seeds a little too much. As usual, this is an exaggeration—real-life hamsters should be fed a larger diversity of seeds.

___

-   All of the hamsters in _Hamtaro_ adore eating sunflower seeds, to the point where they're used as currency in the games. Both the original and the English theme song mention the hamsters' love of sunflower seeds.
-   Hibiki's pet hamster Hamuzou in _The Idolmaster_ loves sunflower seeds (as well as peanuts), and often gets into mischief if Hibiki eats his seeds.

    Horses 

Sugar (usually sugar cubes), carrots, apples or hay. Real horses will eat all of these things, but hay and/or grass makes up the bulk of their diet, supplemented with grain; the rest, especially the sugar lumps, are treats that should be given sparingly.

___

-   Disney:
    -   _Sleeping Beauty_: Prince Phillip bribes his horse with the promise of "an extra bucket of oats. And a few... carrots?", only to irritably retract the carrots after the horse inadvertently clotheslines him on a tree branch. Sharp-eared viewers will note that an extra "bucket" of oats (holding 1-2 gallons for your average hand-carried "bucket") can weigh ten or twenty pounds of grain, which horses do eat... after insane exertion of Epic Race levels. Such horses would be: 1) racehorses who sprint for several miles, 2) war-horses after a battle, or 3) endurance horses who can truck along for a whole day of eight to ten hours. Given that they _do_ end up fighting Maleficent at the climax, this was most likely a case of Accidentally-Correct Writing.
    -   _Tangled_: Apples are the Trademark Favorite Food of Maximus the cavalry horse. When Rapunzel brings both Maximus and Flynn Rider to the kingdom where she was born, expecting them to get along, one of the ways Flynn tries to prove that he's turned away from thievery is by offering the horse a bag of apples.
        
        **Flynn:** What? I bought them.  
        _Maximus ponders this for a moment, then happily starts eating an apple_  
        **Flynn:** _Most_ of them.  
        _Maximus pauses, then gives a nicker of concern_
        
-   _Doug_: One episode has the eponymous protagonist, after buying his own tall tales about his horse-riding prowess, forced to ride a vicious and nigh-unrideable horse named Sugar. He was only able to temporarily appease it by offering it sugar cubes.
-   _Fanfic Is Crapsack_: Thanks to bad fanfic shenanigans, Rarity is under the impression that she can't get enough to eat (despite two of her friends being a baker and a farmer, respectively.) Twilight is not amused when she hears about this, lampshading this trope.
    
    "You've got to be kidding me! You're a HORSE! You eat GRASS! You eat HAY! You could just walk out in the nearest open field and eaten your fill!"  
    Rarity gaped at her. "Eating grass like a..."  
    "Pony?" Twilight deadpanned. "I repeat—- college student. I know about being short on food. Plenty of times when it was a choice between grazing in the courtyard and eating Ramen noodles. Trust me, pick the grass."
    
-   _The Garfield Show_: Subverted in an episode where Garfield tries to feed a horse a bale of hay only for the equine to react in disgust and complain that hay is dry and tasteless.
-   _Gulliver's Travels_: The intelligent Houyhnhnms try to feed Gulliver hay to see whether or not he's one of them or a barbaric Yahoo. When he turns it down they bring him raw meat (which Yahoos eat), but he turns this down as well.
-   In the _HouseBroken_ episode "Who's A Party Pony?" sugar cubes are treated like cocaine for the eponymous pony (and Honey joins him in getting high on them)
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ and _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_, the amount of times Link can make his horse Epona boost her speed is measured in carrots.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: Horses can be fed either apples or carrots to restore their health and make them friendlier to Link. Endura Carrots in particular will give them three additional, temporary spurs of running speed, and can also be traded to the horse god Malanya — who claims them to be a delicacy he has only eaten once before — in exchange for his resurrecting deceased horses.
-   _Madeline_: At the end of _Madeline and the Easter Bonnet_, the new Easter bonnet the girls make for Bonbon the milk-wagon horse has real carrots hanging all around the rim, which Bonbon can snack on as she walks along.
-   _Miitopia_: In the Nintendo Switch re-release, the player is able to recruit a horse to their team that the Miis will commonly give apples and carrots to.
-   _Minecraft_: Horses can eat a large variety of foods both to recover lost health and to enter love mode (a status where an animal fed a certain food will become capable of breeding), more than any other animal save for wolves and dogs (which can eat any type of meat). All the foods they can eat fall within this trope: sugar, wheat sheaves and apples will restore a small amount of a horse's health, while golden carrots, golden apples and hay bales will restore larger amounts of health and make the horse enter breeding mode.
-   _Mister Ed_: Mister Ed greatly enjoys all stereotypical horse foods, and he says so often.
-   _Monster Musume_: Carrots are Centorea the centaur's Trademark Favorite Food.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Pony foods are typically based on hay, flowers, carrots and similar things. They also greatly enjoy apples, which are generally the only thing that Applejack's farm is shown growing — although some later-season episodes show it having carrot fields as well.
    -   When prepared foods show up, they're typically horsey versions of real-life foodstuffs, such as "hayburgers", "carrot dogs"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and flower sandwiches. One episode features a food stall serving oat burgers, which are basically hamburgers except with mashed oats instead of meat.
    -   One of the lines in Pinkie's song meant to soothe tensions between ponies and buffalo by pointing out their similarities mentions them both eating hay and oats, and everyone enjoys Applejack's... well, apples.
    -   Ponies also seem to have a huge Sweet Tooth for things like cake and candies, which is probably an extension of the "horses like sugar cubes" concept, given that the local sweet shop/bakery is called Sugarcube Corner. (Real Life horses _will_ quite happily eat all manner of sweet foods, from fruit — including but not by any means limited to apples — to baked goods to hard candies and the classic sugar lumps).
    -   Rainbow Dash loves broccoli and pigs out on them at a buffet. This is another food that horses should only be given as a special treat; too much can cause colic.
-   _NetHack_: Knights start the game with apples and carrots to feed their pet pony. Horses in this game can also eat other vegetarian food, such as lichen corpses.
-   _Phoebe and Her Unicorn_: Marigold the Unicorn likes to eat anything horses eat, like hay and apples.
-   _Pokémon Sword and Shield_: The Royal Horse Pokémon Glastrier and Spectrier are known to drop everything they're doing if they catch the scent of their favorite carrots. In _The Crown Tundra_, part of Calyrex's storyline involves growing the carrots in question as bait for them; they were once Calyrex's mount, and he would love to have them back.

    Hyenas 

Dead things, especially a lion's leftovers (despite the fact that lions scavenge off of _hyena_ kills more often). This is a common misconception when it comes to spotted hyenas, which actually prefer to hunt prey than search for carcasses, though they have digestive systems that are still well adapted to scavenging, so they're more likely to eat decaying carcasses than other predators (which has made them very successful). Striped hyenas and brown hyenas, on the other hand, are indeed primarily scavengers. In some works, hyenas can be seen eating bones, which is accurate in real-life. Though real-life hyenas are Extreme Omnivores that also eat fruits and inanimate objects, fictional hyenas are rarely portrayed this way. Aardwolves, the fourth living species of hyena, are insectivores. They do not even eat from corpses or look for red meat, contrary to some sources.

___

-   _Carry On_: The hyena protagonist's dad is a mortician who frequently puts his work on the dinner table.
-   _The Lion King_:
    -   _The Lion King (1994)_: The hyenas are shown living in a bone-littered Elephant Graveyard and gleefully tearing into a piece of carrion that Scar brings them. But they also avert the stereotype by actively hunting in important scenes, as they try to eat the lion cubs alive, cause the stampede of wildebeests in which Mufasa dies, and eventually take down Scar.
    -   In _The Lion King 1 1/2_, hyenas are depicted as the main predators of meerkats. Hyenas rarely go after such small prey; the main predators of meerkats are jackals and birds of prey.
    -   In _The Lion Guard_, Jaziri recognizes hyenas being nature’s clean up crew, though Janja, Chungu and Cheezi are always trying to hunt in the Pride Lands. Aardwolves show up too. Kion mistakes them for the regular type of hyena and uses the Roar on them, which causes the termite population to explode and drive everyone except the zebras nuts. Kion had to go apologize to the aardwolves and ask them to come back.
-   _Pearls Before Swine_: Zebra's hyena neighbors run a funeral home just so they can eat the dead corpses. They also frequently ask Zebra if they can have a dead relative of his or stalk him in case if he dies.

    Koalas 

Gum (eucalyptus) leaves. Truth in Television, as koalas can only ingest gum leaves, and that's only particular kinds of gum leaves.

___

-   This is a major plot device in an episode of _Ace Ventura: The Animated Series_ in which eucalyptus cough drops are used to pacify a group of angry koalas.
-   _Spellsinger_: In _The Paths of the Perambulator_, Colin the Koala has a supply of dried eucalyptus cubes to keep him going away from his native habitat (and when that runs out, is forced to eat whatever greenery he can find, which upsets his stomach). When the characters get trapped in a Lotus-Eater Machine, his fantasy is a huge forest of gum trees. When they return to reality, but still have psychosomatic effects of the dreamworld, he's slightly out of it from the narcotic.
-   _We Bare Bears_: In "Nom Nom", the titular koala was shown drowning his sorrows with a eucalyptus-flavored drink. Another episode "Kyle" showed he has a eucalyptus tree in his mansion.

    Mice (and sometimes rats) 

Cheese, even though in real life most don't like it. Ironically, the mouse's mortal enemy, the cat, adores it. Rats, which are more prone to eating animal protein than mice are, enjoy cheese more than their smaller cousins do. Peanut butter, which mice DO love, would be a better choice. In Real Life, a lot of vermin mouse and rat poisons are made to have the smell and taste of chocolate, as the little rodents are actually quite fond of anything sweet. This particular Stock Animal Diet concept probably arose because, while hungry mice will nibble on _any_ food that's left out in a pre-refrigerator-era pantry, cheese was the only thing that actually showed clear tooth impressions to _prove_ they'd been doing so.

___

-   In _Adventures in Wonderland_, the Dormouse loves cheese... even though dormice aren't really mice.
-   In _An American Tail_, immigrant mice come to America believing the streets are paved with cheese.
-   Anatole, a French mouse in a series of picture books by Eve Titus, gets a job as a taster in a (human) cheese factory, leaving notes with suggestions for improvement.
-   _Angelina Ballerina_:
    -   In the original books, Angelina's favorite food is her mother's cheddar cheese pies, and most of the foods mentioned are cheese based such as cheese crumpets and cheddarburgers.
    -   In _The Next Steps_ series, Angelina and her friends have a fondness for cheese. In the "Dancing in the Moonlight" song, they sing about having "_some Camembert to share._"
-   In _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_, the Spectre turns a Mad Scientist into cheese and releases his trained rats _to eat him._
-   _Bear in the Big Blue House_: Tutter is a connoisseur of everything cheese and enjoys trying any type of cheese he can, including gouda and feta.
-   _Beast Wars_: Rattrap loves cheese; he even has a picture of one in his Heads-Up Display. Then again, he's not really a rat...
-   _BoJack Horseman_: Mia McKibben, an anthropomorphic mouse, wears a cheese-themed pendant.
-   In _The Butterfly Ball_, Sir Maximus Mouse is a "cheese tycoon" based in the Cheddar Bank.
-   In _Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead_, the recipe for mouse mutagen (not to be confused with rat mutagen) includes cheese. You can also use candy, which is more thematically appropriate (one of the "main attractions" of mouse mutations is the ability to eat as much junk food as you want with no health penalties), but looking at the game files reveals a comment referencing this particular trope:
    
    fun fact: mice don't like cheese as much as sugar! we include it in the recipe because most people correlate the two, and as a fun poke at it
    
-   _Conker's Bad Fur Day_ has a segment where you must load a mouse/rat with cheese, in order to kill it, and get a massive, female voiced brick off a gangster-talking smaller block, so you can reach a window... into a barn...
-   _Corner Gas_: Oscar shows an extremely rare moment of knowledge by baiting mouse traps with candy, claiming cheese doesn't work. Of course, due to "mice like cheese" being so widely believed in real life, it's possible that the writers were _trying_ to portray Oscar as being Entertainingly Wrong like usual, but ended up with a case of Accidentally-Correct Writing.
-   _Critter Coven_: Florence, is an anthropomorphic rat who practices "Lunar cheese" witchcraft. Also, all the snacks she set out for the first meeting were cheese-based.
-   Referenced with _Crush Crush_, Brie is an explorer from Rodentia, wanting to sample the solar-system's cheeses.
-   Chapter 2 of _Deltarune_ has the enemy Maus (plural Maice), living computer mice who love cheese. The very first Maus the player is likely to fight in combat appears when they try to touch its cheese, and the Swatchlings dealing with a Maice infestation in the mansion kitchen lament that they haven't finished throwing out all the cheese beforehand.
-   Disney:
    -   _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_: Monterey Jack has a psychotic reaction to just the _smell_ of cheese, or even hearing anyone say the word. There's even an episode where his cheese addiction is treated like a G-Rated Drug and his friends have to confront him about it.
    -   _Mickey Mouse_ deliberately averts this. In every cartoon, Mickey is rarely seen eating any cheese at all. This is due to Disney's rule that Mickey is to never, ever be shown with cheese, as it makes him seem like a mouse and he's more of a human that just happens to look like a giant mouse. This seems to have been a later rule for Mickey. Early comics (1930s) show Mickey and Minnie eagerly eating cheese, and from the mid-1990s onward new Mickey cartoons often reference cheese. In one _House of Mouse_ episode, Mickey spent the rent money on cheese. Specifically, a huge wheel of it that he swallowed in one bite. Also, at the "Mickey's House" attraction in Disney World, Mickey's refrigerator (at least at one time) sported a copy of his shopping list — which consisted entirely of different types of cheese.
-   In _Dragon Quest VIII_, the hero's pet mouse, Munchie who actually turns out to be the hero's grandfather, Chen-Mui, in disguise to help him out can be fed various types of cheese to perform special attacks in-battle.
-   _Geronimo Stilton_: Most of the mouse characters have names and surnames that reference types of cheese. The mice in the books and the cartoon really love cheese, to the point where the theft of all the cheese in New Mouse City is treated like a famine, and their entire island is shaped like a gigantic slice of Swiss cheese.
-   _hololive_: The favorite food of the rat-based chaos deity, Hakos Baelz, is fried cheese, and the loading animation for her stream also features a pixel-art version of her jumping over cheese blocks.
-   _House of Tribes_: Cheese is revered by mice as the Food of the Gods.
-   _Housepets!_: Zig-zagged. In Spo's first appearance, Fido gets him some oats, because mice actually like oats, and Spo comments he can't stand cheese. The Alt Text of the very same strip, however, has him claiming "Mom fed us cheese like ALL THE TIME".
-   _Imagination Movers_:
    -   Warehouse Mouse loves cheese.
    -   In "Shall We Dance?", the Movers get some bananas from one of their rooms and are seen running out of the room, accompanied by the sounds of chattering angry monkeys.
-   In Kevin Henkes' picture books, all of his characters are anthropomorphic mice who are often shown eating cheese in some form.
    -   _Chrysanthemum_: Chrysanthemum's favorite dinner is macaroni and cheese with ketchup. Her parents make it to cheer her up after a bad first day of school where everyone laughs at her long name.
    -   _Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse_: Mr. Slinger's students love his cheesy snacks. One of the illustrations also shows him giving a lesson about different types of cheese.
    -   _Wemberly Worried_: Two young mice dress up as blocks of Cartoon Cheese in the Halloween parade.

-   _Looney Tunes_:

    -   Played with in _Kitty Kornered_. Porky Pig puts a bunch of housecats (led by Sylvester) out for the night.

    Mongooses 

Snakes. Mongooses are willing to eat anything they can catch, snakes being one of them, but they (and their close relatives the meerkats) will go after them even if not hungry — not due to any particular animosity, mind you, but because snakes eat their babies if given the opportunity.

___

-   _Austin Powers_: Dr. Evil mentions this when describing his relationship with Austin.
    
    He's the snake to my mongoose, or the mongoose to my snake... either way it's bad.
    
-   _Gravedale High_: One episode has the Gorgeous Gorgon student Durze having her rented dress destroyed because a mongoose that someone took to school scare her head's snakes making them "run" away.
-   _Rikki Tikki Tavi_: Rikki is a voracious snake hunter and even assures Chuchundra that mongooses don't eat rats, even though that's their most common prey in real life.

    Monkeys and Apes 

Bananas. Rather funny, as the Real Life _wild_ bananas are smaller, green and far less tasty compared to the cultivated golden banana the humans are familiar with. Captive primates do go ape for bananas, though bananas cultivated for humans are too sugary for some species and it's basically like giving them candy, and should not be a staple (and anyway, they love grapes even more); at least one zoo actually had to stop giving bananas to their monkeys because they had too much sugar, causing their teeth to rot. Sometimes primates are shown just liking fruit in general, which is Truth in Television for most primates, though many of them are omnivores (such as us). Concerning the great apes, gorillas mostly eat either roughage or fruit depending on the species (fruits aren't widely available in most gorilla habitats); in fact, when given bananas, they usually prefer to eat the pith (the white stringy stuff in the peel) instead of the flesh. Meanwhile, chimpanzees are mostly herbivores but well known for fishing for termites and hunting small animals like monkeys, antelope and infants of rival troops, while orangutans are the biggest frugivores of the apes (and only great apes in the native range of bananas), preferring the much-dreaded durian, a giant spiky fruit said to smell like gym socks (they have been observed eating the meat of small mammals like squirrels and lorises, but they don't actively hunt like chimpanzees do and researchers believe they're primarily opportunistic scavengers, i.e. the animals they eat are already dead). Primates may also be seen eating nuts.

___

-   _Animorphs_: While in gorilla morph Marco is sometimes seen mounging on bananas, though he's probably invoking the trope for fun, and he placated the original DNA donor of that morph with an apple instead of a banana.
-   Ben & Jerry's markets a banana-walnut ice cream under the name Chunky Monkey.
-   _Brandy & Mr. Whiskers_: Parodied when Brandy tries to use a banana to bribe villain gecko Gaspar's giant monkey mooks, who takes offense to the stereotype (though they later express enthusiasm in finding bananas for themselves after Brandy leaves).
-   _Brawl in the Family_ parodies Donkey Kong's taste for bananas. The other Kongs eat the hoard, but Donkey and Diddy blame a nearby pair of Kremlings. Then Donkey and Diddy attack the Kremlings, and K. Rool must buy bananas at the grocery store to placate the Kongs.
-   _Curious George_: George eats bananas... and anything else he can get his hands on.
-   _Discworld_: This is the best way to get into the Librarian's good graces. Sometime between _Light Fantastic_ and _Sourcery_ he hires inept wizard Rincewind to fetch him bananas. While in _Unseen Academicals_ he eats a poisoned banana without thinking (he survives).
-   _Donkey Kong Country_: Donkey Kong enjoys them and keeps a hoard of yellow (or golden) bananas. The Kremlings steal the hoard, and Donkey and Diddy must recover the bananas. The other Kongs presumably like to eat bananas, but we know not why the Kremlings want them.
-   _Escape from the Planet of the Apes_: In a rare live-action version, this was amusingly subverted — Zira is in a test room with a set of puzzle blocks that form a staircase. Hanging above is a banana. She completes the puzzle in about fifteen seconds, climbs the stairs, looks up at the banana and sighs. When one of the scientists wonders aloud why she won't take it, she replies testily "Because I _**abhor**_ bananas!" (This is an In-Universe Wham Line, as the scientists had no idea the apes could talk).
-   _The Far Side_ has gorillas eating bananas a few times, even waxing sentimental about them.
    
    "You know, Sid, I really like bananas... I mean, I know that's not profound or nothin'... Heck! We ALL do... But for me, I think it goes much more beyond that."
    
-   _Futurama_: Gunther, an uplifted monkey, likes bananas but prefers not to eat them since they remind him that he's only fully sapient because of Professor Farnsworth's experimental hat. He eats banana-flavored foods to get around this.

    **King Louie**: Have two bananas! _(holds up three fingers)_
    
-   _Justice League_: Subverted in an episode where the Flash offers a banana to a gorilla in a laboratory, before being scolded by a scientist. When the gorilla reveals himself to be the Mad Scientist Gorilla Grodd, he clocks Flash a good one and remarks, "That was for the banana. I _**hate**_ bananas." Grodd has the same reaction to Cisco offering him a banana in _The Flash (2014)_. However, in _Batman Ninja_, Grodd eats a banana and Catwoman jibes him about how played out it is. Grodd replies that a cat-burglar who dresses as a cat is hardly in a position to judge.
-   _King Kong (1933)_: While the original may not have mentioned bananas, the Universal Studios theme park ride blasts the audience with banana-flavored gas from animatronic Kong's mouth.
-   _Looney Tunes_: Parodied in a cartoon where a chimpanzee is shown in a room with several blocks and a banana hanging from the ceiling. The expectation of the narrator is that in this logic test, the chimp will stack the boxes on top of each other to reach the banana. Sure enough, he chimpanzee stacks the boxes, climbs up to the banana... then whips out a saw and uses it to cut the entire section of the ceiling away to bring down the _refrigerator_ that happens to be sitting right above it. Cut to the next scene of it happily enjoying turkey legs and cake, much to the surprise and confusion of the narrator.
-   _Magilla Gorilla_ always ate bananas; he'd squeeze them at the bottom and they'd pop out the top & into his mouth.
-   _Manifold: Origin_: Inverted; when the advanced hominid "Daemons" (who resemble gorillas) want to reward the human scientist Nemoto, they try offering her a banana. She is understandably insulted.
-   Hoho, Kai-Lan's monkey friend on _Ni Hao, Kai-Lan_, loves bananas.
-   _Overwatch_: Subverted by Winston; he's a gorilla and does eat bananas, but his Trademark Favorite Food is peanut butter (which he likes to dunk his bananas into).
-   _Oz the Great and Powerful_: Parodied when Oscar is trying to get Finley, a flying monkey, to go along with his lies.
    
    **Oscar**: You can have a nice pile of bananas, alright?  
    **Finley**: Bananas! Oh, I see. Because I'm a monkey, I must love bananas, right? That is a vicious stereotype.  
    **Oscar**: You don't like bananas?  
    **Finley**: Of course I love bananas! I'm a monkey, don't be ridiculous. I just don't like you saying it.

-   _The Wild Thornberrys_: Subverted. Darwin rarely eats bananas, instead preferring Cheese Munchies.

    Moles 

Earthworms, which form the majority of their diet in Real Life. They'll happily eat any other invertebrate they can catch, though, as well as nuts.

___

-   In _The Animals of Farthing Wood_, Mole is a Big Eater and earthworms are his Trademark Favourite Food. This actually saves his life, because when a fire breaks out he's busy hunting for worms underground and the fire can't reach him.
-   _The Butterfly Ball and the Grashopper Feast_: Old Blind Mole has "a bunch of juicy worms to munch" in the pocket of his coat.
-   _G-Force_: Done with Speckles the computer hacker, accompanied by a Visual Pun when he uses a computer worm as part of his hacking protocol.
    
    **Darwin:** You're a genius.  
    **Speckles:** I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms. _(slurps up a real worm)_
    

    Mosquitoes 

Blood. Truth in Television, but only for gravid (egg-making) females, which is often ignored in fiction. In all other cases, mosquitoes actually eat mostly fruit and nectar.

___

-   _A Bug's Life_: One scene has a mosquito ordering a blood drink at a bar. The mosquito is male, however.
-   One _The Far Side_ panel showed a mosquito husband complaining to his wife about his work day, saying "I must have spread malaria across half the country." According to Gary Larson, this provoked letters from readers pointing out that male mosquitoes don't bite people.
-   _Rocko's Modern Life_:
    -   A trio of male mosquitoes that call themselves "The Blood Brothers" are bandits that terrorize "the Fat Lands" on Spunky.
    -   In another episode, a female mosquito bites Filburt (who has an amphibian throat disease even though he's a reptile). She becomes infected, and falls apart before being eaten by (and infecting) Bev.

    Mythical 

-   Unicorns, pegasi and Winged Unicorns tend to either eat just like regular horses or eat mostly candy and desserts, sometimes a bit of both.
-   The Undead are usually portrayed as not needing (or in some cases, not being _able_) to eat and drink, with the exception of vampires (who, of course, drink blood, although whether or not they actually need to or can eat/drink anything else depends on the story. Some vampires who actually need to drink blood but feel bad about drinking human blood drink animal blood instead) and zombies (who eat human flesh, chiefly brains).
-   Demons may eat meat and they may also eat abstract concepts such as emotions, "spiritual energy", and people's souls, or they may not eat at all.
-   Dragons are usually portrayed as eating large animals such as cows and horses, fish, or occasionally humans. They may also be seen liking spicy food and it not bothering them because of their fire breath. In some cases, they may eat gemstones and precious metals.
-   Giants either eat humans or large versions of normal food.
-   Fairies may be portrayed as having a sweet tooth and liking candy, desserts, and/or fruit. They may also be seen eating flowers, and they may also be emotion eaters (particularly the evil ones). Those of The Fair Folk persuasion may occasionally be portrayed as carnivorous or even cannibalistic.
-   Elves often have a sweet tooth, particularly Christmas Elves, and they're often portrayed as vegetarians. Even if not vegetarian, most elves are depicted as liking plant-based food due to the association with elves and nature.
-   Leprechauns often like to drink beer.
-   Monsters will often eat all kinds of things and some of the more malevolent ones may include humans and pets.
-   Dwarves often have a fondness for red meat and tubers, the former of which you can bet will be one of the many points of disagreement between them and the typically vegetarian elves. The _other_ usual staple of their diet goes without saying.
-   Griffons are famed for their appetite for horse flesh, a detail dating back to antiquity.

    Neanderthals (and other prehistoric humans) 

Meat, preferably megafauna such as woolly mammoths, woolly rhino and Irish elk which they take down with giant clubs. In the least serious works, dinosaurs. Neanderthals were long thought to be strictly carnivorous, but like modern humans it's been shown to depend on where they lived and many who lived in warmer, forested areas were nearly vegetarian. They also enjoyed mushrooms. And despite the common belief that we didn't start eating diets high in carbs until civilization, tubers (a food source not accessible to most animals) became a staple of many human diets once fire and cooking were discovered.

___

-   _The Book of Bunny Suicides_: One of the many creative deaths shows two bunnies parading a mammoth costume in front of a group of hunting cavemen.
-   _Cave Boy Dave_ is a comic book about a cave boy who stinks at getting meat during his adulthood ritual but ends up inventing the salad bar.
-   _Primal_: Spear is shown to chiefly hunt for his food and isn't particularly picky about his targets, whether they be large, small, aquatic or terrestrial. If no other food sources are available he'll even eat insects. One episode shows him trying to gather fruit from a tree so he's at least partial to adding variety to his diet when the opportunity presents itself though he considers spiced food to be unpalatable, seen when a women from a different culture offers him a cooked tuber.

    Opossums 

Like raccoons, garbage. Opossums are natural omnivorous scavengers, though they will also hunt small rodents. It's believed that the abundance of food waste and insulation provided by humans has expanded the range of opossums far up north from their original habitat.

    Orcas 

Seals, penguins and fish (including sharks). Truth in Television in that orcas will hunt and eat any sort of marine life, although different orcas populations tend to be very specialized eaters (for instance, "Sedentary" orca pods, which mostly stick to a stable home range, chiefly eat fish and squid, while semi-nomadic "Transient" pods feed most often on other marine mammals). They're also known to eat giant whales, polar bears, and even great white sharks. It's quite common for documentaries to show orcas beaching themselves on land to hunt seals and sea lions.

___

-   _Arctic Circle_: The main penguin trio frequently have trouble with orcas that try to eat them. Poor Ed can never catch a break.
-   _Futurama_: In "The Bird-Bot of Ice-Catraz", Bender gets mauled by an orca that mistook him for a penguin due to him wearing a tuxedo. Later, that orca comes to devour the flock of penguins that menace Leela and Bender.
-   _Kenny the Shark_: One episode has the titular tiger shark being bullied by an orca, who threatened to eat him.
-   _Pearls Before Swine_: Some earlier strips involve an orca trying to trick his seal neighbors into leaving their house so that he would eat them.
-   _The Pebble and the Penguin_ has its penguin heroes Hubie and Rocko attacked by orcas, which leads to Rocko's Disney Death.

    Otters 

Clams. This is actually true as shellfish are a predominant part of a sea otter's diet. Seafood in general is also common.

___

-   _The Angry Beavers_: In one episode, Norbert attempts to lure out an otter family that took over their dam by tempting them with a buffet of cooked fish, mollusks, and shellfish. But the otters decline, explaining that they recently swore off seafood because of pollution in the waterways. Upon which Norb gets food poisoning, having tasted one of the dishes.
-   _Bear in the Big Blue House_: Pip and Pop Otter are really big on clams. In the show's Christmas Special, they even asked for "tons of tons for clams" for Christmas. This was later made awkward when it was revealed in further installments that clams are currency in their hometown of Woodland Valley.
-   A GEICO commercial saw the Gecko trying to explain insurance to an otter. He asks if the otter is eating clams, and then professes his own love for clams... Yeah.
-   In _Happy Tree Friends_, Russell loves to eat clams and mussels.
-   _Saban's Adventures of the Little Mermaid_: Ridley the otter is obsessed with eating clams.
-   _Windfall_: One of the main characters is an anthropomorphic otter, of unspecified species, and her family's love of seafood is a running gag throughout the book. Their house's weathervane has a trout on it, family heirlooms include a collection of sushi knives and a stash of fish and oyster sauce, one of her uncles brews beer out of seaweed, and they have a crab roast at family reunions.
-   _Animal Crossing_ has Pascal the otter, who adores scallops. In most games he'll give you special items if you give him a scallop.

    Owls 

Mice and other small rodents. Though rodents are part of their main diet, they're only a _part_. Owls will eat just about any small animal it can catch, including other birds.

___

-   _Calvin and Hobbes_: In an arc in which Calvin turns into an owl, Hobbes wonders in one strip if the pet shop will sell him mice to eat.
-   _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_: One episode has Billy's mother go on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge against a particular species of owl when she thought one of them ate her beloved snot-covered rat after she let it out to roam in the yard. In the end it was revealed by an animal expert that the owls could not have eaten her pet since they were vegetarians. It was actually Big Eater Billy's dad who devoured her rat.
-   _Harry Potter_: Hedwig goes out every night to catch mice and frogs. Commercially-available Owl Treats are also mentioned, which in the games appear to be little rolls of meat.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Spike uses this assumption to try to frame Twilight Sparkle's new pet owl Owlowiscious (who he was jealous of), by finding a toy mouse and covering it in ketchup so that it looks like blood.
-   _Once Upon a Forest_: A scary one-eyed owl chases down the main characters, who are a hedgehog, a mole and a woodmouse.
-   _The Owl House_:
    -   In order to access her harpy form, it is said that Eda must eat a few voles as part of a deal. The Owl Beast inside her seems to enjoy them.
    -   Hooty is a subversion, since his Trademark Favorite Food is actually bugs.
-   _The Secret of NIMH_: Mrs. Brisby is afraid to go see the Great Owl because owls eat mice. That said, he's also rather content with eating a _spider_ instead of her, making him one of the few arthropod-eating owls in fiction.

    Pandas 

Bamboo. Pandas in fiction will only ever eat bamboo. Admittedly in Real Life it does form a major part of their diet, but not to exclusion as they will also eat other vegetation plus eggs, fish, and carrion. The bamboo association comes from the fact that pandas have the same dietary needs as your average grizzly, but (possibly when they noticed bamboo was edible) they got too lazy somewhere along the line to actually catch anything that's not rooted down, and bamboo is plentiful where they live; so if you see a panda in the wild, and it's eating, there's a good chance it'll be eating bamboo.

___

-   _The Berenstain Bears_: The Panda family from _...and the New Neighbors_ grow bamboo in their yard (which Papa mistook for a spite fence due to his initial distrust for them) and make bamboo-based dishes, including barbecued shoots and bamboo juice. However, they also enjoy the honey the Bear family offer them as a welcome gift.
-   _Kung Fu Panda_: Mostly averted, as Po is a very indiscriminate eater, outside of a few incidents:
    -   _Kung Fu Panda 2_: There's a brief mention of Po eating Mr. Ping's bamboo furniture when he was a cub.
    -   The third film shows young pandas eating the dumplings and noodles he uses as markers on a map. He points his bamboo stick at one for a scolding, only for the young panda to eat half of the stick in one bite. Po even says he saw that coming.
-   _Minecraft_: Pandas spawn in bamboo forests with jungle biomes, drop bamboo and will follow players holding the bamboo item. They will also breed when fed bamboo, but only if at least five bamboo plants are present in a five-block radius. However, they will also eat cake.
-   _Shirokuma Cafe_: Panda is constantly asking for bamboo to eat. After he becomes a regular at Polar Bear's cafe, Polar Bear keeps a stock of bamboo and experiments with new bamboo-based dishes.
-   _We Bare Bears_: Subverted. Panda mostly eats human foods, albeit vegetarian ones. When he actually gets to eat bamboo in "Bear Cleanse", he's shown to be rather disgusted. Interestingly, he seems to like bamboo-flavored foods in "Primal", although he was suffering Sanity Slippage at the moment and it may also have been a sign of him reverting to his primal instincts. "Panda 2" reveals he used to love eating bamboo when he was a cub at a wildlife sanctuary, but that was because it was the only food he was fed.
-   _Donkey Hodie_: In order to determine who gets to bounce on the Bounce-a-rino in "A Fair Way To Bounce", Purple Panda suggests a purple bamboo-eating contest. This is odd, because according to "Panda Hodie", his favorite food is tuna fish sandwiches, and in other episodes, he's seen eating food like spaghetti and pancakes and has mentioned liking foods like pizza and cereal.

    Parrots 

Crackers. The association of parrots with crackers probably comes from parrots being kept as pets by sailors back when crackers were one of the only non-perishable foods available for long sea voyages. Real parrots are more likely to want fruits, seeds, nuts and even meat. It should be noted crackers are harmful to a parrot's health if eaten regularly, since many are high in sodium, fats and sugar.

___

-   _Aladdin_: Subverted. Iago the parrot hates crackers, but to his annoyance he's force-fed them by the Sultan anyway. After Jafar uses the Genie's lamp to take over Agrabah, Iago takes great delight in violently stuffing the Sultan full of crackers. He also hates it when anyone else brings up crackers.
    
    **Cassim:** Good birdie. Polly want a little—  
    **Iago:** Say "cracker" and I'll let you have it on principle!
    
-   _Minecraft_: Originally, you could tame parrots by feeding them cookies. However, it was later changed to that parrots will _die_ if you feed them cookies (since they contain chocolate, which parrots are allergic to) and you instead tame them with seeds.
-   _Nancy Drew_: Played with in _Curse of Blackmoor Manor_, in which Loulou eats homemade block cakes Nancy must assemble and microwave. The proper recipe comprises a variety of parrot-appropriate ingredients _including_ crackers.
-   In the book Radio Fifth Grade by Gordon Korman, Winston Churchhill the parrot is given crackers to try and make him talk. They end up giving him hiccups instead.
-   _Rio_: Inverted, as Blu and other macaws will eat anything _except for_ crackers. In _Rio 2_, Ricardo expresses his disgust for crackers as part of his trauma from being captured by humans.
    
    **Ricardo**: "Polly want a cracker? _POLLY WANT A CRACKER?!_" NO! ENOUGH CRACKERS! _I hate crackers!_
    
-   _Terraria_: You can summon yourself a pet Parrot using the item Parrot Cracker.

    Penguins 

Fish, especially herring, sardines and mackerel. Truth in Television as fish is in fact their main food (although different penguin species eat different types of fish), though they also eat krill and squid. They're also shown eating frozen desserts like ice cream or shaved ice in cartoons, which needlessly to say is ill advised in real life.

___

-   _Batman Returns_: At one point, the Penguin greedily eats a raw fish.
-   In _Bloom County_, herring is Opus's Trademark Favorite Food. Sardines, mackerel and squid are also occasionally mentioned.
-   In _Cheers_, Carla's husband Eddie gets a job as a penguin mascot. When she asks him what he wants for dinner, he says he has a craving for mackerel.
-   _Chilly Willy_ is always searching for either fish to eat or a way to stay warm.
-   _Happy Feet_ revolves around Mumble trying to find a way to get the fish back for the starving penguins by communicating with the "aliens" who were stealing it (actually humans).
-   _The Penguins of Madagascar_: The penguins have several episodes involving their love of fish (for example making a growth ray so they can have more fish to eat, stealing a truck filled with fish when their diet of fresh fish was replaced with disgusting fish-cake shaped imitations, and defeating a giant monstrous fish in a nearby park lake then turning it into sushi).
-   _Pingu_: Fish is regularly eaten by the penguins, and Pingu's school includes lessons on fish-catching.
-   _Surf's Up_: Played with. Cody the rockhopper penguin (and presumably the other penguins) eats fish, but enjoys the squid on a stick served on the island where the surfing competitions take place... because it Tastes Like Chicken.
-   In the aforementioned _The Wrong Trousers_, the new tenant Feathers McGraw decides to move into Gromit's fully-furnished room instead of the spare room Wallace intended to rent out. When Gromit sneaks in later, he finds that his yellow bone pattern wallpaper has been replaced with a blue fish pattern.

    Pigs 

Corn cobs, pigswill (obviously), apples, and in the UK, turnips. Also humans. Pigs are also stereotyped as loving truffles or just any kind of mushroom due to the practice of using pigs to find truffles. The love of mushrooms is even applied to wild boars. When roasted, they will always have an apple in their mouth. Real life pigs are omnivorous and none too picky at all about their diet, hence why many family farms fed them whatever organic garbage they had on hand (pigswill), sometimes even emptying their outhouse into the feeding trough.

___

-   Joan from _Animal Crossing_ is a boar who sells turnips every Sunday morning in every game up to _New Leaf_ as the game's equivalent to the stock market. In _New Horizons_, her granddaughter Daisy Mae takes over. Then there’s the pig villager Truffles with her turnip shirt.
-   In the 1954 _Animal Farm_ movie, Squealer is teaching some piglets a math equation. As soon as he writes down the answer, he is shocked to see that his students ate all the apples on the abacus.
-   _Charlotte's Web_ has the pigswill. The lovingly-written lists of its ingredients and sensual descriptions of Wilbur indulging in it would be Food Porn if it weren't made of garbage and leftovers.
-   _Dennis the Menace (UK)_: Dennis' pet pig Rasher can be lured places with turnips, and otherwise has his head in a trough of swill.
-   _Discworld_: Kids leaving out a sherry and a pork pie for the Hogfather also leave a turnip for the wild boars who pull his sleigh, as a counterpart to Roundworld kids leaving a carrot for the reindeer. When Death has to fill in for him his butler Albert eats one that he mistook for a pork pie after too many sherrys.
-   _Gravity Falls_: Waddles' favorite food is caramel apples.
-   _Minecraft_: While there are no turnips in the game, pigs maintain an affinity for root vegetables. They can be bred by feeding them potatoes, carrots or beetroots, and will follow any player holding one of these items.
-   _The Muppet Show_: In one "Pigs in Space" skit, the crew of the _Swinetrek_ are distracted from finding the Ultimate Answer because the galley is serving "Swill Stroganoff".
-   In _Story of Seasons_ games where you can befriend wild animals, wild boars will usually prefer mushrooms. In some games you can use pet pigs or boars to find truffles and other fungi.
-   The _U.S. Acres_ comics often show Orson eating pigswill. This, however, is averted in the animated adaptation, where the characters eat foods like sandwiches, pie, cookies and pizza. However, one stock pig food, corn, is used on occasion, usually as a joke where creamed corn is dumped on somebody, and there was even an episode where Orson had to find a missing corn crop.
-   _Hercules_: When Hercules slays the Erymanthian Boar, the next scene shows a vase of him serving it with an apple in its mouth.
-   During the luau scene in _The Lion King_, Pumbaa has an apple in his mouth because the song is performed to entice the hyenas into eating Pumbaa.
-   In _Pokémon_ the Pokedex states that the boar-based Pokemon Swinub loves eating mushrooms.
-   _The Hunger Games_: When Katniss has to show off her skills for the Gamemakers, they're distracted by a feast that includes a roast pig with an apple in its mouth. When they can't even be bothered to pay attention to her (with her life at stake), she gets so pissed that she shoots an arrow at the apple, narrowly missing the Gamemakers. They're impressed by her fiery spirit and give her a score of 11/12.
-   In _Home on the Range_, Maggie sticks an apple in a piglet's mouth, telling him "not to go near any luaus."

    Piranhas 

_Meat_, favoring humans and cows (the latter thanks to the famous story from Theodore Roosevelt's trip to the Amazon). Real Life piranhas typically hunt other fish (or even fruit), and only rarely engage in their infamous feeding frenzies; reports of attacks on humans are based on piranhas scavenging drowned carcasses.

___

-   _Happy Tree Friends_: Shown in the episode _Something Fishy_, as Russell's pet piranha goes on a killing spree at the school. Russell is also seen feeding it a chicken drumstick.

    Praying mantis 

The female praying mantis is almost always shown eating its mate, which was once believed to be their normal behavior. It's now known that it isn't actually extremely common, but the result of multiple individuals being put in terrariums together with not enough food. Has its own trope, Mantis Mating Meal.

    Rabbits 

Overwhelmingly focused on carrot, though non-anthromorphic rabbits are sometimes shown eating lettuce. Rabbits do like both vegetables, but mostly they eat hay or grass, and particularly love clover. Carrots also have too much sugar for them to eat regularly without causing diabetes (and they tend to eat the leafy part first). Darker works might portray hares as meat-eating rabbits however.

___

-   BabyFirstTV's Harry the Bunny character. His talking plush toy release even says "Carrots are my favorite treat."
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: The rabbit/carrot stereotype is discussed and questioned by Anya: "And what's with all the carrots? What do they need such good eyesight for anyways?"
-   _Bugs Bunny_: Bugs has been shown eating lettuce (with carrots, of course), exactly once in his career. Any other time has been strictly carrots.
    -   Bugs eating a carrot was intended by Tex Avery and the other _Looney Tunes_ directors as a Shout-Out to an old Clark Gable movie called _It Happened One Night_, one of the most popular movies of its day. Carrots became a favorite of other cartoon rabbits through Lost in Imitation and the Parody Displacement.
    -   His carrot also acted as a perfect mimicry prop since it could substitute for just about anything, such as Groucho Marx's cigar or a gun. (And yes, the carrot is a deadly weapon.)
    -   In _Forward March Hare_, his diet of carrots came in handy during his eye chart test. He was able to read _every_thing, including the fine print: "Acme Eye Test Chart, Printed by the United States Printing Office, Washington, D.C., Reg. U.S. Pat. Off."
-   _Bunnicula_: While Bunnicula sinks his fangs into most veggies, he notably drains several carrots dry.
-   In "The Splat Spot!" from _Butterbean's Cafe_, the titular cafe serves the Hops family of rabbits a big carrot-themed family dinner and dessert.
-   _Creative Galaxy_: In the Easter episode, Arty has to stop the Easter Bunny from eating up the carrots that they're using to make orange coloring for the Easter eggs. At the end of the episode, Arty and his family entice the Easter Bunny to join for Easter dinner with the promise of carrot cake for dessert.
-   _Creepy Carrots_, written by Aaron Reynolds and illustrated by Peter Brown, is about Jasper Rabbit, a rabbit whose favorite food is the carrots that he regularly raids from the nearby Crackenhopper Field. The carrots are delicious and seemingly free for the taking, at least until one day they start coming to life and appearing to the rabbit everywhere, until finally he seals off the carrot patch so they can never trouble him again.
-   _The Crumpets_: In "Insectator", Cassandra becomes obsessed with the video game _Maxi Monsters Wars_ where her character is a ninja rabbit. After she defeats the robot character of her neighbor Pfff, she holds a partially eaten carrot as she laughs maniacally. She would be seen hopping in her bedroom with carrot leaves on the floor and she eats another carrot. When Pfff is sleepwalking and views the world as if he's in that video game, he finds Cassandra as the ninja rabbit as she eats another carrot.
-   _The Curse of the Were-Rabbit_: The rabbits love to eat carrots (in fact, Gromit feeds the ones they catch only chopped carrots), but also enjoy eating any other vegetables and fruit they can find (which is unfortunate for those who were growing them for the vegetable competition) necessitating the need for Wallace and Gromits' temporary rabbit catching services.
-   In _Dark Chronicle_, you recruit one character, an anthropomorphic rabbit, to your trainload of support characters by giving him a carrot. Not that he'd admit it.
-   _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_ brings it up during Monokuma's two-man comedy routine, where he attempts to guess the favorite food of Monomi (a rabbit). Monomi states that "it's obvious what rabbits like", and is expecting him to say 'carrots' after he starts off with the first two letters of the word. Monokuma, being Monokuma, answers in full with 'cadavers' instead.
-   _Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance_: Zig-zagged. While Toto Bunny is known as a homeworld for rabbit demons and as a major exporter of carrots, you're just as likely to see the natives use them as a food source as you are to see them used as _weapons_.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  As for Usalia herself, she overtly rejects them whenever offered because they accelerate the curse she's under; she secretly adores them.
-   Disney:
    -   _Alice in Wonderland_: The White Rabbit grows carrots in his garden; Alice ends up eating one to shrink herself after she grows to giant size in his house. His live-action counterpart in _Adventures in Wonderland_ also adores carrots, lettuce, and other leafy green vegetables. He even enjoys carrot-flavored cereal, Carrot Crunchies.
    -   _Winnie-the-Pooh_: Rabbit zig-zags this in the Disney adaptations. He has a vegetable garden with a variety of crops: carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, pumpkins, etc. But oddly, he's rarely, if ever, seen eating carrots despite growing them. In _Welcome to Pooh Corner_, in a song about trying new things, he sings that he used to only eat carrots, but now he loves all kinds of vegetables.
    -   _Zootopia_: Judy buys an instant carrots pack for dinner, her parents run a carrot farm, she owns a carrot-shaped pen that works as a voice recorder, and Nick's nickname for her is "Carrots".
-   _Doraemon: Nobita's Chronicles of the Moon Exploration_: The Moonbits, a Moon Rabbit race with their own technology, have carrots as part of their staple diet, from carrot cakes to carrot buns, houses shaped like giant carrots, carrot motifs in their architecture, and even carrot smoothie in bottles shaped like — you guessed it — carrots.
-   _Drawn_: Pictures of carrots can be used to attract or decoy bunnies.
-   In _EarthBound (1994)_, the Carrot Key is the Plot Coupon required to make a bunch of rabbit statues disappear.
-   _Elinor Wonders Why_:
    -   In "No Need to Shout," Elinor, her father and mother all each have a single large carrot on their plates at dinner-time. To drive home the point further, before going to bed, Elinor puts on a pink shirt with a picture of a carrot and purple pants with a carrot pattern.
    -   In "Backyard Soup," Elinor and her family make a soup from several of the vegetables in their backyard, including carrots. When they visit her grandparents in Desert Town, they find that they can't make the soup using the same vegetables because they don't grow in the desert. Despite this, the train station where Elinor and her family meet their grandparents is next to what appears to be a cafe with an emblem of three carrots and a giant carrot mounted on two pitchforks on the roof.
    -   In "Colorful and Tasty," Elinor and her friends Olive and Ari, with the help of Elinor's father, bake carrot cupcakes to sell at the local park.
    -   In "Pirate Treasure," Elinor's pirate cap has two crossed carrots in place of the Jolly Roger.
-   _Fluffy Gardens_: Played with, since the narrator mentions real-life rabbits liking the animal's second stock diet (lettuce) rather than carrots. Scoopy the pink rabbit completely averts this with her preference for ice cream.
-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_: Mr. Herriman, an imaginary friend with the appearance of a giant bipedal rabbit, frequently eats carrots, and one episode shows it as a full-on addiction — rather appropriate, given the aforementioned problem with their sugar content.
-   On _Franklin_, Rabbit is shown on at least one occasion to bring carrot juice to school as part of his lunch to drink and is sometimes shown eating carrots.
-   _Happy Tree Friends_: Played with in regards to the rabbit Cuddles, who is stated by Word of God to love carrots, yet the only time he's seen eating one onscreen (in his Smoochie, specifically), he chokes from taking a big bite of it with a seemingly allergic reaction.
-   _Hero: 108_: One episode has the rabbit leader, Jumpy Ghostface, and his clan briefly join villain High Roller's side because he gave them candy, angrily rejecting ApeTrully's offering of carrots as persuasion for living in peace with humans because they already have carrots growing in their kingdom.
-   _hololive_: The VTuber Usada Pekora is rabbit-themed, so naturally she has carrots as hair and outfit decorations; her official description says that "She loves them so much that she always brings a few anywhere she goes". One of her alternate outfits, styled to look like a prisoner, even has a carrot-themed ball and chain — and the crimes that led to her having to don it in the first place include, yes, stealing carrots.
-   _Lonely Wolf Treat_: Even though she hates the stereotype, the friendly bunny Mochi has carrots as her Trademark Favorite Food.
-   _Minecraft_: Rabbits will follow any player holding a carrot, golden carrot or flower. Rabbits will also become ready to breed when these items are fed to them. They will also raid any carrot crops they can find access to, which they will "eat" by reducing their growth stage by one step. If the carrots are at their lowest growth stage, the crop will be destroyed instead.
-   _Monster Rancher 4_: Most Hares and monsters with Hare as its sub-breed have carrots as their favorite food.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Angel Bunny is occasionally shown eating carrots, but he usually enjoys leafy greens and has turned up his nose at carrot pops. In "She Talks to Angel", he's also obsessed with drinking the concentrated carrot extract that Fluttershy keeps for revitalizing weak herbivores.
-   _One Piece_: Carrot is a rabbit Mink (a race of various anthropomorphic mammals) whose favourite food is... well, carrots. When she sneaks onboard the _Thousand Sunny_ as a stowaway the only thing she packs is two carrots for food and a canteen of carrot juice to drink. Then she nearly tears out Luffy's throat when he eats one of her carrots without permission.

-   _The Secret Life of Pets 2_: The rabbit Snowball, newly adopted, eats from a bowl of carrots given to him by his owner, Molly.
-   _'Tis Time for "Torture," Princess_: Defied. When the "torture" is the chance to play with a rabbit, Krall notes that carrots _aren't_ good for rabbits, and as such she limits it to one carrot stick per rabbit per day.
-   _Touhou Project_: Reisen and Tewi, a pair of youkai rabbits, are sometimes depicted eating carrots in fan works. Both of them also wear a carrot pendant.
-   _The Twisted Whiskers Show_: One episode has Goosers try to prevent a rabbit from eating the vegetables from his master's garden, including carrots and lettuce.
-   _Watership Down_: Subverted, as the rabbits correctly eat grass as their staple diet and don't even have a _word_ for "carrot". At best, they'd lump them together with other tasty vegetables as "flayrah", meaning "princely food."
-   This flash video parodies it, along with other traits of your typical talking rabbit.
-   Bunny eats carrots. It's a treat food and is more like candy in that regard.

    Raccoons 

Garbage. Raccoons are omnivores meant to mainly subsist on small freshwater critters such as crayfish, mollusks and frogs, which is why they have those "hands" and a habit of dipping their food in water. But in urban environments, humans' food waste is much more convenient. They're also efficient enough climbers to raid garbage bins.

___

-   In _Avengers: Endgame_, when Natasha and Clint are talking about Rocket Raccoon, Clint comments that he thinks that Rocket technically isn't a raccoon. Natasha answers "Whatever, he eats garbage."
-   _Bojack Horseman_ shows a raccoon garbage man interrogating a raccoon dumpster diver.
-   A _GEICO_ commercial (which was briefly shown in the film adaptation of _The Dark Tower (2017)_) features a group of raccoons eating from a trash can, with one of them trying to get the others to sample his meal. A series of tie-in Internet videos associated with this ad features the raccoons cooking dishes using trash as ingredients.
-   _Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts_: The Fitness Raccoons don't eat trash, but ancient human garbage is a big part of their culture and they take their names from things they find in the dump.
-   _Regular Show_: Rigby, the Funny Animal raccoon, likes to rummage through garbage, and admits he prefers doughnuts from the trash.
-   _Sandra and Woo_: Woo subverts this, and even gets mad when told that raccoons eat garbage.

    Rats 

Human corpses (and if their numbers or size is unusual enough, they may not wait!), filth, garbage, cheese (examples for cheese go in the mice section, since it usually indicates that rats and mice are being used interchangeably), grain stockpiles. Real Life rats will happily eat all of the above, _plus_ anything humans do.

___

-   _All Quiet on the Western Front_ featured rats that would come out after battles to eat the dead soldiers.
-   _Charlotte's Web_: Templeton goes along to the fair with Wilbur so he can gobble up garbage after the place closes. In the film, this gives him an _enormous_ Balloon Belly.
-   _Ratatouille_: Most rats are profoundly unfussy in their eating habits and will cheerfully eat garbage, which causes issues for Remi, who has a taste for fine cuisine.
-   _South Park_: In early episodes, rats would always come to eat Kenny's dead body.
-   _Willard_: Willard trains the rats in his basement to exact revenge on his overbearing boss. At the climax, he commands his Swarm of Rats to eat his boss alive. In the 2003 remake, the rats consume a live cat as well. And in the original movie, the rats turn on Willard himself at the end, and eat him.

    Seals/Sea Lions/Walruses 

Generally shown eating fish, but leopard seals will invariably be seen going after penguins. Walruses will also be shown eating clams. For most pinnipeds (the scientific term for seals and their kin), these are indeed Truth in Television.

___

-   _Happy Feet_ shows a leopard seal as a regular foe of penguins.
-   _The Pebble and the Penguin_ portrays leopard seals as one of the penguins' chief predators.
-   _Pingu_: Robby the seal always eats fish, but in his debut episode is shown eating the seaweed Pingu uses for bait in fishing.
-   _Pokémon_: Dewgong, despite the name, is clearly based on a seal/sea lion, and its dex entry in _Ultra Sun_ says that its favorite food is Wishiwashi.

    Sharks 

Humans, or anything else in the ocean (including fish, which is true). Seals and sea lions in more accurate works, with different species having different preferences. The prehistoric megalodon is always shown eating whales, which is accurate to fossil findings of whale bones with _C. megalodon_ bite marks.

The notion of sharks preying on humans is especially inaccurate (and has led to unfair persecution of even harmless shark species), given the relative rarity of someone being attacked by a shark, let alone actually being _eaten_. Sharks can and do bite, with deadly results for larger species, but it's because biting is their way of figuring out what something is. It isn't their fault humans are so fragile. Additionally, they may simply assume that the figure swimming on the surface is a seal or a sea lion and take a chomp—the unlucky human survives if the shark realizes their mistake and loses interest before said human can bleed to death. Furthermore, sharks are a diverse group of animals with different diets, that can be more restrict than as depicted in media. For example, the whale shark, the basking shark, and the megamouth shark are filter-feeding species that primarily feed on plankton and pose no threat to humans at all. Notably, it's Truth in Television that the scent of blood can throw sharks into a feeding frenzy. This is actually used by tour guides for people who want to swim with sharks. First, some fish is cut up and thrown in front of the sharks, while the divers lay low. When the sharks have sated their appetite and calmed down, the divers can swim among them in relative safety. In some recent works, embryonic sharks have also been stated to eat each other while still in their mother's womb. While true for some species such as the lamniforme sharks, not _all_ shark species do this.

___

-   _Finding Nemo_: Averted in-universe by the sharks, who are part of a vegetarian society. Before this they ate mostly fish and they still consider dolphins to be mockworthy, but there is no mention of them eating either seals or humans. The feeding frenzy part is played straight though, with Bruce going Axe-Crazy after smelling Dory's blood.
-   _hololive_: Gawr Gura, a shark-turned\-Cute Monster Girl, has salmon among her favorite foods, though her actual Trademark Favorite Food appears to be pizza, and has also implied once or twice that she ate all of her siblings in the womb before she was born. She has mentioned that unlike media portrayals, she doesn't eat people, since like real sharks, she doesn't like the flavor; on the other hand, her debut short in _hololive - Holo no Graffiti_ has her succumb to her instincts and latch onto Flare's arm, much to the elf's discomfort.
    
    **Flare:** _(screams in pain)_  
    **Gura:** _(muffled)_ Can't fight my instincts.  
    **Flare:** Say what?  
    **Gura:** I'm eating to live!  
    **Mel:** Don't gotta eat _people._
    
-   _Jaws_ can almost fully be blamed for the "man-eating" stereotype, even though as noted above, no shark species habitually eats humans, let alone great whites. The sequel films are no better, and _Jaws: The Revenge_ even goes so far as to have the shark of the hour try to kill the heroes out of vengeance, not mere hunger (which is confusingly explained in the novel as a voodoo curse, hence the Voodoo Shark trope). It should be noted that after this film, persecution of many _real_ shark species skyrocketed, with many believing (erroneously) that this trope applied in real life.
-   _Kenny the Shark_ goes crazy with hunger whenever he catches scent or sight of a seal. He also eats any form of inedible objects such as junk due to the fact that he's a tiger shark. When it comes to humans, however, this is averted.
-   _The Meg_: The Film of the Book has the titular megalodon eat a humpback whale and its calf. The second one notably doesn't target humans, though, only going into a frenzy among a crowd of beachgoers when they notice it and panic, exciting it too much. The protagonists eventually kill it by cutting its stomach open, which causes its blood to attract all the other sharks in the area and eat it alive.
-   _Sherman's Lagoon_: The eponymous great white shark not only eats humans but _anything_ that gets into his mouth, and has no problems with eating other talking fish.

    Snakes 

Rats, mice, and eggs if they're small, humans if they're huge constrictors. Real life snakes usually have a substantially more varied diet; constrictors are notorious Big Eaters, since they can open their jaws very wide to swallow prey that would otherwise be larger than their heads. Sufficiently large boas and pythons have been documented to eat things like antelopes, crocodiles, or even _other constrictors_. Verified accounts of a snake eating an adult human are another matter though, as its questionable if even the largest living snake could manage to get its jaws around an average human's broad shoulders, and in fact there have been documented instances of constrictors seriously injuring their mouths attempting to do just this. As for eggs, though commonly depicted in fiction due to being less Squicky than live prey, only a few species of snakes eat eggs as part of their main diet. Some species of snake such as boas and pythons can't digest eggs at all.

___

-   _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets:_ The lair of Slytherin's basilisk is littered with various animal bones.
-   _The Jungle Book_: Kaa the python infamously uses his hypnotizing stare on Mowgli in the hope of putting him in a suggestible, easily-eaten state.
-   _Lioden_ has a _Snake_\-like minigame _Reptile Roundup_ where you can choose from many different species of snakes to play as. Regardless of which one you picked, they all eat small rodents and eggs.
-   In _Pokémon_, various Pokédex entries for Ekans (a snake Pokémon) mention that it loves eating eggs from bird Pokémon, such as Pidgey and Spearow. Just like real life egg-eating snakes, Ekans does not have any visible teeth, although it is also venomous, which is unlike its aforementioned real life counterpart.

    Spiders 

Flies, or in a series starring insects, any kind of bug. Spiders are generally treated like the cats of the bug world. This is also why parents tell their kids to never kill spiders in the house, as they do a fairly decent job at catching insects. Large tarantulas will often be portrayed attacking lizards, mice, or small birds, since they're also called "bird-eating spiders", even though they too feed mostly on insects. Giant Spiders, on the other hand, seem to subsist entirely on people.

___

-   _Charlotte's Web_: Charlotte eats all types of insects, but mainly flies, since Wilbur's smelly pigpen attracts them. Wilbur is very disturbed the first time he sees her catch one.
-   _James and the Giant Peach_: The other bugs inside the Peach are wary about Miss Spider, in part because she's creepy, and in part because she's French. Oh, also, she might eat them.
-   Averted by _Lucas the Spider_. He befriends a fly who was initially afraid Lucas was going to eat him, until Lucas explains that he eats mostly human food like buttered toast and strawberries and such.
-   _Tolkien's Legendarium_: Both the spiders of Mirkwood and Shelob attempt to dine on the protagonists almost as soon as they cross paths. The film versions by Peter Jackson even show said spiders wrapping up the captured, still-living dwarves, hobbits, etc. in silk to be stashed for later.

    Squirrels/Chipmunks 

Any sort of nut, usually acorns or walnuts. In Real Life, they'll go after any source of carbohydrates, the easier the better. Hence stories of urban squirrels and chipmunks raiding bird feeders and trash cans. Most won't hesitate to nom insects or bird eggs, either.

___

-   _Alvin and the Chipmunks_: Subverted. When Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are first left with Dave, he initially tries to feed them nuts, but they decide that they don't like them, and are more interested in what Dave is eating. Any other time they're depicted eating, it's always human food.
-   _Animaniacs_: Slappy Squirrel loves to eat walnuts, and often risked her safety (not that she had anything to worry about) picking walnuts from nearby yards defended by dogs.
-   The BBC: The _Daylight Robbery_ documentary of the late 80s features as its centerpiece a wild squirrel working out how to traverse a fairly fiddly obstacle course in order to obtain the nutty goodness at the other end. So awesome it spawned a sequel. (Original course featured from 1:04.)
-   _Arthur_: "The Squirrels" has Buster and Arthur gaining a fear of squirrels thanks to the titular movie (which has squirrels eating people), and they try to overcome it by luring real squirrels closer to them with acorns. Subverted when Mr. Ratburn explains that squirrels actually have a more varied diet, including meat if they're really hungry (while also pointing out they don't eat people like in the movie).
-   _BlazBlue_: The squirrel beastkin Makoto Nanaya has a thing for chestnuts, as she openly discusses with Celica in _Chronophantasma_ and Blake in _Cross Tag Battle_.
-   _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_: The factory has a room full of trained squirrels shelling walnuts, because Mr. Wonka trusts only squirrels to extract the walnuts in one piece and to tell the bad ones from the good before even cracking them open.
-   _Chip 'n Dale_: The titular chipmunks are a prominent example of chipmunks favoring acorns, though they've been known to expand their diet of acorns to include peanuts and apples in some shorts. And their diet seems much more varied in _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_.
-   Disney: In one Donald Duck cartoon, a flying squirrel (which, unlike Real Life flying squirrels, actually flies) harasses Donald and his peanut stand because Donald wouldn't give him a specific peanut. They proceed to engage into an Escalating War, all because of _that specific peanut_.
-   _Ice Age_: Every Scrat scene has the prehistoric squirrel trying to catch or find a safe spot for his acorn at the risk of his own sanity and safety.
-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_: In one episode, squirrels steal Sheen's Ultralord action figure and worship it because it cracks open their nuts.
-   _Kaeloo_: Stumpy enjoys eating nuts.
-   _Kronk's New Groove_: Bucky the squirrel is given a walnut by Kronk.
-   _Looney Tunes_: In "Much Ado About Nutting", a squirrel looking for nuts finds a coconut and tries unsuccessfully to break it open. Real life squirrels regularly gnaw holes on coconuts to eat the flesh inside.
-   _The Nut Job_ flash cartoon from 2007 (no relation to the 2014 3D animated film) is about squirrels building Humongous Mecha to steal their nuts back from a nut-packing factory.
-   _Over the Hedge_: Subverted with Hammy, who finds himself enjoying human food like donuts, chips, and coffee more than the food he and his mixed animal family used to eat before their home became invaded by suburban home development.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies: Heroes_ has the Squirrel Herder Zombie teammate, who carries a few zombie squirrels on her. Her special ability is to One-Hit Kill a Nut or Berry tribe Plant teammate (or environment) by sending her squirrels to eat it.
-   In _Spongebob Squarepants_, Sandy Cheeks has a big thing for nuts. Most of her inventions are nut-based, such as the machine that could read the thoughts of nuts.
-   Tex Avery: Screwy Squirrel is sometimes shown cracking walnuts by placing them on his head and smashing them with a hammer.
-   _Tom and Jerry_: The end of "In the Bag": Tom got his money bag swapped out with walnuts, and when he opens the bag in the forest and finds out he's been duped, a bunch of squirrels swarm him!

    Termites 

Wood. In Western Animation, their eating of wood will be accompanied by Buzzsaw Jaw. In reality termites are indeed among the few creatures that can digest wood, but they usually go for rotten wood as it's easier to digest, and some species are more general herbivores that feed on roots, grasses and leaves, while still others subsist on fungus farms they tend in their nests.

    Tortoises 

Lettuce. In reality, tortoises need to eat thick, fibrous vegetation. Some tortoise species can have lettuce in moderation. They do seem to love the stuff, it's just not good for them (especially if it's the low-nutrient iceberg kind). They also love mushrooms.

___

-   _Come, Thou Tortoise_ by Jessica Grant is "a novel of love and lettuce".
-   _Mafalda_: Mafalda's pet turtle Bureaucracy's favorite food is lettuce.
-   _Esio Trot_: The tortoises much prefer lettuce to "thick old cabbage leaves".
-   _The Tale of Mr Jeremy Fisher_: Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brings a bag of salad when Jeremy invites him to dinner.

_Tyrannosaurus rex_ 

Other dinosaurs of various kinds, with _Triceratops_ and _Stegosaurus_ being among the most commonly portrayed. When revived in modern times (or encountering time travelers), humans. They're extremely persistent about it, too. We know for a fact that _T. rex_ did eat _Triceratops_, as fossils of the latter have been found with tyrannosaur tooth marks in them. It also would have preyed on ornithopods (particularly the duck-billed dinosaur _Edmontosaurus_), ankylosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, and other theropods (including its own kind). _Stegosaurus_, however, is strictly out of the question due to it dying out eighty-two million years before the appearance of _Tyrannosaurus_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  — which means _Tyrannosaurus_ lived closer in time to _us_ than it did to _Stegosaurus_.

___

-   _Darkwing Duck_: In "Extinct Possiblity", Johnny T. Rex and his two henchmen frequently make quips about eating the _Parasaurolophus_ citizens of Duckbill-ville. They also try to eat Darkwing, Gosalyn, and Launchpad.
-   Wash’s dinosaur skit in the _Firefly_ has a T. rex vs Stegosaurus thing going on. The rex betrays and eats the stegosaurus. “Mine is an evil laugh! Now die!”
-   The _Jurassic Park_ series, naturally.
    -   Perhaps even moreso in the book where the tyrannosaur seems to be stalking Dr. Grant and the kids in particular, even leaving behind a Hadrosaur kill to pursue them down a river. In the movie, it generally only eats humans when they happen to be easily in reach.
    -   In the sequel _The Lost World_ (both the book and movie) the animosity justified because the humans took the baby of the _T. rex_ mated pair (and one of them is _smeared with the blood of said baby_).
-   _King Kong (2005)_: The three _Vastatosaurus rex_ (fictional _T. rex_ descendants) are willing to fight a thirty-foot gorilla just to get at the pretty little human he was carrying. _The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island_ says their preferred prey are actually _Ligocristus_ (fictional hadrosaur resembling _Saurolophus_), _Ferrucutus_ (fictional ceratopsian resembling _Pachyrhinosaurus_), and _Brontosaurus_ (fictional version of the real sauropod).
-   _The Land Before Time_: Sharptooth likes sauropods such as Littlefoot and his mother, but he also goes after Littlefoot's other dinosaur friends.
-   _The Valley of Gwangi_: While technically an _Allosaurus_, Gwangi really loves humans. He develops a taste for elephant, too, though throughout the film it's shown that Gwangi will happily leave behind large kills just to chase after and devour tiny humans.
-   _You Are Umasou_: Heart and his fellow "Big Jaws" are frequently shown hunting ceratopsians, sauropods, and hadrosaurs. The baby _Ankylosaurus_ Umasou gets his name because when he first hatches — Heart thought he looked tasty, and _umasou_ means "delicious" in Japanese.

    Vultures 

Anything that drops dead in a desert. Real vultures eat carrion in any environment, especially forests.

___

-   _Bedknobs and Broomsticks_: During the animated soccer match, the two "medics" are two vultures who look hungrily at the players and get excited when one is apparently wounded and they have the chance to go for him. One can only wonder what they do with the wounded.
-   _Ice Age: The Meltdown_: As the animals flee _en masse_ from the impending flood, a large flock of vultures shadows their movements while gleefully anticipating the feast they'll get from potential casualties. They even sing a song about how much they're looking forward to eating giant, deceased mammals.
    
    **Vulture:** There is some good news, though. The more of you die, the better I eat.
    
-   _Looney Tunes_: _The Lion’s Busy_ has Beaky Buzzard hanging around Leo the Lion, who is celebrating his tenth birthday, knowing that lions rarely live past that. Leo points out that Beaky should wait until he’s dead since buzzards typically eat their prey well after they are "decently deceased." Beaky ignores this fact.
    -   _The Looney Tunes Show_'s take on Beaky Buzzard is a helper buzzard that saves animals stranded in the desert, but will eat his clients if he doesn’t make it in time.
-   _Pokémon_: Mandibuzz (a buzzard) will circle in the sky looking for weakened Pokémon (Cubone in particular is a favorite victim) to prey on; they will also decorate themselves and their nests with their prey’s bones.
-   _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_: The vultures eye the chase scene between the dwarfs and the witch with hunger in their eyes. They know that no matter the outcome, they'll feast tonight. They're last seen circling eagerly downward toward the witch's unseen body after she falls to her Disney Villain Death.

    Weasels/Minks/Stoats/Ferrets 

Rabbits and rodents. The tiniest mustelid can impressively take down rabbits three times its size. Also chickens; if the predator villain in a chicken story isn't a fox, it's probably a weasel. In the case of minks, fish and muskrats are preferred prey. Weasels will sometimes be portrayed liking eggs, which is Truth in Television. And like mongooses above, weasels will sometimes counter snakes or snake-like creatures (such as the mythical Basilisk and Cockatrice), despite the two species not being any more closely related than cats are to dogs.

___

-   _Back at the Barnyard_: Freddy the ferret is best friends with the chicken Peck but constantly has to fight his instinctual urge to eat him.
-   _Garfield and Friends_: The recurring weasel villain from _U. S. Acres_ frequently tries to eat the chickens, including Sheldon (who is still an egg).
-   _I Am Weasel_: Eggs are the Trademark Favourite Food of I. M. Weasel.
-   _Looney Tunes_:
    -   Some of the Foghorn Leghorn shorts have a small weasel constantly trying to get within tooth's range of the chickens.
    -   In _My Green Fedora_, Peter Rabbit's baby brother Elmer is kidnapped by a rather large, hungry weasel.
-   _The Wainscott Weasel_: The titular character's father built a tunnel into a nearby farmer's henhouse in order to provide the local weasels with a ready source of eggs.
-   _The Wild Thornberrys_: In "Show Me the Bunny", Eliza tries to protect a rabbit from a hungry stoat.

    Whales 

Krill and plankton, or, in the case of sperm whales, giant squid. The plankton-eating stereotype is true for baleen whales (blue whales, grey whales, right whales, humpback whales...) but not for toothed whales. Sperm whales are sometimes erroneously shown as krill eaters as well when they are toothed whales. If not, they'll usually be shown fighting giant squid.

___

-   _Bojack Horseman_ has an anthropomorphic sperm whale swallowing up anthropomorphic krill.
-   _Finding Nemo_ has a blue whale who tries to eat krill but accidentally swallows Marlin and Dory.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   The infamous episode “One Coarse Meal” has Plankton fearing that Pearl will eat him like a whale ate his family. Though Pearl is a sperm whale. Who prefers salad.
    -   In "Feral Friends", the entire cast (sans Sandy) is reverted into animals that look and behave realistically. Pearl sees Squidward as a tasty snack.

    Wolves 

Sheep, pigs, and people (especially little girls in red hoods). In Real Life, they _very_ rarely take humans, but will eat pretty much any animal in their habitat, with a preference for medium to large ungulates. Indeed, more realistically-oriented works tend to show them preying on deer or moose.

Many portrayals of werewolves also have them gaining a taste for human flesh.

___

-   _The 10th Kingdom_: Wolf often craves all classic wolf foods.
-   _Clever Polly and the Stupid Wolf_; apparently the whole of wolf society, including their nursery rhymes, are based on eating people.
-   _Looney Tunes_: Ralph the wolf constantly tries to steal sheep from Sam the sheepdog's flock, and fails every time.
-   _Minecraft_: Wolves will go after sheep and rabbits — they will chase down and try to kill any they spot. On the other hand, they'll only try to eat humans if you attack them first, and if you stand near them holding a bone or porkchop they will stare at it hopefully.
-   _Piggsburg Pigs!_: The wolves Huff and Puff always try to catch the eponymous pigs.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_ has an anthropomorphic wolf and his wife who try to hunt the (equally anthropomorphic) neighboring goats with the same results as Ralph.
-   _Rocko's Modern Life_: In "Who's For Dinner?", the Wolfe family are shown eating a moose carcass at dinner much like how real wolves do, but they're also shown to keep pigs and little girls in red hoods captive presumably to be eaten later.
-   In _White Fang,_ the starving wolf pack tries to make a meal out of two human explorers as a last resort.
-   This one is deeply rooted in Fairy Tales like _Little Red Riding Hood_, _The Three Little Pigs_, _The Boy Who Cried Wolf_, and many more. Like with sharks, this has had the negative impact of people hunting wolves to extinction in some areas, despite that wolf attacks on humans are rare (their proclivity for eating livestock probably also had something to do with this, though).

    Worms 

Dirt. Truth in Television, but they're actually filtering out the tiny bits of organic matter _in_ dirt. When a worm _isn't_ shown eating dirt, expect it to be inside of an apple instead (which ultimately is its own trope).

___

-   _Earthworm Jim_: One of Jim's catchphrases is "eat dirt!"
-   _James and the Giant Peach_: In the film version, Mr. Earthworm says he only eats dirt, and when he, James and all the other bugs taste the peach later, he remarks "It's not dirt, but it's not bad."
-   _Worms Armageddon_: One of the Idle Animations is a worm picking up a piece of dirt from the terrain and munching on it.

    Menageries 

Several of the above at the same time.

___

-   _Baku Baku Animal_ is based on this trope: dogs eat bones, rabbits eat carrots, pandas eat bamboo, monkeys eat bananas, and mice eat cheese.
-   In _Sid & Al's Incredible Toons_, Sid E. Mouse goes for cheese and Al E. Cat goes for fish, though both of them also go for bananas and bubblegum and, of course, Al will also eat Sid. Eunice the elephant will Hoover up any peanut in sight.
-   In the farming sim game _Hay Day,_ cats and kittens drink milk, dogs and puppies eat bacon (the only meat in the game aside from fish), and horses, donkeys, and bunnies eat carrots. Chickens, cows, pigs, sheep, and goats eat processed feed made from various mixtures of wheat, corn, carrots, and soybeans. Squirrels gather peanuts and bees gather flower nectar to make into honey, both of which can be harvested by the player.

    Miscellaneous/Real Life 

___

-   Lammergeiers, or bearded vultures, eat almost exclusively bones, or rather the marrow in the bones.
-   If you see a lizard in a cartoon, chances are, he/she is gonna be shown eating insects and catching them with a long sticky tongue. This raises quite a few problems, since the only known lizards to have a long sticky tongue are Chameleons and Green Iguanas are often used... who just happen to be herbivores.
    -   Green iguanas can and usually do subsist on plants only. But they will actually eat meat if it's easily available and doesn't require too much biting. Moreover, pet iguanas go gaga for chafer grubs. Also, the iguana can make the tip of its tongue slightly sticky — simply by flexing the tongue the right way.
    -   A variation on this is that frogs — amphibians, not lizards, but regardless — will _always_ be seen eating houseflies _exclusively_, when in reality they're much less picky about what they do eat. Most species of frogs and toads will eat anything that is smaller than themselves and doesn't have a good defense like a noxious taste, including smaller conspecifics, and in some cases they will even take on larger prey.
-   A few lesser known examples: alligators love chicken, crocodiles enjoy rats, and caimans primarily subsist on fish. A fairly obscure extension for alligators is that they absolutely adore marshmallows. It's obviously not something they can live on, but they'll also eat fruit as part of enrichment. Like watermelon.
-   Porcupines are salt addicts, due to the lack of sodium in their normal diet (tree bark & leaves). This is why you should never leave wood- or leather-handled tools or unwashed socks outdoors overnight in porcupine country, as they'll gnaw on sweaty grips or eat fabric for the sweat that permeates it. Avi did his research, having Poppy's Deadpan Snarker porcupine friend, Ereth, have a literal addiction to salt (especially salt lick; Poppy and her mouse family get him one for his birthday in the novel _Ereth's Birthday_). Darker portrayals of porcupines may portray them as carnivorous flesh-eaters when in real-life, Indian crested porcupines scavenge carrion.
-   Songbirds and worms. Occasionally they will eat insects. Or breadcrumbs, if the focus is on the friendly Bird Woman.
-   Truth in Television: Polar bears really love to eat toothpaste.
-   Although they don't encounter it in nature, elephants LOVE chocolate. One episode of "Inside Nature's Giants" had a team of biologists determining the inner contents of an enclosure elephant's digestive system by feeding it a recording device with a chocolate outer coating.
-   If you have a pet rabbit, they will eat all sorts of things, including human food. However, none of it is good for their delicate digestive systems, except romaine lettuce.
-   Asian palm civets, known as _luwak_, eats (among other things) coffee fruit.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  After passing through the animal's digestive system, the beans are then turned into the most expensive brand of coffee in the world... TMI?
    -   It's unclear whether the coffee's flavor is changed by the digestive juices or if the civet is simply able to detect the best beans. It's probably a combination of both.
-   Cats love ham and pork. Bacon is often too salty, but cooked pork and ham are safe to feed as a treat. They also adore cheese, even if they aren't interested in regular milk. Some like to lick (or even eat) watermelon and/or cucumbers. They can also have a little salami as a treat.
-   Rats eat virtually anything people do, which is why they thrive in our cities, but they're especially fond of scrambled eggs.
-   People usually think of monkeys and apes as vegetarians, but chimps and baboons will readily kill and eat small animals, including small monkeys. Chimps also love termites, using spit-moistened twigs or blades of grass to get them.
-   Big cats:
    -   Lions are invariably shown as predators of zebras, wildebeest, antelopes, and buffaloes.
    -   Tigers hunt water buffalo, deer, and wild boar.
    -   Cheetahs prefer gazelles.
    -   Leopards are generally shown to be hunting antelopes and monkeys.
    -   Jaguars are usually portrayed as predators of tapirs, caimans, capybaras, and turtles.
-   In nonfiction, grey wolf packs are typically shown preying on moose, elk, caribou, and bison.
-   Giraffes are commonly described eating acacia leaves.
-   Dinosaurs:
    -   In older dinosaur books, _Baryonyx_ will always be mentioned as a fish-eating dinosaur (with maybe one exception), although this is probably true for spinosaurids as a whole.
    -   Also in older dinosaur books, _Coelophysis_ will typically be eating its own young, although bones once attributed to juvenile coelophysoids more likely came from nondinosaurian reptiles.
    -   Also in older dinosaur books, _Oviraptor_ tends to eat the eggs of other dinosaurs. In fact, it was _named_ "Egg Thief" because its fossil was found next to a clutch of eggs. However, this may be a subversion and a Never Live It Down due to studies showing that those eggs were its own, and was trying to take care of them instead! Its current diet is something of a mystery, but science leans towards most likely omnivore (this of course means eggs are still potentially on the table, just unlikely to be its primary source of food).
    -   Much like _Oviraptor_, ornithomimids and _Troodon_ often take roles as nest-raiders as well. Although the latter usually goes after hatchlings rather than eggs and its victim usually being _Maiasaura_. However, for ornithomimids this has fallen out of practice as of late and nowadays they are portrayed as omnivores with a slight herbivore leaning.
    -   Therizinosaurs were once considered piscivores or insectivores, but these days, they'll invariably be mentioned as unusual herbivorous theropods. In really, really old works when they were still paleontological enigmas, they were portrayed as ferocious carnivores that used their massive claws to eviscerate other dinosaurs (this is where _Dino Crisis_ got their portrayal).
    -   _Allosaurus_ is generally shown as the mortal enemy of _Stegosaurus_ and the various sauropods of the Jurassic period (_Diplodocus_, _Brachiosaurus_, _Apatosaurus_). Definitely Truth in Television for the former as fossils of _Stegosaurus_ and _Allosaurus_ with grievous injuries from each other exist. The latter is a subject of debate among dino-buffs though. Juveniles might have been more preferable. Lesser known in popular fiction, but universally accepted amongst scientists is that the _Iguanodon_\-like _Camptosaurus_ was a big part of _Allosaurus_' diet.
    -   _Gastornis_ (aka _Diatryma_), the large flightless bird, was traditionally portrayed as a hunter of small horse-like ungulates such as _Hyracotherium_. This is now a case of Science Marches On, as isotope analysis have shown it was actually a herbivore that used its powerful beak to crack open nuts or snap branches (though this has yet to catch on in popular media, for fairly obvious reasons).
-   The standard fictional pterosaur is an eagle-like carnivore capable of carrying off a man, but in more realistic portrayals of pterosaurs, they're almost always depicted as fish-eaters based on the behavior of the most famous pterosaurs _Pteranodon_ and _Rhamphorhynchus_. Real pterosaurs ran the gamut of dietary preferences though.
    -   The gigantic _Quetzalcoatlus_ was frequently depicted as a vulture-like scavenger in early paleoart, due to living in more terrestrial areas than the coastal _Pteranodon_ and based on its anatomy being adept at soaring flight. The most common invocation of this was usually depicting flocks of _Quetzalcoatlus_ circling over herds of migrating dinosaurs, waiting for one of them to keel over from exhaustion so they can swoop down and eat the remains. Later findings suggest that _Quetzalcoatlus_ would have been a more active hunter like a giant stork, striding or even galloping along to snatch up small animals with their long toothless beaks; nowadays, it seems _Quetzalcoatlus_' Trademark Favorite Food has become live baby sauropods. And sometimes live baby _T. rexes_.
-   The _other_ famous non-dinosaurs, marine reptiles (plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, pliosaurs), are typically depicted eating fish, turtles, cephalopods, or seabirds, all of which are consistent with the fossil record. The large mosasaurs, like _Tylosaurus_, also tend to be depicted with a particular fondness for eating _Pteranodons_ that they snatch out of the sky midflight (no fossil evidence exists for this behavior—barring _Pteranodon_ and _Tylosaurus_ living in the same environment—and even if it did occur, the mosasaur would almost certainly have attacked the flying reptile while it was _in_ the water rather than flying over it). Sometimes, the sea reptiles are also shown going for each other, which is not out of the question for large mosasaurs and pliosaurs.
-   Harlequin shrimp eat starfish and nothing but.
-   Sperm whales are typically mentioned as predators of giant squid (they compromise 80% of its diet!). Baleen whales are, of course, plankton and krill eaters.
-   Rays are usually shellfish-eaters, although manta rays are plankton-skimming filter feeders.
-   Starfish are commonly portrayed as predators of clams and mussels.
-   Octopus and squid are typically portrayed as predators of fishes and crabs, which does apply for most species. The bigger ones are usually shown as man-eaters, despite there being no actual reports of this happening.
-   Harpy eagles are known for being predators of monkeys and sloths, which form about half their diet, but they'll take on any sorts of prey such as macaws and even deer.
    -   The Philippine eagle is also often shown eating monkeys in books and documentaries, and was even known as the monkey-eating eagle at one point. However, the name was changed due to the discovery that monkeys are _not_ its Trademark Favorite Food— it prefers to feed on flying lemurs and cloud rats.
-   Flamingos are often said to be shrimp-eaters, but this is a generalization (the greater flamingo does eat crustaceans, but the lesser flamingo mostly feeds on algae).
-   Parrots and toucans are often thought of as frugivores or at least herbivores, but they will occasionally eat smaller animals such as insects, frogs, rodents, and even other birds.
-   Pelicans are famous for their affinity for fish, and indeed are specialized for feeding on such meals. Occasionally, however, they've been known to go after smaller birds, though the reason behind this is not known.
-   Storks, at least in Eastern Europe, are stereotypically associated with eating frogs (and thus appear as villains or menaces in stories about frogs).
-   _Smilodon_, the iconic saber-tooth cat, is often shown hunting mammoths and mastodons, giant ground sloths, and cavemen. While there are kernels of truth to this idea, _Smilodon_, much like tigers and lions, likely preferred large ungulates (as supported by isotope analyses) such as bison, horses, llamas, tapirs, and North American camels, while in South America, they also went after the native ungulates such as _Toxodon_ or _Macrauchenia_. As _Smilodon_ was about the size of a tiger or lion, undoubtedly, its relationship with mammoths and mastodons would have mirrored that of extant big cats and elephants, i.e. they would have mainly preyed on young animals, while adults (due to their sheer size) would have been safe from predation, even if sabretooths hunted in groups like lions (as some workers suggested). Smaller, bear-sized ground sloths like _Megalonyx_ or _Paramylodon_ could have also been on the menu, but probably not as much as ungulates, as there were powerful beasts with formidable claws (for comparison, the much smaller giant anteaters can chase off and even kill jaguars), while elephant-sized ones like _Megatherium_ or _Eremotherium_ were off-limits for obvious reasons. And since _Smilodon_ was native to the Americas, it only overlapped with anatomically modern humans (as in, not primitive cavemen) for a brief time (a few thousand years) and we have no evidence of predation, though it is possible that they would have attacked humans occasionally. Interestingly, its smaller, Old World cousin/ancestor _Megantereon_ coexisted with much more primitive hominids, like _Homo erectus_, _Homo habilis_, and even australopithecines, and we do have some evidence of predation on our ancestors from South Africa and Georgia.
-   Giant ground sloths are often portrayed as omnivorous in fiction based on a controversial theory that they may have supplemented their diet with meat. It's more likely they were purely herbivorous, but when portrayed as meat-eaters, expect it to be carrion stolen from a sabertooth cat. Some go a little further to have them using their massive claws to tear prey to pieces!
    -   Other depictions of giant ground sloths show them eating avocados, based on a hypothesis that avocados coevolved with ground sloths and other prehistoric South American megafauna. The idea is that avocados look like fruits ready to be eaten whole by a large animal, with the pit being pooped out ready to sprout, but no animal currently alive in the region where avocados are from is big enough to eat an avocado whole. Quetzal birds, by the way, can eat small avocados (about olive-sized) whole and disperse their seeds that way. Humans, the theory goes, basically saved avocados from extinction by taking the effort to cultivate them. Humans still can’t swallow avocado seeds though.
-   Craneflies are sometimes nicknamed "mosquito hawks", "mosquito eaters" or "skeeter eaters" and assumed to be specialist predators of—you guessed it!—mosquitos. Turns out, however, that this is a misconception; most adult craneflies only feed on nectar from flowers. Their larval forms are usually omnivores or carnivores with a taste for other insect larvae, but there's still no evidence that they feed on mosquito larvae. Not only that, but some adult craneflies don't eat at all, lacking mouthparts to even do that—this adaptation allows them to pour all their energy into finding a mate and laying eggs before they die.
-   The fruit known as the wolf apple, which is actually a relative of the tomato, gets its name because it is the favorite food of the maned wolf. It composes about 50% of the maned wolf's diet. It is believed that the fruit helps to protect them from parasites.
