**Blake**: Ilia, please! You’re a good person, but you’re making all the wrong decisions!  
**Ilia**: _SHUT UP!_  
**Blake**: Is this really what your parents would’ve wanted?!  
**Ilia**: I don't know what else to do! \[_breaks down in tears_\] I don't know what else to do...

When someone dies (or apparently dies or becomes indefinitely unconscious or is otherwise taken out of the picture), their friends and loved ones have to deal with the aftermath. With emotions likely to be running high, the survivors will be faced with a variety of options and temptations, depending on the situation.

If they are at all thoughtful and respectful, they will sooner or later face the question: "What would the deceased have wanted?" In many cases, someone who is too caught up in grief and/or anger to think clearly will need to be reminded of this point by a cooler-headed friend.

A few common possibilities of actions that they may consider — and then reconsider after realizing that the deceased would not have wanted them to do that:

-   Roaring Rampage of Revenge: If someone is directly responsible for the death, friends of the deceased will be tempted to hunt down and kill the perpetrator. They may be dissuaded if the person they want to avenge did not approve of killing or was too nice to hold a grudge.
-   The Mourning After: The deceased's spouse or lover may shut out any possibility of finding a new partner. They may eventually realize that their lost loved one would want them to move on with life.
-   Taking Up the Mantle: The deceased might have left unfinished business for a friend to take up on his behalf. If this entails sacrificing his own happiness, he may come to understand that the deceased would want him to follow his own path rather than someone else's.
    -   Alternatively, he may come to realize that instead of upholding the departed's legacy, he actually threatens to undermine it or sully it with fanaticism or ruthlessness.

The grieving character's response when this issue is raised generally comes down to one of two options:

1.  He decides (either through someone else's argument or his own realization) that what he intended to do is wrong, and refocuses his grief into something more constructive and consistent with the deceased's values.
2.  He replies with a Shut Up, Kirk!, usually something along the lines of "Too bad he's not here to stop me, then." or "The dead don't care what we do", though it can also be along the lines of "not doing this got them killed". The "avenge the dead (whether they would have wanted it or not)" option is particularly popular with anti-heroes, and in extreme cases may become a point of no return.

Related to Morality Chain, with the memory of the deceased taking that role in place of a living companion. Also related to What You Are in the Dark: realizing what the deceased would think of your actions (or perhaps believing that the deceased is watching from the afterlife) provides extra pressure to pass the test (or extra angst after failing).

Compare What Would X Do? (where X usually isn't a deceased friend, and the problem is usually practical rather than emotional or moral), Due to the Dead (giving the deceased a respectful funeral and proper mourning), Last Request (where the deceased specifically states a final wish), and Spirit Advisor (where the deceased personally advise the living). Contrast with The Dark Side Will Make You Forget.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Naruto_: Itachi took great measures to act like this for his younger brother Sasuke. First, he grants him the power of Amaterasu, setting it to go off upon encountering Tobi (who knows the Awful Truth about why Itachi murdered their entire clan). He also implanted a crow inside Naruto that had Shisui's eye, which was meant to give the hypnotic command "Protect Konoha" to Sasuke, assuming that he'd taken Itachi's eyes to avoid going blind from overusing the Mangekyou. Sadly, it's averted; despite knowing full well that his brother wanted their homeland to be protected, Sasuke instead swore to go on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge and _wipe out_ Konoha and everyone living there. True, he ultimately gets better, but it's not because of anything Itachi said or did; even when his resurrected brother gets one last chance to talk with him, Sasuke completely dismisses his wishes. Even after the four previous Hokage talk him down, Sasuke simply switches goals towards uniting the world through fear of his wrath. Everything Itachi did to try and put him on a better path would've been All for Nothing if Naruto wasn't so stubborn about saving Sasuke by _being his friend_ instead.

    Comic Books 

-   _My Little Pony (2022)_: Fluttershy is shown to have this effect on Discord in the first comic arc. Many centuries after Fluttershy had passed on, Discord — witnessing the collapse of Equestria thanks to Opaline stowing division among ponies because of their different types of magic — begins to see magic as the source of Equestria's problems and should be destroyed to preserve harmony, which he believes Fluttershy would have wanted. This belief is challenged in issue 10 when he's shown Fluttershy's message she recorded for him, reminding him that ponies' different kinds of magic should be _embraced_ because they let every pony be their most authentic selves and make the world a better place. Heartbroken, Discord gives up on his quest to destroy magic, and the new generation of ponies promise they'll help him bring back the harmony he and Fluttershy want for Equestria.
    
    **Fluttershy:** Lead with your heart, Discord. It will always show you the way.
    
-   _Spider-Man_: This is typically Spider-Man's raison d'etre for being a hero, especially when his personal life is going poorly, the bills are adding up, and he feels the temptation to use his powers for personal gain: he'll inevitably remember his Uncle Ben's words and choose to do the right thing, no matter _how_ much it harms him pragmatically.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In _The Death of Superman_, Batman catches a terrorist trying to assassinate one of the visiting dignitaries at Superman's funeral. Out of respect for the deceased, he forgoes his usual harsh approach.
    -   Depending on the continuity, Ma and Pa Kent are this to Superman. Anytime where the current canon has one or both of them deceased, their memory and the fact that they were very good parents keep Clark on the straight and narrow, which is a good thing considering how powerful he is, and there have been more than a few non-canon stories about what would happen if he let go of his fetters.
    -   In _The Hunt for Reactron_, Supergirl feels greatly tempted to stand aside and let Flamebird kill her father's murderer; but she talks Flamebird down because her father Zor-El would want justice, not revenge.
        
        **Supergirl:** No, don't! Don't kill him!  
        **Flamebird:** This is the creature who murdered your father, Kara Zor-El.  
        **Supergirl:** Yes, he did. And countless others besides. But my father would want justice, not vengeance. Thara... Flamebird... Spare him, and I will take him home, to answer for his crimes.
        
-   _Ultimatum_: Magneto uses his powers to alter the Earth's axis, causing widespread devastation and natural disasters across the world. On top of that, he also confronts Professor Xavier and snaps his neck. When confronted and forced to restore the planet's axis, Magneto pleads for forgiveness from the X-Men, stating Charles would have done so. In response, Cyclops spitefully reminds him that he killed Professor X, and with him gone, no one will _ever_ forgive Magneto before blasting his head off with his Eye Beams.

    Fan Works 

-   In _All Mixed Up!_, Oscar invokes this trope in order to snap Otto out of a Heroic BSoD, which he goes into after finding out that Olive has been attacked and anagrammed by Mariana Mag. The Scientist tells him that they should bring Olive back to Precinct 13579's Headquarters before going to Mariana Mag's aquarium to warn Oprah and the other agents, stating that it's what Olive would have wanted them to do. It takes great effort, but Otto manages to regain himself and follows Oscar's lead.
-   _Born in Fiendfyre_ has this happen (albeit downplayed) to _Bellatrix Lestrange_, of all people. While she was still a Death Eater here, her loyalty to Voldemort was destroyed entirely when he murdered her Best Friend Margaret Lefay with a curse, to the point she willingly left the Death Eaters and helped Snape in his (semi-failed) plot to kill Voldemort, before taking up a position as Harry Dresden's godmother (she's also a Composite Character with the Leanansidhe here, which is still probably an improvement over her canon self).
-   Played With in a sidestory of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_. A Serial Killer known as the Bloodliner Hunter is on a killing spree, seeking out bloodliners (even children) to exterminate them, believing that they will cause a war that will destroy the world in the future. During the sidestory, he's confronted by what _could be_ the ghost of his adopted daughter, who is trying (but failing) to dissuade him from this dark path. Given that said girl was Killed Off for Real in a previous sidestory (but he doesn't know that), it's not clear whether it's a figment of his imagination, or a ghost that only he can see and hear.
-   In _A Scotsman in Egypt_, the Scottish commander of an Egyptian fort is killed in battle, and a soldier says that he would have wanted to be buried there (The narration makes it very clear he hated the assignment, the climate, the people, and wanted nothing more than to go back home to Scotland, though apparently, he put his duty first so no one realized).

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Big Hero 6_, Baymax asks Hiro if killing Yokai would have been what Tadashi would have wanted. Later, Hiro asks the same thing to Yokai about Abigail.
-   _Coco_: The hate for music that runs in the family originated with Mamá Imelda, the head of the family from four generations ago. Apparently, she could not only hold a grudge her entire life, it keeps scaring her children and grandchildren into doing the same long after she's gone.
-   _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_: After Simba banishes Kovu, Kiara tells him "YOU WILL NEVER BE MUFASA!"
-   _The Little Mermaid III: Ariel's Beginning_: After King Triton has Sebastian and his band imprisoned, Ariel drops this to make him reconsider his ban on music.
    
    **Ariel:** I may not remember my mother... but I know she wouldn't have wanted _this!_
    

    Films — Live-Action

    **Rachel:** Your father would be ashamed of you.
    
-   In _The Dark Knight Rises_, the legacy of Harvey Dent provides a powerful impetus to clean up Gotham City in the years since the events of _The Dark Knight_. It is subverted when Bane publicly reveals that it was based on a whitewashing of what really happened to Dent.
-   This is explicitly addressed during the cemetery scene where Lee swears vengeance for Su Lin in _Enter the Dragon_:
    
    **Lee:** You will not agree with what I'm going to do. It is contrary to all that you have taught me, and all that Su Lin believed. I must leave. Please try to find a way to forgive me.
    
-   Two unusual examples in _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_, one for each of the titular heroes.
    -   For Superman, who is faced with the possibility that he was never a "real" hero because of all the death and destruction that follows wherever he goes, a conversation with his dead father reminds him that there will always be unintended consequences and that he shouldn't allow that to stand in the way of the "dream of some farmer from Kansas".
    -   In Batman's case, he's sacrificed his moral code for what he believes to be the greater good of preventing a possible future where Superman destroys and/or takes over the world. During his fight with the Man of Steel, though, he's reminded that the reason he became a hero in the first place was to save lives, not to take them, by way of Superman accidentally invoking the memory of Batman's dead mother.
-   _Pitch (2009)_: Just before Gene would have shot his wife and her lover, Jim brings up an image of Gene's mom, who pleads with him to stop and to remember her, which finally convinces him to put down the gun and walk away.

    Literature 

-   _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ reveals that Lily Evans Potter was this for Severus Snape throughout the series. Snape was a loyal Death Eater and follower of Voldemort, and he was a natural fit for the Dark Arts—that is, until Voldemort murdered Lily, the love of Severus' life, even after Lily rejected him and married James Potter. Snape winds up as Dumbledore's most valued agent, risking his life for years and eventually being killed, all for love of Lily.
-   In _Kaze no Stigma_, when Kazuma encounters the group that killed his beloved Cui Ling several years ago, he promptly goes from 'Anti-Hero' to 'Villain Protagonist', restarting the Roaring Rampage of Revenge that originally earned him the nickname 'Reaper of the Winds'. After finding out the backstory, Ayano confronts him and tells him that she wouldn't have wanted him to act like that. His response is to basically shrug and say "I know that, but she's dead, so she doesn't feel a thing. Meanwhile, I'M enjoying it."

-   _Spock's World_: Invoked by McCoy, who asks what Surak, the "Father of All that Vulcan Became", would think about the secession movement and the damage it's causing. In his conclusion, he rams it home by saying that Surak would be disappointed in them if their pride and fear caused the race to self-destruct.
-   _Scarlett_ legitimately tries to be a better person than she was in the previous book after the death of Melanie Wilkes, who she failed to appreciate as a friend until she was on her deathbed, even knocking herself out to be a good friend to a young woman who's her Suspiciously Similar Substitute.

    Live-Action TV

    **Stark:** You were gonna shoot me out of the sky?!  
    **Jarvis:** Well, I thought that was what you would have wanted.  
    **Stark:** No! No, it's not. And for future reference, under _no circumstance_ would I want anyone to shoot or otherwise hurt me. You got that?  
    **Jarvis:** Your point is amply made, sir.
