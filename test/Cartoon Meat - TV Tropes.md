Your favorite types of meat, according to the Windows 10 emoji collection. Clockwise from top left: a ribeye steak, a chicken drumstick, some bacon strips, and a cylindrical mystery meat on a bone.

Meat is animal flesh often eaten for protein (or convenience if there's nothing else hanging around), though most kinds of meat hold textures and traits that make it rather unnecessarily complicated and ambiguous.

This is where the "Cartoon" part comes to the spotlight.

Depictions of meat in comics and animation are often stylized and simplified, both for the convenience of the artist and ease of recognition for the audience. These simplified versions tend to follow specific trends:

-   **Manga meat**, or **ano niku** (Japanese for "that meat"): Generic meat from an unspecified source (possibly the shank), portrayed as a roughly cylindrical slab still attached to the bone, with said bone sticking out both ends to serve as a convenient handle while eating. The meat itself is very chewy, sometimes even stretchy. In spite of the name, this version does pop up in western works, too — sometimes with just one bone, so it looks more like a giant drumstick.
-   **Poultry** is either drumsticks or a whole roasted bird. Drumsticks may be simplified to the point that they look like a meat popsicle. Breasts are rarely seen, despite being among the most common cuts in real life; wings haven't appeared until recently, and are often depicted as smaller drumsticks.
    -   Turkey is usually drawn as an oversized wholly roasted bird, but wearing identifying paper frills on the drumsticks. Much like other portrayed poultry, the part which is most commonly depicted is the drumsticks.
    -   In Japanese media, chicken drumsticks are usually decorated with festive ribbons, owing to the adoption of fried chicken as a traditional Christmas dinner.
-   **Beef** can show up as steak or hamburger patties:
    -   Steaks are either ribeye or T-bone because apparently steak isn't steak without some sort of bone in the middle. The meat may be colored bright red, even if it's supposed to be fully cooked.
    -   Hamburger patties are usually dark brown, regardless of whether they're cooked rare or well-done.
-   **Lamb**: Only rib chops (usually with the long rib bones left on) or crown rib roast.
-   **Pork** has the most variety and can appear in several forms:
    -   Ham will usually be drawn as a giant drumstick cut in half, with the insides a bright pink.
    -   Bacon is almost always depicted as side bacon (aka streaky bacon) since it can be simplified to alternating stripes of red (meat) and white (fat).
    -   Sausages are usually less than 6 inches in length, linked, and colored gray, brown, red, or any combo thereof.
    -   Hotdogs are slightly longer and are usually colored pink or red. When served as part of a Japanese schoolkid's lunch, hotdogs are often cut into a fun octopus shape, called "tako-san wieners."
    -   Pork chops are typically center cut (solid piece with fat only on the outside) but sometimes have a round bone in the middle, making them a strange cross between center cut chops and arm chops or ham steaks.
    -   Or a whole roasted suckling pig with an apple in its mouth.
-   **Ribs** (pork or beef, or possibly something more exotic) are a slab of brown meat, either flat or an exaggerated curve, with bones sticking out every few inches.
-   **Fish and seafood**:
    -   Fish can be depicted as a cooked whole fish, half-fish filets, or in slices. Whole fish may be drawn in much more realistic detail than the rest of a series. Tuna and salmon are the most common, and the meat is usually pink (salmon pink, naturally). Herring will also appear as kippers, though drawn as resembling whole raw fish rather than cooked fish cut in butterfly fashion.
    -   Fish skeletons — sometimes with an intact head and tail fins attached to a spine that's been otherwise picked clean — are a popular meal for cats, raccoons, or anyone who has to dumpster-dive for food.
    -   Lobsters and shrimp are often colored bright red, even before they're cooked.
    -   Similarly, Japanese media tend to depict octopuses as red and squids as white, even before they're cooked.

Bones that stick out from Cartoon Meat are most likely to look like Stock Femur Bones unless the meat is fish or ribs, where they're more likely to be rib bones.

A Sub-Trope of Stock Food Depictions. Compare with Cartoon Cheese, which is its counterpart for, well, cheese, and Every Pizza Is Pepperoni for its pizza counterpart. In video games, this often goes hand-in-hand with Hyperactive Metabolism and Inexplicably Preserved Dungeon Meat. For extremely detailed depictions of meat, see Food Porn.

    Video Games

    -   _Cookie Run Kingdom_ represents energy as a red jelly bean skewered with a bone, resembling manga meat.

-   _Don't Starve_:
    -   The basic meat item takes the form of brown drumstick-shaped shanks, with a femur head at the narrow end and the wide end chopped through to reveal red and white marbled meat. Most other meats are variants on this theme — monster meat is black and purple instead of brown and red, fish meat is a fish with its front end chopped off to imitate this look, and leafy meat is a growth of plant tissue imitating a meaty shank, with leaves instead of the bone and marbled green... something instead of muscle and fat.
    -   Morsels resemble miniature Manga Meat, with a small ring of marbled flesh around a thin bone sticking out of both ends.

The plates of steak seen in _Forgotten Land_ actually avert this, being clearly cooked rare and without a bone as you might expect.
-   _The Legend of Zelda:_
    -   _The Legend of Zelda_: The Monster Bait item takes the form of stock manga meat. Its advertised purpose of distracting baddies isn't terribly useful (only the weaker ones seem to go for it), but you still have to buy the stuff as it's also a Plot Coupon in disguise that you have to trade to progress through the game.

    -   _Breath of the Wild_ and _Tears of the Kingdom_:
        -   The rock-based manga meat reappears, here called "Rock Roasts". This time, Gorons prefer to grill them before eating. (Link apparently tried one of these in the past and enjoyed it.)
        -   The game also has regular and "prime" meat (classic steak slabs with a strip of fat around them, of varying thickness), drumsticks and bird thighs, "gourmet" meat (stocky manga meat) and whole birds.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   In _Shovel Knight_, one of the health-restoring items is a rather cartoonish turkey.
-   _Spyro: Year of the Dragon:_ In the Sunny Villa level, there are many Rhynoc Giant Mooks that wield giant chicken drumsticks; they all look the same. Near the end of the level, there's a cutscene of one of said mooks chasing a giant chicken, and when you get to where they run off to, said giant Rhynoc is already wielding a drumstick.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story_: During the game's "Fantastic Voyage" Plot, one of the areas the Mario brothers end up in is the Flab Zone, implied to be the rather heavyset Bowser's overlarge deposits of fat. The most common low-level enemies there are the tenderlings, which resemble cylindrical joints of meat with the head of a Stock Femur Bone sticking out at either end, in addition to eyes and feet.
    -   _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ features cylindrical bits of mystery meat in Bowser's platforming minigames that function as his equivalent to Mario's Super Mushrooms.

    -   In _Super Mario Galaxy_, the level "A Very Spooky Sprint" in the Ghostly Galaxy is a race through the sky against a Boo. Huge flying pieces of manga meat are obstacles, which bounce Mario backwards if he hits them.
-   _Team Fortress 2_: _Don't Starve_'s ham bat was ported to _TF2_ under the name "The Ham Shank", with Genuine quality ones being awarded to those who preordered the source material. It's very much the same design, only 3D-modeled.
