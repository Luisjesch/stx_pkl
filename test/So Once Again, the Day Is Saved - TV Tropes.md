A formulaic speech or narration similar to the Opening Narration, placed at the end of every episode of a show to (as close as we can tell) make sure the audience hasn't forgotten what they're watching. It may recap the basic premise of the show, but will not pay more than a token nod to the actual specifics of the episode (unlike, say, a Fauxlosophic Narration). For full credit, the sentence should end with a Title Drop.

Almost exclusive to kid's shows, though it seems to have made a foray into more mature series for a brief period around 1980.

A Sub-Trope of Every Episode Ending.

Compare Signing-Off Catchphrase. Can overlap with Script Wank when used to spell out An Aesop.

    Anime & Manga 

-   A lot of anime in the golden age (70's) have this along with the opening narration. Usually, the narrator would say something regarding the plot's conclusion, and always close with the catchphrase of the anime (e.g. And so, the _Yatterman_ have prevented the Dokuro-stone from being retrieved by the evil Doronbo gang. As long as Yatterman is here, there is nothing to fear! Yatta! Yatta! Yatterman!)
-   _Pokémon: The Series_ almost always ends each episode with the narrator making some comment along the lines of "Once again, the day is saved by our heroes. But will \[insert generally silly question or occasional reference to troubling plotline here\]?"
-   _Voltron_ ended every episode with Keith delivering a line pointing out that evil will always be vanquished by **Voltron, Defender of the Universe!**
-   _Gigantor_ always ended with the narrator explaining that, "And Gigantor flies off to his next adventure!"
-   _Star Blazers_: "Hurry, Star Force! Earth has only (insert number of) days left!"
-   Subverted in _Mahoromatic_: At the end of each episode is a countdown of how many days until Mahoro ceases to function.
-   Every episode of _Hamtaro_ would end with Hamtaro's owner Laura reflecting on what she experienced over the course of the episode. She then says to Hamtaro "Today was a great day. And I bet tomorrow will be even better!" to which Hamtaro responds with the sound effect "Heke!".

    Comic Strips 

-   Lee Falk's Newspaper Comics _Mandrake the Magician_ and _The Phantom_ frequently ended their story arcs with "Next: New Adventure!"

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _¡Three Amigos!_: Both the movie itself and the silent films for which the Three Amigos were famous ended with the Amigos announcing, "Wherever there is injustice, you will find us. Wherever there is suffering, we'll be there. Wherever liberty is threatened, you will find The Three Amigos!"
-   _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_: The TOS crew has saved the Federation so many times that they can joke about it:
    
    **Kirk:** Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.  
    **McCoy:** And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute!
    
-   Two in _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_. One as Raoul Duke drops Dr. Gonzo off for his flight home, and a second as he himself drives off towards the sunset:
    
    There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live and too rare to die.  
    There was only one road back to LA; US Interstate 15. Just a flat out high speed burn through Baker and Barstow and Berdoo. Then onto the Hollywood Freeway and straight on into frantic oblivion. Safety. Obscurity. Just another freak in the freak kingdom.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   The first season of _Knight Rider_ ended each episode with a narrator recapping the premise: "Michael Knight: Lone crusader in a dangerous world — the world of the Knight Rider."
-   _Battlestar Galactica (1978)_, for half-credit, ended each episode with a speech about Galactica's quest for "A shining planet known as Earth."
-   "Who was that masked man?" "That was The Lone Ranger."
-   The Bubble-Wrap man sketches on _Skithouse_ always ended with the line "Who was that man, covered in bubble-wrap?" "Bubble-wrap Maaan!"
-   _Batman (1966)_: The narrator makes a punny description of the cliffhanger or conclusion of the story, then tells the viewer to tune in for the next episode, "Same bat-time! Same bat-channel!"
-   Parodied in a few _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ sketches, using the line: "It's all in a day's work for..."
-   For that is how things happen "...in _The Twilight Zone_."
-   _Scrubs_: \[adenoidal voice\] "In a hospital, you \[deal with moral dilemma / develop relationships in some manner / sometimes feel upset\]"
-   _The Daily Show_: "And now, here it is. Your moment of zen." \[Strange clip from news and/or politics.\]
-   Ceri ends off every episode of _Llan-ar-goll-en_ with saying "That's how we solved the mystery of the lost/missing X!"

    Webcomics 

-   In deliberate homage to Lee Falk, _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ also frequently ends its storylines with "Next: New Adventure!"
-   In _Everyday Heroes_, Mr. Mighty tried this once when coming home. It didn't work, as his wife was having a bad day.

    Western Animation 

-   The line (and the respective moment) from _¡Three Amigos!_ was parodied in _Animaniacs_:
    
    **Yakko:** Wherever there is belching, we'll be there! Wherever there is stupidity, we'll be there! Wherever there is candy...  
    **Wakko:** We'll be there a _lot_ quicker!
    
-   _The Powerpuff Girls_ also had its narrator end each episode with the relevant speech. It eventually became a Mad Libs Catch Phrase, being periodically subverted when the day had been saved by someone else (The Amoeba Boys, Mojo Jojo, The People of Townsville, Ben Franklin), and at least once when the day wasn't ever in any real danger. ("And so...um...hmm. Yeah.").
    -   The first instance of changing the ending was in "Boogie Frights", which had the girls asleep in bed onscreen, and the Narrator talking about how they had literally saved the day since the villain's plan had been to make it permanently night by blocking out the sun. Eventually, Blossom and Buttercup have to shush the Narrator, as they can't sleep with him talking; Bubbles, however, manages to stay out like a light.
    -   In The Movie, the narrator couldn't say "once again" because this is an origin story, so he says "for the very first time" instead.
    -   Inverted when the Rowdyruff boys vow to destroy the girls at the end of "Custody Battle" (an episode the Girls themselves don't appear in) and the ending title is replaced with a skull-and-bones with the narration "And once again, the day is doomed, thanks to... the Rowdyruff Boys."
    -   Subverted in "The Headsucker's Moxy". The narrator tries to say the line, but due to being a victim of the Robbing Leech, he forgets what is being presented due to a headache. The girls and "the end" never appear.
    -   In one episode, the narrator points out that the girls saved the day, but they were the ones who started the trouble in the first place.
    -   Then there was the Tear Jerker variation in "Twisted Sister" when the girls' homely fourth sister (whom they created to give themselves a break after an extremely busy week) sacrificed herself to save the girls before exploding due to being unstable. The music was melodramatic and the narrator was crying as he mentioned how Bunny saved the day for the first... and last time.
    -   "Fallen Arches" has the girls standing by and doing nothing during a crime wave committed by a gang of elderly supervillains because of Blossom's misguided ideas of "respecting our elders". They convince a pair of elderly superheroes to fight the bad guys instead, but all the old men end up horribly injuring themselves and getting rushed to the hospital. The episode ends with the observation that "none of this would have happened if the Powerpuff Girls would had just saved the day!"
    -   In "Him Diddle Riddle" The narrator is just as confused as the girls about what the episode was really about the whole time, and can't bother to finish saying the line. There isn't even any music played at all.
    -   In "Keen on Keane", Professor Utonium and Miss Keane fall in love and end up holding up the Mayor's hotline. He eventually interrupts them with a sneeze, and they realize that they're neglecting their duties. Ms. Keane then mentions her cat, unwittingly causing an argument between them (the Professor had a bad experience with a cat in the episode "Cat Man Do") that ruins their relationship. The episode ends with the narrator announcing that the day was saved by "...Ms. Keane's cat, I guess. Nice Valentino."
    -   At the end of the episode "A Made Up Story", Blossom was bragging that she never fell victim to Mask Scara's Uncanny Valley Makeup when she trips and causes sequential accidents that give her a ridiculous appearance, leaving her at the mercy of The Freelance Shame Squad and causing the narrator to try to say the usual line amidst his own laughter.
    -   "Nano of the North" ends with the narrator announcing the day was saved by the shrunken girls, who appear tiny along with a squeaky voice. The "the end" title appears tiny as well.
    -   "Stray Bullet" has the outro presented in squirrel language and Bullet being hailed instead of the girls.
    -   "Simian Says" has Mojo kidnap the Narrator and use his role to try to deal with the Girls. After he’s been taken out and the Girls save the Narrator, he closes out the episode and has the Girls give him a ride home.
    -   And since it involves the Powerpuff Girls, the crossover with _Teen Titans Go!_ ended with this trope... except the narrator takes one last potshot at the Titans.

-   _Rocky and Bullwinkle_ episodes usually end with a cliffhanger followed by a punny Either/Or Title. Example: "We'll find out next time in 'Boris Bounces Back' or 'The Rubber Heel'." If the episode was the end of an arc, the narrator would announce, "Be with us next time for another amazing adventure with Rocky the Flying Squirrel!" "...and his pal Bullwinkle."
    
    **Bullwinkle**: Hooray! Hey, that's me!
    
-   _Roger Ramjet_ episodes always ended with a "So once again the free world is safe" speech from the Deadpan Snarker narrator, with the snark turned up to eleven if the villains' nefarious plan wasn't very nefarious or Roger Ramjet didn't actually help very much.
-   "Another exciting case solved by... _The Problem Solverz_!"
-   _Saturday Supercade_ had this with its _Donkey Kong_ segments, typically with Mario giving the first part:
    
    **Mario:** It's not easy when you're dealing with...
    
    **Donkey Kong:** DOOOOOONKEY KOOOOOONG!
    
-   _The Tick_ delivers a hilariously incoherent version of this speech at the end of each episode.
-   _Bugs Bunny_ in "Hair-Raising Hare": "Aaaaaaaaaand so, having redisposed of the monster, exit our hero stage right..."
-   The closing credits of every episode of _Inspector Gadget_ end with a voice-over from Dr. Claw, saying "I'll get you next time, Gadget! Next... time...".
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   The first few seasons ended episodes with Twilight Sparkle (and later on, other members of the Mane Six) writing a letter to Twilight's mentor Princess Celestia spelling out the moral of the story.
    -   "Power Ponies" has Spike giving this out word for word, but the group gets sucked out of the comic before he can finish.
-   "Homer the Moe", a Season 13 episode of _The Simpsons_ showcases Moe the bartender expressing his overall dissatisfaction with his life and career to his bar regulars with this quote: "I am sick of you drunks and your shaggy dog stories!" The very beginning of the episode is Homer sharing an example of this trope.
