_Let me tell you about my buddy,  
He's 3,000 years old,  
He's wrapped in bandages and covered in moldy debris  
My undead mummy and me._

Not unlike their fellow undead brethren, mummies are commonly depicted as evil, malicious, or just plain scary. This is especially the case if they were a Nepharious Pharaoh in life. However, this isn't true for all mummies.

Despite being shambling corpses with eerie glowing eyes and covered in aging bandages, some mummies are benign and harmless. Depending on the work, a mummy of this nature may even be downright jovial or outright heroic. Why a particular mummy, or mummies, acts friendly varies. Some were quite sociable in life and remain so in (un)death, while others started out mean in life but mellowed out after their death and mummification. While still overall rarer than other fun and helpful undead characters, it's become more common to see relatively harmless mummies in fiction.

A Sub-Trope of Mummy and can overlap with Seductive Mummy if the mummy in question is also female. Compare Friendly Ghost, Friendly Neighborhood Vampire, Friendly Skeleton, Friendly Zombie, and Wonderful Werewolf.

    Comic Books 

-   _The DCU_: The heroic Creature Commandos have occasionally had a mummy on their team.
-   _Empowered_: Yummy Mummy plays with this trope. She is technically a heroic character, but like many of the Superhomeys, she's not exactly the epitome of selflessness. She has friends, but they come off as a _Mean Girls_\-style clique.
-   _Magic Trixie_: Nefi, one of Trixie's Cute Monster Girl friends, is a little girl mummy. Magic Trixie sleeps over at her home in "Magic Trixie Sleeps Over" and discovers she has servants who carry her everywhere and even eat food for her while she experiences the tastes.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec_: Adèle's main goal is to find the mummy Patmosis, who she believes to be Rameses II's medical doctor, and have Professor Espérandieu revive Patmosis so that the doctor can help cure her lobotomized sister. Though he turns out to be a nuclear physicist and thus is unable to help Adèle, Professor Espérandieu's ritual is so strong that when it revived Patmosis, it ALSO activated ALL the mummies in the Louvre. Adèle therefore seeks them out in order to find the real doctor to help her sister. They eventually decide to see the sights of Paris.
-   _Night at the Museum_: A mummy's magic stone tablet brings all the statues and other displays to life at night. The mummy himself is assumed to be evil because everyone knows mummies are evil, plus the fact that he was banging on the sarcophagus cover and moaning. Turns out he's actually a really Nice Guy who just wants to be let out of his sarcophagus. His tablet's magic also kept him looking like a living Egyptian man (Rami Malek, in fact) rather than a rotting ghoul.
-   In the Disney Channel original movie _Under Wraps (1997)_, the mummy is actually non-threatening and friendly towards the kids that befriend him.

    Literature 

-   _Dr. Greta Helsing_: Behind the Masquerade, mummies tend to have ordinary jobs in fields that let them avoid the public. Greta meets one at a supernatural health spa and quickly befriends him over their shared interest in medicine, though he does indulge in some comedic lurching when a Muggle gets in and sees him.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: There are Ka, really powerful mummies that are not hostiles and can even be convinced to help the players if they have the proper offerings.
-   _GURPS_: An illustration in _Undead_ featured two humans (a man and a woman), a mummy, and a vampire as an investigative team.

A _newly awakened_ mummy is near-mindless, superpowered monstrosity driven to protect its tomb by any means.

-   _The Secret World_: The "Black Sun, Red Sand" story arc introduces Säid, an ancient Egyptian prince living it up in the modern world as a businessman, and though he prefers £12000 suits to bandages, he's still clearly a mummified corpse. While undoubtedly a hedonist and a mercenary at heart, Säid is on your side throughout the conflict in Egypt - as are the Kingdom, the crime syndicate of resurrected mummies that he represents. Plus, he's quite charming and a lot more honorable than he's prepared to admit.

Molezuma, the Aztec mummy that features in that episode is dangerous and unfriendly, but really all he wants is his sacred treasure back. The real villain is the Phantom Thief who stole it.
