Only two more seasons until they're back on the bus again.

_"After months and months of rumors, flat-out denials, and almost certainly some begging by the producers, Michael Rosenbaum has agreed to reprise his role as Lex Luthor for the series finale of_ Smallville_. When asked why he finally relented after refusing to return for so long, the actor explained that someone reminded him he was Michael fucking Rosenbaum, and what the fuck else did he have going on."_

After a main character gets written out of a story (either explicitly or with no explanation), we often never see them again. This trope is about when they return once again, to work with the current main characters.

This works several ways: we may get to find out what they've been up to, and then they go back to whatever it was; or it's used as a way to advance their character development even though they're no longer on the show.

So what happens next? Sometimes (particularly in live-action media where shooting schedules and prior commitments can keep an actor from returning full-time), at the end of the episode, the character ends up on a different, longer bus. In other cases, the character in question returns for good and resumes their major role. This can happen when the character's been an Ensemble Dark Horse and the authors are either trying to fix the removal that was controversial in the first place, or simply attempt to win some favors from the fans. In this case, the character has all the chances to turn into a Spotlight-Stealing Squad.

It might be that it's a show with a lot of characters and this particular one was simply Out of Focus, if maybe a bit too long. It may also occur when an actor recovers from an illness, finishes work elsewhere or when legal issues are resolved. Actresses who go on maternity leave may have their characters written out of a story only to be written back in once the actresses are ready to return.

Often The Bus Came Back is invoked as part of Gondor Calls for Aid, where the main characters bring characters back from the bus to help in a dire situation. Sometimes this even involves bringing back former villains to fight against the current Big Bad, because Even Evil Has Standards. If the returning character suddenly has a new personality or a new actor from the one showcased before, it's respectively either a case of Not as You Know Them or The Other Darrin.

Compare with Commuting on a Bus, where a former major character turns into a _recurring_ guest character (regularly getting on and off a bus). If the character takes the bus and returns in the very same episode (or, despite his plans, never manage to actually take the bus), then he was simply With a Foot on the Bus. Back for the Dead, which is the subtrope where the character dies at the end of the return episode; and Back for the Finale, where a character returns expressly for a show's final episode. Also compare Plot Archaeology, when this trope is applied to an entire story arc. If, on the other hand, a character _never_ comes back even though it'd be easy for the character to return for at least one episode, then it's a Long Bus Trip.

**There is a minimum time gap for any examples where the character wasn't explicitly written out**. To qualify for the trope, they require an absence of one season for episodic works with seasons, one year for episodic works without seasons, or two sequels for non-episodic works. There's no such waiting period for characters who return after being explicitly Put on a Bus.

Not to be mixed up with He's Back!, which is when a mainstay character recovers from a personal crisis.

    -   Technically Snart’s cold gun, considering that we last saw it being disassembled by Ray to use its components to disable a bomb; also applies to Mjolnir, which is restored by Thanos on Hela's request (even if it's subsequently picked up by Jane because Hela didn't know about the worthiness enchantment).

    Literature 

-   _The Beginning After the End_:
    -   Volume 4: After having not seen her since his childhood in Elenoir back in Volume 1, Arthur meets with Rinia Darcassian, who ends up telling him hints about his future and the coming crisis.
    -   Volume 6: At the start of the volume, Arthur is brought face to face with Uto, the Retainer who killed Alea Triscan in Widow's Crypt at the end of Volume 3. Sebastian, the former Court Conjurer of the Glayders who coveted Arthur's bond Sylvie during the 10th Annual Helstea Auctions in Volume 2, makes a reappearance in Arthur's birthplace of Ashber where he is shown to have become a slave trader since being stripped of his position. He ends up being a case of Back for the Dead as he gets killed not long afterwards. Claire Bladeheart is revealed to have survived her injuries from the attack on Xyrus Academy two volumes ago, though at the cost of losing her mana core which has been why she has been living in seclusion away from the war.
    -   Volume 7: After having been missing since he was taken by the Vritra back to Alacrya during the attack on Xyrus Academy three volumes ago, Elijah Knight makes his return at the end of the volume having been seemingly Reforged into a Minion by the Vritra. As Arthur finds out, this is not exactly the case. Elijah is in fact Nico Sever, the Evil Former Friend of Arthur's past life King Grey, and has been willingly working with Agrona and the Vritra to exact revenge on Grey for the apparent murder his fiancée (and their shared Childhood Friend Love Interest) Cecilia in their past lives. Before Elijah/Nico's return, Arthur comes face to face with Cadell, the Scythe who killed Sylvia back in Volume 1, during the attack on the Council Castle.
    -   Volume 9: Taci, the young Asura whom Arthur sparred with during his time in Epheotus, makes a return. His return is significant as he is not only chosen to be the inheritor of the World Eater technique that destroyed Elenoir, but as a Rite of Passage to prove he is worthy of inheriting said technique, he gets sent to slaughter the Dicathian resistance at the end of the volume when Kezess deems that they have outlived their usefulness to him. He ends up being killed by Arthur once he returns from the Victoriad. In addition, Feyrith Ivsaar III, who has not been seen since the attack on Xyrus, makes a return. He unfortunately ends up being a case of Back for the Dead as the following volume reveals he was one of the casualties of Taci's rampage.
    -   Volume 10: Quite a few characters return to the story in this volume. After having not been seen since Volume 5, Kordri appears in Indrath's great hall to hears about Taci's death then Wren Kain IV makes a reappearance wherein he joins Aldir in defecting from Epheotus. Following up on this, Avier, the late Cynthia Goodsky's bond who had not been seen since the attack on Xyrus, makes a sudden reappearance near the end of the novel to establish contact between Arthur and the Hearth, the hidden enclave of the Lost Prince Mordain wherein Aldir and Wren have found refuge in since leaving Epheotus. This culminates in Arthur finally being able to bring back Sylvie after her Heroic Sacrifice at the very end of Volume 7. Kaspian Bladeheart, who had not been seen since Volume 2, makes a reappearance when Arthur retakes Blackbend. His reappearance is followed by that of Vincent and Lilia Helstea and Vanesy Glory when Arthur retakes Xyrus. Lastly, Lyra Dreide, the Retainer who paraded the corpses of Dicathen's kings and queens at the end of Volume 7 to mark the end of Agrona's conquest, makes a reappearance when Arthur retakes Etisin as she surrenders herself and the remaining Alacryan forces on Dicathen to him. On a more minor note, Draneeve, the leader of the Radicals, is revealed to have been Reassigned to Antarctica since the attack on Xyrus as punishment for inadvertently endangering Agrona's plans with the Legacy.

    -   Then there's Eskarina Smith. Admittedly she belongs in the earlier stranger parts like Twoflower, but it took her 23 years to return, and about 34 books.

-   The AI Iona, one of _Halo: Blood Line_'s stars, was seemingly forgotten after the comic ended with a Bolivian Army Ending. It took five years before she appeared in _Halo_ media again, in _Halo: Saint's Testimony_, which centers around Iona attempting to convince the UNSC to not terminate her despite her impending rampancy.
-   Dame Estelle Matsuko was a main character and ally of Honor Harrington's in the first novel of the series, _On Basilisk Station_. She then virtually vanished from the narrative for a dozen books thereafter; despite being name-checked as the incoming Home Secretary for the Grantville government in _War of Honor_ and having gained a peerage in the meanwhile (becoming _Lady_ Dame Estelle Matsuko, Baroness Medusa), she didn't properly reappear on-page until _The Shadow of Saganami_. As the Imperial Governor of the Talbott Quadrant, she is a major player in the _Saganami Island_ spinoff series (of which _The Shadow of Saganami_ is the first novel).

    -   Tons of examples in _The Penultimate Peril_, including Jerome, Justice Strauss, the teachers from Prufrock Prep School, residents of the Village of Fowl Devotees, Hal (running an Indian restaurant), Sir, and Charles.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: Halfway through _Galaxy of Fear_, the droid DV-9 declared that he was tired of dangerous adventures. On a character level he wasn't really needed anymore, either; mostly he had contrasted with The Stoic Hoole as an adult-figure who was less forbidding around Tash and Zak, and by that point the kids and Hoole had finally come to trust and like each other. DV-9 was freed and went to be a research assistant on Koaan. In the last book the others visit Koaan and he meets them and helps find something they were looking for, but declines to come with them off the planet.
    
    "I am not programmed for philosophy, but I've seen enough to know that you and Tash are in for more excitement than my circuitry can handle. I belong here."

-   _Tortall Universe_: In the _Protector of the Small_ quartet's third book, _Squire_, most of Kel's page friends are scattered all over Tortall with their own knight-masters and she doesn't see them at all. They come back in _Lady Knight_ when they're all posted to the Scanran front.
-   Trixie and Gilda in _Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell_. Less so for Trixie, since she had recently appeared in Season 3, but this is Gilda's first reappearance in _any_ sort of Friendship is Magic\-related media since _Griffon The Brush Off_.
-   In _Warrior Cats_, Graystripe was captured by Twolegs early in the third book of the second series and ultimately presumed dead or permanently lost by his Clanmates.

    Multiple Media 

-   MonsterVerse:
    -   Lee Shaw, a supporting characters from the _Godzilla (2014)_ supplementary prequel graphic novel _Awakening_, is finally set to return in the 2023 TV series _Monarch: Legacy of Monsters_, almost a full decade after the character debuted and was last heard from.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_ had a series of sets focused around the efforts of New Phyrexia to overtake Mirrodin. The set ended with the Mirran resistance's crushing defeat and the final compleation (not a misspelling) of the plane. Then the New Phyrexians went quiet for several real-world years... until the _Kaldheim_ set, where Vorinclex, one of the Praetors of New Phyrexia, revealed his presence on the plane, crushed all who attempted to stop him, and successfully made off with a sample of tyrite, hinting at further manipulations from the New Phyrexians in the future - especially since this incident makes clear _they can cross planes_.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: The Squats were featured very prominently in the first two editions of the game, but were subsequently dropped during the shift to third. Fast forward _thirty years_ to 2018 and they return (albeit in a very limited form) to the Gaiden Game _Necromunda_. Then, in April 2022, they were brought back into the mainline game as the Leagues of Votann.

    Theme Parks 

-   The _Haunted Mansion_ in Disneyland opening day had a denizen called the Hatbox Ghost. Through the use of lighting his face in a certain way, his head would disappear and reappear in the hatbox he carried. He was included front and center in much of the promotional material for the new attraction. However, while the effect worked from a specific angle, the illusion broke down when viewed from most of the angles of the ride. Just a few days after the ride was opened, the Hatbox Ghost was removed. His animatronic was subsequently lost by the staff. Yet, the Hatbox Ghost retained a following for decades afterward. In 2015, the Hatbox Ghost, using modern projection technology, finally returned to the mansion.

-   _Something\*Positive_ begins each year with a week of "Old Familiar Faces," where we get a bunch of one-shot comics dealing with characters who haven't been seen in a long time. Often these include characters like Jhim or Branwen, who used to be major secondary characters, but also a grab-bag of One Shot Characters from years ago who never even got named.
-   The _Girl Genius_ strip for June 12th 2020 features the return of Pix, and subsequently the rest of Master Payne's Circus, last seen back in 2007. In this case, it's not so much that the bus came back, as that Agatha _finally_ made it to where the bus was going.
-   Phillip Kim in _Weak Hero_ is a prominent antagonist throughout Season 1, only to be quickly and firmly beaten by the protagonist at the very start of Season 2. He then disappears almost completely from the story, only to suddenly pop up in Season 3, roughly 100 episodes later, as his business connections prove useful to the Big Bad when he needs to gather information on a rival gang.
