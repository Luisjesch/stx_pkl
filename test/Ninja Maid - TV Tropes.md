_"A maid who works and lives in the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She does a maid's duty perfectly: cooking, cleaning, washing, babysitting, knife throwing, etc."_

A maid (French Maid Outfit often included) who knows kung fu. Many ninja maids _intentionally_ cater to the contrast between the image of a helpless, gentle, obedient Meido and an Action Girl in a frilly uniform jumping off the mansion roof and landing her Mary Jane heels squarely in someone's face.

May or may not develop a Bodyguard Crush on her master, be they male or female. If said master is very young or sickly, she might tend to be their Mama Bear as well.

This trope has some basis in history, as ninja are traditionally known to infiltrate locations by posing as servants.

Common in anime and manga.

Compare Battle Butler, who fulfills the same basic role of "domestic servant with combat skills" but is typically dressed in a suit even if female. Can be related to Super-Powered Robot Meter Maids and McNinja. A Sister Trope to Gratuitous Ninja.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Akame ga Kill!'s prequel, _Akame ga Kill! Zero_, has the the Oarburghs which is an entire organisation of assassins dresssed like maids led by Merraid Oarburgh.
-   The entire concept of _Kamen no Maid Guy_ that feature Kogarashi, a Maid Guy. A monster of a man (in a dress) whose idea of service to his master is very rough around the edges. Has numerous abilities, from cooking & cleaning to USB connectivity and X-ray vision, even claiming to have 37 senses.
    -   Fubuki instead is a classic girl example. She has great skill as a maid and guardian, demonstrating ninja-like abilities; however, despite all of this, she is usually referred to as a "clumsy maid" much to her annoyance.

-   Sayoko Shinozaki from _Code Geass_, whose true badassitude is revealed mid-second season (as shown in the page image). According to the audio commentaries, there was an in-joke among the staff about Sayoko somehow secretly being "the strongest character" during production of the first season, and by the time of R2 the series creators liked the idea enough to make it canon by turning her into a ninja maid. Technically denied by herself. When Rolo calls her a ninja, she corrects him and calls herself an SP - a reference to Japan's Police division dedicated to bodyguard duties, itself heavily based on the American Secret Service. She just happens to have weapons similar to those a ninja would use.
-   An episode of _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ featured a reclusive billionaire (who later turned out to be Dead All Along) with a mansion staffed by gynoid maids with hidden guns that flipped out of their arms. They went down like chumps, though.
-   Fiore from _Chrono Crusade_ doesn't actually know kung fu... but she is a superpowered jewel witch capable of summoning giant crystalline killing machines.

-   _Black Lagoon_ hasa two:
    -   Rosarita "Roberta" Cisneros from isn't so much a Ninja Maid as she is a _Terminator_ Maid. She doesn't just know kung fu — she's _bloody invincible_, and carries enough weaponry in her maid dress to depopulate a small country. Considering that she used to be the infamous "Bloodhound of Florencia", the most dangerous assassin from the FARC, this adds up to a world of pain for anyone who dares mess with her master or his young son. There's also
    -   Her understudy is another ninja maid named Fabiola, who is the personal bodyguard of Garcia Lovelace. Skilled in Capoirea and dual wielding Uzis, she may be younger and not _as_ dark as Roberta but is still NOT to be trifled with.
-   Chisa Yukizome in _Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School_ was a Hope's Peak alum and the former Ultimate Housekeeper. She carried around kitchen knives as both cookware and weapons, seemingly teleported from a student's door to their window to catch them skipping class, and was an expert infiltrator who could easily sneak into places undetected.
-   _Haruhi-chan_:
    -   In this episode, during a movie, Tsuruya decides to fight a monster from said movie, which turns out to be Mori, and then, Mori proceeds to knock out Tsuruya with a HUGE earthquake kick.
    -   In the Christmas episode, Nagato traps the escaping "Santa."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Hanaukyō Maid Team_. Chief Security Maid Konoe Tsurugi is a Comically Serious katana-wielding warrior maid and Taro's personal bodyguard. Her lieutenant Yashima Sana is almost as tough as she is.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   In one episode the then-villainous Evangeline took control of several of the girls' minds, dressed them up like French maids, and then used them to fight Negi, knowing that he wouldn't be able to apply his full power against them. At the time, it seemed like the mind-control had inexplicably given them badass ninja powers, but considering later events, perhaps not...
    -   Chachamaru, Evangeline's Robot Girl servant, also knows kung fu.
-   Maria from _Hayate the Combat Butler_, although outshone by the other Battle Butlers, can more than hold her own in a fight. Maria is usually absent or finds a way to resolve conflict without fighting; it's often implied that she is more capable than Hayate. She also seems opposed to being thought of as a ninja maid.

-   Fumi Himeno from _My-HiME_, complete with a scythe as her Element. Too bad she has an Heroic BSoD after being defeated and losing her powers. But one can presume she got them back after Mashiro used her powers to revive the CHILDs.
-   Media from _Pani Poni Dash!_; She apparently thinks the maid uniform is just part of being someone's assistant.
-   Normally the maid in the ecchi OVA _Labyrinth of Flames_ is a klutzy sickly girl... but if you force the contents of her IV into her arm, she briefly turns into the ultimate ninja.
-   In the first episode of _Najica Blitz Tactics_ the heroine must battle a house full of machinegun-toting, panty-flashing, lesbian maids.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ gives us Hungary. She's not a maid _all_ the time, but still often shows up in a maid's outfit... and is _very_ willing to use her spear and/or her frying pan to defend her master and later husband Austria, as Prussia and France learned the hard way.

-   _Girls Bravo_: Fukuyama has an entire staff of maids, who're all former mercenaries and ex-Special Forces. They regularly patrol the estate equipped with earpieces for communication and they're armed with automatic weapons. Lilica is the head maid and is wholly devoted to serving Fukuyama, whom she refers to as "Young Master". She's also one of the strongest women in the series: enough that she was able to effortlessly curbstomp Kirie!
-   Vizen Bercourt from _Iono the Fanatics_. Not only is she the Head Sobame but she is also officially the most badass one of them all, e.g. able to scare a Professional Killer away just by standing there and smiling politely. Having just smashed said killer into a wall a few seconds earlier with her Dynamic Entry helped.

-   Baby 5 from _One Piece_ is both the maid and an assassin for the Donquixote Family.
-   In the opening episode of _Phantom Of Inferno_, Ein runs around killing people in a French maid outfit.
-   Sandman of _Gravion_ has an enormous medieval castle filled with maids. Some of them pilot Humongous Mecha for him. At least one is a ninja.
-   _Mahoromatic_'s a Robot Girl who depowered herself (as well as drastically shortening her lifespan) solely to become a maid for the male protagonist. She had good reason, though: she killed Suguru's father in the war, and that deeply scarred her, thus she chose to be his Suguru's to make it up to the kid she orphaned.
-   The maid, Mikage in _Prétear_ turns out to be the Big Bad Takako/Fenrir in disguise.
-   Mey-Rin from _Black Butler_ seems pretty useless as a maid. On more than one occasion she has mixed up shoe polish for wood polish, among other things. However, she's also an amazingly efficient sniper. She doesn't even use a sniping scope since she's apparently THAT far-sighted (one of the reasons she probably mixes up cleaning products). She keeps a few racks of rifles on the roof so she doesn't have to waste time reloading, and she's once seen using said rifles as pistols to take down baddies. But of course, it is only natural that a servant of Phantomhive would be able to do that.
    -   Hannah Anasfeloz from season 2 is also one of these. Not only she's a maid, but she's actually a _demon_.
-   Hinata Hyuga cosplayed in a maid/bunny-version of her outfit in an omake from the _Naruto_ anime.
-   In _Banana no Nana_ we have MaiMai, an actual country of Ninja Maids.
-   Virgo from _Fairy Tail_. Bonus points, she used to be an actual bodyguard.
-   With a manga called _Maid War Chronicles_ it's pretty obvious that it's **built** on this trope. At first only Cocao, the lead, seems to truly fit it, but more and more maids are showing Hidden Depths...and some wicked badass skills.
-   _Bleach_: A flashback back arc reveals that the mixed-blood Kanae Katagiri was introduced into the pure-blood Ishida family when she and Uryuu's father Ryuuken were very young children. As Ryuuken's personal servant and bodyguard, she is an excellent Quincy warrior and Ryuuken's first choice as battle partner. She is Uryuu's Missing Mom and a Posthumous Character, as she suffered a Cruel and Unusual Death that is inescapably connected to the death of Ichigo's mother.
-   Mina Tepes' maids in _Dance in the Vampire Bund_ double as her bodyguards. They don't know kung fu specifically, but given they're all vampires, they don't exactly need to.
-   _Beelzebub_ has the wetnurses, including Hilda, one of the main characters. They are not ninjas, they are demons! Though, Hilda and Yolda have weird weapons, as Hilda has an umbrella sword and Yolda has a broom...
-   Supreme ruler Petrarca's maids in _Outbreak Company_ are all elven battle-mages that double as her bodyguards. Said bodyguards are capable of defeating even special forces.
    -   Myucel also qualifies as this. She is a maid who is happiest when serving The Hero Shinichi. Yet under her meek and gentle character is a former military soldier with capable magic and martial arts capable of defeating a group of terrorists and even trained soldiers if need be.
-   In _Problem Children are Coming from Another World, aren't they?_, Leticia Draculea is a powerful vampire knight who got captured by the rival community Perseus and was saved by the titular problem children. They want her to become their maid which she gladly accepts - after all she was spared a Fate Worse than Death as a Sex Slave thanks to them. This has the added bonus that not many people would suspect her (being a maid) to actually BE Leticia but rather a look-alike and doubly gives the advantage of having a good reason to have her around at all times.
-   _The Voynich Hotel_ has Elena, the youngest of the maids in said hotel. She's tiny, slender, child-like, and a terrifying force to be reckoned with if either her home/workplace or her boyfriend Kuzuki are threatened in any way. She used to actually be a witch, Lachrymamrum aka the Mother of Tears, who's been around from before the Spanish colonization days.
-   In _Shinozaki-san Ki wo Ota Shika ni!_ chapter 35, when Amy visits a Maid Cafe she is under the firm belief that all Japanese maids are expert marksmen who can chase down cars on foot, break swords with their teeth and stop time. Rather than break the truth to her, the head maid claims that all Japan's maids are secretly ninjas and that they require government authorization to use any techniques more advanced than "make food delicious".
-   Tohru from _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_, who is a bit higher up the power scale than most examples since she's a dragon that could easily blow up the planet if she really wanted to. This gets lampshaded in the title of the first episode of the anime, "The Strongest Maid in History, Tohru! (Well, She is a Dragon)."
-   Hayasaka from _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_. She can- and _has needed to_\- flip over security lasers, maintain multiple alter egos, and find blackmail material. It's later shown that this extends to the entire Hayasaka family, with another employee of the Shinomiya family explicitly comparing them to ninjas.
-   The Macrophages in _Cells at Work!_ are beautiful, polite, and serene young women in elegant maid uniforms... whose cleaning duties involve brutally hacking apart bacteria and infected cells with massive, vicious weapons.
-   Kyo Nijimura from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: JoJolion_. Not only is she the maid of the Higashikata household, she also has an extremely powerful Stand, which she will not hesitate to use to its full potential.

As for Bodyguard Crush, the term is far too limited.
-   One shows up in a side story to _A Brief History of Equestria_. And like any true ninja, not even the audience realizes what she is until it's too late.
-   In _The Vow_ (a _Kung Fu Panda 2_ fanfic), we're introduced Jade, a dhole spy against Lord Shen who infiltrates the Tower of the Sacred Flame as a maid. She helps the heroes against Shen by doing undercover missions.
-   _Harry and the Shipgirls_ eventually introduces the Potter Maid Corps, a group of shipgirls who play this role at Potter Manor. The Head Maid, Ffion, especially plays this role to the hilt by being an Expy of Sakuya Izayoi, powers and all.
    -   A clan of Yokai in Japan has their own version of this trope in the form of Tekeli-Chan. Like her name suggests, she's a shoggoth

    Literature 

-   Aika from _Escapist Dream_ is an otaku who dresses up and has the powers of a typical anime combat maid in a virtual reality world.
-   Eliza D. Braun in _Books And Braun_ has one of those. Made even more badass because the maid has no legs, but relies on protheses to be able to walk.
-   Luciene and Marianne, Ryoko's maids directly imported from France in _The Case Files of Yakushiji Ryoko_. The former is a genius hacker, while the latter is a weapons specialist. Both kick _copious_ amounts of ass.
-   Antonia's maids in _Cat Planet Cuties_ are more like a private army. They are versed in hand-to-hand combat, stealth, are very well armed, and even have military-trained snipers working in their ranks.
-   It is inferred, in the _Discworld_ series, that Purity, nanny and governess to Young Sam Vimes, has more going for her than is apparent at first glance. Terry Pratchett does let slip that Battle Butler Willikins has "taught her a few tricks" in addition to whatever she already knew when she passed the job interview. She is certainly nanny to a prime kidnap or revenge target - the son of Commander Vimes and Lady Sybil Ramkin.

-   In _Haruhi Suzumiya_, it's heavily implied that the agency member Mori Sonou from is one of these. Though technically she only pretends to be a maid as part of her cover.
-   Hazuki Sakurazaka of _Haruka Nogizaka's Secret_, who is capable of roofhopping and knocking men out, and if that's not enough, she still has her chainsaw on her repertoire. Her fellow maid Nanami Nanashiro seems to be this way as well, as she is also pretty handy with her hammer.

-   Charlotte Dunois and Laura Bodewig in _Infinite Stratos_. In one episode, they get a job in a maid cafe, with Laura dressing up as a maid, while Charlotte gets a butler uniform, despite having a life desire to BE a maid for Ichika, the main protagonist. Oh, and Laura is a Super-Soldier from the German Army and Charlotte was also extensively trained in combat. Sucks to be the Stupid Crooks that decided to break into that same cafe, on their very first day.
-   In the _Kris Longknife_ series, Kris' maid Abby is responsible for outfitting her in fashionable clothing appropriate for a princess, outfitting a nine-person assault squad in combat armour appropriate for ass-kicking, and infiltrating a facility and acting as sniper overwatch fashionably dealing with enemies too dim to run the hell away.
-   Ulla from _Larklight_. "Have a care, sir, I'll have you know I am an agent of the British Secret Service!"

-   _Dust of Dreams_, book nine of the _Malazan Book of the Fallen_, has the nameless handmaiden of princess Felash, who is first thought to be a regular assassin, but turns out to be a highly deadly, highly badass bodyguard for the princess. The next book reveals her to be from an island warrior society, the Seguleh.
-   The Demon Queen's Head Maid in _Maoyu_ is almost as well-versed in magic and combat as her mistress. To her, the Way of the Maid is considered a noble calling, on pair with chivalry. Though it's partly because she learned about it from reading books, possibly light novels.
-   In _The Masked City_, Lord Silver's entourage includes maids trained in martial arts and equipped with various concealed blades, in addition to his Battle Butlers. They're skilled enough to go toe to toe with a gang of The Guantes' werewolves and win in a brawl.
-   Lilia from _Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation_ was previously employed as a "royal guardsmaid" to the Asura consorts' palace before joining the Greyrat family. In the web novel, it is explained that those in Lilia's position usually perform the duties of an ordinary maid, but grab their swords to defend their masters in case of emergency. Unfortunately, Lilia was a much better maid than a swordfighter, so when an assassin tried to kill the newborn Asura princess, she took a poisoned dagger to the leg, which ultimately cost her the job.
-   _Neo Akihabara Meipouchou_ is about assassin maids who fight with weapons disguised as cleaning tools.
-   The Pleiades from _Overlord_ are all seemingly harmless maids who all have their own skills and abilities to kill their enemies in a variety of ways. They were Nazarick's last line of defense. And nobody ever went that far. That said, they only dress like maids, and only one of them can cook.
    -   Special mention to Solution whose specialty includes "Assassin", "Master Assassin" and "Poison Maker" and whose highest stat is Agility. She is a literal ninja maid.
-   In _The Princess Series_ Talia is one of the top-secret agents for Queen Bea. She is a highly trained martial artist whose abilities are enhanced by fairy magic. Her cover is that of a simple palace servant.
-   _Rebuild World_:
    -   Ojou Reina has a Sibling Team of these as bodyguards, Shiori and Kanae, them being hunters with Powered Armor underlays below their maid outfits. Shiori uses a gun and then switches to a high tech Katana, while Kanae Does Not Like Guns and prefers the Power Fist. The two are Red Oni, Blue Oni, with Shiori a Consummate Professional and Kanae a Genki Girl Blood Knight. How out of place their outfits are plays into a Running Gag in the series (it's an ancient tradition).
    -   Eventually a lot more employed by Reina's family are encountered under Reina's rival Chloe, serving as Elite Mooks alongside her Battle Butler servants. All of the above were Recruited from the Gutter to be trained and brainwashed to be fanatically loyal to their MegaCorp, which in that regard, Shiori and Kanae were judged fourth rate. Chloe employs a duo serving as Evil Counterpart to Shiori and Kanae, the (butler) Lattice, and Pamela.
-   _Re:Zero_: Rem and Ram, the twin maids of Roswaal's mansion. They're dutiful if snarky maids while doing their day job, but when the gloves come off any unfortunate offenders are reminded that their secondary duty is to defend the mansion to their deaths, and they have the skills to back it up - Ram is a powerful wind mage, while Rem is quite deadly while wielding an Epic Flail that's bigger than her head. It helps that they're both Oni with innate magic powers and skills, and Ram used to be even _more_ powerful before her horn was cut off.

-   In Paula Harrison's book _The Secret Promise_, Princess Emily doesn't understand why her maid, Ally, quit her previous job as an undercover agent with ninja training to become a lady's maid to a five-year-old princess.

-   The Maid in _So I'm a Spider, So What?_ is the most powerful combat goddess in existence and is almost impossible to even be aware of as she is able to _kill_ her own presence. As for why she's dressed like a maid? It's just a hobby.

-   _That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime_:
    -   Misery and Rain are the two personal maids of True Demon Lord Guy Crimson. They're also the Primordial Demons Green and Blue respectively who are each as strong as the average True Demon Lord (who can easily destroy countries and even _continents_ on their lonesome) themselves. The reason they're maids in the first place is because Guy, the Primordial Red, kicked their asses so thoroughly in the distant past they swore to serve him since.
    -   True Demon Lord Luminous Valentine likes to dress up and act the part of a maid on a whim. She's also several thousands of years old and a part of that "country-smashing and continent-wrecking" club.
-   Imogen in _Tsun-Tsun TzimTzum_ wears her people's traditional warrior-magician uniform... which by sheer coincidence happens to look exactly like a French maid outfit.

-   Alcina from _Endgame_ finds evidence, takes out hitmen, and makes sure your towels are extra fluffy.
-   Shae from _Game of Thrones_. In the books, camp follower Shae plays up her ingénue appearance, and while she works as a maid, she has little insight into what's really going on around her. However, the TV series changes this significantly; she's still a handmaiden (and whore), but she's also very adept at lying, has a good eye for what makes people tick (and how to exploit it), and is good with a knife. She goes out of her way to protect Sansa Stark several times while she's in her care, chasing down and threatening another handmaiden at knife-point and even staring down Sandor Clegane and Ilyn Payne, both trained killers nearly twice her size.
-   Luka in Episode 6 of _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_, in which she goes undercover as a Meido in a fancy mansion. When a Zangyack invades it looking for the episode's MacGuffin, she uses her fighting ability to drive him away.

-   _Castlevania_ - Ninja Maids are a recurring enemy in the series.
    -   They're called Persephone in _Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin_, and some of them have vacuum cleaners - which cause Charlotte to let out an embarrassed yelp if they catch her skirt.
    -   They're also in _Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow_, and their vacuums are their soul power. And they can be used to catch the skirts of Student Witches or the Persephones themselves. But those are more of the Kung Fu Maids.
    -   The real Ninja Maids appeared in the _Castlevania_ for X68000 (later ported to PS1 as _Castlevania Chronicles_) in the final level, and some of them turned into Zombie Maids after death.

-   In Adultswim.com's online game _Death Vegas,_ there is an unattractive example in Lourdes, who carries a plunger that separates into a dagger and what seems to be a cudgel with the plunger head on it. She seems to be some sort of mercenary who turns on Dante when offered a better contract.
-   Rasberyl from _Disgaea 3_ has two retainers, a maid and a female Samurai. Rather than being a maid who knows kung fu, she's a ninja who does a maid's work.
-   _Dusk Diver_: Bette from Dusk Diver 2. She wears a regular french maid outfit, takes care of her master and uses a big scythe to fight enemies. No ninja moves though.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   _Fire Emblem: Awakening_ has Cherche, a wyvern-riding maid with an axe who is the vassal of Duke Virion of Rosanne. And shall they have enough supports levels, they can marry and become the parents of Gerome, Cherche's Kid from the Future.
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_ has this as its own unit class (complete with maid outfit), with Felicia starting off as one for a male main character (though she does join in later if the MC is a girl) and her older sister Flora joining in the _Conquest_ path and potentially the _Revelation_ one. To make the "ninja" half more blatant, they can wield hidden weapons like kunai and shuriken in addition to staves. Notably, Felicia is a capable healer and ninja but is TERRIBLE at the actual duties of a maid, such as cooking and not dropping delicate plates.
-   The _Galaxy Angel II_ trilogy has Melba Brownie, a maid who serves in the Luxiole's tea lounge. While she fits the typical Bubbly Waitress archetype, she's also an official member of the military, having apparently mastered some weird martial-arts that mixes her waitress duties and conventional fighting techniques. If all else fails, she reveals that she carries a P90 with her.
-   _Genshin Impact_ has Noelle, a maid who dreams and trains to become a full-fledged knight. Her outfit is a combination of a maid uniform and knightly armour, and she is very skilled in both menial work and combat.

-   Cinnamon's Hyper Mode in _Mega Man X: Command Mission_ turns her costume into a maid's uniform.
-   _Melty Blood_ - Kohaku and Hisui got a maid-upgrade from Normal to Ninja. Kohaku in particular becomes faster than almost any other character in the game, including superhumanly fast vampires, and gets a hidden katana inside her broom. In the _Tsukihime_ manga, Kohaku has a truly impressive all-black meido outfit, for accompanying Akiha on less orthodox jobs. This is viewable in the original game; if you "Push yourself to see Arcueid," in the Arcueid route you get a Bad Ending where Kohaku wears this outfit.
-   Lil' Miss Marshmallow from _Mother 3_. She seems fairly harmless until you try to take the Friend's Yoyo and she goes ballistic on you.
-   Iroha from _Samurai Shodown_. Particularly notable for looking almost _literally_ like what comes to mind when thinking of the term "Ninja Maid": she wears what is essentially a cross between traditional Japanese garb and the stereotypically skimpy French-maid costume.
-   Nel's fourth costume in _Star Ocean: Till the End of Time_ is a very skimpy French maid outfit.
-   Ding Feng in _Wonderland Online_. The description even says that she is a ninja who is a maid to get closer to the enemy.
-   The Legendary Geisha unit from _Shogun: Total War_ follows this trope in spirit if not in letter. She's an assassin who masquerades as an "entertainer."
-   With the right DLC, you can make one of these in the _Soul Calibur IV_ and _Soul Calibur V_ character creator.
-   _Touhou Project_:
    -   Sakuya Izayoi of the Scarlet Devil Mansion from _Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil_, capable of throwing dozens, if not hundreds, of knives at her foes at an instant. How she manages to carry them all is probably connected to her space-time manipulation abilities. Provides the page quote.
        -   ZUN stated once that Sakuya doesn't actually need that many knives (though she owns _many_), she simply collects the ones she already threw and uses them again with her Time Stands Still ability.
    -   Youmu Konpaku, gardener of the Netherworld (Hakugyokuro), also a double-sworded half-human half-ghost samurai girl.
    -   Yumeko from the final PC-98 game, _Touhou Kaikidan ~ Mystic Square_. She was the original SWORD throwing maid of the series.
    -   Mugetsu, who used lasers and... magical bullet arrows.
        -   Subverted. She's actually not a maid, just into cosplay.
-   _Toy Fighter_ is a fighting game where all your playable characters are Living Toys, one of them being Vitamin, a doll in a maid's dress but also a competent fighter. She even carries a Frying Pan of Doom on her back which she can use in battle.
-   Noel Kidou Ehrlichkeit from _Triangle Heart 3: Sweet Songs Forever_ is this plus Robot Girl. Her counterpart in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_ doesn't get into a single fight scene, so it's unknown whether she is, too.
-   Aylith from _Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume_, playable in the Seraphic Gate. Sure, her powers should be no wonder since her true form is actually that of a 30-feet tall hell hound.
-   Cecilia of _Vanguard Bandits_ started as a ninja but became a maid to spy on someone and took a real liking to it.
-   Shiraha from _Oshiete: Re Maid_ is a variation: she's a highly-skilled bodyguard, but her skill at housework leaves a lot to be desired, partly because she's a trigger-happy gun nut.
-   Kikkawa Kiku and Kobayakawa Chinu from _Sengoku Rance_. Although Kobayakawa Chinu is in fact of the Miko class. She is a user of poisons.
-   Alice from _Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle_ , the Duchess's personal maid, isn't a ninja, she took barbarian levels instead. Though, it does result in a lot of broken furniture. And one busted tower.
-   Whim from _Mana Khemia 2: Fall of Alchemy_ dresses and works as a maid, but she's actually a Mana with considerable ice powers who has a contract with Lily and does all the fighting for her. Her true form resembles a mermaid.
-   Bloody Marie from _Skullgirls_ is an odd case as instead of being a maid who just happens to know how to fight, she incorporates her job as a maid into her fighting style. Her main weapon, for instance, is a _demonic vacuum cleaner_.
-   _Arcana Heart_ has Fiona Mayfield, who serves as both maid and bodyguard to Mildred, Big Bad of the first game. She wears the classic maid costume, and can competently swing a zweihander as big as she is for the game's strongest (but slow) normals.
-   Some minor sidequests in _Persona 3_ give you maid costumes for the female party characters. At the point of the game that those quests become available, said outfits are the best armor for them that you have access to.
-   Various mobile RPG games by Kemco have a habit of including the recurring character Maidame Curie as a superboss and as a supporting character (Especially if you're going for the True Ending). In most (but not all) appearances, she's the strongest boss in the game, and if she isn't, her One-Winged Angel form(s) will be.
-   Female player characters in _Final Fantasy XIV_ can invoke the look if they're wearing the french maid outfit while their class is the Ninja.
-   _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_: Make any Mii fighter, put them in the maid costume, and you got this.
-   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_ has Sharon Kreuger, the Reinford family's maid. Aside from her amazing abilities as a cook, she also has an unnatural ability to always show up wherever Class VII goes, seems to have a past history with Instructor Sara (a highly experienced Bracer) and is very capable at using Razor Floss. It's later revealed that she's actually an assassin for Ouroboros.
-   _Ruina: Fairy Tale of the Forgotten Ruins_: Fran is a maid working for Duke Kamur, who also happens to be skilled in the village of Rendume's ninja arts. She ended up in this profession because her clan is allied with the town of Holm.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_: Kirumi Tojo is the Ultimate Maid for a reason, as she's also strong and skilled enough to serve as both personal maid and bodyguard to dignitaries around the world.
-   The Fan Game _Danganronpa Another_ has Akane Taira, another Ultimate Maid whose quick reflexes allowed her to narrowly escape becoming the second murder victim. She's also revealed to be The Dragon, and personally subdued several of the students including the By-the-Book Cop with Charles Atlas Superpower Kinjo in a head-on fight before the Deadly Game began. When her true identity is revealed she starts doing acrobatics while Laughing Mad in and out of rooms.
-   Leysritt and Sella are ninja maids for Ilya in _Fate/stay night_. Also from the Nasuverse is Waver's maid golem, formed out of liquid mercury. While ordinarily tasked with basic chores it sometimes goes on rampages while declaring it's a killer robot from the future.
-   Azumi is the most notable one in _Maji Koi Love Me Seriously_, but all the Kuki maids would count. Also lampshaded:
    
    "Isn't that more like a ninja than a maid?"
    
-   Kuon of _My Girlfriend Is the President_ is a unique example because despite being a hyper-competent bodyguard to Irina her specialty is not in bladed weaponry, throwing weaponry, or even melee. Rather she specializes in firearms and grenades. Lots and lots of grenades.<small>◊</small> Though she does tend to be good at sneaking up on people and popping out of nowhere.
-   In the manga for _Hatoful Boyfriend_ Sakuya is affronted and disdainful when he finds out that Ryouta works in a maid cafe. Ryouta gets him to shut up and accept this by telling him how maids are the modern-day ninja. Notably, Ryouta does not fill this trope himself, Sakuya's just a clueless fanboy of anything ninja.

    Webcomics 

-   Lampshaded in _Castlevina RPG_'s CVRPG Meets the TMNT arc. Darkmoom seems to have trouble realizing that not all Ninjas are maids.
-   Mecha Maid in the superhero comic _Spinnerette_ combines this trope with Robot Maid since she's a ninja maid in a powered battlesuit. She even cites Mahoromatic as an inspiration.
-   Subverted, sort of, in a bit of _Errant Story_ backstory that's important to the main plot: a standard Little Old Lady maid, whose main concern seems to be her aching feet, turns assassin. Her main weapon is a gun, but she still manages a nifty ninja jump — after the hand that fired the gun is _cut off_.
-   Amusingly justified example in _The Order of the Stick_, as one of the restaurant waiters is putting herself through ninja school on the side, and needs her restaurant job to pay the bills.
-   Claire and Stella in _Collar 6_ are a pair of bodyguard/assassin sisters who seek employment with Mistress Sixx. They're not ninjas, strictly speaking, but they get the job done.
-   Mell in the Victorian side-story of _Narbonic_ lacks the subtlety to be a ninja, but is very enthusiastic about being a BFG-Wielding Maid.

    Web Original 

-   v2 of _Open Blue_ had Count Veneto's Killer Bunny Assassination Squad. Justified by them being Tyke Bomb commandos who just happen to be working for a nutty Blue Blood, who, for a reason that has yet to be figured out, prefers to have them dress up as maids.
-   _Fire Emblem on Forums_: Any player character who specialises into offense and takes the Maid or Butler class is this by default, but for a few specific examples:
    -   _Death to Traitors_: Lucette, who is actually a Mafia Princess masquerading as a Ninja Maid and _enjoys_ killing people more than she does being a maid.
    -   _Wonderful Blessing_: Two examples; 42-1, a homunculus who was created as a servant and wields one of the very few firearms in the entire setting, and Rena, a Revivian who was stuck in the form of Rem, including her clothing and is equally capable of smashing things to bits with her Epic Flail or healing her allies.
    -   _Lost Lands_: Anea, a Consummate Professional maid selected for the players' mission for her healing talents, but equally capable of carving someone up.

-   For some reason, the list of _Things Mr. Welch Is No Longer Allowed to Do in an RPG_ specifically forbids this.
    
    141\. My maid does not know kung fu.
    

It _is_ a long list of Noodle Incidents...

-   The filk song _On Top of the Wall_, whose narrator declares that she's "normally a scullery maid" but when the castle in which she works is attacked, she sings, "I'm up on top of the wall looking down on the raiders and the only source of comfort I can find is this large pot of oil, which I've just begun to boil. I've been cooking up on top of the wall."
