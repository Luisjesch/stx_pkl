Some variations on the theme.

A scene where it is made very clear that a character has found something so hot that they have to go somewhere where they can perform some immediate self-service.

This can be a form of Getting Crap Past the Radar, assuming even the implication isn't too much for the censors.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: One chapter has girl Matsuri suddenly flirting with Suzu to distract her from boy Matsuri, who's carrying a curse that can kill Suzu. After she licks some cream off Suzu's face, there's a closeup of Suzu trembling with arousal. The next panel has Suzu stepping out of the girl's bathroom, sighing in relief.
-   _Buso Renkin_: During the Buso Renkin Seminar omake at the end of the anime's 5th episode, Mahiro begins talking about what she wants to do with Tokiko if she becomes her big sister via marrying Kazuki, getting increasingly excited before realising that she is letting her imagination run away with itself and says she will continue when she gets back to her dorm later on.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Dykes to Watch Out For_: After being turned down for sex by her husband Stuart (due to baby-related exhaustion), Sparrow gets up. When asked where she's going, she says, with full quote marks, "To 'take a shower'".

    Fanfic 

-   In _Thousand Shinji_, when Rei tells how Asuka dragged her into the shower to wash her body personally, Shinji and Touji excused to the bathroom for a few minutes.
    
    Asuka had more or less dragged her into the shower before coming shopping, something that had soured her mood somewhat. Especially the enforced use of soap.  
    Of course, when she had told that last fact to everyone, Shinji and Toji had both excused themselves to the bathroom for a few minutes before returning with small bits of bloody toilet paper stuffed up their nostrils. Rei did not quite understand what that had been about, but the other two females in their group had just rolled their eyes while Kaji just snickered a little.
    
-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "The Other Smurfette", Handy, Carpenter, and Mason get turned on by Hogatha appearing before them as a beautiful female Smurf named Wonderette. In fact, they're so turned on by her that Handy says, "If anyone needs me, I'm going to be in the Imaginarium," and afterward Carpenter and Mason both say, "We're smurfing turns after him!"
-   In the _Hero: The Guardian Smurf_ mini-story "Smurfette's Artistry", Smurfette after spending time doing a nude painting of Hero (who at the time was married to Wonder) decides to spend some time alone with her new painting in her bedroom, alluding to enjoying herself privately.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Catwoman: Hunted_. After Interpol agents King Farady and Julia Pennyworth leave Batwoman to guard Catwoman, Selina Kyle strips off and fills a bathtub, flirting heavily with Kate Kane until she's on the verge of joining her...only for Selina to remind her that cats bathe themselves.
    
    **Selina:** Of course, you're _more_ than welcome to watch...if that's how you get your kicks.
    
    **Kate:** No, dammit I... _(beat)_ I'll be in the cockpit. Monitoring Farady and Pennyworth's progress.
    

    Literature 

-   In _A Deeper Blue_ by John Ringo, Katya was infiltrating a drug runner's boat by playing an airhead beach bunny dressed in a tiny bikini. Greznya (also dressed in a tiny bikini, this is a John Ringo book) was visiting the boat and passed along a message capsule through a bottle of vodka. To cover it, two of the girls got into a cat fight. The bad guy who had video surveillance of the entire boat told his boss "I'm sure they didn't pass anything to each other. I ran that clip a dozen times. Maybe more. Zoomed all over it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my quarters..."
-   In Nemesis of the _Horus Heresy_, an Eversor Assassin reacts this way when he is first shown the crate of weapons the team will be using on their mission.
-   _Running With Lions_ - After seeing his Love Interest Emir nearly naked, Sebastian really hopes his bunk mate Willie is at a long breakfast because Sebastian needed some "alone time."

    Live-Action TV 

-   Trope Namer: In the _Firefly_ episode "War Stories", Jayne's response to the discovery that Inara is going to be servicing a female counselor on board her shuttle is "I'll be in my bunk."
    
    _\[an emergency occurs right after that\]_  
    **Zoe:** Jayne! Grab your weapon!  
    **Jayne:** I was gonna!
    
    -   Wash gives it a Call-Back in the episode’s last scene, when Mal and Zoe tease him about needing to get it on and start to kiss.
        
        **Wash:** _\[getting up and grabbing Zoe by the arm\]_ We'll be in our bunk.
        
-   The line is repeated by Casey, also played by Adam Baldwin, in the _Chuck_ episode "Chuck Versus The Broken Heart" when he sees his Distaff Counterpart do a sexy gun cleaning.
-   _Friends_:
    -   Rachael and Monica lose their apartment in a bet with Chandler and Joey, but finally get it back when they agree to kiss for a minute. The two guys then go into their rooms as soon as that is over.
    -   The trope also manifests in an episode where Chandler asks Monica and Rachel for sexual advice. Monica's advice becomes ... rather enthusiastic. When Monica finishes, totally orgasmic just from her description, she races off to her bedroom, Rachel races off to her own bedroom and Chandler races off to the bathroom.
-   A notable example in _Seinfeld_ ("The Contest", about the four main characters wagering on who can go the longest without masturbating). Kramer loses his willpower almost instantly, just from catching a glimpse of Jerry's nude neighbor, and while he doesn't say much before he excuses himself from the room, he's back very quickly with his forfeit and the declaration "I'm out!"
-   In an episode of _How I Met Your Mother_, Marshall imagines going back in time to stop his 13-year-old self from smoking his first cigarette by giving him a picture of Lily, to which Young Marshall comments, "Wow, she's hot."

-   In the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "The Perfect Mate", Riker says something close to the trope name after being kissed by the empathic metamorph:
    
    **Riker:** Riker to bridge. If you need me, I'll be in holodeck four.
    
-   In an episode of _Spin City_, after Michael and Caitlin get hot and heavy (apparently, office small talk turns her on) only for her to leave in the middle of it, Michael sits down, sighs, looks at his hand and asks "So, how was your day?"
-   In the _The Big Bang Theory_ episode The Werewolf Transformation, Amy starts fantasizing about Sheldon growing his hair out and riding horseback "bare-back and bare-chested". She runs to her bathroom to brush her teeth.
    
    **Amy:** I need to go brush my teeth. It might take a while.
    
    -   Made funnier by the fact that in an earlier episode, she admitted using an electric toothbrush in her "relaxation techniques for ladies". She calls it Gerard.
-   In the 1970s TV Series _Hot L Baltimore_, a character who is implied to be gay by his "swish" demeanor and stereotypical gay mannerisms, mentions in one episode where he is "going into the toilet and meditate."
-   In _Two and a Half Men_, when Herb is talking with Charlie about rumors of Alan's girlfriend Lindsey doing softcore porn, he excuses himself by going off to "take a shower". Later in the episode, he calls Charlie to inform him that he actually found said porn on Cinemax. Charlie ends the phone call by saying, "Okay Herb enjoy your shower".
-   Implied in the _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ short _Mr. B Natural_ when socially awkward kid Buzz comes home and tells his mother he's going upstairs to read.
    
    **Mom:** Umm, Buzz, this time don't make so much noise when you read.
    
-   When _Saturday Night Live_ did a _Harry Potter_ parody with Lindsay Lohan as the All Grown Up Hermione, Hagrid mentioned having to "tame a dragon", while the twins had to "beat a couple of bludgers." Snape avoided any euphemism and just took points away from Gryffindor.
-   _Doctor Who_: David Tennant claimed in the Easter Egg commentary for "The Five Doctors" that after watching Peri's bikini scene in "Planet of Fire" as a teenager he had to "spend some time in \[his\] bedroom".
-   _Reign_: The infamous (and edited-down-by-the-network) sequence in the first episode in which Kenna finds a quiet spot to "relieve tension" after viewing two people making love is presented in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek manner as she races through the palace with a knowing look on her face until she finally finds a place.
-   _Supernatural_: Dean's fondness for Filth is a Running Gag on the show, and when he finds a vintage edition of _Busty Asian Beauties_ in the Men of Letters bunker, his brother gives him an extra ten minutes before they leave for a case.

    Video Games 

-   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, the Warden may ask Oghren how he feels about his wife cheating on him with another woman. The description of what he "can't help but" imagine them doing together ends with him telling the Warden that he needs a few minutes in his tent before they continue.
    -   In _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, The Iron Bull uses a qunari phrase (Taarsidath-an halsaam) that translates most closely to "I will bring myself sexual pleasure later, while thinking about this with great respect."
        
        **Inquisitor:** You shouted _that_ while a dragon was breathing fire at us?!
        
-   In _Mass Effect_, Ashley nearly uses this line verbatim if Shepard turns her down at Ilos.
-   _Kingdom of Loathing_'s description for the "Dirty Pear" effect:

    Webcomics

-   _Grrl Power_: Invoked word for word in the margin sketch on this page, by Harem predictably enough, after Sydney promises to introduce Arianna to Hentai.
-   The page pic is from _Ménage à 3_, strip #319 (June 25, 2010, possibly marginally NSFW), when Gary and Zii see DiDi singing a French love song in a shirt that's too small for her.
-   In _Pixie Trix Comix,_ Yaoi fan Ramona reacts to the idea of Julian and Aaron "bro'in out" by heading off to the restroom.
-   _Sunstone_'s Alan will sometimes have to head to the bathroom for some "alone time" when the sexual shenanigans of the main female cast get to be too much for him.

    Web Original 

-   Used in _Vision of Escaflowne Abridged_ when Folken is discussing the Incestuous Bisexual Ninja Catgirls, and noting what fetish material they were.

    **Folken:** Once, For my birthday.

-   _Whateley Universe_: One more than one occasion, Phase has pulled a Discretion Shot about this, stating outright that it was none of the readers' business what he was doing when he was alone in his bedroom. This is hardly surprising, give that, since he _looks_ mostly female, he is expected to share the bathroom and showers with the freshmen girls in Poe Cottage - several of whom are supernaturally attractive.
-   In _Farce of the Three Kingdoms,_ Zhuge Liang has this reaction to Jiang Wei _attempting to set him on fire._

    Western Animation 

-   After Molotov Cocktease lives up to her name in _The Venture Brothers_, Brock— with a very visible erection— leaves the room to "take care of something".
-   In _Family Guy_, Brian invokes this trope not because he finds something arousing, but from sexual frustration after he's in a Sexless Marriage with Lois for a year, and Peter shows up the very day that Lois was going to consummate.
    
    **Lois:** I tell ya, Brian, it's a good thing Peter came back when he did. I was ready to push the beds together tonight and take you for a ride around the friggin' WORLD!!  
    **Brian:** ...I'll be in the basement.  
    **Peter:** Doing what?  
    **Brian:** What do you think?!
    
    -   Another example is fake trailer for a movie called "Masturbator And Commander" (a play on _Master and Commander_) where the commander will be "out in a minute" during a battle.
-   In a _Robot Chicken_ sketch parodying _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_ has the main male cast react this way to Gadget deciding to go half-naked.
