_"Hey, champ. I, uh, wanted to talk to you. You know, about what you just saw. Because things aren't always what they appear. Sometimes, when someone is choking, you have to get behind them to give them the Heimlich. This was not that. I was not helping your mother with a leg cramp, I was not giving her a lying-down hug, I was not helping her look for her contacts. I was **plowing**, Steve."_

Someone, usually a child, is wandering in his or her house and walks into two people having sex. (Nobody _ever_ has a room with a lock in fiction.) Most of the time it's the parents. This can lead to A) the parents giving that one discussion we all mention vaguely, B) the resulting Parental Sexuality Squick leaving the unfortunate soul to be shell-shocked for a while, C) being very funny, or some combination of the three.

Its psychological term is the _Primal Scene_, coined by none other than Freud.

Naturally, media always plays this as a traumatic experience, rather than the person just figuring it is natural, quickly realizing such, or just not understanding why mommy and daddy are playing leap-frog naked (and then after looking back on it all when they get older, will quickly apply Brain Bleach to forget about it).

And of course, all "child" characters, no matter how old, don't understand sex. Characters identified to the audience as "teenagers" will simply be horrified. This rule applies to almost every example, despite the fact that most children (even 8- or 9-year-olds) will know what they interrupted in Real Life. That said, most offspring are conditioned not to think of their parents in sexual ways, so even if the _act_ itself isn't the big deal, seeing their _parents_ do it can be considered innately disturbing for some.

This may involve Right Through the Wall if the child hears their parents having sex. Sex in a Shared Room is the most damaging and disturbing form of this, when it actually occurs with the child _right there_ and is usually intentional, in which case it may function as a Freudian Excuse.

See Caught with Your Pants Down for the single-player version; for the reverse scenario with parents walking in on their adult child getting frisky, see Parents Walk In at the Worst Time. A subtrope of Interrupted Intimacy.

-   In one of the databooks for _Love Hina_, it reveals Motoko's fear of turtles is derived from walking in on Tsuruko and her husband. For those that don't understand, this fear is based off Japanese wordplay: The kanji for "turtle" and "head of the penis" are the same.

-   Horrifically enforced in _Monster_, when Milos walks into an alleyway and witnesses a man having sex with a prostitute. Rather than trying to shoo away Milos, the man _demands him to watch_, and then _pays_ him when he's finished. What makes it worse is that the man is a teacher. Milos is thoroughly traumatized and this event brings him a step closer to his Despair Event Horizon.

-   _Sand Chronicles_ has a painful Played for Drama instance, when a very young Fuji in a flashback walked in on his mother with another man.

-   Invoked in Cool-Kyou Shinsha's _Mononoke Sharing_ when Youko starts having sex to hide the fact that she was actually asking someone about getting a birthday present.
-   Subverted in one chapter of the _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid_ spin-off _ViVid Life_. Vivio mistakes the sight of Nanoha taking care of a drunk Fate during a video chat for the two of them in an intimate moment (as Fate was blushing and moaning Nanoha's name) and immediately ends the call.
-   Deconstructed in one case of _Psychometrer Eiji_ called "Justice, the Bloddthirsty Killer". The culprit saw his mother having sex another man when he was a child he became so traumatized he developed an extreme hatred toward girls whom he deems "whores."

    Comics 

-   In _Watchmen_, a young Walter Kovacs walks in on his prostitute mother servicing a client. Unlike most instances of this trope, this is not Played for Laughs and is shown to be very Harmful to Minors; the behavior of the adults involved plays a part too.
-   In _Runaways_, when Gert finds out her parents are actually super villains, she says "This is worse than the time I walked in on them doing it!"
-   Robert Crumb once tried to explain such a scene to his son as him and Aline (his wife) playing horse-riding. He didn't find an explanation though for why Aline had to be naked to do this.

-   In _Friday The 13th: Pamela's Tale_ issue two, in June of 1957, Jason Voorhees is enraged by the sight of Barry and Claudette having sex. That probably led him to kill everybody who engages in nonmarital sex.
-   _Red Ears_: One gag has a child witnessing his mother and father having sex, and later asking them what they were doing. Since he's still too young for The Talk, the mother explains that she was sitting on the father to make his belly flatter. The child then says that wouldn't help anyway, since their female neighbor comes over when the mother isn't home to blow it up again.
-   In _Sex Criminals_, Robert the gynecologist's somewhat conflicted attitudes to sex come from, as a young boy, catching his parents not merely having sex but engaging in some fairly heavy-duty BDSM, with his father bottoming. (Literally). This is actually played with, since while Robert is freaked out enough that he bails on trick-or-treating with his friends, he tells his dad he's actually _glad_ they have a healthy sex life, since literally all of his friends' parents have broken up due to infidelity.
-   _Titeuf_: Titeuf walks in on his parents in their underwear clearly about to start having sex. His parents say they're actually exercizing (and prove it by doing pushups, jumping jacks, stretching etc.). The next day, Titeuf tells his friend that parents don't actually have sex, they just work out.

    Fan Fiction

-   In Chapter 40 of _Harry Potter And The Rune Stone Path_, teenaged Harry Potter walks in on his adoptive mother Bathsheda Babbling (nicknamed Shiva) and his birth mother Lily Potter having sex on the couch. His thoughts insist that the strangled sound he made was _certainly_ not a terrified scream, it was a manly utterance of surprise. A quick embarrassed conversation later, he flees for the greenhouses.
    
    **Harry:** Sorry! I'll come back later!  
    **Shiva:** Harry! Knock next time, kid! I'm a little busy here!  
    **Harry:** I did knock! And I was talking too! Lock your bedroom!
    
-   Played with from both ends in the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fic ''I Can Explain''. Upon being caught, Rarity spins an elaborate lie to keep her sister's minds clean about what she caught her and Applejack doing, while Applejack is upfront and honest with her own sister. As it turns out, Sweetie already knew what sex was but still fell for the lie, and Apple Bloom was only surprised to find out that two girls can do it.
-   Happens in this Naruto fanfic, with the predictable results.
-   In the (not for faint-hearted!) Pokémon fic _Latias' Journey_, the cast enjoys a quiet-before-the-storm party on the night before the final battle. Some of them go for more... involved celebrations than others. So anyway, Phanpy walks in on Uncle Brother Pikachu going at it with a Weavile. Traumatized, he runs to Aunt Corsola for help, and walks in on _her_ right in the middle of Crawdaunt's _massive orgy_.
-   _Kris Performs Surgery_: When Rudy questions what repressed memories the Anthropomorphic Personification of his frontal lobe watches, Carci brings up (much to Rudy's displeasure at being reminded) that he walked in on his parents "making (him) a baby bro" when he was four.
-   In the Order of the Stick fic the Oneiroi Series, Vaarsuvius's parents intentionally have sex where their child can see them, leading to this situation often.

-   Due to a series of spoileriffic circumstances in _Luminosity_, Elspeth ends up with almost all of her father's memories. After a person asks a question about how much she can remember, she thinks of the wrong memory, and...
    
    _I_ remember _my_ parent's honeymoon_!_
    
-   Played With in a recent chapter of this fanfic— Kyon's sister walks in on him and his girlfriend having sex. Evidently, this happens so often that it no longer fazes her. Also, Mikuru (who in this fic is Kyon and Haruhi's future kid) knows about it, and is a bit shocked, even though she knew it had to happen eventually.
-   Toyed with in the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfic _Progress_. Princess Luna's embarrassed enough to flee to a castle labyrinth and blush bright red after walking in on her roommate and roommate's boyfriend, but as she's old enough to figure prominently in the local Creation Myth and more than old enough to be aware of sex (if only in the theoretical sense), she attributes this reaction to her old-fashioned views. Then she has a particularly surreal nightmare about walking in on Celestia with Luna's abacus, suggesting the matter to be much more traumatic than Luna is willing to admit to herself.
-   In chapter 4 of the _My Life as a Teenage Robot_ fic _My Life as a Teenaged Von Neumann Device_, Sheldon freaks out when he walks in on Jenny and Brad after they've just had sex... with unfortunate consequences, as Sheldon ends up running into the street and getting hit by a car, forcing Mrs. Wakeman to upload his brain into the body of the Silver Shell.
    -   Played for laughs in a later chapter, where Tuck freaks out after walking in on Mrs. Wakeman pleasuring herself in the bathtub. And later still, when Tiff Crust walks in on Mrs. Wakeman having "old-person sex" with Doctor Mog.
-   In this _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ fanfic, Kya walks in on disrobed parents Aang and Katara in the process of foreplay. While she immediately understands what’s going on, she’s still horrified.
    
    "Mom, Bumi won't stop mak—," Kya froze mid-rant, her irate complaint dangling mid-sentence as she fully assimilated the sight of her parents in bed and tangled in one another's arms. In that brief, appalling second, it was difficult to determine who was more horrified, Aang and Katara or their traumatized teenage daughter. However, Kya's explosive reaction that followed mere beats later firmly determined that it was the latter.
    
    She immediately clapped her hands over her face and bolted down the hallway screaming. "Oh my, blech... my eyes! My EYES! Dad, you said you were going to read a book! What's wrong with you people? I'm blind! The oogies!”
    
-   Worst possible variation in _Reprise_, the prequel to _Hivefled_; among other horrific things, Gamzee is forced to watch his potential future siblings be made. Would be bad enough if they weren't also getting across the point that he's a "moirail bastard".
-   Played with in this NSFW My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fic. Twilight follows Pony!Flash Sentry after he tells her he's seeing someone else. Hilarity Ensues. She sees him and Shining Armor have sex, and is disgusted because she thinks Shining is cheating on Cadence. But then it is revealed that he wasn't, as Cadance lets him do that, and likes to watch.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfic _Crashback_, Twilight Sparkle inadvertently witnesses her own conception, courtesy of a flashback potion.

-   _Meg's Family_ had a scene where Maddie, mistaking a moan from her parents' room for a sign of trouble, grabs her BB gun to help. It then cuts to Brian finding the poor girl clutching her gun, rambling about how the bullets won't work.
    -   In its predecessor, _Meg's Boyfriend_, Stewie walks in on Meg and Zack having sex. Predictably, he didn't take it well, and the next chapter notes that he may have been scarred for life.
-   In the _Naruto_ fanfic _From Pride to Shame,_ Bolt Uzumaki hides in a closet to prank this father due to his frustration for his parents' divorce and being stuck in his father's shadow. He ends up watching his father have sex with his ANBU captain, Sasuke in his office.
-   In the remake of _Battle Fantasia Project_ Minako mentions that her hate for tentacle monsters stems from walking on her mother having sex with one on her own bed and her father doing the same on _Minako's_, courtesy of Jadeite's last energy-draining scheme.
-   It happens in the eighth episode of _The Second Try_: Aki can’t sleep at night so she gets out of her bed, goes to her parents’ room and opens the door right when they’re making love. Thankfully she was only three at the most, so she had no idea what they were doing. Her appearance panicked her parents anyway.
-   In Chapter 3 of _Son of the Sannin_, Shizune walks into Tsunade's room, right when she and Jiraiya have woken up and are in the middle of getting dressed in a hurry. The next morning, she finds Tsunade's room unusually clean and neat and then goes downstairs to the living room...
    
    **Shizune**: OH DEAR KAMI! THAT'S THE ONLY COUCH WE HAVE!
    
    -   Though later in a canon Omake, she gets her revenge on Tsunade with her boyfriend Shisui's help.
-   In _How the Light Gets In_, Thea walks in on Dean and Laurel, right when he's about to go down on her. They aren't actually her parents, but they _are_ Parental Substitutes, so it counts. When Dean asks why didn't she knock, she asks why didn't he lock the door. Sara arrives a few seconds later, and after lightly teasing Thea about it, starts to talk about the time _she_ walked in on her parents having sex.
-   Prince Joffrey Baratheon is made aware of his true parentage when he accidentally walks into Cersei and Jaime in _Purple Days_. Cersei... doesn't help. At all.
-   Ash mentions this having happened with him in _Shudo cross Modern Ash: The Professor Who Observes his Charges,_ specifically during the equivalent of _Pokémon S3E39 "Forest Grumps"_. So it was less _walking in on his mother with someone_ as one might assume, and more _Ash was stuck in a forest with mating bipedal bears with anger issues who shoot laser beams at the drop of the hat_. He refers to the experience as mentally scaring.
    -   In the sequel to the above Shudo Cross, unlike Ash, Verity had this happen with her moms without mental scaring. In her own words, they were careful to not treat it as traumatizing to avoid negative connotations forming in her mind, akin to the passage from the Sex Positive Home in the quote section of this page.
-   Downplayed in the _Batman_ fanfic "Melody for a Mockingbird;" Damian/Robin only walks in on Bruce and Selina, Bruce's fiancée, in a pre-foreplay make out session, but because of Selina's growing status as Damian's mother figure, Parental Sexuality Squick kicks in and the sight is enough to send him screaming out of the Batcave. Alfred later finds the preteen curled up in a Troubled Fetal Position.
    
    **Damian**: Father and Selina...tongues...it..._revolting!_
    
-   In the _Pokémon_ one-shot _Empathetic,_ Dawn's Piplup walks in on his trainer having sex with Paul and, believing that he's attacking her, hits him with a Drill Peck. This leads to Dawn having to give Piplup an incredibly awkward discussion on human relations while her boyfriend gets checked for rectal damage.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Jaune mentions catching his parents on the dining room table, and this probably wasn't the first time. His sisters imply they've all had similar experiences, and their father at one point good-naturedly calls them "little cock blockers."
-   Audio example in _A Case Study in the Sturdiness of the Rookie 9_. Choji is trying to find out who's been stealing chocolate from his room, with his parents being one of the suspects. He and his teammates (Shino and Sakura) set up a wiretap to gather proof. They end up overhearing Choji's parents having sex instead.
-   In one chapter of _Pokémon Crossing_, Purrl goes off to find her parents for lunch and finds them in the middle of sex.
-   _Queens of Mewni_:
    -   One of the reasons Swan Redbird is the Hate Sink of this fandom is she exposed Venus to this when she coerced her into witnessing her aunt and uncle (Swan's parents) 'naked wrestling', one of the earliest forms of corruption that resulted in Venus losing her virginity at 12 and becoming the Ethical Slut that defined the Dark Ages.
    -   Venus would inadvertently become her own daughter's Primal Scene when Helia, wanting a bedtime story, saw Venus and Eric during 'adult stuff'.
    -   It's not explicitly confirmed but strongly implied that Celena the Shy, while hiding in a closet during hide and seek, catches Space and Fortuna having sex. Which is a serious crime, as it's Brother–Sister Incest. The resulting fallout is believed to have caused the stroke that killed Hesperia the Singer of Dusk.
-   _A Destroyer's Remorse_: Inverted; due to Poppy showing Nia scenes from Mio's life without understanding the context, Nia had to watch her daughter's Their First Time _more than once_.
-   _A Thing of Vikings_: Picknose, Mairwen and Signy find out the latter two's mom and the former's parents got together when they catch all three of their parents having sex...right as they were about to tell their parents that _they_ were in a relationship.

-   In _Rain Man_, Raymond walks in on Charlie and Suzanna making love, and as he doesn't understand what's going on, mimics their orgasmic moans until Charlie realizes he's in the room and snaps angrily at him.
-   In _Reality Bites_, one of the characters tells that this once happened to her.

-   Alluded to in _Dennis the Menace_, where the protagonist tells Mr. Wilson that his parents "wrestle" on weekends. Clearly, he's never figured it out.
-   In _Stepmom_, the already tense relationship between Jackie (the ex-wife) and Isabella (the titular character) gets even worse after Isabella sheepishly admits that daughter Anna walked in on her and Luke (the father) having a Shower of Love.
-   _The Initiation_: As a child, Kelly walked in on her mother and her lover mid-coitus. This scene branded itself in her mind and is constantly repeated in her nightmares.
-   At the end of _Deadly Advice_, it is revealed that Jodie had walked in on her father having sex with his lover on a trip to London. This is implied to have contributed to her delicate mental balance. Although probably not as much as her accidentally causing his death immediately afterward.
-   _Muddy River_: 10-year-old Kiichi lives on a dilapidated houseboat where his mother, a prostitute, entertains men. Kiichi and his friend Nobuo are hanging out on the houseboat when Nobuo looks through a window and sees Shoko having sex with a customer. It's a disturbing moment, with Nobuo making eye contact with Shoko as her john humps away. Nobuo makes a hurried exit.
-   _Blockers_: In the stinger, Kayla comes home and walks in on her parents playing the same sex game they saw Ron do with Cathy (which means Mitchell's nude). She screams in horror (they weren't actually having sex yet, but it's also obviously bad enough in her mind).

    Jokes 

-   A boy comes home and finds his parents having sex. When he asks what they're doing, his dad says "playing poker". Then, he finds his sister having sex with her boyfriend and asks what they're doing, and his sister gives the same answer. He then finds his brother masturbating and asks him what's doing and he gives the same answer. "But I thought you need two people for that?" the boys asks. "Not if you have a good hand" answers the brother.

    Literature 

-   In _The Da Vinci Code_, a version of this is the reason why the female protagonist had a falling-out with her grandfather. As a young girl, she walked in on him performing a sexual ritual. Langdon explains that her grandfather was part of a group that followed ancient pagan rites and believed that sex was the way to achieve enlightenment.
-   In _Memory_, Miles has a moment of surprise when he realizes his Aunt Alys (widowed since shortly before Miles's birth) has started sleeping with his former boss, ex-Spymaster Simon Illyan. When Alys's son Ivan finds out, he has reaction B, and the reader gets a nice dose of reaction C from the interplay. Unlike most instances of this trope, Miles and Ivan are adults. Ivan's reaction has more to do with: a) the fact that this is his _mother_ we're talking about, and b) the fact that _both_ Simon and Alys have public reputations for being extremely prim and proper (well, for Simon it's more "respectable" than "prim"), and what they're doing together is... not.
-   Robin in _The Tomorrow Series_ mentions this was how she last saw her parents.
-   Briefly discussed in _Head Count_ by Ingrid Noll: when Maya is in counseling after accidentally killing her brother, she makes up a dream about being a little bird that flies around and looks into people's windows. Her psychiatrist assumes that she must have walked in on her parents as a child.

-   Seemingly an isolated incident in J.R. Lowell's 1972 thriller _Daughter of Darkness_. Willie Connolly knows what sex is, that's not the problem; it's the idea of her beloved _parents_ going at it like animals. Yicch!
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_, one of the key events that sets the plot in motion in the first book, _A Game of Thrones_, is 7-year old Bran Stark climbing a castle tower and accidentally witnessing, through a window, the Queen having sex with her brother.
-   _Legacy of the Dragokin_: Daniar and Kalak express their love for each other right in front of Benji.
-   This is one of the catalysts to the big deception in _Atonement_. Briony encounters her older sister Cecilia having sex with her lover Robbie in the library. The two awkwardly leave the site upon discovery. Briony has already had her suspicions about Robbie due to several previous events that tell her Robbie is sexually abusing her sister, when in fact all the instances were consensual. Their discovery here is thus the final nail to the coffin that causes Briony to pin Robbie for revenge.
-   In _To Sir, with Love_, teacher Thackeray notices that something has happened to upset one of his students. When he speaks with the girl's mother, she sheepishly admits that the girl walked in on her and her boyfriend. (The girl adored her deceased father and is unhappy that her mother is embarking on a new relationship.)
-   One rather central to the plot occurs in _We Can't Rewind_. While the parents actually _did_ think to lock the door to their cabin, they forgot about the bathroom access running between their children's cabin and their own.
-   In _Life and Times of the Lightning Bolt Kid_, the author mentions once walking in on his parents, who give a flimsy excuse to get him to leave. Unlike most examples, he says it wasn't the traumatizing experience it's supposed to be.
-   A particular sinister version occurs in _The Ocean at the End of the Lane_, when the protagonist sees his father having sex with the new babysitter, Ursula Monkton, who the protagonist knows is actually an interdimensional monster. Being only seven, he doesn't even understand the significance of what he's seeing, only that it's very wrong. This actually works to his benefit, as he is able to escape the house while the monster is distracted and get the attention of someone who knows how to deal with it.
-   In _Leia, Princess of Alderaan_, a young Leia uses the palace's secret passageways to spy on her parents, hoping to hear them talk about her birthday presents. Instead, she hears extremely suggestive flirting, and leaves just in time to "avoid a very unwelcome lesson about what spouses do in their private hours." It's more of a Downplayed Trope, as sex is never explicitly mentioned and she didn't actually see the act, but it's still enough to put her off of using the secret passageways, and she's still mortified by the memory years later when she's using them to eavesdrop on conversations about the Rebellion.
-   Conversational Troping in _Bless Me Father_ when Father Duddleswell, quizzing Father Neil on the Church's views on contraception, asks if this is an appropriate excuse for _coitus interruptus_. Father Neil manages to avoid answering.

        **Kitty:** Oh! Oh, Red!  
        **Red:** Oh, Kitty!
        
    -   Used more than once too, as later in the series, Eric casually walks into the kitchen, where his parents are playing an "adult" version of Marco Polo (don't ask).
    -   Inverted in an episode when _everyone_ walks in on Eric and Donna going at it on the kitchen table. Red and Kitty later are seen scrubbing the table with a mixture of bleach and lighter fluid, then deciding that they need a new table.
        
        **Donna (offscreen):** OH! MY! GOD!  
        **Hyde:** Alright! Donna’s butt!  
        **Red:** Dammit! That's where I eat dinner!
        
-   In an episode of _Sex and the City_, Brady sees Harry and Charlotte having sex. Charlotte freaks out and calls Miranda, panicking and convinced that she has damaged the boy for life.

-   On _Desperate Housewives_, Gaby and Carlos are having blind sex (he is blind, she's wearing a blindfold). Gaby hears a sound, rips off the blindfold and, lo and behold, there is Juanita drinking from a juice box. They don't know how long Juanita has been there, either.
-   _Degrassi Junior High_ has Arthur walk in on his father in bed with his new partner Carol. Arthur was already apprehensive about his father's new relationship, but this makes him even more resentful.

-   _Friends_:
    -   Monica first found a videotape of her parents having sex (complete with "Oh, Jack" and "Oh, Judy"). Then a few episodes later, she was hiding from her parents in the bathroom when both walk in and, well, this quote pretty much sums it up:
        
        **Ross**: Mon? Mon, are you okay?  
        **Monica**: Remember that video I found of Mom and Dad?  
        **Ross**: Yeah?  
        **Monica**: Well, I just caught the live show.

        "Why is Daddy hurting Mommy? Wait, he's not hurting Mommy, he's loving Mommy."
        
    -   Then there's the time he walked in on his brother and Mimi having sex. He had his kitchen _bricked off_ and his couch _**sent out to be exorcised**_.
-   In an episode of _Oliver Beene_, Oliver walked in on his parents doing the deed, but they placated him by claiming to have been playing some sort of game. The narration notes:
    
    Years later, I realized I had walked in on my parents having sex and was appropriately disgusted. Back then, I was just glad they'd managed to make up so we could be a family again.
    
-   In _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_, Will walks into his mother's room, and finds her in bed with his fiancée's father. For extra shock points, this was _on the day before the wedding_. Amusingly, after first meeting one another, they nearly came to blows.
-   In _Six Feet Under_, Nate's daughter Maya sees him and Brenda having sex and starts jumping up and down.
-   In the first episode of _Titus_, a misunderstood message causes Erin to walk in on her parents.
    
    **Titus**: Your dad isn't dead.  
    **Erin**: Yeah, I know. Otherwise, what I walked in on my mother doing to him would've been so sick!
    
-   An episode of _Ready or Not_ revolved around sexuality, beginning with Amanda walking into her parents shagging it out.
-   _Torchwood_ has the adult version when Gwen walks in on Jack and Ianto. In a hothouse. Hilarity Ensues.
-   Pictured above: On _Modern Family_, Phil and Claire's kids walk in on them having sex, which traumatizes both Claire and the kids, while Phil tries to deal with it humorously. Afterward, the kids cope pretty straightforwardly with what they saw, but are horrified all over again on realizing that their parents will insist on _talking about it._ The kids buy a lock for the bedroom door so it never happens again...but The Stinger reveals that the rather loud noise of the lock quickly becomes a horrible Pavlovian trigger.
-   _The King of Queens_: Doug and Carrie look after Deacon and Kelly's kids at their apartment while they're out of town. One of the kids walk in on Doug and Carrie having sex and draws a picture of it.

-   Referenced in this scene from _Eastbound & Down_.
-   _30 Rock_:
    -   Nancy Donovan has given at least two different excuses to her children when they walked in on her. She comments to Jack that they walk in a lot, but doesn't specify how much "a lot" is.
    -   Thinking her plane is about to crash, Liz also relives the time she walked in on her grandparents having sex. That said, it wasn't the sight itself that emblazoned itself on her memory so much as just knowing that she didn't look away immediately.
-   _Mad Men_:
    -   Sally Draper sees her step-grandmother giving a blowjob to her Honorary Uncle Roger Sterling. Given that she's pretty precocious (despite being only 12 or 13, she's more aware than the average girl her age, and has been masturbating for at least a year), she doesn't seem to be particularly scarred—merely astonished and kinda disgusted.
    -   Much earlier, Sally and her little brother Bobby also walked in on their parents having sex once, which Don and Betty awkwardly explained as "Mommy and Daddy are...sleeping..." When Sally later sees a picture of Paul Kinsey's girlfriend, she asks him "Do you kiss her? Do you lay on top of her?"
    -   Later, however, Sally walks in on her father having sex with the upstairs neighbor. While not necessarily disturbed by the act itself, she is appropriately outraged and disappointed that he would cheat on Megan like that.
-   In _Single Father_, six-year-old Evie walks in on her recently-widowed father in bed with her dead mom's best friend. While Evie doesn't tell anyone and probably doesn't _actually_ understand what happened, she does say that her dad and Sarah "really like hugs" with a look that says she probably at least knows that they were doing something inappropriate.
-   On _Once Upon a Time_, Emma Swan and her son Henry walk in on Snow and Charming in bed. Henry is only eleven and is oblivious, asking why they're sleeping in the afternoon. Emma is scarred for life because while they are about the same age because of a magic curse, they're still **her parents**. Said parents seem amused by the incident, probably because they weren't actually "busy" when their daughter and grandson walked in, just in bed. They had just _finished_ being "busy" though, and were clearly post-coital, with a Modesty Bedsheet, so it was pretty close. And it's their fault for putting their marital bed in the same room as the kitchen and front door.
    
    **Charming**: It's impressive that we can still provide her with a few traumatic childhood memories at this stage of the game.
    
-   In the _Misfits_ episode where Curtis nearly starts a Zombie Apocalypse, Rudy reveals that he is afraid of cheerleaders because, when he walked in on his parents having sex, his mother was dressed as a cheerleader.
-   One _Psych_ episode involves Shawn (and his mom) moving back in with his dad to help Henry recover after being shot. At one point, Shawn walks in on his divorced parents having sex. The scene then cuts to him curled up in bed like a traumatized child would after witnessing such a thing. His father also tries to have what sounds suspiciously like "the talk" with Shawn.
-   This is how Viva, the main character of _Some Girls_ discovered her father's relationship with her new gym teacher: she walked in to see Anna riding Rob in the living room and immediately shut the door in disgust. Luckily for Viva, both Anna and Rob were clothed but poor Viva still can't stand Anna.
-   In the second-season premiere of _The Americans_, poor Paige walks in on her parents performing mutual oral sex on each other.
-   Discussed in the _Veronica Mars_ episode "The Wrath of Con"; while playing "I Never", Duncan asks if any of them have seen their parents having sex. Lily drinks, and describes how she walked into her parents' room to borrow her mother's sweater and saw her parents. Interestingly enough, Duncan is more freaked out about this than Lily was.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_:
    -   Sheldon pays a surprise visit to his mother. He glances through the front window and sees, as he puts it, "Mommy with a naked man and trying to be a mommy again."
    -   When he was thirteen, Sheldon walked in on his father cheating with another woman. Neither of them ever brought it up. (It also explains why he always knocks three times: the second and third knocks gives time to put one's pants back on.)
    -   In another episode, Leonard's mother mentions a childhood incident where young Leonard walked in on his mother swatting his father with Leonard's ping-pong paddle.
        
        **Leonard:** I didn't _dream_ that?!?

To add to Mellie's further humiliation, she runs after her angry and traumatized daughter half-dressed, only to encounter a shocked Olivia (whom she often calls "whore"), who was walking past said room at the time and witnessed everything.
-   _Schitt's Creek_: David walks into his parents' room and witnesses his parents having sex. He's not only horrified, he scolds them for attempting "that" position at that time of day.
-   One _The Whitest Kids U' Know_ sketch has this having happened as the premise ("This is why knocking is so important"). The dad's attempts to do The Talk with his daughter are complicated by the fact that she didn't walk in on him having sex with her mother... she walked in on him having sex with a _donkey_.
-   In _Life in Pieces_, Matt walks in on his parents having sex on their couch. Later they decide to go to a more private location...which is above his bedroom in the garage, and he can hear them through the very thin floor.
-   In an episode of _Family Matters_, after Laura and Steve can't look at each other when Laura walks in on Steve in the shower (this was after Steve moved in with the Winslows), Eddie puts things into perspective for them:
    
    "When I was 8, I walked in on Mom and Dad. If I can get over _that_, you two can get over _this_!"
    
-   On _Soul Food_, Kenny and Maxine go at it in the kitchen. Just as they're climaxing, they look up to see their son watching them, frozen in horror.
-   One of the most notorious and controversial examples in British TV history was in _The Singing Detective_, when the protagonist Philip Marlow, as a boy, catches his mother having adulterous sex in a forest. The experience is implied to leave him with permanent psychological damage.
-   In a scene which seems potentially inspired by _The Singing Detective_, Vanessa Ives' psychological and spiritual problems in _Penny Dreadful_ begin when, as a young girl, she catches her mother having adulterous sex with their next-door neighbour, the father of Vanessa's best friend, in the garden.
-   A milder version on _Different Strokes_, when Arnold encounters Philip's current girlfriend in the hallway. Despite his young age, he realizes exactly what's going on, given the early morning hour and the fact that she's only wearing a nightgown.
-   _Frasier_:
    -   A mild version occurs when Frasier asks Martin how his date went, only to have the woman in question walk into the room, thus revealing that she spent the night.
    -   Niles actually (off screen) walks in on his father and Sherry. They start avoiding each other for a while.
-   _Sisters_. Two of the girls walk in on their mother and her companion Truman basking in the afterglow. In another episode, Cat (daughter of second-oldest sister Teddy) tells her mother that she overheard her and her father the previous night (they grew closer while taking care of Cat after her rape and debated reconciling).
-   _NCIS_: Tony walks in on his father and his neighbor in _his_ bed, once again resetting the clock on their attempts at reconciliation. (For added Squick, years later, viewers learn there was a friggin CORPSE under the floorboards under the bed).
-   _The Sinner_: Narrowly averted; Julian almost walks in on his parents having sex in their motel room, but the door is closed. Later it turns out they aren't really his parents though.
-   In an early episode of _Married... with Children_, Al is trying to seduce Peggy (!) on the couch when he stops, worrying about the kids walking in. Peggy promptly calls out to the kids to come and help her fix dinner. After hearing the sound of slamming doors, they smile and get back to business, knowing that this _won't_ be happening.

    Video Games 

-   _Kana: Little Sister_:
    -   Kana once catches her brother Taka and his friend Yumi having sex. Aaaaaawkward.
    -   Or the other way around, with Kana and Taka being caught by Yumi.
-   A dramatic variant in _The Last Birdling_, when one of the child protagonists, Tayo, walks in on her mother being raped. The player then gets a choice between killing the man or just scaring him off.
-   A funny machinima made with _The Sims 3_ milks this trope for all it's worth.
-   In _Psychonauts_, it is revealed that as a kid, government agent Sasha Nein read his father's thoughts to see what his Missing Mom was like. It doesn't end well. A pretty tragic example, seeing as he was just remembering the woman he loved and it causes Sasha to freak out so badly he runs away from home.
-   _You Don't Know Jack: The Ride_ includes a question, based on the idea that Steven Seagal movies all have three syllables (_Under Siege_, _Hard to Kill_, et. al.) and asks the contestant(s) to identify the likely plot to a Seagal movie named _Primal Scene_ (the correct answer, of course, being the outline of this trope). At the end of the round, players are treated to someone impersonating Seagal's voice and acting style and blandly exclaiming, "Oh no, mom and dad are wrestling!"
-   A variant (photographs taken at the time by a third party, seen after the event) occurs in Meet The Spy... Sort of. It's probably quicker to watch than to try and explain.

    -   In _South Park: The Stick of Truth_, when the player is shrunk by the Underpants Gnomes, he chases them down to his parents' bedroom just as they're having sex and culminates to a boss battle right under them as they're doing the deed (including having to dodge your dad's wildly-swinging testes during the fight). You get an achievement if you simply stay and watch them for an entire minute.
    -   In _South Park: The Fractured but Whole_, this is part of the New Kid's in-universe superhero backstory; the sight of catching the man he trusted fucking the woman he loved caused him to devote his life to fighting crime. Near the end, you actually travel back to this point in time, where you can stop your parents having sex. However, The Stinger shows them going to the bedroom to have some private time, which Professor Chaos uses to convince them to become a bad guy.
-   Kari from _Dead In Vinland_ can potentially walk in on her aunt Moira having sex with Yaghoub... in HER bed. Her reaction: "BY LOKI'S DICK WHAT THE HELL?"

    Webcomics 

-   It happens (NSFW) in _Sexy Losers_ (the strip is even titled "Primal Scene"), and being _SL_, it wasn't your garden-variety sex either...
-   _Entropy Max_: This strip<small>◊</small> from the _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Strike Out_ Fan Webcomic by Entropy Max.
-   Happened to Faye from _Questionable Content_.
    -   Marten is apparently fine with his professional dominatrix mother describing her sessions with clients. But if she's talking about his dad...

-   _Roomies!, It's Walky!, Joyce and Walky!_: In _It's Walky!_ Ruth gets the surprise of her life when runs home in an emergency only to find her father the doctor (who always told her to "act with integrity") screwing the mother of the little girl she was babysitting.
-   _El Goonish Shive_ implies that Broken Bird Susan's various issues stem from when she was traumatized as a little girl by accidentally walking in on her father and a woman who was not her mother, though the true psychological damage probably occurred when he asked her to lie about it. It certainly didn't help matters that Susan was then raised solely by her mother, who seems to have lost all faith in men as a result of the affair.
-   Rachel is shocked when she walks in on her mum and dad in this _Ladies In Waiting_ strip, but only by how bad they are at leapfrog.
-   _The Non-Adventures of Wonderella_: Wonderella walks in on her parents having sex. Except her "father" is a vaguely Greco-Roman godhead made up of an amalgamation of a number of different gods and goddesses, so it's really not clear what she saw. While she's busy trying to repress everything, the godhead comes over and tries to talk it out. It doesn't go well.
    
    **Godhead:** Wonderella do you realize the inherent fallacy in praying for your own death when a collection of deities is only trying to tell you how much we love you.
    

    Web Original 

-   In the flash film Nin10Doh! by 'Kirbopher', Ness walks past a porno theater. Being psychic, he is reduced to a quivering wreck on his bed.
    
    **Ness**: Everything... I could hear... everything... they were thinking!  
    **Poo**: Oh, the poor child.
    
    -   Made even funnier if you recall Itoi's explanation for Giygas: when he was a child, he walked in on a movie sex scene that ended in murder, mistook it for a rape scene, and when he reached adulthood, he channeled his childhood shock and terror into Giygas.

    Western Animation 

-   Invoked in the _American Dad!_ episode "I Am the Walrus"; Steve is trying to usurp Stan's role as the Alpha Male of the house, so Stan tricks Steve into walking in on him and Francine being intimate since only the Alpha has the right to mate. After Not What It Looks Like, he tells Steve that the fact that he mates and Steve doesn't proves he's still top dog. Then he chases Steve out of the room while yelping like a Walrus.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   In "The Son Also Draws":
        
        **Lois:** Now, you shouldn't be frightened, Stewie. What you saw was actually a very beautiful thing.  
        **Stewie:** Evidently, madam, you and I differ _greatly_ in our conception of beauty.
        
    -   There also the episode focusing on Lois's brother, Patrick, who as a child saw his mom having sex with Jackie Gleason. As a result, he went crazy, was shipped off to a mental hospital (at a young age, no less), and developed a pathological hatred for obese people. So much so he goes on a murder spree when Lois temporarily releases him (of course, Peter's idiocy is also to blame).
        
        **Jackie Gleason**: Pow! Right in the kisser!
        
    -   A variant is the one where Peter & Lois decide to have sex in his office.
        
        **Peter:** Opie's right there.  
        **Lois:** I want him to look, Peter. _\[Opie runs away in terror\]_
        
    -   The episode "North By North Quahog" has Peter and Lois going at it while showing Chris and Meg cowering in their own beds, just wanting it to be over. Only the bed squeaks can be heard, but they've been through it enough to know what's going on. Stewie is already asleep and is dreaming that he is in a rocking chair that is making the same squeaking noise.
    -   In the "Point of Stew" segment of "Family Guy Viewer Mail #2", Stewie falls asleep and dreams that Peter and Lois are lumberjacks taking turns at chopping down a tree. When Peter finishes up, he asks if he did good, and Lois half-heartedly says he did. We then see her pull out a chainsaw to finish chopping down the tree while a slow vibrating sound is heard.
    -   In the episode "White Meg Can't Jump," Stewie walks in on Peter and Lois, causing him to faint and his spirit to leave his body. That spirit then sees the scene again and the spirit of David Hyde Pierce leaves that. The event left Stewie's psyche fratured, and he spends the rest of the episode with Multiple Personality Disorder.

    -   In another episode, Bart walks in on his parents again, worried about having seen a UFO - he doesn't figure out what they were doing, but both Homer and Marge scream "Don't turn on the light!" in panic as they cover themselves with the pillows.
    -   Also happens in "The Haw-Hawed Couple", when Bart and Lisa walked in on Homer and Marge 'Snuggling', despite the boombox playing the fake argument tape Homer and Marge made, leaving Bart traumatized. He then gets some perspective from Milhouse: "Trust me, Bart, it's better to walk in on both your parents instead of just one of them."
    -   In "A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love", after Homer injects himself with a tonic that gives himself a stamina boost, he carries Marge to their bedroom, and they make love.

-   _South Park_:
    -   There are quite a few times when Cartman is exposed to his mother's oft-mentioned promiscuity, though usually through seemingly blank video tapes. The most memorable example came from The Movie, when the boys are on the internet and stumble on a German porno.
        
        **Kyle:** Dude, it's a lady getting pooed on!

    -   On the flipside is Milo, whose room is right next to his parents', who can't sleep at all without the sound of his parents' lovemaking to act as white noise. When Bob gets his genitals stepped on in an accident, the following two weeks of healing result in Milo not getting any sleep _at all_.
