**Burger King Cashier:** Welcome to Burger King. May I take your order?  
**Hooper:** We're C.I.A. agents, and we require asylum. You know, 'cause this is American soil?  
**Burger King Cashier:** I grew up in a pile of straw. The only education I have is one week of Burger King training, and even _I_ know that's not how the international justice system works.

Just because a character is dumb doesn't mean that they don't know anything, they're completely incompetent at doing something right, they believe everything they see or hear, they're easily impressed with everything, or they can't understand how dangerous something is. Once in a while, this character will bring up their low intelligence and point out that they at least have some common sense.

This is when a character who is established to be dumb or not as smart as their colleague feels that, while they may not be all that bright, even they aren't _that_ stupid. The character has to acknowledge their low intelligence in any shape or form. It is also okay for a character to acknowledge another character for being dumb but not that stupid. Also, the character doesn't necessarily have to be dumb, it could also be a character who just lacks the knowledge for a certain subject but has common sense about it or someone who is naive. This could also apply to someone with a disability, like blindness or a mental disorder as examples, where they point out that their disability does not affect their intelligence or common sense. This can also apply to elders who are viewed as Scatterbrained Senior but can still prove they can still understand what's going on around them.

They may say it in response to an accusation of them doing something really stupid. They may also say it when they see someone do or say something that even they think is dumb. Sometimes they might feel insulted when people would think their intelligence is that low. They might even reveal some Hidden Depths about their intelligence.

This will usually lead to Hypocrisy Nod and Self-Deprecation. Compare Too Dumb to Fool, who is dumb, but not gullible, Smarter Than You Look, for when somebody appears to be dumb but they're not, and Good Is Not Dumb, when someone who is good gets underestimated because of it. The inverse is Who Would Be Stupid Enough?, for when somebody _really is_ that dumb. Murphy's Law (the original one) points out that you can't rely on this, because _someone, somewhere_ is that dumb. See Dumbass Has a Point.

This is often the argument against the Idiot Plot.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Attack on Titan_, when rescuing Eren while numerous Titans are in the area, Krista insists to Connie that he leaves her behind with Ymir, who claims that her captors will kill her if she doesn't come along with them. Connie doubts the claim and even points out that an idiot like him can see how dangerous their current situation is.
    
    **Connie:** Well, I don't know how exactly Ymir is going to get killed, but you guys calm down a bit. No matter how you think about it, the chances of the both of you dying are higher if you stay here now, right? Even an idiot like me can understand that much.
    
-   _Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire_:
    -   The Team Rocket trio never fails to fool Ash and company with their Paper Thin Disguises. But they push their luck too far in "Do I Hear A Ralts?" when they recycle the Kirlia and Gardevoir disguises that were exposed _earlier in the same episode._ Even the twerps are rather insulted by how poor this ruse is. Naturally, Jessie and Meowth are blasted off by the Ralts they wanted to steal, while James runs afoul of the Ralts' family and follows moments later.
    -   Played with in "A Double Dilemma", Team Rocket use an especially poor disguise to pose as May and Max's family (Jessie and James make a reasonable imitation of Norman and Caroline, but _Meowth and Wobbuffet_ blatantly look nothing like their human kids). The twerps and even Team Rocket themselves lampshade this was pretty shabby even by their standards, though the residents of North Petalberg, to punctuate how especially dumb and bull-headed they are, fall for it hook, line and sinker.

    Jokes 

-   Old joke: A man's car loses a wheel outside an insane asylum. He puts the spare wheel on but realizes he's lost the bolts. One of the inmates yells at him from a window to remove a bolt from the other three wheels and drive slowly until he finds an auto shop. The man thanks him and asks what he's doing in an asylum if he's not crazy. The inmate then says that no, he's crazy, he's just not stupid.
    -   A very similar variant of the story has the driver face a bridge that is just a bit too low to drive under, to which the inmate advises to let air off the tires and pump them back on the other side.

    Literature 

-   _Artemis Fowl_: Opal Koboi has her none-too-bright henchmen the Brill brothers convinced to the point of paranoia that she can read minds, simply by turning on them at random and shrieking "I heard that!". Mervall Brill at one point tests her by thinking treasonous thoughts at her as loudly as possible.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   _Monstrous Regiment_:
        -   Shufti is the least worldly of all the characters, having disguised herself as a boy to look for her fiancé who'd left her pregnant. She's repeatedly shown to be painfully naive, like believing the guy had been mislaid when she'd given him a sixpence to split in half, or missing the Double Entendre of a Bawdy Song. However, she does get a moment once the squad is captured and accused of being soldiers disguised as women by hiking up her skirt and flashing the officer. Polly then asks the officer with icy politeness if he needs the _rest_ of the squad to strip down as well, and they're quickly left alone out of sheer embarrassment.
            
            **Shufti:** I'm not clever, but I'm not stupid.
            
        -   Carborundum (or rather, Jade) makes some very good points about warfare (particularly the total war that Borogravia has managed to get itself into), adding that trolls "may be slow but we ain't stoopid."
    -   _Lords and Ladies_ also has a one-off gag about a troll guarding a bridge on the border with Lancre, who is noted to be immediately, instinctively suspicious any time someone leads a billygoat across.
        
        "Trolls might not be all that quick on the uptake but they don't forget in a hurry either."
        
-   In the Xanth novel _Ogre, Ogre_, one of the challenges Smash faces to get in to Humfrey's castle is a basilisk which Smash recognizes and blocks the view of. The reader is told that ogres are stupid but not suicidal.

-   In one episode of _Two and a Half Men_, Alan gets audited by the IRS. After a series of misadventures between Charlie and Jake, Alan's son, Alan comes home and tells Charlie:
    
    **Alan:** You know why I was being audited? Not because I have unsubstantiated deductions, which I have. Not because I take the occasional cash payment from a client, and forget to report it, which I do. It was because _no one_ at the IRS could believe I was paying as much alimony as I claimed. It took me three hours to convince them that, yes, I am that big a _shmuck_!

    **Derby**: Why are you wearing yellow?  
    **Adam**: Because the thing Echo and I have is... complicated.  
    **Slab**: You and Echo don't have anything. That doesn't seem complicated at all. Even to _me_.
    
-   _The Good Place_: Jason is quite possibly one of the dumbest people to have ever lived, and received a lousy education on top of that.

-   _Cheers:_

    -   Post-Flanderization Rebecca at one point manages to stop Cliff inflicting his inane comedy routine on the bar by suggesting he take it to a stand-up club and inflict it on _them_ instead, the tiniest glimpse of her original intelligence.

Godbrand's only complaint is he finds the comment confusing as he is a Viking. He likes making boats out of things. He wonders why it is prudent to send forces to watch the Belmont estate when word reaches them one might be alive. A reminder is given that the Belmonts have hunted vampires for "fucking centuries" and have amassed God knows how much information on the vampires and Dracula. If one is alive, he could prove a nasty thorn in their plans. And Godbrand still has a hard time understanding these facts. Dracula himself accuses Godbrand of being more bark than bite. That said, Godbrand is the only vampire general who directly questions where the vampires would get food if Dracula succeeds in killing all of humanity. He also realizes Dracula hasn't been feeding for a while and isn't as strong as he used to be, having lost himself and his will to live with the death of his human wife. Even sensing this weakness, Godbrand refuses to directly challenge Dracula in combat because he knows, weakened or not, he wouldn't survive the fight.
