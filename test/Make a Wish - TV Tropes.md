_"The evening star is shining bright,  
So make a wish, and hold on tight,  
There's magic in the air tonight,  
And anything could happen..."_

When you wish upon a star... Oh, right. Characters in stories always want something; it's one of the rules of fiction. Some heroes work very hard in pursuit of their dreams, some use wit and charm, but a few look up to the nearest star and make a longing, desperate wish.

It always comes true.

Wishing has power in fiction; it's one of the main sources of Applied Phlebotinum. No matter what you want, from a new car to a sudden age-up, you can get it by wishing. Of course, you have to Be Careful What You Wish For and make sure that if you want to be special, normal, or want someone out of your life, that you actually mean exactly what you say. Good or evil, the wish-granter is almost always a Literal Genie who will gladly warp reality for the heck of it.

The best-known wish-granter is probably the Genie in a Bottle (or other similar magical creatures) who generally grants Three Wishes. If he's lucky, the hero will get a Benevolent Genie; unlucky ones will have a Literal Genie or even a Jackass Genie.

Other wishing methods, generally only resulting in one wish, include:

-   Wishing on a star
-   Seeing a shooting star
-   Wishing wells
-   Birthday candles and/or wishbones, which generally come with a proviso that telling anyone the wish means it won't come true
-   Some sort of magic wish tool (like a monkey's paw)
-   A lunar/solar eclipse
-   Any number of other things, like blowing on an eyelash, blowing the seeds off a dandelion, or blowing on wishing/pixie dust
-   The power of words

If the story begins with a wish being granted, the wisher may discover they don't like the way things are going and will use another wish to hit a Reset Button. If after all the wishes have been used up, the wisher ends up no better off, they've been Wasteful Wishing. Big wishes may end in a Wishplosion.

If, on the other hand, the story was a Quest for a Wish and the wish is granted at the end after many trials have been overcome to earn the right to make it, it's much more likely to result in a Happily Ever After.

The final shot may reveal that the wish story was All Just a Dream (Or Was It a Dream?), but some stories are much more subtle and leave it up to the audience whether the "wishes" really came true or were just a string of marvelous coincidences.

Subtropes include It's a Wonderful Plot, I Wish It Were Real, Wishing Well, and Wishing for More Wishes. Also, see Mundane Wish for the comic version. Often involves a Reality Warp.

Not to be confused with Make-A-Wish Contribution or the Disney Channel movie of the same name.

    Advertising 

-   In this Subway commercial a man wishes on a star and his girlfriend turns into a Subway sandwich.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ah! My Goddess_ has this as the central device that begins the story.
-   _Dragon Ball_: Anyone who gathers all seven Dragon Balls will be able to summon Shenron and have a wish granted. The first arc revolved around a quest to find them, facilitated by the Dragon Radar built by Bulma. They would rarely feature at the center of the series afterwards but were an ever-present background element, and once the heroes were able to fly around the world at incredible speeds the Dragon Radar made finding them a minor chore that took a few hours at most, so they were often used as a Reset Button to undo the villain's damage.
-   In _Eiga Tamagotchi: Himitsu no Otodoke Dai Sakusen!_, this is why Spacytchi wants the package the Tama-Friends are delivering to the Gotchi King; he thinks the egg contained within will hatch into a being that can grant any wish of his choosing and he wants to use that wish to conquer Tamagotchi Planet; the egg doesn't contain any such creature, though.
-   In _Eureka Seven_, most of the things Renton wished for in the early episodes eventually came true (be good at reffing, getting an adventurous life, wanted Eureka as his girlfriend, wanting to hear Holland's "first love" story (episode 7), to see his father and sister, taking Eureka away to a distant place along with her (episode 30), stop the war, kissing Eureka, etc). Ironically, the last episode is titled "Wish Upon A Star", whereby the 3 kids and Renton's grandpa makes a wish upon the stars in the ending.
    -   In the movie version ending, Eureka gets to have her long time wish came true: become human.
-   In _Fushigi Yuugi_, the Priestess gets Three Wishes from whichever Beast God she summons. There _are_ some catches, however: although _technically_, she _can_ wish for anything she wants, she's _supposed_ to use her wishes for the greater good, not for her own gain. Also, she is to remain a virgin until she summons the Beast God. And lastly, if she is deemed to be not strong enough, or not pure enough, she will be completely devoured by the Beast God in question. (This process begins as soon as she summons the god and makes her first wish.)
-   _The Lucifer and Biscuit Hammer_ has its Mentor Mascots offering a wish in exchange for service in becoming Knights to battle a being that wants to destroy the world. The wish itself is granted in good faith, but it is possible to squander it.
-   The Jewel Seeds in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_ were able to grant the wishes of the Muggles who gets a hold of them. They tend to grant these wishes by way of a new Monster of the Week.
-   _Mermaid Saga_: eating the flesh of a mermaid is said to grant one wish: immortality. Actually _getting_ immortality is extremely rare. More common is becoming horribly mutated and insane, and much, much more common is the usual result of trying this: dropping dead.
-   In _Pokémon: The Series_, Jirachi is a cute Fun Size Mythical Pokémon that has the power to grant wishes. A Jirachi features prominently as the featured Mon of the sixth movie, _Pokémon: Jirachi: Wish Maker_. On top of that, the ending theme for the said movie is called "Make A Wish".
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ has Weasel Mascot Kyubey offering a wish in exchange to turn girls into Magical Girls to fight Witches. He's a Literal Genie and the wishes have a price that he doesn't elaborate on but the miracles are genuine. As a little bonus, Madoka's Grief Seed has a shooting star on it.
-   Yuuko Ichihara's shop in _xxxHOLiC_ sells wishes, for something of equal value to what is being wished for.

     Comic Strips 

-   Very early in the _Thimble Theater_ strip, Popeye would stroke the head feathers of a wish-granting creature called a Wiffle Bird and wish for the strength to defeat his foes (soon changing to eating spinach). Much later the Wiffle Bird would appear in the Al Brodax Popeye cartoons to grant wishes to anyone.

    Fan Works 

-   _No Plumbers Allowed_: In a moment of desperation, Taylor makes a wish on a star for the ability to make a difference. The star, actually a Luma, considers this before granting her the ability to make technology from the Mario franchise.
-   In the _Gunslinger Girl_ fanfic _Porcupine Love_, Triela is visiting the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, where traditionally you can make a wish while spinning your heel on the testicles of the bull mosaic on the floor. Triela does this on a whim and finds herself facing Pinocchio, who's standing in line with everyone else to do the same. After chasing him down they end up in bed together, so it's left ambiguous whether Triela's wish involved finding the teenage assassin she's sworn to kill, or experiencing love before she dies.

    Fairy Tales 

-   Any story that features a genie (_Aladdin_, many tales in the _Arabian Nights_)
-   In "Sweet Porridge", wishing to never go hungry results in a family getting a pot that cooks porridge, with specific words to make it stop and go. When someone uses the pot but doesn't know the words that stop it, this results in a massive flood of hot porridge (or sweet soup, depending on the story) before somebody says the words that make it stop.
-   In "The Fisherman and His Wife", a fisherman gets three wishes granted to him by a magic fish because he spares it rather than catching it. The fisherman and his wife are arguing about how to use the three wishes granted them; the wife wastes the first one on wishing for a sausage, which ends with the husband getting fed up and saying "I wish that sausage was on your nose!" and then having to use the last wish as a Reset Button.
    -   There is a similar Russian tale. In that one, the fish offers a poor fisherman unlimited wishes. The man himself is perfectly satisfied with his life as is, but his greedy wife keeps asking him to make grander and grander wishes (on her behalf), which eventually ends up with her becoming queen. However, still not satisfied with this, she demands to be made Mistress of the Seas and command the fish itself, which is not only refusing to grant but also revokes all the previous wishes, leaving the wife with nothing. In another version, the fish does indeed make her Empress of the Seven Seas, but when she wishes to be God the fish simply tells her that it _can't_ grant that wish, and then revokes all the previous wishes.
-   In Hans Christian Andersen's "The Little Mermaid", the mermaid in question sells her voice to the sea witch in order to get a wish for legs. After she fails to seduce him, her sisters sell their hair to kill the prince that caused her to make the wish and save her life. In some folklore, Mermaids are themselves able to grant wishes.
-   In "The Monkey's Paw", the wishes made by the poor couple may or may not have been granted other than the first one which definitely was... but not as they hoped.
-   In Japanese folklore, it's said that folding 1,000 paper cranes or 100 stars will allow you to make one wish.

    Films — Animation 

-   Disney is loaded with examples (some cross over into folklore):
    -   _Aladdin_, with a genie in a lamp.
    -   _Chicken Little_ has the star fall on Little, revealed to be the panel of a spaceship.
    -   _DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp_, with another genie in a lamp.
    -   In _Enchanted_, the villainess lures Giselle to the portal between her world and ours by saying it's a wishing well. (A Shout-Out to _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_, where the Witch tricks Snow White into eating the poisoned apple by telling her it's a wishing apple.)
    -   _Lilo & Stitch_, with Lilo wishing on a shooting star for a friend. That star turns out to be a crashing spaceship carrying Experiment 626.
    -   _Pinocchio,_ on a star.
    -   _The Princess and the Frog_, both the heroine and her best friend make wishes on the evening star, although it's left ambiguous whether it's really the power of the star granting the wish or not. Also, one of the movie's messages is it's not just wishing, but hard work, that makes your dreams come true.
    -   _Snow White_, in a wishing well.
-   In _Ice Age: Collision Course_, the guys mistake a meteor shower for shooting stars, one of which hit Sid and send him flying into a tree.
    
    **Manny:** Hey, look! Shooting stars!  
    **Sid:** Quick, make a wish! You gotta make a— _(gets hit)_ _WIIIIIIIISH!_  
    **Manny:** Wow, my wish came true.  
    **Sid:** I'm okay! _(spontaneously combusts)_  
    **Diego:** Mine, too.
    
-   In _Shrek Forever After_, the movie starts with Fiona wishing on a star for "every day to be like this one." Cue a "Groundhog Day" Loop and Shrek's midlife crisis.
    -   Shrek himself makes a wish 'to be an ogre for one day' (i.e., to be able to behave just like he used to before he met Fiona, without remorse, ruining his new reputation, or having her scold him). Just one day, for old times' sake. He even gets it. Unfortunately, it was granted by means of a Magically-Binding Contract, with the antagonist pushing it almost into Deal with the Devil territory, given his Loophole Abuse of the One-day-for-one-day Equivalent Exchange meant to erase Shrek from existence.
-   In _Turbo_, the title character, a snail, wishes on a star to be fast. The star turns out to be an airplane, yet another reminder of his lack of speed. He nevertheless gets his wish.

-   The made for tv movie _Whiskers_ is about a boy who has a misunderstanding with his parents thinking they want to get rid of his pet cat, so he makes a wish on a star to turn his cat into a boy.

-   This concept is referenced in the brief spoken-word intro to the song "Pure Imagination" in _Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory_: "Hold your breath. Make a wish. Count to three." (The song and dialogue also appears in the otherwise-new score of the 2013 stage musical version of the source novel, which also has its own take on this trope — see below.)
-   The MacGuffin of _Wonder Woman 1984_ is the Dreamstone which will grant a wish for anyone who holds it. Diana thinks it's a fake until her One True Love comes back from the dead, and she realises too late it's an Artifact of Doom that has destroyed civilizations. Unfortunately a media-friendly businessman has gotten hold of the Dreamstone, wished that _he_ had its power, and now intends to grant the wishes of the entire world.

    Literature 

### By Author:

-   Edward Eager's children's fantasy novels:
    -   _The Well-Wishers_ centers around a well that may or may not be magical and grant wishes.
    -   _Half Magic_ centers around four siblings finding a magic coin that grants wishes by half (e.g. if you wished for a house, you'd get half a house).
    -   _Seven-Day Magic_ centers around a library book that grants literature-related wishes.
-   In a Shel Silverstein poem, the protagonist received a wish from a goblin and used it to wish for two more wishes - lather, rinse, repeat. He eventually died without ever having used even a single wish for anything _worthwhile_. ("In a world of apples, and kisses and shoes/He wasted his wishes on wishing.")

### By Title:

-   _Bigfoot and Littlefoot_: In the first book, when Boone first appears, one of the first things that he does is pick up a dandelion and blow all the seeds off it. Gigi tells Hugo that Humans do that as a way to make a wish. We later find out in the book that Boone wished to see a Sasquatch, and it had apparently came true because he and Hugo made eye contact not long after.
-   _Bruce Coville's Book of... Spine Tinglers_: Miranda Alice gets three wishes from a snail (and promptly wishes for a thousand more) in _Those Three Wishes_. Unfortunately, she wasn't careful what she said and, after realizing she'd forgotten to study for a test, unwittingly wished to be dead.
-   Isaac Asimov's "Gimmicks Three": Welby's contract provided him with ten years of supernaturally guided life, every wish he had could be fulfilled by seemingly coincidental events that happened to bring him good fortune.
-   In one of the dialogues in _Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid_, the main protagonist Achilles finds<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  a magical lamp whose Benevolent Genie grants him three wishes. Achilles tries to wish for more wishes, only to find out the genie can't do that for him; a wish about wishes is technically classified as a metawish, and in order to grant such wishes one would need a metagenie in a metalamp, whereas Achilles's genie merely is of the base variety... Luckily the genie happens to have a metalamp with a metagenie in, and even petitions GOD to grant Achilles a typeless wish (that could be about wishes, or metawishes, or metametawishes…), but Achilles still manages to mess it up.
-   _Goosebumps_ tended to be quite fond of this trope as a device for lesson learning. _Be Careful What You Wish For_ is probably the best example. Typically wishes don't go exactly as planned and the protagonist finishes the story by wishing nothing had ever happened.
-   _Household Gods_ begins when Nicole annoyedly tells what she believes to be normal statues of the Roman gods Liber and Libera—but which were actually avatars of the real gods—that she "wished she'd lived then" (ancient Rome), and the gods, ecstatic to have a wish they can grant, are more than happy to grant that wish. She wakes up the next morning extremely confused.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: There are numerous gods in Tariatla that select mortals deserving of aid and grant them a wish, but the manner in which they do so depends on the god. The world is big on free will and self-determination so they won't actually grant the wish so much as make it easier for the wisher to obtain what they want.
    -   Fiol, goddess of fire, will essentially make the wisher Hot-Blooded by removing any inhibitions that may be blocking them and amplifying their passion for the wish
    -   Wiol, goddess of wind, will chart the many possible futures and show the wisher the one that will lead to their wish coming true.
    -   Eaol, the god of earth, will endow them with the knowledge and experience they need.
    -   Tasio, the trickster god, will become a personal Stealth Mentor and work In Mysterious Ways until the results came to fruition in a hilarious (to him at least) manner.
-   Towards the end of _The Magicians_ the protagonist captures a Questing Beast which then grants him three wishes. His first wish is impossible, as is the next one and the one after that. The Beast still counts them as his first wish.
-   _Mermaids of Eriana Kwai_: Early in _Ice Massacre_, Meela wishes on a four-leaf clover that Eriana Kwai could be free from the mermaids that have killed so many people.
-   The _Mouse Math_ picture book _Make a Wish, Albert!_ is about Albert, the main character of the series, celebrating his birthday. He wishes on his birthday candles for a new scooter after seeing his friend Leo's, even though he hadn't asked for one, and gets one.
-   In Erin Morgenstern's _The Night Circus_, the circus acquires the Wishing Tree where you light a candle from the ones already lit. Only some patrons can find it.
-   In a rather grimmer way, _The Picture of Dorian Gray_. Here, the wish (that Dorian's portrait would age rather than he) is definitely magic, but the question is, _who_ granted it?
-   The _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ novelisation "All That Glitters" featured a substance called Wish Dust that would indeed grant any wish and there didn't seem to be a limit. Unfortunately, the dust has a life of its own and finds its way into other people's hands. The kicker has got to be Neve Campbell, Brad Pitt, Leonardo Di Caprio, and Winona Ryder ending up at school because one kid heard they were shooting a new movie.
-   The entire _Star Darlings_ franchise centers around Starlanders granting wishes for humans to both inspire them and bring positive energy back to Starland.
-   Joan Aiken's short story _The Third Wish_ has our hero Mr. Peters freeing a swan from some thorn bushes, who turns out to be the King of the Forest, who grants him three wishes. Mr. Peters wishes for a pretty wife, which is exactly what he gets (her name is Leita), only it turns out Leita's actually a swan that the King turned into a human girl. She loves Mr. Peters but misses her swan sister very badly. Mr. Peters uses his second wish to turn her back into a swan, and Leita and her sister stay with him as swans for the rest of his life..
-   In Ruth Frances Long's _The Treachery of Beautiful Things_, the Leczi gives Jenny one. She tries to use it twice and is warned that it comes in its own time. At the end, Puck shoved her out into the mortal world with the instruction that it works more slowly but more surely there.
-   In Robert Arthur's "The Wonderful Day", Danny wishes on a unicorn horn for all of the expressions adults use to become literally true for just one day. This results in everything from a woman puffing up like a balloon with pride to a man who keeps saying "I wish..." ending up with an entire herd of horses.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Batwoman (2019)_. On Kate Kane's birthday, she blows out the candle on a wedding cupcake Luke Fox has made for her and makes a wish, but we don't hear what she wished for. Immediately after that a Beth shows up from an alternate universe where Kate's twin sister didn't become the psychotic supervillain Alice. Beth has no idea how she got here (she's an anomaly left over when the The Multiverse combined in _Crisis on Infinite Earths (2019)_) and when asked Kate just replies, "I made a wish". Then in a flashback scene, young Beth (the future Alice) is being held captive by Mr. Cartwright, and makes a wish to see her family again, only for Mr. Cartwright to tell her the wish won't come true now that she's spoken it aloud. At the end of the episode, Kate is enjoying another birthday cake with Alt-Beth, blows out the candle and mentions out loud what her first wish had been. Right then Alt-Beth (and Alice elsewhere) simultaneously collapse to the ground in pain.
-   The plot of _Beetleborgs_ is kicked off when three kids release a friendly spirit from a pipe organ, and he offers them a wish in gratitude. They wish to be their favourite comic heroes, and he obliges. Unfortunately, this also brings the _villains_ to life as an unintended side-effect.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In "The Wish", Cordelia decides that Buffy is the cause of all her recent troubles and wishes she had never come to Sunnydale. Unfortunately, she's speaking to vengeance demon Anyanka at the time, who instantly grants her wish by turning Sunnydale into a Crapsack World overrun by vampires.
    -   At the end of "Innocence", Joyce presents her daughter with a makeshift 17th birthday cake and invites Buffy to blow out the candle and make a wish. As Buffy's innocence has been shattered forever by Angel becoming the evil Angelus, Buffy just replies, "Let it burn."
-   The sisters in _Charmed_ went up against a genie who delighted in giving you exactly what you wished for. _Exactly_ what you wished for. Complete with every loophole you didn't close.

-   _Doctor Who_. At the end of "Legend of the Sea Devils", Yaz encourages the Doctor to make a wish while skipping a stone off the ocean. The Doctor says hers out loud, as that's what you do on her planet. It's a wish that her time with Yaz will last forever. From Yaz's expression, she knows full well it's Tempting Fate. Right after this comes the On the Next episode trailer which starts with the Doctor saying, "Nothing is forever..."
-   _Frasier_: Daphne's mother spends Daphne's birthday party whining about how her husband has left her and nobody is paying attention to her.

    **Rachel:** Wow, those things almost never come true!
    
-   The premise of _I Dream of Jeannie_.
-   _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_ — The "Greatest Treasure in the Universe" the team have been looking for is revealed to have this power. Not only could it stop the Zangyack Empire, it could make it so Zangyack never existed in the first place. Unfortunately, doing so would take the power of all Super Sentai, erasing _them_ from the new universe as well. After some agonizing, they decide it's not worth it and they'll stop Zangyack their own way—something they underline by _blowing up_ the Treasure.
-   _Kamen Rider_ has several instances of this trope.
    -   _Kamen Rider Ryuki_ involves a thirteen-man fight to the death over a wish. However, it's all a ruse by the instigator of the fight to build up enough energy to revive his sister.
    -   _Kamen Rider Den-O_ involves a race of monsters who grant wishes to people. However, they aren't actual wish-granting beings, so they instead grant them in a way that'd qualify, such as cutting up neck_ties_ to fulfill a man's wish of cutting ties. However, the consequence of making such a wish allows them to be corporeal and even hijack the person's body to travel back in time and wreck up as much of the past as they can.
    -   _Kamen Rider Ghost_ involves fifteen soul jars containing the spirits of historical figures. In exchange, one can get a wish.
-   In _Once Upon a Time_:

    -   In the pilot, Emma blows out a candle (topped with a blue star) on a birthday cupcake immediately before Henry shows up. At the end of the episode, she tells Regina that she had actually made a wish, not to be alone on her birthday.
-   _Seinfeld_ thoroughly explores this in the episode The Betrayal, which involves the wishing, counter-wishing, and re-wishing of Kramer to "drop dead" using most of the methods in the description. There's also Jerry wishing Man Hands would acquire normal feminine hands. Neither comes true.
-   _Smallville_:
    -   The "Pilot" begins with three-year-old Lana Lang asking Martha to make a wish. She soon does get to "See a little face."
    -   There's also Chloe making a birthday wish of being Lois in "Hex".
-   _Super Sentai_/_Power Rangers_:
    -   _Power Rangers Mystic Force_ had a genie cat named Jenji who granted each person a wish. However, if you wish for more wishes (as Xander did) you render the "contract" null and void.
    -   In the Super Sentai version, the Magirangers' first wish was to defeat the bad guys. He makes excuses about them having to pay them, but it quickly becomes apparent that unlike most genies, he has no special wish-granting abilities and has to make his come true the old fashioned way.
-   Subverted in _Sword and Fairy_ when the three main characters make various wishes on a falling star—none of which come remotely true.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_ often centered on characters getting what they wished for, through many of the means listed above. This being the Zone, of course, Be Careful What You Wish For is in full effect.
-   In _The Worst Witch_ Sybil and Clarice turn a torch into a magic lamp and immediately ask for unlimited wishes. That's absolutely fine...except the lamp has to drain energy from everything around it to facilitate the extra wishes.

    Music 

-   Frank Zappa's song _Fountain Of Love_ from _Cruising with Ruben & the Jets_ is a parody of this trope. It features a wishing fountain, make two people become a couple as a result.

    Roleplay 

-   A frequent theme in _Glowfic_:
    -   Wishcoins are coins you can use to make wishes and they come in tiers of power. The higher the tier, the bigger the wishes you can make and the more pain you must experience to make that wishcoin. The lowest tier is a pinprick and does things like flipping a light switch across the room. The highest tier is so painful no normal human can bear it and it lets you make a subworld where you are basically god. (The main characters use them to set up Society of Immortals and usually well-thought-out Utopia.)
    -   Wish (world name) has a wish granter and Gem made the fluffs hand it over in exchange for an infinite power hack and it's also pretty Benevolent Genie in the actual wishing part.  
        (The main characters use them to set up Society of Immortals and usually well-thought-out Utopia.)

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine_: It's right there in the title - although being a setting focused on the wishing power of the heart, there are other ways to make wishes as well. No matter what the wish is, no matter how impossible it is, no matter how world-changing, it will happen. The fun is dealing with them.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ has the spells _wish_ and _miracle_. The 3.5 versions of these spells have very specific things they can do without risking Literal Genie, Jackass Genie, and/or spell failure. (Well, _miracle_ can fail if you try to do something against your deity's nature.)
-   _Exalted_ has Green Sun Princes and the Akuma of Cecelyne. They have a charm chain named Verdant Emptiness Endowment, which allows them to grant wishes they overhear. Recipients owe the Infernal a favor but can gain virtually anything from greater skill with the sword to Sorcery. Fan upgrades include true love and helper demons. The original creators referred to the charm concept as 'Evil Desert Genie'.
-   One of the tricks kitsune can play on fools in _Kitsune: Of Foxes and Fools_ is Grant a Wish, which nets the casting fox a new tail if they pay foxfire equal to the fool's level. The explanation is "Sometimes the best way to purify a desire is to fulfill it." And given that the normal way of purifying fools is through karmic pranks, that probably means the fox acts like a Jerkass Genie.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_ has a few wish spells that allow you to take a card from anywhere in your collection, and bring it into the current game.
    -   In competitive play you're limited to the cards in your sideboard or cards that were previously removed from the game (so you could wish for a wish you had previously played).

    Theatre 

-   In the 2013 West End musical _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_, after the fourth Golden Ticket is found Charlie (who's already seen his one chance to find a ticket — his annual birthday bar of chocolate — come and go) falls into a blue funk. To try and cheer him up, his father suggests they look through a hole in the roof to see if they can't find a shooting star for the boy to make a wish on, but Charlie sadly says "Don't waste a wish on me." A little later, as Mr. Bucket heads out to look for work once more, he says "Well Charlie, if you won't make a wish, then I will..." Is it a coincidence that soon after, Charlie _does_ find the last Golden Ticket when he uses some dropped money to buy a Wonka Bar? Yes. _It was being saved for him._
-   The opening words of Stephen Sondheim's _Into the Woods_ are "I wish..." Magic, however, comes in only indirectly — Cinderella going to her mother's grave to request silver and gold (a dress appears); the Baker and his Wife agree to fulfill the demands of the Witch, who would then allow them to conceive a child. However, all of their wishes come back to haunt them in Act II, which opens with the same words.
-   In _Jasper in Deadland_, due to being a half-life thanks to Agnes giving him her heart, Jasper is able to have two wishes come true when in the Underworld.

    Toys 

-   The _Star Fairies_ toyline featured the fairies responsible for granting wishes wished on a star. In the animated special, Princess Sparkle, the head fairy, makes her own wish using the Wishing Well for a helper.
-   The line of _Wish Me_ stuffed toys featured puppies and unicorns with glowing accessories that you make wishes on.

    Video Games 

-   In _NetHack_, there are a few ways to get a wish (most of them are based on the common tropes, like rubbing a magic lamp). If you find yourself fortunate enough to make a wish you can cause any item in the game to appear in your inventory, with certain limitations (e.g. wishing for enchanted equipment has a failure chance, you can't get artifacts that already exist elsewhere, you can't wish for the three plot required items, and you can't wish for things that would give you more wishes). The best type of wish is that from a Wand of Wishes, all of the other methods have some chance of going wrong (a wish itself is reliable, but a Jackass Genie will simply attack you and not give you a wish at all).
-   In _Ancient Domains of Mystery_, wishes may be gained from using a blessed ring of djinni summoning, using a wand of wishing, casting the Wish spell, or randomly and unlikely from drinking from a magical pool. Wishes can be used to create items (other than artifacts), raise your stats or skills, summon a specific type of monster, or a few other arcane things. It's possible to gain infinite wishes by either becoming an archmage (defined as a character capable of casting the Wish spell indefinitely) or building a wish engine that can create endless rings of djinni summoning.
-   Strangely enough, this trope is _corrupted_ in _BlazBlue: Central Fiction_. When Izanami is bested in combat, the Entitled responsible (sorry, Litchi) is granted an Azure fragment to grant their deepest desire... only said wish is usually corrupted in the worst way possible soon after. As an example, Bang's wish to serve Imperator Tenjo again sees Tenjo and Homura dead and Izanami upon the throne. The corruption even goes on a deeper level than that: it is very possible that Izanami herself is tainting these wishes explicitly to point the Entitled towards killing the "absolute Entitled", the inhabitant of the Master Unit, with killing Noel the first step. However, sometimes the Azure fragment crumbles when the wish cannot be granted: while the expected "wish for more wishes" loophole is closed (Terumi is not content with a mere fragment), there's also Rachel and Valkenheyn's wish to abolish Drives (since Izanami is the "Drive-existence" of the Master Unit, granting this wish means Izanami ceases to be) and Makoto's wish for a happy life with her friends (which includes the aforementioned Noel, making the wish divide-by-zero by default), both of which are detrimental to Izanami.
-   In _Dominions 3_, you can research the high-level "Wish" spell and have one of your mages cast it. You have to type in what you want; there are about 20 possibilities, most beneficial but some quite literal...
-   _Elona_ grants you wishes under very rare circumstances (the easiest way for new players is to drink from all fountains you find). You can type in almost any item's name to receive it, but be sure to have a guide handy because the text parser might read part of your wish, ignore the rest, and grant you something completely different from what you wanted.
-   _Kyle & Lucy: Wonderworld_: This is the main goal of the main characters, in order to get back home.
-   In _Miitopia_ when Miis decide to camp out for the night, there's a chance they'll do some stargazing, then one of them spots a shooting star in the sky. The Miis then decide to make wishes, which triggers a minigame where you have to tap whatever wish you want to come true three times before the star reaches the other side of the screen.
-   _Paper Mario 64_: The Star Rod, which Bowser steals, is a powerful artifact in Star Haven known for granting peoples' wishes; he uses the rod to wish he were invincible. During the final battle, Peach makes a wish for Mario to be stronger, allowing the Star Beam to match Bowser's Nigh-Invulnerability and defeat him.
-   The Sticker Comet of _Paper Mario: Sticker Star_ grants the wishes of everyone in the Mushroom Kingdom on Sticker Fest; it set off most of the conflict when Bowser breaks it and absorbs its power, as well as separates the Royal Stickers which power it. At the end of the game, Mario uses the stickers to make his own wish for Kersti to be revived and everything to return to normal.
-   _Plantasia_: To become a full fairy, Holly has to successfully grant a wish. Unfortunately, that turns out to be a lot harder than it sounds when the wisher asks for all of the gardens around his estate to be fixed (and it's a _massive_ estate), setting up the game's plot.
-   Jirachi from _Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire_ is said to have the ability to grant wishes, and is based on the Tanabata festival. It can't actually grant wishes for the player, though.
-   _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team_: Jirachi can be found in Wish Cave, and actually _can_ grant wishes to the player if you bring it a Wish Stone and don't recruit it into your party. It can give you money, items, stat-boosters, or even new Friend Areas or Pokémon.
-   _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers_: In Bidoof's special episode, "Bidoof's Wish", he seeks out Jirachi so that he can wish to become the best explorer ever. He succeeds in making it to Jirachi, but changes his mind at the last second and instead wishes for new apprentices to arrive at the guild so that he can guide and befriend them. It's implied that Jirachi granted this wish by having the protagonists show up at the guild shortly afterward.
-   The plot of _Super Mario RPG: The Legend of the Seven Stars_ heavily involves wishes in between everything else. After the first few minutes of gameplay, the Star Road is destroyed and the titular seven stars, pieces of the Star Road, fall to the earth. Without the Star Road, wishes cannot be granted, and no new wishes can turn into shooting stars. This is a problem because people often wish for something other than their own benefit, like, oh... _for Mario to succeed and save the world_.
-   The plot of the early _Touhou_ game _Phantasmagoria of Dimension Dream_ involves the cast competing for a wish granted by a pair of extraplanar scientists. If you win with them, Reimu wishes for a way to keep the shrine clean and gets a (useless) Robot Maid, Marisa switches out her Flying Broomstick for an ICBM with a cute face on it, Mima gets the moon put in geosynchronous orbit so she'll always be at full power, Ellen opens up a magic shop (on the Hakurei Shrine grounds), Kana gets a new home (at the Hakurei Shrine), Rikako gains the scientific knowledge she always craved, and Kotohime... didn't have a wish in mind, but settles for locking up Reimu in a jail cell.
-   In _Twisted Metal_, the winner of the titular tournament gets to make one wish. The problem is that the one granting the wishes is Calypso.
-   In _Witch's Heart_, the titular Witch's Heart is rumored to be able to grant any one wish to the person who finds it. It turns out to be the protagonist's heart, which means that anyone who wants to get their hands on the Witch's Heart needs to kill her first — hence the game's tagline: "Do you have a wish you would be willing to kill for?"

    Visual Novels 

-   The holy grail in _Fate/stay night_ grants any wishes to the victorious master/servant pair of the Holy Grail War. Though it is later explained that it's a Jackass Genie due to a bad case of Demonic Possession, and will interpret any wish in a way that will cause maximum pain and suffering.
-   _Hatoful Boyfriend_:
    -   Hiyoko has a few different options for what to wish for during Tanabata: Take Over the World by force, rule the world from the shadows, or become a famous artist. Later in the game, you also unlock the option to wish for "the mad love of a fallen angel", which puts you on Anghel Higure's route.
    -   Also in the backstory. As children, Hiyoko and Ryouta wished for a world where humans and birds would stop fighting. Dr. Shuu overheard them and decided to grant it...by eliminating the remainder of humankind, so that there would be no humans left for birds to fight with.
-   Wishes have a lot of power in the world of _Kanon_, but they also come with a high price. Ayu and Makoto, at least the versions of them that we get to know, were brought into existence solely by the powers of their respective wishes to see Yuichi again. Ayu is an Astral Projection whose real body is lying in a coma, and she disappears when she realizes what's going on. Makoto was originally a fox that Yuichi took care of as a child, and her wish to meet him again transformed her into a human at the cost of erasing her memories and gradually draining her life until she dies. The former gets better in the Golden Ending; the latter doesn't.
-   The protagonist of _Star-Crossed Myth_ makes the vaguest possible Tanabata wish for "something wonderful to happen." This becomes more significant than she expected when she's approached by six gods of the zodiac during the Tanabata festival.
-   In _Steins;Gate_, Mayuri relates a story of wishing on a shooting star for Okabe to get better from his fever when they were kids. Okabe happened to recover the following day. What prompts this discussion is her seeing "the first star of the night sky", which Okabe points out is actually the planet Venus.
-   In _Tokimeki Memorial 2 Substories: Leaping School Festival_, Akane, while talking with the protagonist under the starry sky, makes a wish upon seeing a shooting star, in an Event of her storyline. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Web Animation 

-   In _Red vs. Blue_, Sarge has been wishing on shooting stars every night for the past decade. The wish is, of course, for Grif's violent and untimely death.

    Web Comics 

    Web Original 

    Web Videos 

-   In the Vox Machina campaign of _Critical Role_, Scanlan learns the "Wish" spell. Since its uses are limited, he tries to hold onto its corresponding spell slot for long enough to free Vax'ildan from the Raven Queen's thrall, but was forced to use that spell slot to use "Counterspell" on Vecna, giving the heroes the chance they need to fell the archlich. In an epilogue one-shot session, Scanlan uses his final "Wish" to temporarily bring Vax back from the dead to visit his sister Vex on her wedding day.
-   In _The Guild_, Codex spends one opening monologue waiting for a star to fall so she can make a wish and fix all her problems.
    
    **Codex:** The stars are being sticky little bitches tonight, huh?
    
-   Parodied by _The Nostalgia Critic_ in his 'Top 11 Disney Villains' video, whereas he chronicled a list of very very evil, depraved villains that originated from the company that encourages this trope a lot. He ends his video with "When you wish upon a star, **EVIL WILL FIND YOU!!**"

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Adventures of Puss in Boots_, Dulcinea gets a wishing star named Esteban and becomes an Official Secret Star Wisher. Although the two of them have only the best of intentions, Dulcinea makes her wishes too vague (Dulcinea wishes for a person's stubborn horse to move) and Esteban interprets them too loosely (Esteban makes the horse never stop moving) causing chaos to erupt.
-   _Aladdin: The Series_ has the creature in "Scare Necessities", which grants wishes as a _defense mechanism_—when it's frightened, it grants the wish of whatever frightened it in order to distract them from harming it. At the end, Iago shows it a mirror and screams. The creature thus scares _itself_, and grants its own wish—to go to a paradiscal garden where the rest of its kind lives.
-   The _Animaniacs_ movie, _Wakko's Wish_, had the entire cast racing to be the first to the Wishing Star. Wakko wishes for another ha'penny.
-   In _Annabelle's Wish_, the titular character intends to make a wish to Santa Claus so that she can achieve her dream of flying. Instead, however, she gives up her wish and her voice so that her friend Billy can talk again. Years later, Santa repays her for her selflessness by granting her original wish to fly. She gets turned into a reindeer and even gets her voice back.
-   In one segment of the "Adventures of Cliff Hanger" of _Between the Lions_, Cliff finds a first wishing star on the night sky. Finding help from his survival manual, Cliff makes a wish so that he can get a chance to get off the cliff. Soon Cliff's wish comes true when the Helicopter Chorus (who sing the introduction to start every _Cliff Hanger_ segment) flies in, finally getting Cliff's attention and he is rescued; but it turns out to be all a dream that Cliff was having while dozing off on his branch.
-   In the Christmas Special _Christopher The Christmas Tree_, when Christopher first meets Hooty, he expresses his belief in wishes, partially to explain why he's still optimistic about becoming a Christmas tree, despite not being picked year after year. "But I believe in wishes. I **know** they come true, as sure as the stars above." He also encourages Hooty to make a wish, which Hooty does, while a chorus sings about wishing on a star in the background (no, not that song). By the end of the special, both Christopher and Hooty have gotten their wishes.
    -   The album on which the animated special is based is even more explicit about wishing on a star, as Christopher tells Hooty, "You can have anything in the whole world you want, if you wish on the Wishing Star. But you gotta believe in it, or it won't come true."
    -   In both the album and the animated special, there's a little boy who wishes on the star on his Christmas tree, but since his wish is to be President of the United States, we don't get to see if his wish comes true or not.
-   Two instances from _Danger Mouse_:
    -   "Where There's A Well, There's A Way" has DM and Penfold trekking to find the mystic inkwell of Merlin the Magician. Casting a copper coin into the well and making a wish grants the finder his wish.
    -   In "I Spy With My Little Eye," Penfold sees what he thinks is a star and makes a wish:
        
        **Penfold:** Oh, little star that shines so bright,  
        I'd like a wish if that's all right.  
        Oh, little star in the ink-black heaven...  
        **DM:** Forget it, Penfold, It's a 747.
        
-   _Danny Phantom_ had a recurring villain named Desiree, who would grant you any wish.
-   _Dragon Tales_ did this with a dragon scale in the introduction sequence.
-   _DuckTales_: "Master of the Djinni", featuring a magic lamp and wish-granting genie.
-   This was the whole premise of _The Fairly Oddparents_. Complete with the kid's inability to make a wish that didn't go horribly, horribly wrong.
    -   It's literally revealed a few times fairy godparents have to grant wishes for their godchild often; if they don't grant a wish long enough, they suffer magical buildup and literally explode into confetti.
    -   Norm the Genie on the same show lives in a lava lamp and the third wish sucks him back into the lamp. The third wish is always the Reset Button, too, because Norm is a huge Jackass Genie, and tweaks the wishes to screw over the wishers. Norm parodies this trope too, expressing frustration that the first wish is always something mundane like a sandwich, the second wish is grander but goes wrong, and the third wish is putting everything back the way it was. On an additional note, Norm reveals that you CAN wish for extra wishes, the genies just tell people that you can't.
-   _The Flintstones_ when Barney and Betty wished for a baby after seeing a falling star. They later found Bamm Bamm in a basket on their doorstep.
-   _I Dream of Jeannie_ also had a teenage version Animated Series — her wishes, like Jeannie's, were unlimited.
-   _Kaeloo_:
    -   In Episode 93, when Stumpy and Quack Quack realize that they don't know when Quack Quack's birthday is, they can call any day his birthday and blow out a candle to make a wish on that day. They decide to use it on the current day. While Quack Quack blows on the candles, Stumpy makes the wish for him and wishes for himself and their other friends to become pole dancers.
    -   In Episode 129, Kaeloo, Stumpy, Quack Quack, and Mr. Cat try to stay up late so they can see a shooting star and make a wish on it. Kaeloo and Quack Quack fall asleep, Stumpy stays up but is so tired that he wastes his wish on asking for a bed, and Mr. Cat asks for his own bar and several clones of Kaeloo.
-   _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_ had an experiment which granted wishes, and could only do a certain number of them, and took your wishes literally (for instance, if you wish to become ruler of the universe, you will become a ruler, that is a stationery equipment). The episode ends up teaching the Aesop of "Be careful what you wish for".
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_: The reason the Big Bad wants Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous is because, if someone combines them and uses the proper invocation, they can make any one wish come true. The reason the heroes haven't used this to their advantage is that it works on Equivalent Exchange rules. If, for instance, a machine wished to become human, someone else would lose their humanity.
-   _My Little Pony_:
    -   _My Little Pony 'n Friends_: In "The End of Flutter Valley", Wishful the bushwoolie claims to be able to make things happen by wishing for them to do so. When he tries to put this in practice, however, it entirely fails to work.
    -   _My Little Pony (G3)_: In _Twinkle Wish Adventure_, the ponies celebrate the Winter Wishes Festival with everyone receiving a wish from Twinkle Wish, the star that is placed on top of the tree. Due to the circumstances of the movie, by the time Twinkle Wish takes her spot on the tree, she doesn't have enough power to grant a lot of wishes. However, Pinkie Pie points out that all throughout the adventure, every one of them had said "I wish" something, and that something had come true. In the end, everyone wishes for snow, with Twinkle Wish granting a tiny wish for it to be _pink_ snow.
-   In the _PJ Masks_ episode "The Dragon Gong", Night Ninja steals the titular gong and the mallet that activates it, summoning An Yu, who's trapped inside as a dragon (hence the object's name of "dragon gong") and using her power of granting wishes to get rid of the PJ Masks. However, she fails to mention to him that she only grants one single wish to whoever uses her power, until after he makes his first wish.
-   In _PJ Sparkles_, PJ's wish on the wishing star for someone to love turns her into a Magical Girl and brings her to Twinkle Town, which is made from children's wishes. Its inhabitants similarly wished on the star for someone to love them.
-   _Ready Jet Go!_: In "Bortron Leprechaun", Sydney tells Jet that leprechauns will grant you a wish. Jet wishes that Sunspot was there with him to help him decide on his wish, and his wish gets granted when the leprechaun is revealed to be Sunspot.
-   _Rocky and Bullwinkle_: One of the "Fractured Fairy Tales" segment does a "magic mermaid" variation on the Russian version of the magic fish story (see under "Fairy Tales") with a surprisingly heartwarming ending: rather than taking away all of her previous wishes out of wrath, the fisherman tells the mermaid that all he wants is to make his wife happy, and she grants this as his final wish. When he returns home, he finds that all of the trappings of her previous exorbitant wishes are gone, but his wife is now happy and satisfied with her modest life, and he's happy because she's happy, and as such they live Happily Ever After.
-   _Shimmer and Shine_: The whole point of the show is the titular genies granting wishes for their friend Leah whenever they want. However, they only grant three wishes a day, and because they're still genies in training, they tend to mess up their wishes on occasion (this was dropped in Season 2 onward). Also, once a wish has been made, they must grant it and cannot be stopped.
-   _The Simpsons_ episode where Flanders starts the left-handed store; he and Homer share a wishbone, and Homer wishes for the store to fail. He briefly considers wishing for Flanders to _die_, but then decides it's overkill and goes back to wishing for the store to fail.
-   _The Smurfs_: In the Animated Adaptation of "The Astro Smurf", Dreamy makes a birthday wish that he could travel to the stars, and eventually goes out of his way to build a spaceship so he could make that wish come true. Although it initially fails, the Smurfs end up fulfilling that wish by making Dreamy believe that he actually had traveled to the stars through an elaborate scheme that had Dreamy be put to sleep, his ship dismantled and reassembled within an extinct volcano, and the Smurfs disguising themselves as primitive aliens called Swoofs.
-   _South Park_: Parodied in "It's Christmas in Canada", where a Mountie claims that the characters have the power inside of themselves to wish themselves to Ottawa. They then attempt to do so while harp music plays. Absolutely nothing happens.
    
    **Mountie:** It's OK, boys; the power is inside us to get to Ottawa. We can wish ourselves there!  
    **French Canadian:** Yes, let's wish ourselves there!  
    _(they close their eyes, harp music plays)_  
    **Mountie:** Is it working?  
    _(no, it isn't)_
    
-   In the first of The '80s' _Strawberry Shortcake_ specials, _The World of..._, The Face of the Sun reveals that his birthday present for Strawberry is a "magic wish", and she winds up wishing for an army of trees (which, in Strawberryland, are sentient) to defeat the Purple Pieman who had been causing trouble for the kids the whole story. The wish is granted with trees that can also _march_, and the result is the destruction of his Pie Tin Palace.
-   _Super Robot Monkey Team Hyper Force Go_ has an episode with the Wigglenog, which is a Jackass Genie. Otto, the green monkey, outwits him with "I wish we'd never even found you in the first place!"
-   _Thomas & Friends_:
    -   In "Henry and the Wishing Tree", Henry visits the old Sodor Wishing Tree and makes a wish on it that he could pull coaches instead of Gordon. His wish comes true, but it isn't as good as he thought.
    -   In "Merry Winter Wish", Thomas is to transport a special holiday light — the Star of Knapford — to Knapford Station for a party. It is a special light that engines can make wishes on when passing by. Thomas decides to delay his trip to visit his friends so they can make wishes on it, but when it all goes wrong and he accidentally breaks it, he makes his own wish that his friends can help him. His wish comes true, and eventually his friends get their wishes as well: to all be under the star together.
-   An episode of _Tiny Toon Adventures_ has Elmyra wish on a star for her doll to become real, which it does. After being terrorized for a day, she wishes on the star again to make the doll like all her other dolls...so they all become real!
-   In the fifth season of _Winx Club_, once the Winx obtain the Sirenix transformation, they will each be granted one wish should they conquer a life-risking task which tests themselves:

    Real Life 

-   The Make-a-Wish Foundation raises money to give kids with terminal illnesses a chance to do something incredible, like have a photoshoot in Seventeen magazine, or take their family to Disney World. Maybe humans aren't such bastards after all...
