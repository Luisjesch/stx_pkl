Not what you want to see when you get home.

_"I'll be honest with you: I don't think they'll let us have sex inside George Washington's nose at Mount Rushmore. But it's a very evocative image."_

Traditionally, most people tend to have sex in bed. It's comfy, you're usually already undressed and you can go straight to sleep afterward. Chairs and sofas are also popular; they're soft and have the bonus that the person on top can put more of their weight on the frame. However, some people, for a multitude of different reasons, like to venture further afield for their intimate moments. All over the house, in front of the house, on top of the house, someone else's house, in every gas station, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in this area (and every highway checkpoint within ten miles), in the pool, on a plane, in a hotel, in a No-Tell Motel, in a restaurant, in a movie theater, on an elevator, in a nightclub bathroom, in a basement, in an attic, at the beach, in the sea, in the road, in the middle of a field, in the middle of the Super Bowl Halftime show, in the woods or hills, **IN SPACE!**, in a car, in a boat, with a goat, in the rain, in the dark, on a train, in a restaurant, in a sushi bar, in a high school bus, in the back of your mama's car, on a trampoline, in the middle of a putting green, in a tree, in a box, with a fox, in a house, with a mouse, here or there, say, they would do it anywhere!

Maybe they think that the old bed is too boring, maybe they don't have a convenient bed and have to do it where they can, maybe they're just so eager to get started that they get down to business wherever they find themselves. Maybe it's their way of getting back to nature. Of course, one of the other advantages of bedrooms that might not be afforded by alternative locations is privacy, but that's OK. It could be the thrill of the risk of getting caught that makes it special. Or maybe it's not just the risk, maybe they like being watched. Then again, maybe they just didn't think things through and end up as Naked People Trapped Outside (or in the emergency room). And sexy teens having sex in the back of their car are known to attract hook-handed serial killers, which gets them killed.

Obviously Truth in Television for the most part, so please refrain from noting "people do this in real life!" here. Also Truth in Television is the trope of Make-Out Point, and the fact that these tropes very often overlap; a Make-Out Point in Real Life isn't always as private as the people going there may believe.

Not to be confused with Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places, certainly. Unless the person who does that likes having sex outside, then yeah.

Overcome with Desire is a sister trope, about couples having sex without regard to the consequences of doing so, and they frequently overlap.

Here are some reasons not to do it _absolutely_ anywhere.

## A Super-Trope to:

-   Auto Erotica (sex in a car or some other vehicle)
-   Elevator Going Down (sex in an elevator)
-   Mile-High Club (sex on an airplane)
-   Professionals Do It on Desks (sex on desks, tables, etc.)
-   Roll in the Hay (sex in a pile of hay or barn)
-   Sex at Work (sex at work)
-   Sex in a Shared Room (sex in a room where at least one other person is watching, but not participating)
-   Shower of Love (sex in the shower)
-   Two-Person Pool Party (sex in a swimming pool)
-   Zero-G Spot (sex _IN SPACE!_)

    -   Shirogane acts very prudish because he was once worshiped as a god, but his disused shrine ended up becoming a Makeout Point. When Shirogane sees Suzu attempting to kiss Matsuri, he uses being at a different shrine as an excuse to cut them off.
    
    _Don't make out at a shrine!_
    
    -   After the fight with Hinojiki, who inadvertently undid the Gender Bender jutsu afflicting Matsuri, the latter tells Suzu that he wants to do something while he's a guy before the jutsu kicks back in. Once Matsuri leads her deep into the woods and starts stripping down, Suzu decides to go with the flow and begins stripping down herself in preparation... only to find Matsuri Meditating Under a Waterfall in just his fundoshi now that he doesn't have breasts to hide.
-   _Booty Royale: Never Go Down Without a Fight!_: Done twice by Kurisu and her assistant manager, Yajima, at work. The first time happens during chapter 23 when Kurisu gets drunk and propositions Yajima for sex in his office. The second incident starts with Kurisu playing footsie with his crotch under the table until he excuses himself to the Men's room. Kurisu follows him moments later to confront him about his feelings for her, prompting Yajima to make it official by boning her in one of the bathroom stalls for _several hours_.
-   The Deuteragonists of _Crimson Spell_, Halvir and Valdrigr, have a penchant for this. Partially justified in that, as adventurers, they have limited access to actual beds. But they can find a cave, a half-destroyed shrine, a tomb, and on one memorable occasion, the balcony right outside a crowded party.

-   _Maka-Maka_: Well, not all the way, but Jun loves to fondle Nene in public places, and Nene sometimes returns the favor.
-   _Phantom Quest Corp._: Incident File: 03 includes a scene where Detective Karino drops by Mr. Nagasuki's office to question him and inadvertently catches Nagasuki in the act of banging his secretary!

-   _Vassalord_: Charley and Rayflo have their kinky blood-sucking sessions in a variety of odd places including a prison cell, an airplane bathroom, and the back room of a _church_.
-   _Zettai BL ni Naru Sekai VS Zettai BL ni Naritakunai Otoko_: Analyzed as do many troped common in yaoi.
    
    -   In "VS the molester", the protagonist is on a train where a couple is grinding and groping discreetly in public, which intensively bothers him. He mentions that in this world, it's very common to catch people in the act or at least about to do the act. He even memorizes a list of excuses he's been given. When the couple realizes that he could see them, they decide to go home to continue, which the protagonist mentions is still not great because they're likely to just have sex in the entrance instead of getting to the bed.
    
    "As soon as they get home, surely they won't go to their room and will have sex in the entrance like animals."
    
    -   In "VS drinking at home", the protagonist ends up sleeping in a friend's house together with two couples he realizes are secretly dating. During the night, one of these couples has sex on the bed right next to him, he can't intervene, but neither can he sleep.
    
    "You're guests in someone's home. It's not my home, but still, it's someone's home!?"
    
-   In _Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead_, Ohtori and the company chairman have sex at work in the middle of his office not far from Akira's desk. The chairman claims that the walls are thick and no one will be able to hear them, but the story makes it clear that the walls are anything but soundproof and Akira is forced to listen to them make out while fighting to stay awake.

    Fan Works 

-   _Evangelion 303_: In chapter 17 Asuka gave Shinji a blowjob in the hotel's lift.
-   ''The Adventures of Ryan and Kirrie'' initially starts off with the titular characters doing the deed in a bed, and then later a bathtub in a Pokémon Center. From there, it just gets more and more ridiculous. One of the more notable examples is Chapter Four, where they do it in in the middle of Petalburg Woods of all places after getting exposed to Shroomish "sex spores" prior.
-   _Advice and Trust_:
    -   In the middle of chapter 5, Shinji and Asuka have sex on a couch in Misato's apartment's living room. Later in that chapter, they are so desperate for a little private fun together after four days of forced abstinence (due to their guardian being home and sober at the night and their teammate following them everywhere) that they have sex in the school's cleaning supply closet. The supply closet incident was actually a rather important plot point since it's what tipped off Rei that they were in a Secret Relationship.
    -   In in chapter 8 Ritsuko demands Gendo take her on his office's desk.
-   One of the scenes in the _Teen Titans_ fic _Boy Flounder_ has Cyborg go berserk on Robin and Starfire once Beast Boy finds the girl's vajazzles on the common room couch.

-   In _Broomsheds, Lifts and Loos_ Harry and Ginny reminisce about the various locations where they had a quickie.

-   In _Chains of Earth_ Draco insists on having sex on a clifftop and Harry complains about the sand he got between his buttcheeks last time they made love outdoors.

-   _The Child of Love_:
    -   In chapter 1 Asuka tells Misato she saw her and Kaji having sex in the park.
        
        **Asuka**: There's nothing to understand, Misato. And you're hardly the one to lecture me, you hypocrite. I saw you doing that with Kaji last month...  
        **Misato**: YOU SAW US!?! WHEN?! WHERE?  
        **Asuka**: When, I don't remember exactly...but WHERE...oh, you were probably getting excited doing that in the park...where everyone could see you.
        
    -   Shinji and Asuka's first time was in Misato's apartment's living room. They did it on the floor and on the couch.
-   _Coby's Choice_: Luffy and Nami, in order to scratch off Nami's "Honeymoon Bucket List", have an sex in the tangerine grove on Little East Blue. Although, while the couple did find the thrill of being caught exciting, it was a little too stimulating and put the possibility of anything similar happening on hold for the moment.
-   _A Crown of Stars_: In chapter 64 Shinji and Asuka played several music pieces in front of a multitude. Asuka dragged Shinji straight after into one of the stadium's rooms to have sex while the concert went on. She also said she nearly had him right there and then on stage.

-   _Duran And Kiyohime's Omake Theater_: Downplayed, but Shizuru did once decide to make advances to Natsuki in an open-air bath. Natsuki will also note that once Shizuru reads their fortune cookies (See Running Gag), they stand a fifty-fifty shot of not even making it to the bedroom. And once, Shizuru expressed a desire to sweep all of the food off of the table with one move, and take Natsuki right there. Natsuki considered **_that_** a step too far, and decided it was an ideal time to take Duran for his evening walk.

    **Morgan:** Because he gave me a reward.
    
-   _From Bajor to the Black_: In a Shout-Out to the _NCIS_ example, Eleya loses her virginity during boot camp in the cargo compartment of an IFV.
    
    **Author's Note:** Bajorans are basically post-Holocaust space Jews in a lot of ways and Eleya's an action girl, so what the hey?

-   _HERZ_: Subverted in chapter 4. Shinji entered the men's locker room in the base and he was led to believe Asuka was waiting for him in one of the shower stalls. He made his way to the stall to "have fun" with his wife... and he found Kurumi inside so that he fled.
-   _Higher Learning_: Subverted. In a chapter, Shinji and Asuka are making out in Misato's living room and they are about to have sex in the tub but Misato shows up early, forcing them to stop and pretend nothing was happening.

-   _Lilly Epilogue Family Matters_: Hisao and Lilly, the Official Couple, get an apartment with their mutual friend Hanako for several reasons, one being that Lilly's "healthy adolescent sex drive" would make it difficult to live with Hisao's parents.

-   In the (NSFW) _X-Men: Evolution_ fic _My Friend, My Lover_, Jean is confronted by the rest of the students after she and Scott were spotted coming out of school weight room with messy clothes and huge grins. Once the others become too pushy with their questions, she snaps and unloads a Too Much Information rant at them, mentioning "storage rooms at school, the locker room, the lounge, and even the danger room" (the latter was used in both this fic and others by the same author as an appropriately programmed Holodeck).
-   _My Immortal_: Everyone. All the time. One notable scene takes place in a classroom while class is in session, and another in the middle of the Great Hall with Dobby watching, and yet another is on the edge of the Forbidden Forest on (or near) Draco Malfoy's flying car... _with no mention that the car ever landed_.

-   In _Mass Effect_'s Parable series'', a side-effect of Jane and Garrus's incredible loving marriage was having lots of sex, including places where that wasn't supposed to happen. At first, it was just around the house (the dining table and the couch), then in the Mako and the communal bathroom during Saren's mission; on the SR-2 it was a failed attempt in the medbay after Garrus ate a rocket (Chakwas stopped them), the Communications Room right after debriefing, the Battery; a hotel balcony, a public extra-net booth, and inside a sky-car on top the Presidium while a cop knocking on the window. At one point after the war, they were going to do it in an Alliance ship's med bay but the doctor walked in on them before they managed to strip all the clothes; there was also another time where they deliberately placed their room right next to a bitchy Spectre's and had sex all night to keep her awake through the thin wall.
-   _Queens of Mewni_: Skywynne and Filbric were nearly caught having sex in the castle kitchens, and a NSFW picture shows a mortified naked Skywynne hiding behind a counter with her husband while confused maids look at the mess they left.

-   In _Rising Phoenix_ Lucius and Narcissa have sex on the grounds of a hotel.
-   _Rosario Vampire: Brightest Darkness Act II_: In chapter 32, while Tsukune & Moka and Dark & Mizore all have the decency to retire to other rooms to make love, Rason and Kurumu just elect to do it right in the middle of the Shirayuki family's living room, all over the place and in various positions.
-   _The Second Try_:
    -   In Chapter 4 Omake, Asuka and Shinji have their honeymoon on the beach overlooking the LCL sea (which depending on your definition, may count as exhibitionism).
        
        **Asuka:** Well, that's the good thing of being all alone in the world: You can do it wherever you want, without the risk of being seen by anyone!
        
    -   In chapter 12 Shinji and Asuka had sex in the base's locker room right before the Final Battle.

-   _Us and Them_: Aeris and Sephiroth can get a little frisky when they get worked up, such as in "Discipline", where they get into an argument that leads to them romping in the grass outside their home and having to hide from a pizza delivery guy their kids called in since they took so long.

-   _Weekend at Hisao's_: Lampshaded, where Hisao points out how Shizune's kink of doing it at school can get... risky.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Salem and her husband Nicholas apparently have sex in literally every part of the house. Jaune specifically mentions a time he caught them on the dining room table. They're so bad that for a long time Jaune is ignorant of "sleep with" being a euphemism for sex, because his parents seem to do it everywhere _but_ the bedroom. When Jaune's sisters go to the house in Ansel for the first time, they ask if it's been "broken in," and are all very relieved when their father says their mother hasn't been there yet.
-   _X-Men: The Early Years_: Discussed. When deliberating on places to make love for the first time, Scott suggests the town park, but Jean declines.
    
    "It's what makes life with me so exciting, Scott. So what do we do now?"  
    "Go home, I guess. Unless," Scott blanched, eyeing the grass, "you want to try it here?"  
    Jean chuckled at that comment. "Not really. Besides, you have me in your life now; you won't need any cheap thrills."  
    "I was hoping you'd say that." He looked relieved. "I wasn't looking forward to getting a rock or stick jabbing into me."  
    "I guess we head home then," Jean said, getting up from the curb.

    **Dwight**: I've had intercourse in this office. As has Angela. As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. As has Michael. And as has Holly.  
    **Kevin**: As has Kevin!  
    **Angela**: (In disbelief) With who?  
    **Kevin**: She goes to another school.
    
-   _Orange Is the New Black_:
    -   Nicky and Morello get it on in the shower, and again in the prison chapel. Later, Morello gets married, and the guards agree to allow her to have sex with her new husband in the visitation room-just this once, and only because it's their wedding night, and (since federal prison has no conjugal visits) the last time they'll get to do it for a while. Officially, there is No Sex Allowed, although plenty of inmates (not just Morello and Nicky) have it anyway. Indeed, Nicky and Big Boo actually have a contest to see who can screw the most women there!
    -   Daya gets into a Secret Relationship with a guard and becomes pregnant by him. When her attempt at abortion is thwarted by her mother, she faces a dilemma: she knows the baby will be taken from her after it's born, and she also knows that her boyfriend will lose his job and be convicted of rape<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and sent to prison himself. So she conspires with her mother to make everyone think it's someone else's: she has sex with Pornstache in a broom closet, and arranges for them to get caught so he's blamed instead.
    -   The prison chapel is hands down the most popular place for flings between the inmates.
    -   In Season 4, the time machine in the laundry room seems to be the most popular destination.

    -   Sam hooks up with Chloe, a woman who she met at a party, in the bathroom due to being very horny (this was less than five minutes after they were introduced as well).
    -   Also it's revealed that Sam once hooked up with James in another bathroom, but neither remembers doing this at present since they were both drunk at the time. This was apparently something Sam did often, as the owner of the bar she did this in berates her, saying he's told her multiple times not to have sex in the bar's bathroom.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_. In "Scientific Method", Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres make up for years of Unresolved Sexual Tension by making out constantly. First Tom teleports to a Jeffries tube where B'Elanna is working so they can make out, but later they get so impatient they start doing it on a console on the upper deck of Engineering. And we know from a later episode that they are both quite noisy during these times. Eventually, they're hauled on the carpet before Captain Janeway because half the ship is gossiping about their antics. It's later revealed that some of this intensity was caused by aliens conducting scientific experiments on the crew.
-   _The Summer I Turned Pretty_: Steven has sex with Shayla on the beach (though offscreen).

    -   Emma, Jack and Izzy get back together after making out in the Amaris' bathroom. It makes the Amaris believe they're having sex inside.

    Magazines 

-   _MAD_ parodies _Bonnie and Clyde_ ("Balmy and Clod"), where she repeatedly tries to insist on doing this trope in extremely inconvenient locations (like a Car Chase), which he, of course, refuses to do, only to culminate in what he calls the worst place of all, which turns out to be a bed. It kind of makes sense if you've seen the movie.

    Music 

-   "Anywhere" by 112. The verses aren't really that indicative, but it's the chorus that outright mentions all the places.
-   The song "The Bagman's Gambit" by The Decemberists, about a man who falls in love with a con artist. The lyrics don't specify whether the singer's paramour is male or female. It would be somewhat easier for them to meet in a bathroom stall if they were of the same sex.
    
    _And I recall that fall / I was working for the government / and in a bathroom stall off the National Mall / how we kissed so sweetly / how could I refuse a favor or two?_
    
-   Billy Joe Royal's song "Cherry Hill Park" is about a Seemingly-Wholesome '50s Girl who provides all the boys with "a thrill after dark" in the titular locale.
-   After having been caught engaging in "cottaging" (meeting up with gay men for sex in public bathrooms), George Michael used this..."experience" as inspiration for his song "Outside", which is quite the lampshade on the trope as a whole. (The music video has a slew of examples on its own.)
    
    _I think I'm done with the sofa  
    I think I'm done with the hall  
    I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby_
    
-   "Hey Bobby" by K.T. Oslin:
    
    _"Hey Bobby will you ride a little ways down 299  
    To lovely little spot on I found? It's on a hilltop  
    We can park in the shade and dance on the ground  
    To a radio station where the hits don't ever stop"_
    
-   Briefly mentioned in Digital Underground's "The Humpty Dance" - "I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom".
-   "Sex in Crazy Places" by Gucci Mane, featuring Nicki Minaj, Bobby V, and Trina. They rap about making love on an airplane, a Six Flags roller coaster, and Disney's Magic Kingdom, among other places.
-   Jake Thackray had a song called "Isobel Makes Love Upon National Monuments", which is also Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   Jonathan Coulton's love anthem "First Of May" is all about sex in the park.
    
    _Ooh ooh child, I'll bring a blanket and I promise I will brush the ants off._  
    _Ooh ooh child, you're gonna like it when we're taking each other's pants off,_
    
-   "Just Another Lover Tonight" by Cheryl Ladd:
    
    _"So you want him  
    And you dog him  
    That's no problem  
    He's just another lover  
    You can do him  
    You can use him  
    Till you lose him"_
    
-   Mentioned in Katy Perry's song "California Gurls", with a (probably) unintentional Last-Second Word Swap: "Sex on the beach/We don't mind sand in our stilettos".
-   In "Nothing Like The First Time" by Lady Antebellum, the main protagonists had their first time underneath the bleachers.
-   One of the shared pleasures cited in the "Pina Colada" song is making love at midnight in the dunes on the Cape.
-   Poe in "Not A Virgin" sings about having sex in a variety of places, including "underneath the table in \[her\] living room."
-   Implied in the Little Big Town song "Pontoon":
    
    _"Party in slow motion  
    Out here in the open  
    Mmmmmm... Motorboatin'"_
    
-   Sarah Silverman and Matt Damon. On the bed, on the floor, on the towel, by the door, in the tub, in a car, up against the minibar...
-   _Warrant_: There's implied kitchen sex in "Cherry Pie".
-   The subject of the rap song "What's Your Fantasy?" by Ludacris. The 50-yard line of a football stadium is _just for starters_. The club, all over the house, on a boat, in the ocean, and even all the way to **The White House**.
-   The Beatles' song "Why Don't We Do It In The Road?" is Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   Robert Knight's "Love on a Mountain Top".
    
    Love on a mountain top (love on a mountain top)  
    So high that we won't ever stop (high that we won't ever stop.)  
    Making love on a mountain (do do do do do stop.)  
    Drinking love from a fountain (do do do do do)
    
-   Ashlee Simpson's "La La" is an Intercourse with You mentions sex on the kitchen, the floor, an airplane and the back of a bus.
-   Exaggerated with the cover art for the 2016 single "Water" by the rapper Ugly God who is seen making underwater love to Jessie from Pokémon: The Series on the back of a Mega Blastoise, of all things.
-   Sparks: In "All You Ever Think About Is Sex", the narrator states that "we've had our little fun" in a variety of inappropriate locations, including a Christmastime church service, in a museum exhibit, in the White House lawn, and a baseball game.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Edge and Lita's "live sex celebration" did happen in a bed...in the middle of the ring, with the entire audience watching. This being WWE, it was interrupted by Ric Flair.

    Roleplay 

-   _Orderly Chaos_: Geier supposedly has a thing for sex on rooftops.

    Theatre 

-   The 2009 production of Bizet's _Carmen_ at the Metropolitan Opera, with French tenor Roberto Alagna as Don José and Latvian mezzo-soprano Elina Garanca as Carmen, has this at the end of Act I. Following Carmen's already seductive Seguidilla that distracted Don José from writing out the arrest forms, both Don José and Carmen give into sexual tension as they make out upon a desk in the prison, and it's highly implied that they had sex as the lights fade out. See for yourself here.
-   At the close of _In the Next Room, or the Vibrator Play_, Dr. Givings and Catherine disrobe and do it on the street in the snow.

    Video Games 

-   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_:
    -   If the male Inquisitor romances Cassandra, the romance is consummated in a grove just outside of the Inquisition's home base of Skyhold. It happens immediately after their first kiss.
    -   If the player enters a relationship with The Iron Bull, fellow party member Cole will start giving the rest of the party details about the Inquisitor and Bull's bedroom activities. If the Inquisitor opts to say that s/he and Bull are consenting adults who can do what they want in bed, Cole's tendency to be Literal-Minded leads him to announce that the Inquisitor and Bull have also been having sex up against the wall and once on the war table, to the amusement or discomfort of the fourth party member.
-   _Duel Savior Destiny_: Though it fades to black before we see anything, the actual majority of the sex scenes take place like this. The most glaring has to be one that takes place _mid-battle_ between Rico and Taiga, though to be fair it's both in a pocket dimension and because if they don't they'll be killed. Or at least, Taiga will be. Rico is almost unkillable.
-   _Fallout 4_: At the beginning, you can talk to your spouse, who will ask if you want to go to the park together. Cue this dialogue:
    
    **Spouse:** Hey, I was wondering if we should go to the park together. Could be fun.  
    _\[Player picks Sarcastic option\]_  
    **Male Protagonist:** Will it be like our first time at the park together?  
    **Female Protagonist:** Yes, to the park, with _you._ Because I want to get pregnant again.
    
-   _Mass Effect 2_:
    -   Shepard and Miranda have sex in the _Normandy's_ engine room. The reasoning behind it is that this is to avoid the Illusive Man's monitoring devices... But the fandom likes to say that it's because she's an exhibitionist. Or it could be because Miranda's two potential romantic rivals (Kelly doesn't count) are both stationed on the engineering deck. She's kind of like that.
    -   If you have the Kasumi DLC, at least she notices. "Really, Shepard, in the engine room? Right where Tali works?"
-   _Mass Effect: Andromeda:_
    -   Peebee's optional sexual encounter takes place in one of the _Tempest's_ escape pods, in zero-g. Partially justified in that she _lives_ in said escape pod.
    -   Suvi and Sara's romance scene has them doing it inside the Nexus science lab. Probably not the kind of biological research (ahem) the builders intended it for.
-   _Neverwinter Nights_:
    -   In the mod _The Bastard of Kosigan_, precisely one sex scene involves a bed. Most of the rest involve tables, walls, and on one occasion a tree.
    -   Likewise with _A Dance with Rogues_, though in this case there are rather more and the floor is used more frequently. Especially where Vico is involved, at least if the Princess responds to his advances when he suddenly has an urge in the middle of a graveyard in the Underdark. Also works the other way; most possible Love Interests will only have sex with the Princess in bed (or sleeping bags) at night when everyone else is asleep, but the Princess can ask Vico for sex anywhere at any time (to the disgust of the rest of the party).
-   Parodied in _Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous_. If Daeran and the Commander are in a romance and he's in the party when the player explores the Wintersun area, there's an interaction where he suggests they fulfill one of his fantasies by making love under a waterfall. The PC has the option to shove him into the pool as a prank (the romance pretty much runs on Snark-to-Snark Combat), whereupon he emerges dripping wet and complaining that those romance novel authors should be flogged because that water was _way_ colder than he expected.
-   _The Sims_:
    -   Sims in _The Sims 2_ can woohoo in changing booths, inevitably attracting an audience (which can even include the couple's parents, siblings, children, etc. if they happen to be on the lot with them- talk about awkward!). They can also do the deed in hot tubs, including those placed on community lots (one premade example, included with the University expansion pack, is a tower whose sole furnishing is a hot tub on the top floor. On a college campus. Yeah, pretty obvious what the creators' were thinking when they designed it!). The various expansion packs added even MORE venues for Sims to get busy in public, including photo booths, saunas, tents, and elevators.
    -   In _The Sims 3_ they can do it in various buildings around town, as well as a sarcophagus in _World Adventures_, a time machine in _Ambitions_, treehouses in _Generations_, the haystacks in _Pets_, and a magician's box of mystery in _Showtime_. It seems that a new expansion pack just isn't complete without a new place for Sims to woohoo.
    -   In _The Sims 4_, Sins can woohoo in spots such as the Brindleton Bay lighthouse, Mua Pel'am's waterfall, a pile of leaves, a coffin, a money vault, an ice cave, and a _rocket ship,_ which takes off into the sky during the act. Woohooing on a community lot will draw the attention of other Sims.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Being A DIK_: The MC can have sex with several characters in unconventional places, fitting its sex comedy vibe:
    -   Josy can be seduced in a gym bathroom, and will seduce you in the water park with Maya if you're in the throuple.
    -   Maya can be seduced in a classroom during the dorm party.
    -   Sage can be seduced in several places, including the HOTs' swimming pool, the back lawn of the HOTs house (where they are caught by Quinn and Riona in the act), and the haunted house setup during the Halloween party.
    -   The first time the MC and Quinn can have sex is on the rooftop of the DIK mansion if he accepts the weed Tommy gives him; notably, Jacob sees the two of you if you do, causing you to complete the "having sex in public" task for the pledge board.
    -   Camila may fellate the MC in the HOTs bathroom at Quinn's command, and can have sex with him on the crowded dance floor during the Halloween party.
    -   Jade is the queen of this; she pulls a "Basic Instinct" Legs-Crossing Parody on the MC during Chad's disciplinary hearing while _her husband_ is in the room, and can subsequently give him a handjob in her classroom _during her class_ and later seduce him in a supply closet.
    -   Notably, the MC isn't the only one who can do so: Derek's most notable sexual encounter happens with Wendy in the bushes near the DIK mansion, and Tommy having sex with Arieth in a bar bathroom is shown as the reason for the hatred between the DIKs and the tri-Alphas.
-   _Crescendo (JP)_: Ryo does it with Miyu on _and_ against the music room's piano.
-   _The Devil on G-String_: Tsubaki's bad end H-scene with Kyousuke occurs at night in the park.
-   _DRAMAtical Murder_:
    -   Several times, particularly in the _Re:connect_ game. Koujaku's good end follow-up has both him and Aoba making love in his bathroom with two options: in the bathtub or in the shower.
    -   In Noiz's good end, Aoba has sex with Noiz in the latter's hospital bed.
-   _ef - a fairy tale of the two._: Chihiro and Renji sneak onto the rooftop when the school was otherwise closed.
-   _Katawa Shoujo_: Since the game takes place in a Boarding School, there are _several_ instances of this kind of sex taking place in _other_ places than the dormitories:
    -   Shizune seems quite prone to this. You didn't do it, but she wanted to have sex on the school rooftop. Also, while not as severe as other cases, it isn't a good idea to have sex in your parents' house when they (or at least her dad and brother) can just barge in at any moment. And finally, Hisao and Shizune's _big_ sex scene, which you only see in the good ending route, takes place in the student council room at night.
    -   The second scene for Emi takes place in the sport supplies shed. It's... hilariously awkward, especially since it's _anal_ sex and the naked Emi is bent over one of the props. It's also implied that Emi did... _something_ amazing with Hisao in the rooftop — three guesses as to what.
    -   Rin and Hisao's first sex scene takes place in the painting atelier that Sae got for her. One wonders what would've happened if either she or Nomiya walked in.
    -   While the major part of the sex scenes take place on the school grounds, the first sex scene with Lilly Satou happens in the living room of the Satou family's summer house in Hokkaido. Since it only has two bedrooms and their common friend Hanako is with them, Hisao has to sleep on a futon; Lilly visits him to talk about their recent mutual Love Confession, they start making out, and one thing leads to another(although Hanako is asleep due to being exhausted from the stress of Hisao having a heart murmur earlier that day). They also subvert the typical "bathtub sex" scene the morning after: they do get into the hot tub and fondle each other, but for the actual sex act, they get out and do it on the floor, _next_ to the tub.
-   All the couples in _Kindred Spirits on the Roof_ end up doing something sexual at school at some point or another in the story. Since Sachi and Yuna are ghosts who want to use other couples as references to learn how to consummate their relationship, but can't leave the school or go anywhere they didn't go when they were alive<sup>Explanation&nbsp;</sup> , this is rather convenient for them. At the very end of the game, Yuna and Hina sneak into campus(which is a violation of the rules in and of itself) to allow Sachi and Megumi to possess their bodies and have Their First Time so they can pass on.
-   When the protagonist and title character of _Melody_ visit a music museum, and see a piano in the middle of a auditorium-like room, they get ready to have sex before they are chased out by security. Lampshaded later by Melody, who says she's glad in hindsight that first time having sex wasn't in a public place, on top of a piano.
-   _Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke wo_: Including places like the school clinic and the back garden, which are always empty when the time comes. Mai lampshades this in the third novel when she states that the clinic is always empty (and they always happen to be doing something there.) Word of God claims that this is possible due to the meddling of a certain perverted maiden in the school's environmental maintenance committee. Mai and Reo also do it in a dressing room at a clothing store and in the library while they're supposed to be studying.

-   _Cracked_: If this article is anything to go by, at casinos like Mohegan Sun, the excitement of gambling gets mixed up with sexual arousal. As the author points out:
    
    _"We've caught guys finger-banging their girlfriends under the roulette table and ladies giving handjobs at the poker table. What many patrons don't realize is that almost all casinos have damn near 100 percent camera coverage. At the Mohegan Sun, this has allowed us to record everything from nip-slips to elevator sex to people banging in the slot machine corner. I'm pretty sure that our surveillance guys can't even look at porn anymore because it feels too much like work."_
    
-   _Darwin Awards_:
    -   At least one story involved a couple doing it _in the middle of the road_ **at night**. No prizes for guessing how that one ended.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_: Encouraged by Finn and Jake, Mister Pig confesses his deep love for Tree Trunks. She reciprocates and the two set to convey their love by shamelessly and passionately making out in front of other people. First, in Tree Trunk's garden right in the presence of Finn and Jake, who then proceed to awkwardly exit the scene. Then in Princess Bubblegum's concert in the Candy Kingdom — Finn splits them but the couple soon starts to dance in a very affectionate manner, even rubbing their butts at one point. In response, an enraged Princess Bubblegum gathers her electric piano and equipment and calls the concert off. Tree Trunks and Mister Pig promise to tone their displays of affection down but a montage shows them merely seeking hidden-from-view places. Which would be a good idea if not for the fact they choose places where other people can easily find them and some of them are either inappropriate (in Finn and Jake's Tree Fort, inside a baby's crib, behind a movie screen) or plain bizarre (inside of a sandwich). When asked why they don't just make out in Tree Trunk's house, Tree Trunks states that it's improper for a non-married couple to live together (Mister Pig is homeless and has been living in Tree Trunk's house since Finn and Jake rescued him).

    -   Hank once walks in on his mother and her boyfriend having sex on the kitchen table.
    -   In another episode, the family notices little things wrong around the house, and Cotton keeps insisting someone is sneaking in.

Kahn also alludes to having done it in the library reading room.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Parodied in one episode, where Homer and Marge try sex in a bathtub as a means of rekindling their love life. They discover the tub is barely big enough for both of them to squeeze into, let alone get into an intimate position.
    -   Beach sex is parodied in "And Maggie Makes Three", where it looks like Homer and Marge are about to have a wild, hot night on the beach, only for Marge to ask that they leave because they've both got sand in their underwear. After they leave, Homer runs back to put _more_ sand in his underpants.
    -   Bart was conceived inside the windmill on a miniature golf course.
    -   Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel caused some controversy by seemingly getting caught in the act of doing it in the school. In fact, they're found making out in the janitor's closet fully-clothed, but by the time Gossip Evolution has done its job they were actually caught having sex, and Skinner has to publicly confess (accurately or not) to being a virgin to save both of their jobs. It wouldn't be the last use they'd make of the space, though:
        
        **Skinner:** Edna, look. A dimmer switch could ratchet up the romance in our love nest.
        
    -   The episode "Natural Born Kissers" has Marge and Homer finding that the fear of getting caught in the act adds some much-needed spark to their sex life.

    -   In "3 Scenes Plus a Tag From a Marriage," Lisa is said to have been conceived on the fire escape in Homer and Marge's first apartment (the only place they could go to avoid waking up Bart), making Maggie the _only_ one of Homer and Marge's kids to have been conceived in bed.

## Making Love in the Corn Caddy

Wolf gets really horny whenever he sees the Corn Caddy and he can't control himself and Honeybee goes along with it. They end up doing the deed inside the food truck when the truck owner left the window open for them to enter inside. When Wolf opens the door to let some more air in, he accidentally activates the truck's alarm, forcing the couple to flee out of the truck in their underwear while they carry their clothes.
