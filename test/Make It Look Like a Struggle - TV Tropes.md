**Mal:** The leg is _good_. It'll bleed plenty, and we avoid any necessary organs.  
**Payroll Guard:** I was thinking more like a graze...  
**Mal:** Eh, you don't wanna make it seem like you just gave up.  
**Payroll Guard:** No, I get that.

The Hero needs a MacGuffin, or simply an escape. Someone is supposed to prevent it... but doesn't really want to. Or simply doesn't want to fight The Hero. To avoid being punished for aiding, the guard has to pretend they tried to resist, but were defeated. This generally means that the guard will be tied up and/or smacked around a bit to make it look genuine. This is generally somewhat Played for Laughs, especially when the hero takes it upon themselves to do this rather than their ally suggesting it. Often involves Tap on the Head.

Alone-with-Prisoner Ploy may include the prisoner doing it; The Infiltration may put the undercover participant in either or both roles. Apologetic Attacker and Hit Me, Dammit! are to be expected. May involve delays if the "attacker" Wouldn't Hit a Girl or has other such restrictions and has to circumvent or get over it. Compare Passive Rescue (which may overlap, if the guard provides the means to be taken "hostage" or otherwise overpowered) and Wounded Gazelle Gambit.

Not to be confused with Make It Look Like an Accident, which is about covering up a murder by disguising the cause of death.

    "I'm not crazy!"
    
-   In _Dragon Bones_, Ward uses that method, but in an inversion, it is he, the hero, who is hit over the head to make him look as if he was unconscious.

-   In one of the _Night Watch (Series)_ books the protagonist is going to pass the guard. He is one of the Others, thus so absurdly overpowered a human doesn't really stand any chance against him, simply because he would just mind control him into letting him go. Though there's a tricky rule of balancing stuff: if the good guys cast some magic, the bad guys get a right to do that. So he decides to go take a Refuge in Audacity, since the guard knows he's the Other.
    
    "Dude, at least have decency to give me a black eye."  
    "Nah, I'm in a hurry, do that yourself."

-   _Star Wars Expanded Universe_:
    -   _Ahsoka_ has an unusual example: R2-D2, after agreeing to help the title character sneak onboard the _Tantive IV_ to see Bail Organa, activates a circuit making it look like she deactivated him with a shocker. It's unusual because ultimately, everyone involved is on the same side.
-   _The Tomorrow War_ by Alexander Zorich. When a desperate employee running from Peace & Love Incorporated hijacks a freighter ship, the navigator sets up a jump quickly, because she isn't enthusiastic about having corporate security assault the ship, then staying in detention while it's all sorted out if she survives the cross-fire — she's hurrying to a wedding. She only insists that a pirate strike her with a pistol handle — on her cheek-bone, so that it will be visible.

Apparently they're not being very gentle about it, as a policeman keeps interrupting the briefing to inflict the same injuries on Hale.
    
    **Handler:** We better wrap things up before they break the poor man's legs.
    
-   Defied in the _The Wheel of Time_ novel _The Dragon Reborn_. Egwene, escaping an order of women who turn magically-gifted women into slaves, leaves her captor restrained by the control collar that was used on her. The woman, who knows that the collar only works on those who have some magic, begs for this trope in vain; Egwene leaves her to be discovered and probably enslaved herself.

-   In _Sidekick Girl_, Tornado Boy punches unwilling henchman Coldfire during a mission. Though probably not really the reason he did so (Coldfire is dating Sidekick Girl in their civilian identities, and Tornado Boy has a crush on her), Coldfire says that it's good that he has the black eye resulting from it, as it would look suspicious if he just let the heroes walk on through without a fight.

-   In _Hey Arnold!_ Helga inadvertently angers Big Patty, who vows to beat her up as a result. Terrified, Helga decides to handle the situation in a civil manner and issues an apology. Patty accepts and Helga happily declares that their scheduled confrontation is canceled. Patty apologizes says that she still needs to beat Helga up because she'd already vowed to do so and didn't want people to think she was a liar. The titular character has his own private talk with Patty and eventually, she decides to make it look like a fight occurred. She pushes Helga in a broom closet where the two make a bunch of loud noises, put mud on Helga's face and tear the sleeve of her shirt.

-   According to Corrie Ten Boom, an inside man helping The Resistance against the Nazis in the Netherlands who got their hands on some ration cards told the Resistance member who'd come to get the cards to make the pickup look like a robbery.
