**Volus**: You can't turn your back on these clanless quarians. Thieves, all of them.

**Tali**: Quarians are only forced to steal when people like you won't let them have real jobs.

**Volus**: And to think my taxes pay to support you here. Go back to your fleet, clanless.

Fictional societies can take on a wide variety of forms, from the familiar to the utterly alien. However, many adhere at least partly to a hierarchy that usually consists of a ruling class, a middle class (if such a thing exists in this setting), and a working class.

And then you have the Underclass: this level of society is _below_ the working class, often impoverished, unemployed, oppressed and regarded with contempt by those above them, even treated as slaves in some cases. In many cases (though not all) they make up the lowest percentage of the population, their limited numbers making them easier to abuse or marginalize.

The reasons for this vary: in some cases, the members of this class will be some kind of racial or political minority discriminated against by the mainstream, but not enough to be persecuted to the point of extermination; in others, they may have been forced into this group from birth as part of some form of Fantastic Caste System; in a few examples, the Underclass may consist of individuals who have been exiled for some offense against the law - real or perceived; and in some rare cases, people have ended up here due to sheer bad luck. Whatever the case, these unlucky folk are considered the lowest of the low and have little hope of escaping their unfortunate status.

Most likely to be found in a Fantastic Ghetto of some description. Often an example of Fantastic Racism on a society-wide scale, with members tolerated _just_ enough to permit their survival... though in a few very unfortunate cases, this can change for the worst.

Compare and contrast Slave Race and Servant Race, who may end up in this societal niche if treated badly enough.

No real-life examples, please.
