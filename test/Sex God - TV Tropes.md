_"Jewish women are very hot, love to experiment, and always please their man."_

A character possesses In-Universe extraordinary prowess in both scoring and giving physical sexual pleasure to their partner(s). A soft caress on the cheek from such a person can leave the subject a flustered bundle of sexual excitement, a body massage under their hands would be a heavenly experience, while the luckier ones who get to bed this character would most probably be in for the most intensely multi-orgasmic night they've ever had in their lives.

The reasons behind said prowess varies. Sometimes it's simply due to knowing "how to touch them right", sometimes it's through special sex techniques, sometimes it's by knowing how to make the best out of a larger than average tool, sometimes it's because they really care about their partner's pleasure, sometimes it's stamina, sometimes it might be actual magic, and sometimes, it's simply being a vampire. The Power Perversion Potential for this ability should be very obvious, assuming that it isn't itself a result of Power Perversion Potential. This an almost mandatory part of a succubus or incubus' inventory of abilities. Many pornographic works tend to depict their male characters as this; for live-action ones, this would be an Informed Ability, given that they don't actually do anything "special" on-screen.

**Note:** This trope is neither tied to a specific gender nor tied to a specific sexual orientation. Also, being able to do one or two "tricks" to get one's partner to hit the O-zone **does not qualify** for this trope. The character is supposed to be (hailed as) a veritable _expert_ in carnal delights, not a "one-trick pony".

May serve as a justification for the attractiveness behind the Chick Magnet, the Head-Turning Beauty, the Pornomancer, or the Kavorka Man.

**Not to be confused with an _actual_ deity of sexual activity**, though due to their particular domain, they often _are_ Sex Gods by necessity.

Compare with The Casanova and especially The Pornomancer, who both excel in sexual prowess and _seduction_ rather than giving _sexual pleasure_ alone. Though being a _consistently successful_ and sought after lover would usually entail being a Sex God, too. For characters who are consistently _bad_ in bed, see Lousy Lovers Are Losers.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Butler_: Because he's a demon disguised in the form his master ordered him to (a polite butler), Sebastian interrogates a cult member... _very_ convincingly.
    
    **Woman:** I can see the Gates of Heaven!  
    **Sebastian:** _\[unamused\]_ Oh I _highly_ doubt that.
    
-   _Cross Ange_: After Tusk returns from his Disney Death, Ange is completely in disbelief that he's alive after she was sure she watched him blow himself up. But just to be sure he's there, she decides to make love to him right then and there. This is Their First Time, and later, in Episode 24, Tusk brags to Embryo, who has his own creepy crush on Ange, that they went three days and nights. And boy, does that piss Embryo off when he learns that Ange's purity was taken.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: To say Clara's a virgin, she definitely knows how to satisfy other women.
    -   Such as when she thoroughly ravished the entire staff at N.U.D.E. HQ; including her three best friends and Sister Velocity<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> :
        
        **Sister Velocity:** _\[drooling\]_ God, please forgive me... My sinful body is drowning in pleasure....  
        _\[Velocity's eyes roll back as she experiences orgasm and faints\]_
        
    -   Clara follows up by creating physical copies of herself to simultaneously gangbang her mother, Athena, and gives the MILF of Steel the mother of all orgasms. It's so intense that both of them to pass out from it. The parasite doesn't survive, having been reduced to a withered husk by the release of their combined energy.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ gives us Panty, a Lovable Sex Maniac to the nth degree. She is a real master in these activities, and it shows from the lucky men's highly positive comments about her sex techniques. One even thought she was more a devil than an angel. Stocking also has an active sex life, and is claimed to be this too by a guy who banged both of them.
-   Vincent Nightray of _PandoraHearts_ _really_ gets around with the noblewomen despite (or possibly _because of_) the fact that he can't stand them.
-   _Maken-ki!_ has three between its main villain, Love Espada, and a living teddy bear.
    -   Old age has done nothing to quell Ouken Yamato's libido. The opening scene in chapter 32 had him bang one of his concubines so hard, that the guardian statue outside the bedchamber toppled over. The following page shows him being dressed by two more, while several others are shown passed out on the floor around him and the one he finished shagging is seen collapsed in her bed. His secretary, Miyabi, had been watching and was so aroused by it, that she started dripping.
    -   In chapter 76, Himegami explains that Espada is said to have seduced over 100 girls, during the school's previous Himekagura Festival. Said while she and Usui are eavesdropping on her as she's having sex with Kyoki in one of the school's club rooms. Afterward, Kyoki's shown wearing a PE swimsuit with cat ears and a matching collar, having become the newest of Espada's Sex Slaves.
        -   Three chapters later, Espada has her way with another group of girls off-panel and leaves them trembling at her feet, in orgasm.
    -   Rudolf is a living teddy bear, who's able to make women collapse from pleasure by simply fondling their breasts. The shopkeeper Himegami bought him from confessed to having been one of his lovers, until she found him cheating on her with three other women. She took him back, but eventually put him up for sale to keep from being tempted by him again. Later, Himegami tries to get rid of Rudolf by summoning Nozuchi, but makes the mistake of leaving her alone with him. By the time she returns, Rudolf has banged Nozuchi and is seen having a cigar.
-   _Yosuga no Sora_: No matter what girl he ends up with, Haruka phenomenally excels at pleasuring her.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_: According to Quarrel, Crackerjack is _fantastic_ in bed.
-   _Fine Print_: What the Cubi are really, as a species (they hate being called demons). They offer humans the best sex in their life for around a year (the golden contract) to gain sexual energy the Cubi need for creating their food in return. Lauren's reaction to having sex with Merryl as a test to prove it's true indicates they can definitely deliver. Given they're minor literal gods it's explicitly a supernatural gift they have.

    Fan Works 

-   Many, if not all, Ethical Sluts, Chivalrous Perverts and Good Bad Girls are likely to have this trope applied to them, often despite Canon evidence to the contrary; even Ms. Fanservice\-type and Ladette\-type who exhibit none of the aforementioned tropes are still vulnerable to this via flanderization. And for a Draco in Leather Pants who has their sexual skills mentioned In-Universe, it's seen as a nigh-mandatory requirement.
-   Shinji of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ is one in _Alpha and Omega_ due to his mother uploading all of her knowledge into his brain, including tantric massage. It helps that several of the women he's slept with as "The Shadow Consort" are Asari and he studied everything he could find on them, particularly physiology.
-   _Child of the Storm_ has Betsy Braddock, a Good Bad Girl and Ethical Slut who uses her telepathy to adjust her approach in bed to each individual partner, and an afternoon with her leaves renowned casanova, Fandral the Dashing, _a literal god_ with over 1500 years of experience (and thus an example in his own right), in a daze.
-   _The Naked Jedi_: Sarza has a good Coordination skill, and before the end of the first story has the Enhance Force Power upgrade that lets her roll her Force Rating as part of a Coordination check, spending Force Points on Sucess or Advantage. Meaning that despite her inexperience, she's a very capable lover. Some differences between Zeltrons and humans are also noted, and while they apply no mechanical benefit, they likely qualify the species as a whole for this trope.
-   _New Tamaran_:
    -   Robin is seen as this by his lovers, both past (Supergirl, Wonder Girl, Batgirl) and present (Starfire).
    -   Thanks to her super-senses, Supergirl can make every sexual experience a perfect one, making other young heroes quite happy when she comes to visit.
    -   Bumblebee learned how to be one as a student at HIVE Academy, and continues to be one to both Aqualad and Speedy.
    -   In the prequel _A Brief History of Superheroics_, Lois Lane describes Superman as such.
-   _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Tempest Rewrite_: Mina, Emma, and Orlando use the skils they've acquired across centuries and planets to give each other the ultimate wedding night.
-   Xander in _The List_ apparently once put a Succubus into a coma. Buffy gets very annoyed when he starts calling himself "The Sexual Slayer".
-   In defender2222's more humorous _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfics, Cadance is depicted as a literal case of this trope, as one of the perks of being the Goddess of Love. Apparently, a hockey game she went to was called off after it became an orgy.
-   Deconstructed in in Chapter 27 of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_. Anna notes that the lover she had who sired Arnold is by far the most sexually pleasing lover she ever had, but she notes that the physical pleasure involved was missing something. She notes that two later lovers, who were nowhere near as good as he was, had it. Basically, the point there is just being an excellent lover physically can't match lower quality love making where genuine affection and care are in play. Notably, Reset is a harem fic, where characters capable of immense physical love to every XX chromosomed being the writer likes is commonplace and often exists in place of non-sexual romantic connections.
-   Hiccup in _Persephone_ has a lot of experience in the ways of a woman's body through sailors daughters looking for overnight companionship at harbor. This experience comes in handy when he and Astrid are in a relationship, evoking the trope's name when Ruffnut asks what its like for her in the sack with him.
-   After being made a god, Tony Stark in _One Hell of a Ride_ quickly starts being able to exhaust Hela each night. When he later learns his domain (as knowing one's domain makes a god that much stronger at it), it's revealed Tony became the god of wealth and sex.
-   _Fate DxD AU_: Ritsuka is really experienced in bed due to having to keep up with the superhuman Servants he sleeps with, especially Jeanne and Artoria Alter. When he sleeps with Rias and Akeno, he lasts so long that they pass out from exhaustion. As he puts it, he's a marathoner, not a sprinter.
-   In two separate _Law & Order: UK_ stories, after they consummate their relationship, Alesha is floored at the realization that the rumors and speculations that she'd heard about Matt's bedroom skills — which _already_ implied that he was this trope — _under_estimated how good a lover he is.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_, Lieutenant Ilia is a Deltan, who must register an Oath of Celibacy upon coming aboard the _Enterprise_.
-   Chevy Chase's character in _Modern Problems_ was able to give his girlfriend sexual pleasure via telekinesis.
-   Jim Carrey's character in _Bruce Almighty_ is temporarily given all of God's powers, and in a rather literal example, one of the first things that Bruce does with his powers is to have hot sex with his girlfriend. And what does this involve? Making his girlfriend have the most intense orgasms of her (and probably everyone else's) life, simply by saying the words "pleasure" and "pleasurable" to her, followed my some off screen screams of pleasure as they "get busy". Bruce even lampshades the trope name in the morning when he describes the experience as "heavenly".
-   Spoofed, along with Black Is Bigger in Bed and Sex–Face Turn, in _Blazing Saddles_. Hedley Lamarr sends a German Femme Fatale (and parody of Marlene Dietrich) named Lili von Shtupp to seduce Bart. However, Bart turns out to not only be very well-endowed, but good enough in bed that it contributes to Lili switching sides.
-   In _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_, Steve Carell's character finally breaks his duck with an as-expected three-thrust wonder. The action then cuts to some time later after his second performance and it's clear he's astonished his more experienced new wife with "natural talent".

-   In _What Women Want_ the protagonist uses his mind-reading powers while having sex to find out what she finds most pleasurable, giving her the best sex of her life.
-   Satan from _End of Days_. All of the women he encounters are powerless against him. When he first arrives on Earth he French-kisses a woman and fondles her breast in a crowded restaurant and she seems thrilled by it. Then he has a threesome with a mother and her daughter. Even Christine, who _knows_ that Satan wants to impregnate her with the Antichrist, feels strangely powerless to resist him.
-   Like the example above, Satan is this again in _The Devil's Advocate_. He brags to Kevin about how he completely wore a woman out to the point that she believed an entire football team had their way with her and is shocked to see that it's just unassuming him. He charms Kevin's wife Mary-Ann and later violently rapes her. It's heavily implied that he has sex with his own daughter who is Kevin's half-sister. And one scene shows a woman giving him head while Kevin watches.
-   In _The Destroyer_ literary series, Remo Williams can use his knowledge of pressure points to bring any woman to orgasm. This is Played With in the Film of the Book and TV series pilot.
    -   In the film Chiun claims to know the pressure points to bring a woman to Nirvana. When Remo asks him what they are, he shows Remo how to tap his wrist with a regular beat. Remo asks if that's the first point, Chiun says "No, that is how you know when the rice is done." and removes the rice that had been cooking off the burner.
    -   In another scene, the female lead is rambling on about something; Chiun takes her hand and taps an intricate pattern onto it. She gasps, slumps down, and stares into space dazed.
    -   In the TV pilot, Remo tries the wrist-tapping on a woman and asks her if it does anything for her. It doesn't.
-   In the 2005 film _Casanova_ there appears to be an entire order of nuns willing to add another notch to Casanova's bedpost. When admonished for risking (or perhaps earning, in the eyes of the inquisitor), eternal damnation for a single night with Casanova, the response is "seems fair."
-   Implied to be André's case in _One Hour with You_ when his wife Colette whispers inaudibly about him to Mitzi, and the two of them gaze at him mischievously as his jaw drops in embarrassment. Take into consideration that the movie is about the couple enjoying their sex life...
-   In _Hot Bot_, the "Hot Bots" are all supposed to be this, with the Bardot model being supposedly the best when it comes to pleasuring their clients.
-   In _Art of the Dead_, Gina gets an Extreme Libido under the effect of the Lust painting, and gives Dylan the best sex they ever had. He claims it almost gave him a heart attack.
-   _À l'aventure_: Greg is a very good lover, with every woman he sleeps with very satisfied. He can also hypnotize others to experience sexual pleasure that's more intense than they ever had before.

    Literature 

-   Iason Mink of the futuristic _Ai no Kusabi_ is an Artificial Human with better prowess than that of a Sex Bot as evidenced by his human Sex Slave's musings. His abilities to prove Bigger Is Better in Bed at will (and any size he so chooses) and find a person's most sensitive erogenous zones within seconds only reinforces this status.
-   In BR Kingsolver's _Gifts Of The Godess_ series, all of the succubi (who are actually humans with telepathic powers) fit this description.
-   Jerin in _A Brother's Price_ is portrayed like this. His being a society where men marry all the sisters in a family, his father and grandfather considered it advisable to give him tips on how to keep all his wives happy. His wives, who are not at all inexperienced, are indeed very happy with his skills.
-   _Constance Verity Saves the World_: Connie's sex-life is just as fantastical as the rest of her life, having studied under the Pleasure Priests of Aphros. Allegedly, people agree wholeheartedly to be executed after a night with one of them to keep their secrets _because they're that good._
    
    **Connie:** The pleasure priests believe the best sex eschews props, relying on the infinite pleasures available through pure physical contact.  
    **Tia:** Sounds like a fun bunch.
    
-   In the _Earth's Children_ series, Jondalar is portrayed like this, due in no small part to his hardware and how well it and Ayla's own fit together.
-   _The Destroyer_ series: In one of the books, it's noted that Remo can use his knowledge of Sinanju to bring any woman to orgasm by touching her pressure points in a specific order. The downside to this is that no woman he's tried it on has lasted past the first few steps, which amount to hand massage. He never gets to the point where _he_ gets any fun out of it.
-   Candance "Cannie" Shapiro", the female protagonist of the Jennifer Weiner novel titled, er, _Good in Bed._ However, it's a more depressing/deconstructed example, as their experiences are used for several articles by her ex without her consent, and later as an attempt to save face after he finally gets word about impregnating her.
-   Any courtesan in _Kushiel's Legacy_, where the nation of Terre D'Ange reveres prostitution as a sacred act, but especially the protagonist, Phedre.
-   As a Canon Sue, Robert A. Heinlein's Lazarus Long is one.
-   The main character and his mistress in Trevanian's _Shibumi_ are level 4 sexual adepts. The main character's favorite variant is where they sit/kneel at opposite walls of an empty room and try to make the other person orgasm first through sheer concentration. He later abandons it because of the lack of affection involved.
-   _Anansi Boys_: "He was part animal, part god, part unstoppable sex machine," referring to Spider who likes to party with the mortals.
    -   Subverted in that while this in general applies to Spider (who is a god, after all) in this scene it's said to his twin brother who's pretty lame with the ladies. He is being teased here- he actually passed out the night before and nothing happened.
-   _The Kingkiller Chronicle_: In _The Wise Man's Fear_, the Fae Felurian is considered a sex goddess, leaving men as empty husks who soon die after she leaves them because they will never experience anything like it again. Kvothe manages to resist her initial charms and bargains to become her apprentice instead of being executed. He escapes the forest as a Sex God too.
-   _Dune_
    -   Probably every Bene Geserit would be this by default given that they can control their bodies at the cellular level, manipulate emotions, etc.
    -   In _Heretics of Dune_ and _Chapterhouse: Dune_, the "Honored Matres" who came back from the Scattering make this almost literal: their sexual skills are such that men who have sex with them have an unbreakable compulsion to obey them. Well, almost unbreakable. The _ghola_ of Duncan Idaho manages it, but only by doing this trope _back at_ Murbella.
-   Daemon Sadi in the _Black Jewels_ series, who was kept as a sex slave for several centuries despite his magical power and his incredibly lethal temper. He learned to weaponize his sexual allure and skills (e.g., pleasuring to the point of pain) so well that people began calling him "the Sadist", but that didn't prevent people from trying to bed him.
-   _How to Be a Superhero_ informs wanna-be superheroes to make their robot doubles be _almost_ exact duplicates, except where necessary to avoid this trope:
    
    **Girlfriend:** "God, you were _fabulous_ last night!"  
    **Superhero:** "What? IN BED?"  
    **Girlfriend:** "In bed... on the floor in front of the fire... in the bathtub... on the stairs... on top of the breakfast bar... behind the couch... in the attic... on the porch... in the rocking chair... inside the closet... under the bed... what a night! Whooo!"
    
-   _The Dresden Files_
    -   Thanks to being a White Court Vampire - specifically, a Raith - Thomas is one, but it's justified because that's exactly how he feeds—by giving them mindblowing sex and absorbing their emotions. Harry is more than a little jealous of his exploits, despite knowing it's a trade off being a predator.
        -   His sister, Lara, is even better. As Dresden notes at one point, Lara once told him she could do more to him in an hour than a mortal woman could in a week. Going by the simple experience of a _kiss_ in _White Night_, she wasn't exaggerating.
    -   Amusingly enough, Harry isn't half-bad in the sack either, if Susan's sex scene, Elaine's lingering but definite approval for certain memories of their relationship, and the very experienced Luccio's vigorous approval of their physical relationship are any indication. Plus, there's always the Erotic Dream in _Skin Game_ where we find out Harry quite likes to, er, eat out, to Dream!Murphy's utter delight, and in the next book he's implied to very creative in getting around the fact that Murphy is recovering from a destroyed knee.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   From all of their encounters, their growing attracion and Ygritte's accounts, Jon Snow certanly knows something.
    -   Arianne Martell seems to qualify. Casual sex is one of her favorite pastimes, and one she's gotten quite good at. Arys describes her as being an incredibly skilled lover, and she herself describes she spent a long time "training" him before he was able to keep up with her in bed.
-   In the _Vorkosigan Saga_, it's notable that despite some early trouble in finding partners who'll look past his unusual looks, nobody Miles sleeps with can resist coming back for more. It's also implied he has a particularly nimble and flexible tongue.
    -   Honourable mention should also go to his cousin Ivan, who once managed to seduce two beautiful Cetagandan ladies at once and satisfy them several times, despite having been fed a powerful anaphrodisiac by an enemy and having to do battle without his best weapon.
-   _Swan's Braid & Other Tales of Terizan_: In "Swan's Braid" Swan is apparently quite good in bed given Terazin's happy reflections on it after they have sex.
-   _The Chronicles of Dorsa_: Joslyn is very skilled at having sex with women. When she's with Tasia, she always gives her an intense orgasm.
-   _The Change Room_: Shar is extremely good at giving women orgasms, as Eliza learns. Eliza gets six in a row from her when they first have sex at Shar's place.
-   _Third Time Lucky: And Other Stories of the Most Powerful Wizard in the World_: Magdelene is apparently a fantastic lover. After they have sex off page, the captain in "Third Time Lucky" is quite drained and impressed, with her other lovers showing equally satisfied reactions.
-   Nahri in _The Daevabad Trilogy_ notes that this is the one thing that makes her Arranged Marriage not _entirely_ horrible - her husband Muntadhir Really Gets Around, and has had enough practice to be _excellent_ at what he does.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Sex Gods_ the series, Divi Filius is the son and incarnation of a deity who obsessed with sex.
-   An episode of _Seinfeld_ has a plot revolving around George and Puddy employing one of Jerry's "moves" for their girlfriends because it works so well. While Elaine claims in another episode to have faked her orgasms every time she slept with him, she also says that it wasn't his fault; she just had difficulty getting off in general.
-   Joey from _Friends_ is sometimes portrayed as an extremely satisfying lover; so is Chandler after some coaching from Monica and Rachel when he dates one of Joey's exes.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Vampires Are Sex Gods, right? Well Spike raves about how superhuman Buffy is in the sack, including going for five hours and _bite marks._ High praise indeed.
    -   Xander Harris, for that matter, is apparently "a real Viking in the sack!" At least according to Anya, and she would know, seeing as she _was_ a (literal) real Viking once upon a time. Heck, he even pleases Faith, her comments on his prowess being positive except when she was evil and imitating Buffy.
-   The inventor of the "Venus butterfly" on _L.A. Law_.
-   The cryptically named "The Immortal" from _Angel_ is _the_ sex god, on top of being an absolute badass. At one point in their history, he wiped the floor with both Spike and Angel, then tortured them and proceeded to "violate" Darla and Drusilla...at the same time, _with consent_. Sometime after, he wrote a truly life-changing self-help book, landed Spike in jail for tax evasion, then wooed Buffy - though that last part was seemingly made up by Andrew... probably. Word of God suggested that he knew it was a decoy and went with it precisely because it would piss off Spike and Angel - while running rings around them across Rome in the caper of the week, including getting them blown up, destroying Spike's beloved coat, then delivering the MacGuffin to the LA office. And _we never even see him_. There's a _very_ good reason both Angel and Spike hate the guy.
-   In the final episode of _Weird Science_, Gary shows up with an alien girlfriend. Considering she looks the same as the rest of the weird-looking humanoid aliens of the species, nothing like a Green-Skinned Space Babe or Cute Monster Girl, Wyatt wonders what exactly he sees in her — until he finds out just touching her hand feels so good that it causes him to do an ecstatic Jim Carrey / Jerry Lewis imitation. Apparently it's a feature of the species.
-   Captain Jack Harkness of _Torchwood_. According to himself anyhow.
-   _Mad Men_ gives us Don Draper, whom Bobbie Barret confirms that his skills are remarkable.
-   In an episode of the 1st season of _ER_, Doug's current girlfriend casually mentions to Carol, that "he's (Doug) _great_ in bed". Carol's flustered reaction implies that she's fully aware of this (as she should be, given that they used to date). Another episode has Carol confiding to someone that within minutes of him arriving at her house to pick her up for their first date, they were having sex on her kitchen floor.
-   On _Game of Thrones_, Tyrion gifts his squire Podrick (who is a virgin, mind you) with the services of 3 prostitutes at Littlefinger's brothel as thanks for him saving his life during the Battle of the Blackwater. Podrick returns, and gives back the money that Tyrion gave him to pay the prostitutes. Apparently, Pod was so good that they did it for free. Bronn and Tyrion, stunned and a little jealous, ask him for details ... copious details. In a later episode, some ladies of the court loudly swoon over him as he walks by them. Even Varys, who's asexual and a eunuch to boot, is curious about how he manages it. Since Podrick's manhood is said to be of about average size, it's implied that he's just a natural prodigy.
-   _Ginny and Georgia_: Ginny tells her friends that Hunter is very skilled with his tongue after he goes down on her.
-   On _How I Met Your Mother_ Barney, who could be considered a Sex God himself, tries to bed Professor Lewis aka The Cougar. She manages to amaze him with her sexual prowess and his efforts to give her the same satisfaction ends with him dislocating his hip. She still only gave him a B+.
-   _Imposters_: Richard is quite good in bed, to judge by the loud cries from the woman he has sex with\]\].
-   _Lucifer_: Lucifer's frequent claim that he's very good in bed isn't a lie. When two murders appear linked by his love life, the precinct interviews every lover he's had over the previous eight weeks — a dry spell involving "only" 92 people who all insist he's the best sex they've ever had. When Lucifer learns he has an impersonator, he's angry that the guy's terrible bedroom skill endangers his own sex god reputation. As he once says to Amenadiel, his skills in the bedroom are preternatural.
-   _Sex/Life_: Brad is extremely good at sex, which is a big part of the reason Billie fantasizes and reminisces about him so much, given that her current sex life with Cooper leaves her unsatisfied. Billie herself seems to have been something of a Sex Goddess back in her younger days, but her passion has faded away over the years.
-   _True Blood_: In her final appearance, Violet rants about how, in eight hundred years, none of her lovers prior to Jason have ever wanted to give up having sex with her. Of course, based on the events of that episode, it's possible that at least some of them weren't as much enamored with Violet as they were scared of triggering her Woman Scorned tendencies.
    
    **Violet:** Do you realize that I've brought some of the most powerful men in history to their knees by casting a single glance? Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, they were shells. Beautiful to look at, but hollow once penetrated. But me? No one has ever wanted out once allowed in.
    
-   _Dark Desire_: Darío is apparently _very_ skilled at sex, since every women he's had it with seems highly satisfied and also often rushes back to have more (even when otherwise the relationship was horrible).
-   _You Me Her_:
    -   It turns out Andy is highly skilled at sex, having given Nina multiple orgasms.
    -   Shaun too later is capable of having sex with Nina four times in a row, satisfying her deeply, and she even says his penis is "magic".
-   _Never Have I Ever_: Ethan confidently says Devi will enjoy having sex with him much more than Ben (who disappointed her). Judging by her awed look afterward and softly saying "Wow" he's very good.
-   _Scrubs_: According to Jordan, Kim and Elliot, J.D. is good at sex. Jordan taunts Perry about how good it was. Kim and Elliot are both in agreement that J.D. is better at sex than Sean, but that Sean is better at foreplay, with Elliot explaining that J.D. takes foreplay too literally.

    Music 

-   Both the main protagonist and her partner are this in "Lovin' All Night" by Rodney Crowell.
-   The song "Rock Me" by ABBA implies this. Every night they're at it in the bedroom and enjoy every second of it.
-   Billy Ward and his Dominoes have Lovin' Dan, the protagonist of "Sixty Minute Man". As the song's title suggests, he's capable of pleasuring a woman for an hour straight. Unfortunately, by the time of the Sequel Song, he's suffered a Heroic RRoD after finally finding a partner who can keep up with him in bed.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Most, if not all, Love Goddesses (or Love Gods) have been portrayed as this in at least one interpretation of their myths.
-   Classical Mythology: It's implied that a side effect of Heracles' prodigious strength and endurance is enormous sexual prowess borne from sheer stamina. One story says that King Thespius asked Heracles to sleep with all fifty of his daughters, since he was anxious to have grandchildren by him. Heracles was able to knock all of them up in a single night.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In the _Conan the Roleplaying Game_ there is the temptress class. At high levels the tempress gains the ability to have such energetic and exhausting sex with a willing partner that afterward the partner will fall into a deep slumber where they can only be awakened by attacking them (or dumping a bucket of water on them). She is also so skilled at seduction that she can easily manipulate men into doing her bidding.

    Webcomics 

-   El Chupacabra in _Girly_ possesses legendary skills to please any woman (and practically every woman) he ever faces. The action itself is never shown, but the immediate aftermath, quite a lot. Generally the ladies are barely able to walk from all the fun their nerves had.
-   _Ménage à 3_ has two contrasting figures:
    -   Zii is an enthusiastic bisexual seductress who gets a lot of practice, and her _psychological_ effects are intense (one of her ex-lovers said that she made him feel like the most desirable person in the world). Her abilities aren't actually supernatural, but her skill is such that a girl she slept with in _high school_ found the experience so good that it drove her to become a porn star just so she could have more sex.
    -   DiDi, on the other hand, has virtually supernatural attractiveness, to the point that her male partners tend to suffer from premature ejaculation and experienced bisexual women can be quite intimidated by the idea of sex with her. But it doesn't seem like she's actually especially good at sex, technically speaking; she's never had to be, and she lacks the empathy that she really needs for the purpose.
    -   And then there's Gary, who by fate's cruel hand was taught a kissing technique that he accidentally discovered gave spectacular results when used for cunnilingus. This quickly gave him a reputation as an Oral Sex God, and he had women lining up at his door... but only so they could use him as a glorified vibrator and then leave without giving him so much as a "thank you" in return. Gary, being Gary, was unable to say no, and after they were done with him, his jaw was so sore he wasn't able to say much of anything else either.
-   _Oglaf_:
    -   A straight example is the woman who won the trophy for "Best at Sex," narrowly beating her partner (the trophy is enchanted and indicates who's better in bed). Though she's hoping to get the trophy for "Best at Puns" as well.
    -   There's a subversion with a guy who has this reputation, but in actuality he's a merely average lover who has a magic amulet. He originally wanted an amulet of sexual prowess, but there's no such thing, so instead he got an "amulet of making people say you're awesome in bed even though you're not."
        
        **Disgruntled Woman:** ...and you won't believe how good he is in bed!  
        **Annoyed Woman:** Yes, I've had him too and I heartily concur.
        
    -   One man is cursed by a spirit to become the "Supreme Fellator," the best in the world at giving blowjobs.

    -   Another man had the infamous wish dolly enchant his penis to make his partners orgasm instantly. Unfortunately, he discovers that no one can last enough to reciprocate, not even his hand, or the aforementioned "King Blowjob."
