_"I come from a long line of great meatloaf chefs! The recipe was first created by my great grandmother, Gretel Doofenshmirtz…. The secret ingredient— was_ hate_. Usually it's love, but Great-Grandma Gretel had some issues."_

Grandma's Recipe is supposedly the list of ingredients — some of which might be secret — needed to create some of the best foodstuffs imaginable. The food can be anything under the sun, but it will be some sort of Comfort Food most of the time, often cookies. It may even have therapeutic properties, as in Soup Is Medicine. Characters will either find this recipe and use it to their advantage in the plot, or they try to replicate it, which may or may not be successful.

It doesn't particularly have to be Grandma's, but the basic trope is that someone's "old recipe" is a one-way ticket to the most delicious stuff imaginable.

The recipe may contain some Insubstantial Ingredients that make it taste so special: something like "kindness" or "happy thoughts" or, of course, "love." The Grandma (or Grandma-figure) in question is almost always a Granny Classic.

Giving off this feel is a common approach to advertising food. Many products feature kind-looking old women on the packaging or are named after someone's (assumed) grandmother.

A common inversion is for Grandma to be a Cordon Bleugh Chef.

There's also two servings in a bottle so you can use it twice before running out, and you can receive more for free indefinitely anytime you return home. The only downside is that you can only carry one bottle of it at a time. It's also the only bottled item that makes Link smile before drinking, where potions get a grimace.

Naturally, Garfield was named the judge of the competition. They initially tried substituting cheap, low-quality ingredients, but even after they faithfully followed the recipe they still couldn't make a pizza that was as good as Grandma's. After they gave up, Garfield revealed her secret: she paid attention to what she was cooking and tasted it to see if it needed extra seasoning or other tweaks, while the corporate cooks just mechanically followed the recipe.

-   The Italian restaurant Enoteca Maria in Staten Island employs a diverse team of actual grandmothers who each get an evening to cook their own special menus based on their traditional cuisines. Despite the menu never being the same two nights in a row, the "Nonnas" are a great hit with the public.
-   Many, many cookbooks, websites, and collections of recipes have large sections of home cooking Comfort Food entrees with the description "Just like Grandma used to make."
-   Truth in Television: It stands to reason that anyone, such as a grandmother, who spends several decades making home-cooked food every day might be expected to become quite good at it. (The Nostalgia Filter is also possibly a factor, but don't tell people that.) (Often, it turns out Grandmother cribbed the recipe from a well-known cookbook or even the back of a food package, but don't tell people that, either.)
