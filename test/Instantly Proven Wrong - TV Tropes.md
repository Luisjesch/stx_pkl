Instantly Proven Wrong is a comedic device where a character confidently asserts something, only to have reality swiftly, decisively, and often comically contradict them.

This trope thrives on the rapid and often embarrassing exposure of the character's misguided belief, boast, or prediction. It's a quick turn of events, usually played for laughs or irony, as the universe or circumstances conspire to immediately reveal the falsehood in their statement.

A form of Hypocritical Humor. May result in an attempt of Verbal Backspace, Last-Second Word Swap, or Implausible Deniability.

Compare with:

-   Tempting Fate: The universe punishes a character, and as a side effect it proves them wrong. In this trope, being proven wrong (or a liar) _is_ the punishment. Also Tempting Fate mostly applies to predictions (explicit or implicit) that characters make about their own futures. This trope can apply to a much broader range of statements.
-   Cue the Flying Pigs: A character makes a bet on a close-to-impossible outcome and is proven wrong.
-   Description Cut: The character remains unaware of the contradiction because it happens at another place that the scene cuts to.
-   Gilligan Cut: The proving wrong only _appears_ instantaneous due to the narrative omitting intervening events.
-   Immediate Self-Contradiction: The contradiction is brought about by the character themself and not by outside forces.
-   Implausible Deniability: The exposure of some truth comes before the actual denial.
-   Joke and Receive: In this case, the character is instantly proven _right_, despite the statement being a joke or sarcasm.
-   Liar Revealed: The lie and its exposure are driving the plot while Instantly Proven Wrong is an inconsequential comedy element.

-   _The Muppet Movie_: In the "Movin' Right Along" musical number, Kermit tells Fozzie, "You take it, you know best."

    -   Benedict tries to tell himself that the Mass Super-Empowering Event was all just a bizarre shared hallucination. Hyeon immediately points out the gaping hole in the wall that was left by the event.

    Sports 

-   At one point during Super Bowl XXXI, as the Green Bay Packers were getting into position on a first down, one of the TV commentators remarked on how the Packers, trailing the New England Patriots 14-10 near the start of the second quarter, were really struggling to make plays, particularly on first downs, and "can't really do anything against \[the Patriots'\] defense". Almost the instant the last word left his mouth, the ball was snapped to Favre who proceeded to connect with Antonio Freeman for an 81-yard touchdown, putting the Packers up 17-14. From that point on, the Packers ruled the day, holding the lead for the rest of the game and ultimately defeating New England by a score of 35-21.
-   In 2005, MLB's New York Mets were playing the crosstown rival Yankees when relief pitcher Dae-Sung Koo, who had never previously batted in his entire professional career, stepped into the box against Randy Johnson, one of the greatest pitchers of all time. Fox Sports' Tim Mc Carver wasted no time criticizing Koo, saying "I'm just going to go out on a limp and say, thus far this young season, this is the biggest give-up at-bat....". _Those words had only just left his mouth_ when Koo hammered a deep shot into centre field for the only hit of his career.
-   Happened, quite hilariously, to commentator Tim Daggett at the 2008 USA Women's Gymnastics National Championships. He led up to Chellsie Memmel's vault by explaining that as Chellsie was coming back from injury and pacing herself in the run-up to the Olympics, she had only vaulted a Yurchenko full the previous day of competition, and how, while she was capable of more, he would be totally shocked if she did anything but play it safe because she "wasn't ready" for bigger and both she and her coaches knew it. He was just winding up this spiel when Chellsie not only busted out an upgraded — and very impressive — Yurchenko 1.5 vault, but flawlessly stuck the landing.
    
    **Al Trautwig:** _Excuse me,_ Mr. Daggett?
    
-   As a motorsports commentator, Murray Walker made a habit of this. Very frequently, he'd state that something would happen "unless I'm very much mistaken". This would immediately be followed by that something not happening and Walker commenting "I am very much mistaken!" Murray once lampshaded this habit: "I don't make mistakes. I make prophecies which immediately turn out to be wrong."
-   On December 21, 2021, Russian figure skating coach and former pair skater Alexei Mishin stated that during his lifetime no one will do a quadruple axel well. Five days later, at the Japanese National Championships, Yuzuru Hanyu jumped a quadruple axel. He two-footed the landing, but did not fall, and the jump was duly recorded as an underrotated quad axel (rather than an overrotated triple axel) on his score sheet. At the time, it was the best quad axel attempt on the record. Hanyu proceeded to announce immediately afterwards that he would participate in the 2022 Beijing Olympics in order to perfect his quad axel. However, it wasn't Hanyu who ended up the first to perform a fully ratified quad axel... it was 17-year-old American Ilia Malinin, who did it on September 14, 2022 at the lower-level U.S. Classic in Lake Placid, New York.

You can guess the rest.
        
        **Samuel Hayden:** You can't just _shoot a hole_ into the surface of Mars!  
        **VEGA:** The portal is ready.

    _\[Immediately comes back out of the hallway.\]_

Remy agreeably comments on the landmark's beauty, only for Nikolai to dryly point out that Remy _hates_ the Eiffel Tower and has said so for years. It's a humorous moment, but it also sets the tone for the route by making it clear the heroine can't necessarily trust in Remy's sincerity.

    **Soldier:** _\[Enters\]_ Um, sir, the diggers have run into a problem. They've tunneled down twenty feet and hit metal. They can't dig any further. The lab must be mostly buried under the ground, and all of it is made from the same magic... resistant... I... I think I'll be going now.

-   The _Game Grumps_ have an almost _uncanny_ ability to do this. Arin in particular, because he has a habit of talking from a place of authority but often is going in blind to a new game or playing one he hasn't touched in years. This leads to events like where he matter-of-factly declares that the ghosts in _Super Mario World_ don't cover their faces like they did in _Super Mario Bros. 3_... quite literally one full second before a massive ghost skanks onto the screen covering its face, confidently declaring a helicopter can't see him in _Dead Rising_ because "he's in the shadows"... and it completely rocks him the second he's done speaking, and chastizing Dan for searching for secrets in _Super Mario Bros._ because "he's never gonna find one"... right before Dan finds a Star before even advancing the screen.

    -   When playing _At Dead of Night_, he's trying to figure out how Jimmy works when searching a room for the hiding player.

-   Played up to the max in this video about strange things that National Football League players have been seen doing during a game. After one entry about running back Eddie Lacy eating something that was mistaken for a hot dog but which Lacy later claimed was just a pack of sunflower seeds, the video narrator remarks at length about how silly the misconception is because "you would never see an NFL player ever, _ever_ eat a hot dog during a game. You would never see that... There's literally no-one that would ever eat a hot dog during a game." After this spiel, he moves on to the next item in the list: "\[Quarterback\] Mark Sanchez eating a hot dog."
-   _The Nostalgia Critic_:
    -   In a running gag, the Critic will cite an often ridiculous hypothetical or cliché scenario that at least didn't happen, only for the screen to cut to exactly that. For example, during his review of _North_, he commends the movie for at least getting a Native American to play an Eskimo and not resorting to a cheap stunt such as putting someone like Kathy Bates in Brown Face... only to see that the film did exactly that.
    -   In his review of _Last Action Hero_, upon seeing a baffling cameo appearance by Sharon Stone and Robert Patrick as their characters from _Basic Instinct_ and _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_:
        
        **Critic:** You know, movie, I'm not sure if you know this, but, um... cameos have to make sense. Just because those two people were in movies doesn't mean it necessarily makes sense to have them in your movie. I mean, it's like having a cartoon cat running around all over the place— _\[It turns out to actually be in the movie\]_ WHAAAAA?! What the hell is that?! Are you serious? Why is there a cartoon cat there?! That doesn't make any sense!  
        _\[A clip from the movie plays: Jack Slater explains, "He's supposed to be back on duty. He was only suspended for a month."\]_ **Critic:** No, movie, no! There's no reason a cartoon cat should be there! It's like saying... Little Richard's in the movie! _\[Indeed, he is; the Critic pauses to think up more out-of-place cameos\]_ Jean-Claude Van Damme. _\[He's in it, too\]_ Jim Belushi. _\[Also true\]_ MC Hammer. _\[Ditto\]_ Humphrey Bogart! _\[Deliberately Monochrome and all\]_ Chevy Chase and Damon Wayans walking side by side— _\[Do we need to spell it out?\]_ What is going on?!! Why are there so many pointless random cameos?! Am I in The Twilight Zone? I mean, movie, just because you can have someone in your film doesn't mean you should! It's like having— _\[Finally shuts himself up, having learned his lesson\]_ Nope! No! If I mention that person's name, they might spontaneously jump out of somebody's anus! Let's just keep watching the movie and be done with it.
        
    -   In his review of _Scooby-Doo_, his past self argues that a satire is automatically funny, only for the screen to display posters for several of Seltzer and Friedberg's movies. This ends up backfiring as the Critic's past self is unfamiliar with them since they're made after his time period.
-   _Search for Sandvich_: Right after the Sniper declares that he's by himself in the Stanley Hotel, the Administrator chimes in.
    
    **Sniper:** Well, it looks like it's just me. On my own. One man. Alone.  
    **Administrator:** Don't die all at once.  
    **Sniper:** Well, except her of course.
    
-   _The Spiffing Brit_: Leading to some Corpsing: During his first escape attempt in _Prison Architect_, the Spiffing Brit points out that if you tried legging it the instant you left the bus, you'd get grabbed by the guards before you could escape... only to instantly escape, prompting him to break into laughter.
-   On _Steam Train_, we get this golden moment from their playthrough of _King's Quest V:_
    
    **Dan:** This is the rope we just got out of, so let's take that.
    
    **Ross:** It's actually a chain.
    
    **Narrator:** Graham bent over and picked up the sturdy rope from the stone floor.
    
    **Dan:** Or it's a rope.
    
-   _Steve Reviews_' video on _Ringing Bell_, right after Chirin has killed the wolf.
-   _Sword Art Online Abridged_: When explaining why Kayaba did everything he did after his plans were foiled, Kirito and Asuna ask why he became Heathcliff. Kayaba tells them he couldn't really just back out now after trapping them all and getting thousands killed, but he felt he had to do something to help the players, as despite his previous outburst he didn't want to hurt anyone. Kirito rebukes his over this, reminding him he killed a guy a few minutes ago for mildly sassing him. Asuna adds "And, y'know, us." Kayaba sheepishly admits he is not the picture of grace under fire and tries to victim blame the mafioso, before finally admitting he was also trying to buy time to get the feds off his back while he figured out a way out of the mess he made, but never managed to.
-   _Ultra Fast Pony_:
    -   The Cold Open of "Batshy Crazy" features Applejack planning to kill Fluttershy. When she gets caught in her plans, she tries to deny everything and gets immediately proven wrong each time.
        
        **Twilight:** And since Fluttershy is our friend, we're going to help her out of this problem, instead of just killing her.  
        **Applejack:** Well, of course, Twilight! I wouldn't dream of doing it any other way.  
        **Apple Bloom:** Hey, Applejack! I found your shotgun that you said you wanted to murder Fluttershy with, just like you specifically told me!
        
    -   Early on in "A Sombra Affair", Twilight panics that Sombra's going to kill everybody. Shining Armor claims that Sombra might _not_ kill them... only for Sombra to yell, "I'm gonna kill y'all with crystals!"
        
        **Shining:** Well, I guess I was wrong.
        
-   _Vision of Escaflowne Abridged_ _loves_ this trope.
    -   When Hitomi shows Van her _Magic: The Gathering_ card deck...
        
        **Van:** You should be careful with those. I hear the ink is spiked with hallucinogens so you trip out while you play.  
        **Hitomi:** That's just an urban legend.  
        _\[Image on the card comes to life and swirls around her.\]_  
        **Hitomi:** Oooh, shinyyy...  
        _\[Shortly later.\]_  
        **Hitomi:** Okay, but Count Chocula and his army of Jewish werewolves need to stay here.  
        **Van:** Urban legend, riiight...
        
    -   When Hitomi and Merle are sick and Van brings them medicine...
        
        **Hitomi:** Aw, he pretends to be a self-absorbed jerk, but he really does care about...  
        **Guard:** Raise the alarm! The Zaibach are invading!  
        **Van:** Oh, thank God! I was about to go insane from boredom back there!  
        **Merle:** You were saying?

    -   In "Relics of the Old Republic", as Kanan and the crew are finishing a mission, they check in with Hera on the _Ghost_, who notes that there's been no sign of the Empire. About three seconds later, an Imperial Star Destroyer pops out of hyperspace.
        
        **Hera:** Ugh, just had to say that.
        
    -   In "Stealth Strike", Ezra stuns Kanan and Rex when they come to rescue him (since both were disguised as stormtroopers), and when they wake up, he tries to tell them they were knocked out in a big fight with Imperials, but they both fought well. They seem about to buy it until Chopper plays a holo of Ezra stunning them.
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   "Barn Mates": Peridot's attempt to fix her fractured relationship with Lapis ends when she asks Lapis "What do you want me to do?" and Lapis answers "Leave." Once Peridot stoically accepts this and walks off, Steven enters a big What the Hell, Hero? speech, ending with him dramatically saying that Peridot's never coming back again. Cue Peridot screaming in holy terror as she runs toward them, away from a spaceship that's suddenly appeared from Homeworld.
        
        **Steven:** Oh. She's coming back again.
        
    -   In "Back to the Kindergarten", Peridot laments that nothing will ever grow in the Kindergarten, not even _this flower_. Subverted when it turns out she was right the first time; the flower is actually part of a corrupted Gem that tries to eat her.
    -   "Change Your Mind": At the end, the Off-Colours finally arrive on Earth. Stepping off their ship, Rhodonite proclaims "No more Diamond Authority!" ...only to see the _other_ recent arrivals at Beach City: Blue, Yellow and White Diamond (and Steven). Her reaction is "Welp, we're cracked." Fortunately, things actually aren't as bad as she might think.
    -   In the same episode, Peridot boasts about how well they repaired some ships... at which point part of one falls off.
-   _TaleSpin_: In one episode Baloo decides to go do the one thing left he wants to do: fly across the Bearmuda Trapezoid. At the end, Rebecca is assuring him that she knew he'd come back and never doubted him for a moment, right before another pilot comes in asking about the job she had listed for Baloo's replacement.
-   Many instances in _Teen Titans_ with Beast Boy, like the time he swears Mad Mod will never hypnotize him ever again and is then immediately hypnotized.
-   In the Halloween Special of _What's New, Scooby-Doo?_, Daphne suspects Velma's cousin Marcy to be behind the attacks of the Scarecrows and the Ghost of Hank Banning (mainly because she dislikes Marcy for getting too close to Fred and acting catty towards her) and asks where she was before she met the gang at the town square. Marcy explains she was working her part-time job at the mall and even shows them the security footage to prove it. Daphne doesn't believe the girl in the footage is Marcy at all, declaring it's not her before a guy outside the camera's field of vision calls out Marcy's name and the girl turns her head in response, leaving Daphne embarrassed. It turns out Daphne was right about Marcy being the culprit, albeit not for the reason she thinks. She even still believes that the girl in the security footage isn't Marcy until Velma corrects her.
-   _Work It Out Wombats!_: In "Zoom in Zadie," Mr. E thinks that no one will show up to help him. Cue Super and Malik arriving to help him.

    Real Life 

-   During the American invasion of Iraq, Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf went on television to proclaim that American troops were stalled outside of Baghdad and killing themselves by the hundreds. As he insists that there are no American tanks near Baghdad, the sound of American tanks firing as they advance up the streets can be heard in the background.
-   In this infamous SAG Awards interview, a pair of reporters ask Mayim Bialik if she's ever been approached by fans who assume that she can do calculus because she plays a nerd on _The Big Bang Theory_. After a brief moment of being taken aback, Bialik comments that she does, in fact, know how to do calculus... because she _has a doctorate in neuroscience_. Bialik famously took a long hiatus from acting to get her advanced degree. You can practically see the reporters turning red as she politely schools them. ("You may not have known that?")
-   The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have two noteworthy examples:
    -   After the bombing of Hiroshima, the Japanese cabinet was in the middle of discussing how to react, and speculating that that atomic bomb was probably the only one that the US had, when they received news that a second bomb had been dropped on Nagasaki.
    -   Tsutomu Yamaguchi was best-known as the only person confirmed to have survived _both_ atomic bombings.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  After narrowly surviving the bombing of Hiroshima while suffering serious burns, Yamaguchi returned to his hometown of _Nagasaki_ and returned to work on the morning of August 9th despite still being injured. Reportedly, he was describing the incident to his supervisor, but the supervisor dismissed Yamaguchi's story as absurd even saying that he must have only imagined that a single bomb could have destroyed Hiroshima... and moments later, the second atomic bomb was dropped and destroyed Nagasaki.
