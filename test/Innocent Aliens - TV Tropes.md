**K:** At any given time, there are approximately 15,000 aliens on the planet, most of them right here in Manhattan. And most of them are decent enough. They're just trying to earn a living.  
**J:** Cab drivers?  
**K:** Not as many as you'd think.

Not all space aliens in fiction are evil invaders who terrorize our fair planet with their high-tech war machines, and demand to be taken to our leader. Some of them are in fact quite nice. They're not looking for any trouble, and all they want is to be left alone, make a friend, return home or just get by in our strange and unfamiliar Earth culture.

The Innocent Aliens are like this. They've just arrived at our planet (though in some, rarer cases, we go to theirs, instead) and are total babes in the woods, displaying a very warped understanding of the humans' way of life. They're wide-eyed and childlike, and occasionally even need protection from hostile human beings, often trigger-happy military types who think they're up to no good and need to be exterminated for the common good.

In some kinds of stories, these aliens are used to prove that Humans Are the Real Monsters, especially if they or the rest of the interplanetary community live peaceful, enlightened lives and we humans are the ones who go around shooting things and generally being destructive. Even worse are settings where humans _are_ monsters who want to capture such aliens to study them - against their wishes, naturally.

Often the "come in peace" part of We Come in Peace — Shoot to Kill. Contrast Aliens Are Bastards. If they're played for laughs, they may also be amusing aliens as well. It's possible that there are other aliens that aren't innocents in the setting, but the trope implies a whole population of aliens who are Always Lawful Good.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Gantz_, during the first Onion Alien mission, the Onion Kid seems like this (complete with Kato trying to protect it from the other trigger-happy Gantzers). Of course, they have no choice over whether to continue killing once its father tries to get revenge. A few other aliens are non-aggressive before being attacked, making it murky who you're supposed to be rooting for.
    -   Of course, Gantz is the bastard here, for forcing humans to hunt and kill aliens.
-   In _Hetalia: Axis Powers_, there was the Roswell Incident. Tony, the alien, ends up living with America, playing video games, watching movies, and other things.
-   In the 2001 _Cyborg 009_ series, a group of these arrive during the "Little Visitors" arc. Unfortunately, they were followed by a hostile force out to subjugate the children and harness their vast Psychic Powers for evil means.
-   Astral in _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_. He had amnesia and at first did not truly know why he was in our world, but he wasn't malignant, and rebukes anyone who claims that he is supposed to be. When he eventually discovered that his true purpose was actually to destroy the Barian World, not quite the noble goal he had hoped, he rejected it, and Yuma was forced to rescue him from his godlike Knight Templar master.
-   The Catians in _Cat Planet Cuties_. Eris is only 16, but even the adult Catians are very pleasant attractive women and their main reason for establishing diplomatic relations with Earth seems to be to try out Earth foods and entertainment.
-   The 1965 Osamu Tezuka series _The Amazing 3_/_Wonder 3_ (Known as _W3_ in Japan) involves a trio of aliens (Bokko/Bonni, Ronnie, and Zero) disguised as animals (rabbit, horse, and duck).<small>◊</small> The alien group is lead by a female alien named Bokko/Captain Bunny. They decide to visit planet earth to learn about humans and life on earth. They later befriend an adult male named "Kenny Carter" (Shinichi Hoshi in the Japanese version) and go on various adventures around the world.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable_: It's not exactly clear if Mikitaka Hazekura is _actually_ an alien, but he claims to be one, and is one of the nicest people that Josuke Higashikata has ever met. He's even willing to sacrifice himself so that Josuke can get out of Super Fly.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: In _Joys of Seasons_ episode 3, Little Flower, a Plant Alien, is willing to be friends with the goats, with the only thing causing her to change her outlook on them being Wolffy telling her that the goats attempted to poison her (which isn't true). This misunderstanding is cleared up, and Little Flower is seen off from Planet Earth by the goats.
-   In the _Simple Samosa_ episode "Anda Bhatija", an fried egg alien lands in the town of Chatpata Nagar and follows Samosa around. Samosa is annoyed at first, but then realizes that the alien means no harm and decides to be friends with him, going as far as to name him "Yolky".

    Comic Books 

-   The Firstcomers in _ElfQuest_ took the forms of elves and meant to land on an Earthlike planet during a time when such spirits were respected. Due to a bit of sabotage they landed in prehistoric times surrounded by superstitious, violent cavemen, and had no idea how to deal with the planet.
-   This is a major trope that _Resident Alien_ is built on. Harry, the alien protagonist of the series, is not interested in causing any trouble; he just wants to lie low and blend in until he can someday, maybe, return home.
-   Alan Moore wrote _Skizz_ during his time at _2000 AD_, which can best be described as "_ET_ meets Crapsack World," the Crapsack World, of course, being Birmingham, England.
-   _Judge Dredd_: A small group of friendly transdimensional tourists once visited a next-door universe. Too bad they chanced to visit Deadworld, a dark dimension ruled by four necrotic bizarro-Judges who think that all life is a crime...
-   Alan Moore also had the Pogo aliens (tiny anthropomorphic cartoon animals) in _Swamp Thing_, who were looking for a planet in tune with nature. Unfortunately they landed on Earth, where one of their party, a cartoon alligator, is eaten by our alligators and the rest flee the planet after seeing how humans behave.
-   Superman arrived on Earth as a baby. It doesn't get more innocent than that. Some other kryptonians...not so much. The same with Supergirl as she and the rest of the House of El are good-hearted people despite the things that happened and what her parents did along with what happens to them as well.
-   Martian Manhunter: The Green Martians are a peaceful race of philosophers, of which the Martian Manhunter is a part. The same cannot be said for their Evil Counterpart race, the White Martians. There _is_ one exception to the White Martians in Ms. Martian, who is a genuinely Nice Girl.
-   Aliens from Saturn come to borrow sugar in this _Beetle Bailey_ strip.
-   The Klyntar/Symbiotes Spider-Man, despite some really bad first impressions in the form of Venom and Carnage, are actually caring and genuinely supportive of their hosts; the ones who became supervillains were corrupted by outside sources, usually humans who were unstable on their own.

    Fan Works 

-   _Child of the Storm_ has Clark Kent, who arrived as a toddler, and is generally noted to be one of the sweetest and most innocent members of the cast. While he's far from stupid, and often surprisingly perceptive, he also comes across as a Naïve Newcomer compared to most of the other young characters in the sequel (who by this point have Seen It All and are Shell Shocked Veterans to one extent or another).
-   Given that aliens and monsters are commonplace in the Calvinverse, Galaxoid and Nebular are outliers in their innocence.
-   In _A New World, A New Way_, the aliens in question (Pokémon) are this for the most part. Even then, the ones that attack do it out of confusion.
-   In _Equestria: Across the Multiverse_, a group of aliens called the Celestial Ponies eventually make First Contact due to Mainline Equestria's technology leap. They genuinely do come in peace and their first message is actually introducing themselves and asking to be friends. Subverted with Black Star the Light Stealer, who's one of the supervillains that has attacked their world several times and teams up with Chrysalis.
-   In _Teen Titans (2003)_ fanfic _Transition_ a disaster in Jump City is caused by a Godlike alien trying to give everyone on earth, and later the rest of the universe Enlightenment Superpowers. Unfortunately some collateral damage was unavoidable.

    Films – Live Action 

-   Jake, the Space Cat form _The Cat from Outer Space_, happened to land on earth because his ship was malfunctioning at the time.
-   Klaatu from the original _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ qualifies, especially considering he is a text book example of the first variety of We Come in Peace — Shoot to Kill. The Keanu Reeves remake one is more of a jerkass, apparently due to Executive Meddling trying to make the remake as little like the original as possible.
-   _The Man from Planet X_.
-   The title character from _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ practically embodies this trope. However, at least some of this is probably due to being young.
-   MAC, from the infamous _Mac and Me_.
-   The furry humanoid aliens from _Earth Girls Are Easy_ double as Amusing Aliens. The trio only ends up on Earth because, while leader Mac is sleeping, the other two — having not been around women of any species in quite some time — are trying to observe the sunbathing heroine Valerie from their ship and wind up knocking it off course; ultimately it crashes into her pool. She quickly realizes that they mean no harm but is Genre Savvy and takes them to her beautician coworker to get makeovers to better pass as humans while they work on repairing their ship. Between this and their Learnt English from Watching Television skills, most of the other human characters don't realize what they really are, while Mac becomes a Magical Boyfriend for Valerie.
-   The titular alien in "The Brother from Another Planet", although he is pursued by two men in black who definitely are not innocent.
-   Although not aliens in three dimensions, the characters in _The Navigator, a Mediaeval Odyssey_ are an exact isomorphism of this trope in the time dimension, where a group of 14th century black and white British villagers flee the Black Plague by digging a tunnel that leads to Technicolor 20th century New Zealand.
-   Leeloo from _The Fifth Element_, to a degree. Meaning 'until she grabs your throat/ puts a gun to your head for almost kissing her/ jumps off a building into your cab/ kicks a roomful of alien warrior ass'
-   The Thermians from _Galaxy Quest_. To the point that they don't realize "Galaxy Quest" was an Earth television show, simply because their race doesn't understand the entire concept of fiction, at all; at best they liken it to lying (and even that is an unfamiliar new discovery, learned at great cost from the race that was wiping them out).
-   _Men in Black_ features everything from 'the worst scum of the universe' to aliens that worship humans, as well as several aliens that more or less fit this trope.
    
    **Kay:** At any given time, there are approximately 15,000 aliens on the planet, most of them right here in Manhattan. And most of them are decent enough. They're just trying to earn a living.  
    **Jay:** Cab drivers.  
    **Kay:** Not as many as you'd think.
    
-   The aliens from _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_
-   _Short Circuit_: Subverted when the alien turns out to be a Ridiculously Human Robot, much to Stephanie Speck's disappointment.
-   The aliens from _District 9_ aren't exactly childlike or innocent, but they genuinely mean no harm, and in fact were in desperate need of aid when they arrived. Poor prawns.
-   Both astronaut Chuck Baker and the aliens he encounters in the subversive _Planet 51_.
-   After the _Phoenix_ makes its historic first ever warp-speed flight in _Star Trek: First Contact_, humanity sees the Vulcans, who basically just want to drop by and congratulate the funny-eared people on finally doing something really awesome. They even stick around for the next couple centuries and become fast friends of humanity; if highly snarky friends.
-   The aliens in _Cocoon_ have no desire to hurt anyone. They just want to retrieve their lost friends.
-   In _It Came from Outer Space_, the aliens just want to repair their ship and go home. They only abduct and replace people because they are terrified of being discovered.
-   _Paul_ plays with this - Paul is a definite and unironic example of this trope in plot terms, but instead of the Incorruptible Pure Pureness one would associate with it he has a pretty crude personality and enjoys smoking weed.
-   Meba from the 1956 film _Supersonic Saucer_ fits snugly into this trope. He is an affectionate, wide-eyed young alien who comes to Earth from Venus and befriends a trio of schoolchildren - trying to please his new friends when he hears them want things, but his naivety and lack of understanding on human laws/words often gets him into trouble. Despite this, he and the children later save each other from a group of human criminals - helped mostly due to Meba's alien powers.
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)_, Sonic is portrayed as an alien who fled his home planet to protect himself from people after his Super-Speed ability. Sonic is as friendly and good-natured as in the rest of the _Sonic_ franchise, and even with his bucket list including stuff like "start a bar fight" he sees this as an innocent way of living life to the fullest.
-   Lu-La, the alien who lands near Mossy Bottom in _Shaun the Sheep: Farmageddon_ is extremely naive, fun-loving and childlike. Because she's actually a child. Her parents seem to be nice as well when they show up.
-   _Independence Day: Resurgence_: The Sphere is the Big Good, being the leader of a group of aliens attemping to defeat the Harvesters. He only wants to help the Earthlings.

    Literature 

-   Ashley from the _Nursery Crime_ series is a blue-skinned, partly-translucent tridactyl from the planet Rambosia working as a cop in Reading, England. Though not quite as naive as most Innocent Aliens, he's confused by human mannerisms and even more so by our biology. One time, he needed Jack to explain to him how human mating worked.
-   Acorna from the _Acorna Series_.
-   In the Ender series:
    -   The Buggers, who didn't realize for many years that humans were individually sentient beings (rather than drones controlled by a Queen) and resolved to leave them alone after the first two invasions of Earth, but by then humanity, faced with near extinction during the second invasion, had already launched their desperate counter-attack which culminated in Ender blowing up the Bugger homeworld.
    -   The piggies. That being said, they ritually sacrificed several scientists, but they didn't know that humans follow a different life-cycle than them and wouldn't turn into sentient trees. There are bad piggies in later books, though. They end up committing outright murder by infecting a character (one of Ender's adopted sons) and letting him die, then claiming they didn't directly kill him. Naturally, the humans call bullshit on such Loophole Abuse.
-   All the aliens on Mars and Venus in the _The Space Trilogy_ are Innocent—in a technical sense as well as mostly following this trope; they are unfallen beings, in the Christian sense, Satan being local to Earth. C. S. Lewis plays with it a little in _Out of the Silent Planet_; the Hrossa, Sorns, and Pfiffltriggi have reasonably sophisticated cultures and gradually come to realize that humans can be dangerous, while the Eldila (angels, really) know almost immediately that Weston and Devine are up to no good on Mars.
-   Amy Thomson's _The Color of Distance_ plays with this using the Tendu. Tendu have no war and strive to be in harmony with each other and the environment. They hunt with an eye to local populations, and they don't murder; they also have very little in the way of technology, though they have an incredible biological-modification ability that actually allows them to clone and alter things. They have to metamorphose twice to become intelligent and they eat their own fertilized eggs and tadpoles, and treat their tinka like slaves and allow them to be killed. The human protagonist only finds this out after she's been eating fertilized eggs and narey for a while, and is absolutely horrified. But there are countless unintelligent narey and tinka, and nothing like enough resources for all to become elders. It's presented as normal to them, and Dr. Saari eventually comes to grips with it.
    -   There is also a greater subversion later in the book, when the human protagonist explains human war to an older Tendu and is deeply ashamed. The older Tendu, Naratonen, asks why humans go to war and is told that it's partially resource scarcity. Naratonen tells her about a time in which the Tendu were far too numerous, and the oldest among them designed a genocidal plague and spread it from village to village. Half of the population died before the last surviving oldest one - the others had also died of the plague - taught others the cure and let himself die. Since then they've eaten their narey and changed their ways to keep their population down.
        
        "You have wars, we have sickness. Is there a difference? Which one of us is better than the other?"
        
    -   Its sequel, _Through Alien Eyes_, in which two of the Tendu come back to Earth with Dr. Saari, plays it a little more straight. The Tendu don't understand the degree of suspicion and distrust humanity is capable of. All the same, they're not unsophisticated, and there is never a point where either of them seriously thinks of humanity as without its good points, like curiosity and adaptiveness.
-   Domingo Santos' story _The First Day of Eternity_ (published in _Analog_) features an alien species, "rollers", which respond to human colonists with curiosity and cautious friendship.
-   Thomas Jerome Newton in _The Man Who Fell to Earth_ makes his journey to our world to acqure the means to bring the rest of his people (numbering a few hundred) here before they die of thirst back home; they would then be able to blend in with humanity and become a positive influence upon it. Tragically, he gradually loses his innocence as he lives amongst humans...
-   Zenna Henderson's The People are this when they first come to Earth and almost immediately run afoul of the Soulsaving Crusader and his followers who give them A Taste of the Lash and then Burn the Witch! She initially wrote of the after-effects on the People's earth settlement a century later in "Pottage", which was used as the Film of the Book.
-   A few different species from _Animorphs_:
    -   The Hork Bajir were peaceful, none-too-bright herbivores before the Yeerks arrived. They had absolutely no concept of fighting, to the point that even a genius Seer like Dak Hamee needed several minutes to figure out what was happening when a Hork-Bajir Controller hurt him.
    -   The Pemalites were total pacifists who did not even bother trying to fight back as they were killed off by the Howlers. The Chee, a race of androids they created, are at least capable of understanding violence, but their programming makes them incapable of committing it.
    -   The Mercorans, who settled on Earth in the Cretaceous period, were also nonviolent, to the point that they committed ritual mutilation in mourning when some of them were killed the only time they were forced to fight against another sentient being.
    -   Also, the Howlers, who are, from a certain standpoint, the most innocent species that the kids meet. Unfortunately, the Howlers are a species of genetically engineered killing machines. It's just that they don't know that killing is wrong, and Crayak preserves their naivete by altering their collective memory.
    -   And the mind-reading giant frogs, the Leerans.
-   Alan Dean Foster's _Humanx Commonwealth_ has a lot of alien races, so it stands to reason that some would be peaceful. However, this is taken to an extreme with the Ulru-Ujurrians, giant ursinoids who are nevertheless utterly innocent and devoid of malice. They eat, sleep, mate, and play games. Until Flinx shows up and starts teaching them the "game of civilization", at which point they turn out to be exponentially intelligent and rapidly assimilate all knowledge that the Commonwealth and AAnn societies have to offer. However, they remain utterly nonaggressive except when they or Flinx are threatened — which is a good thing as by the end of the series their capabilities approach Reality Warper levels.
-   The Venette Convention from the _Star Trek_ novel _Brinkmanship_. The Venetans are almost completely unable to handle the shifty politics and misdirection of the major galactic powers, with their leading citizen becoming literally ill from stress when confronted with realities like espionage.
-   Leó Szilárd, the famous nuclear physicist, also wrote some short stories. In the one called "Report on 'Grand Central Terminal'", alien scientists arrive to Earth after a nuclear war wiped out all life. They completely fail to understand things like the monetary system and think that war between the members of one species is impossible. The only alien who figures it out is dismissed by his superiors.
-   Somewhat averted in _Roadside Picnic_ in the way that the alien visitors don't even take notice of the human population, and leave all manner of artifacts strewn about. What the human populace does with, and for, these artifacts, though. . .
-   In Harry Harrison's _Bill the Galactic Hero_, Bgr claims that the Chingers used to be this until attacked by humans. After that, the Chingers quickly learned to fight. In fact, they're much better at it than humans, mostly because humans are led by a bunch of incompetents.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_: Calling Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox "innocent" is a bit of a stretch, but their reasons for visiting Earth were benign (Ford is a travel writer for the titular Guide, Zaphod just stopped off to play tourist on his way somewhere else) and for the most part, so are they. The Vogons... Not so much.
-   "Cryptic" by Jack McDevitt: The director of a SETI project is a great believer in this trope, and this causes him to hide some excellent candidate signals because they imply that a war is going on out there. This is only discovered after his death.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Dukes of Hazzard_: The Visitor, in the episode "Strange Visitor to Hazzard," an episode clearly meant to mimick and play off the popularity of _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_
-   The alien, Josh Exley, in _The X-Files_ episode "The Unnatural" just wants to play baseball.
    -   We learn later in the series that the Greys _used_ to be this, but were corrupted into warmongers by the Black Oil.
-   Occasionally present on _Doctor Who_, in the form of the Doctor's (usually human) companions meeting aliens on their homeworld before they save them from other, less well-intentioned aliens.
    -   The Thals in _The Daleks_. Subverted in that the Doctor's companion, Ian, deliberately dismantles their innocence so that they can stand up to the Daleks.
    -   The nameless aliens (implied to come from Mars) from _The Ambassadors of Death_.
    -   The Doctor's Human Alien companion Nyssa.
    -   The Kinda in _Kinda_.
    -   The Doctor himself, at times, during his Fourth and Eleventh incarnations. Though the Doctor's people, the Time Lords, in general, and for that matter, the Doctor himself, has generally not displayed this trope.
        -   Eight, in the Made-for-TV Movie, in which he's got amnesia and is therefore particularly innocent. It's especially apparent in the morgue scene, in which he's almost as scared of the morgue attendant as the morgue attendant is scared of him. And he's generally strange, overly friendly, and totally harmless. Grace has to babysit him a little because of it.
    -   The Ood, who got enslaved by humanity because of it.
-   Cole, from _Tracker_. Averted with most other aliens, who are escaped prisoners. On the other hand, one reveals that she was jailed for something that isn't even a misdemeanor on Earth.
-   They're pretty much all Human Aliens, but this applies to many encounters in _Stargate SG-1_ and _Stargate Atlantis_. Usually, the natives of any given planet are perfectly harmless and need the heroes help to survive the Big Bad.
-   The pak'ma'ra from _Babylon 5_. They may be unpleasant to be around, being scavangers and carrion eaters, and they are commonly described as "lazy, greedy and obnoxious", but they are pretty much the only race in the setting who were not once involved in some shady or immoral activity or acts of unprovoked violence, and the driving force of their species is curiosity and thirst for exploration. The pak'ma'ra were among the first to join the Interstellar Alliance and the Rangers, and helped other races in times of need. Also, they reportedly have angelic singing voices.
-   In one episode of _Married... with Children_ a bunch of aliens started coming into the house and stealing Al's socks; Al was afraid of them at first, but they turned out to be pretty friendly.
-   Popular Brazilian children's character Fofão is a friendly alien who loves having fun and singing.
-   Mork from Ork is this trope personified.
-   The title alien from _My Favorite Martian_ had his spacecraft crash-land in the backyard of Earthling Tim O'Hara. He poses as Tim's "Uncle Martin" until he can affect repairs on his spacecraft.
-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_:
    -   In "The Second Soul", the N'Tal are a race of symbiotic Energy Beings who require host bodies to survive. They forge a deal with humanity allowing them to reanimate and take possession of the bodies of the recently deceased. Although Dr. Michael Alders, the Director of the Department of Alien Studies, becomes concerned that they may have an ulterior motive, it turns out that the N'Tal have been completely honest and straightforward in their dealings with Earth.
    -   In "Feasibility Study", Adrielo belongs to race with a pre-industrial society, several hundred years less technologically advanced than that of late 20th Century Earth. The Triune, who were in search of slaves, abducted a small group of them to determine whether they could survive the petrification disease which had killed every other species that they had brought to their planet. However, Adrielo's race was as susceptible to it as the others and the abductees soon died out.
    -   In "The Grell", the titular race were peaceful and primitive, which it made easy for humanity to enslave them when it was discovered that their sun was slowly going nova.
    -   In "Rule of Law", the Medusans, the indigenous population of Daedalus, are a peaceful and deeply spiritual species who only resort to violence in order to defend themselves or their eggs.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In "The Gift", Williams' goal in coming to Earth, giving humanity a Cure for Cancer, was entirely selfless and honorable.
-   Grogu a.k.a. "The Child" from _The Mandalorian_ is a curious, big-eyed baby alien of the same species as Yoda. Being an infant by the species' standards he's not malicious and the only times he acts aggressively is when his adoptive father is in danger. While he does occasionally cause problems it's the result of his curiosity or not knowing any better.
-   The _Ultra Series_ have several examples. While most of the franchise's threat comes from alien invaders trying to conquer earth, every now and then there are peaceful, non-violent alien visitors who gets stuck on Earth, either fleeing from another much deadlier alien threat, or losing their home planets and being forced to take refuge in another planet.
    -   The Pegassa Aliens from _Ultraseven_ lose their homes due to a nuclear weapons test when Pegassa City, their home, becomes too close into colliding with Earth. Most of them are reduced to space nomads, but those who crashed on earth decide to spend the rest of their days hiding in the shadows instead of genuinely threatening the human populace. In fact, a teenage Pegassa - simply named Pega - actually shows up in a later series, _Ultraman Geed_, as a reoccurring main character and one of Geed's closest friends.
    -   _Return of Ultraman_ has Alien Mates, a Space Inspector who lose his spaceship after crash-landing. Deciding to live the rest of his life as a human, Mates even adopted a human orphan as his own child.
    -   Another episode has one of two Mystellar Alien brothers, fleeing from an intergalactic war ravaging their home planet. The older of the two brothers definitely qualifies for this trope, going as far as to rescue a human child early in the episode, and then finding out Goh Hideki's true identity as Ultraman Jack, but choosing not to expose Jack in public as a favour.
    -   Guiro from _Ultraman Leo_ is a child-like alien who befriends Tohru; he won't do any harm unless if provoked, and only wants to get along with humans. Rolan (a bird-like alien from a later episode) also counts, taking the form of a woman named Hoshimura and making handcrafted toy pinwheels for children.
    -   Deban from _Ultraman Tiga_ is an alien living with a troupe of circus performers, who blends in with public due to civilians assuming his alien appearance is a mascot costume. He spends his days performing in stageshows as a clown, and is as friendly and as harmless as he sounds.
    -   Alien Laseta from _Ultraman Dyna_ are an alien species who had to migrate from their home planet due to an impending ice age. One of them lands on Earth, befriending a lonely boy and hanging out with other children as friends.
    -   Alien Kyulia from _Ultraman Cosmos_ crash-landed on Earth near a rural 300 years prior to the series, and was accepted by the villagers as one of their own. He decides to repay the earthlings by using his alien form to absorb poisonous pollen from a meadow of deadly flowers spawned by a meteorite to prevent any harm from happening to the villagers, even though the poison might eventually kill him someday, until Ultraman Cosmos arrives to purge the poison from the meteorite and save him in the process.
    -   Alien Neril from _Ultraman Max_, dubbed a "Friendly Cross-Alien", is another alien refugee from a destroyed planet, who becomes fascinated with Earth's beauty and intends to live the rest of his life as a human, until a hostile alien named Alien Godley invades forcing Neril to give up his life to save the Earth.
    -   Alien Fanton from _Ultraman Mebius_ has a peaceful relationship with earthlings, due to being harmless and liking the food on Earth, which they gladly provides their technology to assist humans in exchange for food. One of them named Guruman even shows up in _Ultraman X_ as the leader of the XIO's science division.
    -   _Ultraman Geed_ has Pega, a young Alien Pegassa who serves as Riku/Geed's best friend and is shown as a supportive and loyal friend as well as lacking the malice of most other members of his kind.
    -   Marluru in _Ultraman Trigger: New Generation Tiga_ is a friendly young Alien Metron who is part of the main cast and helps his defense team GUTS Select fight against kaiju, similarly to Pega. Also in the same series there are Special Episodes hosted by _Tiga_'s classic friendly alien, Deban.

    Music 

-   Malinda Kathleen Reese: In one video, Malinda took random suggestions from her audience about a song to create. The song wound up being an "I Want" Song from the perspective of a friendly young alien girl who wants to visit Earth, not as an invader, but as a friend looking to share her knowledge with the humans.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Starfinder_ has the skittermanders, a peaceful and naturally cooperative race of adorable fuzzballs.

    Toys 

-   _Tamagotchi_: The majority of Tamagotchi breeds are friendly, and at worst nuisances that can't do much harm. Their primary interest in Earth is to learn about it and befriend humanity, and only originally came to it in the first place to seek refuge from their intoxicated planet.

    Video Games 

-   The Mr. Saturns from _Earthbound 1994_ and _Mother 3_, while not explicitly stated to be extraterrestrial, fit this trope to a "T". Shigesato Itoi deliberately portrayed them as "symbols of innocence".
-   Elvis, the Maian from _Perfect Dark_ more or less fits this trope, as opposed to the malevolent Skedar race of aliens.
-   The Lumas from _Super Mario Galaxy_ and _Super Mario Galaxy 2_, who not only serve as allies to Mario, but also turn into either Launch Stars, planets, mushrooms, and even sacrifice themselves to stop the black hole created when Bowser's galaxy exploded.
-   The Wisps from _Sonic Colors_ also fit this trope as well, helping Sonic by allowing him to use their unique powers to free other Wisps from Eggman's grasp and they rescue Sonic from an inescapable black hole. By the time of _Sonic Forces_, they seem to have established a resident population on Sonic's world.
-   In _The Sims 2_, the aliens that abduct Sims (and impregnate males) are not known as particularly friendly. If, however, you've put aliens in your neighborhoods _and_ didn't set them as "grouchy," they will be this trope; they're just like any other Sims except green.
-   The Wraith in _Escape Velocity Nova_, mostly their youngsters. The reason they're at war with the Polaris is simply because some Wraith children out playing buzzed some Polaran border patrol ships. The Polaris thought said Wraith were attacking and killed them. The rest of the Wraith launched reprisals and things went downhill from there. In the Polaris quest-line, the "war" is ended very quickly once the player helps establish a means of actual _communication_
-   Xananab from _DK: Jungle Climber_ is a perfectly pleasant banana-shaped alien who only wants to get his stolen crystal bananas back from King K. Rool.
-   The Recon Site map in _Zombidle_ features peaceful alien citizens who just want to perform their agriculture in peace. Unfortunately for them, the Villain Protagonist is the destructive and evil Bob the Necromancer who is certainly keen on destroying their houses, setting them on fire, and killing off their ruler.
-   In _Simon the Sorcerer 5: Who'd even want contact?_ the aliens turn out to be tourists who are oblivious to the fact that their cameras have the side effect of making magical objects explode. And they intend to use a giant camera on their ship to take a picture of the entire magical world. The end credits even show scenes from the game featuring the aliens with their Black Speech translated which changes the context of the scene.

    Web Animation 

-   One _Starship Regulars_ (an Affectionate Parody of sci-fi shows, mostly Star Trek) had a Koraeg kid. Their race was devoid of vices and was in a war with The Federation. The protagonists managed to capture one of them, and while The Captain contemplated whether he should inject him with a lethal virus to wipe out their race, the less-than-perfect regulars get him drunk and laid.
    
    **Captain:** You created the ultimate biological weapon for their society! A lazy profligate boozer!
    
    **Wilson:** Don't forget gambler and whore-manger!
    
    **Tycho:** We were thoroughgoing.
    
-   _The Most Epic Story Ever Told in All of Human History_: The “poorly-drawn alien cats” from the trailer finally show up as actual aliens in “The Most Epic Sci-Fi Adventure”, and they are friendly. Even sharing their star fruits with the protagonists.

    Webcomics 

-   Downplayed in _El Goonish Shive_; Grace's wide-eyed innocence and naivete is because she was raised by a renegade super-soldier project, completely cut off from the rest of the world, and not because she's half-alien.
-   The Martians from _It's Walky!_ until an _enormous_ Genocide Backfire.
-   Most of the aliens in _Not So Distant_ are this way, though Earth is nothing more than a giant archeological site by the time they visit.
-   Discussed in _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_ by two children. One asks what the ramifications of such a species would be and the other states that if we encountered one we should run like Hell; since all intelligent lifeforms act cruel as a result of evolution, any race that appears not to is either lying or is the precious creation of a self hating evolved species. Either way, encountering one means we're about to be killed. Note that this is a rather radical misreading of evolutionary theory (altruism exists for a _reason_).
-   Aylee from _Sluggy Freelance_... in a complicated way, because part of her being innocent and clueless is not understanding why she shouldn't eat humans. Her species is also a Horde of Alien Locusts, but she's not doing any of that stuff herself.

    Web Original 

-   Land Games: The Woken.
-   _SCP Foundation_: SCP-163 is an alien lifeform extremely different from humanity biologically, though not so much mentally. It is also capable of altruism, loves to paint, and is very, very homesick.

    Western Animation 

-   Martin the Martian (not to be confused with Marvin the Martian, who is absolutely **not** an example of this trope, with two exceptions) from the _Felix the Cat (Joe Oriolo)_ cartoons. He's a very nice guy and hit it off with Felix as soon as he met him. He's always more than willing to lend Felix or Poindexter a hand when the Master Cylinder gives them trouble in outer space.
-   Dr. Zoidberg from _Futurama_, an especially pathetic example. He's incredibly friendly to others and continues to treat others such as Hermes and Bender well despite them constantly being mean to him. He's such a Nice Guy, that in the Robot Santa episode where said killer robot declares that every single being is Naughty and deserves punishment (even the Orphan Robot), he makes an exception for Zoidberg and gives him a pogo stick for Christmas.
    -   Kif Kroker, more so as the series commences due to Flanderization. He's an assistant and sidekick to Earth's prominent Miles Gloriosus, which means he's seen some seriously messed-up stuff, but in terms of his personal life he's non-violent, shy and incoherent around his crush, keeps a Secret Diary like a stereotypical teenaged girl, and ends up as essentially The Ingenue in his relationship with Good Bad Girl Amy Wong. (There's even an innocent dimension to his species' method of reproduction, which occurs through a combination of feelings of love and skin-to-skin contact and resembles nothing so much as a real-life version of a Miss Conception; in fact, when Amy kisses him he regards it as Their First Time, although it's implied that their relationship does get more physical in the human sense from there).
-   Starfire from _Teen Titans_, at least in the cartoon adaptation. The original one in the comics was older, dressed much more fanservicey, and had rape in her Backstory.
-   The aliens in the season one episode of _Totally Spies!_, aptly titled "Aliens," were a very friendly race, who only came to Earth because they received a false distress signal from the villain of the week, who then captured them and forced them to work for slave labor.
-   _Rocky and Bullwinkle_ had the two bumbling aliens Gidney and Cloyd, although while innocent, they were naïve enough to think Mr. Big had good intentions for giant metal-eating mice.
-   Now M'gann aka Miss Martian from _Young Justice_ plays a similar role. She might not be quite as innocent as she seems.
-   Mo-Ron from _Freakazoid!_\- who, as the name suggests, was not exactly the brightest star in the galaxy.
-   The Skinnies from _Roughnecks: Starship Troopers Chronicles_ are only fighting the humans because they're under the control of alien parasites. With that cleared up, they become fast friends and allies of the humans.
-   Orbie from _Katie and Orbie_, so innocent that in fact, nobody in the series seems aware of him being an alien and treat him as any normal kid (being apparently the same age as the other title character, a five-year-old girl).
-   The title character in the _Defenders of the Earth_ episode "The Starboy" is a genetically engineered alien child who has left a trail of destruction across the galaxy; those whose planets he destroyed have banded together to destroy him - by destroying Earth, where he has recently landed. However, the Defenders realise Starboy is not inherently evil and lashed out because he was afraid of being abandoned. In the end, Mandrake (disguised as Starboy's creator) helps Starboy to understand that, if he wants to gain the friendship of others, he must stop using his powers destructively and start using them to help people.
-   In the _Rupert_ episode "Rupert and the Space Pilot", Rupert Bear encounters a pair of aliens who turn out to be lost children. Rupert and the Professor succeed in getting the alien children back home.
-   _Samurai Jack_: Pretty much _any_ alien that ends up on Earth gets royally screwed over by Aku. Special mention goes to the Vadaquians, whose poor home planet was shamelessly stripped of all its water by the wretched demon. Worse, the other type of aliens are welcomed with open arms by Aku for his evil is law.
-   _The Fantastic Four (1978)_ portrayed the Impossible Man this way. The Poppupian doesn't mean any harm, but is very gullible and manipulated by a trio of criminals into helping them in their crimes. He eventually turns against the crooks after Reed Richards informs Impy that the criminals aren't really his friends and are just using him.
-   The Propulsion family from _Ready Jet Go!_, who often do silly things (i.e mowing the roof) because they think it's Earth-like behavior.
-   The eponymous protagonist of _Jack the Explorer_. "Earth is full of surprises!"
-   In contrast to his usual portrayal, Marvin the Martian of _Looney Tunes_ gets recharacterized as this in _Baby Looney Tunes_ and _Bugs Bunny Builders_, due to both shows being aimed at a younger audience.
