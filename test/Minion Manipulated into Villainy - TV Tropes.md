_"**Wow**. That guy's like a misguided henchman for a charismatic supervillain just waiting to happen."_

A minion who is extremely loyal to their dark master. Perhaps they firmly believe in their master's cause due to a past tragedy that made them see their master's point of view. Maybe they lost everything and their master aided them in their time of need. Whatever the case, their Undying Loyalty knows no bounds and they'll do whatever they can to fulfill their boss's ambitions.

But, what's this? It turns out that their boss is the one who orchestrated their Dark and Troubled Past to drive them into their master's clutches in the first place! Their boss played them!

This is a cruel tactic by Chessmasters to gain Unwitting Pawns. Whether they're the one who destroyed one's Doomed Hometown, orchestrated their ostracism from society, or took away that person's loved ones, afterwards they would appear to their victim as a kind benefactor who offered them revenge, a chance to regain what they lost, or an idea to make the world a better place, with the unknowing sap becoming their most loyal servant out of gratitude and debt.

Why the villain chooses that particular person to manipulate varies. They could possess certain skills that the villain needs. They could be the most easily manipulated person the villain found. Or, perhaps the villain just picked them at random; anyone would've sufficed and this poor schmuck just happened to have the bad luck of being chosen.

Naturally, when the servant finds out that their life was ruined and their ideals planted into them by the one person they thought they could trust, you can expect things like a Roaring Rampage of Revenge, the servant screaming You Monster!, and perhaps pulling a Heel–Face Turn to aid the heroes in defeating the villain.

Whether or not the servant's rebellion leads to The Dog Bites Back varies. Sometimes, it can lead to Redemption Equals Death. Other times, the servant manages to survive and goes off to start rebuilding their life the right way.

For cruelty, however, the servant might not even get the chance to fight back against the one who destroyed their life, experiencing a Heel–Face Door-Slam when they attempt to rebel, either by a You Have Outlived Your Usefulness once their master's secret is out, or a Villain Override: the villain destroying what independence they had left and turning them into a mindless servant to ensure their continued loyalty.

Sometimes a villain isn't even bothered by the fact that their secret has been revealed; they might even decide to reveal it themselves as part of a Break Them by Talking speech, mocking the servant's inability to figure out the truth, calling the servant a fool that they were able to easily manipulate, and just plain rubbing it in their face what they did. Whether or not this backfires on the villain varies.

This is one possible path that The Corrupter may take. Often a dark twist on Because You Were Nice to Me. Sometimes the case for a character who was Recruited from the Gutter. Compare Forced into Evil and Trapped in Villainy where a servant is not-so-subtly made to do their boss's bidding. Also compare Poison and Cure Gambit based on the method of the villain's manipulation. Contrast Brainwashed and Crazy where a villain uses more direct methods to turn a person into their servant. Reforged into a Minion has a similar situation, where a villain recruits someone who is near death, though the two can overlap if it's revealed the villain was behind the events that nearly got the servant killed. May overlap with Treacherous Advisor or Evil Mentor. If a minion chooses to remain with their master in spite of learning the truth, it leads into a case of Sunk Cost Fallacy. If the minion ends up getting killed before they discover their master's manipulations over them, then they had Died in Ignorance.

-   _Warhammer 40,000_: _Ciaphas Cain_: Inquisitor Killian convinced an order of Sisters of Battle to assist him in stealing archeotech from the Mechanicus to aid in his Well-Intentioned Extremist plan (using a device that amplifies psychic potential in people in order to use the powers of Chaos against it, difficult enough with just the one-in-a-billion psykers who're already at risk of falling to Chaos). Once Inquisitor Vail explains the situation (and how it led to a Tyranid invasion of their world), they make amends by helping to arrest him and sacrificing themselves to destroy the Tyranids.

    Live-Action TV

Considering Lothor was the one who told Blake and Hunter that Sensei was responsible, the Rangers thought they were being foolish to believe him.
-   _Supernatural_: In season 5, Lucifer convinces Nick, a man overcome with despair after his wife and child were murdered, to become his earthborn vessel.
