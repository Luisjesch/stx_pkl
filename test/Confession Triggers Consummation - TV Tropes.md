Alice and Bob haven't admitted that they love one another yet. They might be unable to just spit it out already. They might already be together, and just haven't gotten around to popping the three magic words yet. Maybe Will They or Won't They? is being milked for all its worth and it's just been a matter of sexual-tension-packed time.

Finally(!), one or both of them makes their feelings clear. It's a happy, heartwarming, romantic moment. They smile, they hug, they kiss. Good feelings all around.

Cue the sex.

Confession Causes Consummation is when the first confession of love between characters is _immediately_ followed by sex. It's not unusual for the immediate sex to be used as the couple's moment of Relationship Upgrade, as they will afterwards be treated as an Official Couple. It also doesn't have to be their first time having sex, but it is their first time confessing their feelings.

This trope is very common in visual novels/dating simulators, where the romance between the main character and the pursued love interest culminates in the love confession and the sex. It's not unusual for it to be the "grand finale", with the story ending shortly after.

Sometimes a very stressful experience inflicts a Love Epiphany that leads to the confession, in which case it may also be Sex for Solace. Characters who had a hostile relationship with one another prior to the confession-and-consummation are probably looking at a Slap-Slap-Kiss sort of romance. Last-Minute Hookup might be at play if the confession-and-consummation is a means to wrap up loose ends before the story is over.

Compare Fourth-Date Marriage, which goes beyond just sex. Compare this to Sex Equals Love, wherein the sex is the _beginning_ of romantic feelings, and Insatiable Newlyweds, wherein recently a recently married couple can't keep their hands off each other. Also not to be confused with Sex Starts, Story Stops, which is when sex between characters comes out of nowhere/for no reason/grinds the plot to a halt.
