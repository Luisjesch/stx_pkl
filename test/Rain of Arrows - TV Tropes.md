Hope you brought an umbrella so we can fight in the shade.

_"Their arrows will blot out the sun!_  
_So much the better, we shall fight in the shade."_

Bows and arrows are cool. Say what you will about Guns and Badasses going together like bread and X-treme butter, but without copious amounts of Bullet Time, you can not _see_ the bullets in flight. Guns are, by and large, an invisible (and noisy) killer. Not so with arrows; a simple twang, a blurred shaft, and a guy falls down.

Up the scale a bit. You have a firing line of armed mooks; again, you'll see the gun smoke but not the bullets. Being cooler collectively than individually, a group (or a single!) archer can cause a rain of arrows to descend upon their foes like Death from Above. Add in some Arrows on Fire for extra fiery goodness, especially if it’s nighttime and they stand out like tracers against the dark.

Massive volleys of arrows were Truth in Television, and all arrows need to arc to some degree, but the situation would determine whether or not the archers used the extreme ballistic trajectory loved by Hollywood. A high arc was necessary at extreme distance, simply to compensate for gravity. It could also be useful to deliberately lob arrows at a steep angle so they’d hit enemies who were deeper than the first rank, or perhaps hidden from line of sight by terrain such as a hill. On the other hand a high arc increases flight time, and the further the arrows travel the more energy they lose. Therefore, anti-armor archery such as that of the English during the Hundred Years War was normally reserved for relatively close range using a relatively horizontal trajectory.

Hollywood really prefers a steep arc, however, since scores of archers shooting into the air is a really cool pose, and there’s a built-in suspense/payoff structure: you watch with dread as the arrows rise up into the air, perhaps even blotting out the sun as they reach the top of the arc, and then they come hissing down everywhere at once, killing Red Shirts left and right while somehow avoiding the heroes and their Plot Armor.

By definition, the Rain of Arrows trope is mutually exclusive with No "Arc" in "Archery". Compare Macross Missile Massacre, More Dakka, Beam Spam and Flechette Storm; see Death In All Directions.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bleach_: Uryuu Ishida, after regaining his lost power, becomes capable of firing 1200 arrows at the same time via the Quincy technique "Licht Regen". His name actually does mean "rain dragon" and, when firing this bow, he lives up to that name. Episode 169 is a notable example. Unlike other examples when he uses this, every arrow is going to hit something.

-   In _Double Arts_, an entire area-saturating barrage is fired at the protagonists. They show off the results of their intense training by using their new dance moves to dodge through them completely unscathed.
-   _The Familiar of Zero_: It took an _extended_ one of these to down Saito while fighting the 70,000 Army. He survived, so said army then resorted to the same thing but with fireballs. He got better.
-   _Genesis of Aquarion_: Silvia uses her Lunatique Archery technique to destroy the Shadow Angel Titania with a Rain of Arrows in the 9th episode.
-   _Giant Robo_: A character pulls this off in the last OVA. The area goes from sand dunes to looking like a wheat field.
-   Mages in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ will occasionally fire massive salvos of magic arrows at their opponents. Often with Robo Teching.
-   In _One Piece_'s sixth movie, _Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island_, the hideous mutant flower Lily Carnation fires a hail of arrows at Luffy, turning him into a Human Pincushion.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_:
    -   Madoka does this twice with an Energy Bow. The first time, it's a single arrow that blows away the black storm clouds and reveals a beautiful blue sky. The arrow then bursts into an infinite number of arrows that transcend space and time. The second time, she instantly fires thousands of arrows at a planet sized witch, blowing up everything else in the process.
    -   She carries this tactic over into _Rebellion_, where she uses it against a Nightmare and nearly catches herself in the attack. And then a double assault with her and Homura against the Incubators, annihilating all of them.
-   A common sight in _Ravages of Time_ whenever two armies meet for battle (which is often).
-   Basara from _Samurai Deeper Kyo_ is a one-man longbowman army. Even better, he can time the rain of arrows so that it act as a defensive barrier, hitting enemies when they try to attack him up close.
-   At the beginning of _Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust_, Borgoff Markus manages to do this with a single-shot, hand-loaded crossbow. The mechanics remain a mystery.
-   In _Yes! Pretty Cure 5GoGo!_, Cure Aqua displayed the ability to produce a Rain of Arrows any time it was useful (which was less often than you'd think). Although her "bow" is a magically summoned arc of water floating in midair which produces arrows (which seem to be made of ice) from nowhere, so we can probably call this justified.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_, two known characters died in this situation, according to ancient flashbacks. One was Mizar, a dragon tamer who reincarnates as a Barian Emperor. The other is Iris, a young, recolored lookalike of Shark's sister Rio; Iris becomes a minor Barian with all the Red Shirts who also died in the assault from Vector's army.

    Comic Books 

-   Warren Ellis' historical novel _Crécy_ explains how it's done in real life. Basically, you teach all your soldiers to shoot at the same range, then everyone fires together and _something_'s bound to get hit.
-   The last issue of the short-lived _Gargoyles_ continuation featured a magical version of this.

    Fan Works 

-   _Equestria Girls: Friendship Souls_: As a _Bleach_ crossover, this is the specialty of the Quincy via their technique Licht Regen, which can let one be a one-man version of this trope. High-ranking Soldat can fire hundreds of arrows at a time. Most of the Sternritter can fire thousands. Schutzstaffel member Night Light, as a part of his schtick being he's refined the Quincy base techniques to a level unmatched by all but the _Quincy King Sombra himself_ to make up for how his "unique" abilities aren't suited for direct regular combat, can fire _millions_ of "arrows" (which are actually closer to _spears_ in size).
-   _The Night Unfurls_:
    -   During the Battle for Navarus Village, Maia and her company succeed in reclaiming the mayor's estate. This gives her archers a good position to rain arrows at the Black Dogs beneath.
    -   A squad of goblin archers pulls off this trope to ambush Kyril and his company during the Battle for Oren. However, it is not effective due to their inaccuracy, as well as their targets being under cover. As such, the goblins are dispatched from a distance rather quickly.
-   _A Thing of Vikings_: This is stated as the best tactic to use when fighting dragons if you are not interested in selling your kills as that a single well aimed arrow can cause a dragon to explode. King Harthacnut's army used this tactic during the First Battle of Berk Sound.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Kung Fu Panda_:
    -   Both featured and subverted; Chorh-Gom prison has hundreds of ballistae lining the ledges and battlements, each capable of firing _frickin' enormous, spear-like arrows_... but Tai Lung not only uses these to break open his manacles, he's able to toss them right back at the guards, then kick a volley to stab into the rocky walls, providing him with a way to ascend out of the pit. So the rain of arrows starts off as a cool motif for the good guys, only to be snatched away and showing off the bad guy's skills instead.
    -   Similarly, the rhinos send down an eye-popping hail of Arrows on Fire, only to have Tai Lung avoid these too by dodging underneath the only protection available, the wooden elevator.
-   _Kung Fu Panda 3_: In the flashback narrated by Shifu and describing Master Oogway's past with Kai, a rain of arrow is depicted as it is mentioned they fell to an ambush, implying it was what wounded Oogway.
-   Done in Ralph Bakshi's _The Lord of the Rings_, when the orcs lay siege to Helm's Deep. The hail of arrows goes on for a good twenty seconds, at least.
-   Happens in _Mulan_ when Captain Li's army is attacks by the Huns.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _300_: Does this twice. The first time is a case of ineffective Annoying Arrows. The second time is directed primarily at a single, extremely tough individual.
-   _Alexander_: The Battle of Gaugamela involves a veritable rain of Persian arrows on the advancing Macedonian phalanx.
-   _Beowulf & Grendel_: When the Geats arrive on Danish shores, a scout threatens them with a "shower of arrows" if they don't identify themselves (he ends up announcing their presence with a summoning horn).
-   _Braveheart_: Shown a few times. At the battle of Stirling, the Scottish taunt the English archers into firing their arrows. The Scots then quickly hide under their shields for protection, with mixed results.
-   _Curse of the Golden Flower_: Seen in the climatic battle, when the Emperor's guards shower Prince Jai's rebellion army with missiles.
-   _Gladiator_: The opening battle.
-   _Henry V (1944)_: Has a rather pretty one of these during the Battle of Agincourt. The 1989 version (the Branagh one) was not so pretty.
-   _Hercules (2014)_: Played for Drama and then For Laughs when Amphiaraus faces a rain of flaming arrows peacefully, eyes closed and arms spread wide, believing it to be his prophesied death. They all miss.
    
    _\[Amphiaraus cautiously opens his eyes, peers around, and shrugs\]_  
    **Amphiaraus:** ...Maybe not. _\[Charges into battle\]_
    
-   _Hero (2002)_: Happens a few times, and couples it with two kung fu masters using their skills to stop the hail of arrows from killing calligraphers. In the end, there's even a Knife Outline of the titular hero's silhouette — of course the outline was made not by the archers pinning him so much as pin-_cushioning_ him and removing his body — his death isn't shown, just the outline. At one point master Broken Sword, doing some calligraphy of his own, has his brush broken by an arrow. He then _catches an arrow and uses it as a brush._
-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_: In the Extended Version, Thranduil's Elf army attempt to rain arrows on Dain's Dwarf army, only to discover that the Dwarves have an ingenious (and visually impressive) counter-weapon.
-   _King Arthur (2004)_: Provides a bit of Truth in Television example of how this was used in its final battle. The Woad archers create confusion and chaos in the Saxon ranks whilst thinning the numbers, which the knights then exploit, retreat and after a second volley return to finish the job. Traditionally European medieval armies (especially Frankish and later English) that employed archers used them in exactly this manner: To disrupt the enemy line and sow confusion and chaos that mounted knights could exploit.
-   _Kingdom of Heaven_: Both the advancing Saracen army and the defenders of Jerusalem shower each other with arrows in the final battle.
-   _The Last Samurai_: Katsumoto's archers unleash volleys on the Imperial Japanese army before the hand-to-hand combat begins.
-   _The Lone Ranger_: How the Comanche gets the initial drop on the U.S. Calvary that is under the control of Latham Cole.
-   _The Lord of the Rings_
    -   _The Fellowship of the Ring_: The prologue sequence shows the Battle of Dagorlad, where the combined armies of the Elves and Númenóreans rain arrows down on the orcs of Mordor before Sauron himself takes to the field.
    -   _The Two Towers_: Happens during the siege of Helm's Deep. Turns out Elves are pretty good at raining arrow-y death on the Uruk-Hai. It's entirely possible the Battle of Helm's Deep would have been much less tense if Saruman hadn't sent bombs along... because while the Rohirrim only had about 300 men (most of them not soldiers), a couple dozens elves, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, they had enough bows, and probably enough arrows, to outfit _every single one of them_, and an enormous stone wall to hide behind. Legolas isn't able to pull off a literal rain, but he manages to create veritable _stream_ of arrows at times.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   _The Return of the King_: As the forces of Sauron besiege Minas Tirith, the Gondorians rain arrows down on the horde. Noted victims include the mountain trolls pushing siege towers, and the party of orcs who attempt to batter down the gates. When the Rohirrim arrive to break the siege, they go up against the Haradrim on the Pelennor Fields, who deliver arrow-y death from atop their giant Mûmakil.
-   _The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor_. Since it's being used on an undead army — who immediately get back up and shrug off the arrows — it is only dangerous to the two humans fighting with them, and they take cover.
-   _Prince Caspian_:
    -   During the night raid on Miraz's castle, the army of the Old Narnians is trapped within the courtyard, making them easy targets for the Telmarine crossbowmen stationed along the walls.
    -   The Second Battle of Beruna features Queens Susan and Trumpkin the dwarf commanding the Narnian archers, who rain missiles down on the advancing Telmarines.
-   _Red Cliff_: Zhuge Liang (The Strategist and The Chessmaster) manipulates an opposing army into firing a Rain of Arrows at a fleet of decoy ships filled with straw, in order to meet a challenge to produce 100,000 arrows for his side within three days — the arrows were used, but still good.
-   _Timeline_: This Michael Crichton movie was worth the price of admission for these words: _"Fire the Night Arrows!"_
-   _Troy_: As the Myceneans charge against the walls of Troy, Hector commands the Trojan archers - finest in the world - to rain their missiles.
-   _Throne of Blood_ (1957): The final moments of Akira Kurosawa's Jidaigeki _Macbeth_ adaptation features a Rain of Arrows directed at a single, cornered dude. Most of these arrows were allegedly "live" — fired by expert archers just inches away from Toshiro Mifune. Needless to say, he looks pretty damn terrified.
-   _Van Helsing_: The titular character has an automatic crossbow fed by a drum of bolts, using which he can shoot practically nonstop.

    Literature 

-   Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ series.
    -   In _Guards! Guards!!_ (about a dragon attack on the city of Ankh-Morpork), Captain Vimes observes that so many bounty-hungry amateur archers are manning the roofs of Ankh Morpork, the dragon "was going to think it was flying through solid wood with slots in it".
    -   The Piecemaker, a ballista used as a handweapon for a troll. It fires a bundle of arrows at once that ignite from air friction and turns into a fireball after some airtime. Minimum safe distance is considered to be one hundred meters behind the weapon, preferably with some sort of wall between. The first time Detritus used it, the entire shooting range was devastated (along with a few seagulls who happened to be on the wrong place, AKA directly above Detritus). Needless to say, any thug in Ankh-Morpork surrenders before Detritus even starts to aim.
-   S.M. Stirling's _Emberverse_ series, in which one character is trying to bring about the return of feudalism, features a group who intentionally train their militia to produce this effect. He calls it an "arrow storm", and describes the deadly effects with typical gusto and precision.
-   _A Piece in the Game of Gods_: As said in part 42, about Cassandra:
    
    If we’d been in the open, she could have rained down a couple dozen arrows at once, taking out whole groups of zombies. It was too bad that she couldn’t do that here without the risk of hitting our allies.
    
-   In _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, Zhuge Liang uses one of these to replenish his ammunition supplies in the lead up to the battle of Red Cliff. With Zhuge's ships hiding in a fog, Cao decides that its too risky to attempt boarding them and instead relies on a hail of arrows to kill anybody who happened to be on deck. Zhuge used mats and straw dummies to collect the arrows. Once he was satisfied with his haul, Zhuge sailed off, only to reuse them in his attack against Cao's army. So famous is this maneuver that the Chinese saying "孔明借箭“ came directly from this. Translated literally, it means "Kong Ming (Zhuge Liang's nickname) borrows arrows".

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   In the Battle of the Bastards, Ramsay Bolton's archers loose a volley of arrows onto the soldiers in melee on the field, Ramsay not caring if they struck the Stark men or his own soldiers.
    -   When Daenerys Targaryen attacks combined Lannister-Tarly forces on the Goldroad, her Dothraki cavalry fire from horseback into the enemy line. A volley of arrows is also loosed against her dragon... only for them to harmlessly bounce off his plated hide.
-   _House of the Dragon_: The primary tactic of the Crabfeeder's forces against the Velaryons and Daemon Targaryen in the islands of the Stepstones is to rain down arrows (including fiery when they attack Daemon on his dragon Caraxes) on them from the cliffs then take cover in caves whenever the dragons are brought in. This kind of attrition has a high cost for the Velaryon forces, until the day Daemon decides to "surrender" as a bait to make the unsuspecting Crabfeeder's forces get out of their caves, then Laenor Velaryon swoops in on his dragon Seasmoke and wipes the archers out.
-   _Into the Badlands_: Shows up a couple of times in the third season with Baron Chau's forces deploying a large automated arrow launcher. Used both with and without the "hiding from the arrows under a shield" variation.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: Just when they thought they won the battle, the Southlanders are taken by surprise by a rain of arrows launched by the Orcs hiding in the woods. As expected, some characters are hit multiple times by the arrows and die, and other are badly wounded, including a main character.
-   _MythBusters_: Constructed and fired a replica hwacha (see the description below under Real Life) to test its reputation. It stood up to it.
-   _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_: A common attack used by Trent the White Ranger is generating a salvo of laser arrows and firing them at the enemy.

    Music 

-   They Might Be Giants' "Pencil Rain" applies this to bullets, hence the name (because pencils used to have lead in them). It's a song about a battlefield.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The fourth edition makes rangers the dedicated archer and multiple-attacks-per-turn class, giving them multiple powers to help them embody this trope if they so choose as they advance in level. At _seriously_ high levels, they can get things like Hail of Arrows — usable once per encounter and automatically targeting each enemy in range.
-   _Exalted_: "Rain of Feathered Death" is a Charm allowing a character to replicate this Trope. All by themselves. Because they're just that awesome.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
-   In _Pathfinder_, there are feats one can take to ensure a rain of arrows (so long as you have the ammunition, of course).
    -   And now, a literal rain of arrows spell that causes impressive physical damage and uses arrows of the same metal as that used by the caster to cast the spell — at the cost of a relatively small area of effect for the level it becomes available at.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   The Hail of Doom arrow. When fired, it splits into between 3 and 18 arrows.
    -   High Elves can provide a Rain Of Arrows fire in two ranks, instead of just the front rank. Repeater bolt throwers can fire four large arrows at a time. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_: "Blizzard of Arrows", a gift specific to the Amazons of Diana camp of the Black Furies, allows a single character to launch one of these.

    Video Games 

-   Massed archers can be used in strategy games like _Age of Empires_, but tend to be rather fragile and only effective against enemies with relatively low hitpoints/armour.
    -   That said, some of the archer unique units in _Age of Empires II_ are among the most lethal units in the game, notably the Britons' Longbowmen (who are just as formidable as their historical counterparts listed below) and the Chinese Chu-Ko-Nu, armed with a crossbow which can rattle off three shots in quick succession.
-   In _Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood_ and _Revelations_, Ezio can get the novice Assassins to do this, called an Arrow Storm. The narrator for one official video refers to it as an airstrike, and _The Da Vinci Disappearance_ adds an achievement/trophy called "Airstrike" for killing ten or more guards in a single Arrow Storm.
-   Khita's Ultimate in _Atlas Reactor_ is called Rain of Arrows. It creates a rain of arrows between two points on the map, damaging and rooting enemies hit by it.
-   In _BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm_, this is literally the name of Shrimp’s special attack, and boy does it live up to it. The animation is nearly _ten seconds_ of arrows pelting the enemy from all sides. Thankfully, you can only use the attack once per battle.
-   Calling for one of these is the "magical" power of several bonus characters in _Castle Crashers_.
-   Similarly to the above example, _Champions Online_ has the "Torrent of Arrows" and "Storm of Arrows" attacks in the Marksman (Archery) powerset. The former involves the character shooting several arrows at the same time in a straight line, while the latter has the character shooting many more arrows at the sky but individually, one after another in rapid succession, where they promptly rain on the enemies. Bonus points if more than one archer use this ability at the same time.
-   _City of Heroes_ has this as the most powerful attack available in the Archery powerset. The game tends to work entirely in Comic Book Tropes and action tropes anyway.
-   _Dawn of War II: Retribution_ allows Imperial Inquisitor Adrastia to acquire a hand crossbow with explosive-tipped bolts (because this is 40k) and an Area of Effect power where she shoots a volley of them into the air onto a nearby group of enemies.
-   The _Disgaea_ series typically involves a rain of arrows in at least one bow skill per game. In particular, Zielregen in _Disgaea 2_ rains exploding arrows on the target(s), and Dart Trap in _Disgaea 4_ somehow creates an explosive pitfall under the target with a rain of arrows.
-   In _Dissidia Final Fantasy_ Ultimecia has the attack "Knight's Arrow", where she summons a multitude of (stylized, magical) arrowheads to shower the enemy. Depending on input, they either swarm the enemy right away, or hang in the air and aim, delaying the attack. She also uses these arrows during her EX Burst/
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   During the Battle of Ostagar in _Dragon Age: Origins_, the darkspawn charge is met with a rain of arrows that are also on fire.
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins – Awakening_ introduces an archer talent called Rain of Arrows that mimics this trope. Scattershot does it less spectacularly but more effectively.
    -   Archers in _Dragon Age II_ have a talent called _Hail of Arrows_ where they fire a bundle of arrows into the air and it comes down in a veritable storm of pointy shafts.
    -   Hail of Arrows is the Artificer's Focus Ability in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, which causes all archery abilities to be used three times at once. It lives up to this trope when combined with Leaping Shot, which causes the user to shoot multiple arrows while leaping backwards, causing a truly alarming number of hits when used while Hail of Arrows is active.
-   The Elf in _Dragon's Crown_ has a skill called Clone Strike which lets her fire a volley of arrows into the air, turning her into a one-woman version of this.
-   In _Dynasty Warriors 6_ (and possibly some of the previous ones, haven't played them all), several characters can create this effect with the 'Barrage' special attack, raining down arrows all around them. Two of the playable characters, Yue Ying and Sun Shang Xiang (AKA 'The Bow Princess'), are also capable of pulling this off with their ordinary attacks. Interestingly enough, they're generally considered to be the best characters for fighting on Chaos Mode... the Rain of Arrows is just that powerful.
    
    In the crossover series, _Warriors Orochi_, this attack becomes incredibly useful, due to effects that make projectiles stronger, the fact that she can charge the attack to fire more arrows, and a delay between when you fire and when you hit, which you can use to fire other arrow-swarm attacks.
    
    -   In the online variation "Dynasty Warriors: Online", you can get the movesets of the original characters from 5, and Huang Zhong is the appointed bow user. One of the 6th charge variations on his moveset is this very attack. The fighter using the attack will charge up, shoot upwards, and then stagger out of the way as a hail of deadly arrows rains down where they were just standing. It's strong, but even more deadly if you have an elemental attack bonus on you, causing rains of flaming, frozen, electrified, semi-magical, or forceful arrows on a person. If you are lucky, it has a good charge up time for this amazing attack.
-   _Fate/stay night_: Strangely for a supposedly bow-using class, the Archers don't actually tend to do stuff like this much (with the exception of Atlantia). Gilgamesh, on the other hand, uses historic weapons of mass destruction as arrows because he has so many of them and doesn't see a need to actually use them properly. Hence why his class is Archer.
-   The Ranger class in _Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark_ can learn an attack _called_ Rain of Arrows which strikes all units in a line four squares long.
-   In _Final Fantasy VI_, Edgar's first "tool" is a _fully automatic crossbow_, which pelts every enemy with a generous helping of arrows.
-   In _God of War III_, Kratos is able to do this after leveling up the Blades of Exile a few times.
-   One of the many hazards in _Happy Wheels_ is a crossbow that can be attached to different surfaces (much like the harpoons). It is rather odd how a middle aged cyclist can survive twenty arrows to the ass and eyes though.
-   Human archers in _Heroes of Might and Magic 5_ have an ability called "Rain of Arrows" that covers several squares instead of one at the expense of the damage per square. Only human archers, though, not undead or elven ones. Don't ask why.
-   In _Injustice: Gods Among Us_, Ares transports his opponent to a barren wasteland where they become a victim of this as part of his Limit Break.
-   _Jeanne d'Arc_: One of the cheapest Skills is the Archer ability "Salvo", an area-effect attack that showers the entire selection with random, full-power arrows. It's offset _slightly_ by the randomness of the squares that actually get hit, but use this in confined quarters, thus forcing the CPU to target only the available squares...
-   _Kingdom Rush_ series:
    -   _Kingdom Rush: Origins_ has Eridan's Hero Spell Arrow Storm, which drops a huge number of arrows onto an area to deal a great amount of damage.
    -   _Kingdom Rush: Vengeance_ has Asra's Hero Spell Toxic Rain, which is this trope crossed with Poisoned Weapons. It inflicts enemies in an area with armor-piercing poison that deals heavy damage over time.
-   The _League of Legends_ cinematic "Trials of the Poro" sees the titular Ridiculously Cute Critter caught up in a vicious battle between two tribes, culminating in a massive storm of arrows descending on the battlefield while the poor thing cowers in terror. Fortunately folk hero Braum, Heart of the Freljord is on hand to save the poro from the rain with his gigantic impenetrable shield. In the game itself Varus, the Arrow of Retribution, one of the game's two archer champions, has an ability called "Hail of Arrows" which unleashes a brief shower of magical arrows onto a small area.
-   In _The Lord of the Rings Online_ Hunters get a skill called "Rain of Arrows", which consists of shooting an inordinate number of arrows into the sky and having them fall around the target. There is also the "Rain of Thorns" counterpart which does the same thing but pinns the targets in place.
-   In _Lords of the Realm 2_, a large group of archers can do this, which can usually turn the tide of a battle, or cost you lots of men or your army if you're on the receiving end of one.
-   The Ranger in _MapleStory_ gets a skill called Arrow Rain. On the other hand, the Sniper, their crossbow-wielding counterparts, get Arrow Eruption, which is the same but with the arrows coming from BELOW.
-   A Booby Trapped cake dispenser in _Minecraft_ as seen here.
-   In _Mount & Blade_ you can get the medieval version, just get enough archers and its a good ol' rain of death. Also possible with crossbows, though you need a _lot_ more guys as these ain't of the automatic variety, but you can expect _everything_ to die if you pull it off.
-   The Hunter class in _Octopath Traveler_ has an attack explicitly named "Rain of Arrows" (which shoots 5 to 8 arrows at random targets, of which three are guaranteed to hit while the others can hit or miss), with an upgraded version called Arrowstorm (which hits _all_ targets with 5 to 8 arrows each, again with three guaranteed hits and possibly more). The default Hunter H'aanit calls "A torrent of arrows!" for the latter attack.
-   The _Of Pen and Paper_ series gives this to the Hunter class. All text is from level 1:
    -   _Knights of Pen and Paper_: Just called "Volley" here:
        
        A great volley of arrows that deals -30% more damage on a target plus four more foes.
        
    -   _Knights of Pen and Paper 2_: Called "Hail of Arrows":
        
        Deal 2 damage to up to 2 random enemies.
        
-   In _Overwatch_, Hanzo has this ability, at first it was shooting an arrow that multiplies into many and now is shooting multiple fast and powered arrows at once
-   _Persona 3_ and _Persona 4_ have this as a physical skill.
    -   There's also a variation called "Aeon Rain", which combines this with Beam Spam.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   One of Zygarde's many Signature Moves is "Thousand Arrows", which invokes this by firing several projectiles into the air that land on its opponents. It's a Ground-Type move that not only affect Flying-Types, but will also knock them to the ground.
    -   Decidueye's signature Z-Move, Sinister Arrow Raid, has Decidueye fly into the air, then smother the opponent with ghostly feather arrows plucked from its own body.
-   The Huntress in _Risk of Rain 2_ can unleash this as one of her abilities, appropriately dubbed "Arrow Rain". In addition to taking heavy damage, enemies in the area of effect get slowed, allowing the torrent of arrows to deal even more damage to them.
-   In _Rogue Galaxy_, one of Lilika's special moves, called 'Wild Thing,' resembles the Zielregen from _Disgaea_ greatly, right down to the arrows exploding when they hit the ground. The only major difference is that she doesn't shoot a dividing arrow — she just charges up her bow in midair, and then launches a rapid-fire stream of oddly-arcing arrows.
-   _Romancing SaGa_ series have this as one of abilities that bow users can learn.
-   _Runescape_ has Sagittare Bolton, who, every time he teleports around the boss chamber, yells out the page header and launches several arrows straight up, which can cause some pretty heavy damage when they come back down.
-   In the unit-to-unit Turn-Based Combat sections of _SaGa Frontier 2_, having an archery unit next to your main attacking unit unleashes a hail of arrows before either side can do anything. (And the enemy can do this to you as well.)
-   Ina from _Samurai Warriors_ has a rain of arrows attack, although it is one of the most useless (and I suppose realistic) attacks since the arrows do piddly damage and land in a completely random spread. There are also several instances of arrow raining in the dynasty warriors and samurai warriors games during cutscenes.
-   Opal (the fusion of Pearl and Amethyst) in _Steven Universe: Save the Light_ has an attack named Rain of Arrows. It causes arrows to fall on the field at a designated location for several turns, leaving the team free to use other actions while enemies in the area are continually damaged.
-   In _South Park: The Stick of Truth_ the Mongolian Horde, the boss of the Mongolian Beef quest, have the ability "Blacken the Skies" which shoots a storm of arrows at the New Kid and his buddy. If New Kid doesn't block the arrows cause massive damage and the Bleed debuff.
-   One of the spells in _Spell Swap_ summons a rain of arrows.
-   In the later stages of _Stronghold_ you usually have _so_ many archers/crossbowmen on your walls that they reach this level.
-   _Suikoden_:
    -   The series has the archery units in your army do the Rain of Arrows if you order them to attack.
    -   In _Suikoden II_, the evil Prince Luca is only killed by his own army betraying him, the heroes forming _three_ parties just for him, and multiple Rains of Arrows. _Everyone_ wanted him really, really dead.
        
        The exact sequence was Rain of Arrows (killed his bodyguards), Rain of Arrows (he laughed it off), fight with party #1 (he laughed it off), fight with party #2 (he gets angry), fight with party #3 (he gets well and truly pissed), Rain of Arrows (this time he's visibly hurt), one-on-one fight with the protagonist (gets tired), Rain of Arrows (even more visibly injured), Rain of Arrows (dead after a short speech). Holy _hell_.
        
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   _Tales of Phantasia_ had one of these, Chester's "Wild Rain" attack.
    -   _Tales of Destiny 2_'s Nanaly Fletch and _Tales of Hearts_' Hisui Hearts both have similar techniques with their bows.
    -   _Tales of the Abyss_ has Natalia L.K. Lanvaldear and her Mystic Arte, Astral Rain.
    -   In _Tales of Vesperia_, Raven has a small-scale version, Azure Heavens.
-   _Total War_: Easily done in any of the games in the series. Archers tend to come in companies of around 60-100 that rain arrows down on other companies. Their effectiveness depends on the game, how tight the enemy formation is, the distance, the relative elevation, and good the archers are in relation to the enemy unit. In some games and situations, archers are extremely effective; in others, they're considerably nerfed.
-   The Einherjar archer party members in _Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria_ all share the same Limit Break attack.
    -   This Limit Break Attack is also Llewelyn's only positive point in first _Valkyrie Profile_.
-   _World of Warcraft_: Hunters once got the Volley spell, which fired a large number of arrows at a target area, even if the character is using a gun. Volley has since been removed and replaced by Multi-Shot, which hits everyone in an area in front of the hunter.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Blade of Toshubi_, the Tiger army used this to soften up the village of Koho.
-   Brian Clevinger of _8-Bit Theater_ fame had a mini-comic on his site called Dynasty Memories, but it seems to have been taken down. It featured a strip in which the hero evaded an attack from a single arrow and declares that they have nothing to worry about, then the next panel is filled entirely with arrows. Although the main character, Lao Zhe, says "Those mofos got like a million archers!" but it's actually only one archer firing VERY fast.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: Jagganoth is able to combine Super-Speed and a magical Great Bow into shooting a massive amount of arrows into the air before making them return to Earth around him and burrowing anyone nearby in arrows. Because of aforementioned Super-Speed, Jagganoth can be well outside the area of effect before the arrows land — not that they could harm him either way.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   The hobgoblins let loose one such volley during the siege of Azure City, complete with a parody of the page quote.
        
        **Elan:** But I don't _want_ to fight in the shade!
        
    -   This also happens earlier when the group is attacked by an incredibly large bandit force.
-   _Tower of God_: Enryu's Signature Move, the Red Rain, is comprised of the creation of several thousand spears above the enemies head. The rest is just simple logic.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: The Yuyan Archers (as seen in the episode _The Blue Spirit_) normally opt for extreme precision but occasionally fire en masse- in their first attack on Aang he has to use an air dome to repel the volume of missiles aimed at him.
-   _Blue Eye Samurai_. In "A Fixed Number of Paths", Heiji Shindo claims to have 500 archers waiting in ambush should violence ensue. Turns out he's not bluffing, and Mizu and Taigen have to run for a narrow gully using a large iron tetsubin lid as a shield. Even then it's clear they'll never make it out of the gully alive until Ringo turns up for a Big Damn Heroes.
-   _The Dragon Prince_: Queen Aanya and Duren assist with this to defeat Viren's zombie army and save Xadia from being destroyed by humans
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: In "School Daze", when Yona charges the pukwudgies, they turn around and begin to shoot volleys of their quills like this to rain down on her. Only Silverstream using a wagon as a makeshift shield saves her, and afterwards the students remain pinned behind their barricade by the unrelenting rain of sharp quills.
-   _Samurai Jack_: In "Jack and the Three Blind Archers", although the titular jackal archers are only three, each is capable of rapidly firing dozens of arrows per second. The three are able to annihilate an entire army in mere minutes. Furthermore, they are all blind, and track their opponents on sound alone. Ownage commenced on that mechanical army.
-   _Teen Titans_: Speedy seemed to be a one-man Rain of Arrows during most of his guest appearances. Where he pulls all the arrows from remains a mystery...

    Real Life 

-   During The Hundred Years War, the English achieved major victories thanks to their longbowmen launching massive clouds of arrows, as in the Battle of Agincourt. This signaled the end of feudalism in France since French knights were being cut down in massive numbers. For an understanding of just how massive, consider the casualty reports from Agincourt. According to the best historical accounts currently available, the English (armed with primarily longbows) lost a minimum of 112 men, while the French knights and footmen suffered losses of approximately 6,000.
    
    This was the result of an almost obsessive focus on longbow training in England, to the point that sports like golf were at one point banned to prevent them from taking time away from archery. How obsessive? Arming the English longbowmen _exhausted the country's entire usable supply of yew._ In the 14th and 15th centuries any European ship arriving in England to trade had to pay a toll in yew bowstaves.
    
    The English at Agincourt had an army that was about five sixths archers. A kind of middle-ages Min-Maxing, with Henry V as royal Munchkin. The French, on the other hand, were the Scrub of the piece, convinced that their rules of chivalric and noble combat were the only proper way of making war. Still, despite the English being rather outnumbered, it ended up something of a Curb-Stomp Battle.
    
    -   It wasn't even the first time they'd done this, either — they'd done it at Crecy, as well, over half a century earlier, and it had been similarly effective. Hell, this tactic was at the heart of English combat doctrine for most of 400 years (the _Mary Rose_, which sank in 1545, towards the end of Henry VIII's reign and well into the Renaissance, was heavily stocked with yew staves for bows) — though the French finally started catching on after Agincourt.
    -   The French circumvented this at the battle of Patay in 1429, simply with the element of surprise. The mounted knights of the vanguard of Joan of Arc's army spotted the English archers before they entrenched in their positions, and slaughtered them to proportions similar to what the archers inflicted to French knights at Crécy and Agincourt. Then the final decisive French victory at Castillon in 1453 saw the victory of artillery against the English archers (or really against just any type of English troops unlucky enough to be under said artillery's fire).
-   The Battle of Flodden in 1513 was the last major known use of the longbow and this tactic in Britain.
-   As shown by _300_, the preferred tactic of the Persians was to sit back and rain arrows on their opponent, then send in the cavalry to finish them off. This failed spectacularly at the Battle of Marathon in 390 BC, where the Greek phalanxes, instead of slowly marching towards the Persians, ran at full speed. This so surprised the Persians that they fired their arrows in panic — and missed by a large margin. Also, no Persian cavalry; the Athenians appeared to have waited until the horsemen were sent off (after five days' standoff) before attacking.
-   The trope namer is quoted in Herodotus's _The Histories_ (and therefore Older Than Feudalism), attributed to a Spartan named Dienekes, though it may have been apocryphal.
-   A hwacha is a historical Korean weapon that launched an impressive _200 rocket-powered exploding arrows_ at the opponent. Reportedly, they were so deadly in their ability for numbers-control, that they became the first line of defense for a city or stronghold against _any_ invading army.
-   Featured at the Battle of Hastings. Several rains of arrows by the Normans at the start of the battle did very little to the English shield wall, but after an ill-disciplined charge got a number of the English killed the shield wall wasn't nearly so effective.
-   The Roman legions applied a variant with their _pila_ (specially made Roman javelins with high piercing power): right before entering in contact with the enemy army, the legionaries threw two javelins each, hitting the enemy lines with a brief but intense barrage of javelins which, upon piercing the shields of whoever managed to raise the protection, would lodge in such a way to not be removable in the heat of the battle, unbalancing the shield (assuming the enemy had not been killed when the javelin pierced it) and preventing it to be thrown back at the Romans. And as this happened right before contact, the enemy would be still in broken formation and recovering from the shock when the well-ordered Romans arrived in shortsword range...
-   The late Roman Army: the two _pila_ per soldier were replaced by either a single _verutum_ (a throwing _spear_) or _spiculum_ (like the _pilum_, only heavier) or two _lanceae_ (small javelins of more traditional design) depending on supplies and deployment, plus the normal infantry started was supplied with a dozen _plumbatae_ (darts made to pierce chainmail and kill at short distance), and was flanked by archers (both on foot and mounted) equipped with composite bows and sometimes crossbows for a more traditional Rain of Arrows.
-   For much of their history the Samurai were mostly mounted archers, and frightengly effective ones at that thanks to armor, precision, and _longbows_ (while modern reproductions are toned down, a test on a historic one revealed it slightly more powerful than its English counterpart), effectively resulting in their enemies being buried in arrows - and beating the Mongols at their own game during their attempted invasions of Japan. Use of mounted archery started to decline after said invasions due the Mongols supporting themselves with gunpowder artillery, but remained important up until the Edo period.
    -   Before the Samurai, the Yamato state that would eventually become Japan was at the receiving end of this when trying to fight the Emishi people, the coalition of tribes that occupied northern Honshu before unification, as their army, based on the Tang Dynasty model, was mostly composed of conscript spearmen and the Emishi were excellent mounted archers. The table was turned when the Yamato started fielding their own horse archers, initially from Emishi tribes that had defected to their side re-equipped with armor and bows realized with their superior technology, creating the warrior units that would eventually evolve in the Samurai.
