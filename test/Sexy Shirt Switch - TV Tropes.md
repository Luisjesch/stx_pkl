_"Maybe it's a little too early to know if this is gonna work  
But all I know is you're sure lookin' good in my shirt"_

After sex (the morning after or right after), a woman comes out of the bedroom wearing nothing but a large shirt or pajama top belonging to her male partner. Presumably, this is used as a clear indicator of an omitted sex scene because she must have removed her own clothes in order to get into his. Obviously, the trope only works if the woman is smaller than her boyfriend (or if he likes baggy clothes). It helps that this is common in real life.

In the case of a pajama shirt, you'll sometimes see the man wear the corresponding pants, not only signifying their couple status but also providing equal amounts of fanservice: her legs and his chest.

The male version, a man wearing his girlfriend's frilly robe, is much rarer but not nonexistent, and inevitably is played for comedy or embarrassment (or both). Sometimes wearing his lover's pants is used as a more direct equivalent.

A Sub-Trope of Clothing Switch, Her Boyfriend's Jacket, and Sex Dressed. For the less modest version, see Slip into Something More Comfortable.

    Advertising 

-   Done, deliberately, for a 2008 Moss Bros. UK ad for men's shirts around Valentine's Day.
-   A series of Van Heusen shirt commercials from the late 1980s emphasized this trope.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _FLCL_:
    -   Played with: Ninamori's just staying over at Naota's for perfectly innocent reasons, right? Plus, she points out he's small, so his pajamas don't actually fit her. So this cute girl is in his bedroom, in tight clothing, and starts hitting on him in a way as weird as this example of this trope.
    -   In the manga version, Haruko decides to toy with Naota's hormones by having a sleepover in Naota's room with Mamimi (dressed in a Sexy Santa Dress) and Ninamori, who employs this trope (with Tasuku's shirt) and calls the other two amateurs.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi_: In manga, when Miaka runs into Taka in the rain, Taka lets Miaka to stay in his flat. He tells her to take a hot shower immediately and lends her his shirt.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    -   The author once drew England with America's bomber jacket. Fangirls from all around gush in joy.
    -   A somewhat more subtle and platonic version occurs when Lichtenstein gives Switzerland a set of pajamas as a present, only to realize she gave him her own by mistake. He ends up keeping them anyway. The next comic shows Lichtenstein climbing into bed, wearing pajamas that are much less fancy than the ones Switzerland got and which look a little too big for her...
-   In _His and Her Circumstances_, Yukino is seen wearing Arima's school jacket over her disheveled clothes after their... very sketchy sex scene in a corner of the school library.
-   Subverted in _Ikki Tousen_ _Dragon Destiny_. Yes, in this particular scene Kaku Bunwa is naked except for her boyfriend Kakuka's shirt. Yes, it's raining so it sticks to her curvy body. And yup, they just had sex... But no, this is _not_ as fanservicy as it sounds, as it happens right when she finds Kakuka bleeding to death in the streets, after his doomed fight with Bashoku.
-   Invoked in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_. When Kaguya sleeps over at Shirogane's in chapter 219, she requests one of his shirts to sleep in before she gets in the bath (the visit was unplanned, so she didn't have a change of clothes). It's clearly an attempt to set the mood since both of them want to have Their First Time but feel too awkward to just say it out loud.
-   In _Last Exile_, when Claus and Tatiana are rescued after being stranded a couple of days, she is wearing his jumpsuit. Lavie assumes the worst and goes into a Heroic BSoD, though it's unclear if they really did anything, and Claus's completely innocent demeanor suggests they didn't.
-   Kujou from _Last Game_ stays over at Yanagi's place for the night, but only as a friend (much to Yanagi's dismay). However, she does borrow a set of his pajamas, and Yanagi's sister visits the next morning and assumes that she's intruding on a private morning.
-   Ayase from _Midori Days_ manga shows up in front of Seiji for in-universe Fanservice in an attempt to woo him. It doesn't work.
-   An odd example (but definitely played for Fanservice) is in _My-HiME_, where Mai, during her Heroic BSoD ends up in Reito's house wearing his shirt.
-   In _Mysterious Girlfriend X_, Tsubaki develops Cargo Envy for a shirt he left with Urabe, who started wearing it as pajamas.
-   _Ranma ½_: After finding Ranma and Akane alone together in a rather... secluded... spot out in the woods, Ryōga thinks that Ranma raped her when he sees her wearing Ranma's shirt with tears in her eyes. Subverted in that they never actually had sex. She burned off her shirt (long story), he gave her his shirt and they had an argument (as usual).
-   In the _Sailor Moon_ manga, we see Usagi in her own dress, but with one of Mamoru's shirts around her shoulders. It's never stated that they have slept together, but many fans see this as indicative that they did. (The fact that Usagi's _missing_ the shirt she had worn under her dress doesn't help.) And yes, _Sailor Moon Crystal_ kept that scene.
-   _Sensual Phrase_: In the anime version, after Sakuya saved Aine from catching cold due to staying in the rain for a long time and Aine attempts to leave Sakuya, she is seen wearing Sakuya's white shirt.
-   Invoked by Momo in _To Love Ru_ _Darkness_. While Yui is taking a shower in Rito's house, Momo switches the spare tracksuit Rito left for Yui with one of Rito's shirts. Like most of her attempts to make Rito less chaste, it fails. In a twist, _Yui_ takes the initiative and tries to seduce Rito.
-   In _Witchblade_, Masane Amaha plays this trope straight after a Fade Out sex scene.
-   _Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku_ has an omake page showing the male leads' reactions to their girlfriends borrowing their shirts. Hirotaka is left shivering and feeling like he's been robbed, while Tarou is unfazed and just wants it put back afterwards.

    Comic Books 

-   When Aquaman and Dolphin were an item, she started wearing his gold-scaled tunic as a mini-dress, with a belt to cinch her waist. It arguably looked better on her than it ever did on him.<small>◊</small>
-   In one _Batman_ comic, Silver St. Cloud walks around the Batcave wearing (apparently) nothing but an extremely oversized shirt, which of course had the bat emblem on it.
-   In _Circles_, after their first time having sex, Taye walks out of the bedroom wearing only one of Marty's shirts.
-   _Green Lantern_:
    -   Lampshaded when Donna Troy walks into a nude painting session between Kyle Rayner and his neighbor Allison. Allison, quickly sensing what would happen, says goodbye and leaves the apartment, but not before wearing Kyle's shirt. Donna Troy immediately uses this as part of her argument that something happened. (Nothing happened, actually, since Kyle really was an artist.)
    -   Kyle got involved with this again the first time he was dating Jen. After a round of sex, she comes over wearing his shirt (though with pants as well, unlike other examples of this) to wish him luck as he goes out on patrol. He actually asks her what's up with women wearing a boyfriend's shirt, if it's some kind of "marking territory" thing, to which she responds "something like that".
-   Atom Eve ends up wearing a shirt after some time with Invincible. Curiously enough, he was wearing his superhero costume beforehand, so it seems a lot like she created it with her powers specifically for that scene.
-   In _Jon Sable, Freelance_ #16, Maggie the Cat wakes up after spending the night with Sable, wearing nothing but her favorite choker. She puts on Jon's shirt and pokes around the house.
-   _Legion of Super-Heroes_: In Vol. 3, Dream Girl wears Star Boy's Star-Spangled Spandex.

    -   This<small>◊</small> cover with Black Cat.
    -   During the period in _The Amazing Spider-Man (Dan Slott)_ where Peter was dating Mockingbird, one issue showed him wearing the "Ask Me About My Feminist Agenda" t-shirt from #8 of her own title.
-   _Teen Titans_:
    -   One of the first indicators that Nightwing and Starfire were intimate was a scene where he was wearing pajama pants while she wore the shirt. Word of God from Marv Wolfman stated that was so they could depict Kory and Dick as having a sexual relationship and still get it past The Comics Code.
    -   Wonder Girl (Cassie) walks around in Superboy (Kon-El)'s t-shirt the morning after they first have sex.
-   Wonder Woman's _Convergence_ side story starts with her getting out of bed in the morning wearing a baggy shirt, while her boyfriend Steve Trevor wears matching pajama pants.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   The same happened in the (also Code-approved) _Uncanny X-Men_ #171 on the morning after Cyclops and Madelyne Pryor had sex for the first time.
    -   This gets a Call-Back in a flashback story in _X-Men: The Exterminated_, which ends with showing them sharing pajamas the same way again, except now sharing the bed with their newborn.

-   Invoked in _Ghostbusters II_ when Dana and baby Oscar crash at Venkman's place and Oscar suddenly needs a new diaper, and Venkman improvises with a sweatshirt:

-   Two characters in the early part of _Loose Screws_ literally switch shirts. The guy says "Wanna trade?" and the girl says "Sure".

Matt laughs, saying "Well don't tell Foggy. Let me grab something for you." He quickly disappears into his bedroom while Karen is distracted by the light from the billboard outside his apartment, emerging a moment later with one of his dress shirts. The audience then gets treated to a moment of shirtless Deborah Ann Woll as Karen pulls off her T-shirt right in front of Matt and buttons the shirt he's providing her. Given his heightened senses, it's pretty clear Matt can tell Karen is shirtless and is thinking, "Oh great, Karen's totally naked right now, isn’t she? Don't get sexual urges, Matthew..." Pouring her a glass of water, Matt and Karen then proceed to sit down on the couch and have a very intimate conversation about Matt's blindness that feels suspiciously like post-coital pillow talk.
    -   The moment gets a callback in season 3 episode 11 when Matt is changing into a new T-shirt as he and Karen hide from Dex in the church's basement. The camera angle echoes the season 1 scene, although Karen's reaction to seeing Matt shirtless is a shocked "Jesus, Matt..." at the sight of all the scars on his chest.

    -   Done in "A Human Reaction" after Aeryn and Crichton have a one night stand while escaping from IASA.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  It quickly gets subverted in that rather than being portrayed as sexy, Aeryn was a disheveled and mismatched _mess_ since she's unaccustomed to earth fashions, and intended to actually leave the house where they holed up. Crichton quickly tells her she can't go out dressed that way and has her change. Into a rather sexy sundress.
    -   Weirdly inverted in "Rhapsody In Blue", when she's wearing a pair of his _underwear_, despite the fact that they weren't even sleeping in the same room. Apparently, badass alien Action Girls find men's boxers quite comfy. When Crichton objects, Aeryn replies that the underwear is not his, they belong to someone called "Calvin Klein".

-   Spoofed in _Get Smart_. Max is assigned to guard a beauty queen. After he stashes her in his apartment, she helps herself to his pajama top.
    
    **Trish:** Shirts in one drawer and socks in another drawer, Classified Information in another drawer... I couldn't get the top drawer open though.  
    **Max:** I always keep that drawer locked.  
    **Trish:** Why, what's in it?  
    **Max:** _\[checking out her legs\]_ Pajama bottoms.
    
-   Played with on _Getting Personal_, after Milo is in a marathon sex session with Robyn's roommate, trying to get her to orgasm. At one point, she comes out wearing his shirt, looking sexy as per usual. Milo leaves the room a few seconds later, wearing boxers and the roommate's negligee.
-   When Lorelai and Luke finally start dating on _Gilmore Girls_ they decide to keep it under wraps so that their town full of nosy neighbors won't overwhelm them while they try to figure out their feelings for each other. This plan doesn't last past the morning after their first sleepover when she wanders downstairs into the (crowded) diner in Luke's shirt (having assumed that since he was asleep upstairs, it wouldn't be open).

-   In the first episode of _Haven_, Duke rescues an unconscious Audrey from the water. He removes her wet clothes so he can launder them and puts her to bed. When she wakes up, the only clothing available is a shirt of his, obviously for his perverted enjoyment. She angrily pulls a gun on him.
    -   Played straighter in season 4, when Jennifer wears one after her and Duke's Relationship Upgrade. Still slightly subverted by the fact that it's not the shirt he was wearing prior to their love scene, as would be typical.
-   Played with in an episode of _How I Met Your Mother_ when Robin buys a bikini T-shirt that really turns Ted on. At the end of the episode, he comes out of his bedroom wearing it.

    **Marshall:** Man, I hope so.

And remained in it when they got Dan to join them to hack Lucifer's wall safe.

-   _Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries_: In "Murder and the Maiden", Phryne arrives at the scene of the disturbance at the base perimeter wearing Group Captain Compton's leather flight coat and apparently nothing else.
-   _Monk_:
    -   In "Mr. Monk and the Panic Room", Monk suspects that Chloe Blackburn, widow of murdered records producer Ian Blackburn, is having an affair with someone after he notices an open bottle of wine in the dining room at her house, and Sharona points out to her that she's wearing a man's shirt.
    -   A better example is in "Mr. Monk and the Leper", when Monk is at a probate hearing for Derek Bronson on behalf of Mandy Bronson. The lawyers for Derek's nephews point out that Monk cannot be called on as totally reliable given that he only met Derek in a dimly lit bar and parking garage. Mandy's lawyers defend that Monk is the best detective in the city and his powers of deduction are legendary. The judge (who, by the way, is played by MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell) is skeptical that Monk indeed does have a good memory. He asks Monk to stand up, turn away from him, and then asks him to describe his shirt:
        
        **Adrian Monk:** Which one?  
        **Judge Lawrence Barr:** "Which one?"  
        **Adrian Monk:** The shirt you're wearing, or the shirt that your stenographer is wearing? _\[the judge looks flustered\]_ That's your shirt, too, isn't it?  
        **Judge Lawrence Barr:** Uhh...  
        **Adrian Monk:** You cut yourself shaving — there's a little drop of blood on her collar. _\[the embarrassed stenographer is looking down at her collar and sees the blood drop\]_  
        **Judge Lawrence Barr:** What are you implying?  
        **Adrian Monk:** You were having a sex affair with her on that couch. The cushions are backwards and one of her earrings fell off. So, it’s right here. Under here.  
        _\[Monk walks over to the couch, leans down, picks up an earring off the floor with his tweezers, and sets it down on the table\]_  
        **Adrian Monk:** She must have torn her blouse. I can see it sticking out of her briefcase. Your honor?

-   On _One Life to Live_, after Luna tracks her husband Max and his mistress Blair down to their Atlantic City hotel room and finds his discarded shirt (Max is taking a post-coital shower). Blair tries to play a version of this trope by claiming that Max isn't there, that she simply bought her own version of the shirt after seeing Max wear one like it, "Don't you ever wear men's shirts?", but Luna isn't fooled after getting a whiff of Max's cologne on the shirt in question.
-   Also on _Port Charles_, when a woman goes to a man's apartment for dinner and needs to change into his shirt because she's spilled something on her outfit. Sure enough, his crush shows up, ready to finally declare her feelings, only to assume that the two are either pre or post-coital.

-   In the _Sherlock_ episode "His Last Vow", Janine comes out of Sherlock's bedroom wearing one of his shirts and giving every indication that they've been regularly shagging. They haven't.

This happened again with a different shirt in some other episodes.

-   _Titans (2018)_: The pre-sex version occurs in a flashback episode showing how Hank Hall and Dawn Granger got together.

They only end up having sex after their first vigilante act together, and she's wearing the shirt again the next day as a Modesty Bedsheet.
-   Used in _White Collar_, in the Season 3 episode "Scott Free." Although viewers know that Neal and Sara were already sleeping together, nobody's complaining - especially since Neal's shirt shows off Sara's legs.

-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_: Annie and Annie go to visit Eglamore, but they're greeted by Idra wearing one of his shirts.
