_"Never let the crazy outweigh the hot."_

Bob was dating Alice. Bob broke it off. As it turns out, Alice is Not Good with Rejection... but she is good with knives.

If Alice is playing this trope, you can expect her to express her disappointment in any level from mild harassment all the way to Stalker with a Crush. She may even become his antagonist because Love Makes You Evil (and please note that this trope is not Always Female).

Oh and God help anyone Bob dates after Alice. They _will_ suffer. Sometimes Bob will be targeted as well; sometimes Alice decides leaving him unscathed will hurt more.

Alice can even be sympathetic and/or justified in her actions. For example, if Bob cheated on her and then blamed the end of the relationship on her, "psycho" is in the eye of the beholder. Bob might even exploit this trope for sympathy, dismissing her valid criticisms of their relationship as the plaints of some witch who just wants to ruin his life.

This trope applies only to situations where Alice becomes Bob's enemy **because they broke up**. We also have tropes for situations where Bob knew Alice was evil when they started dating; Alice turned out to be a psycho within the relationship; and Alice was turned into a psycho out of the blue in order to kill off the relationship.

    Advertising 

-   A Pup-Peroni commercial uses this angle as a guy is out walking his dog, only for the dog to be lured by his ex-girlfriend with a bag of Pup-Peroni dog treats. She then, while giving guy the Death Glare, unleashes the dog, causing the leash to retract and hit the guy right in the crotch.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Subverted in _Hayate the Combat Butler_, where Athena _seems_ to be one of these... It turns out Demonic Possession and being a Lonely Rich Kid really messes with one's mental stability. She seems to be better now that she's free.
-   Aizawa from _Sukisho_. More to the point, he's a psycho ex-boyfriend.
-   Yuri Kim in _Faeries' Landing_ is just about the personification of this trope, and even physically scarred the hero just to see him squirm.
-   Dante of _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_ is the sociopathic, mass-murdering ex-lover of Hohenheim.
-   A possible interpretation of Kyouko from _Skip Beat!_.
-   _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ has an interesting example where an ex of Pazu<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  dons a perfect prosthetic duplicate body of his and frames him for two murders. It goes further in that she claimed to still love him, but believed that by being inside an exact copy of his body she had his "ghost" inside of her. Then she tries to kill the real Pazu. It's not made explicitly clear whether the real Pazu won the fight.
-   While not in total control of her faculties, Queen Mirage of _HappinessCharge Pretty Cure!_ is certainly this. Turns out she was a Shrine Maiden who fell in love with Blue 300 years ago. While he returned the feelings, he felt that, as a God, he shouldn't be attached to any one person and rejected her. She didn't take it too well, especially since it seems that Dark Mirror took control of her because of it.
-   Mami Nanami from _Rent-A-Girlfriend_ really wants to make life hell for both her ex-boyfriend Kazuya and his new (rental) girlfriend Chizuru.

    Comic Books 

-   Ray Palmer and his ex-_wife_, Jean Loring, in _Identity Crisis (2004)_, where Jean comes up with a scheme to murder the loved ones of superheroes to trick Ray into taking her back. She starts with setting one of their friends _on fire_ after inducing a fatal brain aneurysm. She claims she was originally only going to _scare_ her, and only set the body on fire after she realized she was dead, but the fact that she brought a flamethrower with her at all raises questions about that plan. She gets committed to Arkham Asylum at the end. (Despite, er, not even living in the same state. Apparently, there are no other asylums in the DCU.)
-   Wally West's ex-girlfriend Frances Kane, who returns as the psychotic villain Magenta. However, her violent insanity is actually an unfortunate side effect of her powers.
-   _Scott Pilgrim_ plays the trope with both genders:
    -   The main antagonists are the League of Ramona's Evil Exes, consisting of six guys and a girl, all of whom Scott must defeat in various bizarre fight scenes in order to continue dating his Love Interest. The leader of the League, Gideon Graves, seems to take rejection badly in particular, what with his whole plot to cryogenically freeze Ramona and all his other ex-girlfriends so that he can date them at his leisure later.
    -   There are eventual fights involving Scott's ex-girlfriends Knives and Envy. For fairness's sake, apparently, both Ramona and Scott handle these fights.
-   Tony Stark broke up with Kathleen Dare because she was being too clingy. So, she shot and crippled him.
    -   When Tony is later assumed to have died from an illness she shoots herself so she can join him in the afterlife.
-   _The Incredible Hulk_: Red She-Hulk a.k.a. Betty Ross. One of the Hulk's wives finally doesn't stay dead, and this happens. It later turns out to be a case of brainwashing, though this isn't to say their relationship gets much better without it. Just less murder-y.
-   Kimura, X-23's Ax-Crazy former handler, strongly comes across as a crazy stalker ex after Laura escapes her and the Facility. She's obsessed with getting Laura back, making several notable attempts to recapture her. When she finally _does_ manage to retake her during Laura's stint on X-Force, she's actually _licking her lips_ as she takes a _chainsaw_ to Laura's arm for "being a bad girl."
-   _Transmetropolitan_: Spider's ex-wife had her head cryonically frozen with instructions not to thaw until presented with incontrovertible proof of his death. And attempted to engineer his murder so she wouldn't have long to wait.

    Fan Works 

-   In "Days of Futures Past What Does That Mean It Kinda Sounds Sexy", Naruto mentions to Superboy that his ex-girlfriend would threaten to skin the flesh from his bones whenever he forgot to do the dishes.
-   Fara Phoenix of _Star Fox_ fame is prone to becoming this whenever Fan Fiction has merged the series' two continuities, attacking either Fox or Krystal - or both.
-   _Extended Stay_ gives us Mistress's ex-boyfriend William Queen in Chapter 7. He jumps up on stage during her date with the Warden, loudly accosts her, and even threatens her boyfriend _at knife-point!_ It doesn't really help that he was an inmate at the latter's prison.
-   _Linked in Life and Love_: When Blake's ex-boyfriend Adam Taurus discovers that she's in a poly relationship with three humans, he goes _ballistic_, turning all his resources to punish her and pissing off his incredibly powerful boss in the process. Ironically, he recruits Ilia, a girl who he knows was in love with Blake, for help under the assumption that Ilia would also want to hurt Blake. Instead, it doesn't take much to talk Ilia into acting as The Mole.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Played for Laughs when Blake's team is gearing up to fight Adam, one of the most dangerous men alive, only for Ilia to show up too. On the less funny side, it's made clear that while both Adam and Ilia are competent terrorists, they are _obsessed_ with Blake. Adam wants to punish Blake for leaving, while Ilia just wants her back but is willing to do terrible things to make that happen. After Adam is killed, Ilia quickly surrenders and does her best to help, since the alternative is getting eaten by a dragon.
    
    **Yang:** Seriously? We're about to have a fight to the death with your psycho ex-boyfriend and now also your psycho ex-girlfriend?  
    **Blake:** I said it was complicated.  
    **Yang:** Sheesh, why do you even read that smut of yours if your life is like this?
    
-   _Sailor Moon Abridged_ makes the villain of The Movie into a male version of this. Tuxedo Mask's ex-boyfriend from when they were ten, to be precise.
-   _Guys Being Dudes_: Among other reasons, Arlo initially joined Team GO Rocket because he wanted to see Candela suffer and defy everything she stood for after they broke up.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Done for humor in _The Blues Brothers_ with Jake's ex-girlfriend (Carrie Fisher), whose revenge for being left at the altar involves plenty of Stuff Blowing Up and BFGs.
-   The obvious example is Alex Forrest, Glenn Close's character in _Fatal Attraction_, a lady who the protagonist cheated on his wife with, but who absolutely _refused_ to let go when all was said and done. This is the film that gave the world the term _bunny-boiler_.
-   _My Super Ex-Girlfriend_ was made on this trope. It would have done a lot better if they put some actual effort into the plot.
-   Theodora in _Oz the Great and Powerful_, with the help of her sister's deceit.

-   _Scream 4_: Jill Roberts to Trevor. Not only is Jill the Big Bad who planned a killing spree to become famous, she personally kills Trevor (after shooting him in the balls) and was going to frame him for her killing spree.

-   In _Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown_ Lucía has _not_ taken well her breakup with Ivan twenty years ago and ended up in a mental asylum. She then convinced the doctors that she was finally healed and has left the asylum with the intention of tracking Ivan down and killing him.

    Literature 

-   Tanis and Kitiara have this kind of relationship in Dragonlance, and feelings definitely linger on both sides (though in Kitiara's case, those feelings aren't much deeper than "lust and amusement"). At the start, Kit's less "psycho" than "amoral and ambitious", but she becomes insanely jealous after hearing that Tanis is traveling with his ex-girlfriend Laurana (especially after hearing how incredibly beautiful Laurana is). This jealousy causes Kit to become obsessed with Laurana to the point of relentlessly stalking the elfmaid and trying to give her a Fate Worse than Death.
-   Lanfear from _The Wheel of Time_ series. A somewhat unusual example since The Chosen One she used to date has been dead for several millennia, so her stalking's a Reincarnation Romance.
-   Senna of _Everworld_ is a Manipulative Bastard witch who is Christopher's ex-girlfriend, and is David's current girlfriend for most of the series, and his ex-girlfriend at the very end.
    -   Not really an example: while she _is_ a sociopath and also an ex-girlfriend, the only reason she dated either of them was because she's The Vamp and they seemed useful to her plans.
-   Owen in _The Extraordinaries Series_ is Nick's evil ex-boyfriend, who tries to kill the main characters, especially Seth, Nick's best friend turned boyfriend, and Nick himself, even though Owen helped Nick remember the truth about his mom and saved his life in the third book. He's complicated.
-   Raffles - Jacques Saillard in "An Old Flame".
-   Nately's whore in _Catch-22_ becomes insanely homicidal after she's told that Nately has been killed.
-   Used masterfully in _Death on the Nile_, where Jacqueline de Bellefort chooses a very unusual and effective method of revenge. Invoking this trope, everyone _expects_ her to act crazy and homicidal, which is a major plot point.
-   _Heart of Steel_ has Jim, a male example, whose reaction to the idea that Julia might be breaking up with him is murderous rage which only gets worse after he gets turned into a cyborg.
-   _The Sleeping Beauty Killer_:
    -   Casey Carter was depicted as this by the prosecution, the media and her ex-boyfriend in his memoir, with many people believing that after her fiance Hunter Raleigh broke things off, Casey went berserk and fatally shot him, then tried to cover it up by drugging herself with roofies. Casey was portrayed as unstable with a violent temper and a tendency to drink too much. However, Casey herself insists both the "psycho" and "ex-girlfriend" parts are untrue, saying that while she has a temper she would never harm anyone and that Hunter didn't break up with her. Lots of people believe she's still in denial or just trying to gain sympathy. She's actually innocent.
    -   It's revealed that Casey's cousin Angela Hart is this to Hunter and unlike Casey, she's _definitely_ a straight example. While she was open about having dated Hunter before he got involved with Casey, she downplayed it as a casual relationship that didn't last long. It turns out that Angela was actually desperately in love with Hunter, to the point she still obsessed over him even after getting a new boyfriend and grew increasingly resentful of his relationship with Casey, feeling that Casey didn't deserve him. This culminated in Angela drugging Casey at a gala in an attempt to 'prove' she wasn't worthy of Hunter; when this failed Angela snapped and killed Hunter.
-   The trope is a major part of _The Unexplored Summon://Blood-Sign_. Kyousuke knew that the goddess courting him didn't really value human life, but he also knew that she was genuinely compassionate (in her own weird god way) and determined to make the relationship work. So when she promised to never kill anybody again if he dated her, he believed her. Unfortunately, she couldn't keep that promise, and things spiralled from there. Now she goes around torturing random people to catch his attention.
-   _Dungeon Crawler Carl_: Psamathe, more often known as Samantha, is a Love Goddess who claims to be the goddess of unrequited love. Donut notes that she seems more like the goddess of crazy ex-girlfriends instead. She's constantly hitting on everyone, threatening to kill their mothers, and has many stories about her tawdry past where she had a whirlwind romance with a god or demon that ended with her screwing him over for some perceived slight. Her primary rivals are a demon harem who _think_ she slept with their king, but actually she just lets them think that because she hates them and thinks it's funny that they're jealous. Of course, she also spent untold centuries in the Nothing, which is known for driving even the gods insane, so who knows what she was like before. Oh, and she's also reduced to possessing the decapitated head of a love doll, so she's Nigh-Invulnerable but otherwise mostly powerless.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _24_. Two characters, Jack and Tony, dating the same person, Nina.
-   _Arrow_. Helena Bertinelli is described using this exact trope whenever she returns to Starling City on her Roaring Rampage of Revenge, given that she had a past relationship with Oliver Queen during his failed attempt to turn her towards a less murderous form of vigilantism. Her jealous streak towards anyone she thinks Oliver is currently in a relationship with does not help matters.
-   Lauren to Mitchell in _Being Human_. Justified since Mitchell turned her into a vampire and then dumped her to deal with her new undead status herself.
-   In one episode of _Boy Meets World_, Shawn becomes the target of _three_ of these who band together to sabotage his latest relationship because they think he is leading her on as he led them on.
-   _Cobra Kai_: Tory Nichols joins Cobra Kai in season 2. She quickly makes a bad impression on Samantha LaRusso, and then shortly thereafter finds out out that Sam is Miguel's ex-girlfriend, prompting her to start dating Miguel to spite Sam. Thing is, Miguel isn't quite over Sam at all, and he cheats on Tory with Sam at Moon's party. Tory happens to see this, and rather than do the sensible thing and confront her boyfriend, she decides to make a public spectacle at school by assaulting a teacher, hijacking the PA system, and announcing an ass beating of Sam to the whole school for Miguel to watch, and resorts to using a deadly weapon on Sam when she's losing the fight. For this, she is expelled from school and placed on probation, and Miguel breaks up with her and goes back to Sam. Not only that, but thanks to buying fully into Kreese's teachings, Tory begins to see Miguel as the enemy between him returning to Sam and him choosing to join Eagle Fang, the dojo created by Johnny from students Kreese kicked out of Cobra Kai.
-   _Cold Case_: In "Best Friends" Billie's ex is extremely jealous to see her with Rose and carried around a pistol (she isn't the killer, however).
-   Kirsty in _Coronation Street_, when suffering boyfriend Tyrone leaves her for Fizz.
-   You would think that the CW show _Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_ would be about this, but Rebecca Bunch, the main character, is actually a deconstruction of this trope: she has _legitimate_ mental problems, including anxiety and depression and as of season 3, being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and so when she ran into her ex-boyfriend Josh Chan, he reminded her of a time when she was truly happy. So she quit her job and moved across the country. However, for the first half of the season, she lied to herself, saying that she did this not because of Josh, but because she "needed a change." The theme song tells it like it is:
    
    **She's the crazy ex-girlfriend!**  
    _What? No, I'm not._  
    **She's the crazy ex-girlfriend!**  
    _That's a sexist term._  
    **She's the crazy ex-girlfriend!**  
    _Can you guys stop singing for just one second?_  
    **She's so broken inside!**  
    _The situation is a lot more nuanced than that!_
    
-   After Dexter finally cut it off with Lila in _Dexter_, she nearly killed him and his girlfriend's children.
-   And then, of course, there's the Master, the Doctor's Evil Counterpart in the original _Doctor Who_. The original seventies and eighties stories depicted him as the Doctor's Evil Former Friend, but even then there was heavy Homoerotic Foe Romance Subtext, and the twenty-first-century stories with John Simm and Michelle Gomez dropped the "sub" and made it blatantly obvious that they, in their youth, had a **very** close relationship.
-   Vera Bates of _Downton Abbey_ to the extreme. She refuses to let Mr. Bates divorce her, blackmails him for everything he owns and then pulls an I Lied and tries to ruin his reputation and those of his girlfriend Anna and the family that employs them anyway, and finally commits suicide in order to frame him for her murder. All this to a man who _went to prison in her place_ for theft beforehand.
-   Myra becomes this in the last season of _Family Matters_. After going out with Steve Urkel for several years, Steve breaks things off with her after he realizes he doesn’t have the same feelings for her like he used to, and on top of that he discovers she had secretly installed mini-cameras in has glasses to track his movements, which thoroughly creeped him out. Myra didn’t hand the rejection well, especially since shortly afterwards, Steve began going out with Laura, who she saw as her rival for Steve’s affections. Some of her actions include giving Laura her watch as a “peace offering”, and then telling the cops Laura stole it, or when Steve went off into space, she called NASA posing as his fiancée. It’s all Played for Laughs.
-   _Forever_:
    -   Henry's first wife, Nora, comes back into his life in "Social Engineering" openly declaring herself his wife (despite the apparent age gap now present) and insisting he must share his immortality, his deepest secret, with the world. She eventually tries to kill him in front of witnesses, but his new love Anne steps in front of him and is killed instead.
    -   Abe's twice-over ex-wife Maureen De La Croix has apparently tried to kill him several times, although Abe insists that in case of the Noodle Incident with the gun Maureen hadn't known it was loaded.
-   _Frasier_:
    -   Niles's ex-wife Maris probably qualifies, although more subtly: when she begs for him to come back to her, and he rejects her on the grounds that she has treated him like dirt all his life, she goes into a Tranquil Fury and proceeds to utterly screw Niles out of every cent he has with a team of amoral attornies, just for the sake of revenge (she was filthy rich already).
    -   Also Niles' _second_ ex-wife Mel, who after feeling justifiably humiliated when Niles abandoned her to run off with Daphne Moon, exacted her pound of flesh by insisting he go through the motions of marriage with her until such time as _she_ felt they should separate and divorce. Well, everyone said she was an expy of Maris...
-   For a few episodes, Blair Waldorf on _Gossip Girl_ became this to Chuck. Most people thought it was fair enough since he was giving his new girlfriend incredibly expensive watches, crediting her with making him a better man and treating her like a queen, when he'd whored Blair out to his uncle and then slept with her greatest enemy.
-   _Hand of God_: Anne is revealed to have had an affair with PJ. Afterwards, she's shown to be a very ruthless, sadistic woman, not only arranging for his wife's rape, but his murder.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_:
    -   Parodied in "The Platinum Rule": at the end, Barney assumes Wendy the Waitress is this. She is actually taking their break-up really well, but he interprets her total maturity about the matter as a facade hiding a desire to murder him — for at least two years. It’s implied that he secretly realises she saw their split as amicable but pretends she is violently obsessed with him because he’d rather construct an elaborate fantasy than face the fact she could get over him so easily.
    -   Being as the show focuses heavily on dating, a number of straight examples show up, as do a number of women who never quite become girlfriends.
    -   A fun variation comes up when Lily starts following the girl Marshall's interested in, making Lily, by all rights, the crazy ex. In the end, Marshall concludes that Lily is one of the craziest people he's known. It's the episode they get back together.
    -   Special mention should also go to Jeanette Peterson, the last girl Ted is dating before meeting the Mother. After the break-up, she trashes Ted's apartment and throws a major part of the stuff in there out of the window - on fire! (Including the red cowboy boots and Barney's Playbook.) And Ted can't even get help from the cops, because Jeanette is a cop herself, and not above abusing this to her advantage...
-   _iCarly_: Lewbert's ex-girlfriend Marta Trundel in _iFind Lewbert's Lost Love_, who turned out to be a complete psycho who Lewbert broke up with after she turned violent. When the iCarly crew invites her in an attempt to play matchmaker, she picks up immediately where she left off, up to and including giving the poor guy a haircut by force. Yikes!
-   _Knots Landing_:
    -   In Jill's case, it began while she and Gary were still a couple. In the Season Nine finale "The Perfect Crime", Jill tries to kill Valene by forcing her at gunpoint to take a bottle of sleeping pills. She survives and, after regaining consciousness in the Season Ten episode "Borderline", accuses Jill of attempting to kill her. However, Gary and pretty much everyone else (bar Pat and Frank) believe that she was only hallucinating, especially since Jill was seemingly in San Francisco that night. Gary, Mack, and Karen do not begin to suspect the truth until "Mrs. Peacock in the Library with the Lead Pipe" when they discover that Jill does not have VD in spite of the fact that she supposedly slept with David Lamb, who thought that he caught it from her. Jill, who drugged David, had used having sex with him in San Francisco as a major part of her alibi. After all of her lies were fully exposed, Jill's bound and gagged dead body is found in the boot of Gary's Jaguar in "Poor Jill" and he is charged with her murder in the following episode "Double Jeopardy". In "Guilty Until Proven Innocent", Mack, Karen, and Frank figure out that Jill had committed suicide by choking on her own vomit after tying up and gagging herself and locking herself in the boot as part of a sick, elaborate scheme to frame Gary for her murder.
    -   Danny's behaviour in this regard did not involve as much long-term planning as Jill's had done but he was no less dangerous. In the Season Twelve episode "God Will", Danny kidnaps Gary (who had recently gotten engaged to Valene) and drives him, bound and gagged in the backseat, to a nearby hill. After removing his gag, he pours alcohol down Gary's throat, having forced him to open his mouth by squeezing his broken arm (which Danny had broken with a baseball bat). His plan is to make it look as if Gary started drinking again and accidentally killed himself when he crashed the car. With Gary out of the way, Danny hoped to force Valene into resuming their marriage. Gary is badly hurt but manages to survive whereas Danny winds up dead in a pool in a vacant property in Seaview Circle by the end of the episode. Unlike Jill, however, he didn't kill himself. Neither Gary nor Valene are suspected, at least not seriously, of having killed him since they both had iron-clad alibis. Gary's is especially solid since he was crawling his way up the hill when Danny was killed.
    -   In Season Thirteen, Paige's ex-boyfriend Pierce does not handle their breakup well. He blames it on Paige's on-again/off-again lover Greg, though the true cause was his obsessive jealousy manifesting itself in his threatening behaviour towards Paige. He tries to shoot Greg in revenge but he ends up shooting Paige instead. She is temporarily paralysed when the bullet is lodged near her spine but her mobility is restored by surgery. Pierce then kidnaps Paige from the hospital and takes her to his boat. He continually refers to her as "Margaret," the name of his pregnant fiancée who drowned in a boating accident ten years earlier. She is rescued by Greg and Mack while Pierce is seemingly drowned after a struggle with the other two men. In the closing moments of the Season Thirteen finale "Little Girl Lost", he turns up alive and well when he surprises Paige with a knife in her car in the Sumner Group carpark. In the Season Fourteen premiere "Found and Lost", Paige is rescued by Alex Barth. When she visits Pierce in prison several days later, he tells her that he intended to kill her and then himself so that they could be together forever.
-   _Lucifer (2016)_: Linda's ex-husband Reese is unable to accept that they are no longer together and that Linda _will not_ take him back. He refuses to sign the divorce papers and keeps trying to win her over. All his efforts do is drive Linda further away because she's so horrified by his selfishness and the depths he's willing to go to.
-   Davina from _Material Girl_ it's revealed at the end of the series that most of her attempts to hurt Ali were in fact directed at Marco; Ali just got in the way.
-   On _My Name Is Earl_, Earl had a girlfriend of three weeks named Jessie, as of the night he had his Accidental Marriage to Joy. Jessie worked as a secretary at the bail bondsman's office Earl frequented. When Joy had an arrest warrant for failing to appear in traffic court 6 years later, Jessie puts herself through Training from Hell so she can get revenge on Joy for a) stealing Earl from her and b) knocking out her two front teeth. It doesn't work, and she gets her veneers knocked out too.
-   _NTSF:SD:SUV::_: After Sam breaks up with his girlfriend, she threatens to blow up San Diego so she can force Sam to perform several tasks and marry her. He fails miserably but decides to get in touch with her in prison.
-   Gabe of _The Office (US)_ is a psycho ex-boyfriend. He becomes one after Erin breaks up with him. He follows Andy, (whom Erin really likes) to the men's room and threatens him and follows Erin into the ladies' room and pleads for her to take him back.
-   _Once Upon a Time in Wonderland_: While transporting Alice and the Knave across the lake, Silvermist, a former lover of the Knave, drops the Knave into the water. She then goes looking for him after she hears about the Caterpillar's bounty on his head.
-   _Oz_. Unit Manager Tim McManus forms a brief liaison with prison guard Claire Howell. When he tries to break off the relationship she assaults him in his office (to the delight of watching inmates), then charges him with sexual harassment when he tries to fire her. Howell's later actions definitely cast her in the role of a villain — she assaults (and in one case murders) inmates, as well as using them for her own sexual gratification whether they want it or not.
-   Mandy from _Secret Girlfriend_, to an extreme degree.
-   _Sense8_: Joaquin is a gender-flipped example with some heavy emphasis on the psycho part. He's clearly not over Daniela leaving him, and even _breaks into Lito's_ house just so he can ask what he did wrong. Daniela helpfully reminds him it may have had something to do with _the physical abuse_. He later blackmails her into getting back together with him and still treats her badly after she agrees.
-   _Spooks_. Quinn makes the mistake of confessing he's an MI5 agent to a woman he's seeing, who causes all kinds of problems when he tries to back out of the relationship (like printing his name and address on gay prostitute advertisement cards). Fortunately, Quinn has attracted the attention of a Blonde Republican Sex Kitten from the CIA, who has no qualms about abusing her power to scare off a rival.
-   Virginia from Sunset Beach. She even tried to have her ex's current girlfriend impregnated by another guy using a _turkey-baster_! in a memorable scene.
-   Jokingly played with in one _That Mitchell and Webb Look_ sketch — Mitchell, recently an ex-boyfriend, doesn't seem particularly inclined towards this behaviour on his own, but everyone _else_ suggests he handles the break-up in ways along this trope, ranging from writing bitch with weedkiller on her lawn, over killing her pet "in a weird way" to _planting crack in her office desk_ (apparently a standard suggestion, as one of the others asks if the crack has already been mentioned when he joins the group).
    
    **James Bachman:** Have you planted the crack yet?  
    **David Mitchell:** Er, no, we were just talking about it.  
    **Bachman:** You can't rush these things.
    
-   _Torchwood_:
    -   John Hart, Jack's ex-"partner" who shows up in the second season premiere. He reappears in the finale, holding Grey, Jack's long-lost brother, hostage and tearing Cardiff apart for no apparent reason but to get Jack's attention. It turns out to be a subversion, as Grey is the one in charge and has a bomb fused to John's wrist, forcing him to obey when he'd rather be anywhere else.
    -   _Torchwood: Miracle Day_: His boyfriend Angelo's Catholic gayngst leads him to do terrible, terrible things.
-   Rose from _Two and a Half Men_ both fits and subverts this. Although becoming friends with Charlie, she does manage to drive away his love interests and refuses to give up. Plus, every main character has called her crazy at some point. She's also pretty civil in her stalking, despite it being creepy. In the ninth season premiere, it's revealed she murdered Charlie for cheating on her.
-   _The Vampire Diaries_
    -   Katherine Pierce, who was a former love interest of both Stefan and Damon Salvatore during their human lives.

Katherine appears to be obsessed with Stefan in particular and seems to be both jealous of Elena and in competition with Elena for Stefan's affections.
    -   Alaric's ex-wife, Isobel.
-   _Wellington Paranormal_: Sheena talks about her ex-boyfriend Dion a lot even before learning that he's turned her into a werewolf. Then she tells two cops she's going to murder him and goes over to his house to yell at him.
-   _The X-Files_: Fox Mulder had _two_ of these — the first one was mostly just annoying and appeared as a New Old Flame to dump him again, but the second one turned out to be working for the Government Conspiracy and having _some_ kind of weirdly ambiguous relationship with the Smoking Man.

-   In _You_, Joe describes his ex-girlfriend Candace as such to Love when Candace tells the latter that Joe has been lying to her. Joe says that Candace is a Stalker with a Crush who could not get over their relationship ending so followed him to California. In reality, _Joe_ is actually the crazy ex who has a penchant for stalking his crushes and tried to murder Candace when she broke up with him. Candace is only in California to ensure that Joe does not get the chance to harm Love the same way.
-   In _Zoey 101_, we have Chase's short-lived girlfriend, Rebecca. Admittedly, she was psycho while she and Chase were still dating; she demanded Zoey no longer have any contact with Chase, and that Chase stop being friends with Zoey. It was the reason they broke up. Rebecca, of course, took this to mean _Zoey_ was the reason they broke up, and in a later episode ends up blackmailing her into doing all sorts of embarrassing things.

-   "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend" by Miranda Lambert, of course.
-   The title character of the Dixie Chicks' "Goodbye Earl," who puts poor Wanda into intensive care after she gets fed up with his abuse and files for divorce. The girls themselves might also qualify given what they do to him in revenge for this. I wouldn't want to be those girls' next boyfriend.
-   "Psycho Ex" by Andy Prieboy.
-   Pretty much Avril Lavigne's musical persona.
-   Pink's "Please, Don't Leave Me".
-   Paramore's "(One Of Those) Crazy Girls".
-   Adele's "Hello" features a woman who won't stop calling her ex and leaving messages on his answering machine or voicemail, even though the breakup was _years_ ago, and he has learned not to answer when she calls. (Apparently, he has never heard of Call Blocking, or considered changing his phone number.)
-   In Taylor Swift's "Blank Space", the narrator admits that her exes view her as a crazy ex-girlfriend:
    
    _Got a long list of ex-lovers,  
    They’ll tell you I’m insane,  
    But I’ve got a blank space, baby  
    And I’ll write your name._
    
-   "Before He Cheats" by Carrie Underwood is written from the perspective of a psycho soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend. It's about a woman believing her man is in the process of trying to score with another woman which drives her to vandalize his car and destroy his property.
-   In Pomplamoose's "Bust Your Kneecaps", a Mafia Princess has been dumped by her boyfriend, Johnny, who's gotten cold feet after finding what her family does for a living. The song is her giving him one last chance to take her back, with the implication that the family will kill him if he doesn't.
    
    _Johnny, don't leave me  
    You said you'd love me forever  
    Honey, believe me  
    I'll have your heart on a platter  
    Might you recall  
    We've got a small family business  
    And the family won't like this  
    They'll bust your kneecaps, ooh-wop-dee-do-wop-dee-do..._
    
-   "Redneck Crazy" by Tyler Farr is about a man who drives into his ex's yard, parks his truck, and sits there drinking, throwing empty beer cans at her window.

    Music Videos 

-   The music video for Justin Timberlake's "Cry Me a River" paints the singer as this. This video goes into more detail.
-   Los Retrovisores: The video for Me olvidé de ti. The singer's ex girlfriend is turned into a giantess in her sleep. When she wakes up, she stomps around the city until she spots the band. The guys run as she gives chase, eventually cornering them in an apartment building. Once she has them cornered she knocks the building's power and destroys a window. She reaches inside, drags the lead singer out through the destroyed window, and lowers him into her mouth before she chews him up and swallows him.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Pathfinder_ has Calistria. If she notices you, _hope_ she loses interest before you do something to offend her — praying won't help because she's a _god_. The deity of lust, trickery, and revenge, revered by elves for her changeable nature, fond of wasps due to their ability to sting people without harming themselves, and noted to be not simply vengeful but outright vindictive. Mephisto considers her too unreliable to ally with.

    Theatre 

-   Medea from Greek theatre, who went completely over the edge when Jason (of Argonauts and Golden Fleece fame) dumped her for a princess named Glauce, in some myths going as far as to kill every one of her children by him. Yeah, it's Older Than Feudalism.

    Video Games 

-   Jolene to Linebeck in _The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass_.
-   Mira in _Fallout 2_ is an NCR bartender who not only took everything her husband Jack owned in the divorce but actively wants him dead seemingly for no reason, and manipulates a Dumb Muscle Player Character into doing the deed for her while Jack himself is Driven to Suicide and intends to blow himself up with the town generator.
-   _Fears to Fathom_: Cara to Noah in _Carson House_. After he broke up with her due to her refusal to stop using drugs, she bombards him with calls and texts despite him blocking her and getting into a new relationship. When she finds out where Noah is staying, she attempts to get back together with him, but quickly slides into threatening violence when he refuses and threatens to call the police. She attempts to kill him with a kitchen knife and also threatens to kill his new girlfriend Evelyn. She was heavily under the influence of meth and alcohol at the time, though it's implied she wasn't all that stable before that and the drugs just worsened her mental state.
-   _Get in the Car, Loser!_: The boss of Act II is Gaius, Kat's ex-boyfriend who is a cultist and is stalking her. Gaius also turns out to be Valentin's ex, and the former mocks the latter for changing their gender identity.
-   Catalina is one of these to Claude, the protagonist of _Grand Theft Auto III_.
    -   And also to Carl Johnson, although he never actually _wanted_ to be her boyfriend.
-   Elena to Roget in _Heroes of Mana_. In this case though, he didn't call off their engagement but he did betray their Kingdom when he found out that they were planning to take over the world with the Mirrors of Esina. Being very loyal to the Kingdom of Pedda and having found out that Roget killed her younger brother Juhani, Elena reacts as well as one would expect.
-   Adele from _Arc Rise Fantasia_ has a definite air of this about her. She was only ever a girlfriend in her own mind (and hopes) but evidently, that was enough to trigger a violent murderous storm of Yandere.

-   The _Sly Cooper_ games has Penelope, who was Bentley's girlfriend, but secretly betrayed him out of jealousy<sup>among others&nbsp;</sup>  towards his friendships with Sly and Murray despite their own kindness towards her. When Bentley finds out and breaks up with her, Penelope _attacks_ him in a Villainous Breakdown, and begins stalking him with the intent of revenge.
-   The Cruel Twist Ending of _River City Girls_ reveals that Misako and Kiyoko are actually crazy ex-girlfriends, tearing apart River City trying to find Kunio and Riki when they think they're kidnapped. There are hints throughout the game that this is the case and the superboss fight outright states it.

    Visual Novels 

-   Leo from _Echo_. During Leo's route, Leo deprives Chase from talking to the rest of the group of friends and in the bad ending he kills Kudzu and causes Chase to lose his paws. Although this last part was a consequence of the mass hysteria happening.
-   Bethany from _Melody_ kicks her fiancé (the protagonist) out of the house and hires lawyers to seize all of their shared property, and then tracks him down at his new home to get him to come back. When he refuses, she uses lies, theft, and threats in trying to get her way.

    Web Animation 

-   _Manga Soprano_:
-   _MoniRobo_:
    -   In this story, Asumi is stalked by a woman named Jozen, who urged her to divorce her husband Seichi by claiming her son Kota was his and she was pregnant with his child. When Asumi notified Seichi about it, he revealed it was his ex-girlfriend whom he dumped after graduating college. However, when she tells him said ex was a tall woman, he calls his ex named Megumi and finds out Asumi's stalker wasn't her, but her younger sister Aya, who constantly asked him out after he dumped Megumi.
    -   _My ex-girlfriend tried to get back together after I became rich_: When Kenta decided to ignore Ayahi's messages for a week, she becomes increasingly desperate and needy for his reply to the point she starts dissing him and expressing hopes that his company will go under. Much to her dismay, her boyfriend finds out her messages and dumps her, causing her to threaten suicide until Kenta finally replies and even reveals that his fiancee is famous YouTuber Ayumyon, whom Ayahi looks up to.
-   Adam Taurus in _RWBY_ is a male example. The episode "Heroes and Monsters" makes it quite clear that he didn't take it well when Blake left the White Fang, and his referring to her as "my darling" and "my love" implies that they had some sort of romantic history together, which is outright confirmed on the directors' commentary. He's now dedicated to destroying everything Blake holds dear and starts by lopping off one of Yang's arms, then ordering the murders of Blake's parents. Adam meets his end at the end of Volume 6 when he stalks and tries to kill Blake, and she and Yang stab him with the pieces of Blake's broken Gambol Shroud.

    Web Comics 

-   Possibly _MegaTokyo_'s Miho, depending on what side of the emotionally crippled goth-girl or undead fiend debate you are on.
-   Cassiel (Lucifer's niece) is Rumisiel's in _Misfile_, or at least she would be if she wasn't even more incompetent than Team Rocket.
    
    "Haha! Sub-par snacks! FEEL MY WRATH!"
    
    -   Missi is an even milder version for Ash. Missi used to talk about ignoring Ash's wishes about not dating but has settled into making sure that she's available if Ash's decision changes.
-   Gwynn from _Sluggy Freelance_ almost destroyed the world trying to get revenge on ex-boyfriend Riff.
    -   Don't forget Oasis going after any female seen speaking to Torg. Inanimate objects are not safe from her wrath if she sees them as rivals for Torg's love, either.
    -   Monica has gone far beyond Gwynn; refusing to understand that Riff broke up with her and using every Mind Screw trick to keep him too intimidated and confused to get away. Subverted in that she has a method to her madness, double-subverted in that her ulterior motive is also crazy.
-   Roxanne in _Candorville_ began as a Clingy Jealous Girl, and some of the fandom thinks she still is and we're seeing things Through the Eyes of Madness. If not, she's a vampire prophesied to rule the world, and the closest thing the strip has to a Big Bad.
-   In _Jet Dream_, Raven Red reacts to the sex change of her Dating Catwoman love interest Jack Thunder... poorly. While the newly-christened Harmony Thunder seems open to alternative possibilities, Raven isn't, and takes an If I Can't Have You… position towards Harmony.
-   _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!:_ it turns out the reason Jean fell for Nice Guy Bob so quickly is that her previous relationship had been with Fetishized Abuser Slick Simmons, and she viewed Bob as his complete opposite. Slick has since returned as an obsessed, stark raving loon — which, since he's also a brilliant scientist, is problematic.
-   Mona Montrois in _C'est la Vie_, over Louis and Tiffany. Her behaviour towards Tiffany gets more and more unhinged until she ends up sectioned in a psychiatric hospital, and is afterwards released to intensive therapy, nearly driving her shrink insane.
-   Damara Megido of _Homestuck_ is an arguable example; learning that her (then) boyfriend, Rufioh, was secretly dating Horuss on the side drove her past the Despair Event Horizon, and Meenah's needling over the matter made her snap and go completely mad. In addition to killing Meenah and rendering Rufioh quadriplegic, it's heavily implied that she killed Horuss as well. It's implied that she still has lingering feelings for Rufioh, even though he doesn't really want to date her anymore.
-   Discussed in _Questionable Content_ where Penelope expressed her dislike of the term, feeling it a cheap way of dismissing whatever actual problems the couple may have had.
    -   A downplayed example would be Angus's ex-girlfriend who we never actually meet but sounds like an unhinged Faye. Angus's flatmates threw a 'The witch is dead' party when they split up.
-   Melissa in _El Goonish Shive_, is an annoying example... except that it's been revealed that her motives are a bit more complex than that. Not to mention that she is fully aware that her attempts to win over Justin are pointless and do nothing but make her come off as annoying and quite possibly psychotic, but can't seem to stop herself.
    -   Defied with Ashley, she is fully aware that if she talked to Susan about staying away from Tom she would come across as a biased "crazy ex".
-   _Ingress Adventuring Company_: The spirit that Toivo, Aidan, and Rosemary find in Chapter 3 appears to be malevolent in a way that the other ghosts are not, indicating they did not part on good terms.
-   _The Greenhouse_: _Avery_. She's hell-bent on taking Mica back, and is not above ruining the lives of everyone else Mica loves to ensure she has her all to herself. After all, she's done it before.

    Web Original 

-   Cracked:
-   _The Questport Chronicles_: The Lord of Angels and Demons is a male example. He erases one woman's memory after she dumps him, and then destroys the only book that tells how to restore her memories.
-   Annabelle Wynters in _Under the Van Gogh_. And that's putting it nicely.

    Web Videos 

-   _Double Life SMP_: A platonic variant. Pearl goes in this direction on Day 2 after being rejected by her soulmate, Scott, and abandoned by her only friend Martyn. She changes to her Red Life skin and frightens off other people with her tendency to remotely torture Scott by using powdered snow on herself via soulmate synchronization, and proceeds to become more unhinged with each passing day from the loneliness. She calms down a bit on Day 5 once the two team up again due to an Enemy Mine scenario, and it takes until the end of the series for Pearl to finally forgive Scott, after he allows her to win the series by taking himself out.
-   Shannon in _Echo Chamber_'s Trope Of The Week series has an entire episode dedicated to her psycho ex nature. She stalks him, threatens other girls he's seen with (Dana in particular), and seems to believe they are still dating. But the kicker? She forced him to propose to her. Oh, and she regularly cheats on him. Hooray for the Double Standard. One could take the above spoiler as Tom proposes to her, but then gets cold feet and runs off. He takes Shannon back and now they have sex every so often.
-   This video in a gender-flipped example. It gets to the point where he's more or less breaking the laws of physics to get her back... and then he says that HE'S feeling smothered.

    Western Animation 

-   Several times for Robert Freeman (Granddad) in _The Boondocks_, but thankfully not for repeating characters.
-   _El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera_: The Aves women are a family of this trope, all with a Rivera man as the ex they’re insane over, fueling their vendetta towards the family.
    -   Even though they didn’t officially date in the series, Zoe loves Manny after he defeated her and would love to get his best friend Frida out of the way. She still torments him as Black Cuervo, probably because he gave her the boot so harshly after finding out she was manipulating him to hurt Frida.
    -   Zoe’s mother, Carmelita AKA Voltura dated Manny’s father, the hero White Panthera, when they were young adults. Word of God says she thought he was cheating on her, so she decided to cheat on him. Turns out, he wasn’t cheating after all, and he dumped her after that.
    -   Zoe’s grandmother and Carmelita’s mom, Lady Gobbler (civilian name unknown) was left at the altar by Manny’s grandfather, Puma Loco. The real salt in the wound is, he dumped her by running out of the church with the chief of police, Dora, on horseback, and left to marry her instead. It’s no wonder she holds a grudge.
    -   According to Word of God the reason the Big Bad Sartana of the Dead is such a monster is because Puma Loco also left _her_ at the altar. While she was pregnant. Don't ask how that works when she's a skeleton.
-   Terra for Beast Boy in _Teen Titans_. She was pretty much on the neutral side of things, agreeing to sell the Titans out (well four of the five) as a favor to Slade for helping her control her powers, but not exactly on the evil side until Beast Boy told her she had no friends, which turned her over the dark side completely until her Heel–Face Turn three episodes later.
-   Goliath and Demona of _Gargoyles_, with emphasis on the "psycho". This is a case where feelings _do_ still linger on both sides, but both characters recognize that they're now too different to ever be an item again (trying to kill each other almost every time you meet will do that to you). Doesn't stop the shippers.
-   Lady of Black Magic Tala in _Justice League_ betrayed her boyfriend Lex Luthor and started a coup in the Legion of Doom simply because he wasn't paying enough attention to her. In response he kills her by using her as a Living Battery in an attempt to resurrect Brainiac, but she sabotages the ritual by resurrecting _the God of Evil Darkseid_ instead and threatening all of existence simply to spite her ex.
-   Prof. Farnsworth and Mom in _Futurama_. Notably, her insanity was there when they were dating. He just had a change of heart and couldn't stay with a megalomaniac.
-   _The Fairly Oddparents_:
    -   Trixie Tang briefly became this to Timmy after he wished they were the only two people on earth in "Just the Two of Us!"
    -   While we're at it, Princess Mandie is considered this to Mark Chang.
-   Blackarachnia from _Transformers: Animated_ is actually this to Optimus Prime, after he and Sentinel accidentally leave her behind on a spider-infested planet. Sort of, anyway: she was actually Sentinel's girlfriend, but it's pretty obvious Optimus has a thing for her, which she returns after being mutated; she refuses to trust him, though.
-   _6teen_'s Lydia was Jonsey's ex; somehow she became a Stalker with a Crush to Wyatt. She thinks Wyatt and Jude are identical twins. That should tell you she's a little cracked. (Wyatt is black, Jude is white.) When she meets Wayne, she thinks they're identical _triplets_.
-   Dave the Barbarian's Ex, the Evil Princess Irmoplotz.
    
    **Irmoplotz:** Dating rule nº 1... NEVER BREAK UP WITH AN EVIL PRINCESS! MHWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!.
    
-   Lola on _The Looney Tunes Show_. Bugs meets her on a tennis court and after the first date, decides that she's not right for him afterwards at least partially due to her being a Stalker with a Crush on him, and Lola goes from being distraught about it to believing that she's still involved with Bugs to the point where she has Bugs (unwillingly) at the altar with her. Bugs is thankfully saved from the And Now You Must Marry Me situation she has put him in by her invocation of Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace on the grounds that she has decided that she loves Pepe le Pew. Then when Lola returned, the relationship was She Is Not My Girlfriend for a few episodes before Bugs admits she's his girlfriend, making Lola a psycho girlfriend.
-   In _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_, Star has a _demonic_ ex-boyfriend, Tom. When she and Marco ends up doing a Dance of Romance in "Blood Moon Ball", Tom starts Burning with Anger and tries to incinerate the Earthling. A storyboard for that episode showed him threatening to destroy the Earth if Star didn't go out with him. A second episode had him try to manipulate Star by getting a counselor to play on her fears, but a callout from Marco made him realize he'd gone too far. He decides to stop pursuing her after that.
