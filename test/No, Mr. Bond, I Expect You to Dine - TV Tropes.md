"Now that I have you in my clutches, prepare for your... _dinner_!"

**Dr. Evil:** Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.  
**Scott Evil:** What? Are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?

The villain has the hero at his mercy, surrounded by armed goons. Does he just shoot him? Of course not. Does he take the hero prisoner to be strapped into an improbable torture device (from which he will immediately escape)? No, that comes _later._

Instead, for a time, he treats the hero as a close friend and guest in his home, giving him a plush bedroom and a fine (if tense) dinner with A Glass of Chianti and the hero's favorite meal, made from ingredients grown in the villain's garden. If the food isn't spiked, the meal ends with a tour of the facility, then a sales pitch on the villain's scheme to remake the world Just Between You and Me. The hero will reply "You're Insane!" — and that's if he's polite. If he isn't, saying "I'm Not Hungry" dampens the festivities quite early. The hero might attempt to steal a Cutlery Escape Aid during the meal.

This differs from general Affably Evil villainy. Treating the hero as a guest is a demonstration of unassailable power, confidence and civility. It's not quite Go-Karting with Bowser, as it ratchets up the tension with the ever-present threat of unpleasantness should the hero step out of line — the conflict's not just a game. Nor is this Did We Just Have Tea with Cthulhu?, which requires the villain to be genuinely friendly rather than just faking.

With the loonier sort of antagonist, the hero is forced to play along as the villain thinks the hero is his best friend and insists they act as such.

The hero may be provided with formal dining attire: a tux for the gent and a good-looking, well-fitting dress for the lady, with a bath if needed. This may explicitly be so the villain can ogle her. It will almost certainly be so that the audience can watch her kick his butt in said dress later. If the hero's family are present, this can lead to an amusing case of Villain Over for Dinner.

The paraphrased trope namer is the _James Bond_ villain _Goldfinger_, who did later feed Bond. Also subverted the trope, as Goldfinger was initially going to simply kill Bond, before James bluffs Goldfinger into letting Bond live. These feasts are common in Bond films, which only really subverted it once. (see below)

Compare and contrast Captive Date, where one side of a romantic evening would rather not be there but isn't allowed to leave, and Enemy Eats Your Lunch, which is when one of the sides isn't keen on sharing food but the other takes it anyway.

Also compare and contrast Sacred Hospitality: The villain usually plans to torture the hero after the meal, or place him in some horrible death-trap. He is explicitly offering the hero the protection of guest-right but fully intending to violate that protection immediately thereafter. The villain thereby reveals himself to be totally without moral or ethical scruples.

The discount version of this trope is Kidnapper's KFC, when a kidnapper can only afford fast food for himself and his hostage because he's running from the cops.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _After War Gundam X_ has Imzat of the New Earth Federation treating Jamil and Tiffa to a nice dinner to discuss the old war and the place of Newtypes in the Federation's planned new world. Unsurprisingly, neither of them actually eat.
-   Sumireko of _Akuma no Riddle_ invites Haru and Tokaku to a formal dinner, which Otoya tries to crash. The fancy dining room reveals itself to be an armory and Sumireko proves to be a cyborg.
-   In episode 6 of _Crest of the Stars_, Baron Febdash appears to be a hospitable host to Lafiel and Jinto until the dinner itself, where his villainous intentions are made known.
-   In _Descendants of Darkness_, Muraki kidnaps the shinigami Hisoka, then forces Hisoka's partner Tsuzuki to have dinner with him if he wants to see his partner again.
-   In _D.Gray-Man_, Tyki invites Allen and his friends to sit down at the huge table and dine with him. Pity that none of them feel like eating, what with the whole place slowly disintegrating which would eventually lead to them dying.
-   Miaka of _Fushigi Yuugi_ falls victim to this twice. To be fair, she tries not to.
    -   During the rather light first instance, she broke into Kutou Palace with two Seishi to find the Shi Jin Ten Chi Sho and Tamahome; she is captured but manages to escape, and Yui lures her ex-best friend to her with food. Miaka tries to talk some sense into her, and the trope turns straight when Miaka sees Tamahome.
    -   The second instance is much darker. The Shinzahou had been stolen, and Miaka takes it upon herself to get it back from Nakago. When she arrives at the Seiryuu camp, she catches a delicious whiff of food and finds Nakago alone inside the tent with the item. He invites her to dinner, and things get worse after the conversation that ensues.
        
        **Nakago:** You're welcome to join me if you want.  
        **Miaka:** Don't make fun of me! Give me back the Shinzahou you stole from us!  
        _(Cut to Miaka eating dinner)_  
        **Miaka:** ... is what I'd like to say, but my stomach takes over.

-   _K_ has an interesting twist, with enemies who do end up as teammates - Kuroh follows his target, Yashiro, back to his room, intending to "fulfill \[his\] master's wishes and slay the evil king," (whose actions Shiro is framed for). After a chase scene, they realize they're hungry... and Kuroh cooks for them, and they all eat together.
-   _Kirby: Right Back at Ya!_: In the movie finale _Fright to the Finish_, King Dedede and Escargoon kidnap Tiff and try to make her tell them how to access the Warp Star, by trying to tempt her with lots of food.

-   _Mazinger Z_: In a storyline of the Gosaku Ota manga, Baron Ashura kidnaps Kouji Kabuto. Then Ashura treats him like a guest and invites him to have dinner with him to talk him into joining him (Kouji even was provided with a tuxedo). In one moment Ashura asks Kouji if the meal is to his liking and Kouji replies it would be more to his liking if he was not handcuffed. Ashura retorts he is not SO stupid to let him free.
-   In the _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_ anime, when Caren enters Gaito's castle, he invites her for dancing and partying with Noel and Coco, the kidnapped princesses she was going to rescue. It's a trap, the _real_ Noel and Coco being stuck in People Jars in his throne room, while these two are actually Mimi and Sheshe. Nice thought, though.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz_: Relena is kidnapped and then treated like a queen by Mariemeia Kushrenada and her group.
-   In _Monster_, the Nazis attempting to use Nina as bait to lure Johan to them first treat her to a nice dinner at one of the members' mansion.

-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has Fate sit down for tea with Negi, although this quickly devolves into them berating the others' taste in beverages, until Negi throws the table and sucker punches him.

-   Zigzagged in _Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World_: After a surprise encounter with Iska at a theater in a neutral nation Alice and Rin proceed to a pasta restaurant where they are seated at a table reserved by Iska. While the tension remains high, Alice and Iska make a connection based on their mutually shared preferences for pasta. They eventually part ways opting to pretend the diner never happened.
-   The anime series _Spider Riders_ has Spider Rider Hunter Steele and spider Shadow being treated quite well when taken prisoner by the series Big Bad Mantid. Though it's later revealed to have all been a deception.
-   _Umineko: When They Cry_: In the second arc's tea party, Beatrice captures Rosa and ties her to a chair before promising to grant anything for Rosa if she'll accept her existence. She then decides on her own that she knows what to grant Rosa and treats her to a lovely banquet... that is made from the remains of her siblings. She actually brags about it being made From Her Own Personal Compressor, among other things.
-   In _Until Death Do Us Part_, after Orion captures Mamoru, he tells his second-in-command to invite him to dinner. Mamoru spends the time eating up because he didn't know when he'd be able to eat next.

    Comic Books 

-   _Alan Ford_ notably spoofs this trope in the volume _Rich Mission_: the Villainous Glutton Mr Trip has just captured Alan and Count Oliver and invites them to join him in his private pool where he offers them a large plate full of pastries. Being perpetually broke and hungry, the two wolf down everything in seconds, much to Trip's dismay.
    
    _"Mumble... I see that the local air helps you build up quite an appetite."_
    
-   In _Athena Voltaire and the Immortal Power_, Major Klimt has dinner with a captured Athena and colleagues aboard her airship.
    
    **Athena:** Why the fancy dinner _now?_  
    **Klimt:** We are nearing our destination. Perhaps I merely want to gloat. Or persuade Herr Lang to cooperate again. Or perhaps I just wanted a little "girl talk", as you Americans say.  
    **Athena:** _\[Sarcastically\]_ Terrific. We can braid each other's hair later.
    
-   Pictured above is a scene from issue #87 (1969) of _Fantastic Four (1961)_ in which Crystal and Sue are trying to escape Doom's castle, only to run right into the dictator's personal dining room. Despite the fact that he was trying to kill them before, he now treats them as honored guests. Even Evil Has Standards, especially when it comes to getting three square meals, apparently.
-   In one issue of _Uncanny X-Men_, a decade and a half later, an at-that-point deposed Doom has a run in with the X-Men. He asks Storm to have dinner with him. She agrees, as it's a distraction, something Doom _knows_ (and is in fact checking on the other X-Men via screens at his end of the table), but both of them are actually enjoying the charade so much they almost don't want to end it.
-   In _Ultimate Spider-Man_, when Spider-Man swings by the Kingpin's building for no reason while contemplating his life, Elektra shows up and invites him in... where Kingpin offers him pizza and a partnership.

    Fan Works 

-   In _The Gods Awaken_, Nyarlathotep arranges to have one of his servants make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for Eda, Lilith, and King whilst they wait for Luz and Amity to return with the Necronomicon.
-   _A Growing Affection_ has the Blood Drinker Demon, Doraku, sits down for a nice meal with Naruto, Hinata, Sakura, and Lee, before he makes them his slaves. He even invites them to try and escape.
-   _Last Child of Krypton_: Lampshaded by Fuyutsuki when Ra's Al Ghul is explaining his evil scheme:
    
    **Fuyutsuki:** If you mean to detail your nefarious plan to me, shouldn't we be eating dinner? Or did you plan to aim a laser at my crotch?
    
-   _A Teacher's Glory_ has Zabuza sit down to a (non-poisoned) picnic with Asuma and Anko before they fight, because Asuma believes getting accurate information on Mist is more important than immediate killing Zabuza.

-   _The Ultimate Evil_: While Valerie is recovering in Shendu's hideout, he makes her dine with him on Chinese takeout at one point.

    Film — Animation 

-   After Mr. Incredible defeats the first Omnidroid in _The Incredibles_, Syndrome invites him to have dinner with Mirage, keeping his identity a secret for the time being. On the second flight to the island, he's provided with prawns in cocktail sauce and mimosa cocktails.
-   _Son of the White Horse_: All three dragons offer to share their meals with Treeshaker before their fight to the death — the first two because he pretends to be a mere guest, the third because he's simply good-mannered despite knowing Treeshaker had killed his brothers. The first two times, Treeshaker sits down with the dragons but rejects their offer of eating rocks, crystals and ores. The third time, he drinks the dragon's wine before the monster even arrives, rendering his offer moot.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Parodied in the quote at the top of the page in _Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery_. Scott is baffled as to why his father is not shooting his Archenemy on the spot and is instead sharing a meal with him.
-   In the _wuxia_ _The Bells of Death_, the protagonist, Wei-Fu, is invited by the main villain, Bandit Lord Tso, for a feast in the bandits' fortress, nevermind Wei-Fu had killed both of Tso's Co-Dragons prior to their meeting, since the Bandit Lord is offering Wei-Fu a We Can Rule Together deal. Things nearly turns ugly for the hero when Wei-Fu gets to meet the Bandit's leading concubine, which turns out to be Wei-Fu's sister that he thought was killed five years earlier.
-   In _The Black Hole_, Dr. Reinhardt invites the visiting crew of the _Palomino_ to dinner, although it's only a _safe bet_ that he's a Mad Scientist at that point:
-   Subverted in _Captain America: The First Avenger_. Colonel Philips brings Arnim Zola a steak dinner during his interrogation. Zola suspects that it might be drugged and refuses it, claiming vegetarianism on medical grounds. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> Philips shrugs and eats it himself.
    
    **Zola:** You are trying to intimidate me, Colonel.
    
-   Subverted in _Congo_. Captain Wanta invites (then demands) that his prisoners partake of coffee and cake. They mostly ignore this and start 'negotiating' (e.g. bribing) their release, but when the universally despised Herkermer Homolka tries eating a slice of cake, Wanta not only orders him to stop, he makes him spit it out again.
-   _Death Ring_: After abducting Matt, Vachs has him brought to a formal dinner so he can be introduced the the men who will be hunting him.
-   _Desire (1936)_: The Spanish criminals out for the stolen jewel, the American everyman in possession of the jewel, and the redeemed love interest who stole the jewel sit down for a classy meal. Each side suspects that the others know that it knows, so they have a nice chat about whether there has to be a war and if America will have the sense to stay out of it. Everyone's looking for an opportunity to turn it into a showdown.
-   Inverted in the campy _Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze_. Captain Seas invites our heroes to dinner and only reveals himself as the villain _after_ the meal.
    
    **Seas:** Anyway I'm glad you enjoyed your dinner...because it's going to be your last. _(waiters all produce guns)_
    
-   _The Empire Strikes Back_: Darth Vader: "We would be honored if you would join us." Said after he casually blocks laser blasts with his hand. Laser blasts that Han shot first. With after-dinner torture, too! Though they don't end up having the dinner onscreen, _Robot Chicken_ has a skit showing what happens when they do. It's awkward.
    -   Lampshaded in the RiffTrax:
        
        **Chad Vader**: Brunch, anyone?
        
-   _Frankenstein Island_: Upon learning of the balloonists' presence on the island, Mad Scientist Sheila Frankenstein dispatches her henchmen to fetch them and bring them to her house. Upon their arrival, she shares a fine bottle of cognac with them (presumably the budge of the film didn't stretch to actual food).
-   In the movie _Hannibal_, the serial-killing antagonist kidnaps Clarice Starling's antagonistic former boss. After drugging and subduing both the man and Starling, he dresses the woman up in an elegant gown and has a fancy candlelight dinner with both of them. Then again, he's actually removing portions of the man's brain, cooking them right there at the table, and feeding them to him.

-   In the _James Bond_ parody _If Looks Could Kill_, Steranko insists on eating dinner with Michael after he's been captured. Unlike other examples, he is mostly serious because he does not need the hero dead, simply out of the way.
-   Inverted in the _Infernal Affairs_ films, where top cop Wong has a habit of welcoming gangsters into custody with take-out.
-   James Bond is particularly prone to this; perhaps he just seems a pleasant dinner companion.
    -   _Dr. No_. The Trope Maker. After Bond and Honey Ryder are captured by Dr. No's guards, Dr. No invites them to dine with him. He and Bond have a leisurely conversation, with Dr. No explaining his background and plans, complimenting Bond's intelligence and trying to recruit him to join SPECTRE. Bond responds by insulting him, so Dr. No orders his guards to torture him. Justified in this instance, since Dr. No is trying to understand Bond better.
    -   As mentioned in the description above, _Goldfinger_. While Bond is being kept prisoner in Goldfinger's compound, he is brought out to Goldfinger's front porch and the two drink some Mint Julip. Justified in that Goldfinger is keeping Bond alive as part of a gambit to trick his handlers into thinking Bond has control of the situation. Thus the appearance of the two having a friendly chat over drinks keeps any investigators from looking any deeper into Bond's situation to realize he's being held captive.
    -   _The Man with the Golden Gun_. James Bond travels to Scaramanga's island with the intent of killing him and rescuing Bond's partner Miss Goodnight. Scaramanga welcomes him to the island, gives him a guided tour and invites him to lunch (with Miss Goodnight wearing a bikini rather than evening wear - which would be almost as absurd since they're not having dinner). During lunch, Scaramanga challenges Bond to a duel to the death, and Bond accepts.
    -   Subverted in _The Spy Who Loved Me_. Stromberg invites Bond to join him for dinner so that Bond will be sitting right in the sights of the gun attached to the underside of the table. Bond figures it out, gets clear in time and returns the favor down the firing tube.
    -   _Octopussy_. Over dinner Kamal Khan has an amiable discussion with Bond over how he's going interrogate him—he prefers a can't-miss Truth Serum combo that results in permanent brain damage. It's not this conversation but the stuffed sheep's head with the eyes still intact that puts Bond off his meal. That and how The Dragon is Death Glaring. "I lose my appetite which I get stared at."
-   In _Kingsman: The Secret Service_, Valentine shares a lovely dinner with whatever guests he sways to his side. This helps the Prime Minister to follow him, while the Swedish Princess says he's completely insane. Later, Valentine more directly invokes the trope by eating with an undercover Harry. Their main course is... McDonald's. This dinner also has a practical side, as the wine Harry ingested contains a special gel that allows him to track Harry's movements.
-   _The Legend of Tarzan_: Rom invites Jane to dine with him while she is his captive on his riverboat; with the understanding that if she refuses, he will drop her friend into the river to be eaten by crocodiles.
-   Inverted in _Miami Blues_ when Detective Hoke Moseley (Fred Ward) appears at suspect "Herman Gottlieb's" (Alec Baldwin) apartment to brace him, invites himself to dinner ("Pork Chops? I'll put my teeth in for that!") and proceeds to needle him throughout the meal. ("So — where'd you do your time?")

-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_: Barbossa "asks" the captured Elizabeth to have dinner with him. While other villains might do this to take advantage of the heroine, to show that they are civilized, or to just plain gloat, Barbossa is pretty original in that he's so hungry due to his curse, he just wants to watch someone eat.

-   _Posse (1975)_: While holding Marshal Nightingale hostage in the presidential suite, Jack Strawhorn shares a meal with him, with them the two of them even discussing what to have for dessert. However, because Nightingale has his hands cuffed behind him, Mrs Ross is forced to feed him.
-   _The Quick and the Dead_: Ellen (Sharon Stone) took up Herod's (Gene Hackman's) offer of dinner. She went, loaded for revenge but got spooked by Herod's Breaking Speech and the ultimate ramifications of succeeding.

-   In _The Shadow_, the second time Lamont Cranston encounters Shiwan Khan, the villain is eating dinner at a small restaurant. He invites Lamont Cranston to eat, having already ordered for him. Inverted during their first meeting where Lamont is the host and offers Khan a drink while discussing murder and mayhem.
-   There's a scene from _Snatch._ that goes like this: protagonist Turkish has screwed up a deal he had with London Gangster Bricktop, which cost Bricktop a lot of money. Turkish runs back to his office, hoping he can get there and take all the money he has in his safe and flee the country. Bricktop and his goons are already there. Rather than killing Turkish, Bricktop has Turkish make everyone some tea, has a surprisingly civilized conversation where he explains what Turkish has to do to make up for this, and then, just before leaving, forces Turkish to open his safe and give everything inside to Bricktop.
-   In _Snowpiercer_ Curtis is treated to this, at gunpoint, when he reaches the front of the eponymous train and confronts Wilford. A steak and a We Can Rule Together speech almost make him agreee to step into Wilford shoes.
-   In _Spy Kids_, the spy parents eventually manage to escape from their cell and make their way to the main room, only to find Floop waiting there with a dinner and holding a timer:
    
    **Floop**: Fifteen minutes to escape. With your reputations, I was expecting something a _little_ more impressive. _Finally_, we can eat!
    

    Literature 

-   _Alex Rider_ series: Alex dines with almost every one of the Big Bads in each book, mostly as a Faux Affably Evil gesture before they plan to kill him.
    -   Taken to its logical extreme in _Skeleton Key_ where General Sarov more or less tries to _adopt_ him and treats him like his now-dead biological son, after Alex ends up getting captured. Much of the book is the Big Bad letting (or rather, forcing) Alex to live with him in his luxury home, getting him to take part in various activities (like horse riding) and telling Alex We Can Rule Together. And dining with him. He even forbids his Mooks and The Dragon from harming him (the latter glefully disobeys). When Alex finally foils his Evil Plan and puts himself at his mercy, he chooses to shoot himself rather than kill him.

-   Older Than Feudalism: Joseph subjects his brothers to something rather like this in the Book of Genesis. Joseph is a good guy who intends his brothers no harm, but the brothers, who had previously sold him into slavery, _think_ this is what happened when they realize who he was. It's also extended in time, with the brothers dining and staying with Joseph _twice_ before he tells them who he is.
-   _Books of the Raksura_ has a decidedly dark variant when Moon and the Raksura-Fell hybrid Shade are stuck in a lair of the Always Chaotic Evil Fell: the "dinner" is a pile of corpses from the last town the Fell raided, and when Shade refuses to eat, the Faux Affably Evil captors offer to butcher Moon for their meal instead. Shade placates them by taking one bite, but is left traumatized by the experience.
-   In _Bulldog Drummond_, the chapter "In Which He Spends A Quiet Night At The Elms" has Drummond spending a night as the guest of the Big Bad. The invitation is issued rather forcefully (he's abducted at gunpoint), but the rest of the event is one of at least surface civility, because Drummond has something the Big Bad wants.
-   Used in the _Ciaphas Cain_ (HERO OF THE IMPERIUM!) novel _Duty Calls_, as the antagonist, Radical Inquisitor Killian invites Ciaphas to dine with him and his ally Metheius, partially to boast but also to try to recruit him. Cain is understandably a little discomforted at eating with Killian, but plays along, commenting that Killian is the sort of megalomaniac who seems to need this sort of validation of his cleverness.

-   In Stephen King's _The Dark Tower_ series, the legend of "Oriza" is that Oriza invited her father's murderer into her castle to talk peace over dinner. He's afraid she'll hide a weapon in her clothes, so she suggests that they dine naked (to which he immediately agrees: Oriza is a hottie). Midway through dinner, she throws a sharpened _plate_ at him, severing his head (making this an inversion: she's considered the hero).
-   In Tim Powers' _Dinner at Deviant's Palace_, the climactic sequence is a formal sit-down dinner for the villain, the hero, and a few dozen of the villain's underlings, complete with waiters and engraved invitations.
-   Early in _Dracula_, Dracula plays host (and after Jonathan realizes he's a prisoner) and jailer to Jonathan Harker, and provides him with delicious meals. Although it's more than likely that Dracula does not eat... food, he's apparently a Supreme Chef (or else his "brides" are), since there are no human servants at the castle.
-   In _The Dresden Files_ novel _Death Masks_, Harry is captured by the demonic Nicodemus. When he comes to, Nicodemus has set out a full breakfast spread... only Harry's tied up and suspended under a running stream (cutting him off from magical energy). Nicodemus prepares for things like this, and all Harry has to do to join him for breakfast is make a little arrangement.
-   In _Halo: First Strike_, the bridge crew and Spartans of the _Gettysburg-Ascendant Justice_ are invited to refreshments by Governor Jiles, leader of an insurgent human community, while they discuss receiving repairs for their vessel. Also From My Own Personal Garden, as Jiles comments about the asteroid's hydroponic gardens. A subversion of the usual connotations, however, in that Jiles originally intended to just raid their ship, take anything valuable, and take them prisoner and/or kill them without a meal. The meal was meant more as a "peace offering" after Vice Admiral Whitcomb demonstrated the power of their ship's plasma weaponry and made it clear he was willing to blow the insurgents up before they got close (which he couldn't effectively do because he only had one or two working turrets, but Jiles didn't need to know that).
-   _Honor Harrington_:
    -   Inverted: the protagonist hero in _Honor Among Enemies_ not only invites captured enemy naval officers to dine with her, but actually involves one of them in a planning session to take out a pirate.
    -   In _Storm From The Shadows_, Mike Henke is invited to dinner with Eloise Pritchart, President of the Republic of Haven. As with the earlier example, it's a pleasant dinner, especially since it's a setup for Pritchart using Mike as her emissary to deliver a truce offering to Manticore.
-   A pervasive trope in _The Hunger Games_ trilogy. Meals in the Capitol are so opulent that it would take days to gather the ingredients in Katniss' home district, where starvation is common. The implication is that the Capitol is so overwhelmingly powerful that any rebellion will be easily crushed, possibly by starvation. The delicious meals the Tributes are given are a reminder that they'd better play along.
-   _The Jennifer Morgue_ by Charles Stross has the secret agent protagonist captured by the evil billionaire who's trying to resurrect a shoggoth. The next morning, he and his lovely CIA agent contact are treated to breakfast by the billionaire and his wife. Justified as the billionaire has invoked the tropes of James Bond movies as a geas. He plans to keep the agent locked in the trope of the solitary agent going it alone against the megalomaniac until no one else can possibly intervene, at which point he breaks the geas, kills the agent, and takes over the world before anyone can stop him.
-   In Richard Connell's short story, "The Most Dangerous Game", General Zaroff treats Rainsford to a glass of champagne and a filet mignon, although this is _before_ he find out the Zaroff is a madman who hunts humans for sport.
-   In the second _Neogicia_ novel, the protagonist Saly gets abducted by the leader of an enemy faction who wants to find out more about one of her Bio-Augmentation induced powers. Since he wants her in top shape for this, he has her sleep in a nice room, has servants dress her in nice clothing and give her a good meal. The incentive he has in case Saly refuses to demonstrate? A Mercy Lead to escape his castle.
-   "Heroic" example: when Nero Wolfe invites a suspect for interrogation or a police force rival who's interfering in his investigation, he usually makes sure to treat them to a meal, and maybe a visit to his orchids in the greenhouse. Differentiated in that Wolfe very much _does_ believe in Sacred Hospitality, and generally only extends that kind of invitation - when it isn't entirely social - to people he honestly expects to be better off afterwards. (Whether they'll be happy about it being a quite different matter.) When a guest, he's equally careful to extricate himself before taking actions that may harm his host.
-   An Older Than Steam "heroic" example: early in the _Poem of the Cid_ (the epic on which _El Cid_ is loosely based), the Cid invites the Count of Barcelona to eat dinner with him after the count is defeated and captured in battle. When the count says he isn't hungry, the Cid tells him that if he eats he will be given treasure and sent home on a fast horse, and if he does not eat he will not be ransomed and will languish in chains. He decides to eat.
-   In _Ranger's Apprentice_, in the fifth book Will stops Skandians from raiding by inviting them to a dinner with the lords and ladies at the castle.
-   A very well justified example in the _Replica_ series. The organization was very nice to Chris when they captured him. Because if they could corrupt him, they'd have an agent close to Amy and Andy. And if he uses the opportunity to escape, they really don't care. He's Not Worth Killing.
-   Done in some versions of _Robin Hood_, when Robin's band kidnaps some unfortunate priest or sheriff and forces him to sit down and eat (and sometimes bunk) with them, after which they empty the man's wallet for payment.
-   In _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, Guan Yu, sworn brother of Liu Bei, is forced to surrender to Liu's enemy Cao Cao. Cao has Guan appointed to high rank of nobility and presents him with every gift imaginable in order to win him over. Eventually, however, after "thanking" Cao by defeating two generals serving another warlord, Yuan Shao, Guan leaves Cao's forces to rejoin Liu, killing several of Cao's men on the way.
-   In _The Ship Who... Won_, after Keff's captured by Mage Chaumel, Chaumel shows off where and how he lives and hosts a dinner with other mages, whose purpose is really to show off Keff as his prize. Between the rampant Tampering with Food and Drink and being yanked around constantly so mages can question him and keep him disoriented, Keff barely gets a bite to eat and when he finally has enough of this treatment and protests it he's bombarded with horrific visions, until Plennafrey rescues him.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Although one of the most basic moral norms in the series' world is the "guest right" — that no matter how much you want someone dead, if he eats bread and salt at your table, you must not harm him — there is someone who doesn't care in the slightest about basic morality. Cue the Red Wedding, in which no less than a viewpoint character is murdered by her brother's new father-in-law, immediately after watching her son and all his guards brutally killed.
    -   Roose Bolton gives a travel-weary Brienne a clean change of clothes, a nice, warm meal, and polite conversation, and then, with just as much politeness, turns her over to be gang-raped and killed.
    -   The other dinner guest is Jaime, who Roose really does want to get on his side if possible, since he's been badly hurt while in the custody of some people technically working for Roose, and has the power to bring a whole lot of trouble down on Roose's head depending on what he says to who about it. Roose plays nice, but also makes the threat clear in some subtle ways, like serving food that Jaime can't eat without help because it's all stuff that requires two hands to cut.

-   _Temeraire_: In _Empire of Ivory_, after King Mokhachane has Laurence brutally beaten for refusing to give up intelligence on the Atlantic slave trade and the poor guy nearly dies of infection as a result, Prince Moshueshue tries a different tack—he waits for Laurence to heal up before calling for him again, and sits him down for drinks. Unlike most examples of this trope, Laurence willingly answers Moshueshue's questions, and so the prince gets quite a bit of valuable information that goes on to influence the events of later books.

-   In volume 4 of _The Unexplored Summon://Blood-Sign_, the Yandere Big Bad forces Kyousuke to eat breakfast with her. She is not at all concerned by the fact that she had to beat him into unconsciousness several times before he complied.
-   Used by the Macellarius bloodline in a _Vampire The Requiem_ introduction short story. The Macellarius are uber-Affably Evil types who are enormously obese vampiric cannibals, gorging themselves on their enemies as they conquer the Requiem. In an odd twist, the Macellarius leader invites two potential converts to dinner, selects one to join the bloodline and has the other killed and eaten as a welcome feast.
-   This happens in _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_. On "the island of the voices", the Narnians suddenly find themselves surrounded by invisible "dufflepuds", claiming to be holding weapons, who demand that Lucy goes into a magician's room to remove the enchantment making them invisible. When the Narnians agree to this, the dufflepuds warmly invite them into their house to dinner and to stay the night, before Lucy fulfills their demand the following morning.
-   The 1980s educational book _Write Your Own Adventure Programs for Your Microcomputer_ suggests this as a puzzle in a spy-themed adventure game: the Big Bad has captured the protagonist, taken away their weapons, and invited them to dinner. Over dessert, he shows them the remote control for his world decimator weapon. The book's suggested solution: The player throws the dessert in the villain's face, grabs the remote control, and escapes.
-   _Young Sherlock Holmes_: In _Red Leech_, Duke Balthassar has Sherlock, Virginia and Matty sit down with for an meal which, for the most part, proceeds quite civilly as he attempts to find out how much they know about his scheme. After the meal, he orders them thrown to his Komodo dragons.

Hornblower states that he needs to know who the traitor is, as it would be cruel to let him die not knowing who betrayed him.
-   _House of Anubis_: Miss Denby catches Patricia sneaking around by the gatehouse with Denby's bag. In the next scene with them we see Denby and Patricia were simply 'having a nice tea' while Denby was interrogating Patricia in the nicest manner possible. Patricia was visibly horrified the entire time, because who knows what Denby would have done if she really tried to flee or fight?

    -   In _Kamen Rider Double_, Sonozaki Ryubee thinks it's a great idea to have one last family dinner before he starts the Gaia Impact.

-   _Stargate_:
    -   _Stargate SG-1_: In "Unnatural Selection", after the Replicators capture SG-1, they allow the team a night's sleep and treat them to a really nice and extremely creepy meal. The Replicators don't hide the fact that they're only keeping SG-1 alive so that they can enjoy mind-raping them ("Could there be any other reason we would keep you alive?"), so the quality of the meal doesn't make any sense in-story, unless the replicators were 'seasoning SG1's minds' with it; but the trope probably just leaked out of the writers' brains.
    -   _Stargate Atlantis_:
        -   In the pilot episode, the Wraith Keeper introduces herself to Sumner; she offers him food which he refuses, prompting her to wonder why would he resist his hunger when it's "distasteful". Predictably, the corpse of her previous meal is still sitting at the table.

    -   In the Season 4 finale, the angels kidnap Dean and put him in "Heaven's Waiting Room," as Dean calls it: an ornately decorated Victorian-style room with a couple of bowls of bacon cheeseburgers (one of Dean's favorite foods, though it's never directly stated) so Zachariah can convince him to sit back and let the Apocalypse happen. Castiel eventually rebels and gets Dean out of there.
    -   In Season 5, Dean tries to ambush The Grim Reaper, who's taken a breather in a Chicago pizzeria. Instead, Death reclaims his scythe and firmly tells Dean to sit down and have a slice of deep-dish.

(2017)_: In the first episode of season 5, "Vagabundo", the Affably Evil villain of the week, Arthur Novak, gets Hondo locked up by some corrupt Mexican cops and then arranges for him to be released for a lunch meeting so Arthur can persuade him to do something for him. Hondo no-sells the meal, even though Arthur makes pains to note this is rude in the Mexican culture to which Hondo is a visitor; Hondo goes on to subvert one aspect of the trope by unexpectedly giving in to pragmatism and attempting to do the villain's bidding, attempting to persuade the damsel of the week to sell the villain her farm. Ultimately negotiations break down and the villain has the damsel kidnapped at the end of the episode, forcing Hondo to prepare to rescue her.

    Hear them howling, my hungry children  
    Maybe you should stay and have another drink and think about me and you"

-   _The Elder Scrolls_: In the recurring in-game book, _A Game at Dinner_, all of the other spies fully expect the dinner to be part of a plot to reveal and kill them by King Helseth. They're not wrong, but this being King Helseth, it doesn't play out in the way they thought.
-   _Far Cry 4_: Despite the violent introduction that Ajay Ghale (the player) receives from Pagan Min at the beginning of the game, Pagan is uncomfortably friendly towards Ajay for no currently apparent reason. Likewise, their introduction is followed by Ajay receiving nothing short of a VIP treatment (dinner included) from Pagan, complete with a precarious atmosphere. Needless to say, even after leaving his estate against his request, joining his archenemy the Golden Path, killing off large swathes of his army often single-handedly, and turning the tide of the civil war rocking his country in favor of the Golden Path to the point of an imminent coup, he still manages to retain at the end of the game enough of a stoic attitude to basically reprise the dinner from the game's prologue only to ask for a chance to explain himself to Ajay what he didn't get to explain prior due to Ajay escaping. In addition, if Ajay stays in the dining hall during the first dinner at Pagan's request and waits for his return, he will explain himself, this time _without_ the need for the civil war in the country to escalate further.
-   In _Final Fantasy VI_, halfway through the game, Emperor Gesthal invites the party to his castle to have a feast and reassures them that his kingdom is too ravaged from the Espers' attack to fight the party, so he wants to help them calm the Espers. He also tells the party that Kefka will be punished for his crimes. This is just a big fat lie since later on, Kefka attacks a village to get more Espers and he meets up with Geshtal on the Floating Continent so they can get more power. Interestingly enough, what the party actually does and says during the feast is largely up to the player, and depending on how successful they are at humoring Gesthal, they can get a variety of useful items as a reward.
-   In _Final Fantasy XV_, Ardyn is resurrected in the Magitek Research laboratory of Vestrael, and and he is greeted with a meal composed of artificial food. When Ardyn discovers that he is dinning with a mad scientist, he utters the classic quote "You're Insane!".

The final chapter has the heroes, Estelle and Joshua, win a dinner party in the Queen's castle, and said villain invites them to chat over drinks, unaware that they eavesdropped on him earlier. During their meeting, he expresses admiration for Estelle's father and how he saved their country from a huge war in the past, appreciating the chance to talk to his children. Unlike most examples of this trope, his intentions are totally sincere, and Estelle is taken aback at how nice he turned out to be afterwards. However, his blind hero worship does play into his villainous motivation, as Richard believed that without Estelle's father, the country had no hope of defending itself without resorting to a mysterious and dangerous superweapon, and this ends up being the climactic conflict.

-   King Johann invites _Dominic Deegan_ to dinner to discuss negotiations and explanations after Dominic has foiled half his plots and made serious setbacks. And then the dinner turns out to be an illusion over an Eldritch Location (which is exceptionally frightening because Dominic is usually immune to magic illusions). And then THAT turns out to be an illusion, because Dominic is actually in a cage while Johann is magically dissecting his brain.
-   In _Drowtales_, when Ariel's squad arrives in Felde, the colony presided over by chessmistress Big Bad Snadhya'rune, the latter arranges for Ariel and Faen to come sit at the head table with her. Snadhya is - officially - a neutral party in the District War, and a Villain with Good Publicity besides, but Ariel is still extremely distrusting of a woman whose clan is the Sarghress' main opponent. Snadhya, however, immediately begins a charm offensive, assuring Ariel that she is not a threat, speaking of her admiration for the Sarghress and even pointing out that the two of them share their signature color, purple. It seems to be going halfway decently, and then Kalki chops Ariel's arm off. The other guests react accordingly.

-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_:
    -   During _Wielder of Names_, God-Emperor Nadia Om catches Allison, who wields the Master Key prophesized to be used by The Chosen One to kill her, sneaking into her palace. Rather than killing Allison and taking the Key off her cooling corpse, Nadia has Allison dressed up, given a one-person banquet and then a personal guided tour around her palace. It quickly turns out Mottom doesn't want Allison dead, nor does she want the Master Key, as taking it would immediately turn the other Demiurges against her. Instead, at the end of the tour, she offers Allison her entire empire because she's too bound by The Chains of Commanding and wants to be free of it all.
    -   Much later, during _Breaker of Infinities_, Allison ends up hosted by fellow God-Emperor Jadis, who graciously offers Allison a nice nutritious breakfast in her atrium. In contrast with Mottom, Jadis has no ulterior motives (at least from her point of view); she simply wants Allison to give up her quest because she foresees a whole lot of suffering in Allison's future and wants to spare her from it.

    -   In another scene, Perry attacks Doof in a train's dining cart. This is part of Doof's plan, since a special agent like Perry would know that you can't just make a scene in a fancy dining environment, thus trapping him by societal convention. Perry and Agent Lyla get out of it by stealing some of Doof's fries, annoying him in a socially acceptable way until he attacks first, justifying their retaliation..

    Real Life 

-   During World War II, both British and Germans developed the practice of treating important prisoners of war who might have valuable information to fine meals and otherwise excellent treatment, especially early on in their captivity. This was, of course, a calculated trick, so that POWs might slip up and reveal potentially useful information when softened up by good food and good wine. This did yield some valuable information: for example, a high-ranking German general accidentally revealed key details about the V-2 program while in hospitable British captivity.
