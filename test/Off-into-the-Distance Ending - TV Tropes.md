**Dipper:** Ready to head into the unknown?  
**Mabel:** Nope. Let's do it.

The story ends with The Protagonist(s) traveling away into the distance, while the camera remains in a fixed position. Often symbolizes that the protagonist is leaving behind their old life and about to start a new one. May have a happy mood or a somber one, depending on how much they liked their old life and how willingly they're leaving it.

In any case, it says that this is where they and the audience part company; whatever happens next, the audience will not get to see.

This is often coupled with But Now I Must Go.

A type of Hat-and-Coat Shot, and a Super-Trope to Riding into the Sunset. See also Moving-Away Ending, a subtrope that involves a character moving away from somewhere else.

As Slocumb walks away from the canyon's edge in disbelief, the final sequence would have been a static shot of the Thunderbird driving away from the camera towards a distant mountain, as B.B.

    Literature 

-   _The Dragon Waiting_ by John M. Ford ends with two of the protagonists departing on horseback: "Without any noise, they rode away, and soon were lost to sight." Notably, although the book is in tight-third, and the viewpoint character in the final scene is one of the characters who rides away, on the final sentence the viewpoint changes; there are no other characters there, so there is no sight for the characters to be lost from except that of the audience.
-   In _The Dreamside Road_, Enoa and Orson get a heroes’ sendoff from the Wintertide Festival. They fly away in the Aesir on their way to search for the Dreamside Road.
-   Frodo, in _The Lord of the Rings,_ inverts the Riding into the Sunset subtrope, with the last line from his point of view being of him sailing toward a far green country under a swift sunrise. The following paragraph then plays it straight from Sam's point of view, as he stands on the shore and watches Frodo's ship disappear into the night.
-   Subverted in _Tigana_ by Guy Gavriel Kay. At the end, the protagonists ride away around a bend in the road — and then there is one more sentence about what happened to them around the next bend to make the point that just because the story ends here doesn't mean the characters have nothing left to do.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Battlestar Galactica_'s Distant Finale ends with HeadGaius and HeadSix hinting that the mythical elements of the series (including the existence of a God) are true before they walk off through the busy streets of modern-day New York.

-   The pilot of _Person of Interest_ ends with the hero walking off into a crowded street of New York.
-   In the final scene of _Veronica Mars_, Veronica walks away into the rain, signifying the consequences of the series finale being rather crappy (her Dad's facing charges that could land him serious jail time for protecting her, and their primary opponent for her Dad's old job as Sheriff is a corrupt puppet of the Mafia). As the camera pans out, we get the impression that Veronica is upset not only because she inadvertently got her Dad in trouble, but because she knows she'll never change her ways.

    Music Videos 

-   Miserable ends with the Giant Woman devouring each of her male would-be inamoratos one after the other, then strutting off into the horizon, pleased with her actions.

    **Corporal Garrett:** What, no wise-ass comment, Slauson?  
    **Private Slauson:** Yeah, I've never seen anything more beautiful either.
    
-   _Middle-earth: Shadow of War_ 's Golden Ending has Talion walking into the afterlife to join his family.

-   Near the end of _The Cleveland Show_ episode "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'", Rallo and Junior head homeward by having Junior, who is dressed as a sheep, carry Rallo on his back while he walks all fours and hums "Happy Trails".
-   _Futurama_'s original Grand Finale played with this trope: Fry and Leela don't walk away together, but Fry's crude hologram interpretation of them does, and it indicates that the two may end up together after all.
    
    -   Similarly, the fourth Big Damn Movie "Into the Wild Green Yonder" ends with Fry and Leela having their first kiss as the Planet Express ship escapes from Zapp Brannigan via a wormhole. Coincidentally, this was intended to be another Grand Finale until Comedy Central picked up the show, and started its run where the movie left off.
