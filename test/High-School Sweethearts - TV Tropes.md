**Itoshiki**: You could even say that relationships in high school are a preview of love, for when you seriously fall in love!... I think I just said something smart.  
**Abiru Kobushi**: No, not really.  
**Itoshiki**: Oh. Yet high schoolers these days skip the preview and go straight for the real thing!... I think I _really_ said something smart this time.

This is when a married couple first met and started dating as teenagers in high school. Some teenagers treat their relationships like the be-all and end-all of the world, and sometimes the author agrees, implying or directly showing that they marry and live Happily Ever After. Fiction writers might do this to avoid addressing the sad fact that the lovely couple making out at the end of a teen romance story would probably break up after high school in the real world, especially if one or both parties go to college. In a darker application of this trope, they might end up Married Too Young.

In a Magical Girl setting, sometimes this is justified by the assertion that they fall in love Because Destiny Says So.

To some extent, this may simply be harkening back to a simpler time, as, prior to the end of World War II, far fewer people went to college, and those who didn't frequently married straight out of high school. This trope is still present today, but is largely limited to more conservative "no sex before marriage" cultures.

Compare also with Childhood Friend Romance, where the couple can also start dating in high school but they've known each other for much longer than that.

-   In _His and Her Circumstances_ we have Yukino and Arima, due to Teen Pregnancy.
-   _Horimiya_: Hori's parents dated in high-school and got married soon after graduating. Miyamura also proposes to Hori in chapter 63, though whether or not they count as officially engaged is somewhat hazy (for what it's worth, they do end up married with a son in the original webcomic).

    -   Tsubame mentions that this was the case with her older brother and sister-in-law while discussing the legend of the Devoted Hearts Festival.
    -   Kaguya's cameo in a bonus chapter of _Oshi no Ko_ (which takes place several years after _Kaguya-sama_) shows that she and Shirogane are already married since she's using his surname.
-   In the _Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl_ manga, the sweethearts are bound by the "fate-gene" and will both die when one of them stops loving the other. Add this to the fact that they are still very young _and_ of the same gender in a fairly homophobic society and you have a situation which might complicate their future lives.
-   In the original _Mazinger Z_ manga, and most of continuities, Kouji and Sayaka are this, meeting and falling in love when they attended high-school.
-   Suletta and Miorine from _Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury_ are an interesting case, not just meeting on Suletta's first day at the elite Asticassia School of Technology, but immediately becoming _engaged_ per the rules of a Duels Decide Everything system implemented by Miorine's father.

-   Rino and Nozomu from _My Girlfriend Without Wasabi_ met their first day of college (Nozomu's first day anyways, Rino was a third year student). By the time of _I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying_ four years later, they're Happily Married.
-   Akane and Kazuya in _My-HiME_ are paired up right from the get-go. When he dies, Akane's whole world collapses. When Kazuya's Back from the Dead, Akane recovers and happily joins the last HiME battle, and they're last seen as borderline Sickeningly Sweethearts.

-   _Ranma ½_, though they have a rough time getting there, and never _do_ quite make it, Word of God says they will eventually work it out.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   The manga perpetrated the Because Destiny Says So version of the trope with Mamoru and Usagi, but mostly averted it otherwise. (Usagi is in middle school and Mamoru is finishing high school), but it's averted in the 90s anime where Mamoru is already in college. Then _Sailor Moon Crystal_ puts Mamoru back into high school.
    -   Haruka and Michiru are a straight (so to speak) example, though, as they met when they were both in high school.

-   Takashi and Miho, Hana's parents, from _7 Seeds_ had a "students' marriage" when they were in college.
-   _Tiger & Bunny_'s first Drama CD implies that Kotetsu Kaburagi married Tomoe Amamiya, a superhero fan from his high school class who helped him come up with his eventual superhero codename. (Not only that, but she was actually _thrilled_ to learn that he wanted to be a superhero, since she had thought he was a delinquent up until then!) Sadly, poor Tomoe was also sick, and she passed away some years before the series started.
-   _Tokyo Mew Mew_. This even extended to Ichigo's parents, who themselves met in junior high.
-   _Tonari no Kashiwagi-san_:
    -   Yuuto wants this sort of relationship with Kotone, to the point that he applied to the same university as her (which is actually far harder than the one he was initially planning on going to).
    -   Kotori and Takuya's relationship is half this, half Childhood Friend Romance, since she was in 12th grade and he was in 6th when they started dating.
-   The manga _Ultra Maniac_ includes not one but _three_ couples who pair up in junior high, and are still strongly together at the end of high school, suggesting a Happily Ever After for all of them.
-   _Wolf Girl and Black Prince_: Erika Shinohara and Kyouya Sata start fake dating as high school students, only for it to turn into something real. In the epilogue, they are shown married with a daughter, who was conceived out of wedlock.
-   In _Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku_, Beta Couple Kabakura and Koyanagi have been dating since high school. They're still together as working adults, albeit with a lot of bickering. Kabakura finally proposes to Koyanagi in volume 7, and they later get married in volume 9.

    Film 

-   Main plot point of the movie _17 Again (2009)_. The spark dies out in the marriage of two High-School Sweethearts. In a freak aesop inducing incident he becomes seventeen again, in hopes of getting another chance at life. Guess what he learns and who he ends up with.
-   Andy and Polly, two teens in Everytown, America in the Andy Hardy film series. No matter what momentary complications ensue, Andy and Polly are getting back together by the end—until series finale _Andy Hardy Comes Home_, a revival produced 12 years after the main series ended. Actress Ann Rutherford, regarding the High School Sweethearts trope to be unrealistic, refused to return, so a new character was introduced as Andy's wife.
-   The _Back to the Future_ trilogy:
    -   _Back to the Future_: Lorraine states that she knew she would spend the rest of her life with George McFly after they kissed at the High-School Dance. Depending which timeline you're using, this is one week or less after she _met_ him. There may be a slight subversion, though, as in the original timeline, the marriage was less than perfect.
    -   _Back to the Future Part II_:
        -   The main character, Marty, has this relationship with his girlfriend, Jennifer — we see them married with two kids in the future. But in this first timeline, the marriage isn't very happy.
        -   The bad timeline has a newsreel claiming Biff and Lorraine were this, when they were clearly anything but.
-   _Celeste and Jesse Forever_: Celeste and Jesse married each other fresh out of high school, which is one of the reasons why their break-up is so rocky.
-   _The Conjuring Universe_: Ed and Lorraine Warren met and fell in Love at First Sight as teenagers and never looked back, being shown as utterly devoted to each other even thirty years later.
    
    **Lorraine**: Did I ever tell you the story of how we met? ....We were seventeen. I went out with my girlfriends and he was an usher at the movie theater that we went to. Afterwards we went out for ice cream. He took me out to the park, but then it started to rain, and we stood under the gazebo until it stopped. That was thirty years ago. I could go back to the house, Father — but my _home_ is here, with him.
    
-   The _High School Musical_ trilogy:
    -   Troy and Gabriella. In the final movie they end up going to colleges 32.7 miles away from each other, so they can stay together. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
    -   Chad and Taylor offer a more realistic example: They date for most of the trilogy but let things come to an end when they graduate, as Chad admits that you don't take the girl with you after high school. The other couples such as Ryan/Kelsi, Jason/Martha and Zeke/Sharpay are also shown to be more casual, and it's obvious Troy and Gabriella are the exception rather than the rule.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _The Hunger Games_: They don't actually attend high school but Katniss Everdeen and Peeta begin their romance at age sixteen.
-   _The Kissing Booth 3_:
    -   Played straight with Lee and Rachel. They start dating in high school, break up right before college, but reconnect as adults. They are engaged to be married in the epilogue.
    -   Averted with Elle and Noah. Like Lee and Rachel, they begin dating in high school, then break up before the former goes to college. However, despite remaining friendly, they are not shown together as adults.
-   Brutally parodied by _Not Another Teen Movie_. Jake spends much of the film trying to get together with Janey. At the end, she debates whether she should go off to an art school in Paris. Jake starts to convince her not to go, then he realizes the problems with this trope:
    
    **Jake**: Maybe you should get on that plane to Paris. Cause if you stay, we really only have the summer, then I go to college and we'll talk on the phone and spend the occasional weekend together which is nice. But chances are one night I'm gonna get wrecked and have unprotected sex with some girl in my dorm. You'll find her thong and call me a slut... I'll call you a cock-tease and we'll break up. So when you really think about it, what's the point?
    
-   In _Se7en_, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow are a married couple who were high school sweethearts. Morgan Freeman comments on how rare that is. It does NOT end well, sadly.
-   The ultimate fate of Jenna and Matt in _13 Going on 30_.

    Literature 

-   Almost all the main couples in Jodi Picoult's books. They may not still be together, but they did (or will) get married.
-   Several from the Harry Potter books: most notably Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny, but also James/Lily and Arthur/Molly. Neville/Hannah might be another example, but it's not clear whether they dated at Hogwarts or got together later.
    -   Justified, given that Hogwarts is the only school for magic-users in the UK, and British magical society has rather strong Hidden Elf Village tendencies, it's kind of inevitable that this trope would be the norm.
    -   One aversion of this is Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour, as the latter went to Beauxbatons instead of Hogwarts, but that was because she was born and lived in France during her teenage years.
    -   Another aversion is Draco Malfoy, who doesn't end up with Pansy Parkinson, the closest girl to him in school, but the erstwhile new character Astoria Greengrass (younger sister of Daphne Greengrass, a Slytherin girl in Harry's year, who gets exactly _one_ mention in _Order of the Phoenix_). Word of God is that Pansy was created to represent girls who bullied her in school, and she specifically didn't want Malfoy to end up with her, especially after his Character Development.
-   _The Twilight Saga_:
    -   Edward Cullen and Bella Swan got married a few weeks after they both graduated from High School and had their baby a month after it... and it _wasn't_ out of wedlock... Yeah, _Twilight_ is weird like that.
    -   Bella's parents, Charlie and Renée, met in high school, and married shortly after graduation. They divorced soon after, and Renée eventually married another man in her thirties.
-   Averted in _Betsy-Tacy_. Despite the large Crowd and multiple love affairs, very few characters end up marrying their high school sweetheart, and instead marry someone they met after graduation.
-   A variation occurs in _The Hunger Games_. Katniss and Peeta don't actually attend school after their games, but they become a couple at seventeen and spend the rest of their lives together.

-   Yumi and Sachiko from _Maria Watches Over Us_ might qualify. In any case, Sachiko wants to attend Lilian University just to stay near Yumi.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Buffy's parents, Joyce and Hank, though they were actually college sweethearts. Joyce met Buffy's father at a school dance, while going stag.
-   Pictured above: Zach and Kelly on _Saved by the Bell_; it even got lampshaded in one episode.<small>◊</small>
-   _Boy Meets World_, which started in _Elementary_ School. Though to be fair, Cory considered Topanga a freak back then, and he didn't really like her until about Middle School.
    -   Later retconned into being "he always loved her, but Eric teased him so much he assumed a 'girls are icky' persona to fit in." How much this explanation works is open to debate.
-   _Dawson's Creek_ ends with Joey and Pacey together.
-   Bob and Amy Duncan in the Disney Channel original series _Good Luck Charlie_. Bob played basketball; Amy was the mascot.
-   Al and Peggy from _Married... with Children_ used to date in high school. However, their marriage is _far_ from being happy. And it's fucking hilarious.
-   Strongly implied to be the fate of Naomi and Emily in _Skins_ (and eventually confirmed by Word of God). Averted with the earlier Tony and Michelle though, who realise that they had great times together but now they're going to different universities.
-   Jenna's parents on _Awkward._ who married at a young age following the Teen Pregnancy that resulted in Jenna.
-   Marshall and Lily on _How I Met Your Mother_ _barely_ escape this trope (they've been together since the first day of college). However, Lily's actual high school sweetheart, Scooter, is convinced he and Lily are this trope, and fifteen years later, he's _still_ in love with her and chasing after her, trying to cajole her into leaving Marshall. One wonders why she hasn't slapped him with a restraining order yet...
-   In the backstory of _The Vampire Diaries_ Matt and Elena seemed to be destined to become this but the deaths of her parents caused her to break off the relationship. Then the Salvatore brothers showed up and Matt realized that they would never get back together. Considering the high death toll in Mystic Falls, it is likely that few of the high school couples will even survive to have a graduation.
-   This is lampshaded and deconstructed on _Shameless (US)_. Lip is extremely intelligent and has a great shot at a college scholarship if he can get over his Brilliant, but Lazy tendencies. His girlfriend Mandy knows that if he goes away to college, their relationship will not survive. However, she does not want to trap Lip in a life of poverty so she goes out of her way to motivate him to apply to colleges and even sends out applications without his knowledge.
-   _Gossip Girl_ has Chuck and Blair, and Dan and Serena.
-   Subverted in the early seasons of _Power Rangers_. Tommy ends up marrying his Second Love, Katherine with whom he did not start dating until just prior to graduation, and spent some time away from post-_Turbo_.
-   Summer and Seth of the _The O.C._ got married at the series finale.
-   Donna and David from _Beverly Hills, 90210_ got married by the end of the series. This was eventually subverted in the spin-off, where we find out they have seperated.
-   This did not work out well for Will Schuester in _Glee_. In fact, one might even call it a Deconstruction. Other than that, there are _plenty_ of those to go around by series finale: Santana and Britney, Kurt and Blaine, Rachel and Jesse all got married (the first two couples actually had a double wedding together). Artie and Tina and Quinn and Puck are hinted to possibly become cases of this as well.
-   During most of the series, this seems to be the case of Kevin and Winnie in _The Wonder Years_... only to be subverted in the Grand Finale.
-   _Pretty Little Liars_: All the relationships of the main characters are this.
-   _The Mentalist_: Or rather, middle-school sweethearts. In "Bloodsport" it's mentioned that Betriz and Manny have been dating since they were thirteen and married since they were seventeen.
-   _Radio Enfer_: A Flash Forward episode portrays Léo and Camille as this trope, even though later episodes (specifically the two-parter episode where Camille breaks up with Léo) indicate it will likely not happen.

    Music 

-   John Cougar Mellencamp's 1982 hit 'Jack and Diane' is _all_ about this trope, and the aftermath when reality hits.
-   A theme so common in youth-oriented music from the 1950s and early 1960s it could almost be a trope in itself.
-   Completely deconstructed and discussed in Slick Rick's "Teenage Love" from _The Great Adventures of Slick Rick_. It initially starts by playing the trope straight, but after enough time passes, the relationship deteriorates badly, with the implication of the relationship becoming very one-sided. Inevitably, the couple breaks up and Rick tells the listeners "If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal with it."
-   Billy Joel's "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant" centers around two high school lovers named Brenda and Eddie, the "popular steadies and the king and the queen of the prom" who marry young but have to divorce due to monetary issues.
-   Chuck Berry's "You Never Can Tell" is about two high school sweethearts who manage to stay together through careful budgeting and partying (and a lot of love!). Basically, Billy Joel's "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant" is what happens when the careful budgeting isn't there, and can be considered an answer record to Chuck Berry's track.

    Newspaper Comics 

-   _For Better or for Worse_ had Elizabeth and Anthony, who dated for a time in high school, decided they were Better as Friends, then were eventually Strangled by the Red String so that the strip could end with a wedding. Michael took this a few steps further with Deanna: she was his first crush back in elementary, moved away, then they were reunited after he witnessed her car accident.
    -   Averted with the youngest Patterson, April. The Strip of Destiny revealed she'd moved away and had hooked up with an unnamed "country boy". Prior to this, however, the strip had teased the idea of her ending up with her childhood friend Gerald.

    Video Games 

-   Aaron and Amy, two of the main characters from the Dating Sim _Always Remember Me_, have been together for a few years, with Amy starting her first year of college. The townspeople even acknowledge them as an Official Couple.
-   In _Double Homework_, since the protagonist and Lauren get engaged in her epilogue, they are implied to become this in the future.
-   Enforced in _Gal\*Gun_, where the actions of some clumsy cupids result in the protagonist being required to find his true love at the high school that very day, or else he will never have a relationship with anyone. Lampshaded in "Double Peace", where the (apprentice) cupid Ekoro claims that studies show most people meet their eventual spouse in high school, and the protagonist responds with "What, do angels read _Cosmo_ as well?"
-   In _Growing Up_, you can date your high school friend and marry them in the epilogue if your sexual orientation is compatible and you developed your relationship with them well enough.
-   Kyo Kusanagi and Yuki from _The King of Fighters_: It's not mentioned _when_ they exactly started dating, but Kyo started the story as a highschool student and Yuki was one of his classmates. And years after Kyo dropped out of highschool (Comic-Book Time notwithstanding), _XIII_ implies that they're still together, even if theirs is a Long-Distance Relationship due to obvious reasons.
-   The _Tokimeki Memorial_ series lives and breathes this trope, thanks to the Legend of the respective High Schools of each game, where it's said that a confession at a specific place of the school (a World Tree in the first and fourth games, a Bell Tower in the second, a slope in the third, a church in the Gender Flip game) during Graduation Day will grant the young sweethearts eternal happiness in their couple. It's thus _very_ Serious Business for (most of) the characters in those games to find love during their 3 years of High School and get this confession at the place of legend ; some of them even joined those specific schools for having the chance of being blessed by this legend, such as Yuu Satsuki of _Tokimeki Memorial_ _4_. One of the girls from the first game, Yukari Koshiki, is the fruit and living proof of the legend - her very Happily Married parents were Kirameki high students, and 20-something years ago they confessed their love under the tree.
-   In _True Love Junai Monogatari_, the Featureless Protagonist's parents make him live on his own (though the flat is owned by the family) in hopes to have him get a girlfriend before he graduates from high school. Out of the eight prospect girlfriends, five (Remi, Mayumi, Mikae, Ryoko and Miyuki) attend his same school (and Mikae's case doubles as Childhood Friend Romance), and another (Katsuya's sister Arisa) goes to a local all-girls highschool, therefore they can fill in this trope if they're pursued.

     Webcomics 

-   _Zoophobia_: Alanzo and Jackie were this, and are now Happily Married.
-   _Kevin & Kell_: Lindesfarne and Fenton met in high school, and are now Happily Married. They avoided the whole 'splitting up due to college' part by going to the same school. Then again, considering Lindesfarne still loved Fenton despite believing him _dead_ for almost a year, it probably wouldn't have stopped them.
    -   By technicality Fiona and Rudy qualify as well. They knew each other as babies, but were apparently too young to remember it, and they fought all the time anyway according to their old daycare minder, so their meeting in high school they considered their 'first' meeting.
-   _Penny and Aggie_: The Class Reunion Distant Finale reveals that of all the teenage couples at Belleville High, only Jack and Katy-Ann stayed together and got married. Although the chapter reveals that the title couple had an Offscreen Breakup sometime during their senior year, now that six years have passed and they've both matured, they decide to give it another shot. They may end up as another example of this, but the strip ends on that note.

-   Janet Claymont and Chadd Crossen from V4 of _Survival of the Fittest_. Turns out it was somewhat one sided though, as Chadd spent his dying moments forgiving Janet for cheating on him, whilst Janet spent hers regretting that she couldn't think of something more worthwhile than him.

    Western Animation 

-   Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable in _Kim Possible_ ultimately become this—they've known each other since their first day of preschool (when they were around three or four) and become an Official Couple the night of their high school prom during their junior year. The second Series Finale of the show tackled the "fall in love in high school, but what about college?"-issue: Ron (who applies to pretty much every single college he can find on the off chance of getting in _somewhere_) stresses over the fact that it's unlikely he'll end up going to the same college as Kim (who, because of her extraordinary physical and academic abilities, could easily get into just about any place of higher education _on the planet_). While viewers aren't shown what happens, Word of God confirms that Kim and Ron will be together forever.
    -   Word of God has also said that they had been planning on eventually making Kim and Ron a couple from the very beginning, instead of having them stay just friends for the entire franchise.
    -   Also, an alternative ending to the second series finale shows that Kim and Ron do end up going to the same college.
-   On _King of the Hill_, Hank and Peggy, Bill and Lenore (before she crushed him in the divorce), and Dale and Nancy are this. And while Nancy does have an affair with John Redcorn for several years, its hard to understand how someone as odd as Dale got with her in the first place.
-   Homer and Marge from _The Simpsons_.
-   _Batman Beyond_, Terry and his long-time girlfriend, Dana, become this in the JLU, fully absorbed finale episode, "Epilogue", when Terry decides he's going to propose to her at the end of the episode.
-   Doughy Latchkey's parents on _Moral Orel_ are this. They _still_ look and act like they're in high school and have find that Doughy gets in the way of this.
-   As with the comics, Cyclops and Jean Grey throughout the various X-Men cartoons, highlighted most obviously in _X-Men: Evolution_ and _Wolverine and the X-Men (2009)_.
-   _The Owl House_:
    -   A flashback from the season 1 finale Implied that Alador and Odalia Blight were dating during their time at Hexside.
    -   Willow's fathers are also shown to have been on a Flying Derby team together during their teenage years via a newspaper clipping in "Any Sport in a Storm", though much like with Odalia and Alador it isn't stated if they were already together.
    -   Eda and Raine first met during an interscholastic event when they were around 14 and became fast friends, with Raine transfering to Hexside shortly afterwards so they could stay together. Sadly, they broke up at some point in their late teens/early twenties because Eda's secretiveness regarding her curse ended up pushing Raine away.
    -   Eda's flashback to her first meeting with Raine also shows two girls in the potions track who appear to be very close and are implied to be Boscha's mothers due to her resemblance to them.
    -   Luz and Amity are well on their way to this by the time of the epilogue, having been together for several years and still going strong as Luz prepares to attend college in the Demon Realm.
