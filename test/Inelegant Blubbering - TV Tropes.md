_"There's a reason God makes you ugly when you're grieving; so people will leave you the hell alone."_

A character cries. Not just any old crying, but full-on **ugly** crying. It tends to be loud, complete with a runny nose and red, puffy eyes. If the character is wearing mascara, expect it to run — badly.

A literary trope, mostly, since we do not have to see the character sobbing. Often lampshaded. Plus actors can more easily mimic tears than the full effect. You may, however, see this on reality TV or daytime talk shows where it's an actual person ugly-crying for real.

Note that this may occur for any motive for which someone can cry.

May be done by a Hysterical Woman.

Liable to turn drama into unintentional comedy if mishandled. This can be done intentionally, as a form of Bathos. But tropes are tools, and this trope can be Played for Drama for a powerful Tearjerker too.

When it's intentionally Played for Laughs, it can lead to the character wiping their eyes and blowing their nose on something that isn't a tissue.

-   In _The Pulse_, Jessica and Luke have a minor argument — really more like a discussion — about her working for the _Daily Bugle_, but the pregnancy throwing her hormones out of whack causes this.

One sting is enough to draw out a long pained hiss; she cracks after the second, which leaves weeping and keening in pain, her tears mixing with the snot coming from her nose. Taylor notes the stark contrast this makes to her normal confident demeanor.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Alice in Wonderland_:
    
    -   Alice gets frustrated with the constant changing of size and cries a river of very undignified tears. Since she's gigantic at this stage, her tears quickly become an ocean.
    
    **Alice:** Oh dear. I do wish I hadn't cried so much.
    
    -   Later, midway through the film, during the "Very Good Advice" song, she does some more bawling when she worries that she's not going to find her way home, blowing her nose when she finishes.
-   The Bimbettes at Gaston's attempted wedding to Belle in _Beauty and the Beast_. Complete with exaggerated animation too. If one pays close attention, Claudette and Laurette even have _snot_ dripping down. They do this in the stage version too: their crying is even written in the script as "WAAAAAAAHHHHH!"
-   At the end of _Encanto_, Abuela Alma retells the story of her husband's death in all of its traumatic detail. Rather than the look of restrained sadness from the version at the start of the film, young Alma gives a Death Wail and collapses to the ground, sobbing with her whole body in a raw and unrestrained fashion.
-   Anna in _Frozen II_ does this when she and Elsa reunite near the end of the film. At one point, she nearly _blows her nose into her hand_.
-   Helen Parr in _The Incredibles_ displays it when she thinks her husband is having an affair. Special focus is given to the numerous pieces of toilet paper she has been perusing. It's toilet paper and not tissues because this happens at Edna Mode's home and, "There's no crying at E's place."
-   _Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch,_ Stitch blubbers unpleasantly when the map was destroyed.
    
    **Lilo:** We're sunk.
    
    **Stitch:** _\[glances at what's left of their map, his lip quivers, and he starts sobbing\]_ Uhhhh....wwwwwWWWWAHHHHHH _**HAH HUH HUH HAH HOO HAH!**_ **ANH, ANH,** AAH, URGH, WAGH! _\[An exasperated Lilo grabs him by the leg and drags him away\]_
    
-   _The Lion King (1994)_: Timon and Pumbaa bawl over "losing" Simba to his romance with Nala in the first film, and at emotional moments throughout the rest of the franchise. In _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_, Pumbaa even has snot bubbles coming out of his nose and drenches Zazu with his Tears of Joy during the happy ending.
-   _Make Mine Music_:
    -   In _Peter and the Wolf_, the hunters Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir burst out crying when it briefly looks like Peter has been eaten by the wolf.
    -   In the ending of "Casey at the Bat," Casey bursts into very undignified tears after striking out at a major baseball game.
    -   In _The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met_, Willie the Whale imagines himself starring in _Pagliacci_ and floods the orchestra pit with his whale-sized tears during "Vesti la giubba."
-   In _The Princess and the Frog_, Charlotte did this when she thought Naveen wouldn't come to her party, for comic effect.
-   Narrowly averted in _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_: In the scene where the dwarfs are crying over the seemingly dead Snow White, Dopey originally made a funny face that ruined the mood of the scene and made the test audience crack up, so it was cut. In the final version, he hides his face.
-   In _Turning Red_, the younger characters (especially Mei) usually weep like this when overwhelmed with emotion, sometimes even paired with Puppy-Dog Eyes and Ocular Gushers.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Every time Neytiri cries in _Avatar_.
-   _The Blair Witch Project_ features this. It makes the scene especially realistic.
    -   And ripe for many, _many_ parodies.
-   Helen in _Bridesmaids_ has this. Her rival Annie sees how flushed and snotty she looks and can't help but smile.
-   Marty in _Bully_ when he was telling Lisa about Bobby.
-   Megan in _But I'm a Cheerleader_, upon realizing that she is indeed a lesbian (as everyone else could already tell), goes into full hysterics, up to and including high-pitched sobs and drooling.
-   Nicolas Cage in both _Deadfall_ and Vampire's Kiss:
    -   In _Deadfall_ he openly bawls. He also has his tongue hanging out and his sobs sound like chuckling.
    -   In _Vampire's Kiss_ he _actually says_ "BOO HOO!". _Twice!_
    -   Nic does this to much, _much_ better effect in _Mandy (2018)_, after his titular girlfriend is brutally murdered by a cult. It should be silly because he's openly bawling and screaming in his tighty-whitey briefs while chugging vodka, but considering the circumstances, it totally works.
-   Christopher Eccleston is particularly good at this, and does so in _Jude_, _Flesh & Blood_ and in a scene that got cut from _The Second Coming_. Observe.
-   Pulled off beautifully by Stallone in _First Blood_.
    
    We were in this bar in Saigon and this kid comes up, this kid carrying a shoe-shine box. And he says "Shine, please, shine!" I said no. He kept askin', yeah, and Joey said "Yeah." And I went to get a couple of beers, and the box was wired, and he opened up the box, fucking blew his body all over the place. And he's laying there, he's fucking screaming. There's pieces of him all over me, just... like this, and I'm tryin' to pull him off, you know, my friend that's all over me! I've got blood and everything and I'm tryin' to hold him together! I'm puttin'... the guy's fuckin' insides keep coming out! And nobody would help! Nobody would help! He's saying, sayin' "I wanna go home! I wanna go home!" He keeps calling my name! "I wanna go home, Johnny! I wanna drive my Chevy!" I said "With what? I can't find your fuckin' legs! I can't find your legs!"
    
-   _The Fountain_. Tommy Creo breaks down after the death of his wife.
-   One of the best parts of _Funny People_ was when Seth Rogan's character just starts doing this in the middle of a crowded restaurant during dinner with Adam Sandler's character.
-   The hero of _Gladiator_ when he discovers that his wife and child are dead. There's even snot involved. This was an actor and director decision and invoked intentionally. And it totally works.
    -   The original plan for the scene was for him to do a normal discreet-few-tears-down-each-cheek dignified cry... but Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott agreed that what Maximus was seeing demanded (as Crowe put it) a "full-blown snot-fest".
-   _The Godfather_: Fredo after the Don is shot. Not your everyday Manly Tears, this is full-blown sobbing and sniveling, caused not only by the shocking, sudden onset of grief, but from the sheer humiliation of having failed to do anything to stop the assassination (he fumbled his gun at a critical moment).
-   Played for laughs with JP in _Grandmas Boy_. There were multiple strings of spit coming from his mouth, and his eyeliner was smudged as well.
-   _How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)_: After The Grinch’s heart grew three sizes he cried like this in warmth and remorse after he realized the true meaning of Christmas near the end of the movie.
-   _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_: Cedric Diggory's father, and for that matter, Harry himself. A case of Tropes Are Not Bad, because the scene mentioned is _agonizing._
-   Mike in _The Hole_ is in clear hysterics after he kills Geoff in a fit of rage.
-   In _The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2_, Katniss loses it when Prim's cat returns to the house. She screams and cries that Prim isn't coming back as she throws things at the cat.
-   In _The Impossible_, Ewan McGregor's character, Henry, breaks down in loud, uncontrollable sobbing as he tries to tell his father-in-law over the phone that his wife and older son are missing after the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami. He has to hang up because he simply can't pull himself together long enough to get the words out properly. (See also _Moulin Rouge!_ below – Ewan McGregor is good at this.)
-   _In Bruges_: the scene in the park when Ray breaks down and bawls into Ken's chest.
-   Belle is prone to this in _Knockout_, particularly after her father is shot and at the end when she wins the world lightweight boxing championship.
-   Stan Laurel was prone to the comedic version, particularly after being berated by Ollie.
-   _Love in the Villa_: After resigning herself to her situation, Julie breaks down crying on the couch, her speech illegible and her sobs squeaky. When an uncomfortable Charlie hands her a napkin, the nose-blowing she does are also loud and ungraceful.
-   _Les Misérables (2012)_:
    -   Anne Hathaway's performance of "I Dreamed a Dream".
    -   Eddie Redmayne's performance of "Empty Chairs At Empty Tables."
    -   Hugh Jackman's performance of "Valjean's Soliloquy."
-   _Little Women (1994)_ has Beth's undignified Tears of Joy when Mr. Laurence gives her his dead granddaughter's piano. She does it silently, but her face looks far from pretty, and she wipes her nose with her hand.
-   _The Martian_. In the tension of the pre-launch during his high-risk rescue, Mark Watney breaks down crying when he hears the voices of his crewmates for the first time in well over a year, knowing they've all come back to save him.
-   Played for laughs in _Mary Poppins_; the "I Love to Laugh" segment ends with Bert making what Dick Van Dyke referred to as his Stan Laurel face. (Van Dyke was a huge fan of Laurel.)
-   _Moulin Rouge!_'s Christian does this when Satine dies. Because it sounds almost like he's laughing hysterically, it potentially kills the mood. Justified (perhaps) in the director's commentary where it's suggested that only a completely devastated person cries like that because whether or not they sound silly is the _last_ thing they're concerned about.
-   _Murder by Death_. Sam Diamond and Tess Skeffington are locked in a room with a hidden, ticking Time Bomb.
    
    **Sam:** I got an idea. I don't know whether this is gonna work or not. Quick, turn around!  
    **Tess:** I'm turned, Sam.  
    **Sam:** Whatever you do, baby, don't turn back.  
    **Tess:** But Sam, if anything...  
    **Sam:** Do as I say, angel!  
    **Tess:** I will, Sam.  
    **Sam:** Good. Because I think... I'm gonna cry. _(starts sobbing pathetically offscreen)_
    
-   Spoofed in _The Naked Gun_, where Frank Drebin lets Nordberg's wife cry into his shoulder and winds up with a big wad of snot on his jacket.
-   Barbra in the remake of _Night of the Living Dead (1990)_. A very accurate depiction of hysterics. She's half laughing, half crying when Ben shakes her.
-   _Not Okay_:
    -   Danni's father does after she "returns", utterly relieved she's alive.
    -   Danni herself does this after Rowan confronts her about the deception, and gets told to leave. She breaks down crying messily in the elevator on her way out.
-   _The Parent Trap (1998)_:
    -   When Hallie reveals to Elizabeth who she really is, Martin breaks down in Tears of Joy. His sobbing makes Grandpa close the door to not ruin the mood of the reunion.
    -   Likewise, when Annie reveals herself, Chessy has a hard time keeping it together without revealing the secret when Nick comes in and asks her what's wrong.
-   At the end of _Rebel Without a Cause_, James Dean's character Jim does this after Plato is killed.
-   In _Reflections In A Golden Eye_, Marlon Brando's character collapses into some of the most pathetic crying ever caught on film after losing control of his wife's horse and then beating it with a branch in a fit of rage. It's in stark contrast to his other roles, where he sheds manly tears at worst.
-   Basically the last few minutes of _Reservoir Dogs_ is this, as a subversion of the awesome manliness, the film had up to that point.
-   In _Rocky III_, Rocky does some of this just after Mick dies.
-   Leonardo DiCaprio does this in _William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet_.
-   Likewise, in Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 _Romeo and Juliet_, both Leonard Whiting's Romeo and Olivia Hussey's Juliet cry this way.
-   In the film version of _Ronja the Robber's Daughter_, this is Matt's reaction to Bald Pete's death.
-   At the end of _Schindler's List_, Oskar Schindler does this as he says that he could have saved more Jews if he had sold his belongings (the blubbering grows from the repeated phrase "I could've gotten more...").
-   Cmdr. Shepard in _Sink the Bismarck!_, The Stoic after losing his wife in an earlier bombing raid and later his son's plane being shot down, and monofocused on sinking the marauding German battleship, finally breaks down weeping in his bathroom after getting a report that his son had been rescued.
-   Stevo in _SLC Punk!_ when Heroin Bob dies.
-   _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_: John Conner completely loses it when he realizes that, in order to prevent Judgement Day, his guardian, friend, and father figure will have to perform an Heroic Sacrifice. He is just a kid, though.
-   _¡Three Amigos!_. After the title characters realize that they aren't putting on a show but are facing a real bandit gang, they start crying and whining like babies.
-   Laura's honking in _Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me_.
-   During the climax of _The Truman Show_, Truman begins crying in frustration and defeat when he conquers his aquaphobia only to sail the boat he stole to escape directly into a wall, revealing to him Seahaven isn't an island at all and is, in fact, just a set encased in a large dome. Jim Carrey is a master of authentic-looking ugly tears.
-   _When Harry Met Sally..._: When Sally finds out her ex is getting married again, she calls Harry. Meg Ryan nails it perfectly. She weeps uncontrollably enough to be sympathetic but balances the pathos AND the comedy of the scene.
-   In _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, Roger blubbers inelegantly after he's told his wife is playing around. This scene is an almost exact remake of the opening from _Chinatown._
-   _The Wizard of Oz_:
    -   The Cowardly Lion is prone to this: for example, when Dorothy slaps his nose when they first meet, and out of fear when they're about to meet the Wizard.
    -   The guard on the Wizard's audience chamber does this out of sympathy for Dorothy: "I had an Aunt Em myself once!"

    Literature 

-   In her Memoirs, the Duchess of Abrantès characterized her late husband — General Junot — as being _extremely_ prone to this.
-   In _Amelia Takes Command_, Amelia fears doing this after she gets bullied, because, according to her, people tend to have chins that crinkle up or mouths that look like rubber bands when they cry. In the end, the bully, Hilary, dissolves into all-out bawling after Amelia finally tells her off. She's described as having "a rubber-band mouth _and_ a crinkly chin."
-   _Asperger Adventures_: Ben does this in the first scene of _Blue Bottle Mystery_ when Miss Browning-Lever yells at him for reasons he barely understands, then becomes so enraged that she breaks the ruler on his desk.
-   As described in _Aztec_, part of the ceremony to the rain god Tlaloc involves all the spectators doing this. First, the two young children who will provide the sacrifice are paraded around and shown off to the group. Then a priest makes the children cry, usually by pinching them. The onlookers all start weeping and wailing and beating their chests because it will bring rain during the upcoming rainy season.
-   In _The Belgariad_, Ce'Nedra sees Garion with another woman, spits poison at him, and runs off to cry. Polgara tracks her down to let her know that woman was his cousin and clean her up a bit because she does not look pretty after crying. Not the only time this observation is made: Also happens when she's trying to lead a war and gets hit with the enormity of the fact that most of the people she's just rallied to battle are going to die.
    
    -   And again in _The Mallorean_, after she has a period of deep depression and weeping over her baby's kidnapping:
    
    **Polgara**: "You really shouldn't cry in public, dear. You haven't the coloring for it."
    
-   _The Bible_: After twenty years of estrangement, Joseph cries uncontrollably at the moment of his reconciliation with his brothers.
-   _A Boy Made of Blocks_: When Alex arrives in Dan's flat after leaving his wife and son, he almost immediately starts crying hysterically, with snot bubbling out of his nose.
-   _Bud, Not Buddy_: Upon learning that Bud's mother was his daughter Angela, Herman Calloway retreats to his room and sobs uncontrollably on the bed.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_: In _The Silver Chair_, Jill Pole is doing this when the book opens. Also, young Digory Kirke in _The Magician's Nephew._ Both times, the author spends quite a bit of time on how unattractive it is.
-   In Jeramey Kraatz's _The Cloak Society_, Alex can tell Misty has been crying because her eyes are red and puffy.
-   In Robert E. Howard's _Conan the Barbarian_ story "Jewels Of Gwahlur" not exactly wise for an imposter goddess.
    
    _Wipe your face. A goddess doesn't cry like a whipped schoolgirl._
    
-   Scout in _Yoda: Dark Rendezvous_ is described as having a soaked sleeve and a slimy face while still sniffling after a bout of tears.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In Terry Pratchett's _Unseen Academicals_, Glenda's crying is explicitly described as not being like a romance heroine's.
    -   In _Raising Steam_, Harry King cries the fat, blubbery tears of a hard man who would never let anyone see them.
-   Invoked in Stephen King's _Dreamcatcher_ where one of the boys cries so hard snot drips out of his nose. Also happens to "Duddits", a mentally challenged boy with Disability Superpowers, when a group of bullies beat him up and force him to eat a dried dog turd.
    -   It happens at least twice to the title character in _Carrie_. Both times also involve dripping snot.
-   _The Dresden Files_: While the female characters are rarely weepy, on the times when they do cry, it is always described as incredibly unflattering. Of course, the protagonist being who he is, that only pisses him off even more. He's fully aware of this flaw, and is getting better about overcoming it. And Harry himself does not weep manfully — he curls into a ball of whatever misery has currently landed on him and sobs his heart out.
-   In _A Drowned Maiden's Hair_, phony psychics the Hawthorne sisters stage séances for grief-stricken customers. One of their easiest and most reliable marks is a man named Horace Burckhardt, who lost his wife Agnes to Death by Childbirth thirty years ago and always sobs hysterically while talking to "her." Hyacinth makes fun of him behind his back, calling him the Weeping Walrus and saying, "People shouldn't carry on like that unless they're good-looking."
-   _Eric, or Little by Little_: A group of boys, led by school troublemaker Brigson, pelts Mr Rose with breadcrusts. Mr Rose canes Brigson, who cries like a baby and rolls around on the floor yelling 'The devil—the devil—the devil!' The other boys are so disgusted by Brigson's show of cowardice that he goes from being the most popular boy in the lower forms to being scorned by everyone.
-   In Jane Yolen and Midori Snyder's _Except The Queen_, crying like this is one of the multiple indignities heaped on Serana by her exile.
-   In Dan Abnett's _Gaunt's Ghosts_ novel _Only In Death_, Ludd's tears leave his eyes red.
-   Hermione in the _Harry Potter_ books is prone to this. In the fourth book, she abruptly bursts into tears and hugs Harry and Ron when the two of them make up after a fight. In the fifth book, she pretends to do this to fool Umbridge. This adds a bit of Narm when you realize that about three pages pass of Hermione convincing Umbridge about the weapon in the forest - and she's supposedly got her arms covering her face pretending to sob the whole time. The movie naturally drops this from the scene.
    -   That said, the first part of the movie version of the seventh book has Hermione doing a _lot_ of blubbering when Bellatrix is torturing her for information.
-   In _Heart of Steel_, Mad Scientist Alistair Mechanus breaks down into this after getting his memories back, as he is forced to relive the Trauma Conga Line that led to his psychotic break and subsequent amnesia a decade before. Compounding things is that, due to his Trauma-Induced Amnesia, he still hasn't had time to properly process things, so the pain is still as fresh as if it happened yesterday.
-   From _Heralds of Valdemar_: When Winterhart breaks down, Amberdrake observes that her eyes are swollen and bloodshot, her nose a brilliant pink, she looks horrible — and he wants to hold her in his arms and protect her from the rest of the world.
-   _That Hideous Strength_: When Ransom is meeting with a restored Merlin, Merlin ends up 'blubbering' at one point when he realizes he may have no choice but to take on a suicidal mission. After Ransom orders him to Get a Hold of Yourself, Man!, they continue on as if nothing happened (essentially "it's out of my system, why focus on it?").
-   In Suzanne Collins's _The Hunger Games_, Katniss is afraid of this after she volunteers; it would make her look weak. After she shoots the apple out of the mouth of the Gamemakers' roast pig in anger and walks away undismissed, she sobs inelegant Tears of Remorse for fear they will harm her family over it and give her a bad score, meaning she will do poorly after she promised she would try to win.
    -   She does it again (complete with Lampshade Hanging) in "_Catching Fire_" when she thinks Peeta is dead.
-   Joan Foster, the narrator of _Lady Oracle,_ admits in the first chapter that she is prone to this sort of crying; her eyes get as red as "cooked tomatoes," her nose runs, she clenches her fists, snorts, and moans. "Decorous weeping was another of those arts I never mastered, like putting on false eyelashes."
-   Played for laughs with Margaret Twiss, courtesy of some amusing sound effects, in _A Leader in the Chalet School_:
    
    “B-but it was me!-hurp-hurp!-it was!" Margaret wept loudly, her words so mixed up with her sobs that none of the girls could make head or tail of what she was saying and even the Head, with all her experience, could gather only a little here and there. “I-I s-saw Miss A-andrews-hurp!-p-put the snake-hurp-hurp!-snake into the d-drawer and I never-hurp!-said anything-hurp-hurp!-even when the rest b-blamed Jack-hurp!-for it!-hurp-hurp-hurp! Wah-hah-hah!”
    
-   In Andy Weir's _The Martian_, astronaut Mark Watney gets stranded alone on Mars for months, without any means to communicate with Earth.

Once he sees the main antenna has moved, indicating successful contact, he goes back inside the Hab and breaks down sobbing in relief.

-   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians:_ In The Lightning Thief, the first of the series, Percy breaks down after seeing his beloved mother choked and kidnapped, sobbing and hoarsely calling out for her even though he knows she's gone, and at this point thinks she's dead. It drives home that heroic and apocalyptically powerful though he may be, Percy is also a love-starved little boy who just lost the only person who's always been there for him.
    -   In the sequel series, Piper _tries_ to invoke this, but since Aphrodite decided to bless her with beauty, beautiful she remains.

        My dismal sister! Couldst thou know
        
        The wretched home thou keepest!
        
        Thy brother, drowned in daily woe,
        
        Is thankful when thou sleepest;
        
        For if I laugh, however low,
        
        When thou'rt awake, thou weepest!
        
        -   And later, when he tries to cheer her up by inviting "three gay young dogs from town" for dinner
        
        "Hounds IN FULL CRY I like," said she:  
        (Oh how I longed to snub her!)  
        "Of fish, a whale's the one for me,  
        IT IS SO FULL OF BLUBBER!"

    Music 

    Role-Playing Games 

-   Manly Tears are not common in _Dino Attack RPG_. Instead, expect red eyes, runny noses, and uncontrollable sobbing. Hertz, Frozeen, and Rex are all victims of this trope.

    Theatre 

-   Rodolfo traditionally does this after Mimí's death at the end of _La Bohème_. This might be the reason for the above-mentioned _Moulin Rouge!_ example since that film draws considerable inspiration from this opera.
-   Another famous operatic tenor example is Canio in _Pagliacci_, at the end of his iconic aria "Vesti la giubba." The sobbing isn't called for in the libretto, but it's a firm tradition, and depending on the singer it can be very undignified. Thanks to Pop-Cultural Osmosis from film, TV, and cartoons, an inelegantly blubbering tenor in a clown suit is probably the main image that the title _Pagliacci_ evokes for most people.
-   _Hamilton:_ "Say No To This" indicates Maria Reynolds is not a pretty crier.
-   In _Pygmalion_ and _My Fair Lady_, Eliza cries this way, especially in the earlier scenes before she learns ladylike manners. In the opening scene, her crying when she thinks Higgins is a detective spying on her is written in the script as "Oh, boo—hoo—oo—" and Higgins calls it "detestable boohooing." In a later scene, he also tells her that when she cries she looks "as ugly as the very devil."

    Video Games 

-   Played for laughs in _Battleborn_ as Oscar Mike confesses his deepest feelings to Nova, the ship’s computer, thinking he’s talking to a personal diary. As he gets to the point of tears, Nova broadcasts to the ship about it with glee.
-   Splicers cry a _lot_ in _BioShock_. This is hardly surprising, given how badly they're broken. When they start crying, there's nothing elegant about it — it's full of sobbing and groaning, and it tends to last for quite some time.
-   _Brawl Stars_: A handful of Brawlers tend to do this in some of their losing voice lines. These include Lou, Lola, Cordelius and Mandy.
-   Heroes with afflictions in _Darkest Dungeon_ sometimes speak in this matter, with some of them going into sobbing fits depending on what affliction they have.
-   Queen Brahne while watching the play "I Want To Be Your Canary" in _Final Fantasy IX_. As the play is performed every year, she's likely just getting into the spirit of it (it's a tragedy). She pauses for a moment to wonder where her daughter has wandered off to before resuming bawling over the heroine's death.
-   Tidus in _Final Fantasy X_ does some very undignified crying when he discovers the truth about Yuna and the Final Aeon. His line near the end of the game "I hate you, Dad" is a little more dignified.
-   In _Fire Emblem: Awakening_'s Future Past 2 DLC Owain, the future son of Lissa goes into a sobbing fit upon being reunited with his mother. It gets to the point that he can barely speak properly as he chews himself out. Considering the one who's doing it, it's quite painful to read.
-   Zelda's crying in the Japanese version of _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ is extremely loud and inelegant-sounding, especially compared to the other versions.
-   _Like a Dragon_:
    -   _Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name_: At the end of the game, as a reward for his efforts Kiryu's government handler Hanawa gives him a tablet featuring hidden camera footage of the orphans he raised in his old life visiting his gravesite. Two of the orphans notice the camera and out of a belief that Kiryu is still alive give him an update on what they've been going on, causing him to weep profusely. It gets even worse when he's given a picture of a drawing by Haruka's son Haruto of him and the kids. Hanawa bitterly notes that the "reward" almost feels like a punishment of sorts.
    -   _Yakuza: Like a Dragon_; Ichiban spends most of the last half hour after the final boss fight bawling and begging Masato to pull a Heel–Face Turn and forget his ambitions. It almost works... then Masato's lackey guts him just as he comes to his senses.
-   Lost Odyssey features an example with Cooke and Mack mourning the loss of their mother... who also happens to be The Hero's daughter. (Long story. No, literally.) Cooke makes increasingly desperate calls for her mom and descends into incoherent wails.
-   In _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_, Hassel breaks down in tears whenever he's proud of someone. The game phonetically spells out his dialogue as he cries, implying that he's sobbing hard enough that he's hard to understand.
-   _Professor Layton and the Unwound Future_: "Now Luke, you know a gentleman never makes a scene in public." "I'm sorry, professor, but I'm not a gentleman yet!"
-   In _Puyo Puyo Tetris_, Ess is shown multiple times in the story mode making a rather melodramatic-looking blubbering face whenever she is sad.
-   _Sakuna Of Rice And Ruin_: When Sakuna is throwing herself on Lady Kamuhitsuki's mercy after the explosion in the Royal Garner, her face has undergone an Art Shift to be blobby.
-   In _The Spectrum Retreat_, after the flashback of Robin dying, you can hear Maddie's breakdown, and it's not pleasant at all.
-   In _Super Paper Mario_, Emotionless Girl Nastasia suddenly goes into a blubbering fit when she learns that Count Bleck is gone forever. She recovers her dignity with equal abruptness.
-   The four youngest kids in _Super Sized Family_ will outright bawl when they cry, as opposed to their older siblings, who have a more dignified cry. Notably, the younger ones are the only ones who cry with a sound effect; the older kids' crying is silent.
-   _Oxygen Not Included_: Duplicants with the Ugly Crier stress reaction will sit down and start blubbering all over the place if their stress peaks out, just being miserable in a very messy way until their stress goes down. This is apparently so unsightly that everyone witnessing this might get stressed out too and generally finds it demoralizing. On the plus side, it's free water for your colony.

    Visual Novels 

-   Kiyotaka Ishimaru from _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_ does this (complete with tears _and_ sweat) after his new friend Mondo Oowada is revealed as the murderer of Chihiro Fujisaki in Chapter 2 and he is executed at the end of the second trial. The scene is intensified in the anime version, where little puddles of tears are added to the effect.
    -   Himiko Yumeno from _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_, who normally doesn't emote very much, breaks down sobbing when she finally expresses her grief over the deaths of Angie and Tenko, the two people she was closest with, in chapter 3.
-   _Katawa Shoujo_: In Hanako's route when Hanako and Hisao climatically reconcile their feelings for one another with all the pain and loss both have experienced in their pasts. It is likely the player will be crying too, but for a very different reason.
-   In _A Little Lily Princess_, Lavinia cries this way on her route after Sara discovers a picture of Lavinia's Indian mother, thus uncovering Lavinia's most shameful secret- being half-Indian. Considering that Lavinia is usually rather proud, if temperamental, her breaking down like this says a lot about her emotional state.

    Webcomics 

-   _Achewood_: Ray Smuckles has blubbered on two separate occasions. Once when wearing arguing loafers that caused him to dance until he collapsed from exhaustion, and once when he was in the Volvo of Despair. "A BLOO BLA BLOO BLOO BLOOOO! BLOO BLOOOO! A BLOO BLA BLOOO!"

-   In _Manly Guys Doing Manly Things_ this is how the Commander reacts when he finds out his entire family is dead. This pisses off his superiors, who want him to become a brooding Anti-Hero (think Batman), and yell at him to do so. The Commander threatens to get a lawyer in response. (To top it off, the superiors were _lying_ about his family being dead.)

-   Miseng and Wangnan from _Tower of God_ after they failed the test to advance to the next floor.

-   This video by LittleKuriboh.
-   Elena Marquez in Boris' twin: episode 9 when she finds out that Boris has apparently been killing people. It doesn't sound like the typical "waaaaaaaaa-ah" you hear in Goanimate, it sounds like an actual woman crying.
-   _The Most Popular Girls in School_: In the Season 5 episode "Hansel and Gretel", Tanner cries like this through his photoshoot because Tristan has broken up with him. We even see tear streaks on his doll's face! When the commentators see this, they are understandably uneasy and depressed.

    Real Life 

-   Whatever else you may say about him, American President Richard Nixon loved his wife Pat and broke down at her funeral, sobbing openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony.
-   North Koreans think they have to follow and obey their leaders — even worship them. So when they die, they have to appear to openly mourn for them (read: wail and cry as if they really mean it) or else they will be imprisoned or worse. News coverage of the leader's followers once they had died has some people wondering if it's all fake or not for that matter.
    -   In 1994, when Kim Il-sung died, they did just that. News reporters, factory workers, tough soldiers and everyone else all pounded the pavement, wrung their fists, and wailed loudly.
    -   They did so likewise when Kim Jong-il died in December 2011. Again, it was mandatory (which make some viewers of footage of them inconsolably wailing think that they are feigning it).
    -   At the same time, such (seemingly) exaggerated emotion is a part of Korean culture, in the South as well as the North, and cannot wholly be put down to totalitarian repression.
-   In 1997, the death of Princess Diana precipitated some inelegant and graceless public weeping in Great Britain, which the more traditional half of the population found distasteful and depressing.
-   In Aztec society, weeping at appropriate times (such as after losing a battle, or when beseeching the gods for aid) was considered the sign of a pious and honorable individual.
    -   Similarly, in Europe in The High Middle Ages, it was surprisingly appropriate for a Knight in Shining Armor to weep copiously under certain circumstances, such as the Crusaders did when they finally reached Jerusalem in 1099.
    -   The ancient Babylonians had a New Year's festival called Akitu, where the high priest customarily dragged the king by the ear and slapped him in the face as hard as he could. If the king burst into tears, then he was still in the gods' favor. If not, then he clearly wasn't fit to rule.
-   The Irish and Scottish tradition of keening (singing a lament combined with wailing) over the body during the funeral procession and at the burial site is the human equivalent of the death wail of the Banshee, or _bean-sídhe_ ("the woman of the fairy folk''), who is a guardian spirit of the old Gaelic families; she wails and cries through the night to warn "her" family that one of them will soon die.
    -   "Keen" comes from the Gaelic verb "caoin", meaning "to cry/weep, to mourn" and its active article "caoineadh" ("weeping", "crying", "wailing") can also be translated as "elegy/lament". The caoineadh itself was often composed and performed in an improvised way, with at least one keening woman (bean chaointe) hired to lead the rest of the mourners, who generally joined with the chorus. Singing the caoineadh itself was not uncontrolled sobbing so much as a controlled melody and generally consisted of stock poetic elements (the genealogy of the deceased, praise for the deceased, emphasis on the sorrow of those left behind, etc.) set to vocal lament.
-   Brazilian fans' reactions to the 2014 World Cup semi-finals match between Germany and host country Brazil, or for short, 7-1.

-   The entire population of New York City cried like this on 9/11 after the World Trade Center collapsed.
-   After news broke of Michael Jackson's death on June 25th, 2009, fans of his work were extremely emotional as seen in various news coverages and video uploads between June 25th and June 26th. Notably memorial gatherings at The Apollo Theater and Jackson's Star at the Hollywood Walk of Fame where some female fans were bawling over his death. The same occurred during his memorial services on July 7th where some Jackson fans were weeping at various moments.
-   In countries such as Italy and Mexico, grown men are very open with their feelings and their love, so they are known to weep freely whenever the occasion calls for it (the ending of _La Bohème_ for Italians, the loss of a soccer match for Mexicans, etc.).
-   During the tribute show for Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit can be seen weeping uncontrollably every time he's on camera, and his heartfelt tribute to Eddie during the show ended with him breaking down into a sobbing fit. The two were Heterosexual Life-Partners, and many believe that Eddie's death was the beginning of the end for Chris.
