**Gamora:** Did you do it?  
**Thanos:** Yes.  
**Gamora:** What did it cost?  
**Thanos:** _...Everything._

Bob takes things too far, either in his quest for power, revenge, or even just to win a battle. After it's all said and done, he or Alice have to ask 'was it really worth it?' In this case, it's actually a valid question, possibly for a number of reasons. Maybe killing his opponent made him just like them. Maybe to win a friendly duel, he had to shatter his best friend's weapon (or worse, shatter his best friend!) In any case, what Bob's done raises serious moral questions for him, and the answer isn't necessarily "Hell yeah, it was Worth It!"

Note that the question doesn't necessarily even have to be asked, nor must it be after the deed's been done.

Not to be confused with What the Hell, Hero?, which is about the character being called out for flat-out evil things. If someone wins a battle, but accidentally kills their friend's sister in the process, it's this. If they intentionally do so, and are called out for it, it's that. Bob may justify his actions with "I Did What I Had to Do." If Bob decides it's not worth it after all, but only _after_ the fact, it's My God, What Have I Done?.

If the 'it' was something like a Heroic Sacrifice, this may cause a Bittersweet Ending. After all, the Big Bad may be dead, but so is Bob, and that's no cause for celebration.

A subtrope of Armor-Piercing Question and Pyrrhic Victory. If a character's actions or victory eventually result in him being bored because of it, then you have a case of Victory Is Boring. Compare And Then What?.

-   In _Afro Samurai Resurrection,_ after Afro kills Shichigoro in front of his adopted son Kotaku, _the show itself_ compares him to the villain of the first season, with flashbacks to Afro's father being killed. _Afro_ makes the comparison at the end, leaving the Number 2 headband in Kotaku's hands with a quiet "Whenever you're ready."
-   In the _Android Kikaider: The Animation_ OVA ending, Jiro gains the full spectrum of human emotions, in a sense achieving his goal of becoming human.

Referring back to the motif of Pinocchio, Jiro wonders if the puppet was actually happy after gaining his dream.
-   The ending of _Chrono Crusade_ is a great example of this applied to a Heroic Sacrifice. The manga seems to answer: "Yes, it was worth it." The anime _seems_ to agree with the manga, but acknowledges the severity of Rosette's sacrifice to a greater extent.
-   _Dragon Ball Super_: During the Future Trunks Saga, Goku Black and Future Zamasu embark on a crusade to kill all mortals in The Multiverse. In the process, they slaughter all of the other gods in Future Trunks' timeline to prevent them from interfering, fuse together to get an edge on Goku and friends, and finally undergo a Power-Upgrading Deformation in his rage. Gowasu even ponders over this, wondering if Zamasu will really be happy once his crusade is completed.
    
    **Gowasu**: Zamasu seeks beauty. Yet, look at his body. It's distorted by hatred and rage. I wonder, is that really the result he craved? A broken, misshapen god alone in a vacant cosmos. How fulfilled will he be then?

He proceeds to ask the President what he thinks about all the death that just occurred, and when the President confirms his thoughts by offering nothing but generic, obviously rehearsed platitudes, Snake deliberately gives him the wrong tape to play at his previous conference to ensure he humiliates himself in front of the whole world.

    -   The ending of the original _Godzilla (1954)_ has the main surviving humans wondering if using the Oxygen Destroyer was worth the Heroic Sacrifice of Dr. Serizawa and worrying that another Godzilla may appear.
    -   Given that _Godzilla vs. Destoroyah_ featured _two_ Godzillas, a technology extremely close to the Oxygen Destroyer (Serizawa sacrificed himself to keep something like that from happening), and a monster created by the use of the original Destroyer, the answer seems to be "No."

Angier, on the other hand, is totally unrepentant, even as he dies as a direct result of his actions.
-   _Spy Game_:
    
    -   The stories told in it about the efforts of one long-time CIA agent, Nathan Muir, and his protege Tom Bishop, show the extreme lengths and sacrifices they will go to accomplish their objectives — the film itself is very much the "stale beer" flavor of Spy Fiction (as opposed to "martini" flavored glamorous ones like James Bond).
    -   Implied and lampshaded by Bishop in the debriefing of a mission in Beirut to assassinate a terrorist leader, where after going to such great lengths to get the target's family doctor to apply a poison to him during a check-up (including persuading him to turn on him in the first place by bringing up his murdered family and Bishop rushing him through war-torn streets to get him to his appointment at an apartment building before they lose track of him) only for Muir to call in their back-up plan...a huge truck bomb that blows up the whole apartment and kills everyone there. The objective was accomplished, but...

    Literature 

-   In Ben Counter's _Warhammer 40,000_ Horus Heresy novel _Galaxy in Flames_, Abaddon expected to feel "savage joy" at Loken and Torgaddon's deaths. Instead, he just feels empty. Though his reaction to Aximund's My God, What Have I Done? and Tears of Remorse is that he needs to be watched.
-   In Chris Roberson's Imperial Fists novel _Sons of Dorn_, Captain Taelos knows, objectively, that sacrificing the scouts as a distraction was a sound move, but he finds the cost very bitter.
-   In the Dale Brown novel _Wings of Fire_, Patrick McLanahan says this after the Night Stalkers receive very large paychecks for the mission where Paul was killed and Wendy went missing.
-   At the end of Larry Niven's _Ringworld's Children_, Louis Wu has lost his son and the woman he was in love with to the depths of space, never to be seen again.

-   In _The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas_, each individual must decide whether Utopia Justifies the Means — and with good reason, too.
-   This is a running theme in Iain M. Banks's _The Culture_ series. The Culture fought a war with the Idirans in _Consider Phlebas_. The ethics and ramifications of the war were still being discussed up to _The Hydrogen Sonata_.
    -   In the epilogue of _Consider Phlebas_, it's mentioned that Perosteck Balveda put herself in suspended animation along with millions of others until the Culture could statistically 'prove' that the war had been morally justifiable; e.g. enough years of peace had passed to show that more would have died from the Idiran expansion and occupation than were killed during the war to stop them. She's duly revived when this happens, but then kills herself a short time later, clearly feeling that it was not really worth it.
-   _The Bible_: Mark 8:36
    
    For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
    
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_. As detailed in Archmaester Gyldayn's Histories is "The Dance of the Dragons". Over a century before the events of the main story (ASOIAF starts in 298 and TDOTD took place in 129-131), Viserys I wanted his daughter Rhaenyra to succeed ahead of his son from a later marriage despite the inheritance laws of most of Westeros favoring sons before daughters. However, after his death, his son was crowned Aegon II, leading to "The Dance of the Dragons", a major civil war in which most of the dragons and Targaryens were killed, including both claimants. Rhaenyra's son Aegon III then became King and shortly after this, the last of the line from Viserys' last marriage died out. Aegon suffered from depression, partially from seeing the death of his mother, and the dragons died out during his reign. To cap it all off, the stigma against females inheriting the Iron Throne remained, as when Aegon's sons died without issue, his brother Viserys II took the throne ahead of Aegon's daughters (Aegon and Viserys could claim male line inheritance due to their father being Viserys I's brother Daemon).
-   In Richard Holdstock's (as Richard Kirk) _Raven, Swordmistress of Chaos_ stories, the Framing Device of each novel takes place After the End, an elderly man with a mutilated hand and an old golden sword that's beyond the current age to make, wanders into a barely surviving settlement and in return for hospitality he tells a tale of Raven, the woman who ended the current age and unleashed the Age of Chaos. The Age of Chaos was to sweep away the previous age of tyrants and supernatural horrors that threaten humanity. It also saw the end of island of sorcerers who protect humanity at her hands and the falling out between Raven and her lover/companion Spellbinder. At the final book, the elderly man (who's an aged Spellbinder) laments the primitive conditions of this new age and wonders "Was it really worth it?" to the missing and presumed dead Raven (answer is yes... our world eventually emerges from their Age of Chaos).

-   In an episode of _Malcolm in the Middle_, a series of ever-escalating pranks lands Malcolm and Reese in the hospital after they tied in Game of Chicken with go-cars. When they're brought home, Hal grounds Malcolm and tells him to cancel the plans he had for his birthday. As Malcolm and Reese attempt to start another fight, Lois asks them what they remember doing on past birthdays, only for them to sadly remember not having any birthday parties because one did something to the other to get grounded. Lois then asks them if their desire to get revenge for whatever little indiscretion was done to them is worth having nothing but miserable memories on what should be a happy occasion. To drive the point home, to apologize for missing Dewey's solo performance in the school play, Hal gives him Malcolm's birthday present, a rare and expensive, comic book. Dewey takes it and the video game they gave him, and wishes Malcolm a happy birthday as he and Reese do menial work around the house.
-   In _Merlin_ Morgana has a dream of the far-distant future, one that implies that both she and Arthur die on the battlefield. She reaches for Merlin standing above her, who asks her: "Is this really what you wanted, Morgana?" Oddly, when these events play out in real-time, no such question is asked of her.
-   The _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ "Hell's Grannies" sketch, as a reporter addresses the viewers while walking on a sidewalk:
    
    **Reporter:** The whole problem of these senile delinquents lies in their complete rejection of the values of contemporary society. They've seen their children grow up to be accountants, stockbrokers, and even sociologists, and they begin to wonder if it is really all...(_he suddenly disappears in a manhole; two grannies replace the cover and scamper away_)
    
-   _The Professionals_. In "Blind Run", CI5 is assigned to protect an incognito Arab dignitary from an army of assassins. CI5 chauffeur Charlie gets shot through the lung, and wants assurance from Bodie that the man they were protecting was important so his death will mean something. Bodie can only urge him not to die as he has no idea himself.
-   The pilot episode of _Stargate Atlantis_ ends with Sheppard asking Weir if the hundred or so people he saved were really worth reawakening the Wraith.
-   _Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip_ episode "The Christmas Show":
    
    **Danny Tripp:** Was sleeping with him for that information really worth it?
    
-   Given the nature of _Survivor,_ which requires contestants to backstab and eliminate almost every other contestant then somehow convince a jury of defeated players to vote them Sole Survivor, this is a very common question at Final Tribal Council. Generally, the correct answer is "Yes," because a jury is more likely to respect a player who owns their game over someone being wishy-washy.
-   In the series finale of _Veep_, Selina throws Gary, the man who stuck by her through thick and thin, to the feds to save herself; bans gay marriage (which includes her own daughter's) to win votes which alienates Catherine forever; drives away all her few supporters and is basically alone when she returns to the Oval Office. At first, Selina, a massive narcissist, thinks it was worth it...but it turns out her ultimate legacy is to lose her next election to her main rival, followed by her supposed idiot handler becoming a much more successful President after that and is nothing more than a historical footnote remembered at all for her bad choices. As the final topper, when Selina dies at 74, not only does barely anyone she knows show up for her funeral but the networks immediately cut away at word Tom Hanks has passed away.
-   _The X-Files_, a Myth Arc episode "Redux II": Agent Scully is dying of cancer and her brother Bill accuses Agent Mulder that it's his fault, summarizing and ridiculing his quest for the truth and uncovering the conspiracy as search for "little green men".
    
    **Bill Scully**: I've already lost one sister to this quest you're on, now I'm losing another. \*struggles to hold back tears\* Has it been worth it? To you, I mean. Have you found what you've been looking for?  
    **Mulder**: No...  
    **Bill Scully**: No. You know how that makes me feel?
    

    Music 

-   Cher: "Strong Enough":
    
    And I hear your reasons why  
    Where did you sleep last night?  
    And was she worth it  
    Was she worth it?
    
-   Sabaton: What's the Price of a Mile?
-   Eric Bogle's song about World War I "And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda". As the old man sits on his porch, watching the veterans march past every ANZAC Day, he muses:
    
    The young people ask, "What are they marching for?" and I ask m'self the same question.
    
    -   His other famous song, "The Green Fields of France", has the words:
        
        Did you really believe, when you answered the call,  
        Did you really believe that this war would end war?  
        For the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain,  
        The killing and dying were all done in vain,  
        For Willie MacBride, it all happened again,  
        And again, and again, and again, and again.
        
-   Taylor Swift asks the question in "Should've Said No".
    
    I can't resist  
    Before you go, tell me this:  
    Was it worth it?  
    Was she worth this?
    
-   Lazlo Bane's "I'm No Superman" (Yes, that one) talks about personal sacrifices people make to succeed professionally, and asks:
    
    You've crossed the finish line  
    Won the race but lost your mind  
    Was it worth it, after all?
    
-   Queen's "Was It All Worth It?", is essentially this trope as a song.
    
    Was it all worth it?  
    Giving all my heart and soul and staying up all night  
    Was it all worth it?  
    Living breathing rock n'roll, a godforsaken life  
    Was it all worth it? Was it all worth it?  
    All these years
    
    -   But ultimately, at the end of the song Freddie proclaims _"Yes, it was a worthwhile experience!"_

    Video Games 

-   In _Arc the Lad 2_'s ending, Arc and Kukuru are dead, along with much of humanity. Elc is left to question why the hell he even bothered.
    
    **Elc:** "It makes me wonder what we were fighting for. Arc died, and for what? So we could inherit this desolate and hopeless future? We didn't stop the world from ending, we survived it. And now we are left with nothing.
    
-   Glenn and Janus from _Chrono Trigger_, in BOTH directions.
-   At the end of _Dragon Age II_, if you side with the Templars, and your sister Bethany is in the Circle, you have the option to stand up for her alone after killing her teacher and most of her friends. If you defer to Meredith, her last words are "I hope this was all worth it, sister/brother." Then Meredith runs her through.
-   In _Fable_, after you kill Jack of Blades, and have the opportunity to get the Sword of Aeons, your sister gives you a short speech, asking if striking her down would be worth it for the power. It's up to the player whether it is or isn't. Canonically, you don't kill her. She's the same Theresa as the one in various later entries. Of course, with the expansion it isn't worth it at all unless you're already cartoonishly evil, as refusing to kill Theresa results in a short sidequest to gain an equally powerful sword.
-   _Final Fantasy Tactics_: After manipulating and backstabbing his way to the top, Delita is king over a land that finally has peace after a _decades_ long war... But his 'idiot' friend who stayed true to his "be manipulated as long as I get to kill and save who I choose", killed an archangel and became an urban legend, while's he's reduced to asking this question after executing his now angry / paranoid wife who tried to shank him.
    
    "Ramza, what did you get? I got this."
    
-   _Final Fantasy X_ poses this question when Tidus fades from existence after the heroes defeat the big bad. They decide that it was indeed worth it, but Yuna's regret over the situation has a big effect on the sequel.
-   In _Final Fantasy XIV_, the _Shadowbringers_ 5.3 story boss's theme for Elidibus, aka the Warrior of Light has this in the lyrics in his theme song, "To the Edge," describing the war the Warrior of Darkness has had with Elidibus as well as the Ascians.
-   At the end of the _Frostpunk_ "New Home" scenario, if the player adopted morally questionable laws, the epilogue will question whether the city went too far, and that Order or Faith were abused. "Was this city worth it?"
-   At the end of _God of War III_, Kratos finally gets his revenge having killed everyone who ever wronged him...but by that point he realizes just how much of his misery was his own fault. He also finally notices the devastation he wrought upon the world during his campaign for vengeance and he's been changed enough to actually give a damn about it.
-   During the climax of _Kingdom Hearts III_, major recurring villains Ansem and Xemnas are finally Killed Off for Real. The former admits his heart wasn't even in the Final Battle and he's been suffering from clinical depression ever since he figured out that he didn't stand a chance this time around. The latter (who Sora actually invokes this trope to nearly word for word), confesses that he now regrets being such a Bad Boss to his underlings that none of them are left to help him (nor would they want to), and that for all his work to gain his own heart, the pain of loneliness wasn't worth it.
-   At the end of _Makai Kingdom_, Seedle sarcastically asks Zetta if becoming the strongest Overlord was worth his former pupil and lover Salome slowly and willingly killing herself by feeding him all of her Mana energy.
-   Shepard (as in you, the player) from _Mass Effect 2_ can throw this at Mordin, asking him accusingly if upgrading the genophage, a thousand-year-old bioweapon which reduced the fertility of the Proud Warrior Race Guy, was really worth it. For the record, he says yes. Though by the time of _Mass Effect 3_, his answer has changed to an emphatic no.
    -   Shepard also gets confronted by a human reporter with a distinctly anti-alien bias, who demands to know if spending human lives to save the Council in the previous game was worth it. Shepard's responses consist of either completely flooring the reporter by telling her she's disrespecting the dead and their sacrifice, or flooring her with a fist to the face.
-   All but spelled out by _NieR_'s endings A and C, as Nier tries to enjoy his life with Yonah, having sacrificed so much for her in the former, and mourns Kainé's death in the latter. _Heavily_ implied to the player in Ending D.
-   _Persona 5_: After escaping from the Phantom Thieves' second attempt to cooperate with them, Haru asks Morgana if he's really adamant on not going back with them. This shows that she's starting to have second thoughts about their collaboration.
    
    **Morgana**: Hmph, serves them right!
    
    **Haru**: Are you sure that's what you wanted?
    
-   _Portal_ has GlaDOS ask "Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it? Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break so far is my heart." However, she is asking it in the context of attempting to save her own skin (figuratively speaking) from a test subject who has gone Off the Rails and is trying to destroy her. It isn't until the second game that we find out that Chell's actions may have inadvertently made things much, much worse.
-   In Blue's story in _SaGa Frontier_, after killing Kylin for the gift for Space magic, Mei-Ling asks "All this for the Gift?" A very valid question, as apparently, Kylin maintains a paradise for all children that exists which gets destroyed on his death.
-   In _Saints Row: The Third_ the player is given two options at the end: go after Killbane or rescue Shaundi, who is about to be killed in a terrorist attack STAG had set up to blame the Saints on. Choose the former and you get the bad (good?) ending, where Shaundi dies, the Saints are blamed as terrorists, the Boss is asked if it was worth it (s/he can't answer) and STAG attempts to destroy Steelport during her funeral, then the Saints basically go terrorist when they fight the army off.
-   _Shadow of the Colossus_: To explain it would ruin the game, though the feeling does stand over every victory over a Colossus as well, with the possible exception of Malus.
-   In _Soul Nomad_, we have the Demon Path ending where Revya destroys the world. After the deed is done, you get one last line to read: _It doesn't matter. It was fun_.
-   This is pretty much the entire theme of _Uncharted 4: A Thief's End_:
    -   Nate and brother Sam find Libertalia, the legendary "pirate utopia" created by Henry Avery, Thomas Tews and other captains. They find it all in ruins as it turns out the entire thing was all a huge con to scam colonists out of their money and gold. The populace rose up in revolt and the pirates put them down. The pirate lords then fought among themselves so Avery and Tews poisoned the lot of them for the treasure...then ended up killing each other for gold neither could possess so Libertalia turned into a mass graveyard.
    -   Rafe spent years hunting the treasure and even having a mercenary group on his side as he's willing to do what it takes to get the treasure. He ends up completely losing it at the end to duel Nate inside a _burning ship_ and meets an Ironic Death being crushed by a pile of gold.
    -   On his quest, Nate finds notes and remains from the grandson of one pirate, out to find the treasure for his family honor. It soon becomes clear the quest consumed the man to the point of him willing to let his crew die so they abandoned him. Just before the climax, Nate finds his skeleton with a note to his beloved wife where he seems to realize, too late, how his quest ruined him and his final line is "forgive me."
    -   In flashbacks, Nate and Sam meet Evelyn, a woman who had been a Lara Croft style explorer making great finds. She dedicated her life to various hunts and searches to the point that she couldn't even attend her husband's funeral because she was abroad. Their son never forgave her for that and cut off all ties. In the end, Evelyn is a lonely old woman living in a mansion of treasures that she refuses to sell off and is only found after her death because of the police showing up just after the brothers had been there.
    -   The whole adventure clearly affects Nate as he realizes a life of nothing but treasure hunting leads to nothing good. He and wife Elena buy up a salvage company so they can go on legal adventures. In a Time Skip finale, it's shown the two are very successful with a record of historical finds and consider their daughter, Cassie, their greatest treasure.
    -   It's all summed up when Nate finds himself in the hold of Avery's ship loaded with gold but also on fire as the culmination of a quest that has claimed countless lives. He says the trope verbatim as he wanders about.
-   _Darksiders II_ indicates that Death has been asking himself this question ever since he lead the Horsemen into betraying and murdering the rest of the nephilim in order to save mankind and all of Creation from their conquest, culminating in him killing their leader/his oldest brother Absalom and imprisoning the nephilim's souls into an amulet but refusing to destroy it out of guilt. It says something that easily _thousands_ of years later he's still trying to decide either way. Judging by how he ultimately sacrifices said souls and himself to revive humanity and absolve his brother War of his falsely-accused crime of killing them, however, it seems he finally decided the answer was "yes."
-   In _L.A. Noire_, detectives Cole Phelps and Stefan Bekowsky ask Adrian Black as much when they bust him for his ridiculous attempt at faking his own death just so he can run away from his unhappy marriage and into the arms of his mistress.
    
    **Phelps:** Why not just come clean with her, Black? Why the melodrama?
    
    **Black:** I thought it would be easier.
    
    **Phelps:** No, it just got a whole lot harder. Adrian Black — you're under arrest for conspiracy and fraud. We'll see what the DA has to say about wasting police resources on a wild goose chase like this.
    
    **Bekowsky:** You're gonna lose your wife, lose your job and probably end up in the big house. I hope she was worth it, Adrian.
    
-   At the end of _Resident Evil 5_, Chris Redfield has this little monologue, once he finally takes down Wesker for good:
    
    "More and more I find myself wondering if it's all worth fighting for. For a future without fear?" _(looks at Jill and Sheva and smiles)_ "Yeah, it's Worth It."
    
-   In the _Revenged_ ending of _Henry Stickmin - Completing the Mission_, Henry, after being betrayed by the Toppat Clan's former leader, Reginald, is upgraded with cybernetics and decides to seek revenge on them. He manages to defeat the Right-Hand Man and Reginald before bringing down their airship on the launch site for their rocket, making it unlikely the group will ever recover. However, thanks to his fights and a shot in the back from Reginald, Henry is too injured to escape the crashing airship. As he lays dying, Reginald asks him if taking down the clan was really worth it. Considering Henry only manages to just limp away from the crash site and collapse against a rock before quietly dying himself, it wasn't.
    
    **Reginald:** _\*cough\*_ Well... you got us. _\*cough\*_ Was it... worth it?
    
-   Darth Sion in _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_ is "alive" thanks to the Sith ability to draw power from pain. He is in such utter agony that he can keep his body together, despite the fact that it should be falling apart just from moving. The Exile can't kill him, since any strike she makes will simply empower him to keep living. She can only ask him if living in utter agony is worth it. He decides that it is not.

_Virgo Versus the Zodiac_: In the Fixed Ending, Virgo wonders if her quest to bring back the Golden Age and rule over it was worth everyone she killed, including her friends. She also wonders if it was worth losing Pisces, who was killed by Scorpio as revenge for Virgo killing Taurus. She then concludes that Pisces must still be alive out there somewhere despite there being evidence to suggest otherwise, and becomes determined to find her.

-   _RWBY_: Corsac and Fennec Albain pulled the strings to have Adam take over the White Fang and kill Sienna Khan to advance their own goals, and carried out his orders to assassinate Blake's parents. In the end, all they manage to achieve is getting Fennec killed, getting Corsac arrested, and turning all of Menagerie against the White Fang. When Saber Rodentia - Ghira's bodyguard - asks Corsac this very question as he's being taken away, Corsac just hangs his head, indicating that no, it wasn't worth it.
    -   Neo manages to make Ruby undergo ascension, which will cause Cessatation Of Existence... and then she finally realizes _everyone_ who ever loved her or wanted to do great things alongside her is dead. Even though she has everything - revenge after six seasons, and enough power to make the Ever After her own paradise - she's forced to face the fact that she's still the sheltered little girl who couldn't lift a finger against her neglectful parents without Torchwick to guide her. All that power and no shred of ambition or support to back it up. Then it _definitely_ stops being worth anything when the Curious Cat uses her unleashed mental trauma to forcefully infest her brain and take over completely.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Girl Genius_, Klaus's attitude to the pain he suffered getting to the window, and the real risk that doing so paralysed him for _life_, it would still be worth it after seeing his son pull off that.
-   In _Kill Six Billion Demons_, the Demiurge, Maya, derided her mentor's moral lessons as weak and abandoned her family to be slaughtered by warlords so that she could become one of them. Her career as a Myopic Conqueror was highly successful, and by stepping on the corpses of the thousands of innocent lives she herself ended, she became one of the most important figures in the multiverse. But no matter how much she pillaged, her mentor's assertion that she had already lost kept bugging her. In the end, her mentor's Armor-Piercing Question made her realize that it wasn't. If she had stayed a humble noodle vendor, she would have spent those days living a happier life. While that life would have been a short one, with her dying at the hands of a warlord, her thousands of victims would have been spared.
-   In _A Miracle of Science_, Mad Scientists are seemingly asked this a lot. In a less-than-coherent explanation to his girlfriend, Dr. Haas quotes from the Bible passage above: "What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Well, he profits by the entire world, for starters." But despite all that, it's interesting to note that Dr. Haas never harms or deliberately endangers a civilian, even when this costs him a great opportunity to take out the protagonists. Apparently some things are _not_ Worth It to him.
-   In _Penny and Aggie_, the ambitious, slick, social-climbing Stan wins the election for class president (important to him for his college applications), but at the cost of the only serious relationship he'd ever had. When Aggie tells him he'd better be ready to face the consequences of choosing "power over love and friendship," he responds sadly, "I kinda have to be...don't I?"

    Web Original 

-   _Worm_
    -   Taylor becomes The Unfettered in pursuing the defeat of Jack Slash and his Slaughterhouse Nine in order to prevent the prophecized end of the world, going so far as to shoot a child held by Jack that could have caused the end (though to be fair, said child might've been trapped in an And I Must Scream state with no way to be saved). In the end, though, after she ultimately fails, she questions whether it was worth it and decides that it wasn't.
    -   At the end of the story, Contessa asks Taylor if she feels that the actions she resorted to to stop Scion were worth it. Even though she was successful this time, Taylor feels it wasn't worth it. She doesn't regret saving the world, but she wishes she could have found another way to do it.

-   _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_ ends this way for Billy/Doctor Horrible. He defeats Captain Hammer and is admitted to the Evil League of Evil, but it came at the cost of accidentally murdering his love interest in the process of defeating Captain Hammer. (And her last words were "Captain Hammer will save us", to twist the knife further.) The final shot shows a downtrodden Billy looking at the camera, hinting the answer was 'no'.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   Firelord Sozin asks himself at the end of his life if making the world a better place by spreading Fire Nation culture was really worth the genocide of the Air Nomads, the deaths of thousands of both his people and those of the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes in the war, and betraying Avatar Roku, his best friend as he was growing up, leaving him to die when he could have saved him. He somberly concludes that it was not.
    -   Sozin's great-grandson, Zuko, spends the entire first half of Season 3 asking himself this question. After three long years, he's finally welcomed back to the Fire Nation, has his father's approval, and pretty much everything he wanted all along. The only thing he had to do was betray his uncle who had given everything for him. After much soul-searching, he comes to the same conclusion Sozin did. The big difference is Zuko has the opportunity to make things right and he takes it.
-   When Hemlock Holmes asks Dick Tracy if it was worth the trouble he went through to rescue the Retouchables from Stooge Viller and Mumbles:
-   In _The Fairly OddParents!_ episode "Timmy's 2D House of Horrors", Timmy Turner lets Vicky and her family's house destroyed as payback for all the abuse he got from Vicky over the years. Vicky and her family then move into the Turners' house and Timmy is literally thrown out of the house and forced to sleep in a doghouse in the cold rain and his food gets confiscated to make room and board for Vicky.
-   _Family Guy_: In the episode "Wasted Talent," Lois, desperate to beat her snobby rival Alexis Radcliffe in a piano competition, discovers that Peter is a piano virtuoso when drunk and thus enters him in the competition, keeping him constantly wasted in the process. Lois does indeed win first place, but finds it a hollow victory, openly acknowledging that she put Peter's health in jeopardy for her own selfish need to win.
-   Macbeth in _Gargoyles_
    -   He uses Revenge as the 'it': "Revenge is a dish best eaten cold. And I have waited nine hundred years for this meal." However, Goliath points out to him and his nemesis Demona that every time either of them has attempted to get revenge, it only made their lives worse. "What profit vengeance?" has been described by producer Greg Weisman as one of his favorite themes.
    -   Subverted when it's revealed in "City of Stone" that his true goal isn't really revenge. He knows his life is a wreck because of his pursuit of revenge, and he just wants to end it. It's just a bonus that he can only die if he and Demona kill each other.
-   A Subversion in _Hot Wheels: Battle Force 5_ during the second season finale "Unite And Strike!" Krytus asks Sage if it was worth freezing the entire Red Sentient civilization just to stop his multiversal conquest. Sage's response is that Krytus was such a threat to not only the Blue Sentients but the entire multiverse that she had no choice but to resort to her Nuclear Option. Krytus responds that she was absolutely right, not that he cares.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_
    -   The villain Discord does this to _himself_ in the episode "Keep Calm and Flutter On". As he taunts Fluttershy for believing in him, he asks if she really thought he'd give up his World of Chaos for her friendship. As soon as he says it, he realizes the answer is: yes, he is willing to give it up for her.
    -   _The Cutie Remark Part 2_ has Twilight perform a nonverbal version of this to Starlight Glimmer to stop her Make Wrong What Once Went Right revenge plan: she grabs onto her after the latest change Starlight made and drags her back to the Bad Future the change created (which was the _worst_ one seen so far) in hopes showing her the consequences of her revenge would convince her to stop. While it takes time to sink in fully, Starlight's expression then and her demeanor after her Heel–Face Turn makes it clear that no, it wasn't worth it at all.
-   _South Park_:
    -   In the episode "Casa Bonita", Cartman effectively holds Butters hostage for over a week in order to take his place at Kyle's birthday celebration, which is being held at the eponymous establishment. In the final scene, a cop asks Cartman if it was worth making the town panic, alienating his friends, and going to juvenile hall. Cartman dreamily responds "Totally."
    -   In the season 12 episode, "Canada on Strike", the entire population of Canada goes on strike after being disrespected too many times by the Americans. Their reward for their strike was $3,008 in Bennigan's coupons and gumballs, according to Terrance and Philip, while also noting that Canada lost $10.4 million. As a result, the Canadians banished World Canadian Bureau President Stephen Abootman, who started the strike, from Canada.
-   In the Robin vs. Speedy fight during the _Teen Titans (2003)_ episode "Winner Take All", Robin wins, but snaps Speedy's bow while doing so, in what had been a friendly match. After Robin celebrates his victory, Speedy asks this before being teleported away. An odd example, as both Robin and Speedy had both explicitly expressed that they'd do anything to win, and Speedy's bow didn't seem particularly irreplaceable (in fact, it inexplicably is repaired by the end of the episode). Although later when Robin learns that the entire tournament of heroes is nothing but a ploy for the Master of Games to capture and draw on the power of the losers to make himself stronger, and recalling that he'd ignored Cyborg who'd been suspicious, he quickly decides it wasn't worth it, and fights to gain the freedom of the losers.
-   _Transformers: Animated_
    -   In an episode, an upgraded Prowl beats (clone) Starscream. Unfortunately there's a lot of collateral damage - including a torn down tree and broken bird eggs, earlier that day he made it a point to protect a similar nest on Dinobot Island. Seeing these, Prowl realizes what a total asshole he's being.
-   _The Transformers_, when a beautiful woodland glen was wrecked when Autobots and Decepticons fought over possession of the pool of Blaster-reflecting electrum at its center. The final scene has the Autobot Beachcomber glumly viewing the devastation and saying "We won", in tones that embody this trope.
    -   That said, the Aesop was undercut by the fact that the Decepticons **already** wrecked much of the glen when they discovered the electrum and celebrated by shooting at each other, sending the reflected blasts all over and burning much of the glen. Even worse, Beachcomber had actually discovered the glen and the electrum, but decided to keep quiet about it. Even when the Autobots were pushed to the brink by the now-invulnerable Decepticons, Beachcomber kept quiet, and he continued to do so after the Autobots independently discovered the electrum and used it to even the odds. It made him seem like a Hypocrite, and at least part of the reason why the character gets so little respect in other Transformers media (Animated presents him as a drugged out hippy, while Shattered Glass presents him as a plodding, moronic oaf).
-   In the end of Season 2 of _Wakfu_, Qilby is asked whether his crimes, primarily causing the near-total genocide of the Eliatropes, were worth it (by the only being that still remained somewhat sympathetic to him, no less). His answer? "Yes, yes, for me it was."
