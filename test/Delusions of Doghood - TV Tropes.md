_"My grandfather used to think he could transform himself into a wolf so that he could venture out to explore the spirit realm. It was real to him, as real as what your experience was to you, but that doesn't mean he grew hair all over his body and walked around on all fours."_

You see that guy there? They're crawling around on all fours, and... are they sniffing that guy's butt? Who do they think they are?

A dog, of course.

There's plenty of Shapeshifting tropes, but this one is different. You see, these characters don't actually change form, they just _think_ they do. This is whenever a character believes they are a dog or any other animal without actually being it. A "Freaky Friday" Flip with an animal also doesn't count.

If faithful and well-behaved it might actually make a good Human Pet. All Animals Are Dogs might be explained if other non-dog animals are under the same delusion. If the deluded character is actually good at mimicking a dog, that may be because The Mind Is a Plaything of the Body. Do not confuse with Delusion of Godhood, which is something else.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Shokora in _Massugu ni Ikou_ is a dog who believes himself to be a human. He's eventually convinced by the other dogs that this can't possibly be the case... so by the next time they meet him, he's switched to believing that he's a _cat_ instead.

-   One of the strongest heroes in _One-Punch Man_ is Watchdog Man, a guy in a dog suit who protects his part of the city. Hero Killer Garou went up against him and only escaped because the fight strayed away from the neighborhood. Even more humiliating is the fact that his "moves" consist of "shaking hands", rolling over and other pet tricks. Garou is a genius martial artist who specializes in defeating other human fighters, but Watchdog Man doesn't fight like a human, he fights like a playful dog.

    -   In another episode, Ash gets hypnotized into thinking he's a Bulbasaur.
-   _Princess Mononoke_'s San, who adamantly believes she's a wolf and even wears a wolf pelt to look the part. Justified, since she was literally Raised by Wolves after her birth parents were caught intruding in Morro's forest and abandoned San when she was an infant to save themselves.

-   _Delicious in Dungeon_: Drawing on his experience with hunting dogs, Laios flushes out a hidden monster by getting down on all fours and barking and snarling furiously at it to intimidate it into a confrontation. It works. Unfortunately, he gets too into his role and leaps at it, fully intending to attack a giant fox-monster larger than he is with just his nails and teeth.

    Comic Books 

-   Happens many times in the _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_.
    -   In Carl Barks' story "Trala La", Scrooge McDuck has a nervous breakdown from over-work and starts acting like a squirrel.
    -   One story about Gyro Gearloose has the inventor try to figure out why the bird sings. After inventing various machines to answer this question, the story ends with him behaving like a bird.
    -   A story about Donald Duck has him see a hypnotist to help with his phobia of cats.

-   In _X-Men_, the Xavier Institute once had a student named Overlay, whose power was that he could induce this.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Beetle Bailey_, Beetle once hypnotises Sarge to think he's whatever he secretly wants to be, making him act like a lion. He also accidentally affects General Halftrack, but he doesn't "become" an animal: "Have you gone mad! I'm an airplane!" (Paraphrased.)
-   In _Calvin and Hobbes_, Calvin can transmogrify himself into any kind of animal, but from his mom's perspective he's always shown as a six-year-old boy. This is particularly evident in the arc where Calvin believes he's stuck as an owl.
-   _Crabgrass_: In this comic, after deciding that being a dog would be more fun, Miles and Kevin decide to give it a try. Their antics happen off panel, but Miles' father can be seen commenting on it.
-   In one _Dilbert_ arc, Dilbert told an annoying marketing rep that he would reprogram his office computer to emit radiation that would slowly mutate him into a weasel. While Dilbert didn't actually do anything to the man's computer, he was so gullible that he started transforming anyway.
-   In this _Garfield_ comic, Jon's neighbors think he's succumbed to this when they see him chasing a car on all fours with his dog Odie. Strictly speaking, Jon knows he's not a dog; he's just decided to imitate Odie for a while because he's bored and Odie seems to always find ways of entertaining himself.
-   In _SnarfQuest_, the evil dragon Kizarvexius was struck in the head by lightning during a powerful storm, and forgot who or what he was. Suthaze cursed the dragon into believing that he was a duck named Willie. Thus, Suthaze gained a powerful servant that could be easily controlled.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Child of the Storm_, Harry considers using the _Discworld_ variant on Jean's cheating ex-boyfriend instead of actually turning him into a frog (apparently doing that not only has ethical issues, but also practical ones - one annoying person quickly ends up spawning a million irritating frogs). However, with a little regret, he opts not to as it would probably be a breach of Mind over Manners.
-   _Harry Potter and the Discworld_, Umbridge unwisely pushes a temporarily Hogwarts based Granny Weatherwax too far, calling her a disgrace to witchcraft, having assumed (as more than a few do) that Granny's low magic approach meant that she _couldn't_ do magic (or was at least incompetent). Granny gives her the Stare, and the students, who've been eagerly anticipating a clash like this for ages watch... and nothing happens. Then, just as doubt starts to creep in that, horror of horrors, Umbridge might have been _right_... Umbridge lets out a loud ribbet and happily hops away towards the lake, Granny having pulled her signature trick of making people _think_ that they're frogs. Umbridge then spends the next few days living on a lily pad by the lake, which somehow supports her weight, and catching flies on her tongue with surprising competence, while Colin Creevey makes a small fortune selling photos - and once it wears off, the episode contributes significantly to her ongoing Sanity Slippage. Considering Umbridge's canonical resemblance to a toad, this is rather appropriate.

    Literature 

-   King Nebuchadnezzar from _The Bible_. This was brought on as a judgment against him by God to humble the haughty king and make him realize who is truly God. And his condition may have been a rare form of mental illness called boanthropy, which made him believe that he was cattle.
-   _Discworld_:
    
    -   This is a speciality of Granny Weatherwax, who deems it more humane, more economical, and more amusing than the classic frog transformation.
    
    _"Despite many threats, Granny Weatherwax had never turned anyone into a frog. The way she saw it, there was a technically less cruel but cheaper and much more satisfying thing you could do. You could leave them human and make them think they were a frog, which also provided much innocent entertainment for passers-by."_
    
    **Magrat:** "I always felt sorry for Mr Wilkins... It was so sad watching him try to catch flies on his tongue."
    
    -   It should be noted that it wears off... eventually. And in the case of the above mentioned Mr Wilkins, it actually gave him a new hobby - swimming.
    -   _The Wee Free Men_ also has a toad who wonders if he's a man turned into a toad or a toad cursed into believing it, with precedent for both having been shown in the series beforehand. The former is true.
    -   Inverted in _Witches Abroad_, where Lady Lilith has given a wolf human thoughts to make the Little Red Riding Hood story come true. This drives the wolf mad, and he allows the woodcutter to cut off his head.

-   In _The Hallowed Hunt_, a sorceress-divine of the Bastard's Order is insulted by a passing guard<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and she makes him believe he's a pig for a few hours.
-   Cullen the Fool in _The Silver Branch_. How much he truly thinks he is a dog and how much is Obfuscating Insanity is left as an exercise for the reader, but he is certainly at his happiest when he is acting like a hound.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_ has a decidedly non-funny example in Biter. A feral child raised to fight dogs in a pit, Biter sniffs people as they walk by him, kills his enemies with his (filed) teeth, and eats his victims after the fact. He's also utterly loyal to Rorge, the man who made him into what he is.
-   The protagonist of _Woof Woof Story_ is actually a dog...because he wished, before he died, to be reborn as one. Sniffing out table scraps and fetching balls makes him happier than he's ever been before, and he is perfectly content to forget that he was ever human. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

    Theater 

-   In _Playing Doctor_ by Billy Van Zandt and Jane Milmore, one of the characters, a hypochondriac, is "diagnosed" with Talbot Syndrome as a throwaway line to get rid of him. The "doctor's assistant" later reads out the definition of the syndrome to the hypochondriac and his family. "A psychological disorder in which the patient takes on characteristics of a dog. In extreme cases, that canine mind overtakes the human mind and... the patient irreversibly becomes a living dog".

    Video Games 

-   In _Grand Theft Auto V_ (specifically the re-release for the Xbox One and Play Station 4) there are 27 peyote plants scattered across the map. Eating them will make any of the 3 protagonists hallucinate that they are various animals, including various dogs and even more specifically may make them think they are Chop the Rottweiler. The game allows you to play briefly as these animals (which also includes, cats, coyotes, sharks and other sea creatures, various birds, and even a sasquatch). However the game makes it pretty clear that whilst the characters think they have transformed they have not really done so (though it doesn't explain the flight as birds).
-   Early in _Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle_, one of the Rabbids that you see in the background is running around in a block with a circle cut out, apparently so stressed from being transported to the Mushroom Kingdom that he thinks he's a hamster running in a wheel.

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Haley uses a potion that increases her ability to bluff to the point that she can make anyone believe practically anything.

-   Inverted in _Skin Horse_ with Phil the Mynah, an Uplifted Animal who thinks he's human.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: A downplayed version of a cathood delusion seems to be an element of Lalli's implied disorder. He's perfectly aware that he's human, but has a lot of cat-like habits such as sitting on his haunches, sleeping in strange places (and doing so in the daytime due to being used to working at night), scratching doors instead of knocking at them and hissing at human beings that disturb him too much. He's also of a very solitary nature, has limited tolerance for other people touching him and is hostile to cats he runs into. Unsurprisingly, his luonto eventually turned out to be an Eurasian lynx, which may offer a partial explanation. The explanation is really partial as while the two other mages of the story have personality traits that are typically associated with their respective spirit animal equivalents, these traits stay within the range of acceptable human behaviour.

-   _The Garfield Show_: Odie once did this to an entire town in "Dog Days", when an alien gave him a self-replicating alien cookie as gratitude for finding him marshmallows.

Fortunately, Rocko returns back to normal at the end of the episode.

And it worked .

They had to get such a man to woo her with mating dances and the like, so that they could get her artificially inseminated. (It was a rare species, that's why they actually did it). While it is not known whether she thought of herself as being a human woman, this is very likely.
