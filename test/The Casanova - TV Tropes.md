_"Gentlemen, I'm sure we can sort this out amicably. Look at it this way: if you could do what I could do, you'd do it too! But you can't. I can. And I have. And I'll do it again. So you should be happy for me, just a little tiny bit, don't you think?"_

The ladykiller, the player, the rake — a man who relentlessly pursues, lands, loves, and then abandons members of the opposite sex, a skill bestowed upon him to demonstrate just how attractive he is. Sometimes comic, sometimes sinister, always successful, this character leaves behind a string of broken hearts, and occasional vows of revenge that are rarely fulfilled. Casanova's only motivation is indulging his lust and desire, sating them with the bodies of his completely willing conquests.

Contrast with the unsuccessful Casanova Wannabe. Compare with the inexplicable Kavorka Man. A guy who gets the girls like a Casanova, albeit unintentionally, is a Chick Magnet. If kind-hearted, may overlap with Chivalrous Pervert. The Charmer is equally charming but less sex-obsessed. If they really get around but want to settle down, it's Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places. A Handsome Lech has more negative connotations and a sparser scorecard than the Casanova.

The trope is named for Giacomo Casanova (1725-1798), an Italian soldier, spy, diplomat, adventurer, and librarian whose extensive but unreliable autobiography (in which he almost literally described himself as God's Gift to Women<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) established his eternal fame as a lover. It should be noted that the historical Casanova was closer to a Chivalrous Pervert who really was looking for love... just with women who were locked in loveless political marriages — and also achieved his successes despite being famously ugly. (Definitely<small>◊</small> he was no Heath Ledger.<small>◊</small>) Interestingly, he was one of the few 18th-century men who bathed almost daily and asked the same thing from his partners (this may have aided him in his sex appeal, if most other guys stank to high heaven).

For the juvenile version — all of the above without the sex — see KidAnova. Contrast the Serial Romeo (who falls in love with a long succession of women, one at a time and for reasonable periods). If the guy is actually only _rumored_ to be a Casanova and has no evidence onscreen, it's the Urban Legend Love Life. If he develops feelings for one of his conquests (or someone who refuses him), he's a Ladykiller in Love. If that love transforms him into a committed and responsible partner and father, then he's become a Reformed Rake. See More Friends, More Benefits for when the mechanics of a game encourage the player character to act this way. If he's malicious, he may be an Intentional Heartbreaker.

Note: It should be mentioned that even after the affairs were over, most of Casanova's ex-lovers still liked him, and he was reputedly quite the gentleman. This trope would probably fit (the fictional) Don Juan better.

Finally, a warning: Despite Maneater being a redirect, this trope should **NOT** be confused with I'm a Humanitarian or the Literal Maneater.

Super-Trope to Spies Are Lecherous and Really Gets Around. See Horny Bard for the fantasy, more musically inclined equivalent.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Aoshima in _Ah! My Goddess_, who is explicitly referred to as a "casanova." Fortunately, when he's _not_ busy being a slimy excuse for a human being, he tends to be the Butt-Monkey.

-   _City Hunter_:
    -   Ryo, the titular character. He's actually a very successful one until Kaori came along... Even then, Kaori can only prevent him from consummating in their home, as they will fall for him, with very few exceptions.
    -   Mick Angel, an American friend of Ryo, has the hobby of seducing married or otherwise engaged women. Especially if he's been hired to kill their man.
-   _A Cruel God Reigns_: Ian. He gets pretty much anyone he wants, and is a classic example of Even the Guys Want Him.
-   Agon of _Eyeshield 21_ has this trait tacked on to his already unpleasant personality. It's not especially relevant to the story, it's just another extension of his Jerk Jock personality and serves as yet another reason for the heroes to dislike him ("Down with guys who have girlfriends!").
    
    He's also one of _two characters_ that has luck with women in the entire _series._ The first one is Hatsujou None of the Nagas have any luck with women since they attend an all boys school, and Ikkyu and Yamabushi are _very_ jealous.
    
-   _Fairy Tail_: Loki is a blatant example, until The Reveal and his return to the spirit world. When he thinks he's dying and starts withdrawing from everything, he's revealed to have had four girlfriends at once.
-   Subverted in the manga version of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ where Roy Mustang pretends he's this to cover up the fact that he uses prostitutes, whose madam is his adoptive mother, as spies. _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_ plays this straight because the subversion happens after the anime Overtook the Manga.
-   Mingyi in _Goddess Creation System_ is a cultured, elegant man who seduces women and then gets bored of them at the drop of a hat. However, it's indicated that he's less universally charming that his success rate would indicate given that at least one concubine was abducted and doesn't want to be there at all. Xiaxi's complete immunity to his charms rather upsets him due to his immense pride. Which is the whole point of her refusing him in the first place: She's genre savvy enough to exploit the hell out of the Ladykiller in Love trope.
-   Explored to an extent in _Golgo 13_. The title character tends to have sex before a job, and does have good luck at getting women to join him in bed. However, he just as often hires prostitutes, and due to his notorious blank expression not changing, a number of readers have theorized he doesn't actually _enjoy_ it.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   Paptimus Scirrocco from _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_ is a very evil version of this. He's basically what happens when you combine a Casanova with a Magnificent Bastard and give him the psychic powers of a Newtype. Generally the kind that uses his charms more to use woman as tools than just as sexual objects, though.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury_: Shaddiq Zenneli evokes this trope, as a handsome, flirtatious young man whose closest followers are all young women. While introducing the rules of dueling to the protagonist, he mentions you can even stake women on their outcome (something his fellow Dueling Committee member Guel says only Shaddiq would think of doing). However, his relationship to the women he surrounds himself with appears to be just friends and allies in battle, and in truth he's long been a Ladykiller in Love with another girl who has no interest in him.
-   Miroku from _Inuyasha_ is The Charmer and is always flirting with women since his goal is having a child, his catchphrase being “Will you bear my children?”. While in the series is implied subtly that he has actually slept with several women, it is left to interpretation leaving it as an Urban Legend Love Life. That is until Word of God comfirmed it saying he used to have a 90% success rate with the ladies, but it went to zero after joining the team. It also didn’t help that he fell in love with Sango.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Dio Brando is so charismatic and good-looking that he managed to father four children. _With four different women._ His Alternate Continuity counterpart in Part 7 has the same influence, sometimes to his detriment.<small>◊</small>
    -   Hol Horse has the same way with women, which he uses to take advantage of them - not in _that_ way (at least, not that we're shown), but in order to use them to make his escape when needed. Although one of these women is revealed to be a Stand user, and his getaway is a ruse to get Jotaro and friends to trust her.
-   Karin's brother, Ren, sucks the blood of stressed out women every night. He says they're usually quite grateful afterwards, but tend to keep bugging him.
-   _Kyō, Koi o Hajimemasu_ has the male lead, Tsubaki Kyota at first. He's noted for flirting and sleeping around with many different girls, but has never had an actual romantic relationship.
-   _Maken-ki!_:
    -   Though Love Espada is openly bisexual, she's earned an in-universe reputation for seducing other women instead. In chapter 76, Usui and Himegami eavesdrop as she has sex with Kyoki in one of the school's clubrooms. During which, Usui explains that Espada allegedly slept with over 100 girls during Tenbi's previous Himekagura Festival.
    -   Played for Laughs with Rudolf in episode 7 ( season 2). Girls assume he's a cute harmless teddy bear... until they bring him home, which is how he gets into their pants, so to speak. The shopkeeper Himegami bought him from even admitted that she was one of his lovers, until she caught him cheating on her with two other women. Rudolf also bangs Nozuchi offscreen and, near the end of the episode, he leaves a trail of women trembling in orgasm at the park; including Ms. Aki.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: Ryoji Kaji hits on all adult women in the cast. That doesn't stop him from teasing Shinji about him living at Misato's and shipping him with Asuka. In the second _Rebuild of Evangelion_ anime he even makes a move on _Shinji_ as a joke.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_:
    -   Akio Ohtori and Touga Kiryuu from use, manipulate and abuse women and men alike using in great part their sex appeal for More than Mind Control effect. Then Akio does it to Touga, establishing him as a sort of Alpha Casanova.
    -   Ruka Tsuchiya takes a Hands-On Approach with the female fencing club members, dates and beds Shiori, whom he later utterly humiliates, and is very forceful with Juri, despite the fact that he's supposedly trying to help her break free of her self-destructive cycle.

-   Ryou from _Strawberry Shake Sweet_, in a Girls' Love example, has bedded about a thousand girls and that's only the known _minimum._
-   Jaeha from _Yona of the Dawn_: is a smooth-talking, Chivalrous Pervert man who often visits brothels and openly flirts with any woman who catches his eye. Also loves it when women throw themselves at him at any time. But he's a complete gentlemen towards and does treat every women he meets with respect regardless of their situation.

    Comic Books 

-   _Berrybrook Middle School_: Zeke has had a long history of wooing girls with his timid and adorable appearance, but every single one of his relationships, including ones with Jazmine and Nic, ended badly due to how unfaithful he is.
-   _DCU_:
    -   Different versions of Batman have either portrayed him as being with many women or as avoiding most women. A common feature to most versions is that he ends up alone. His public persona as Bruce Wayne is essentially a Casanova, constantly dating and breaking up with multiple women to keep up the Millionaire Playboy facade.
    -   Bat Lash was a Western drifter who used his considerable personal charisma to charm his way into the heart of every pretty girl he met, always moving on before things had a chance to get serious.
-   _Fables_: The entire point of Prince Charming. The reason he's in so many stories is because he constantly marries and abandons various princesses. This leads to him originally being less than popular in Fabletown.
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   Starfox of The Avengers. It's suggested in _She-Hulk_ that he's an inadvertent rapist who unconsciously uses his psychic powers to get women into bed, but the canonicity of _She-Hulk_ is sometimes dubious. It's been firmly established what his powers are and how much control he has over them; _She-Hulk_ just pointed out Unfortunate Implications that already existed. However, in the case where Starfox was accused of being a rapist, it was revealed this was not true. He has not used his powers to get women. The woman who accused him did so to try and cover up the affair since she was married.
    -   For your consideration ladies and gentlemen, The Incredible Hercules. Pulls about as much tail as James Bond.
    -   Tony Stark alias _Iron Man_. Lampshaded in "Extremis":
        
        **Tony Stark:** I have my own fleet of satellites in geosynchronous orbit.  
        **Maya Hansen:** You actually get girls with that line?  
        **Tony Stark:** They make me a lot of money, I find that does the trick.  
        **Maya Hansen:** Some classy ladies you know.
        
    -   Gambit, who is largely considered to be a reformed example, having given this up since meeting Rogue. He only goes back to this when they break up. This is exaggerated in one of Gambit's stand-alone comics. He breaks into an old girlfriend's house in the middle of the night to request a favor and both are confused by the lack of sex.
    -   Wolverine has had _plenty_ of tail in his life, chasing it like an excitable dog, but in his case, he actually catches it. A LOT.
    -   _The Incredible Hulk_: The Hulk. No, really! Have you seen how many children he has with multiple women? _Three_, so far, with a suspected fourth running around. As Red She-Hulk who is actually Betty Ross Banner commented after learning the Hulk had been married to not one, but two hot alien warrior queens;
        
        **Red She-Hulk:** You really got around, huh?
        
-   The title character of _Nikolai Dante_ has sex with every attractive woman he meets except for Elena Kurakin. His half-brother, Andreas Romanov, does much the same, but secretly feels his life is empty because he hasn't accomplished anything of real value. Lulu, Andreas' sister and Nikolai's half-sister, is a female version who is also into weird BDSM; refreshingly, there isn't any particular stigma attached to Lulu's appetites, and she and Andreas are two of the nicer Romanovs.
-   _Ultimate Marvel_:
    -   Ultimate Wolverine: Magneto gave Wolverine many missions of infiltration and killing in the past. He has a habit of holding the kill (and then escaping) when he meets a girl that he wants to have sex with. Magneto got used to those "delays", and let him be, because he was still the best hitman at his disposal.
    -   Ultimate Tony Stark was even more than the original one (and still in the pre-MCU years). He gave it up temporarily when he got married with the Black Widow. She betrayed the team and tried to kill him, and died at the end of the adventure. Tony mourned her next to a window... and forgot it all when he saw a gorgeous blonde passing by.

    Fan Works 

-   _Advice and Trust_: Subverted. Due to a misunderstanding, all Shinji's female classmates convinced themselves that he is some sort of stud and is in a three-ways relationship with Asuka and Rei (ironically they are accidentally not so off the mark: Shinji and Asuka are dating secretly, and Rei is in love with both, but she does not want to disrupt their relationship), so they start to lust after him and chase him, much to his chagrin (he only wants Asuka) and Asuka's wrath, who complains that they think he is "Shinji the casanova" when he is hers.
-   In _The Black Emperor_, Lelouch and Milly are an unusual example of a Casanova _couple_. The two of them have a hobby of seducing girls with the intent of sleeping with them, sometimes together. Despite this, they still have a deep and genuine love for one another.
-   _Break Your Heart_: Gender-inverted with Rainbow. While she was living in Cloudsdale she had casual sexual relationships with Fluttershy _and_ Gilda at the same time and on the side she had one-night stands with many other girls.
-   Shu in _Catastrophe Theory_ is a reconstructed Casanova. Rather than dazzling the ladies with his masculine, alpha traits, he's shown to be subservient, sensitive, empathetic, and more than willing to drop everything and clean the sink. And women flock to him because of it.
-   _A Crown of Stars_: Parodied. Shinji is remarkably smooth and confident when he thinks he is dreaming. He gets Asuka so shocked and aroused that she calls him "Shinji the Casanova".
-   _Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness_: Apparently, Colin Creevey of all people.
    
    _"I did just fine with the Muggle girls on holidays, thank you very much, because they think I'm cute and mysterious and know I go to some kind of exclusive and super-secret private boarding school.”_
    

-   Gender Inverted and played with in _A Good Compromise_. USS _Black Prince_ chief engineer Jasmine Velasquez was already established in _From Bajor to the Black_ and "The Silence Ends" as a determinedly single Extreme Omnisexual. Early on she tries to vamp on Ensign Newbie Gilad Ronson (intending it as stress relief for herself), but she comes on too strong and he panics and runs.
-   Deconstructed with King Garon in _The Lost King_. His frequent one-night stands with women has caused them to stick around in his court, gradually turning it deadly and decadent as they competed for his favor. The infighting is so brutal it actually causes him to _stop_ being this because he's so tired of seeing them kill each other and his bastard children. (And this is _before_ his youngest surviving daughter was conceived.) Yet his reputation as a womanizer still haunts him.
-   _The Pieces Lie Where They Fell_: In the sequel _Picking up the Pieces_, Night Blade's older brother Deep Blade has a well-deserved and self-admitted reputation as a playstallion. However, he always makes it clear to his partners from the start that it's casual, with no strings attached. Not all of them believe him, or try to make more out of it than Deep intended.
-   _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ has Ash's Pikachu, shockingly enough. Turns out he's _very_ popular with females in his egg group, and may have fathered Misty's Azurill in the original timeline.
-   In _Shinji the Casanova_ (link), Shinji gets Casanova training from an unusual third party and sets out to seduce Asuka as accidentally and involuntarily seducing all his female classmates.
-   _Shinji And Warhammer 40 K_: Doubly subverted. The whole Shinji's high school female population has a crush on him. There are three girls (Asuka, Rei and Mana) and a woman (Maya Ibuki) chasing him actively, two of which consider that he should claim all them. The double subversion comes from Shinji affirming that he is not interested in being a player, he does not want a harem and "their" girls are not sluts... and at the same time the Eldar Farseer -that embodies his lust, among other things- spends the whole time suggesting that he should sleep with Asuka or all them, prefferably at once.
    -   In the Hot Springs Episode while the cast was relaxing in the springs he felt that Misato, Maya, Asuka, Rei and Mana were getting upset... so he openly walked into the only women side, reassured Mana and left with no bodily harm inflicted upon him. His male friends instantly bowed down.
    -   After a Time Skip his sync rates were very low. Maya came up with an idea to cheer him up. She recruited Rei and Mana and together barged into Misato's apartment declaring they were going to kidnap Shinji -and Asuka- and have an orgy. Misato thought that they were joking, but the next day Shinji and Asuka flatly refused commenting on the matter. A bunch of chapters later it is revealed that Shinji had kissed Asuka and Rei in rapid sucession.
-   Iroh in the _The Stalking Zuko Series_. He is known for a get sexual appetite before settling down with his wife, which rekindled during Zuko's search. His track record, according to Zuko, consists of two nuns, their Ba Sing Se neighbor and Li and La.
-   _Thousand Shinji_: Double subversion. In this story Shinji might be The Casanova easily: all his female classmates want him, and he is a Manipulative Bastard and a Jerkass plays with other people's feelings to further his plans or for his own amusement. Nonetheless he openly says he has no interest in a woman he can seduce easily. He only chases Asuka and he seduces her by being straight-forward, sincere, honest and truthful rather manipulative. However, although he did not plan for it, he ended up married to Asuka, Rei and Misato.
-   In _The Truth Behind the Friendship_ Harry mentioned that Sirius slept with twenty-two girls at Hogwarts in an attempt to beat an unnamed Ravenclaw's record of thirty-seven.
-   In _The Weaver Option_ the pirate admiral Travelliath Sliscus maintains a harem of Eldar women but also has a hobby of seducing female Rogue Traders and the wives of Imperial planetary governors.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Stuart Townsend's character Adam in the Irish film _About Adam_. He beds/romances with no difficulty three very different sisters, their brother's uptight girlfriend - and almost the brother as well.
-   _Below Her Mouth_: Dallas has a very beautiful girlfriend to start with, then attracts Jasmine as well, who never felt that way for a woman before, and also seduces a stripper quite easily.
-   The great seducer and Trope Namer has been portrayed many times on film: IMDB has no less than 85 movies or TV shows with the word "Casanova" in the title, and most of them feature the gentleman himself in a leading or supporting role. The best known are Federico Fellini's 1976 film (which is a major deconstruction of the trope, depicting Casanova's life and quest for sexual pleasure as empty, in addition to the numerous liberties it takes with history), the 2005 film starring Heath Ledger, and the 2005 BBC drama mini-series starring David Tennant. The latter is considered one of the more faithful adaptations of Casanova's memoirs.
-   _Doctor... Series_:
    -   Dr. Benskin from _Doctor in the House (1954)_ and _Doctor at Large_. He can't seem to make it through one scene without flirting with or commenting on a girl.
    -   Trail from _Doctor at Sea_ only has one thing on the mind - women. He goes off looking for girls in Bellos, tries to pull Jill during the ship's dance and when he thinks the ship is sinking, he is the first to ask if Helene and Miss Mallet have made it to safety.
    -   Dr. Burke from _Doctor in Love_ and _Doctor in Trouble_ is always trying to chat up women (typical for the roles played by Leslie Phillips in The '60s):
        
        **Dr. Burke**: Good evening, Doctor. I'm collecting for the county hospital.
        
        **Dr. Hare**: Tony!
        
        **Dr. Burke**: Have you got any women patients you don't want?
        
    -   Dr. Grimsdyke from _Doctor in Clover_ is never without a woman on his mind. He gets fired from the men's prison he worked at for sleeping with the Governor's daughter, and once he arrives at Hampden Cross Hospital, he almost instantly begins trying to put the moves on Nurse Bancroft and Jeannine.
    -   Basil from _In Trouble_ uses his fame appearing on TV as Dr. Dare to keep girls obsessing over him on the daily.
-   1926 film _Don Juan_, one of many takes on the Don Juan legend, has the man so busy with girlfriends that he has hourly schedules. In one scene he has to usher three different women out of his apartment in three different directions.
-   In _The Double_, James probably sleeps with half the women in the movie.
-   _The Ghost Goes West_: Scottish lad, Murdoch Glourie, is quite the ladies man in 18th-century Scotland.
-   Peter Venkman in _Ghostbusters (1984)_ mixes this with Jerk Ass With A Heart Of Gold as his flirty antics makes him torture a poor guy in an experiment about psychic powers in order to not harm the beautiful girl. Similarly his interest in Dana Barrett made an important part of the plot.
-   Surgeon Mr. Eden in _Green for Danger_. He has a reputation as a womanise;, has had a relationship with Sister Bates in the past (and she is still pining for him); is currently putting the moves on Freddi Linley, despite her being engaged to Dr. Barnes; and Nurse Woods pointedly warns him that things are different in the hospital and won't be like they were in his private practice before the war, with female patients coming to him with "fluttering eyelashes and bosoms".
-   In _Gregory's Girl_, Billy the Window Washer is idolized by the boys for his reputation.
-   Indiana Jones, naturally as is a character inspired by James Bond. He has several romances throughout all the movies (sometimes more than one girl per movie), and the canonical prequel series _The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles_ shows that he was like that since he was a teen.
-   James Bond:
    -   Bond was apparently expelled from Eton after an "incident" with one of the maids...
    -   Doubles as his Fatal Flaw, as several of the girls (particularly Vesper Lynd and Tracy Bond) do end up dead. Many villains have lampshaded, deconstructed and even exploited this flaw against him at times. The Big Bad of _GoldenEye_ even derisively states that Bond does it to hide the inner grief of losing the only woman he truly loved.
    -   Contrary to the stereotype that Bond regularly kills the women he sleeps with (invoked by the "kiss kiss bang bang" catchphrase of the 1960s), in truth this has happened exactly three times in the history of the movie franchise (Fiona in _Thunderball_, Fatima in _Never Say Never Again_, and the above example of Elektra in _The World Is Not Enough_. And in the case of Fiona, it's debatable whether Bond intentionally had used her as a human shield.).
-   Subverted in the movie and book _Kiss the Girls_ where the kidnapping/rapist/murderer bad guy takes the alias "Casanova". After he drugs and attempts to murder one of his victims a character remarks "Yeah, he's cunning, but he doesn't know his history: The real Casanova would never have approved."
-   In _Laughter in Paradise_, Simon Russell is a womanizing cad with a string of girlfriends across London. He starts worrying that one or more of them will try to marry him once word of his inheritance gets out.
-   Stefan from the the film _Letter from an Unknown Woman_ is a classical pianist and is Tall, Dark, and Handsome, therefore, women catnip.
-   _The Love Parade_ (1929) has three of them. In the song "Paris, Stay the Same," Count Alfred sings about all the romantic nights he's had with the ladies of Gay Paree. Then Alfred's valet Jacques sings about his romantic nights with the maids and shopgirls of Paris. Then Alfred's dog barks out a verse, which is pretty clearly the same sentiment, but about the, er, bitches of Paris.
-   Tony Stark in the _Marvel Cinematic Universe_ movies:
    -   Claims to have gone 12-for-13 in one year with Maxim cover girls (he couldn't make his schedule work with March, but December was twins). Seduces Christine Everhart, leaves her to wake up alone in his bed, and while showing Everhart the door, Stark's Girl Friday Pepper Potts says that her duties sometimes include "taking out the trash."
    -   A deleted scene set right before the Golmira scenes has Tony seducing and leading a woman off to bed... and picking up another in the hallway along the way. He then gives a lame excuse to bail on the apparently inebriated women. "I'm going to get ice for the champagne" or something like that. In the distance, we see Iron Man taking off.
-   The historical Giacomo Casanova is a character in _Münchhausen_, but he's actually older in this film and past his womanizing years. Played straight, however, with Baron Münchhausen, who has amazing success with women wherever he goes.
-   _Mythica_: Dagen is introduced with another man's wife, and is continually shown having seduced women over the next films. Eventually he settles down with Marek-in the afterlife.
-   Oscar Diggs, aka The Wizard of Oz, is one in _Oz the Great and Powerful_. He's made Ann—from Kansas, his assistants, the strongman's wife ( really bad idea, that one), Theodora and Glinda fall in love with him. And he didn't care for any of the women he was with, stating they'll get over him and the heartbreak. Ann was the closest to loving a woman he ever came, but he still wasn't willing to change for her and settle. He later falls for Glinda, possibly only because she reminds him of Ann, but he can have her without compromising his wanton hero/show-off status.
-   Pavi Largo from _Repo! The Genetic Opera_ is close to being the epitome of this trope. As he says himself in 'Mark It Up':
    
    Ask a Gentern who they prefer—ten out of nine will say the Pavi!
    
-   _Shame_ presents a deconstruction. Brandon is a young handsome successful businessman who can easily pick up girls. But he's also a sex addict and will resort to prostitution and masturbation to satisfy his needs. And none of it ever gives him happiness.
-   _Tales of an Ancient Empire_: Oda was one, judging by the number of women he managed to have sex with (and father children by too).
-   In _Unfaithful_, it's implied that Connie Sumner is a Rare Female Example. Connie and Paul are having sex in the cafe men's room and her ass is up against a wall and he's grabbing it. Meanwhile, her friends are sitting at a table, waiting for Connie and they're talking about her:
    
    **Tracy**: She's not like that. She's really nice...
    
    **Sally**: Of course she is. That only makes it worse. She's nice and sweet and her ass is exactly where it was when she was in college.
    
-   In _Violent Saturday_, Gil Clayton is considered the leader of the 'wolf pack' in town. At the start of the film, he is having an affair with Mrs. Fairchild.
-   _Virgin Territory_: Lorenzo, who has sex with multiple _nuns_ over the course of the film. It helps that he's a handsome young man, probably the only male they have contact with.
-   Commander Fanshawe from _Watch Your Stern_ is famous for his experience with the girls:
    
    **Commander Fanshawe**: Watch it. He's a bit of a wolf, you know.
    
    **Miss Foster**: Baker, a "wolf"?
    
    **Commander Fanshawe**: Mm hm.
    
    **Miss Foster**: Well, that's a laugh coming from _you_.
    
-   _What's New Pussycat?_ stars Peter O'Toole as a man who just can't say no to women. He sees a psychiatrist to help him swear them off and be faithful to his fiancee, but the doctor is a deranged lech himself.

    Literature 

-   Spyros Stavaronas, the attractive young shrimp fisherman in _Alexandra_ by Scott O'Dell. At first, he uses his charms to distract Alexandra so his henchmen can smuggle cocaine on her boat. When Alexandra finds out, he further tries to seduce her into keeping his secret and not turning them into the cops.
-   Mr. Wednesday from _American Gods_ is a lecherous old man with supernatural charm, a penchant for virgins, and no respect for age-of-consent laws. The book's protagonist, Shadow, reluctantly finds himself witnessing the seduction of a teenage waitress, deciding it was "like watching an old wolf stalking a fawn too young to know that if it did not run, and run now, it would wind up in a distant glade with its bones picked clean by the ravens." In fact, this is exactly how Shadow got conceived.
-   _Apollo's Grove_: Atollon, a priest of Apollo, at one point seduces a village woman using the same words his mentor had used to describe the sacred nature of Apollo's grove.
-   In _Beauty Queens_ by Libba Bray, The pirate, Duff is revealed to be this. He set his sights on Adina, a Straw Feminist, to boost his ratings.
-   Mark, of _Blaze (or Love in the Time of Supervillains)_, has worked his way through a long string of blondes, Blaze being the latest target...
-   Hugo Lamb from _The Bone Clocks_. He's charming, charismatic, and a serial womanizer.
-   In _Catching Fire_, the sequel of _The Hunger Games_, Finnick is the object of every girl's affection and he's rumored to exploit that for his own pleasure. Although, as revealed in _Mockingjay_, this may actually be a subversion. He does love one single woman, Annie, and was forced into becoming a sex slave by the Capitol to protect her. His heartbreaker reputation is just the public front for what's _really_ going on.
-   Moritz Holl from the German dystopian novel _Corpus Delicti_ likes having short affairs with women and especially loves to have sex with them. Nevertheless more of a downplayed example, since he always hoped on finding true love.
-   Casanunda the dwarf from _Discworld_ is a parody of this trope. We can't really be sure of his actual record, since he is also a self-proclaimed Outrageous Liar.
-   _The Divine Comedy_: The first _bolgia_ in the eighth Circle of Hell is reserved for those panderers and pimps who used deceit to sexually exploit women. Their ranks include Jason of the Argonauts, who abandoned his lovers, Hypsipyle and Medea, once they had sacrificed everything to ease his quest.
-   Comically averted in, of all places, Lord Byron's poem _Don Juan_. His version of Don Juan is a Chaste Hero— which turns out ironically to make him irresistible to women, who find it extremely attractive that he is just being innocent and not trying to seduce anyone.
-   A character in _Don Quixote_ is also portrayed like this in the male villager's stories about her. We later find out these injuries were imagined, she was just being chaste and as she wisely points out, she can't help being beautiful.
-   In Sarah A. Hoyt's _Draw One in the Dark_, Kyrie tells herself that the officer probably turns on his attractiveness for any woman; it's not personal to her.
-   _The Elminster Series_:
    -   One of Elminster's defining traits is that he'll flirt and/or sleep with virtually anything that is female and not related to him. Even ghosts, liches, and dragons in human form. If we account for the disparity in series entries, the number of his conquests probably rivals James Bond. Even outside of his saga it's pretty much a Running Gag.
    -   Seriously. The first thing he does after emerging from the Can in _Temptation_ is find some random village that has been taken over by bandits and liberate it. The second thing he does is sleep with one of its women.
    -   The series also doesn't shy away from the results of all that sex. _Daughter_ is centered on one of his many children with various lovers, who meets some more near the end of it. Technically, fertility of the Chosen is under Mystra's complete control, but she rarely has good reasons to veto a magically strong bloodline.
-   Paridell from _The Faerie Queene_ proves his worth as a descendent of Venus by trying to seduce every woman he comes into contact with. While he strikes out with Britomart, he manages to used a well-placed mix of flattery, poetry, and faux-vulnerability to convince Malbecco's young wife to leave him.
-   In Aaron Allston's _Galatea in 2-D_, Paris makes a move on Elsie as soon as he is drawn from the painting.
-   Neil Strauss's _The Game (2005)_ is about becoming this. And the book is full of them... only thing is that they are all Cloudcuckoolanders.
-   In Dan Abnett's Gaunt's Ghosts novel _Necropolis_, Gaunt after a wartime fling thinks of his mentor Otkar who had left a trail of tearful women behind him and warned Gaunt not to get involved, as it would weaken him. Gaunt realizes that although as soon as the war is over, their social classes would separate them (which she knows too), he would now fight to the end to save this woman, and that his emotional investment in the Ghosts has in reality kept him on the job.
-   _Guardians of the Flame_: Walter Slovotsky. At the beginning of the story, he and Doria have already been "friends with benefits" for some time. His charming personality and status as a football star imply that he's very popular with girls. During the first trip to The Other Side, he also sleeps with Andy-Andy (angering Karl, who's attracted to her). She ends up with Karl though. Even after he gets married, Walter doesn't stop, and continues having sex with other women.
-   Lude from _House of Leaves_, who actually keeps a list of his conquests, their prominent features, and how he had sex with them.
-   _How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom_: Because of the number of attractive and talented ladies that latch onto him, main protagonist Souma Kazuya develops an In-Universe reputation as this. It isn't actually deserved and he finds it kind of annoying: the women in his Battle Harem like him because he's an intelligent, reliable, good-natured man who legitimately has the best interests of his country and family at heart. But it leads to situations like Imperial Princess Jeanne Euphoria thinking she might have to seduce him to get him to secure Elfrieden's withdrawal from Amidonia in volume 3, and the Lunarian Orthodox Papal State specifically selecting a "saint" who looks like an amalgamation of his then-current crop of fiancees to appeal to his baser instincts in volume 5.
-   _Jaine Austen Mysteries_:
    -   In _Last Writes_, Quinn Kirkland was sleeping with Audrey, Kandi, Vanessa, and Bianca.
    -   In _Death by Pantyhose_, Vic Cleveland was sleeping with his current girlfriend Allison, waitress Holly, and Reagan Dixon, and those are just the ones we get to know the names of. He even had a book comparing all the women he's slept with.
    -   Sven from _Pampered to Death_ has a bit of a reputation for sleeping around behind his wife's back.
-   James Bond. This is brought out most clearly in the last paragraph of the series, effectively describing how he can never settle down with one woman.
    -   In the books it's a little more Byronic. For example, in _Moonraker_ he expects to automatically be rewarded for his efforts by sex with Gala Brand, only for Brand to reveal that she wasn't kidding about being engaged. However, he willingly lets her go off to get married and they both go their separate ways as friends.
    -   _Trigger Mortis_ has Bond observe the hordes of pretty girls clamouring over the winning racers. However, he thinks that he would feel extremely uneasy if he was in the same situation, as he prefers having a single strong and independent women to multiple ones fighting for attention.
-   You have to read between the lines in Lord Chesterfield's _Letters to His Son_, but it's there. "I repeat it again and again to you, Let the great book of the world be your principal study. 'Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna'; which may be rendered thus in English: Turn Over MEN BY DAY, AND WOMEN BY NIGHT. I mean only the best editions." (letter 137)
-   The Marquis Trémicour of _The Little House_ is notorious for his many sexual conquests — a fact Mélite is well aware of when agreeing to visit his private residence (where many of Trémicour's previous lovers were rumored to have been seduced), having wagered that she'll not fall prey to his charms. She loses the wager.
-   Gloom the dragon from _Loyal Enemies_ likes to fashion himself a casanova and pretends to leave broken hearts behind everywhere. As it is, every dryad he tries his charms on snubs him and the one time he does manage to score, he can't even remember which sister he slept with and gets chased out of the house by a furious father.
-   Murillio of the _Malazan Book of the Fallen_ specializes in seducing and bedding married women. He notes that all the students of the man who trained him in dueling ended up pursuing some vice; his was just a bit less dangerous. Ended up quitting after a younger woman seduced him and he nearly died when her suitor defended her "honor".
-   Henry Crawford of _Mansfield Park_ has every woman in the world wrapped around his finger... except the heroine, which he cannot take lying down...
-   Marcus of _The Mark of the Lion_ begins the series as one; he is apparently quite skilled at seducing his family’s female servants with a mere glance, despite his string of girlfriends on the side.
-   Jace Wayland from _The Mortal Instruments_ is implied to have been involved with lots of girls, and he flirts with Kaelie in _City of Bones_. However, prior to Clary he was never in a long term relationship.
-   Elinalise of _Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation_ is a fairly positive female example. Being afflicted with a curse that makes her physically need sex and an unusually active libido to match it, she has perfected the art of soliciting men for one night stands. She doesn't even need to speak the same language to get what she's after.
-   Fictional comedian Monti Tree from _My Screwups_ fit this trope to a T, losing his virginity at 13, to bedding supermodels well into adulthood. However, that all comes to a complete stop when he finds out he had a son he didn't know about.
-   _My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!_: Within the original _Fortune Lover_ scenario, Keith is noted to be quite a playboy due to all the verbal abuse he got from his adoptive mother and sister leaving him starved for affection, and his route in the game has him become a Ladykiller in Love. This is averted within the story proper, as Katarina awakening her past life memories leads her to instead act as his Cool Big Sis and condition him to always treat women with respect to specifically avoid him developing this sort of behavior (which ironically makes him even more popular among the opposite sex than his game counterpart).
-   Aiden's very first scene in _Of Fear and Faith_ ends with him convincing a woman who's angry at him for trespassing on her property to go to bed with him. He proceeds to charm almost _every_ woman he meets from then on.
-   Larry Douglas in _The Other Side of Midnight_. The first "book" of the novel tells the life stories of two of his _many_ conquests, Catherine Alexander and Noelle Page, via alternating chapters. The former marries him, unaware of his true nature; the latter, whom he abandoned years before he met Catherine, devotes her life to destroying him. The remainder of the story is about what happens when Noelle manipulates events to bring Larry back into her life.
-   In _On Fairy-Stories_, J. R. R. Tolkien pointed out that first use of "faerie" in English was to refer to a Casanova, dressed up to seduce when he attended church. (The Fair Folk sort of faerie, not the little winged thing sort.)
-   Jimmy (Snowman) in _Oryx and Crake_ and _The Year of the Flood_ by Margaret Atwood, is this and also a harbors a years-long romantic obsession with the same girl (then woman) as his sociopathic genius best friend, which leads to trouble.
-   Jin from _The Pet Girl of Sakurasou_ remains loyal to his childhood friend Misaki, but becomes this instead as he feels unworthy of her.
-   Wickham of _Pride and Prejudice_ tried to seduce the hero's younger sister and succeeds in seducing the heroine's younger sister.
-   Daniel Leary of David Drake's _RCN_ series is an interesting example of this. Early on he's said, and shown, to be good enough at picking up women to make his living at it, and maintains this trait for several books. However, he also has perfectly good platonic relationships with women (usually female subordinates, but also notably Adele Mundy, who while technically a subordinate is really his Platonic Life Partner and effective first officer except in naval combat), and becomes a Ladykiller in Love in a later book after he meets Miranda Dorst.
-   _The Reluctant King_: Jorian easily seduces many women over the course of his adventures. Most of them seem drawn to him anyway, so he doesn't have to do very much.
-   Runge Margavo, one of the two titular bounty hunters from _Riesel Tales: Two Hunters_, is quite the connoisseur in regard to the large prostitution industry on Riesel.
-   Motoyasu from _The Rising of the Shield Hero_ is a brutal subversion. His entire party is made up of beautiful women, and while he believes himself to be a chivalrous Knight in Shining Armor who attracts women due to his good-natured personality, in reality he's a creepy lech (especially towards Filo), one of his party members (the evil and manipulative Malty) is only on his side so she can use and manipulate him into screwing over Naofumi, and none of his party members actually like him, only teaming up with him because of his status as one of the Four Heroes. Eventually, they all abandon him, and his ego is so thoroughly crushed that he becomes a raging misogynist, unable to hear any woman except Filo speak without hearing pig noises.
-   _The Silerian Trilogy_: Zimran is a shameless womanizer who continually seduces, beds and abandons numerous women (much to his cousin Jondalar's disapproval).
-   _The Stormlight Archive_: One of the reasons Adolin's relationships keep failing is because he has a shameless wandering eye.
-   Pufftail from _Stray_ is an elderly cat who has been with numerous females in his lifetime to the point where he mentions that he could have fathered hundreds of kittens. Like most cats, he courts them, mates with them, and then moves onto the next female. Pufftail has a one-year-old daughter, meaning he hasn't lost his touch in his old age.
-   _The Sunne in Splendour_: The first chapters of this historic doorstopper finds the futures Edward IV seducing his little brother's nanny as the boy gets lost in the woods. He doesn't reform and spends the rest of the book chasing women, even marrying for love though that doesn't stop him from taking many, many mistresses and fostering a Decadent Court.
-   Pretty common among the main male characters of the _Sword of Truth_ series. Nathan Rahl, the prophet, often badgers the Sisters of the Light to send women to his rooms while he is in his Gilded Cage, and can often be seen with a woman on each arm after getting out. Zedd is implied to have interactions with several women over the course of the series. Richard himself, while more content to just have his one significant other, still manages to end up married to three different women and have several more who want him. The male villains are darker versions of this.
-   Arthur Huntingdon in _The Tenant of Wildfell Hall_, who brags to his wife about his sexual conquests.
-   _This Side of Paradise_: Amory Blaine's greatest strength is his charm and beauty, which gives him big social grace, being able to dominate over other men and charm many women. This helps set him up as a "romantic egotist" who's interested in sex and gets himself into many romances with several women.
-   _Vampire Academy_:
    -   Andre Dragomir was not above seducing younger girls and eventually dumping them. Mia Rinaldi being the most notable example.
    -   Rolan Kislyak seduced and impregnated Sonya Belikova, moved on to her younger sister Viktoria Belikova, and tried to hit on Rose while still dating the latter.
    -   Adrian Ivashkov is seen to be a player, party boy and a womanizer who loves a lot of women.
-   Anatole Kuragin from _War and Peace_. He's a well-known womanizer whose first interaction with a semi-main character is Mademoiselle Bourienne, a maid at Prince Bolkonsky's house, while Anatole was there to court the prince's daughter Marya. He later marries the daughter of a Polish farmer in exchange for room and board during one military campaign, and then, just for fun, sets out to marry-and-kidnap Natasha Rostov.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Banshee_: Lucas has had sex with quite a few women in a short amount of time.
-   _The Brady Bunch_: Greg, who was once referred to as the "Casanova of Clinton Avenue" and truly was a Big Man on Campus. He truly did hit it off with a lot of the hottest-looking, mouth-watering babes of the early- to mid-1970s. However, this was comically inverted in the movie, where he was an awkward teen who was completely oblivious to the fact that not even the ugliest, fattest, most revolting girl in class didn't want him.
-   _Burn Notice_:
    -   Sam Axe of seems to make his _living_ "sponging off every rich divorcee in the greater Miami area."
    -   Charles seems to be Sam's Evil Counterpart, a womanizer who manages to seduce rich women into revealing their bank codes and bleed them dry. In comparison, Sam just finds himself a sugar-momma and provides genuine affection, company and is monogamous.
-   One Victim of the Week in _Castle (2009)_ is revealed to have had at least a room full of sexual conquests and a ledger of others. It turns out he was a "pick-up artist" who worked with two friends, one of whom admitted he struck out 90% of the time.
-   Sam Malone of _Cheers_.
    
    **Norm:** Ah, Sammy, watching you get ready for a date is like watching a great matador prepare for a bullfight.
    
    **Cliff:** I hate that stuff. You know, who wants to see a guy go and manipulate a torment a poor, unthinking creature like that?
    
    **Sam:** Hey, I always buy 'em breakfast, don't I?
    
    -   Deconstructed in later seasons when Sam starts getting jealous of his friends who are married and have kids. Eventually Sam admits he's addicted to sex.
-   Played with (as with pretty much _every_ spy trope) on _Chuck_. On several occasions Chuck is asked to pretend to be this, even though he's very much _not_. Outright parodied with Seduction School expert Roan Montgomery (another John Larroquette role). Despite his methods often being played for laughs, _they still work_.
-   _Community_:
    -   Jeff Winger is the first and most shameless example, shown to have the most active sex life of the group. In fact, he initially started the study group in order to get into Britta's pants, though it evolved beyond that quickly. In a season 5 episode it's mentioned that he keeps trophies of his conquests, which everyone else finds creepy.
    -   Pierce Hawthorne, being just an older and racist Jeff, has displayed this on several occasions. He often tells stories about his past sexual exploits with little to no prompting, and it's implied that he really is as successful as he claims. At one point he seduces a teacher with no difficulty whatsoever in order to save the class from a test that no one was prepared for.
    -   Abed Nadir, surprisingly. While he's a shameless nerd with an ambiguous disorder, his analytical abilities allow him to identify a girl's fantasy man, and then his knowledge of tropes and archetypes allows him to play that role perfectly. One episode has the study group trying to get him a girlfriend, only for him to reveal at the end that he can easily get a girl when he wants one, even if he normally doesn't care.
-   Patrick of _Coupling_ behaves like a cold-hearted seducer, unable to see women as anything but potential conquests, dumping his girlfriends almost immediately, and compiling a vast collection of sex tapes of his conquests. Interestingly, he avoids being loathsome, as he's portrayed as stupid rather than deliberately malicious.
-   Par for the course for a Leslie Phillips character, Dr. Cunningham from _The Culture Vultures_ is a womaniser always on the look for a lovely young girl.
-   Captain Jack Harkness in _Doctor Who_ and _Torchwood_ - omnisexual, promiscuous, but benign.
-   An episode of _The Equalizer_ had a handsome chronic womaniser get kidnapped by industrial spies who keep insisting that "she said she gave it to you" and refuse to believe his claims of innocence. Realising he's going to be tortured he quickly "confesses" and promises to get "it" to them in 24 hours — he then has to hire the Equalizer to help him sort though the multitude of women he's dated to find the right one. "It" turns out to be a microdot on a matchbook handed to him with a girl's phone number written on the inside.
-   Typical for a Leslie Phillips role, Dennis Proudfoot from _Foreign Affairs (1966)_ is a notorious womaniser.
-   _Frasier_:
    
    -   Bulldog
    
    **Bulldog:** \[on the phone\] Come on now. No tears. I'll never forget you either, Sandy. Linda? Really? I thought I was talking to your sister. Oh well, tell her same goes.
    
    -   Roz Doyle was always played as a female version of _this_ trope in particular, rather than just Really Gets Around. While the characters often cracked jokes about her promiscuity, they nearly always implied a predatory and perpetually lustful person who loved the chase and would jump through ridiculous hoops (including construct elaborate lies and hook her friends into facilitating hook-ups) in order to get laid, rather than misogynistic jokes indicative of a cheap slut, as would be expected in a comedy featuring a promiscuous woman. Also, Roz was always portrayed in a far better light than Bulldog because while Roz would sleep with loads of guys, she also had very clear standards that she rarely compromised (which is perhaps the reason her dates were so often men who required her to come up with hilarious schemes in order to get them to put out).
-   Lapeño in _Fur TV_ even gets commited in a sex addicts' clinic (and yes, he's a puppet).
-   _Game of Thrones_: Daario Naharis considers seduction one of life's two great pleasures.
-   _Hightown_: Jackie is a lesbian one, which is seen largely in the first season as she easily picks up a number of women, which includes her ex girlfriend, for sex. In the second season though Jackie then gets into a committed relationship with one woman, Leslie.
-   Barney from _How I Met Your Mother_. There's barely been an episode in the series where he hasn't hit on at least one woman, and uses a number of bizarre means to seduce them (which are surprisingly successful). For the most part, he only does well with bimbos and desperate women. In one episode Barney was revealed to have slept with 200 women (and counting). Marshall, while disgusted, decided to crunch the numbers based on the number of women Barney hits on on average every week and calculated (albeit with quite a bit of leeway) that based on that information and his years of sexual activity, Barney's success rate with women works out at a little over 1%. There's no telling if that is anywhere near accurate though.
    
    **Ted**: Does that ever work for you? (referring to one of Barney's numerous pick up lines and schemes)
    
    **Barney**: Ted, the question is do they ever _not_ work for me? Either way the answer is about half the time.
    
-   Al Mundy of _It Takes a Thief (1968)_ seems to pick up a new woman every episode, and even the ones who are initially frosty are charmed by him in the end. He doesn't seem to get much actual sex, though, because Noah always puts a stop to things just when the woman is softening up.
-   _The L Word_: Shane and Papi both easily pick up _many_ women, with each listing over a thousand conquests. Neither of them shows much interest in anything longer term (Shane tries once, but it falls apart). In one notable case, Shane seduces _three_ different women all at one wedding, two sisters and their mother.
-   _The Love Boat_: Dr. Adam Bricker, the ship's physician, picks up a different woman practically every cruise. Subverted when a fellow (married) doctor has to stay behind due to a colleague being sick and his wife sails without him. The man tells Adam to be sure she has a good time and \*she\* pursues \*him\*. Not wanting to betray his friend, he passes the duty off to Captain Stubing, who ends up hiding from her as well after she tries to seduce him, too.
-   Josh from _The Magicians_. Even though he's a nerd to the core, he's charismatic enough that he has just as many confirmed sex partners as his more conventionally-attractive castmates.
-   Napoleon Solo in _The Man from U.N.C.L.E._ cuts a wide swathe through various femmes fatale, female innocents, and the UNCLE secretarial pool.
-   Hawkeye Pierce in _M\*A\*S\*H_, although he occasionally takes a break to get his heart stepped on.
-   Before Nathan of _One Tree Hill_ fell in love with Haley, he was most definitely one of these, even if he was taken at the time. Haley is _not_ happy when, in Season 4, after they are married and pregnant, she finds out that Nathan made a sex tape with their friend Brooke (though it was before he even knew her).
    
    **Nathan:** You want me to write a list of every single girl I've ever...  
    **Haley:** No, no, I guess not every single girl. You can cross Peyton, Brooke, and my sister off of that list.  
    **Nathan:** You really think that's a good idea?  
    **Haley:** Yes! And here. I'll make it easy for you. Take the phone book and just cross off the name of every girl you haven't been with.
    
-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_: In "Flower Child", Chris' best friend Allan Montesi frequently teases him about his engagement to Mia as he regards marriage as being tantamount to a death sentence. He claims that he will never get married as he enjoys playing the field too much. However, Allan later admits to Chris that it is all an act and that he would a stable, monogamous relationship but he keeps Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places.
-   Simeon Lee in the _Poirot_ episode _Hercule Poirot's Christmas_ counts. During the time when he's mining for diamonds in South Africa in the Prolonged Prologue, he kills his mining partner Ebenezer and escapes into the desert. He is rescued by a young girl named Stella, and the two begin falling for and making out with each other. However, he has more important things to attend to, and so he deserts her without her knowing it, leaving her in despair. However, he (and the audience in particular) is unaware that he had left her pregnant with his illegitimate son, who would grow up to be Superintendent Harold Sudgen and plot his revenge against Lee for deserting him and his mother for 40 years, until he finally gets the chance when they arrive in England for a Christmas party.
-   _Queer as Folk (UK)_: Stuart has regular one night stands with many men.
-   _Queer as Folk (US)_: Brian Kinney almost nightly indulges in one night stands.
-   Samantha of _Sex and the City_ arguably is more of a female version of this than The Vamp or Femme Fatale, as her motivations are lust rather than being a "bad girl".
-   Dean Winchester on _Supernatural_. Dean's actually an interesting case, although he sleeps with a lot of women and is certainly lustful, it's implied on multiple occasions he genuinely would love to settle down and get married. But due to the nature of his job (being a Hunter of Monsters) it's too dangerous and impossible for him to have a truly stable relationship. As such he sleeps with multiple women, to help fill the void of what he knows he'll never have. This is confirmed during episode 10x16 "Paint it Black." Among many things in the episode that implied that Dean is ready to settle down, the scene with the priest in the confessional is probably the most telling:
    
    **Dean:** You know, the life I live, the work I do…I pretty much just figured that that was all there was to me, you know? Tear around and jam the key in the ignition and haul ass until I ran out of gas. I guess I just thought sooner or later, I’d go out the same way that I live – pedal to the metal, and that would be it.  
    **Father Delaney:** But now?  
    **Dean:** Now, um… recent events, uh… make me think I might be closer to that than I really thought. And…I don’t know. I mean, you know, there’s – there’s things, there’s…people, feelings that I-I-I want to experience differently than I have before, or maybe even for the first time.  
    **Father Delaney:** Go a little deeper, perhaps, than with Gina.  
    **Dean:** Yeah. Yeah, I’m just starting to think that… maybe there’s more to it all than I thought.
    
-   Latka's alter ego Vic Ferrari from _Taxi_, introduced at the end of Season 3 and the catalyst for a Split Personality problem that unfolded over much of the following season. This climaxed when he had to win back his old girlfriend Simka from Vic (whom he referred to as "a two-bit bossa nova"). Once he managed to convince her that Vic wouldn't actually love her, she was able to convince Vic to leave for good.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1985)_: In "Cat and Mouse", Guillaume de Marchaux describes himself as having a great talent for making love. He has spent centuries going from woman to woman, never spending more than a few days with one before getting bored.
-   The life of Charlie Harper in _Two and a Half Men_ largely revolves around sleeping around with women.
-   _The White Queen_: King Edward IV is introduced as a lecher who has "bedded every woman in his court" and who "has been through half the wives of London." Orgies are a pastime for him.
    
    **Duchess Cecily**: \[Edward\] has bastards all over England.
    
-   _The Witcher (2019)_: Jaskier has a history of sleeping with women who are married or otherwise off-limits and has done this many times.

    Music 

-   "Cowboy Casanova," by Carrie Underwood:
    
    He's a good time, a cowboy Casanova leaning up against the record machine,  
    Looks like a cool drink of water but he's candy-coated misery.  
    He's a devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes and he only comes out at night,  
    Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight, you better run for your life.
    

-   Selena Gomez: "Outlaw":
    
    Never stay very long anywhere  
    As the next girl you leave gets smaller  
    In you rear-view mirror
    
-   "Hot Girls in Love" by Loverboy is a Rare Female Example:
    
    Too many men to please  
    She counts them all on her Rosary  
    You know, you might get burned  
    She gets it when she can  
    I don't need no anniversary  
    And she deserves the best, yeah  
    A cut above the rest
    
-   "This Woman" by K.T. Oslin is also about a female version of this and she's telling a guy that she's a playgirl who isn't into long-term monogamous relationships:
    
    Right now I'm in love with you baby  
    This woman don't think you can do no wrong  
    But I only think it's fair to warn you
    
    This woman don't stay in love for long  
    This woman, this woman's gonna party
    
-   "I Loved 'Em Every One," a No. 1 country and top 40 pop hit by T.G. Sheppard. The cover of the album where the song came from even plays upon the song's main theme: the mysterious stranger who bounds into a number of young women's lives for what's ultimately (each time) one-night stands, and boasting of his conquests:
    
    Big or little or short or tall  
    Wish I'd have kept them all  
    Oh, I loved 'em every one  
    I'd like to thank them for their charms  
    Holding me in their arms  
    And I hope they had some fun
    
-   "The Wanderer," originally a No. 2 pop hit for Dion in 1962, and remade in 1988 by country music superstar Eddie Rabbitt (in a rockabilly style that was reminiscent of early 1960s rock and roll). This is another of the "mysterious stranger" type Casanovas, a handsome young man who romances all the desirable young women in town and he boasts of the girls that he's met and loved on ("There's Jo on my left, and Mary on my right/Janie is the girl that I'll be with tonight").
-   Cheryl Ladd's "Just Another Lover Tonight" has a female pick up artist.
-   "Heard It In A Love Song" by the Marshall Tucker Band.
-   "Baby Don't Get Hooked On Me" by Mac Davis.
-   "Why'd You Come In Here Lookin' Like That" by Dolly Parton.
-   "Living After Midnight" by Judas Priest.
-   The target/subject of "Down On Mission Street" by LLoyd Cole and the Commotions is a cold-hearted seducer who has just hurt his latest girl — though apparently, she initially picked him up.
    
    God only knows how you can hurt her  
    When you know that's what you do  
    How does it feel to be so cruel?  
    Will you never be contented with your life  
    Will you always be the one who won't look back?
    
-   The Catalogue Aria in _Don Giovanni_ enumerates the affairs of the main character.
    
    In Italy, six hundred and forty;  
    In Germany, two hundred and thirty-one;  
    A hundred in France; in Turkey, ninety-one;  
    But in Spain already one thousand and three.
    
-   Boogie Down Productions' "Super Hoe" is about DJ Scott LaRock's promiscuity.
-   _Nautilus Pompilius_: In the song "Casanova", the lyrical hero wants be the one.
-   Flanders and Swann: The man in "Madeira M'Dear" is a Casanova Wannabe at minimum, is described as "no stranger to vice", and when he scents success, secretly carves "one more notch/On the butt of his gold-handled cane", so he presumably has a record of success. However, he apparently employs booze rather than charm or looks for this purpose.
-   Ricky Nelson's "Travelin' Man":
    
    I'm a travelin' man  
    I've made a lot of stops all over the world  
    And in every part I own the heart  
    Of at least one lovely girl
    
-   The Decemberists' "Rake's Song" features a rake recounting murdering his own children so that he can be free to resume his escapades rather than live as a widower.
-   Zucchero: The song "13 Buoni Regioni" (13 Good Reasons) has Zucchero dedicate an unflattering song to a woman who is described indirectly as a maneater. In the song's video, the woman in question goes to a bar with her boyfriend, and when they reach the party hall she begins flirting very sensually with a stranger (a man of color); this upsets the boyfriend, who begins confronting the man despite his girlfriend being the one who _began_ the problem. Near the end of the video (and song), the boyfriend takes the woman (while forcefully holding her hand) to the parking lot and, after a brief fight, the woman pushes him and shoots a weapon taken out of her purse... though it's actually a water gun and the projectile is beer (it's ironic because, per the song's chorus, Zucchero says he would prefer to drink beer instead of being with her, thus hinting that he used to be a former partner of hers), so she simply intended to scare him. She then leaves him alone with a smirk, dumping him.

    Myth & Religion 

-   Older Than Feudalism: Zeus, king of the Greek pantheon, is depicted this way in Classical Mythology. They had very different values from modern Westerners, but note that in actual Greek _religion_, he wasn't viewed as this. Of course, this may have had to do with him being the King of Gods and having the power that implies. Another theory is that Zeus is something of an Amalgamated Individual with the collective dating history of every local thunder god / Top God ascribed to him (i.e. one thunder god being married to an unrelated fertility goddess becomes Zeus having kids with his sister Demeter).
-   Odin in Norse Mythology has many lovers. He is married to Frigg, but he's also lover of Freya and several giants. Nevertheless it is possible that this trait was exaggerated due to influence from the Romans or from Christian scribes who didn't mind accuracy when transcribing second-hand information about Pagan deities.

    Pinballs 

-   On the backglass art for _Eight Ball_, even as "the Fonz" playing pool with his girl, a waitress in the background is hungrily eyeing him.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   When Larry Dallas isn't giving a little extra support to one of "The Scene" wrestlers he "sponsors", he's surrounded by women, and rarely the same ones twice.
-   During the late 1980s, "Ravishing" Rick Rude and his gimmick of kissing a completely hot babe in the ring that he would choose from the crowd after winning one of his squash matches. (These were always a local girl hired before the show, but planted in the audience to give the impression Rude was picking them out at random.) This was used to push Rude's character as a "ladies' man" and Chick Magnet (although in reality, he had just gotten married).

    Tabletop Games 

-   Ma Ha Suchi from _Exalted_ was one of these in the First Age. Every character in _Exalted_ has a guiding Motivation. His was, "Sleep with every Celestial Exalted in Creation." It didn't hurt that he was _ridiculously_ Bishōnen. Then the Wyld happened to him...
-   One of the major traits of Elminster Aumar of Shadowdale, the great archwizard from the _Forgotten Realms_ setting, is that he'll flirt and/or sleep with just about anything that has two X chromosomes and isn't related to him. Just in his own novel series he's bedded humans, elves, a lich, several avatars of a goddess, and a song dragon in human form (and he sired a daughter with that one). The only thing keeping him out of Extreme Omnisexual territory is that he's straight.

    Theatre 

-   Count Almaviva, originally a good person in Gioachino Rossini's _The Barber of Seville_, has turned into a womanizer and a casanova who ignores his wife Rosina (whom he wanted to marry in _The Barber of Seville_) so he can make advances towards Figaro's fiancée Susanna in Mozart's _The Marriage of Figaro_. He even finds ways to delay Figaro and Susanna's wedding to keep on seducing her! However, Susanna finds his advances unwelcome, making him more of a Casanova Wannabe.
-   _Carmen_ from the title opera by Georges Bizet is often described as a rare female example of this trope. She seduces Don Jose, who was going to marry Micaela, but proves to be anything but faithful to him, quickly growing bored with him and seeking a new lover in the form of Escamillo, a toreador. We don't know how many times Carmen has done this to people, but when Carmen ultimately rejects him, Don Jose seeks to kill her, doing so in a bullfighting ring, spelling not only her doom, but his own as he is arrested by the authorities soon after.
-   Don Juan was the subject of Mozart's opera _Don Giovanni_ (of which we see an excerpt, _and_ a vaudeville parody, in _Amadeus_). As an interesting historical sidenote, both Mozart and his librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte, knew Giacomo Casanova personally, and it seems that Casanova gave Da Ponte and Mozart some advice on writing the character of Don Giovanni (among other things, he is said to have come up with the numbers Leporello quotes in "Madamina, il catalogo è questo").<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Even older than the original Casanova was the character Don Juan, whose first recorded appearance was in the 17th century Spanish play _The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest_.
    -   In psychology, a person who displays a need to dominate and have multiple sexual relationships with woman is said to have Don Juanism.
-   Aldolpho from _The Drowsy Chaperone_. He is the King of Romance, so he kisses a lot.
    
    "Dear Van De Graff bride, I must make love to you, and transport you to the place of ecstacy. Sooner is better than later. Signed, Aldolpho."
    
-   Lothario from the tragic play _The Fair Penitent_ is a heartless seducer who seduces and then abandons the female lead Calista, which drives Calista to suicide. As a result, the term "lothario" is often used for men who behave selfishly and irresponsibly in their sexual relationships with women.
-   Ben, the family Black Sheep from _Icebound_.
    
    **Sadie**: Always walks up to everything he sees in petticoats.
    
-   _Into the Woods_ has an amazing parody of this in the songs 'Agony' and the reprise by the two princes.
-   Alexander in _The New Moon_ is normally followed around by adoring Chorus Girls until he gets married to Julie in the second act.
    
    _Am I to blame  
    If women prize  
    My manly frame,  
    My sexy eyes?_
    
-   The Duke of Mantua in Verdi's _Rigoletto_ certainly qualifies, and is a Karma Houdini to boot. He doesn't even acknowledge Gilda's feelings for him and doesn't feel any remorse for deflowering her.
-   Rockof Ages has Stacee Jax; famous lead singer of Arsonal and womanizer.
-   Willmore from _The Rover_ by Aphra Behn is definitely this,his name literally means 'Wills for more sex',and he comes complete with Karma Houdini.
-   In _Spring Awakening_, handsome, creepy, and arrogant Hanschen Rilow is mostly played for laughs, though it's a little sad when he seduces his classmate Ernst. The scene they share is tragically unbalanced, given all the power Hanschen has over Ernst:
    
    **Ernst**: I love you, Hanscen, as I have never loved anyone.  
    **Hanschen**: And so you should.
    
-   Wagner's _Tannhäuser_ has Heinrich der Schreiber, an arrogant Minnesinger whom Princess Elisabeth is in love with and ultimately dies for. Heinrich never even acknowledges her, as he is busy engaging in debauchery with a Pagan goddess.

    Video Games 

-   _Assassin's Creed II_ has beat-up missions, which usually revolve around a woman looking for a random dude to beat up their cheating bastard husband. Hilarity Ensues when they are caught with their lovers, then beaten the shit out of.
    -   Plus Ezio himself, who gets compliments from every woman in Italy.
-   _Diablo_:
    -   _Diablo II_ indicates that Deckard Cain was this in his youth. He says about Anya being like some Zakarum priestesses he had known. He also says that they did not have to take vows of chastity. Do the math.
    -   _Diablo III_: Covetous Shen remarks on how he has so much in common with Cain, mentioning how the both of them had quite interesting experiences with the Zakarum priestesses in their youths.
-   Two of the potential home buyers from _House Flipper_: Jimmy Traitor and Raphael Erko. Jimmy's bio lists his likes as "parties, alcohol, girls" and both of them want a double bed so they can share it with a female companion. Jimmy also mentions wanting a sauna in his house so he has an excuse to ask his female friends to walk around in a towel.
-   Goto, from _Mana Khemia 2: Fall of Alchemy_, is seen going on dates with various students _in groups_ (as well as some one on one time with the Chairman). When the main cast doubt his claims of natural desirability they take a school-wide poll, only to find out that 100% of the girls want him as well as 1/3 of the guys, and the only reason the members of Ulrika's workshop aren't effected is he's purposefully toning down his charm around them. Then things get a bit complicated when the son of one of his old flings shows up looking for revenge...
-   In the Lair of the Shadow Broker DLC for _Mass Effect 2_, The Illusive Man is revealed to have slept with six Playboy-caliber women in the past week. One of them came back for seconds. But then again, so did the Asari matriarch.
-   Gannayev of _Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer_ regularly abuses his Spirit Shaman powers for the sake of jumping into the fantasies of innocent young farmgirls and having hot dream-sex, although most of his exploits occurred prior to the plot.
-   _Nibblers_: Octo sees himself as quite the charmer. He even tries to smooch a Lizard that tries to taunt him!
-   _Persona_:
    -   The protagonists in _Persona 3_ and _Persona 4_ can be this, depending on the player's decisions. If you're dating more than one girl and they discover what's happening, chances are you'll have to deal with some VERY pissed off girls and generally put the situation right. This is less so in _Persona 4_ where you won't be penalized as much,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  but you can still date/flirt with nearly every girl **in the game** (except for Hanako and Nanako, thankfully), AND you even get called an emotional heartbreaker during the cross-dressing pageant:
        
        **MC/Presenter:** "She" has made more girls cry than there are stars in the sky! Presenting our transfer student who's been breaking hearts in the second year Class 2, character name!
        
    -   _Persona 5_ is a lot less forgiving about dating more than one girl. Oh sure, you can have a romance with every single datable girl in the game at once, but they'll inevitably find out on Valentine's Day and respond by leaving you black and blue on the floor.
-   In _Pretentious Game 3_, the gray square is a womanizer who's been with several women. He marries the light pink square, and then cheats on her with the bright pink square.
-   At the beginning of _The Sims 2_, Don Lothario is engaged to Cassandra Goth, despite having a total of four lovers simultaneously.
-   Panther Caruso from _Star Fox_ relentlessly pursues Krystal, and is described more than once by Nintendo as being a self-proclaimed ladies' man. He never really gets anywhere with Krystal (who shares a mutual affection with Fox McCloud), whom tends to either ignore, humour or outright reject his advances in _Assault_ and their cameo appearances in _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_. Interestingly when he does succeed in certain paths of _Command_, he is depicted as genuinely devoted to her.
-   Zelos Wilder from _Tales of Symphonia_. Yeah he doesn't get anywhere with Tsundere Sheena, but any other woman in the game he addresses IMMEDIATELY fawns over him.

    Visual Novels 

-   Larry Butz from _Ace Attorney_, despite being The Ditz and The Friend Nobody Likes, has had a staggering number of girlfriends over the course of the series, all of whom were supermodels or in some other sort of glamourous profession where good looks matter. Granted, the main reason this number is so high is because they all dump him rather quickly...
-   _Amnesia: Memories_
    -   Spade World boyfriend Ikki has tons of women falling for him because of his eyes, and has had several relationships in the past, none of which have lasted longer than three months. His route reveals that this is a timelimit he has set himself because he believed most women that only loved him because of his eyes lost interest in him by then. He's also not the type of relentless playboy most people label him as, since he's looking for a meaningful, and longlasting relationship. Obviously, his route involves him finding true love with the heroine.
    -   According to his only on-screen appearance in Spade World, the heroine's father used to be one in his youth. He was dating multiple women, often leaving his daughter at home alone. He has been married four times, though his words show that he's stopped his casanova ways as he got older. His own past is why he's against his daughter having a relationship with Ikki.
-   Makoto from _School Days_ is flanderized into this about halfway into the story in the anime, and the visual novel allows you to decide whether you want him to go down that road. In the anime's ending and one of the game's bad endings, this comes back to bite him in the ass when he is murdered by one of his spurned lovers.
    -   Really, the anime version acts a deconstruction of the more malicious version of this trope: Makoto is skilled at bedding women almost to the point of straining credibility enough to push him into Kavorka Man territory considering his (not outstanding) looks and Jerkass attitude, but this shouldn't obscure the fact that when it comes to anything deeper and more lasting than this, Makoto is an absolute _idiot_ who doesn't understand the female heart at all, and indeed only turns to his life of serial affairs because he was too impatient and thick-headed to win the heart of the girl he had a crush on in the first place.
-   Itsuki in _SHUFFLE! and_ Tick! Tack!'' is pretty much always seen failing when he flirts with girls, but he's actually pretty popular. He has no known true relationships and it's hinted that he's actually in love with his friend Mayumi.
-   Leni and Seizh of _Under the Moon_ are twin kings of their high school; since they're actually devils with intense magical powers they can get away with anything. Including nailing any girl in school that strikes their fancy. Both boys have instant fan clubs of schoolgirls that they pick conquests from.

    Web Animation 

-   _Etra chan saw it!_:
-   _Tanabata Manga_: Tanao is a womanizer who likes to sleep with women and leave after he's done with them. Tanao's streak doesn't last after being rejected and ridiculed by FMC for his pathetic attempt to seduce her.
-   In Viktor's character trailer from _True Tail_, Viktor was laying a sofa with 4 different women swooning over him.

    Web Comics 

-   _Erika and the Princes in Distress_ : Kaylane just cannot look at a pretty boy without getting the urge to seduce them, and she has no qualms doing so even if their girlfriend are right next to them. She is seen on multiple occasions literally surrounded by swooning men, and clearly enjoying herself. She however tends to border on Lovable Sex Maniac when she goes as far as to kiss, pounce on, or tear the clothes of men unprovoked, and actually gets called out on that attitude by Irvine, who berates her for disregarding his friend's physical boundaries.
-   Zach, of _Girls with Slingshots_ is a positive version. Sure, he's slept with hundreds of women, but he sees it as a community service thing. He gives virgins a good first time and helps service the elderly to make them feel loved again.
-   El Chupecabre ("Chuy") from _Girly_ is irresistibly attractive to women. He took this as his calling and left a string of naked, immensely-satisfied women in his wake until Winter and Otra helped him to mend his ways.
-   Robert Lanyon from "The Glass Scientists" was a casanova in college, wooing younger, less experienced men into bed and ditching them as soon as they caught feelings. Deconstructed, as not only did this end in his father forcing him to marry to prevent him from being outed as gay in Victorian London, the one person he fell in love with never showed any romantic interest in him out of fear of being abandoned. It took years for them to admit their real feelings for each other, and by then, well, he wasn't just dating Dr. Jekyll anymore.
-   Ted from _Greg_, is constantly the target of women's scorned hatred. While he is not avoiding ex-lovers, he is seeking out new women to love and leave.
-   Jean's ex-boyfriend Slick in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ The only reason he becomes fixated on her is that she had the audacity to dump _him._
-   Joe Rosenthal in _It's Walky!_ takes this to the point of practically being another super-power: he managed to have sex with an astonishing 2030+ women before settling down with Rachel. This is all the more astonishing given his somewhat kavorka-ish horndog attitude: one time, he set out intentionally to sleep with 30 women in one day (to 'get the gay off of me' after having his head shoved in Walky's crotch in an attempt to obscure his face), and succeeded.
    -   While he stands out, he is hardly the only Abductee who is highly successful in bed, either - which is rather ominous given that the Aliens and Linda Walkerton apparently meant to _breed_ the Abductees to make the next generation of their Super-Soldier army.
-   Rayne Summers of _Least I Could Do_ even down to the extreme callousness. He's getting better, though.
-   _Magick Chicks_: Faith is a female womanizer, who has an established reputation for seducing half the student body at Artemis. And the girls are all eager to be her next conquest. But the one who has her heart, is the one girl she seemingly can't have: Tiffany... until the writers changed their minds.
-   _Ménage à 3_ is a Sex Comedy in which people actually have sex, so several members of the cast at least tend towards manifesting this trope. Two notable examples:
    -   Zii sometimes seems to have a borderline superpower, allowing her to seduce women who previously seemed straight — though this power eventually becomes a little patchy as her personal story becomes a little more complicated (just starting with her inability to seduce the insanely desirable DiDi). Zii has also slept with a lot of men, but it's not exactly difficult for her to do that.
    -   Matt is a highly successful bisexual seducer with frequently shaky ethics, although he's basically a Chivalrous Pervert aside from his inability to stay faithful to anyone.
-   _Oglaf_ has Mistertique, whose mastery of "the masculine mystique" makes him irresistible to women. He spends all of his time alternately seducing and confusing women, but usually doesn't sleep with them as it would "ruin the mystery." He's a bit of a troll.
-   Nolan from _Regular Guy_: Women seem to find his beard irresistible, and he had his "thingy" declared a work of art. He's pretty modest about it, though.
-   _Skin Horse_:
    -   Tip Wilkin. The other characters refer to it as his "superpower". Even more remarkable because he likes wearing women's clothing in public. Borders on a Kavorka Man, in fact, despite being _utterly_ charming — his success record is just too supernatural.
        
        "I'm also sure she's slept with Agent Wilkin, but that's true of anything with two X chromosomes that comes within 500 feet of Agent Wilkin."
        
    -   After meeting Artie in his human form\[1\] (and their subsequent bedroom athletics), this begins to apply to men as well.
    -   One of the scientist's at Project Skin Horse, Gerda, describes herself as Kinsey Seven, but she still drops everything to go watch Tip mud-wrestle with Husky Russkie Konstantin outside the office building.\[2\]
    -   When Tip was turned into a wolf in one story arc, all the genetically engineered battledogs who were female were suddenly drastically attracted to him.
-   Khun Edahn from _Tower of God_, father of Khun Aguero Agnes, has slept with so many women that he has the second largest amount of children in the whole Tower. There are so many, that in order to stop family feuds and succession wars, he has them perform in blood sports to establish a hierarchy.
-   Ian, of _What Birds Know_, is the town Casanova, making bets with his friends about how quickly he can date and bed girls. He's also oblivious to the crush his sister's friend Elia has on him.
-   Thomas the bard from _Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic_ is such a master at the game of love that he can have any woman he wants, even one who wants to clobber him. Take this comic for example, in which he demonstrates his prowess to Clover the halfling. He tips a waitress by flicking a coin into her cleavage, causing it to fall through the bottom of her dress and roll away. As she bends down to pick it up he smacks her on the rear. She understandably prepares to kick his ass, but he whispers _something_ in her ear that has her making out with him immediately afterward. All Clover can say after witnessing this is "Wow... you're good."

    Web Original 

-   Hugh Griffin, president of the \*USA in _Decades of Darkness_. As the author writes, his wife knows when to look away.
-   Zander, an Original Character from _Nepeta Quest 2011_, has quite the charm with the female trolls.
-   _Whateley Universe_:
    -   Don Sebastiano, or "The Don" (as he is also known), is a major campus supervillain, and enjoys romancing women. Once he's gotten what he's after he likes to dump them with as much public humiliation as he can arrange. He seems to enjoy the 'hurting them' part more than the 'boinking them' part, which makes this more like a Kavorka Man activity.
    -   Outside of Whateley Academy itself, the best-known example is Captain Courage, often called 'Captain Condom' for his apparent inability to use one (he had been the subject of hundreds of paternity suits over the brief span of his superheroic career, and supposedly fled the country to avoid being impoverished by child support payments).

    Web Videos 

-   Ask That Guy with the Glasses might be a Nightmare Fetishist rapist, but he's managed to get a lot of consensual male and female tail too.

-   Lorrenzo, one of Matt Santoro's clones. He frequently "gets some bitches", and is implied to sleep with them.

    Western Animation 

-   JFK from _Clone High_. He is dating Cleo, but openly cheats on her regularly (even calling her a "skank" for kissing Abe while mid-coitus with another girl), immediately sets up a casting couch to vet actresses during the film festival, and attends the school prom with Joan, Catherine the Great, AND the Brontë sisters.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_:
    -   Juandissimo Magnifico, who has every female fairy swooning over him (except Wanda).
    -   To a lesser (and less parodied) extent, Dr. Rip Studwell, Author Avatar and Author Appeal of Butch Hartman.
-   Glenn Quagmire from _Family Guy_. He is a step forward from being just a regular Casanova - he is a pervert, victimizer, and rapist as well.
-   Bender from _Futurama_, although he usually goes after hookerbots, and does fall in love occasionally.
-   TCFM on _Jimmy Two-Shoes_. His introductory scene has a three bodied Miseryvillian walk out of his home, the implications clear.
-   Boomhauer from _King of the Hill_. Despite the fact that most of his conquests don't seem to mind, he gets a cruel comeuppance when the tables are turned on him: the one woman who he does fall in love with turns out to not even be able to get his name right, and tells him, to his face, in the arms of another man, while he's on his knees after _proposing_ to her, that whenever he talks, she just nods and smiles until his pants come off. Ouch.
-   Tahno from _The Legend of Korra_. When he first appears, he has his arms around two women. He then proceeds to hit on Korra by offering her some private lessons.
-   Peter from _The Real Ghostbusters_ as his movie counterpart, although the series does mock sometimes his flintiness turning his advances in failures.
-   Mayor Joe Quimby from _The Simpsons_, who is an exaggerated, evil-mirror-universe parody of John F. Kennedy.
