Whenever anyone, or anything, stands between the light and a surface, you get a shadow.

Except for these characters.

It may, like a vampire's lack of reflection, indicate the character is not what he appears to be — down to and including that he's a copy of the real thing, or even just an illusion. It may show that someone stole his shadow. It may indicate that, Casting a Shadow, he has animated his into a Living Shadow, and it's elsewhere, or even that he's a Living Shadow himself. But it definitely indicates something uncanny's going on.

Does not, of course, include those where the medium or artwork ensures that all characters and objects have no shadows.

Don't ask what's supposed to happen if you look at a bright light source with these guys blocking it—nobody knows!

A Sub-Trope of The Shadow Knows, more cryptic than the usual ones, where the shape gives a clue what the issue is. (Unusual shadows belong there, along with the inversion where an invisible character casts a shadow; this covers only a total lack.)

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the _Black★Rock Shooter_ TV anime, Yuu has no shadow, as a sign that she had traded places with her other self.
-   In _One Piece_'s Thriller Bark arc, Brook (a living skeleton) casts no shadow. It's not really meant to emphasize his supernatural-ness (although he's supernatural already). Instead, he lacks a shadow because someone with a power to control shadows stole it and used it to reanimate one of his zombie minions. Later on, there are other pirates stuck there who also cast no shadow for the same reason. Having no shadow is a bad thing for all of them because sunlight will vaporize them, requiring them to have to avoid it. Luffy, Zoro, Sanji and Robin all lose their shadows until Moria's defeat.

    Comic Books 

-   One _House of Secrets_ tale makes the issue that having no shadow would mean invisibility a plot point. A scientist discovers that an opal was changed by radiation to absorb any shadow it touches, casting it again once light is shone through from another angle. Using it to capture the shadows of multiple objects, he successfully uses them to pull of a robbery, evading arrest when pursued by capturing his own shadow. Later, he reads in the news that the objects whose shadows he's taken have become invisible, before realizing the same has happened to him. The story ends with him contemplating confession and imprisonment on the chance both his shadow and visibility can be restored before it's too late.

Realizing this enables Bailey to catch and clobber Mirage.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _The Dark Eye_ high-ranking priests of the Nameless God will sacrifice their own shadows (and souls) to their patron. This makes them a little easier to identify than the rank-and-file of the cult, but they tend to be powerful enough by that point to more than make up for it. Mages who mess up while performing certain spells or rituals, or people who managed to attract the wrong kind of extraplanar attention can also lose their shadows and will frequently be mistaken for Nameless cultists, usually with fatal consequences.

    Theatre

    Video Games 

-   _Bendy and the Ink Machine_ has an unusual example that initially seems to "merely" be an extreme case of First-Person Ghost. However the New Game Plus has a secret message written on a mirror with Henry seeming to question if he's still human after noticing he has no reflection.
-   _Cultist Simulator_: Most advanced magic practitioners following the path of Lantern have this property - at least while they still have a physical body. In case of the ancient Shadowless Kings, it's not only in the name - even their old, dry bones still cast no shadow.
-   _Final Fantasy XIV_: The Ascians' name literally _means_ "without shadow", and they're **supposed** to be an example of this trope in their natural form (i.e. when not in borrowed flesh). Whether or not they actually demonstrate the trope during the game has been inconsistent due to issues with the rendering engine; at least one developer has joked that any natural Ascian that _seems_ to be casting a shadow is wearing clothes that are to blame, and any natural Ascian that _isn't_ casting a shadow is wearing nothing but body paint.
-   _Halo_: This is how you can tell that the opponent you're looking at in _Halo: Reach_ and _Halo 4_ multiplayer is actually their Hologram armor ability — though it looks right and can even move to a limited degree, the illusion won't have a shadow under it. The other way to find out they're a Hologram is to shoot or bump into them, causing a Hologram Projection Imperfection, but at that point the Hologram's owner has probably started shooting at you already.
-   The Final Boss of _Kirby and the Forgotten Land_ will attempt to heal itself once it loses enough of its health. While it charges the spell, it's wide open, so it tries to distract Kirby by creating two copies of itself. An eagle-eyed player will notice that neither of the copies casts a shadow.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons_: The wizard Agunima can create three copies of himself, which move about the room and attack Link independently. The two copies are invulnerable, but can be told from the real Agunima because they don't cast shadows.

    Web Animation 

-   The focus of the third episode of _Civil Protection_ is on a man who happens not to have a shadow. Mike and Dave theorize on why that might be, going from "he's a vampire!" to "bad light." When they try to trump up a charge to bring him in on, he suddenly has a shadow again. Mike doesn't care, ending up chasing him down the street so he can arrest the guy for jaywalking.
