**Mii 1**: Look, \[Mii 2\]!  
We're above the clouds!  
The clouds are so fluffy!  
**Mii 2**: Yeah, so light and soft!  
**Mii 1**: Yay!  
**Mii 2**: Wahoo!

In fiction, people can sometimes treat clouds as solid platforms to walk and stand on. It might be an intrinsic property of the clouds themselves, and so they're solid for everyone; other times, it's a special ability of the cloud-walker himself that somehow allows him to treat these floating bunches of water droplets as if they were hard rock, semi-solid ice that can be skated on, or a soft squishy waterbed, though the majority of works depicting solid clouds have them as soft fluffy pillows varying in size from large enough for one person to stand on to one the size of a terrestrial continent floating in the sky. Some works even depict clouds as being bouncy like trampolines for anyone on these clouds.

They might be used simply as transport or platforms to get high up. Sometimes people or gods and blessed souls live on them, removed from man's sight. Others use them as Cool Airships.

It's not difficult to see how this trope might have gotten started — clouds certainly _look_ nice and solid from the ground level, like big fluffy pillows (or big grey rocks, weather depending). You need to get quite close to them to see the only difference between clouds and fog is altitude.

-   The Flying Nimbus from _Dragon Ball_, which Goku rides around on before he learns to fly on his own, would probably apply. In a variation, its magic is such that it is solid only to the pure of heart. Impure people, like Master Roshi, fall right through.
-   The sky islands in _One Piece_ use various kinds of clouds, some of them solid (most notably the islands themselves).

-   An original animation short based on _Tamagotchi_ called "Mametchi's Picture Diary" primarily features Mametchi and his friends having fun at an amusement park, but later on they jump from cloud to cloud in the sky as well. Once they jump high enough into the sky, they catch sight of the Flying Library and board it, leading to them getting a neat view of Tamagotchi Planet.
-   In the third-to-last episode of _Smile PreCure!_, Joker traps Cure March and her Bad End counterpart in a Pocket Dimension where beanstalk-like arches rise out of a ground made of solid clouds.

    Comic Books 

-   In the Disney comic "Zio Paperone e i 'quattro passi' tra le nuvole", Uncle Scrooge seeks to heal his sore feet by learning the art of cloud-walking from a hermit master living in the world's tallest mountains. He actually succeeds at this, at first with special training shoes and finally without, and hereafter takes up regular walks in the clouds.

    Fan Works 

-   _Fallout: Equestria_: Following _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, only pegasi and other flying creatures can touch clouds. The Grand Pegasus Enclave uses clouds as building materials and security; it's impossible for Littlepip to hack Enclave maneframes or pick Enclave locks because they're all made of clouds. Since the vast majority of pegasi belong to the Enclave, that's a big advantage. Later, it's mentioned that since the Enclave never comes down from the clouds they have very little building material besides clouds. Their massive battleships turn out to be Glass Cannons because most of the important parts are clouds.

    Films — Animation 

-   "Mickey and the Beanstalk", a segment of the Disney film _Fun and Fancy Free_. The giant's castle rests on a solid cloud.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The first shots of _Mary Poppins_ feature Mary sitting on a cloud in the sky of London. There she powders her nose, puts her bag in place and _re-pitches_ her umbrella on the cloud.
-   _Interstellar_. Mann's planet is so cold that even the clouds have turned to ice. Although the movie generally tries to keep the science plausible, this is one of the more Artistic License – Physics examples. It is scientifically possible for ice mountains to form like that, but it's unlikely that they would take the shape of clouds in the process. Their existence was principally for the benefit of a visual gag.

    Folklore 

-   The Jewish folk hero Hershel of Ostropol once told a story in which he climbed a bee's rib bone to Fluffy Cloud Heaven, stopping to sleep on solid clouds along the way (he also got rainwater to drink and ate parts of the cloud when he got hungry). Of course, this particular Nested Story was him trying to win a bet by telling a story so ridiculous that nobody could believe it.

The latter power-up also lets them spawn their own temporary clouds to be used as platforms.
    -   In _Super Mario Sunshine_, when Mario sprays a cloud with FLUDD's water, its volume will increase.

    -   In _Bowser's Fury_, Mario can skate atop the semi-solid cloud platforms.
    -   _WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$_: One of the boss microgames has the player jump between cloud platforms in the high skies to reach a goal (a small pool of water) without falling down. The clouds _do_ vanish after being landed on once each, and some of them move either up and down or sideways, so the player needs to time their jumps wisely.
-   In Sky Sanctuary in _Sonic & Knuckles_, solid clouds serve as trampolines in order to reach higher areas. This is carried over into its appearance in _Sonic Generations_.
-   In _Mega Man 2_, there are solid clouds in Air Man's stage.

-   Clouds are solid in _Eversion_, but only on the third layer. They're decorative on all other layers.
-   _Atlantis no Nazo_ has boots that let you walk on clouds.
-   Averted in _Glider PRO_, where clouds aren't normally solid objects (though, in practice, they are often paired with invisible vents), since having them be actually solid would be a bad thing in _Glider_.
-   _Might and Magic: World of Xeen_ has a downplayed version on the top of every tower on both sides: The clouds aren't actually _solid_ — you'll fall down and take a lot of damage if you just try to walk out on them — but they _do_ count as ground for the purposes of the Levitate spell.
-   The cult-founded town of Meriloft from _Broken Age_ is situated on an assortment of clouds, but several characters do mention the important of maintaining a large surface area while staying light, at least.

-   _The Trader of Stories_ features clouds that are not only solid (they can be caught in nets and broken apart and sewn back together), they're used as a food source by the Cloud Eater (an elephant/giraffe/brachiosaur ...thing) and have sleep-inducing properties. This is due to them being the dreams of a gigantic oak tree worshipped as a god.
-   _Golden Sun: Dark Dawn_ has clouds that form around Zol, a solid mineral that floats when exposed to Jupiter Psynergy. With a big Psynergy injection, they allow the player to cross a mountain range.
-   _Moshi Monsters_ has an entire village made of clouds, which can be visited and lived in no problem.

    Western Animation 

-   Clouds in _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ are a strange example. The only ponies who can interact with them as if they are solid are pegasi, whose job as a race is to manage the weather, although griffons and flying animals can sit on clouds as well. Clouds also serve as an Empathic Environment for flying creatures, e.g. parting to allow ducks to hide in them or a pegasus to swim through them as though they were a pool of water, and a white cloud may become a Personal Raincloud if landed on by a depressed pegasus. For most other ponies, clouds act as they would in real life without magical assistance. The ability to interact with clouds as if they were solid objects is specifically part of the pegasi's inherent magic, and that other ponies cannot do this without outside magic being cast such as a cloud-walking spell that allows other species to do it as well, if only temporarily. Many pegasi are shown to make their homes directly in the clouds, ranging from individual floating cloudhouses like Rainbow Dash's to entire cloud cities such as Cloudsdale.
-   Care-A-Lot, home of the Care Bears, is a land of clouds that are solid enough to stand on, but soft enough to poke one's head through to observe the world below. It helps that they are ursine beings not native to Earth.
