_"Do your dreams change, (name)? Mine do not. I have one dream..."_

The more often you have a dream, the more important it is. If you're Dreaming of Things to Come, the upcoming event is even more plot-significant than you thought. If someone's Talking in Your Dreams, they want to make _really sure_ you get the message. And if it's not psychic in origin, but a plain old Flashback Nightmare or indeed any form of Past Experience Nightmare, you know the event involved _really_ bothered the dreamer. (That last is Truth in Television; the symptoms of PTSD can include recurring dreams of the traumatic experience.) As is having Anxiety Dreams when you are _really_ worried about stuff.

Deep Sleep often can prevent it.

This gets subverted, usually for comedy, with a character having a persistent, bizarre dream that has nothing to do with anything. A recurring "Not Wearing Pants" Dream or Guilt-Induced Nightmare is a common example. Compare and contrast Plagued by Nightmares, where a character's consistent bad dreams are a sign of personal issues.
