Success often breeds resentment, with one popular form of resentment being accusations of foul play. One byfion that some people like to make is that a person's success came from seducing people.

The motivation for making this type of accusation can vary, but the usual reason is envy and/or resentment. A sexist man might accuse all successful women of using their looks/sex to get ahead under the belief that women are incapable of achieving success on their own merit. An attractive person might be accused of using their looks by envious parties who don't want to acknowledge that a person can be both attractive and competent. Hateful and/or envious people in general might do this because it's more comfortable to assume that a disliked person's success is the result of trickery rather than hard work.

Due to Double Standards, attractive women are more likely to be the targets of these types of accusations, the reason being that a man's success is almost always assumed to be due to his own merit regardless of his looks, while unattractive women are seen as having no choice but to work hard because of their lack of looks. Meanwhile, attractive women are often assumed to have used their looks, flirtation, sex, etc. to get ahead, regardless of how hard they worked. See also Never a Self-Made Woman (though of course this trope doesn't solely apply to women).

Compare Slut-Shaming. Overlaps with Malicious Slander if someone is trying to ruin someone's reputation via this, Sextra Credit if someone claims that someone got high grades via sex, Casting Couch if someone accuses an actor of sleeping with people for roles, or Sleeping Their Way to the Top if someone claims that a high ranking person slept their way to their position. Straw Misogynists and He Man Woman Haters are likely to do this towards women. Contrast Sex for Services where a character really _did_ trade sexual favors for non-sexual ones, and Sexual Extortion where a character _demanded_ sex in exchange for a non-sexual favor.

-   _Harleen_: Harley Quinn is accused by gossips of sleeping with her supervisor to get her psychology qualification (which she may have done in some other continuities), but the story points out that it would be impossible for anybody really unqualified to do that in modern times, due to degrees needing the approval of much more than one person.

-   In the _Anastasia Kamenskaya_ series by Alexandra Marinina, especially in the earlier books, there are rumors that the titular character sleeps with her boss Gordeyev and gets special treatment at the Criminal Investigation Department of Moscow (a separate office, regular rewards, etc.) for that reason, rather than because she is a brilliant detective. Anyone who knows Gordeyev and Kamenskaya at least somewhat well is aware that the rumors have no base in truth: there has never been any romance, platonic or sexual, between the two.
-   _The Callista Trilogy: Darksaber_: Admiral Daala relates to her Number Two Admiral Pellaeon that during her rise through the Imperial Navy, a disgruntled male officer accused her of sleeping her way to the top—with some cause, given she was Grand Moff Tarkin's mistress at the time. Tarkin reacted quite poorly to this and threw him out an airlock in a decaying orbit with his spacesuit's radio locked in the "on" position so that everyone on the planet could hear his screams as he burned up on reentry.
-   _Ciaphas Cain_: Commissar Beije suspects Magot (a trooper in Cain's regiment who punched out a boxing champion from Beije's misogynistic regiment when he refused a normal match) got off lightly due to sleeping with Cain.

Taylor does question her authority and methods, however the two gain a mutual respect for each other.
-   In _Halt and Catch Fire_, Gordon becomes frustrated when Cameron's section of the Giant project advances faster than his (largely because Cameron is a genius programmer, whereas Gordon is an alcoholic engineer) and thus spreads a rumor that she's getting more resources because she slept with their boss, Joe. Cameron turns the table on him by passionately kissing him in front of his subordinates and publicly implying that they had sex the previous night. As Gordon is married with kids, he decides to squash any further rumors about Cameron's sexual history so that nobody spreads rumors about her sleeping with _him_ to his wife.
-   _Mad Men_: Peggy mentions that people think she had to have slept with Don because how else does a newly-hired secretary suddenly get promoted to copywriter?

More importantly, it was Freddy Rumsen who saw Peggy's potential (in "Babylon"), not Don.

    **Vivian:** Warner. _Shut up._

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Adastra_, the titular moon is inhabited by a strictly patriarchal civilization of wolves.

    Webcomics 

-   Some readers of _The Order of the Stick_ were uncertain why Vaarsuvius is enraged by their being mistaken for a warlock. Forum user **SPoD** used Success Through Sex Accusation as a simile to explain the reason for Vaarsuvius' response:

_"A wizard being called a sorcerer is sort of like having a PhD and someone telling you that you only managed to graduate because you have natural talent.  
A wizard being called a warlock is like having a PhD and being told you only managed to graduate because you gave the dean a quickie in the alley behind the movie theater."_
