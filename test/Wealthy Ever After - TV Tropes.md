An ending trope, where the protagonists become rich.

Usually, the writers want to avoid the Hard Truth Aesop that money can buy happiness, so this is only added _after_ the generic Happy Ending tropes, such as love, or family, so it is not actually money that makes them happy, but it surely doesn't hurt either.

It might be an example of Sweet and Sour Grapes, if the characters just learned the Aesop that there are more important things than money, but they get rich anyways.

Compare If I Were a Rich Man. The Standard Hero Reward can overlap, as being given half the kingdom tends to make someone wealthy.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    Film — Animated 

-   In _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_, the real reason why the explorers went to Atlantis is just so they can help the villain become rich. However, at the end of the film, said explorers turn to the hero to stop said villain and save Atlantis, yet they still end up rich because of this, judging by their clothing the last time we see them. It's implied that the Atlanteans are quite wealthy, by normal standards. However, because their city is isolated and in ruins they've come to consider things like food and creature comforts more important than treasure. Given that the explorers saved Atlantis at great personal risk, it makes sense that the city's people would reward them.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Harold Lloyd was fond of this trope. His typical Happy Ending was Boy Gets Girl, Boy Gets Rich. Examples include _Safety Last!_ and _Speedy_.
-   _Run Lola Run_. Lola wins a ton of cash from a casino to help her boyfriend, who had a bag of money that he was supposed to deliver to a mob boss stolen by a homeless man. But before she can give him the money, her boyfriend runs into the homeless man and takes back the money, so they end up with more money than they need.
-   _Paycheck_ ended with the protagonists winning $90 million lottery. By seeing the future.
-   _It Could Happen to You_: In a beautiful twist, they were destitute, but took in a homeless man to give him soup when they could ill afford to share anything. That homeless man was a reporter for the NY Times who described them as kind, gentle people who were not bitter they'd been made destitute. And then the donations came pouring in, making them rich again. Meanwhile, the selfish harpy that took all their money gets all of it stolen by a con man and is forced to move back in with her mother and return to her old job in a nail salon.
-   _National Treasure_ had the museums paying 1% of the treasure's value to the protagonists. It was stated a few times the treasure was worth about $10 billion US dollars<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , so even 1% set them for life.
-   In _The Gold Rush_, Chaplin and Big Jim find the mountain of gold at great personal risk and the story ends with them leaving the Klondike rich.

-   _Slumdog Millionaire_ ends with the protagonist, who grew up in poverty, winning the game-show and its enormous prize.
-   The end of _The Mummy_ finds Rick and Evy riding off into the sunset on a camel that is, unbeknownst to them, loaded down with treasures. Their giant house in the sequel indicates that they've made a pretty good living with the grave robbing.
-   When Marty McFly fixes his parents' past in _Back to the Future_, he returns to a present where his father George is a wealthy science fiction author. Interestingly this ending didn't sit right with Crispin Glover (George's actor), who felt it sent the wrong message and didn't return for the sequels.

-   Many heist movies (_Ocean's Eleven,_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  _Fast Five_, _The Italian Job (2003)_ for example) end with the (surviving) members of the crew reaping the rewards of their heist.

    Literature 

-   _Battle Royale_ has the government support the winner of each battle royale with a lot of money to settle with. Shogo admits that he's got enough money to not have to worry about, but admits that it's 'a lot less' than advertised. Given how the book's latest round ended, with two survivors escaping the game, Shuuya and Noriko are obviously not given money.
-   In _The Belgariad_, Loveable Rogue Silk exploits the end of the war between the Angarak nations and the West to establish an international trade consortium with a like-minded Angarak partner. By the _Malloreon_ sequel series, he's one of the richest people on the planet... although to him, the real reward is in the game of commerce, and the money is just an incidental way of keeping score.
-   In the _Doctor Who_ Expanded Universe novel _The Gallifrey Chronicles_, former companion Anji turns out to have become one of the richest women in Britain because Trix, while traveling with the Doctor, managed to send her financial information from the future. Since Fitz and Trix have decided (for the time being, anyway) that they want to settle down together, she cuts them in on it.
-   Older Than Dirt: The Ancient Egyptian tale "The Eloquent Peasant" apparently ends with the protagonist Hunanup richly compensated for his troubles and rewarded for his eloquence with numerous goods confiscated from the household of Djehuty-nekht, the man who had wronged him.
-   At the end of the final book in Dean Koontz's _Frankenstein_ series, Mr. Lyss wins the lottery.
-   _The Hobbit_ has Bilbo returning to Hobbiton rich, although he could take home much more treasure if he felt it worth the bother.

-   In _The Hunger Games_, the Capitol awards the winner of the Games more money than they can spend in a lifetime. The ending to the actual book series doesn't reveal if Katniss and Peeta get to keep that wealth, however.
-   _Jane Eyre_ inherits £20000 (which back then was a _lot_ of money) from her long-lost uncle close to the end of the story. Being the kind of person that she is, she shares it with her cousins, dividing the money equally between four people; yet even after that she's left quite wealthy.
-   Sara Crewe from _A Little Princess_, after Mr Carrisford finds her and adopts her and the investment that her father had put into was actually worth much, much more than they thought.
-   By the end of _Mara, Daughter of the Nile_, Mara has realized that there are things that are far more important to her then freedom and gold, her motivations at the beginning. However, she ends up receiving both of them anyway, one through a boon of the new king, and the other through marrying her love, Count Sheftu.
-   Marius and Cosette at the end of _Les Misérables_ when Jean Valjean gives them all the money he earned while he was mayor of Montreuil-sur-mer. Marius' aunt and grandfather are very pleased; Marius and Cosette themselves are too absorbed in their love to take any notice.
-   _Ready Player One_ has Wade Watts become a quarter of a _trillion_ dollars richer by winning Halliday's contest. He ends up sharing it with his surviving friends for working with him.
-   _The Warlock O' Glenwarlock_ by George Mac Donald (alternative title: _The Laird's Inheritance_) ends with Cosmo Warlock discovering a great treasure within the walls of the family keep. After, of course, learning that money doesn't really matter if you have faith in God and a good heart.
-   _Night Watch Discworld_: Supporting character Doctor Lawn (whose character is a parody of exactly who you'd expect), a man who's spent many years barely scraping by despite being a damn good doctor because his medical knowledge is ahead of its time and at odds with the current scientific consensus, finally gets his chance to shine when he's called upon to save the Duchess of Ankh from Death by Childbirth. Not only does he become the toast of the town with enough professional clout to make people take him seriously, the grateful Duke personally hands him an _enormous_ sum of money. On the condition that he keeps quiet about the Time Travel shenanigans said Duke got dragged into, which is how they first met several decades ago. By the time he pops up again in _Going Postal_ he's a lot more mellow.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Played straight in the _Amazing Stories_ episode "Gather Ye Acorns". A small elf tells a kid to forget about studying to be a doctor and that hard work is not a virtue. "There's doctors aplenty is this world," he says, "What we could truly do with is a few more dreamers." We switch from 1932 to 1938 and he winds up spending all his hard-earned money on a fancy car. His dad is a little peeved, to say the least, and boots him out of the house. Years go by and the boy is now old, broke, friendless, homeless and trying to beg for enough money to gas up his car to commit suicide with it. But a wealthy lady notices some collector's piece in his collection of junk and offers him $10,000 for it. Cut to him now wealthy from selling all his childhood collectables.

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Doomsday": Rose and Jackie are Trapped in Another World, but they're living with the Alternate Universe version of Pete Tyler, who's very rich from his successful businesses.
    -   "Voyage of the Damned": Mr. Copper the tour guide loaded a credit card with a million pounds, thinking it was only good for trinkets.

    -   "The End of Time": The Doctor's wedding present to Donna is a lottery ticket.
-   This would have been the ending to _Only Fools and Horses_, if it hadn't been brought back five years later. But at least it allowed Rodney to find out who his real father is, and become a father himself. Played as a very slightly Bittersweet Ending, surprisingly, as Del-Boy gloomily reflects on every Zany Scheme and desperate hustle Rodney and himself have been through just trying to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads when all this time there's been a ridiculously valuable antique watch gathering dust in the cupboard all along and wonders if it was All for Nothing.

-   The last season of _Roseanne_. Until the last few minutes of the final episode reveal that it's All Just a Dream, anyway.
-   _Wings_ ended with Joe and Brian finding money left to them by their father (the money they were searching for in the very first episode), then having to decide how best to use it.

-   As the Soap Opera _Loving_ wound down and prepared for its transition into _The City_, a rather obnoxious character won the lottery and threw it in the faces of everyone who'd snubbed her before.
-   The final scene of _The Red Green Show_'s "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue shows Red dressed in an impeccable suit seated in what looks to be a posh mansion. Red himself doesn't say what he did to achieve this. Maybe the royalties from the show finally kicked in?

    Video Games 

-   Played for Laughs in _Rayman 2: The Great Escape_ in the Cave of Bad Dreams level when Rayman is given a choice between the Elixir of Life that will allow him to continue his quest, or get the mountains of treasure hoarded by the Guardian. If you choose the latter, you get a Non-Standard Game Over ending where Rayman simply forgets about saving the world and retires to a "Far Side" Island. Of course, because the game can't actually end on such a lousy note, you return to the Guardian's offer until you make the right choice.

    Visual Novels
