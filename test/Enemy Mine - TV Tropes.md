How Denmark made Iran and Iraq agree on something.

"_Look, even if you think we're still enemies, we're enemies with a common interest: revenge. You like revenge, right?_ EVERYBODY likes revenge! _Well,_ let's go GET SOME!"

_"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."_

An Enemy Mine is a scenario where foes must work together to achieve a common goal. (The trope name comes from one particularly famous example.) Note that this is different from Villain Team-Up or Legion of Doom: although all three involve two parties working together to achieve a common goal, this trope usually involves two rivals/enemies that have opposing views (such as being good vs being evil) while the latter two involves characters that share similar views (such as both of them are evil), though they don't necessarily like each other.

This type of team-up usually starts with the villain coming to the hero's aid, usually saying that a certain threat is a danger to them both, or "No one kills you but me!" when they save the hero from certain doom. May arise from a Mexican Standoff. After the team-up, the villain will usually let the hero live for now because they were so useful, so everything can return to status quo.

Frequently, if it is a goodie-baddie partnership, the baddie will look for opportunities to pull something that gets them a profit (or, in the case of _really_ bad baddies, allows them to stab the goodie in the back). If the villain doesn't betray the hero right away, but there is still animosity between them while they are working together, then you have Teeth-Clenched Teamwork. If the Status Quo is not maintained, there could be a creep towards Friendly Enemy status. Can become a Heel–Face Revolving Door if it happens more than once.

Sometimes the baddie is more the hero's Worthy Opponent than a villain and the external threat will be truly evil. In this case, the hero will recognize that the third party is the bigger/more dangerous threat and the Worthy Opponent will be offended that the third party intruded on a 'private game'. Afterwards, it's a pity to see them go back to their old rivalry, because together they're an unstoppable fighting force. (If they _don't_, they've become Fire-Forged Friends.)

Finally, this is an opportunity to show the villains as being more competent than they typically are. While they're defeated by the heroes week after week, the bad guys can actually contribute to the defeat of whatever threat they're teaming up with the heroes against.

More short-term deals fall under Cooperation Gambit. When there's no common enemy _per se_, it's Go-Karting with Bowser. If the villain saves the day without the hero's help, then Bad Guys Do the Dirty Work. If the villain in question is possessing the hero, but there's a greater threat the two must conquer together, this can result in a Symbiotic Possession. Any western children's show is bound to have the main characters do this with their local Mr. Meanie at some point.

Compare Nominal Hero (where a character fights for good even though their intentions are not heroic at all), Mediation Backfire (where someone tries to get between two quarreling characters, only for them to put aside their differences to abuse the peacemaker) and Conflict Killer (where someone suddenly and permanently defuses the conflict of others, causing the others to join forces against the former). Also compare Embarrassing Rescue and Gondor Calls for Aid. See also Enemy Civil War or Elves Versus Dwarves (with which it often overlaps). Anti-villains are more prone to this trope than most, and less likely to backstab the goodies afterwards. Contrast with Personal Hate Before Common Goals and We ARE Struggling Together, where you have putative allies who end up backstabbing and/or infighting with each other. When this trope is averted completely, one has a Mêlée à Trois or Mexican Standoff. See also An Offer You Can't Refuse, Colliding Criminal Conspiracies, Contempt Crossfire, Do Well, But Not Perfect, Genghis Gambit, Inevitable Mutual Betrayal, Tall Poppy Syndrome. A defining feature of the Standard Sci Fi Setting. May be a result of the Good and the Bad teaming up in a The Good, the Bad, and the Evil scenario. It can be caused by The Horseshoe Effect. It can be incredibly common in stories of Evil vs. Evil and Evil Vs Oblivion when a villain decides to defeat another villain (by proxy saving a hero or even aiding them) due to not wanting the other villain to succeed. A common justification for one villain joining heroes to defeat another villain is that Even Evil Has Standards.

We sincerely hope that you did not have a slip of the finger and ended up here instead of at Enemy Mime. For an enemy that _is_ a mine, see Action Bomb, and for a different kind of mine which is filled with enemies, see Dug Too Deep. As might be gathered by this point, this article is also unrelated to passive defensive weapons planted by one's foes. Also not related to mines of the underground type; for that, see Underground Level or Minecart Madness. Wholly unrelated to Quote Mine, which refers to the propaganda tactic of being very particular in quoting someone the propagandist disagrees with to convey an inaccurate conception of their actual opinion and/or why they said that.

    Comic Strips 

-   The Fox siblings of _FoxTrot_ have teamed up on each other in every possible combination (Peter and Paige vs. Jason, Peter and Jason vs. Paige, Paige and Jason vs. Peter).
-   A hilarious example occurs in _Peanuts_, when Lucy arrives one day to find that Frieda was in her claimed territory (Leaning on Schroeder's piano). Dejected, she and Snoopy (who also enjoyed lying there and listening to piano music), commiserate on a curb... until Snoopy comes up with the idea of Lucy doing Snoopy's own famous aerial attack on Frieda. One swirling girl-fight later, a slightly battered (yet victorious) Lucy is shaking Snoopy's paw in thanks.
-   Spoiler alert for every _Spy vs. Spy_ strip where the spies set aside their differences or work together: one betrays the other.
-   One _Garfield_ short has Garfield and a guard dog threatening each other, with Garfield being intimidated by the dog's massive teeth while the dog is equally intimidated by Garfield's claws. It ends with both of them smirking evilly at the reader:

    Game Shows 

-   It happens on _Taskmaster_ on the first episode of Series 7. The contestants are tasked with putting fruit on their hats using long garbage-pickers. Rhod offers to Phil to collaborate and do _each other's_ hats, knowing this will give them a huge advantage and easily net one of them first and one of them second, which then inspires Kerri and Jess to do the same. This leaves poor James far behind, all by himself, helplessly floundering to get fruit on his own head. Greg actually feels bad enough for James that he gives him a bonus point.
    
    **Greg:** Obviously James crashes into last place. But I'll tell you this: seeing him scrabbling around on the floor, seeing his desperate cries, there was something heartwarming about that. Subsequently I've decided to award you two points. Congratulations.
    

    Podcasts 

-   Dr. Bright, the titular character of _The Bright Sessions_, would rather keep Damien out of the AM's hands and on her side, even if it means being forced to give him free therapy and endure his stalking. Although Damien doesn't always necessarily agree with Dr. Bright and seems to go out of his way to make her life difficult, he claims he would never hurt her and that he sees her as the big sister he never had. He also points out that they're not only confidants, but also the closest thing either of them has to a friend. When Agent Green first contacts Damien, the latter first refuses to believe Dr. Bright told Agent Green about Damien's ability. Even after accepting it, he refuses to go to the AM, stating, "Dr. Bright doesn't trust you, and I trust her." Later, Dr. Bright apologizes to Damien and asks for his help infiltrating the AM. Things don't go well and their relationship never recovers, but Dr. Bright does later express sadness that she wasn't able to help Damien.

-   In the _Red Panda Adventures_ episode "Stop the Presses", the Red Panda is forced to work with his self-proclaimed arch nemesis the Mad Monkey when Nazi spy Archangel arranges a hostage situation at the newspaper where his wife and partner, the Flying Squirrel, works. This results in situations such as the Red Pandas getting the willies when the Monkey uses the Squirrel's catchphrase of "Yes, Boss" at him and arguing about whether or not using their combined hypnotic powers to make their enemies ignore them counts as invisibility. In the end, they stop Archangel but the Mad Monkey reveals that while all this has been going on his army of mind controlled baboons has been robbing the city and he gets away because the Red Panda can't chase him _and_ tie up Archangel's goons.

-   _Doctor Who The Abridged Series_ lampshades it in part two of _Logopolis Abridged._
    
    **Master**: You know, Doctor, I believe TV Tropes calls this situation "Enemy Mine". It seems we must join forces to face this common threat.
    
    **Doctor**: -sigh- The fangirls are going to have a field day with this...
    
-   About halfway through the play-through of the Bowser's Enchanted Inferno episode of Mario Party TV, the other three players realize that Steeler has all three of the bonus stars, and team up against him in minigames. Steeler did not approve.

-   Obscurus Lupa talks about this in one of her reviews in relation to the gay marriage debate. She notes that, whatever your views on the subject, it's pretty likely that both sides will be united in finding _Ben and Arthur_ offensive.
-   In the _Oxventure_, this has happened a few times:
    -   In "Quiet Riot", the surviving Knight Templar paladins offer to help the Guild in a blind panic after the noise of their fighting wakes up a captive owlbear. They accept, but it turns out to not be necessary.
    -   In "Rolling in the Deep", Prudence and the rest of the Guild are collectively forced to work alongside her late mentor's old order — who hate her for killing him (though he was abusive) — to clear out his old cave.
    -   In "Exhibition Impossible", Captain Panniers resurfaces and proposes a deal with Corazon to retrieve the last of the cursed coins that have rendered their mutual old crew as undead revenants. By that point, however, Panniers is fairly enlightened and considerably more mellow, having no desire for revenge any more, meaning the "enemy" bit is a stretch.
-   In UA:LA, Hero and Stacks join together to fight off Heiki and his fellow villains after Hero tries to stop Heiki from having Stacks killed.
-   The dive into the Korean Pop Music fandom by ColeyDoesThings shows how much bickering and sniping at each other various subsections of the fandom take at each other via personifications of each, but at the end when a non-fan bursts into the room and pleads for their help in combating racist material appearing online they all agree to put aside their feuds in order to go off and fight back.
-   _SMPLive_: Both Travis and Cooper have a strained at best, negative at worst relationship with Carson, and this can even be seen while they are building the ACC base, with Cooper nearly _killing_ Carson out of annoyance.
