_"And Ye Shall Know The Truth And The Truth Shall Make You Free."_

The **C**entral **I**ntelligence **A**gency... _The_ Agency.

After World War II, the OSS was disbanded. With the onset of the Cold War, it was decided that a new intelligence agency was needed. The name "Central" reflects that it was originally supposed to be a clearinghouse among various other agencies. However, it became effectively a new OSS and acquired many veterans from that previous service. Originally, the agency hired people from the Ivy League that had a Foreign Culture Fetish for England. They dressed, talked, and acted like the English. In this period of desk gathering intelligence, the pipe-smoking professor was seen as the ideal officer.

The CIA has been controversial, having at times been accused of incompetence, immoral actions, or both. Notably, the Church Committee hearings of 1975 revealed a long history of abuses, from domestic espionage to assassination plots against foreign leaders, which cemented its often-negative portrayal in the media - later scandals like Iran-Contra and its failure to predict either the fall of the Soviet Union or the 9/11 terror attacks did nothing to assuage this. In some fictional portrayals, they are often regarded as being The Men in Black or an omnipotent "secret government" that pulls the strings on American foreign policy behind the senes. This portrayal is undoubtedly an exaggeration, as if the CIA was really that skillful, we might ask why it took us so long to win the Cold War. Of course, maybe that's what they wanted.

Nonetheless, the CIA has had its successes. For instance, a large part of the reason for the United States winning the contest of gigantic Death Glares that was the Cuban Missile Crises is that America had a mole telling the U.S. government that the Soviets had less capacity than they claimed. Then again, said mole, Oleg Penkovsky, was later ratted out and executed<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and was first discovered and contacted by MI6.

The typical depiction of the CIA in both fiction and the more speculative forms of conspiracy theory, usually portrays them as being somewhere between spies and assassins, as well as at times being allegedly responsible for the overthrow of foreign governments, democratic or not, in the name of American interests.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Liam Neeson's portrayal of a possible former CIA man in _Taken_ is very standard, as is Harrison Ford's portrayal in _Patriot Games_. The Agency's adventures in Nicaragua, among other places, can also make for particularly interesting reading; as can Peter Joseph's interview with John Perkins. It is at times implied that they are additionally a research organization of sorts, with an interest in experimental tactics that would usually be considered impossible by the mainstream public. (Such as MK-Ultra, the Psychic Warrior program(s), etc) The CIA, or at least many of its personnel, is also usually depicted as having a severe case of Chronic Backstabbing Disorder, with officers and administrators constantly betraying each other for various reasons, both good and bad.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  This of course means officers have to live with the constant fear of betrayal.

Although it says "The Agency" up top here, actual CIA employees (and those in the know) tend to call it "The Company"; calling it "The Agency" is acceptable, but calling it "The CIA" in anything except perhaps first reference is considered incorrect. Other federal government types might call it the "Other Government Agencies" (OGA), typically when its involvement in something or other is an open secret. In exceptionally double-cross-intensive stories you might see "The Company" _and_ "The Agency" used to represent different factions of the CIA. "Langley"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is another informal name that shows up often, because the CIA is headquartered in Langley, Virginia, just a few miles west of Washington, D.C.. Another colloquial name that often comes up is "The Farm", used for the covert training facility at Camp Peary. Another important point: people who work for the CIA are _officers_, not agents. CIA agents are assets with access to information who work with officers.

When they appear in fiction alongside the FBI, America's other famous intelligence agency, the CIA Evil, FBI Good trope often comes into play, although the reverse (FBI Evil, CIA Good) is not unheard of.

## A lot of fiction has references to the CIA. Here are just some:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   One of the main employers of _Golgo 13_.
-   Appears in _Case Closed_ investigating the Black Organization.
-   Eda from _Black Lagoon_ is secretly a CIA officer.
-   _Jormungand_ prominently features the CIA, especially in the latter half of the series. It tends to play up the negative associations and clichés of the agency, with some operatives being manipulative, sadistic and jingoistic, though most factions presented in the story are little better. The CIA may oppose our heroes, but in this case those are greedy arms dealers and dangerous mercenaries.
-   In _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_, the American Empire has an identical espionage agency also called the CIA that fits all the tropes. They are most prominently featured in the episode "A Perfect Day for a Jungle Cruise", assisting Section 9 in tracking a serial killer. Turns out they trained him for use in a Phoenix Program-style operation in Latin America and are only co-operating with Section 9 in the hopes they would kill him and they could cover it all up. They don't.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Punisher Presents Barracuda_ miniseries has several covert ops officers meeting to discuss Barracuda's actions. The CIA officers are actually represented as competent, if somewhat fixed in the past, especially compared to the NSA guy, who's a moronic Armchair General.

-   _Burn Notice_
    -   Main character Michael Westen himself was a CIA officer, considering remarks made in the pilot he was under unofficial cover until he was burned.

Flagg was also a recurring antagonist in later seasons, sneaking into the camp for a number of anti-Communist witch hunts the staff blew off as frivolous at best.
