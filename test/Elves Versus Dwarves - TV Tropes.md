Many stories will have animosity between a beautiful, highly advanced race or civilization, and a much more gritty, industrial, technological force.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  These themes of Harmony Versus Discipline, Romanticism Versus Enlightenment, and Brains Versus Brawn are very common, regardless of the genre.

In many fantasy fictions these roles are filled by two of the Standard Fantasy Races, the Elves and the Dwarves. Elves are tall and slender, Dwarves are short and stout. Making a physical difference like this is a common way to point out that the two groups are meant as a foil of one another.

-   Elves use swords or bows (or both), weapons requiring flexibility and precision, representations of elegance. Elegance is power. Dwarves use axes, hammers, crossbows or if the setting allows for it, guns, which are primarily about direct, mechanical (in the case of the crossbow) or chemical (for guns) application of force. Force is power.
-   Elves will focus on magic and spirituality and evince disdain for material things, or to be more interested in their elegance than their utility. Beauty is strength. Dwarves will focus on mining and smithing, sometimes use muskets or revolver-style pistols and various Steampunk machines and tanks, all representations of industrial, technological might with a much greater concern for utility than elegance. Innovation is strength.
-   Elves live in pristine woods, crystal spires or elegant palaces, emphasis on light and natural beauty and openness. Dwarves live in great halls and impregnable fortresses that are usually underground, with emphasis on artifice and containment.
-   Elves are often masters of diplomacy, debate, rhetoric, Purple Prose, small talk, and _doubletalk_. Dwarves generally prefer straightforward opinions and blunt facts, and aren't overly concerned when somebody's feelings get hurt.
-   Elves dress fancily, sing elaborate songs, write poetic literature in flowing script, and strive (or, in some cases, don't _have_ to strive) to epitomize beauty and style. Dwarves are often unkempt, sport long beards and hair, and dress in either simple leather, undyed wool—or steel—and write Beige Prose. Usually in sticklike runes, carved into the rock.

We've given a lot of information here about the specific races, elves and dwarves, but the core of this trope isn't about them. It's about how that plays out in _lots_ of stories that have no elves or dwarves in them at all. In historical fictions/fantasies, you'll find aristocrats versus barbarians, for example, which could be exchanged for elves and dwarves quite easily. Science Fiction will have some variation on Eloi and Morlocks, or a Crystal Spires and Togas race versus a Proud Warrior Race, or a primitive but nature-oriented race versus humans. In a contemporary business setting, it'll be marketeers versus engineers. A lot of the modern retelling of the classic Cowboys and Indians western sagas has been presented as this sort of "spiritual barbarian vs. industrialized civilization" theme. Force and Finesse tends to describe their contrasting combat styles.

One common outcome is for the Elf and the Dwarf to better understand each other and their respective cultures. The Dwarf may gain a new respect for the Elf's culture and deep learning, while the Elf comes to appreciate the Dwarf's craftsmanship and hard work. Also expect both sides to put aside their differences and team up against a third enemy, who's usually portrayed as primarily destructive (orcs, for example). The primary attribute shared by Elves and Dwarves is their resourcefulness.

Compare with Pirates vs. Ninjas—although the latter is a recent Memetic Mutation while this trope is Older Than Television. Likewise the horror-oriented werewolves vs. vampires. For neighboring foil cities or countries, see Athens and Sparta. Comedy will show this one as Slobs Versus Snobs, Big Guy, Little Guy, or Fat and Skinny. It can sometimes manifest as a form of Fantastic Racism. Don't expect to see a Dwarf/Elf hybrid due to Hybrid-Overkill Avoidance and both sides being _very_ squicked at the prospect. However, it's always possible to have an Orc Raised by Elves or by Dwarves if not either an Elf or a Dwarf being Raised by Orcs.

Tanuki/Kitsune Contrast is a Sub-Trope and the Eastern equivalent of the classic Elf/Dwarf dichotomy.
