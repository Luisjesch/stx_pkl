_"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!"_

Saint Nick. Father Christmas. Papa Noel. Kris Kringle. The man with the bag. The jolly old elf himself.

Santa Claus is the embodiment of Christmas, and since the late 19th and early 20th centuries has become one of the most famous legends in the world. He was originally developed in the United States, as an amalgam of the story of Saint Nicholas of Myra and a number of other seasonal folk heroes – most prominently the German legend of the _Christkindl_ (the source of the name "Kris Kringle"), the Scandinavian legend of the _Nisse_ or _Tomten_, and the English legend of "Father Christmas". Santa and most of his best-known traits were largely codified by the classic 1823 poem _A Visit from St. Nicholas_ (which is more commonly known by its opening line, _'Twas the Night Before Christmas_).

The Santa Claus legend is based largely on that of the Dutch figure _Sinterklaas_ (literally "Saint Klaas" – "Klaas" being a nickname for "Nicolaas", the Dutch form of "Nicholas"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ), who comes down the chimney on the fifth of December (the eve of Saint Nicholas Day) to leave gifts for the little ones, thus fulfilling his role as the patron saint of children. Most of the imagery of the Saint in question has been carried over to his North Pole incarnation. In the original mythology, Sinterklaas was accompanied by black slaves; these were eventually changed to a demonic figure known as The Krampus in German-speaking culture, and friendly elves in the United States. In the Netherlands, meanwhile, the black companions are nowadays portrayed as Sinterklaas' friends and (voluntary) employees. Note that in several European countries, Sinterklaas and Santa Claus are nowadays considered to be two entirely different legends, each with their own elaborate holiday. The habit of distributing gifts attributed to all these legends is ultimately derived from a legend about St. Nicholas, according to which he secretly threw gold into the house of a poor man by night so that the man wouldn't have to sell his daughters into prostitution.

Santa is universally known as a festively overweight old man with a long white or silver beard, who wears a red suit with white trim, a matching cap, (originally a red bishop's robe and camauro), black boots, and a vast black belt worn across his belly. He resides at the North Pole (or in Lapland, or in Spain, or somewhere else depending on your culture – the original St. Nick was Greek, from a city in what is now Turkey) and oversees a large workshop staffed by elves (diminutive commercial-friendly elves; not tall, proud, Tolkien\-type elves – D&D players will see more of a resemblance to gnomes) who are often far Older Than They Look. These elves in their workshop produce toys year-round and every Christmas Eve they load them into an improbably roomy sack which Santa carries as he sets out to deliver them to all the good boys and girls of the world. His vehicle is a flying sleigh pulled by eight reindeer named Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen (with an option on a ninth, in the form of Rudolph, on nights with poor visibility). You might hear the sound of some Snowy Sleigh Bells as well.

Traditionally, he enters each house via chimney, fills the residents' stockings (left hanging on the mantle for his attention) with the gifts and toys he brought and/or places them beneath the Christmas tree, and then leaves the same way he came in. It is considered customary for the family to leave out a snack for him, and perhaps a tidbit for the reindeer as well. It is traditional in certain versions of the legend that Santa can tell when children are sleeping and when they are awake and will only deliver presents to children who go to bed when they are told to on Christmas Eve and will not come if they try to stay awake to see him. This was almost certainly something started by parents in more recent times, as it does not seem to appear in earlier versions of the story. It was likely popularized by the line "He sees you when you're sleeping; he knows when you're awake" in the song "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town." (German and Scandinavian traditions employ this same idea as Scare 'Em Straight Nightmare Fuel for toddlers). Note that this trait generally does _not_ apply in fiction, where even kids that are shown being told this will somehow still end up getting to meet Santa.

Officially, Santa delivers presents only to the children who have been good. Naughty children get the Boring, but Practical gift of coal, which they can burn in the furnace for warmth over the winter; not as raw a deal as it might seem to those of us who no longer burn coal ourselves.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Santa can even visit the children-at-heart or to anyone who believes in him. In even older traditions, he carried a bag of wooden switches for whipping the naughty children. In the Netherlands and Belgium, _Sinterklaas_ is famously accompanied in his work by a blackfaced servant named Zwarte Piet (Black Pete), which tends to cause headaches among foreigners unfamiliar with the tradition but all too keenly aware of the Unfortunate Implications that he represents. (Note that in the Dutch tradition, there is no racist connotation _whatsoever_ to dressing up as a jolly blackface servant and threatening to beat people up. Seriously.)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Zwarte Piet himself is a softening of an even earlier tradition in which Saint Nicholas used the services of an enslaved devil. Austria and southern Germany have The Krampus instead. Many other cultures that still look to Santa as an actual saint still include this devil or imagine Santa as doing battle with the devil on Christmas Eve, typically leading to even _more_ puzzled reactions from foreigners who wonder what Satan himself is doing in, say, a children's Christmas film.

The traditional explanation for Santa's ability to achieve his annual deliveries is that he is a magical being. In works that think about or play with the implications, this may involve depicting him as The Omniscient: he personally knows where everyone lives, what they want, what they have been doing, etc. However, more modern stories dealing with Santa give him access to a combination of magic and supertechnology; some versions even do away with the magic altogether (for example, the Christmas ep of _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ has his supertech being used by the villains to commit tons of felonies). In addition, modern depictions of Santa's home have his workshop being a fully mechanized factory run by the elves. A common variation is to have Santa portrayed as not a single magical being, but as a god-like office held by a mortal, such as in _Ernest Saves Christmas_, where Santa is a normal person who spends a large chunk of his (possibly magically lengthened) lifespan as Santa Claus and then passes the title off to someone else. Surprisingly, and in spite of all this focus on Santa's delivery process, the one aspect of the legend that has rarely, if ever, been called into question is how Santa could accomplish such feats and still have huge numbers of people (often a numerical majority, even in fiction) who refuse to believe he exists.

Also, for humorous effect, Santa is often portrayed as a cold-hearted tyrant, running his workshop with an iron fist while the elves are an exploited and resentful workforce. One example of such skewering came at the hands of _Futurama_, which introduced a futuristic robot-Santa who, due to a programming error that caused even something as simple as _picking one's nose_ to be deemed "naughty" behavior, condemned all of humanity as naughty (except Zoidberg) and hunted down the worst offenders every Christmas. Running a close second is the revelation by Anya in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ that not only did Santa exist, he was in fact a bloodthirsty demon — perhaps inspired by the devil present in older stories of him.

Because most straight portrayals of Santa in fiction have become familiar, annually-repeated classics, more recent works featuring him often tend to involve parodies, deconstructions, or other variations on the legend. Even in strict children's fare, there is always some kind of wry twist on the material: in _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_, for example, Father Christmas muses that he has not been to Narnia for many, many years, and proceeds to hand out lethal weaponry such as bows, arrows, and swords to three of the story's prepubescent protagonists for use against the evil witch responsible for his absence. A major exception is the film _The Polar Express_ (although in all fairness even its version of Santa – while still portrayed as a respected, kindly old man – is considerably less energetically jolly than usual).

Since the beginning of the twentieth century, there has also been a small movement to explain how Santa came to be, and continues to be. The most prominent backstory for the modern-day Santa (meaning, not derived from various folklore), comes from L. Frank Baum's (of _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ fame) novel, _The Life & Adventures of Santa Claus_. This story gives Santa a bit of _The Lord of the Rings_ treatment as there is plenty of strife and battles between the good fairies that raised Santa, and their enemies, a group of rock-monsters. This story has been made into at least two animated films, and continues to be one of the most popular backstories for Santa over 100 years after its first publication. Speaking of Tolkien, he too made his own spin on Santa Claus in _The Father Christmas Letters_. _The Dresden Files_ has Harry saying that Santa is a fairy.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Harry's not willing to summon him either. He'll mess with The Fair Folk, but Santa, no way.

The name "Santa Claus" comes from a Dutch variation of the name "St. Nicholas", "Sinterklaas". It is _not_, despite what fundamentalist Moral Guardians like to claim, an anagram of Satan. Well, it is, but that's decidedly unintentional. And his last name is spelled C-L-A-U-S, _not_ C-L-A-U-S-E; the latter is part of a sentence or part of a legal contract. This was the basis for a famous joke in the Marx Brothers' _A Night at the Opera_ ("There ain't no sanity clause!"), and for the Pun-Based Title of the movie _The Santa Clause_.

An additional note: in the United Kingdom and Australia, Santa is often called "Father Christmas" (such as in the C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien examples above). Though Santa and Father Christmas have picked up many attributes from each other and are now basically considered the same person, they were originally distinct figures. Father Christmas was an Anthropomorphic Personification of the Christmas holiday itself (particularly its feasting and drinking aspects), and wore a green robe rather than the red suit that Santa Claus wears. He was considered to be as old as the first Christmas (unlike St. Nicholas who lived in the fourth century).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Examples of Father Christmas from before his merger with Santa Claus can be found in the Ghost of Christmas Present in _A Christmas Carol_ by Dickens, and in the traditional plays of English Mummers.

In Germany and German-speaking parts of other central European countries such as Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg, the traditional Christmas gift-bringer is the "Christkind" or "Christkindl" (i.e., Christ child) himself. German-speaking immigrants to the United States brought this custom with them, and over time Christkindl morphed into "Kris Kringle", yet another common name for what eventually became Santa Claus.

Santa as a character is widespread even in countries that aren't Christian, like Japan and China. In Japan, he is called not surprisingly "Santa Kurasu" and in China, he is called "Old Man of Christmas".

Children are expected to grow out of their belief in Santa, and someone who Still Believes in Santa past the age of childhood may be mocked for it. But if someone needs to be reminded that Santa actually does exist, the traditional answer begins "Yes, Virginia"... On the other hand, Santa himself had better watch out should he find himself at a Philadelphia Eagles game, lest he get booed and have to dodge snowballs.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

    Films — Animation 

-   The polarizing film _The Polar Express_ (based on a book) was all about a boy who traveled on a magical train to the North Pole to meet "the big guy," Santa Claus. It was said that he was at that critical age, where he had pretty much stopped believing in Santa and if something wasn't done, there would be no going back. He went on a journey of discovery where he also met several other characters that were struggling with their own issues, including the lonely boy Billy who had never received gifts on Christmas and the hero girl who would be a leader to others, but needed to have confidence in her own decisions. In the end, the hero boy finally overcame his issues and met Santa, who told him that "Seeing is believing, but sometimes the most real things in the world are the things we can't see."
-   As you might well imagine, Santa Claus is a popular character in Christmas Specials; the most well-known are the stop-motion films by Rankin-Bass. Often times Subbing for Santa is invoked with the main characters of the holiday special.
-   An automobile version of Santa Claus named Santa Car (a vehicle resembling a Dusenburg) actually appears in storybook based on Pixar’s _Cars_ called "Mater Saves Christmas."
-   In _Caillou's Holiday Movie_, the "Where Santa Has a Different Name" song provides details on Christmas traditions around the world, including Denmark, Slovakia and Greece. Lap-sitting is also seen in this special, and in the story "Holiday Magic."
    
    -   In a song available only on the film's soundtrack album, "Riding in Santa's Sleigh," Caillou performs a duet with Santa in which he and Santa sing about Caillou joining him on his sleigh ride to deliver presents.
    
    Oh, Santa, can't you take me along? That's all I'm wishing in this Christmas song. Oh, Santa, can't you take me, oh, please? What a wonderful way to spend this Christmas Eve!
    
-   In the animated special _Toot & Puddle: I'll Be Home for Christmas_, Toot is rescued by a sleigh-driving man who is strongly implied to be Santa.
-   _The Year Without a Santa Claus_, title notwithstanding and its sequel film, _A Miser Brothers' Christmas_, feature Santa Claus as a key character. In the first one, Santa Claus has a cold and plans to skip Christmas, until Mrs. Claus and a couple of his elves go on a journey to help him see that there is still Christmas spirit in the world. In the second film, Santa is injured, so the Miser Brothers are made to take over for him.
-   In _My Friends Tigger & Pooh: Pooh's Super Sleuth Christmas Movie_, Rabbit's biggest Christmas wish is to meet the big guy, but he figures it's impossible, so he puts on his Christmas list what he feels is a more realistic Christmas wish— a subscription to _Rutabaga Monthly_, which he reads "for the articles of course." In the end, he gets his real wish when the team travels to the North Pole to return a lost baby reindeer and Santa's sack of toys.
-   _Holly Hobbie and Friends: Christmas Wishes_ includes a subplot in which Holly's brother Robby Hobbie and his friend Kyle Morris try to convince everyone that Robby is Santa Claus when he takes a job as mall Santa. He has trouble getting it to work, due to his small stature and his use of the family pig, Cheddar, as his reindeer, despite his best attempt at a booming "ho ho ho" voice. One girl tells him that he can't be Santa because he is not fat and does not have any reindeer, and he tries to convince her that the pig is really is reindeer and that he is skinny because he has gone on a low-carb diet. "Fine! I won't leave you any cookies! I'll eat them all myself!" Despite this, he manages to get the Deegan twins (the sons of the widow in the film) to tell him their true Christmas wish, which, in a twist, isn't something like wanting their father back or seeing their mother happy (though they would like this), but rather to have an earwig farm.
-   _The Nightmare Before Christmas_, in which Jack, the leader of Halloweentown, decides to give Santa a vacation by kidnapping him and takes on the job himself.
-   In _Rise of the Guardians_, Santa Claus is the leader of the title guardians, but is referred to as "North" in the film. He is depicted as a Husky Russkie (a Cossack in the book itself) with a Storyboard Body, whose main weapons are a pair of massive sabres.
-   In _Holly and Hal Moose: Our Uplifting Christmas Adventure_, the two title characters spend most of the film at the North Pole and therefore naturally spend a lot of time with both Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus.
-   _Arthur Christmas_ reveals that Santa Claus is a Legacy Character whose position has been passed down from father to son over hundreds of years (naturally, it all started with Saint Nicolas). The current Santa, Malcolm, is getting old and is very out of touch with the new advanced technology that the Christmas Elves use to help him deliver presents on Christmas Eve. His older son Steve, who currently serves as his Mission Control, hopes to succeed him as the next Santa, but his younger son Arthur is the one who really understands the importance of making children happy on Christmas despite being clumsy and terrified of practically everything.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Santa Claus Conquers the Martians_ combines the Santa story with campy no-budget Sci-Fi, and is widely regarded as one of the worst movies ever.
-   In the Mexican film _Santa Claus (1959)_, Santa (and his extraterrestrial army of child laborers) does battle with a demon who is sent by The Devil to persuade the children of earth to do evil.... it Makes Just as Much Sense in Context. Famously riffed by _Mystery Science Theater 3000._
-   Killers dressing as Santa Claus is a popular use of Subverted Innocence, as seen in movies like _Christmas Evil_, _To All a Goodnight_ and _Silent Night, Deadly Night_.
-   Santa provides the Deus ex Machina in _One Magic Christmas_ — good thing, too, or the events of the film would have been rather appallingly depressing.
-   In _The Santa Clause_, the protagonist is bewildered to discover himself forced into the job and the appearance of Santa due to a legal technicality.
-   In _Miracle on 34th Street_, it's a major plot point that grown-ups are skeptical whether "Kris Kringle" may or may not be the real Santa.
-   _Elf_ has Santa needing to be rescued by the main characters at the climax, due to his sleigh failing from lack of holiday spirit in New York.

-   _Violent Night_ is Die Hard with Santa as John McClane, where a jaded and drunk Santa gets trapped in a house being kept hostage and uses his past experience as a viking warrior to fight off the bad guys.

    Literature 

-   The famous poem "'Twas the Night Before Christmas" (or to give it its proper title, "A Visit From Saint Nicholas") by Clement C. Moore was an important Trope Codifier for Santa, including the names of his reindeer.
-   Another Trope Codifier is _The Life & Adventures of Santa Claus_ by L. Frank Baum, featuring Santa making friends with The Fair Folk and fighting against evil goblins.
-   _The Autobiography Of Santa Claus_: The book is written as if Santa himself wrote it, telling his own personal life story.
-   As mentioned, above, Santa Claus (as Father Christmas) appears in _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ to signal that the White Witch's always-winter-never-christmas power is beginning to fade.
-   _Land of Oz_: Santa Claus is a friend of Ozma of Oz, and attends her birthday party in _The Road to Oz_ (as a cross-over with L. Frank Baum's book mentioned above).
-   In L. Jagi Lamplighter's _Prospero Lost_, when Miranda is seeking refuge from demons, she is guided into a mall and finds that the Mall Santa really is Father Christmas. Later, she and Mab visit him to use his pool to look for some children. While there, she takes a gift from an elf — usually a foolish thing, but she knows under his roof, it must be safe.
-   _The Dresden Files_
    -   Santa makes an appearance in book _Cold Days_ under the name Kringle. He is one of the strongest members in the court of Mab, the Queen of Winter. He is pretty cool. He is described as bear-like, standing over seven feet tall, with jelly-like belly. He joins The Erl-King to lead The Wild Hunt each Halloween. And is possibly an aspect of Odin.
    -   He pops up again in _Skin Game_. He notes that as he is a vassal of Queen Mab when she asks him to appear for aide, he is obliged to answer. When Harry is hesitant to receive information Santa has about the case Harry is working on as that could put him in a debt to Kringle, Kringle explains Harry can consider it as a belated Christmas gift as Harry's residence the past winter was hard to get to for Santa.
    -   In "Christmas Eve" set on the Christmas Eve after the events of the book _Peace Talks_. He appears to Harry with a gift of hot "coffee"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  that brings back memories of Harry's late father and the last Christmas they shared together when Harry was a boy. The gift is wrapped in paper with the pattern of the face of Harry's dog, Mouse, grinning. Kringle also gives his compliments on the bike Harry has built for his daughter, and when that daughter walks in on the two, Kringle vanishes up the chimney. The daughter then thinks Santa got her the bike.
-   _The Father Christmas Letters_ were delivered to the children of J. R. R. Tolkien, describing Santa's adventures and misadventures with the elves at the North Pole. Readers of _The Lord of the Rings_ may notice a few Crossover similarities, especially in Santa's elf secretary Ilbereth.
-   Despite her sometimes cynical nature, Junie B. Jones still believes in him and asks him for a Squeez-a-Burp at the end of _Jingle Bells, Batman Smells, P.S.: So Does May_.
-   "San D'Klass" is mentioned in _Artemis Fowl_. Apparently a deluded king of the Elves who thought he could assuage the greed of mankind with occasional gifts, he utilized time stop technology to pull it all off in one night and the fact that everyone remains sleeping during a time stop gives Artemis the idea for how to beat it.
-   _The Cat Who... Series_: In book #15 (_The Cat Who Went Into the Closet_), Qwill agrees to take on the role of town Santa Claus in the Pickax Christmas parade, but very nearly bolts when informed only after the parade itself is over that he's expected at the courthouse for lap-sitting, having already endured a bumpy dogsled ride through bitter cold weather, followed by a perilous ladder-climb.
    
    **Qwill**: Lap-sitting? What the devil is that?
    
    **Wilfred**: They built a gingerbread house for you in front of the courthouse, and the kids sit on your lap and have their pictures taken.
    
    **Qwill**: Oh, no, they don't! I refuse flatly! Enough is enough!
    
    **Wilfred**: Mr. Qwilleran, sir, you gotta!
    
-   Nicholas St. North in _The Guardians of Childhood_ books that _Rise of the Guardians_ was based on.
-   Hilda van Stockum's _Kersti and St. Nicholas_ is a forgotten classic in which a "bad" girl believes that bad children are entitled to gifts like anyone else, and sets out on a journey to convince St. Nicholas himself of this. AND SHE DOES! The author reveals, "I claim no responsibility for \[Kersti's\] actions. I had a lovely, sweet, good little story for nice little children and Kersti just came and played havoc with it. She ruined the moral, shocked Pieterbaas \[Black Peter\], had a very bad influence on St. Nicholas and did not deserve a present at the end. I wash my hands of her." Her fans know Kersti is actually one of her favorite characters.
-   _The Day Santa Stopped Believing In Harold_: Santa is the main character, and the conflict of the story is him and Harold not believing in each other.
-   _Samurai Scarecrow_: Yukio decides to try and run Santa out of ninja village for the other kids not wanting to take part in a snowball fight with him for fear of ending up on his naughty list.
-   _Andy Griffiths' Just Series_: In "A Terrible Christmas and a Crappy New Year", Andy worries that he will be put on Santa's "naughty" list after vandalising some Christmas cards.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Ninth Doctor claims to be Santa in one episode.
        
        **Rose:** Look at you, beaming away like you're Father Christmas!  
        **Doctor:** Who says I'm not, red-bicycle-when-you-were-twelve?  
        **Rose:** What.
        
    -   In the 2010 Christmas Special, the Doctor says he is a friend of Santa's, providing a photo of him and Santa at Frank Sinatra's hunting lodge in 1952.
    -   We finally _meet_ Santa at the _very_ end of the Series 8 finale "Death in Heaven". "Now, Doctor... What do you want for Christmas?" This leads into the 2014 Christmas episode "Last Christmas"; turns out he is simply part of an elaborate multi-layered dream scenario.

She and Toto are met by a booming voice declaring himself to be Santa Claus, but it is eventually revealed to be a skinny guy. He explains that Mrs. Claus put him on the SlimFast diet.

After the song ends, Dorothy laments his fate, but just then a savior shows up, hooking Santa up with a fax machine and pager (yeah, it's pretty dated, though the package does also include a cellular phone with voice messaging) Santa and his operation are saved, and Dorothy and Toto are left to lament how now he'll easily be able to check up on who's naughty and who's nice.

Cue a cut-in of Malik dressed as Santa, beard, sack, and all, holding an axe and having the expression of some sadistic murderer.

-   The mythology of Santa Claus originated from the very real Saint Nicholas, a Byzantine Bishop from the fourth century who performed miracles and gave gifts in secret (most accounts of his life agree that he was the only child of a wealthy family, and when his parents died he used his new wealth to finance his clandestine generosity). After centuries of his legacy being mythologized, the modern day Santa is so far removed from Saint Nicholas that the two are treated as separate icons.
