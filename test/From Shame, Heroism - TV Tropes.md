_"When all the trouble is all your fault, be a man and stand tall."_

There are many heroes and heroines, both in real life and in fiction. Often, they are paragons of virtue and idealism to inspire, and for us to aspire to.

Not every hero/heroine has their origin in altruism, however. Sometimes, heroes are born out of shame. Not simply a Dark and Troubled Past, but a lapse in judgment, a moral failing, or even something done purposefully that Went Horribly Wrong or cost them dearly. It might have been a moment of inaction, especially willful inaction, or the wrong decision.

The hero/heroine who is moved by shame is often The Atoner. They aren't simply motivated by the loss of a loved one, or by a turbulent event in their past that they wouldn't wish on anyone else. This hero/heroine feels responsible for the tragedy they experienced or witnessed, and in many cases, they're not entirely wrong. This can lead to a My God, What Have I Done? moment.

This can also apply to former villains who undergo a Heel–Face Turn but are not subjected to Redemption Equals Death. Instead, having their own bad actions come back to hurt someone they cared about will prompt them to mend their ways, trying to Set Right What Once Went Wrong.

May frequently overlap with My Greatest Failure. Compare/Contrast The So-Called Coward.

A subtrope of The Atoner (almost everyone here is an Atoner, but you won't find every Atoner here). Also related to Failure Knight, who is seeking to make up for their own greatest failure.
