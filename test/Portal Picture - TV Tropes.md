Paintings are sometimes described as a 'window into another world'. Some series, especially in video games, take this all too literally. A magic painting will contain an entire world or dungeon which the heroes must enter to defeat the enemies within. In some cases, the art style will shift to match that of the painting, emphasizing the otherness of the painting world.

If this gimmick is used more than once, a magic art gallery can be the basis for the Hub Level of a game.

In rare cases, some nefarious ill-doer or oblivious Muggle may attempt to destroy a Portal Picture while another character is inside the painting world. The results vary: if the painting was literally a portal to another world, then destroying the portal will leave the characters Trapped in Another World. The more common metaphysical position, though, is that the painting world is actually formed out of the paint and brushstrokes on the canvas, and by wiping away the painting, the world itself disintegrates.

Either way, the painting may be used as a prison.

Sub-Trope to Anomalous Art. Compare with Portal Book and Trapped in TV Land, for different media acting as a portal. See also Art Initiates Life. When this is done symbolically as a Scene Transition, that's Picture-Perfect Presentation.

    Literature 

-   There is a short story called "The Rose Window" where a cleric (also the narrator) in a mild fantasy setting has a large rose window brought to his church from the one where he grew up. Then bad things start happening and members of the clergy start seeing something in the window move at night. Then the cleric comes to realize that something other than his god was secretly being worshiped in the church he grew up in. In the end he plans to smash it and then destroy his journals if breaking the window fixes the problem. The journal entries are what the reader (you) are reading right now.
-   The protagonist in George MacDonald's _Lilith_ enters the imaginary world through a painting in the attic on one occasion. The painting portrays the moor where he winds up.
-   Site Kilo-29, a secret nuclear shelter somewhere in the US, has, for whatever reason, a giant poster of the 2/19th, a US Army base in Germany where a demonic being nicknamed Tandy (after the guy whose body he likes to wear) hunted and killed the narrator's unit every winter for years. It appears that the poster is not just a portal but also the source of Tandy's power in Kilo-29.
-   The _Angel_ tie-in novel _Image_ does this. When a person is under the influence a certain type of magic, they can paint pictures that are portals to the worlds in the paintings.
-   _The Chronicles of Amber_ had the "Trumps," which were most commonly the size and shape of Tarot cards, but people skilled in using them could mentally communicate (or combat) the individuals depicted thereon. They also facilitated travel across the dimensions, as either person could offer to bring the other through. Trumps could also depict particular locations, which made them handy escape tools. In the course of the novels, it is revealed that it is not so much the materials of which Trumps are composed as the skills of the Trump artist that gives them their powers: two are scribed onto prison cell walls and become significant plot points later on. Later on, we also find two main characters within a Wonderland (as in Carroll) bar that's being painted onto a wall by an artist. The point between reality and mural moves back and forth.
-   in _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ Aberforth has a portrait of his sister Ariana that functions as a portal between the Hog's Head and the Room of Requirement that is used to supply Nevile, Luna, and Ginny's reinstated version of Dumbledore's Army, allow the trio to get into the castle, and evacuate students.

-   In the _Malazan Book of the Fallen_, Ganoes Paran finds ingenious ways to use his powers as the Master of the Deck of Dragons. He has an artist paint new cards to his specifications, then uses them to create portals to transport his army across vast distances, or to bait an enemy commander into another realm.
-   "Chapter Two: A Day Out" of _Mary Poppins_ is the inspiration for the chalk-drawing scene in the film, Mary and Bert the Match Man (but not Jane and Michael) enter one of his pavement sketches, where they have afternoon tea and travel to Yarmouth on merry-go-round horses.
-   _The Midnight Library_ story "Picture Perfect" has two boys discover a strange painted mural behind some wallpaper of their Grandaunt's house that depicts a different historical period from the pilgrim age all the way to the present. Each section has a child from that era staring out of the painting in terror. Above each period is scribed the latin phrase, "Fatum tuum, nisi celata fuerit pictura, idem erit". One brother becomes obsessed with uncovering the entire mural. When he reaches the very end, he sees an empty scene resembling his grandaunt's house and gets sucked into the painting. He then learns far, _far_ too late what the Latin phrase meant: "Your fate will be the same if the mural is not concealed"!

    -   In the endgame, there's a variant where you can use timed fixed cameras to take selfies and then use those selfies to teleport somewhere else. In that case, you swap places with your silhouette the instant you place the photo.

-   _minus._ does it several times. Here, for example.

    Web Original 

-   SCP Foundation: Iris Thompson, a.k.a. SCP-105, has the ability to use any photograph in this way; when she holds a photograph, it changes from a fixed image to a real-time view of the target, which she can reach through to physically manipulate objects in the target location. Originally, she could only reach through photographs taken using her personal Polaroid camera (designated SCP-105-B), but she's since demonstrated this ability with photographs taken using other cameras, with doing so being easier for her the faster the image develops after being taken. The effect extends to photos taken and displayed electronically (for instance, on a smartphone's screen), although this apparently feels like pushing through wet sand (and, indeed, she scratches up her hand badly enough to draw blood at least once while doing so).

    Western Animation 

-   _The Angel and the Soldier Boy_ was an incredible animation with no words, just music by Clannad. During one sequence a toy soldier and angel follow Pirates onto a ship that jumps into a painting of a sea scene.

He pulls one out and D.W. jumps into it, then breaks the fourth wall to comment "You didn't want to watch me walk through the woods, did you? That would be soooo boring."
-   _Blue's Clues_. In nearly every episode, the main characters "Skidoo" into a painting, book, drawing, or even _wrapping paper_ for educational puzzle-solving. In The Movie, they even went into a _sheet of music_.

_"Blue Skidoo! We can, too!"_

-   _Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings_ was a 1970s British animated series (featured in the US on _Captain Kangaroo_, and later on the Nickelodeon series _Pinwheel_) which applied this trope to a chalkboard by way of a small boy's imagination.
