What did you expect when you asked a cat to give you some respect?

_"Just 'cause my parents are yakuza, doesn't mean I'd murder someone, damn it! Now shut up, or I'll kill you!"_

Alice makes a criticism of Bob. Bob denies it, but does so in a way that validates the statement. This makes it a form of Hypocritical Humor.

One of the most common criticisms used for this is calling someone violent or short-tempered, perhaps because it allows a response of comedic violence, but plenty of other criticisms are possible, including stupidity ("No, I aren't!"), vulgarity ("Fuck you!"), inattentiveness ("No, I'm not— What are we talking about again?"), vanity ("Oh thanks, you noticed!"), being pretentious (_"Moi?"_), and immaturity (throwing a tantrum).

See also Description Cut for the inverse of this. Compare Not Helping Your Case, I Take Offense to That Last One, I Would Say If I Could Say, Oblivious Mockery, Oblivious to His Own Description, Immediate Self-Contradiction, Mirror Character, and contrast with Insult Backfire. The line itself (which is often attributed to Groucho Marx) is, of course, a play on "I resent that remark."

    Advertising 

-   A 1986 commercial for the Embassy Suites hotel chain featured an animated Garfield. The commercial ends with a shot of the logo and the Narrator says, "Embassy Suites, where you don't have to be a fat cat to enjoy the suite life," followed by a shot of Garfield sitting at a table holding a knife and fork and thinking, "I resemble that remark."

    Anime and Manga 

-   Kind of a Not Helping Your Case combined with Digging Yourself Deeper version from the anniversary strips of _Azumanga Daioh_: When seeing how Kaorin is mooning over Sakaki, Osaka manages to have a realization, which escaped all the other characters, and asks Kaorin if she is gay. Kaorin angrily protests that no, she isn't, the correct/preferred term is lesbian not gay, and no, she certainly isn't a lesbian, it's just a teenage thing she's going through, and besides, it wouldn't have mattered to her if Sakaki had been a guy.
-   In _Bakuman。_, Mashiro lists the three qualities his uncle believes that a successful mangaka should have, the first of which is believing that they are better than others.
-   _Death Note_: Whenever someone accuses Light of being evil for killing people, his response is usually to kill the accuser.
-   Monta from _Eyeshield 21_ is constantly compared to a monkey. He gets angry at the comparison and acts exactly like a monkey. "Who are you calling a _woohee_?!"
-   _Fairy Tail_: An interviewer asks Gray why he's always taking off his clothes. As Gray protests that it's not true, Juvia points out that he's in his underwear.
-   In _Fly Me to the Moon_, Nasa introduces Tsukasa to Kaname, then warns Tsukasa that Kaname makes dirty jokes. Kaname gets offended.
    
    **Kaname:** I'd rather the guy who doesn't have anything great beneath the waist stop acting like I'm the queen of pervy humor!  
    **Nasa:** This is literally what I'm talking about!
    
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_: When Mustang's Lieutenant Breda lets Ed in on why Mustang kept quiet about his plans to fake Maria Ross's death and smuggle her out of Amestris, he mentions that Mustang didn't want the operation to be jeopardized by "some hot-tempered kid". Ed naturally flips out.

-   When Karen and Erika try to interview Momo in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_, they make a comment about needing to be careful around her lest she kill them. She responds by pointing out that having yakuza parents doesn't mean that she goes around murdering people, then threatens to kill them if they don't shut up.
-   Ayu of _Kanon_, offended at being teased that she looks like a young boy, protests that she's a girl — but not very girlishly.
-   On an episode of _Kaze no Stigma_, Ayano's school is being haunted by a mischievous pixie named Tiana that keeps playing pranks on her and her two friends (Kazuma, who is also there, remains completely calm watching the three girls run around). At the end, the Tsundere throws a tantrum about the pixie, her cousin catches it for her, and the two of them begin fighting like little kids. The other three comment about this, but they both deny being like the other or being immature at the same time.
-   _Lucky Star_:
    -   This trope sort of crosses over with Not Helping Your Case trope when Konata's father insists that it's wrong to call him a paedophile (in the exclusive sense) because he likes both young-looking girls _and_ normal girls, so it's more correct to say that he's "_also_ a lolicon". Konata isn't the least bit reassured.
        
        **Konata:** You still lose at life.
        
    -   When Kagami and Tsukasa first meet her, Yutaka says that Konata talks about them a lot. Kagami asks what kinds of stuff she's been saying, and Yutaka gets scared. Cue Kagami grilling Konata over it, which only makes an obvious half-truth seem accurate.
-   While the cast of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ are talking about how some members of their group acted when they were kids, the Wolkenritter chime in on how Reinforce Zwei was such a child when she was younger. Naturally, Rein protests, insisting that she has always acted like an adult... in a childish way.
-   _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_: In the first episode, Kamille tells a Titans officer that he doesn't like being bullied by thugs. The Titans' response is to beat him up some more.
-   _My Hero Academia_:
    -   In one episode, Tsuyu Asui says that Bakugo won't be popular due to how much of an angry hothead he is. He promptly responds with threatening to hurt her, which doesn't go unnoticed by her.
    -   A few episodes later, Bakugou is with Kirishima and is calmly coming up with a plan to beat the attacking villains. Kirishima points out that this is so unlike him as he's usually all "DIE DIE DIE!", which of course causes Bakugou to explode that he's always calm and rational.
-   _My Monster Secret_ features a two-way version when Youko and Akane mutually accuse each other of being immature. The onlookers are quick to notice that the argument and their method of resolution (having a "maturity contest") proves both of them correct about each other.
-   _Rurouni Kenshin_: A sure way to hit Kaoru's Berserk Button is disagreeing with her when she states she's fragile.
-   In _Sgt. Frog_, as spring comes, Natsumi tells her mom that Keroro is so lazy, it might be spring all day long on Planet Keron. Keroro is insulted by this, and thinks to himself that he works very hard. But when he tells us what he does as "work", Natsumi is not wrong in the slightest.
-   _Transformers Victory:_ One episode has Leozack arguing with Goryu, who asks why Leozack and his troops never show the Dinoforce any respect. Leozack points out they're a bunch of idiots, which incenses Goryu, just as Kakuryu passes by being particularly Kakuryu-y. Namely, carrying far too much while singing a children's song, which makes Goryu yell at him, which makes Kakuryu drop the fuel, forcing Goryu to perform some acrobatics to stop it falling and exploding.
-   A Running Gag in _Urusei Yatsura_ is Ryuunosuke responding to being called a man with "Ore wa _onna_ da zo!" This literally means "I'm a woman", but it's phrased in the most _masculine_ way you could possibly say it.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   Rebecca complains about the fact that Yugi is yelling at her.
        
        **Yugi:** _I'M NOT YELLING AT YOU!_
        
    -   A much darker version occurs during Atem's duel with Raphael in the Doma filler arc, where Raphael taunts him and claims that when Atem was a Pharaoh in ancient Egypt, he was an evil, bloodthirsty tyrant. Atem has total amnesia and knows nothing about his past except a couple of visions of himself battling his high priest and of his God Monsters towering over a ruined city, and the claim, therefore, strikes a nerve, making him so infuriated by the possibility that it's true that... he punishes Raphael by playing a magical evil card that will rip Raphael's soul from his body forever if he loses. Way to prove you're not a bloodthirsty tyrant there, Pharaoh! (Admittedly, he realizes how idiotic a move this was soon after, but by then it's too late.)

    Comedy 

-   From one of Marcus Brigstocke's stand-up comedy routines:
    
    "Computer games don't affect kids. If _Pac-Man_ had affected us as kids we'd be running around in dark rooms, munching pills and listening to repetitive music."
    
-   This is part of Dennis Miller's routine. He starts by saying, "I don't want to get hooked on a rant here, but" and then does _exactly that_.

    Comic Books 

-   _Astro City_: Crackerjack laments that his on-and-off ladyfriend Quarrel is mad at him for flirting with other women, as he flirts with Nightingale.
-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: This is a minor Running Gag in Don Rosa's works, where Hewey, Dewey, and Louie respond to any suggestion that they look identical to each other by immediately speaking in unison to deny the claim, and generally behave in an identical manner.

-   _Groo the Wanderer_: Groo's "What do you mean slow of mind?", said several pages after someone calls him slow of mind (once even to a flashback).
-   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1992)_: When Roam sniffs at Link's "immaturity," deriding all the crap he's been through, Link throws a tantrum. "I'll show YOU who's weak!"
-   _Monica's Gang_: Monica overhears Jimmy Five telling Smudge that she only settles things through force. She tells him that's a lie and that he'll be hit if he doesn't take it back.
-   _The Simpsons_: When Homer finds Abe teaching Bart how to surf, he asks why Abe never did that for him. Abe retorts that it's because he's got no attention span. Homer can't even finish objecting before getting distracted by a cloud that looks like a pork-chop.
-   _Stunt Dawgs_: Badyear says that much upon being described as "an ox and a moron".
-   Ultra Magnus has a fine line of this in _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_. He dislikes being called "irritable"; in fact, it really irritates him.
-   In one _Usagi Yojimbo_ story (which starts with an apology to the makers of _Groo the Wanderer_), Usagi commends Gen's swordplay by commenting, "You may be slow of mind but you're quick with steel!" At the end of the story, Gen asks Usagi (while talking about something else) "And what did you mean, 'slow of mind?'"
-   In _Wanted_, Wesley Gibson tries to give an Even Evil Has Standards speech to psychotic hedonist Joker expy Mr. Rictus. It doesn't work:

    Comic Strips 

-   From an August 2014 _Andy Capp_ strip:
    
    **Marriage Counselor:** Mr. Capp, your wife claims that you are often rude and outspoken. Why do you think this is?  
    **Andy:** Beats me, baldy.
    
-   _Blondie (1930)_: In one strip, Dithers jovially asks Dagwood if the rumor about him having mood swings is "the craziest thing you've ever heard"; when Dagwood reluctantly agrees with him (a white lie), Dithers goes berserk with rage.
-   _Calvin and Hobbes_:
    -   Calvin goes on a rant about how violence on television doesn't have any effect on the watcher and concludes with "I'd like to shoot the idiots that think this stuff affects me."
    -   Calvin also rants about a television show which makes no sense. When Hobbes remarks that it's targeted at the average American's fifteen-second attention span, Calvin's response is only, "You're still talking about that?"
    -   One Sunday strip is nothing _but_ this trope. Starting a meeting of their club, G.R.O.S.S., Hobbes starts to read the minutes of the last meeting, which began with how he read the minutes of the previous meeting, followed by Calvin's "commentary on the editorial slant" of the minutes, and various technical terms to state, simply, that Calvin had lost his temper and called him a liar. Of course, as he's _doing_ this, Calvin is _again_ getting angry and calling him a liar, which results in a fight between the two. (And gives the reader the idea that club meetings between the two of them rarely ever result in anything but the two fighting.)
-   A couple of times in _Dennis the Menace (US)_, Gina will get offended by Dennis calling her a tomboy. She typically responds by slugging him.
-   _Foxtrot_:
    -   Paige manages to do this trope in reverse:
        
        **Paige:** Mom, can I go see _Interview with the Vampire_?  
        **Andy:** No.  
        **Paige:** _\[crying\]_ WAAAAAAAAAAH WHY NOT????  
        **Andy:** Because it's rated R!  
        **Paige:** C'mon, I'm mature enough.
        
    -   Jason and Peter are discussing a study about how video games make kids violent... and then mention how much they want to strangle whoever wrote that.
-   _Garfield_:
    -   When Jon is on the phone with a woman:
        
        **Jon:** I'm immature?!! Well, excuse me, miss poopie head! _\[puts the phone down and sucks his thumb\]_
        
    -   Jon having a conversation with Garfield:
        
        **Jon:** Why don't you ever listen to me?  
        **Garfield:** Huh?  
        **Jon:** Why don't you ever agree with me?  
        **Garfield:** That's not true.  
        **Jon:** Why don't you show me any respect?  
        **Garfield:** I do...bonehead.
        
    -   And on another occasion:
        
        **Jon:** Remember, Garfield, there is no greater failing than apathy.  
        **Garfield:** So what?
        
    -   Another occasion that doesn't involve Jon:
        
        **Garfield:** Why does your sign say "Beware of Cats"?  
        **Dog:** Because Cats Are Mean.  
        **Garfield:** Take it down or I'll beat you with it.
        
-   One homebrew _Knights of the Dinner Table_ strip has Bob ranting about how he'd like to kill those media pundits who claim role-playing games promote violence.
-   _Peanuts_:
    -   Lucy Van Pelt denying that anyone could ever dislike her:
        
        **Lucy:** I could see how someone would be jealous of me — but dislike? No, that's just not possible!
        
    -   Lucy does it again in another strip. Charlie Brown is at her psychiatric booth talking about how people take advantage of him; for example, they start talking on and on and he can't bring himself to leave. This starts Lucy on a six-panel rant complaining about people who won't shut up.
-   One _Women on the Edge_ strip has the caption "Show me what you're accused of, and I'll show you how you react". Each panel has a character partaking in this trope (childish: "I'm sowwy"; aggressive: "Shut up, idiot", co-dependent: "I'll stop for you!", etc).

    Fan Works 

-   In _Bloodstained Heroes of Humanity_, Katsuki physically assaults a kid for saying that he wouldn't be a hero with his poor attitude. Then Katsuki beats the crap out of Izuku, who points out that he's proving the kid's point.
-   From _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_:
-   _The Child of Love_: In chapter 7, Shinji gets shot down by an Angel and Asuka goes ballistic:

    **Asuka:** I'M CALM!!! THAT'S OBVIOUS, ISN'T IT!!?
    
-   _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_:
    -   In the abridged version of DBZ movie _Lord Slug_, Piccolo does some extremely savvy snarking at the Quirky Mini Boss Squad, pointing out the role and personality type of each. He finishes it with the following:
        
        **Piccolo:** ...and that would make _you_ no doubt the big, tough, stupid one.  
        **Dorodabo:** You take that back or I'll kill you!  
        **Piccolo:** Alright, alright, you're not tough.  
        **Dorodabo:** That's better!
        
    -   Vegeta also has a case of this when he has a breakdown on Namek and starts arguing with the (possibly real, possibly hallucinatory) ghost of Nappa that only he can see. The results are... interesting.
        
        **Krillin:** ...Are you... OK?  
        **"Nappa":** I think your rage broke, Vegeta.  
        **Vegeta:** SHUT UP, GHOST OF NAPPA!  
        **Krillin:** Who was tha—  
        **Vegeta:** I'M NOT CRAZY! YOU'RE CRAZY! _ESPECIALLY_ YOU, NAPPA!
        
    -   Another Vegeta example in "It's Been a Year If It's Been a Day" when Goku insults Vegeta within earshot.
        
        **Goku:** Alright now, Gohan. When you get out there, try not to brag. \[...\] Don't let slip just how much stronger we are. Otherwise, Vegeta will be all "Oh, but my pride! Grr, I wish _I_ were a carrot!"  
        **Gohan:** That's not _in_accurate...  
        _\[...\]_  
        **Goku:** Oh, hey guys! What did I miss?  
        **Vegeta:** _Mock my pride...!_  
        **Goku:** Huh, what'd I tell you?
        
-   _Fashion Upgrade_ (_Miraculous Ladybug_): Kim's version of Hawkmoth is a Large Ham Psychopathic Manchild Mood-Swinger prone to tears at the slightest insult. Gabriel's outrage over this brings him to the verge of a Villainous Breakdown, and he rejects Nooroo's concern over catching him crying.
-   _Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past_: Ron is impressed by Harry's ability to talk to Luna when she's upset, and wishes he could do the same with Ginny, but Ginny overhears them.
    
    **Ginny**: What's not hard?  
    **Ron**: Talking to you when you're mad about something, without getting hexed.  
    **Ginny**: Ron, I do _not_ go around — how could you say such a thing? _<while reaching for her wand>_
    
-   _House of Summers_: Scott Summers isn't jealous. He's merely irritated by other men ogling to his wife. But he isn't jealous.
    
    **Jean:** Are you jealous, Scott?  
    **Scott:** Depends... are you into that southern charm that Guthrie seems to ooze out of his every pore?  
    **Jean:** You are jealous.  
    **Scott:** I'm not jealous! Guthrie is a green, eighteen-year-old... It's just a little frustrating when all these men are drawn to you like moths to a flame, and they can't see the glare behind my glasses.  
    **Jean:** I think it's sweet that you're jealous.
    
-   In _How the Light Gets In_, Laurel is suddenly and inexplicably resurrected, shocking everyone. Except for Diggle, who remains (outwardly) completely calm and controlled.
    
    **Felicity:** _\[freaking out\]_ And you! Why are you so calm about this?  
    **Diggle:** _\[calmly\]_ Who says I'm calm?
    
-   After Deku successfully heals All Might's internal injuries in _Izuku with a strange OP healing quirk_, the Pro Hero starts to see him as a potential successor and wants to find out who he really is, but the hospital staff refuses to give out any of Deku's personal information due to dealing with crazy stalkers in the past.
    
    _Toshinori understood the boy's safety was important, but Toshi was not one of those crazy people they were protecting the kid from. All Toshi wanted to do was find out his real name, track him down, thank him from the bottom of his heart, buy him ice cream, bring him to UA, get him accepted, make him a hero and possibly give him his quirk and his mantle... ...Okay, so maybe Toshi was sounding a bit crazy. It must be all the oxygen he was getting now._
    
-   Occurs in _My Master Ed_ when Edward is trying to explain to Hohenheim who he is, but just keeps working himself up instead.
    
    **Hohenheim:** Ed, calm down.  
    **Edward:** **I'M COMPLETELY CALM!**  
    **Hohenheim:** I can see that.

-   _The One to Make It Stay_: During Miracle Queen's assault, Ladybug calls Chat Noir to task for his attempts to blame all of their recent problems working together on her. In particular, she points out how, despite his complaints that she doesn't treat him like her partner and equal, he himself constantly ignores all of her efforts to work with him, refusing to listen — especially when it comes to the matter of his constant flirting. He doesn't respect any of her requests for him to stop, and doesn't treat the other heroes with respect. His response to this is to completely ignore what she's saying and try to blame the argument _he started_ on her, then lashes out at Viperion when he speaks up, proving her points.
    
    **Chat Noir:** You're completely out of control. _We're_ supposed to be _partners_, but then you go ahead and pick and get rid of teammates _without_ me.  
    **Ladybug:** Maybe if you actually _acted_ like a partner, and treated our teammates with respect, I would have given your opinion more consideration. Why is it that I have to entertain what you want, but when I tell you to back off and stop hitting on me, you get to act like _I'm_ being unreasonable?  
    **Chat Noir:** Come on. Are you seriously airing out our dirty laundry in front of everyone right now?  
    **Viperion:** If you don't want her to call you out, don't give her material to work with.  
    **Chat Noir:** _\[glaring at him\]_ _Stay_ out of this, _snake._"
    
-   In _Road Trip_, Logan angrily claims that he does not like Jean's pet dog as chiding Warren for petting Darwin wrong.
    
    **Logan:** I do not love the fucking dog. And I'm not his goddamn uncle. He's a fucking pain in my ass. He begs for food all the damn time — and you wanna tell me why you two starve the poor little guy? He's always hungry, and that chow you feed him tastes like shit — and he trashes my room and chews up my stuff and he's always fucking underfoot — and just how goddamn stupid are you, Birdbrain? Can't you see he wants you to rub his belly? Stop messing with his fucking ears, you simpleminded shit — and we'd all be a lot better off without the mutt, is what I'm saying.
    
-   In _Sight_ Urahara's zanpakutou, Benihime, tells Ichigo not be vulgar so he would descend to his Hollow, Hakuran's level. Hakuran gets offended and proves her point.
    
    **Benihime:** I will when you learn to stop being so vulgar. Honestly, do try not to descend to your Hollow's level.  
    **Hakuran:** Oi, what's that supposed ta mean, bitch?!
    
-   Agent South Dakota seems to do this a lot in _Stress Relief_. One time, the Director calls her out on throwing a tantrum and she immediately denies it by throwing a tantrum about it. Even in the first chapter, when he says she keeps "acting like a goddamn child", she goes off in a huff and tosses her helmet to the side.
-   An episode of _Teen Titans The Abridged Series_ includes this conversation.
    
    **Robin:** I think you should apologize \[to Raven\].  
    **Beast Boy:** Dude, she ruined breakfast! _She_ should be the one apologizing!  
    **Robin:** I agree with you, but women are irrational creatures. It's why they always win arguments.  
    **Starfire:** I... am... not... _**IRRATIONAL!**_ _\[bursts into tears\]_  
    **Robin:** _\[to Beast Boy\]_ Look what you made me do. Now go apologize to Raven while I deal with Starfire crying for the next three hours.

        **Twilight:** Why are you getting so angry anyway?

-   _Turnabout Substitution_: When Apollo is explaining to Rhea Wits why she sucks as the Mysterious Bust Killer, one of the things Apollo says is a metaphor: He gave Rhea Wits a shovel, and she _just kept digging_. So what does Rhea do after that? Go into her Villainous Breakdown by _repeatedly digging through the floor with a shovel_!
-   _Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse_: After Ranma learns that Miriam has been subject to random attacks by ninja-squids seeking to avenge their lecherous prince whose mating tentacle she bit off, he jokingly informs her that this proves she was born to be a crewmember, since "random people showing up seeking revenge for stupid stuff" happens to him all the time.

    **Ren**: How dare you call me out on something that is completely true?

-   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Disney)_:

    **Sal:** _\[about BRAD\]_ There's no taming him – he hasn't even been fully house trained.
    
    I didn't need to look over at BRAD. I knew that whatever he was doing, it would back up Sal's comment without question.

    -   The following exchange between Qibli and Winter:

        **Winter:** Was that supposed to be me? Terribly unimpressive, if so. I haven't once said "higgledy-piggledy" in my entire life. We would never allow such linguistic imprecision in the Ice Kingdom.

    **Batman:** Me? Superstitious? Nonsense. ...Ah! Never walk under a ladder, Robin.  
    **Robin:** Batman, I'm surprised at you.  
    **Batman:** Not at all. There is a custom based on fact. The ladder could fall and hit you on the head. Or someone could slip and fall from the ladder. It doesn't pay to court disaster, Robin.

        **Penny:** Well...  
        **Sheldon:** Oh, sorry. "Condescending" means—  
        **Penny:** I know what it means!
        
    -   When the guys are trying to convince Sheldon he'd make a good professor:
