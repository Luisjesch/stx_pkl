**The Alpha:** Scott, I think you're getting the wrong impression of us. We really just want to help you reach your full potential.

**Scott:** By killing my friends?

**The Alpha:** Sometimes the people closest to you... can be the ones holding you back the most.

**Scott:** If they're holding me back from becoming a psychotic nutjob like you? I'm okay with that.

Alice is a very fortunate woman, she's the best at her profession in the world, has a group of supportive friends and a loving family. True, she probably longs for adventure and excitement or wider recognition, but that's a minor concern compared to the bliss that is her life. Bob knows of her skills and sorely needs them, so he makes a generous offer for her to join him and help in his (potentially evil) goals, sweetening the deal with the promise acclaim, power and wealth. Of course, she'll refuse because she's happy where she is. In fact, she probably quit Bob's team not long ago precisely to get that happy family life.

So how does Bob get her into the fold? He kills these happy people to remove all her links to mundane life. Usually he's smart enough to frame one of his enemies, or at least Make It Look Like an Accident, that way he can channel Alice's rage and despair towards his cause. If Bob is especially malicious and grand in scope, he may even give Alice a Doomed Hometown and make her Conveniently an Orphan.

You can expect the fireworks to start once the secret is revealed. Alternately, Bob might instead kidnap one or all of her friends and family in order to more directly control her, or as a backup since their murder _will_ backfire. If Charlie wanted to make Alice pull a Mook–Face Turn/Heel–Face Turn (or at least leave/betray Bob) revealing this Villainous Demotivator is sure to work.

A more sinister variation happens when Bob wants to "help" Alice by killing her Living Emotional Crutch and Morality Chain. The reason? "They were holding you back from achieving your true potential."

Subtrope to The Call Knows Where You Live. Compare Murder the Hypotenuse, where a jealous lover kills anyone who might "steal" their beloved's heart.

-   _Naruto_ has a curious case: Sasuke's only goal from the beginning was to kill his brother, Itachi, to avenge his clan. As the series progressed he started to develop bonds with his teammates, only for the Sound Four to arrive and give him a beating and a Hannibal Lecture, to convince him that his bonds are holding him back and he should leave the Leaf Village to search for power. While they do this in a bid to steer Sasuke into going with Orochimaru, who wants to steal his body and his Sharingan for himself, Sasuke is convinced by their words and defects from the Leaf that very night.

-   In the early issues of the new _Batman and Robin_ series, Damian Wayne's mother Talia put control devices in his spine and manipulated his body in order to have him kill Batman (Dick Grayson). Her reasoning was that Dick was holding Damian back by making him Robin, though it was clearly more along the lines of unhappiness that Damian was not obeying her since when using the machine she even commented that "this is what it's like to have a son who does what I want." Damian refused her "help" after Dick freed him from the control, and his mother has since cut ties with him via Cloning Blues now that he's siding with his father's legacy.
-   This was somewhat the reason why the second Zoom attempted to kill Wally West's wife Linda (and succeeded in temporarily causing the deaths of their unborn children in Geoff Johns' Flash run.

When Vanessa was kidnapped, during the rescue attempt the lieutenant attempted to kill her and blame it on the kidnappers (she survived, but nobody knew that until much, much later) so the Kingpin would return to his old ways. It worked perfectly...unfortunately, the Kingpin figured out what had happened, and the "old Kingpin" had no compunction about murdering a traitor with his bare hands.
    -   In another storyline, Wilson Fisk moves to a different country and settles in to a humble life. He ends up falling in love with a local woman and becomes a father figure to her children.

    Fanfiction 

-   In _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_, Harry becomes briefly afraid that Dumbledore will dispose of his family once he realizes that they _aren't_ abusive (and therefore might be holding him back) and thus pretends to be miserable. Much later in the story, this is played deadly straight when Professor Quirrel _does_ try to remove Harry's friends in order to limit their influence on him. This is done by framing Hermione for Draco's attempted murder, and then _killing_ Hermione. It turns out to have been a bad idea.

    Films — Animated

-   In _Star Wars_ it is elaborated upon in the Expanded Universe that Palpatine had plans to kill off Padme anyway, he felt that Vader's love for her was holding him back.
    -   This is very, very common in Sith training in general. Removing the "weakness of compassion" by killing a loved one is usually the last step in becoming truly devoted to the Dark Side. See Jacen Solo and Kylo Ren.
-   A less malignant version of this is what drives the main conflict of _The Adjustment Bureau_: the Bureau doesn't try to kill Elise but aims to keep her and David apart because David's drive to become a politician and make a positive difference in the world was his means to cope with the loneliness he felt after losing his parents at an early age (also due to the machinations of the Bureau). According to the Bureau, if David and Elise remain together, David won't become President and change the world for the better. Likewise, Elise would fail to become one of the greatest ballet dancers in the world.

-   The origin of one protagonist in Vladislav Krapivin's Crystal-verse series. One secret society is dedicated to protecting and teaching kids with unusual abilities, which Dark and Troubled Past makes more obvious, and they run a boarding school, so they only watch the bureaucracy of social services and push some levers... Either that, or find children they want to acquire, remove their parents making it look like an accident, _then_ ride in on a white horse when bureaucrats "for some reason" deny custody to other relatives. Good news is that well intentioned extremists prefer "humane" methods of making people vanish: interspacial travel in the setting is anisotropic, so even if exiles know anything of this fringe discipline and somehow can make proper equipment in the world where they were dumped, good luck with finding a way back.
-   In _Windmills of the Gods_ by Sidney Sheldon, the heroine turns down an offer from the President to become a US Ambassador. Unfortunately for her, the villain really wants her to take the job, so arranges for her husband to die in a tragic car crash, so that she will be free to accept.

    **Reileen:** I'm saving them for you. You're gonna kill each one of them. And by the time you do, you won't even care.

Vader tells Starkiller this after Vader had just mortally wounded his girlfriend right in front of his eyes, and this does not bode well for Vader winning back his apprentice.
-   In _God of War_, this is Ares' rationale for tricking Kratos into murdering his wife and daughter, proclaiming that Kratos will become "death itself". Naturally, this backfired.
