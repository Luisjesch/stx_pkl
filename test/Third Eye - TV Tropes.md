_"A pleasant-faced man steps up to greet you  
He smiles and says he's pleased to meet you  
Beneath his hat, the strangeness lies  
Take it off, he's got three eyes"_

— **Rush**, "The Twilight Zone"

An eye grants sight, and thus symbolizes perception and understanding of the world. Two eyes gives the ability to perceive depth, so what new dimension might we be able to perceive with a third?

This is an Older Than Print trope that goes at least back to the Hindu Puranas, and shows up in various other religions as well. The Third Eye represents supernatural and mystical perception, possibly even spiritual enlightenment. As such it's not necessarily biological; characters might make a glowing eye tattoo appear on their forehead when using their magical perception abilities such as Aura Vision and Blindfolded Vision.

Aside from the spiritual, a Third Eye is common among mutants, aliens, and strange creatures. With them it usually provides purely worldly Super-Senses related to vision, especially True Sight.

As the picture shows, it is typically in the center of one's forehead and might be parallel or perpendicular to the two normal eyes. It may also be made more otherworldly by being a different color than the two normal eyes. While this trope is pretty neutral as to heroes and villains, usually evil characters have the mutant type third eye while heroes sport the more "enlightened" mystical one. Either way, expect the owner of the eye to suffer from Freakiness Shame if not outright persecution.

It's frequently paired with other Eye Tropes and Fate and Prophecy Tropes. One of the few ways to put Extra Eyes in odd places without incurring Eyes Do Not Belong There. Compare Pineal Weirdness — the third eye is sometimes identified with the pineal gland. Many characters make do with placing a Power Crystal over this spot. Extra points if it's eye shaped... or _used to be an eye!_ Beware, though, sometimes having a third eye sets you up for a Poke in the Third Eye.

-   One of the least remarked upon differences between the Abh and baseline humans in _Crest of the Stars_ and sequels is the fact the Abh possess a third eye. Rather than a full eye, it's a small structure in the middle of the forehead that's described as something more comparable to the compound eye of an insect.

Military issue ones, in addition to displaying rank, can be used connect to a ship's computer and transmit information through the third eye.

-   Ingeborg Refling Hagen, when writing her _Magnum Opus_ (heavily autobiographic), described how an inner Mentor Archetype, which she called "the old one", showed itself like a "grey eye" in her mind. When this happened, insight was preeminent. Those experiences, which the author probably had herself, came after heavy pondering over literary subjects (or tropes and memes).

    -   The _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ book _Guardians of the Caerns_ makes a Shout-Out to the Salubri with the third eye as a Metis deformity.

    Western Animation 

-   Sky Pirate Captain Two-Eyed Alonso in _The Adventures of Puss in Boots_ is so named because he has two eyes... one of which is on his forehead, and he also has an eyepatch. He flies a skull and crossbones with three eye sockets.
-   In _Adventure Time_, Goliad (Princess Bubblegum's sphinx-like replacement for when she dies) has a third eye which she uses to control people and to read their minds.
-   In the _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_ episode "Circus", Shake tries to impress the crow after seeing Meatwad's popularity by calling himself a martian with a third eye (that's only a cut-out taped on his face). He calls out the audience, saying some of them smoke, while they boo and throw garbage at him.
-   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, "Combustion Man" has an eye-shaped Power Tattoo (we hope) on his forehead based directly off the Hindu God Shiva's eye, complete with the three stripes of ash crossing it. Like Shiva, he can fire explosive blasts from it. P'Li from the Sequel Series _The Legend of Korra_ has similar abilities, although the design is different.
-   _The Batman_'s version of Spellbinder has a third eye, which functions as Hypnotic Eyes.
-   _Ben 10_: Xylene, a telekinetic alien and old girlfriend of Max, has a third eye on her forehead.
-   In _Celebrity Deathmatch_, Willie Nelson defeats Tony Bennett when he takes off his bandanna, revealing his third eye, which vaporizes his opponent.
-   Odval, King Zog's adviser from _Disenchantment_, has a third eye which is usually hidden by his hat. It doesn't seem to be much of a secret, as he removes his hat willingly a few times, though he never leaves it off for long. A line of dialogue implies he also has a _fourth_ eye, though we haven't seen it yet — and we _have_ seen him mostly naked.
-   In _The Midnight Gospel_, when Clancy wishes to end a simulation, he blows on a shofar, after which a third eye appears on his forehead and he is transported back to the Ribbon.
-   _The Owl House_:
    -   Boscha has three eyes, with her third one located in her forehead. It appears to be genetic, as Eda's flashback to school days in "Them's the Breaks, Kid" has a Recurring Extra with three eyes who looks very similar to her.
    -   The unnamed teacher for the Illusion track also has a third eye on their forehead, which is rather ironic when you consider the fact that she's teaching a form of magic that's all about deception, the exact opposite of what a third eye would usually represent.
-   Tom Lucitor in _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ has a third eye on his forehead, inherited from his demon mother.
-   Garnet from _Steven Universe_ has a third eye, which is usually hidden behind her Cool Shades. It's there because she's a fusion, and one of her components, Sapphire, has only one eye. Also, while Gem fusions often have more than two eyes, only Garnet's is seen to enable her to see what others cannot — her "Future Vision", though that ability comes from Sapphire, who is a Seer Cyclops.
-   Whenever Lion-O invokes "Sight Beyond Sight" in _ThunderCats (1985)_, he holds the Sword of Omens before his face with its red orb, the Eye of Thundera, positioned level to his forehead like an actual third eye.

    Real Life 

-   The late-great comedian Bill Hicks claimed that after eating psychedelic drugs, his (metaphorical) third eye opened.
-   Vertebrates at one point actually used to have a third eye in their foreheads. It's purpose was a lot less exciting than what fiction would suggest, though: it merely served to detect the brightness of the sun overhead, same as the ocelli in insects. As vertebrates grew larger and their two main eyes became more advanced, the third eye became more and more useless until at one point evolution scrapped it altogether. Only a scant few lizards retain this organ.
    -   The Tuatara has a third eye on top of its head called a parietal eye. It's useless for sight but it has its own lens, cornea, and retina, which suggests that it evolved from a real eye. It is only visible in hatchlings and it gets covered with scales as it ages. Many fish and amphibians also have a parietal eye, but it is less well developed than the Tuatara's, and often hard to notice externally. They are mostly used to regulate hormones that are on a day/night cycle.
-   Most species of arthropods have one or more ocelli (simple eyes or eye spots) between their normal eyes though they often are only visible with close examination, or disappear in their adult phase. Triops gets is name from having three eyes. Sea monkeys or brine shrimp, also have them.
