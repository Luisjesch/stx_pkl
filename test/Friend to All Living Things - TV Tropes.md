_"What is this place; filled with so many wonders  
Casting its spell that I am now under?  
Squirrels in the trees, and the cute little bunnies...  
Birds flying free, and bees with their honey..."_

A character, often but not Always Female and The Hero(ine) of the piece, is shown to be almost supernaturally innocent, sweet, altruistic, or any combination thereof, by the way that all manner of wild forest creatures flock to her. Deer will shyly eat out of her hand, chipmunks will frolic at her feet, and birds will alight on her finger, shoulder or head (and not void their bowels while doing so). If the character is male (usually in reference to St. Francis of Assisi being the patron saint of animals) he will instead be shown as wise, calm and kind-hearted. Any other person approaching will break the spell and send the timid woodland animals fleeing, but not before they witness the supernatural wonder of their loving heart in action.

As for the animals, they will all be cute in most examples. This usually does not extend to Always Chaotic Evil species, and virtually never towards the Big Bad. Sometimes it does, though, developing some very interesting hero-villain interactions. Sometimes, the heroine has such influence over the wild creatures that they will perform small tasks for her. In the case of gods or saints, flowers will spring up at their feet.

Some works acknowledge that the ability to befriend _any_ living thing could be a LOT more impressive than it seems. It's easy to forget that the same princess whose singing summons an entire forest full of animals could, if she so chooses, send her animal friends to beat the tar out of you. Being Friend To All Living Things will sometimes also mean the person is a Fluffy Tamer, in which case they're even friends to snarling, terrifying living things.

This is often parodied. If the parody is clearly referencing the Disney Animated Canon examples, it falls under Disney Creatures of the Farce, and the examples should go there.

A frequent attribute of the All-Loving Hero and Princess Classic. Although a Common Mary Sue Trait it does not necessarily make a character such. With females, this may be related to the myth that only a virgin girl may approach a unicorn. While Friend to All Children _sounds_ similar, it isn't necessarily the same thing—and, unlike this, is about just as likely to be a male trait as a female one.

A Sub-Trope of Nature Lover. A Sister Trope to Green Thumb, Fluffy Tamer (a friend to dangerous living things), Nature Hero (especially a female one) and Nature-Loving Robot (When the character is a robot). Compare Cloudcuckoolander, Licked by the Dog, Better with Non-Human Company, and Good Taming, Evil Taming. Contrast Evil-Detecting Dog, Enemy to All Living Things, Animals Hate Him, Bad People Abuse Animals, and Cruella to Animals.

This is _**not**_ to be confused with Animal Lover. While most Friends to All Living Things _are_ Animal Lovers, they are not the same trope. Basically, an Animal Lover likes animals (but animals don't necessarily like them back), while a Friend to All Living Things is liked _by_ animals (but doesn't necessarily like them back).

    Comic Books 

## DC

-   All creatures of the sea instinctively recognize Aquaman as their king, and he can communicate with them.
-   Subverted/parodied in _Beetle Bailey_ — the chaplain (an appropriate sort of character for this) just had crumbs of food on his clothes that the animals liked. He's also played it more straight, as has Zero, who's innocently dumb and used to animals from the farm where he used to live.
-   Catwoman, in several interpretations, has a feline-specific version. From the tiniest kitten to the largest tiger, there's something about her that they all instinctively trust.
-   Unsurprisingly, Catman has shown a similar affinity, particularly with the big cats.
-   Harley Quinn can not only domesticate two hyenas but during her solo practically ran an animal shelter out of her home and had all kinds of species coexisting and cuddling up to her, from armadillos and raccoons to snakes. She even has them eating off her without worry of being harmed.
-   The Penguin has a similar ability regarding birds. A Secret Origins special written by Neil Gaiman even has one of his ex-henchmen describing this with awe to a TV crew.
-   Poison Ivy is a Friend to All Living _Plants._ She is often depicted as being motivated by a desire to protect them, and they will do her bidding.
-   The Silver and Bronze Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl/Hawkwoman had the ability to speak with and befriend Earth birds.
-   _The Death of Superman_: Subverted by Superman villain Doomsday. In one of his first appearances, while he was still wandering aimlessly through a forest, a deer came up and nuzzled his hand. Doomsday, of course, broke the poor deer's neck. He did the same thing to a bird that landed on his palm.
-   One of Wonder Woman's more obscure powers is "Unity With Beasts," a gift from the goddess Artemis that fits this trope perfectly.

## Marvel

## Other

-   In _The Crow_, Eric Draven is shown with all of the cats living in a tenement happily following him. In an interesting subversion, Eric isn't that knowledgeable about cats — he names one Gabriel, and it turns out he's a she. A pregnant she.
-   Issue #4 of _Princess Natasha_ (based on the KOL web cartoon), Natasha uses her talent of communicating with animals to save a passel of zoo animals from the clutches of her evil uncle (who is also principal of the school she attends).
-   Parodied in _Strangers in Paradise_, when Katchoo dreams she's a Disney princess, despite being unlike that in her waking life. She charms birds and chipmunks with her singing for all of a few moments, when the dream turns nightmarish as the animals shun her for smelling of death.

    Comic Strips 

-   Zero from _Beetle Bailey_ loves animals and they love him. He once wouldn't throw away the camouflage he had applied to his fatigues because birds had built a nest in it. Other strips see him feeding birds or squirrels who dance for him in return.
-   _Footrot Flats_: Wal's best friend Cooch, although, unusually for this trope, he isn't a vegetarian and will kill animals to eat. At one point he removes swarming bees from Wal's house by walking up with neither protective gear nor smoke, tugging the branch, and dumping the swarm into a cardboard box, and seems to get away without any stings.
-   _Garfield_:
    -   One strip had Garfield parody the trope, while relaxing on the farm, where a bunch of cute animals gather around him. He then says: "Walt Disney, eat your heart out."
    -   In an early Sunday comic, where he was out expressing that he loves all the animals in the field he was in, and invited them to his home for dinner, much to Jon Arbuckle's shock.
    -   In another Sunday comic, a bunch of cute woodland creatures gather around Pooky and even a rainbow appears behind them. Disgusted, Garfield says "That's even too much for me..." and leaves.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Weasley Girl,_ an AU where Ron Weasley was born a girl, Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley is this, combined with Fluffy Tamer—according to Word of God this being a case of Flanderization of how animals in canon would occasionally take a liking to Ron for no particular reason. Ronnie's penchant for befriending animals does not extend to humans, though; she's got too much of Ron's temper, insensitivity, and foot-in-mouth syndrome for that.
-   _Ill Met by Moonlight_: Due to his supernatural heritage, Steven possesses a natural magnetism when it comes to animals, strays, and birds following him around. This seems to be a form of vampiric hypnosis that Steven unconsciously emits, unintentionally doing this to the werewolf Amethyst.
-   Carried over from the source material, Lydia is this in the Contractually Obligated Chaos series. She is able to communicate with animals and tends them when they're injured, and they in turn aid her as they're able. It becomes a plot point in later installments.
-   Amy in the _Sonic the Hedgehog_ fic _Fallen Angel_ has a way with (non-Funny Animal) animals. Growing up a friendless orphan, she had a lot of free time on her paws and spent it playing with animals.

-   In _Girl Genius_ fanfic _Raised by Jägers_, Agatha grows up in Mama Gkika's Jager hospital and the Mechanicsburg sewers. As such she has contact with a lot of strange Spark-made constructs and critters, and her compassion towards them is a defining character trait.
-   Aurora's male counterpart Bryan (Prince Rory) in the _Sleeping Beauty_ Rule 63 fanfic _The Prince And The Spindle_ . Not only is he friends with the forest animals, but protects them from hunters. He meets Princess Petra after having his owl and bird friends steal her bow and arrow, assuming she was hunting, but she tells them its just for show so she could leave the castle.
-   Deconstructed in _A Visit To The Pet Shop_ . From an outside perspective, someone who tries to dunk his fingers in the snapping turtle pond despite all the warning signs looks like a suicidal idiot who shouldn't be allowed to have a pet. Even though the turtle lets Aziraphale pet her, the store owner fears for the safety of his pet snake (his 'pet' is actually Crowley, who can take care of himself).
-   _A Thing of Vikings_: Yngvarr, he isn't called the Merry for nothing. In fact he is so friendly he was able to bond with _six_ dragons. He's allowed to keep all of them to appease the Norwegian jarls' concerns that Norway isn't getting enough dragons.
-   Luz in _An Odd Little Family_ has a habit of befriending stray animals, having befriended various raccoons in Gravesfield and taking a large centipede from Bonesborough as a pet.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Book of Life_:
    -   Maria Posada has the ability to draw flocks of birds to her and have them hang around being cute and musical.
    -   La Muerte. All creatures love her.
-   The Disney Princesses are famous for this.
    -   Snow White is probably the Ur-example. Watch the scene on YouTube, starting around 3:20. She's a sweetheart, and friendly woodland creatures flock to her when she's upset, and even help her with housework.
    -   Surprisingly, Brom Bones from _The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad_. While sharing beer with his buddies, he kindly smashes open the beer barrel top so his horse and the dogs can share a drink too.
    -   _Cinderella_ begins with the kind heroine's animal friends waking her up in the morning and helping her shower and get dressed. They also make her a dress while she's too busy with her chores, and eventually end up saving the day in the end. In a deleted scene, the Prince was this as well, playing a hunting game with a deer.
    -   The gentle Briar Rose (Princess Aurora) in _Sleeping Beauty_ has a host of animal friends who steal the prince's clothes so they could assemble together as a kind of homemade dream prince.
    -   _Beauty and the Beast_: Downplayed. Birds flock to Belle, but they abandon her for the Beast when they see he's got more food, and her trusty horse likes her well enough, but tries to run away when she's being attacked by wolves. Belle _tries_ to talk to farm animals, but they don't seem to understand what she's saying, so it's just another reason for the townspeople to think she's insane.
    -   The open-minded Pocahontas is a particularly intense example. She has her raccoon and hummingbird companions; though the weirdest moment is probably during _Colors of the Wind_, where she helps show John Smith the importance of understanding living creatures by picking up a bear cub in front of its mother. She's even friends with a willow _tree_.
    -   Downplayed with Rapunzel from _Tangled_, who has a pet chameleon and manages to befriend Maximus, although she goes out of her way to do so by petting and cooing over him in order to convince him to postpone his capture of Flynn for a day so he can take her to see the floating lights for her birthday. It helps that Maximus is a trained horse with intelligence that at least matches that of an average human, and possibly exceeds it, who can be reasoned with when talked to. He even becomes an actual member of the Royal Guard and becomes friends with his former enemy, Flynn Rider, after the latter reforms.
    -   Downplayed Trope with the compassionate Anna from _Frozen_, whose horse flees when it gets spooked during a quest to rescue Anna's sister and kingdom, but who also manages to attract and befriend a group of baby ducks during "For the First Time in Forever", can tame Hans's horse and quickly befriends Kristoff's reindeer Sven.
    -   _Ralph Breaks the Internet_ has an Homage when the Disney Princesses are quizzing Vanellope. At one point, Cinderella asks, "Do animals talk to you?" As she says this, she is flanked by Jasmine petting Rajah and Pocahontas with Meeko on her arm, all while Cinderella herself is carrying Gus and one of the female mice in her hands and has Jaq and the birds from her film perched all over her.
-   Disney also gave us a rare male example in the form of Antonio Madrigal from _Encanto_. Like all of his family members (except for Mirabel), he gains a magical superpower when he turns five years old. In his case, it's the ability to talk to animals. He quickly befriends toucans, coatimundis, capybaras, tapirs, and even a jaguar, which lets him ride around on its back.
-   Jailbreak from _The Emoji Movie_. She removes her wig and hat to reveal her crown and then uses some of her princess powers to summon a ride home. First she whistles sweetly and dances and then whistles more authoritatively. As the Twitter icon flaps into view, High Five exclaims, "Birds do love princesses! It's not a myth."
-   The Princess Melisande from _The Flight of Dragons_. Sir Orin says that her purity, grace, and innocence is an inspiration. She can summon the Silver Owls of the Full Moon through her singing only.
-   Red Puckett in _Hoodwinked!_, if her song "Great Big World" is any indication. Many of the creatures of the forest know her by her first name, but she is their delivery girl. In that number, there's also a scene where hummingbirds carry her on her bike across a river (the Wolf, who is observing her through the bushes, comments, "Whoa! Creepy!"). After the sour encounter with the Wolf, Red tricks him into falling off a cliff by handing her hooded cloak off to these same hummingbirds. Flippers lampshades it by reassuring Granny that the only thing Red is guilty of is "flying a swarm of hummingbirds without a license". Red is not a _total_ Friend to All Living Things, though, as she does use physical violence on the Wolf and on Boingo at separate points in the movie.
-   Hiccup in _How to Train Your Dragon_ becomes this, at least to dragons. He gets to the point that he can win over the trust of virtually any dragon (except for the humongous ones).
    -   He actually does at least earn the tolerance of the good Bewilderbeast in the second movie, simply by not being an asshole to him or any of his wards. The Red Death from the first movie is a vicious cannibal whose own brood is afraid of her, and in the sequel, Hiccup is simply incapable of overriding the sheer amount of abuse the Bad Bewilderbeast had suffered under Drago's command.
    -   Must be genetic as Hiccup’s mother Valka unlike the rest of the vikings cared deeply for dragons to the point where she refused to return to Berk after being carried off by one and lived among them. Valka is delighted that her son shares her ministrations and eventfully returns home knowing everyone now loves dragons as much as she does.
-   Lilo Pelekai in the _Lilo & Stitch_ franchise is able to befriend most alien creatures, primarily Stitch and many of Jumba's other genetic experiments, who are mostly animalistic in behavior.
-   Johnny Appleseed in _Melody Time_. It helps that he doesn't carry any sort of weapon, but having the ability to _pet a skunk_ takes a true air of benevolence.
-   In _My Little Pony: A New Generation_, Hitch Trailblazer has the uncanny ability to inspire devotion in any animal he meets, whether he wants it or not.
-   Subverted in _Oliver & Company_: the character whom the birds help dress up in the morning is a spoiled, vain show-dog, voiced by Bette Midler, singing one of her songs of course.
-   Daria from _The Princess and the Pea_. She even manages to befriend a bear and name him Balthazar.
-   A male example from Disney; Cody from _The Rescuers Down Under_ is good friends with a lot of animals from the Australian outback, including a kangaroo, some wombats and a giant golden eagle.
-   Tae Young in _Turning Red_ is shown to be loved by animals especially birds. This is shown when a dove with an injured leg nuzzles up to him.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The eponymous _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_ is a male example of this used straight in a comedy. Animals instinctively know to obey him. He suffered an Heroic BSoD and retreated to a Buddhist monastery when he failed to rescue a raccoon. He's able to get animals to protect him by using baby talk. The only exception is bats, which he absolutely hates.
-   The White Queen in _Alice in Wonderland (2010)_ is beloved by people, animals, and even furniture.
-   Star in _American Honey_ is shown to have a connection with animals, even insects. She captures a bee trapped indoors and sets it free outside, and later has a moment where she interacts with a bear.
-   _Bloodthirsty_: Grey is a vegan who refuses to eat meat out of concern for animals, and is upset when she accidentally kills a rabbit while backing up her car. This makes her hallucinations of devouring animals while turning into one especially disturbing for her, with an increasing craving to eat meat. She eventually kills a mouse while Vaughn urges her on.
-   Barbarella in _Barbarella_ manages to combine 1960s softcore erotica with a superhuman innocence: she gives an angel the inspiration to fly again, she manages to befriend the only decent people in a City of Evil, and she goes beyond a Friend to All Living Things when she feels sorry for the Excessive Machine after it burns down because she was more than it could handle. The only people who manage to dislike her to the end turn out to be the irredeemably evil characters in the film.
-   There's a running theme in _Children of Men_ that animals like Theo, even the farm dogs who supposedly hate everyone. He's also the one who manages to get Kee's baby to calm down near the end.
-   In _Cinderella (2015)_, Ella befriends any animals she meets, including the mice in the cellar or their old family horse. She also saves a stag that the prince is hunting by warning it of his approaching party. She goes so far as to even forgive _Lady Tremaine_, who had treated her horribly (especially since the death of her father) for practically the whole film.
-   _Corky Romano_: Corky is a Kindly Vet who adores animals, repeatedly going out of his way to befriend or help them. When a client wants her cantankerous, sick old cat euthanized, Corky refuses as he just can't kill any living thing. He's an extremely nice, goofy man whom most animals seem to instantly like.
-   Disney's _Enchanted_ plays this very straight in the animated segment before memorably parodying it in the live-action part — by having her singing charmed vermin in New York City into cleaning Robert's apartment.
-   Altaira in _Forbidden Planet_ has this ability, even charming a tiger, until she falls in love with Captain Adams.

-   In _Green Mansions_, Rima (Audrey Hepburn) is a jungle girl who cares deeply about the animals in the rainforest, especially the fawn that follows her. In Real Life, Hepburn raised the fawn as a pet at her home to better bond with it for the filming.
-   _Harry Potter_
    -   Rubeus Hagrid, a Gentle Giant Fluffy Tamer, loves all kinds of creatures and especially ones with massive talons, fangs, scales, and poisonous stings. Hagrid was heartbroken when his Hippogriff buckbeak was put to death in the _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_, then was overjoyed when he escaped and Hagrid was a weeping mess when Aragog his Giant Spider died in _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_. Hagrid also gets along with domestic animals like his beloved boarhound Fang, looked after Ron's pet rat Scabbers ( Peter Pettigrew was just hiding in Hagrid's hut) and Hagrid is the one who got Headwig the owl for Harry in the first place.
    -   Newton Scamander from _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_ gives Hagrid a run for his money when it comes to this trope as he is such a Fluffy Tamer he keeps dozens of superbeasts (some of which are classified as untameable) in his suitcase at all times and goes around the globe protecting them from wizards as a Zoologist. The only time we see Newt _flip out_ in _Fantastic Beasts_ is when his creatures are taken from him by the American Ministry of Magic, Newt even yells hysterically that they're harmless as he's being pulled away. At one point Newt even Invokes Humans Are the Real Monsters, stating that being in New York City his creatures are in danger while surrounded by the most dangerous beasts of all.
    -   Luna Lovegood invokes this in the _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_ with the Thestrals as unlike in the books she literally goes out and feeds them raw meat _barefoot_.
    -   Neville with Trevor his toad and assorted magical plants.
-   _Help!_: Algernon claims to be this.
-   _The Hunger Games_: Primrose "Prim" Everdeen. Animals love her. The family cat, Buttercup, only responds positively to her.
-   One female character in _Ilya Muromets_ (The Sword and the Dragon) is portrayed this way. In one scene she sings cheerfully, surrounded by forest animals.
-   _I Really Hate My Job_: What does Suzy do when she spots a rat in the kitchen? Interview it, and ask how its day has been.
-   In _Jurassic World_, _Velociraptor_\-trainer Owen Grady shows genuine care for every dinosaur he encounters and has somehow managed to train four of the most dangerous animals on Earth. He is the only person the raptor sisters won't kill on sight. However, when it comes to the _Indominus rex_, even Owen doesn't want anything to do with it. He calls Claire and InGen out for isolating and mistreating it, and beyond his general suspicion of a novel hybrid, his disgusted dialogue with Claire amounts to "Thanks to you guys, it's too late for anything to make friends with this one."
-   In M. Night Shyamalan's _Lady in the Water_, the identifying mark of The Healer is that he/she attracts butterflies.

-   _X-Men Film Series_

    Literature 

-   An interesting variation in _100 Cupboards_ with Caleb, a Rare Male Example and Badass Normal Archer Archetype. He still fits the trope, though, travelling with a dog and a flock of befriended hawks, and even charms an injured wolf at one point.
-   _Animal Inn_: Val's never met an animal that didn't like her. Even Gigi the capuchin monkey in Book 3, despite her misbehaving, does genuinely like Val.
-   _Animorphs_: Cassie gets along swimmingly with all the animals at her farm, and has such affinity for critters that it makes her the best morpher in the group. Shes also quite dismayed to find that her friends think she'd put the lives of animals over their own. Note that it wasn't even a question of killing an animal but eating a polar bear's leftovers (a dead baby seal).

-   The Barre family gift in _Annals of the Western Shore_ gives its holder the potential to be this. It's often used to call animals so they can be hunted more easily, but Gry refuses to use it for that purpose and remains squarely within this trope.
-   Stephen Maturin in the _Aubrey-Maturin_ series; almost any animal immediately takes to him, including sloths, wombats, dogs, cats, orangutans and aardvarks, usually with hilarious results. The only exception is a llama.
-   _The Beasts of Clawstone Castle_: Rollo adores any and every kind of animal - he even adopted a giant lizard from the zoo - which puts him in a perfect position to appreciate the cows.
-   In Anne Bishop's _Black Jewels_ trilogy, Jaenelle, being made up of both human and animal dreams, is the catalyst for the reconciliation of the kindred and Blood when she convinces the kindred to open their realms again.
-   In Andre Norton's _Catseye_, Troy had an uncanny skill to work with animals, despite not having done so for years. He has a telepathic ability to communicate with the enhanced animals.

-   _Conan the Barbarian_: In "Beyond the Black River," "Zogar boasted that he could summon wild beasts to do his bidding." Then, he inverts just about all the other traits usually associated with it.
-   Cthulhu Mythos:
    -   Subverted with Nyarlatothep, who is described as having wild beasts licking his hands, and in some RPGs based on the mythos, it is specifically mentioned that no animal can attack him. This is probably related to his unnatural charisma and has some effect on people too (he tends to gather a large following wherever he goes). He's the exact opposite of sweet and innocent.
    -   Played somewhat straight in _The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath_, where Randolph Carter befriends the cats living in the dream world. He aids them on several occasions, and is aided by them in return.
-   In _The Dark Artifices_ is the shadowhunter Tiberius Blackthorn. He has the ability to make even wild animals quickly trusting, and to be touched and taken away by him, much to the chagrin of his older brother Julian.
-   Inverted in Darkest Powers with Derek, who tends to send animals into screaming fits of rage or fear just by being within a fifty foot radius of them. He explains this to Chloe as, being that he’s a werewolf, the animals see a human but smell something entirely different, which makes them nervous. It’s still hilarious when he mentions that a Chihuahua randomly attacked him at one point and took a chunk out of his hand, though.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Subverted in _Moving Pictures_. When sending for a new archchancellor, the wizards select Ridicully the Brown on the note that he loves nature and speaks to animals and assume that he will be very naive and easy to murder because of this trope. Turns out, he's an avid hunter, his speaking involves yelling at birds to shut up, and damn near impossible to kill to boot. He single handedly stops the University's tradition of Klingon Promotion. It is said that he does a lot for rare animals, mainly, keeping them rare.
    -   In _Wyrd Sisters_ the population of the local forest, carnivore and herbivore alike, shows up on Granny Weatherwax's front lawn, in an attempt to silently guilt her into getting a new king of Lancre. Subverted in that her response is to say, "I don't know what's going on, but when it wears off, some of you buggers better be quick on your feet or you'll be lunch."
    -   Geoffrey in _The Shepherd's Crown_ is a straight example; a strict vegetarian who hates the idea of hurting any living creature, he has a keen insight into animals and an amazing calming effect on them. Including humans.
-   _The Divine Comedy_: In her first appearance, the gardener of Eden is surrounded by friendly nature. She lightly stands on yellow and red flowers, the birds sing a perfect harmony with the leaves, and the trees blow in the breeze lightly enough to keep the peace of Matilda's garden.
-   In _Dragon Bones_, some of the heroic characters show traces of this. Ward is very good with horses, and manages to befriend the fierce stallion that killed his father. Oreg even befriends and _talks_ to a rat-like species of ... ship vermin. Both agree that the Basilik the villain used against them is a beautiful creature, but should better be kept behind bars, so to speak. Their ability to befriend wildlife is limited. It may have something to do with the fact that they both have dragon blood, dragons in this setting being sentient creatures that can communicate with humans ... why would that ability be limited to humans?
-   In _The Epic of Gilgamesh_, Enkidu, a "wild man" created by the gods from clay, initially lives peacefully among the deer and gazelles of the wilderness. After he becomes civilized, however, he loses this aptitude, and the animals now fear him as they would any ordinary human.
-   This is a mixed blessing for Una in _The Faerie Queene_: On the one hand, an army of forest critters save her from being raped by Sansloy, but then they practically kidnap her and force her to stay with them so they can worship her until she's rescued by Satyrane.

-   _The Girl from the Miracles District_ has a Rare Male Example in Robin. Animals love him, and his very presence seems to give them a high — which ends up being a tad problematic when he has to go board a ferry and the bomb-sniffing dogs are overjoyed to be in his presence.
-   Katie Welker is friends with and telepathically communicates with a neighbor's cat in _The Girl with the Silver Eyes_ by Willo Davis Roberts.
-   Gnomes, as detailed in the 1977 bestseller _Gnomes_, are a whole race that fits the Trope, seeing as they speak fluent Animal. They usually help animals in trouble and are trusted by them. There are a few exceptions, however; they don't like cats and they have trouble getting along with polecats, rats, and similar animals.
-   In Edgar Rice Burroughs's _The Gods of Mars_, Thuvia can tame with her words the banths that seriously threatened the combined forces of John Carter and Tars Tarkas.
-   _The Hobbit_:
    -   Beorn is a Nature Hero and WereBear who keeps many animals on his plantations, all of whom directly serve with the animal speaking Beorn. Beorn is a vegetarian, doesn't use anything made from dead animals, and lives off a diet of honey and cream from his huge bees. The only animals Beorn will kill are the innately evil Wargs/Wolves, those animals Beorn will kill and skin without hesitation.
    -   Thranduil is described as being surrounded by birds and animals when he is first seen. This helps establish that although he has a hard exterior because of being betrayed and abandoned, he genuinely does have a good heart. This is also Tolkien making a conceptual link between ruling a nation and stewardship of the land. Thranduil is not just the King of the elves, but also the caretaker of the forest: not only responsible for the well-being of his subjects, but also for maintaining the balance of nature. His grief at his wife's passing is distracting him from both his ability to rule his people, and his ability to maintain the forest.
-   Prim in _The Hunger Games_. She brought home her cat Buttercup, who only likes _her_, as a mangy, worm-infested stray (Katniss wanted to drown him), adores her goat, Lady (Katniss prefers to think of her as a source of milk and money), and utterly failed at learning to hunt because she would cry over and want to heal any animal that Katniss shot.
-   A minor example in _Kushiel's Legacy_. The novice Liliane looks after the animals of the monastery and its visitors. The main characters' horses trail faithfully after her when she meets them and seem to prosper in her care. It's implied that at some point she suffered a head injury and is "simple" because of it; one character describes her as being touched by the gods.
-   In Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic children's novel _A Little Princess_, heroine Sara Crewe befriends and tames the rat who lives in her attic.
-   In _Lord of the Rings_, Treebeard and the Ents are this. Merry and Pippin convince them to attack Isengard by pointing to how Saruman has been destroying wildlife. This book also has Tom Bombadil and Goldberry who are very much this trope. Aragorn's healing powers and charisma work on animals as well as people, although he doesn't go out of his way to befriend animals they tend to like him a lot. This reveals him as a descendant of Luthien, and thus the royal line of Númenor. There is also a bond between the Maeras and the Kings of Rohan: the Maeras are semi-divine horses, created by Yavanna. Shadowfax, the white horse Theoden rides into battle at the end of Return of the King is descended from the Maeras. He actually survives the battle, and goes with Gandalf to the Undying Lands. Pretty much universally in Tolkien's mythos: animals like good guys and don't like bad guys.
-   In Colleen McCullough's _Masters of Rome_ series has a badass male example. Quintus Sertorius, a renegade Roman general and brilliant tactician possess an uncanny ability to attract and tame wild animals (including an eagle at one point.) A barbarian tribe even considers him a servant of the gods after observing him feed a skittish albino fawn from his hand.
-   _Mermaids of Eriana Kwai_: Eriana, the legendary Founder of the Kingdom, was born with a special gift for getting animals to do what she wanted. During a period of starvation, she summoned a herd of caribou so her people could slaughter and eat them. The Gaela, the goddess who gave Eriana her power, was so furious at her for abusing it that she sent the Aanil Uusha, the incarnation of death, to kill her entire tribe. He spared Eriana's life for reasons that are no longer remembered. Eriana traveled from her homeland to the island that now bears her name, where she spent the rest of her life protecting the animals of the island.
-   In Rudyard Kipling's story "The Miracle of Purun Bhagat" from _The Second Jungle Book_, the title character renounces his worldly goods and becomes a holy man, befriending all of the animals that live in the hills near his shrine.
-   Sings-To-Trees in Nine Goblins. The other elves might _pretend_ they are, but who gets stuck with a problematic unicorn birth or a leaky troll at ungodly hours?
-   In _One Hundred Years of Solitude_, Jerk with a Heart of Gold Mauricio Babilonia is always followed around by swarms of yellow butterflies.
-   In Jim C Hines's The Princess Series, Danielle ("Cinderwench") is often underestimated because she has no obvious skills or magic. However, she can speak to animals and strongly persuade them to agree with her. Beyond that, animals simply like her, and will help her out even if she doesn't ask for (or want) their help.
-   In L. Jagi Lamplighter's _Prospero in Hell_, Calvin remembers Miranda being like this, as a child, singing to an orchid to make it grow. Mephisto's staff summons creatures but does not make them obedient. Mephisto manages by friendliness.
-   Aretzes in A.L. Phillips's _The Quest of the Unaligned_ become this as one facet of their earth magic. For example, Karetzina of Brighthollow keeps six badgers: Diamond, Jasper, Opal, Beryl, Amber, and Lord Broccoli.

-   Subverted in _The Restaurant at the End of the Universe_, where Ford Prefect stands alone in a field, smiling serenely. A deer comes up and rubs against him, whereupon Ford immediately reaches out and breaks its neck. He attributes the effect to "pheromone control" and notes, "You just need to emit the right smell". Ford learned the technique from a couple of ex-Pralite Monks, whose devotional training gives them amazing mental control. It's specifically mentioned that _most_ Pralite Monks leave the order "just after finishing their devotional training and just before taking their final vows to remain locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives."
-   _The Secret Garden_ has two gender-flipped examples: Ben Weatherstaff, who is good friends with the robin who leads Mary to the garden, and Dickon, who has tamed darn-near every creature on the moor.
-   The Eco Princess, from _the secret lives of Princesses_. Her court is made up of snakes, zebras, tigers, cheetahs and pathers. Birds nest in her hair, and tell her stories from long ago. Spends her evenings chatting with her closest confidants and animal protecters.
-   Beren, a hero in Tolkien's _The Silmarillion_, is helped by forest animals to avoid capture by Morgoth's troops, and converts to vegetarianism out of gratitude. Luthien is also an example. Her (supernatural) charisma also works on animals.
-   Rosie, the heroine of Robin McKinley's Sleeping Beauty novel _Spindles End_, has the fairy-given ability to communicate with animals. Later, when she discovers that she's actually the country's missing princess (not a spoiler since the reader knows it from the get-go), the animals around her are shocked by the revelation, but immediately determine that "if she is a princess, then she is _our_ princess."
-   Another Rare Male Example in _The Spirit Thief_ with Eli and spirits. His success as a thief comes from the fact that spirits absolutely adore him and will bend over backwards to do what he asks them for, and he's friends with them in turn.
-   _Sweet & Bitter Magic_: Wren, as one effect of being a source, is loved by all animals. Even wild ones come fearlessly over to her with immediate affection.
-   In _A Tale of..._, Snow White's Wicked Stepmother deconstructs this trope. From her POV, it seems like Snow White has gone mad due to her father's death, to the point where she takes comfort in talking to woodland creatures.
-   In the Tortall Universe by Tamora Pierce:
    -   Veralidaine Serrasri of _The Immortals_ gets along famously with animals of all kind right from the start of the story. Somewhat unusually, she does admit to playing favorites with some species (bats and wolves) and disliking others (chickens, who she finds offensively stupid). It turns out her Wild Magic has something to do with it, making animals see her as one of them even before she can control it. And it turns out to go even further than that — of course she and animals will love each other, she's basically a nature demigoddess.
    -   Keladry of _Protector of the Small_ has no wild magic, but she has a habit of taking in strays and nursing injured animals even before she goes to the palace for knight training. Once she gets _there_, the animals become companions and quasi-sentient helpers because Daine's proximity has made them more intelligent and therefore inclined to assist their benefactor.
-   _Rose of Rapture_: Protagonist Isabella rejects traditional feminine pursuits in favor of caring for wounded animals. She keeps a menagerie of animals she's healed in her stable.
-   _The Underland Chronicles_: Boots has this as her 'superpower', even extending to the creepy-crawly ones.
-   Lissa Dragomir from _Vampire Academy_. She loves animals and they love her. She has her roommate's cat cozying up to her, and heals a raven. That is why Victor and Natalie Dashkov brutalize animals — to see if she can work her spirit magic on them. Unfortunately they tend to be beyond help when she finds them, and the one time they're not beyond help Rose stops her from healing them.
-   _Villains by Necessity_: Kaylana is always very concerned for the wellbeing of animals she encounters, far more than she is toward humans or other sapients, and relates to their concerns generally. In turn, they're drawn to her and will help Kaylana in various ways. It's downplayed, and due to her power as a druid.

-   Justified for Francis Sandow in two novels and a short story by Roger Zelazny, but only for animals he's designed, on the planets he's created. When a lizard is momentarily frightened of him in one book, it shows he's entering enemy territory.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Beverly Hillbillies_: Elly May Clampett is an Outdoorsy Gal from the Ozarks who can effortlessly befriend any animal, from deer to eagles and bears. She can even convince a bird and a cat to get along, although she has mixed results in convincing her animal friends to play nice with her human family.
-   This was subverted in the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ episode "Bargaining Part 1" in which Willow lures a fawn to her in the forest...and she then slaughters it to collect its blood for the rite which will raise Buffy from the dead.
-   In the _The Charmings_, the Prince returns home and notices how clean their house is:
    
    **Prince Eric:** Had the animals in again?
    
-   _The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance_: Deet starts her journey as an animal caretaker in the Grottan caves. Being attacked by Darkening-affected creatures does nothing to quell her love for animals, which continues even after she reaches the surface. Whenever she can, she tries to befriend all the creatures she meets. Which makes her becoming a Walking Wasteland after absorbing the Darkening to save her friends all the more tragic.
    
    **Deet:** (running from a Spitter) "I used to get along with animals!"
    
-   _The Goodies_. After Tim Brooke-Taylor becomes Bigfoot (his right foot has swollen from walking around the sides of mountains, looking for legendary creatures) he retreats to the wild (so people will stop laughing themselves to death over the sight of his enormous foot) and becomes friends to all the animals, who join him in a rendition of the "Bigfoot" theme song.
-   _The Hexer_: Geralt in his youth, right down to taming a she-wolf with The Power of Friendship and instantly going to help a survivor of a pogrom, despite himself barely getting by during the Trial of Mountains. Even as an adult witcher, a monster hunter for hire, he only picks jobs where the monsters are _actually_ dangerous to someone, rather than going into the wilderness to hunt those that _supposedly_ are.
-   Vince Noir from _The Mighty Boosh_ can talk to animals and is referred to as Mowgli in Flares — although he often "squanders" his gift by talking to the animals at the zoo about Gary Numan and and dressing the lion up as Adam Ant. Sometimes his boundless charisma does prove useful, however.
    
    **Howard:** What about the polar bear?  
    **Vince:** Oh, we got on.  
    **Howard:** You don't "get on" with a polar bear!  
    **Vince:** We did, we just clicked!
    
-   _Legends of Tomorrow_ gives us Amaya Jiwe. A woman with the ability to harness the abilities of and communicate with animals thanks to the totem she wears around her neck. She even manages to calm a rampaging _T. rex_ at one point, and an angry, giant telepathic gorilla at another point.

-   _Odd Squad_: Those working in the Creature Control department often fall under this trope. One such person is Agent Ocean, who runs the Creature Room at Precinct 13579 and is a Fluffy Tamer who cares for all sorts of odd creatures, to such an extent that he is more than willing to risk his own life to give one a chance at survival. It helps that he's also incredibly laid-back, and hardly anything fazes him.

-   A male example is given in _Power Rangers Wild Force_ with Cole: a boy raised by a jungle tribe who has the ability to communicate with animals. Naturally he tries to be friends with everyone he meets, including the Org monsters during his second battle, but to no avail when he realizes orgs do not have hearts.
-   The Janitor from _Scrubs_ becomes one of these when he starts wearing a baby blue uniform. While he switches back to gray to regain his "fearitude", he's later shown wearing it off duty, and surrounded by birds again.
-   An episode of Jim Henson's _The Storyteller_ called "Sapsorrow" showed the titular princess having this power. The episode was based on the German folk tale "Allerleirauh" and featured Princess Sapsorrow having her coat made by all her animal friends.
-   Subverted in _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_, where Cameron says this line after attempting to get a bird to land on her.
    
    **Cameron:** Goodbye bird. There's a 51% chance I wouldn't have killed you.
    
-   Sookie from _True Blood_. Right in the first episode she is licked by a stray dog and her grandma's cat is shown purring in her arms while she's having a dream.
-   Musashi Haruno from _Ultraman Cosmos_, a Martial Pacifist who hopes that some day humans and kaiju will be able to coexist peacefully, as he believes that giant monsters have the right to live in peace so long as they don't deliberately disrupt the peace of other beings. Cosmos himself thinks the same way, which is probably why he picked Musashi as his human host. In fact they've even successfully befriended a few of the monsters they've subdued over the course of the series.
-   _Ultraman X_ gives us Musashi's Spiritual Successor in Daichi Oozora, who has many of the same dreams and ideals — also shared by his titular Ultra. Since most of the kaiju in the series are normally in Sleep-Mode Size, Daichi and X keep them in that form and work towards bonding with the creatures and eventually reviving them to their full size.
-   _White Collar_: Interestingly enough, Neal Caffrey has a soft spot for kids and animals, and as much as people try, he's too charismatic for most of them to resist.
-   _Why Women Kill_: Bertram Filcott is an Affably Evil variant. Despite being a Serial Killer (albeit of the Obliviously Evil variety), he's well-liked in his community, and has a day job as a vet, which he's quite good at. The narrator notes that the animals under his care genuinely _love_ him. In a dark twist, this makes him _very_ good when it comes time to put a sick or injured pet down—he doesn't _like_ it, but it is very much part of the job, and he's comforting and gentle to both the animal and the owner. While he works, he makes the pet comfortable and gives a sweet speech about how loved they are, and how now their pain can end. He's also quick to assure the grieving owner that it's more merciful to let the pet die painlessly than have them live in pain. It just so happens he applies the exact same logic when deciding whether or not to kill a human.
-   _Wonder Woman_: Wonder Woman talks with dogs and birds several times. In "The Girl from Ilandia", she gives telepathic commands to the eponymous Ilandian's rescued dog, Tiger. He is apparently imbued by Wonder Woman with the intelligence to understand fairly complex orders and carry them out. Tiger even tracks down Diana Prince rather than Wonder Woman, although he did it by scent.
    
    **Wonder Woman:** Tiger, you take care of her and if she's in trouble you come and find me. Understand?
    
    **Tiger:** _barks (and later carries out these orders to the letter)_
    
-   _7 Yüz_: Gökçe of "Biyolojik Saat" has a soft spot for cats, but loves all animals and goes out of her way to help those in need. She quickly demonstrates her aptitude for understanding animals when she captures and calms a perturbed kitty in Metin's apartment.

    Music 

-   _Close to You_ by The Carpenters.
    
    _Why do birds suddenly appear, every time you are near?  
    Just like me, they long to be close to you._
    
-   Ben Fold's Five's "Kate" plays on this trope, to an admittedly exaggerated effect:
    
    _She plays "Wipeout" on the drums,  
    The squirrels and the birds come  
    Gather 'round to sing the guitar_
    
    -   And later, "And you can see the daisies in her footsteps," and "She never gets wet; she smiles and it's a rainbow."

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Bible_: Noah managed to get two of every species of every animal to get onto a giant ship and to live peacefully with each other for forty days and forty nights.

-   Saint Francis of Assisi loved animals and, according to legend, the feeling was mutual; he preached to birds, tamed a wolf, and even recreated the Nativity scene. This led to his being named the patron saint of animals. (Next to Buddha, he might be the most commonly featured figure in garden statues, often shown surrounded by birds and other critters.)
-   And Saint Martin of Porres. He's often represented with a dog, a cat, a bird and a mouse... that eat peacefully from the same dish placed at the saint's statue's feet.

-   In the Nart Sagas, Warzemeg assists a number of creatures on his quest to rescue Psatina: an injured hawk, a trapped wolf, a stranded catfish, and baby birds threatened by a snake. For his kindness, they promise to return the favor when he calls.
-   In Greek Mythology, Melampus showed kindness to a dead mother snake as a child, giving it a funeral and raising its young. In gratitude, the baby snakes licked his ears, allowing him to understand animal speech. He eventually won a kingdom and a wife with his powers.

    Photography 

-   Invoked on a postcard sold in the Third Reich which shows Adolf Hitler hand-feeding two roe deers (animals proverbial for their shyness), captioned "Der Führer als Tierfreund" ("The Führer as a friend to the animals"). The picture was taken around 1936 by Hitler's official photographer Heinrich Hoffmann.

    Podcasts 

-   _The Adventure Zone: Balance_, Magnus Burnsides is absolutely nuts about animals, especially dogs. He also shows serious reluctance every time he needs to kill an animal, even in self defence. He even hesitates to harm a Hunger-corrupted rhinoceros, which is essentially a mindless mass of destructive energy that was once an animal.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The Binder class from _Tome of Magic_ in the 3.5 rules has a vestige that grants an even better ability more in keeping with this trope. Animals start with a default attitude of friendly toward the Binder when this vestige is bound. Animal Empathy, by contrast, requires a check.
    -   A subversion can be found in the 2E _AD&D_ monster-books, which describe how ordinary rats or mice will emerge from hiding because they're drawn to a wererat's presence, timidly following the lycanthrope around. _D&D_ wererats, as it happens, are Always Lawful Evil and are Friends to Nobody.
    -   An 2E issue of _Dragon_ introduced the liminals, a race of Half Human Hybrids descended from water elementals with the power to befriend marine animals, especially dolphins.
    -   Fey in general in the game are like this, but especially nymphs. One edition states that wildlife love them _so_ much that they forget their instincts as far as predator and prey are concerned, and animals who are natural enemies gather together with each other simply to flock around the nymph to be petted and caressed.

-   The _Magic: The Gathering_ card Beloved Chapllain describes a character who charms "all the birds and beasts."
-   _Nobilis_: everything becomes like this within the confines of the 3e Locust Court, which can end very badly when you leave if you, say, picked up a disease that your body refused to harm. Characters who want to get in on this outside said Chancel can probably get by using the Afflictions system, which allows for things such as "Animals like me (3)", which means that miracles will periodically surround the character with cheerful and happy deer and whatnot, and you will get three miracle points whenever your entourage gets you into trouble.
-   _Rifts_ plays with this trope with the Simvan Monster Riders. They have psionic powers that makes all creatures of animal inteligence level se them as friends. They refuse to violate this trust so they preffer to hunt inteligent prey.
-   In _Tales from the Floating Vagabond_, characters with the Doolittle Effect can instantly befriend all but the most aggressive animals. The downside is that animals tend to follow the PC around, seeking their attention and affection.

    Theater 

-   In Into the Woods, Cinderella frequently talks to birds, and they appear to understand her. It's apparently not typical behavior, though, as when she asks the birds to carry out tasks for her, Little Red Riding Hood incredulously asks "You can talk to birds?"
-   In _Pokémon Live!_, Ash is friends to all Pokemon. His memories and pure heart even wreck Giovanni's plan by giving MechaMew2 knowledge of love and right and wrong.

    Web Animation 

-   In _Dusk's Dawn_ Doodlecute's talent is allying herself with nature and plants.
-   Rorschach from _Saturday Morning Watchmen_ is "friend to the animals/When he's not clowning around!"

    Webcomics 

-   Marsha of _College Roomies from Hell!!!_. She sees it as a curse, calling it "Snow White Syndrome"....until she realizes the ballistic value. It also becomes slightly disturbing during her Freak Out, when she goes off to murder her former best friend, riding Satan's own staff, cloaked by a massive swarm of bats.
-   Princess Maria from _Cursed Princess Club_. She is adored by animals to the point they dress her and do her hair each morning... despite her keeping her windows closed and sleeping on the top floor. Her little sister Gwendolyn is a Dark Is Not Evil example, as her bedroom is full of spiders, rats, and a bite-happy possum that fill the same role as the cuter animals in Maria's room do.
-   Subverted in _Dumnestor's Heroes_ by Dark Lordess Tyfnee. She first appears in silhouette with what looks like a bird, a butterfly and a fawn cuddling up to her while she sings about how her broken heart will be made whole when she finds the man she's looking for. The last panel reveals that the animals are actually a bat, a moth and a hyena, and the last line of Tyfnee's song is her need for vengeance.
-   Kanryl of _Ears for Elves_ isn't ever seen without animals of some kind, and ensures that others do not disturb any creatures.
-   _El Goonish Shive_:
-   Tavros from _Homestuck_ can commune with the many creatures of Alternia, though given the nature of Alternia the results can be terrifying. Somehow remains adorable, though.
-   _Magick Chicks_ parodies the trope, during the student council's camping trip in chapter 15. When Sandi notices the animals' unusual behavior and tries scaring them off, they gather around her instead. Birds even perch on her head and shoulders in time for Jacqui to snap a picture of it.
-   In _No Rest for the Wicked_, Prince Ricardo is also known as "Dick the Picky" for his disdain for princesses. The Boy (unaware he's right in front of him) sings a song about his seeing a princess who is this, and how the prince would think she must have fleas.
-   _Phantomarine_: Cal, although his is more of a Friend to All ''Dead'' Things scenario since they're all seagosts.
-   _Princess Princess_: Sadie, not least because she likes to spoil them with food.
-   Rees, the main character of _Serix_. She refuses to eat food made of any living thing, spends a portion of her meager wages to grow plants, fish, and nematodes on a desert planet, and has a habit of repairing damaged and discarded droids for no profit entirely because she thinks they're cute.
-   In _Squid Row_, Randie dreams of being helped by the Bluebird of Happiness and Nice Mice while cleaning up the coffee place.
-   _Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic_ has a story arc featuring a Disney Princess who can attract animals with her singing. A group of goblins, originally intending to kill and eat her, realizes the usefulness of this talent.

    Web Original 

-   In _Dream's_ "3 Hunters Finale Rematch" video, Dream seems to get help from animals at every turn. The first portion of the video has him tame wolves that he uses to counter the hunters' own wolves (though this trope is later called into question when he kills one of his own). He also uses a strider to get through the Nether (and later steals one of the hunters' own). When he leaves the Nether and is left to fall to his death, he is later saved by a horse (as clicking on a horse to ride it negates fall damage). And then, when swimming away from the hunters, he gets _four_ dolphins on his side, giving him a massive speed boost. And Dream outright lampshades this trope, referring to himself in the bonus video as a Disney princess.
-   In _Little Nuns_, the nun with the curly lock turns out to be a prodigy in animal raising and befriending. Not only does she have decent knowledge of all the animals she stumbles upon, she also raised an ostritch until it hatched and is on good terms with the monastery's stable animals too. Her parents ran a farm and animal sanctuary, which explains where she gets it from.
-   _Manic Pixie Dream Wife_: Simone, the titular manic-pixie, is concerned for animals and she starts rescuing them from a pet shop in the episode "Something for Profit". When she throws an under-sea-themed dinner party for her husband Chance, she claims their pet fish Morrissy insisted to join them, too.
-   Ping Ping from _Savage Divinity_ is an ancient turtle larger than a _T. rex_, who eats Kraken on the side. Despite this she goes out of her way not to hurt anyone undeserving and has baby rabbits sleeping in her shell on occasion.
-   _SCP Foundation_: SCP-999 is a Blob Monster that loves all living creatures, even omnicidal eldritch abominations like SCP-682.
-   _Whateley Universe_ example: Aquerna, who is kind and innocent, and has a special bond with squirrels and chipmunks. They'll do whatever she tells them to, and they'll follow her around.

    Real Life 

-   Steve Irwin loved most animals, and while he may have wrestled an awful lot of crocodiles, it was always to help them (by relocating them to safe places). There wasn't an animal on Earth he was afraid to hang around (except maybe hippos), and he was extremely devoted to his dog Sui, to the very end. Irwin _did_ say there was one type of animal that never got along with him — surprisingly, that was birds. He used to say that if he was ever killed by an animal, not to blame the animals because they were just protecting themselves from this scary ape-thing that was intruding on their territory. Unfortunately, after Steve Irwin died in a freak accident with a stingray while diving, many people forgot/ignored this and went on stingray killing rampages.
    -   His family carries on the tradition, with widow Terri and kids Bindi and Robert continuing his legacy at the Australia Zoo. Robert in particular seems to have inherited his father's way with animals, as he frequently feeds the crocs and posts many videos on his Twitter account in which he engages with various creatures. Betsy the curlew isn't entirely fond of him, but he's working on her "anger management" issues.

-   Bob Ross from _The Joy of Painting_ would often times show the audience wounded or orphaned animals that he and a local lady would take care of until they were old enough or healed enough to be released back into the wild. Bob would also often tell stories on the show about all the animals he had living in and around his house in Florida. He said he would release the animals into the wild, but they would often times stick around anyway and partake in the food he kept leaving out for them.
-   André the Giant loved animals and kept many on his North Carolina ranch because he liked that, unlike people, they didn't stare at him all the time.
-   According to _Ripley's Believe it or Not_, Elie Gourbeyre of Nouara, France could lure any bird to her shoulder by merely crooking her finger. This lasted only from the time she was six until she was twelve years old.
-   Values Dissonance: This type of character is almost Always Female... in North America and Northern Europe! In Latin America and Southern Europe... well, back then, it was a tomboy (Artemis / Diana the Greco-Roman goddess of wildlife). Nowadays it is a guy (Francesco D'Assisi). While in the USA it is often considered typical that All Girls Like Ponies — in many parts of the world this automatically marks you a tomboy.

-   American TV personality and bear attack victim Timothy Treadwell really, _really_ wanted to be this trope, and many of the film stubs he left behind show him playing with and adoring wild animals. Unfortunately (unlike Steve Irwin) he had very little practical sense for conservationism and probably did more harm than good, not to mention he was eventually killed by a bear who didn't reciprocate his fondness. His life was dramatized in _Grizzly Man_.
-   Capybaras are known for getting along quite well with other species, even cats (who usually hunt rodents).
-   Kelvin Peña, aka Brother Nature, has made an entire vlogging career out of being able to befriend any animal he comes across.
