It occurs when the hero is in trouble and suddenly gets help from a person whom he has never met before and whom he'll probably never meet again.

It can be anything. The stranger can give the hero money if he really needs to buy a train ticket, or he can give the hero the train ticket and say something like, "Oh, I don't need it anyway. Please take it." The stranger can hide the hero in his basement for a few minutes, or lend him a pair of trousers. It can be anything, any possible example of human kindness from a person the hero meets only once in his life.

The author usually uses this trope to help the hero in a situation where these three conditions occur:

1.  The hero is in trouble and only another person can save him
2.  Secondary characters are in the same trouble or another and can't help the hero
3.  The story takes place in the area where there is high possibility of meeting other people (city, park, road, etc.).

Notably, the Kindness of Strangers is not the trope used to introduce a new character — it's a single appearance only. If one stranger aids the hero multiple times it's Mysterious Protector. The stranger does not give the hero any Unobtainium or mysterious advice or gifts- that's more the territory of the shop assistant in The Little Shop That Wasn't There Yesterday. The Kindness of a Stranger is usually "passive help" rather than aiding the hero in his fight with bad guys or monsters.

Then a middle-aged woman named Eva noticed her crying and asked her what was wrong. Sara was grateful for Eva's concern for her but asked her if she was sure she wanted to hear her out since they were strangers. Eva tells Sara that she was a sad young girl all by herself once.
