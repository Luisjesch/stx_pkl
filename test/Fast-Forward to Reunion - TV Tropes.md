Stories often end with partings, as characters who were drawn together for a temporary adventure return to their old lives, or as relationships break under pressure. A parting between friends, lovers, or family members in the finale can make for heartwrenching drama. However, it isn't over until it's over: many works that separate characters in the last act then skip over weeks, months, or years to show that the separation was temporary and the characters meet again in the future. This can be done through a Distant Finale or Where Are They Now? moment.

If the separated characters were romantically involved or had Unresolved Sexual Tension, this trope can be used to create either a Last-Minute Hookup or a Maybe Ever After ending. However, this trope is not limited to romantic pairings.

This trope is only for when the parting occurs near the end of the work. If the character left a series or work much earlier, you're probably looking at Back for the Finale. The reunion here is always brief, as well: the missing character shows up only in the final scene of the work. For other tropes involving returned characters that typically don't take place after a Time Skip, see The Bus Came Back, Commuting on a Bus, and Back for the Dead.

**This is an ending trope. Beware of spoilers!**
