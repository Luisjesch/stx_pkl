And there's _no one_ more unusual than him.

_"On the other hoof, why did I have her for a best friend, anyway? I was a normal Gothamite, a fine, upstanding citizen. So were my parents. So was Bruce, after a fashion. But my best friend? She was a psychologist-turned-harlequin, had been disowned by her parents, almost died in an asylum, and she used to have pet hyenas."_

In fiction, the type of pet a character owns is often used to signify their personality. Dogs are the default, cats are often used for introverts, and fish are usually only for young characters as their first pet (especially if they need to learn about death). So what of the other pets out there?

As a form of Animal Stereotype, less mainstream pets like rodents, reptiles, or ferrets tend to be owned by characters who are oddball, awkward, or loners. Reptiles and rats (though rarely mice) are often the go-to pet for villainous and malicious characters, while others tend to signify the owner is atypical. Exotic pets are almost never owned by an 'average' character. Large predators (like a Panthera Awesome) as pets often imply that the person is rich and/or powerful, if a bit eccentric.

Compare Heroes Love Dogs (for characterizing heroes/good guys), Crazy Cat Lady (an eccentric woman who hoards cats as her pets), Right-Hand Cat (the odd fondness of villainous characters for cats), Right-Hand Attack Dog (the dogs' strong association with villains as active fighting partners), and Familiar (the association of cats or other odd animals as magical companions for witches).

    Anime & Manga 

-   Anthy of _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ is an eccentric introvert who has a pet monkey (supposedly) named Chu Chu. One joke has Nanami attempting to make Anthy look bad by in front of Utena and Miki by pretending Anthy had a snail, snake, and octopus for pets. In turned out Anthy had a _bunch_ of snails, a mongoose that eats the snake, and though the "octopus" in her closet was just a balloon, she seemingly adopts the one Nanami brought.
-   In _Urusei Yatsura_, Shutaro Mendo, the heir to the multi-millionaire Mendo conglomerate, keeps a large school of octopi as his pets and he dotes on them. Due to their Funnel-Mouthed Cephalopod appearance, they strongly resemble the crest of the Mendo family, itself inspired by the Hyottoko mask, and so Mendo considers them to be symbols of good luck and prosperity. The pride of his collection is a rare South Pole Octopus, which looks indistinguishable from all the others, save for growing into a giant Sea Monster if taken out of its specially frigid enclosure.

    Comic Books 

-   _Hellblazer_: Mako's first appearance shows him holding a baboon and a hyena on chains. He doesn't use them at any point, but are a very handy "Do No Mess With" shorthand.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_ comics, Princess Luna gets a pet opossum named Tiberius to go with her somewhat unusual, introverted and gothic persona.
-   _Sabretooth_ has a case of this in _Weapon X (2017)_. Creed is a sadistic, serial killing, beast of a man with a mutation that gives him tendencies of a big feral cat. What pet does he end up with? **A Siberian Tiger!** It's still a cub, but Creed takes a liking to it instantly. He gently picks it up & cradles it, getting amused when it chomps on his finger.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Nero_. In _Het Wonderwolkje_ The crazy pirate Abraham Tuizentfloot owns a pet pelican who flies him around.
-   Dethany, the Perky Goth in _On the Fastrack_, has a raven called Lenore.
-   In _FoxTrot_, uber-nerd Jason has a pet iguana named Quincy that he loves to use to torment his sister Paige. (One strip—where Paige wants a cat—mentions that Peter and Jason have allergies, which might explain Jason's choice. But, honestly, it seems like the kind of pet he would have gone for anyway.)

His pet is Morph, a sentient blob of pinkish goo that's immune to gravity and can mimic anything it encounters.

However, once Silver shows his vicious and ruthless pirate side, Morph recoils from him and flees to Jim Hawkins.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   As in the animated series, the pet hyena owned by Harley Quinn gets some decent screen time in _Birds of Prey (2020)_. In the movie, there's only one, named Bruce (after "that hunky Wayne guy"). Harley herself is ... also quite special.
-   In _Bulletproof Monk_, Jade's room is full of "weird insects and deadly reptiles". It matches her counterculture personality, but also highlights the clash between that and her home life - a rich girl from a mansion big enough to be considered a palace.
-   In _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_, when Ace Ventura's landlord notices unusual noises and questions Ace on them, Ace claims he knows nothing. As soon as the landlord leaves, an entire zoo comes out of hiding.

    Literature 

-   In David Eddings's _Belgariad_ and _Malloreon_ series, Chief Eunuch Sadi keeps a small, very venomous snake named Zith as a pet. As he is also a Master Poisoner this is justified.
-   _Coraline_:
    -   Mr. Bobo is a retired circus performer who keeps a bunch of mice he says he's training to do circus acts. He's presented as an oddball older man.
    -   Mr. Bobo's "Other" version has a group of villainous rats who act as spies for the Other Mother.

-   In the second and third _Earth's Children_ books, Ayla adopts a cave lion and a wolf as pets. She also has the more mundane horses, though even having those as pets is considered highly unusual in the setting, as domesticating animals is a new concept many people have never even considered trying or thought possible. Some people say they can believe she can tame horses and maybe even a wolf but draw the line at a lion...until they see her petting said lion and climbing on his back. It marks Ayla as someone who is innovative, willing to go outside the norm, has impressive abilities and a great deal of courage given she shows no fear towards even the predatory animals; even though she often wants to fit in she inevitably stands out, seeing as she's accompanied by her pets almost everywhere she goes.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   All of the allowed pets at Hogwarts are animals associated with magic, which fall into this (aside from cats, which are just as popular with Muggles, although at least some students' cats are magical cat-like creatures called kneazles). In particular Neville's toad Trevor marks him out as a Butt-Monkey, (since he was given it as a gift even though they "went out of fashion years ago", according to Hagrid) and Ron's rat, Scabbers (who's a hand-me-down, like everything else of Ron's but turns out to be more than he seems in the third book). Word of God tells us that Trevor eventually escaped into the Black Lake on the Hogwarts grounds right around the time that Neville Took a Level in Badass.
    -   The series also features Rubeus Hagrid, a reckless and immature half-giant Fluffy Tamer. Over the course of the series, he keeps many dangerous magical creatures as pets, including a Giant Spider, a three-headed Hell Hound, a baby dragon and a bizarre and deadly Hybrid Monster called Blast-Ended Skrewt.
-   _Hilda and the Mad Scientist_: Mad scientist and purported monster-maker Dr. Weinerstein has a pet bat, until Hilda chases it out of the house, to his dismay.
-   In _InCryptid_, Alex has a pet church griffin (head and wings of a raven, body of a large cat), and when he was younger he had a coatl. His whole family lives with the sapient (and religious) Aeslin mice, but they're not really "pets". His fiancee Shelby has a garrinna (a griffin with a galah head and thylacine body), showing how alike they are.
-   In Scott Westerfeld's _Leviathan_ trilogy Dr. Nora Barlow, a geneticist who is personally responsible for a lot of the Organic Technology used by Britain in that alternate timeline, has a pet thylacine named Tazza. Many people mistake him for a fabricated beast and have to be told that he's actually completely natural.

Diablo fits her aloof personality but, due to stereotypes attributed to ravens, he also fits her evil persona.

Cleese's character also wants a license for his pet bee, who is called "Eric the Half-a-Bee" ("bisected accidentally").
-   _The Munsters_ are known for many aspects of their kooky lifestyle, including their menagerie of different kinds of pets: Grandpa has a pet bat named Igor who frequently stays down in his basement dungeon, Eddie has a dragon named Spot who lives under the staircase, and the family has a raven that lives in a cuckoo clock (and often sticks his head out to caw, "Nevermore! Nevermore!")
