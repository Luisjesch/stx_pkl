_"left hand washes the right don't let your left hand know what your right hands doing  
one potato two potato three potato four we got a refrigerator with a store-more door hahaha.  
Who cares, this hand or that. good food good meat good God let's eat.  
lady fingers they taste just like lady fingers"_

How do you take the already-disturbing concept of cannibalism and make it even more screwed up? Why, by making the diner what's also being served, of course!

The reason why someone makes a meal of themselves tends to fall under one of the following three categories:

-   an extreme last resort due to imminent starvation
-   a form of Cold-Blooded Torture inflicted upon someone by a particularly sadistic captor
-   simple insanity

A character eating a clone or duplicate of themselves also counts. Also see I Taste Delicious, which tends to be about characters finding themselves irresistibly delectable after becoming or being covered in food (try to keep examples of that on its page). Some of the more disturbing examples of Let's Meet the Meat (like the image on that page) can involve this. If someone else tricks or forces the character into self-consumption to dispatch of them, it serves as a means of Eating the Enemy where the eater is the enemy themselves.

Your body will also actually do this automatically in the later stages of starvation; breaking down redundant organs and muscle to keep the more vital parts running. Autophagy is a similar process of self-digestion and is naturally carried out by cells to recycle defective or worn-out organelles to get their materials back for later re-use.

    And drink herself under the table

    Literature 

-   The _Animorphs_ novels use this as an aspect of the Taxxon race's Horror Hunger. Though sapient, the extreme harshness of their initial environment caused them to evolve a super-powerful hunger response that neither their own will, nor even infestation by a yeerk, can control it. Whenever Visser Three or Ax turns a Taxxon into Half the Man He Used to Be (which is often, considering that Visser Three is a Bad Boss who doesn't take negative news well), the half with a mouth will instinctively try to eat the other.
-   In Jeff Long's _Deeper_, a monster gets his comeuppance when he's paralyzed from the neck down and left to starve to death in a desolate cavern.

Then gets attacked and killed before he can move anything else, meaning he chewed himself up for nothing.
-   _Ender's Game_ has Ender munching on his own hand while sleeping — a slightly uncommon example in that it's not out of starvation but a manifestation of stress and guilt after overworking Petra until she cracks up.

    -   In book 4 (_Beyond the Blue Moon_), during the first chapter, Hawk and Fisher have to defeat a sorcerer commanding a zombie army and augmented by having a small parasitic demon connected to him. To stop it, Hawk cuts the umbilicus that connects the demon to its host. Denied its source of nourishment, the demon attacks Hawk, jabbing at his throat with the severed cord's end in an attempt to make him its new host. Hawk grabs the cord and jams its end into the demon's own belly, and it sucks itself bodily into its own umbilicus and disappears.

-   _John Dies at the End_ has a brief example.

    _But it was those eyes that got me. His expressive cartoon eyes pulsed with a terror about to boil over into madness. Tears streaked his face, sweat beaded his forehead. Those eyes pleaded with me, looked right into me and screamed to be put out of his misery. Those eyes told a story, not just of a man eating himself, but of a man_ being forced _to eat himself. And only I saw it._
    
-   In the novel _The Journeyer_ by Gary Jennings, set in 12th-century China, a section of the book is devoted to the art of torture.

-   _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_ has a rare example of this trope played for badassery. When Xiahou Dun has an arrow shot into his eye, he proceeds to rip it out and eat it.
-   Exaggerated in the short story "The Savage Mouth" by Sakyo Komatsu: the unnamed protagonist not only commits this trope out of sheer spiteful perversity, but he takes advantage of cybernetic medical technology to replace each body part as it's removed so he can keep going, cooks each piece with the care and sophistication of a gourmet chef, and records the entire process. When the police find what's left of him — just a skull with a still-working cybernetic jaw and a dead, partially scooped-out brain — they _immediately_ destroy the recordings and declare him the victim of a psychopathic Mad Scientist rather than horrify the public with the truth.

When House Stark soldiers find her, she's dead with her fingers chewed off (the implication being that Ramsay flayed her hands and she bit her fingers off both to survive and to alleviate the pain).
    -   A mercenary captain known as the Tattered Prince recounts an incident where one of his men tried to desert because of the bad quality of food.

-   One of the many, _many_ white cards in _Cards Against Humanity_ reads "Autocannibalism."
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Trolls are sometimes depicted as doing this if there isn't enough food for them, using their regenerative abilities to heal the damage. Don't think too hard about how this would actually work.
    -   Weaponized by the vaaths, unbelievably sadistic roach-lizards debuting in the _Planescape_ setting. Vaaths like to paralyze prey with their poisonous bites, then stick a feeder tendril into their helpless victim to eat them alive. What's worse is that vaaths are natural telepaths able to "broadcast" both the taste and texture of the meal they're eating, as well as their feelings of satisfaction from it. Other creatures subjected to this will take some Wisdom damage from the horrific experience, unless they commonly feed on the same prey the vaath is, but the vaath's victim takes even _more_ Wisdom damage from this psychic assault, because "no creature, not even another vaath, is immune to the horror of experiencing what its own entrails taste like."
-   In _Pathfinder_, one of the resident Eldritch Abominations known as the Spawn of Rovagug is Great Doom Chemnosit, whose gaze induces overwhelming violent cannibalistic urges in the victims. If they can't perceive any other victims, they immediately turn on themselves. Chemnosit's modus operandi is to erupt in the hearts of cities and infect the entire population with this madness. Then, when the orgy of mutilation has died down, it devours the survivors.
-   _Princess: The Hopeful:_ The Self-Consuming Hunger Caligo lets creatures of the Darkness take resistant damage to generate Willpower to cast other Calignes. This trope is one of the possible explanations for how that works.
-   In _Transhuman Space_, "Clonibalism" (clone-cannibalism) is a whole _thing_, described in _Toxic Memes_ as having started out as a way of bringing back traditions of ritual cannibalism. The sourcebook's frontispiece shows a grinning man pulling a fork out of an identical, and equally grinning, disembodied head.

-   Cannibal Stu / Brewin' Bruno (pictured) from _Garbage Pail Kids_.

    Video Games 

-   From _Amnesia: Justine_, we get Malo, one of Justine's suitors who was forced to eat his own flesh to survive. He then takes a liking to it, and when he sees another human...
-   _Bugsnax_: Floofty Fizzlebean cuts off their own leg as part of an experiment to see if eating Bugsnax will regenerate missing limbs. They eat said leg the following night because it had already been turned into strawberries before it was severed, so it's slightly more palatable than a normal Grumpus leg.
-   Parodied in _Cuphead_, as the titular character's brother Mugman drinks the liquid from his own head through his own straw at the start of every boss battle in co-op. Presumably, it just ends up being put back into his head. Which is kind of odd because according to the game's developers, what's inside Cuphead's and Mugman's cups-for-heads are their spiritual essences, or, in other words, their immortal souls.
-   _Darkest Dungeon_: The weakest mooks in The Darkest Dungeon eat the flesh from their arms. This _heals_ them since they're eldritch-infested cultists. Cutscenes from The Crimson Courtyard also show a Countess-born vampire's first instinct is to _eat themselves_, and not the other vampires around them.
-   _Dead Island_ features the Butcher enemy, rabidly aggressive zombies that have their forearms ending in chewed bone. It's implied that they chewed off their own hands as the virus set in.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_, those infected with Corprus disease take advantage of Corprus's regenerative qualities by eating bits of themselves, as anything they bite off will quickly grow back afterward.
-   _Eastern Mind: The Lost Souls of Tong-Nou_ has minor character Pang Xie, a crab-like creature who constantly eats his own quickly-regenerating limbs, which are apparently his favorite dish.
-   You can do this in _Eat Me_, but you'll just pop right back.
-   In _Fallen London_, if you choose to Seek Mr. Eaten's Name one of the potential cards you can draw involves you burning down a candle shop. Your character will then attempt to eat their own burning flesh because it smells so delicious.
-   One of The Many Deaths of You in the first _Space Quest_ involved being locked in a chamber. The death message says that you tried to resort to autocannibalism, only to find out that you weren't tasty at all.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_, Javik mentions that the punishment for traitors in his time was to rip their limbs off and give them a choice between eating their own flesh or starvation. And then killing them anyway if they do eat.
-   _Monster Hunter 3 (Tri)_: The monster Deviljho will eat any meat lying around on the ground to recover stamina, including its own severed tail.
-   _Moshi Monsters_: Shambles and his species eat their own ears, but it's painless and they grow back so it doesn't matter. Fabio once tried to eat his own teeth, but they tasted bad.
-   In _Plague Inc._, the Necroa virus can evolve the Autophagia symptom which "compels Infectees to bite and devour their own bodies".
-   In _Sonic Shuffle_, one of the Forcejewels in the game is the Carbuncle, which is really a disguised fairy that eats the other Forcejewels in the inventory of the player who possesses it. Once there are no other Forcejewels left, the Carbuncle will resort to eating itself.
-   The final boss of _'Splosion Man_ is a giant monster, made from meat. You trick it into eating its own arms off, leaving it vulnerable to the final killing blow.
-   In _Sunset Overdrive_, Troop Master Bryllcream was trapped in a garbage truck for 16 days without food or water. By the time the player rescues him, he's a quadruple amputee with none of his limbs. While it's never outright stated, the game puts special emphasis on the "trapped with no food" part.
-   In _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_ Geralt feeds a werewolf its own flesh in order to break the curse of lycanthropy.
-   In _Zork_, the command "eat self" returns the message "Autocannibalism is not the answer."

    Webcomics 

-   _Awful Hospital_: The door to the Burgrr Zone tries to convince Fern to eat a sloppy joe made of her own body parts. Since the Zone is entirely focused on meat consumption and has a rather hazy understanding of life and death as they apply to humans, it might actually have been intended as a treat for her.
    
    **BBQ Girll:** I do hope the sweet little thing enjoys her complimentary autoconceptual foodmatters!
    
-   _Freefall_: In strip 607:
    
    **Florence:** _\[thinking\]_ Winston said when my blood supply rebuilt, I'd wake up feeling hungry.  
    What he didn't explain is that feeling hungry is going to mean "Hope you can make it to the kitchen before you start eating your own appendages."
    
-   _Paranatural_: The "racist whale-frog" invades Max's home, creates a clone out of its own reflection, and then eats the clone. Max, PJ, and Lefty are all appropriately horrified.
    
    **Max:** Okay that's a little out of my comfort zone. Gonna call for some backup.  
    **Alt Text:** A pragmatic ghost hunter would be happy with this turn of events, as the number of foes has decreased.
    
-   In _Unsounded_, Duane has struggled with insatiable Horror Hunger ever since becoming The Undead but hit a low point in his early non-breathing days when his body was literally rotting around him. One part of that Madness Montage shows him chewing on one of his own maggot-infested hands in desperation.

    Web Original 

-   This happens at the end of the _DEATH BATTLE!_ between Omni-Man and Homelander in the "one forces it upon another" fashion. At the start of the fight, Nolan vows to feed Homelander his own heart for murdering Debbie, and he very literally makes good on that promise: The deathblow involves Omni-Man ripping Homelander's lower jaw out of its socket. Then, he rips out Homelander's heart, shoves it into the Supe's forced-open mouth, and makes him 'swallow' by crushing Homelander's head.
    
    **Nolan**: "Remember what I promised you...? **Now swallow.**"
    
-   _Homestar Runner_:
    -   Played for Laughs in the _Strong Bad Email_ "island". Strong Bad imagines that in a typical cartoon scenario, if he and Homestar were stuck on a deserted island, Strong Bad might try to eat his own foot at one point.
    -   In the email "interview", Strong Bad claims that being around Homsar for too long makes him start to think "gnawing my own leg off would be a more better way to spend my time."
-   Implied case on _Neopets_. If a Skeith (an omnivorous dragon species of Neopet) were to be painted Biscuit (and given an appearance like it's a sentient cookie), it will appear to have a large bite taken out of its own arm, with a telltale gathering of crumbs around its face, chest and upper belly.
-   _Orion's Arm_ has autovory, eating a brain-dead clone of oneself alive while hooked up to the clone's sensory outputs. In some polities, one can buy clones of celebrities for this purpose as well. Or, for a slightly less disturbing example, the setting mentions the practice of cloning pieces of one's own body to eat being a "fad" for a while.
-   The Christmas Episode of _Retarded Animal Babies_ had Puppy receive a Gag Penis for Christmas as a present from Satan Claus, and as a result, he sucks on it until he explodes.
-   Happens in an episode of _Salad Fingers_. Or not. It's not very clear just what is going on only that Salad Fingers likes his doppelganger's brains.
-   In _SBI Rust_, Fort Kickass are not above eating their own dead bodies.
-   _SCP Foundation_:
-   In _Smirvlak's Stone_, Lorko Maeliss is repeatedly (and rightfully) called out by Karlnok for his various actions getting most of the Yellow Fang tribe killed. After one too many condescending remarks, Lorko snaps and uses dark magic to brainwash Karlnok into eating his own eyeballs and testicles, along with the rest of his body.
-   Played for Laughs in the _Smosh_ short 'Stranded'. When faced with starvation, Anthony and Ian decide that they're going to have to eat their third friend, Jamal. In response, Jamal accuses them of racism and eats himself just to spite them.
-   _StacheBros_: In "Yoshi Eats His Friends", when Yoshi wakes up from his nap for an afternoon snack only to find no food in the house, he accidentally eats Mario and Luigi to satiate his appetite. However, to prevent himself from eating Wario as well, he resorts to eating himself.
-   Used in _Zero Punctuation_ to describe a level of absurd, maddening frustration caused by unfair game design paired with having victory snatched away at the last moment. This puts it more into the third category, representing insanity as brought on by anger. Notable for having Yahtzee's avatar visibly gnawing on his own foot with a fair bit of blood but _not_ having removed it first and the 'crazy' expression as shown in his stick-figure sort of style.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_:
    -   Mentioned in the episode "The Promise": when Gumball and Darwin went on a camping trip and forgot to bring Banana Joe home with them, he apparently had to eat a piece of himself to survive.
    -   At the beginning of "The Girlfriend", when Jamie is prowling the cafeteria for food from the other kids, Anton (a piece of sentient toast who regularly dies and just comes back each time through his toaster) hastily makes himself into a sandwich.

-   A, well, _weird_ variant in an opening skit for _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_:
    
    **Steve:** (_on phone_) Uh, yeah, uh, six inch on wheat, no mayo... uh, hang on. (_aside_) Uh, Dr. Weird?  
    **Dr. Weird:** (_with his hand behind his back_) My ass has finally decided to eat MY HAND! (_sharp convulsion_) IT HUNGERS... FOR MORE!  
    (_Dr. Weird's entire body gets sucked into itself until there's nothing left but a small ball of flesh with a piece of Dr. Weird's muumuu sticking out_)  
    **Steve:** (_back on the phone_) ...Uh, yeah, just the one hoagie.
    
-   An early episode of _Beast Wars_ had Dinobot dispose of a fully biological clone of himself by eating it.
    
    **Dinobot:** I'm afraid he's gone for good. A shame, really. He was such a handsome creature...and quite tasty. (Flicks a small leftover piece from his teeth to Optimus Primal's face.)
    
    **Optimus Primal:** (clearly unamused) You're disgusting.

-   In the last episode of _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2002)_, Zodak mystically hypnotizes four of King Hiss' heads into eating the fifth, and main, one (had the show gone on for another season he would have regenerated it).
-   Played for laughs in _Histeria!_. In a skit spoofing Ken Burns' Civil War documentary, a soldier, desperate to escape the sorrowful violin music constantly playing out of nowhere, writes that he has eaten his own head.
-   Done apparently offscreen in _Invader Zim_. In one episode we see Skoodge being shot into a planet via cannon. He later shows up alive and well, much to the confusion of The Tallest. According to the writers, he survived by eating his own skin.
-   In the Mickey Mouse cartoon "Mickey's Garden", a giant caterpillar tries to eat Mickey, who jumps on its tail. In trying to eat him, it bites off its own tail until it's just a head.

        **Homer:** Marge, I admit it, this is a rough patch. But I know when to stop.  
        **Marge:** And when would that be? When you're just a _mouth?!_  
        **Homer:** You see how she is, doc? Always negative. She makes me feel like nothing.  
        **Marge:** You **are** almost nothing!
        
    -   In an _Itchy & Scratchy Show_ short, Itchy (disguised as a restaurant employee) serves Scratchy his own belly. The unknowing Scratchy's attempt at eating it only results in the bits of it he swallows popping back out of a hole cut in it.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   Played for Laughs in "Graveyard Shift" when Squidward tells SpongeBob a Ghost Story, prompting SpongeBob to bite his nails. The next cut is to him actually eating his arms (they grow back ridiculously fast), then going through them like a paper shredder, then eating down a bucket of his own arms like popcorn.

    Real Life 

-   One user on Reddit had his foot and part of his lower leg amputated following a motorcycle accident, and somehow managed to get the hospital to agree to him taking the resultant cut of meat home with him; he then prepared meat strips out of his _own_ foot to serve in tacos and even invited some friends to share in the tasting!
-   King Richard II of England was deposed by Henry Bolingbroke (afterwards King Henry IV) in the fall of 1399. Not long after that, he was taken to Pontefract Castle as a prisoner and put in chains. He died in February 1400, apparently deliberately starved to death. There are tales that hunger drove Richard to rip flesh from his hands and forearms with his teeth and eat it.
-   Bernd Jürgen Brandes, who infamously consented to being killed and eaten by a man he met online, tried to eat some of his own penis before dying.
-   Lizards whose tails drop off when grabbed as an anti-predator defense mechanism will sometimes eat the dropped-off bit of tail if the predator doesn't do so, reclaiming its protein for their bodies.
    -   Many lizards also do the same with their own shed skins, for the same reason.
-   Some mammals will eat their offspring's placenta after a birth. See Placentophagy.
    -   Also technically a case of Eats Babies, as the placenta is a structure comprised of both fetal (mostly vessels) and maternal (mostly blood) tissues.
-   Ant queens consume their own wings once their mating flight is done and they are ready to start a hive.

In extreme cases, this can lead to infections, nerve damage, amputations, and death.
-   One horrific case of child abuse in Gloucester, Virginia, revealed a 6-year-old girl starving in a filthy cage made from a crib and a piece of plywood stuck on top. She was so hungry (she'd only ever be fed Pop Tarts or sandwiches twice a day at the very most) _she was eating flakes of her own dead skin._ Fortunately, she's far better off now and eating real food. Her parents, Brian and Shannon Gore, have been sentenced to 30 years in prison.
-   A female octopus ceases to hunt while guarding and tending her eggs, typically dying of starvation around the time they hatch. If she's already underweight when the eggs are laid, she may consume one or more of her own arms to sustain herself long enough that the eggs aren't left undefended.
-   One Danish artist cooked food with his own liposuctioned fat.
    -   Similarly a Norwegian artist ate meat off his deformed hip bone after having it replaced. It should be noted that doing so wasn't his original plan, when he'd talked his doctors into letting him keep it his intention was to clean it up and display it, but he later realised that he had a rare opportunity and seized it.
-   As an emergency procedure for if you starve yourself for a few days, your body will convert its own protein content into glucose in an attempt to stay alive. In essence, your body eats up your muscle tissue for energy.
    -   The process of apoptosis involves the dead cells of the body that aren't discarded or repurposed in some way being sent to the liver, where kupffer cells render them down for their nutritional value, as well as sending the byproducts of this process to the gall bladder.
    -   Technically we all do this, as we swallow and digest millions of shed cells that flake away from the lining of the oral cavity every day.
    -   A drug called Glucagon is used to induce this in unresponsive hypoglycemic diabetics and converts the glycogen stored in the liver and other parts of the body to glucose that the body can use. People who have had it used report feeling exhausted for days after.
-   There was a story about a Chinese general named Xiahou Dun. During battle, he took an arrow to the eye. When he went to remove the arrow, his entire eye came off on the tip.
