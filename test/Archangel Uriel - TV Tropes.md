One of the lesser known Archangels, Uriel, Uri'el (Hebrew) is primarily an angel in rabbinical angelology mentioned in Enoch 1 and Ezra IV. He is one of seven who stand at the throne of God, one of four who serve humanity and is also one of the archangels who presides over the four quarters of the earth along with Michael, Gabriel and Raphael. Uriel is often referred to as prince of the angels and of Tartarus.

He's one of the angels in non-canon lore and is alternately described as either Kerubim or Seraphim and is often referred to as the Angel of the Presence. Legend says that he stands at the gate of the Lost Eden with a fiery sword and he was attributed as being the angel who warned Noah of the impending flood; he is also sometimes claimed to be the angel who took the lives of the firstborn of Egypt during the Plagues. He is sometimes shown as the angel of either death or the sun in fiction, and is thus a total badass. In liturgy, he is also associated with wisdom, knowledge, the arts, and man-made beauty; artwork consequently often shows him holding a book, a scroll, or a Greek Ionic column; the association with the sun and stars is often folded into this theme as representing light and natural beauty.

Although Uriel was accepted as an archangel by the Catholic Church for centuries he was finally removed in AD 745, along with a host of other angels, because the Church was growing concerned about a growing fixation and importance placed by the public on angels. However, he is still recognized as an archangel by the Anglican and Eastern Orthodox churches.

His name means "God is my Light". Given the similarities with "Lucifer" (which means "light bringer" in Latin), and the fact that several early theology texts actually stated Uriel was "condemned to Hell", some works equate the two, although the book of Enoch lists him among the angels who requested permission from God to intervene on humanity's behalf against the fallen angels (Michael gets to do it) suggesting he was a positive force for awhile even if he did go astray.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Angel Sanctuary_: Uriel is heroic and somewhat emo. He is a fairly important character.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_: Uriel is the patron of Vento of the Front and the source of her powers.
-   _Devils and Realist_: Uriel is one of the main characters and spends most of the time disguised as Kevin, the main character's butler and caretaker, while actually being on a mission to secure him for Heaven. In the series, Uriel is depicted as Angel of Repentance and Cruelty, which perhaps inspired by his ambiguous position mentioned above. Despite being an angel, it's universally known by both demon and human that he is a sadist.
-   _Seven Heavenly Virtues_: Uriel is an Archangel, and one of the Seven Heavenly Virtues. She represents Patience, and serves as an intelligence operative for Heaven. In spite of her Virtue, she is said to have a serious personality and a short temper.

    Comic Books 

-   _Marvel Universe_: Uri-El is a hairless, yellow-skinned humanoid with solid gray eyes, who wears long, bronze robes and is surrounded by an orange aura underneath them. He wields a red sword that seems to be made of some sort of energy and is known as the angel of redemption.
-   _Lucifer_: Uriel is a minor character, taking over the role of the representative of the Host after Amenadiel. Like all the other angels not named "Michael" or "Lucifer" he's little more than a mook in terms of power and story importance. He's also, for some reason, the only black angel where all the others are caucasian.

    Fan Works 

-   _Child of the Storm_: Uriel, specifically _The Dresden Files_ version, is alluded to as a major offscreen figure, both in terms of raw power and and manipulative tendencies.
-   _Codex Equus_: The alicorn Midnight Majesty, one of the Thirteen Empyreans, is the setting's counterpart of the Archangel Uriel in his role as the angel with the flaming sword. She is the gatekeeper of the Sanctuary Realms populated by the ancient alicorns, and her role is to defend their homes from outsiders and prevent banished alicorns from coming back.
-   _Earth-27_: Uriel is one of the archangels who rule Heaven, and the eldest of their number. She created the Garden of Eden, taught agriculture to Adam and Eve, and protected the Garden with her flaming sword. In the modern day, when she is not on assignment fulfilling the duties of Heaven, she still spends most her time within Eden.
-   _Manchester Lost_: Uriel appears along with the other archangels. He's a happy Cloudcuckoolander most of the time, but takes smiting evil very seriously.

    Literature 

-   _Deryni_: Uriel appears in his capacity as one of the archangels who presides over the four quarters of the earth along with Michael, Gabriel and Raphael; Uriel is associated with Earth, the south and with the colour green. When Cinhil Haldane dies in a ritual circle after setting his sons' Haldane potential, Uriel stays behind after the other angels leave and guides Cinhil's soul from the circle to join those of his deceased wife and son.
-   _The Dresden Files_: Uriel is an important recurring character from _Small Favor_ onwards as the primary immortal representative of the "White God". He acts as an ally, mentor and sort-of-almost-employer to Dresden himself, as well as the Knights of the Cross. He is the guardian of free will and Heaven's "Wetworks" guy, meaning their assassin, spook, spymaster and doer of the gritty jobs, such as the historical slaying of the Firstborn of Egypt. Mab likes his style, which says a lot for someone who is unambiguously a Good Guy. Dresden once calls him "Uri", which he was not a fan of<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , although he has no complaints about "Mr. Sunshine". He also casually mentions being able to make and unmake galaxies, putting him at (or very near) the top of the list of strongest beings encountered the series, although in general beings with more power typically are quite restricted in their ability to directly apply it. Plus, in _Skin Game_, he's no slouch when temporarily rendered human by his own actions.
    -   He is a master of the Xanatos Gambit, typically hitting several targets with a single strike, with allies and enemies alike usually not being aware of this until it happens (explaining why Mab likes his style). He demonstrates the ability to (if somewhat imperfectly), predict the future, explaining to Harry how the little good things he did on one case ripple into far greater things; like making a mother realize her husband is abusing their kid and stopping a construction worker who is drunk on duty from working - he would have died shortly after and in a few months, his child would need bone marrow, for which he would have been the only viable donor. And then, finally, he elaborates on how Harry saved Michael during that mission from the man's own darker impulses.
        
        "The real war happened when you weren't looking."
        
    -   It should also be noted that Uriel is also a fan of _Star Wars_, mentioning that he enjoys the music and the simplicity of the Black-and-White Morality, which makes him feel "young."
-   _Dora Wilk Series_: Uriel is an archangel and as such, member of the Council (heavenly government). He's their chief investigator thanks to his mind-reading powers.
-   _Paradise Lost_: Uriel guards the Sun and gate to Earth and is unwittingly tricked by Satan into letting him enter Earth.
-   _Ro.Te.O_: Uriel has made a few appearances, not as a Grim Reaper (which is Azrael's job) but rather as the angel of knowledge. He's the only character to not have spoken in a story full of characters capable of speech, and is not seen without his Flaming Sword or Michael.
-   _The Salvation War_: Uriel appears as the Angel of Death, and kills thousands of people in the second book, before being finally killed by the machinations of Michael who puts him at the lack of mercy of a large amount of fighter jets and several battleships, as well as a YAL-1 laser. This version is most definitely Made of Iron, surviving numerous missiles, being microwaved by an exceptionally powerful radar and generally being shot.
-   _Sandman Slim_: Uriel turns up under another name. And he turns out to be Stark's father.
-   _Sovereign_: Uriel, the Warden, is in charge of Heaven's "prison" on the rare occasion that someone is placed there (which has happened before). He guarded Eden along with Gabriel before humans lost access to it, and replaced the former archangel Sataniel after the latter fell. He's a bit of a Pyromaniac and presides over summer.
-   _Unsong_: Uriel is constantly trying to repair the various bugs and errors that crop up in the code of reality itself, and seems to be a little _off_, mentally speaking for an angel.
-   _Weaveworld_: The nigh-omnipotent entity Uriel claims to be an angel. It's probably wrong.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Dominion_: Uriel is a) a woman and b) playing Michael and Gabriel against each other, with the intention to destroy both in order to end all the fighting.
-   _Good Omens (2019)_: A Gender Flipped Uriel is one of Archangel Gabriel's underlings. They're portrayed as The Stoic of the archangels, and their role is mostly to intimidate Aziraphale into following orders and sticking to the plan to start the Apocalypse. They're also something a Decomposite Character, since Aziraphale himself was the angel with the flaming sword.
-   _Lucifer_: Uriel is referenced by the titular character. One of his jobs is to give the big "welcome to Heaven" speech to new arrivals, which Lucifer thinks is worse than Hell. He appears in Season 2, having come to Earth to convince Lucifer to return their mother to Hell at the threat of Detective Chloe's life. He also brought with him Azrael's Blade ready to kill his mother if she won't come back, damning her to neither Heaven to Hell, but non-existence. Lucifer eventually ran him through with the blade, killing him for good. He later shows up in Lucifer's personal Ironic Hell, with Luci repeatedly stabbing him with the blade.
-   _Supernatural_: Uriel appears as a Scary Black Man antagonist. Here he is portrayed as not being an archangel, as only Michael, Lucifer, Raphael, and Gabriel hold this rank. He's also incredibly racist towards humans, calling them "mud monkeys".

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Anima: Beyond Fantasy_: Uriel is one of the seven beryls (god-like spirits of light). He's the only male of them and has associated freedom, independence, and free will.
-   _Engel_: Uriel is one of the eight Archangels, and his angels are referred to as "Waywatchers". They're mostly armed with the _Urielsbogen_ (Uriel Bows) and are supposed to spy for the _Angelitische Kirche_ (Angelic Church) and their own _Schar_ (band) of angels.
-   _In Nomine_: Uriel was the Archangel of Purity until he got a little too zealous in trying to stamp out non-Abrahamic mythical creatures. He was "called upstairs" for an audience with God and hasn't been heard from since.

    Video Games 

-   _Darksiders_: Uriel appears and, notably, is portrayed as a woman. She is the current leader of the angelic armies stuck on Earth following the death of their previous general.
-   _Dragalia Lost_ has Uriel in both Our Angels Are Different and Our Dragons Are Different, counting as both a dragon and angel. He's one of the Five Archangels who, every generation, takes a new Sigil pact with an Apostle where if one dies they both die, and in his case, his Sigil partner is Faris, who he's raised to be an utter perfectionist. He and his fellow Archangels also have to face off against the Sinister Dominion, demons who they kept trapped inside their own evil twins, which is now coming undone. In Uriel's case, his Dominion opposite is Iblis.
-   _El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron_: Uriel appears as one of the four archangels, aiding Enoch via Limit Break.
-   _Granblue Fantasy_ has Uriel as an extremely muscular earth primarch serving under the supreme primarch Lucifer, the games Big God and the Benevolent Boss of the angels. Along with being associated with earth, he is a Cosmic Keystone for the element, regulating the element so that the floating islands will remain in place in the skies. He is the youngest of the tetra-element primarchs (Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael) and as such is babied by them. Despite this, he is smarter than he is usually pegged to be and was able to quickly deduce that the Big Bad was a threat, only being taken by surprise while he was distracted and having his wings snatched as a result of his mistake. He also devised a plan to distract the villain in "What Makes the Sky Blue" using the earth element primal Yggdrasil and the remnants of his power without his wings so that they could retrieve Lyria, who was being held hostage by him. In terms of personality, he is hot-blooded and quite abrasive, but he's kind at heart and loyal to the supreme primarch. He also loves to fight, but for fun rather than valor like Michael.
-   _Puzzle & Dragons_ has Uriel as part of the Archangel group, with the Fire Attribute.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_: Uriel appears in a lot of games, sometimes as a boss. He's usually associated with the fire element and is commonly the lowest-levelled of the archangels (below Raphael, Gabriel, Michael, and the Metatron).
-   _Spellstone_: Yuriel the Owl Mystic is one of the playable characters. While not depicted as an angel, Yuriel is still a high-ranking practitioner of the Aether faction of magic, and is often shown rubbing shoulders with several of the game's other angels, such as Queen Leyla of Skyhaven and his boss, Samael, whom he turns out to be helping in a genocidal scheme to weaponize the Heart of Blue Fire against the Chaos.
-   _Trillion: God of Destruction_: This version of Uriel proves to be a rash young man, and given the sour relations between Heaven and the Underworld, his attitude doesn't win him any favors with the other Fallen Ones, save for the generally sweet Elma whom tended to his wounds. His arrival in the Underworld heralds more news of Trillion's threat: prior to arriving at the Gates of Hell, Trillion casually walked into Heaven, curb-stomped every angel, and then _tore God into pieces_ before devouring Heaven's Core, and then going on to erase the Human World. Uriel is the Sole Survivor of Trillion's Onslaught, which is part of why he stays to help train the other Overlords.

    Webcomics 

-   _Beyond the End_: Uriel isn't an archangel, but only due to his lack of interest in being one.

He's known for being a powerful wildcard that seems like he can get away with murder.
-   _Holy Bibble_: Uriel is a fire-wielding sociopath.
-   _Lessa_: Although playing a more minor role compared to some of his other brethren, Uriel is one of Ra's seven Apostles and acts as the group's Seer.
