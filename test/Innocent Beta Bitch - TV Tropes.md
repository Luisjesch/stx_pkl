The insufferable Alpha and the ever suffering Beta.

The Innocent Beta Bitch is a friend of the Alpha Bitch who isn't as mean as the alpha.

They are hinted as being much nicer than they seem, which becomes more apparent whenever they aren't with the alpha. Any meanness they do show is portrayed as them following the alpha's lead and not truly meaning it.

Alternatively, they are portrayed as being much dumber or not being able to think for themselves, so they just follow the Alpha Bitch's lead.

There's a good chance they will break the friendship after too much cruelty from the alpha. Also, expect them to end up being friends with the alpha bitch's enemies.

For the alpha version, see Lovable Alpha Bitch. See Beta Bitch for the mean version. Compare Peer-Pressured Bully, which occasionally overlaps. Compare also Minion with an F in Evil and Vile Villain, Laughable Lackey.

    Fan Works 

-   Bunzo Bunny from Poppy Playtime: Break Time is the meek and mousy Beta Bastard to Mommy Long Legs, Playtime Co.'s Alpha Bitch.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Barbie: Princess Charm School_: Portia is Delancy's sidekick. Delancy bullies Blair throughout the first half of the movie, but Portia is far too scatterbrained to be malicious.
-   Anastasia in the two _Cinderella_ sequels. While the original has her mistreating Cinderella alongside her mother and sister, the sequels has her getting the blunt of their cruelty now that Cinderella is gone. Not only that but compare to Drizella, Anastasia genuinely wants to find someone to love her. Also, after making her Heel–Face Turn, she becomes much nicer towards Cinderella.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Boy Eats Girl_:
    -   Glenda seems more dim and nervous than her Girl Posse friends. She stands by while Cheryl makes mean and insulting comments, but doesn't pitch in and (unlike Charlotte) never smiles at things like Cheryl mocking Jessica's failure to get Nathan. She does ask a Dirty Old Man to buy her and Cheryl drinks at a bar, but looks a bit grossed out when he actually agrees to. She also has an Actually Pretty Funny reaction to Diggs turning the tables on his bully and her boyfriend Shane, while Cheryl and Charlotte act indifferent to this.
    -   Charlotte seems to find amusement in some of Cheryl's crueler moments, but she never instigates bullying anyone and shows signs of being desperately starved for genuine affection and kindness.

-   _The House Bunny_: Courtney, Ashley's seemingly loyal Beta Bitch sidekick has had enough with Phi Iota Mu (and Ashley, who had treated her horribly) that she describes it as "hell", and decides to pledge Zeta, making her the last pledge needed in order to save their house.
-   Bobby from _The Karate Kid_ is a bastard version. While he did terrorize Daniel with the other Cobra Kai students, he did have his limits. He tried to dissuade Johnny from continuing his beating on Daniel at the Halloween party. He was also against attacking Daniel's leg and desperately apologizes immediately after doing it. By _Cobra Kai_, he's become a church pastor.
-   _Mean Girls_: The two sidekicks of Alpha Bitch Regina are not as mean as her. Gretchen is an insecure Extreme Doormat and Karen is a sweet-natured ditz, and both are "mean girls" mainly because they follow Regina's orders.
-   _Princess Protection Program_: Mean girl Chelsea is rarely seen without her sidekick Brooke, but is often just as cruel to her as she is to her other victims. Towards the climax of the film, she pushes Brooke too far during a conversation in the bathroom, and Brooke finally snaps and calls her out on her bullying ways, saying that she doesn't deserve to become Homecoming Queen because she has none of the virtues of a true queen.
-   _Troop Beverly Hills_ has Annie who is the push around assistant to Wilderness Girls district leader Velda. She makes a face turn after going undercover in Phyllis' Beverly Hills group who actually treated her with respect.

    Literature 

-   _Carrie_: Sue is a friend of Chris, the cruel leader of the popular girls, but later feels guilty for joining Chris and her friends in the bullying of Carrie. To make up for it, she even asks her boyfriend Tommy to take Carrie to the Prom in her place. Even Chris's gal pal Tina Blake is this compared to how the film adaptations give her Adaptational Villainy - she lets Chris see the nominations for Prom King and Queen not knowing about the prank she's going to pull. And from her account of the blood pouring incident, she maintains that she only laughed out of shock and not maliciousness.

-   _Nighttime Is My Time_: Jean was this to Alison in school. They were friends but Jean never joined in Alison's mean girl antics and was even nice to some of the students Alison bullied. She didn't do much to stop Alison from what we can tell, though this is indicated to be because Jean herself was extremely introverted and meek in high school, as opposed to approval of Alison's bullying. The Owl even briefly considers sparing Jean because she wasn't unkind and stuck-up like the other girls, but then convinces himself that she was just as horrible as them deep down.
-   In _Two Can Keep A Secret_, Malcolm considers Brooke the most bearable of his stepsister Katrin's friends. That's not a high bar, but Brooke is a genuinely nice person. She gets murdered, and Malcolm is accused of the crime.

Ironically when Melina turned face to feud with Beth Phoenix, Jillian turned her back on her.
