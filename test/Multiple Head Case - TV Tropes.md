Don't expect them to agree on anything!

_Two heads? Who the heck needs 'em?  
Two heads? How can you feed 'em?  
Two heads! Day after day...  
...It's drivin' me crazy in every way!_

Whenever a creature has two (or more) heads and the ability to talk (or at least displays sapience to some degree), each head will have its own distinct personality. In some cases, these heads may cooperate closely, or at least as well as any close pair of allies can be expected to. In more comedic works, the heads will often argue with each other, especially when some choice needs to be made. In more dramatic situations, the two heads will despise one another and resent their physical joining. It's common for each head's personality to be centered around a distinct emotional or personality trait — for instance, a sad head, an angry head, a conniving head, a cheerful head, and so on — almost as if a single being's traits had been split up among the various heads. In some cases, such a being may effectively become a one-man personality ensemble trope.

The specifics of how the body is controlled vary from case to case. Sometimes, the two personalities share seamless control. Other times, it may be possible for one head to take full control of the body, which may lead to bickering for dominance as each self tries to seize control from the other. In yet other cases, each head can only control the limbs on its own side.

In most cases, the two heads are joined naturally, and have been all their lives. However, it's also fairly common for this trope to be the result of two or more distinct beings being fused together while retaining their individual memories and personalities. This is also commonly seen among Mutants.

In some works, each had may possess a distinct power or attribute, such as each having a distinct keen sense. Similarly, when this applies to a creature with a Breath Weapon, it's common for each head to have its own specific weapon.

Characters of this type tend to be portrayed in live-action works with multiple actors sharing a costume. Similarly, some characters that initially appear to be this trope in-universe turn out to be multiple characters in one outfit or otherwise attached together somehow, creating a subversion.

Sub-Trope of Conjoined Twins. Sometimes overlaps with Belly Mouth or A Head at Each End. Also see the Janus type of Two-Faced. If the being in question is god-like, it also falls under Many-Faced Divinity. Almost always a feature in Our Hydras Are Different.

    Advertising 

-   In a commercial for the SNES _Tetris_ _&_ _Dr. Mario_, what appears to be two guys arguing over the two games turns out to actually be one guy with two heads. There's also a two-headed _dog_.

    Anime & Manga 

-   One _Bleach_ filler anime episode has a two-headed dog-like Hollow who was born from the spirits of two dead dogs. After nearly killing the little girl who owned one of the dogs in its life, one of the head attacks the other.
-   _Digimon_:

-   In _Digimon Adventure 02_, the Digimon Kaiser gives Daisuke a Sadistic Choice: he can save only one of his four friends (and their Digimon) and not all of them because Deltamon has three heads and is hungry.
-   Ebonwumon of _Digimon Tamers_ has two heads, with each being voiced with a different accent in the dub. Both heads are generally in agreement with each other, though.
-   _Digimon Ghost Game_:
    -   Reppamon's tail has a mind of its own and constantly tries to slice everything in sight to test its strength. The main body constantly tries to stop the tail from hurting anyone, usually resulting in them flying around chaotically as they struggle against each other. The tail starts to mellow out after Angoramon suggests that it do more mundane tasks to test its precision instead, leading to them working and fighting more cohesively.
    -   Asuramon has three heads, each of which experiences a different narrow range of emotions and has a different voice. The three of them cooperate to steal people's faces and emotions to experience for themselves. This is in contrast to previous appearances where Asuramon was depicted as a single individual whose heads acted as a Living Mood Ring.

-   Happens many times in _Franken Fran_. In one particular variant, she stitched the salvageable remains of two clones that had just killed each other into one. We are then treated to a wide-headed, three-eyed, three-armed, three-legged human arguing with herself and beating herself up.
-   King Ghidorah's three heads in _Godzilland_ sometimes bicker, such as in the episode where they fight over a cake at Godzilla's birthday party.
-   Discussed in _Heaven's Design Team_ in regards to why there aren't any animals alive today that normally have multiple heads.
-   _Inuyasha_ has the brothers Kinka and Ginka. Members of their species are born with two heads, with the stronger head killing and devouring the other early on to become a unique monster. Unfortunately, Kinka and Ginka have grown to be of equal strength, and spend all of their waking hours fighting each other violently, but to a stalemate. Note that they look more like two Snake People with their tails hopelessly imbricated rather than conjoined twins.
-   Cerve, the cerberus from _Monster Girl Doctor_, has two dog heads growing out of her shoulders.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   The giant Judge Baskerville of Enies Lobby resembles the knight from _Holy Grail_ and has one head that believes in punishment, one head that believes in mercy, and the center head which declares itself the most reasonable, but is really Ax-Crazy. Subverted when it's revealed to be three different people with very odd physiques sharing a shirt.
    -   Consuming an Artifical Zoan-type Devil-fruit called SMILE, can result in this for real, such as Holdem, who has a lion's head and front-legs growing out of his stomach, called Kamijiro. They often fight, which usually ends with Kamijiro performing a Groin Attack on Holdem...which of course also hurts it, since they share the same body.
-   Kanan/Shuko/Junrei (collectively known as Honlon) from _Pet Shop of Horrors_. She's (they're?) a three-headed dragon with a different personality for each head. Justified in the manga's explanation of how dragons are born: the dragon's form and its personality are influenced by the person who cares for its egg, and thanks to unexpected circumstances, Honlon's egg was cared for by three very different people before it hatched. However, this manifests as Literal Split Personality in their one-headed (shared) human form.
-   Rouge in _Ranma ½_, having fallen in the Spring of Drowned Asura, has three faces (all on different sides of the same head) when she turns into her Goddess form. They bicker endlessly with one another, even yelling at each other to wake up if one of them is knocked out.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: The series' flagship mecha, Gurren Lagann, is formed by combining two face-like mecha (Gurren and Lagann). The resulting combination has two faces (one on its head and one on its torso), which are piloted separately and "speak" and emote with each of their corresponding pilots. However, there are a few instances where Simon subverts this by piloting Gurren Lagann by himself.
-   The Three Sisters in the first _Vampire Hunter D_ novel and movie has the heads of three beautiful women and the body of some kind of silver dragony thing. The heads argue over which one of them gets to eat D.
-   _The☆Ultraman_ has a bunch:
    -   Cho, Jin and San are a trio of Sea Monsters who, because of pollution, ends up being mutated into a single three-headed entity, all three of their heads capable of interacting independently.
    -   A later monster called a Janyur was easily destroyed, until two more creatures of the same race are assimilated with the first, turning into a three-headed serpentine monster called Janyur III.
    -   There's a pair of alien invaders, the Jadans, who can perform a Fusion Dance that transforms them into a two-headed alien kaiju dragon to rampage across cities.

    Comic Books 

-   _All-Star Comics_: Gallifron is a giant two headed child eating ogre who acts as Loreli's most dangerous individual enforcer.
-   One-shot comic The Carneys from _Archie Comics_, where a circus family have a siamese sisters named Linda-Louise, who are a two-headed girl.
-   _Black Dynamite_: Played with in Issue #3. The Man cheats death by having his head transplanted onto the body of a black convict, and it seems like this trope will be in play—right up until The Man orders the other head severed.
-   Divangelic in _Empowered_ certainly looks like the two halves would have contrasting personalities, since one of them dresses as a sexy demoness and the other as an angel; she was always just a background character, though, so we never get to see them talk.
-   _Giantkiller_: Jotun is a bipedal wolf Daikaiju with three heads.
-   _Green Lantern_:
    -   One member of the Sinestro Corps is a two-headed alien. Both heads are psychotic killers but one likes killing people by ripping their bodies apart, while the other is disgusted by such crude methods and prefers more subtle methods of killing. They fight over who should control the Sinestro Corps power ring after they get it. And later, when the Green Lanterns assigned to tracking down and capturing the Sinestro Corps rings find some of their handiwork, the fact some of the bodies have been torn apart violently while others have been killed by precise controlled blasts hints that they are still fighting over control of the ring.
    -   There's also Maash, who has three heads (stacked vertically), the topmost being an innocent man and the bottom two both being cruel psychopaths. The innocent head has no control over their body and can only watch his brothers' crimes helplessly.
-   The EC Comics story "The Basket" from _The Haunt of Fear_ features a two headed man who always keeps one of his heads covered with a basket so he can go in public. While one head is friendly the other is cruel and a murderer.
-   A four-headed, multi-limbed creature formed from the remains of four Football Hooligans is sent to kill John Constantine in one issue of _Hellblazer_. He notices the different tattoos on each side of the body, from opposing football teams (each pair of boys had a different favorite team) and tricks them into arguing with themselves long enough for him to escape while they rip themself (themselves?) to pieces.
-   _The Incredible Hulk_: Bi-Beast. Justified, since he's an android.
-   _Legends of the Dead Earth_: Subverted in _Action Comics_ Annual #8. Phisto, the two-headed Bizarro World security guard who turns out to be collaborating with Zarn terrorists, has one mind and his two heads are in perfect sync. They always either Speak in Unison or finish each other's sentences.
-   _Legion of Super-Heroes_: Double-Header of the Legion of Substitute Heroes in The DCU — This is his whole "power" — on his planet everyone undergoes mitosis at a certain age, but it happens over the course of some years. And his two heads don't even like each other, duh.
-   Hindrance and Perfidia from _Meat Cake_ comics. Although it's not sure if they're siamese twins... They argue constantly, though.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls_ story "Triple Threat" (Cartoon Network Block Party #58) has Mojo Jojo using a ray that initially seemed to have destroyed the girls, but actually makes them grow into a three-headed entity in a single body.
-   _Superman_:
    -   _Superman's Return to Krypton_ features a Kryptonian beast which looks like a horse with two lion heads.
    -   In _The Immortal Superman_, the titular hero runs into an old super-hero who once fought a weird four-headed monster called Kono-Beast.
-   _Supreme_:
    -   Baxter Frunnt... sort of. He's got one _head_ so to speak, but it's got two bodies and personalities and faces to control, since his back is the other guy's front.
    -   In one issue, Suprema encounters a demon with seven heads, each embodying one of the Seven Deadly Sins. They don't get on with each other very well.
-   In _Ultimate X-Men_, Syndicate is the name for mutant conjoined twin brothers. They have two interlocked heads and three arms. They attempted to rob a bank, but Prof. Xavier stopped them. Afterwards, Xavier hired them to investigate the Hellfire club.

    Comic Strips 

-   George and Tail, recurring characters from the marginal comic strip of _Cricket_ magazine, are the independently-sentient head and tail of one earthworm.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: Vivienne Graham and San have this after their transformation into a Two Beings, One Body Kaiju, with their merged form having two heads which house either of their minds, similar to Ghidorah's three heads before them. In their first form, San's head is little more than half a vestigial head located on their back, but he gains a fully functional head and neck after their second transformation.
-   _The Bridge_: Grand King Ghidorah might seem to be this at first as he can speak out of each of his three heads, but is ultimately an aversion when it's found targeting the heads doesn't do much. The reason he can suffer massive damage to, or even lose one of his three heads is because none of them actually contain a brain. Bizarre Alien Biology is used as a reminder he's not a dragon like the Equestrian dragons, but an alien Animalistic Abomination that _resembles_ a dragon. His actual brain, or rather equivalent, is in his chest.
-   The two-headed Hideous Gobblsnutch in _Captain Proton and the Planet of Lesbians_.
    
    "Ohhhh, I don't know..." said Left Head, quivering with fear and indecision.  
    "Can't you make up your mind for once?" snapped Right Head.  
    "How can I when I've got two of them!"
    

-   In the "Dark Woods Circus" series of Vocaloid PV's, Rin and Len Kagamine are confined to a mental institution and later have their heads chopped off and sewn onto one body.
-   _Duran And Kiyohime's Omake Theater_: Kiyohime has six heads. They all have different personalities. Head #4 is noted as being the daredevil of the group. Also, each head insists on its own food bowl, which Natsuki complains about, pointing out they all share one stomach. And each has its own taste in music, as they have separate headphones and players for each one.
-   _Kaiju Revolution_: Each of King Ghidorah's three heads have an independent personality, the center head is dominant and the most well-coordinated, the right head is a Blood Knight who will lash out even against the center's wishes, the left head seems to be self-loathing due to its tendency to nip at his body in disgust.
-   _The Legend of Spyro: A New Dawn_: The Big Bad Deadlock is a three headed dragoness, each of which have their own personality and mind. Justified, as she's not technically one dragon, but conjoined triplets. Originally her three heads did bicker and fight, which is where her name came from, but eventually developed telepathy and now her heads get along well. This makes her quite dangerous, as each head is a different element and can mix and match them as a result.
-   In ibenz009's 2020 Liliraune TF comic, besides the two main protagonists getting transformed into a Liliraune (which has two humanoid bodies with separate minds sprouting from a single plant), the plant's two flowers themselves seem to have independent minds based on the final panel.
-   _Nine Days Down_: While Briareos the hekatonkheire speaks in a single chorus of voices, his fifty heads all technically have their own thought processes and must come to agreement over how to act. He reflects this by using "I" when his minds are all in concert and "we" when there is debate and only a majority supports what he is currently saying or doing. Additionally, while his heads usually display a single common mood at a time, there are always at least a few that show distinct emotions from the rest.
-   _Pony POV Series_: The Dragon Goddess Queen Tiamat is a gigantic Kaiju sized dragon with five heads. Each head seems to have a mind of its own, but they never fight. When she meets Queen Majesty, each head is also shown having differing emotions and reactions, with one even _sleeping_ while the others are fully awake.
-   _RealityCheck's Nyxverse_: In _Nyx's Family_, after eating way too many fire opals, Garble grows huge and sprouts two extra heads, both of which have their own minds. Some time after the battle is over, it's revealed that dragons are not meant to have multiple heads, so his own physiology and self-healing properties will cause him to gradually split into three dragons, a slow, laborious and incredibly painful process that will take at least a year or longer to complete. Garble isn't very happy about this.

    Eastern Animation 

-   Most of the dragons in _Hungarian Folk Tales_ follow the tradition of having either three, seven or twelve heads. Because of the folk art-inspired animation style, at times they appear as green humans with one head adorned with multiple faces.
-   Each episode of the 90s Hungarian claymation series _Krisztofóró_ features the 14-minus-one-headed dragon telling a bedtime story to his three-headed baby. Every head seemingly has its own personality, which is not obvious at first because there's only five voice actors.

    Film — Animation 

-   _Dobrynya Nikitich and Zmey Gorynych_: Zmey Gorynych. Despite being referred to in the singular and being introduced with all three heads speaking in unison, the three heads frequently converse with each other and speak independently, with Zmey alternating between referring to himself in the singular and plural (though this might actually be a translation gaffe). The left head has a high-pitched voice, the middle head has a low-pitched voice, and the right head speaks with a pitch somewhere between the other two.
-   _Gallavants_: The Vanterviper's heads not only bicker, they also sing about their woeful plight.
    
    **Vanterviper:** Oh, I will cry, 'till the day I die,  
    Two heads _ain't better that one!_
    
-   _Gandahar_: Several of the Deformed have extra heads. Their leader has five, and at least two of them have different voices and personalities from his main head.
-   _Hercules_:
    -   The Hydra starts with a single head, but after Hercules decapitates it three more grow in its place. The heads glare at each other momentarily, and after Hercules keeps chopping off its heads the Hydra ends up with dozens of heads, wildly snapping and fighting each other over who gets to eat Hercules.
    -   Cerberus's three heads are shown fighting each other over a steak that Hades throws to them.
-   _How to Train Your Dragon_: Barf and Belch are one of a two-headed species of dragon called the Hideous Zippleback. The two heads work well in tandem, with Barf breathing out a flammable gas which Belch then ignites with a spark. However, having two separate riders, who happen to be bickering siblings, things are bound to get a little... difficult.
-   _The LEGO Movie_: Bad Cop/Good Cop doesn't have two heads, but two faces, each with drastically different personalities.
-   _The Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon_: Orochi's heads frequently fight over vats of wine, over who gets to eat Prince Susano, and two of the last three heads outright bite each other off.
-   _Monsters University_ has Terry and Terri, members of the Oozma Kappa fraternity. They bicker from time to time but are also shown to share genuine care between each other. When Mike tries to submit them as two people for the Scare-Offs to reach a minimum _head_\-count, he's immediately shut down due to monsters with multiple heads being commonplace, so they only count _bodies_ instead of heads.
-   _Quest for Camelot_: Devon and Cornwall, the two-headed dragon. They/he can't fly unless both heads can agree, which isn't often. They even have a full Disney Acid Sequence song about how much better their lives would be if they were apart.
-   _Ralph Breaks the Internet_: Double Dan. He is a slug-centaur (half human, half worm) and the overlord of the Dark Net's apothecary. He has a conjoined little brother tucked into the folds of his neck dubbed Little Dan, whose unusual appearance startles customers. Double Dan is extremely protective of his little brother, and those who show even the slightest bit of discomfort in the face of Little Dan will often become victim to Double Dan's wrath.
-   The main villains in _Son of the White Horse_ are the 3-headed, 7-headed and 12-headed dragons. Each are able to merge their heads into one for convenience's sake. The hero Treeshaker also tends to grow a second face when talking to his two brothers. And the griffin briefly sports a second head as he tries to fly Treeshaker out of the Underworld, in a nod to the double-headed eagle of old myth.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Three Headed Shark Attack_: The different heads of the shark occasionally nudge irritably at one another, or try to snatch the same human victim away from one another like competitors.
-   _Three Headed Monster_: The titular villain. The middle head is the one's that's in charge, while the left and right heads spends most of the film arguing with each other. Fittingly enough, the middle head is its sole weak spot — removing it will kill the monster instantly.
-   One of the bug-like creatures in _Evolution (2001)_ has a head on each end of its body, with an extensible tongue in each. The way it walks suggests that both ends are independently trying to steer its multiple legs.
-   Averted by most incarnations of King Ghidorah in the _Godzilla_ franchise — his three heads don't seem to have any distinct personalities from one another. Played straight by his _MonsterVerse_ incarnation in _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_, where his three heads display distinct personalities and are explicitly stated by the director to have separate minds (and are even portrayed by three different motion capture actors). The middle head is the dominant, most intelligent and most prominently sadistic head; the right head is a Hot-Blooded Blood Knight, and the left head is a Psychopathic Manchild with a short attention span that often annoys the middle head. His Red Baron title even reflects on this, as he's known as "the One Who is Many", and the director even gave each head its own name (Ichi, Ni and San/Kevin).
-   If you watch Fluffy the three-headed dog from _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_ carefully you can see that one head is paranoiacally alert, one is lazy smart-aleck, and the third is a Cloudcuckoolander.
-   In _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)_, Zaphod Beeblebrox's second head is retractable and came out from _under the other head_. It is eventually removed and used for collateral in exchange for the coordinates to Magrathea. Zaphod wasn't pleased, but it was just fine with everyone else, since the head was nasty, abusive, obnoxious and wouldn't be missed. Unfortunately, this greatly reduced his intelligence. Which, this being Zaphod, is saying quite a bit!
-   _The Incredible 2 Headed Transplant_: When a brilliant yet obsessive surgeon is cast out by the medical community, he takes science to a shocking new level - by grafting the head of one man onto the body of another. But his terrifying two-headed creation escapes the lab and goes on a rampage!
-   The main antagonist in _Jack the Giant Slayer_ is a two-headed giant named Fallon. The main head is in the normal, above the neck position and does all the talking. The second head is attached to his right shoulder. It's much smaller and much less intelligent. Despite all this, the two heads seem to get along just fine.

-   _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_: The Three-Headed knight. The heads start out speaking in unison, but once one of them breaks synchronization, the three start arguing about whether to kill Sir Robin, then bitch about each other, and then disagree on what to do _after_ killing him, giving him the time to bravely run away.
-   _The Phantom Menace_: Fode and Beed, the two-headed Troig announcer , though the only clue to the differing personalities is that each head speaks a different language. To be fair, there are two main languages on Tatooine: Galactic Basic and Huttese. Some people can't understand Basic but do understand Huttese, and vice versa. That particular announcer was chosen because he could easily and fluently speak both at the same time.
    -   This trope is deconstructed in a _HoloNet News_ story in _Legends_. Said story features a Troig named Dwuir and Tabb, with the former wanting them to be surgically separated due to his "brother", according to him, being mentally ill and suicidal. Unfortunately, the process is complicated by the fact that the separation could kill Tabb, and Troig medical technology has not advanced far enough to do that safely, but at the same time, not separating them could endanger both of them. This ethical dilemma sparked controversy that lasted all the way from the Clone Wars into the New Republic.
-   In _Spider-Man 2_, Dr. Octopus performs his nuclear fusion experiments with the help of four robotic tentacles which are attached to his spine, so that he can control them with his mind. Their artificial intelligence is so advanced that he had an inhibitor chip included to make sure that he could control them, and not the other way around. The inhibitor chip gets destroyed when his demonstration goes wrong, which allows them to assert their own personality and persuade him to start committing crimes in order to restart his research. In his dialogue with the arms it looks as if he’s got four mechanical serpents all whispering toxic advice in his ear.
-   _The Thing with Two Heads_ plays this seriously. Or at least they try to. Doctors are forced to transplant the head of a dying, racist surgeon onto the body of a black death row inmate.
-   Averted by the three-headed Tusseladd in _Trolljegeren_. Only the center head actually has a brain or eyes; the other heads grow just to hone the creature's sense of smell with additional noses.
-   The two-headed Makhai from _Wrath of the Titans_ are two-headed, double-torso'd, sword-wielding killing machines. Each of these deadly duos is composed of two fallen souls from the underworld that have been conjoined and forced to fight as one creature for all eternity.

    Literature 

-   _Abarat_: The Brothers John, one of whom is a Jerkass who always bickers with the others.
-   The Mary E. Lowd short story _The Ambi-Cognitive Man_ plays with this. Conjoined Twins are somewhat common in this setting, though they have different cultures. The main characters are Tom and Henry, conjoined twins who each have their own name and distinct personalities. They eventually meet Lori, another pair of conjoined twins who share the same name. Notably, one head is more dominant, while the other is more quiet. Lori's two heads occasionally speak in alternating sentences, and use the first person singular to refer to both heads collectively. Cases where the heads have separate personalities and neither dominates the other are referred to as being "ambi-cognitive". Halfway through, they visit a schoolhouse. The heads are seen conversing with each other (referred to as "thinking out loud"). Focus is given on one kid where both heads are rather outspoken and combative with each other. As Lori explains, eventually the two heads will learn how to cooperate better, or as Henry put it, he will "dominate himself".
-   _Book of Imaginary Beings_: The hundred-heads is a fish with a hundred distinct heads, each from a different animal.
-   _A Canticle for Leibowitz_: Shows up twice, and is an important plot point both times. The two-headed mutant who kills Brother Francis doesn't display two personalities, but conclusively ends the first section. Rachel's evolution in the third section, as her second, atrophied head begins to display more and more independent will, is played as the return of a sinless being to earth, highlighting the book's theme of history being cyclical.
-   _Carnival in a Fix_: The Haunted House attraction is run by a two-headed alien. Both heads are named Stan, so that is what they're collectively called>
-   _Deathmoor_ has the moor earn its name from the numerous monsters and hazards living in it, one of them being the dreaded Craddoc: a reptilian monster with the heads of an ogre and a dragon sharing the neck. It's strong enough that it needs to be killed _twice_ (once for each head), and after killing it one of its heads must be severed to prevent it from returning. Specifically the ogre's — sever the dragon's head and it reattaches itself in an instant, before mauling its would-be killer from behind to death.
-   In "The Disadvantage of Having Two Heads", one of G. K. Chesterton's stories, after several knights have failed to kill a one-headed giant, Red Legs kills a two-headed one because it's too busy quarreling with itself to notice his approach.
-   _The Divine Comedy_: In addition to Cerberus (who has three heads like in the original myths), Satan himself has three faces, meant to be the opposite of the Holy Trinity.
-   _Doctor Dolittle_ features the Pushmi-Pullyu (pronounced "push-me—pull-you") is a "gazelle/unicorn cross" with two heads (one of each) at opposite ends of its body. The pushmi-pullyu usually only uses one of its heads to talk, reserving the other for eating (thus allowing it to eat while speaking without being rude) and claims that its great-grandfather was the last unicorn.
-   _Dreamspeaker_: Sisiutl is a size-changing snake with a head at both ends of its body.
-   _First Person Plural_: The brothers are dicephalus conjoined twins (two heads, one body). One brother is gay and the other is straight.
-   _Harry Potter_: Runespoors, a species of magic snake from the background book _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_, have the three heads each with a different personality. The left head is the planner, the center head is the dreamer, and the right head is always a Caustic Critic, so the middle and left heads often team up to bite it off.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Trilogy_:
    -   Zaphod Beeblebrox fluctuates between being one and two people, according to the Rule of Funny. He operates as a unit most of the time, and only talks to himself when it's plot-appropriate. However, he can get hit on one head and knocked out, only for the other head to say, "What was that noise?"
    -   In _And Another Thing..._ (a sixth _Hitchhiker_ book, planned by Douglas Adams and written by Eoin Colfer with Adams' notes and the blessing of the Adams estate), the left head has been surgically removed and cyborged into the Heart of Gold to run it better. It has a completely different personality from the Zaphod of the previous five books; a straight-laced accountant type who detests the excesses of the lifestyle he was forced to live as part of the Zaphod unit. Evidently it's entirely normal for Betelgeuse Five-icans; each head has a distinct personality, but one head will have the "dominant" personality and the other head's personality will be suppressed unless similarly removed.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: The true form of Kallen Selios is that of a four-headed chimera. Three of them (goat, lion and dragon) emerge from her neck and the fourth one (snake) comes out of her posterior as a tail. All of them represent different aspects of her personality and so they present different viewpoints. Thus they argue.

-   _Ology Series_: Hydras, in _Dragonology_, typically have three heads, but can have more. _Monsterology_ includes chimeras, with the usual snake, goat and lion heads, and a prehistoric phoenix parasite preserved in amber, which appears to be an insect with two heads.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Downplayed. The Targaryen house sigil is a three-headed dragon. No _real_ multi-headed dragons appear in The 'Verse, but it symbolizes a Rule of Three motif that recurrs with Daenerys, the most prominent Targaryen in the story. It also serves as an analogy to her three (separate, one-headed) dragons.

-   _The Toymaker's Apprentice_: When the mouse queen is pregnant, everyone is expecting her to give birth to seven mouse princes. She ultimately gives birth to a single mouse with seven heads.
-   _Triss_: Zassaliss, Harssacss, and Sesstra weren't born conjoined, but a mace and chain thrown by the fighter who killed their mother bound their bodies together when they were little. Since they're snakes and therefore have no hands with which to untie it, they're permanently stuck. Zassaliss, the oldest of the triplets, took charge and bullied the other two into learning to coordinate with his movements. One really feels sorry for Sesstra, the only female...
-   _Universe_: Joe-Jim the two-headed mutant is one of the earliest modern types, and probably the first to be specifically described as a mutant.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Aquabats! Super Show!_: "Ladyfingers!" features a siren with three heads named Quera, Hera and Vera. While Hera and Vera are evil and plot to devour the Aquabats, Quera ends up falling for Ricky Fitness and turning good.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: This becomes the subject of a Visual Pun when Spike takes on a reptile demon.
    
    **Spike:** All right, heads up! _\[demon lifts up three heads; Spike gets an Oh, Crap! look\]_ Heads it is then.
    
    -   _Angel_: A demon in Lorne's bar sings a duet of "Bye Bye Love", which you can do if you've got a second head in your chest.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Time Lords can apparently end up like this if a regeneration goes really wonky, although we've yet to actually see this. The Ninth Doctor claimed he could have two heads ("Or no head!") before regenerating, and the Eleventh mentioned a two-headed godmother.
    -   "The Time of Angels": The Doctor tells an anecdote about a planet of two-headed people.
        
        **The Doctor:** Very relaxed, sort of cheerful. That's from having two heads. You're never short of a snog with an extra head. _\[...\]_ Then they started having laws against self-marrying and what was that about? But that's the church for you.  
        _\[...\]_  
        **Amy Pond:** Church had a point, if you think about it. The divorces must have been _messy_.
        
        -   The anecdote also serves as a bit of foreshadowing. If the people on that planet had two heads, then why do all the statues in their crypt have only one head?
-   _Groundling Marsh_: There's a two-headed monster named Mud/Slinger. Their grandcestors (ancestors) were once two separate beings and lived alone in the marsh with no friends. After meeting, they became good friends, and wanted to be merged into one so that they'd never be alone again. They drank a potion that merged them into a two-headed being, and ever since then all of their descendants have been conjoined.
-   The TV version of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1981)_ had to try and portray Zaphod Beeblebrox with the special-effects technology of the early 1980s and the budget of a BBC science-fiction series. The result was not terribly successful.
-   _I Love Lucy_: In a dream sequence, Lucy imagines her neighbors Fred and Ethel as a bickering two-headed dragon.
-   _Lexx_: Robot head 790 has himself sewn to the shoulder of a largely mindless cyborg drone, with whose mutterings he grows so annoyed that he punches himself in the other face.
-   _The Librarians 2014_: In "and the Tears of a Clown", Eve is transformed in a two-headed woman as part of a freak show. Her second head is more irreverent and a bit lecherous that the original.
-   _The Muppet Show_: Tom, Dick, and Harry are three heads on a single body. They disagree about who's in charge of the... er... group?, what their intended act is, and such. Also, according to Harry, Dick is female.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   In one episode of _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_, the Monster of the Week was a Two-Headed Parrot (one head was where you'd expect a head to be, the other was on its chest); at first the two heads were able to cooperate excellently, but the Rangers were able to get the jump on it by finding a tropical fruit it liked, and get the two heads arguing over it.
    -   That wasn't the first time; previously, there was Goatan the Lion Goat, another two-headed monster, who's two heads got along just fine.
-   In the fairy tale episode of _Scrubs_, an inseparable couple is described as a two-headed monster.
-   _Sesame Street_:
    -   The Two-Headed Monster is, as the name implies, a monster with two heads. He speaks gibberish that resembles baby talk, and many of his skits have to do with either cooperation or sounding out parts of words that suddenly show up.

-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In "Mr. Dingle, the Strong", the Martian scientist's two heads each have their own personality. They seem to get along well.
-   Multi-headed kaiju appear in some _Ultra Series_:
    -   Pandon, the final enemy in _Ultraseven_, is the best known example in the franchise. In some series, he has two heads on a single neck, making him more of a Two-Faced monster but in others, the heads are on separate necks. It's been stated that the left head is male and the right head is female, but that doesn't really matter when the Ultra heroes are being seared by twin jets of fire from a kaiju as formidable as Pandon.
    -   Each of Fire-Draco's three heads in _Ultraman 80_ has their own personality, appearance, powers, and even human form (the mortal reincarnations of the monster after its essence was sealed away centuries ago). The central red head appears as a fire-eater and possesses a flaming Breath Weapon; the left head is blue and can bash 80 with his thick skull due to his human form being a strongman; and the white head on the right is reborn as the young descendant of the priest who originally defeated Fire-Draco and is the Token Good Teammate forced to help the other two heads' reincarnations regain their original form.
    -   Jashrine from _Ultraman Mebius_ has three heads stacked like a totem pole, each with their own emotion motif and powers. The top head is angry and wields a giant Battle Boomerang; the middle head is happy and a straightforward martial artist; the bottom head is sad and uses telekinesis. However, only one head at a time can act and speak, and they often finish each other's sentences as the active head changes.
    -   The same series also has the Dinozaur, which has only one head, but two tails. But if you destroy the monster's head, the tails will grow into heads and the entire body will flip over, becoming a _Dinozaur Reverse_.
-   The _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_ game "Three-headed Broadway Star" has three players join together and sing a fictional Broadway song, one word per head. This commonly leads to non-sequitur mishaps.

    Magazine 

-   _Analog_: The May 1941 cover has someone who looks like a human, but they have two heads. The interior artwork on page 9, first page for Robert A. Heinlein's "Universe", also has a two-headed man.

    Music 

-   Many 1960s Psychedelic Rock albums like to portray multiple headed gods on their album cover, inspired by Hinduistic and Buddhistic art. Examples are Jimi Hendrix' _Axis: Bold As Love_ and _Anthem of the Sun_ by The Grateful Dead.
-   The eponymous conjoined twins of the fictional band Evelyn Evelyn usually get along fine, but their self-titled song "Evelyn Evelyn" explores their disagreements:
    
    _We grew up so very close.  
    A parasite needs a host.  
    I'm only trying to do what is best for us.  
    Well, I never asked for this, I never wanted this.  
    All that I want is some time to myself.  
    Looking in your eyes, I'm coming home.  
    Just get away from me, please just stop touching me.  
    You're always trying to be somebody else.  
    Now I realize I'm not alone._
    
-   Insane Clown Posse mention this in the song "Down with the Clown":
    
    _What if I grew another fuckin' head?  
    And his name was violent... Ed?  
    And he'd headbutt me every time I cussed.  
    I would need two microphones when I bust.  
    Would you show me love even with another head?  
    Or would you be like: "FUCK YOU AND ED"!_
    
-   This is invoked in the Vocaloid song "Dark Woods Circus". Two twins are spliced together and forced to join a freak-show.
-   Played out tragically in _Poor Edward_ by Tom Waits. Edward has the face of a woman on the back of his head. He controls the body, but she can speak and exerts her evil influence over him and eventually drives him to suicide.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Slavic Mythology: The war and divination god of the island of Rügen, Svetovid, has four heads that represent the cardinal directions or the seasons. There is also the three-headed god Triglav<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , whose heads represent heaven, earth, and the underworld.

    Poetry 

-   The poem "Us" by Shel Silverstein; something of an extreme example, as the accompanying drawing shows two faces stuck onto the _same_ head.

    Podcasts 

-   Tuatha from _The Fallen Gods_ has a pet Cerberus-Yorkie whose three names (Susienka, Binggan, Keksi) all mean "biscuit" in Slovak, Mandarin, and Finnish respectively. They also disagree often, with one having opposite opinions from another and the third acting as a neutral party.
-   _Welcome to Night Vale_:
    -   Hiram McDaniels, who is literally a five-headed dragon. Cecil berates his audience about believing the stereotype of multi-headed beings bickering with themselves, right before Hiram proves it true.
    -   A high school senior grows a second head, which ultimately leads to the football team getting disqualified (team numbers are counted by heads, not bodies, apparently). His mother has a head removed... the original one, because she likes the new one better.

    Radio 

-   _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme_: The fifth series features a song by Cerberus himself, voiced by all three of the male cast (Finnemore himself, Simon Kane, and Lawrie Llewyn), each head with its own personality, so Cerberus addresses itself as "we". The song is basically a Sympathy for the Devil song (though Cerberus is not exactly a "Devil" except to people who don't portray him correctly) in which Cerberus laments that people don't show the Big Friendly Dog some kindness and affection instead of just fighting him all the time.
    
    _"They stab or slash or try to choke him,  
    They don't pat him, they don't stroke him,  
    No, not the tiniest amount!  
    No-one squeaks his squeaky toy,  
    No-one tells him he's a good boy,  
    Or three good boys, depending how you count!"_
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   _13th Age_: The two-headed ettins are smarter than most giants, but the heads always disagree with and hamper each other in everything they set out to do.
-   _Blood Bowl_: The Two Heads mutation is a physical ability available to any player on a Chaos, Nurgle and Skaven team that gives them a bonus to their Dodge rolls. The Skaven are particularly fond of this mutation with their most famous Star Player, Tarsh Surehands, having a pair of heads. Unfortunately Tarsh strangled himself to death after his heads got into an argument about a missed pass during an important game.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The Demon Prince Demogorgon, whose heads allegedly have _competing spy networks_ and who constantly scheme against each other. They also have individual names — Aameul and Hethradiah; Aameul favors plans that use deception, while Hethradiath favors unsubtle raw power. Oddly enough, Demogorgon often benefits from this rivalry; one popular legend states that Aameul made a bargain with a lich queen, making her unprepared for a vicious pre-emptive strike by Hethradiah's forces; as a result, she was slain, giving Demogorgon as a whole her lands, wealth, and resources.
    -   The Slaad lord Bazim-Gorag has two heads, which mainly act in concert but do possess independent wills. In 3E, this gives him the Double Mind rules, which allows him to multitask without penalty — for instance, having one head control his body while the other focuses on spellcasting or surveying the battlefield, or casting two different spells at once — as well as counting him as two creatures for the purposes of mind-affecting spells.
    -   Ettins are a race of two-headed giants. In early editions, one head (usually the one on the right) is usually the dominant one, so they rarely argue. In 5<sup>th</sup>, however, the two heads rarely get along, spending most of their time arguing and insulting one another like bickering siblings. Each head has its own name, and the ettin is usually referred to by a compound of these names.
        -   A 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition adventure features a human man who was turned into an ettin, with his mind in the left head and a new evil personality in the right head that is slowly taking control.
        -   In the 4<sup>th</sup> Edition adventure _Madness at Gardmore Abbey_, a key location is guarded by an ettin whose two heads, individually named Spike and Bruse, sleep in shifts, so it's possible to catch it when only one is awake. They have slightly different priorities, so while they carry out their guard duties meticulously if they're both awake, each can be bribed in a different manner if caught while the other head is asleep.
        -   An ettin needs to implaneted with two mind flayer tadpoles to undergo ceremorphosis and become a mind flayer-like monster known as a ceremorph. If the procedure is successful, one of the new ceremorph's heads sinks into its torso, with its brain focusing on controlling the giant body, leaving the other free to focus on cognition and psionics.
    -   The Angry, a type of sorrosworn embodying anger and hostility, have two heads each, which constantly bicker and argue with one another until they find something else to vent their wrath on.
    -   In the template-heavy days of 3.5, there's "Multiheaded Creature", although it does put a reasonable limit on how many heads were added.
    -   Subverted with Geryon in 4<sup>th</sup> Edition. He has three heads, with one being thoughtful and conniving, one being angry and cruel, and one being manic and gleeful. However, they actually share one mind, never argue with each other, and normally only one will talk at a time, with the dominant head being determined by his emotional state.
    -   Death dogs are giant two-headed dogs with a nasty bite that lowers maximum hp indefinitely until the effect is cured. However, both heads are sapient and the monster manuals of all editions they appear in suggest they can be avoided if the player can start a conflict between the heads.
    -   Dread linnorms have two heads, each with a different Breath Weapon — one head breathes fire, the other ice.
    -   Skull Lords have three heads, but in this case, this was a punishment Vecna meted out on his generals for fighting over his throne after his death. He stitched them together in threes upon his ascension to godhood, and since each head of a Skull Lord constantly plots against the other two, each Skull Lord is its own worst enemy.

-   _Necromunda_: Having two heads is one of the options for mutant Scavvies. The mutation gives the model a 180 degree field of vision and allows them to fire two pistols at the same time as each head is able to aim and fire one of the guns.
-   _Pathfinder_: Many creatures have extranumerary heads, each with its own consciousness. While this is a minimal issue in instinct-driven animals, it results in interesting intrapersonal dynamics in more intelligent beings.
    -   Vydrarchs and elder wyrms both have two heads, which for the most part act in concert but have been known to talk and even argue with one another. Jotund trolls have _nine_ heads, which invariably all bicker with each other (usually about who gets to actually taste their prey).
    -   Magdh of the fae has three faces, mother, maiden, and crone. She is attended by a heirarchy of faerie dragons, amongst whom seniority is determined by the number of heads they have.
    -   Ettins are two-headed giants whose heads often argue with one another and need to agree on common plans of action before doing things. A religious sect of ettins, the Children of Balance, seeks to deal with these issues by fostering balance between opposing viewpoints, ensuring cooperation between their selves while benefiting from diversity of thought and outlook — their leader, for instance, has a Neutral Good head and a Neutral Evil one. They chiefly worship and try to emulate dualistic deities as a result, such as the goddess of life and death, the god of creative and destructive magic, and the god/dess of the sky and the sea.
    -   Mukradis are immense centipedes with three heads, each of which possesses a different Breath Weapon — fire, lightning and acid.
    -   Neothelid overlords have two heads, a manifestation of the minds of two powerful neothelids struggling for supremacy after one devoured the other.
-   Examples present in _Warhammer 40,000_, _Warhammer_ and _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_:
    -   Kairos Fateweaver, a Greater Daemon of Tzeentch, the God of change, magic, hope and random mutation, has two heads, one of which can only see the past while the other can only see the future.
    -   Karanak, the Hound of Vengeance, is a three-headed Flesh Hound of the Blood God Khorne to fit with his Cerberus theme. The first of Karanak's heads can track his quarry across space, the second follows them across time while the third can sense his prey's thoughts.
    -   _Warhammer_: When a daemon possessed the great dragon Galrauch, the Gold Drake's head and neck split down the middle creating two ferocious heads. The possession wasn't complete, however, and Galrauch's original personality will sometimes emerge to take control of one of the heads and attack the other. His Chaos dragon descendants often inherit this mutation, and each of their heads possesses a different breath weapon — typically, one head breathes fire and the other corrosive gas.
    -   _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_: The God of Destruction Gorkamorka has two heads due to being a fusion of the orc brother gods Gork and Mork from the-world-that-was. They stay as a composite being until they get to arguing with one another, which happens often, at which point Gorkamorka splits back into his component selves.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_:
    -   The Spikit, a double-headed beast of burden.
    -   Rahkshi Kaita Za, the combiner model of Turahk, Lerahk and Kurahk.
-   In _Flush Force_, there is the Gruesome Twosome team, made up of two-headed animals.
-   Two-Bad of _Masters of the Universe_ fame. In fact, in the 2002 cartoon, they devoted an episode to explaining how they came to exist and another episode to their scheme to become separated from each other.

    Video Games 

-   _Arcuz_: The final boss is a two-headed giant who is/are are a sibling pair — and, somehow, one is the elder and the other is younger.
-   _Assault Retribution_: Boss No. 2 is a giant mutant whose body consist of three reptilian heads fused together at the neck, and take turns breathing fire and lashing out at the player. All three heads share a life meter, but only the attacking head is vulnerable, the other two being protected by an organic forcefield (which deactivates when it attacks). Rinse, repeat, until it goes down.
-   _Bayonetta_:
    -   Many of the angels in the series are a notable aversion of this trope. All of them are Eldritch Abominations, and many of them have multiple heads or faces, but each of them is depicted as a singular entity. Most notably, the Auditio Fortitudo is a dragon with three heads/faces, much like the Hydreigon example, but only one of its heads (the humanlike face on its chest) is shown to have a personality/mind and presumably controls the whole creature.
    -   The demon Greed has three heads and, unlike most of the angels, is depicted as a savage, feral creature. As such, it's unknown whether it plays this trope straight or is another notable aversion.

-   _Dahna Megami Tanjo_ has a two-headed, four-armed demon knight serving as a boss, and as the battle progresses it lose two limbs and a head before it's knocked off a tower. The same boss returns a few levels later after its defeat for a rematch, with only two arms and a head.
-   _Day of the Tentacle_: Near the end the three protagonists appear to get turned into a three-headed hybrid by a time machine accident. It later turns out they had simply gotten stuck inside one set of clothes.
-   _Deltarune_: Clover, being based on the clubs playing card suit, is a three-headed... quadruped of some kind. One head is friendly, one is cranky and self-centered, and one is a Shrinking Violet. They do agree on some things, though, and the trick to ending the fight with them is to get them talking about those subjects.
-   _Digital Devil Saga_ has Heat's avatar Agni and Argilla's avatar Prithivi (which are located on the breasts). Heat also gives us this great line.
    
    "Two heads means you will be devoured twice as fast."
    
-   _Dota 2_ has two two-headed characters — Ogre Magi (a spiritual successor to the ones in the Warcraft example above, considering the game's roots), and Jakiro, the Twin-Headed Dragon. Both characters mostly get along with themselves - Ogre Magi correct each other's mistakes and share control of the body, and have enough of a brain together to be somewhat intelligent, unlike most other ogres — although they do blame each other for dying, and, as an idle animation, they punch each other. Jakiro's heads congratulate each other on the remarks towards their rivals, as well as on some kills - when they're not trying to take the credit all to one of them, or when they're not blaming each other for failure. They also snap at each other as an idle animation occasionally.
-   _Dragon's Lair_: In _Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp_, on "The Garden of Eden" level, there's a two-headed serpent. One head tries to eat Dirk while the other tries to strike a deal.
-   _Eric the Unready_: Eric has to get a two-headed oaf arguing with itself at one point to continue.
-   _Face Raiders_: There is a two-faced enemy that represents angry and sad on its sides.

-   _Island Saver_: The Mythic Wolf, Funny Flamingo and Mythic Turtle of Fantasy Island each have two heads.
-   _Jade Empire_ features the Minion of Suffering, who is humanoid, but has two cow's heads.
-   _Kid Icarus: Uprising_ has Hewdraw, a three-headed dragon who has an angry and boisterous head, a mellow head (who just wants to give up and go home), and a really posh, polite head that has a British accent. When you first meet them, the three heads wind up arguing in such a cacophony of noise that you can barely understand what they're saying.
-   _Killer Instinct_ has the unusual case of Eyedol, who had two separate heads in the original _KI_ while the reboot gave him two _halves_ of a head, thanks to Gargos<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Despite this, the reboot version fits the spirit of the trope better; he uses a Stance System based on which head is awake (one is a rushdown character, the other is a zoner), the player can change styles by punching the sleeping head until it wakes up, and his Instinct Mode wakes both heads at the same time and combines their moves (like the rushdown form's Shoryuken being followed by the zoning form's meteor rain).

-   _Kingdom Rush: Origins_: Ettins have two heads that disagree with each other every now and then, causing it to hit itself with its own club and stunning it for a brief while.
-   _Kirby's Return to Dream Land_: Landia is a four-headed dragon that's able to split into four, single-headed dragons. It's implied that its split form may be is true one, as, if it's defeated in its fused state, it'll split apart, and it/they remain this way after the Master Crown is removed from them.
-   _Krush Kill n' Destroy_: The two faces of the female mutant in _KKnD 2_ do not get along.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_: The boss Trinexx is a giant tortoise with three heads; a central one, a blue one that breathes ice that leaves frozen trails on the floor, and a red one breathes fire. The two elemental heads get cut off over the course of the battle.
-   _Mega Man_
    -   _Mega Man 8_ has Search Man and his two heads. Wily thought that a two-headed robot master would be better for searching than a single-headed one.
    -   _Mega Man Zero_: As a Mechaniloid based on the Orochi, the guard Orotic has eight head, a pair each for Fire, Ice, Lightning and Non-Elemental.
-   _Miscreated_ has two-headed dogs as an enemy type.
-   _Monster Hunter Generations_: The Nakarkos is one of these made from bones... or so it seems. It's actually a massive cephalopod-like monster that attaches the bones of the prey it eats to its tentacles to maintain the _appearance_ of a two-headed corpse serpent, tricking its foe into thinking it's fighting more enemies than it really is.
-   _Mordheim: City of the Damned_ has a partial example played for Body Horror. The Extra Face mutation gives a Chaos fighter a second face which overlaps with the original, resulting in a face with two noses, three eyes and two sets of lips over an enormous mouth. The effect is akin to a visual glitch and very freaky.
-   _Mutant Football League_: Brickhead "Bricks" Mulligan, the color commentator, has a "mutant hobbit head" that lives on his shoulder: Bricks, Jr. Junior _hates_ Bricks. Eerily, it's strongly implied he can somehow separate from Bricks's body and move around on his own; sometimes he asks Bricks to provide an alibi as to his whereabouts last night if his parole officer calls. At the absolute minimum, Junior is fully formed enough to be capable of both vomiting and urinating of his own accord. Usually directly onto Bricks.

-   _Ninja: Shadow of Darkness_: The second boss is a two-headed Hellhound. When it first appears in a cutscene, both heads are actually arguing and snapping at each other, until your protagonist steps into view. Cue boss battle.

-   _Paladins_: Moji's familiar/steed, Po-Li, has two heads. The left one has a derpy face and shoots energy balls. The right one has a serious face and sprays magical fire. While not very powerful on their own, their attacks are much stronger when used together. They also both love Moji very much and often compete for her affection.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies_ has quite a few plants with multiple heads. While most of them show no signs of conflict, Cherry Bomb argues briefly with itself over whether to explode or detonate. In the end, they agree to explodonate.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Dodrio's three heads symbolize joy, sorrow, and anger. Dodrio's first form, Doduo, has two heads, but they have identical brains (usually).
    -   Zweilous has two heads that don't actually get along. They compete for food, even though they share a stomach. This leads to overeating. And then it evolves into the three-headed Hydreigon, a notable aversion of this trope that only has a brain in the middle "main" head. The other two heads behave more like its hands.
    -   Girafarig has a second head on its tail. Downplayed in its case, since the tail-head has no higher brain functions, but it is stimulated by smell and is able to alert the other head and bite on its own. When it evolves into Farigiraf, the tail-head surrounds the main head and acts both as a helmet and for increased intelligence, as there are now neurons connecting their brains. Both Farigiraf's outer head and inner head cooperate perfectly.
    -   Weezing has two heads, which produce two different toxins. According to the _Black/White_ dex entry, triplet Weezings also exist, but they are very rare.
    -   Vanilluxe and the Klink line from the same generation also have multiple heads. In the case of Vanilluxe, they're the results of a pair of partially melted Vanillish re-freezing overnight.
    -   Exeggutor's three heads all think independently, though they never argue due to their psychic powers. Alolan Exeggutor has _four_ heads due to the dopey looking one on its tail.
    -   Subverted by Binacle. Although its two barnacles attached to a rock, they can detach and move to another one. Then there is its evolution Barbaracle, who's made of _seven_ barnacles, four of which form its arms, another two its legs, and one for its "head". They usually follow the head's orders.
    -   The one-headed Capsakid evolves into the two-headed Scovillain. The red head spews spice-induced flames while the green head has a vicious temperament due to the spicy chemicals stimulating its brain.
    -   The trope is also subverted by Hydrapple. Despite the name suggesting this trope, Hydrapple's "heads" are actually seven separate "syrpents" inhabiting a single apple. They also don't always agree on when to attack, as seen in its signature move Fickle Beam, which has a 30% chance of all of the "syrpents" coming out and attacking in tandem to double the move's power.
-   _Project Dimentia Bodhisattva_: Aqua can convert herself into a two headed girl when pressing down, and can get three heads if she was in the level Sky Chasm at max level.
-   _Quest for Glory_: Whilst they all agree on the fact they're not going to let the Hero of Spielburg, The Prince of Shapeir, The Saviour of Fricana, and that oak that went to Moldavia, pass, Cerebrus, the guardian of Hades, seem to bicker and bitch about the foodstuffs the other two heads prefer, to the degree that they nearly start fighting with each other.
-   _Simon the Sorcerer_: There's a two-headed shopkeeper whose heads bicker about where the merchandise should go ("The asparagus jelly belongs with the other jellies!" "I think it belongs with the vegetables!"). Apparently they don't share digestive systems, since one head complains about needing to go to the toilet and the other snaps that he'll just have to restrain himself. It is revealed if you listen to them long enough, that they were originally one person (The right head) but he touched a glowing stone, causing a second head to grow from his shoulder. Whether this is magic or a mutation is never explained.
-   _Star Command Revolution_ has a Brain in a Jar example with the Triumverite race; beings with three disembodied brains floating in a canister where a head would be on a human. The responses of their in-game units include "Three heads are better than one!" They seem remarkably in sync, though.
-   Ashton, from _Star Ocean: The Second Story_ becomes fused in his introduction scene with a two-headed dragon. The two heads, Creepy and Weepy (or Gyrororo and Ururun in the Japanese version), constantly bicker with each other and with Ashton, though neither dragon head seems to take control of Ashton's arms and legs most of the time.
-   _Startopia_: The Turrakken race has two heads. When asked if they need anything, often each head will motion differently until they look at each other and agree. Which is probably why they make such good scientists. Each individual has two opinions, which allows for more ideas to be explored.
-   _Stonekeep_: The Ettin has two heads with very distinct personalities.

-   _Tak and the Power of Juju_ has the redneckish Two-headed Juju. The left head is named Rufus and the right one is Jerry.
-   _Temtem_: Orphyll has three heads, each with a different expression. The one on its left hisses, the one in the middle looks serious, and the one on its right is a Perpetual Smiler.
-   _ToeJam & Earl: Panic on Funkatron_ has Flarney, a two-headed alien who often stumbles over his words, due to both his heads trying to talk at the same time, leading to him getting confused and forgetting what he was talking about. In the end he decides to have them take turns, each getting to say one sentence at a time.
-   _Total War: Warhammer III_: In contrast to his depiction in the tabletop game, where his heads share a single personality, the two-headed daemon Kairos Fatewaever acts essentially as a pair of conjoined twins, as the two heads frequently bicker and debate, call each other "brother", and refer to themselves in the plural. They also differ in personality — the green-eyed left head, which sees the past, is impulsive and reckless, while the amber-eyed right head, which sees the future, is more restrained and pragmatic.
-   _Ultima VI_: There is a two-headed talking horse, named Pushme Pullyu as a Shout-Out to _Doctor Dolittle_. It resides in Blackthorn's Castle.
-   _The Ultimate Haunted House_: Herbert and Chauncey are a strange purple two-headed monster who love nothing more than to eat disgusting objects like severed body parts. Appetite aside, they're fairly cheerful and friendly for monsters, though whether they are a Non-Malicious Monster or Laughably Evil depends on the mood of the house.
-   _Viva Piñata_ has the Twingersnap, a version of the Syrupent with A Head at Each End, acquired by whacking a Syrupent egg with the shovel the moment before it hatches; its waking animation has one head get up first and nudge the other awake. Doing the same thing to a Twingersnap egg gets you a Fourheads, which has, well, four heads — three in front and one on the tail.
-   _Warcraft_:
    -   For the classic two-headed ogres, it's very much Depending on the Writer. In the RTS games, it's Played for Laughs, as they invariably argue with each other. Some keep this in _World of Warcraft_, but not always. Though there are very few of those you can actually _talk_ to, they're mostly just smart guys and might as well only have one head. Draz'zilb even refers to himself as "I", and the ogre king Imperator Mar'gok deliberately averts this.
    -   Blizzard actually had an April Fools joke about the ogres, claiming that two-headed ogres would be playable in _World of Warcraft_ as a sort of cooperative character. That is to say, two players each control a head, and both control movement. This being an April Fools joke, they of course emphasized all the features that made this playstyle incredibly inconvenient. This actually becomes a Brick Joke in _Heroes of the Storm_, as described below.
    -   There's one boss whose two heads argue with each other in a _Burning Crusade_ dungeon. The fact that each head has a separate aggro table frequently makes this an example of That One Boss for groups that bring a lot of squishy characters.
    -   There are also two bosses (Reliquary of Souls in _Burning Crusade_, and Devourer of Souls in _Wrath of the Lich King_) that are literally giant floating heads with three faces. They both have different voice actors, abilities, personas and even genders for each face.
    -   _Heroes of the Storm_: The Ogre Mage Cho'gall is a playable character. Unlike the other characters in the game, Cho'gall requires two players to control, with one player controlling Cho (a melee warrior who also controls the body) and the other controlling Gall, a spell caster. Naturally, they're based on Combination Attacks between the two players.
        
        **Cho:** I'm ready to serve, my master!  
        **Gall:** I—I... I'm not ready.
        
        -   Within _Warcraft_ the two heads had distinct personalities. Cho is the mastermind and main voice while Gall is insane and chants near gibberish with each line Cho speaks.
        
        **Cho:** Foolish mortals...  
        **Gall:** Usurpers' children!  
        **Cho:** Nothing you have done—  
        **Gall:** SPAAWWWN OF A LESSER GOD!  
        **Cho:** I. Am. _Trying._ To _speak_ here!  
        **Gall:** Words, words, words! The master wants MURDER!
        
    -   Notably averted with the two-headed ettins, at least until _Legion_ where a single quest mob will argue with himself.
-   _Prayer of the Faithless_: The "Protector & Doomsayer" enemy of Confinement has a white or silver-haired head, and a brown-haired head atop its necks, with Brown looking like the main one, and Silver coming off from a shoulder, then there's the face where their chest should be.
-   _Wizard101_: Billy the Brute the Ettin's right head is the dominant and more intelligent of the two and has to remind the left who's friend and who's food.
-   _Wobbledogs_: One of the rarer mutations allows dogs to have extra heads, so they can bark much more often.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_: When Consuls O and P fail to have the heroes killed, they Interlink into a single, hideous, two-headed Moebius. While both heads have minds of their own, they seem to be coordinated and use a Stance System based on which one is calling the shots. Unfortunately for them, one of the things they agree on, staying Interlinked for too long, results in their death via a localized Annihilation event, as O and P are both Stupid Evil.

    Webcomics 

-   _Commander Kitty_: Zenith's biggest and baddest monster has not only a giant bear head, but a pair of dragon heads for arms.
-   _Contemplating Reiko_: Zeni and Nadi Tweeling are dicephalic conjoined twins. Much of the comic's rare bouts of lighter humor revolve around the issues of two girls with one body, or their strange episodes of obliviousness to their condition.
-   _Digger_: The travelling merchant's bandersnatch has two heads, and although they're clearly distinct entities (the bandersnatch-unit is referred to as "us"), they pretty much agree about everything, and alternate speaking with each sentence.
-   _Dungeons & Denizens_: Donna and Diana are two heads on one hellhound body, hinted to be the result of momma dallying with Cerberus. They're distinct to the point of considering each other sisters... and romantic rivals for the attentions of the same orc (who wisely does his best to avoid them).
-   _Ghost of the Gulag_: Iosef and Grigori are a two-headed psychic boar Blind Seer. The two heads are partly fused and share a single central eye which grants them psychic abilities, though while Iosef sees Shadow Walker as a bringer of death Grigori sees him as a restorer of balance. Interestingly, the two boars seem to be of different species as well: Iosef is a Babirusa while Grigori is a European Wild Boar, and are divided in th middle between brown-furred and hairless.
-   _Girl Genius_: One of the first few strips shows the discarded experiment of a Mad Scientist, with one male and one female head, panhandling on a street corner with a sign saying "can't agree on a hat..."
-   _Housepets!_: Cerberus' heads' speech bubbles are colored in different shades of blue, but the only time they're seen talking to one another it looks more like thinking out loud.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   The chimera Trigak has a dragon's head, a lion's head and a goat's head, each of which can talk. Whether they have different personalities is unknown, since Belkar kills it shortly after it appears.
    -   In Funny Background Event, the succubus secretary of the three fiends tells them Miss Tiamat is holding on lines 2, 3, 5, 8 and 11. In this case, all five heads seem to be equally angry, given that all five roars are coming in through the phone. As do each of her five elemental breath weapons.
-   _Muertitos_: DJ Tonja doesn't so much have two heads as a second mouth on the back of her head, but the second mouth has its own personality, and often argues with the front face.
    
    **Tonja:** Could you at least stop eating while we're on the air? God, it's your fault we're so fat.  
    **Coochie:** Hey, YOU'RE fat, baby, I'M just a mouth on the back of your head.
    

-   _Partially Clips_: The Paradox Dragon (archived link) parodies the Knights and Knaves puzzle, with the dragons' three heads being unable to even agree on the rules, squabbling until it died of a migraine.

-   _Slightly Damned_: Cerberus is currently two-headed, and three-headed in flashbacks. The mental capacity of the heads varies. While its heads do get along, the severed third does enjoy the opportunity to spend some time alone.

-   _Spinnerette_: Minerva the Cerberus has three heads, each one with its own look and personality. The left head is the cute one, the right head is the brash, feisty one, and the middle head is the mature, moderate one. Interestingly, rather than being presented as three individuals sharing one body, it's more like Minerva is a single person who's thoughts are the same for all three heads, just filtered through different personality traits. According to her later on in the issue, the heads do not share thoughts (they have different personalities) but instead synchronize their memories during sleep. We see her heads talking to one another a few times in the book-only Issue #9. They also wind up a bit distracted thanks to a Hate Plague in Issue #13.
    
    **Middle:** I knew this dress was too short...  
    **Left:** Compared to the metal bikini?
    
-   _Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic_:
    -   The Chimera: the dragon head is an idiot, the lion head is a Cloudcuckoolander, while the goat head is quite smart but doesn't control the body and thus is often very frustrated with the other two.
    -   In one strip, the Chimera encounters a hydra whose heads are constantly arguing, bickering and squabbling — for example, they first argue about which path to take and then fight to assign blame when that path proved a poor one.
    -   One story arc follows a couple of ettins with love troubles, since both heads of the female ettin like the same head of the male ettin but not the other. The male ettin ends up asking the Chimera for advice.

-   _Dragon Tales_:
    -   Zak and Wheezie take this trope a little further than most: not only do they have different characters, they have different _genders_. It's a show for very little kids, so don't expect any of the inevitable (and potentially nightmarish) Fridge Logic to be addressed.
    -   One episode features a cat with a head at each end. One head only says "me," and the other says "ow."
-   _Duckman_: Duckman's conjoined sons Charles and Mambo.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons (1983)_: In one episode, Presto has to deal with a three-headed ogre who is hustling money with a Shell Game (using skulls and a marble). The Trope is subverted; not only do they cooperate, they do so _very_ well.

    **Sad Tom:** There was a plane crash.
    
-   _Filmation's Ghostbusters_ has the similar Fib-Face. His two faces were attached to one head 90 degrees from each other, and one can never be sure which head's telling the truth and which one's lying. Again, the only way to defeat him is to get the two heads arguing.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   "Put Your Head on My Shoulder" has Fry's head sewn onto Amy's shoulder after his body is damaged in a car accident. To make it more awkward, Fry had just broken up with Amy before the crash.
    -   We also see a dog with heads at both ends. The vet mentions that one needs to take pills, the other needs a suppository. A goat with heads at both ends appears in another episode.
-   _Future-Worm!_: In the episode "How to beat a cold... with Fists!", during an experimental trial by Danny, Future-Worm grows a second head for a second, with Fuch reacting.
    
    **Fuch:** Nope squared!
    
-   In _Garfield and Friends_/_U.S.Acres_, in the episode "Hogules II", in Orson's dream, Roy and Wade are a two-headed giant. Sharing the same body? Check. Different personalities? Check. Arguing with each other? And check.
-   _The Ghost and Molly McGee_: During the song in "All Systems No", Molly is bio-engineered into a purple-skinned three-headed mutant. She also has long necks, spots on her faces, and flower petals around the base of the necks.
-   _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_: Grim's dog Cerberus doesn't talk, but his heads (two husky-types and one poodle) don't always act the same. Two of his heads are immediately attracted to Mindy's chihuahua Little Delicious, and exchange glances of dismay when they realize that the middle head is growling at her. In the episode "Dream a Little Dream" during a nightmare sequence in Billy's mind, a bunny transforms and grows a second head.
-   _Inhumanoids_: Crygen and Pyre, the two bickering halves of Magnokor, sometimes merge into a two-headed and still-bickering form.
-   _Jackie Chan Adventures_: In one episode, Jackie gets a Jekyll & Hyde split which isn't completed, resulting in his Yin and Yang splinters being two heads atop one body which control either half of the body. He eventually gets fixed.
-   _The Jetsons_: In one episode, Elroy's scout troop has a camp-out on the moon and briefly encounters what seem to be a troop of aliens with two heads each. And the heads of one of the aliens talk to each other about having only one head being strange and scary.
-   _Jimmy Two-Shoes_: Demons with two or more heads make up a few of Miseryville's denizens, and one episode even had a Cute Monster Girl made of three separate bodies on a single waistline.
-   _Johnny Test_: In "Li'l Johnny", Johnny runs into Susan and Mary's lab to find them as two heads on one body. Their expanation? Don't ask!
-   _Kid Cosmic_: Boss Fiosa is a two-headed alien crimelord who wields the fire and ice stones. It's ambiguous whether her two heads have separate consciousnesses or not.
-   _Lloyd in Space_: One of Cindy's heads is nice and attractive; the other is mean and ugly. Lloyd only wants to date the nice one; the girls aren't having it.
-   _Masters of the Universe_:
    -   _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)_ and _She-Ra: Princess of Power_ features Two-Bad and Multi-Bot who fit this trope. Horde Prime is implied to (sort of) fit this trope too.
    -   _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2002)_ has Two-Bad as an invocation of this trope, after Skeletor has too much of two rival Bounty Hunters he hired<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  failing because of their constant bickering.
-   _Men in Black: The Series_: Alpha's first One-Winged Angel form after merging with several aliens using the Cosmic Integrator had multiple heads. A later episode reveals that the heads still have minds of their own, and they aren't happy about being trapped in Alpha's body and forced to do his bidding. A Symbiote that's absorbed by Alpha asks the others if they ever considered making a break for it, and they ask him how they can escape without bodies of their own. The fact that they still have their own bodies and cells is a method to how Alpha is finally defeated in that episode: When Alpha absorbs a second Symbiote (the mother of the first who's trying to get him back), the regenerating factor both Symbiotes possess is infused into all of Alpha's cells _and those of his sentient grafted body parts_, allowing them to regenerate their own bodies and break free of Alpha's own.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   "Feeling Pinkie Keen" sees the girls getting attacked by a four-headed hydra. One of the heads appears to be a little slow on the uptake — the other three heads roar in unison, for example, but the fourth one doesn't join in until it realizes what the other heads are doing — and at one point laughs at the others when their attempts to grab the ponies just earn them concussions or mouths filled with trees and rocks.
    -   "Somepony to Watch over Me": The talking chimera has three heads, each with its own distinct personality: a tiger, a goat and a snake. They refer to one another as sisters, and spend much of their time arguing with one another. They can't ever agree on what to eat (besides pies) and the goat and tiger heads bicker about who's in charge.
-   _The Neverending Story: The Animated Adventures of Bastian Balthazar Bux_: The aptly named Three-Head, whose three heads take turns at emerging from small slots in his shoulders and display distinct colors and personalities.
-   _Noah and Nelly in Skylark_: All of the animals in have two heads at each end of their body — an optimistic one and a pessimistic one.

-   _Planet Sheen_ has Princess Oom. One face is a bubbly cheerleader type and the other is an intense seductress. Both are in love with Sheen.
-   _Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor_ includes a two-headed giant named Boola.

-   _Sabrina and The Groovie Goolies_ also has a character with two heads.
-   _The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!_ features the tri-headed Tryclide, a serpent with three heads, who originated from _Super Mario Bros. 2_.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   At the very end of the "Treehouse of Horror II" segment "Homer's Nightmare", Mr. Burns' body is crushed, so he has his head surgically grafted to Homer's ample frame. Parodied in The Stinger with Homer complaining that this means he often has to cancel favorite activities in order to meet Mr. Burns' business obligations.
    -   The "Treehouse of Horror XXIV" segment "Dead and Shoulders" has Bart's head being grafted onto Lisa's body when he decapitates himself with the string of his kite.

    -   In the "Treehouse of Horror XXV" segment "School Is Hell", Bart reads Aramic that was written on a desk in Springfield Elementary. As the result, he and Lisa are transported to another school which is located in Hell. The principal has two heads.
-   _Space Goofs_: The two heads of the alien named Stereo often bicker with each other over trivial matters.

-   _Stripperella_: One episode features squabbling conjoined twin brothers, who shared a single body and each controlled one arm and leg, essentially a two-headed man. The two of them had wildly different personalities (a laid back American and an uptight Brit), and almost nobody, including the brothers themselves seemed to be even aware that they shared a body; for instance, one woman claimed to have dated one head for months without meeting the other, and one head claimed to be two years younger than the other.
-   _The Super 6_ has a three-headed character(s) named the Matzoriley brothers. Unfortunate ethnic stereotypes in triplicate, alleviated mildly by the fact they keep trying to beat up one another. The Matzorileys were originally the antagonists in the first Inspector cartoon, "The Great DeGaulle Stone Affair."
-   _Tak and the Power of Juju_: The Bulldrafish. Each head has its own personality: the bull head is aggressive, the dragon head is sweet, and the fish head is obnoxious.
-   _Toxic Crusaders_: Headbanger is a mutated freak with two heads who each control their side of the body. One head belongs to Dr. Bender, a hideous Mad Scientist; the other belongs to Fender, an oafish Surfer Dude delivery boy. The body itself is kinda lopsided since the surfer's half of the body is rippling with muscle, whereas the scientist's is shriveled and emaciated.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward_: Triple Threat is a wrestler/thief with three different heads. One of them is violent, the other is calculating, and the third is a Cloudcuckoolander.
-   _Tenko and the Guardians of the Magic_: The villains Janna and Jason can perform a Fusion Dance into a two-headed dragon, with each of them in control of one head.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures_: In the episode "Strange tales of weird science" in the third segment "Duck in the Muck" in which Plucky is under the hero name Toxic Revenger and uses Toxic waste on Monty as revenge for him creating pollution,. This causes Monty to grow a second head and transform . At the end of the segment Plucky grows a second head.
    
    **Plucky second head:**Don't look now pal but you just became a duo.
    

-   _Transformers_:
    -   _Transformers: Animated_: Blitzwing has one head with three faces, though only one face is ever visible at a time. Each head stands for one of his three personalities, and they occasionally argue with each other.
    -   _Transformers: Energon_: Alpha Q has _four_ faces. It's implied that he wasn't always so schizoid, but developed the multiple personalities out of loneliness when he was trapped inside Unicron. His mask is always closed when his fifth personality, considered his "true face" despite no physical face representing it (the inner sphere turns 360° more than once; there _isn't_ a fifth face), speaks. Alpha Q's real self speaks in the Voice of the Legion — Alpha Q is eventually revealed as the combined consciousness of everyone lost in his planet's destruction.
    -   _Transformers: War for Cybertron Trilogy_ features Quintessons with five faces, each of which has its own individual personality, and they must all agree to reach consensus to finally partake an action. However, one face of one Quintesson has had enough with his other faces disagreeing with him, which culminates in him cutting off his four other faces, leaving only one remaining in charge.
    -   _The Transformers_: In season 3, one of the patients on the therapy planet Torkulon has three heads... who keeps saying "I have no head... I have no head... I have no head..." Definitely a head-case.
    -   Doublecross and Sinnertwin, who transform into twin-headed dragons, each suffer from split personalities, a condition which is (naturally) exacerbated in their beast modes. Sinnertwin even has two voice actors. Though technically, they're all three-headed. Sadly, we don't get a third VA for the robot mode head. Just as well, because Sinnertriplet doesn't make nearly as cool a name.
    -   _Beast Wars Neo_: Downplayed with the three-headed Magmatron — one is in the usual spot, and he's got one on each shoulder. He can separate into three autonomous units, but he is definitely one person.

-   _Transformers: Cyberverse_: The conjoined Autobot twins Rack'n'Ruin come off as this. Another two-headed Cybertronian named Doublecrosser is introduced in the post-series movie _The Immobilizers_, whose heads aren't above blaming one another when their actions incite the ire of their fellow Mercenaries.

-   _Underdog_: One short has Underdog facing a two-headed dragon that stops to shake hands with itself, while chanting "Teamwork, teamwork, that's what counts!"
-   _The Venture Bros._: Red Mantle and Dragoon are a recently-joined pair (forced when Dragoon was dying after a tussle with Phantom Limb) who argue constantly over which of them is actually in charge. By the show's time, Dragoon has taken over the right side.
-   _Viva Piñata_: Ted and Tina Twingersnap are the two heads of a two-headed snake, one on each end. They have distinct genders and consider each other siblings.
-   _Wander over Yonder_: In "The Legend", one of the kids Wander and Sylvia rescue from Lord Dominator's Mecha-Mooks is a pair of conjoined Polar Opposite Twins, the scrappy Jamie and the Lovable Coward Hank.
    
    **Jamie:** I'll scramble their circuits!  
    **Hank:** I'm too young for half of me to die!
    
-   _What It's Like Being Alone_: Byron and Beasley are blue-skinned conjoined twins. The former is constantly picking on the latter.

    Real Life 

-   Truth in Television with dicephalic conjoined twins Abigail and Brittany Hensel, who share one body and so present the appearance of one two-headed person. Only three prior sets of dicephalic twins living to adulthood have been recorded in all human history. However, unlike the Hollywood version, each only has control and feeling of her own half of their combined body. Unlike the various "bickering heads" (including the reptiles below), though, they seem to be very well-coordinated and aren't known to argue excessively. When getting their driver's license, they had to take the test twice. They may be conjoined but they are two individuals, if not exactly separate, people. It does make one wonder what would have happened if only one had passed the test.
-   A similar case in conjoined twins Carmen and Lupita Andrade. While Carmen is something of a Genki Girl, her twin sister is quieter and more reserved.
-   16th Century French anatomist and barber surgeon described two "monsters" (an archaic medical term used to refer to children with deformities) which had this trait: a pair adult women, and a pair of infant boys.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In particular, he notes that the women ate, drank, slept, and spoke independently, and they had to beg door-to-door for a living, before eventually being banished to Bavaria despite being tolerated by their community.
-   Octopuses function similarly to this trope; each of an octopus' eight arms has its own cluster of neurons that essentially serves as a simple brain. Each arm has enough "intelligence" to perform simple tasks that are "assigned" to it via the octopus' main brain, though doesn't have enough independent thought to play this trope straight.
-   Reptiles, due to their biology, are more likely to develop two heads on one body than most other animals (though it's still extremely unlikely). They don't move very well, will fight each other for food, and the carnivores (such as snakes) will actually try to eat each other.
-   A flatworm has managed to grow a second head after a radiating trip to space.
