Give us a kiss!

_"I **hate** these aliens, they're **so scary!** Luckily, I **can't see them!** Something's **covering my eyes** but I can't quite **figure out** what **it is!**"_

_"Ewww! Talk about **sucking face!**"_

The Face Hugger, as the name implies, is a creature that preys on other species, usually humans, by attaching itself to their face. What it does to you from there depends on the creature and how it operates. Some take over your body or mind in some fashion. Some drain you of blood or Life Energy. Some eat your brains. Some transform you in horrific fashion. And some will give you a Face Full of Alien Wing-Wong.

In pretty much every case, this is Nightmare Fuel owing to our Primal Fear of Orifice Invasion. See also Personal Space Invader. A creature that does this is frequently the larval form of a Xenomorph Xerox.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Played with in an _Azumanga Daioh_ comic. After getting her hand bitten by Kamineko(again), Sasaki flails around and ends up hitting Kagura in the face with the cat. Kamineko latches onto Kagura's face and tries smiling innocently at Sasaki before getting tossed away by an annoyed Kagura.

    Comic Books 

-   The mind-control starfish of Starro the Conqueror in _Justice League of America_.

    Fan Works 

-   In the Slash Fic parody _ALIEN!!!_, the facehugger is a lesbian cyborg who wraps her legs around the heroine's face.

    Films — Animation 

-   _G.I. Joe: The Movie_: Pythona and Nemesis Enforcer use something like this. The former on a few Crimson Guards, and the latter on Sgt. Slaughter when rescuing Falcon from Serpentor while infiltrating the Terror Drome during an "extra rough training exercise".
-   _Wreck-It Ralph_: Ralph finds his medal but accidentally hatches a Cy-Bug egg by stepping on it and the baby bug attacks Ralph by the face, sending him on an escape shuttle that blasts them to Sugar Rush.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Trope Namer and Trope Maker (if not _Ur-Example_) is the crab-like impregnator from the _Alien_ films — shown in the picture above from the first film. Many later examples are homages.
-   _Octopussy_: The title character keeps a poisonous blue-ring octopus in an aquarium. When James Bond smashes an assassin head-first into the aquarium, the octopus — instead of inflicting a lethal bite and then fleeing like any normal octopus — latches onto the screaming assassin's face and stays there.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffyverse_: The giant spiders contained in the Box of Gavrok from _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ attach themselves to people's faces before killing them. The critters in "Bad Eggs" and "As You Were" are also reminiscent of face huggers, as are those on the _Angel_ episodes "Soul Purpose" and "A Hole in the World".
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The spider creatures from "Full Circle" have more than a hint of the _Alien_ facehugger about them.
    -   The dreamcrabs in "Last Christmas" attach themselves to their victims' faces and slowly eat their brains, while trapping them in dreams. One of the crew even lampshades the situation as being right out of _Alien_, which is justified with The Reveal that one of them was actually watching the movie when the dreamcrabs put them into the dream.
        
        **The Doctor:** There's a horror movie called _Alien_? That's really offensive. No wonder everyone keeps invading you.
        
    -   In "Revolution of the Daleks", Jack Harkness is planting explosives to blow up a building full of cloned Dalek mutants, when one of them crawls from its tank and leaps onto his face. Fortunately, he's able to wrench it off.
-   _The Mandalorian_: Played for Laughs when the Child is tucking into a bowl of chowder, whereupon a small squid-like creature bursts from the bowl and latches onto his face.
    
    **Mando:** _\[sternly\]_ Don't play with your food. _\[pokes the squid with his knife, and the squid falls back into the bowl\]_
    
-   _Supergirl (2015)_: Supergirl is overpowered by a many-tentacled "Black Mercy" which attaches itself to her and violates her body _and_ mind, feeding a hallucinogen into her bloodstream which causes her to have a delusion that she is still with her family on Krypton whilst her friends try to save her in the real world.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Face Sucker in _Munchkin_.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Facebiter squigs bite... faces. The orks naturally find this hilarious, and often get in contests to see which will bite the other's face off first. The _actual_ Xenomorph Xeroxes use an ovipositor to perform the Orifice Invasion instead.
    -   The Tyranids have a variant species of Ripper called a Cortex Leech. They leap onto a person's face then use a variety of pointed tendrils to penetrate the mouths, eyes, nose, ears, or any other available orifice and drive them into the brain, where they can then hijack the motor functions and turn them into drooling thralls to the Hive Mind.
    -   The Catachan Face Eater. On a planet with the ultimate reputation for Everything Trying to Kill You, this creature is probably the most feared predator.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_:
    -   The Krana utilized by the Bohrok combine this with Puppeteer Parasite: though normally they exist as a "driver" of sorts to the mechanical Bohrok, they can also latch onto a person's face and take control of their body.
    -   The Toa Inika possessed a benevolent version of these - unlike normal Toa, their Kanohi masks were organic, living creatures. Unlike the very similar Krana, however, their only interest was helping the Toa, mainly by teaching them how to properly use their powers. Although, their primary method of doing so was giving them nasty headaches whenever they did something wrong.
    -   There's also The Skull Spiders from the 2015 reboot.

    Video Games 

-   _Alien vs. Predator (Capcom)_: Face Huggers will attempt to grab on and drain health away. Smash the buttons to get them off.
-   The Bone Leeches of _Blood II: The Chosen_ play with this in a way. They cover up your view but actually burrow into your chest using their tail.
-   _Chaos Break_ have the lowest-level infected species, which resembles the classic facehugger, having a spider-like frontal body with a long tail and attacking by leaping and clinging on the player. Though it doesn't have acid for blood and can be stomped to death after shooting it a few times.
-   The Lifters and Diamond Claws from the _Descent_ series behave similarly. While most of the other robots shoot at you, these enemies ram into your ship and inflict damage with their reinforced claws. The E-Bandits use a similar point-blank attack, only they drain your ship's energy instead of your shields.
-   _Don't Starve_: The Slurpers. They take up the head slot of the character's inventory, dropping whatever is there. When attached, they provide light and slowly drain the character's hunger.
-   _Duke Nukem 3D_: The Protozoid Slimer, who provides Interface Screw while jumping at Duke's face.
-   Headcrabs from the _Half-Life_ saga.
-   _Metroids_, although more often than not they latch onto the whole head.
-   _Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy_: The Aura Beasts come of nowhere and wrap around Nick's face. Oh, and the only way to see them coming is using the psi draining Aura Vision.
-   _Space Quest_:
    -   In _Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon_, at Fester Blatz's World O' Wonders on Phleebhut, the postcard for Achoron shows a face hugger hugging somebody's face.
    -   In _Space Quest V: The Next Mutation_, Spike, the acid-squirting face hugger, later dubbed Spikette, spawns lots of little face huggers. The manual shows the design team being inspired by an _Alien_ face hugger model.
    -   In _Space Quest VI: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier_, when examining the ship in shuttle bay, the narrator claims the ship is "probably carrying a half-dozen miniature face-hugging saliva-dripping face-eating exo-skeletal alien piranha things."
-   Brainsuckers from _X-COM: Apocalypse_, which are used as ammunition by certain aliens in addition to appearing on their own. Replacing a person's brain is their entire purpose; They don't even have a digestive system.

    Web Animation 

-   _Sonic for Hire_: In Season 5, Sonic and Tails are sent by General Pepper to terminate aliens. Tails is attacked by multiple face huggers, then finds ALF hatching the eggs before killing him.

    Webcomics 

    Western Animation 

-   _Rick and Morty_:
    -   The primary focus of "Promortyus", and spoofed with The Glorzo. It's discussed how they don't have much technological development for a sapient species because they blindly kill their hosts laying eggs. Summer convinces them to hold off on doing that so they can advance their technology, reverse engineering that of all the ships which crashland onto their asteroid.
    -   In an advertisement for _Alien: Covenant_, Rick and Morty head to a space cruiser after intercepting a distress call. Moments after arriving, Rick is attacked by a face-hugger that immediately dies as a result of the drugs and alcohol Rick had in his stomach.

    Real Life 

-   Penicillidia are a wingless fly that latches onto a bat's faces to drink their blood, and never let go except to lay a single larvae on the cave walls.
