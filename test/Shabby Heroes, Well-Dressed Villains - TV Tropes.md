Among the many ways of visually distinguishing heroes and villains, there has always been a quick technique: making use of the varying quality of clothes.

Countless stories depict heroes wearing casual clothes or serving as living embodiments of the Rummage Sale Reject, if not outright decked out in rags, while the villains dress as stylish and/or high-end as they come. There are many ways to display this trope: The Rebel Leader may wear a patchwork cloak while the Evil Overlord wears a jewel-encrusted cape, or the Working-Class Hero may wear a pair of overalls every day while the Corrupt Corporate Executive has a closet full of suits. No matter what, the general class difference that fuels this trope is always present - the usual explanation is that heroes are a ragtag band of La Résistance against the wealthy, villainous establishment, whether the funding comes from The Empire, a MegaCorp or something else. Another is that our heroes come from a lower-class background (if not outright social pariahs/criminals) while the villains are high-class and wealthy (if not outright Aristocrats Are Evil). In short, our heroes are underdogs and their choice of clothing shows it.

This can overlap with Rummage Sale Reject, Limited Wardrobe, Homeless Hero, Misfit Lab Rat, Man of Wealth and Taste, Wicked Cultured, and/or Slobs Versus Snobs.

Can also overlap with Dark Is Not Evil and Light Is Not Good when the shabby hero invoke a dark and low-class style to contrast with the villain's more high-class light theme

A Sub-Trope of Dress-Coded for Your Convenience and Sliding Scale of Shiny Versus Gritty.

Compare Polite Villains, Rude Heroes, Privileged Rival, Ugly Hero, Good-Looking Villain, Putting on the Reich. Contrast Sensible Heroes, Skimpy Villains, which is usually used for females, not males like this trope.

Truth in Television for La Résistance fighters, who often wear a wide range of civilian clothes suitable for the environment and combat setting. To reduce Friendly Fire accidents, some resistance fighters may wear a colored armband or other insignia.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Guts and Griffith from _Berserk_ with the former wearing low-classed armor and clothing in contrast to Griffith's more regal armor and clothing.
-   Although not really bad-looking, _Dragon Ball Z_ uses Son Goku's traditional gi to contrast Vegeta's high-tech and pristine armor. When Vegeta cements his Heel–Face Turn, he switches to casual clothing.
-   _Castle in the Sky_: Pazu wears work clothes and Sheeta wears a plain dress, contrasting the fine maroon suit lead by the Big Bad Muska.
-   _Death Note_: Light's wardrobe consists mainly of dress wear and school uniforms, while L's typical attire is a plain white shirt and jeans, and rarely wearing shoes. Lampshaded during the entrance ceremony at Light's new college.
-   Played with in _Ichi the Killer_. The titular character has a compulsion to kill people, but saves it for the underworld, and so alternates between wearing street clothes or full-body armor. The antagonist Kakihara is a violent sadomasochist who always wears a suit and tie.
-   In _Moriarty the Patriot_, William Moriarty is rarely seen out of a full three-piece suit and top hat with a cane, and when he is, it's usually the jacket is missing. Meanwhile, Sherlock Holmes cannot even remember how to tie a necktie since he hasn't properly worn one since his university graduation.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Boys_ have the titular characters wear civilian clothes and longcoats while the supes wear tailored, PR-focused costumes (which can still come off as gaudy to the average leader).

    Films — Animation 

-   _Aladdin_: Aladdin wears pauper's clothes, complete with a patch on his pants, while Jafar dresses in finery befitting a Royal Vizier.
-   _All Dogs Go to Heaven_: Anne-Marie's dress is full of patches, while Carface's clothes are well suited to his casino owner's status.

-   In _Coco_, Héctor's clothes are tattered and torn, and he wears a flaking straw hat, while Ernesto de la Cruz wears a sparkling mariachi suit complete with a silver ribbon bowtie.
-   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Disney)_: Quasimodo wears a simple tunic and tights, while Claude Frollo dons an ornamental robe and hat. This is explained by Quasimodo living a sheltered life away from society, while Frollo is a public figure.
-   _The Iron Giant_: Hogarth wears typical attire for a 9-year-old in the '50s. Kent Mansley works for the government. And all that that implies.

-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End_: The Anti-Hero pirates wear motley rags and coats while the sailors of the Royal Navy wear fresh and redesigned uniforms.
-   _The Dark Knight_ plays with this. Batman wears a suit of high-tech armor to contrast the filthiness and poor hygiene of the Joker, which would make this an inversion. However, it's revealed later that the Joker had all of his clothing custom-made so that no labels could be traced to him, and he emphasizes that they were not cheap.
-   _Star Wars_: As a general rule, Rebels dress casually, while members of the Galactic Empire are clad in either military uniforms or heavy armor (the page image is from _Rogue One_, where heroine Jyn Erso wears simple fatigues while villainous Krennic even adds a stylish cape to his uniform). There are exceptions; royal characters affiliated to the Republic/Rebellion, like Princess Leia or Queen Amidala, will wear appropriately opulent costumes (although both are more often seen in civilian clothes), and Sith Lords wear simple black robes not that dissimilar to the monastic robes of the Jedi.
-   _Super Mario Bros. (1993)_: King Koopa wears a scaly black suit, Lena wears many different fancy dresses, and the Goombas are dressed in longcoats, while Mario and Luigi dress in their usual clothes before switching to red/blue and green/blue work overalls found in a maintenance locker.

    Literature 

-   _Gods and Warriors_: The main antagonists are the members of the House of Koronos, a powerful warrior clan that can afford fineries and bronze armor. The main heroes are Hylas, an Outsider who's used to living in squalor and half-decent clothing, and Pirra, the daughter of Keftiu's High Priestess who frequently runs away and happily disregards her fineries in the real world which represents freedom for her.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Firefly_: While the series operates on a Grey-and-Gray Morality, the "good guys" are the ragtag crew of _Serenity_, whose style is mostly a combination of western and old military fatigues. The antagonists tend to be more clean-cut: e.g. the militaristic/bureaucratic Alliance and the wealthy crime boss Niska.
    -   Also seen more broadly in the relative aesthetics of the poor, frontier Rim worlds and wealthy, Alliance-controlled Core worlds. There are good and bad people throughout the 'Verse, but the inhabitants of the Rim are generally more sympathetic as the underdogs.
-   _Game of Thrones_: The soldiers of House Stark wear furs and utilitarian plate armor. The men of House Lannister are very partial to enforcing Bling of War.
-   _Oz_ has something of an inversion. The prisoners often wear dull and shabby Institutional Apparel or pieces of casual clothing if they're lucky, while the prison staff wear suits or clean jet-black uniforms. Although no one is without Jerkass moments, the latter group are still depicted more sympathetically than the former.
-   _Supernatural_: Heroes Sam and Dean Winchester wear jeans, t-shirts, and flannels. Over the course of the series, they have faced several well-dressed villains.
    -   Crowley is the most prominent, and he's always in a meticulously tailored suit. He also mocks the Winchesters' love of flannel, a lot.
    -   In the Bad Future, Dean meets Villain in a White Suit Lucifer himself, who also happens to be wearing Sam Winchester as his vessel, much to his brother's horror.
    -   In Season 7, the season's Big Bad is Dick Roman, a Leviathan/corporate executive who is always in a slick suit.

    Other 

-   Much of this is based on photographs from WWII. The Nazis and Fascists were heavily focused on aesthetics, deliberately Putting on the Reich as a way to inspire the locals and intimidate their enemies. The SS were intimidating and aristocratic from the jump, and Nazi officers _always_ dressed to impress. Meanwhile, US forces were wearing mass produced and somewhat ill-fitting garb (as the US was somewhat less prepared to enter the war than Germany had been), and thus they tended to wear... pants, bloused shirts, greasy hats. This was amplified by the US idealization of the Working-Class Hero, in contrast to the German love of the Prussian aristocracy. All in all, when a Nazi surrendered to a US commander, you could be forgiven for thinking it was the other way around, as the Nazi would be immaculate and the American would look like he just rolled out of a lunch truck.
