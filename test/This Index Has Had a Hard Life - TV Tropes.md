"_It's a hard-knock life for us!_"

An index about characters who have had a hard life, the things that happened to them, and how such things have affected and continue to affect them.

See also Madness Tropes — a tragic past _can_ lead to mental disorder, but not all characters who experience tragedy go mad, and not all madness is the result of a tragic past. The former goes here, but the latter does not.

May be overlapped with the Sympathetic Index.
