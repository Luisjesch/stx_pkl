**Angela**: God, you people work just like the mob! There’s no difference!  
**FBI Agent**: Oh, there’s a big difference, Mrs. de Marco. The mob is run by murdering, thieving, lying, cheating psychopaths. We work for the President of the United States.

An agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or one of its fictional counterparts. The FBI is the investigative branch of the United States of America's Department of Justice. See American Law Enforcement for information about the agency. This is about the agents in fiction.

From the late 1920s through the 1950s; "G-Men" (Government Men) were seen in fiction as incorruptible forces for law and order and American values, with very rare exceptions. However, J. Edgar Hoover's suspicion of the politics and motivations of prominent civil rights activists, and growing paranoia about the social changes in America, caused the FBI's activities to become increasingly out of step with the times (serious legal violations occurred in spying on activists). Mishandled cases and other scandals, some decades old, were talked about more publicly. After Hoover died in 1972, a law previously passed to limit the tenure of FBI directors came into effect. Scurrilous rumors of J. Edgar's sexual peccadillos or connection to organized crime figures got a lot more play once he couldn't sic his agents on those reporting them.

Media portrayals of the FBI since then have generally depicted a flawed but usually well-meaning organization, some of whose agents may have friction with other law enforcement agencies. More rarely, some may be corrupt or evil. Works of fiction will often use a No Celebrities Were Harmed version of the FBI and Hoover. They have a better public image than the CIA, of course, Hoover's machinations notwithstanding.

FBI agents during the majority of the Hoover period were Always Male (there had been female agents before he took office, but he felt that women were unsuited for the work) and agents of color were rare to non-existent, which made working in certain communities, especially infiltration of them, difficult. Indeed, during the Hoover years the FBI rarely had its agents infiltrate the organizations they investigated, preferring to recruit paid informants who were already on the inside. Special agents must have a 4-year ("bachelor's") college degree, with a preference given to Law and Accounting.

Sometimes overlaps with The Men in Black. If the FBI isn't the only law enforcement agency involved, there may be Jurisdiction Friction. For agents of other government agencies without their own entry, including fictional ones, see Government Agency of Fiction.

## Works that feature the FBI or its agents include:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Baccano!_'s Victor Talbot is part of the FBI, head of a special division dealing with immortal affairs.
-   _Case Closed_: The FBI is one of the major forces that investigate the Black Organization. The most prominent agents are Shuichi Akai, Jodie Starling, Andre Camel and James Black. Akai is notably one of the few characters to be on par with Shinichi himself.
-   Appears in _Death Note_, where they are trying to find Kira. The FBI were brought in because the Japanese police were having no luck in tracking Kira down, plus L correctly susses that Kira was related to one of the investigating officers and thus the investigation itself may have been compromised (which it was, since Light was spying on his dad, the leader of said investigation). Besides that, L was hired by the United Nations because Kira was killing on a global scale and the only reason the Japanese were assigned to the case was that L just figured out that Kira was based in Japan.
-   Asuna Kisaki from _Occultic;Nine_ is a high school student and an FBI agent.

    Comic Books 

-   Flashbacks to her training in _Batwoman: Elegy_ show Kate Kane taking part in (and presumably completing) the FBI's New Agent Training program.
-   The second Mister America, Trey Thompson, was an FBI agent. After his murder, his partner, Agent Jeffrey Graves, took up the mantle.

    Films 

-   Tsui Hark plays a minor character in _Aces Go Places 2_ who pretends to be an FBI agent, and he loves to claim that a siren soon to be heard belongs to the police. People tend to believe him—that is, until it turns out that the siren actually belongs to the men in white who come to take him back to the asylum he keeps breaking out of. Hilarious in Hindsight because Tsui Hark directed _Aces Go Places 3_.
-   _Alto_: Two of them, a man and woman, are investigating the Mafia family in the film, but they never get anywhere.
-   _The Boondock Saints_: Willem Dafoe plays the FBI agent investigating the titular vigilantes.
-   _Brooklyn Tide_: Special Agent Jonathan Corbin and Agent Samantha Vera are sent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the death of another Federal Agent, as well as the disappearance of a supposed cyber weapon.
-   _Catch Me If You Can_ features Tom Hanks as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, who spends the movie trying to track down and arrest serial imposter Frank Abegnale, Jr.
-   _Die Hard_. Two FBI agents take over the law enforcement response to the takeover and, as Al Powell says, "They've got the universal terrorist playbook and they're running it step by step." This plays right into the hands of Hans Gruber, who takes advantage of their tactics to break into the vault. The agents then try to slaughter the terrorists while risking the hostages' lives and get blown up by a terrorist trap.
-   _Donnie Brasco_ is based on the Real Life infiltration of The Mafia by FBI agent Joe Pistone, who posed as the titular wannabe Italian mafioso seeking information about the mob's inner workings. Prior to this, the FBI relied on mob informants to get leads, but the intel was generally unreliable as the FBI knew that the informants could be providing them with hearsay or false info.
-   _Dog Day Afternoon_. FBI Agent Sheldon is portrayed as being tough, unflappable and in charge, and the bank robber Sonny clearly respects him.
-   Sean Archer, The Hero of _Face/Off_, is an FBI agent who is looking to get revenge on a notorious terrorist named Castor Troy, who was responsible for the death of his son years ago. The two eventually switch faces when Castor and his brother Pollux refuse to give the location of the bomb.
-   _The FBI Story_, a 1959 movie starring James Stewart that depicts the history of the organisation from the mid 20's until the late 50's through the life of FBI Agent Chip Hardesty. As Hoover had approval over every shot and had a pair of special agents stick with the director during filming the movie shows the FBI in a rather idealised light.
-   The James Cagney movie _G Men_, was released in 1935, and was the first movie about the renamed FBI.
-   _Home Alone 3_: Christopher Curry plays FBI Agent Stuckey, who is on the trail of four internationally wanted spies working for a North Korean terrorist organization who stole a top-secret missile cloaking microchip from a defense department contractor.

-   _J. Edgar_, the biopic of J. Edgar Hoover, naturally. Portrayal of Hoover's influence on the kind of people who are accepted into the F.B.I. over the years is shown.
-   In _Judas Kiss_, Emma Thompson plays FBI Agent Sadie Hawkins, the lead agent in charge of investigating the abduction of tech entrepreneur Ben Dyson.

-   The Marvel Cinematic Universe features Randall Park as Jimmy Woo, a former SHIELD agent who joined the FBI. He first debuts in _Ant-Man and the Wasp_ where he assigned to oversee Scott Lang's house arrest in the aftermath of Scott's actions in _Captain America: Civil War_. He then appears in _WandaVision_, where the whole discovery that Wanda Maximoff has encompassed Westview in a sitcom reality happens because a witness in one of Jimmy's cases happened to be in Westview when she created the Hex. He spends most of the show acting as a voice of reason, collaborating with Darcy Lewis and Monica Rambeau to figure out the truth of what's going on, and ultimately gets to arrest SWORD Director Tyler Hayward for trying to revive Vision for use as a living weapon (in violation of the Sokovia Accords) and trying to kill Wanda to cover up his abuses of power.

-   Will Graham and Clarice Starling of _The Silence of the Lambs_ are both FBI agents.
-   The FBI is an important part of the plot in the Nero Wolfe novel _The Doorbell Rang_. Rex Stout (the author) really hated J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, so the novel is pretty much entirely a Take That! against them.
-   The FBI are all over the place in Tom Clancy's _Jack Ryan_ novels. Several FBI agents are major characters, including one who saves the life of Ryan's daughter during a terrorist attack in _Executive Orders_.

It is up to US Marshal Raylan Givens to clean up the mess the FBI has created.

-   The final season of _Charmed_ featured FBI Agent Murphy.
-   The FBI is highly prominent in the seventh season of _24_, at least the Washington D.C. branch. Agents include Love Interest Renee Walker and her boss Larry Moss.

-   _Leverage_ has FBI Special Agents Taggart and McSweeten as recurring characters. They believe that Parker and Hardison are also FBI agents specializing in secret undercover assignments and thus more than willing to help them out. In exchange they get all the credit for catching the bad guys at the end of an episode. They're portrayed as well-meaning but incompetent; it's a Running Gag that the scams in all their episodes have the side effect of giving them a gift-wrapped high-profile arrest (in one case literally — Parker tapes a bow on the guy before locking him in McSweeten's trunk).

-   _White Collar_: All but two major characters are based in the White-Collar Crime division of the FBI's New York office.
-   _Criminal Minds_
    -   _Criminal Minds_: The main characters are Special Agents from the FBI Behavorial Analysis Unit.
    -   Its spinoff, _Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior_, also involves characters from the FBI, but with a slight twist- they're a rogue unit that operates covertly as a "quick response" unit, answering directly to the Director of the FBI.
-   In _Justified_ the US Marshals are shown to be getting along fine with the FBI until season 3 when a serious case of Jurisdiction Friction occurs when Raylan interferes in their investigation into the Theo Tonin mob family. The FBI agent in charge goes as far as trying to have Raylan arrested on corruption charges. Season 4 reveals that the FBI agent was actually working for Theo Tonin all along.
-   Season 4 of _Boardwalk Empire_ introduces the Bureau of Investigation (the "Federal" part would be added a decade later) with J. Edgar Hoover just beginning his tenure as director. It takes over investigations of bootleggers from the corrupt Bureau of Internal Revenue and quickly poses a significant threat to Nucky Thompson and the other gangsters. However, Hoover decides to instead refocus the BoI's resources into investigating and prosecuting civil rights advocates and prominent socialists since he sees them as a bigger threat to America.

-   _Blindspot_ focuses on an FBI team led by Special Agent Kurt Weller, who is brought in on the case of a woman with Identity Amnesia known as Jane Doe; for unknown reasons, his name has been tattooed on her back. As the team tries to solve the mystery of her identity, they realize that her other tattoos provide clues to terrorist plots and other such cases.
-   On _Graceland_ the titular mansion serves as home to agents from three different agencies who work and liaise together, (the agencies in question being the Drug Enforcement Agency, Customs, and the FBI) but the FBI absolutely dominate the roster, with four of the six agents being FBI, including the ones who get the most focus.
-   _The Defenders (2017)_: The FBI and DHS take involvement in the NYPD investigation of the Hand after Jessica Jones uncovers explosives that John Raymond had stolen from the Hand for blowing up Midland Circle.
-   _The Punisher (2017)_: Dinah Madani and Sam Stein are from the Department of Homeland Security, but they fill this trope in spirit.

-   _Daredevil (2015)_: In season 3, Wilson Fisk manipulates his way out of prison by turning informant for the FBI on an Albanian gang. After paying Jasper Evans to shank him and make it seem like he's being targeted for snitching, Fisk gets the FBI to move him to a Manhattan penthouse that he's bought through a series of shell companies. He's able to pull this all off because he's bribed/manipulated/blackmail almost every agent on the detail into working for him. This allows him to use the FBI agents as his glorified enforcers in a new racket where he strongarms other major gangs into paying him a protection tax, as well as harass and hound his enemies who trying to investigate him. Three of the agents in particular become major pawns in Fisk's schemes during the season:
    -   The first is Rahul "Ray" Nadeem, a married family man and field agent who has been driven into debt to pay for his sister-in-law's cancer treatments due to Fisk cutting off her insurance, to make him desperate enough for this deal to work. Nadeem's pride and reluctance to see how predatory Fisk is mean that Fisk is able to easily manipulate him into going after Nelson & Murdock for ostensibly doing Fisk's dirty work. While he eventually realizes he's been played after Jasper Evans is killed in Dex's attack on the _Bulletin_, it's too late for him to back out and he ends up being blackmailed by Hattley into working for Fisk, goes along as Fisk rounds up other gangsters to extort into paying him a protection tax, and serves as Dex's driver when Fisk hires Dex to kill Karen as revenge for her murder of James Wesley. A conversation with Sister Maggie after Dex's failed attack on the church gets Nadeem to grow a spine and stand up to Dex, by arranging with Foggy and Brett Mahoney for Karen to be "apprehended" by the NYPD to get her away from him. Fisk attempts to kill him and his family right away, but Matt and Foggy rescue him and convince him to testify before a grand jury convened by Blake Tower. Fisk foils their efforts by intimidating the grand jury. Nadeem flees back home and makes a video confession to everything he's witnessed, which, after he's murdered by Dex on Vanessa's orders, ends up being what puts Fisk back behind bars thanks to a loophole in the heresy rules.
    -   The second is Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter. A SWAT sharpshooter, he saves Fisk from an assassination attempt by the Albanians. Fisk takes interest in his amazing shooting skills, and uses a string of manipulations to make him into Fisk's main assassin. For Dex's first assignment, Fisk puts him in a Daredevil costume and has him attack the _Bulletin_ to kill Karen's coworkers as well as Jasper Evans, so that Evans can't tell the media about being paid to shank Fisk. Later, upon learning from Karen that she killed James Wesley, Fisk tasks Dex with killing her, which he gladly obliges (with a blackmailed Nadeem as his getaway driver). Matt foils this attempt, but Father Lantom is killed in the process. Dex later is the one sent to kill Nadeem on Vanessa's orders after the failed grand jury, and is taken down when Matt manipulates him into turning against Fisk by revealing that Fisk killed Julie, a woman Dex has a crush on. In the subsequent three-way between Matt, Fisk, and Dex, Dex ends up being crippled when Fisk breaks his back.
    -   Tammy Hattley is the Special Agent in Charge on the detail. Fisk has blackmailed her into working for him by killing one of her kids in a "hit and run" and threatening the life of her daughter. It's also strongly implied that Hattley had a role in Fisk's attempted jailbreak from custody in the season 1 finale, while he is being transported to jail after Nelson & Murdock get Detective Carl Hoffman to testify that Fisk blackmailed him into killing his own partner Christian Blake. Fisk is arrested and put into the back of armored truck guarded by an FBI SWAT team. Unfortunately, it turns out that one of the FBI agents in the truck is on Fisk's payroll, and kills the other agents in the truck when the convoy is ambushed by mercenaries working for Fisk, tipped off by inside information that most likely came from Hattley.
-   In Mindhunter Holden and Tench are Special Agents who begin interviewing convicted serial killers to learn more about how they think.
-   _Without a Trace_ features the fictional Missing Persons Squad.

I'm out on the highway and I'm drivin' down the road and I run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you know. I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether they should stick with the car or follow me_.
