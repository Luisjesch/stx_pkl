Uh... what's death?

There's simple ignorance, when you just didn't know something. There's catching the Idiot Ball, which is a momentary lapse. There's fear and panic in a chaotic situation. All those situations are understandable reasons for making poor decisions. So far, we're at What an Idiot!

Then there's _these_ guys. People who are so stupid that they simply do not _deserve_ to survive.

Walking down the alley alone to tell his friend about the Serial Killer in town. Telling everybody in earshot he has vital evidence that he'll be taking to the authorities very shortly. Hovering in a known dangerous area without backup. Not telling the rest of the party about the upcoming trap laid out for them. Accepting food and drink from the weird stranger who lives in the seemingly abandoned house in the middle of nowhere and keeps asking odd questions in a creepy monotone voice, such as if they came to the house alone and if anybody knows where they are (and, of course, answering "yes" and "no" to these questions). Bullying a Dragon, Mugging the Monster, or whatever. Touching buttons when told not to. Juggling Loaded Guns. Throwing the pin and holding onto the grenade. Plugging in electric appliances right next to their full bath. Refusing to believe his glory days are behind him. Blackmailing someone about murder. Not only possessing Genre Blindness, but putting Zaphod Beeblebrox's Peril-Sensitive Sunglasses on over it. Even close friends have to facepalm upon hearing of his or her exploits. Who Would Be Stupid Enough? These people, that's who!

This trope is, surprisingly,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Truth in Television, as many people can attest to, although we won't.

Compare Artificial Stupidity, the video game equivalent of this which is a result of AI rather than the script being against them. Contrast Death by Pragmatism and Let's Get Dangerous!. Not to be confused with Evilutionary Biologist or The Social Darwinist, although they generally consider it a Moral Event Horizon to not kill the dumb. Also not to be confused with Driven to Suicide, which is the intentional, despair\-induced taking of one's life. See also Suicidal Overconfidence, another video game version. Lethally Stupid is when someone's stupidity simply causes havoc, instead of being the cause of their demise. Unless someone reacts to their impending self-inflicted doom with extreme élan, an Undignified Death is pretty much guaranteed.

As this is a Death Trope, **expect unmarked spoilers on the subpages**.

    Advertising 

-   In general, 'players' in mobile game commercials will often be this, especially when the game promises to 'rate' your intelligence or iq. This is obviously to anger the viewer and drive them to downloading the game to show that they can do better.
-   An Audi car commercial involved a party of vampires being incinerated by the bright headlights of the car being advertised. Aside from a few behind cover coming up (possibly because they didn't connect the silence with being something deadly and wanted to see what was happening), the vampire driving the car gets out...and walks into the path of the headlights. He is incinerated.
-   _Claude the Cat_: Defied. Claude's owner often makes foolish mistakes that nearly kill him, but Claude saves him.
-   The "Don't Text While Driving" PSAs invoke this, showing testimonials of families who have lost loved ones who were paying more attention to their texting than the road.
-   In this Dr. Pepper commercial a man leaves the safety of his boat and dives into the waters of a murky swamp full of hungry alligators late at night. All so he can retrieve a six pack of Dr. Pepper that had fallen overboard.
-   One Fruit Gushers ad campaign depicts people licking various semi-liquid material without any sort of abandon (such as squid ink, for example) and reacting in shock when, no, it _doesn't_ taste like the fruity filling that Fruit Gushers are known for. It's very much Played for Laughs, as most of the time the person's peers look on with looks of bewilderment and/or disgust as they lick the foreign object.
-   One early advertising campaign for _GEICO_ featured something like this; each animated short had a curious man doing something _really_ dumb (like walking up to a cannon and then pressing a button next to it, causing the cannon to fire in his face), at which point the voiceover announcer would say, "We all do dumb things. Paying too much for car insurance doesn't have to be one of them."
-   Another GEICO example: "Horror Movie". Even the Killer does an eye roll and has a look on his face that simply says "Pretty sure I'm doing the genepool a favor at this point...".
    
    **Teen #1:** Let's hide in the attic!

    **Teen #2:** HEAD FOR THE CEMETERY!!!
    
-   The people from the Jack Links Beef Jerky "Messin' with Sasquatch" commercials. Seriously, it's not worth it for just a few laughs.
-   An Australian Metro safety ad presents a three-minute song: "Dumb Ways to Die". It went viral.
-   This Toshiba commercial involves a mass power outage that lasts for a few days. When one young man examines some _obviously_ expired milk in his fridge, he drinks it anyway. Which starts a zombie apocalypse.
-   The 90s era of the _Louie the Fly_ ads for Mortein would have Louie finally avoid being killed by the pesticide. Unfortunately, other bugs weren't so lucky, and would actively ignore Louie's warnings of locations that have used the products, leading to their near-instantaneous deaths.
-   "American Honda Presents DC Comics Supergirl" is a seat belt safety Public Service Announcement wherein Supergirl and her three wards repeatedly run into people who refuse to wear their seat belt because of silly reasons: it is uncomfortable, it is needless, it cramps their style...Invariably, their car crashes and Supergirl's intervention is the only reason why they don't get killed.

    Jokes 

-   A blonde having a medical examination didn't want to take her headphones off. She kept telling the doctor, "If I take them off, I'll die." Her doctor assured her she wouldn't, so she took them off. After a few minutes, she fell over dead. The doctor put the headphones to his ear to listen. It was a recorded instruction, saying, "Breathe in.... breathe out. Breathe in.... breathe out."
-   A brunette, a redhead and a blonde are chased by a Serial Killer (or a police officer). They find a barn and hide in potato sacks. The killer comes and shakes the first bag. The brunette goes, _"Meow! Meow!"_ "Just a dumb cat," says the killer while shaking the second bag. The redhead goes, _"Woof! Woof!"_ "Just a dumb dog," he says, and then shakes the third bag. And the Dumb Blonde goes, _"Potato! Potato!"_
-   Two men were walking through the woods when they found tracks. One said they were deer tracks, the other said they were elk tracks. They were still arguing about it when the train hit them.
-   Another variant of this is three drunken men stumbling around on railroad tracks: the first one complains "these railings are way too low", the second one adds "and these steps are way too far apart" and the third one finishes with "it's OK, judging from the noise, the elevator will be here shortly".
-   Lenny, a deeply religious man, lives by a river. He prays every day, reads the Bible from cover to cover, and does nothing but good works. One day, there's a massive storm. and Lenny hears a news report on the radio that due to the rains a nearby dam up-river is going to burst and flood the town. So Lenny thinks "It'll be okay, the Bible says that God loves me and will watch over me."
    
    Sure enough, the dam bursts, the river breaks its banks, and Lenny's house begins to flood. When he goes up to the next floor, he sees a friend in a rowboat. "Lenny," the friend calls out, "the whole house will be underwater soon. Get in my boat, I'll take us to higher land." "No need," Lenny calls back, "God loves me and will watch over me."
    
    The rains keep coming and the waters keep getting higher, however, eventually forcing Lenny to get onto his roof. A rescue helicopter flies overhead. "You down there," the pilot shouts through the loudspeaker, "the entire town's gonna be completely under water soon. Grab the rope ladder and I'll fly you out." "No need," Lenny yells back, "God loves me and will watch over me."
    
    But the rains keep coming, the waters get higher, and Lenny has nowhere else to go. He drowns. When he gets to the Pearly Gates, Lenny is absolutely pissed, and demands an audience with God. When God shows up, Lenny yells "God, I prayed to you every day. I lived a good life and did nothing but good works, and in the Bible it said you would watch over me if I did. How could you just let me drown like that?"
    
    And God replies "Lenny, I sent you a radio report, a boat, and a helicopter. What the hell else do you want from me?"
    
-   A family in a flood is being rescued from a window on the second floor of their house when one of the crew notices a hat somehow floating upstream. As he watches, the hat turns and floats downstream, then begins floating upstream again.  
    The oldest daughter notices his confusion, then rolls her eyes. "That's Dad. He said he was gonna mow today come hell or high water."

    Fairy Tales 

-   "Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf." Subverted. Ivan repeatedly touches things he's been specifically told not to while trying to steal the Firebird etc., trips magical burglar alarms, and gets sent on one Fetch Quest after another as a consequence (and he keeps getting told that he wouldn't have had to resort to burglary if he'd just _asked_). However, the wolf keeps bailing him out, even after he actually _dies_.
-   Alexander Afanasyev's "Kolobok": The titular little bread bun is about to get away from the female fox after distracting it with a song when the animal asks it to come closer and sing again, claiming to be somewhat deaf. Kolobok obliges the fox and is promptly devoured.
-   In "Morozko", the old woman's daughter finds herself in the middle of a snowed forest, at night, without more company than an ancient but powerful elemental spirit, and she starts insulting him and berating him. Eventually, Father Frost gets really pissed off and freezes her to death.
-   In "The Three Little Men in the Wood", the girl who has been abused by her stepmother becomes the king's wife. Rather than ingratiating herself with her stepdaughter and enjoying the perks of becoming the king's mother-in-law, the stepmother murders and tries to replace the queen with her own birth daughter. Of course, the king discovers their ridiculously transparent hoax before long, and both women are sentenced to death.
-   "The Goose Girl": The King asks the impostor what would be the fair punishment for someone who commits identity theft and generic bastardness on a princess, and she doesn't recognize her own story and suggests to strip the perpetrator naked, put him into a barrel with sharp nails and roll him from the hill into the river. Her wish is granted.
-   "Little Red Riding Hood": The titular character can't tell the difference between a wolf and her grandmother, and ends up eaten. Averted in the original tales, wherein Riding Hood realizes she is talking to a wolf and manages to outwit him.

    Music 

-   The narrator of Billy Joel's "You May Be Right" is self-admittedly Too Dumb to Live:
    
    _I've been stranded in the combat zone_  
    _I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone_  
    _Even rode my motorcycle in the rain_  
    _And you told me not to drive_  
    _But I made it home alive_  
    _So you said that only proves that I'm insane!_
    
-   The victim in Mark Dinning's "Teen Angel", the Glurge-worthy granddaddy of all Teenage Death Songs:
    
    _That fateful night_  
    _The car was stalled_  
    _Upon the railroad tracks_  
    _I pulled you out_  
    _And we were safe_  
    _But you went running back._
    
    -   And what was so damn important that she was willing to throw herself _back_ into the path of an oncoming train?
        
        _They said they found my high school ring_  
        _Clutched in your fingers tight..._
        
    -   The mere fact that she had to be pulled out of a car that had only stalled says something. Was she too dumb to open the door and get out?
-   In Bobby Bare's "Marie Laveau", Handsome Jack goes to the eponymous swamp Voodoo Queen and asks to be made rich in return for agreeing to marry her. She grants his wish, and then he immediately tries to back out of his half of the deal. It doesn't go well for him.
-   "We Threw Gasoline On The Fire And Now We Have Stumps For Arms And No Eyebrows" by NOFX
-   "Dumb Things" by Paul Kelly:
    
    _Saw the knives out, turned my back_  
    _Heard the train coming, stayed right on the track_
    
-   Reinhard Mey (German songwriter and singer) had a song _Die Legende vom Pfeifer_ (there's even an English version called _The Whistler_) about a gunman who always whistles before he shoots. Someone convinces him to go to the sheriff and tell him who he is and that he'd like the bounty that was offered for himself. He gets sentenced to die, and hung - or they try to, but the branch keeps breaking until the movie director decides to call it a day and continue shooting the final scene the next day...
-   That girl with a white flag in the last verse of "Hero of War" by Rise Against. So, you're in the middle of a war, and a soldier carrying a BFG is asking you to stop. What do you do? Why, keep walking! Of course she got shot, white flag or no white flag.
-   The music video for Shania Twain's "That Don't Impress Me Much". She's wandering around the desert in furs and no head cover, without water, and she keeps rejecting every guy who offers her a ride to safety. Yeah, Shania, that guy might've been a rocket scientist, but you sure ain't. As MTV pointed out: "Shania's chances of survival don't impress us much."
-   The warden in Maggie Rose's "Whiskey and a Gun" has just lost his pistol to the woman he was just trying to sexually assault, who happens to be doing time for murder. She is holding him at gunpoint, and he just smiles and says, "You ain't got the guts." Really? You bet your life that a convicted murderer doesn't have the guts to shoot you after you just tried to sexually assault her?
    -   To say nothing of the murderer herself, who seems to be pretty shocked at her execution after killing two people (one of whom was completely unarmed).
-   "Acid In\[di\]gestion" (parts 1 and 2) by Pretty Balanced, about a girl who samples chemicals from the school science lab and, of course, dies as a result.
-   "Weird Al" Yankovic: The narrator of "A Complicated Song" is told not to stand on a roller coaster. He does, and gets decapitated. He describes this as a "a major inconvenience".
    -   Also from Weird Al is "I'll Sue Ya", which is about a moron who repeatedly hurts and inconveniences himself through sheer idiocy and lack of common sense, and at no point does he ever realize this, instead suing companies for not telling him things that should go without saying.
-   Green Day inverted this a bit in their song "Too Dumb To Die".
-   The Mountain People of The Original Caste's "One Tin Soldier". Starting a rumor that you have treasure when you know that your neighbors are greedy and violent isn't too bright to begin with but it doesn't get any better when they're gathering to massacre you and you still maintain the hoax rather than let them know the truth.
-   Vicki Lawrence's "The Night The Lights Went Out in Georgia" is about a man who tries to alert the police of a murder victim (who was killed by being shot to death) by firing a gun.
-   Bernard Cribbins "Right, Said Fred" ends with one of the movers making a dumb suggestion to cut a hole in the ceiling to help move an unidentified piece of furniture. The eponymous Fred goes along with this dumb suggestion and before anyone else can do anything he knocks out the support to the ceiling bringing the whole kit and kaboodle right down on his head.
-   In the Shel Silverstein\-written "The Unicorn" by the Irish Rovers, the entire unicorn species was too devoted to hiding and "playing silly games" to let Noah capture a couple to bring on the Ark, and they were all washed away.
-   In the music video for _Roar_, Katy Perry's self-absorbed boyfriend gets eaten by a tiger while he's inattentively trudging through an unexplored and dangerous jungle in the middle of the night.

    Music Videos 

-   Miserable: The band is walking all over the body of a bikini-clad giantess and they eventually wind up on her face while she's lying on her back. While everybody else is standing on her forehead, the bassist, Kevin Baldes, is standing on her lips. With one foot on each lip. As a result, when she has a sudden Face–Heel Turn and starts gobbling up the band members, all she has to do is open up and let him fall into her mouth in order to snap him up.

    Podcasts 

-   _The Adventure Zone: Balance_ has Boyland, who dies when he takes his helmet off and opens the window in an incredibly dangerous lab being encased in viral crystal, all for a smoke break.
-   Katie from the _Cool Kids Table_ game _Creepy Town_ thinks that the first several murders are fake and that she's being pranked, so she gets fed up with everything that's happening and tries to walk out of the room backwards while ranting at the others... directly into a meat hook.

    Radio 

-   Eugene in _Adventures in Odyssey_ is usually a pretty smart guy, but there was at least one moment where his big mouth almost got him killed. He had been captured by two diamond thieves, who think he was trying to imitate their MO. Their first thought of what to do with him was to turn him in to the police and try and get him charged with their crimes. Eugene has a strong alibi and a positive reputation in the area, and knows the real thieves' names and faces, so this would end badly for the thieves. Instead of letting them dig their own graves, Eugene proceeds to tell them why it's such a bad idea. The thieves realize he's right, so they decide to just tie him up and leave him in an abandoned building. Eugene then begins telling them why that is also a bad idea. Fortunately, Mr. Whittaker arrives with the police before Eugene can convince the thieves to kill him.
-   _The Bob & Tom Show_: The caller in the Mr. Obvious sketches. In one the caller thinks there is a "critter" in the pipes under his sink and when his wife turns on a light switch it makes it madder than anything. He even tried to get it out once. The sketch lives on this trope. Many either end with bodily injury or came close to it. Others include: Driving a boat down a ski slope (confusing water skiing and snow skiing), Driving with the car sun shade up (not making the connection of needing to remove it), and more.
-   Ideas: A show about warning future people about buried radioactive waste features a story where future archaeologists trek for days to find a facility containing a legendary treasure, despite all the warnings. The "treasure" is a gigantic underground vault filled with thousands of leaking metal objects. They die horribly on the way back, still not knowing what killed them.

    Roleplay 

-   _Murder U_: In the second game, after Kai has recovered from being poisoned and Kellensea has admitted to doing it (counting on there being no punishment since Kai survived), Ranma takes out a rag collected during the investigation, covered in what is probably the same poison, and _licks it_. To nobody's surprise but his own, he collapses swiftly, and only survives because he gets immediate medical attention.
-   Crops up from time to time in _Survival of the Fittest_. One of the most notable examples was _the very first death in v4_. Danya tooks pains to tell the students that the collars were more sensitive this time, and not as prone to tampering. This does not stop Remi Pierce from attempting to slice off his collar with a knife the second he woke up on the island, with expected results.

    Theatre 

-   _Antony and Cleopatra_. Who have even less excuse for this than Romeo and Juliet, seeing that they're not teenagers and that they are two of the most powerful people in the world. Antony ignores the advice of his generals to fight on land, and fights at sea because Cleopatra wants him to. Halfway through the battle, Cleopatra gets frightened and orders her ships to flee, and Antony orders his ships to FOLLOW HER. Naturally, he loses the battle, and blames Cleopatra. To test whether Antony still loves her, Cleopatra sends him a messenger bearing word that she is dead. When he hears this, Antony decides to kill himself, but he's almost too much of a coward to go through with it, and stabs himself in the wrong place so that he is badly wounded, but not yet dead. THEN Cleopatra sends another messenger to say "Oops, I was just messing with you!" What makes it worse is that this actually happened in Real Life. Antony and Cleopatra really were that dumb!
-   In _Gettin' Down in Your Town_, the fact that the Turtles believed Shredder when he says that he can blackmail them from his Prison Dimension really tells you how dumb they are. The fact that they freed him because they _wanted_ him to show the blackmail material in front of their audience just compounds the issue further.
-   _Hamlet_.
    -   So Hamlet just found out that his dad was killed by his uncle, but he still wants to spy around and make sure that the ghost was telling the truth. Fair enough. And then he decides to pretend to be insane, for absolutely _no reason at all_. There is no suspicion on him at this point and the uncle has no idea that the ghost even exists, let alone that it might warn Hamlet of what happened. Of course, his insane act is what gets everyone suspicious in the first place and sets up for the massive death scene at the end.
    -   Depending on the performance, Polonius could also count. Towards the middle of the play, he decides to hide in the queen's bedchamber to spy on her conversation with Hamlet. As things go on, he panics and starts screaming for help, leading a very paranoid Hamlet to run him through. If the actor playing Hamlet is sufficiently insane and frightening, it's a bit more understandable. Otherwise...
-   In _Pokémon: The Mew-sical_, most of Team Rocket counts. Several Rocket Grunts annoy Giovanni and are shot as a result, and one Grunt reports that an agent fought a boulder for twenty minutes because they mistook it for a Graveler.
-   The titular duo of _Romeo and Juliet_ have known each other less than a few days, before they kill themselves in despair when they find each other's dead bodies. The play exacerbates this by making her wake up \*the second\* Romeo drinks the poison, before she stabs herself with his dagger.
-   February, the schience officer from _Starship_ who goes down to an uncharted alien planet and scans the air for breathability... _after_ taking off her helmet. It gets worse from there.
-   In Noah Smith's stage version of _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, after hearing Jekyll confess to murder and that he can no longer control when he becomes Hyde, the characters let him leave the room to get his coat so they can take him to the police. Hyde returns seconds later with a gun.
-   Theatre/Six:Anne Boleyn decides it’s an excellent idea to flirt with some guys to make Henry jealous then insult him on his impotence. She gets beheaded for it.
-   _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_: "Pirelli" recognizes a former employer, who so far as he knows is guilty of such a serious crime that he was transported to Australia. So, "Pirelli" decides to meet alone with this man, whose profession involves use of lethal weapons (straight razors), to try to blackmail him. Not exactly surprising that this piece of stupidity _does_ end up being fatal.
-   _The Thousand Year Rose_ has Ciera, the witch. She has many moments of stupidity throughout the play, but moments before she and Wicked Witch Abigail are about to kill Kimmi, Kimmi says "quick, Ciera — let me go!" and Ciera drops her hold on Kimmi and cheerfully says "OK!"
-   _Westeros: An American Musical_:
    -   Eddard Stark eventually figures out that his foster father did not die of a fever, but got killed because he had discovered a secret about the royal family and was about to expose it. Eddard's response to that is try to figure out what the secret was, plan to expose it himself _and tell other people about his findings_. Unsurprisingly, he doesn't last long.
    -   Robb Stark takes after his father. He promises Walder Frey an Arranged Marriage with one of his daughters in exchange for troops and the right to cross a bridge guarded by the Frey family. A few months later, he sleeps with another woman and makes up for it with a Honorable Marriage Proposal. The Freys retaliate by having Robb and his mother killed.

    Websites 

-   Cracked blog once poked fun at _Terminator_, specifically how all these people were clearly either terminally dumb or seriously determined to self-terminate (sorry). That is —
    
    **Cyberdine's tech support engineer:** ...Again, my strength really lie in fixing computers, not in designing or managing needlessly nightmarish robots, but it just seems like a basic rule of computer-making that you should be able to turn it off at some point. I mean, my toaster has a plug in case something goes wrong, you know? And I haven't armed my toaster or given it access to my house's security system.
    
-   The Jolly Roger Telephone Company provides bots designed to talk to telemarketers and other annoying callers. There's a female bot who has a routine in which the talks about mixing ammonia with bleach to make a cleaner, stumbles around stubbing her toe, and otherwise acts the idiot.
-   Some of the people in the stories on Not Always Right and its sibling sites, such as here.
-   _The Onion_: The Experts agree, the giant, razor clawed bioengineered crabs pose no threat.
-   _SCP Foundation_:
    -   It brings us SCP-2416, a seemingly-ordinary man who keeps dying in various ridiculous ways (including attempting to kiss a table saw, trying to climb the Chrysler Building, and choking on oatmeal), only to reincarnate every time.
    -   A similar story happened to the former owners of SCP-1958. Hippies discover a flying bus which can hold a livable climate and breathable atmosphere even in outer space, and decide to use it to colonize Alpha Centauri. Which is about four _light-years_ away from Earth. When they find out the bus is "pulling eighty-two", they get ecstatic and figure they'll be there within a few weeks. Four months later, everyone is dead (one from taking a spacewalk without any kind of harness, one suicide, and one from scurvy), and they've only just reached Earth's moon. You would think a group of four people, one of whom is a graduate and was able to make a working, airtight space van would know better than screw up so badly. Also, their pilot barely even knew how to drive a regular bus.
    -   One of the termination attempts for SCP-682 was taping a picture of 096 to 173. 096 kills anyone who sees its face, while 173 kills anything that looks away. The Foundation noted that it might kill 682, but the suggestion is still unbelievably stupid because there'd be no way for the Foundation to safely contain 173 afterward.
    -   The joke scp SCP-1543-5 is a launchpad to throw certain anomalies into the sun. Among the list of anomalies that have been flung there is a globe that "controls what happens on earth— whatever is inflicted on it occurs on our planet as well." So it makes perfect sense to throw it into the sun. You can't even say this was discovered after the fact, either, since if the anomaly in the object wasn't known, there wouldn't be any reason to treat it as an SCP and it wouldn't have been hurled into the sun. The anomaly thrown immediately after that implies they did the same thing to an object tied to the _entire universe_.
-   Danbooru has two pools dedicated to this trope. First of all the "Digging Your Own Grave" pool, which is about characters doing/saying something stupid with a lack of foresight and being about to be punished for it, comments along the lines of "Death Flag triggered" are quite common. Secondly is the "Told You Not To Do That" pool, which is about the aftermath and/or consequences of characters doing/saying something stupid with a lack of foresight.

-   The Interviewer guy of _On the Set of 4th Edition_ normally is a Cosmic Plaything, getting killed by the creatures he interviews that don't get killed alongside him. But when drunk, all survival instincts flee him at high velocity as, to demonstrate a skill challenge, he decides to hit on The Lady of Pain, who he knows is capable of nullifying gods and flaying people with a glance, and he outright tries to intimidate her into giving him her number. Of all the times he's been killed in these shows, this was the one time he deserved it.
