_"Everyone is dead and everything is_ terrible _and I! AM! MAKING! PANCAKES!"_

People do things that help them lower stress and try to forget after a hard day. Sometimes people try to drink their problems away. Others try to eat their body weight in ice cream. This type of behavior is a fairly common coping mechanism in both fiction and Real Life. This usually takes place after a fight with a loved one or some other type of high-level emotional distress, usually while lamenting about who or what is bothering them.

Compare Heartbreak and Ice Cream, Comfort Food, and the alcoholic equivalent Drowning My Sorrows. Many of these characters experience Weight Woe due to this. It also may lead to Formerly Fit. Contrast Too Unhappy to Be Hungry, where distress leads a character to _not_ eat.

-   _Fresh Pretty Cure!_: After realizing that Miki already has a boyfriend and his hundredth defeat in attempting to ask her out, Yuuki goes on a binge of donuts while crying. As he puts it to the clerk "If it's gonna be like that, I'll just stuff my face. Old man, give 'em to me nonstop!".
-   After having a minor squabble with Sae, Hiro of _Hidamari Sketch_ goes on a binge eating tons of food from cake and donuts to curry, always with a "><" on her face and constantly saying things like "Stupid Sae".
-   _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_:
    -   Played for laughs as both Aladdin and Alibaba after the events of the Balbadd arc did this for _months_ to the point they became grossly overweight. In Aladdin's case, Morgiana and Ja'far spoiled him rotten with treats so he wouldn't have to think about Ugo's death.
    -   In the Alma Torran flashback, Sheba aggressively ate everything at the table after she saw her Precocious Crush Solomon having a close moment with who she believed was her rival Arba. Her son Aladdin happened to share this trait.

-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ Kyoko goes off on a binge after she loses an argument with Sayaka. In a variant of this, it's also implied that her Big Eater tendencies are a coping mechanism for her Dark and Troubled Past; namely, her family starving after her priest father got excommunicated, and later his killing the rest of her family and himself after finding out about Kyoko's contract. Later, she scarfs down a huge amount of food when trying to figure out if she can recover Sayaka's Soul Gem after she becomes a witch.
-   Usagi tends to do this in the first anime of _Sailor Moon_, usually after fights with Mamoru. Not so much in the manga.
-   One _Star Ocean EX_ has Rena do this in a panic after she mistakenly thinks she saw Claude and Celine smooching.
-   Midora from _Toriko_ takes this trope to a massive villainous level. He became a Villainous Glutton with a huge appetite in order to cope with the loss of Frohze.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Dusk to Dawn_ series, Catwoman is a Big Eater, so food is her preferred stress reliever. This comes from being homeless and fending off starvation every day as a kid. In the first book _Batman: Angel of Death_, when she learns her little sister has grown into a cult's Super-Soldier, Selina makes a beeline for the fridge and gorges on whatever she can find, including raw eggs.

    -   During the events of _Avengers: Infinity War_, Thor witnesses Thanos killing half of his people, including his brother and his best friend, and later fails to kill Thanos in time because he was too focussed on getting his revenge. This leads to Thanos killing half of all life in the universe. In _Avengers: Endgame_, before the mission to the Garden, where the Avengers hope to get the Infinity Stones to reverse Thanos's fingersnap, Thor is shown eating a bowl of bread in addition to drinking alcohol. After it is revealed that Thanos destroyed the Stones and with them all hope to reverse the snap, Thor passes the Despair Event Horizon, and when we see him again after a five-year time jump, it's made abundantly clear from how his house in New Asgard is littered with discarded wings, pizza boxes, and snack wrappers that he's been eating way too much junk food.

He gets _worse_ when he finally gets noticed by the pizza delivery man, going _wild_ on eating a vast amount of junk food to the point of violently throwing up.

-   This was a Running Gag, often heavily lampshaded, on _The Nanny_.

    **Maggie**: Eat a box of Mallomars!
