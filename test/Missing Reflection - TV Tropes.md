Vampires seldom reflect on the emptiness of their unlives. But think of the potential limbo victories!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"According to Elibori they cast no reflected image. Thus, for example, one cannot see them, nor can they see themselves, in a mirror. Nor in any other object serving the same purpose...like water, windowpanes, etc."_

A popular conception about vampires is that they cast no reflection in a mirror and often have an intense aversion to them. Genre Savvy characters may become aware of places that lack mirrors or contain several broken ones foreshadowing this trope.

The reason for why mirrors work this way is for multiple reasons. It has to do with the idea that mirrors reflect souls and because vampires don't have souls, they don't have reflections. There is also the old argument that blood suckers exist in two worlds, in the living and in the dead. But since it isn't fully in either one it will not be seen in a mirror. Alternately, many old mirrors were made with silver, a metal considered to have mystical or holy properties, and as such they would not reflect vampires; if a work uses this as a plot point, you might be able to expect modern mirrors (which use aluminum) to not have this property. As for the mirror-phobia, mirrors force vampires to confront their nature of existence as an undead, which is why many vampires do not like mirrors.

Depending on the setting, a Missing Reflection may take the form of not appearing on film and/or digital cameras, or being inaudible on telephone or recording.

Note that traditional vampire folklore doesn't necessarily include the lore about vampires and mirrors. In fact, the idea originated from Bram Stoker's renowned novel _Dracula_ (1897) wherein Jonathan Harker notices the Count's missing reflection in his shaving mirror.

Sub-Trope of Glamour Failure and Sister Trope to The Mirror Shows Your True Self. Compare Casts No Shadow, which is to this trope what The Shadow Knows is to The Mirror Shows Your True Self. Not to be confused First-Person Ghost, which is characters lacking reflections (among other things) because of technical limitations.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Chargeman Ken!_: The Juralians do not reflect on mirrors or cameras even when they assume human form.
-   The doppelganger who appears in one episode of _Ergo Proxy_ does not reflect on the water.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency_: Joseph Joestar exploits the vampire Straizo's lack of a reflection during their fight: at one point, Straizo appears to have used his Eye Beams to pierce a hole in Joseph's head... yet Joseph seems unaffected. As it turns out, Straizo actually attacked Joseph's reflection in the mirror, a mistake he could only make because the mirror didn't show Straizo's own reflection (if you're wondering why his eye beams weren't reflected when they hit the mirror, they're actually made of high-pressure eyeball fluid, not lasers).
-   _Jujutsu Kaisen_: Cameras can't capture the image of a cursed spirit. In Chapter 20, this is what first tips off Nanami that something's off about the 'cursed spirits' he and Itadori just fought - they're visible through his phone camera. Turns out, they aren't curses at all, but rather humans altered by Mahito's Idle Transfiguration.
-   Despite its female lead being a half-vampire and playing classical weaknesses for laughs, _My Monster Secret_ actually avoids this trope. Until very late in the series, where Youko's vampiric nature begins asserting itself and she stops showing up in photographs — which causes her friend Mikan to realize that she's a vampire.
-   _One Piece_: When the crew meets Brook for the first time, Nami shows him a mirror and they discover his reflection doesn't show. They all immediately jump the gun and assume he's a vampire. It's later revealed that this is another side effect of Gecko Moria's shadow-stealing powers.
-   In _Otherside Picnic_ the mirror cube Toriko obtains from defeating the kunekune turns out to reflect everything like a normal mirror _except_ humans. Toriko jokingly suggests that the cube works like this because Sorawo, who perceived the kunekune and allowed Toriko to kill it, is a misanthrope. Sorawo isn't amused.
-   As a vampire, Touta Konoe from _UQ Holder!_ lacks a reflection. It's what tipped off Kuromaru about his true nature.

-   _Mélusine_: Anearly strip has Melusine charged with babysitting a bratty vampire kid.

-   In _Peculia and the Goon Grove Vampires_, one of the babysitters is taken to a bedroom to try and shake off a dizziness spell while talking with her charge.

But soon realizes she really _doesn't_ have a reflection, to which the charge quickly bites and drains her.
-   In "The Wolf Doctor" in _Rulah, Jungle Goddess_ #17, one of the symptoms of lycanthropy is that those who are infected stop casting a reflection. (Possibly the writer was getting it mixed up with vampirism...?)

    Comic Strips 

-   _The Far Side_
    -   One strip has a man ranting on a soapbox about vampires being everywhere. None of the passersby seem to be listening to him, and the reason why is apparent in a large mirror being carried across a nearby street behind his back, which shows a reflection of him alone.

This likewise happens earlier in the film when Rafe takes some pictures of some dead bodies in a coffin as evidence. However since it was the body of a vampire Lilith herself killed. It doesn't show up in the picture when Rafe tries to show police it.
-   Two examples in _Bram Stoker's Dracula_:
    -   Jonathan pulls out a mini-mirror to shave only for Dracula to come visit in his room all of a sudden. Jonathan is startled by his presence since he didn't see him in the mirror. When Dracula sees it, he hisses and uses his powers to crack it.
    -   During the scene with Jonathan and the brides who proceed to seduce him, at one point, the camera cuts to a mirror above their bed. Jonathan is the only one reflected in it while invisible forces pull at his clothes and cut into his skin.

-   _Dracula 2000_
    -   In a flashback scene it's shown Van Helsing used this to lure Dracula into a trap. As Dracula could see Van Helsing in a disguised mirror but not himself, he failed to realise the vampire hunter was actually standing behind him.
    -   In the present day, Dracula attacks TV reporter Valerie Sharpe and her cameraman while they are filming the crashed plane he was on. Initially the cameraman can't see him through the viewfinder, so when Dracula grabs Valerie and cuts at her neck a bit, all he sees is her struggling and the cut suddenly appearing, until he lowers the camera. Likewise when Valerie runs to their van, she sees her cameraman being tossed aside by an invisible force on her monitors.
-   The same trope of vampire lore was parodied in _Dracula: Dead and Loving It_, where a big dance scene ends up being ridiculous when seen in a mirror, particularly when Dracula is spinning the woman in the air.
-   Exploited during the ballroom scene in _The Fearless Vampire Killers_. Since vampires cast no reflection, a mirror was used as a trap to indicate who was human during the vampire ball.
-   _Fright Night (1985)_: Peter Vincent accidentally notices that Jerry Dandrige doesn't have a reflection, shocking him into grasping that Charley was right about Dandridge being a vampire.

-   _Tales from the Hood 2_: In "Date Night", the vampire girls don't show up in the camera being used to film them. Their clothes, however, do.
-   In _Vamp!_, AJ reveals to Keith this trope is in effect after becoming a vampire. Later, as Keith is trying to leave town, he discovers Duncan has become a vampire when he doesn't see him in the rear view.
    -   Note that this trope is foreshadowed when the club's strippers - vampires, all - are shown applying makeup to one another. They sit in pairs at two-sided makeup tables, and reach through empty frames where mirrors _ought_ to be to apply cosmetics to one another.
-   _Van Helsing_ provides the page image. A mirror reflects a person dancing, but not their vampire partner. Same goes for the other couple hundred people in the ballroom. Those paying close attention can see this Oh, Crap! moment coming.
-   In one segment of the anthology horror film _Vault of Horror_, a man finds himself in a diner where the staff and the menu are a bit... odd. He realizes too late why when he notices that he's the only person in the diner with a reflection.
-   In _What We Do in the Shadows_, the vampires have to help each other get dressed before going out on the town because their lack of reflections means they can't see what their outfits look like. Like all the other vampire tropes and references used in the movie, this is Played for Laughs. Furthermore, they have no problem with cameras.

    Literature 

-   Subverted in _The Big Over Easy_: Pursuing a suspect through the surrealist Castle Spongg, Jack is freaked out to discover he doesn't appear in a mirror, and even more so when his quarry _does_, but doesn't appear in the room. It turns out it isn't a mirror, it's a window to an identical but reflected room.
-   Weaponized in _Vengeance of the Dancing Gods_: a sneaky demon sets a "mark" on the master thief Macore: henceforth he will cast no shadow or reflection. Macore later uses this mark to slip into the wizard Ruddygore's treasure vault and initiate Hell's newest plan for taking over Earth.
-   Bram Stoker's _Dracula_: Soon after his arrival at Castle Dracula, Jonathan Harker observes the building was devoid of mirrors. When Dracula silently comes into Harker's room while he was shaving, Harker notices that Dracula, who is standing behind him, does not appear in the shaving mirror as he should have. The Count reacts violently and flings the mirror out a window. The missing reflection is the first solid evidence of his vampiric nature that Jonathan directly observes. Professor Van Helsing later notes that Dracula lacks both reflection and shadow; the latter is left out of most adaptations, possibly because of the practical difficulties it would create.
-   In Robert A. Heinlein's novella "Magic, Inc." the protagonists realize Ditworth is a demon when one of them notices him not casting a reflection in a mirror.
-   In _The Nekropolis Archives_, vampires look human, but cast no reflection or shadow.
-   In Kim Newman's vampire stories, the effect varies depending on a vampire's bloodline; some vampires have no reflection at all, while others have a vague or incomplete reflection. In "Sorcerer Conjurer Wizard Witch", his recurring vampire character Geneviève is standing in a room with several mirrors, and simultaneously appears as a featureless silhouette in one mirror and a "smudgy column of vaguely woman-shaped smoke" in another.
-   _The Night Flier_: The vampire can't be seen through a mirror, most notably at the end when he manhandles the main character inside an airport bathroom and it just looks like he's being held up by thin air. This is also a Berserk Button for the vampire, who prefers smashing every mirror he sees.
-   In _Snow-Walker_, because by sorcery Gudrun and Kari are each other's living reflections, neither casts one in glass.
-   In _Sphere_, the title object reflects its surroundings, but not people. Norman the psychologist is the only one who notices at first, and has to clue his coworkers in since they're distracted by everything else alien about it.
    
    **Norman:** What worries me is that it's reflecting everything but us. I hate to be the one non-scientist who picks this up, guys.
    
-   In _The United States of Monsters_, vampires lose their reflection when they become Old Ones.
-   In the story "Cast the First Shadow", a man who Casts No Shadow, long persecuted for it, meets with a woman who similarly has no shadow — only to be revolted and turned away from her by the discovery that she also has the unnatural property of having no reflection.
-   Zig-zagged in _The Vampire Files_: vampires cast no reflection normally, but can become intangible and invisible to direct sight, at which times their reflections _are_ visible as clouds of mist. It takes quite a few books for the vampire protagonist to discover this, as he's virtually blind when intangible and so can't see whether he's casting any sort of reflection or not.
-   _Washio Sumi Is a Hero_: Gin tries to take a photograph of a Vertex on her smartphone but it isn't visible in the photo.
-   Inverted in Sergey Lukyanenko's _World of Watches_. Vampires can glamour the minds of humans to hide themselves from sight. This does not work on Others, who can easily see through these mind tricks. The only way for a human to see a hidden vampire is to look at a reflection, as glamour only works in direct line-of-sight. Video cameras work fine as well.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _Reaper Man_, one of Arthur Winkings, Count Notfaroutoe's many complaints about being a vampire is that he can't shave properly. Paul Kidby's illustration of the Fresh Start Club shows his face covered in cuts.
    -   _The Reformed Vampyre Diary_ and _The Compleat Ankh-Morpork City Guide_ feature a solution to this problem in the form of the First Imp-Pressions iconograph mirror.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Being Human (UK)_
    -   In Season One there's a weird but tense scene where the three main characters are fooled into watching a vampire who has filmed themselves having sex and then feeding and killing a human... but only the human shows on the DVD (then the vampire's bloody footprints when she walks through the blood pooling afterwards).
    -   It's established that vampires still appear in _semi_\-reflective surfaces, meaning the special effects team don't have to get involved every time a vampire walks past a plate-glass window.
-   _Buffyverse_:
    -   Vampires don't show up in mirrors (prompting Willow to ask Angel at one time, "How do you shave?"), although they can be captured in photos and video.
    -   Averted when Ted comes Back from the Dead; he's shown next to his reflection in the window to let the audience know he's not a vampire. Turns out he's actually a robot.
    -   In "Bad Eggs" while at the mall Buffy politely looks away from a couple kissing...and sees in the wall mirror that only the girl is visible.
    -   One vampire actually makes sure to keep all mirrors out of their surroundings to avoid this. Unfortunately for him, this, along with the heavy curtains and slightly suspicious behavior, causes Cordelia, who has encountered vampires before, to figure out exactly what he is.
    -   This is lampshaded when Wesley is impersonating Angel, where he screams at the sight of a mirror and insists it be covered (so it won't expose him by showing his reflection) while the people around him stand bemused and point out that they already know he is a vampire.
    -   When Angel visits Pylea, he temporarily loses several of his vampiric weaknesses, including the lack of reflection. The novelty of having a reflection takes a while to wear off, and his friends start making sarcastic comments about how much time he's spending looking in mirrors.
    -   When Angel suffers from phlebotinum-induced amnesia and doesn't know he is a vampire. Then he looks in a mirror...
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Vampires of Venice": The Saturnynians don't show up in mirrors. It is explained that the perception filter they use to appear human "manipulates the brainwaves" of whoever is looking at one, but it doesn't work on mirrors, which show them for what they are. The mind, however, is confused by the two being different, and compensates by simply not showing a reflection at all.
    -   "It Takes You Away": The mirror-portal doesn't show the reflections of anyone standing in front of it when it's active, which is how Graham discovers there's something odd about it. When Ryan comes up and sees it as well, he suggests that he and Graham would know if they were vampires.
-   Zig-zagged in _Forever Knight_. Most vampires don't appear in mirrors, but Nick having a reflection was handwaved as being because of his progress toward humanity. In reality, budget issues prevented the editing out of every reflection.
-   In _I Dream of Jeannie_, Jeannie cannot be photographed in some episodes... but this rule is inconsistent, and she absolutely can be photographed in some other episodes.
-   In _Kamen Rider Ex-Aid_'s net spinoff _Kamen Sentai Gorider_, protagonist Emu meets several slain Kamen Riders in a Closed Circle mystery. The room where they spend most of their time has a giant mirror, and none of the dead Riders casts a reflection — but Emu does, which makes them suspicious. This actually gives away real culprit: one of the Riders present is Kazuma Kenzaki (Kamen Rider Blade), who didn't die at the end of his series but rather turned himself into a monster (though he initially claims that's the same thing as being dead). When the _real_ Kenzaki shows up, he casts a reflection just like Emu, exposing the impostor.
-   Played with in _Moonlight_, where vampires appear as blurs in old films, but show up perfectly fine on digital cameras and mirrors without silver backing. The explanation given was that the chemicals used to develop the film included silver, which destroyed the vampire's image. This is actually a problem, as a blurry photo only revealed that the photographer was incompetent, while a clear digital picture of a vampire with a Game Face feeding on someone is compromising evidence. It is not mentioned if the image is blurred in regular silver mirrors (which are still widely used).
-   The _Quantum Leap_ episode "Blood Moon" has Sam Beckett leap into the body of a madman who lives in a castle and thinks he's a vampire, in order to protect a young woman from being killed by the vampire cult. Throughout the episode, Sam scoffs at the existence of vampires, until just before he leaps out; he finally sees a mirror, only to find that he has no reflection.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_:
    -   In "And When the Sky Was Opened", Colonel Clegg Forbes realizes that he is about to disappear when he sees that he no longer has a reflection.
    -   In "A Passage for Trumpet", Joey Crown discovers that he does not have a reflection when he looks into the mirror at the cinema. It is later revealed that this is because he is a state of limbo between life and death.
    -   In "Nothing in the Dark", Wanda Dunn's suspicion that Harold Beldon is Death is confirmed when he tells her to look in the mirror and she sees that he has no reflection.
-   _Ultraman Tiga_: Giranbo is a child-abducting monster that can shape-shift to human form to blend in. She doesn't have a reflection, which is how she is spotted.
-   Vampires in _Ultraviolet (1998)_ have no reflection, neither can their image or voice be transferred by electronic media such as telephones or CCTV cameras. Even their fingerprints can't be recorded. The government team that's hunting them therefore use small video cameras attached to their weapons to confirm their target.
-   _Wizards of Waverly Place_: In vampire Juliet's debut episode, there's a sight gag where she does her hair in her mirror that doesn't show her reflection.

    Manhua 

-   _Old Master Q_ has a comical take on the trope in one strip where he meets an old acquittance of his, Liu, late one night while randomly on a stroll. Master Q remarks that he haven't seen Liu ever since the latter had that illness some months ago, but just then they pass a glass storefront and Master Q realize Liu doesn't have a reflection...

    Music 

-   In music video to "Diary of Jane" by Breaking Benjamin, the eponymous Jane realizes she's a ghost when she can't see her reflection in a room filled with mirrors.
-   In Michael Jackson's video for "Billie Jean", while Jackson being a vampire is not alluded to in the video, he's clearly supernatural to some extent given his ability to disappear and make everything he touches glow. This extends to him not appearing on film when the paparazzo tries to get a picture of him.

    Myths & Religion 

-   A common theme throughout vampire mythology explains that because they don't have souls, they don't have reflections, unless the mirror doesn't have a silver backing (vampires are weak to silver).

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Curse of Strahd_: Used as an Easter Egg in the character art. Below his stat block at the back of the book, there's a picture of Strahd von Zarovich. Looking at it closely will show a mirror to the left of the image, reflecting the glass of wine Strahd is holding but not the rest of him. The trope is not called attention to in the actual game, but it's implied by all the intact mirrors of Castle Ravenloft having been taken down and moved to one specific room that it still applies.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy_: The lack of a reflection is one of the "standard" weaknesses that can betray a vampire. However, millennia of branching Vampire Varieties have allowed some vampires to regain reflections, and high-quality mirrors are rare and expensive enough in the premodern setting to make it a tricky thing to test.
-   _The World of Darkness_:
    -   In _Vampire: The Masquerade_, the Lasombra don't leave images on cameras and mirrors. However, this only applies if the camera uses mirrors for imaging. It's noted that older Lasombra are starting to see their image for the first time in centuries, due to digital imaging - which means they usually end up having _words_ with the ghouls they relied on to paint portraits, after realizing they don't look like that.
    -   Zig-zagged in _Vampire: The Requiem_. Vampires typically leave blurry images in mirrors, photos, and films though they can usually make the image look normal by focusing their will. The Hollow Mekhet can't be recorded and don't show up in mirrors at all, because their reflections are off somewhere making trouble.

    Theatre 

-   _Tanz Der Vampire_, The Musical of _The Fearless Vampire Killers_, uses the trope differently. As Herbert flirtatiously dances with Alfred, the latter realizes the Viscount von Krolock doesn't have a reflection as they pass a mirror. The effect is achieved by having a dance double for Alfred and none for Herbert in the "mirror". Later, Alfred tells Professor Abronsius that "Alibori's theory is correct" about the Missing Reflection, but by this time the heroes already have more than enough evidence that the Krolocks are vampires.

    Video Games 

-   _Baldur's Gate III_: As a vampire spawn, Astarion lacks a reflection in mirrors. This is Lampshaded by him several times and is a bit of a sore spot, given that he's forgotten what he looked like prior to becoming a spawn 200 years ago.
-   _The Binding of Isaac_:
    -   The _Repentance_ DLC added an Easter Egg with this. Picking up the Charm of the Vampire will remove your reflection from pools of water.
    -   Wraiths are enemies that can be found in the Downpour/Dross. They're normally invisible except for their reflections. However, when you enter the Mirror World, they become visible but leave no reflections.
-   In _BlazBlue_, Rachel Alucard doesn't cast a reflection in any reflective surface, be it a mirror, a water puddle or a really reflective floor, due to her being a vampire.
-   In _Brain Dead 13_, when Vivi looks in the mirror, she has no reflection (save for her lipstick), revealing that she is a vampire. Not like this wasn't obvious before.
-   _Castlevania_:
    -   When Reinhardt or Carrie passes through the Villa in _Castlevania 64_, they will encounter a villager who frantically begs them for help. However, in the room is a large mirror in which he doesn't appear, revealing himself to be a vampire. The protagonist notices the missing reflection in time to dodge the vampire's sneak attack.
    -   The half-vampire Alucard also lacks a reflection, as seen in Julius Mode of _Dawn of Sorrow_. This trait is even carried over into _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_ where Alucard appears as an assist trophy. He doesn't appear on the Wii Fit Studio stage, which has a giant mirror that reflects fighters, items and off course, assist trophies.
-   In _The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark_, vampires do not appear in photographs, unless they're reverse-vampires (which lack or have reversed versions of most of the traditional weaknesses). At one point the protagonist finds a vampire's graduation photo, which shows a single ordinary-looking reverse-vampire standing in a row of apparently-empty graduation gowns and caps seemingly standing up by themselves.
-   In the _Five Nights at Freddy's_ game, _Ultimate Custom Night_, two animatronics, Nightmare Fredbear and Nightmare, do not appear on security cameras. You will only be able to spot when they're coming after you when you see them appear at your left and right doors respectively. If you do not notice them or don't close the door on them in time, they will kill you.
-   When Aqua reaches The World Within in _Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-_, she has no reflection in the mirror she came through. When Aqua completes the first mirror room, a blurry, obscure reflection can be seen, becoming more and more clear until it is completely normal after completing every mirror.
-   In _The Sims 4_, vampires don't have reflections in mirrors. Somehow this doesn't stop them from using mirrors the same way other Sims do — freshening up their makeup, trying on outfits, practicing speeches, calming down from potentially deadly emotional extremes, etc.
-   _Stigmatized Property_: The Player Character doesn't have any reflection in the mirrors in the apartment. This may have more to do with technical limitations of the game than anything In-Universe.
-   _A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky_: A Lydian that's probably a ghost is therefore probably haunting the exit point of the Old Avishun Teleporter, looking at water. When interacted with, he says:
    
    Didn't...\[pause\] didn't I used to have a reflection?

-   In _Daniel_, a vampire appears in a mirror as a faint translucent silhouette. However, the vampire himself sees something unspeakably horrible in the mirror instead.
-   In _Dracula: Ruler of the Night_ this is used when the hunters are trying to escape from Carfax Abbey, coming across an apparently kidnapped Mrs. Westenra (Lucy's mother) in the process. Jonathan, in trying to reassure her they'll keep her safe, catches a reflection off a metal surface and only see her clothing floating in the air. Revealing to his horror that she has long since been bitten and turned.
-   In _Fangs And Frights,_ Nathan sees a sort of shadowy silhouette where his head should be, which seriously unnerves him.
-   _The Perry Bible Fellowship_: One strip has a gag involving a vampire mother and daughter having an argument.
-   Zig-zagged in _Vampire Bites_, vampires can see their reflection but only during the day. Once night hits, their reflection fades. Though electronic devices like camera phones will still show them.
-   One _xkcd_ strip compares refracting and reflecting telescopes, listing the flaws of each; the refractor is listed as being more expensive and less compact, experiencing chromatic aberration, and not being able to gather as much light as a reflector of the same size. The reflector's flaw? It can't see space vampires.

    Web Original 

-   In _Spooky Month_, Streber works at a haunted house attraction in vampire costume. To sell the illusion, he demonstrates his lack of a reflection with a convenient mirror. The trick is that the mirror is rigged, and Streber throws his green-lined cloak over his head when showing it to children.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_: While she shows up on film many times, the title card for "Marceline's Closet" shows that Marceline lacks a reflection.
-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_: Carrie often lacks a reflection and doesn't show up on film, though this trait is frequently ignored depending on the needs of the plot. This is perhaps best demonstrated in "The Tape": the whole episode is a recording, and though her "introduction" just shows blank space, in several other scenes Carrie is clearly visible. In "The Drama", Carrie not showing up in a regular camera's picture causes her to retake it with a Magical Camera—which shows her along with several other ghosts that are Invisible to Normals.
-   _Avengers Assemble_ has a hilarious moment where Black Widow, having been bitten by a vampire, attempts to escape from Captain America and Iron Man... and promptly knocks herself out running into a mirror because she didn't see her reflection.
-   _Count Duckula_:
    -   In "One Stormy Night", Duckula comes across a statue of him that came to life and believes that it's his reflection when it moves just like him. The statue points out to him that vampires don't have a reflection.
    -   Hilariously done when the eponymous duck decides to redecorate the castle and one decorator hired does the place up in all windows. Since the duck is a vampire, he can't see himself in any of them.
-   _Infinity Train_: Tulip's reflection takes on a life of her own in "The Chrome Car", after which Tulip has no visible reflection in a mirror. When Tulip returns to Earth, she _still_ has no reflection.
-   _Kamp Koral_: In "Scaredy Squirrel", vampire camper Kidferatu is invisible in his counselor photo, which only shows an ascot and hat.
-   _The Legend of Vox Machina_:
    -   As the Briarwoods walk past a mirror on their way to their room at the feast, Delilah is visible but Sylas isn't, giving the first tell that Sylas is undead.
    -   A later episode reveals this is also how Delilah first discovered that the Whispered One had resurrected Sylas by turning him into a vampire; she looked in their bedside mirror and realized his reflection was missing.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda_ animated series episode "Doppelganger", Link is initially fooled by the evil fake Zelda that was created by a Magic Mirror secretly sent by Ganon and replaced the kidnapped original. But when they ride past a lake on horseback, he notices that only her horse has a reflection rather than her. He plays along to stage a rescue mission.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_: Kwamis, the fairy-like beings that are the source of the heroes' power, do not show up in photographs or video and cannot be seen by robots. However, Marinette gave the kwamis a cell phone for emergencies, and they do seem to be able to talk through that. One episode has Kaalki (and, more subtly, Wayzz) show up on Nathalie's tablet, but the tablet is connected to the eyes of a magical creature she created rather than a camera.
-   _The Real Ghostbusters_:
    -   In "No One Comes to Lupisville", Egon notices that their "hosts" don't have reflections.
    -   In "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Ghost?", Uncle Horace was scared when he sees his "reflection" in the mirror, seeing how he doesn't have one because he's a ghost.
-   _Steven Universe_:
    -   Nothing in Rose's room shows up in photo. Steven takes a picture of himself there and it just turns out as him in a giant black void.
    -   While Gems' Hard Light bodies are humanly visible in person and photograph, the _Future_ episode "Growing Pains" reveals that only their gemstones show up on radiographs. Being a Half-Human Hybrid, radiographs of Steven show a skeleton _and_ a gemstone.
