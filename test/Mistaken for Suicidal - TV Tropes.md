A character is standing on a ledge or behaving in a somber manner when someone else notices them. The person starts worrying that the other person is going to try and kill themself, but it turns out it's Not What It Looks Like. This trope is Played for Laughs just as often as it's Played for Drama. It may result in an Unwanted Rescue.

This occuring between two strangers often turns into a Meet Cute: One mistakes the other for trying to kill themselves, helps them, learns that the other was just fine, and they spark a bond.

Compare to Interrupted Suicide, which is when someone is actually stopped from committing suicide, Mistaken for Brooding, for when a character thinks someone is sad but not suicidal, and Make It Look Like an Accident, which can result in the murderer trying to make a murder seem like a suicide. This can occur if a character looks like they're having a Prelude to Suicide.

-   BanG Dream!: It's MyGo!!!!!: In Episode 3, the inciting incident for Tomori and Sakiko's first meeting was Sakiko attempting to stop Tomori from what she thought was an attempt at suicide. In actuality, Tomori was just absentmindedly reaching out for falling cherry blossom petals near a bridge.
-   _A Couple of Cuckoos_: Nagi sees Erika standing on a bridge railing, screams at her not to jump, and pulls her away, accidentally grabbing her boobs. After punching him, she says she was not jumping, she was taking a picture and was getting a better angle.
-   In Hasoda's _The Girl Who Leapt Through Time_, the main character tries to jump out of her bedroom window but is stopped by her concerned little sister. The thing is, she wasn't trying to kill herself; she was trying to time-leap, and hadn't quite figured out how to do it properly.
-   Invoked in _Life (2002)_. The Alpha Bitch Manami originally pretended to be Ayumi's friend. After her boyfriend left her, she became so distraught that she tried to jump in front of a train. Ayumi saved her from dying. It's later implied that Manami wasn't really suicidal and was just trying to play with Ayumi's head.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid Life_ has a scene where Nanoha comes home to find Rio hanging up a noose for a New Year's party (because she doesn't know what a wreath is). It's easily the darkest joke in the entire franchise.

She says that it's because they have no training and thus the gun would likely be more dangerous to them, though it's also implied she believes Kurumi would use it on herself someday.
