**Optimus Prime:** Bumblebee, my small little friend. You look... different.  
**Bumblebee:** Yeah, I just totally got rebuilt. I feel better than ever. I feel like a _gold bug._  
**Optimus Prime:** Ha Ha! And that's who you'll be from now on, Bumblebee: **Goldbug**!  
**Goldbug:** _\[uneasy laughter\]_ Uh... thanks... Uh, gee, Optimus, I was kinda thinking I could still be called Bumblebee.  
**Optimus Prime:** Quiet, Goldbug.  
**Goldbug:** Shutting up now, Optimus.

This is where a character "voluntarily" decides to be quiet, removing themselves from the argument/conversation. This can be through defeat (being proven wrong), threat, everyone staring at them accusingly or suggestion, or simply because as the lackey, they were told to.

Common phrases would be "I'll be quiet now" or "Okay, I'll just shut up" or simply trailing off or abruptly falling silent. One key theme of this trope would be that they really do want to talk, but humiliation or perhaps painful humility stops them.

Another form of this is when someone realises they're babbling, are clearly making a losing argument, realizing that they have embarrassed themselves or someone else by Saying Too Much or just saying something profoundly stupid and/or offensive, losing track of their analogy and/or are getting increasingly off topic, ending their spiel with "I'll just shut up now".

See also That Came Out Wrong and Digging Yourself Deeper for the reasons people may end up shutting up and Chewbacca Defense for a discussion of why this is an admission of defeat.

    **Kyon:** Part of me wants to say that your reaction to this is incredibly unreasonable. Rather, only you would look at something so incredibly unreasonable, and choose to be so reasonable about it.  
    **Haruhi:** _\[gives a pointed look to the other person in the conversation\]_ I'm the only one who's reasonable? What about your fiancée?

    **The Punisher:** So why am I here? I need time. Time to think. To plan. To question... why? Why couldn't Thomas Jane hang on just a little bit longer? Isn't there something he could have said or done? Doesn't he know that outside, there are countless armies of scum and trash just waiting to kill and maim and rape the innocent—

Like a tiny Big Bang, like a... a... a... b-b-Baby Bang! _\[looks at the faces of the audience looking at her, feels self-conscious\]_ Well, I'm, uh, probably just, uh, stating the very obvious. Shut up, shut up...  
    **Buckaroo:** No, no, it's not obvious at all. If it was obvious, everybody would be doing it every day.
