It's true that beauty isn't untarnished, but when it's considered a burden by those who possess it, sometimes they take some drastic measures to _not_ have it anymore. For whatever reason (the most common one is to avoid unwanted attention, but this can vary) a beautiful character (usually female) takes measures to make themselves _less attractive_ than normal. This can range from simply wearing a mask, choosing plainer looks, cutting their hair shorter to performing plastic surgeries to outright disfiguring or mutilating themselves, the latter of which being treated as an extreme and desperate measure since it's considered a great sacrifice and can be easily Played for Drama.

Depressingly, the latter is also Truth in Television; throughout history in any society where slavery was practiced, being a beautiful slave has never been a desirable position since they were often lusted after by their masters, and rape was disturbingly common. Some women even resorted to scarring their own faces so they would turn away any possible abusers. Of course, the less extreme cases are way more common in normal society: not everyone who is naturally attractive wants to be the center of the attention so they want to downplay their beauty just to fit in better.

For the inverse, see Looks Worth Killing For.

Compare with Life-or-Limb Decision, Evil Makes You Ugly, and So Beautiful, It's a Curse. Extreme versions are considered forms of Self-Harm, though it may happen under Power-Upgrading Deformation (especially when the character in question is very attractive or considers themselves as such). Contrast with She Cleans Up Nicely.
