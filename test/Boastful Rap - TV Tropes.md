_"Yeah, paying the bills with my mad programming skills! Defraggin' my hard drive for thrills!_

_Got me a hundred gigabytes of RAM! I don't feed trolls and I don't read spam._

_Installed a T1 line in my house! Always at my PC double-clickin' on my mizzouse!_

_Upgrade my system at least twice a day, I'm strictly plug-and-play! I ain't afraid of Y2K!_

_I'm down with Bill Gates, I call him 'money' for short. I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support! It's all about the Pentiums, what!"_

Boastful, self-aggrandizing songs occur in all genres, but bragging songs in Hip-Hop — called _braggadocio_ — is a cornerstone of the genre, in a tradition stemming back to before The Golden Age of Hip Hop. It's ubiquitous for rappers to rap about how they're badass, their money, their drugs and guns, who they hang with, how successful they are, how good-looking they are, and how they're really good at rapping.

The reason this is so important to hip-hop is because of the genre's origins as DJ chatter during live party entertainment — a DJ would keep party-goers hyped up by reminding them that they're having the best time at the best party with the best DJ, and giving them as much evidence as possible to make them believe it. Hip-hop, particularly Battle Rapping, is also a descendent of the traditional African-American insult game known as "the dozens", in which players might defend themselves from an opponent's attack by boasting about themselves. The last reason for bragging's popularity is as a reaction to the racism and classism that the working class Black Americans who invented hip-hop were subjected to — bragging is a way of rejecting all the negative stereotypes placed on the rapper, and affirming their power and greatness. Because of this, braggadocio by people who don't face negative stereotypes can come off as bullying — rappers from more privileged backgrounds often avoid brags, play them for laughs or use heel personas to avoid cultural insensitivity.

Compare Bragging Theme Tune and A Wild Rapper Appears!. A lot of songs that may appear to be about other topics are really just braggadocio songs using Unusual Dysphemism — most commonly, songs about gang violence as a metaphor for being the best at rapping. If sung by an antagonistic character, can be considered a Villain Song. Also compare Battle Rapping, where boastful rapping is a component of the sub-genre.

    Straight Examples 

-   A few of the Beastie Boys' songs affirm their rapping ability, though it is at times so absurd that it's quite possibly parody ("Got more hits than Sadaharu Oh", from _Paul's Boutique_, indeed).
    -   On that note, Run–D.M.C. did this pretty often too, but no one really cares.
-   Elizabeth Eden Harris, better known as Cupcakke, has a lot of song about this.
-   Regal Pinion's "Clockwork Seraph" is this. As well as "Secret Keys". The song "More Grim Grimoire" can be seen as a deconstruction since he slowly delves into lamenting that he can't improve since there is no one better than himself.
-   N.W.A. Sort of. They popularized all this.
-   House of Pain also likes them.
-   Kanye West and Estelle: "American Boy", in which Kanye brags about his fame and fashion sense, with Estelle complimenting him for good measure.
    
    -   More from Kanye:
    
    DON'T LET ME INTO MY ZONE! DON'T LET ME INTO MY ZONE! DON'T LET ME INTO MY ZONE! I'M DEFINITELY IN MY ZONE!
    
-   Ludacris: "Stand Up", bragging about his various club antics and including the memorable line "Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless, feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace"
    
    -   Ludacris' _Rollout_ is someone in amazement of his loot, mixed with telling the media to stop hounding him.
    -   In fact, a B-side on his first album is called "Mouthing Off":
    
    They call me Seymour Butts, cause I get mo' ass than most
    
    They say I'm next and got that butter love, and get too close
    
-   Rihanna, "Hard"
-   The Binary Star song "Honest Expression" is largely a reaction to this trope; an extended tirade about how everybody who makes Boastful Rap songs is a poser who is killing hip-hop.
-   Knuckles the Echidna gets into the act in _Sonic Adventure_, trying to convince us that he didn't chuckle in every single one of his _Sonic 3_ appearances, or that he has any form of visible musculature.
-   Most of HP Baxxter's song lyrics have something to do with his superiority as a rapper.
    -   Scooter do have a lot of haters, especially since they started relying on squeaky voiced choruses all the time. So you'll have an odd situation where in the verses HP is rapping about his brilliance and originality and the chorus is a squeaky voiced rendition of a well known song. Then again, this is quite common in classic hip hop.
-   Jimmy's rap from _Dreamgirls_, which immediately leads to the firing of Jimmy.
-   Sushi K's rap in _Snow Crash_. Which is frighteningly terrible and ironically contrasted with a murder carried out by Raven, described in-book as the baddest-ass motherfucker in the world.
-   About half of Jedi Mind Tricks' discography, but "Serenity In Murder" deserves a honorary mention for the line
    
    _"Vinnie vicious like a werewolf at night/  
    I could go to the woods and kill a bear with my mic"_
    
-   A lot of Missy Elliott's songs are this trope.
-   Timbaland's _Kill Yourself_.
-   Prince's "My Name Is Prince."
-   TechN9ne has a few, but most notably He's A Mental Giant.
    
    Giant robot make you feel very low shank
    
    I am so hot, in my skills there be propane
    
    Why I'm gon' squash them and kill every poor thing
    
    Cause I'm a huge, Pillsbury dough mane
    
-   MIMS' "This Is Why I'm Hot". He's hot 'cause he's fly, and you ain't cause you not.
-   Let's be honest here — hip-hop itself largely consists of this trope, especially in The '80s and The '90s. Artists like Rakim, the various members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Big L, and more perfected the Boastful Rap. Doesn't stop a lot of it from being Awesome Music, though.
    -   This is true, particularly for Big L. He personified this trope. Just look up the lyrics to any one of his songs.
-   _Look Pimpin_ from _MadWorld_, as sung by the final boss, The Black Baron (stop staring). There's also _You Don't Know Me_, which was based around the lady bosses (Elise and Rin-Rin). Not based on anyone, but still a boast of power, is _Ain't That Funny_, the Great Wall Street theme.
-   Even the poster boys of Wangst aren't exempt from this. See Linkin Park's "Step Up" and "High Voltage". The band's rapper continues this trend with Fort Minor's "Remember the Name".
-   My power towers like the Eiffel/ Believe I got the right pull/ My vision is insightful/ You look you get an eye-full...
-   Bradley Nowell of Sublime was fond of these, the most famous probably being from the song "What I Got" 'I can play guitar like a motherfuckin riot.'
-   _LL Cool J_'s battles with _Kool Moe Dee_ were the stuff of Hip-Hop legend.
-   Lil B has claimed to be God, Bill Clinton, the Devil, Paris Hilton, Hugh Hefner, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Mel Gibson, and Ellen Degeneres and to look like Jesus, Bill Gates mixed with Barack Obama, and the pope. He also called himself "The Based God," whatever that means.
-   Lupe Fiasco's "Superstar" was a surprising deconstruction of this trope. Though he wasn't parodying those who boast, it was definitely more about the insecurities and loneliness that come from 'gangsta' celebrity rather than the perks, fame, and money.
-   Jay-Z
-   Likewise Jay-Z's predecessor Big Daddy Kane
-   Bender from _Futurama_ is fond of these
-   Olive from _A.N.T. Farm_ spits fire on the M-I-C mostly about her genius-like talents 
-   _Teen Witch_ has a trio of white boys rap against the titular character's best friend who all of a sudden starts rapping boastfully as a result of her friend's witch powers.
-   Dutch rapper Brainpower has "Mijn Manier".
    
    -   Translated:
    
    I live life, but especially in my own way
    
    And do the ground tremble but my way
    
    Write my texts but on my way
    
    And put me vulnerable, do it my way
    
-   iCarly during the party scenes of _iParty with Victorious_ is a good example of this trope. However, Sam and Rex are the only characters that don't make Tupac roll over in his grave.
    -   Subverted by Robbie who gets knocked unconscious by an angry crowd member before he can make a presumably poor attempt of a Boastful Rap.
-   Chris Brown's "Look at Me Now".
-   DJ Khaled's _All I Do Is Win_ might be one of the straightest examples to hit the charts in recent years. Features guest spots from T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and Rick Ross, and every single one of them is attempting to one-up each other.
-   Mickey Avalon's _My Dick_ is all about the comparative size of the artist's genitals.
-   Name one Pitbull song that either doesn't fit this trope to a T or is about partying in the club.
    -   "Castle Made of Sand" from Planet Pit does come close to averting this trope — it does have a few brags but is much more about his past, his mother and how he grew up without a father.
-   That said, Flo Rida isn't much better with this trope. Most of his bigger songs fit it very well, most notably "Club Can't Handle Me" and "Good Feeling".
-   I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
-   "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is an amusing example that still plays the trope straight. Most boastful raps focus on how wealthy and stylish the rapper is. This song brags about how great the rapper looks despite having no money and "wearing your granddad's clothes."
-   LMFAO's "Sexy and I Know It."
-   The Black Eyed Peas do this sometimes, like "Boom Boom Pow" and "Imma Be." Fergie does this too ("Fergalicious," anyone?).
-   Don McCloskey's "Return of the Freak MC" starts off with him mock-complaining about how folk-singers brag about how much money they have, how many banjos they play, before launching into a song about how broke AND awesome he is.
-   "Remember the Name" by Fort Minor (Mike Shinoda and Styles of Beyond working together), in which each artist gets two verses. They proceed to describe themselves in a distinctly self-satisfied fashion.
-   Cher Lloyd's "Swagger Jagger". A white British girl rapping about how awesome she is and how everyone's trying to jack her swag, to the tune of "Oh My Darling, Clementine". It's exactly as ridiculous as it sounds.
-   While most of Bad Lip Reading's "(Rockin') All Nite Long" is silly like their other works, Wiz Khalifa lays one straight line that stands out.
    
    _"'Bout to get raw, bells gotta ring, I'm a alchemist, the beat is my base metal..."_
    
-   Here is a boastful rap about representing your culture, set to a 2pac beat. It's called "Got Rice?" by Joey Lo Flow (usually stylized as AZN Pride). Also to ponder, the Asian rapper's gratuitous use of the N-word.
    
    "Got rice, bitch? Got rice? Got food, got soup, got spice?  
    Got brains like us? Got skills like us?  
    Fuck no hell you white, you'll never be like us."
    
-   Childish Gambino's "Freaks and Geeks", "Bonfire", "Sunrise", and "Sweatpants". "Worldstar" is set up like one, but is actually about the sadistic aspects of web culture.
-   Meghan Trainor has some songs off her second album, _Thank You_, with elements of these, with her verse in "Watch Me Do" being perhaps the best example, with some singing blended in.
-   Ken Ashcorp does this in "20 Percent Cooler", except with Ponies.
    
    _You can call me the king or the ruler,_
    
    _Felon on Bass, getting hoarse on the mic,_
    
    _We're getting 20 Percent Cooler..._
    
-   _All over the place_ in _Hamilton_. George Washington gets one ("Right Hand Man"), John Laurens gets a couple of verses (in "Aaron Burr, Sir" and "My Shot"), Hercules Mulligan and the Marquis du Lafayette get a verse in those two plus a few more (in "Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)" and "Guns and Ships" respectively), and Alexander Hamilton himself gets nearly _three full songs_ ("My Shot", "Non-Stop", and "Hurricane").
-   Bruno Mars' 2016 return track, by the name of "24K Magic", is a prime example, with lines like "I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket" and even a line as abrasive as "Bad bitches and your ugly ass friends". And yet, with his epic swagger and moves, he still has the capability to do it without leaving most fans disgusted.
-   Deconstructed by The Weeknd's "Starboy." From the beginning, he notes that these types of songs are arrogant and self-worshipping ("I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah"). While the song points out luxuries such as his massive salary and fancy cars, Abel also indicates that he feels Lonely at the Top and that he has to indulge in luxuries and his trademark drug addiction to distract from that pain. The line "Look what you've done" in the chorus confirms that he's not entirely happy about his newfound fame and he's resentful of the public for making him famous in the first place. The music video supports this, as it involves the _Starboy_ Abel killing off his previous _Beauty Behind the Madness_ self, then destroying all the awards and fancy suits that fame brought him.
-   Miles Davis' hip hop album _Doo-Bop_ featured a bit of this, but the trumpeter left the rapping to album producer Easy Mo Bee and his crew, Rappin' Is Fundamental; who kicked boastful raps about Miles' legendary trumpet skills.
-   The song "Legend Has It" by rap duo Run the Jewels is entirely made up of these, even cracking a joke about it when the tail end of one of El-P's boasts is abruptly cut off by a bored female voice (actually that of his wife) telling him to quit it.
    
    _I'm fuckin' magic in fact I'm a warlock of talk_
    
    _I got a unicorn horn for a—_ (stop)
    
-   Subverted in "Surface pressure" from Disney's Encanto. Luisa starts out rapping about how strong and though she is, but quickly reveals that she is breaking down from the pressure of having to fix everything in the village and fear of failing the people who depend on her.
-   This is how MC Hammer starts "You Can't Touch This".
    
    My, my, my, my  
    Music hits me so hard  
    Makes me say "Oh, my Lord  
    Thank you for blessing me  
    With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet"  
    It feels good when you know you're down  
    A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown  
    And I'm known as such  
    And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch
    
-   In _Turning Red_, the song "Nobody Like U" contains one about Robaire's attractiveness.

"Facts Machine" by mat4yo includes the line: "It's a fact the eternal fire in Iraq can't hold a candle to the fire in my raps."

    Parodies 

-   Toyed with by Insane Clown Posse, who boast about things like sex with obese women and having magic powers in a parody of the boastful rap style. The following quote from "Take Me Away" sums it up:
    
    But to anybody here I can promise you this  
    You'll never hear us rap about the typical bullshit  
    Pimpin', all the money they got  
    All the ice they wear and all the people they shot  
    All the chicks they pullin' all the cars they drive  
    Only we'd rap about fucking a beehive!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
-   The ICP's fellow Detroit Horrorcore artist/rival Eminem borrowed this trick, spending much of his early albums boasting about having multiple sexually transmitted diseases, drunk-driving, being addicted to every drug in existence, having a drug-addicted, abusive slut as a mother, being mentally ill, and being raped by his school teacher as a child. His later albums, after his Creator Recovery, involve more straightforward boasting, but almost always in a playful tone. Eminem (talking about "Rap God", one of his Signature Songs) once claimed that whenever he feels he's boasting too much, he always wants to blend it in with Self-Deprecation or Self-Parody to better reflect his own personality.
-   From The Lonely Island:
    -   "I'm On a Boat", featuring T-Pain.
    -   "Natalie's Rap". Natalie Portman is fucking _scary_.
    -   "Like a Boss", which just turns into something else entirely. It's a parody of, what else, Slim Thug's "Like a Boss".
    -   "We're Back!", which brags about erectile dysfunction, amongst other things.
    -   "Jack Sparrow" starts out as one of these, but is derailed by Michael Bolton, who's been marathoning the _Pirates of the Caribbean_ movies. The boys attempt to regain control of the song — and fail. Though getting him to change the subject to _Scarface (1983)_ makes it mildly more appropriate.
    -   "Watch Me Do Me", wherein the "I'ma do me" in rap is taken a _wee_ bit too seriously.
    -   "We'll Kill U", in which two incredibly non-threatening white nerds brag about how they'll kill you in a completely deadpan, bored fashion.
    -   "I'm So Humble" from _Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping_. It's about how the singer has everything and is completely amazing, and is also totally humble in spite of that.
-   "Pixie Rap", from _The Fairly Oddparents_. To make it even funnier, it's performed by Method Man and Redman, who are well accustomed to doing this with the upmost sincerity.
-   "I'm a Gangsta", which is from a dorky white kid.
-   This rap video with, out of all people, _Taylor Swift_. Also featuring T-Pain.
-   P.D.Q. Bach's "Classical Rap," as recorded by Grandmaster Flab and the Hoople Funkharmonic:
    
    I'm the apex, I'm the best. I'm considerably better than all the rest.
    
-   "White And Nerdy" by "Weird Al" Yankovic.
    
    There's no killer app I haven't run  
    At Pascal well I'm number 1  
    Do vector calculus just for fun...
    
    -   Weird Al's earlier offering, All About the Pentiums, arguably fits this trope even better.
    
    I'm down with Bill Gates, I call him "Money" for short  
    I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support
    
-   50 Cent did "Window Shopper" with a video that featured super-imposed pricetags on every piece of product placement. Lily Allen then did "Nan You're A Window Shopper" which reversed and parodied the original.
-   In 1984, "The Rappin' Duke" was John Wayne claiming to be the first rapper.
-   "Gangnam Style" by PSY. The narrator brags about his luxurious life style, while the video reveals the inaccuracies. For example, PSY appears to be lounging on beach, but he's actually on a playground; he brags about his wealth while sitting on the toilet, and so on.
    -   Gangnam is a wealthy part of Seoul, South Korea. The main line is "Oppan \[Big brother is\] Gangnam Style" — the song is effectively from the viewpoint of a man who thinks he's hot stuff because he lives like someone there, but really doesn't have what it takes. (South Korea has some of the highest credit card debt on the planet; living way beyond your means is a common problem.)
-   "The Shadow of Def" by Brave Saint Saturn.
    
    Master of beats and the cross-fader,  
    I'll cut off your hand just like Darth Vader.  
    You step to me, you're gonna get dissed, homeboy.
    
    -   For a better Star Wars reference, try the second Star Wars Gangsta Rap, which is about the Rebels and Empire having a rap battle. **ROLL UP ON YER PLANET, DEATH STAR DRIVE-BY!**
-   Jon Lajoie's Everyday Normal Guy talks about how normal he is.
    
    I'm just a regular everyday normal guy...Nothin' special bout me motherfucker.
    
    I'm just a regular everyday normal guy...When I go to the club I wait in line motherfucker.
    
    I'm just a regular everyday normal guy...I got $600 in the bank motherfucker
    
    I'm just a regular everyday normal guy...And my sexual performances are average.
    
    "I buy a lot of expensive thing because I have a lot of money. You can't afford expensive things because you don't have a lot of money"
    
    "When I show women my money they want to have sex with me, and they always have orgasms because my penis is so big, 25 inches long and 12 inches thick"
    
-   "Pace, Precision, Power", which is a boastful rap about Pro Evolution Soccer.
-   Flobots' "Handlebars" is a deconstruction of the boastful rap, starting with childlike bragging ("I can ride my bike with no handlebars") and culminating in some pretty scary stuff ("I can end the planet in a holocaust").
-   Jaden's Rap from Yu Gi Ohthe Abridged Series
-   Spose's song, fittingly titled "I'm Awesome", talks about how he still lives in his mom's basement, only made friends online because he's way too shy in real life but talks to himself on his Facebook wall despite that, never works out, is too poor to eat at Subway, his lyrics are ghostwritten — by his little sister nonetheless, can't roll blunts despite smoking weed all the time, has a dead-end job, is horribly out of fashion, and drinks light beer.
-   Hot Chip's "The Warning" parodies it with a chorus that'd sound threatening, if only it weren't delivered in a mild-mannered voice more reminiscent of John Arbuckle than Jay-Z...
    
    Hot Chip will break your legs
    
    Snap off your head
    
    Hot Chip will put you down
    
    Under the ground
    
-   Ever heard anyone rap about being a freelance Final Cut Pro editor? You have now.
-   Every Wrestler in GLOW did this before every match, including the one that would become WWE's Ivory. The parody came from most of the roster being stock Foreign Wrestling Heel.
-   The Veronicas "Popular".
-   The Rap Critic raps about this in his music video "Oh, Really?":
-   Tinie Tempah's "Pass Out" is half straight example, half Affectionate Parody. The hook is standard if arguably lame Boastful Rap about partying and drinking and getting all the women, but the verses contain bizarre, uncool boasts like "I got so many clothes I keep them in my aunt's house" and "I'm pissed I never got to fly on a Concorde / I been Southampton but I've never been to Scunthorpe". (Note: for Americans unsure about those English towns, know that they are both desperately uncool.)
-   There are mock rap battles in _Homestuck_ (of course), including the lamest and best in the history of Paradox Space.
    -   At one point, Tavros attempts to troll Dave by performing a Boastful Rap ("'Cause I'm your bully, and you're not in charge"), but unintentionally keeps making it homoerotic, much to Tavros's chagrin.
-   On _Whose Line Is It Anyway?_ Wayne Brady and Brad Sherwood once did a rap song about being an astronaut. "We're gonna blast off out of this place / And we're gonna drag your butt to outer space! And if you do not like it I do not care / Because I told you once, I'm breathing BOTTLED AIR!"
-   The _SCP Foundation_ has an epic rap battle between SCP-076-2 and SCP-682.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   The episode "New Kids on the Blech," where Bart is reading aloud from the song they're to sing (sort-of rap, like the Boy Bands do):
        
        **Bart**: "Party Posse, we rule the earth, / The greatest band since music's birth?"  
        **Nelson**: Isn't this song a little boastful?  
        **Milhouse**: No one told me there was going to be boasting.
        
    -   In "The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show", Poochie's introduction when he first appears on Itchy and Scratchy has one.
    -   Referenced when Homer turns paparrazo and tries to provoke champion boxer Drederick Tatum to violence, which actually just takes the following words.
        
        **Tatum:** Yes, hello, what can I do for you, my handsome friend?  
        **Homer:** Your hip-hop album was boastful and unnecessary!  
        _\[Pause\]_  
        **Tatum:** _\[rolls up sleeves\]_ OK, here we go.
        
-   Epic Rap Battle by Rhett & Link is pretty much a boasting competition.
-   Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer's "Straight Out Of Surrey" is a boastful rap about what an awesome cricketer he is.
-   The Midnight Beast's song "Medium Pimpin'" consists entirely of them bragging about how _average_ they and their possessions are.
    -   Their parody of "Tik Tok" counts as this as well, such as Stefan bragging, "I stay up 'till eleven when my curfew is ten".
-   The opening of "(My Name Is) Macbeth" by Mitch Benn (the _Too Late To Cancel_ live bonus track version):
    
    Grab your seats when I grab my quill, yo,
    
    I drop bombs when I write my plays, bitch.
    
    Using my skills and my talent with grammar ta,
    
-   Rappin' Rodney somehow managed to boast about how little respect he gets.
-   Professor Elemental has "Splendid", where he pleasantly raps about how his life is great and he's "really pleased". "Fighting Trousers", his diss song, is a more aggressive, but still silly, take on this, full of attacks on Mr. B The Gentleman Rhymer
-   The "Celtic Boast Battle" from _Horrible Histories_. Charles II's "King of Bling" rap also has some boastful elements, as Charles brags about his popularity and even lists the names of several women he's slept with. Then there's Marcus Licinius Crassus, although if anyone can brag about how rich they are, it's him:
    
    _There's Romans think they're minted, but they ain't rich like me!_  
    _You can't call yourself loaded till you can buy an army!_  
    _Ran Rome with Pompey and Caesar, they're more famous than me,_  
    _But I'm the world's richest geezer, there's no-one richer than me!_
    
-   Played straight (assuming Poe's Law doesn't apply) in Dave Stdider Pokemon Traner when Dave needs to open a door that only opens to rappers. Then parodied when Karkat tried the same thing.
    
    **Karkat:**  
    im kitkat and dvea sux  
    and im awesome  
    and i hate dvae becuz he is lame  
    dave is dumb
    
    -   Jack Noir doesn't do much better.
        
        **Jack Noir:**  
        my name is jack noir  
        and i can rap  
        in a car  
        beneath teh stars  
        in a bar  
        during a war
        
-   Dormtainment parodies the tendency for rappers to rap about how "hood" they are in their video "Straight Outta Dunwoody"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> :
    
    Straight outta Dunwoody  
    Riding my Suburban in the suburbs  
    And I talk proper  
    Never use curse words.
    
    -   They parody it again in "6 Guys 1 Honda"
        
        6 deep ridin' with a broken window (it's hot)  
        A broken AC got our foreheads damp  
        And a 5 minute ride equals 5 leg cramps.
        
-   Every episode of _Epic Rap Battles of History_ involves at least some of this, with the notable exceptions of "Napoleon vs. Napoleon" and "Adam vs. Eve".
-   The Digital Underground song "The Humpty Dance" is a humorous example if not an outright parody.
-   "Deadpool - A Blurred Lines Parody", done by D Piddy, basically turns that song into one of these, centered on the titular character.
-   _Pokémon: The Mew-sical_ has Brock's song, which is a rap about how he's a chick magnet using Pokemon-themed words. It's... not entirely accurate.
-   Die Antwoord has "Rich Bitch," which (like most of the group's material) plays as an Affectionate Parody of the genre as Yo-Landi Vi$$er boasts about, among other things, eating sandwiches with thickly spread Nutella.
-   Remy's "Arlington: The Rap" is among the better examples of parody raps about the alleged badass-ness of wealthy, largely white suburbs.
-   "NASA Johnson Style" is a parody of "Gangnam Style", obviously, but is boasting about NASA's achievements in space exploration and sciences instead.
-   "Java Life" glorifies the life of a Java programmer.
-   Likewise, "This Is Engineering" by Kavi Patel riffs off "Thrift Shop" (see above) and is an only slightly embellished account from the life of STEM specialists.
-   "Dungeons & Dragons: Rap Edition" from Mann Shorts has a Dungeon Master break into a rap song about his dungeon-mastering prowess after getting fed up with his players.
-   The lyrics for "Whales" by Hail Mary Mallon just lists off a ton of exorbitant, ridiculous things and repeats "money" over and over to make the band _sound_ rich. Taken even further by the music video, where the song is performed by a couple of broke randos sitting in an alley.
    
    Money on my motherfucking mind
    
    Cop five haircuts at the same time
    
    White gold pants, Jet Ski made of Yuan
    
    Foie gras bust of Albert Einstein
    
    Get Money
    
-   Mischa Bachinski's first character song of _Ride the Cyclone_, "This Song is Awesome," certainly fits the bill. Living unhappily with his adoptive parents in a podunk mining town in Northern Saskatchewan, Mischa aspired to become a famous, wealthy rapper so as to escape the poverty and boredom of his life (at least he _did_, before dying in a roller coaster accident). He even had a youtube page where he published his raps under the name stage name "Bad Egg." His song evokes the style of mid-2000's Hip-Hop, complete with gratuitous Auto-Tune over Mischa's heavy Ukrainian accent as he describes his imagined riches.
    
    Lounging with my homies, Friday night scene  
    PlayStation's up on my 60-inch screen.  
    McNuggets in the bag, Cristal's on tap,  
    new toothbrush from Tiffany's still in the bubble wrap.  
    Track lights glowing like nuclear sciences  
    sparkling all over my stainless steel appliances.  
    I'm shinning like Midas, I'm the king of ka-ching,  
    everything I touch goes bling-bling-bling!
    
-   _I'm Cappin_ by Mon$ter and Big Flock
    
    I don't do none of that shit, I be rappin'  
    I just be cappin', I just be rappin'  
    I don't want smoke with a motherfucking soul  
    I ain't in the streets, bitch I don't get active  
    Fuck do you mean? I ain't got opps  
    Lil nigga stop, you niggas can have it  
    I ain't no drug lord, never seen a brick or bust open a motherfucking package  
    I don't do no crime, nigga no lie, to be real with you niggas, I'm average  
    Run a small business, I don't sell drugs, to be honest, I'm pretty established
