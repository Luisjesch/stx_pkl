...Not exactly...

_"I've lost people before, so when I care about someone, I put a tracking device on them."_

A tracking device is a piece of Applied Phlebotinum that broadcasts its location, and is used to follow the individual or vehicle it's been secretly planted on. Occasionally the individual discovers the device and uses it to lead the trackers on a Wild Goose Chase.

Tracking devices can also be intentionally used by characters on the same side to keep tabs on each other, so that if somebody gets kidnapped, his friends will immediately know where he is. Of course, a bad guy who happens to _find_ a tracking device used for this purpose could easily use it as a Red Herring.

Most tracking or surveillance devices depicted in fiction are so small that they cannot include important components such as a power source, antenna, microphones, etc. This used to seem like magical tech back in the day, but as Technology Marches On with the advent of mobile phones that allow tracking by cell tower, and USB Pen Drive-sized GPS trackers, extremely miniature tracking devices are rapidly becoming Truth in Television. Indeed, it probably won't be long before any tracking device that _isn't_ miniscule qualifies as an Incredibly Obvious Bug, if it doesn't already.

Compare the Sub-Trope Tracking Chip, when a tracking device is implanted.

For the magical equivalent, see the Tracking Spell.

-   _Eden_: It appears all robots have a tracking device as standard equipment. And they know it's there, because A37 and E92 intentionally break off their transmitter antennas so they can't be found or followed when they take Sara to a place where they suspect she can be raised safely.

        **Orac:** Of course I can!  
        **Avon:** Where is it, then?  
        **Orac:** Under the box which is ten centimeters from your right hand.

He's unknowingly swallowed a tracer, and they launch missiles on his position when the signal shows he hasn't moved for a while, assuming that's the rebel base. It turns out that he was just waiting at a rendezvous point, and the rebels were waiting for the cover of night before going to collect him.

-   _Daredevil (2015)_
    -   In Season 3, Wilson Fisk is under house arrest and has to wear a leg monitor that will sound an alarm if he goes outside his designated area. However Fisk has had a secret room constructed _underneath_ his bedroom from which he can control his criminal empire, making it look as if he's never left the room. Whenever he has to go elsewhere, he has a woman who works in the secret room wear the monitor instead (she's being coerced into working for Fisk, so she's more of a prisoner than he is).
    -   In Season 2, the Hand abduct a group of people who have been saved by Daredevil.

-   _Ginny and Georgia_: Georgia puts a tracker in Austin's watch when he's with his dad, whom she doesn't trust.
-   In _Healer_ most of the tracking devices are very small and well disguised like the ones in Jung Hoo's watch and necklace. The tracking devices he attaches to cars are rather conspicuous things about the size of a nickle with a small blinking red light. This is probably just so that the audience doesn't need it spelled out for them what he's doing every time he uses one.
-   _Intergalactic_: All of the prisoners have them implanted in their bodies, and they're painfully removed on Pau Rosa when they put down there so Commonworld authorities can't find them.
-   _JAG_: Used by Clayton Webb in his first dealing with Harm and Mac to track their car in "We The People". However, they're savvy enough to leave it.
-   When the war arc of _Kamen Rider Build_ starts, Gentoku had tracking bracelets made for Sento and Ryuga that contain personal GPS to keep track of where they are and a two-way communication link so that Gentoku can reach them at any point.

-   In the _Leverage_ episode "The Stork Job", Hardison reveals when Parker goes off on her own that he put a GPS tracker in her shoes. It's implied that he keeps tabs on the entire team this way all the time. He also often uses the various magical earpieces that they have for this purpose as well. Fitting this trope those devices are sufficiently small that there is no way that they could ever really work.
-   _Line of Duty_: In Series 6 it turns out the Chief Constable ordered trackers placed on all AC-12 vehicles, letting them quickly locate Jo and Kate after they go on the run as they're been driving one which Steve provided with keys for an emergency.
-   Tracking fobs play an important role in _The Mandalorian_, used by Bounty Hunters (including the title character) to track their targets.

-   In the _Miami Vice_ episode "Tale of the Goat," Tubbs attaches a tracking device to the underside of a truck he's riding in. It falls off, and when Crockett tries to follow him, he finds the device lying in the road.
-   _Monarch: Legacy of Monsters_: In his retirement at a Monarch\-run Gilded Cage, Lee Shaw is forced to wear an electronic tracking anklet at all times. Justified, as not only was the anklet provided by a covert group who have an unlimited spending budget, but this part of the series takes place in 2015, when tracking devices were becoming more and more real, _and_ the actual anklet has a rather blocky electronic box on it.
-   Often used on _NCIS_, for the agents themselves to be rescued or just followed, or suspects or criminals.
-   _NCIS: Los Angeles_ has a tracking _spray_ variant that's used to follow a terrorist to his hideout.
-   _Once Upon a Time_: Bo Peep, who was a warlord in the Enchanted Forest, "branded" her victims with magic, which allowed her to use her shepherd's crook to track her victims.

-   _The Pact_: Anna installs a tracking app to locate the phone of the person who called her for blackmail, which lets her find out her friend Nancy did it.
-   _Person of Interest_
    -   Team Machine usually does this by hacking the mobile phone of the Victim of the Week and using its GPS locator. Finch is quite proud when he hacks an Artificial Limb into giving away its position to every phone repeater it passes. Finch is Properly Paranoid about this himself; it's no surprise when he smashes a $2 million watch given to Team Machine by a grateful billionaire to remove its GPS locator.
    -   Though they still fall victim to them on more than one occasion. Notably Root and the FBI each manage find them at different points. Root with a classical tracking device, and the FBI by a brute force attack on their phone system.
    -   Root steals an indestructible Kevlar briefcase, but can't break into it to remove the tracking device. She resorts to using a lamp to short it out, but the former owners are already kicking down the door.
-   _The Professionals_. In "Servant Of Two Masters", Cowley has fallen under suspicion of corruption and Bodie and Doyle are ordered to investigate. At one point they are leaning on Cowley's car as he briefs them for their next assignment, causing them to stumble when he abruptly drives off. Bodie then smirks that he got his own back by using the opportunity to plant a 'bleeper' on the car. Cowley however switches cars as a routine precaution, forcing Bodie to follow him the old-fashioned way. The same trick is used in "The Acorn Syndrome", and Bodie barely has time to attach a bleeper to the second vehicle as it drives off.

-   _Star Trek_:
    -   The commbadges that Starfleeters wear starting in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ double as trackers.
    -   In _Star Trek: Picard_, Commodore Oh gives Jurati a tracking device which she's actually required to chew before swallowing, causing it to dissolve into her body. When she realises a hostile spacecraft is using it to track them, her first urge is to vomit (she was also Post-Stress Overeating at the time). This has no effect, so she injects herself with a lethal neurotoxin to neutralize the tracking agent. Fortunately her colleagues are able to revive her.
-   _Titans (2018)_
    -   Dick Grayson tells Donna Troy to track Kory Anders, so she throws a shuriken with a tracker into the back of her car as it drives off, which sends a signal to an app on her mobile.
        
        **Donna:** You think you're the only one with gadgets?

When the homing device is separated from the temporal wrist controls worn by the time traveler, the wearer of the ring is automatically returned to their point of departure. Fitzgerald uses this to send John F. Kennedy forward in time to 2172 so that he doesn't have to be assassinated.

-   As part of his release agreement with the FBI, Neal Caffrey of _White Collar_ has to wear an ankle tracking bracelet at all times (until his 4-year term is up, anyway). He cannot leave a 2-mile radius of his home (which, fortunately for him, is in Manhattan) except with an FBI escort, and if he tries to remove it without authorization (occasionally given as part of an operation), it sends out a signal.
-   _The Wire_: The opening of the second season episode "Storm Warnings" is a Hard-Work Montage where we see, among other things, members of the Major Crimes Unit hanging tracking devices on vehicles owned by their latest targets.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Battlelords of the 23rd Century_ supplement _Lock-N-Load: The Battlelord's War Manual_. The Electronic Tracer Device has an adhesive strip that allows it to be secured to an object, such as a vehicle. It broadcasts a low frequency radio signal for up to 120 hours that can be detected up to 7 kilometers away.
-   _Champions_ Organization Book 2 _PRIMUS and DEMON_. The included adventure notes that PRIMUS (an anti-villain U.S. Government agency) puts a transponder inside all captured supervillain devices to assist in tracking them down if they go missing.
-   Iron Crown Enterprises _Cyberspace_ main rules
    -   The Homing Device is a constantly broadcasting high frequency transmitter implanted in a living creature (such as a human being). It can only broadcast a few kilometers away.
    -   The Arm Sentry is a small device strapped to the arm of guests in corporate areas. It constantly broadcasts its position to the company security computer. If the wearer enters an area they're not authorized to be in, the computer sounds an alarm.
    -   The Tracer is a transmitting device that is either worn or implanted. They can be traced over great distances by ground-based or satellites. All corporate and government personnel have these implanted in their bodies so they can be recovered in case they're kidnapped or become lost.
-   _DC Heroes_. One piece of equipment characters can buy is a "tracer", a small radio transmitter that sends out a steady signal that can be picked up by a receiver. It has a maximum range of 5 miles.
-   _Shadowrun_ has the AOD (Activate On Demand) tracking signal. It only transmits when it receives a specific coded signal, which means it cannot be detected by standard radio detection techniques except when it is actually transmitting.
-   _Victoriana RPG_ supplement _Faulkner's Millinery and Miscellanea_. One possible Complication (drawback) for a magical clockwork limb is a tracer device implanted in it, which allows someone to know where you are at all times.

    Video Games

-   _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_: When Sora is eventually captured by the bad guys, they reveal that Master Xehanort can magically track down any "X", like the X on Sora's shirt.
-   In _Mass Effect 2_, after you acquire the Reaper IFF chip, it installs a virus into the Normandy's computer that broadcasts its current location. Which results in the kidnapping of all of your crew except Joker. Kinda makes the Paragon choice in the endgame (to destroy the Collector Base rather than reverse-engineer it) seem the right one: if a mere chip made by the Reapers could outsmart the best AI humans could produce, what would an entire base do?
    -   _Mass Effect 3_ has Miranda plant a tracer on Kai Leng on Sanctuary, leading Shepard directly to Cerberus's main base. The spoiler for _2_ is also revealed to be fairly irrelevant. Even if blown up, enough of the base remains that Cerberus undertakes major salvage operations and some degree of indoctrination and so on happens anyway.
-   Franziska plants one of these on her incompetent detective partner Gumshoe in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All_, much to Gumshoe's displeasure.
-   In _Secret Agent Barbie_, Barbie has a gadget which is basically tracking _perfume_.

    **Fortiscue:** Oh...shucks.
    
-   This strip of _Irregular Webcomic!_.
-   In _Rank Amateur_, GELF are officially required to wear these. They were generally fitted to GELF even _before_ it became law.

-   In _Yokoka's Quest_, Yokoka, Yfa, and Mao are magically tracked using the ribbon weapons that Vivi gives them.

    Web Original 

-   _Lobo (Webseries)_: Lobo was given this from Stumpy to track down Mudboy the Porkan.
-   _Whateley Universe_:

    Western Animation 

-   Also played for laughs in _Invader Zim_, where the "tracking device" turns out to be GIR clinging to the back of Dib's enormous head.
-   Played for laughs in an episode of _Jackie Chan Adventures_. An episode that involves clones of the heroes has Captain Black place a tracking device on one of the Jackies. He starts bragging about it before the real Jackie points out that it's on him instead of the escaped clone. Jackie then forgets to take it off, allowing Jade to track him down.
-   _Kim Possible_ sometimes uses various kinds of trackers, including tracking powder (got in the vent system of the building). Wade also has one on Ron, just because.
-   _The Loud House_: In "The Spies Who Loved Me", Carl plants a tracking device (which his dad apparently sawed onto his jacket) on Ronnie Anne’s backpack so they can keep an eye on her without her knowing. However, the device falls out of it when Ronnie Anne takes her skateboard out of her backpack, and gets stuck to a rat.
-   _Skull Island (2023)_: The initial antagonists of the series are Private Military Contractors who kidnapped Annie from an Isle of Giant Horrors neighboring the titular island, before she escaped them and ended up with a boat crew, and they all get stranded on Skull Island.

-   _Space Ghost_ episode "Homing Device". Before the episode starts Jace puts the title homing device on Blip's collar so he and Jan can always find him. Blip stows away on the Phantom Cruiser when Space Ghost goes to surrender to Metallus, allowing Jan and Jace to follow them.
-   1973-74 _Super Friends_ episode "The Planet Splitter". The Super Friends put microdot homing devices on the remaining 100+ carat diamonds so they can be tracked down after they're stolen. At the end of the episode, Wendy puts Wonder Dog on a diet, them puts a microdot homing device on one of his favorite steak bones so they can track it when he steals it.
-   Also in _SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron_. Hard Drive and Dark Kat stole the Turbo Kat and used it to commit crimes and frame the heroes. They demanded several bags of money. Commander Feral hid a tracking device in one of them. The bad guys throw away a bag (presumably the one with the tracking device) and, using a device to impersonate T-Bone's voice, said "Nice try, Feral!"

    Real Life 

-   Modern cellular phones have GPS receivers in them to provide locations during emergency calls. Some offer tracking services that allow account holders to keep track of their children, or track a lost or stolen phone.
    -   Sadly, these capabilities are also increasingly used for more nefarious purposes.
    -   Whether or not turning off the GPS feature of the phone _actually_ deactivates tracking or just hides it from applications on the phone itself (but not from the service provider) is up to the phone manufacturer. In any event, even without GPS, if the phone is communicating at all with the cell system, the phone company can tell the maximum possible distance the phone can be from any given cell tower by measuring the strength of the return signal; the phone must be within the region where the possible locations from each cell tower getting a signal from that phone overlap. In an area with a fairly dense network of cell towers (such as a city), this can typically locate the phone to within a radius of 50 meters or so. Such communications happen regularly even when you're not actively using the phone, so if you _really_ want to hide, put it in "airplane mode" (which supposedly disables all wireless communications) or, if you're too paranoid to rely on that, remove the battery or put it in a Faraday cage.
    -   Key finders become more powerful when they transmit not to just one particular phone, but any phone in the vicinity. Apple's AirTag works very well in regions with plenty of iOS devices going around, and the upcoming Google's Grogu would have even wider coverage due to Android's ubiquitous presence. There are safeguards in place to discourage its use by stalkers (warning someone if a new tracker has been following them, audible alarm if it's not connected to the owner's device for a prolonged period), but they can be worked around (eg, removing the speaker and targeting someone outside the ecosystem, since currently, Apple's tracker won't warn Android user) and unlike smartwatches, trackers are far cheaper and can last for a year on a single button battery.
-   US vs. Jones resulted in a decision that, within the USA, use of such a device without a warrant may violate 4th amendment rights.
-   There are systems that can track stolen motor vehicles. LoJack and Onstar are two of the best known.
-   A smaller-scale form of tracking can be used to find a misplaced cell phone by calling it so that it rings or using an app/webpage to make its alarm tone go off and then follow the sound.
