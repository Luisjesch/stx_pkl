All together now (but very quietly): "AWWWWWWWWWWW"

_"In the terminal she sleeps on my shoulder  
Hair falling forward, mouth all askew."_

A Ship Tease shot of two characters — the Official Couple, the official not-a-couple, or just two of the shippers' favorites — sleeping together. In the literal sense. They're fully clothed, probably in a public place in broad daylight, one's head pillowed on the other's shoulder, chest, stomach, or possibly lap. Maybe they were sitting through something really boring, had a Post-Victory Collapse, or were knocked unconscious in just the right position by an attack or some magic backfiring. Or, most simply, they just fell asleep because they were tired.

In any case, it serves one purpose: the perfect opportunity for viewers near and far to simultaneously say, "Awww, they look so cute together!"

Of course, this doesn't have to be romantic. A pair of siblings, a parent and child, very close friends, et cetera can also pull off a sort of Sleep Cute. Either way, it is a strong source of good, happy feelings and a very good Go-to-Sleep Ending. A big Tear Jerker variant is to have the "sleeping" characters be _dead_, overlapping with Together in Death. May also overlap Clingy Sleepers.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _7 Seeds_: Koruri and Haru are outside of the teams' established 'village' and talk, with Haru holding Koruri's hands to warm them up. The two end up falling asleep in that position until morning.
-   _Ace Attorney (2016)_: Maya lies this way on Phoenix during a train ride after "Reunion and Turnabout."
-   _Ai Yori Aoshi_: Happens on the train. Only Aoi was asleep, though. They wind up riding past the stop and all the way around again, because Kaoru couldn't wake her.
-   _AKIRA_: Subverted in the manga. Yes, Kaori looks sweet and peaceful when she sleeps with her head on Tetsuo's lap, but then we see that Tetsuo is in extreme pain and his arm is mutating again.
-   _Angelic Layer_: Played with in the 2nd ending, which shows Deuses sleeping with their Angels.
-   _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_: The reason why Hideyoshi Kinoshita gets a kiss from Akihisa Yoshii. Or in a dream, at least.
-   _Berserk_: this is done not once, but twice in regards to Guts and Jill (the village girl during the Fairy Arc). Once when she first decides to start following him, and finds him asleep. She then curls up and sleeps in his lap. Another when they fell off a cliff while he protected her from demonic spirits, only for him to wake up later and tell her to get off him since she's heavy. While it can be perceived as Precocious Crush, it’s more likely Jill is seeing him as father substitute and thus more comfortable around Guts.
-   _Betrayal Knows My Name_: In episode 5, Yuki wakes up to find Luka sleeping on his shoulder.
-   _Bleach_: In chapter 408 we see Michiru and Chizuru sleeping in Karakura Town with Michiru resting her head against Chizuru.

-   _Brave10_: Isamai does this with Saizo while on a horse!
-   _Case Closed_:
    -   This tends to be played straight once in a while. But it's once memorably subverted in a filler episode when Ran turns in her sleep, facing Conan... and while she looks pretty cute in her sleep, he is very distracted by how her robe's cleavage is rather revealing.
    -   In a hilarious take on the trope, Conan once went with the Detective Boys to watch a movie, and was seated between Ayumi and Ai. Halfway through the movie, both girls fell asleep on his shoulders, putting him an incredibly awkward situation, as he needed to go to the bathroom at that moment, and couldn't bring himself to stand up and wake them.
-   _Ceres, Celestial Legend_: Aya and Tooya fall into this trope as they ride a train back home. Cue the news that Aya is pregnant, and fangirls go "Squeeeeeee!"
-   _CLANNAD_: at the end of Fuko's arc, where Tomoya and Nagisa end up sleeping side by side as you see in the page image. Of course, they're the Official Couple.
-   _Claudine_: A very fatigued and cold Maura falls asleep on Claude's shoulder right after arriving at the de Montesse home on a rainy day.
-   _Code Geass: Akito the Exiled_: Julius - who is actually Brainwashed and Crazy Lelouch - and Suzaku end up in this position. Surprising, considering their relationship is Doomed by Canon (_Akito_ takes place in between seasons 1 and 2 of _Code Geass_).
-   _Cross Game_: Kou and Aoba, all the sweeter since if Aoba had woken up first, Kou would have been a _dead man._
-   _D.Gray-Man_: This happens to Allen and Lenalee. Poor Johnny.
-   _Darker than Black_: In season 2, Suou and July are repeat offenders of this trope<small>◊</small>. Toy Ship ensues.
-   _Digimon Adventure 02_: Happens with Daisuke and Ken, on a train, during the credits of the movie, _Diaboromon Strikes Back_. Just watch the shippers go nuts.
-   _Dirty Pair Flash_: This happens to Heterosexual Life-Partners Kei and Yuri in the beach volleyball episode, when they're exhausted from another day of Training from Hell.
-   _Durarara!!_: Walker and Erika pull this off in the last episode. Despite the fact that they're the resident Torture Technicians of the show, it's adorable as hell.
-   _Et Cetera_: Mingchao awakens in her hotel room to find the place trashed. Baskerville and Benkate are sleeping beside each other against the wall, and she wonders at first if they had fought over who got to sleep on the bed. But then she notices how peaceful and relaxed they are, with Benkate leaning against Baskerville.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   When Elfman is recovering after his winning battle with Bacchus in the Grand Magic Games, Evergreen, who has been watching over him in the infirmary, falls asleep on his chest at one point. He blushes and makes no attempt to rouse her.
    -   The 7th OVA shows a more sisterly-like version, with Cana and Wendy, who end up falling asleep together sitting by the trunk of a tree, both of them with a smile on their faces.
-   _Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu_ has a non-romantic example at the end of the Onsen Episode, where Kaname and Tessa sleep side-by-side. It's absolutely adorable.
-   In Episode 40 of _Futari wa Pretty Cure_, Nagisa and Honoka share a bed and hold hands while asleep.
-   _Gate_: Rory, Lelei and Tuka are seen like this during the first ending song.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_ features a scene with the entire class piled on top of each other like this.
-   Kageyama and Hinata in _Haikyuu!!_ on the bus ride back from the first day of the Inter-high competition. This only happens in the manga however, prompting many fans to jokingly say the panel was 'too gay' for the animators to handle. However, this didn't stop the anime from showing Nishinoya sleeping on Tanaka's shoulder in Episode 19.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_
    -   In the novels, Mikuru Asahina and Haruhi are seen sleeping peacefully like that. It _does_ give a good impression of their friendship, given that poor Mikuru usually is nothing more than an abuse doll for Haruhi. Kyon also comments on it, and also says that they could "rival each other \[in looks\] right now". Then he later remarks that that's because her mouth was shut, and she wasn't being her bossy self. This also happens in the second season of the anime in the second part of "Endless Eight".
-   _Hajimete no Aku_: Featured when Jiro falls asleep on Kyouko, after staying up all night protecting her from mosquitoes.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    -   Lithuania, exhausted from being overworked by his boss Russia, unintentionally falls asleep on a couch only to wake up to find himself beside Russia, who _for once_ is in a genuinely good mood and gently asks him about what he's been dreaming of.
    -   Subverted with Greece and Japan. It _looks_ like Greece is gonna pull this on Japan... but after dozing off a little, he wakes up and acts like nothing happened.
    -   Done in the _Hetalia Bloodbath 2010_, where the kidnapped nations are found sleeping in various places. But the cutest has to go to Russia, Prussia and Austria.
    -   Still in _Hetalia Bloodbath 2011_, Italy sleeping with his head on Germany's lap.
    -   In _Hetaween 2011_, where Wy falls asleep and Australia carries her home on his back.
        -   The Hetaween 2013 gives us a young Hong Kong sleeping next to Victorian England<small>◊</small> with tears hanging from his closed eyes.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry Kai_: The final episode has a very cute scene of Rika and Hanyuu sleeping together. Combined with what they do upon waking up (namely turning the calendar to July 1).
-   _Hitomi-chan Is Shy with Strangers_: After going to the water park, Yuu and Hitomi fall asleep next to each other on the train. Yuu's sister Kaoru takes a photo to tease them with later.
-   _Houkago Play_: Happens in this<small>◊</small> 4koma.
-   _I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying_: Double Subverted when Kaoru snuggles up next to her husband after an episode long Flashback Nightmare, only for him to roll over in his sleep and whack her in the head. As the credits play, it jumps to them in various positions (including both of them with their upper bodies completely off the bed), but it ends with the two of them next to each other again.
-   _Ichaicha Suru to Okane ga Waichau Futari no Hanashi_: Aki and Hanasaki already sleep next to each other relatively often, but usually not touching. In Chapter 9.5, Hanasaki cuddles up next to Aki and falls asleep. He wakes up, thinks he's dreaming, and cuddles her back. When they wake up, there's a lot more money than usual.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _The Idolmaster_:
    -   Miki throughout the first quarter of the show,
    -   All the girls (except the ones that are part of the Ryuugu Komachi unit) after the end of their first live.
-   _Im At End Of Your Sight_: Dong-ha and Je-Hyung in the first chapter. Dong-ha asks if they can sleep together and, after some persuading, Je-Hyung agrees and has Dong-ha hug him from behind.
-   Happens repeatedly in _Insomniacs After School_, starting with the first chapter. Magari admits early on that she has trouble sleeping without Nakami around, and quickly realizes nothing helps her sleep more than listening to his heartbeat.
-   _K_: The main trio (Shiro, Kuroh, and Neko) are often shown this way in official art.
-   _K-On!_: _All_ the girls of the band do this after their last concert, since they still practiced till very late the night before.
-   _Kimi ni Todoke_: Sawako falls asleep against Kazehaya's shoulder in an early episode (although he was still conscious). Later, Chizu and Ryu also fall asleep together.
-   _Komi Can't Communicate_: At the end of the Kyoto field trip, Komi falls asleep on the train ride home. Her field trip buddies manipulate Tadano into sitting next to her on the train so she ends up sleeping on his shoulder.
-   _Kyo Kara Maoh!_: Yuuri falls asleep and Wolfram lets him lean on his shoulder<small>◊</small> and smiles.
-   _Madlax_: Madlax and Vanessa pull it off _twice_, raising the Les Yay to an almost Girls' Love level. Madlax/Limelda shippers disagree, though.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_: The last episode has Subaru and Teana doing this after the final mission, together with a mother and daughter variation with Nanoha and Vivio. Earlier on, Nanoha invokes this when Vivio starts whimpering in her sleep by putting her next to a still sleeping Fate.
    -   In the movie adaptation of _A's_, Lindy finds Nanoha and Fate propped up next to each other after the Wolkenritter drain their Linker Cores. Since they originally passed out on the ground several yards away from each other, it's implied that the Wolkenritter actually moved them there.
-   _Marginal #4_, with twins L and R. They fall asleep this way in the car after their debut concert in the first episode.
-   In the third ending theme for _My Hero Academia_, we can see Midoriya and Uraraka both asleep on a bus while resting their heads on Iida's shoulders (and he's also asleep). It's cute and edges slightly into Threesome Subtext.
-   _My-HiME_:

-   There are two beds in Mikoto and Mai's room, but the two girls are often snuggled up together, including during the closing shot of the end credits. In the second-to-last omake, they both have smiles on their faces when they're sleeping. During the Tamayura festival episode, Mikoto sleep-rolls _out of her own bed_ and finds her way onto Mai's. It's hard to believe Mikoto wasn't doing so intentionally, but still...
-   In the manga, of course, this is out of necessity — there are still two beds, but the room is shared with Yuuichi, who naturally gets his own bed. (Although it's implied that they previously slept in the same bed anyway.)

-   _My Heavenly Hockey Club_: Happens in Volume 2 with Hana and Izumi.
-   _Nabari no Ou_: In the 2nd ED, Yoite and Miharu. They may not actually be an Official Couple, but... hey, fun with Ho Yay!
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Happens with Asuna and Negi on the way back from the school trip. "Cute couple, eh?" one spectator says. "There will be time for that later," another replies.
    -   Konoka and Setsuna slump into this during the same trip back, as well.
    -   On another occasion, Negi falls asleep on Konoka's lap, leading to Ayaka jumping to conclusions in hilarious fashion.
    -   And on another occasion Negi falls asleep in Ayaka's lap, leading her to declare that it is the best school festival ever. The poor guy just needs to stop overworking himself.
    -   And he falls asleep again in Chachamaru's lap. He is just that cute and overworked folks.
    -   The anime's credits have the cast sleeping cutely in a non-shipping context.
-   Played with in the manga version of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, where Shinji and Asuka are shown to be this after defeating Israfel, while still inside their Eva units, both of which are crumpled over one another.
-   _Nisekoi_: This happens in chapter 144 between Kosaki Onodara and Raku Ichijo. After spending a weekend together in a bath house, being too tense around one another to properly talk (or really do anything together) they have a Sleep Cute\[1\]<small>◊</small> moment together on the bus back home.
-   _Noir_ took this to then-new heights, including several classic There Is Only One Bed scenes, all of which were played completely straight (and quite sweetly).
-   _One Piece_:
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
-   _The Prince of Tennis_: Happens to Ryoma and his best friend Momoshiro. And the Yaoi Fangirls rejoiced.
-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_: At the end of the Sisters War arc, the five Nakanos end up falling asleep in the bus back home. Fuutarou ends up snapping a photo of them for the photo album he was making as a birthday present.
-   _Ranma ½_: In episode 124, Sentarô and Satsuki meet and it's love at first sight. They stare at each other for so long that Ranma and Akane, waiting for them to actually say something, fall asleep, resting against each other until the next morning.

-   _Requiem of the Rose King_: Henry and Richard get a lot of cute moments<small>◊</small> sleeping while cuddled together.<small>◊</small>
-   _The Rose of Versailles_: The manga features a scene where André is reading the newspaper while seated next to Oscar. Oscar falls asleep on his lap due to sheer exhaustion. André is delighted to say the least. They had not become a couple yet.
-   _Sakura Trick_: This happens with the two main characters in the first chapter. Amusingly, it's during the entrance ceremony.
-   _Seven Days (2007)_: Happens to Yuzuru and Seryou on their date in Volume 1.
-   _Slam Dunk_: There's a chapter and equivalent episode where the main five fall asleep in a heap in the locker room after a particularly tiring game. Yes, the Ho Yay fangirl squees could be heard across the globe.
-   _Snow White with the Red Hair_:
    -   As a night of drinking and talking wears on Obi wakes to find his very heavily hinted and implied Bodyguard Crush Zen sleeping with his head on Obi's lap and his confirmed Bodyguard Crush Shirayuki sleeping next to Zen on the floor. After some mumbled whining about not being able to get up he arranged a sleep cute of his own by placing the former right next to the later.
    -   Shirayuki falls asleep against Zen after a period while the Pharmacy was overworked, leaving him holding her there trying not to wake her up until Mitsuhide finds them and Zen realizes it would be bad for just about anyone to see them in such a potentially compromising position.
    -   Izana gets Zen drunk and he proceeds to fall asleep on a couch next to Shirayuki, who also falls fast asleep as she had been working hard and not getting enough rest. When Kiki, Mitsuhide and Obi find them Obi talks the other knights into putting them both in Zen's bed, causing Zen to fall out of bed when he turns his head and finds Shirayuki there.
    -   In an odd variation both Shirayuki and Zen have noticed that Obi is comfortable enough around them that he often falls asleep near them while he's not on duty, and find it endearing.
-   _Spiral_: Happens in the manga and anime with hero Ayumu and sidekick Hiyono; the thing is, he's very aloof and she's the stereotypical annoyingly cheery air-head, but they've just saved each other's lives and he hasn't slept much in two days, so he _asks_ to sleep on her shoulder. While calling her annoying. Probably the cutest moment of the entire anime, though the manga topped it when it started fixing romantic entanglements.
-   _Sword Art Online_: In season 2 <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Yui is sleeping peacefully on top of the baby dragon Pina, which is curled up on Kirito's chest, as Kirito is sleeping peacefully in his chair. The sweet sight is so peaceful that all the girls studying want to join in.
    -   What made Asuna _actually_ fall in love with Kirito was finding him peacefully asleep (instead of helping plan the next raid) because it was such a nice day.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: after a long day of breaking through to the surface and fighting beastmen, Yoko finds Kamina and Simon sleeping together, with Kamina protectively wrapping an arm around his his "brother"<small>◊</small>.
-   _The Tower of Druaga: Aegis of Uruk_ shows Jil and Kaaya asleep at a train station in the closing shot of the Alternate Universe opening. Also sets up some strange self-referential imagery, what with a poster for _itself_ behind them.
-   _Trigun_: Happens to Wolfwood and Milly. (From Wolfwood to Milly: "You're comfortable.") This makes Meryl and Vash have to sit next to one another as they express annoyance at their companions' behavior.
-   Happens in a chapter that crossed over between _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_ and _Xxx HO Li C_, with adorable mascot Mokonas Soel and Larg.
-   _Twin Spica_: This happens between Asumi and Marika during the grueling closed-environment test, which might have been the trigger for Marika's defrosting process.
-   _Utawarerumono_: Non-shipping example in episode 8, with Aruruu, Yuzuha, and Kamyu sleeping on top of Mukkuru.
-   _Yotsuba&!_: The Beach Episode ends with a panel showing the entire group slumped into each other, asleep, on the train back home. There's an extra "The End" panel showing that Koiwai has slid onto the floor...
-   _You Are Totally in Love With Me, Aren't You?_: Sayaka and Mako in Chapter 5 are sleeping together in Sayaka's room. However, Sayaka is not amused by this and immediately asks Mako if she did something funny to her. Mako denies it, but the end of the chapter shows that she took a picture of Sayaka's sleeping face.
-   _You're Under Arrest!_: Miyuki and Natsumi fall asleep together in their patrol car at the end of OVA episode 2, "Tokyo Typhoon Rally". By the end of the OVA series, they've moved in together — to save on expenses and travel time. Poor "Kenny" Nakajima might die of hemorrhagic shock before his nose quits bleeding. Afterward too, since all the official art is a complete and utter explosion of Les Yay...
-   Judai and Asuka of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ wake up like this after the group is teleported back to Earth in a first season episode. _cough_\*Ship Tease\*_cough_
-   Viktor falls asleep on Yuri twice during _Yuri!!! on Ice_: First on a plane ride, and later in bed when he's trying to get Yuri to nap before a competition.

    Arts 

-   Non romantic example; the twin Classical Mythology gods Hypnos (God of Sleep) and Thanatos (God of Death) are often seen in this kind of position in art. It's really cute<small>◊</small>.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman: Black and White_, "A Matter of Trust": A doctor friend of Bruce's talks him into babysitting her young sons when she has to go deal with a medical emergency and can't get a sitter at short notice. He and the boys completely fail to get on intially, but when she gets home she finds Bruce asleep with the two boys curled up asleep in his lap.
-   A familial version pops up in _Jem and the Holograms (IDW)_. While in the hospital Aja stares at her three sisters sleeping in a group. She notes they look cute and Kimber's sleep bubble even says "cute sleeping".
-   _The Question_: A platonic version occurs between Vic Sage and Renee Montoya when they fall asleep on a long plane ride and Vic slumps onto Renee's shoulder. It's kind of cute considering how much time they spend bickering and snarking at each other when awake.
-   In the last issue of _Runaways_, Molly and Klara fall asleep with their heads in Karolina's lap.
    -   Another Runaways story by the same writer, "It's Not Lupus", ends with Molly and Klara cuddled up after a long day of pony-related hallucinations.
-   In a scene towards the end of _Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together_, Scott, Stephen, and Joseph are recording a song, while in the background, Kim and Ramona are shown to have fallen asleep (presumably from boredom), with Kim's head on Ramona's shoulder.
-   This happens, of all places, in a _Sin City_ story. Miho, the resident Dark Action Girl, falls asleep on the lap of Dwight McCarthy in the story "Family Values". This is sandwiched between scenes in which Miho carves up an entire mob family.
-   In a non-romantic example, Spider-Man and Spider-Girl get a father-daughter version of this. It's even sweeter in context, having come after an issue where they spent most of their time bickering at each other before reuniting an Ex-Villain and his daughter.
-   In a _Superman_ comic, Supes and Wonder Woman do this after a difficult battle, prompting Lois Lane to observe the two of them and make an aside to the audience that it's a good thing that she's not a jealous woman. (This is used mostly to note Lois' Character Development, because she _was_ jealous of Supes' and Diana's relationship not that long before this story.)

    Comic Strips 

-   Parodied in a 1989 _FoxTrot_ strip (and an obvious non-shipping example, since they're brother and sister). During a long plane trip, Paige falls asleep on Jason's head. Luckily, this quickly stirs the both of them awake and causes them to scream in terror.
-   _Phoebe and Her Unicorn_: The last panel of this Christmas strip has Phoebe and Marigold adorably curled up together.

    Fan Works 

-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfic _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_: There is at least one shot of Germany, Italy, and Japan sleeping together quite cutely.
-   _Bridge to Terabithia 2: The Last Time_: Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke, now at college-age, sometimes does this, notably in the one chapter when Mr. Burke gives Jess and his daughter a lift back from the airport.
    
    _A few minutes later, Bill looked into the rear view mirror and found the two teenagers sleeping quietly, Leslie's head resting on Jess' shoulders while his was atop her head. It was a cute sight that made him smile to. He couldn't believe how fast times were changing now..._
    
-   _Doing It Right This Time_, a _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ fanfic: In the first story draft, Misato comes home and finds Shinji, Asuka and Rei fast asleep and cuddling up together. She finds them so absolutely adorable her doubts about a three-ways relationship working vanishing... and she slinks away to find a camera and take pictures.
    
    _The Children were curled up together on the sofa. Asuka was propped under Shinji's arm while Rei was lying across both their laps. All three of them were fast asleep._  
    _They looked so utterly adorable that Misato's few lingering doubts about Asuka's grand plan were banished entirely. She decided to leave them undisturbed, and tiptoed off to bed... but not before she got her camera._
    
-   In _FREAKIN GENSOKYO_, Ha-chan frequently tries to invoke this with Brad, usually without his consent.
-   A non-romantic example in the _Back to the Future_ fanfic _Ich Liebe Dich_: Doc drifts off when they are checking the future photograph, and Marty falls asleep curled up against him.
-   This _Dragon Ball GT_ fanart.
-   Icecry's _Parallel Saga_ (a _Dragon Ball Z_ fan comic) has Goku, Bulma, and Gohan (who in this alternate universe is the illegitimate son of Goku and Bulma) sleeping in the same bed like one, big, happy family.
-   _Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past_: The Gryffindor Six each get one in Chapter 22, when the combination of cold weather and heated air conditioning on the train makes them all nod off against each other.
-   _Team 8_, a _Naruto_ fanfic:
    -   Happens accidentally with Naruto and Hinata; Hinata can't keep her eyes open and nods off, her head against Naruto's shoulder, while Naruto is too panicked to move an inch because of this. Simultaneously played for laughs, cuteness, and drama; Hinata was forced by her father into abusive "family training" the night before, and was sleep deprived as a result, but Shino still finds Naruto's reaction hilarious.
    -   Happens again in the Forest of Death, when Hinata falls asleep on Naruto's shoulder after he's left comatose during the fight with Orochimaru.
-   _Destiny's Pawn_. a _Star Wars_ fanfic, has it in the Kashyyyk chapter. The entire party is holed up in Jolee's cabin for the night. Bastila notices the sleeping arrangements of Kairi (Revan), Mission, and Carth with dismay.
    
    Bastila struggled for sleep, but found it would not come. Across the fire pit, she saw Kairi sleeping between Mission and Carth. The Twi'lek girl and Kairi were face-to-face, Mission's blue hand clasping Kairi's. Poor girl. Bastila knew she was deeply hurt by the loss of her constant companion, and there was little doubt that being alone and asleep in Taris's Lower City was a gamble at best. As for Carth, he had fallen asleep on his stomach, one arm flung around Kairi's shoulders. With a muffled grumble, he shifted to his side and used one arm as a pillow. He wasn't spooning with Kairi... yet... but his hand sleepily groped around until he found Kairi's and Mission's, and topped their hands with his. As much as he claimed he trusted no one during the day, he could hold no secrets in sleep. He already had bonded to them, perhaps irrecoverably. What else could go wrong with this assignment?
    
-   _Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit_ have had this treatment by an _Epic Mickey_ fan. Super adorable.
-   Subverted in _Total Drama Battlegrounds_ when Joel and Daisy cuddle together in their sleep. The others tease them in the morning about it, while they say it has nothing to do with romance. Sure enough, they both wind up paired with other people.
-   _Finding Dad_ has one such scene where Phineas and Isabella fall asleep on the bus to Charlotte.
-   Shinji and Asuka at the end of _Evangelion RE-TAKE_. It's a very minimalistic example, since their fingers are only barely touching the other's, but for them, it's an extremely meaningful show of affection.
-   Marche and Montblanc sleeping together from the Game Boy Advance video game _Final Fantasy Tactics Advance_.
-   In _The Hunger Games_ fanfiction _Some Semblance of Meaning_, this trope eventually comes into play with Vale and Obsidian. Even before that, it was used in a more platonic, sibling-like example with Vale and her district partner Kit. The open trust that this action displayed was one of the things that kept Obsidian from killing them when he came across them one night in the arena while they were asleep.
-   Navarone does this with several ponies in _Diaries of a Madman_. When he and Rainbow Dash get teased over this due to a Not What It Looks Like situation, he's quick to point this out to them.
-   _Vinyl and Octavia Get Incredibly Drunk_, featuring a fan favorite couple from _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, ends with Octavia drunkenly calling for Vinyl to come into her bed and cuddle her, since she doesn't want to sleep alone. Vinyl obliges, of course.
-   _Nightfall_ Fancomic: Vriska finds John sleeping on the couch and curls up next to him.
-   A platonic example in the _Sherlock Holmes_ fanfic _Simple Gifts_: the feverish Watson grabs Holmes' hand in his delirium, and the detective can't bring himself to pull away. He ultimately settles down next to him upon realizing the doctor won't let go. Unfortunately for Holmes, the maid comes in early the next morning and wakes him up with a fit of giggles.
-   A non-romantic example in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ fanfic _Retribution_ : After the two make up, Kirk falls asleep against Spock as he meditates. Spock doesn't mind, until McCoy wanders in and snaps a photo.
-   Another non-romantic example in the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ fanfic _Memories Born of Fire_. The tired Spock falls asleep on Kirk's shoulder, where he was resting to reassure himself after a Flashback Nightmare.
-   Yet another non-romantic example from the _Star Wars_ fanfic _Youngling_. While there are several examples, the best has to be from chapter 3, after Obi-Wan has found the currently three-year-old Anakin and they are en route back to Coruscant. The second Jedi who went with Obi-Wan on the rescue mission finds the two sleeping in the medcentre, Anakin using his master's cloak as a blanket and arm as a pillow.
-   This happens later in _Hope for the Heartless_ to Avalina and the Horned King (who are a case of Intergenerational Friendship). It's significant because the latter is a lich and unable to sleep at all. He falls asleep for the first time in a millennium while admiring stars in Avalina's garden after losing his Walking Wasteland ability.
-   Lydia and BJ cuddle up for warmth in the backseat of the convertible while on the run in _Cinderjuice_.
-   _Blood That Flows_: When Lina sees her daughter Nanoha, Fate and Yuuno sleeping on the same bed, she thinks that they're incredibly cute.

-   A strictly platonic example in _Remnant Inferis: DOOM_. After suffering through a horrific Nightmare Sequence, Ruby decides to go sleep in the same room as the Slayer, and seeing the way he sleeps sitting on the floor against the wall she joins him and nods off against his shoulder.

Bedding down in one area to conserve heat and energy is decided on, but when the time comes to actually try and sleep, the Loroi choose to pile up on and around Alex, partly because his body temperature is higher than theirs and so everyone will stay warmer, and partly because he's blind to their innate telepathic abilities and it's theorized that he'll insulate the Loroi from each other. All well and good, but a couple of them look happy with the arrangement for other reasons.
