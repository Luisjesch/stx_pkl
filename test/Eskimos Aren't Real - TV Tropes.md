_"BAHAHAHA! What?! You think narwhals are real?! Like there are just whales with magical horns poking out of their heads? HAHAHA! Are y'all hearing this right now?!"_

This is when someone, usually an Insufferable Imbecile, The Ditz or the Cloudcuckoolander, is ignorant, confused, or ill-informed enough to lump "things that are well known to be real" in with "things that are made up." This is often applied to ethnic groups, but can also include historical characters, countries, and animals.

Essentially, Arbitrary Skepticism applied to _real_ things, likely by someone who Cannot Tell Fiction from Reality, an in-universe occurrence of Aluminum Christmas Trees. The name of the trope comes from the tendency of average Europeans in the 19th Century to not believe the tales which Arctic explorers brought back about the Inuit peoples. This was because said tales sounded a lot like those which explorers of earlier eras had told, which then turned out not to be true in the slightest.

A Sub-Trope of Reality Is Unrealistic. A Sister Trope to Global Ignorance and Flat-Earth Atheist. Compare Legend Fades to Myth, when something that was once considered common knowledge is distorted by the passage of time to the point that it can no longer be believed with 100% certainty. Contrast Faeries Don't Believe in Humans, Either. Not to be confused with Canada Does Not Exist.

-   In year 2 of _Azumanga Daioh_, Tomo reveals that she doesn't believe that reindeer exist. Naturally, the way Tomo's disbelief in reindeer came up is that the girls had just been discussing Santa Claus. Kagura then asks if reindeer are real, and Tomo proceeds to laugh at her and say they don't exist.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  When Chiyo, Sakaki, _and_ Osaka all confirm that reindeer are indeed real, Tomo freaks out and tries to reassure everyone that she's not stupid.

-   In the _Rivers of London_ story "Monday Monday", one of the rookie constables thought the town of Scunthorpe was something made up for comedy routines. This doesn't thrill her partner, who grew up there.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Get Fuzzy_:
    -   In a Christmas strip where Satchel is waiting for Santa, Rob tells him that Santa is probably flying over Canada at the moment. Bucky claims that there is no such place as Canada, saying, "So you see a couple of flannel-wearing hockey fans that mispronounce the word 'offense' and you automatically believe there's some other country? Next you'll tell me you pay taxes." Rob replies that he does indeed pay his taxes.
    -   When Rob decides to try out a new recipe for Belgian ale, Satchel says, "I thought Belgium was a made-up place, like Hobbiton or Hoboken."
    -   Bucky tries to tell Satchel that Hawaii is a myth, like "tough liberals or the Canadian Army". When Rob informed him otherwise, he reacted with genuine surprise, "It is?? Then why the %\*(# DON'T WE LIVE THERE?"
    -   There's also the time after Satchel's game show, where Bucky states how he believes the _Harry Potter_ books to be lies. When Rob questions whether he is "breaking the story that magic doesn't exist," Bucky responds with "What? No, magic exists, I saw a thing on TV. But trains?... Owls?... ENGLAND? Nice try, I'm not buyin' it." Cue two-hour argument between Rob and Bucky over the existence of England (Canada and Greece, too).
    -   In a later strip, Bucky again claims that owls are a myth, like Abominable Snowmen or Southern Democrats.
    -   Another strip has Satchel wishing Bucky a good Saturday morning, to which Bucky replies that Saturdays are made up by greeting card companies to make money.
-   _Knights of the Dinner Table_: Weird Pete doesn't believe that Papua New Guinea is a real country.
-   _Peanuts_: Lucy Van Pelt once spent several strips mocking Charlie Brown for telling her that birds fly south for the winter: "In all my life, Charlie Brown, I have never met anyone with an imagination like yours!" When Chuck insisted, and also added that they fly north during the summer, Lucy sarcastically retorted that they must fly east during the spring and west during the fall. Then she pressed the issue further with "Chickens are birds, aren't they?! You never see a chicken flying south for the winter, do you?! CHICKENS ARE BIRDS, AREN'T THEY?!" Eventually Lucy learned (from a third party) that Charlie Brown was right about (some) birds flying south for the winter, and had to eat crow.

    Fan Works 

-   _A Darker Path_: Aisha has a hard time believing that Polaroid cameras capable of printing a photo on the spot are really a widely available product rather than Tinker tech. Her older brother is amused.
-   In _Chasing the Rainbow_, ponies believe that lions are fictional.
-   In _Code MENT_, Lelouch claims that British people, despite being one himself, are as fictional as the Wolf Man.
-   In the _Phineas and Ferb_ Character Blog _Doofenshmirtz's Daily Dirt,_ Doof lists Abraham Lincoln among "fictional characters" that people cosplay as.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past_, Ron pokes fun at Luna Lovegood for having an "imaginary creature" as her Patronus. Luna's patronus was a duck-billed platypus. When Hermione tells Ron that the duck-billed platypus is a real animal, he flatly refuses to believe her. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Honey_ Harry and several friends take the Animagus revelation potion and Ron describes his form as a "weird rabbitish thing".
    
    **Ron:** It was orange and about five feet tall, and bounding along a desert somewhere.  
    **Luna:** That's a kangaroo.  
    **Ginny:** Don't be silly, Luna, those don't exist.
    
-   A running gag in _Roommates: Memoirs of the Hairless Ape_, a _Five Nights at Freddy's_ fanfic by The Weaver, is that nobody has ever heard of France or anything French, reacting with bafflement to images of "some kind of A-shaped building" and a special kind of toast. It makes communicating with one of the Freddys, who has suffered aphasia and now only speaks French<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ... difficult.
-   In _Resonance Days_, Sayaka Miki has arrived in the afterlife as Oktavia von Seckendorff, with no memories of her past life. Thus, when someone mentions flying fish, she assumes they're messing with her.
    
    "Besides, fish fly. There's flying fish."
    
    "Oh, very funny," Sayaka snapped. "Look, my personal memory may be gone, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna believe every crap story you make up about the world of the living."
    
    A blanket of awkwardness descended on the group, during which Charlotte and Mami exchanged looks of discomfort. Kyoko, however, just cracked up.
    
    Then Mami cleared her throat and said, "Ah, Oktavia? She's telling the truth."
    
    Another silence followed, and then Oktavia slowly turned her head to stare at the blonde. "What," she said in a flat tone.
    
-   Miss Martian and Superboy in the second chapter of _Scouting_ initially don't believe Superman when he explains to them what the age of consent is. Justified, however, in that the two are Fish out of Water still getting used to human society:
    
    Superman skipped one… two… three beats before replying. "No, I'm not. But while I'm here I'm responsible for you and everyone on the Team. So, while I'm here you will not be going into girls rooms and taking off your clothes, you will not be sneaking off to secluded parts of the Cave to play 'pinch & tickle', and you most definitely will not be having any underage sex!"  
    Superboy raised an eyebrow. "'Underage'?"  
    "You and M'gann are both minors." Clark began to explain
    
-   _Stargazer_: The Eliksni don't really have a concept of twins in their culture. While they have heard rumors of identical siblings existing within other alien species, most like Alkris wrote it off as an exaggerated tale.
-   In _Total Drama Legacy_, Katherine is so sheltered that she never knew virtual-reality games were a real thing until she had to partake in a VR challenge, and just thought they were something in sci-fi stories.
-   _Ultra Fast Pony_ takes place in a weird version of Equestria where some human ethnicities, like blacks and the Irish, undeniably exist.
    -   Nevertheless, the episode "Granny Smith Is Mean" gives us the line:
        
        **Filthy Rich:** And that was when I figured out, Mexicans aren't even real. So you don't have to be afraid anymore, children.
        
    -   And "Pirate Shipping" has:
-   In _Umbridge Goes To The Moon (Or Tries To)_, Umbridge doesn't believe a colleague telling her that Muggle Americans had gone into space and even landed on the moon, thinking Muggles too lowly to accomplish such a thing. That is until Fudge tells her that it's all true, which gets it into her head that if Muggles can go into space, so can Wizards. She ends up dying from suffocation after Apparating into orbit, thanks to not even researching _how_ Muggles go into space and how they need equipment to survive there.
-   "Don't be so naive, Yugi - there's no such thing as 'Egypt.'"
-   A _Steel Ball Run_ fan-comic has Johnny Joestar express to Gyro Zeppelin that the moon is a big flat star rather than a large sphere, the tides aren't caused by the moon's gravity but by "big little fishes", the Earth is flat, and that he doesn't know what planets are. Then again, he is visibly drunk.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Coco_: As Miguel is being escorted to the Land of the Dead with some of his ancestors, he remarks that he always thought the Land of the Dead was just a legend.
    
    **Miguel:** I thought it might have been one of those made-up things that adults tell kids, like... vitamins.  
    **Tía Victoria:** Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.  
    **Miguel:** Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be.
    
-   _Happy Feet Two_: Will the Krill believes "black holes" (whales, actually) are myths to keep people in the swarm.
-   Hal in _Megamind_ says this while mocking Roxanne's idealism: "There is no Easter Bunny, there is no Tooth Fairy, and there is no Queen of England!" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Art of the Steal_: On being told that Bick is an Interpol agent, Francie's reaction is an an incredulous "Interpol's real?!"
-   In _Back to the Future_, Goldie Wilson was working as a simple busboy in a diner, and when he gets the idea to be mayor, the owner Lou scoffs at the idea of a "colored mayor." There had been a number of African-American mayors prior to the film's story line (not that a guy like Lou would be expected to know), but they numbered less than a half dozen, and were in charge of small rural towns; it was not until the 1960s that an African American was elected mayor in a city. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _A Fairly Odd Christmas_: Denzel Crocker didn't believe in North Pole or polar bears before going there and being chased by one. And, yes, this is coming from someone who already believes in Fairy Godparents and Santa Claus.
-   In _Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks_, Krista believes that Neanderthal Man is a myth. Possibly justified given the time period, but still a strange statement from someone studying anthropology.
-   In _The King and I_, the kids have trouble believing that snow is a real thing, until their father the King confirms that it is real. Truth in Television, as the Thai language doesn't even have a word for 'frozen' and in the time frame of the setting uneducated Thais would be likely to believe it was made up. The snow subplot is based on an anecdote of Anna Leonowens that the royal children refused to believe snow was real until she asked the King to give a guest lecture on it.
-   The documentary _Life, Animated_ relates the real-life story of a child with High-Functioning Autism who basically used the Disney Animated Canon as a Translator Buddy between himself and the rest of the world. At the time the movie was made, the child had become an adult in a relationship, and his older brother was interviewed wondering how he's supposed to use Disney movies to give him The Talk. At some point he mentions the concept of "Disney Porn" as if he finds it unlikely to exist. Two words: Rule 34.
-   _The Film Crew_: Kevin Murphy believes in many different fantasy lands, but claims that Spain is a myth.
-   Somewhat averted in _Look Who's Talking Too_. Baby Mikey is sitting awake at night scared. He lists various things he's worried about, and that they aren't real. This includes monsters, ghosts, witches, and dinosaurs. He knows that one of them _used_ to be real, but can't remember which. Justified, since he is a baby.
-   _The Muppets (2011)_: At the start of the movie, Walter is convinced that the stories about the Muppet studio being shut down years ago and only used for tours is just an internet rumor, like how there's a country called Turkey.
-   A Brick Joke in _Shaun of the Dead_ is an argument between Shaun and Ed whether or not the rifle at the Winchester is real. The owner says it is, but he also says dogs can't look up. After the rifle fires, proving Ed right...
    
    **Shaun:** Alright. But dogs _can_ look up!
    
-   _Star Wars:_ An in-universe example: in the original trilogy, the Jedi and the Force itself seem to be widely considered mythical. This ends up creating a lot of friction with prequels, which take place only 19 years before _A New Hope_ and show the Jedi were common knowledge back then. This could still be justified by the Empire's propaganda, con-artists posing as Jedi, and the fact that the Jedi were mostly wiped out by ordinary clone troopers. It makes sense that members of Han's generation would think stories of the Jedi's abilities were greatly exaggerated.

    Literature 

## Authors

-   Isaac Asimov:
    -   "Victory Unintentional": The Jovians insist that there aren't any inner planets (like Earth), so Jupiter and its moons are the closest thing to the sun. This is part of how Isaac Asimov shows their mental inflexibility.
    -   In the story "Nightfall", the planet Lagash has six suns. As such, its inhabitants only experience total natural darkness once every two thousand years, when the suns line up and are eclipsed by the planet's moon. A wacky religious cult claims that there are things called "stars" which can be seen only at this time; the more fringe scientists cautiously agree that there might be more suns in the universe than their own six — maybe a few dozen or so. Normal people think this is bunk. One scientist laments that universal gravity is such a difficult and complex concept. It would have been so much easier to come up with, if only they lived in a simpler solar system. Say one where there was only one sun — but of course that would be impossible. Any planet in such a system would be dark half the time, and life couldn't possibly evolve in so much darkness.
    -   One story takes place entirely on a satellite, where a newly activated robot refuses to believe there would be an entire planet full of humans, instead of just the two protagonists. This robot starts a cult to worship the satellite core. When the protagonists demand a temporary shutdown, they are locked in a room. The satellite gathers solar energy and sends it to Earth as a concentrated beam, straight to a receiver. When the satellite starts shaking, the beam has to be turned off. But the head robot refuses, as it is not the Satellite's will. The humans, detained, consider the vast damage on Earth as the beam goes haywire. But when let out, they discover that the robots have kept the beam perfectly aimed at the receiver. It was the Satellite's will.
-   In more than one Daniel Pinkwater novel, as a throwaway joke, a character claims that Los Angeles does not exist.

## Works

-   In _And Then I Turned Into a Mermaid_, five-year-old Li Jun tells Molly, 'Earthworms aren't real. I'm not _stupid_.'
-   John Hodgman's _The Areas of My Expertise_ has a running gag that Chicago is a myth, mostly as a joke on how very New York the author's sensibilities are. Revisited in the follow-up _That is All_, when the mythical city rises at last from the swamp during the End Times of 2012.
-   _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_: Class F wonder if Shouko is attracted to Mizuki (when she's actually after Yuuji), which Akihisa dismisses as something that only happens in fiction (it's implied he's specifically talking about porn). Minami begs to differ, whereupon we are introduced to her Psycho Lesbian Abhorrent Admirer Miharu.
-   _Catherine, Called Birdy_: Birdy's uncle comes back from the Crusades and tells them about all the wonderful things he's seen, like gryphons and unicorns and something called "an elephant, with a tail at each end". Birdy thinks he's making that last one up.
-   _Dave Barry Slept Here_, in the chapter on World War I, claims that that Serbia "did not, technically, exist," even at the time that Austro-Hungary made the mistake of trying to invade it.
-   _The Day Santa Stopped Believing In Harold_: Discussed when the rumour spreads and people start to think Santa doesn't believe in _children_.
-   In the Otto Prohaska novel _The Emperors Coloured Coat_, Otto is dumbfounded to find that the sea captain of the vessel he's sailing on thinks the world is flat due to his religious beliefs. Even more amazing is how he's able to accurately navigate his ship regardless.
-   In the book _The Enormous Egg_ (wherein a kid in rural New Hampshire finds one of his family's chickens laid a dinosaur egg), one of Nate's friends says that dinosaurs never existed - some guys found some big bones and made up stories about them.
-   Early books in _The Executioner_ series had characters (and even the blurbs for the novels) explaining that The Mafia isn't just an Urban Legend.
-   The Good Soldier Švejk mentions an old priest, who learned that Saint Augustine of Hippo denied the existence of antipodes<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and started harrassing his servant woman, who was getting money from a son in Australia. After he damned her in church he was sent to a nuthouse.
-   In _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, Arthur Dent is forced to deal with the reality of the Earth having been destroyed by the Vogon Constructor Fleet.
    
    _New York has gone. No reaction. He’d never seriously believed it existed anyway._
    
-   _Kate Shugak_: In _Less Than a Treason_, Kate encounters a thug who thinks that wolves are extinct and don't exist anywhere outside of Disney films. He is considerably shocked when his partner is attacked by one.
-   In _The Last Continent_ there's been a millennia-long drought in FourEcks. Some of the settlers have grandparents who say that in The Old Country water used to fall out of the sky, but everyone who grew up there thinks that's ridiculous.
-   Humorist Robert Benchley wrote an article called "Movie Boners" in 1934 (back then, "boner" meant "mistake") where he listed various mistakes from (obviously fictitious) movies. One example was: "In the picture called _Dr. Tanner Can't Eat_ there is a scene laid in Budapest. There is no such place as Budapest." A reader failed to get the joke and wrote a letter to Benchley, criticizing him for not knowing that Budapest is the capital of Hungary. So Benchley wrote another article, "What — No Budapest?", where he asserted: "There is no such place as Budapest. Perhaps you are thinking of Bucharest, and there is no such place as Bucharest, either."
-   In the Piers Anthony story "Possible to Rue", a young boy's pleas for a pet pegasus leads his father to look the animal up in the encyclopedia and show that they're mythical. So are unicorns. To the father's astonishment, so are zebras, mules, and even horses, which he distinctly remembers placing bets on. It's implied that, by denying zebras are real to avoid having to buy one, the father has inadvertently begun erasing these creatures from the universe.
-   In _Rhythm of War_, Raboniel denies the existence of the Surge of Adhesion (the Surge most closely tied to Honor, and the only one that Voidbinding can't access).
-   In Pamela Dean's _The Secret Country_, five children have made up a fairytale world where magic is real. They argue as to whether it's proper to have a Secret Country villain who doesn't believe in magic. Patrick, a materialist, says that would be as foolish as someone in the real world not believing in the law of gravity. His smartass sister Ellen promptly declares that she doesn't believe in the law of gravity. When they are in the real Secret Country, they find this man really doesn't believe in magic, he thinks it's all tricks and illusions.
-   In _A Series of Unfortunate Events_, when Count Olaf meets Dewey Denouement in Book the Twelfth, he's surprised Denouement is a real person, having assumed he was just a legendary figure "like unicorns or Giuseppe Verdi".
-   In _The Silver Chair_, the Lady of the Green Kirtle claims not to believe in lions or any other aspect of the outside world. She's lying, but she nearly bewitches the overlanders into agreeing with her. (This is a typical C. S. Lewis allegory; in order to describe Narnia to the Lady, they have to do so in terms of things that she _does_ accept the existence of, allowing her to dismiss it with "So you made up a bigger version of a cat, and called it a lion", in the same way as heaven can only be described in terms of the mortal world.)
-   In _Small Persons with Wings_, eight-year-old Mellie refuses to believe in anything "imaginative," including the characters from _Little House on the Prairie_.
-   In the _Star Wars_ Expanded Universe book _Med Star I: Battle Surgeons_, cruel, arrogant martial artist Phow Ji refuses to believe in the Force, even when Barriss levitates something using telekinesis right in front of his face, claiming it's just a trick. This disbelief (plus a lot of his contempt towards Jedi) stems from one Jedi playing fair in a martial arts contest by not using the Force, allowing Ji to beat him. Notably when Bariss uses the force to heal him (thus preventing incontrovertible proof) he essentially chooses to commit suicide by proxy rather than live with it.
-   _Wicked_: It's mentioned that oceans are just a myth. This is because Oz is surrounded by desert.
-   _Zeus Is Dead: A Monstrously Inconvenient Adventure_: At the gods' first press conference, Hera specifically states that while the Olympian gods ARE real, other gods such as Thor, Loki, Anubis, and Elvis Presley are not.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In one episode of _30 Rock_, Tracy believes that diabetes is a white myth, "Like Larry Bird, or Colorado." In another episode, his entourage isn't there when he needs them because one of them had to go to the optometrist, and his response is, "Making up words won't save you!"

-   _Derry Girls_: After finding the letter written to the school paper by the lesbian, Orla remarks that she doesn't think that lesbians exist. Later, when handing out the papers to students, Orla is yelling "Lesbians really do exist!"
-   In _Episodes_, a group of Hollywood TV executives discuss a potential premise for their network's vampire style show.

-   _Friends_:
    -   Joey and Chandler are both interested in a visiting Dutch woman. Chandler gets an edge by "guessing" that Dutch people come from somewhere near the Netherlands (the place they really come from). Joey responds, "Nice try. See, the Netherlands are this make-believe place where Peter Pan and Tinkerbell come from", apparently having confused the Netherlands with Neverland.
    -   When Chandler claims that he's moving to Yemen to get rid of Janice, Joey says "'Yemen,' that actually sounds like a real country!"
    -   When Ross becomes obsessed with naming all 50 states, Joey looks at his list and says: "First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!" And that one comes after Joey lists 56 states, including New England and South Oregon.
        
        **Joey:** How can New England not be a state? They have a sports team!

        **Joey:** Someone you didn't make up!

    -   In a flashback in "Existential Crisis", Eleanor's mother is attempting to lie to Eleanor about her dog dying by saying that the dog has traveled by a rainbow bridge to a farm in Guam. Eventually, she snaps and yells:
        
        "...there's no farm, no bridge and no place called Guam!"

    -   On an episode, Robin believed that the North Pole and reindeer were made up. This is especially weird considering where she's from.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   In a later episode, Robin's boyfriend Nick reveals that he thought gypsies "were just made up, like goblins, or trolls, or dolphins."
-   _The InBESTigators_: In "The Case of the Disappearing Deliveries", Kyle doesn't believe that there is a plant called aloe vera.
-   In _The IT Crowd_, Mr Reynholm is interviewed. His favorite non-fictional character is Sherlock Holmes. When he's told that Sherlock is fictional, he tells the interviewer to check her facts. She decides to ask him who his favorite fictional character is, which turns out to be The Elephant Man.

-   In _Legends of Tomorrow_, Vixen considers ninjas to be completely fictional. Granted, the pop culture versions are inaccurate, but they really did exist. She later admits she's wrong when the group time travels to Feudal Japan and they encounter ninjas and samurai. Her skepticism is somewhat justified, as she is from 1942, and while there were plenty of Japanese films featuring ninjas, the concept had not yet exploded into foreign popular culture.

-   One of the Bill Brasky sketches on _Saturday Night Live_ has a barfly state that "The character of Johnny Appleseed was based on Brasky." This may not be intentional, since Johnny Appleseed is so mythologized that it'd be easy even in real life to assume he's just a fictional folk hero.
-   In _Scorpion_, Ray books the team on a flight to San Jose, Costa Rica, instead of San Jose, California, because he says that San Jose, CA is just a myth; it isn't real, like Tallahassee. When told that that's a real place, too, he doesn't believe it.

-   On one episode of _Taskmaster_, Daisy describes high-diving acts, which inspired her approach to one of the tasks<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Greg mocks her for believing such a thing could exist.

    -   The majority of the townsfolk, at the urging of the secret police, do not believe in mountains.

-   In an episode of _Quote, Unquote_, Anthony Horowitz, asked to identify which musical about a famous fictional character the song "The Impossible Dream" came from, suggested _Evita_. It's possible he just misunderstood the question, rather than believing Eva Peron was fictional.

-   Invoked in _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_, when Rosencrantz claims not to believe in England, meaning he has no mental picture of what's going to happen once they get there, and Guildenstern sarcastically replies "Just a conspiracy of cartographers, you mean?" Later they have the same exchange in reverse.

While he could be referring to how Scotland is governed as part of the United Kingdom instead of a sovereign state (although it is _still_ technically considered a different country), it took Soldier several _years_ to figure out he was in Poland instead of Germany, making this trope much more likely (besides, he would be less wrong if he called the Demoman a _Brit_ in a dress). One comic also indicates that he doesn't believe in blood types.
-   In _To the Moon_, Johnny mentions lies that adults made up in his childhood memories:

    **Sarge:** _\[pointing at the front of the Warthog\]_ Look, see these two hooks? They look like tusks, and what kind of animal has tusks?

        "Mermaids aren't real. Neither are dragons, golems, and ghosts, but the Fratellis apparently control all of those things anyway. They also recruit an Eskimo gang to throw axes at Mikey, because some poor developer got confused and thought Eskimos were mythical creatures."
        
    -   Another article written by a former Viet Cong fighter describes his group's shock at finding a squad of dead African-American soldiers.

-   There is a Darwin Awards Honorable Mention for a British soldier in Canada, who leapt over a fence clearly signposted with instructions to keep out because of the buffaloes, despite the begging from everyone else there not to do it, because he was convinced that American buffalo don't exist. He probably misinterpreted the common meme that American buffalo aren't buffalo (they are in the same genus as European bison), as meaning that the animals in question don't exist.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  It ended extremely badly for him, although non-fatally.
