_"Sophie! Your hair! It looks just like starlight. It's beautiful!"_

In fiction, white locks on a young character mark them as mystical and arcane, whether it means they are outright magical or not. In sci-fi and fantasy, it's often the only non-human hair color you will see on new species or race of people, especially in elves or Human Aliens. It is a common mark of a Mysterious Waif and a Mystical Waif.

The popularity of this trope probably stems from its status as a borderline-natural hair color: white hair on a young person strikes that delicate balance of being unusual but not blatantly unrealistic. The color also lends itself well to symbolism.

It bears repeating that these are young (or at least young\-looking) characters and their hair color is not indicative of age (or of premature aging).

May also come with an Ethereal White Dress.

See also White Hair, Black Heart, which is where having white hair is a sign of evil instead of magic, superpowers, or otherworldly origins; an albino power's white hair being seen as a sign of evil or the supernatural may be indicative of Albinos Are Freaks. If a character's hair turns white due to a disease or illness, it's Disease Bleach. If a character's hair turns white when they use their powers, it's Power Dyes Your Hair. Sometimes can be a result of Locked into Strangeness. See also Bald Mystic, another hairstyling choice that denotes the supernatural.

    Comic Books 

-   Siahm in _Arawn_ is a silver-haired Amazon, just like the rest of her tribe, who are made up of nothing but white-haired pretty girls. They have some limited magical powers that provide heightened vitality and slowed aging, all granted by drinking the blood of their enemies' hearts.
-   DC Comics:
    -   _Teen Titans_'s Rose "Ravager" Wilson, who's been called platinum blonde at least once. Oddly enough, this is supposedly because her father, Deathstroke, also has white hair due to the experiment that gave him his powers, which brings up another trope.
    -   Ice (Tora Olafsdotter). White hair, blue eyes, and she's the princess of a magical northern tribe. Sigrid Nansen (Icemaiden), who served as Tora's temporary replacement in the Justice League International, also had white hair but hers was the result of a science experiment to replicate the mystical ice powers of Tora's tribe.
    -   The first female Dove, Dawn Granger, in DC's _Hawk and Dove_. In her earlier appearances, only her Dove superhero form had white hair, while Dawn was a blonde. In more recent appearances pre-New 52, she was shown with white hair in both identities — most likely because it made it easier to differentiate her from the _other_ two major blonde female characters in _Birds of Prey_ when she joined that team. In her appearances in the New 52 reboot, colorists went back to only coloring her hair white as Dove.
    -   Dream Girl / Dreamer, Princess Projectra, and White Witch from the _Legion of Super-Heroes_.
    -   Hippolyta (Lyta) Hall, the second Fury, who featured prominently in _The Sandman (1989)_. It's not entirely clear whether this is actually blonde hair drawn as white (since a younger Lyta is shown as a blonde, and one character refers to her as a blonde as an adult), or if it really is white. Also, the Corinthian (a nightmare loose in the waking world) and Daniel Hall a.k.a. Morpheus II.
    -   The Phantom Stranger has white hair. His various origin stories, all of which may or may not be true, all show him having different natural hair colors before he became what he is now.
    -   Subverted with Abby Holland (née Abigail Arcane), Swamp Thing's wife. She has snow-white hair with two black streaks running through it, but she's not a spellcaster and the white hair comes from her mother's side of the family.
    -   _The Warlord (DC)_: Jennifer Morgan, Travis Morgan's daughter and the sorceress supreme of Skartaris. She was originally blonde, but her hair turns white as she gains sorcerous power.
    -   _Wonder Woman (2011)_: When Artemis (the goddess, not the hero) was redesigned, she was given glowing white hair, which matches her skin and eyes as she is entirely monochromatic.

-   Gaining this is part and parcel of recruitment into the _Death Vigil_. Sam calls it "the Dye After You Die Club."
-   _Femforce_: Stardust the Human Alien Science Hero.
-   CrossGen's _The First_ had both white-haired Ingra and Wyture, neither of them human. _Negation_ had Khlystek, the Lizard Lady, a reptilian alien with white hair.
-   Lady Death is a white-haired, white-skinned undead demigoddess.
-   Luther Arkwright: Luther Arkwright, Victoria, and Gabriel Shelley all have white hair, as well as a marked lack of body hair. It is implied that this is the case for most Homo Novus, the psychic descendants of humanity.
-   Marvel Comics:
    -   Doctor Strange's disciple/lover/wife Clea, half-Faltinian princess of the Dark Dimension. She has a touch of Anime Hair as well.
    -   _X-Men_'s Ororo "Storm" Munroe is a dark-skinned and white-haired with, yes, blue eyes. This was eventually explained as a property she got from her mother's inherent magic. Her mother came from a line of Kenyan witches, and during a New Mutants time-travel story, one of Storm's ancestresses in ancient Egypt also shared the physical characteristics.
    -   Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto a Person of Mass Destruction has white hair, the reasons for this are case of Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane. It's possible his white hair comes from his Magnetism Manipulation mutation which fully awakened when he was adult or just as likely Magneto gained his white hair due to the trauma he suffered in auschwitz.
    -   Nate Grey started out with a skunk stripe, like his counterpart, Cable, but at the end of _Age of X-Man_ it went completely white under the influence of the Life Seed. It is no accident that at this point, Nate was more than just a person, even a Reality Warper, having become a living pocket-reality — in many ways, he _was_ the Age of X-Man.
    -   The _X-Men_ villain Spiral, although she was originally a brunette before her genes were messed with.
    -   Alpha Flight's Walter Langkowski, aka Sasquatch, once became a woman after returning from the dead (long story). Going by the name Wanda, she was young and pretty, and had snow-white hair in both her human and Sasquatch forms.
    -   Balder Odinson, Thor's half-brother and long-time friend, returned to the living after making a deal with Hela to defeat 1000 of his previous foes in battle again to return to life. This took so long that his hair turned white while his Asgardian physiology meant he retained his youthful appearance.
    -   Subverted with Quicksilver. Although he was born on the extremely mystical Wundagore Mountain (haunt of the elder god Chthon), his white hair apparently is simply inherited from his father Magneto. Though that even gets subverted as well when his blood relation to Magneto gets retconned, meaningly Pietro's hair is tied to his mystical origins.
    -   Subverted with the Black Cat. She has natural white hair (officially platinum blonde) but was originally a Badass Normal. She acquired superpowers when she felt she was a liability on the battlefield. A straighter example would be The Ultimate Universe which reimagines her as a Mutant (though in that case, she wore a wig) and _Spider-Man: The Animated Series_ which grants her the power to change her hair from blonde to white when she powers up.
-   All of the Metabarons have long white hair, if they have any. For some reason, even the women they bring into the family from other clans have long white hair.

-   _Captain Marvel_'s Phyla-Vell a.k.a. Quasar, who is half Titanian (Titanese?) and half Kree.

-   _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_: Sabrina used to have platinum blonde hair but in the 1990s she was redesigned to be a brighter shade of blonde. She is half-witch. In _Chilling Adventures of Sabrina_ her original hair color was blonde but it had turned white by her teenage years, likely due to her witch heritage.
-   Gabrielle from _Spawn_ is an angel who has pure white hair.
-   Suprema has white hair as a side effect of exposure to Supremium, the source of her powers.
-   Phondari in _Warlord of Mars_ is a Grey Skinned Space Babe with platinum blonde hair.
-   There's Wolf Gal, a white-haired woman Raised by Wolves, from Lil Abner.

    Fan Works 

-   In _How I Became Yours_, an _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ fan comic, Princess Azula undergoes a mystic transformation similar to that of Princess Yue in the series' canon, and is endued with white hair as part of her supernatural connection to the powers of winter and the moon.
-   _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Tempest Rewrite_: Part of Mina's new look as Mysta of the Moon.
-   _The Night Unfurls_: The Plain Doll is the only character with silver hair. She is also a sentient porcelain doll with an ancient power stirring within.
-   Lord Alim Nox from _Song of a Northern Sorcerer_ can wield the Force to a frightening degree, and can be seen with silver hair when he's not wearing his hood. Said hair-colour leads more than a few people to assume he's a Valyrian, which furthers the association since Valyria used a lot of blood sorcery.
-   Shen Yuan from _The Untold Tale_ is a celestial being with fortune-telling powers, and also an albino with white hair.
-   Lunarstar from _Worlds Apart (MLP)_ is an all-white Winged Unicorn who is also the reincarnation of an all-white Feathered Dragon. She's the only magical pony in her world.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_: White hair is a universal racial trait of the Atlanteans, suggestive of their longevity (but not their age — the children have white hair, too).
-   _Frozen (2013)_:
    -   Queen Elsa has platinum blonde (or as Disney describes it, white-blonde) hair that's indicative of her powers. Word of God says that if she had no powers, she would be a brunette like her mother.
    -   Princess Anna has naturally strawberry-blonde hair with a platinum blonde streak as a result of being struck by Elsa's powers when she was five. When Anna's heart is frozen solid, her hair gradually begins to turn white. Sharp-eyed viewers will note that Anna's hair turns _literally_ white instead of platinum blonde.
-   _Heavy Metal_: Taarna. Also, the girl at the end develops white hair after she's revealed as Taarna's reincarnation.
-   In the anime adaptation of _Howl's Moving Castle_, Sophie's hair remains pale gray once her curse of old age is broken and she has come into her latent magical abilities.
-   _The Last Unicorn_: Lady Amalthea, the human form of the title unicorn, has long flowing white hair in the same shade as her true form's coat. "The young girl... she looks so strange! There's a newness about her," comments Prince Lir.
-   _Monsters vs. Aliens_: Susan/Ginormica's hair was originally brown, but after getting hit by a Magic Meteor full of quantonium, it turned white and she grew into a giant fifty-foot woman. Interestingly, her hair remains white even after the quantonium gets extracted from her body and she gets Brought Down to Normal.
-   _Rise of the Guardians_: Jack Frost, coupled with blue eyes. He originally had brown hair and eyes before he died.
-   _The Secret of Kells_: Aisling has white hair, since she's a fairy. A prequel comic shows that this is a racial trait of The Fair Folk.
-   _Thor: Tales of Asgard_: Brunhilde has white hair, which makes her stand out from the rest of the valkyries whom she leads, that have blonde hair.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Mirana, the White Queen from Tim Burton's _Alice in Wonderland (2010)_. She is one of the most powerful people in the country, matched only by her sister, the Red Queen.
-   Yun Fei-Yang, the kung fu disciple from _Bastard Swordsman_, after learning the forbidden martial arts technique of the Silkworm kung-fu, have his hair turning silver white.
-   Ni Chan, also known as the White-Haired Witch, from _The Forbidden Kingdom_.
-   The titular character from _The Bride With White Hair_, who started off with normal black hair until the day she was betrayed by her lover; learning to increase her inner _qi_ to a whole new level, her hair turns silver-white overnight and can lash out as whip-like appendages capable of shredding through flesh.
-   The titular heroine of _Wolf Devil Woman_, the Taiwanese movie which inspired _The Bride With White Hair_. Being raised by a white wolf somehow has her hair naturally growing silver-white.
-   Princess Nuala and her brother Nuada from _Hellboy II: The Golden Army_ both have long silvery hair, a common trait among elves.
-   In _Ginger Snaps_, Ginger as her werewolf transformation progresses, her hair becomes white.
-   In _Descendants_, Carlos has white hair inherited from his mother Cruella.
-   In _Underworld: Blood Wars_, the vampires from the Scandinavian Coven possessed silver-hair as a result of going through a cocooning process that granted some unusual abilities not seen in other members of their species (such as teleportation-like speed and soul reading), as well as increasing already existing abilities to higher levels. When Selene undergoes the same transformation, she gains streaks of white hair along with these powers.
-   _X-Men Film Series_
    -   Storm is a white-haired woman with weather manipulation/summoning powers.
    -   Quicksilver from _X-Men: Days of Future Past_, has silver hair. And while he is fond of breaking the law, he's not much of a White Hair, Black Heart like in the comics. As does his _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ counterpart.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Willow in the Season 7 finale of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ when she infuses every Potential Slayer in the world with the same powers Buffy and Faith have in order to defeat the First Evil. Even Kennedy calls her "a goddess" as a result.
-   Yuki from the live-action _Cutey Honey The Live_ had white hair when she "flashed" into her battle form.
-   Lexi Mason, the psychic starchild in _Falling Skies_, has long white hair (except in shared dreams, when it's black). All the Masons besides her have black hair.
-   Chiana in _Farscape_. A feature of her species, apparently — the women have white hair (with prominent dark roots) and the men have black hair.
-   Daenerys Targaryen (natural brunette Emilia Clarke in a white wig) in _Game of Thrones_, who has silver-blonde hair due to her Targaryen ancestry, since the blood of Valyria manifests in white/silver-blond hair. She's at least fire-absorbent.
    -   _House of the Dragon_ has a whole bunch of Targaryen family members (and ancestors of Daenerys) with such hair, and the series also establishes that even black-skinned Valyrians, such as the Velaryons, have the white-blond hair.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: The Dweller, a priestess of Sauron from Rhun, has silver-platinum Boyish Short Hair and is the only one from her trio capable of using magic. Her two partners are a brunette and a redhead.
-   _The Other Kingdom:_ Princess Astral and her mother Queen Titania both have white hair, and they happen to be the fairy princess and queen of their kingdom Athenia.

    Mythology & Religion 

-   In Classical Mythology, Epimeliads were nymphs associated with apple trees and protectors of sheep and goats. They usually had hair white like apple blossoms or undyed wool, showing their special bond with the flock and fruit trees.
-   The Book of Revelation depicts the divine form of Jesus as having hair as white as wool.
-   In the pre-Christian Hungarian religion, it was believed that children born with white hair had magic powers and thus were destined to become shamans.

    Pinball 

-   Both the protagonist of _Magic Girl_and the Big Bad wizard have stringy white hair.

    Tabletop Games 

-   One redesign of Princess Frostina from _Candy Land_ has her with white hair, though traditionally she has blue hair and newer incarnations give her blonde hair. She is an elegant princess with ice powers.
-   The Whites in _CthulhuTech_ are completely white (skin, eyes, and hair), on the average more attractive than either humans or Nazzadi, AND all natural para-psychics.
-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_ Dark elves, or drow, have dark skin and white hair (despite living underground for thousands of years, which you'd think would have the opposite effect; though, at least in one gameworld, they're described as being cursed into that form so no-one would mistake them). And since they're elves, they tend to be very good-looking (drow are even described as being more attractive on average than other elves, on top of looking exotic). They took this to massive race-wide Ms. Fanservice levels. The good ones took to dancing naked in the moonlight. The evil ones considered wearing armor admission of fear and weakness before rival houses. The females would often wander their cities nude or nearly so, flaying alive anyone who was Distracted by the Sexy with whips made of snakes unless they decided the male would make a worthy addition to their harem and let him audition for the role of pleasure slave. Pretty is not nice at all.
-   Arianna from _Exalted_ was the iconic Twilight Caste for the first couple of editions, sporting a long ponytail of stark white hair and regularly showing off her mastery of sorcery.
-   Avacyn from _Magic: The Gathering_'s _Innistrad_ pack is a white-haired angel. Helps with the Dark Is Not Evil motif since she wears all black.
-   _Nobilis_ has the Excrucian Iolithae Septimian, a Consummate Liar who is able to deceive reality itself.
-   _Pathfinder_: Feiya the witch, Balazar the summoner, Merisiel the knife-wielding rogue (who's an elf), and Seltyiel the magus (who's a half-elf). Seoni the sorcerer is platinum blonde, so it would appear that Paizo is fond of this trope.
-   In _Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution_ the esper representing the Stormbringer archetype has this. It is probably not a coincidence that magnekinesis (the ability to control the weather) is highly symbolically important to The Zodiac Order and that summoning weather is a common type of ritual magic worldwide.
-   Nightmist of _Sentinels of the Multiverse_ is a powerful mage with glowing white hair. The card "Regression Darts" reveals that the white hair actually stems directly from the magic; when her connection to magic is cut off by those darts, it turns brown.
-   Many Sisters of Battle from _Warhammer 40,000_ have white hair which reinforces their angelic/Joan Of Archetype appearance (though this is heavily implied to be the result of dyeing).

-   _Warhammer Fantasy_: Wizards often gain minor physical and mental changes from exposure to their preferred Wind of Magic. For Celestial Wizards and Light Wizards, this generally turns their hair pure white, alongside other effects.

    Toys 

-   In _My Little Pony_ most white-haired ponies subvert the trope and are perfectly normal but others fit the trope:
    -   Majesty from G1 is a unicorn pony introduced in Year 2 who has a white pelt and has a white stripe in her blue hair. She is not officially a "princess", but lives in a castle and has a dragon like the later introduced princesses. Majesty has extraordinary abilities when it comes to magic. In the British _My Little Pony_ comics she can use multiple types of magic, unlike the other ponies who specialize in only one type of magic. Majesty watches over the other ponies using a magic mirror and a crystal ball. She also has horseshoes that turn her invisible.
    -   Princess Silver Swirl from G2 is an all-white unicorn mare who is described as being a guardian angel to other ponies.
    -   Star Catcher was the first pegasus introduced in G3 and is the most unusual of the pegasi. She is white-furred with multi-colored hair. Star Catcher has a more refined voice than most other characters (who have more cartoony voices), she is very calm and understanding, and she can make wishes come true. She is also the unofficial leader of the pegasus, she is referred to as one of the most beautiful ponies out there, and her wings stand out amongst the other pegasus. It's stated in G3 that pegasus are rare and mystical, yet Star Catcher is the only one who actually displays these traits.

    Theater 

-   In some theatrical adaptations of _A Christmas Carol_, such as the one by Seattle's A Contemporary Theatre, the Ghost of Christmas Past is depicted with white or light blonde hair.

    Visual Novels 

-   The Nobles (including Aida) in _Ascension (2013)_ have this.
-   Mysterious Waif Chou from _Ballad of an Evening Butterfly_ has white hair. It probably has to do with her albinism, the fact she’s from an unusual species (that are very similar to vampires), and her mysterious powers.
-   The Nasuverse seems to love this trope, and it often indicates that the character in question isn't human:
    -   Ilyasviel von Einzbern and her maids Sella and Leysritt from _Fate/stay night_, as well as Ilya's mother Irisviel. In their case, it's genetic since Einzbern homunculi are descendants (or, more appropriately, clones) of Lizleihi Justica von Einzbern, who had the same white hair and red eyes. They also carry parts of her personality and even memories.
    -   Dark Sakura also has white hair and red eyes as part of her Evil Makeover.
    -   White Len from the _Melty Blood_ games has light grey hair.
    -   Merlin, who is definitively one of the greatest mages who ever lived as per backstory and background material, has white hair.
    -   There are several characters who have white hair when summoned as Servants but did not in their human lives. Archer in _Fate/stay night_ is a Future Badass version of Shirou Emiya who became a Counter-Guardian and thus eligible for summoning as a Servant, while in _Fate/Grand Order_, one of the Assassin-class Servants is an alternate version of Shirou's father, _Fate/Zero_ protagonist Kiritsugu Emiya, who also became a Counter-Guardian. _Grand Order_ also has King Solomon, who as a Servant has white hair but in his human form as Dr. Roman is a redhead.
-   Mysterious Waif Phi from _Virtue's Last Reward_ knows Sigma's name before he has a chance to mention it. She also demonstrates the ability to remember many things that only happened in other timelines.
    -   In the follow-up game _Zero Time Dilemma_, the trope is subverted: it turns out she dyes her hair white because she's ashamed of her natural hair color, red.

-   In _Seven Kingdoms: The Princess Problem_, all native inhabitants of Vail Isle have white hair, in a setting where everyone else is coloured normally. (Jasper has not only odd white hair but odd purple eyes.) It underlines their mystique and incredible competence, though the islanders are no more magical than anyone else...and even if they were, they wouldn't tell anyone.

-   Mystic Messenger mostly lacks supernatural elements, yet the team white-haired pretty boy Zen has inexplicable psychic dreams in a couple routes and a borderline Healing Factor.
-   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_, the Khura'inese prosecutor Nahyuta Sahdmadhi has white hair and is a respected monk who may have some mystic power. He got both from his mother, the former queen Amara, who is a spirit medium.
-   In _Spirit Hunter: NG_, the first thing that Akira notices about Kakuya is her long, snow-white hair, which combines with her traditional Japanese dress to give her a mysterious, otherworldly appearance.

    Web Animation 

-   Cielle, the clairvoyant magic shop owner from _Broken Saints_, has white hair, courtesy of albinism.
-   Bai Yuxiu of _Feng Ling Yu Xiu_ has it, and it is commented on with some frequency. Her strange abilities are a source of intrigue for the series's antagonists. It has been suggested that she did not always have this, as a similarly dressed girl with similar blue eyes and dark hair is shown in the show's opening.
-   Weiss Schnee of _RWBY_. In-universe, the Dust ammunition she uses is not magic, but it still allows her to act as the "Mage" of team RWBY.

    Webcomics 

-   Chloe from _Angel Down_ has extremely long white hair due to her being a Nephilim
-   Bailin from _Bailin and Li Yun_ has snow-white hair and scales, and is a creature that humanity has never seen before.
-   _The Beginning After the End_:
    -   Regardless of which form they are in, Dragons such as Kezess and Sylvia tend to have pale white hair. As such, whenever Arthur uses Realmheart (an ability he has access to due to him inheriting Sylvia's will as well as his ability to control the four elements), his hair ends up turning the same shade of white. His hair ends up becoming permanently white after he overclocks himself while using Realmheart during a climactic battle against the Alacryans and his bond Sylvie pulls off a Heroic Sacrifice to save him, reflecting how his biology has been altered to become more draconic.
    -   Tessia Eralith and the Royal Family of the Elven Kingdom of Elenoir all have silver hair. Naturally, they are all highly adept at magic, and not only does Arthur hone his magical skills under their tutelage, but Tessia becomes the Student Council President at Xyrus Academy, the Wizarding School Arthur ends up attending when they grow up.
-   Kili Stormcrow, a shaman of _The Dragon Doctors_, has bleach-white hair due to an incident as a child—Kili developed spiritual vision so strong that Kili's perception was trapped in the spirit world. Kili's hair has become permanently white.
-   Played with in _Dreaming Freedom_. While Siyun’s white hair is dyed, he does have some supernatural abilities, namely the ability to astral project.
-   _Drowtales_: Using the models of drow as depicted in Dungeons & Dragons, depicts every drow born underground as having white hair and the latent ability to use magic.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, both Hanma and Voltaire seem to have this. The former has dark skin and the latter seems to have pure white skin. Both combinations are not seen even in other Immortals which mark them as unusual.
-   _Evelyne and the Occult_: Leo has stark white hair and can see the supernatural, in contrast to most of the other characters in this setting, who have normal hair colours.
-   Zenobia in _Hazard's Wake_ has white hair, possibly related to her (most likely) being a demon.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   Rose and Roxy both have white hair like Dave and Dirk, and have shown an interest in magic, with Roxy being a big fan of wizards and Rose dual-wielding magic wands as her weapon of choice. However, while depending on your headcanon this trope could apply, technically this white hair is just a result of the (intentionally ambiguous) art style. In all likelihood, Rose and Roxy have light blonde or orange hair.
    -   Calliope is a better example, except that it's a white wig, and she's actually bald. She wears it to cosplay as her Trollsona who bears a striking resemblance to Calmasis, a character in Post-Scratch Rose's books.
-   Lei'ella from _Inverloch_, which marks her as one of the Severed, mortal, magicless elves with silver hair and not-so Supernatural Gold Eyes. "Healthy" elves have brown/blond/black hair. The one exception is Kayn'dar, who had magic _despite_ this coloration, hence is considered The Messiah of some sort.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: Allison receives white hair from a Superpowered Evil Side granted by a Deal with the Devil. Even after the evil side is dealt with, the white hair colour remains even after a later Time Skip.
-   Robot Girl Ping from _Megatokyo_ had white hair early on, before her body started changing in response to her character development.
-   Roy's girlfriend Celia in _The Order of the Stick_. As a sylph, she's innately magical and an inversion of Closer to Earth, being from the Elemental Plane of Air.
-   Corrick of _Plume_, an immortal Guardian Entity gifted with absurdly overpowered magic, has gotten white hair upon his ascension to a magical being.
-   _Sleepless Domain_: Early concept art of the series depicts Tessa with white hair instead of pink, hinting early on at her exceptional magical potential even among other magical girls. She also had four colored streaks in her hair, one for each of her teammates — red for Sally, blue for Undine, yellow for Sylvia, and green for Gwen.
-   Angels in Slightly Damned have naturally snow-white hair (but it is difficult to see because their culture demands they dye their hair the same color as their element) and are the most magically powerful of all races.
-   _TwoKinds_: Raine Silverlock, a young woman on the comic's "team B", certainly qualifies this trope, having knee-length silver hair, and an incredible raw magical potential (Although she has no control over it, no thanks to her mother...).
-   _Unsounded_: The Platinum caste of Alderode have pure white hair and an unusually strong connection to the Background Magic Field of the Khert. One of the major religions teaches that they're beloved by the Gods and are at the end of their cycle of Reincarnation, which takes some of the sting off their 30-year lifespan.

    Web Original 

-   The anomalings from Almost Nowhere are actually EldritchAbominations but frequently talk to the protagonists via 'humanoid shades' the most prominent of which, Micheal, is described as having flowing white hair despite otherwise looking, "not a day over thirty". Notably this is an intentional cosmetic choice and Micheal has been demonstrated to have almost unlimited control over his appearance.
-   On the _Dream SMP_, Boomer has white hair, and from what his content creator counterpart has revealed, it's indicated that his hair was sapped of its original blond colour in exchange for mystical powers that can be harnessed through his hat.

-   Nasha of _SPAZ_ has long white hair, and while she's not magical, she's definitely a little strange.

    Web Videos 

-   Lys, the Source of life in the _Noob_ franchise, who is a Physical Goddess who looks like a teenager according to the novels and is played by a fairly young woman in the web-movies.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: Princess Yue's hair color was a plot point. She was actually born (or rather still-born) with dark hair like everyone else in the water tribe (and pretty much everyone in the four nations). When the moon-spirit saved her infant life, her hair turned pure white and remained that way all her life.
-   Charmcaster from _Ben 10_ is a silver-haired sorceress.
-   _Dad'X_: Foudror is a white-haired villain in a wizard-like cloak. He has many magical abilities, such as shooting lightning out of his fingers.
-   _Danny Phantom_: Danny and Dani's half-ghost forms.
-   In _Disenchantment,_ protagonist Bean has white hair, as did her mother, Dagmar. Dagmar is a Wicked Witch, and Bean has clearly inherited some sort of magic from her.
-   Rayla from _The Dragon Prince_ is a moonshadow elf, and as such has white hair. These elves magically draw their powers from the moon. As it turns out, all of the Moonshadow elves have white hair.
    -   In a darker shade on this, Claudia's hair starts going white when she overtaxes himself on dark magic. She gets a skunk stripe to fix Soren's paralysis, then about half of it white when she resurrects Viren.

-   Queen La from _The Legend of Tarzan_ has white hair. Serves as a Mythology Gag to the original Edgar Rice Burroughs stories describing the city of Opar as an Atlantean colony city, hence the design reference to _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_.
-   Nefertina from _Mummies Alive!_ had white hair and pale gray skin in her undead mummy form. There was some inconsistency in her coloring throughout the series. In some of the flashback scenes where she was still alive, sometimes, she was shown with black hair, and sometimes, she was shown with white hair. And yes, she, too, was voiced by Cree Summer (guess which other character Cree voiced that Nefertina resembled!).
-   "The Great and Powerful" Trixie from _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ has this sort of hair, though with shades of light blue. She's a stage magician in addition to being a unicorn, hence it reinforces her supernatural allure. Played straight with her human counterpart in _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_, whose hair is completely white with the same blue streaks.
-   The Collector from _The Owl House_ is a Reality Warper so powerful he becomes an Outside-Context Problem just by virtue of his existence, and within minutes of being freed, accidentally causes the apocalypse while trying to play with King. While his hair is mostly hidden under a nightcap, the hair that pokes out is bright white.

-   Like her parents, Allura from _Voltron: Legendary Defender_ has dark skin and white hair, as was common on her home planet, Altea. Later on, this happens to Shiro as his soul is revived into a clone body with Allura's magic, gaining a full head of silver hair.
