_"I just had a wet dream, I'm covered in nut cream. It's all icky, really sticky."_

— _Koit_, "Wet Dream"

Men are such perverts that they even ejaculate in their sleep. There is a perfectly normal (i.e. non-perverted) biological explanation for this, but Fiction Land likes to pretend that it's always a result of an Erotic Dream and/or masturbation. Also, in Fiction Land, women never do this. (In Real Life, they do, but barring female ejaculation it's a lot harder for women to tell in the morning.) Truth in Television for both sexes, though this phenomenon is more the exception than the rule. A teenage boy's first nocturnal emission is often given the same treatment in The Talk as a teenage girl's first period.

If a man is discovered to have such an emission by someone else (_especially_ his Love Interest), he will never hear the end of it.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan_ mixes this with _The Metamorphosis_, of all things.
-   In _A Certain Scientific Railgun_, Kuroko Shirai is shown (judging by the noises she made and her ... embracing of her pillow) to have a very explicit dream about her Onee-sama, Mikoto Misaka .
-   _DomesticNaKanojo_: In Chapter 79, there's an unusual case with Natsuo - instead of an actual ejaculation (which he dreamt he was having), he wakes up with a nosebleed so severe he has to wash his shirt and pillowcase in secret. Rui notices him sneaking into the bathroom and follows, first making a quip about him having a period, then wondering just what he was dreaming about to get a nosebleed that huge. It was her.
-   Female example in _High School D×D_, where Akeno is stated to often dream of having sex with Issei. Since it's Akeno, it's safe to assume the dreams are not subtle.
-   _Kemono Jihen_ features an unusually serious version of this trope: in Yui's backstory, one day his twin brother Akira sheepishly admits that he wet the bed the previous night despite being a teenager. Yui, who started going through puberty a bit earlier than his twin, realizes that Akira most likely didn't wet the bed but instead actually experienced his first nocturnal emission— meaning that the women of their village will now consider him mature enough to subject to the same horrific treatment as Yui.
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: Implied for Gojo at the beginning of Chapter 5/Episode 3. He wakes up from having an Erotic Dream about Marin, and then he looks below his covers. He's later shown having to grab a box of tissues.
-   _The Tyrant Falls in Love_: Tearfully related by Morinaga, as the first page of Volume 3.
-   _Umi no Misaki_: Rinne had an Erotic Dream that may have caused a feminine Nocturnal Emission.
-   Non-sexual versions frequently happen in _Wandering Son_. The protagonist often has these, even when his dreams are not sexual. Yuki's first flashback notes her having one of these, going to the bathroom, and her crush (now boyfriend) walks in at a school field trip when they were children.
-   _The World's Finest Assassin_: Lugh finds himself in this uncomfortable situation due to both Tarte and Maha spending the night with him in his bed. They wake up to a funny smell to which Lugh tries to explain away by exclaiming that there’s a perfectly biological explanation for this. This prompts the girls to eagerly insist that he should just “ask them for help” to prevent this from happening again.

    Comedy 

-   Serves as the basis for one of Bill Cosby's stand-up routines, speaking about "the Fairy of Good Dream" that visits boys when they come of age, when they start doing their own laundry.

-   In _Brokeback Mountain_'s original short story, Ennis sometimes have Jack in his dream after Jack's death, either leaving him with grief or an "old sense of joy and release." It's implied that the trope is in effect when he feels the latter because sometimes he finds his sheets to be wet.
-   In _The Ghost Writer_, sometime after he started the pen-friendship romance with Alice, Gerard has Erotic Dream where he had sex with her. When he woke up, he found his blankets and pajamas wet. He then told Alice about this in his letter. Alice's reply letter has her claimed that she had similar dream roughly at the same time.
-   In _Lamb: The Gospel According To Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal_, Jesus heads to the East accompanied by his friend Biff to find the 3 wise men who came to witness his birth so he can learn _how_ to be the messiah. The second of the wise men turns out to be a Buddhist monk who is the head of a Shaolin-esque monastery. While staying at the monastery, the two are naturally forbidden from being involved with women, or masturbating, and the only emission of semen can be involuntary, nocturnal ones. Biff, being a natural born lecher, promptly learns how to force himself to have dreams that will result in nocturnal emissions. Since they stay at the monastery for several years, he notes that he got pretty good at it.
-   _The Road to Mars_: Carlton (an android built to look like David Bowie) is marketed as such. His advertising copy describes him as "a cross between a wet dream and a wank."

He knows what's happening to him, being slightly older and very knowledgeable, but she dismisses his explanation as nonsense and continues belittling him.

-   In an oft-bowdlerised or omitted section of "Satire 1.5", Horace recalls staying at a farm not too far from Trivicum for the night while on a trip to Brundisium. A girl stood him up, resulting in this.
    
    "There, like a fool, I stayed up a good half of the night for a wench that  
    Promised and lied when she promised, till sleep took away the erection  
    Venus delights in; and then to my dreams came an off-color wraith of  
    Fancy, who left me with stains on my nightshirt and down-pressing belly.

-   In _The Sarah Silverman Program_, Jay was in bed with Laura when she discovered he'd had a nocturnal emission.

His girlfriend sees this and gets mad and he tries to get the news people to let him apologize. On Live TV. Then his girlfriend forgives him and when the news people actually let him apologize, she burst in, onto live TV, and delivers (in a manner not unlike a PSA) a small speech about how nocturnal emissions are involuntary and they and the dreams are not under the control of the person who has them and shouldn't be held against them.
-   On _The Daily Show_, Jon Stewart, in response to a Rush Limbaugh sound bite of accusing Barack Obama's immigration policy to be "a dictator's wet dream", had this to say:

    Music 

-   Suggested in Alice Cooper's "Nurse Rozetta".
-   "Wet Dream" by Max Romeo was deemed so suggestive that the song was effectively banned in some countries. Its title couldn't even be mentioned.
-   Also suggested in Bruce Springsteen's "I'm On Fire" when he sings "Last night I woke up with the sheets soaking wet" while thinking about his teenage subject.
-   Koit has a song "Wet Dream" which is all about this.
-   "Rocks Off" by The Rolling Stones alludes to this, since the narrator "Only gets \[his\] rocks off while \[he's\] dreaming."
-   "Undercover Angel" by Alan O'Day is a more subtle example: "I never had a dream that made sweet love to me." Of course, it loses that subtlety near the end when a voice constantly pants "undercover".
-   O-Town's song "Liquid Dreams" is about this, specifically dreaming about various female celebrities.
-   "Basketball Shoes" by Black Country, New Road mentions this during the final part of the song: "In my bedsheets, now wet Of Charli, I pray to forget"

    Mythology 

-   European folklore blamed these, along with sleep paralysis and night terrors, on Succubi having their way with sleeping men.

    Religion 

-   From _The Bible_: Leviticus chapter 15 covers the issue of how the people of Israel were to deal with various bodily discharges, including that of the "seed of copulation". Deuteronomy 23:9-11 specifically deals with this issue when an army goes out against their enemies.
-   In Jewish tradition Lilith, first wife of Adam, is the responsible. In the later medieval tradition there were incubi and succubi (with some justification that this is the only method demons can procreate).

    Video Games 

-   In _I Was a Teenage Exocolonist_, the protagonist gets this when they're 13 if the player selects the corresponding puberty option for them. They vaguely recall having an "exciting" dream the other night when they stained the bed, and if they do their laundry, their dad comes in to tell them that it's okay to "feel a little _wet_ behind the ears".

    Western Animation 

-   Butters had some in the _South Park_ episode "Sarcastaball". Note that Butters is only ten years old.
-   Happens to Orel Puppington on _Moral Orel_ after having dreams where God praises him. Because he loves Christianity, he starts to physically harm himself whenever he feels "blessed" to counter this. Unfortunately, then he starts adapting to _liking_ the pain, culminating in him having _another_ wet dream where God spanks him for being naughty.
    
    **Clay:** You've been having _what_ about _who_ doing _WHAT_?!
    
-   Happens to Jack in the "Jack and the Beanstalk" segment of _Once Upon a Girl_.
-   On _Daria_'s first episode, the title character meets her best friend, Jane, in Self-Esteem Class. Jane's had it six times<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , so she gives Daria the rundown.
    
    **Jane:** So, then, after the role-playing, next class they put the girls and the guys in separate rooms and a female counselor talks to us about body image.  
    **Daria:** What do they talk to the boys about?  
    **Jane:** A classroom full of guys and a male teacher?  
    **Both:** Nocturnal emissions.
