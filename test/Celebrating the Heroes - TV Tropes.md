Gotta have those shinies!

_For over a thousand years, Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of a triumph, a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeters and musicians and strange animals from the conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children, robed in white, stood with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror holding a golden crown and whispering in his ear a warning...that all glory is fleeting._

This trope is about an event where a local populace holds a celebration to honor a hero (and his/her team if he/she has any) for his good deeds and triumphs. Frequently involves Fireworks of Victory.

Compare Awesome Moment of Crowning, And Mission Control Rejoiced, Tickertape Parade. Also compare Kneel Before Frodo, Standard Hero Reward and Think Nothing of It.

There would be too many examples from Real Life to list, so No Real Life Examples, Please!

**Note: This is only for when the major heroic characters have a celebration held in their honor.**
