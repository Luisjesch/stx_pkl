**Drakken:** But, Shego, we escaped with the E.M.A. unscathed.  
**Shego:** _\[crying\]_ Yeah, but I broke a nail!  
**Drakken:** I break mine all the time; you don't see me crying. Not on the outside.

Stock phrase of the City Mouse, Fallen Princess, Rich Bitch, Alpha Bitch or, more stereotypically, the token woman. Sometimes used by the Action Girl after a particularly grueling fight in which this is the only injury she is concerned about. In any case, the character is Always Female unless it's a deliberate play on the trope. The phrase is, of course, used to show off how petty or vain she is, especially if it's used in the face of more pressing concerns. It may also be a Berserk Button for her.

Most Writers Are Male, with short-clipped nails that rarely if ever get broken in contrast to the longer and more vulnerable nails women are likely to have. As a result, it took a long time for women to get across that a nail can be broken more badly than just spoiling her manicure. They can be ripped right back to the finger, damaging the cluster of nerves at the tip and causing bleeding. Simply put, broken nails **hurt**, and _that's_ why she's crying. It can also lead to a hangnail, which can easily get infected. Nowadays, it's used more as a joke than anything, often by an Action Girl who's just been in a fight to show how tough she is that this is all the damage the guys could do to her. Because of this, it's become a Discredited Trope.

Sometimes guys use it to show that they're very vain. Occasionally, this is used as an insult toward the rich, that they would fret about breaking a nail if they were outdoors, or otherwise tasked with work.

Compare Minor Injury Overreaction, which this is a subtrope of. For serious injury to the nail, look under Fingore. When this happens to toenails, look up Agony of the Feet.

    Comic Books 

-   _Archie Comics_ sometimes uses this trope with Veronica. In one comic, she screeches hysterically, causing a crowd to gather who think she must be gravely injured, only to reveal that a broken nail was the cause; when Archie gives her No Sympathy, she's outraged and declares that only women have compassion, all the while ignoring a skateboard accident that leaves Archie bruised all over.
-   In the course of _Secret Wars (1984)_, when all of Marvel's greatest heroes were transported out of the galaxy for an apocalyptic war of good and evil when the winsome Wasp discovered a broken nail after a space-ship dogfight. "... and there isn't an Emory board for a million light years!"

    Comic Strips 

-   _Beetle Bailey_: This turns out to be the reason Sgt. Louise Lugg mauled a guy so badly while playing American football.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Kingdom Hearts_ fanfic _Those Lacking Spines_, Marly-dono says this phrase word-for-word after slamming a fist onto his computer. Yes, he's a guy.

    **Krillin:** You can have two!
    
-   In _You Call That a Costume?_, a debutante transformed Applejack screams over doing this. Unfortunately, it happens when the Rainbooms were sneaking up on a sleeping Fluttershy turned into a giant bat.

    Films — Animation 

-   Used by Georgette in Disney's _Oliver & Company_. Which is slightly weird, considering that she's a _dog_. With dogs though, she would actually be _under_reacting - it's _far_ worse for dogs than it is for a human.
-   _Cinderella_: Drizella sings a line about this when cleaning dishes during the third film.
-   In _Superman/Batman: Apocalypse_:
    
    **Kara:** I've been chased, shot at, kidnapped, beaten up, had my mind controlled **and** I broke a nail.
    
    -   She's a Kryptonian under a yellow sun. Her fingernails should be practically indestructible, so some impressive forces were at work there, and that's very possibly the only actual injury she took in that whole ordeal.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Early in the 1940 film _My Little Chickadee_, Mae West's character, Flower Belle, calmly and cooly forces a tribe of Indians who are attacking her train to retreat with a few sharp shots from revolvers akimbo and a shotgun. Her response to a well-deserved congratulations?
-   Angel from _The Fifth Commandment_ lets out a variant after barely surviving a shootout. "I need a manicure and a pedicure as soon as I get back."
-   Willie Scott uses this line _twice_ in _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom_. The first time she only "cracked" a nail, rather than actually breaking it, but that was still apparently a good enough excuse for her to practically throw Indy's gun out the side of the car.
-   Inverted in the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ movie. ("I didn't even break a nail.")

-   This is done to a lesser extent in the movie _Lost in Space_ where Dr. Smith attempts to smuggle himself on board the _Jupiter Two_ in a crate. The crane abruptly stops, causing him to fall over and immediately afterwards he glances at his nails and makes an annoyed little sound.
-   In the action movie/porn film _Barb Wire_, after having a hand to hand to guns to stiletto heels to groin fight and killing a whole crapload of men, Barb Wire (played by Pamela Anderson) looks at her hand, on which is a broken nail:
    
    **Barb:** Goddammit...
    
-   _Erin Brockovich_: "Goddamnit!" — Erin shortly after breaking her nail getting into the car, and shortly before getting T-boned.

Barf says "Not bad... for a girl"; Vespa's Robot Maid counters with "That was pretty good for _Rambo_!"
-   _Batman Returns_: Batman vs. Catwoman. When Batman pushes Catwoman off him, she ends up in a pile of broken plant pots. Batman removes the sharp metal nail from his suit and tosses it at her. Catwoman picks it up and examines her hand back to front and lets out an irritated "Damn..."
-   _The Butchers_: When the resurrection spell is cast, there is an earthquake that shakes the entire Ghost Town.

Only her friend Candi gives her any sympathy.
-   Invoked in _Ladybugs_, a Rodney Dangerfield movie where he becomes the coach of a girls' soccer team sponsored by his company. In the climactic championship match, one of the no-nonsense rival players knocks over one of the girls from the titular Ladybugs, who shouts "Mom! Those **bitches** broke my nail!" The player's mother and everyone in the stands chants "Get those nail-breakers!", which rouses the Ladybugs to victory.

Zakath asks C'nedra what he should do (the Alorns have been giving him lessons in how to not be a tyrant), and her reply is "Hang him. Drat, I broke a nail." Her apparent cold-bloodedness shocks Zakath, and then she explains that condemning the man then pardoning him will do more to convince him not to drink anymore than any amount of punishment. She also suggests building a gallows just outside his window, at which point Zakath turns to Garion and asks why they ever got married. (Garion's response is that they didn't have a say in the matter.)
-   In the fourth _Artemis Fowl_ book, there is a gnome who is so out of shape, he has to lie down if he gets a hangnail. And LEP orders him to try to stop Holly Short. Who is pissed off and just lost her father/mentor/commander and is getting framed for his murder. Safe bet's the gnome winning.

    Live-Action TV

The second time it happens during her Training from Hell with Villamax, who simply responds to her angry reaction that he only has 9 to go then.
    -   Also happens to Nadira in _Power Rangers Time Force_ during a battle with the Rangers. Naturally she goes whining to Ransik about it and rather than explain the absurdity of using your fingernails as weapons against sword-wielding superheroes, he promises to make them pay...and we're not talking about for a new manicure, either.
-   Parodied in _True Jackson, VP_, while True was searching for a horse that was visiting her boss, and she lost in the office, she heard Amanda screaming, but when she arrived she said she broke a Nail.

    **Batman:** _(completely deadpan)_ You're right. I think I chipped a nail back there.  
    **Catwoman:** You stick to the brooding, I'll handle the wisecracks.

    -   Sonya somehow gets the trope again, and possibly even worse: she did learn the bass, and was in fact very good with it.

-   Stacey from _American Dragon: Jake Long_ was once seen running scared by Jake and Trixie. Trixie said she'd probably complain about a broken nail. At first, it seemed the trope would be subverted as Stacey mentioned Huntsboys 88 and 89 capturing Spud but then she _did_ complain about her broken nail. When Jake and Trixie went running to help Spud, Stacey thought they would call for someone to repair the broken nail.

    Real Life 

-   A woman named Lee Redmond grew her fingernails out for thirty years to a length of two-and-a-half feet each, breaking the record for longest fingernails. In 2009, she was in a terrible car crash. She sustained severe injuries and broke off all of her nails. Upon finding out, she was devastated. She later discovered it was easier to manipulate objects without her giant talons.
-   Fear of committing this trope played straight and just one of this girl's issues with her new job. Averted by the girl who's been there a while.
-   Mocked in this iFunny page.
-   Losing a nail is actually a painful experience, particularly if it's only partly come off and a new one is growing trying to push the remains of the old one out. It's even worse if you're doing something that primarily involves your fingers, like playing video games (as happened to ProtonJon during his livestream of _Pepsiman_).
-   Even if you merely snap a long nail low enough that it does no damage to the nail bed, the torque required to do it is usually painful (equivalent to an extremely bad toe stubbing.) More than the pain, the inconvenience is annoying. If you're going to repair the nail so it's restored to the length of the others you're talking about possibly several hours of work that you didn't schedule into your life. If you're not going to restore it to match the others then you either have to trim the rest and lose several months of growth or put up with mismatched lengths. People with long nails usually adapt to using them as extended fingertips, especially for things like typing. Imagine your middle finger was suddenly half a fingertip shorter and consider what that might do to your typing. It's not the end of the world, but it genuinely is irritating.
    -   If you have a vitamin D deficiency (while rare), this can actually happen a lot more easily as your nails become brittle.
-   The nails of animals can be much worse than those of humans when this trope occurs. Since many animal claws contain flesh and blood vessels within, and are anchored to the skeleton rather than the skin, a broken nail can be an extremely painful (not to mention _bloody_; seasoned professionals have described the floors around a pet with a "simple" torn claw as looking like a murder scene) affair. This is one reason many pets are _terrified_ of having their nails clipped.
