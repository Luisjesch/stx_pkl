A standard mystery plot: someone is murdered on a passenger flight while it is in the air. From a writer's perspective, this has the advantage of providing both a closed setting and a limited suspect pool without either feeling overly contrived. These days it also provides the additional puzzle of how the killer smuggled a weapon on board.

The detective can either be on the flight or brought in once the plane has landed.

The successor to Thriller on the Express (though it still gets used in non-modern settings).

Compare Death Flight.

-   The disappearance (and apparent murder) of his wife and daughter from a plane in flight over Lake Ontario in _Justice, Inc._ delivers the shock that transforms Richard Benson into _The Avenger_.
-   A Biggles short story featured a variation on the theme. A light aircraft whose owner was supposedly trying to beat the speed record for a trans-African air route is found crashed and burned out, with a body in the cockpit. Biggles happened to know the pilot personally, and insists on Identification by Dental Records because something seems off about the whole thing for reasons he can't fully explain even to himself. He's right: Not only is the body not the plane's registered owner and pilot, but the cause of death was a bullet to the back of the head. Turns out the guy was Faking the Dead so he'd have the ultimate alibi for a robbery, and the dead body belonged to some young aviation fanboy he'd met in an airport bar and lured aboard with the promise of a joyride.
-   The Trope Namer is the Agatha Christie novel _Death in the Clouds_, first published in 1935. This might also be the Trope Maker. Memorably features _Hercule Poirot_ as a possible suspect (according to the jury).
    -   One of the suspects (a detective writer) intends to make it the plot of his next book, and avoid libel by making the murderer a complete unknown who hides in an airplane seat, releases knockout gas while wearing a gasmask, and once the deed is done, parachutes to safety.
    -   An early plot point is the idea that the murderer used a blowpipe to propel the murder weapon (a poisoned dart) at the victim unnoticed. To test this theory, an inspector walks down the aisle raising a six-inch pipe to his mouth every few steps, by the end of which test just about every passenger is staring at him (and adding insult to injury, an actual blowpipe is _6 feet long_). The murderer actually dressed in his dentist's clothes, which looked like an airline steward's uniform, and jabbed the dart into the sleeping victim's neck.

-   _CSI_:
    -   In "Unfriendly Skies," Grissom and his team investigate the death of a first class passenger on a flight to Las Vegas. Their investigation is a race against time, because after 12 hours the F.B.I. will take over. To make matters worse, the other first class passengers are very reluctant to co-operate, leading the team to consider that they had some involvement in their fellow passenger's death. Turns out Everybody Did It — the passenger was undergoing some kind of neurological disorder making him act like a jerk and eventually making him freak out and try to open the cabin mid-flight, and the whole lot of them ganged up and (accidentally) pummeled him to death to prevent it.
    -   In "Forever," the team investigates the death of a horse trainer who was stomped to death by her horse, as they were flying inside of a special private jet that is a flying stable.
