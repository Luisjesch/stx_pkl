We expected better **quick**\-thinking from you, Blue Blur!

**Batgirl:** Let the kid go, Joker!  
**Joker:** _(exasperated)_ I'm _trying_ to!

So, the villain has taken a hostage, and to make sure the hero understands that this is serious, the villain is holding the hostage off a roof or over some other height. Usually, in this case, the villain just has one simple, quick request: they want the code, or the MacGuffin, or the hero's surrender. The hero gives in to the demand, and then says something along the lines of "Now let him/her go!"

Poor choice of words, it turns out, because just this once, the villain is going to comply. Immediately and literally. They let go, and the hostage goes plummeting towards whatever they were being held over.

This happens so reliably that asking a villain to let a dangling hostage go, without being very specific, probably qualifies you as Genre Blind. Even so, this trope is almost always played completely straight. We can only conclude that the sight of a hostage held in the air is the hero's cue to grab the Idiot Ball. Typically, the hostage will survive, but it may require a very well timed Big Damn Heroes moment or just plain luck.

Variations can occur, as particularly cunning villains may find other, less obvious ways to turn a demand that a hostage is released into a request to kill them. Antiheroes have their own special variation, where they hold a bad guy over a ledge to get information, and then when the bad guy demands he be let go... well, you know the rest. Sometimes, someone's plea to let them go starts at a survivable drop and quickly turns negative once they get higher up.

This can be a type of Literal Cliffhanger. For pretty much the exact opposite trope, see Take My Hand!. The extremely literal version of a villain complying with You Said You Would Let Them Go. And the extremely literal version of _this_ would be An Arm and a Leg. When the villain has no real reason to kill their hostage and seems to do it just for the sake of the gag, this is a case of a Villain Ball.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Done by Creed in the _Black Cat_ manga. When Chronos came to destroy the Apostles of the Stars and rescue Rinslet, Creed took her hostage and told Naizer to face the Werewolf alone. Naizer requested that Creed let her go if he wins, to which Creed agrees. After Naizer defeats the Werewolf, he tells Creed to keep his promise. Creed keeps his promise, literally, and drops Rinslet off of the tower.
-   On The Ocean Group's dub of _Dragon Ball Z_, after Dodoria pleads with Vegeta to let him go, he agrees to let him go... _to another dimension!_ Basically Saiyan slang for killing him.
    -   Also done in the original series, in a much more straightforward way. When King Piccolo is confronting the king of Earth on his airplane, he grabs the king's first mate and holds him over the edge. The king demands that Piccolo let him go, and Piccolo does just that, letting the man fall to his death.
-   In _Attack on Titan_, Hange performs a High-Altitude Interrogation on Pastor Nick while utilizing this trope.
    
    **Nick:** "Now let me off this wall."
    
    **Hange:** "Alright." \*dangles off ledge\* "Would you like to be left off from right here?"
    

    Comic Books 

-   Near the end of _Batman: No Man's Land_, The Commissioner Gordon's wife orders The Joker to drop the baby he's holding, with him at gunpoint. He does, so she has to drop her gun to catch the baby, giving him an opportunity to kill her with a Boom, Headshot!.
-   _Black Dynamite_: Two Swole picks up grandma Graham and her little grandson Keith. When Black Dynamite tells him to let them go, Two Swole responds by tossing them in the air.
-   Played with by Doctor Doom in the "Unthinkable" arc of _Fantastic Four_. Doom is holding Franklin hostage _in hell_, and holding the arm of Valeria. He promises to let Sue's child go if she'll do what he wants, and when she acquiesces, he releases Valeria's arm. She's in no immediate danger, though. The current author was deconstructing Doom's Noble Demon habits.
-   Molly from _Runaways_ shows an awareness of this trope. When a giant is holding one of her friends she follows the demand that the giant put the friend down with "And not, like, down your throat."
-   In one issue of _Suicide Squad_, Amanda Waller sent Deadshot to stop the other villain Rick Flag from killing a Senator, with the orders that "Rick Flagg must never be allowed to kill the Senator, by any means". Deadshot made sure he'd never be able to kill the Senator - he killed him himself. I guess that teaches you not to give vital jobs to the Axe-Crazy Psycho for Hire...
-   In _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW)_, Raphael makes the mistake of saying this to the Rat King (in this incarnation a god of chaos) as he's holding a child by the leg over a drop into the east river. Michelangelo, after rescuing the child, lampshades the stupidity of saying that, bringing up _The Dark Knight_ as a reference.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: When Eros has gone a bit mad and is standing as a giant holding Steve Trevor Diana makes the mistake of thinking Eros won't kill him due to his portfolio as a love god who is supposed to be allied with the Amazons and tells him to let Steve go. Unfortunately the reason Eros has gone unhinged is that Steve has died twice but is still running around and Eros considers him an imposter trying to steal Diana's love so Eros drops him to his third death.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: Provides an example of the hero getting yelled at to let someone go, while she's grappling with Poison Ivy after tackling her out of a fourth story window. Ivy freezes up momentarily when she realizes she's just asked Diana to drop her from such a height, and Diana _does_ as Ivy's meta-human abilities mean that Di doesn't have to worry about the fall killing her.

    Fan Works 

-   In _A Family of My Own_ Ron grabs Harry's kitten familiar (which happens to be his adopted sister's Animagus form) during first year flying lessons and takes off on his broom. When Harry follows and says to let go of her, Ron throws her toward the Forbidden Forest.
-   _The Bridge_: When Destroyah grabs Mothra, Rodan says, "Hands off the bug!" She says, "Okay" and throws her into him.
-   _Fate/Long Night_: When the Mother's Champion beats up Shinji and then starts strangling him, Sakura asks him to let him go, but it doesn't work until she uses a Command Spell, at which point he complies by hurling Shinji into a wall hard enough to crack it. Sakura notes she should have worded that more specifically.
-   Heroic example in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_: During the Big P Pokémon Race, Iris is riding on Ash's Charizard, and after spotting two snipers in wait at the entrance of the canyon as the competitors approach, they dive in to attack them, with Charizard grabbing one of them and flying away. When the thug begins to yell to be let go, Iris looks down below and seeing a river, quickly says: "You heard him, let him go!", and Charizard nonchalantly drops him.
-   Referenced and defied in the _Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic_ fic _Where I Reign_. Hakuei, who is currently possessed by Arba, is able to break through the possession enough to see what is happening outside her mind and is horrified to see Arba holding her younger brother Hakuryuu over the ocean by his throat. She starts to invoke this trope but then stops herself.
    
    **Hakuei**: You _hurt_ him, you're choking him, let — !
    
    The words _let him go_ almost spilled from her mouth but she pulled them back just in time; if she'd said _that,_ then Arba would just let him fall to the waves below and make her watch him drown, wouldn't she?
    
-   The protagonist drops the antagonist on demand in Harry Potter: Master of Malicious Compliance'' — Draco Malfoy doesn't pay attention to the moving staircase he's trying to bully Harry Potter on, so Draco falls and ends up dangling from it with Harry catching him. Draco screams "Let go of me, you filthy Mudblood!" ...So Harry does.
    
    **Harry**: Poor choice of words, but okay.
    

    Films — Animated

-   _The Dark Knight_: The fight between Batman and the Joker at the party for Harvey Dent ends with the Joker taking Rachel hostage, first holding a gun to her head then shooting out the window behind them and hanging her out of it by one hand. When Batman says "Let her go.", Joker gives him a WTF look, says "Very poor choice of words!", and drops her. Fortunately for her, she slides down the angled windows below for a bit before truly falling, giving Batman enough time to dive out, grab her, and break their fall enough with his cape that when they land on a car, the impact isn't fatal.
-   The Anti Heroic variety showed up in _Commando_, after the fact:

-   In _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_, Will demands of Barbossa that he release Elizabeth. However, he "failed to specify when or where" to quote Barbossa, resulting in her being forced to walk the plank. They were near a deserted island though, so she didn't drown.
-   In _Analyze That_, Paul Viti and his bodyguard, Jelly, are interrogating a snitch, which leads to this exchange after they get their information.
    
    **Paul**: "Alright, pull him up."
    
    Jelly drops him.
    
    **Paul**: "What're you doin'? I said pull him up."
    
    **Jelly**: "No, you said drop him."
    
    **Paul**: "No... I said pull him up!"
    
    **Jelly**: "I specifically heard you say drop him!"
    
    **Paul**: "No, you heard what you wanted to hear."
    
    **Jelly**: "... you got me there."

When the heroes show up to save Joey, who's tied up over a fiery pit, Nancy (who, having fought Freddy before, should _really_ know better) shouts "let him go, Krueger!" Of course, Freddy replies, with a sarcastic bow, "your wish is my command": Joey's sent plummeting into the pit, and is only narrowly saved by the rest of the group.
-   This happens in the Disney/Walden Media movie version of _Prince Caspian_. When some Telmarines are about to dump Trumpkin, Bound and Gagged, into the river, Susan shoots an arrow and orders them to "drop him". They do so - unsurprisingly, into the river, and the boys jump in to save the dwarf while Susan dispatches the soldiers. Trumpkin is suitably unimpressed and treats Susan to a bit of snark once they're all back on dry land.
-   In a movie about the Dutch occupation of Indonesia, some soldiers have a prisoner tied upside down and are torturing him. An officer orders them to let the man go, so they cut the rope so he falls on his head and breaks his neck.

-   _Underworld (2003)_:

-   In _The Lone Ranger_, Butch Cavendish grabs Rebecca as a hostage during the final battle. When the Ranger orders him to let her go, Cavendish threatens to drop her off the side of the moving train. Subverted when the Ranger tells him to do it as she always seems to land on her feet.

    Real Life 

-   In 2010, Russian naval forces arrested a group of pirates that had taken over an oil tanker. However, due to what they saw as irregularities in international law, they had to release them. So they did - they were "released" into an inflatable boat, hundreds of miles from land and with no navigational equipment.
-   In 1952, police officers moved to arrest burglars Derek Bentley (age 19) and Christopher Craig (age 16) at a time when Craig had a revolver. Supposedly, after getting away from Detective Sergeant Frederick Fairfax, Bentley told Craig, "let him have it, Chris," which can be interpreted as an instruction to turn over the gun or an instruction to shoot. The latter interpretation was chosen, as Fairfax was shot in the shoulder as he managed to catch up to them. Shortly thereafter, Police Constable Sidney Miles made it onto the roof and was fatally shot. Craig and Bentley were found guilty of murder, Bentley was executed, and the execution was so controversial that it arguably led to the abolition of capital punishment in the U.K. In 1998, Bentley's murder conviction was posthumously quashed.
