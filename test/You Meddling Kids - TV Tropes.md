_"I played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites. That's why I framed Krusty! And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for these meddling kids."_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

When the Big Bads are finally brought to justice, they claim that they would've gotten away with it if it weren't for those "meddling kids" (or whoever it was who foiled their plot). They may be evil, but these guys give credit where credit is due. The classic form is, "And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!" The use of the phrase "meddling kids" is a classic Shout-Out to _Scooby-Doo_, especially if the Evil Plan involves a "Scooby-Doo" Hoax.

It's not "you meddling kids and that stupid dog"/"that dumb dog"/"your dog", although these turn up as a Shout-Out in other shows.

Subtrope to Spoofy-Doo. Not to be confused with those meddling executives or the Snooping Little Kid. May not apply if The Meddling Kids Are Useless.

-   Referenced directly in the Gag Dub of _Ghost Stories_, where Hajime exclaims, "And you would've gotten away with it too, if not for us meddling kids. I've been waiting five volumes to make that joke!"
-   In _One Piece_, the Straw Hat Pirates would often be those kids in East Blue, when the crew only consisted of teenagers who were not famous pirates yet. Especially Kuro was annoyed by this trope several times. When Luffy got his first bounty, their surroundings started thinking of them as actual pirates and not just bunch of a teenagers, however.
-   The Rubberrobo Gang tends to use the phrase verbatim in _Medabots_.
-   Professor Cobra actually says this line in its entirety in an episode of the Season 3 dub of _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_. Ditto for Bakura in the original's Season 5.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_: For April Fools 2018, Pokémon Twitter account was taken by Team Rocket and they failed to catch Pikachu. When the plan failed, James says “We would’ve gotten away with it too.” and Meowth adds “If it weren’t for all you meddling twerps.”

    Comic Books 

-   There is an _Archie_ issue where Archie and Jughead solve a crime and the crooks are being led away in restraints by the police. One crook complains about being stopped by a bunch of dumb kids and Jughead fires back "This 'dumb kid' is not the one wearing handcuffs!"
-   In The DCU, Dick Grayson and Tim Drake investigate the sabotage of Grayson's circus. Eventually, they crack the case and catch the crooks. When one of the crooks says this quote, Grayson dismisses it saying that they were sloppy and the police would have figured it out on their own. However, since that would have created some really embarrassing press for the circus, it was better that two Robins took care of this.
-   The _Pinky and the Brain_ story in the second-to-last issue of the _Animaniacs_ comic book gave a Shout-Out to this in the form of Pinky's response to that issue's Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering?:
    
    **Pinky:** I think so, Brain. But would the villains really _have_ gotten away with it, if it weren't for those pesky kids and their dog?
    
-   Klarion (bum bum BUM!) the Witch Boy inverted this in an issue of _Young Justice_. "I would've got away with it if it wasn't for you meddling grown-ups." Which is even cooler if you realize the grown-ups in question were kids in grown-up bodies.
-   _The Simpsons_ comic book once parodied this trope when Lisa, Bart and Milhouse exposed one of Burns' plans:
    
    **Burns:** Without you and your dog, I might have succeeded!  
    **Lisa:** But we don't have any dog!  
    **Burns:** Oh, it must be one of mine then. _\[cut to one of his guard hounds growling behind the kids\]_ I would advise you to run...
    
-   _The Boys_ gives us the Scotland version: "But I woulda got away wi' it, if it hadnae been for ye pesky interferin' wee cunts!"

    Fan Works

-   In _Arkham Patient Sessions_, Batman's past-his-prime Starter Villain Dr. Death indulges in a Scooby-Doo reference as he reminisces about the first crime he ever committed:
-   In _The Day the Dursleys Came to Hogwarts_ Ludo Bagman attempts to steal eggs from the Triwizard Tournament dragons so he can pay his gambling debts to the goblins, only to be foiled by Harry and his friends.
    
    **Alastor Moody:** I think that \[the goblins\] were just trying to remind Bagman that he owes them money.  
    **Ludo Bagman:** And I could have paid them back with the dragon eggs if it wasn't for you meddling kids!
    
-   In _This Means War,_ the warden of Azkaban is accused of taking bribes in exchange for releasing certain Death Eaters.
    
    **Claudia Striven:** I followed all the ridiculous rules and no one suspected a thing, until your last inspection. I would have gotten away with it too, if it hadn’t been for you pesky kids.
    
-   Invoked by a very amused Varric in the first installment of _Skyhold Academy Yearbook_, when Evvy uncovers some secretive wrongdoing. "And they would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for that meddling art teacher."
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_:
    
    **Pegasus:** I can't believe I failed. All I wanted to do was steal an ancient Egyptian artifact, seize control of a billion dollar company, and resurrect my dead wife. And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling—  
    **Bakura:** Don't you even _think_ of making a _Scooby-Doo_ reference!
    
-   In _Like a Red-Headed Stepchild_ a _Daily Prophet_ article claims Sirius said this right before escaping from Hogwarts.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Hey Arnold! The Movie_ ends like this when Scheck gets arrested for attempting to commit illegal demolition (after being caught by his own surveillance cameras burning the document that proves he can't demolish the neighborhood in front of Arnold and Gerald) and says "And I would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for that meddling football head, that kid the weird stack of hair, and that brat with the one eyebrow."
-   In _Toy Story 3_, Mr. Potato Head delivers this line in the background while he's busted for distracting the security team in Sunnyside. Except they are "meddling toys".
    
    **Mr. Potato Head**: Yeah, and I would've got away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling toys!
    
-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Magical Movie Night_: The special "Movie Magic" is plot-wise very close to a _Scooby-Doo_ episode. The actual line, however, isn't spoken till the next episode, "Mirror Magic", where the girls meet again with the culprit.
    
    **Juniper Montage**: Ooh! This should be _my_ night! I would have found a way to be in the film if _you_ all had stayed out of it! I would have been Daring Do! Everyone would've loved me!
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In several episodes of _The Little Rascals_, the children successfully battled evil grown-ups, making this trope Older Than Television. It is arguably the Ur-Example.
-   The first _Wayne's World_ movie had Multiple Endings including a nonsensical Scooby-Doo one which used the phrase, "you snooping kids!"
-   _Scooby-Doo (2002)_:
    -   In the 2002 feature film, you have this variation:
        
        **Velma:** These balloons fill with a highly potent helium synthesis, giving the Luna Ghost his weightless appearance.  
        **Smithers:** I would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids and your dumb dog! I'll get you for this!
        
    -   Then at the end as Scrappy-Doo is arrested...
        
        **Scrappy-Doo**: I would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling sons of–– _\[chopper door slams shut\]_
        
    -   In the 2004 sequel _Scooby-Doo: Monsters Unleashed_, the real identity of the Evil Masked Figure Dr. Jonathan Jacobo says it.
        
        **Dr. Jonathan Jacobo:** I would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling punks and their dumb dog!
        
-   A non-villainous example occurs in _Message in a Cell Phone_. The guy who previously pretended to be Felix Reiser turns out to be good, and he gives credit to the three main kids for bringing the Big Bad to justice.

    Literature 

-   A main theme of the _Animorphs_ series, where the kids were constantly foiling plots by the Yeerks. Ironically though, the Yeerks were unaware of the fact they were foiled by kids, believing instead they were fighting Andalite warriors.
-   This happens with most of _The Famous Five_ books, and played especially straight in _Five Get Into Trouble_, when the villain Mr Perton lists all the fortunes he would made, until a pack of children spoilt everything.
-   Harry Potter and his two closest friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger have thwarted numerous threats coming from adult wizards.
-   One of the Troperiffic chapter headings in _Soon I Will Be Invincible_ is "And Now For Those Meddling Children".
-   A line similar to this is delivered at several points, in dialogue or narration, in _Galaxy of Fear_, since the Arranda siblings and their uncle have an uncanny ability to stumble into trouble and foil plans.
-   Most of the book series of the Stratemeyer Syndicate involved meddling kids in numbers from one (Nancy Drew) to six.
-   The basic plot of the _Mysteries_ specials in _The Baby-Sitters Club_ series.
-   Thomas Pynchon's _Bleeding Edge_ mentions a (fictional) Scooby-Doo movie in which the gang join up with some Colombian street urchins to fight a South American drug lord. Predictably, it ends with the villain proclaiming that he would have gotten away with it "if not for you Medellín kids."
-   One _Heralds of Valdemar_ short story features the line "I would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling Heralds!"
-   _Meddling Kids_ by Edgar Cantero is an homage to the whole concept and the trope namers (although they also have elements of The Famous Five, including being called the Blyton Summer Detective Club). The meddling kids are now in their mid twenties and return to the lakeside community where they unmasked their last monster as teenagers only to end up confronting real Lovecraftian horrors.
-   In _Keeper of the Lost Cities_ a spin is put on this trope: Mr. Forkle, the grumpy mentor/dad figure, has an iconic line in the form of "You kids."
-   The Gorbals Die-Hards provide invaluable assistance to Dickson McCunn in John Buchan's _Huntingtower_.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Stargate SG-1_, Daniel says "And you would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for us meddling kids" after a bounty hunter fails to capture SG-1. That line is made even funnier when you realize that Michael Shanks ad libbed it because he hates when the characters explain to the villain what the audience already knows.
-   _The Sarah Jane Adventures_' teenaged protagonists, with help from Intrepid Reporter Sarah Jane, meddle often in the plans of would-be alien invaders.
-   Seen at the end of an episode of _NUMB3RS_ in which Don, his team and his brother Charlie investigate spooky activity at a supposedly abandoned airbase. That was more of an inversion, though, as it was very ambiguous whether the person that said it was a villain at all, and he had helped them solve the case. He was also very wacky, talked in an invisible cell phone and appeared out of thin air. He also called three professors and an FBI agent meddling kids.
-   Given a Shout-Out by Adam in an episode of _MythBusters_ where the Build Team gets him to walk across hot coals unprepared in order to see if it really is a case of mind over matter. After he supposedly hurts himself<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  by running:
    
    _"And I would have made it across too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!"_
    

-   Said almost verbatim by the obnoxious aristocrat Ashton in the _Suite Life on Deck_ episode "Kidney of the Sea," when London's dog Ivana literally sniffs out the evidence that he had attempted to frame Zack for grand theft.
-   Said verbatim by _Castle_ (putting words in the Killer of the Week's mouth) in "Wrapped Up In Death". It helps that the episode included multiple shout outs to Indiana Jones and Scooby-Doo.
-   Happened on the _Shake it Up_ episode entitled "Whodunit Up" when they catch the custodian who kinda gives himself away, but the kids from the show are the first ones who realize who is the culprit.
-   Hugh Dennis puts a spin on it for _Mock the Week_ final round Scenes We'd Like To See.
    
    **Hugh:** And the janitor would've got away with it, too, if it hadn't been for _the photographs_ he'd taken of those _pesky kids_!
    
-   At the end of the _Supernatural_/_Scooby-Doo_ Crossover "Scoobynatural", Jay says the line, much to Dean's glee.
-   Referenced and parodied in a sketch on _Harry Hill's TV Burp_ making fun of Derek Acorah's _Ghost Towns_, in which the ghost turned out to be Harry with a sheet over his head.
    
    **"Daniella Westbrook":** It's Harry Hill!
    
    **Harry:** That's right, and I would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling... _(looks around to see the cast members are all old)_ ... idiots.
    

    Radio 

-   _Dead Ringers:_ Spoofed when it turns out Gareth Southgate, manager of the England football team in 2021, was replaced just before the final by a previous manager who wanted to sabotage them, and is exposed by Shaggy and Scooby. He declares he would've gotten away with it "if it weren't for you meddling cartoon characters!"
-   Happens in an early radio episode of _Our Miss Brooks_, titled _Student Government Day_. Taking over their duly elected roles as mayor and police chief for a day, Harriet Conklin and Walter Denton raid "The Jackpot Amusement Company," a gambling ring placing crooked slot machines in the backrooms of candy stores. This is only after they're allowed out of jail by the sleazy mayor, who needs them to run the gangsters out of town after they become more trouble than the cut he's getting from them.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Magic: The Gathering_, the Unhinged joke set has a card called Meddling Kids, which is also a reference to the real card Meddling Mage.
-   _Meddling Kids_ is the title of a RPG loosely based on _Scooby-Doo_ and its kin.
-   _Hecatomb_ had a card named after this trope that would drain the mana of opponents.
    
    **Dr. Gilman:** Little bastards.
    

    Theater 

-   Older Than Steam: In William Shakespeare's _Much Ado About Nothing_, after the inept police manage to catch Borachio, the henchman who framed Hero, the heroine, he says (to the noblemen he completely fooled): "What your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light."

    Video Games 

-   In _Golden Sun: The Lost Age_, one of the pirates delivers the line if you visit them in jail after turning them over to the local government.
-   An optional line of dialogue in _Sonic Chronicles_. If you know how this goes, you'll know what to say.
-   Baron K. Roolenstein (actually, just K. Rool under a Mad Scientist guise), the main antagonist of _Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!_, uses this line verbatim after his robot KAOS is defeated a second time.
-   In _Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire_, the Team Aqua/Magma goons accuse you of being a meddling kid after you stop them from stealing the Devon Goods _again_ in Slateport.
-   Used by the Prophet in _Final Fantasy X-2_ if he is fingered as the culprit in the Mi'ihen Highroad mystery sequence. Complete with him speaking in his only voiced appearance in the game in voice that sounds just like Shaggy from _Scooby Doo_.
-   In the web game _Sonny 2_, one villain says this after being defeated and unmasked. This is clearly a lampshade, as the characters in question are not actually kids.
-   The human-disguised Harmoire says this when the hero and Curry capture him to foil his plans for the Sleuthhound Inn involving making the furniture come alive in _AdventureQuest Worlds_.
    
    **Curry**: I can't believe you dunit! How dare you do this to the Sleuthhound Inn!  
    **Harmoire**: And I would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids!
    
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   From _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_:
        
        **Ganondorf:** The great Evil King Ganondorf, beaten by this kid?!
        
    -   Link has pretty much made a career of being this trope. Granted, destiny usually plays a hand in it, but even when it doesn't, he's still prone to meddling in whatever plan some villain is brewing up.
-   _Champions Online_: Parodied in the ending of the _GRAB the Money and Run_ alert.
    
    **Cheshire Cat:** We would've gotten away with it too, if not for those meddlesome...  
    **Black Diamond:** Oh, put a sock in it!
    
-   _BlazBlue_:
    -   One of the things Hazama is known to chide Makoto over during _Continuum Shift_ is how she "puts her nose where it doesn't belong". The big problem with this statement is that they're both NOL Intelligence officers (he's her CO, at that), meaning that he's lecturing her over doing _the very thing she is being paid for_. Given how little Intelligence work he does (onscreen, anyway), he's in no position to tell her what she should or shouldn't be doing, so it's safe to say that if he ever brings this up, things are going to turn violent right now.
    -   The end of _Slight Hope_ has Hazama spouting this trope at the proper time, with intent to torture and/or kill her over it as well.
        
        **Hazama:** Honestly, though... I never expected YOU to turn out to be the proverbial squirrel in the ointment. Am I supposed to accept that this is another result of the continuum shift? I can't believe it's affecting the timeline like this... \[...\] Might as well ask for a pony, too, so long as you're wishing for unlikely things. Thanks to your flittering around doing as you please, my plans have gone fair-to-middling FUBAR! You're really starting to grate upon my nerves — sorry, but it's true. Relius was going to take care of you, but _shit_... I just don't think I can **WAIT** that long...
        

-   Naturally, this is quoted at the end of the Scooby-Doo level in _LEGO Dimensions_, although with Lord Vortech addressing Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle instead of the members of Mystery Incorporated.
-   In _Spandex Force 2: Superhero U_ Agent Stalker says this after the player character and several other students beat his Giant Robot.
-   In _Matchington Mansion_ Rex dresses up as a Bedsheet Ghost to scare Tiffany into selling him the mansion, only to be unmasked by her dog.
    
    **Tiffany:** Wait, Rex? What are you doing?  
    **Rex:** Trying to scare you out of this mansion! And I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids and that dog!
    
-   _Octopath Traveler_:
    -   Russell, the first boss of Cyrus's story, is caught making a verbal slip that gives away that he stole the tome _The Church of the Sacred Flame: A Complete Historie_.
        
        **Russell:** D-damn it! Damn it all to hell! It was the perfect plan! If not for your bloody meddling, I could have had it all!
        
    -   The main antagonist of Ophilia's story, Mattias, has a Villainous Breakdown when Ophilia reminds her adoptive Lianna of a time in their childhood when their (adoptive) father Josef taught them about remembering those who have died so that their legacies live on, giving Lianna the strength to stop the dark ritual she initiated in a desperate attempt to resurrect Josef. During his breakdown, Mattias shouts this at Ophilia:
        
        **Mattias:** You would insist on meddling until the very last. It all would have succeeded if only Lianna had been the one to perform the Kindling.
        
-   _Scooby-Doo: Monsters Unleashed_: Said by the Evil Masked Figure in the PC version as well as the voice of Wickles Manor.
-   One side quest in _Puzzle Adventure_ involves catching a murderous skinwalker.
    
    **Vesemir:** Got you now, chump!  
    **Skinwalker:** Grrrr! I'd get away with it if it weren't for the nosy kid!
    
-   A _Barbie_ PC computer game _Detective Barbie In the Mystery of the Carnival Caper!_ features Barbie solving a mystery at a carnival. One outcome involves the suspect trying to steal charity money who comments "which I would have gotten just fine no thanks to you meddling kids."

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney Investigations_ has this at the end.
    
    **Quercus Alba:** And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling prosecutors!
    

    Web Animation 

-   A variation occurs in one April Fool's Day Episode of _The Annoying Orange_:
    
    **Midget Apple**: And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for that pesky Knife!
    
-   Parodied in the April Fool's Episode of _Red vs. Blue_. It Makes Sense in Context:
    
    **Grif:** What the hell?! You just killed Simmons' ghost!  
    **Donut:** Wrong! That wasn't Simmons! It was Old Man Caboose!  
    **Caboose:** That's right! It's me. Caboose!  
    **Omega (through Caboose):** And I would have gotten away with it too! If it wasn't for you meddling kids!
    
-   _Neko Sugar Girls_ uses a variant:
    
    **Kidnapper**: I would have had my way with him if not for those meddling kodomos!
    
-   A _How It Should Have Ended_ spoof of _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ has Captain America and his allies plan to foil HYDRA's scheme by tying up Alexander Pierce, then having Cap disguise as him and address the HYDRA moles. After they complete the first part offscreen, Pierce bellows the following:
    
    **Pierce:** And I would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you sneaky kids and your disguise-o-mesh!
    
-   As part of a Scooby-Doo parody during an episode of _RWBY Chibi_, Team JNPR unmasked a Beowulf Grimm to be the old man shopkeeper, who mumbling could barely be made out to be the famous phrase.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   In an effort to avoid bad guys swearing revenge on you _How to Hero_ suggests that when a bad guy claims he would've succeeded had it not been for "you meddling kids" you should sit him down and explain to him all the flaws in his plan that would've prevented him from succeeding, even if you and your meddling friends hadn't interfered. The guide is confident that upon seeing their mistake the bad guy will declare revenge on themselves.
-   In Team Four Star's _Bloodborne_ series, Takahata remarks that their character Dumplestilskin looks like the kind of guy who would put on a costume to scare away a group of mystery-solving teenagers.
    
    **Lanipator (in Dumplestilskin voice):** And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you damn kids!
    
-   _Whateley Universe_. In "Razzle Dazzle", once mighty supervillain Mephisto the Mentalist bemoans how far he'd sunken after his glory days with a flashback to when he pulled a haunted house scam, only to get caught by the requisite Scooby Gang-expy.
    
    “BAH!” Mephisto snorted, “I would have gotten away, if not for that stupid DOG of yours!”
    

    Western Animation 

-   Numberblocks's fandom was little kids, usually the add rounds or blueberry inflation videos.
-   The Trope Namer: While the exact wording varied, several episodes of the original _Scooby-Doo_ series ended in this vein, and it eventually took off and became series' Catchphrase - to the point where it being either used or parodied at the end of every single plot was a core part of the franchise's formula. Like a lot of now iconic Scooby tropes, it's constant use started mostly with _A Pup Named Scooby-Doo,_ which also consistently added "...and that mangy mutt!" It gets to the point where the gang can quote it themselves, and outright expect it (_Cyber Chase_ even has them finishing it for the bad guy).
    -   Later series liked to lampoon, twist or even upend the phrase, like having the speaker _thank_ the kids for meddling, having them mince the words around ("Hey, are you meddling... kids?") or trip up the delivery ("we would've gotten revenge on you meddling kids if not for you... er... meddling kids."), blame someone else or have it pointed out to them that they probably wouldn't have gotten away with at all, use different terminology in different situations (like children culprits calling them "meddling grown-ups" or a classmate calling them "meddling peers") and other such gags (such as "And I'll still get away with it, in spite of you meddling kids!").
    -   _Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated_ holds one of the more remembered lampshades in its very first episode.
        
        **"Monster":** That is until you...  
        **Sheriff:** _Meddling_.  
        **"Monster":** Meddling, yes, meddling kids, and your blasted dog ruined everything!
        
    -   In _Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire_, the group investigates the bizarre circumstances surrounding a music festival by posing as a band. Naturally, they're known as "Those Meddling Kids". Similarly, it's the name of one of the songs by recurring characters the Hex Girls.
    -   _The Scooby-Doo Project_ hangs a lampshade on this when the 'monster' calls them intrusive instead.
        
        **Shaggy:** Like, he didn't say 'meddling'! Doesn't he know the drill?
        
    -   _Scooby-Doo! Shaggy's Showdown_: Rafe says this after being exposed and caught as the mastermind behind Dapper Jack's ghost. Zeke adds a "nosy horse" (actually Scooby-Doo but Zeke's too near-sighted to realize Scooby's not a dog).
    -   Similar sentiments were often expressed in other Hanna-Barbera shows about crime-fighting teen with comic pet sidekicks: _Josie and the Pussycats_, _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids_, _The Funky Phantom_, _Speed Buggy_, _Clue Club_, and _Jabberjaw_. During the 2000s and early 2010s, Boomerang had a whole block devoted to such shows. Guess the name...
-   Episode 4 of _The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan_ has the crook calling the children "lousy kid detectives" after Anne and Flip foil his escape.
-   Subverted in the 100th episode of _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_, (in a _Scooby-Doo_ parody, no less) when the number 100's dubious plan is foiled.
    
    **Number 100:** And I would have succeeded, too, if it weren't for the fact that I failed.
    
-   Parodied (amongst other villain Stock Catchphrases) with Dr Animo in _Ben 10: Omniverse_:
    
    **Animo:** CURSE YOU, Tennyson! Curse you and your meddling way!  
    **Ben:** _\[to Rook\]_ I told you he talked like that!
    
-   The Season 4 premier episode of _Celebrity Deathmatch_ uses this, when Johnny Gomez discovers that John Tesh killed Bob Costas in order to take his place as special guest spectator.
    
    **Tesh:** And I would've gotten away with it too, if it hadn't been for your meddling sportscasters.
    
-   _Class of 3000_: The episode "Prank Yankers" has Sunny revealing popular school girls Kaylie and Mackenzie to be international chalk thieves by the names of Inga and Gunther Gabinstad who wanted to steal his chalk.
    
    **Inga:** Ja-und we would've, like, gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for these meddling kids!  
    **Gunther:** Whatever!
    
-   Scooby-Doo expy _Clue Club_. More than a few villains expressed frustration that they would have gotten away with it if not for the "nosy" kids. Possibly adding insult to injury, at least a few of them only cited "three nosy kids", utterly discounting Dotty's contributions. Possibly justified. Larry and the others insisted on leaving Dotty at home to keep her safe. Revealing to desperate, potentially dangerous men that she cracked most of the clues might have put her in danger.
-   In the _Corn & Peg_ episode, "Galloping Ghost", it used a similar format used from the original series, in which Corn, Peg, and Ferris solve the mystery of the Galloping Ghost, and turns out to be Ferris's little brother Ferdy sleepwalking to get cookies, but didn't say the Meddling Kids phrase.
-   Lampshaded in _Danny Phantom_ - 'I always wanted to be called a meddling kid!'
-   A Shout-Out appears in the _Daria_ episode "I Loathe a Parade" when an obnoxiously overenthusiastic mascot collapses at Daria's feet because he can't breathe through his lion costume and Daria charitably pulls the head off.
    
    **Mr O'Neill:** Oh.. hello... where am I?  
    **Daria:** I can't believe it, it's Mr O'Neill!  
    **Tom:** And he would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for us meddling kids!
    
-   Parodied in the _Darkwing Duck_ episode, "Clash Reunion":
-   In the _FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman_ episode "Ruffman Manor is Haunted!" The butler in the said manor is the culprit who haunts it because he likes "being the boss".
    
    **Gardener:** That's why we gave you these clues...

-   In the second episode of _Gravity Falls_, the Pines twins find out that a giant lake monster was actually a robot controlled by resident crazy person McGucket.

-   In episode "Tick, Tick, Tick" of _Kim Possible_, as Kim approaches the villain (her eventual archfoe Dr. Drakken)'s island lair in which she's told is haunted and includes a sign. "'Haunted island'? Keep out 'meddling kids'? _Puh-leze_."

-   _The Simpsons_: In "Krusty Gets Busted", Sideshow Bob takes this to its logical conclusion, adding "Treat kids as equals! They're smarter than you think!" Considering that he had spent most of his time that episode running quality children's programming, it's an especially good point.

    -   Oddly enough, no variant of the line is used whatsoever in "Korn's Groovy Pirate Mystery", despite the entire episode being an Affectionate Parody of _Scooby-Doo_.
-   In the 1973-74 _Superfriends_ episode "The Balloon People", after Noah Tall is captured by Superman, he says "I could have gotten away with it if it weren't for you, Superman."
-   Played straight in _The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!_ episode "20,000 Leaks Under the Sea", when Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  discover that "King Koopa" (AKA: King Bowser) was using a submarine shaped like a sea monster to trick the residents of a seaside town into making him their king.
