_"Whoever hits the most manatees wins!"_

Be aware! The wild is just filled with Evil Poachers willing to murder any human who gets in their way. Poaching means any illegal hunting, but in fiction it is usually associated with the hunting of endangered species, such as cute panda babies or meddling kids.

Many Evil Poachers have no motivation to hunt and threaten people other than to be evil, which puts them on the same level as the various Green Aesop villains who seemingly pollute out of malice rather than because they are manufacturing anything. If Evil Poachers do get a motive, it will probably be selling their prey on the Black Market.

Hunting Is Evil is the supertrope.

Evil Poachers are Villains By Default in a Kids' Wilderness Epic, a genre in which they tend to end up as slapstick idiots dressed in scary animal skins, sometimes resulting in them seeming less threatening than real poachers can be.

In Real Life, poachers are a diverse group. They include subsistence poachers (the vast majority) and farmers, commercial poachers, organized crime, rebel and insurgent militia, military and corrupt officials (the most untouchable), wildlife traffickers, buyers of various animal parts, and illegal trophy hunters. While some are poor people trying to get out of poverty, this is not the case for all of them, though in the case of the ones that are poor, they are typically unable to afford a license. This is also a major reason why poor poachers will often target endangered animals - the rarity of their parts increases the value. However, they do often shoot at park rangers if they encounter them (they're the reason why most rangers in Africa are heavily armed) and are often hired by people in organized crime (which means media that _does_ acknowledge the average poacher's real circumstances is likely to reserve this trope for the mobsters who hire them). It must be noted however, that some fictional poachers do not fit into any of the aformentioned categories. If a poacher does fit any of them, they will typically be a commercial poacher. In addition, due to the various types, their motives vary, with the motives for rebel and insurgent militias for example being to fund their battle against local ethnic groups, state militaries and other militias, making them as far from a real-life example of Tragic Villain as you can possibly get and some poachers-turned-ranger have reported individuals who poach for entertainment rather than for food, money or to fund a campaign.

The inversion, Roguish Poacher, is most common in older works, particularly fairy tales and Folk Music. The Roguish Poacher always hunts for food (usually for his starving family) and lives in a Peter Rabbit-vs-Farmer MacGregor kind of relationship with the Evil Fatcat Landowner. If the two _do_ come into conflict, expect Evil Versus Evil to come into play. Compare Karmic Thief.

Subtrope of Classical Hunter, as well as Ecocidal Antagonist, since poaching is portrayed as damaging to the ecosystem. A sister trope to the Egomaniac Hunter. Compare with Cruella to Animals and Human Traffickers. Contrast the Hunter Trapper, who hunts and traps legally and is much more likely to see reason; the Roguish Poacher, this guy's Justified Criminal counterpart; and the Great White Hunter, the heroic counterpart.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Doraemon_ movies:
    -   Right in the first movie, _Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur_ has Nobita, Doraemon and friends being menaced by the Dinosaur Hunters, the Starter Villain of the entire franchise, a group of futuristic poachers who wanted to steal Nobita's new baby dinosaur, Piisuke, for themselves, and are not above shooting at the gang when their demands are refused.
    -   _Doraemon: Nobita and the Kingdom of Clouds_ has a band of poachers arrested by the Sky People while they're slaughtering a family of elephants in Africa. These poachers managed to escape custody, steal one of the Sky People's transports, and later hijacks a powerful WMD from Doraemon intending to destroy the Kingdom of Clouds out of spite.
    -   _Doraemon: Nobita and the Island of Miracles ~Animal Adventure~_ is set in the titular futuristic nature reserve where Doraemon and friends are inevitably stranded upon when another group of poachers from the future attacks the place with their giant robots. They also have a number of enslaved animals via Obediance Collars which they command to attack the gang.
    -   Subverted in _Doraemon: Nobita's New Dinosaur_, a remake of the first Doraemon movie, which have Nobita becoming the owner of _two_ pet dinosaurs, and once again the gang are stalked by a mysterious entity who took interest in Nobita's new pets. But it turns out they're actually a division of the Time Police and _on the side of good_, though the Dinosaur Hunters from the first film gets name-dropped as a Continuity Nod.
-   _Dragon Ball Super_: Android 17 is revealed to be working as a ranger on an island sanctuary for endangered species, so his primary enemies are some (distressingly well-armed) poachers. In the episode in which Goku visits to recruit him for the Tournament of Power, some _alien_ poachers also show up, leading to 17 and Goku to team up to defeat them.
-   Viper Snakely in _Kimba the White Lion_. Known as Hamegg in the original manga.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_ - One of the reasons why the Time-Space Administration Bureau's Frontier Nature Conservation Corps exists is the presence of poachers who disregard the nature protection laws. One of them even tried to put a bullet between the eyes of a 13-year-old officer when she arrived to arrest him in _StrikerS Sound Stage X_. Granted, said officer was patrolling the grounds on a giant dragon and had a partner who could deflect bullets, but still...
-   _Shaman King_ - Horohoro runs into a trio of poachers. This horrible encounter changes his whole perspective on life.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_ - Since the setting of the series involves people catching many creatures for various reasons (most often to use in official sports competitions or as pets and companions) as a way of life, it has to designate its Evil Poachers differently:
    -   An easy way to spot a poacher is if he is using any tools beyond a Poké Ball, such as nets or cages. If he is using a Poké Ball, is it a regular Poké Ball or a modified one that never misses its capture (like Mewtwo's balls (though he wasn't specifically an Evil Poacher) or the Dark Balls (which brainwashes captured Pokémon and turns them into fighting machines) used by the Iron Masked Marauder)? Are they attempting to capture more than one Pokémon of a certain type at a time, outside of a designated Safari Zone? And most obviously, does the targeted Pokémon clearly already belong to someone else?
    -   Team Rocket often poaches, for example in the Safari Zone episode. There was also a trio of poachers that caused Larvitar to be separated from its mom, and the one Team Rocket fought who was capturing Poison-type Pokémon in this way; Arbok and Weezing were let go to help them when the Pokémon were freed.
    -   However, most poachers shown capture Pokémon to sell them illegally, which fits in with the real life version of poaching. An episode of the series actually showed this a tad lighter by having a poacher reform.
    -   The character who most closely follows the traditional "evil poacher" mold, even more than Team Rocket, is probably Pokémon Hunter J from the _Diamond and Pearl_ seasons. She had a device that could turn Pokémon -- and people -- into living statues to sell on the black market, repeatedly tried to _kill_ Ash, and was the first recurring character in the anime to be Killed Off for Real. She's so ruthless and evil that even Team Rocket are afraid of her.
    -   One episode of the _XY_ anime has an example that actually ends up Leaning on the Fourth Wall a bit. The episode's villain, Dolan, is a poacher who specializes in smuggling Vivillon and its pre-evolutions, as Vivillon have varying wing patterns that are sought after by collectors. In the games, Vivillon's wing pattern depends on the real-life part of the world its pre-evolutions were found in (i.e. the Modern pattern being located in the central/southeastern United States); naturally, there are plenty of collectors out there willing to do whatever they have to do in order to get all the patterns, much like the collectors Dolan caters to.
-   _Toriko_ has these by the dozen, since certain foods could be hunted to extinction, but the most dangerous of these are the Gourmet Corp.

    Comic Books 

-   Animal Man joined Ra's al Ghul in _Injustice 2_ to save the endangered animals of the world because he brutally murdered a group of Evil Poachers who killed the last rhino in Cameroon.

-   _The Legend of Wonder Woman (2016)_: Just in case it wasn't already clear that the woman is not nice just from her gleeful murder of hundreds and willingly allying herself with the Nazis Priscilla Rich's home is full of animal trophies from her safari exploits, most of which are of endangered animals.
-   _Proof_: Col. Werner Dachsund hunts cryptids (the extremely endangered species that the protagonists' organization, The Lodge, exists to protect) for sport and eats them. Many cryptids are sentient, which doesn't deter him in the slightest. In fact, his main goal in the arc is to hunt the Lodge's star agent, John Prufrock (a.k.a. Bigfoot).
-   _The Punisher_ once runs into two of these guys while rescuing a Mafia don from a South American prison camp so the don can call a meeting, ensuring Frank can kill a crapload of Mafia higher-ups. We know they're evil because they spend a page explaining, to each other, that they will torture whatever animal they caught in their nets before selling it to the highest bidder.
-   _Robin (1993)_: In addition to making snuff films Amsel Reiniger is also credited with tracking and personally causing the extinction of multiple endangered species for fun. He also filmed himself doing that and sold the videos to make a profit of it.
-   Evil poachers were a common foe in _Sheena, Queen of the Jungle_.
-   In _Shaman's Tears_, the first criminals Joshua Brand stops after gaining his powers were poachers who were stealing wild horses from the Indian reservation to sell for pet food.
-   In _Supergirl_ storyline "The Super-Steed of Steel", Gorbin, the co-owner of a ruinous sea circus, decides to sail to Zone X, an area where fishing was declared ilegal because that is Atlantis' territory, and catch two merpeople to add to his show's exhibits. After hailing Lori and Jerro out of the water, Gorbin refuses to put them into water tank right away, considering they will be easier to handle if they are half-suffocated.

    Comic Strips 

-   A common foe in _Jungle Jim_.
-   _Modesty Blaise_:
    -   The dolphin hunter Gaspar in the arc "Dossier on Pluto".
    -   The poachers in "Million Dollar Game".

    Fan Works 

-   Every time Jake England, EVIL POACHER shows up in _Dave Stdider Pokemon Traner_ he is literally called this.
-   Dialogue in the outtakes for Episode 10 of _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_ implies that Alucard ate one of these.
    
    _You_ killed _the last white rhino?! ...Hope the boner was worth it,_ ya fuck.
    
-   Glintlock in _Manehattan's Lone Guardian_ is wanted in the Griffon Kingdom for hunting illegally, and has willingly thrown in his lot with Cocoa Mocha in his quest to depose Celestia, wanting to regain his freedom by force.
-   _The Pieces Lie Where They Fell_: The sequel _Picking up the Pieces_ mentions that they exist and target the star beasts, whose numbers have greatly decreased with magic's failing (though its return has helped them a great deal). Preventing this is one thing that Tizoc and King Well Banded can agree on.
-   _Prehistoric Earth_: Whilst the men in Percival's dino-trafficking operation are technically animal smugglers, due to the animals they're going after not being legally protected, as a result of being de-extinct, they otherwise fit the stereotype perfectly in that they're cruel, greedy men who capture and kill rare and exotic animals and are not above attempting to kill people who get in their way. Their leader, Frank even wears a necklace of dinosaur teeth around his neck.
-   Clan Fletching in _The Tainted Grimoire_ has been poaching creatures for profit. One of them decides to cooperate with the authorities when told that his daughter, for whom he is doing this, might not be able to look at him should she discover what he is doing. The other two, however, play this completely straight.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Beauty and the Beast_ Gaston has some attributes of evil poacher combined with his general nature as an Egomaniac Hunter, though it's hardly the worst thing about him.
-   _The Rescuers Down Under_ brings us Percival C. McLeach, voiced by George C. Scott. Did we mention he has a scope _shotgun?_ Now there's a guy who loves to see the faces of his victims before he riddles them full of holes. He also sings this jolly-sounding but macabre song while he drives back to his camp in a giant, notified half-track he built himself:
    
    **McLeach**: Home, home on the range! Where the critters are tied up in chains! I cut through their sides, and I rip off their hides! And the next day I do it again! EVERYBODY!
    
-   The overall Big Bad of _Rio_ is a poacher named Marcel. However, he's played rather realistically in that while he's a bad guy, he's not an outright evil sadist who loves hurting animals; he's just greedy and uncaring about the animals' well-being. He poaches to get money, not because he likes to see birds suffer. _That_ particular personality trait is given to his pet cockatoo and Dragon-in-Chief, Nigel, instead.
-   _Tarzan_: Clayton combines attributes of the Evil Poacher and the Egomaniac Hunter, though he might not be the former. Yes, he is there to capture gorillas, but in those days that is typically how such animals were brought to civilization, not through breeding programs in zoos. With this in mind, Clayton is most likely either a subversion or an outright aversion, in that while he is evil, he isn't actually a poacher, with his actual crimes being mutiny (as his men were from the ship's crew) and attempted murder.
-   Charles Muntz from _Up_. He is so desperate and determined to bring the famed 'Monster of Paradise Falls' back to civilization alive so as to prove that his claims about it are true after having been discredited and sent falling from grace in the past that he's willing to straight up _murder_ any and all people he subsequently sees at Paradise Falls out of an insane belief that they'll try to do so before him even when said people weren't even aware of the existence of him _or_ said monster.
-   _The Wild Thornberrys Movie_: Bree and Sloan Blackburn are perfectly willing to kidnap and murder kids just to be able to keep poaching endangered African wildlife.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Alaska: Perry is a poacher who sells skins for profit and, during the film, intends to capture a polar bear cub alive to sell to rich clients.
-   In _Anaconda_, Paul Sarone is a Paraguayan former priest who decided to become a snake poacher in the Amazon instead, capturing them for rich clients. It's revealed that he's been manipulating the whole crew from the beginning and was using them to capture the Anaconda.
-   The main antagonists of _Blastfighter_ are a bunch of poachers who kill deer for profit.
-   _Beast (2022)_: The secondary antagonists in the film are a group of poachers, in the opening they are shown to be the ones responsible for slaughtering the Rogue lion’s pride which is what drove the animal into a rampage in the first place that resulted in the slaughter of an entire village. They show up later in the film and were prepared to immediately murder Dr. Nate Samuels and his family simply because they recognized their guide Martin as an anti-poacher until they became distracted when the Rogue Lion attacked.
-   Inverted in _"Crocodile" Dundee_ — the title character is a "croc poacher".
    -   Dundee's job was actually to catch dangerous crocodiles that represented a threat to humans. However, in the first movie, this trope is played straight with a group of poachers who are illegally spotlighting kangaroos for fun before Dundee uses a kangaroo disguise and a high-powered rifle to turn the tables on them.
-   Ricketts, the Big Bad in _A Far Off Place_, is running an illegal trade operation around the export of ivory. He has the protagonists’ parents murdered because they were investigating the operation.
-   In _Fair Game_, the villains are a gang of kangaroo poachers who illegally sell the meat to the dog food industry.
-   _Instinct_: A group of Ugandan poachers brutally shoot the gorillas who Powell lives with. He kills two and wounds others while attempting to stop the slaughter. He's convicted of murder for it, with the government saying the men were park rangers for an unknown reason.
-   The first people killed by the bear in _Into the Grizzly Maze_ are a group of poachers illegally hunting bears for body parts, and who tried to kill their guide when he objected to the number they were killing.
-   _Joey (1997)_ has the Kanga-Catcher, who captures kangaroos from the outback to force them to box in an underground gambling operation.
-   _Jumanji_: Van Pelt the hunter, although he preferred to hunt the deadliest of game.
-   In _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ Ken Wheatley is revealed to be a poacher-for-hire working for the Big Bad Eli Mills who wants to steal the dinosaurs and sell them on the black market, when he betrays the main characters and leaves them for dead on the island.
-   _Mighty Joe Young_: The main bad guys in the 1998 remake. Distinctly averted with Gregg O'Hara, who captures animals humanely, only takes blood samples and then releases them, despite the desires of some of the hunters he works with.
-   In _Mistress of the Apes_, Thurston is secretly the head of the largest poaching ring in Africa. He hires two local poachers, Brady and Sikes, to kill the other members of the expedition so they do not discover his secret.
-   _Rogue (2020)_ opens on a game farm that belonging to poachers who specialize in trafficking wild animals for the exotic pet trade and their body parts for traditional medicine, and running caged hunts for wealthy foreigners. A lioness about to be slaughtered for body parts escapes and kills most of the poachers.
-   _Tarzan and His Mate_ involves Arlington and Holt, who expect Tarzan to lead them to an Elephant Graveyard. It's debatable as to whether they count as this at the beginning, since ivory harvesting wasn't illegal at the time, but Arlington surely qualifies as he tries to murder Tarzan after Tarzan brings a stop to the expedition. The film certainly views ivory harvesting as Evil Poaching, as Tarzan and Jane return all the ivory to the graveyard at the end.
-   _Tremors 5: Bloodlines_: Erick Van Wyk poses as a representative of South Africa's Wildlife Ministry to get Burt to capture an Assblaster for him. He and his associates are actually poachers who want to sell the creatures for a profit.

    Literature 

-   Damon Kronski from the _Artemis Fowl_ series leads a faction called the Extinctionists, which aims to hunt as many endangered species as possible to extinction. They claim that their reason for doing this is to make humans re-channel the resources they spend on preserving endangered animals into improving the lot of their own species, but Artemis considers them a collective of bored, rich snobs who consider killing to be just another form of entertainment they can buy.
-   Gale Haley's _Birdsong_: Villain Jorinella takes advantage of the title character (an orphan girl who has the ability to speak to birds) to boost her bird-trapping operation, but once Birdsong frees all the birds she is finally defeated when the birds Zerg Rush her. We never see her actually kill anything, but she's a surprisingly dark character for a kids' picture book.
-   Roland Smith's eight-book _Cryptid Hunters_ continuity, consisting of the _Jacob Lansa_ trilogy, _Sasquatch_ and the _Cryptid Hunters_ quartet, regularly features poachers. During the first _Jacob Lansa_ book, Jacob witnesses another man who tries to get the poachers to change their ways by severing the tusks from elephants in a humane way that allows them to grow back and be harvested again at a later time (in real life this is impossible due to the way tusks grow), but the poachers prefer the old method of just killing the animals anyway.
-   The Stuart Gibbs _Fun Jungle_ novels feature several such characters, although it’s also subverted on one occasion when a character who appears to be one of these was merely hired by the park owner to chase away a wild mountain lion without harming it, and said hunter ends up saving the narrators life.
-   _InCryptid_:
    -   The villains of "Loch and Key" want to sell a Lake Monster to a carnival or _Ripley's Believe It or Not!_
    -   The villains of _The Measure of a Monster_ kidnap gorgon children for much the same reason.
-   _Into the Drowning Deep_: Jacques and Michi are married big game hunters who like hunting rare (therefore endangered and protected) animals since it's a thrill for them. Both have killed people who tried to stop it.
-   _Island (2000)_ by Gordon Korman - the poacher villains in the second and third books are pretty evil. They are ready to kill a starving, shipwrecked 14 year old who is willing to keep quiet until they realize he's worth a ton of money.
-   Although not blatantly evil, Quint from the novel _Jaws_ outraged his companions when he revealed he'd illegally killed a pregnant dolphin.
-   _Legend of the Animal Healer_ featured more than one of these as villains, ranging from outsiders who don't care about the preserve to sympathetic people just trying to feed their families.
-   _Malevil_ has Wahrwoorde. He forced this family to live in backwards squalor in a swamp, is cruel to his son and mother-in-law, raped his stepdaughters, and plots to murder the inhabitants of Malevil to steal the castle stronghold for himself.
-   _Meg Langslow Mysteries:_ The victim of _The Penguin Who Knew Too Much_ is a zoo owner suspected of illegally letting trophy hunters kill his (endangered) animals while their trapped in cages and don't have a chance to escape. Even the local hunters view this practice with utter contempt. In a twist, it turns out the victim was innocent and was killed when he caught the real poacher in the act of stealing one of his animals.
-   In the fifth Trixie Belden book, _Mystery Off Glen Road_, Trixie and Honey think there's a crazy, unicycle-riding poacher poaching the deer in Honey's father's game preserve.
-   Subverted in _Old Tin Sorrows_, in which a butchered fawn is discovered on the Stantnor estate and thought to be the handiwork of a poacher. Even a war-hardened veteran is dismayed that anyone would hunt such a young animal. It's actually a ruse staged by a serial murderer to lure some of the estate's staff onto a wild goose chase.
-   Elizabeth Honey's _Remote Man_ has Frank Laana, who poaches anything he can sell on the black market up to and including bear cubs, and has no qualms about killing animals he can't (the bears' mother).
-   _Rick Brant_: Cunner, a henchman from _Sea Gold,_ is locally despised for his illegal and unethical fishing methods.
-   In _The White Bone_, humans massacre entire families of elephants and saw off their tusks, preventing them from entering the afterlife.

-   _Badger_: "It's a Jungle Out There" involves a venison poaching ring and a birds' egg raider. The cases coincide when the 'egger' is poisoned by the poached venison, exposing the poaching ring.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ had a guy who hunted werewolves for their pelts. Werewolves are dangerous monsters indeed, but the fact that they're human most of the time (including if they die, meaning this hunter had to be skinning them _alive_) gave Buffy motivation to stop him.
-   _Daktari_: Probably the most common sort of bad guy.
-   _Dinosapien_: In "Trapped", a pair of poachers that are the Villain of the Week arrive in forest and illegally set up traps and try to capture Eno.
-   _Harrow_: In "Aegri Somnia" ("Hallucinations"), the Body of the Week is a local ranger, murdered when he uncovered a poaching ring run by his boss that is poaching rare aquatic species from the local waters and selling them to overseas collectors.
-   _Justified_ had alligator poaching as one of the major occupations of the Crowe family, a Bandit Clan of smugglers and hijackers with branches in both backwoods Kentucky and the Florida Everglades. Eldest brother and family patriarch Daryl Crowe Jr. initially went to jail for alligator poaching and came out a much more dangerous man for it, while his nephew Kendal, the youngest Crowe, notes that gator poaching is the first criminal act that his uncles forced him into. Cousin Dewey, whom we meet before the others, still wears a necklace of alligator teeth that have been in the family for years.
-   _Lost Tapes_ - Both the Hunter variety and the Animal Trafficker variety are featured. Both get a Karmic Death from the series featured Cryptids. Though for the later, the monster also kills one of the people breaking into the storage facility where illegally imported animals are kept.
-   _MacGyver (1985)_: Mac clashes with evil poachers in "Eagles", "The Endangered", and "Black Rhino". The last one actually takes the time to paint a more complex picture of the trade, recognizing that the economic factors involved make the poaching all but inevitable. Lampshaded after Mac and the local animal preserve owner stumble across a mutilated rhino that just had its horn removed before being left to die:
    
    **MacGyver**: That is the sickest, cruelest, most inhumane thing I've ever seen in my life. And for what? A few hundred dollars?
    
-   _Skippy the Bush Kangaroo_: Several episodes deal with people trying to illegally kill or capture park animals, including Skippy.

    Music 

-   Inverted with the traditional English folk song "The Lincolnshire Poacher".
-   And in "Longdog" by Show Of Hands, inspiring the band's Fan Community Nickname. A longdog is a variety of sighthound popular with hare- and rabbit-coursers, and the hero's ownership of one is used as circumstantial evidence to send him to jail.
    
    _Got a four-wheel pickup and a shotgun.  
    Never bought a meal in my life.  
    I go shopping with a lamp and a knife.  
    I got a longdog. I am a poacher._
    

    Theme Parks 

-   The "Kiliminjaro Safaris" ride at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom formerly had these as antagonists who are chased off after a pursuit. Early versions of the ride featured the poachers being captured by a cast member portraying a warden. Prior to opening, cast previews featured a Downer Ending where the poachers successfully slaughtered an elephant, whose corpse is seen by the riders; this was eliminated due to poor reactions from families and children.

    Video Games 

-   Many baddies in the first half of _Cadillacs and Dinosaurs_ are this, most prominently the Butcher.
-   Stella the Turtle Poacher, the Evil Counterpart to Turtle Tamer characters in _Kingdom of Loathing_.
    -   And because _Kingdom of Loathing_ never misses a chance at a bad pun, she also poaches turtles. In case she wasn't evil enough for you.
-   The bad guys of the Beat 'em Up arcade game _Growl_ are the ironically-named Rendow Animal Protection Organization (RAPO), and they are led by a giant alien millipede who wants to use the animals as food for its species.
-   Grok in _Heroes of Might and Magic V_, a minor demon lord and favored minion of Kha-Beleth the Demon Sovereign. When he isn't leading his master's armies into battle, his main duty is scouting Ashan in search or rare, exotic and/or magnificent beasts to capture alive, transport to Sheogh, and slaughter for his master's amusement.
-   In _Hogwarts Legacy_ poachers make up one of two hostile human subfactions players have to tangle with. They're cruel, ruthless, well-organized, and absolutely everywhere. The upshot is that they provide plenty of deserving targets to practice your Unforgivable Curses on.
-   _Jade Cocoon_: The Poacher, who you can fight three times. Thankfully, even though he demands you hand over your Mons if you lose, he doesn't actually steal them if you do.
-   Maxim Slaughter, the villain in _EcoQuest 2_. His room is full of various endangered animal trophies.
-   _Light Fairytale_: In Episode 1, a soldier attempts to capture a tallcat in order to cut off their tail and sell it. The fact that there's a market for tallcat tails and that tallcats are almost extinct implies he's not the only one doing this.
-   _MapleStory_ has monsters called Evil Poachers in one of the Grand Athenaeum scenarios, who hunt and capture fairies to sell them. Along with grave robbers who also plague the fey lands, these villains are one of the reasons Ephenia hates humans and later decides to ally herself with the Black Mage.
-   _Uncharted: The Lost Legacy_: While the game's plot puts more emphasis on Big Bad warlord Asav's plundering of Indian antiquities to fund his bloody insurrection, his headquarters at the start of the game has storage crates full of tiger pelts and elephant tusks as well, suggesting that Asav also dabbles in poaching and ivory dealing to support his warmongering.
-   _World of Warcraft_: Hemet Nesingwary thinks of himself as more of a Great White Hunter, but his followers in _Wrath of the Lich King_ are hilariously over the top Evil Poachers.

    Webcomics 

-   _Dominic Deegan_: The tour guides of the Wild Edge become poachers when the tourists and researchers leave in the off-season.

    Western Animation 

-   _Captain Planet_ villains sometimes fall into this:
    -   Looten Plunder is an Evil Poacher who is also an Evil Capitalist. Sometimes he engages in poaching for profit, sometimes for entertainment, both cases having some truth in reality.
    -   Later, the Planeteers and Captain Planet deal with an Egomaniac Hunter/Evil Poacher family known as the Slaughters, led by Mame Slaughter and Stalker Slaughter. The Slaughters even team up with Looten Plunder in one episode.
    -   Hoggish Greedly is also an evil poacher, to a lesser extent, because he seeks out endangered and rare animals as much as he does common ones.
-   _The Deep_: Sebastian Conger, the multimillionaire collector of rare species, who will stoop to any level to acquire species for his collection.
-   Regis Stone for _Dex Hamilton: Alien Entomologist_. He is an Egomaniac Hunter who will wipe out the last of the species for the thrill being the one to do so, and doesn't care what laws he breaks in the process.
-   _Dragons: The Nine Realms_: Big Bad Buzzsaw hunts and traps dragons as he has come to believe himself to be the rightful king of the Hidden World.
-   _Dragons: Riders of Berk_: By the time _Race to the Edge_ begins, Hiccup and company begin encountering dragon hunters who know dragons as well as they do, have equipment capable of neutralizing dragon abilities with ease, and see them as a threat to their business. The rest of the series is a war against the increasing threat level of the hunters, who make it clear that they'd make dragons go extinct just for the gold it would bring them.
-   Gnawgahyde, one of the Dreadnoks from _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero_. The fact that other poachers couldn't stand Gnawgahyde and chased him out of Africa is some indication of just how detestable this Dreadnok can be. He is a belligerent hunter who is convinced that all animals are lesser life-forms suitable for skinning, eating, or stuffing.
-   In _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2021)_, R'Qazz is a beastopoid who hunts the sapient tigers of the jungle among any other animals that catch his eyes to either make them his Battle Trophys or to force them to fight in Beastly Bloodsports. After his initial defeat against the Masters of the Universe, he is recruited to Skeletor's side to become his personal hunter, Beast Man.

    -   Another episode had the family going on a trip to Africa and meeting a Jane Goodall Expy. She convinces them to help her defend her chimpanzee sanctuary from a group of Evil Poachers.
