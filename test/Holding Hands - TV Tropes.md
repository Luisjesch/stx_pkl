_"Oh yeah, I'll tell you something,  
I think you'll understand  
When I say that something:  
I wanna hold your hand!"_

Holding hands is one of the most basic, platonic, and visible ways to express affection, friendship, or love.

Because holding hands can be platonic, it can be shown in any work, between any people. If someone offers a hand to hold, and the person it was offered to rejects it, odds are something is wrong with at least one of them. Sometimes one tries to hold the other's hand, and the other whips their hand away with The Look.

When holding hands is shown between people who can reasonably be eventually romantically linked, it is often either symbolic of the link or a prelude to it, depending on the rating of the work. Even if it isn't, it likely will be in the Fan Fic due to shipping. Romantic hand-holding may be accompanied by giggling from one or both of the people.

Holding hands can be a gesture of solidarity. When a group of people join hands in a circle, that can mean friendship, dancing, or (in some works) a magic ritual.

It's also distinctly Truth in Television, especially the romantic version.

Because holding hands is very platonic, it is often as far as romantic partners are allowed to go in works aimed at children and young teenagers, especially in Anime. Fans have noted this and taken handholding as a substitute for more "adult" actions, jokingly calling it "Lewd Hand Holding".

Compare/contrast Take My Hand! and I Kiss Your Hand. Intertwined Fingers and Accidental Hand-Hold are a subtropes.

-   _The Sandman (1989)_: In one issue, British schoolboy Charles Rowland dies after suffering terrible abuse at the hands of ghostly bullies. As he dies, he is accompanied by the ghost of one of their previous victims, Edwin Paine. Early on, Rowland asks Paine to hold his hand.

-   This trope is prominent in _Wall E_. One of the more iconic bits is WALL•E holding his own hand out of loneliness. Notably, while WALL•E's First Kiss with EVE comes about halfway through the film, hand holding (indicating their completed Relationship Upgrade) doesn't happen until the finale.
-   The scene in _Tarzan_ where Tarzan and Jane press their palms up towards each other. The significance behind it is that earlier, when Tarzan was a child, his hands didn't match up with his gorilla mother's, meaning that they were different. However, when his hand and Jane's hand match up perfectly, he knew that he was one of her kind.
-   _Toy Story 3_: In the climactic scene, the toys are trapped in the incinerator and facing certain death. Instead of panicking, they join hands and choose to meet their fate together.
-   In Shane Acker's feature film version of _9_, this happens frequently— often in subtle ways, such as 2 closing his hand around or over 5's or 5 laying his hand over 6's during 2's funeral, but it's most notable for being the main way that 9 and 7 display their affection for each other. Before he goes to try and sacrifice himself to the machine, 7 catches his arm and pleads with him not to do it; he takes her hand in both of his and explains to her that he has to, and then briefly catches her hand and holds it proper for a moment. She actually looks at their hands and then at him, and then he dashes off. 6 can also be seen leading 8 by the hand in the final scene of the movie.

-   _The Blind Side_: The Tuohy children offer their hands to Michael when saying Grace at Thanksgiving dinner.

She responds by placing her own hand in his and saying, "Not empty now."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Man of Steel_:
    -   In a platonic example, Perry holds Jenny's hand while she's trapped under rubble when the Kryptonian World Engine is destroying Metropolis.

    -   _Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi_: During Rey and Kylo Ren's fourth Force Bond session, Rey reaches out her hand. Kylo reciprocates. They touch hands despite being light years away from each other, and it is probably the most intimate moment of both their lives so far. Rey, at least, even has a vision of the future and Kylo seems to see the truth of her parents. This might be among the most _epic_ hand holding scenes in all fiction.

-   _Spice and Wolf_: Holo offers Lawrence her hand to hold, but he gets distracted by his trading endeavors and fails to notice. He catches on the third time.

    Video Games 

-   In _Cyberpunk 2077_, there's the scene of V giving up their body after "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" (assumedly if you have a high enough relationship with Johnny). Johnny tries to stop them from crossing the bridge multiple times, before he eventually admits that he's scared for V while displaying some very anxious body language. V then offers a handshake goodbye, which Johnny reluctantly accepts. But when V tries to pull away, Johnny refuses to let go at first, holding their hand closer to him as he looks them in the eyes, before finally releasing it with an absolutely heartbreaking expression on his face. See it here for yourself.
-   _Dark Tales_: C. Auguste Dupin and the player character do this at the end of _Morella_, the twelfth installment of the games. Dupin's beaming smile as he extends his hand to her makes it the biggest moment of Ship Tease in the entire series.
-   _Detectives United_ has an unusual variant, done to transfer player control from one of the detectives to another; the character who is about to be controlled extends their hand, the currently controlled character takes it as if shaking hands, and the scene spins to switch the point of view. (Humorously, there is no in-universe explanation offered for the gesture, making it appear like a random decision to shake hands in the middle of a crisis.)
-   _Dragon Quest XI_: Booga in _S_ is revealed to be _comically_ chaste; despite his lecherous nature, he considers the act of holding hands to be the equivalent of becoming intimate. He didn't start holding hands with his girlfriend until their tenth anniversary of being together, and when he captures Jade, he starts giggling with the thought that, one day, he'll finally be able to hold hands with her.
-   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_: This is a recurring theme in Dimitri's relationship with Byleth (whether platonic or romantic) as there is a lot of focus on them Holding Hands.

After killing Edelgard, Dimitri almost looks back but is stopped when Byleth takes his hand. And in their S-Support, the CG shows them holding hands while Dimitri professes his love. This is taken further if Dimitri is chosen to meet with Byleth in the Goddess Tower. He'll admit that if the Goddess does exist either she wouldn't offer a hand to the people, or the people lack the ability to take it. This carries a bit of weight for the above examples since Byleth essentially _becomes_ the Goddess.
-   _ICO_ is built around this as a central game mechanic. Ico has to hold Yorda's hand in order for her to follow him around and thankfully the designers made her smart and endearing enough to not grate too heavily on the player's nerves.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven_ proves that even villains are not immune to this. If DIO initiates a Dual Heat Attack with Father Pucci, DIO refers to him as "friend", and they clasp each others' hand.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
    -   _Kingdom Hearts II_:
        -   The opening has a brief shot of Sora holding hands with both Kairi _and_ Riku as they lay on the beach together.

    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks_: After beating the final boss, Link and Zelda hold hands as they watch the Lokomos depart. Particularly notable because for the majority of the game, Zelda was a ghost and thus, likely wouldn't have been able to touch like a living person would.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_: Link and Zelda hold hands after Zelda emerges from her crystal prison following Demise's destruction.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: Link holds Zelda's hand as they run from Calamity Ganon's destructive attack on Hyrule Castle.
-   _The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince_ has this as a major game mechanic due to it being an Escort Game. Since the prince is blind, the princess has to hold his hand to guide him past most obstacles.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  As a nice little touch, both characters smile whenever their hands are held.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   _Mass Effect 2_: Commander Shepard takes and holds his/her various Love Interests' hands during the Romance Sidequest. This is particularly noteworthy in cases such as Tali where, due to her Bizarre Alien Biology, that's all they can do without careful preparation due to serious health risks.
    -   _Mass Effect: Andromeda_: Vetra and Ryder do this in a good number of their romance scenes, most prominently during their confession where it's very much focused on.
-   _Persona 3 Portable_ has this in Ken Amada's (lovers) Social Link. When he "trips" on the way back to the dorm, the female protagonist takes ahold of his hand. He holds on for awhile before pushing her away and running off. When you bring it up the next date, he states he felt as though he used the fact that he was a kid to "trick" her into holding his hand. On the male side of things, the MC does this with Aigis a few times in the original and FES version.
-   _Pokémon_: There is a move called Hold Hands. It normally doesn't do anything in battle except look cute, although in Contests it boots the appeal of moves such as Circle Throw, Seismic Toss, Sky Drop, Smack Down, Storm Throw and Vital Throw. Z-Hold Hands also gives a broad boost to the users' stats.
-   _Prince of Persia (2008)_: The Prince and Elika often grab each other's hands for practical purposes, since they're acrobatically traversing dangerous obstacles together. However, if you want them to swap positions on a thin ledge, they grab both of each other's hands and swing around, which looks adorably close to dancing.
-   _The Sims 2_ and _The Sims 3_ have "Hold Hands" as a low-level romantic interaction.
-   _Sky: Children of the Light_: When befriending another Skykid, you can choose to hold hands with them. Tapping the "Hold Hands" icon above their head will allow them to lead you, giving them the "Hold Hands" prompt from the friendship menu allows you to lead them. When you haven't found all Spirits in an area yet, you can also request a guide from the expressions menu, allowing any nearby Skykids to take your hand and lead you to any undiscovered Spirits. You can hold hands with two people at a time, and if they in turn hold hands with _their_ friends, you can form a chain of up to eight Skykids (eight being the maximum amount of players per server).
-   _Solatorobo_: Red and Elh are told to do this during Merveille's "special" training simulation, which was just her way of getting Red to finally admit his feelings. It eventually leads to a "You two can let go of each other now."
-   _Tokimeki Memorial_:
    -   _Tokimeki Memorial 2_: This is the base of two Events in Hikari Hinomoto's storyline. During her childhood days, she and the protagonist do this so they don't lose each other while running; as a call-back to this event, they do the same in their High School time, during a date at the crowded Shopping Mall. Also, the protagonist and Kaedeko Sakura do this in the last shot of her Happy Ending.
    -   _Tokimeki Memorial 4_: This is a gameplay element. You are required to hold a girl's hand after a date to confirm your romantic status with her.
    -   _Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side_: The "skinship" function can be used for this purpose. The guys generally won't go along with hand-holding until their affection for the heroine has developed enough.
-   _World of Warcraft_ uses this a lot, both between platonic friends and between identified lovers: much to the consternation of shippers. Child NPCs also frequently reach for the player's hand, and some adult NPCs will do this as well. Unfortunately, the gesture can't actually be animated in game due to tech limitations. Some cutscenes do have characters joining hands though. It is never used during a magical ritual however, since there are a completely different set of casting animations.

    Visual Novels 

-   In the _CLANNAD_ visual novel, the perpetually insecure Nagisa at one point is worried that Tomoya doesn't like her as much as he says he does. He proposes a game: holding hands, where the first person to let go loses. In the end, her father pulls them apart because they're about to start a baseball game.
    
    **Tomoya:** It's a draw.
    
-   _Little Busters!_: Holding hands - or specifically, holding your hand out to someone to help them or taking someone's hand to lead them somewhere - is a major theme of _Little Busters_, to the point that it's featured on the title screen. It happens most often between Riki and Kyousuke (and yes, the Ho Yay is just as strong as you'd think) because arguably the main plot of the game is the way Riki learns to stand on his own and not just let Kyousuke lead him around everywhere, but because of this Riki ends up holding hands with most of the heroines in their routes. In particular, one of the most dramatic moments at the end of the game occurs when Riki takes Rin's hand to lead her to safety.
-   In _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_'s school mode ending with her, Naegi does this with Kirigiri, narrating that he hopes she can someday trust him enough to reveal what hides beneath her Conspicuous Gloves. Since school mode is only unlocked after beating the game, the player should already know.
-   _Minotaur Hotel_: If you treat Asterion well, you engage in a bunch of moments where you hold Asterion's hand, each of them varying in affection and intimacy.

    Web Animation 

-   _Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse_ begins its first short with Barbie preparing for a date with Ken honoring the 43rd anniversary of when they first held hands.
-   _Happy Tree Friends_: In "I Nub You", Petunia loses her hands and falls in love with the handless beaver, Handy. One scene shows the Official Couple, Cuddles and Giggles, holding hands...then switches to Handy and Petunia, who have tied together the bandages on their stumps.
-   In the ending of _Kaizo Trap_, the heroine has to lead her boyfriend through game world by hand, because of his injuries.
-   _RWBY_: After Ruby's group learns what Ozpin's been hiding and why he's been lying, even Qrow turns on him, resulting in him retreating so far from them that even Oscar can't reach him. As Ruby returns Ozpin's cane to a dejected Oscar, he rhetorically asks if he's going to be just another one of Oz's lives. She folds her hands over his and the hilt of the cane, and tries to reassure him that he's his own person. The trope is subverted by Qrow interrupting to bitterly instruct Ruby not to lie to Oscar because they're better than that; Oscar therefore walks away completely unreassured.
    -   Blake holds Weiss's hand in solidarity when Jacques confronts her in "Pomp and Circumstance". As noted in the behind the scenes commentary, this is because Blake knows what it's like to be an abusive relationship, unlike Ruby or Yang.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   This is usually the most romantic thing that happens between Egg and Kube in _AJCO_, partially because they're both too shy to take it any further and partially because Kube's hands are one of the few parts of them that aren't covered in spines.

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers_: "Queen's Gun" has the Rangers escaping from certain death only to find their shuttle has maybe ten minutes of oxygen left. Niko's reaction is to reach over and take Shane's hand.
-   _Arthur_: In "I Wanna Hold Your Hand", Binky is embarrassed after he incorrectly believes that George spotted him holding his mother's hand. When the Tough Customers realize that he has a secret, they try to figure out what it is, and eventually incorrectly decide that it must have something to do with his upcoming clarinet solo. "Maybe he's playing something really romantic, like Debussy." When they find out what the secret actually is, they chew him out for the secret not being something juicy, and one of them even admits that he sometimes holds his mother's hand.
-   _Ben 10: Ultimate Alien_: In "Where the Magic Happens", Gwen and Charmcaster do this to combine their power. This also sparked a lot of Les Yay subtext.
-   _Chowder_: Panini agrees to do a favor for Mung in exchange for getting to hold hands with Chowder.
-   _Code Lyoko_ features several instances of romantic hand holding between Aelita and Jérémie, and the Season Two finale has a particularly strong example of hands linked in a Circle of Friendship. Another example is that the four have to join hands to use the Mental Fusion tactic.
-   _The Dragon Prince_: Callum and Rayla hold hands in "Sol Regem" to stand firm and deny one leaving without the other, despite the human-hating dragon's refusal to let Callum cross the Xadian border (or even turn back) without paying with his life. Callum and Rayla tend to hold hands more frequently in the latter half of the season, although that's becuase they're more than just friends by then.
-   _Gravity Falls_: Dipper takes the hands of both Wendy and Soos as the three walk into the supernatural prisoner where Bill has trapped Mabel.

    -   In Episode 231, Kaeloo and Mr. Cat witness a bunch of happy couples together, and Kaeloo says "love is beautiful" before holding Mr. Cat's hand, showing that their relationship is leaning more towards romance than plain friendship at this point in the series.
-   _Kick Buttowski_: Played with in the conveniently named episode "Hand in Hand" where Kick and Kendall accidentally get their hands stuck together due to a very sticky cave sap when Kick offers his hand to help her stand up... of course they spend the rest of the episode fearing people will assume they're boyfriend and girlfriend because of this since Gunther immediately does and runs away screaming several times.
-   _The Legend of Korra_: The Grand Finale, "The Last Stand", ends with Korra and Asami holding hands and longingly looking at each other as they go through the spirit portal. Word of Gay confirms that this means just what you think it does.
-   _The Owl House_:
    -   Important moments in Luz and Amity's Romance Arc were often marked by one of them Offering a Hand. Once they actually start dating, this naturally becomes a common sight (so much so that the show completely stops drawing attention to it), both when they're just being affectionate or when one is trying to comfort the other.
    -   While there has been plenty of Ship Teasing going on between Hunter and Willow, in "For the Future" they finally start acknowledging their mutual romantic attraction, punctuated by them locking their pinkie fingers together.
-   _Ready Jet Go!_:

-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_: At the end of "Enter the Dragons, Part 2", Karai takes Dr. Chaplin's hand on her own — a hint that she's now ready to reciprocate his feelings for her. When we next see them in the series finale, they're a couple.
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_: Some episodes, as well as the ending part of the movie _Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo_, show Robin and Starfire holding hands.
-   _Transformers: Prime_: In "Scrapheap", a platonic version occurs between Optimus and Arcee who try to reassure each other as they were about to freeze to death in the Arctic.
-   _Voltron: Legendary Defender_: Quite a few.
    -   In season one, Keith grabs an injured Lance's hand to support him in season one after an intensive fight, and they hold hands throughout the scene that comes afterwards, with Lance telling him "We make a good team" as they tiredly smile at each other. Throughout the season, there's a few other hand holds between them, with most of them involving Keith saving Lance from a precarious situation.
    -   Hunk and Pidge grab each other's hands near the end of season 1 so as not to get separated when the anti-gravity fails, with Hunk shocked about Pidge being asked to get kicked across the room after, stating, "No, we're friends."
    -   Keith and Allura hold hands when stuck in a similar yet way more precarious situation out in space in season 2.
    -   The entire team wind up having to hold hands to survive for an unspecified amount of time — possibly days — during an episode at the beginning of season 7, spiraling into unspoken grudges and feelings finally being laid out.

    Real Life 

-   A British soldier was critically wounded during the Battle of El Alamein and while lying in the hospital, he found himself next to an also critically injured German prisoner. He reached over and squeezed the German soldier's hand who also squeezed back. Sometime later, the British soldier lost consciousness and when he woke up the next morning, the German soldier was gone. When he asked what happened to the man beside him, the doctor simply replied "He died during the night. You were still holding hands."
-   In countries where public displays of affection are frowned upon, this is usually a surefire way to identify a couple.
    -   It is also a surefire means of identifying if someone is romantically interested in someone else, for obvious reasons.
    -   It also causes some Values Dissonance, such as when President George W. Bush held the hand of Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah. Where in Western cultures holding hands and kissing on the lips means romantic interest, this was not the case in the meeting with the Saudi Prince.
-   In Mexico, couples that are not too intimate will often be jokingly referred to as _"de manitas mojadas,"_ which means "of wet hands." The joke being that they are so shy with one another, that the couple won't go beyond holding their moist (sweaty) hands.
-   Adults often hold the hands of children in public so they won't wander off or get into trouble. Sometimes they train their children to hold their finger.
-   Young schoolgirls in some countries routinely hold their best friends' hands.
-   This trope is Played for Laughs on adult websites and forums like 4chan's /d/ or /trash/ boards, where pictures like hand-holding are jokingly referred to as being "sick" and "disgusting" fetishes (the humor comes from the fact that these boards host pornography of... "different"... tastes).
-   Sea otters often hold hands when they're sleeping, to avoid drifting apart due to the ocean current.
-   Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been noted to frequently do this, particularly throughout their wedding.
