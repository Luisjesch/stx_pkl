Shhh. Don't blow his cover!

**Sevarius:** I was particularly proud of my death scene.  
**Xanatos:** Frankly, Sevarius, I thought you overplayed the part.

A character's death is faked, for one or more of the following purposes:

-   To throw their enemies off the trail.
-   To allow said character to be taken into Witness Relocation.
-   To make a criminal commit Just One Little Mistake.
-   To allow two characters to live Happily Ever After.
-   As part of a con.
-   To gain a temporary advantage in combat — generally considered less than sporting unless it's done to fake out your teammates and throw them into an Unstoppable Rage... then it's heroic.
-   To prevent a Time Paradox.
-   To see how his heirs would react.
-   To retire or get an "out".
-   To make someone quit trying to actually kill them.
-   To get out of a bad relationship.
-   To get out of an organization where resignations are not accepted.
-   To protect their loved ones.
-   To frame someone for the murder of the person whose death was faked.
-   To live on as someone else.

Often the audience will think the character is genuinely dead. Extra points if a fake crime scene photo or Staged Shooting is used. Sometimes a John Doe's remains are substituted and destroyed beyond recognition, or everyone is simply told "They Never Found the Body." The person faking his death might attend his own funeral. Of course, when this happens to main characters in a series, the audience should not be fooled.

When the method of faking temporarily turns the character into a realistic-seeming corpse, this is Faux Death, and will likely result in a Mistaken Death Confirmation.

Death Faked for You, Playing Possum, Disney Death, and Fake Kill Scare are subtropes. The inverse is Of Corpse He's Alive (a "live" person is actually dead) and El Cid Ploy (a faction pretending their leader is alive).

A play on the common turn of phrase "waking the dead". Contrast He's Just Hiding. Not to be confused with Fake Weakness. See also Reports of My Death Were Greatly Exaggerated.

For what (usually) happens next, see Starting a New Life.

Remember that faking the dead may seem fun, but it is a criminal act in most countries and may cause legal trouble. Don't Try This at Home.

        -   This wasn't the first time; he had once recruited the death-obsessed Mortimer Kadaver to hypnotize him into a death-like trance, using his apparent demise as part of an elaborate charity fraud scheme.
    -   Part of the origin of the villain Film Freak; he was a struggling actor who faked his own broad daylight murder in a scene inspired by _The Sting_, hoping to use the publicity to revive his career when he miraculously returned.

He laid low for three years before re-emerging and going on a movie-themed crime spree.
-   _The Flash_ has a field day with this with the infamous _Heroes in Crisis_. Within the series itself, there's Booster Gold's idea of cloning a dead body of Wally West to fulfill a Stable Time Loop involving the Trinity seeing Wally's corpse. As part of _The Flash (Infinite Frontier)_'s _many_ attempts at undoing the damage done by _HiC_ (with the first order of business being revealing that the Sanctuary massacre wasn't Wally's fault, by Savitar's attempts to take control of the Speed Force after Reverse Flash put him there and the Speed Force trying to kick him out) was revealing that Gold Beetle did what Booster, Blue Beetle, Batgirl, and Harley _should've_ done, and did it to most everyone else too (barring Wally, who was already taken care of; Roy, who came during the events of _DC Infinite Frontier_ itself back, anyway; and Poison Ivy, who came back during _HiC_ itself).

When _DC Rebirth_ restored the DCU to how it was prior to the New 52, Arani faking her death was one of the few elements of the New 52 canon that was retained, as _Doomsday Clock_ shows her leading a new superhero team in India known as The Doomed.

Marvel

-   _Daredevil_:
    -   Matt once faked his death after it seemed that someone knew his secret identity. He ended up using the dead body of his Evil Knockoff Hellspawn, created during _The Infinity War_ and was altered by a mutagenic virus.
    -   Even earlier, Matt faked the death of Mike, an identity he created (and played), as part of a Fake Twin Gambit to throw Foggy and Karen off the trail of him being Daredevil, to end the gambit, claiming "Mike" fell in battle and had trained a new Daredevil. Then Charles Soule and Chip Zdarsky decided to have some Cosmic Retcons that made Mike a real, separate, and still-living person.
        -   This culminates over in _Devil's Reign_ when Kingpin, having regained his knowledge of Daredevil's identity, mistakes Mike for Matt and kills him in cold blood. Matt decides to use this to join Elektra in taking out the Hand.
-   _Fantastic Four:_ In their first appearance, Alicia recognizes the Enclave as a group of famous scientists, who'd all supposedly died. Their leader admits they faked their death so they could commit mad science without being bothered.
-   In _Fear Itself_, Bucky Barnes, the current Captain America had apparently been killed off while fighting Sin, the Red Skull's daughter. However, as revealed in a post-series epilogue, Bucky did survive the brutal attack and his death was faked by both Black Widow and Nick Fury in order to convince Steve Rogers to become Captain America once more, as well as to allow Bucky to deal with remaining Winter Soldier-esque sleeper agents without any trouble. How? A well-placed Life Model Decoy and the Infinity Formula did the trick.
-   At the end of _The Infinity Gauntlet_ Thanos does this when everyone believes that he died due to a thermonuclear bomb on his belt. He used the opportunity to... become a farmer.
-   Iron Man once faked his death when he was suffering from nerve disintegration. It was a ploy to get healed. Unfortunately, Rhodey didn't know about it and was pissed off.
    -   The script was then flipped years later during Matt Fraction's run. The Mandarin's machinations had made it virtually impossible for Tony to be Iron Man without government interference, so Rhodey faked his own death as War Machine so that he could take over as the new Iron Man. Once the whole situation was sorted out, Rhodey went back to the War Machine armor.
-   _Kid Colt (2009)_: The series ends with the heroes faking Kid Colt's death (using the corpse of Bounty Hunter Sherman Wilks, the story's main antagonist) and claiming the bounty. Dirty Cop Sheriff McGreeley, the Big Bad who employed Wilks to hunt Kid Colt, will presumably work it out eventually - but, at least for a little while, the authorities think Colt is dead.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    
    -   This seems to be the MO of the Hobgoblin, Roderick Kingsley - set up some poor schmuck as the Hobgoblin and let him run around as him for a while; if he dies, no skin off Roderick's back.
    -   Before his real death in _Guardian Devil_, faking it was something of a favorite tactic of Mysterio's.
    
    **Mook:** D'ya think he's...?  
    **Spider-Man:** Please. He's Mysterio. He's probably halfway to Hoboken by now.
    
    -   Carnage can do this as well, slipping a piece of the symbiote over a dead body to make someone think that he's dead, just so he can slip away or get in and gut someone. Of course, it doesn't work all the time, as it didn't fool Batman when he did it then. Of course, he was aiming for The Joker.
    -   Spider-Man himself pulled this stunt on Venom. Trapped on a deserted island, with no way to beat Venom, Spidey used his costume and a dead body to allow Venom to think that the body was his and leave him to enjoy his time there. When Carnage makes his first appearance, Spidey is forced to reveal the ruse.
    -   In a version of a planned ending for _The Clone Saga_ that was ultimately used for the 2009 Alternate Continuity miniseries, its versions of _Spectacular Spider-Man_ #200 was revealed to be this, Harry Osborn faking his own death so he could prepare for his plans as the Big Bad.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Professor Xavier faked his death so as to counter an alien invasion. An already dying shape-shifter named Changeling replaced him as atonement. Only Jean, of all his students, knew the truth.
    -   In _X-Men Noir_, Jean Grey fakes her death by killing Anne-Marie Rankin, cutting off/out any distinguishing facial features, and dyeing her hair. She then assumes her identity by dyeing her own hair. Why? She wanted out of the X-Men, essentially - and to collect her trust fund, of course.
    -   In _God Loves, Man Kills_, Purifiers make it look as if they've killed the Professor, Scott, and Ororo in an explosion when they have actually taken the three prisoners. Only Wolverine's enhanced senses reveal the deception. Later, when ordered to kill Storm and Cyclops after he was brainwashed, Professor X apparently obeys, though it turns out he just put them in a state that made them look dead (Magneto says it was on an unconscious level, as he couldn't do it despite this).
    -   In _The Fall of the Mutants_, an interesting variant happens here. In order to stop The Adversary, Forge is forced to kill the X-Men to seal it away. However, the sorceress Roma, impressed with their act, revives the team. After pondering it over, the team opts to let the world believe they were still dead, using the aid of a spell that hides them from electronics while they fight the good fight. Needless to say, their allies weren't terribly impressed when they found out.
-   _Star Wars: Darth Vader_. A bounty hunter brings Darth Vader a charred corpse which he's told is Dr Aphra, but Vader is not fooled for a second and kills him. Aphra later says that Vader will never stop hunting her because she knows too much about him, but the only way to convince Vader that she's dead is if he personally executes her. So she lets Vader throw her out an airlock into space, which she told him before is the one thing she was really scared of, and has her colleagues hidden nearby in a spacecraft to rescue her. When it's pointed out that Vader could have simply killed her with a lightsaber, Aphra replies that Vader was always going to go for the worst option.

    -   Ginko as well pulled it off accidentally once, as he had crashed his car and it seemed he had been killed. He and the Minister of Justice then proceeded to take advantage of his apparent death by having the Minister's nephew apparently replace him to have Diabolik lower his guard and ambush him (Diabolik got away in spite of thinking Ginko was dead because he didn't know how good the replacement was and acted as if Ginko was still alive, allowing him to spot the ambush at the last moment).

-   Jhariah's _A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO FAKING YOUR DEATH_ follows a man who executes an impromptu plan to fake his death. After he does so, he leaves towns and starts a new life, which he enjoys more. It eventually dawns on him that his past is catching up to him, he doesn't feel safe, and he worries about what sort of revenge people would seek if they found out. He accepts that his plan has gone downhill and kills himself because he can't live with himself, wanting to just disappear from everyone's memory altogether.

    Music Videos 

-   The stinger of Tom Petty's "Mary Jane's Last Dance". The supposedly dead lady he'd carried back from the morgue and romanced throughout the video suddenly _opens her eyes_ after he leaves her in the water.
-   The music video for Rammstein's "Haifisch" takes place at singer Till Lindemann's funeral. It's only after the other band members start fighting each other and Flake crashes into the coffin that they find out the coffin's empty. Cut to Till mailing a postcard from Hawaii that says 'greetings from the arse of the world!'

    Podcasts 

-   _The Adventure Zone: Balance_: in _Murder on the Rockport Limited_, Jenkins, does this, specifically by killing the Engineer and switching clothes with him.
    -   In _The Crystal Kingdom_, the Tres Horny Boys help Lucas Miller do this so that the Bureau doesn't lock him up.
    -   In _Reunion Tour_, Taako and Merle pretend that Magnus is dead, when in fact he's a mannequin.
-   In _The Hidden Almanac_, this may have been the case with the pirate Ribbon Jack, who "was never allowed to make a public statement and was hanged while wearing a hood. Autopsies indicated that the notorious pirate may actually have been an eighty-five pound bag of seaweed." On the other hand, it has to be said that an animate bag of seaweed with piratical proclivities would fit right in with some of the other historical figures mentioned in the series.
-   "Vanish," an episode of the podcast _Criminal_, discusses the many difficulties of doing this in real life. As it turns out, a lot of people fail at this because they just don't disappear fully enough - they leave too many clues online or elsewhere that they're still alive. Some of them even blow their own covers by directly contacting family or friends. It's _hard_ to give up absolutely everything and everyone in your life.

    Print Media 

-   Martin Gardner (renowned recreational mathematician — yes, it's a real job) did this to the character Dr. Matrix in his column in _Scientific American_. Dr. Matrix, an agent for the CIA, was disguised as an Arab named Abdul Abulbul Amir in order to assassinate a KGB agent named Ivan Skavinsky Skavar. They dueled on the shores of the Black Sea, and fired simultaneously; Ivan died instantly, but "Abdul" was only knocked out, and the CIA paid two natives to confirm his death.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   According to a 2010 interview with Paul Bearer, in preparation for one such memorable _Funeral Parlor_ segment, Paul and The Undertaker and the others had to remove the airtight rubber seal from the lid of the casket they had bought and decorated and drill holes in said lid to allow breathable space inside, so in that manner the Ultimate Warrior would not suffocate when they locked him in the casket. Which explains that once inside, Warrior would tear up the coffin for show before closing his eyes and calmly relaxing in order to create the apparition of a Disney Death when the casket was unlocked and opened. Warrior must have been very good in convincing his rescuers and everyone involved that he was Only Mostly Dead, giving them quite a scare (before the administration of CPR, of course).
-   Also happened in _WrestleMania XV_ when The Undertaker summoned the Brood to throw down the long harness cord/noose in his effort to string up the Big Boss Man after winning the Streak; if one looked carefully and closely, they could see Boss Man trembling in fear as the "noose" was put around his neck. Taker, knowing that he would never strangle his opponent during the hanging procedure, gave him a quick reassuring look as if to say, "It's okay. Trust me"; and it was when Taker attached the cord to the safety harness Boss Man was wearing underneath his suit, that the latter realized that he would be okay and decided to play along with the (kayfabe) hanging procedure. When Paul Bearer pressed the button to lift up both the cage and Boss Man by the harness, the latter made a good impression of a hanging/strangulation victim, giving everyone quite a scare. When the procedure was done, only the live audience could watch him get safely taken down onto a stretcher so that he could get to a hospital just fine with minor injuries.

    Radio 

-   _Adventures in Odyssey_:
    -   In the Novacom arc, Connie's friend Robert Mitchel who is secretly trying to stop the bad guys from taking over the world, fakes his death to make sure the bad guys won't actually try to kill him like they did to another person who found out their plans.
    -   Pulled with appropriate magnificence by Dr. Blackgaard in the episode "A Name, Not a Number". The scene where he reveals himself to his unwitting accomplice is priceless.
        
        **Blackgaard:** Actually, once I got out of the morgue, I'd never felt better in my life...
        

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Massacards_, The Actor can pretend to be dead as a Dark Ability, even going as far as to reveal all their cards. However, they die for real if another player uses an ability that kills them.
-   A major element of many plots in _Spycraft_, for obvious reasons.
    -   In the same system, the "Zeroed" feat is essentially this, making the trail of clues to break your cover identity significantly longer.
-   In _Sentinels of the Multiverse_, long-time villain Baron Blade teams up with the heroes to battle the universe-destroying OblivAeon, and is apparently killed in the fight. The 'incapacitated' side of his Collector's Edition hero card features his funeral, with preeminent hero Legacy delivering a eulogy...while a shadowy figure overlooks the scene from the background; the "Incapacitated" side of the regular edition confirms that said figure is Baron Blade. Sure enough, Blade returns as a villain in both main future timelines.
-   In _Shadowrun_, the Expanded Universe book "Night's Pawn" saw the Great Dragon Alamais seemingly killed by an orbital laser. Later sourcebooks would reveal he was alive but hiding (obviously not wanting to come back until whoever shot him couldn't repeat the process), but his attempt to do so was foiled in 2057 when fellow Great Dragon Dunkelzahn was Killed Off for Real and spent a section of his (extensive) will giving Alamais back the fruitcake the two had spent over thirty years exchanging every Christmas, with the addendum that "unlike you, I'm really dead".

    Theatre 

-   In _Angels in America_, Roy Cohn pulls this trick on the ghost/hallucination/whatever of Ethel Rosenberg, who happily pushes the nurse's call button — only to have Roy spring back to life and gloat at her about falling for it. Subverted almost immediately, when the monitors Roy's hooked up to flatlines, and he dies for real.
-   Older Than Feudalism: In _Electra_, Orestes' plot to murder his mother and step-father relies on lulling them into a false sense of security by sending a messenger stating Orestes died in a chariot race. Electra is devastated by the loss until the moment her brother reveals himself, and from then on she helps him keep the deception.
-   William Shakespeare:
    -   In _Romeo and Juliet_, Juliet fakes her death to avoid being forced to marry Paris. It goes badly after a message letting Romeo know that she's really okay fails to reach him.
    -   _Henry IV, Part 1_: Falstaff plays dead during a battle to avoid getting really killed.
    -   _Much Ado About Nothing_: Hero fakes her death after Claudio is tricked into denouncing her, as part of a plot to uncover the guilty party and find out Claudio's true feelings.
    -   _The Winter's Tale_, in which Hermione apparently fakes her own death for _sixteen years_ just so she can pose as her own statue (voluntarily or otherwise) and come back to life in front of her husband and now grown-up daughter.
    -   Notably used in _Antony and Cleopatra_: Cleopatra tells a messenger to tell Antony that she is dead. This results in Antony killing himself and Cleopatra hitting the Despair Event Horizon.
-   _Wicked the Musical_, where Elphaba pretends to melt, but goes down a trapdoor instead to wait for Fiyero... who, by the way, is the Scarecrow. She sings a final refrain with Glinda and vanishes to another land with Fiyero, leaving Glinda to believe that she died for real. (Glinda did not realize she had back-up on the refrain.) As Fiyero says "She can't know. No-one must know." Oh, by the way, before she carries out this charade, she makes Glinda promise to never try and clear her (Elphaba's) name so that Oz will stay peaceful under Glinda's rule and the people won't turn against her. _Whew._ Note that this is not what happens in the book version of _Wicked_. In the book, Elphaba meets exactly the same end as in the original _Wizard of Oz_ book — Dorothy flings a bucket of water at her, and she dies.

    Theme Parks 

-   At the climax of Shrek 4D at Universal Studios, Fiona briefly pretends that she's a ghost and that she's finally fallen in love with Lord Farquaad, simply for the sake of mocking him.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_:
    -   It's revealed in _Minagoroshi-hen_ that Takano Miyo, the villain mastermind, has been faking her own death for every Hinamizawa to appear as a victim of the curse.
    -   Rika pulls one back in the final arc to throw Takano for a loop.
-   _Danganronpa_:
    -   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_
        -   The Mastermind is actually Junko Enoshima, the second person in the game to die. Or rather, her _twin sister posing as her_ was the second person in the game to die, while the real Junko was hiding behind the scenes the whole time.
        -   Alter Ego, an AI program created by Chihiro who has the laptop she's hiding in subject to an Execution, only to reveal later on that she's infected Hope's Peak's computer systems just in time to save Naegi from his own Execution, and returns later in _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_.
        -   In Chapter 3, Hifumi briefly pretends to be dead as part of his and Celeste's murder plot. He doesn't last long before getting Killed Off for Real, though.
    -   _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_ has this done by Kokichi Oma, the Ultimate Supreme Leader during the Chapter 3 investigation. Why? Just to mess with everyone. Though his bloody state is crucial to find out how the killer murdered Tenko.
-   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Spirit of Justice_, Manov Mistree, supposedly the magician Mr. Reus, plays dead in "The Magical Turnabout" as a part of a prank to Trucy. Unfortunately for him, Roger Retinz, the real Mr. Reus, takes advantage of the prank and kills him for real when he least expects it.
-   I Love You, Colonel Sanders!: The unnamed student faked his death after eating undercooked braised octopus tentacle prepared by Man Man for a really petty reason- to get people to talk about him for once. It somewhat works, as he starts appearing in all the weird dreams and hallucinations the protagonist gets from that point on.

    Web Animation 

-   Parodied in _Battle for Dream Island_. In the penultimate Season 1 episode "Insectophobe's Nightmare 2", after Flower bursts open an insect egg, this ends up resulting in the emerging insects going on a rampage that kills everyone except for the Announcer and David. When the Announcer decides to continue the rest of the competition with David clones he had made, the contestants suddenly all return, claiming that they had faked their deaths, despite there being no plausible way on how they could have done this.
-   Lear Dunham in _Broken Saints_. Rare variation in that the faked death is part of backstory, not a depicted event.
-   In _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, it is revealed that Rogal Dorn actually faked his death (which is portrayed in Warhammer 40,000's canon, making this a plot twist), and spent the last 10,000 years protecting the Emperor while masquerading as a Centurion.
    
    **Kittenstodes:** How are you here? Didn't you die while trying to stop a Black Crusade?  
    **Rogal Dorn:** No.  
    **Kittenstodes:** Well, what happened then?  
    **Rogal Dorn:** I survived.  
    **Kittenstodes:** How?  
    **Rogal Dorn:** By being dead. _In pretend._
    
-   Parodied in _The Spider Cliff Mysteries_. After surviving an explosion, Barlow suggests doing this. Crystal tells him it's a stupid idea.
-   Dr. Arthur Watts, one of the antagonists of _RWBY_ is remarked on as a "disgraced Atlesian scientist" by Raven. The people of Atlas presume Watts to be dead in something they call "the Paladin Incident". When Jacques Schnee remarks on it, Watts admits that he wanted everyone to think him dead, presumably so that he could begin working for Salem.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Beyond the Canopy_, Greliz and Jojo plan to do this as part of a confidence scheme. They organize a prize fight and serve as bookkeepers for the gambling. Their plan is to fake a fire before the fight ends, escape to the caves underground with all the gambled money, and then blow up the building after them—convincing all onlookers that they and the money went up in smoke.
-   In _Bob and George_ Protoman planted items to make himself look dead.
-   Agatha in _Girl Genius_. The unusual part is that given both circumstances and the habits during lifetime, it may double as a bizarre form of the funeral honours to the unfortunate who became their substitute corpse. Scamming the overlord of Europe into thinking she's the Heterodyne heir would be really hard to top. In Zeetha's opinion, however, this "perfect plan" had a flaw.
-   Renard/Reynardine in _Gunnerkrigg Court_, as he phrased it himself, "had the perfect disguise". Whether this happened mostly by coincidence or was planned by the mythological trickster himself is perhaps the biggest point of disagreement in the fandom.
-   Veithel of _Juathuur_, before the beginning of the story.
-   Vin in _Kevin & Kell_, with help from Rudy and Fiona, to escape retribution from R.L. Some time later, we see him living happily with a mate and offspring in The Wild.
-   In _Spacetrawler_, Dmitri uses holograms to make his attempted assassin (and the government that hired her) believe the assassination was successful.

-   _Wapsi Square_: Bia faked her death "to make her daughter stronger".

    Web Original 

-   _Economy Watch_: David fakes his death in Episode 30 in order to commit insurance fraud and get a life insurance benefit.
-   In _Worm_, Coil successfully pulls this off, staging a public death in his masked identity to allow his plans to go forward with his civilian identity taking a position of power.

    Real Life 

-   Elvis Presley: Elvis' death has been denied by some of his more obsessive fans. Similar conspiracy theories abound around other dead celebrities and/or historical figures, such as Adolf Hitler, Bruce Lee, Jim Morrison, Lady Diana, ...
-   The second-most famous performer believed to have faked their death is Andy Kaufman, Anti-Humor pioneer and performance artist (who, notably, was a huge Elvis fan and an impersonator). As the theory has it, he pulled his greatest prank in 1984 by faking his own death from lung cancer and will eventually deliver the punchline by revealing himself to have been alive and well for the past few decades. Kaufman himself often said this was something he wanted to do, though he ultimately pulled back on the idea because he didn't want his family to suffer (either by keeping the secret or believing he was dead). In 2014, his long-time friend Bob Zmuda and Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Margulies released a book titled _Andy Kaufman: The Truth, Finally_ which _claimed_ that the performer was still alive...
    -   The Kaufman Biopic _Man on the Moon_ incorporates this cheekily by playing Kaufman's illness and death straight, only to have the final shot be interpretable as either revealing that Kaufman did fake his death and is now performing again as his Tony Clifton alter ego or that he died and _someone else_ not identified for the viewer is just keeping the legend alive.
-   This is an actual crime, called "pseudocide" (literally 'pretend murder').
-   Reported by Talking Points Memo.
-   The police sometimes use this tactic to nab suspects. In one case, a woman hired a contract killer (actually an undercover cop) to kill her husband. The police then faked his death, providing photos and "evidence" in order to fool the wife into incriminating herself.
    -   In Russia where political and business-related assassinations are unpleasantly common, this is a very common tactic for the local police.
-   In matters of national security, or if the person's life will be in ongoing danger because of their testimony, the FBI may go as far as staging a closed-casket funeral for someone who is going into the Witness Relocation Program.
-   Christopher Marlowe, sometimes theorized to be the "real" Shakespeare, is also sometimes theorized to have faked his own death. Even though a coroner confirmed the _knife in his skull._
    -   Indeed, his autopsy report, witness reports, and court documentation make this one of the best-recorded events of the Elizabethan era. And people _still_ believe this man lived on to impersonate Shakespeare for decades.
-   People have been claiming since April 3, 1882, that Jesse James and Bob Ford faked James' murder. There was a two hour special on History International about this, albeit with very shaky reasoning on the "he didn't die" side. (At one point, a photo of a 20-something James is compared to the official post-mortem photo. The two photos have different hairlines, which "proves" they are of two different men. Because no male _ever_ suffers from receding hairline.)
    -   These theories were largely put to rest after an exhumation proved that the man in Jesse James' grave was a descendant of Jesse James' mother.
    -   Similar theories exist to claim that Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid faked the former's killing of the latter. The story (which has no real evidence to substantiate it) is that the lawman and the outlaw were actually childhood friends, and they created a win-win situation out of the Kid's fugitive status: Garrett got the bounty and the Kid got to start a new life in Mexico. Several people have even come forward many decades later to claim they were Billy the Kid. There's even been a DNA test done from the remains of one of the claimants against blood allegedly from Billy the Kid, but the test results have not been revealed. The location of the body that was buried as Billy the Kid, regardless of whether it was really him, is not known for sure, due to a flood that washed away all the tombstones in the cemetery. A marker currently designates where the grave is estimated to be, but the uncertainty means testing that body against the blood sample would be pointless.
-   According to NAVIGaTR, George Wood from _Gaming in the Clinton Years_ allegedly died between 2006 and 2008. However, in 2009, a video showed up on YouTube showing George Wood on a local talk show talking about President Obama. Not to mention that NAViGaTR had been making a huge fuss about George Wood in anticipation for their big Halloween cruise party, in such a way that if he isn't alive then it's pretty disrespectful - not to mention how NAVIGaTR publicly and loudly claim his cause of death was a drug overdose, which is something you wouldn't really want to publicize regardless of whether someone was dead or alive. For the longest time, NAVIGatR had been very "nudge-nudge-wink-wink" about his supposed death and it was difficult to get the actual truth of the matter out of them. However, in April 2015, they released multiple videos proving Wood is still alive.
-   Many kinds of animals fake their own death as a last resort to protect themselves from predators. For some reason, many hunters won't eat what is already dead.
    -   If you find something dead, it may well have started rotting already. If it's suddenly dead but with no traces of injury, it can be assumed that it died from poison or some form of sickness that makes it undesirable to eat. While a human might stop to check the prey more thoroughly, many animal predators don't and leave it alone due to instinct. Dead, but not eaten, and I didn't kill it? There must be something wrong with it.
    -   Hognose snakes are really good at this; they even produce a smell to make sure any predator with a sense of smell thinks they're dead. (They also pretend to be venomous snakes; the weird thing is that they _need_ a plan B.)
    -   Playing Possum: Possums don't only fake their own death when they feel threatened. They also mimic the smell of rotten meat thanks to a foul-smelling fluid that they secrete.
    -   Horned toads (actually small spiky lizards) not only flip onto their backs and hold still and stiff to fool predatory snakes, but they also flatten themselves and suck in their bellies to look like a dry, desiccated carcass whose innards have shriveled.
    -   More a single animal example than anything: At the Tower of London, noticing how much attention the recently deceased raven James Crow got, another raven, by the name of Edgar Sopper played dead to such a degree that the ravenmaster seriously thought he had passed away. When the ravenmaster came and picked up his "corpse", he bit him and flew off, laughing his raven laugh.
    -   Some spiders curl their legs and stay stiff, looking as a dead one. Convincing most of the time, not so much when they do so while for example descending to the ground using a thread, that keeps coming from the supposedly dead spider's spinnerets.
-   There had been a myth saying that if cornered by a Brown Bear, a human should play dead to escape it, as bears would not eat corpses. Although it works in Real Life, as people with knowledge of the wild can tell, bears and other carnivores _can_ and _will_ scavenge corpses and can easily tell the difference between a still man on the ground and a dead one. The true reason behind the playing dead issue is to convince the bruin you're not a threat: if the beast sees the potential opponent stays down and does not move, will examine it for a little and then move away to more useful things like searching for food.
-   According to the historian Suetonius, when Nero held special musical recitals and refused to let anyone leave for hours no matter how pressing the reason, some members of the audience would pretend to die in order to be carried away for burial.
-   In The Big Con, Maurer explains how if the con didn't go quite as smoothly as it should have done, somebody would get mad at the con man and punch him, when he would release the cacklebladder he prepared earlier, leaking blood everywhere. Now the victim of the con would believe he was guilty of/an accessory to murder and would be happy to run away, no further questions asked.
-   Sometimes done by victims in school shootings, where everyone except the gunman is unarmed, and frequently trapped in classrooms with only one way out. Often it succeeds because most mass shooters don't double-check to make sure every single victim is actually dead, but fires off round after round into a loaded classroom and leaves everyone for dead. On an especially heartbreaking example of this is of one of the first-grade students whose classroom was attacked by Adam Lanza in the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. Lanza fired enough to shoot most of the people in the classroom _multiple times_; but missed her. She threw herself to the floor, in her classmates' blood, and waited for him to leave. Of course, he killed himself when he heard the police coming.
-   A man in Sanshui, Guangdong, attempts to evade his bank loan debt by purchasing a corpse with $4000 YMB, crashing his car into an electric pole and setting it on fire. In order to fake his own death, he contacts his friend, who happens to be a mortician in a hospital, to purchase a corpse, claiming that he needs it for a ghost marriage. He then uses the corpse to fake a traffic accident. However, his attempt is eventually foiled when the investigators find out that not only does the DNA not match the man's parents, the corpse he uses to fake his death _turns out to be a woman_, and she was already severely rotten long before the man uses her. The man ends up being convicted of deliberate corpse destruction for his troubles, whereas his mortician friend is convicted of illegal corpse trade and disrespecting corpses.
-   SAVx of _NoPixel_ apparently faked reports of his own suicide after receiving a 30-day ban from the server, according to the server owner. Sav's name had previously been memorialized in the server's memorial wall, but was quickly removed once they determined that he actually wasn't dead.
-   In September, 2020, Susan Meachen's daughter (or Meachen pretending to be her daughter) posted on Facebook that she, Susan, had committed suicide in response to online bullying, which devastated the tight-knit group of fans and friends she had made. Come early 2023, she reemerged and admitted her suicide was staged. Needless to say, her fans were pissed.
-   Ramon Sosa faked his own death after being informed by his friend Mundo that his wife Lulu had plotted to hire a hitman to kill him and make it look like a carjacking gone wrong. To make his faked death look genuine, police painted on him so that he looked like he was killed from a single headshot, and then sent a photo of his "corpse" to Lulu by an agent who posed as the hitman Mundo "hired". Once her payment to the "hitman" was revealed, police began to fake Ramon's death, and upon Lulu's belated reaction to his "death", the police quickly arrested her. The full story can be found here.
