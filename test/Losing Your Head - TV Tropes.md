_"Now tho' you'd have said that head was dead  
(For its owner dead was he),  
It stood on its neck, with a smile well-bred,  
And bowed three times to me!"_

— **Pooh-Bah**, _The Mikado_ ("The Criminal Cried")

A beheading can be a messy and extremely painful thing to see, let alone experience. While it's been said that, theoretically (it's understandably hard to confirm), consciousness may continue for a few seconds after decapitation, <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in _fiction,_ consciousness after decapitation can last much, _much_ longer... or even indefinitely. The severed head generally possesses the ability to audibly speak despite their mouth no longer being connected to their lungs, and may or may not even be capable of _independent movement_, either by bouncing, rolling or levitating. Sometimes the body will still be functional and capable of moving on its own, resulting in the head trying to tell it to pick it up and reattach it.

This trope can be justified for robots, which may have a power source in their skull that keeps them going after it's been separated from their shoulders: they may not have their core processor in their head anyway. The Undead and other supernatural beings may also exhibit an ability to have a functioning head separate from their still-functioning body. Robots could also have their entire vocal system located in their head, but any biological creature should only be able to mouth words.

When multiple heads/brains/souls/CPUs/etc. are removed and then reinstalled in working order at the same time, this will almost always result in them being "returned" to the wrong bodies, giving a Visceral "Freaky Friday" Flip.

See: Alas, Poor Yorick, Brain in a Jar, Helping Hands, Your Head A-Splode, Cranial Processing Unit, Detachment Combat, Oracular Head. Related to Headless Horseman, Pulling Themselves Together, Appendage Assimilation, and Having a Heart. Contrast Decapitation Required, when it's the _only_ way to kill them successfully. For decapitation in general, see Off with His Head!. Not to be confused with Talking Heads, which is a stylistic convention.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The first _Appleseed_ movie had a pair of gynoids with cutting whips that did quite a number on Hitomi's car and later on Briareos' Hand Cannon as well. Then when a gynoid thinks it will be taken prisoner, it twirls the wire around its own head to slice up its cranial section. However the lower jaw section apparently has enough functional circuitry to say the cryptic words: "The Appleseed seal must not be unlocked" before it's destroyed by a Boom, Headshot! (implied to have been fired to stop anything further from being said).
-   In the manga _Astro Boy_'s head is apparently not that well attached, judging by the frequency of which it detaches. Though it's stated that his electronic brain is in his chest and not his head, which is just for talking, hearing, and sight.
-   _Attack on Titan_:
    -   Titans can generally survive the removal of their heads (which they'll quickly regenerate), often being able to keep walking without it. Even on the occasions where decapitation kills them, it's not actually the loss of the head, but when the process of its removal also happens to cut away the nape of the neck.
    -   Eren gets his head blown clean off by Gabi's anti-Titan rifle, but stays conscious long enough to enter the Paths once his head lands in Zeke's hand. He then becomes a mountain-sized skeletal Titan, but his true form inside is just his head. When Mikasa finally severs him from his Titan body, his remaining head instantly dies this time.
-   Normally, humans and demons die when Guts of _Berserk_ shears their heads off. The Count from the Guardians of Desire arc proves to be quite more resilient than that, which drives Guts to torture him further because he "doesn't know how to fucking die."
-   In _Black Lion_, one of Ginnai's attacks involve him launching his cyborg head off his neck, which then fires his Eye Beams all over the place at his opponents while flying on rockets attached to his neck. It _needs_ to be seen to be believed.
-   In _Claymore_ normally cutting the head is the surest way to kill a Claymore or an Awakened being, except when it isn't. Two or three Awakened Being defied this norm.
    -   Of them, Europa is the one who plays this trope the straightest as she's able to "play dead" by being decapitated while in Human form and then transform in her true Awakened form Decapitation has otherwise no effect on her.
    -   The other two are Priscilla, who's not only resistant to decapitation but has the ability to regenerate From a Single Cell, and "Bloody" Agatha, who basically cheats as her human body is just an appendage while her true "necks" that connect her head to her true body are her hairs; when she was decapitated in battle she all but mocked her enemies.
-   Dowman Sayman's _The Collector and the Phantom Pain_ is a short story about Narumiya, a girl who finds her friend in pieces while on her way to school. Narumiya speaks to the girl's head and offers her help in recovering the scattered body parts, which fell inexplicably in the hands of other clingy school girls who refuse to give them away, and easily does so but secretly keeps her friend's breasts to herself, telling her that she was unable to find them. Narumiya's friend doesn't mind, however, saying that she feels them being taken care of very affectionately.
-   May spends most of _Coyote Ragtime Show_ as a disembodied head after Mister blows her up with an RPG.
-   Played for Laughs in _Doctor Slump_. Arale is a little android girl whose head pops off quite easily. For example, this may cause momentary horror in an onlooker who thinks she's human.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Sergeant Metallic in the original _Dragon Ball_ has his head blown up by Goku's Kamehameha, but survives as he's a robot. Surely, it scares and surprises him. Shortly after, however, Metallic runs out of battery.
    -   After Vegeta decapitates Guldo, Guldo's head survives long enough to yell at Vegeta before getting vaporized altogether.
    -   Similarly, Doctor Gero (a cyborg) is still able to rant after Android 17 decapitates him. 17 fixes this by _stomping_ on Gero's head.
    -   In _Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler_, Cooler was reduced to his head after Goku knocked him into the sun in _Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge_. He fuses with a machine called the Big Gete Star and makes robot copies of himself.
    -   Happens to Android 16 (who, unlike other "androids", is 100% mechanical) after he gets blown to bits in the Cell arc. After his Final Speech, Cell steps on the head and destroys it. Which makes Gohan go BATSHIT on Cell.
    -   When Majin Buu punches Babidi's head to mush, his body continues to move until Buu vaporizes it.
    -   Majin Buu has his head blasted off during the fight against Kid Buu (having been removed from Kid Buu's system). It's easily reformed from his body, however, since he can regenerate from almost every wound.
-   _Durarara!!_: Quite literally. Her head wasn't attached to begin with, but losing it is what sent Celty to search for it in Ikebukuro.
-   A number of people have had odd things happen to their heads in _Franken Fran_. Fran herself has sewn her own head back on after decapitation.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Greed has Law take his head off with a huge sledgehammer as a demonstration of his powers. He then tells him to improve his aim after regenerating, due to him missing a part of his jaw.
    -   Al gets his head taken off multiple times. Of course, this barely affects him. He can still speak, as it seems the sound comes from the blood seal that's in the armor's body, which seems to indicate his head is essentially decorative.
    -   Same goes for Barry; he just snaps his head back on whenever it gets knocked off.
    -   Slicer's blood seal is in the helmet, so while it's still not fatal it does incapacitate him. Of course, then his younger brother can just take over.
-   _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_: Batou is attacked by a Mini-Mecha who blows his head off. The pilot gets a shock when Batou's head starts talking back to him, as Batou has hacked his cyborg eyes and sent a false image. An unharmed Batou is actually standing right behind the pilot. Cue Boom, Headshot!.
-   Happens to various individuals around the heroine repeatedly in _Hellsing_, falling somewhere between Gorn and Narm.
-   _Interviews with Monster Girls_: The dullahan class of demi-humans have their heads detached from their bodies from birth, but their heads and bodies are synchronized even if they are miles away (for example, if the head eats, the body will eventually have to go to the bathroom, and if the body stubs its toe, the head will scream in pain), to the point that wormholes were being suspected in-universe.
-   _Inuyasha_:
    -   Naraku often sends disguised puppets to fight in his place. The first time that this is revealed, the puppet is beheaded, and appears to be dead. After the protagonists let down their guard, the puppet springs back to life, including the head which rolls upright again, and begins to speak.
    -   The episode "3000 Leagues in Search of Father" also focuses around this. Demons have enough vigor to survive decapitation for a day or two, which leads to the son of a demon to find his father's body and place the head back on.

    -   _Phantom Blood_: Dio Brando decapitates himself to avoid being killed by Jonathan's Hamon. He later steals Jonathan Joestar's body to replace his own.
    -   _Battle Tendency_: Wamuu briefly survives getting his head blown off, but Hamon already spread to it, so he dies not too long afterward.
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: Vanilla Ice decapitates himself using his own Stand so he can offer his blood to Dio. Dio then uses his own blood to revive Ice, claiming "you don't need to die." Since Dio used his blood, Vanilla Ice becomes a vampire, making him unkillable until Polnareff exposes him to sunlight. Unfortunately for Ice, although he knew about the weakness, he didn't realize _he_ was a vampire.
    -   _Golden Wind_: Bruno Buccellati uses his zipper-ability to unzip rival gangster Zucchero's head clean off, which the other team members then hang from a fish hook in an attempt to interrogate him. When Zucchero refuses to comply, they resort to the Torture Dance, while Zucchero's head dangles helplessly by his eyelid and is Forced to Watch.
-   In episode 18 of _Kill la Kill_, Satsuki decapitates Ragyo during their epic confrontation. However, since Ragyo is a Life Fiber hybrid, she has no trouble at all putting herself back together - or beating the crap out of Satsuki afterward.
-   Kendaman from _Kinnikuman_ uses his head as a weapon, which is easy considering it's more or less _a wrecking ball attached to his arm_.
-   _Living Dead!_: Being a Flesh-Eating Zombie, Monako's parts fall off easily, especially her head as it can pop off her neck or tumble with enough force.
-   _Mazinger Z_: Count Brocken was a Nazi ex-officer that got mortally wounded. Dr. Hell found him when he was dying, cut his head from his body and turned him into a cyborg. His head always follows him around, either floating on its own or resting on one of his hands.
    
    -   This was carried to Memetic Mutation levels in _Shin Mazinger_.
    
    "Brocken BALL! The game where everyone wins. Except Brocken".
    
-   _Midori Days_ did this with an android-version of a character. After she had been separated from her legs, her body later self destructed, but her head survived to jet into the professor who made her.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam_'s Grand Finale has 2 of this. Char's Zeong has a cockpit as the mobile armor's head, and he eventually has to separate it from the body. The Gundam gets it head tore off during the battle, and the famous "Last Shooting" pose has it shoots a beam rifle into a colony to destroy an empty Zeong's head, without a head nor a left arm.<small>◊</small>
-   _Monster Musume_: Lala, being a dullahan, has her head permanently detached from her body. Normally, she leaves her head on her neck, but sometimes it gets knocked off and she has to get it back. Body and head are both capable of acting independently, but the body lacks the head's senses and needs to get it back in order to use them. The head, however, is very conscious of whatever the body's feeling.
-   Hidan from _Naruto_ is immortal, but one time it was cut off he couldn't move until Kakuzu used his threads to sew it back on. Later Kakuzu isn't around to reattach it, and Shikamaru cuts his head off, but decides to be more thorough and blows up his body while throwing his head into a deep pit in the private land of the Nara clan and then buries it in an avalanche. While the head is screaming curses at him.
    -   Later still, Kisame (not really) has this happen to him, and he is somehow able to get off a compliment on his opponents' abilities as his head _flies through the air_.
-   Invoked in class 3-A's Haunted House in the Mahora Festival of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, where Akira, the guide in the school themed haunted house, appeared to get decapitated and her head told Negi to run away. She's actually just lying on the ground with a cover that matches the floor tiles camouflaging the rest of her body, but Negi was too freaked out to notice.
    -   In the backstory, Tertium did this to Secundum after Secundum "rewrote" Shiori's older sister, effectively erasing the poor girl out of existence.
-   Chronologically, this is how Genma gets introduced in _Ninja Scroll_, his head gets chopped off. It's later shown he can regenerate any wound ever, and someone put his head back on his neck and he sports a visible scar.
-   Buggy the Clown from _One Piece_ can separate any body part, but his move "Chop Chop Quick Escape" involves him popping his head off to stop people from punching his face.
    -   There's also Trafalgar Law, who apparently can do similar things to other people. The first instance of him using tricks like that in the manga involves a justifiably weirded out marine juggling the talking head of one of his comrades.
    -   Crocodile got his head sliced off by Doflamingo, but because he can use his Logia fruit's reformation power by reflex he attached it just a second later.
    -   This only happened in the manga, but after being attacked by Dalton, Wapol's troupe of doctors were quick to patch him up... except for the fact that they hadn't reattached his head to his body, which they did off-panel.
    -   After the Timeskip, Brook gets his head taken off by a Fish Man Pirate, but then reveals he's perfectly fine. Since learning to master the power of his Revive-Revive Fruit, Brook learned that it was the power of his soul keeping his body moving. Since he has no vital organs to risk, it's a simple matter to pop his head back on.
-   _Princess Mononoke_: "Cut off a wolf's head and it still has the power to bite."
-   _Reiko the Zombie Shop's_ protagonist zombifies her own head after an unfortunate run-in with a serial killer. She gets a new body in the second volume.
-   _Rio -Rainbow Gate!-_ uses this as a Running Gag with Linda the Robot Girl.
-   Played for Laughs in _Rosario + Vampire_ by Ling-Ling, a zombie who can (and frequently does) freely detach and reattach her body parts, most especially her head.
-   Subverted in _3×3 Eyes_ during the combat between Yakumo and Benares on the moon: true, Wu such as themselves can survive anything, even decapitation (which happened to Yakumo himself earlier on in the manga) but, as Benares pointed out, the sheer pain of having your head graphically torn from your neck is enough to reduce the victim in a comatose state.
-   Kikuchiyo's introduction in _Samurai 7_ has him get decapitated by Kambei as part of a ploy act to distract a guy holding a baby hostage, with his head later berating him for stealing his rescue attempt. Later on, in an infiltration plan in which some of the samurai let themselves get captured, his head is delivered as a trophy, while his body enters enemy territory hidden within a pile of hay.
-   _Time Stop Hero_: Vampires cannot be killed by decapitation or dismemberment. Their heads can still talk and they can eventually pull themselves back together. The only way to kill them is to expose them to sunlight or holy light, which will turn them to dust.

-   _You Are Being Summoned, Azazel_: This constantly happens to Azazel, though he often has it coming.
-   The duel between Mai and Marik in the _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ manga. Mai's monster manages to decapitate Marik's monster, which are both tied by lifelines to their respective duelists. Guess what happens to Marik...

    -   _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ introduces the Headless Hunt, a Wild Hunt-esque troupe of Headless Horsemen who partake in Severed Head Sports like Horseback Head-Juggling, Head Polo, and Headless Bowling. A perennial source of frustration for Nearly Headless Nick is that he can't join because his head is still attached to his neck by one little strip of flesh.
    -   One means of communicating via the Floo network is to have just your head travel through fireplaces to speak with whoever is on the other side. The feeling while doing so is described as having a hot muffler around one's head and neck.
-   Averted in Michael Slade's _Headhunter_. When the POV of a just-decapitated woman is shown, she can only think, not speak or breathe, and remains conscious only briefly.
-   There's a medical horror novel, _Heads_, in which the heads of people who'd agreed to donate their bodies for research are kept preserved and wired up as organic supercomputers. Nobody warned them that it'd be their _heads_ that were made use of... or that they'd regain consciousness once integrated into the system.
-   The Denizens of the House in _Keys to the Kingdom_ have the ability to survive being decapitated, so of course one bad guy announces himself by flinging talking severed heads at the main character's feet.
-   _Known Space_:
    -   In _Ringworld_, Nessus, a Pierson's Puppeteer, is decapitated. Luckily, not only does his species have _two_ heads, but neither of them are where Puppeteers keep their brain. It's at most an inconvenience until he can get a new head attached.
    -   The short story "Procrustes" starts off with Beowulf Schaefer stepping out of an autodoc. It's later revealed that he was in it because he had been beheaded and was regrown from the removed head.
-   _A Land Fit for Heroes_: The baddies in _The Steel Remains_ cut off their victims' heads and do really terrible things to them, by way of an object lesson to anyone who tries to work against them.
-   _Land of Oz_:
    -   Princess Langwidere, a character in _Ozma of Oz_. She has 30 different heads that she can place on her neck. Her heads come in a variety of hair, eye, and skin colors. Princess Langwidere was the inspiration for Mombi in the adaptation (see _Return to Oz_), and given a chilling treatment in the Scissor Sisters song "Return to Oz". Mombi and Langwidere were separate characters in Baum's books, and the latter was merely a spoiled and careless Royal Brat instead of a villain.
    -   In _The Tin Woodman of Oz_, the Tin Woodman returns to the (now empty) tinworker's house and finds his original, flesh-and-blood head. (For him, the trope was inverted: he lost the rest of his body.) They have a conversation and find they don't like each other.
    -   In _The Marvelous Land of Oz_ (which features Mombi), when Jack Pumpkinhead is riding in the flying Gump, he refuses to look over the side, fearing that his head might fall off. Prof. Wogglebug lampshades this with one of his insensitive puns, declaring: "In that event your head would no longer be a pumpkin, for it would become a squash."
    -   Later on in the _Oz_ books, Jack Pumpkinhead has his own pumpkin patch. Every time his head begins to spoil, he carves out a new head for himself.
-   In _The Master and Margarita_, during Woland's magic show, Behemoth rips off Bengalsky's head. Bengalsky's severed head is conscious and horrified by the ordeal. They soon put his head back on with him being no worse for wear.
-   In _The Legend of Huma_, Huma has to fight the immortal warlord Crynus. After running him through the neck and the stomach barely slows him down, Huma gets his hands on Crynus' battle axe and knocks off his head with one blow. Then Crynus's body stands up again and starts to stumble single-mindedly towards his severed head. He almost reaches it before the silver dragon arrives and disintegrates him with dragonfire.
-   The Headless Horseman in _The Legend of Sleepy Hollow_.
-   Urza in the _Magic: The Gathering_ tie-in novels to the "Invasion" block. Planeswalkers being energy beings, this is understandable.
-   The fate of Edward Page Mitchell's Absent-Minded Professor Prof. Dummkopf in the 1877 short story "The Man Without a Body", in the aftermath of what may be fiction's earliest Teleporter Accident. Unusually for this trope, Dummkopf is rendered mute by the loss of his vocal cords, and as a result, it takes several years before anyone notices that the loss of his lungs, heart, and other vital organs hasn't inconvenienced him in the slightest.
-   In _The Nekropolis Archives_ novel _Dead Streets_, main character Matthew Richter gets decapitated. Since he's already a zombie, it doesn't kill him, but it renders him unable to do anything but talk until his friends are able to get it reattached.
-   The Mighty Night Dragon from, uh, _Night Dragon_. Upon being defeated (in a long, exhausting, difficult battle), the dragon then finally goes down... but not before its head detaches itself, grows legs, and continues fighting.
-   _Njal's Saga_: Kari, intent on revenge for the death of his son in the Burning of Njal, pursues the Burners on their voyage to Rome and catches up with them in Wales. He spots Kol Thorsteinsson, one of the Burners, selling goods at a market; Kari strikes at him just as Kol is counting silver, and "Kol kept on counting the silver, and his head counted 'ten' as it flew from the trunk."
-   Sacha and Wyan from _The Prism Pentad_. They were decapitated for not siding against Rajaat, and were turned into zombie heads by Kalak. They serves as mentors for King Tithian during the series. Oh, they also have a desire for human flesh and blood.
-   In many of the _Revelation Space Series_ novels, space suits are designed to deliberately decapitate and then freeze the user's head in the event of an emergency (such as a suit breach). Once the head is recovered, they can be reattached to the body or even have their whole body regrown from the neck down, though in at least one novel a character opts to have his head installed on a prosthetic body and is pretty much none the worse for wear.
-   Discussed (in a way) in _Saga of the Jomsvikings_, when a captured Viking facing execution suggests he will hold up his knife if he still can after being beheaded.
-   _The Saga of the People of Laxardal_: Audgisl Thorarinsson looks for an opportunity to kill Thorgils Holluson at the Althing and comes upon Thorgils as he is counting out the money he is to pay for the killing of Helgi. As Thorgils is counting 'ten', Audgisl strikes, and "everyone thought they could hear his head say 'eleven' as it flew off his body."
-   Early in _Sandman Slim_, Stark cuts off the head of Kasabian, the hardest-luck member of the circle that sent him to Hell. He did so with an enchanted knife that only kills when he orders it to, so Kasabian's head sits in his closet for most of the book, bitching about its state. Near the end, it dies outright, only to get sent back by Lucifer as part of a job deal. Between the first book and _Kill the Dead_, Stark gets it an animated table with articulated legs so that it can move by itself.
-   In "The Scarlet Citadel", Tsotha-lanti tells Conan the Barbarian that "if you hack me in pieces, the bits of flesh and bone will reunite and haunt you to your doom!" The next moment, Conan cuts off his head. The head remained alive, and the body attempted to recover it. Fortunately, a friendly sorcerer took away the head, the body ran after him, and the king was rid of the need to find a solution.
-   Robert Olen Butler's _Severance_ is a short story collection in which each short story is told from the point of view of a beheading victim in their last minute or so of life.
-   In a poem by Shel Silverstein, the protagonist complains about losing their head and about the fact that they can't look for it ("'cause my eyes are on it"), call to it ("'cause my ears are on it") or even think about it ("'cause my brain is in it") — "so I guess I'll sit down on this rock/and rest for just a minute." (Three guesses what the "rock" is.)
-   _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_: The Green Knight comes to Camelot, taunts the knights, and issues a challenge: he will allow any knight to deal him one blow and then he will return the following year to inflict the same. Gawain accepts the challenge and decapitates him. The Green Knight picks up his severed head and tells him to meet him at the Green Chapel at the appointed time.
-   _Skulduggery Pleasant_'s real skull was stolen by goblins. The one on his neck now is an entirely different one, which he won in a poker game. After the third book, the original skull becomes the MacGuffin.
-   Averted in Charles de Lint's _Svaha_: A minor character who's just been beheaded by a Ninja sent by the Yakuza maintains consciousness only long enough to see his body collapse.
-   In _That Hideous Strength_, the title of Head of the N.I.C.E. turns out to be horribly literal. The villains are taking orders from a guillotined criminal's head, which they've kept alive by supplying it with artificial blood. And yes, Lewis was well aware that it wouldn't really work — that's a plot point.
-   In _Too Many Curses_, Decapitated Dan was a serial killer executed for strangling people, whose head and body were retrieved and de-fleshed by dark wizard Margle, then re-animated separately. Dan's talking skull rants insanely from atop the kitchen spice rack, whereas his body — no longer subordinated to his wicked mind — has become perfectly polite and helpful, cooking meals for Margle's kobold housekeeper and her friends among Margle's many transformed captives. "Mr. Bones" can't speak, but gestures or knocks to communicate.
-   _Use of Weapons_: Special Circumstances operative Cheradenine Zakalwe crash-lands on a primitive planet and is sacrificed by the natives through decapitation. Fortunately, his colleagues zoom in just in time to snatch back his head, but not before he's had a horrified moment to realize exactly what just happened. Later, Zakalwe is in hospital waiting for a new body to be grown (they gave him the choice of remaining unconscious, but he'd rather watch television) when the artificially intelligent drone Skaffen-Amtiskaw (who doesn't like Zakalwe much and has a twisted sense of humor) sends him a present: a hat.
-   In _Veniss Underground_, the genetically engineered assassin-class meerkats produced by Quin are capable of surviving for several days as just a head. Shadrach decapitates the meerkat Salvador in order to render him harmless and portable, and renames him "John the Baptist".
-   At one point in the _Voidskipper_ novel _In Pursuit of Bark's Finest_, Madeline Zargosty gets her head blown off in a firefight. Courtesy of several backup brains and other redundancies this proves to be only a minor inconvenience, allowing her to keep fighting effectively for an extended period afterwards. Later on, she gets her morph updated to have a detachable head as a normal feature instead of an emergency backup.
-   _Worzel Gummidge_ only has three heads — swede, mangel-wurzel, and turnip — "for different occasions".
-   The heads in jars of Orson Scott Card's _Wyrms_. They are kept alive by bio-engineered alien worms, and are chemically conditioned to never lie. The king keeps them as advisors, and many of them openly hate him, and were his enemies in their former lives. They can't speak unless someone pumps the bellows that push air through their vocal cords.
-   _Xanth_: In _A Spell for Chameleon_, Trent beheads the mortally wounded Herman at his request. Herman's severed head thanks him for a quick and clean death.
-   The giant Bolloggs from Walter Moers' _Zamonia_ novels are unique in Zamonia in that they can survive without their heads; once they reach a certain height they tend to discard their heads — and then go off on wanderings looking for the same heads they just discarded. (Bolloggs aren't very bright, especially not after losing their heards.) In _The 13 ½ Lives of Captain Bluebear_, one of the many obstacles the titular character has to face is a huge, discarded Bollogg head.
-   One of the historical stories from _The Zombie Survival Guide_ had a tale told to a Jesuit Missionary in Feudal Japan. The story goes that Japan had a secret society whose function was to hunt down and eliminate zombies, and the finial initiation was for an acolyte to spend a full night sitting in a room full of moaning zombie heads that had been cut off and preserved in jars. The "editor" of these historical stories does note that this would be impossible because of the Fridge Logic about the zombies needing lungs to moan, thus either meaning the tale is false, exaggerated, or the moans are the product of the terror felt by the acolytes.
    -   The book also contains several other cases of zombie heads kept in jars, either as part of ancient science experiments or as oddities in various courts.
-   An old Urban Legend tells the story of a young girl that wears a ribbon around her neck and how she falls in love with a wonderful boy. At the end of the tale, the boy is forced to remove the ribbon from the girl's neck, at which point her head falls clean off her body, revealing her to be Dead All Along. The story has a long history, and has since been adapted many times, from Alexandre Dumas' _The Woman with the Velvet Necklace_, to Washington Irving's _The Adventure of a German Student_, to Alvin Schwartz' _The Girl With the Green Ribbon_.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The comedy/documentary _50 Outrageous Animal Facts_ includes a clip of a CGI cockroach that loses its head.

Truth in Television, as roaches can live for days after decapitation.
-   S.T.A.N. in _Aaron Stone_ since he's a robot.
-   The _Amazing Stories_ episode "Go to the Head of the Class" has Sadist Teacher B.O. Beanes, after accidentally being killed by the hiccups spell, coming back to life with his head separate from his body because the picture used in the resurrection spell got torn in two.
-   In _All That_, Coach Kreeton receives an antique cannon as a birthday present, sticks his head inside and loses his head when it fires.
-   _Angel_:
    -   Angel figures out that an overzealous cop is a zombie when he decapitates the cop and the cop keeps on talking for awhile.
    -   Lorne gets his head sent to Cordelia on a platter in another episode. His people can survive this, however; as he explains, his species of demon only die if their body is mutilated too.
-   Spoofed in _The Black Adder_. After Edmund has beheaded Richard III, his ghost comes to haunt him, with his head flying playfully around the room.
-   _Bruce Coville's Book of... Nightmares II_: In _The Shadow Wood_, while traveling through the titular forest, one of the obstacles the hero faces is a headless knight... whose own head is used as the head of the mace he wields.
-   In an second season (yes, there was one) episode of _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century_, Mark Lenard, Sarek from _Star Trek: The Original Series_, played an ambassador from a planet where a symbiotic relationship existed between his kind, a living head, and a type of organism that resembled a headless body. He even points out to Buck that on his world, Buck would be considered a freak since Buck could _not_ remove his head.
-   The Headless Horseman does this to Piper, Paige, and Phoebe in _Charmed_ episode "The Legend of Sleepy Halliwell", with the sisters only surviving as they were decapitated in the Magic School that protects the residents from suffering permanent damage.
-   Rick Twittler ends up having his head and body separated at the end of the _Danger Force_ episode "A Henry Among Us".
-   One episode of _Dark Angel_ from season 2 featured an experimental assassin from Manticore whose head and body could operate independently. Max encounters the head and spends the majority of the episode trying to find and stop the body from assassinating a minister. Turns out it was All Just a Dream.
-   _Deadtime Stories_ has the episode "Little Magic Shop of Horrors" where a kid called Bo ends up with his head painlessly flying off his body... as a result of performing a bike flip about an hour or two after his best friend Peter's magic trick was performed.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Rose": The Doctor rips off the head of Mickey's Auton duplicate. In response:
        
        **Auton!Mickey:** Don't think that's going to stop me.
        
    -   The Face of Boe qualifies. Given who he is (Captain Jack Harkness), one wonders what happened to all the other bits and how the head part wound up so large.
    -   This seems to be a general trade mark of Russell T Davies-written episodes of the show. As well as the above, there are the Toclafane (severed heads in floating heavily-armed metal spheres), Max Capricorn in "Voyage of the Damned", and also, if you include disembodied faces, Lady Cassandra and poor Ursula.
    -   "The Pandorica Opens" demonstrates Cybermen can survive decapitation, then reattach their heads.
    -   The Headless Monks sometimes do this, keeping living heads around post-decapitation. Since the Monks behead you while you're alive, both the head and the body remain... active. The bodies seem to fall under the control of the other Monks (or possibly the papal mainframe) immediately after beheading. The heads apparently keep the same personality and are left to rot (or be preserved in boxes, if you're rich).
    -   "The Husbands of River Song" has _two_ characters losing their heads to the independently-functioning robot body of the tyrannical cyborg King Hydroflax when the Doctor and River Song make off with the monarch's head, which apparently underwent this trope many years ago. The heads remain alive as the body uses them to get information about the heroes' whereabouts; it can even store and switch between them. Later, another villain convinces the body not to take his head by offering to get him _the Doctor's_...
-   In the "Look at the Princess" trilogy of _Farscape_, John and his alien princess bride are turned into fully conscious statues so they can observe the workings of the Senate until it is time for them to begin their reign. The jealous prince tries punching him (ineffectively) but his Scarran associate decides to just chop John's head off in an attempt to render him unable to rule. The head is still able to talk (via magic headsets) until it is successfully reattached.
-   _Gods Of Honor_ sees Nezha challenged by the evil sorceror Shen Gong-bao to be _decapitated_, with their flying heads engaging on an impromptu Cranium Chase in the heavens while their headless bodies remain on the ground.
-   Happens in the _Good Luck Charlie_ episode "Gabe Turns 12-½" when Bob Duncan goes to the fridge to get some cake in a platter only to find P.J.'s very much alive head instead, which then asks where his body is at (which is never directly explained). Bob then realizes his son's unable to stop him so he eats a cupcake in front of his face. Of course, since it's an end credits gag, this never really happened.
-   Happens at the end of one of the Halloween Episodes of _Home Improvement_ called _A Night To Dismember_, where Tim and Jill Taylor have their disembodied heads in a basket and their bodies are implied to be somewhere else offscreen after their son decapitates them for his film.

-   In the _Journey to the West (1996)_ two-parter, Tang Sanzang and disciples faces off against the Tiger, Deer and Goat Demons, with their second challenge being _surviving_ decapitation. Wukong answers the Deer Demon's challenge, and as magical beings both of them can survive losing their heads and continue moving around unscathed... until Wukong sneakily turns one of his clones into a dog and steal the Deer Demon's head. With the head out of range, the demon quickly dies.
    
    **Deer Demon**: Reattach head. Reattach head. I said _reattach head_! What's going on?  
    **Sun Wukong**: \[_whispering to Bajie_\] His head's not coming back. I just turned a copy of myself into a dog and stole it.  
    **Deer Demon**: Reattach... _aaaargh!!!!_ \[_transforms into a headless deer carcass_\]
    
-   Happens in _Kyojuu Tokusou Juspion_ to Gilza after Juspion beheads her, to which she not only survives but also manages to immediately summon her head back, which is capable of speech even when still detached.
-   790, a robot, is beheaded in the pilot of _Lexx_, and tries to obtain a new body several times over the course of the series but never manages to keep one for long. Whereas Kai is dismembered or decapitated (sometimes both, such as his fight with Thodin) fairly regularly but since he's already dead it amounts to little more than a momentary inconvenience before he puts himself back together.
-   In the _Lost Girl_ episode "Where There's a Will, There's a Fae" shows this as one of the clear ways of telling apart a dullahan from a human, that and the fact that they are also able to shrug off most injuries like they were nothing.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_:
    -   Tom Servo's gumball machine head falls off a few times. This happened quite often during shooting, as the Hilarious Outtakes show, and sometimes they decided to Throw It In.

-   The "Job Interview" sketch from _No Soap, Radio_ has a disembodied head waddling around a desk as the president of a hat company.
-   In _Once Upon a Time_ the victims of the Queen of Hearts experience this. Jefferson a.k.a. The Mad Hatter is unfortunate enough to be a demonstration. He recovers, but it does leave a nasty scar.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   Bones, the first Monster of the Week on _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ can detach his skull and have it fly around to attack his enemies.
    -   And in _Power Rangers in Space_, Ecliptor could separate his head from his body, and the head would fly around and fire Eye Beams while the body continued to attack with his usual sword.
    -   Mack of _Power Rangers Operation Overdrive_ discovered that he was a robot when he woke up to see his headless body lying on a slab nearby.
-   A duo known as "The Floating Heads" appear to startle LeVar Burton in an installment of _Reading Rainbow_.
-   _Red Dwarf_. Kryten has multiple spare heads on a shelf that argue with one another.
-   JD in _Scrubs_ has three odd daydreams of Head and Body Doctor where he imagines life as a floating head with his body doing something else. \[1\]
-   Happens to Data a few times in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_; as an android, he can survive his head being removed and can still talk in that event. Some examples:
    -   In the Time Travel episode "Time's Arrow", his head doesn't remain active while disconnected from his body, but it does survive under San Francisco for five hundred years, and when reconnected to his body (which was blown back through the time portal into the 24th century, thus not taking The Slow Path), it works fine.
    -   In "Disaster", Data offers to use himself to absorb an electric current, allowing Riker to pass, which will cripple him, but should leave him repairable later on. Riker points out to him that even if he's willing to sacrifice Data (which he isn't), it would be pointless, as Riker wouldn't be able to fix the Warp Core without him as he's not an engineer. Instead, they disconnect Data's head and toss his headless body into the current, diverting it, but allowing Riker to take Data's head along so he can talk him through the necessary repairs.
    -   In the Expanded Universe novel _Imzadi_, a decapitated Data is still in control of his body.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   In "Slash Fiction", Bobby discovers that a Leviathan can survive even after you cut its head off (the head actually managing to somehow return to its body), so he puts the head in a box and tells a friend to chuck it off a bridge. "Don't open it, even if it starts talking. _Especially_ if it starts talking."
    -   In "Baby", the Monster of the Week can survive decapitation and is extremely pissed off about it.
-   Reversed in _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_, in which Cromartie's body seeks out his head which does not appear to have any activity.
-   _Ultra Series_
    -   The _Ultraseven_ monster Gabura was able to survive as a floating head after Seven chopped it off with his Eye Slugger, catching the hero by surprise. Fortunately for Seven, it turned out that the spaceship of the aliens commanding Gabura needed to be destroyed to kill the monster permanently.
    -   _Ultraman Taro_ had Mukadender, who could detach its head from its body at will to fight as two combatants. The catch is that damage to Mukadendar’s head is still felt by its body and vice versa (same goes with actions such as being thrown into the air).
    -   Sakuna Oni from _Ultraman Tiga_ pulled the same trick on Tiga that Gabura did to Seven as the only thing that can truly slay Sakuna Oni is the sword of the samurai who originally defeated it.
-   Rhonda Shear did this in wraparounds on _USA Up All Night_.
-   Orpheus spends most of the _Xena: Warrior Princess_ episode _Girls Just Wanna Have Fun_ without his body.

-   _The Young Ones_, Vyvyan sticks his head out the train window and another train cuts it off. His head lies in the tracks calling out to his body, which stumbles around looking for him.
    -   And then kicks it further along the track after the head insults it.
    -   Another time, two head-carrying ghosts wander through the lads' flat and accidentally drop their heads, forcing the bodies to stumble around picking up round objects ("No, that's a grapefruit!") in search of them. Later, the ghostly heads are seen arguing about whose body is whose, and even _forehead-butting one another_ over possession of the one with a nicer bottom.

-   _Gorillaz's_ "DARE" features a giant head of Shaun Ryder kept on life support in Noodle's room; he starts singing when Noodle activates some of the machinery.

-   Dire Straits' "Money For Nothing" features two CGI appliance deliverymen who stand around gawking at music videos. One of them leans on a refrigerator and doesn't notice the fridge door swing open, and in a short time he's encased in a block of ice. The other guy decides the way to remedy this is to _put his co-worker's decapitated head in the microwave_. It seems to work as the next scene shows him restored and comfortably watching his TV at home.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology:
    -   Orpheus, according to Roman writer Ovid: his severed head continued to sing for a while after his murder.
    -   One of the Lernaean Hydra's heads was immortal. After Heracles chopped it off, he buried it under a boulder.
-   The Christian martyrology has Saint Denis (Bishop of Paris, executed by pagan Romans during the Imperial prosecutions) and Saint Solange (Mysterious Waif murdered by a nobelman who tried to abduct her). Both were beheaded, then their dead bodies just took their heads in their hands and walked away, praising the Lord until they reached the nearest towns and dropped dead there. In fact, Saint Denis is _always_ represented in media with his severed head in his own hands<small>◊</small>.
-   The Welsh have Saint Winefride, who was decapitated by a jealous suitor when she announced her intention to become a nun. Her head is said to have rolled down a hill, with a healing spring bursting forth where it stopped. If that's not enough, Winefride's uncle, Saint Beuno, then picked up the head and attached it to the body, bringing her back to life.
    -   Then the suitor melted, thus showing why you should never annoy saints.
-   Saint Quitteria was beheaded and thrown in the ocean. She is often depicted walking back out of the ocean with her head under her arm.
-   It's probably not a coincidence that many of cephalophoric saints (like the three aforementioned) come from Celtic or formerly Celtic lands like Gaul and Britain: Celtic myths have several examples of gods, heroes or giants whose heads continue to talk, drink or recite poems after having been severed.
-   As for Hinduism and Buddhism, there's the deity Chhinnamasta who severed her own head with her own sword just to feed her two attendants with her blood. Now that's hardcore.
-   Brazilian folklore has the headless mule, which has fire coming out of the stump - though it's described as "coming out of its nose"... and that it has a bridle tied to its mouth. A few versions reduce the Fridge Logic by saying the fire covers its head, not replaces it.
-   The _Arabian Nights_ story of King Yunan and Duban the Sage. Duban the Sage comes to the king's court when the king is very ill, and manages to save the king's life. However, an Evil Chancellor convinces the king to distrust the sage, and the sage is put to death. His head is able to speak after being cut off, reprimanding the king and eventually leading to the king's death also.
-   Mimir in Norse Mythology, as the wisest god. He was beheaded in the Aesir-Vanir War, but Odin used magic to preserve and revive the head, and it serves as his advisor.
-   From Egyptian Mythology, the sorcerer Naneferkaptah had to face a serpent both immune to magic and who had this ability as the Final Boss guarding the Book of Thoth. When standard freezing spells didn't work, Nefrekeptah went for the direct approach and cut off the serpent's head, and threw it far into the river. However, the head came back almost instantly and blocked his path again. Nefrekeptah again cut off its head, threw it into the river, and this time put sand on the neck before the head could come back. The head couldn't reattach, and though the serpent couldn't die, it just lay there, helpless.
-   In Japanese folklore there are monsters called Nukekubi; they seem like normal humans during the day, but in the night their head detaches from their bodies and starts to float around and search for a human victim to devour.
    -   Similar monsters are recorded in a number of East Asian countries, with perhaps the best-known being the Malaysian penanggalan.
-   Baba Deep Singh. The legend says that his head was cut completely or almost completely off and still was able to fight.
-   In the medieval Dutch ballad "Het lied van heer Halewijn" (the song of lord Halewijn), the evil Halewijn's head keeps talking after the heroine chops it off, asking her to blow on his horn to summon his friends, and to rub salve on his neck (the heroine refuses). Possibly justified because Halewijn is hinted not to be quite human.
-   Störtebeker, the legendary pirate of Hamburg. When he finally met his fate, he asked that all his mateys, which he could walk on by after his beheading, would be pardoned. His wish was granted, and when the executor saw that he really did it, he played unfair and tripped him.
-   Estonian folklore tells the story of Tõll, a giant who came to the aid of the Estonian people in a time of conflict, transporting soldiers en masse on giant wheels. During the subsequent battle, Tõll was decapitated and placed his own head on his sword. He then walked to his grave, promising to rise again in the event of another war against Estonia.

    Pinballs 

-   _Bone Busters_ has Ol' One-Eye, a disembodied skull who throws quips and jokes at the player.
-   Similarly, there's Skull the Bone Head in _No Fear: Dangerous Sports,_ who's strictly for the snark.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Dragon Dragon has survived despite losing his head in Chikara, due to him being a giant stuffed animal, that can somehow move and compete in matches.

    Recorded and Stand-Up Comedy 

-   This was the subject of one of Robert Schimmel's bits on _Robert Schimmel Comes Clean_:
    
    "I saw a plane crash on TV. The reporter says, 'Yeah, the plane crashed over here, decapitated this guy. He's apparently dead.' Good guess. No, the head's alive by itself. 'Psst! Over here, behind the bush!' What would you say if you saw something like that? 'Hey, are you okay?' 'I can't feel my legs!' 'Don't look down.' Well, what if your head lived for a minute after? It'd be weird to see some torso hopping around. 'Shit, lookit that!....Hey, that's MY shirt. Oh, fuck, my head's off. This is bad.'"
    

    Roleplay 

-   Mei from _AJCO_ can remove her head (among other limbs) and stitch it back on at will, due to being a zombie. She mostly does it to freak people out.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _Deadlands_ incarnation of Joaquin Murrieta died. He came back. Then, he got beheaded. Now, his (understandably insane) body's looking for his head, and is more than happy to "borrow" yours until he finds it. The best part? Undead Joachin Murrieta can only be stopped if you destroy his head. Happy hunting!
    -   In _Deadlands_ in general, this is what happens when you decapitate a Harrowed. The head is unfazed by the loss of the body and stays fully conscious, but helpless because of not having any arms or legs. A Harrowed can recover from this condition if someone kindly sews the head back on and feeds them some meat.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Trolls; anything cut off them, including heads, can live and will either reattach itself or regenerate. One of the Mystara supplements described trollish games, some of which involve using the head of one of the participants as a living football. Which tries to bite the feet that kick it.
    -   Unsurprisingly, the Ravenloft setting plays with this trope. Jacqueline Montarri is a headless NPC villain who steals the heads of women to wear, and has an enormous collection of decapitated _and still conscious_ female heads in her basement. (This is a curse, which she can only undo by finding her real head, which she has been looking for ever since she was executed by beheading centuries ago. To be blunt, as she will tell you, horrid fates like this will often befall those who cheat and murder members of the Vistani.)
    -   Lebendtod, a zombie-like undead template, can remove their heads and limbs at will.
-   _Exalted_ has an odd version of this from the dangerously powerful Charcoal March of Spiders supernatural martial art. The user delivers a punch so ludicrously hard that the head not only explodes, but the person whose head did explode has several seconds thereafter to think and react because they, and reality itself, haven't caught up to the fact just yet.
-   In _GURPS_ 3rd Edition, one of the supplements full of fantasy magic spells had a spell called Decapitate, which did exactly what its name says. Not only that, both the head and body were still alive, and since the head was still magically able to speak, if it knew any spells, it could still cast them! Of course, without the head, the body could not eat or drink, and would eventually die of dehydration or starvation. But this was not a problem either! Another spell allowed you to turn everything BUT the head into stone... and THEN you could decapitate him.
-   The Orks of _Warhammer 40,000_ are so tough that their severed heads can survive for up to an hour, more than enough time for a Mad Dok to easily attach it to a new body or just staple it back on.

    Theater 

-   In _Pippin_, Pippin has a poignant conversation with the head of a fallen Visigoth soldier. In a later scene, after Pippin has been crowned king, a headless man comes up to him and asks for his head to be reattached.
-   In a _Ravenloft_ skit performed at GenCon 1999, "One Piece at a Time", a lady surgeon attempts to bring her fiancée back to life after he dies in a tragic accident. The title says it all, but early scenes correspond to this trope. Sean Reynolds, playing the fiancée with his head stuck through a hole in a covered table, couldn't see the page of lines lying beside him. "I can't even hold a script!"

    Theme Parks 

-   In the safety video for _The Simpsons Ride_ at Universal Studios, Scratchy ends up decapitating himself while trying to lift the lap bar.

    Toys 

-   There are a couple non-canon moments of this in _BIONICLE_, usually for Rule of Funny:
    -   Very early storyboards for a planned promo animation of Tahu reassembling himself on the Ta-Wahi beach show him attaching his fallen-off head first.
    -   In the game _BIONICLE: Heroes_, it's a recurring theme, and every boss you defeat (apart from the final boss) is left as just a head at the end of the fight. Rule of Funny applies. There's also an Idle Animation where your character starts playing keepie uppie with its head.
    -   A gag video released online had Hahli Mahri's head popping off due to a rough submarine ride. It falls on her foot, causing much pain.

    Video Games 

-   This happens to Mutoid Man of _Smash TV_ as the next step after getting his arms blown off (causing a _bunch_ of heads to fly out), as well as his re-skin, The Host, who is fought at the end. In both cases, another head will be inside of the main body once that part's gone.
-   _Skeleton Warriors_ (PlayStation tie-in to the cartoon) have Prince Lightstar trolling Aracula after the boss fight, where in the following cutscene the defeated Aracula pulls himself together from a pile of bones, but Lightstar managed to snatch his skull away. Cue Aracula comically fumbling around to look for his cranium until Lightstar throws it down a corridor, and the headless Aracula running after it before hitting a wall.
-   _Spiritual Assassin Taromaru_ have two skeletal demons who has the ability to throw their heads as a ranged attack, before flying back to their necks. There's also a Karakuri puppet who, upon having her body destroyed, detaches her head and sends it floating around to continue the fight.
-   _Super Cyborg_ have a giant insect boss, the Flying Jarmai, who can continue fighting after you destroyed it's body, torso, abdomen, until it's a severed head sitting on the ground who then tries attacking you with it's Overly-Long Tongue.
-   Mimir, of _God of War (PS4)_. When Kratos and Atreus first meet him, he has been trapped in a tree for over a century by Odin. Since Mimir was Odin's advisor and ambassador to all nine realms, he has a wealth of knowledge about everything in them, and offers to share said knowledge with the pair in exchange for cutting off his head, and having the Witch in the Woods resurrect it. He spends the rest of the game dangling from Kratos' belt, acting as Mr. Exposition and occasionaly The Conscience.
-   In _Metroid Prime 2: Echoes_, Samus has to deal with the Quads, four-legged sentry robots that are built so that their bodies and heads can function independently of each other - if the body is destroyed, the head simply detaches and continues shooting, zipping back and forth via levitation. This trait also applies to their massive boss counterpart, Quadraxis.
-   Jenova was decapitated in the events leading to _Final Fantasy VII_. Sephiroth, realizing the jig is up (and unable to take the entire body with him), removed his "mother's" head on his way out of the Nibelheim mako reactor. However, he was waylaid by pre-amnesiac Cloud Strife and thrown from the connecting bridge, sinking into the pool of mako. The headless body of Jenova continues to live on - albeit in cryogenic suspension - waiting to be "reunited" with its missing parts.
-   In _Primal_, the Wraith can apparently survive being decapitated. A group of severed heads in Raum's torture chamber (all of whom hate each other) eventually take time out from arguing to help the PCs. One, however, calls the guards, simply to antagonize the rest.
    
    Other severed heads are scattered almost randomly throughout the upper mansion, giving comments, advice, and encouragement. One somehow knows Scree's name.
    
-   In _Animamundi Dark Alchemist_: The hero's little sister was beheaded, but still survived. Granted, by the game's universe rules, it was part of a "Test" - only witches can survive beheading.
-   In _Chrono Cross_ one skeleton character, which you have to assemble, starts off as a talking skull.
-   In _Resident Evil 3: Nemesis_, when you fight Nemesis in the Treatment Room. Douse him with a remarkable strong acid two times and his head will come off. But rather than die like the zombies, he continues attacking, albeit blind.
-   _Killer7_ has Susie, a severed head you tend to meet in very enclosed spaces (the first one being a washing machine). She always has a ring in her mouth when you find her. She's also a ghost. She's also completely loopy.
-   The _Monkey Island_ franchise is fond of this trope.
    -   In _The Secret of Monkey Island_, your guide through the Bloody Bowels of Hell is the preserved head of a navigator with an unerring sense of direction — the rest of his body was eaten by the Monkey Island cannibals. Big Bad LeChuck's undead first mate Bob is a skeletal ghost whose skull is constantly tipping off his spine — he misses the Wedding Finale when he drops it into the sea of lava in which their Ghost Ship is anchored.
    -   Murray the Mighty Demonic Skull in _The Curse of Monkey Island_. Justified in that he was actually dead and re-animated by spooky voodoo magic well before he became a disembodied skull. Originally intended to be a One-Scene Wonder who only appeared in the prologue, his appearance in the demo proved so popular with fans that the devs hurried to ensure he popped up a few more times in _Curse_ (he's the only character other than Guybrush, Elaine (technically), and LeChuck to appear in every chapter), made a cameo in _Escape from Monkey Island_, and even popped up again in one episode of _Tales of Monkey Island_.
-   A head in a jar is a "work of art" that you can purchase in the console version of _The Sims_.
-   Boomer in _Ballz_ throws his head as a special attack.
-   _Tekken 6_ has Alisa Boskonovitch who can remove her head and have it explode in front of her opponent. Of course, a new one emerges shortly after.
-   Kangaxx from _Baldur's Gate II_, when you first meet him was just a skull. Helps he's a lich who had been disassembled and this game was based on _Dungeons & Dragons_.
-   _Bladed Fury_ has a _headless_ demon as a boss, with it's cranium held in one hand. The lack of a noggin' doesn't stop it from attacking you however, the head will breath energy bolts on you while the hand raises and lowers to position where it's targeting.
-   Kratos in the _God of War_ games not only is able to tear off the head of the Gorgons, but proceed to use their (apparently still living) heads as weapons, petrifying enemies with their eye-beams. In the third game he does the same for the god Helios, using him as a Lantern.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   The Recapitator (skeleton enemies) in _Wario Land: Shake It!_ have their sole attack being to detach and throw their head at Wario like a boomerang, catching it afterwards. They also come back to life when killed like the Dry Bones in the main _Mario_ games, and can only permanently be killed by destroying their body while their head is in mid air. Or, if you're feeling saucy, destroy the head and leave the body hanging for awhile before it collapses into a heap.
    -   Broque Monsieur of the _Mario & Luigi_ games is shown in _Bowser's Inside Story_ and _Dream Team_ to be able to flip his head in the air<small>◊</small> in order to, of all things, _change his facial expression_.
-   PS1 RPG _Shadow Madness_ had a disembodied telekinetic head by the name of Xero von Moon. He was kept alive (and presumably afloat and able to speak) by a thin metal ring at his neck, and fought primarily with kinetic bolts (though he could resort to a headbutt).
-   In the first episode of _Xenosaga_, the functionally immortal Dragon Albedo is left in charge of a young hostage. So he _rips off his own head_, throws it at her feet, then spends a while like that mocking her fear (and making creepily suggestive puns in French) before **stomping it into paste**. Just to pass the time.
-   Morte, a floating skull and the resident Deadpan Snarker of _Planescape: Torment_. Morte didn't lose his head; it's right here. He also didn't lose his body, it's where he left it.
-   _Fear & Hunger_: Nas'hrah lost his body a long time ago. He's still perfectly capable of advanced magic even as a floating head, and is notably the only party member that can never die for good.
-   _Serious Sam_ has beheaded rocketeers, beheaded bombers, beheaded firecrackers and beheaded kamikazes. Former three carry their head with one hand while the latter doesn't have a head at all. Despite not having a head, the Beheaded Kamikazes can still _scream_. The scream of a kamikaze is one of the most recognizable (and feared) sounds in the game.
-   Played with regarding the beings known as the Headless from the _Ultima_ series. They are indeed quite headless and uninhibited by being such, but they are not some undead creature that originally suffered decapitation; they also have no place on their torso where a head would normally _go_, with only an empty patch of skin between their shoulders. It's a mystery even in-universe as to how they get around and make such dangerous enemies without any evident sensory organs.
-   Dr. Nefarious in robot mode gets his head knocked off by Qwark in one of the vid-comic sections in _Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal_. Horrible punning ensues.
-   When Captain Slag is defeated in _Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction_ his severed head talks to his first mate Rusty Pete for a full minute before losing power. In the DLC _Quest For Booty_ Rusty Pete continues to carry around Slag's head and use it as a ventriloquist dummy, until he finds a new body for Slag, and after Ratchet destroys _that_ body his head is shown still alive in the epilogue.
-   Although very loosely, _Dynamite Headdy_ surely counts as the main character throws his head around and switches it with power-ups. Not to mention it explodes when he dies and it gets replaced with a game over sign.
-   In _Left 4 Dead 2_, if you play a custom mutation called "Plague of the Dead" (which is the part of Rayman1103's Mutation Mod), theres a bug, if you decapitate a zombie with a melee weapon, sometimes there's a chance where the zombie still attack you while headless, hit it again will make him dead.
-   The main character of _Never Dead_, a game about an immortal gunslinger fighting a demonic invasion. Even if dismembered, he can put himself back together again. He loses his head (both figuratively and literally) in the first trailer. "My story was just getting interesting too!"
-   _Ninja Commando_ have this happening when you fight Lu Bu. As soon as you kill him, his head detaches, floats a little bit, gloats at you and transforms into a Chinese dragon with a new health bar - cue next stage of a Sequential Boss fight.
-   In _Vampire Savior_, Jedah has a move called Spregio that has him doing this to _himself_ and blasting the opponent with the resulting rush of blood!
-   This is the entire plot and gameplay gimmick of _Dead Head Fred_.
-   _Decap Attack_ is an NES platformer where you are Chuck D. Head, a mummy with a detachable head which you repeatedly fling at enemies to defeat them in various levels. Your head returns to you moments after being thrown.
-   Some enemies in _Unreal_ will feel for their head for moment after decapitation.
-   Several enemies from _Dead Space_ can remove Isaac's head, one will take over his body after his death. Instant decapitation results in Isaac feeling for his missing head for a second.
-   In _Avernum 3_, you can get a talking skull, which will shout random phrases at random times. One hilarious one goes: "Aragorn! Boromir! Come quick... Oh, never mind."
-   _Runescape_'s "A Clockwork Syringe" quest features a severed zombie pirate head, which the Player Character has to torture for information.
-   The original _Kung Fu Master_ has the Black Magician: any mid/high attack would result in his head falling off, and him teleporting back to reappear complete and unharmed.
-   In _Chariot: Adventures Through the Sky_, Final Boss Lar loses his entire body halfway through the Boss Fight, but he's got no problem keeping up with the Bullet Hell as a disemboweled head.
-   In the extremely bizarre _Samurai Zombie Nation_, you control the detached (and giant) head of the samurai Namakubi as you use Eye Beams and acid spit on zombies. Really.
-   Yet another Shoot 'Em Up example: Tripod Sardine from _G-Darius_. Once it takes enough damage, its head gets blown off. It still survives, though.
-   The player character in _The Incredible Crash Dummies_ can lose his head, resulting in reversed controls until you find a spare head.
-   In _Disney's Villains' Revenge_, Alice (of _Alice in Wonderland_ fame) actually gets beheaded and you have to travel a maze to find her head.
-   The boss Echizen in _Death Crimson OX_ has a head that I can only describe as an egg with a pair of giant red lips. Part one of the boss fight is fighting his kung-fu kicking body as his head continuously inflates. Part _two_ involves his head floating off of his body, then _splitting into six individual floating heads that then proceed to ram into you and shoot lasers at you_.
-   While inversions are also more common, in _The Binding of Isaac_, Pestilence and sometimes Gapers and Mr. Maws continue moving after losing their head.
-   A scene from the _Team Fortress 2_ promotional video Meet the Medic shows the head of the BLU Spy, which the RED Medic keeps in his fridge, being sustained by some eldritch and surely illegal medical technique involving dry-cell batteries.
-   _Skullgirls_ has Ms. Fortune, an undead catgirl who was chopped up into pieces by the mob after stealing and swallowing a gem that made her body undying. Her fighting style revolves around extending, detaching, and reattaching her limbs — most notably her head, which functions not only as a weapon but is capable of propelling itself around and attacking independently of her body.
-   Jet Headstrong had this power on _Defenders of Dynatron City_.
-   In _Lollipop Chainsaw_, after Nick is bitten by a zombie Juliet decides to save him by chopping off his head and preserving it with a magic ritual of some sort. He's not exactly happy about the situation but Juliet thinks that it is just _awesome_ that her boyfriend is now a talking head.
    
    **Nick:** How am I still talking... _without a FUCKING THORAX?!_
    
-   In the "Test Your Luck" game in _Mortal Kombat 9_, one of the results causes both fighters to fight the next match _headless_. The worst thing about this is, neither player can use X-Ray moves; exactly how bad it is otherwise depends on what fighter you're using. (For many, it's not much else, but for a few, it can be very hindering. It's the most debilitating for Kung-Lao, seeing as half his moves and almost _all_ his Fatalities require his hat.)
    -   In _Mortal Kombat X_, this is the fate of Shinnok at the hands of Dark Raiden, because he is an Elder God and cannot die. In one of the stages of _Mortal Kombat 11_, his severed and still living head is on display.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   From the series' backstory comes Pelinal Whitestrake, the legendary 1st Era hero of mankind/racist berserker. Believed to have been a Shezarrine, physical incarnations of the spirit of the "dead" creator god Lorkhan (known to the Imperials as "Shezarr"), Pelinal came to St. Alessia to serve as her divine champion in the war against the Ayleids. When Alessia and her army was too struck with fear to attack the White-Gold Tower occupied by Ayleid leader Umaril the Unfeathered, Pelinal charged in himself and defeated (though could not kill) Umaril before he himself was slain. His body was cut into eight pieces by the Ayleids to mock the Eight Divines. His head was left behind and discovered by Morihaus, with whom he had one final conversation that is now lost to history.
    -   A Good Bad Bug in _Skyrim_ sometimes causes enemies beheaded mid-sentence to continue a taunt after decapitation. The game doesn't stop the sound file when the enemy dies, resulting in a disembodied voice for a second or so.
-   The Skelterwild Dream Eater in _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_ has a tendency to do this whenever it receives a hit strong enough to make it stagger. This is by no means a good thing (unless it's your friend), as it causes the head and body to attack in tandem by using ice breath and by ramming respectively.
-   In _Grim Fandango_, Salvador Limones gets reduced to a talking skull. Sure, he was Dead to Begin With, but the rest of the skeleton, which you have to find later, is _not_ animated, implying that the head is still the part that holds one's consciousness, even after death. Even as a skull, Sal manages to perform a Heroic Sacrifice by spitting Sproutella into the face of a character who betrayed him, thus rendering both of them Deader than Dead.
-   The Evil King/Witch Doctor in _Wonder Boy/Adventure Island_ loses his head each time you defeat him, only to have it replaced by an uglier mug.
-   Sekibanki of _Touhou Project_, a Rokurokubi with some Dullahan motifs mixed in. She has the ability to make her head fly off independently from her body. ZUN mentioned in his music notes for her theme music that he wasn't sure if the Rokurokubi was the Youkai that could stretch their neck or if it was the youkai that could detach their head (a possible Shout-Out to Lafcadio Hearn who mentioned in his book that people misidentify the Nukekubi for a Rokurokubi), so he gave her both powers.
-   One rather disturbing scene in the anime of _Umineko: When They Cry_ features Maria's head on a platter. Laughing psychotically and daring Rosa to eat her.
-   Some zombies in _Doom³_ have lost their heads, leaving only the lower jaw and below still attached. The game code even refers to them as "neckstump". The lack of head or brain does not hinder them in the slightest, which makes sense, and they can even make the same grunts and moans as zombies with heads. This only affects civilian zombies, however - Z-secs, zombified security forces and marines that wield weapons and behave like actual humans in a firefight, are unaffected.
-   Played for Laughs in _LEGO Island_. The island's inhabitants, being made of LEGOs, can easily survive decapitation:
    -   The opening cinematic has the ambulance have a tow truck crash into it, and the patient's head gets knocked off into the road. The ambulance driver just picks up the head, chucks it into the back of the ambulance, and gets back behind the wheel.
    -   An encounter in the residential area has a character get his head knocked off by a passing truck. The head starts _directing the body to try and pick it up_.
        
        "Hey, I'm over here! To my left! Er, your left! Er, _our_ left!" _(body walks towards head)_ "Right." _(body goes right)_ "Not 'go right,' 'correct'!" _(body kicks head)_ "It's not a soccer game! Use your brain! Oh, I guess ... that's over here." _(body kicks head again)_ "Ow! Just bend down slowly and—" _(body kicks head high into the air and it lands on the neck)_ "He shoots, he scores! _OW!_"
        
-   In _Ogre Battle_, you can recruit Pumpkins (men with pumpkins for heads) into your army, who attack by _tearing off their own heads_, kicking them into the air, whereupon they grow to huge size and _land_ on an enemy, halving their HP (or killing undead units outright) unless they miss. If you upgrade them to a Hallowe'en, they can do it twice a fight!
-   In _Office Zombie_, you can cut the Zombie's head off with a couple of items. When you throw it back, he'll stick it back on his neck and be good as new.
-   Vengarl of Forossa from _Dark Souls II_ was a brutish, bloodthirsty mercenary until he got decapitated in a fierce battle... and woke up as a disembodied undead head. Ironically, he learned to enjoy his newfound peace, spending his time watching the forest, thinking and occasionally talking with random travellers. His only concern is that his headless body still is rampaging somewhere else.
    -   The Earthen Peak area is populated mostly by headless, magically animated mannequins. The boss of said area, Mytha the Baneful Queen, tore off their heads for 'daring to gaze upon her'. Mytha herself is a half-woman-half-snake, also beheaded, who carries her head in her left hand and uses it as a sorcery catalyst, and occasionally as a magic grenade.
-   _Chivalry: Medieval Warfare_'s "Black Knight" Game Mod makes decapitations (and other severed bits and pieces) non-lethal, allowing for a headless, armless knight to run around kicking people to death.
-   In the reboot of _Shadow Warrior_, Xing, one of the Ancients, lost his head on the order of Enra, the leader of the Shadow Realm, for conspiring with Hoji to poison their sister and try to overthrow him. But because Xing is an Ancient, an immortal demon that cannot be killed except with the Nobitsura Kage, being decapitated is just an inconvenience to him. You encounter his head late in the game, when you journey to the Shadow Realm to rescue Hoji and stop him from creating a Whisperer of you and sacrificing his memories of you, and he proves to be quite the amiable and chatty fellow.
-   In _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_, when HK-47 is describing his history of enacting assassination protocols against Jedi, he notes their love of sending his limbs and head flying with their Laser Blade, which he describes as "an inconvenience".
-   The _Quest for Glory_ series has Bonehead, Baba Yaga's gatekeeper. He's a talking skull animated by _some_ form of magic, though little else is elaborated on.
-   In _Headlander_, you wake up in the future with no body and must make do with a space helmet that comes equipped with rockets and the ability to attach to various robot bodies.
-   In one of _Spirit Hunter: NG's_ Bad Ends, Kaoru is decapitated. Not only do they remain alive for a minute, but they're even capable of holding a conversation over a phone, something that they recognize should be impossible.
-   _Dragon's Crown_:
    -   Skeleton enemies will lose their head if you damage them enough but they will still fight in this state. However, since they no longer have eyes to see with, they'll mainly run around randomly while flailing their sword wildly.
    -   The Warrior Monk you meet in the Forgotten Sanctuary is injured by a Hell Hound's head that continued to bite down on her leg even after it was decapitated.

    -   Igos du Ikana from _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_ attaches and reattaches his head to attack Link during the fight against him. Once he and his Skull Knights are defeated and their bodies disintegrated using reflected sunlight, their incorporeal spirits are represented by the same floating skulls.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda Oracle of Seasons_, a skeletal Piratian had his entire body destroyed except for his skull. Link must carry his skull so the Piratian can help locate the bell his Captain was looking for.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, attacking the body of a Stal creature will just cause the head and body to separate. It can only be defeated if Link destroys the head... but if there are any _other_ Stal creatures of the same type, any head can reaffix to any matching body, leaving the bodies to attack Link until all heads are destroyed. Fortunately, all Stal heads will die from a single blow from _any_ weapon, even if still attached to the body.
-   Ed in _Ben and Ed_ can have his head cut off, or he can even detach it himself, and will still be able to continue the level albeit with less maneuverability. Alternatively, he can just reattach it to his body. Justified in that Ed is a zombie.

He later appears in other installments of _Madou_, and his decapitation is never mentioned again.
-   The second _Garfield's Scary Scavenger Hunt_ game has a part where the player can open the fridge to find the severed head of Orson Pig from _U.S. Acres_. Unlike Lyman's severed head shown in the same game, Orson appears to be still alive in spite of his beheading, as he says to Garfield "Watch out for sneaky mice!"
-   _Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice_ has the Guardian Ape fight. At the climex, Sekiro uses the sword lodged in the Guardian Ape's neck to decapitate him. This gets you a "Shinobi Execution" screen. After a few seconds, however, the boss gets back up, retrieving his head with one hand and the sword with his other, becoming the Headless Ape.
-   Chicken from _Nuclear Throne_ gets decapitated when losing all her health, but can temporarily survive (like a real chicken) long enough to potentially regain some health, reattaching her head.
-   In _Castlevania_, Dracula's head pops off his body when you reduce his health to zero, only for him to reveal a more powerful form right afterward.
-   _Death Stranding_ has the skeleton soldiers under Cliff's command who are capable of fighting even after their heads are shot off. This immunity doesn't apply, however, if you sneak up behind them and decapitate them with the Strand.
-   _Pajama Sam 3: You Are What You Eat From Your Head To Your Feet_: If you help Mickey fix his comedy routine, his final joke causes the audience to literally laugh their heads off. They're fine since they're all Anthropomorphic Food.
-   Agon from _Brutal Orchestra_ is holding his severed head above his body, and still feels pain from it (if Played for Laughs) judging by his frequent Overly Long Screams
-   _A Bite at Freddy's_: Talkshow Freddy is fended off by activating a fan in an air vent, but deploying it at the wrong time can slice off his head. Freddy responds to his decapitation by becoming much more aggressive in his attempts to enter the office.

    Web Comics 

-   In _Another Princess Story_, during one Halloween storyline, Roya finds Eliza and Beth after their heads have been removed from their bodies by a headless, ax-wielding woman, who can do the same to Roya. The headless bodies are still capable of some level of sentience and the disembodied heads lose their eye colors until they're attached to a body, causing them to gain the eye color of the body's original head (and in the case of the rider, her sharp teeth).
-   Happened in _Bite Me!_ via _guillotine_; her head was later located by the main character being asked to list head puns (in a room full of severed heads) until she groaned loudly enough to be found.
-   Most of the _Boneheads_ are able to take off their heads and be perfectly fine, being undead skeletons and the like. Three of the Boneheads perform while holding their skulls in their hands. This comes as a shock to Sans and Papyrus, who _can't_ just take off their heads. Poor Papyrus thought he killed Brook by accidentally knocking off his head before Jack assured him Brook was fine.
-   In _Commander Kitty_, CK ends up in pieces after a Teleporter Accident, with his still-talking head landing inside a toolbox. Fortunately for him, it seems he just needs someone to snap him back together like a LEGO minifig.

-   _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_: "You would be amazed how difficult it is to aim when your head is in a box across the room."

-   In the _Girls in Space_ storyline The Prototype, Fergus Macrumble punches the Henchbot's head off.
-   Nostrom in _Jack_ has a habit of switching his head between a bunch of bodies after he goes to hell. And he keeps his bodies' original heads in a jar where they're constantly begging people to kill them.
-   Done in _Khatru_, where Healing Factor powered Ranger unwittingly agrees to test one of Gadgeteer Genius Kira's medical scanning devices. She tries everything to fix him, but in the end, he recovers all on his own.
-   Ashley Yakamura from _Light and Dark_ can detach her head, along with other parts of her body.

As revealed in "Bellows" and "Rise of the Funsnake" Morag's body was eaten by the funworm, a demon god disguised as group of men in a cheap parade costume. She now needs somebody to blow into her neck to talk because nobody understood that one blink meant "yes" and two meant "no".
-   In _Slightly Damned_ the third head of Cerberus seems to be perfectly fine with just being a skull/living headgear for Darius. This is a temporary punishment for insufficient vigilance, that dragged out far longer than expected.
-   Happens to Xykon in _The Order of the Stick_.
    -   And also to the Eye of Fear and Flame, which was kept by Belkar until it decided death was better than living (well, undying) as an immobile skull with _Belkar_ as a master.

-   _Questionable Content_ had an Imagine Spot featuring Penelope vomiting a rainbow mixed with Cheshire Cat Grin.
-   In _Rusty and Co._, decapitation does not work on the vampires.
-   Happens from time to time in _Schlock Mercenary_. The level of medical technology available in the series allows _entire bodies_ to be regrown so long as the head remains intact. Der Trihs spent quite a few strips as a head in a jar, as have most of the cast. Karl Tagon once spent an arc as a head in a jar as well. Attached to a _headless monkey_ he was able to control, and _still_ kicked a ton of ass doing it.
-   Probably the single most infamous comic from _Sexy Losers_ involved Shiunji, a necrophiliac, a corpse whose head fell off, and what he did to its neck. The comic's subtitle read "I am certain that at some point in the future, I will be prosecuted for this comic in a court of law."

-   _Stubble Trouble_ features the decapitated characters of Gynette the spidertaur and Lilith the Headless Goth Vixen.

    Web Original 

-   _Athyrmagaia_ has the Athyrmatherians, alien creatures which resemble familiar Earth animals like lions, gazelles and wildebeest: except that the head, thorax, abdomen and rump of each Athyrmatherian is a _separate animal_ of its own, having metamorphosed from four separate sibling larvae that then proceeded to unite at adulthood. As such, heads can detach from the bodies and survive for a while separated: which becomes a tactic of a predator group called headhunters that finish their prey by detaching the head zooid and devouring the still-living head, before moving onto the incapacitated body.
-   Happens in short film called _changing head_.
-   In "Deadpool: The Musical," Deadpool demonstrates that he's "especially good at _decapitating!_" by removing a mook's head via katana, and the severed head sings in response: "Heads roll for Deadpool!"

-   In _Less is Morgue_, Brains Vincent survives as a severed head after Riley eats his body.
-   The YouTube series _Some Assembly Required_ is all about this.
-   A short film called _Halloween Party_ has its main character be a guy who can detach his head like a toy.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_: In the magic-themed episode "Vanishing Act", Cindy Vortex, Carl Wheezer, Sheen Estevez and Betty Quinlan, become floating heads when they enter a strange dimension and look for their headless bodies. Once they enter a picture of a desert, they find their headless bodies are searching around the desert feeling the ground for them. They reattach their heads to their bodies and act like nothing happened (except Sheen, whose head is on backwards).
-   _Aladdin: The Series_ has a villain named Kapok whose evil head is separated from his kind body. Interestingly, his head thinks with his mind, but his body thinks with his heart. Aladdin even gets inflicted with the same curse during the episode. Don't worry, he gets better.
-   Sarah from _The Amazing World of Gumball_ removes her head every night before she goes to sleep and puts it in the freezer.
-   _Animaniacs_:
    -   The Warners exhibit this ability.
    -   In one short, "Moon over Minerva", a smitten Minerva Mink's head turns into a balloon because of her pounding heart and starts to float away before she catches it and hastily reattaches it.
-   _Arthur_:
    -   In "Meek for a Week", Arthur and his friends imagine Francine, who has recently taken to bottling up her natural aggression, will build up enough pressure that her head will pop off. We then see an Imagine Spot of just such happening with Francine's disembodied head complimenting the beautiful lawn she just landed in.
    -   Similarly, a different episode has Buster's head fly away instead, only his head breaks into pieces upon landing.
-   Absorbing Man after his battle with the Hulk in _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_.
-   _The Batman_: In "The Joining, Part 1", Batman and J'onn J'onzz are able to interrogate the severed head of Lucius Fox's robot duplicate. "In order to nod, you need a neck."
-   This happens to the titular character several times in _Beetlejuice_, perhaps most unfortunately when he falls in with a group of headhunters. (In one episode, this actually causes his head and body to argue with each other, his body doing so by forming a mouth with its hand.)
-   The titular character in _Bunnicula_ has had his head knocked off or intentionally removed it to mess with Chester the cat on a few occasions, he can just stick it back on like it's nothing due to his supernatural abilities.
-   XR in _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ is prone to this.
-   In _The Cleveland Show_, this happens to Rallo after he runs with scissors.
    
    **Rallo's severed head:** Little help?
    
-   _Clone High_ has this happen, quite unsurprisingly, to the clone of Marie-Antoinette. In the second-to-last episode, she is decapitated by a helicopter. In the last episode, she appears alive and well, or at least as well as a girl whose head is no longer attached to her shoulders can be.
-   _Courage the Cowardly Dog_:
    -   In one episode, Courage, Eustace and Muriel have their heads chopped off by the Windmill Vandals' weapons (with their headless bodies frantically feeling around for their lost heads) and end up on each other's bodies. Courage's head (transplanted on Muriel's body) even uses Eustace's complaining head as a bowling ball to momentarily topple the marauders.
    -   Moreover, this isn't the first time Eustace has lost his head. In an earlier episode, a space chicken that Courage defeats and leaves featherless and headless in the pilot episode returns to replace its missing head by using Courage's head as a replacement. It only partially succeeds with its plan, taking Eustace's head instead. Although defeated, the head never returns to its original body (at least until the next episode), culminating with the appearance of a headless walking Eustace that scares Courage.
    -   Eustace loses his head again in "Mega Muriel the Magnificent" when Courage's computer temporarily takes over his body and accidentally hits a wall while running, causing Eustace to collapse part-by-part. His disembodied head then spends the remainder of the episode watching the possessed Muriel's death-defying stunts on TV, oblivious to the fact that he no longer has a body.
-   In _The Crumpets_, Ditzy's head is detachable, and with its lightness and string, it floats and looks like a balloon. Both the head and body can function on their own. The string can secure her head to the body by a tied knot. Her head can come off by force or surprise. There is an episode where her head is unable to float.
-   _DC Animated Universe_:
    -   Mr. Freeze is reduced to a disembodied head that can detach from his robotic body to move on mechanical spider legs by the _Batman: The Animated Series_ episode "Cold Comfort". In a Continuity Nod, when he shows up again in the _Batman Beyond_ episode "Meltdown", all that's left is his head. He's understandably not too happy about it. Early drafts for _Beyond_ played this for Black Comedy, with Old Man Wayne keeping the head in his refrigerator. It curses him impotently whenever he opens the door.
    -   Mr. Mxyzptlk in his debut episode of _Superman: The Animated Series_ at one point removes his own head, which then regrows his body. Of course, he _is_ a Reality Warper.
-   In _Dilbert_, the villainous Lena decapitates her business rivals and keeps their heads in jars, where they are somehow still alive and able to talk. Notably, when Dilbert discovers one of these heads, he speaks to it first, as if he expects it to be able to answer. Lena suffers this same fate herself by the end of the episode.
-   _Drawn Together_: Toot's body manages to flash her boobs at Xandir after she chops her head off in the first episode.

    -   Another cutaway in the episode "Hefty Shades of Gray" shows what it was like for Chris to get off sugar; when Peter asks him for the syrup at breakfast, Chris violently rips off his head in response. Meg laughs at Peter in this state, and in retaliation, he commands his body to throw mashed potatoes at her. At the end of the episode, Lois also rips Peter's head off when he tells her that the Griffins are joining the Trump administration.
-   Scared Stiff, the ghost robot in _Filmation's Ghostbusters_, suffers from this.
-   An episode of _Flash Gordon (1979)_ features a race of aliens who can remove their heads.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   The Heads in Jars combine this with Brain in a Jar. It's eventually revealed to be a form of limited time travel, creating a tiny bubble in which the heads are perpetually in the time period during which they were alive.
    -   Bender frequently suffers this, at least once as a Shout-Out to _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. In "A Head in the Polls", he purposely sells his body for lots of money (it's worth more due to supply and demand). He drives around in a little car until getting it back from President Nixon. He also uses his ability to detach his head to (what else?) rob people.
    -   In "Put Your Head on My Shoulder", Fry has his head surgically removed and placed on Amy's shoulder after being severely injured in a car accident.
    -   This happens to Hermes in _Bender's Big Score_. Somehow, he manages to keep yelling at people for several minutes after being decapitated, before he's put in a jar.
    -   In _Bender's Game_, Zoidberg's head crawls on tentacles once it's been severed from his body. Since that instance took place in Bender's fantasy world it's not certain if the real Zoidberg can do it as well.
    -   This happens to the Professor in the video game when Mom decapitates his head to use his brain in her plot against his will.
-   _Gadget and the Gadgetinis_: Fidget gets his head bitten off by a tiger at one point in the episode "Claw's Collection". The tiger spits it out, none the worse for wear, a moment later, leading Fidget to pop it back on.
-   _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_:
    -   Grim is frequently hit with this trope.
    -   In an episode parodying "The Fly", Mandy unzips her head and accidentally zips onto a fly's body.
    -   Grim inflicts this on Jack O'Lantern, a one-episode villain from the Halloween special. Justified in that he had wished for immortality before he was decapitated.
-   _The Incredible Crash Dummies_ seem to spend a lot of time without their heads (or arms or legs) attached.
-   _Jimmy Two-Shoes_: This happens to Heloise in the episode "Heads Will Roll", thanks to Dr. Scientist trying to obstruct her from entering Miseryville's Annual Mad Scientist Awards. Both her head and body were able to operate relatively well on their own, with the former managing to somehow build a vehicle out of sticks and stones to get to the awards and Dr. Scientist in time.
-   _Kaeloo_: This happens to Quack Quack the duck, who is indestructible and can't be killed, almost Once an Episode.
-   _Kevin Spencer_: Kevin fantasizes about this in one episode: he imagines himself living in an old age home as a head, refusing to die. The staff decide to just run him over with a car. This trope is played with in the final episode, with Percy.
-   In the Canadian short _Land of the Heads_, a headless vampiress forces his husband to go out into the village and collect the heads of younger people to replace her old and wrinkled one.
-   In the Canadian short "La Salla", after a man's head is knocked off, it rolls around the floor singing, while the headless body lumbers around looking for it. Of course, the main character losing his head isn't the only thing that makes this screwy.
-   In a particularly bizarre episode of _Legion of Super Heroes (2006)_, on their way to Find the Cure!, Brainiac 5's head is separated from his body by a Portal Cut; the body then proceeds to run amok while the frustrated Legionnaires try to recapture it.
-   In the _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_ Halloween Episode "Spooky", the episode's titular experiment scares Mertle Edmonds and her posse by shapeshifting to appear as Lilo (in her dead hula girl costume from earlier in the episode) with her head detached from her body.
-   Dr. Pretorious from _The Mask_ has heavily modified his body, including allowing his head to be detached from his body and move around on spider legs. Unfortunately, this tends to work against him, as his opponents tend to take advantage of this and knock his head off to distract him during his plans. His body can move independently on its own.
-   _Mega Man (Ruby-Spears)_: At the beginning of "The Incredible Shrinking Mega Man", Mega says "don't lose your head" to a disassembled Roll.
-   _Metalocalypse_: Mashed Potato Johnson, the oldest living blues guitarist, educates Deathklok on the music, relateing several gruesome stories on the origins of songs, including one Shorty Johnnytop, who made a deal with the Devil and was hit by a train — "...as his head traveled in the air, he wrote 'Blue Train Blues'."
-   Jenny from _My Life as a Teenage Robot_ has this happen occasionally.
-   Unsurprisingly happens a few times in _Nightmare Ned_'s many Nightmare Sequences:
    -   In "Headless Lester", Ned has a run-in with the eponymous campfire-story creep and afterwards walks back to his cabin, whereupon his constantly giggling head topples off his body after his worried cabin counselor grabs him by the shoulders. Notably, and a bit ironically, this was in the one episode of the series wherein the obligatory nightmare wasn't actually being had by Ned.
    -   In "A Doll's House", this happens to Ned when he drives a toy car down his house's stairs in an attempt to escape his (now giant to him) cousins. His cousins "fix" the broken "dolly" by sticking Ned's head on a cheerleader doll, much to Ned's chagrin.
-   In the _Oggy and the Cockroaches_ episode "It's Been a Hard Day's Noise", Oggy gets this after repeatedly opening and shutting a door. Proof here.
-   _Oswald the Lucky Rabbit_ demonstrates the ability to attach and detach his head at will, with no justification other than the Rule of Funny. It is unclear how well he can function headless, as in two cases, his head doesn't get very far, and in the third, he's reassembled by outside means. A post-Disney short indicates that other characters in the setting can do this too.
-   _The Owl House_: In the very first episode, Eda gets her head cut off by Warden Wrath. Luz is horrified, but thankfully Eda is still alive (though she does complain that losing her head is rather uncomfortable and inconvenient).
-   _The Patrick Star Show_: Patrick can safely remove his head from his body, which gets used for a couple of jokes.
    -   In "The Patterfly Effect", Patrick's head detaches from his body. It runs wild around the house until Bunny calms it down with some breakfast. Squidina brings his head back into the kitchen while the body is trying to eat.
    -   In "Blorpsgiving", a wedding ceremony would involves both parties' heads being torn off their bodies to be refit into fancy clothes; harmless to Inga-Tron, but it would kill Quasar. Patrick, feeding popcorn into his severed head, casually comments, "I don't see what the big deal is."
-   In one _Robot Chicken_ sketch, the Crypt Keeper tries to find a new job after his show is canceled, but when he finds one he's quickly fired for disrespecting his manager. Following this, his wife leaves him, which drives him to suicide. When he tries to hang himself, his head pops off.
-   Scaramouche the assassin android from _Samurai Jack_ is seemingly killed in the first episode of Season 5, his head being the only part of him that survived. Five episodes later, it reboots, and he hops off to go tell Aku that Jack has lost his sword. As a head, though, he becomes prime Butt-Monkey material, being kicked and tossed around by people and denied entrance to a ship due to his lack of a body.
-   _Seven Little Monsters_: Seven, the youngest of the titular monsters, is able to survive removing his own head.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Scratchy from _The Itchy and Scratchy Show_ loses his head tons of times thanks to Itchy. Whether he lives or dies from it seems to vary.
    -   One Couch Gag has the Simpsons switching heads. This was repeated in the Season 2 DVD artwork.
    -   In "Treehouse of Horror IV", Homer is decapitated while spending a day in Hell.
    -   Homer's costume (which becomes real) in "Treehouse of Horror XVI".
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_
    -   Man Ray's head is removable, as shown in his first appearance in "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III" when he takes it off and gives it to SpongeBob when he literally can't show his face in Bikini Bottom anymore. When he later appears in "Shuffleboarding", he weaponizes this by throwing his head at SpongeBob while fighting him and Patrick at the laundromat, only for it to fly into a washer and shrink because it's dry clean only.
    -   In "Squid Noir", Patrick throws a rock at Squidward, thinking that he's being attacked by a monster when he's actually playing his clarinet. The rock pins Squidward's head to a wood mount on his wall, leaving him without a head.
    -   Patrick's head harmlessly popping off his body for whatever reason is something of a Running Gag in the show (especially in post-sequel era). For example, in "Escape from Beneath Glove World", when Patrick finds out that the Hieronymus Glove robot literally wants Patrick's head, Patrick nonchalantly removes his head from his shoulders and gives it to him.

-   In the _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ episode "Game of Flags", Star's Uncle Lump was decapitated during the Game of Flags at last year's family reunion, but they managed to save his head and attach it to the body of a horse. Later in the episode Uncle Lump's head bounces in from off-screen, still alive but incredibly annoyed that he lost another body.
-   _Steven Universe_: In the Crossover episode "Say Uncle", When Belly Bag explains who Uncle Grandpa is, it makes Steven's and the Gems' heads float off their bodies and orbit the Earth. Pearl is understandably freaked out by this, she feels to make sure her head is back on her body where it belongs and then proceeds to Faint in Shock; Amethyst freaks out because her head reattaches backwards, and Garnet visibly shudders after being frozen in an uncomfortable expression. Steven takes it a lot better, giving Uncle Grandpa a fist bump when they come back.
-   _SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron_ has this in the episode "Metal Urgency": the Metallikats are reduced to heads scuttling around on spider legs after their bodies are crushed. This doesn't prevent them from driving the Metallikat Express _or_ operating a pair of gigantic combat robots.
-   In _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_, Leonardo cuts off the Shredder's head in a Single-Stroke Battle. This would have been more effective if the Shredder wasn't actually an alien inhabiting a much larger robot body.
-   In the _Teen Titans (2003)_ episode "Fractured", Larry briefly makes little wings grow on Starfire's head, causing it to fly off of her body and needing to hold onto it to avoid it flying away.
-   _Tex Avery MGM Cartoons_:
    -   The outlaws in the short "Deputy Droopy".
    -   This happens to Spike/Butch in the short "Darevil Droopy" when he tries to sabotage the "Test Your Strength" Game for Droopy.
-   _The Tick_: In a time-travel episode, the Tick has his head momentarily teleported, minus his body, onto a golf tee in the 1950s. He loudly declares "Men in plaid!" at the sight of the golfers.
-   Happens in _Tiny Toon Adventures_ in the short "Born to be Riled" when Babs does an impersonation of Shirley Loon.
-   _The Tofus_: This happens to Mrs. Tofu in the episode "The Great Escape" when Mr. Tofu performs a magic trick that ends up resulting in her head being teleported to a nearby box via magic while her now headless body is clearly seen still standing in the larger box.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   Megatron, Bulkhead, Sentinel Prime, Starscream and Waspinator have all suffered from this in _Transformers: Animated_.
    -   As does Optimus Prime in _Transformers: Generation 1_. Unicron gets reduced to a head after his body is blown up, and he's incredibly dangerous whenever he regains consciousness.
    -   All of the Headmasters have this as their backstory. (To summarize, the future Headmasters were a subgroup of Autobot pacifists called the Nebulans who were sickened by the conflict, and as a result had little trust for any other resident of Cybertron. to gain trust, five Autobots removed their heads and offered them to the Nebulans to earn trust. Later, the Nebulans could no longer avoid the war, but were still unwilling to trust the headless Autobots enough to reassemble them, so as compromise, they used special technology on five of their own, so they could become the heads, working with the five Autobots in a symbiotic bond. Each Nebulon controls the body, while its partner's true head — which is hidden somewhere — maintains telepathic communication while providing fighting skills and advice. Unfortunately, it isn't long before the Decepticons learn how to do this too.) Also, Arcee becomes a "new" Headmaster in the finale of the series, the same deal as the others.
    -   Waspinator in _Beast Wars_, several times. In fact, numerous characters, primarily Predacons, end up in pieces, including an intact head. Silverbolt is the only Maximal who suffered this indignity while serving as a Maximal.

-   _Viva Piñata_ has this as a mild inconvenience. It happens to Dr. Quackberry in "Party Parasite".
-   The _What If…? (2021)_ episode "What If... Zombies?!" has this happen to Scott Lang. Since Hank Pym's attempt to save Janet van Dyne from the Quantum Realm ended with Janet becoming Patient Zero to a Zombie Apocalypse in this universe, Hope assumed that Scott had died with the others. Until the group makes it to Vision's stronghold and discover he made a cure for the zombie plague; while reduced to a head in a jar, Scott is alive and well thanks to cure testing. He even takes the time to make a lot of head puns at his situation.

-   Happened in the _YTV_ block _ZAPX Movies_ to Simon Mohos during one of the program blocks that happened between the scene from Beetlejuice mentioned above and the commercial break, where his head was lying on the floor calling for his headless body which was seen searching for his head in the background.

    Real Life 

-   A series of controversial experiments by Robert White showed that it is possible to transplant a monkey's head onto a different monkey's body, although establishing spinal communication between the two was not possible. Originally proposed by the surgeon as a means of prolonging the lives of quadriplegics whose own bodies are failing, this technique has been soundly rejected by bioethicists... not because it's gruesome, but because donor organs can save more lives if they're distributed among many transplant patients, rather than the whole body being used to aid one.
-   Mike the headless chicken was a chicken who survived a full two years after his owner tried to chop his head off and slaughter him for supper. The axe had missed one of Mike's ears and most of his brain stem, and a clot in his jugular vein prevented him from bleeding out. For all intents and purposes, Mike didn't notice that he was missing the top half of his head, and behaved like any other chicken; he could still walk around, albeit clumsily, and would try to peck the ground for food, preen himself, and crow. Mike's owner toured the country with him for the next two years, watering him with an eyedropper and feeding him worms and small grains of corn. Mike finally passed away in a motel room after choking on some corn, and his caretakers left Mike's cleaning syringes behind at the previous sideshow and couldn't save him.
-   Tapeworms. Their head, known as the _scolex_, is all the tapeworm really needs to live, while the rest of the body, consisting of segments called _proglottids_, are just merely reproductive organs that in fact break away from the body to release its eggs. As such, tapeworm removal is very difficult, as even if the entire length of the body is removed, if the head remains, it will just grow an entire new body.
-   Cockroaches can live for weeks after decapitation. They will eventually starve to death because they can't eat without their mouth.
-   Back in the days where Losing Your Head was a punny way of saying "capital punishment", some curious people (again, we can't tell you who or when) did a series of experiments which basically consisted of waiting until the next execution, then shouting at the head to see whether and for how long they could keep its attention. The head can stay conscious for 10 seconds or so, though most lost consciousness instantly due to shock. We can thank the French for this information, since they kept using the guillotine for executions until the 20th century.
-   When Charlotte Corday was executed via guillotine, a man named Legros disrespectfully picked up her head and slapped it across the face. According to witnesses, her face, which had been peaceful, briefly reacted and turned indignant. Legros was arrested for his actions.
-   _Internal_ decapitation, in which the skull is forcibly separated from the spinal column but the soft tissues of the neck remain intact, can be survivable if the injured person receives artificial respiration and other care. If the spinal cord isn't broken, a full recovery is also possible.
-   A male praying mantis can survive for a short time after decapitation. The female has a tendency to bite his head off, and this feature allows the male to finish mating before he dies.
-   Some snakes, particularly rattlesnakes, can react to their surroundings and bite up to an hour after decapitation.
    -   A Chinese chef was bitten and killed by a cobra AFTER he had chopped its head off and was about to dispose of it.
-   A scientific study showed that a type of sea slug known as _Elysia_ is able to decapitate _itself_ to rid its body of parasites (by getting rid of its entire body). It's probably able to survive because it's also a partly photosynthetic slug, and can sustain itself on photosynthesis long enough for its body to regenerate in a few weeks.
-   The ocean sunfish (_Mola mola_) and its close relatives _look_ like this trope, as their post-cranial structures are diminished to the point where their bodies appear to end just behind their gills. A subversion, as all essential body parts are present, just drastically foreshortened and compressed.
