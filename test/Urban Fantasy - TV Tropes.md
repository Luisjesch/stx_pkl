_"I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand,  
Walking through the streets of Soho in the rain,  
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's  
Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein."_

Urban Fantasy, also sometimes called "Modern Fantasy", is a genre that combines common fantasy conventions with a modern setting. The name "Urban Fantasy" is sometimes taken to imply that all works in the genre must take place in a large city, but this is not the case. Rather, the name implies throwing fantasy elements into more modern, _urban_ societies (hence its secondary name). Still, it's very common for Urban Fantasy stories to take place in a large, well-known city, all the easier for their fantasy elements to hide themselves in.

As a genre, Urban Fantasy is sometimes seen as more accessible to the average reader than the Medieval European Fantasy due to the Like Reality, Unless Noted nature of it, and the fact that modern settings are familiar to readers whereas the The Middle Ages is something that modern readers may have trouble relating to. The exact cut off date for what falls under Urban Fantasy is fuzzy, as the works which most commonly get this label applied to them feature settings in the present day, but works taking place as far back as the Victorian Era are generally included. Works taking place more than ten to twenty years in the future however, are not.

Urban Fantasies almost always take place on Earth, rather than a Constructed World, or if not on Earth then in a place so close as to make little difference. Alternate History is common, incorporating Fantasy elements into real historical events, with humans living alongside magic, though if this isn't done there is usually a Masquerade, implying that witches, elves and fairies live alongside us, just in hiding and probably forming a complete Wainscot Society. In such stories, The Unmasqued World is a common plotline. Another common convention used in Urban Fantasy is to suggest that at one point the world resembled a Medieval European Fantasy but The Magic Goes Away, and in the present The Magic Comes Back and now humans have to adjust to it.

Urban Fantasy often crosses paths with a number of genres, including Alternate History, Cosmic Horror Story, Dungeon Punk, Gothic Punk, Horror, Magic Realism, New Weird, Paranormal Romance, Paranormal Investigation, Science Fantasy, Supernatural Fiction and Supernatural Thriller. Sometimes it's difficult to tell whether a work qualifies, but generally speaking Urban Fantasy is known for showing the impact of modern society on the fantasy elements included in it. Elves carry guns, witches use microwaves and Leprechauns work at the bank. It takes more than tossing in the odd vampire solely for the fear-factor to truly apply.

Or, more cynically, a work is Urban Fantasy if it has a half-naked woman on the cover, and Paranormal Romance if it has a half-naked man on the cover.

The genre can also be split into two distinct sub-genres of its own. In one, the fantasy elements are out in the open while in the other, they exist in a kind of a shadow society, with rest of the world operating normally, generally unaware of its existence.

Gaslamp Fantasy, Supernatural Soap Opera and Historical Fantasy are notable subgenres. Urban Fantasy is itself a subgenre of Speculative Fiction, specifically Fantasy. Many works that throw mystery-genre elements into the mix also rate as Fantastic Noir. Most of the Vampire Fiction published in recent times falls under this genre, whereas in the past it followed the conventions of Horror. Urban Fantasy is often considered the fantasy equivalent of 20 Minutes into the Future.

    Literature 

This is technically one of the oldest genres in speculative fiction, predating the more strict separation of Science Fiction into a separate genre. Stoker's _Dracula_ is probably the most well-remembered, but far from the last, example from the 1800s, positing an entire ecosystem of vampires and hunters alongside modern life.

-   _Devil May Cry_: While all installments of the series use modern-day technology and concepts mixed with supernatural fantasy, the urban settings are more evident in _Devil May Cry 2_ (which has a corporate skyscraper), _DmC: Devil May Cry_ (which takes place entirely in a city) and _Devil May Cry 5_ (with battles taking place in the city streets, rooftops, and subway stations). The other games typically lean more towards a very old-world gothic feel, with _Devil May Cry 4_ heavily relying on Roman Catholic imagery.

-   _Final Fantasy_
    -   _Final Fantasy VII_ is a deconstruction where the MegaCorp Shinra has taken the advancements of its magical energy research and oppressed the people of Midgar with it, turning what could be a highly advanced urbanized society into a series of slums that are forced to abide by Shinra's overreach.
        -   _Final Fantasy VII Remake_ makes this even clearer, with even more real world urban elements like street signs and brick apartment buildings featured due to enhanced fidelity.
        -   _Final Fantasy VII Rebirth_ adds additional fantasy and urban locales on top of the city of Midgard, including sleepy suburbs, port cities, remote villages, and more.
    -   _Final Fantasy VIII_
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII_ and its sequels are another deconstruction: while four of the six heroes hail from an extremely advanced society (while the other two come from a world more closely resembling our own modernity), most of the game's plot takes place in either the wilds of said society, or in a world untouched by humans for centuries.

After that they started dialing back the urban influences to go back to the more whimsical settings of the earlier games (though they still remain and are evident in the earlier installments to a degree as well).
-   _Stardew Valley_, though the titular land isn't exactly "urban" per se, more rural.
-   _Stray Gods_
-   _Street Fighter_
-   _Super Mario Bros._: While most of the mainline games are typically straight fantasies, several of the spin-off franchises do tend to incorporate modern urban landscapes into the setting. Mostly via the _Mario Kart_ games.
    -   _Super Mario Odyssey_: The game has the Metro Kingdom, which in contrast to the game’s whimsical settings, is a realistic looking city based off of New York City. Complete with realistic looking humans.

    -   _NEO: The World Ends with You_
-   _Wuppo_
-   _Zenless Zone Zero_ is a particularly futuristic case. Many of the characters wouldn't look out of place in a standard fantasy world, such as the demi-humans who are Little Bit Beastly or Beast Men, most characters fight with melee weapons like swords, but the world's technology is highly futuristic and sci-fi in nature, and all of the locales shown so far have been highly urbanized environments, albeit oftentimes in decay and disarray.
