_Now is not a good time to photocopy your butt and staple it to your boss's face — oh no!_

A standard juvenile office prank, where the subject drops their trousers, plants their rear end against the glass of a photocopy machine and presses start. Hilarious!

Don't Try This at Home, kids. See "Real Life" below to find out why. Mooning is this trope's more direct cousin, with the advantage of this trope being that it can be done both in advance and not in range of retaliation by the victim. Subtrope of Joke of the Butt.

The first one notices his runs out of toner near the end, as his crack is completely gone at the end. He thinks nothing of it until the second finishes his face and comes up with his facial features removed.

It's also then he realizes he needs to use the bathroom.
-   _Space Brat_: Variant in book 2 - while at the Museum of New Inventions, Blork finds what appears to be an ordinary copy machine in one room and starts making faces at its side (which is as reflective as a mirror). One face is so awful, he decides to make a copy of it, climbs onto the machine and hits the start button... which gets him dumped inside.

After _about 47 failed attempts_, Hiro just gives up and has a long talk with the guy.

High-level butts are formidable opponents, and a great way to powerlevel early in the game because they never get to attack first.

    -   Another moment has him reveal that merely reciting the teacher's copy machine code makes his butt feel warm.
    -   In the _Treehouse of Horror_ story where the world plunges into the technological apocalypse that was thought to have happened because of the Y2K virus (thanks to Homer not updating the computers at the nuclear plant), Nelson breaks into school to photocopy his butt.

Soon the fire department is called in to get him out with a local news crew covering the story. They're worried that his femoral artery may be cut, meaning he could bleed out if they get him out. Butt-head tries to activate the machine (wanting to see his "female artery") which makes him pop out. Later, with the machine fixed and Beavis' butt stitched up, he wonders what his stitches look like. Butt-head suggests that he use the copier and he does—and of course, _falls through again._

-   A subtle example from _Futurama_: Fry has the code for paradox-correcting time travel tatoo'd on his buttock, for no reason. "Decision 3012" has a man traveling back in time to prevent Richard Nixon from being re-elected. He does so by reading from a certain grainy photocopy...

Muscle Man gleefully adds "That's not even a picture of our mom. It's a picture of my buttcheek I just squished it up to look like a woman's face!".

    -   In "Puppy Pause", one of the ways Dudley goofs off is that he photocopies his behind to create greeting cards with butt-related puns (e.g. "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Rear", "Happy Keister").

    Real Life 

-   Yes, people have done this in Real Life, and there are many reasons why you shouldn't:
    -   The most obvious is that you're putting some highly sensitive body parts on top of fragile glass, beneath which are moving metal parts and electrical wiring. People (being roughly a hundred times the weight of the heaviest book) can — and do — fall through the glass (like the guy in this viral security camera footage). One study reported that approximately 15% of major copier repairs are the result of people attempting this trope.
    -   Many copy machines are digital these days, and they remember when recent copies were made, which helps them narrow down who might have made the copy.
    -   Any copies acquired by your coworkers may be used in ways detrimental to your promotion prospects (although if your superiors can recognize your specific rear end, they probably weren't that great to start with).
    -   It can get you fired. Or, if not fired, at least demoted or suspended without pay, or forced to attend Sensitivity Training, or could get your pay docked.
    -   It wastes toner. Hey, high schools aren't made of money.
-   A variant prank is to make enough photocopies of your butt that you can tape them end to end (so to speak) in a chain. Feed the chain into a scroll-fed fax machine, enter the fax number of someone you don't like, and when one end comes out, tape it to the other end. You are now sending an infinite series of butts to the other end (or at least wasted all their toner). Try not to do this at an office building, though, where they'll discover your prank through the exorbitant phone bill you've racked up in the process. Even if you do this at home, 1. Most fax machines also have caller ID circuitry built right in and will print your number and other condemning messages on the top of the page, fingering you as the culprit, and 2. Hope you don't mind the incredibly exorbitant phone bill you're going to rack up pulling off this prank, particularly if the recipient is out of state (or worse, in a different country).
