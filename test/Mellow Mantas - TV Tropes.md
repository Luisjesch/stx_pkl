Manta rays (along with their smaller cousins the mobular rays) are considered the Gentle Giants of the fish world. They swim so gracefully it almost looks like they're flying, they're harmless to anything larger than krill, and they may even be intelligent enough to recognise themselves in mirrors. This reputation often carries over into fiction, where they're depicted as unaggressive and a sight to behold, in stark contrast to other cartilaginous fish. Some characters may even ride them. If they're anthropomorphised, they'll usually be laid-back, friendly, and heroic, but not action-oriented.

This trope is Truth in Television. Rays are generally curious and playful, and they're more likely to swim away from danger than attack.

Contrast Sinister Stingrays, its Unpleasant Animal Counterpart. Not to be confused with a mellow mantra, which you might use while meditating.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bleach_: Captain Unohana is the gentle and graceful leader of the Fourth Division, which is devoted to healing, and is famed for her gentle spirit and powerful healing abilities. When she activates her Shikai, it manifests as an enormous ray that can carry multiple people in its stomach, where it heals them from even severe injuries. For most people, that's all they ever really know about her. However, this trope is subverted; a thousand years ago, Unohana was the first Kenpachi of the Eleventh Division, an Ax-Crazy murderer whose Bankai can create a blood-soaked arena that uses both blood and healing to create a vicious, never-ending battle. When she turned away from that violent path, she devoted herself solely to healing and using her Shikai in gentle ways to save lives.

    Films — Animated 

-   Mr. Ray from _Finding Nemo_ is the friendly teacher to all the kids in the Great Barrier Reef. He lets them ride on his back and sings songs about all the sea creatures. Early on in _Finding Dory_, he goes on a migration with several other spotted eagle rays and is enthusiastic to take the children on a field trip to educate them about migration.
-   _Moana_: Grandma Tala has manta rays as an Animal Motif (including a tattoo of one on her back), and while she's the self-admitted "village crazy lady", she's also a wise and gentle mentor towards her granddaughter Moana. After she dies later in the film, her spirit comes back as a manta ray and gives Moana some helpful advice when she needs it.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem_: Ray Fillet, despite being an enemy of the turtles here as opposed to one of the allies per the norm (initially anyway), when he's not fighting the turtles or helping Superfly in his schemes, he's shown to be an all-around decent Gentle Giant with a penchant for spontaneously breaking out into song.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Ultraman Cosmos 2: The Blue Planet_ has a race of benevolent, friendly manta ray-based kaiju named Reija which are the allies of the Alien Gyasshis. The Reija usually serve as steeds to their masters and assists Ultraman Cosmos and humanity in the film's final battle against the Horde of Alien Locusts known as the Scorpiss.

     Literature 

-   In _Dr. Franklin's Island_, Semi is turned into a plankton-eating fish that looks like a blue-backed manta ray about the size of a "flattened teenager", with only her eyes remaining recognizable. She's really a Mix-and-Match Critter, spliced with DNA from multiple fish species, and notes that there's a stinger in her strong, flexible tail. Knowing a bit about "devil rays", she muses that they can leap out of the water and crush small fishing boats underneath them, but she finds breaching like that way too dramatic to do often. When encouraging a guilty scientist to feel bad looking at her Semi says in narration that manta rays aren't known for being able to give a Death Glare, but she looked at him as meanly as she could.

    Toys 

-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_: The heroic mutant Ray Fillet is a mutant manta ray. Despite being large and extremely strong and tough, he's usually depicted as having the personality of a laid-back Surfer Dude.

    Video Games 

-   _Campfire Cat Cafe & Snack Bar_: One of the special NPCs is Flowy Mandy, an anthropomorphic manta ray with a calm expression. She dances for the player, causing more acorns (the game's currency) to appear.
-   _Deep Rock Galactic_: Mobula Cave Angels are flying alien manta rays that float harmlessly high above certain underground caverns. The player dwarves are able to hitch rides underneath their claws and even control them.
-   Mantas are among the first creatures you'll see in both _Endless Ocean_ games, gliding majestically through the water without bothering a soul. _Blue World_ even lets you watch a cutscene of a squadron of mantas engaged in a courtship "dance".
-   _Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future_: Manta rays are harmless, and one is used to shield Ecco from a gigantic eel in one level.
-   _Far Cry 3_ features Giant Manta Rays. Not only are they one of the few creatures in the game that won't attack you on sight, but the Flavor Text you get from killing one (snarkily provided by agent Willis) is rather complimentary of them.
-   In _Final Fantasy XIV_, the Kojin of the Blue, who live in the Ruby Sea, tame manta rays to use as mounts to speed their way through the ocean. These rays are depicted as largely docile and help their masters find treasure. One quest even has the Player Character help a manta ray find a mate. Averted with the rays tamed by the Kojin of the Red, which are aggressive and will attack the player on sight.
-   _Freddi Fish_: Ray from the first two games will give a helpful gizmo to Freddi and Luther provided they trade him something else for it.
-   _Pokémon_: Several of Mantyke's Pokédex entries say it's friendly, likes to approach people on boats, and tourists love watching them swim near the surface. Its evolution Mantine has a symbiotic relationship with Remoraid, is described as "majestic" or "graceful" in many Pokédex entries, and are tame enough for people in Alola to ride them between islands as a sport.
-   Big Man from _Splatoon 3_ is an anthropomorphic eagle ray, and the most easy-going and fun-loving member of Deep Cut. Unlike his co-stars, he doesn't even try to act tough in story mode.
-   _Subnautica_ has several ray-like creatures native to 4546B — Rabbit Rays, Jellyrays, Ghostrays, Crimson Rays, and even the flying Skyrays. They're all poisonous enough to be inedible, but they're also peaceful herbivores. Jellyrays and Ghostrays are particularly serene-looking, being highly bioluminescent. _Below Zero_ introduces another couple species, Arrow Rays and Arctic Rays, but those are less mellow — Arctic Rays are carnivorous (though they only eat small fish and won't go after anything human-sized), and while Arrow Rays are actually edible, they'll attempt to fight back against anything trying to eat them.
-   _Super Mario 64_: The manta ray in Dire, Dire Docks is completely harmless and even beneficial. It leaves behind a trail of bubble-rings, and if you swim through five of them in a row, you get a Power Star.
-   _New Super Mario Bros. Wii_: World 5-5 is an Auto-Scrolling Level where you have to jump between numerous Jumbo Rays that fly past and serve as floating platforms.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_: Alderaan is inhabited by "thrantas", docile manta ray-like creatures that fly in the air rather than swim. They're commonly used as beasts of burden by the Alderaanians, including providing the in-game taxi service from any location other than the two factional spaceports (normally either a landspeeder, speeder bike, or skyhopper on other planets).
    -   The earlier game, _Knights of the Old Republic_ also had thrantas flying around Dantooine, which were quite harmless compared to the Kath hounds.
-   In some levels of _Treasures of the Deep_, the player can get off their submersible and ride on the back of a manta ray to find a hidden area with extra treasure.

    Western Animation 

-   Fully averted in _Beast Wars_, which has the Maximal manta ray Depth Charge. Despite his docile beast mode, he is a very angry, very obsessed, and hopelessly broken Anti-Hero whose Revenge Before Reason attitude alienates his allies and leads him to a tragic but inevitable end, falling into a midpoint somewhere between the personalities of Batman and The Punisher.
-   A _Wild Kratts_ episode focusing on sharks has a calming interlude with a manta ray (and a few remoras) where the brothers gush over its gentle majesty. Unfortunately, said gushing is cut short by the intrusion of a great white shark.
-   One episode of _The Wild Thornberrys_ has Eliza and her father Nigel attempting to film a school of manta rays, with the latter explaining that they are one of the sea's gentlest creatures although they were once mistaken for sea monsters.
