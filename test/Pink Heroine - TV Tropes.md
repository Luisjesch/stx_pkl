Two words: think pink.

Having been influenced by Sentai, many Magical Girl shows are Color-Coded for Your Convenience. And in these shows the protagonist and/or leader of the team is often the one in pink.

For a character to fall under this trope, they must meet two requirements:

-   The character must be a magical girl/boy or superhero
-   The character must be the protagonist OR the leader of their team.

There's usually a good chance this character will have a Heart Beat-Down or Petal Power attack.

This trope often crosses over with Rose-Haired Sweetie, Cheery Pink, and Princess Protagonist.

A Sub-Trope of Red Is Heroic and Pink Means Feminine.

Compare Princesses Prefer Pink, Pink Product Ploy. Contrast Psycho Pink, when pink is used for villains.

    -   Both Chibi Moon's transformation and uniform are predominantly pink. Like Usagi, she also has her own guardians that protect her, which also makes her the "center" of her group. Her pink hair and red eyes are meant to evoke the image of an albino rabbit's ears and eyes, and possibly the idea that Princesses Prefer Pink.
