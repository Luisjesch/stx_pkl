**Elsbeth:** Here, Kat, this should slow the venom long enough for your healing to beat it.  
**Katrina:** Hu... don't you need to know what toxin...  
**Elsbeth:** It's a magic, broad-spectrum antidote, don't worry about it.

The panacea, named for a Greek goddess of healing, is a mythical substance able to cure any illness or poison and even prolong one's life. This basic form of wish-fulfillment, a medicine that instantly fixes everything, is an old idea and takes many forms in various mythologies and subsequent fiction.

The strength of its effect varies. A weak panacea will work on natural diseases but might be useless against certain ailments, especially if they are of a magical or evil nature. It might elongate one's lifespan, but must be taken regularly to do so and it may not work forever. A strong panacea, on the other hand, is proof against anything you can think of and might well bestow endless life with one sip, making its user The Ageless.

It takes many forms as well. Classically it's a liquid, but common substances also include mystical fruits, herbs, flowers, or the body part of some mythical creature. It might even be some kind of jewel.

The distinction between a Healing Potion a panacea is that the former is geared towards fixing physical injuries and the latter to invisible and silent ailments. Nevertheless, there is overlap and many cases of one will work as the other.

However, eating his food makes you heal in some unfortunate ways, like throwing up your intestines, after that you are 150% as healthy. One drawback is that any _individual_ meal Pearl Jam makes is not a "cure-all", it takes a specific recipe to cure one specific malady.
    -   _JoJolion_ has a much darker version of the Panacea in the form of the Locacaca, a mystical fruit capable of healing pretty much anything... but also turns another part of the body to stone, and while it seems to work on the basis of Equivalent Exchange it has an odd sense of priority, such as healing minor injuries by turning brain tissue to stone. A concentrated, experimental liquid version called Locacaca 6251 seems to be more potent and has less adverse side-effects, petrifying patches of skin rather than entire limbs, but the risk is still there, and the creation and distribution of the drug itself is controlled by a secret organization made up of Rock Humans.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: One exists in the Magical World, in the form of a potion that can cure any disease if taken. As one might expect however, it is rare and _incredibly_ expensive.

The Raven sprinkled them with the Water of Death—the pieces joined together, the body became whole. The Falcon sprinkled it with the Water of Life—Prince Ivan shuddered, stood up, and said:

    Fan Works 

-   _Hearts of Ice_: Cologne keeps a couple of Shards of the Apple, pieces of fruit of the first apple tree which have incredible healing properties. Unfortunately they are so incredibly old than they have lost most of their potency.
    
    The Shards were, of course, immeasurably old, remarkably preserved pieces of fruit from the very first apple tree in the world.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The father in _My Big Fat Greek Wedding_ pulls out Windex anytime someone has an ailment, and in the film, it seems to cure everything from poison ivy to pimples.
-   _Ravenous_ portrays the Wendigo myth as being true, and eating the flesh of another human grants a wide range of benefits, including a Healing Factor which allows someone to recover from gunshots, stab wounds, or messily broken bones without so much as a scar. Diseases don't fare any better, as the film's Big Bad was on death's door due to tuberculosis before he first turned to cannibalism, and within months he was fully cured and hasn't ever been sick since. Too bad all of this comes with the side effect of an unstoppable Horror Hunger.
-   _Robot Monster_: An attempt at creating a serum to cure all diseases is crucial to the backstory, and is the reason the main characters survived the invasion up to this point; not only did it work, it also turned out to have the unintended side effect of making a person immune to the calcination beam that wiped out the rest of humanity.
-   _Star Wars_: Bacta is a liquid medicine used to regenerate people from severe injuries. In _The Empire Strikes Back_, Luke Skywalker is immersed in a bacta tank to recover from hypothermia and being mauled by a wampa during a misadventure at the start of the film. In _The Mandalorian_, IG-11 uses a bacta spray to heal Din Djarin of a head injury sustained in an explosion. In the Expanded Universe, bacta has also been used to treat diseases.

    Gamebooks 

-   In _Lone Wolf_, Oede Herb is the most powerful Healing Herb of the world, and can cure just about any disease and many poisons. It's also the rarest and most expensive.
-   In _Sorcery!_, the _Fighting Fantasy_ 4-issue spinoff, there are chances of the player catching diseases and curses during their adventure. When this happens, they can pray to their Patron Goddess, Libra, to erase all those diseases for them. It's also possible to obtain a potion from Fenestra the Elf that remove diseases instantly.

    Literature 

-   In _The Andromeda Strain_, when a rubber seal fails and one of the main characters is exposed to the virus, he volunteers to take Kalocin, a top-secret antibiotic that destroys all unicellular life — bacteria, fungi, viruses, you name it — and even causes remission in cancer. One of the other scientists absolutely refuses to allow it. An expository paragraph then explains that when tested on humans, the drug wiped out all the symbiotic microorganisms living inside and on them; when the doses stopped, harmful microbes moved into the now-empty biological niches and killed all the subjects in various grotesque ways within six hours.
-   In _The Angel of Khan el-Khalili_, Aliaa obtains a bezoar from the self-proclaimed angel Seeker with the promise that it will heal her mortally wounded sister Aisha (who rushed into a burning building to rescue Aliaa and their coworkers). Seeker assures that on ingestion it will swiftly and fully heal all of Aisha's ailments, including her burns and smoke-damaged lungs.
-   The Grand Panacea from _Baccano!_. Its perfect form also grants immunity to aging.
-   _Belgariad_: When asked by Adara to magically make a rosebush bloom, Garion refuses because it'd hurt the plant and instead creates a new flower from some twigs. It becomes known a small, lop-sided and unimpressive species called Adara's Rose until _The Malloreon_ reveals it to be a sovereign specific — capable of curing any poison, even one like thalot, which has no known antidote and resists magical intervention. Polgara had previously investigated the flower for any sign of usefulness but found nothing; it turns out that the fragrance has to be inhaled for it to work, something she didn't realise was possible until advised by Sadi and Cyradis. While Belgarath is transforming Zakath's bedroom to fill it with blooms that will fend off the thalot poisoning, Garion observes that — even in those who are fully fit and well like him — the fragrance instantly makes him more relaxed, refreshed and revitalised than he's felt for months.
-   In _Bridge of Birds_, when the children of Number Ten Ox's village fall deathly ill from chewing poisoned leaves, Ten Ox and the sage Li Kao go on a quest to find a powerful ginseng root that can cure any disease. Unfortunately, the root has been broken up into pieces and stored in the extremely well-hidden and guarded treasure vaults of the villainous Duke of Ch'in, and only the _entire_ root will be enough to cure the children.
-   In the first (plotwise) book in _The Chronicles of Narnia: The Magician's Nephew_, the apples of a particular tree in a special garden have the power to cure disease. The scenario was written to reference the garden of Eden, and the fruit enfolded a Secret Test of Character: after taking one, Diggory is told that had he eaten it himself, or stolen it for his terminally sick mother, he'd have ultimately regretted it; it doesn't just cure disease, it makes one _unable to die even if one wants to_ - they have given up any possibility of Heaven in favor of unending life on Earth. The White Witch did exactly that, and it took Aslan's personal touch to end her. But because he resisted temptation, he is given an apple from the tree which grew from the one he retrieved, which fully restores his mother and permits her to die peacefully decades later.
-   _Codex Alera_ has the mushroom called the Blessing of Night, which grows in only one place and can heal injuries, poisoning and also infertility.
-   In _The Elenium_, The High Queen has been administered a poison believed to have no remedy, and her champion must find an object of power to cure her. As it happens, none will suffice but the Bhelliom, a Cosmic Keystone of practically unlimited power. Although the story initially serves up the Bhelliom as a cure to this specific predicament, it quickly becomes a greater MacGuffin by dint of the desire of the Big Bad to possess it by any means. While it does cure the poisoning and restore Ehlana back to health, it doesn't cure side-effects of the poisoning such as loss of fertility; as a result, the goddess Aphrael instigates a secretly magical pregnancy whereby Ehlana eventually gives birth to Danae, the goddess Aphrael in disguise. This ensures that Ehlana will have an heir to the throne, even though the poison left her infertile.
-   On _Gor_, the Caste of Physicians have created a pretty good panacea in the "Stabilization Serums", a series of shots which effectively make you immortal and stop aging. You can still die due to injuries of course, and it doesn't work 100% of the time; more like 98%. In book 27 there's a newer version which de-ages you 10 years per treatment. And the Priest-Kings — the Insectoid Aliens Powers That Be of Gor — have perfected them even more: Misk the Priest-King is over 6,000,000 years old. The physicians have also cured almost all diseases except "the Holy Disease" which is believed to be a punishment by the Priest-Kings.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat, and it can resolve most, though not all, poisons. Despite the seeming mundanity of the origin, bezoars seem to be quite rare, as they are mentioned to be expensive, and the school's potion ingredients store contains only a few.
    -   As well, phoenix tears, in addition to mending flesh, are strong enough to be the only cure for basilisk venom.
    -   Drinking unicorn blood can sustain one's life no matter how serious the affliction, but the drinker is cursed thereafter because of how evil it is to hurt a unicorn.
    -   Mandrakes can be used to brew a potion that will dispel any curse, and even cured an affliction that merely looked like a curse. However, not just any mandrake, only a specific, extra deadly, stubborn variety will do.
    -   The Hogwarts hospital wing also has a drug that will clear up a wide variety of common illnesses, at the cost of causing smoke and steam to continually come out from the patient's orifices.
-   _Kate Daniels_ has panacea be a miracle drug that helps shapeshifters to not go full loup. It's incredibly hard to get a hold of. Until Kate rescues a guy who knows how to make it and brings him home with her, anyway.
-   The Athelas weed, a.k.a. Kingsfoil, in _The Lord of the Rings_ has unspecified medicinal properties; it may not be good for everything, but it is able to cure several ailments, most notably the Black Breath, a curse brought on by contact with the corruption of Sauron. The process of preparing the remedy suggests that magic is involved. The same plant is used in _The Silmarillion_.
-   _The Radix_: The eponymous MacGuffin is an ancient plant that, if cooked properly, can heal any illness and even raise the dead. Supposedly, it belonged to Jesus himself. Stored in a mummy's chest for ages, it made its dead tissues regenerate and bleed.
-   Among its many other functions, the titular energy of _The Stormlight Archive_ can heal just about anything, including cuts, broken bones, bad eyes, missing limbs, damaged souls, and, under the exact right circumstances, _death itself_. It is as yet unclear whether it will stop aging.
-   Lansip fruits in _Tales of Kolmar_ can cure just about anything, and can even reverse aging. However, they're extremely hard to come by, as lansip only grows on an island that is protected by strong storms - ships can only get through about once every hundred years.

The transformation is extremely painful.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Some versions of the Holy Grail myth had it that the Grail could cure anything, grant immortality, etc. This idea was relished by treasure-seekers for whom a relic of unrivaled holiness just wasn't good enough. The same kind of powers have been attributed to any number of other Christian relics. Buddhists, similarly, have tales of many such relics (usually bones from revered monks held in temples).
-   Russian Mythology and Tales: Living water and Dead water, used to bring someone back from the dead — the Dead Water removes the dead person's wounds and rot (but kills the living) and the Living Water is then used to bring them back to life.

It has been used to elongate the lifespan of the entire Cabot family by nearly 400 years.

-   In _Mortasheen_, the Streptile is a reptile-like artificial organism whose body is intensely hostile to all microorganisms, and can even spray a "medicine breath", a cloud of phagocytes which immediately wipes out even the most virulent germs on contact. However, this also includes beneficial symbionts like gut bacteria, so being cleansed by the Streptile is basically just as detrimental to one's health as having an illness, if not more so.
-   _Neopets_:
    -   Cooling Ointment and Warm Amber Ointment are two rare items that stock in the Brightvale potion shop. Either one can act as any other medicine item.
    -   A Good Bad Bug is that one of the cheapest and most reliable ways to cure a pet's disease is... feeding them poison. Any new disease they get will overwrite any that already had. The most common way to do this is to use the Poisonous Lollipop, an early reward from Jhudora that will give anyone who eats it Floppy Tongue. A nasty surprise for a healthy pet, but a godsend for one that _was_ suffering from an illness that can be _forty times_ as expensive to "properly" cure such as Ugga-Ugga.
-   From the _RPC Authority_, RPC-588 are seemingly normal bees whose stings contain a chemical (designated RPC-588-A) that can cure any disease or mental illness, although not physical injuries.
