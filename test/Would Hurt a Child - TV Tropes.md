_"I don't give a shit HOW old you are. Maybe think before you pick a fight next time."_

In fiction and in the media, both heroes and villains often agree on one thing: they Wouldn't Hurt a Child.

This creed exists for various reasons: it may be because Children Are Innocent, and thus should be protected and kept out of harm's way at all costs; it may be because, to Moral Guardians, seeing a child being brutalized is Harmful to Minors and thus should be avoided; it may also be because even writers mostly disagree with the idea of writing about harming a child.

But sometimes, some people just don't agree with that. Or just don't care. And, they _do_ hurt children, sometimes even kill them, in defiance of the Improbable Infant Survival. Indeed, the act of harming a child usually comes off as the ultimate act of villainy.

This trope is almost always a Kick the Dog moment. Hence, the presence of Would Hurt A Child is often telltale of a Crapsack World or at least a Darker and Edgier series. However, it is surprisingly easy to subvert this trope simply by using Kids Are Cruel (the flip side of Children Are Innocent) and combining it with Pay Evil unto Evil. Does a soldier shooting a child soldier still seem like an ultimate villain? And want to go all the way? Make the children creepy or, even better, make them Enfant Terribles and, this time, hurting said children will look much less as a Moral Event Horizon crossing, even though there will always be some Moral Guardians or Papa Wolf / Mama Bear to complain. This may also be done by a Complete Monster to establish that even a villain has lines they won't dare cross. Naturally, the Friend to All Children sees this type of character as a mortal enemy, with an exception sometimes for religious figures in some cases.

In Western works, this trope is rare and almost always done off-panel when played straight (read: when the violence towards the child isn't being stopped in the nick of time and causes actual damage) largely due to broadcast standards; it's a little more common in literature but still not very much so. In Japanese fiction, child brutality can be more common but is often framed in a very specific way (again, to conform to _their_ S&P) and has actually faded somewhat in the new millenium over content concerns.

**Important Note**: This trope is about **adults physically hurting children, or deliberately placing them in life-threatening situations**, fatally or not. **The following are not examples**: psychological/verbal abuse (very common but not that trope), abduction (only applies if the child dies or gets effectively hurt), depriving a child of food (that's Denied Food as Punishment and only counts as this trope if taken to the point where the child is at risk of serious harm from lack of food), child on child violence (unless adults are forcing the children to hurt each other, that's Kids Are Cruel), exploitation for profit by the parents if they aren't hurt (that is Financial Abuse). Violence to teenagers, with the exception of some of those in their early teens, isn't an example either since teenagers are physically stronger than children and lack the "completely defenseless" element, especially if Teens Are Monsters. However, teenagers harming children applies.

There is also an interesting Double Standard when it comes to characters applying for this trope, since they are almost Always Male. Rarely are women described as being _physically_ violent to children. Even rarer are the instances when they actually _kill_ them. Indeed, killing children is among the few things that permanently prevent a woman from a convenient High-Heel–Face Turn. Extra points if the killing is done _directly_ and at the woman's hands (i.e. stabbing, strangling etc...). Compare Pædo Hunt, another child abuse trope where female perpetrators are similarly unheard of.

A Sub-Trope of Kick the Dog. Burn the Orphanage is a particular form of this. See also Child Hater, who hates kids but isn't necessarily physically abusive and Nice Job Breaking It, Herod, which is often an extreme version. If they're not stopped in time by the heroes, this overlaps with Death of a Child. Contrast Improbable Infant Survival and Wouldn't Hurt a Child. Compare Kids Are Cruel, Children Are Innocent. Related to Eats Babies and Child Eater. Usually applies to the Sadist Teacher. If a villain who is quite capable of bothering adults prefers to spend his time as an antagonist for kids or teenagers, it's fair to say Pick on Someone Your Own Size. For the role-reversed example of this trope, see Double Standard: Violence, Child on Adult, in which case it's a _child_ physically harming an adult for comedic effect.

Compare and contrast Don't Make Me Take My Belt Off!, which deals more with physical discipline from a parent to a child, the big difference being that Would Hurt A Child always implies deliberate malevolence and cruelty towards the child, whereas Don't Make Me Take My Belt Off! does not, unless explained otherwise by the story.

Offing the Offspring would also apply if the one doing the hurt is the parent of the child, and death of the latter results.

    Music 

-   Country Music has approached the topic in several hit songs about child abuse. The video for Martina McBride's "Concrete Angel" comes the closest to actually showing parent-on-child abuse on-screen - a young boy watches as shadows on a wall depict a woman (an actress shaking a stunt dummy) shaking her daughter viciously. "Alyssa Lies" by Jason Michael Carroll strongly implies that a young girl had been viciously beaten by her father.
-   Averted in the video for Garth Brooks' "The Thunder Rolls." In the video, a young man (Brooks, wearing a fake beard) horribly beats his wife up (after confronting him over one an affair of his she found out about) and their young daughter witnesses it and begs for it to stop. Daddy doesn't take it too kindly and advances on her. He's just about to grab the little girl when the wife tells him to stop or else he gets his head blown off.

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Bible_:
    -   King Herod did this in order to try to kill Jesus. It didn't work.
    -   Earlier, Pharaoh killed Hebrew sons to keep the Hebrews from becoming strong enough that in case of a war they could join the enemy and fight against Egypt. Fortunately for the Hebrews, Moses escaped slaughter.
    -   God Himself kills the firstborn of Egypt as one of the Ten Plagues, as well as David and Bathsheba's firstborn (to punish David). The second example is especially horrible in that the child isn't killed quickly, but is subjected to pain and suffering for _seven days_, with David watching the whole thing and begging God for forgiveness. This tends to be a habit of the God of the Old Testament (He will test or punish His enemies _and_ followers by targeting their children). This is arguably the most contentious part of God's character in theology.
    -   One oft-misquoted law in the Old Testament supposedly requires parents to have their offspring stoned to death for being disobedient, however, the exact wording of that law specifies - regardless of translation - that the accused is both a glutton and a drunkard. Obviously, this is not a kid.
    -   Solomon seems willing to do this to a baby that two women both want custody over, but it was really a test to see which woman truly cared about the baby. One woman was fine with the "cut the baby in half" thing while the other was horrified by the suggestion.
    -   According to _Book of Judges_, the Canaanites are notorious for burning their children for their idols, resulting in God telling the Israelites to purge all of the gentiles in Canaan so they would not be tainted by idolatry.
    -   _Books of Samuel_: In Samuel I, King Saul is ordered to exterminate the Amalekites: every man, woman, child, and animal.
-   Classical Mythology: Many Greek myths punish a parent by slaughtering their children. Probably the best known example is Medea with the addition that the children in question were _her own_ and their deaths were to get back at the philandering Jason.
-   Norse Mythology:
    -   Gudrun kills her own children who she births, then feeds them to to Attila the Hun.
    -   Signy, sister of Sigmund (and therefore the aunt of Sigurd the Dragonslayer), is an even more cruel example. She casually offs the sons she bore with her husband, deeming them unfit. When she gives birth to her brother's son, she willingly drives a needle through his arm, and he doesn't blink. _THAT_ is the son she deems to be fitting.

    Podcasts 

-   The cult of the Nameless God in _Dark Dice_ kidnapped an entire village's worth of children in order to sacrifice them in an effort to release their god. By the time the party reaches the cultists, only four children are left alive.
-   Tuatha and Solvin from _The Fallen Gods_ are both perfectly willing to fight and kill a child in episode 7. Flint, less so. To be fair, the child _does_ want to kill and eat them.
-   The guards in _The Chimera Program_ arc of _Cool Kids Table_, despite being ordered to "subdue and contain" the escaping child experiments, are shooting to kill.
-   _Sick Sad World_:
    -   The hosts note one of the reasons the Jonestown murder-suicide was so tragic was that infants were among the casualties.
    -   "2 Cruel 4 School" covers a mass shooting at a school, which got multiple kids as young as six killed.
-   _Pretending to Be People_ features strange hordes of children. Marvin Glass uses them as competitors in blood sports. Clark Bishop is forced to fight one of said children, brutally beating him and leaving him to be be crushed to death by a Descending Ceiling

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Bryan Danielson threatened to backhand a girl flipping him off while he was cutting a promo in Ring of Honor. She started flipping him off again while he continued his promo, leading to him getting out of the ring to confront her, with the crowd chanting for her to "fuck him up".
-   An infamous instance came during an episode of WWE _Smackdown!_ in 2004, when – during a storyline involving Lita, Matt Hardy and their baby – Gene Snitsky brought a wrapped towel to the ring while Lita was in the ring, claiming it was Lita's baby. After taunting Lita with harm toward the baby, he took the towel, dropped it and then punted it into the crowd.
-   Melissa Coates slapped a boy booing prior to her challenging Mercedes Martinez for the WSU Title. Hailey Hatred went so far as to push over two adults then lift a little girl out her seat and throw her while in search of something to hit Martinez with.
-   While many of the wrestlers of Wonder Ring STARDOM would not have been considered legal adults at the time, nine year old HARUKA being put against men near their physical prime like Kenny Omega took the cake. Ice Ribbon did similar with Riho, who was _eight_.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Shadowrun: MegaCorps that want stable, loyal cyborgs have learned that children make the best candidates. HMHVV-infected are cannibalistic so it's assumed that they'll eventually eat children. Mr. Johnson may want your group to kidnap, hurt, or kill a target child for reasons he's unwilling to divulge.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The Dread Emperor, a villain introduced in the Splat book _The Book of Vile Darkness_, not only gladly hurts children, he uses this behavior to benefit him in the most selfish way. An imposing, two meter tall man in golden armor, the Dread Emperor keeps children chained to his armor at all times with any damage done to the Emperor himself transferred to the children via the armor's magic. An unrepentant Serial Killer, the Emperor uses these children as a bait for any heroes foolish enough to take him on and does not limit his hostilities to children; he will often destroy entire city blocks when he's a mind to. When a hero challenges him, the Dread Emperor feels no compunction slaying hundreds simply to kill a target or mentally enslaving any civilians nearby and using them to attack his opponent for him.
    -   Pale Night is a powerful demon lord. Many eons ago, she tricked Morwell, the queen of the eladrin, into a vile pact that resulted in an entire generation of eladrin children being trapped in the Abyssal layer of Androlynne; since then, Pale Night and her forces have been hunting them down one by one at her leisure. To this day, armies of eladrin try to protect the children (who remain forever young due to the pact) and find a means for them to escape. Morwell's current consort Faerinaal leads the armies presently, and even though his predecessor (and the one before that one) perished doing so, less than a third of the children survive to the present day.
    -   The 4th Edition introduces hideous monsters called banderhobs who kidnap mortals, some of them actually taking children from their bed at night. (The illustration for the creature in the _Monster Manual 3_ shows one about to do just that.) Where they take their victims and what they _do_ with them is a mystery.

    -   _Macbeth_:
        
        -   Rare Female Example occurs with Lady Macbeth. The violence is only implied, but at this point in the play, she seems perfectly capable of going through with it.
        
        **Lady Macbeth**: I have given suck, and know  
        How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:  
        I would, while it was smiling in my face,  
        Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,  
        And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you  
        Have done to this.
        
        -   Not just implied with Macbeth, who has assassins murder Macduff's wife and young son. His wife is horrified by this, though not because of the children — it screws up her political machinations. That said, those particular murders do feature among the things she mentions in the infamous sleepwalking scene.
        
        _The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What, will these hands ne'er be clean?_
        
        -   The witches also mention using a dead baby in one of their spells, just to show how witches are evil.

-   _Westeros: An American Musical_:
    -   The fact that Gregor Clegane killed Elia Martell and her children is brought up a couple of times.
    -   The whole "should we use Edric Storm as a Human Sacrifice or not?" debate in Stannis' faction in Act II stems in part from the fact Edric is still quite young and some members of the group are more willing to look past this than others.

    Theme Parks 

-   Universal Orlando's Halloween Horror Nights implied this with their 2010 haunted maze, The Orfanage: it's heavily implied that the entire house takes place after the orphanage has burned down and you're being assaulted by the ghosts of the children, with various imagery and audio hinting at various tortures that the children were put through by their caretakers until Cindy demonstrated her abilities and burned down the orphanage with all the kids trapped inside.
-   Knott's Scary Farm features the Tooth Fairy, the main antagonist of the haunted attraction of the same name, who is obsessed with teeth and will break into the homes of children who have just lost teeth to violently kidnap them and take them to a realm of her own. There, she and her minions will brutally and painfully imprison and torture them, ripping out their intestines, bones, organs, and teeth until they are dead. She commands her minions to make things as horrific as possible, using massive drills, saws, hooks, and knives to mutilate and torment the innocent children.

    Visual Novels 

-   Kirei Kotomine of _Fate/stay night_ rounded up all the surviving orphans of the Fuyuki Fire and cut off their limbs before sealing them in coffins that drained their prana. They were alive and aware for the entire _ten years_ between the two wars.
    -   Zouken Matou has no issues with Shinji treating Sakura harshly or raping her. In fact, he has gone to significant lengths to break her psychologically.
-   Some culprits in _Ace Attorney_ set their murderous sights on younger people, although their age usually never drops below teenage years. The youngest target, Vera Misham, was 12 when Kristoph Gavin gave her poisoned nail polish as a long-term backup plan to cover up his forgery plot — he took advantage of her agoraphobia and convinced her that the nail polish was a good luck charm that would keep her safe if she ever went outside, knowing that she often bit her nails and that in the event she went outside to testify against him in court, her habit would kill her. She didn't actually use it until she was 19, and although it was a close shave, she did survive. And then there's prosecutor Gaspen Payne, who encourages the judge to give Albi Ur'gaid, a _nine-year-old boy,_ the **death penalty** because he wants Phoenix Wright to suffer the same fate under the Defence Culpability Act. The only child to actually be murdered in the series is a victim of spree killer Joe Darke in the backstory of the first game's fifth case.
-   The Bad Ends of _The Cradle of Ruin_ tend to result in Tsuna, and sometimes Hotarou dying. In the Bad Ends for Route B, Demonica kills Tsuna if Hotarou chooses to let her die. Demonica will either kill Hotarou or consider dismembering him depending on the choice.
-   In _Saya no Uta_, Yousuke Suzumi dismembers his young daughter and rapes the young-looking Saya after getting the same type of Agnosia the protagonist suffers from.
-   In _ATOM GRRRL!!_, this is revealed to be the case for Anna, upon a mother begging to leave during Dave's attempted robbery:
    
    **Anna:** Did I fuckin' say you could talk? Just keep your head down, you old cunt.  
    **Lady:** Eeeek!  
    **Anna:** And keep your brats quiet or I'll bring 'em down to Mexico and sell 'em! We're doin' business right now, so shut the hell up!
    
-   _Your Turn to Die_: The Deadly Game's organizers threw 3 kids into it alongside the rest of the participants. One of them is already dead by the time it officially begins, another can die depending on your actions, and the last one will almost certainly be scarred for life if he manages to survive.

    Web Animation 

-   _DEATH BATTLE!_: Whenever one of the combatants is a minor, expect this trope to apply to their opponent.
-   Blitzo from _Helluva Boss_ is perfectly willing to take contracts out on children. I.M.P's jingle even has the line "Kids die for FREE~!" In the pilot, once he learns that the boy he had (accidentally) shot was his client's target, he shoots him dead, dismembers his body, and then gives the remains to the boy's mother. Probably didn't help that the kid was a total Spoiled Brat who insulted him and his employees.
-   Carl from _Llamas with Hats_ once created a machine for the specific purpose of crushing orphans to death. In the second episode, Paul also mentions him head butting children off the side of a sinking ship.
-   The _Lobo (Webseries)_ episode "Lobo for President" had the Main Man shoot an alien baby for peeing acid in his face.
-   _Manga Soprano_: Karin hit Kanade's baby Haru on the head to shut her up because she was annoyed by her crying. Bakura stopped her before she can hit Haru again.
-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Dave has no problem with hurting Bear, Snake, Duck, and Balloon, who are the 4 "kids" of the main cast.
-   _Chadam_: Viceroy ends up kidnapping eight-year old Ripley as another living person to dissect.
-   _Red vs. Blue_: Church makes it very clear that he is disgusted by Tucker's alien son, Junior; if the other characters weren't constantly stopping him, Church would have gone through with his plan of stepping on Junior's neck and killing him.
-   _My Little Pony Meets_: When Spike retrieves Rapunzel's rare gems from the Diamond Dogs, they beat him until he is mortally wounded. Rarity deals them comeuppance, and Rapunzel uses her hair to bring him back.
