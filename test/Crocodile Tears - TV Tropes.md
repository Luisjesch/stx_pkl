You'd think after twelve games, they'd have learned by now.

_"Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him whatever he wanted."_

Basically, fake tears.

Many actors can be relied on for their facial expressions, their voices, their looks, muscle, hair, what have you. But to be able to cry on demand? That is a rare and powerful gift.

But the power to do so, without sincerity, in the hands of the Manipulative Bastard? Heaven help us all.

This trope gets its name because crocodiles can and do produce tears, but not out of emotion as humans do; it's simply a way of getting rid of excessive salt (something that many seabirds also do). 14th-century travel stories had it that they cried to draw in their prey, or as a false show of guilt or grief over the prey they were eating, and the usage has carried over to human displays of false tears over the years.

This trope is not limited to _just_ the Manipulative Bastard, however. Children "crying" to get what they want is Truth in Television. (See #6 on the Cracked list Six Shockingly Evil Things Babies Are Capable Of.)

The Psychopathic Manchild and Annoying Younger Sibling can be prone to this.

Often a key part of a Wounded Gazelle Gambit, especially if the tears make them look more attractive. Contrast Stepford Smiler. Compare Mistaken for Brooding. Contrast Humanizing Tears.

    Advertising 

-   Bel Vita Breakfast Biscuits has a commercial titled "Susan's Morning Win." It included successfully fake-crying to get out of a speeding ticket. She even peeked through her fingers to see if the officer was falling for it.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Kokinchan from _Anpanman_ constantly uses these. As an added bonus, if other people are hit by her tears, they'll start crying uncontrollably. She's a little girl, so she uses these to get what she wants, or just to get other people to start crying. When her needs are satisfied, she'll stop crying at the drop of a hat.
-   A Filler Villain in _Fist of the North Star_, Galzus, used this as his defining act of cruelty, tricking his opponent into dropping their guard by claiming that he had a sister that Souther had kidnapped and then killing them. Naturally, Kenshiro wasn’t fooled (and by that time he’d already hit some of Galzus' power points, resulting in Galzus being blown up anyway).
-   In _Great Teacher Onizuka_, Urumi uses these to manipulate adults, especially Uchiyamada.
-   In _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood_, Dio Brando sheds such tears while pretending to be remorseful over poisoning Jonathan's father. He tearfully begs for forgiveness in an attempt to lure Jonathan close enough to stab him with a hidden dagger. The tactic almost works. However, Jonathan's friend Speedwagon sees through Dio's trick and warns Jonathan in time. Dio is quick to drop the act once confronted.
    -   This act is pulled off again by Esidisi in _Battle Tendency_ in an effort to get a cheap shot in on Joseph.
-   _Kaiju Girl Caramelise_: Seina starts crying in front of Arata when lamenting how much she looked forward to getting a TV spot on the news program that Arata got onto instead. It's clear from her immediate, tear-free demand afterward that Arata put in a good word about her to the show's producer and her glee over Arata's naivete after he leaves that it was a ruse to manipulate him.
-   Kanna did this on her first day of school in _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ in order to get Saikawa to drop her Tsundere act and become friends with her. She dropped the act when Saikawa offered her some candy.
-   Quoted word for word in episode 37 of _Motto_ _Ojamajo Doremi_. In this case, Onpu was using these to try and lure out the fairies who had begun a rebellion and were refusing to leave the Recipe Diary and thus block progress.
-   This trope is referenced in _Ouran High School Host Club_, as all the male hosts seem to cry at the drop of a hat, in order to create 'emotional' scenes. Haruhi soon stumbles onto the explanation: they all use eyedrops to induce tears, though Tamaki claims he doesn't—a true host can cry on command without needing such aid! However, towards the end of that episode, Haruhi accidentally pushes Tamaki into some fairly drastic action with some surprising tears, which turn out to be caused by a loose contact lens.
-   An episode of _Paranoia Agent_ features an Internet suicide pact between two men who are shocked to discover that their third member is a little girl. When they decide to leave her behind, she tries to guilt-trip them by crying, even though there are no visible tears.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   In _Pokémon Adventures_, Green turns on fake tears when confronted by Ho-oh.
    -   Also in _Adventures_, there is a literal case as one of White's agency Pokémon, a Sandile, has the specific purpose for crying for any tragic movie scene.
    -   In the anime, a Teddiursa pulls this by framing Chikorita and Totodile for stealing food and beating it up. Actually, said Pokémon were trying to stop it. But when Teddiursa tries this with Bulbasaur, Ash and his friends don't fall for it this time.
    -   Also in the anime, Shamus reveals he uses this tactic whenever he abandons a Pokémon so that they'll leave him alone.

    Comic Books

Her groupmate Ai appears and tells off the teen, in front of his mother at that, and Lily decides to shed some crocodile tears to make herself look even more hurt.
    
    "Well," Ai continued with a convincing frown. "It's just that \[your son has\] been saying the most awful things to my friend here." She moved to Lily's side and put an arm around her as if comforting her.  
    Having picked up on the direction as soon as Ai started talking, Lily had already worked up a batch of crocodile tears and put on her best pout. She gripped her skirt tightly with one hand and rubbed her cheek roughly with the other, looking down as her shoulders shuddered. It was an incredibly sad sight to see a little girl cry and it was an even worse feeling to be told that your child caused it.

We'll just droop these jowls a bit, okay. Just drag this frown down here. Yeah, just really make this woman look like a rotting misery pumpkin. We'll take the soft brush here and add in a few tears. _\[the result is that the woman looks cartoonishly miserable, with over-the-top tears exploding from the side of her face\]_ And I've gone ahead and done that for the rest of these people as well... whoops, got a little smudge there! Let's take care of that real quick. _\[he draws a box around a soldier pointing a gun at these mourners; with a button press, the gun is replaced with a cat\]_ Great. Everything's great.
