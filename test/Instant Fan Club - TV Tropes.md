_"Ahh, fan clubs. Sweet, innocent, restraining-order-inducing fan clubs."_

A character is considered so awesome that not only do they have notable admirers, but their fans become so organized that they are also the character's personal assistants, chauffeurs, and army. They will follow their idol 24/7, always available whenever there is need, but otherwise politely remaining just off-screen.

If the character is sufficiently cool this may happen practically overnight (i.e., within a few episodes of them being introduced), although the subject of admiration typically has mixed feelings about the entire affair.

If an ojou or an Alpha Bitch has one, these are typically her minions (and may form a Girl Posse). This points out a major feature of the fan club; they don't necessarily have to be close friends, and the idol may not even like them.

Note that this is in fact an aspect of Japanese culture — fan clubs of this type can and do form spontaneously around particularly popular and/or successful students in Japanese high schools. Contrast The Paid-For Harem.

Not to be confused with producing a Paper Fan of Doom from Hammerspace, or the actual fan club of the same name started by They Might Be Giants.

    Anime & Manga 

-   High school sports start Aizawa Suguru in _Area no Kishi_ is nearly always hounded by throngs of squealing fan-girls whenever he's at school.
-   Sakaki acquires one at the beginning of her second year in _Azumanga Daioh_, but they don't really figure into the plot beyond a quick scene. On the other hand, Kaorin might constitute a "Sakaki fan club" all by herself.
-   Each of the nine prince/ princesses in _Castle Town Dandelion_ has this. Episode 4B/ Chapter 6 deals with Akane's.
-   In _Cells NOT at Work!_, 328 has a fan club for Macrophages; among its members are a Red Blood Cell (DW7310), a Neutrophil (2310), and an unnamed Erythroblast.

-   Fuuko's fanboys in _CLANNAD_, whom she gains when Tomoya and Nagisa teach her how to make friends. Hilariously, she then uses them as a defense mechanism by summoning them (by whistling) to carry off Sunohara when he's annoying her. "PROTECT FUUKO-CHAN!!!!"
-   Motoko Minagawa's "Prince Yuki" Club in _Fruits Basket_. The club started almost as soon as Yuki entered his first year of high school, and it's stated that over half of the school's female population are members.
-   Haruto Sakuraba from _Eyeshield 21_ is frequently harassed by mobs of girls who are members of his fan club. After he gives up being a teen idol to focus on football (and, in the process, abandons his clean-cut pretty-boy look by growing a beard and getting a buzzcut), most of them drop out.
-   In the first episode of _Haruka Nogizaka's Secret_, we're treated with one for the titular character, who proceed to clobber the male protagonist for chasing her, even though it's just to clear up some misunderstanding.

-   _Hime-chan's Ribbon_:
    -   Daichi and Kouichi get one. Daichi's club causing direct trouble for Hime-chan when the rumours of them dating start spreading around. At least the main leaders of said group have badges with his face on it.
    -   Sei gets a fan club the very same day he transfers to the school, with members from the other clubs instantly switching to his.
-   While not prominent, both Arima and Miyazaki develop them early on in _His and Her Circumstances_. One arc deals with what happens when Yukino's turns against her.
-   Kaguya from _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ has an unofficial fanclub consisting of Karen and Erika (they admit that it's not a real club, it's just something that they like to call themselves), though she is unaware of their existance for the most part. Hayasaka ends up getting roped in to joining when they mistakenly believe that she's a fellow Kaguya fan.
-   _Kamen no Maid Guy_ has an even more specific variation. Naeka has a fan club for her breasts. Not her, her breasts.

-   In _Kamisama Kiss_ both Kurama and Tomoe get one the minute they start attending Nanami's school.
-   About half of the school instantly becomes Nagi's fanclub/bodyguards in _Kannagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens_. Nagi even has her own webpage and a good balance of male and female fans. Her good looks and comical personality wouldn't be enough to explain this ordinarily, but it may be a Justified Trope if you add in the speculation that a Physical Goddess would naturally draw followers.
-   _Kitsune no Yomeiri_:
    -   After revealing that she and Ousake are married Kyouka gets a fanclub, the Kyouka Groupies, who are dedicated to splitting them up.
    -   When she transfers in Kanon's plan was to create a bigger fan club than Kyouka's but decided to go a different route after her true personality came out.

-   The males at the school in _My Bride is a Mermaid_ are divided into two militant, warring fan clubs over San and Luna. Luna personally leads _her_ club in efforts to take over the school. Mawari is left leading an equally-violent third club comprised of the girls, united under "restoring order" with the motto "All men are beasts."
-   The all-male fan club that worships a pretty nurse on the Nautilus, in _Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water_.
-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_'s Magic World arc, Negi and Kotaro enter a tournament and become celebrities, complete with legions of fangirls.
-   The Zuka Club in _Ouran High School Host Club_, especially Benio Amakusa ("Benibara"), have their own legion of screaming fans, who are organized, drilled, and kept disciplined (with the threat of massive violence) by officers of the Benibara Society.
    -   A less obvious but more prevalent example: the fans of the Host Club itself. Perhaps they were once a loosely-related group of fangirly teenagers, but they organized fast, especially once Renge took the lead. She even made Host Club doujinshi.
-   The second episode of _Paranoia Agent_, "Golden Shoes," revolves around a sixth grade boy's Instant Fan Club and the pressure he feels to keep up appearances.
-   Gary Oak in _Pokémon: The Series_ had one in the form of a group of cheerleaders who followed him _everywhere_ in the first season.
-   Used straight and subverted in _The Prince of Tennis_. Subverted: Tomoka Osakada does her best to create and form a fanclub for Ryoma Echizen but in the end she and Sakuno are pretty much the only stable members. Played straight: Wakato's fangirls from the Jyousei Shounan arc and the Rikkaidai cheerleaders. And there's no forgetting Atobe's _army_ of fangirls, who can become even _violent_ towards the main girl of the Dating Sim _Gakuensai no Oujisama_ if you have her befriending Atobe.
-   Fakir and Mytho of _Princess Tutu_ also have been mentioned to have their own fan clubs. Pique is part of Fakir's fanclub and Lilie is presumably part of Mytho's group.
-   In _Ranma ½_, much to Akane Tendo's despair, she has a fanclub in the beginning of the series. After Tatewaki Kuno said that the Furinkan guys would have to beat her in combat to date her, _many_ guys from the sport teams would wait for her every morning at the school gates to try beat her up, and she had to defeat _every single one_ to go to class. They didn't give up until they learnt that Ranma not only was Akane's fiancé, but he had defeated Kuno in a fight.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ shows that Utena is extremely popular for her Bifauxnen qualities and all of the female students address her as "Utena-sama". To the point where photos of her acting feminine (due to a Body Swap with the extremely feminine Anthy) start selling like hot cakes.

-   _Rosario + Vampire_'s first season has Moka, Kurumu and Yukari having three "fanclubs" made up of lame fanboy stalkers who cause more harm than good. By the second season, they (and Mizore) have developed large, screaming mostly _female_ fanclubs.
    -   This is case is most particularly bizarre in Yukari's case as in Episode 3 (her debut), she is shown to be hated by the entire student body. Then the fanclub guys are introduced _the very next episode._ While just as abrupt in the manga, the greater emphasis on the pervasive nature of school bullying (most of the students don't dare express themselves) maybe makes it work better: she becomes more outgoing and publicly visible to the school as the people who would be breaking such a fan club up stop.
-   _SHUFFLE!_ parodies this rather sharply. The fanclubs have even carried over into real life, with all the seriousness of Ship-to-Ship Combat - their object of affection might be a psycho, but _don't_ say this in front of members of _Kitto Kitto Kaede_!
-   Rukawa's admirers in _Slam Dunk_, complete with bandannas with his name, and the propensity to transform into an instant cheerleading club when in actual games.
-   There's one for Tsukasa in _Strawberry 100%_, who won't even allow her one-time-and-possibly-again-depending-on-how-the-plot-unfolds semi-boyfriend talk to her without him disguising as one of them and slipping through the crowd. It's a rather organized fanclub at that, complete with identification numbers and hierarchy.
-   _Urusei Yatsura_:
    -   The hot alien girl Lum has a group of fanboys called Lum's Stormtroopers.
    -   The handsome rich boy Mendou has his own army of fangirls.
-   Duke Devlin gets one in his first appearance in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, and three of them become his cheerleading squad for the next few episodes. They disappear when Duke joins the True Companions.

     Comic Books 

-   _The Legend of Wonder Woman (2016)_: Superheroes are only just appearing in the world but Etta mentions that her little brother Mint is already a member of a JSA fanclub.
-   Also pre-Crisis, Robin, whilst attending Hudson University as Dick Grayson, had his own on-campus fan-club, and occasionally attended meetings of the self named (at least one hopes so) Robin-Rooters, whose members were mostly female, but not exclusively so. They even designed new costumes for him, which they then had made up for him to wear, which he did.
-   In the Silver Age, Jimmy Olsen had a club of bowtie-wearing dweebs who hung on his every word. As creepy as it sounds.
    -   Besides the Jimmy Olsen Fan Club, there was also (in Bronze Age comics) the _Clark Kent_ Fan Club, consisting of female fans of Clark (from his WGBS evening newscasts).

     Fanfiction 

-   In _Fluffy Hero Izuku_, Izuku recalls the time a fan club of his had formed because his efforts at cleaning Dagobah Beach had inspired many people. Izuku, however, found the fan club to be _less_ than helpful due to the fact that cleaning up the beach was part of his training, and receiving help would have negated that.
-   The _Ranma ½_ fanfic _Girl Days_ has fun with this. When Ranma starts attending Furinkan High as a girl as part of the Girl Days training, a bunch of fan clubs almost immediately break out. One, the Ranma-chan club, is a group of girls devoted to Ranma remaining a girl; another, the Ranma-kun club, are girls who want their male Ranma back, no matter the cost. A third, a group of guys, have deluded themselves into thinking Ranma will go out on a date with them. Ranma and her friends simply call this club 'The Idiots'. And once Shampoo starts attend school as well, she gets her own fan club.
-   In _The home-trip._, after Peter's parentage becomes public knowledge, a group of boys crowd around him asking if he wanted to see a movie with them. Peter sees right through it and pretends they aren't there.
-   _Pony POV Series_: After Princess Gaia's rule, Fluttershy results in getting a sizable following due to how much it healed many ponies. Her popularity as a fashion model not withstanding.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Deconstructed in _The Magnificent Seven_ — the mob of kids who follow Bernardo O'Reilly around everywhere end up getting him killed as they wander out into a gunfight and he tries to get them into cover.
-   In the 2011 film _Warrior_: Tommy gets one on the second day of the tournament.

    Literature 

-   During _Dinoverse_, Alpha Bitch Candacye Chambers is put into the body of a small dinosaur called a Leptoceratops, much to her dismay. Other, real Leptoceratops take a great interest in her and follow her wherever she goes, trying to feed and groom her. Reminded of when guys would flock around her human body she assumes it's this trope and nicknames them the Leptomaniacs. While this is a factor, it's largely because they are concerned about the company she's keeping and would like her to be safe.
-   _The Empirium Trilogy_: Soon after Ludivine's dramatic entrance during Rielle's anointing, a group calling themselves the House of the Second Sun formed. They're obsessed with Rielle and how she (apparently) brought Ludivine back from the dead. Group activities include reenactments of Ludivine's death, resurrection, and reappearance.
-   In _Kämpfer_, there is the "Mistress Shizuku, Please Violate Me" club, which is briefly mentioned but never shown.
-   In _Mayo Chiki!_, Subaru has an all-female fanclub. It undergoes a schism as some members don't object to Jiro's (alleged) relationship with Subaru, while others do.

    Live Action TV 

-   A one-episode character of _The 4400_ gets an _extreme_ version of a fan club, who actually worship him, as part of being the Monster of the Week.

-   _Doctor Who_ combines this with several other tropes but the cult of Saxon is dedicated to resurrect their former prime-minister through human sacrifices.
    -   A lighter example is the "London Investigations 'N Detective Agency" a.k.a "LINDA" who make it their business to track down the Doctor... mostly because they are huge fans of his adventures, so wind up being more of a fan club. The Doctor is aware of them and even though they established themselves mostly by looking for his Tenth Incarnation he's been aware of them since at least his Fifth. He mostly finds them annoying.
-   In _Kamen Rider Decade_, in one of the worlds the group visits, Tsukasa is scouted while walking down the street and becomes a male model, gaining a following of fangirls with screen-printed clothing and signs. While this sort of thing isn't unusual for a handsome celebrity, it's implied that this took place _in a day or two_.
    -   Even worse, since this is the Nega World, all the fangirls are actually monsters in human form, which makes the cold and jealous way they glare at Natsumi when Tsukasa says he knows her all the more scary.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Exalted_, this is represented with the Followers merit. And if you're someone from the Underworld, your fan club can consists of _ghosts_.

    Video Games 

-   _Ar tonelico II: Melody of Metafalica_ provides something just a touch more realistic. It takes time for Reine to build the Cloche fan club but otherwise they fit perfectly. They tell people how great Cloche is, protect her in battle, and provide the energy for Replakia.
-   _Doodle World_: Portia makes one for Quincy in order to replace the lack of attention from his father.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy VIII_ featured this with Quistis Trepe, the youngest instructor in the history of the school. In the American translation they are called "Trepies."
    -   In _Final Fantasy VII Remake_, a Cloud Strife Fan Club emerges after he and Aerith start winning at the Colosseum. (Led by Akila, the enka singer in the Wall Market drinking pit.) Aerith starts getting gifts of flowers from an unseen florist named Watanabe.

-   Delsin Rowe in _inFAMOUS: Second Son_ gains a (mostly) female fan club shortly after starting his campaign against the D.U.P. in Seattle. They call themselves the "Rowe-mantics"

-   _Persona 3_ has two senpais in the main cast. Akihiko, the male senpai, is shown early on to attract squealing hordes of fangirls with minimal effort (or desire). Mitsuru Kirijo's otaku are a lot more subtle, but the player can find any number of NPCs that all fantasize about attracting her attention, especially one that just plain fantasizes about anything Mitsuru does or could potentially do to her.
-   The _Pokémon_ games will give you your own personal fan club after meeting certain requirements like beating the Elite Four and catching all Pokémon.
-   Miyabi from _Senran Kagura_ has this due to her Bifauxnen looks (despite the fact she is very well endowed in a World of Buxom), who call themselves the "I ❤ Miyabi Militia" and is the circle of fangirls that Miyabi has to constantly deal with.
-   _Twisted Wonderland_: Vil Schoenheit has been a world-famous actor, model and influencer since a young age, and so in his first year of high school, he earned himself an admiring crowd of other students.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   In _Noob_ there is a guild called Gaea Admirers that formed for the sole purpose of helping out Gaea, whom they believe to be a Double Agent loyal to the Coalition, while Gaea herself in the Empire. The recurring character among them, Meuhmeuh, tends to appear out of nowhere if he considers Gaea needs his help. They give Gaea a place to go when she does an opportunistic Face Heel Turn.
-   In _Survival of the Fittest_ V4, Reiko Ishida got one of these due to her success in ice skating, often referred to as her "entourage". Bit of a subversion, though, as, unlike most characters that have found themselves in this trope, she's actually quite close friends with them.
-   In the Whateley Universe, teenager Fey is horrified to find out that she has a fan club of girls her own age. Her teammates on her super-team tease her about it now and then.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   Speaking of sexy princes, Prince Zuko gets a sudden audience of blushing girls (complete with floating hearts!) when he takes off his shirt in the Beach Episode.
    -   Aang gets one when he visits Kyoshi village for the first time. In fact, Aang gets a share of fans in every place he goes to. This becomes a plot point in the after-series comics, where he decides that, rather than wasting their devotion on nothing, he would teach his fans all he knows about Air Nomad culture. By the time _The Legend of Korra_ rolls around, the fan club has transformed into the Air Acolytes, a group of non-bender people who live by the ways of the Air Nomads, making them just as much a part of the nation as Aang's airbender son and grandchildren are.
-   The Three Js (Joey, Jeffy and Jamie) who hung on Quinn Morgendorfer's every word in _Daria_.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_: In the episode "Dadbra-Cadabra", after Mr. Turner's magic act is a huge success, he is instantly a huge hit and has many fans. As a one-off joke, he is followed home by a huge mob of screaming fangirls who try to barge into the Turners' house by breaking into a window. Luckily, Mrs. Turner is able to stop them by boarding them up.
-   Supergirl attracts one of these during a trip to Japan in the _Justice League Unlimited_ episode "Chaos at the Earth's Core", which makes Stargirl extremely jealous.
-   In _Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo_, Beast Boy gains a literally instant fan club when the Titans go to Japan after he wows a horde of Japanese school girls at a local arcade. The one he's after, however, turns out to be an evil catgirl ink monster.
