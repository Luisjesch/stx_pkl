"If you want to have friends, be one."

_We're not here to freak you out.  
We just came to shake it down.  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, flip up your hands.  
The ghosts just wanna dance!  
Only want to haunt your igloo,  
Give you chills, and party with you.  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, flip up your hands.  
The ghosts just wanna dance!_

As You Know, ghosts are _scary_. Perhaps it is the thought of the soul of the dead that doesn't _stay_ dead, perhaps it's because nonliving things aren't supposed to move on their own, or perhaps the afterlife doesn't like them. Whatever the case, we think ghosts are out to harm us, and thus they tend to be portrayed as actively hostile. Not to mention how we attribute our bad luck or strange things happening in a place to mischievous ghosts, and how ghosts have a reputation of being vengeful or liking to possess someone.

Friendly Ghosts ain't any of those. They're friendly, helpful, and will talk to anyone. They may or may not be frightening in looks, which may strain their friendly nature. This can show that ghosts are Not Always Evil.

The Trope Namer is Casper the Friendly Ghost, who is also the Trope Codifier. Can lead to an Otherworldly Communication Failure when characters fail to recognize a ghost's benign nature.

Subtrope of Our Ghosts Are Different. Compare Chummy Mummy, Friendly Neighborhood Vampire, Friendly Skeleton, Friendly Zombie, Wonderful Werewolf, Don't Fear the Reaper, Guardian Entity, Silly Spook, and Cute Ghost Girl. Contrast Ghastly Ghost.

-   _Carnival in a Fix_: The ghosts who work in the Haunted House are all quite friendly, only scaring people because it's their job. The most prominent one is See-Through George, who holds a stuffed penguin for most of the book.

-   In the _Goosebumps_ book "The Ghost Next Door", the main character suspects that her neighbor is a ghost, due to the fact that he's lived next door for a while and yet she and her family don't remember anybody moving into that house, the fact that they've both been going to the same school for a while and are in the same grade yet neither knows any of the others friends and the fact that the neighbor seems to keep randomly disappearing. While he does cause trouble when he's around his friends (who coerce him into causing trouble), he is a generally good kid.

-   _Greywalker_, Harper Blaine's close friends Ben and Mara Danzinger live with a ghost Albert, who they believe to be a harmless former boarder from the '20s who died of bad hooch.

    -   Moaning Myrtle is a Jerk with a Heart of Gold version.
-   Oreg in the _Hurog_ duology. Despite being a slave to the head of the family, he has some freedom in being nice or mean to other members of the family. He seems to have Big Brother Instinct towards the daughter of the family, and makes life difficult for relatives who mistreat her.
-   _Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation: Mo Dao Zu Shi_ has A-Qing, a somewhat Vengeful Ghost who stuck around to protect unsuspecting visitors from the Serial Killer who murdered her, her Parental Substitute, and his best friend, and to make sure he was brought to justice.

-   In Lois McMaster Bujold's Historical Fantasy novel _The Spirit Ring_ the ghost of Prospero Beneforte isn't precisely what you would call _friendly_—Beneforte was a proud and rather irascible man in life—but he is helpful (and even ultimately loving) to the protagonists, who include his daughter, and whose first word when he first appears to her is "Papa?".
    
    **When Prospero Beneforte's ghost first manifests to his daughter:** _I'm glad to see you_....Weren't ghosts supposed to be fearful manifestations, instilling terror? But Master Beneforte looked so...himself. Impatient and annoyed, as ever.
    
-   King Verence and King Champot in _Wyrd Sisters_. Verence seeks vengeance on his murderer, but when he's not doing that is very polite and charming. Champot is the oldest ghost in the castle and helpfully explains to Verence what the rules are.

-   _Homestuck_'s "dream bubbles" are full of ghosts, who can visit players in their sleep, or physically if players physically pass through the bubbles. They tend to be pretty kind, sometimes due to being AU versions of players' friends, and sometimes because they still act by their pre-death nature.
-   _My Life as a Background Slytherin_: In stark contrast to his canon portrayal, the Bloody Baron is depicted as a rather amicable (and eloquent) ghost, at least with Slytherin students. However, he puts on a Monster Façade, complete with Nightmare Face, towards the other students.
-   _Scandinavia and the World_. Denmark flips out upon meeting a tiny, adorable ghost, but Greenland reminds him that many ghosts are helpful, and asks the ghost for its purpose. Turns out it's actually terrifying after all, it drinks your beer!
-   _Undead Friend_ is full of these, as all ghosts are allowed to make friends with a human in order to be seen.
-   _Unsounded_:
    -   Timofey is a ghost mostly formed from the khert sounded memories of a poet, and those of Bastion's dead sister. He's quite friendly and aids children when he can, though his morals are a bit odd at times given that Bastion is his master.
    -   Squishes are ghosts formed from happy and good memories, and though they rarely leave the khert they are generally kind if a bit mischievous when they do.
-   _Wilde Life_: Sylvia the ghost has been unfriendly in the past when she didn't like the tenants. When she likes them, she is not only friendly but helpful: finding lost items, making sure the porch light was on when it was dark, making sure they never woke up late for work or school. She is friendly to the current tenant of the house, who reciprocated once he realized she was amicable.

-   _BlastphamousHD_: From his BHD Storytime series, Maurice recounts the time he used to live in a haunted house as a child. He recalls the sensation of being watched from within the kitchen when he slept on the couch every night, and he comes across an old picture of a young Amish girl inside the crawl-in attic. This seems to border on Stalker with a Crush territory, which is further emphasized by the fact that once the effects of NyQuil are beaten by the ghost girl, her stalking presence allows Maurice to notice the next-door House Fire only five feet away and get his family out of the house. The firefighter says he's unsure as to how Maurice woke up, but his family would've died of smoke inhalation if he had gotten up a mere 5-10 minutes later, meaning that the ghost girl helped saved his family's life.
-   _The Cry of Mann_: Ghost Lady is a friendly, well-meaning ghost that has no ill-intentions towards the Mann family.
-   _Dream SMP_: Ghostbur, the ghost of Wilbur Soot, is extremely friendly, and trusting to a fault. The fact that he can't retain any negative memories contributes to his cheerful, childlike personality, and it says something about him that the only thing that has ever made him genuinely angry is his father, Philza, helping Techno and Dream carpet-bomb his home into the ground, killing his pet sheep Friend in the process, and showing zero remorse when Ghostbur confronts him.
-   _Unwanted Houseguest_: The spirit of the Owl Head Lighthouse Keeper helps the Houseguest defeat the Shadow Demon.

-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_: Carrie is "Emo" (although she's really more of a goth) but she's still one of the more friendly characters.
-   _Beetlejuice_: In stark contrast to his villainous movie self. Here, instead of terrorizing the Deetzes, he's Lydia's best friend, and while he's mischievous and likes to play tricks on her family, he also protects them from any real danger.
-   Warner Bros. created a Casper rip-off in the form of Spooky, a one-shot character in the Cool Cat cartoon "Big Game Haunt."
-   _Casper the Friendly Ghost_ is the trope namer and codifier. Where the other ghosts are spooky and really mischievous, Casper just wants friends and is very polite and kind. Somewhat deconstructed (comically) in that most people are still terrified at the mere sight of ghosts like him even if he tried his darnedest not to be frightening, and so he only makes a few friends, but they all love Casper very much.
-   The ghosts in _City of Ghosts_ are friendly with Zelda and her friends.
-   _Danny Phantom_:
    -   This show has The Dairy King. The Dairy King outright says not all ghosts are evil and helps the protagonist. All he wants is to be left alone in peace.
    -   Hell, Danny Phantom himself qualifies. Although he possesses the power to become a ghost (beings that tend to be the source of most misfortune in the Danny Phantom universe), he is generally a pretty outgoing, Book Dumb kid who can be a bit of a Butt-Monkey. Being a growing-up teenager, though, he still can sometimes be a prankster.
-   _Dude, That's My Ghost!_: The "ghost" Billy Joe Cobra was a famous pop star when he was alive, died of unknown reasons, and as the ghost he is right now, he's a chatty, friendly, humourous guy that gets along _very well_ with his closest friend Spencer. His only flaws are his ego and vanity but those are mostly Played for Laughs.
-   In _Mike Tyson Mysteries,_ the ghost of the Marquess of Queensbury convinced Mike Tyson to become a (relatively) peaceful person, and he hangs out as a member of Mike's mystery-solving team. Oddly, the fact that he's dead doesn't actually come up that often in the episodes.
-   _Frankelda's Book of Spooks_ has the titular Frankelda. Although it's clear she has ulterior motives for the viewers cooperation in listening to her tales? She's very bubbly and excited, always happy to share her stories with the audience. In the final episode she even warns the viewer to save themselves from Porcustes as she goes back to the house to save Herneval.
-   Jonathan "Mudsy" Muddlemore from _The Funky Phantom_ by Hanna-Barbera died a coward while hiding in a standing clock from British soldiers during the American Revolution. Augie, Skip, and April awaken Mudsy's ghost from the clock when they cause it to chime. Mudsy is still cowardly, but affable and polite while visible.
-   Johnny B. Dead from _Monster by Mistake_ is a wise-cracking trumpet-playing ally to the human heroes.
-   Several friendly ghosts appear in the _Monster High_ franchise, one movie has an entire school of friendly ghosts.
-   As part of their Adaptational Heroism, the four members of the Ghost Gang from _Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures_ are Pac-Man's friends who serve as moles who warn Pac of many of Betrayus' schemes.
-   _A Pup Named Scooby-Doo_: In "Ghost Who's Coming To Dinner," Bartholomew Byfard Boo is, to the team's surprise, a real ghost, and a friendly one. A rather small fellow with a voice like Droopy's, he's actually the one who hires the gang to catch the Monster of the Week, who is trying to coerce the homeowners of the old house Mr. Boo haunts into selling. Because if the house is destroyed, Mr. Boo will poof out of existence.
-   _The Real Ghostbusters_: Slimer is one of these, acting as their Team Pet and Plucky Comic Relief.
-   Nugget Nose, the Galloping Ghost from _Yogi's Space Race_, was generally friendly unless overtaken with gold fever.
