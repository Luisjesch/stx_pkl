This is why you don't want to take the Atoner for granite.

_"Long is the way, and hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light."_

Once, there was a major villain named Bob. He committed every crime one could think of, and he did it with a song in his heart and a skip in his step. Then, something happened to make him _see_ the horror of what he was doing. He realized how much pain he had caused, and he set out on a personal quest to try to make it right.

The Atoner is an evil character who has realized the error of his ways, possibly wants to make amends, and has decided that they will do so via heroic deeds. Simple imprisonment won't do, because it does nothing to make recompense for what he's done wrong. Besides, he still has all these amazing skills and resources from the Bad Old Days — wouldn't it be better to use them for good?

The problem is, Bob often has to wrestle with the temptation to return to his old ways, along with the massive guilt built up over years of carefree evil. Also, said previous villain skills usually involve killing people in very messy ways, which can result in karmically harmful situations. Other times Bob's evil side won't go down without a fight, and manifests itself as an Enemy Within. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that morality isn't a book that can be balanced — no amount of babies saved now will bring Bob's past victims back to life. The Atoner usually realizes that "Redemption is the path, not the destination" thanks to The Redeemer and continues for the rest of his life.

Sometimes 'the rest of his life' is short because Redemption Equals Death. Generally the only Atoners who avoid this are main characters who are already in the atoning stage by the series' start. Atoners often end up as Knights in Sour Armor. Those who believe redemption _inherently_ equals death may well become Death Seekers.

A subtrope of this is "Assassin Wants to Quit". Stories involving them allow us to cheer on the assassin as they battle their former employers using the same murderous skills they honed during their previous career. Atoners sometimes go on a Redemption Quest in order to atone. If their deed of atonement is especially painful, it may overlap with The Penance.

Would-be Atoners who are not sincere are trying to Buy Them Off. Not to be confused with The Aloner, though they can both coincide if the character is trying to atone for killing off everyone else on the planet. And _especially_ not to be confused with The Stoner (unless they turned to drugs to cope with their guilt). The Atoner may face rejection and hatred from those who don't believe he's reformed, which is Reformed, but Rejected, and more importantly, he must be careful not to run into the Heel–Face Door-Slam. In some instances, however, there are characters who will acknowledge The Atoner's change of heart, but do so in a grudging manner. The Atoner must also beware of one character who actively seeks to end his path to redemption.

The success rate of atoners depends on where the work sits on the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism. In more idealistic works, or at least ones that posit that people can change for the better, atoners may have a greater chance of success, as proof that no matter one's actions may have been in the past, it's always possible to change for the better and do good.

Genuine atoners have a high chance of becoming The Woobie, especially if they were an Anti-Villain in the first place. See also, Be All My Sins Remembered, where they continue to suffer a guilt complex over their past misdeeds. Contrast with My Greatest Failure — instead of a formerly evil character turning from their past, a good character feels the need to atone for not preventing a bad outcome (regardless of whether they could have changed anything), and Retired Monster — a villain who has retired from their villainy but hasn't shown any regret or remorse for their misdeeds nor has made any attempt to redeem themselves. The Atoner may have experienced Go and Sin No More, and may enact a Self-Punishment Over Failure or have a Guilt-Induced Nightmare.

    Mythology 

-   Heracles in Greek Mythology did this a _lot_. Because he didn't know his own strength, he was always accidentally killing or severely maiming people. At one point this got so bad that the citizens of Athens refused to accept him into the city until his buddy/cousin Theseus vouched for him. Hercules, however, kept trying to convince his friend that the citizens were right. In fact his famous twelve labors were atonement for when he killed his wife and children (though to be fair it was because Hera cursed him with temporary insanity). Another time he was forced to work as a man-servant for a woman for several years. While wearing a dress.

-   The Loyalists of Thule in _Hunter: The Vigil_ have an Ancient Conspiracy\-wide Guilt Complex, and it rubs off on its members. Why? Oh, nothing, they just helped the Nazis in World War II and they largely believe themselves responsible for the Holocaust as a result. Yeah, they have issues.
-   One of the two main paths for Abyssal _Exalted_ is to become this, make up for their dark deeds in the service of the Void and work their asses off to avoid spontaneously combusting from Resonance.

-   _Pathfinder_
    -   Here's a canonical tale: Some years before the setting's current time, a fourteen-year-old Street Urchin named Seelah stole a paladin's helm, intending to pawn it for food money. The paladin, Acemi, was so kind she let Seelah get away with it, thinking the girl's poverty was such that she needed the helm more than Acemi. Of course, Acemi was there as part of a force fighting to save Seelah's home town from gnolls; Acemi died in the fighting from blow to the head. Seelah, consumed with guilt, returned the helm with the intent to commit suicide on the paladin's funeral pyre. Instead, she was taken in by the order and became the iconic paladin.

-   In _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Dark Angels are a Space Marines chapter that refers to themselves as the Unforgiven, because during the Horus Heresy a portion of their force turned traitor out of pride or confusion.

-   _Monster Prom_: Coach took his job as a PE teacher and coach at a high school to break with his father, who earned a fortune as a spokesman for nutritionally-bankrupt breakfast cereal.
-   This is a running theme in the _Parascientific Escape_ series. The villain of each game realizes their evil and attempts to make up for it. In fact, the villains of the first two games turn themselves in to jail and do go on trial! Misaki, villain of the first game, is found Not Guilty due to coercion and is allowed to go free. Tsukiko, villain of the second, is guilty but is eventually allowed to live under house arrest on the grounds she serves as a spy for Yukiya.
-   _The Fruit of Grisaia_:

    -   Yumiko's father Michiaki becomes this after being defeated, wondering where his life went utterly wrong and realising that he can no longer feel empathy for the people he hurt.
-   Deconstructed with Valerian Trifa from _Dies Irae_. Back when he was just a kindly priest, he attempted to run away from the madness of the Longinus Dreizehn Orden alongside the orphan children he cared for. Unfortunately, Reinhard found him and as punishment forced Trifa to pick ten of the children to be executed right in front of him. This lead to him blaming himself for their deaths due to being weak and unable to protect them in the face of adversity and vows to make amends. This vow however becomes an obsession and ends up making him blind to just how wicked he has become by the start of the story and to how flawed and nonsensical his idea of atonement really is.
-   _Piofiore: Fated Memories_ As an otome game about the mafia, this trope is rampant.
    -   Henri Lambert struggles greatly over the murders he has committed and the implication of what it means for him to continue to live. He does not believe he can ever be forgiven for his crimes and believes he should continue to suffer because of what he has done in the past. He does feel great guilt over subjecting the heroine to a life with him, and this serves as one of the main reasons he tries to push the heroine away from him romantically.
    -   Orlok, though he has only killed on the Church's orders (for most of the first game, depending on the ending) he believes he will never go to Heaven. He believes the murders he has committed in the past were necessary and he continues to believe in his role as a Disciple of the Church, but also believes that he can never be forgiven.
    -   Dante Falzone, as the capo of the Falzone family, has committed many crimes and does not believe he will find salvation. However, he does not believe he should change the way he lives.
