"If we’re all gonna try and kill the same guy anyway, it just makes sense to carpool."

_"How do my foes find each other?"_

If a Superhero has a Rogues Gallery, it's an obvious plot for the villains to team up. A Villain Team Up is almost always for the sole purpose of ganging up on a hero or hero team and finishing them off _once... and for all!!!_ Villains will almost never team up to rob a bank together, or commit any other crime together. Usually this is because the typical Rogues Gallery has villains with nothing in common at all, other than hating the hero.

This is also why they lose; unlike the heroic team they fight, the villains never trust each other. One of them _will_ betray the rest of the group. Usually after they've captured the heroes, thus letting the heroes escape. Some heroes can even cause a "solid" Villain Team Up to implode with Flaw Exploitation. For example, one of the villains with a case of Chronic Backstabbing Disorder will show no loyalty nor cooperation with one another. Other times, one of the villains has planned the whole team-up as a trap from the start. Cue An Aesop about The Power of Friendship. This is one of few situations where maintaining the Status Quo is well justified.

A variant is that instead of ganging up, they make the heroes Run the Gauntlet. If they get on reasonably well, they'll compliment each other on their evilness. If conditions are right, they may become a Big Bad Duumvirate. While this is usually a one-shot team up, a Legion of Doom is a recurring team of villains and are a major opposition together. Can easily lead to a Joker Jury situation. When done badly can lead to instant Villain Decay, as the hero trashes six people who each used to be a threat to them on their own. This trope is the opposite of Evil Versus Evil. When a villain teams up with the hero, that's Enemy Mine. When villains from different universes team up and appoint one of their own to lead them, that's Crossover Villain-in-Chief.

Compare Evil Is One Big, Happy Family and Legion of Doom. Contrast Super Team.

However, with his charisma Zigzag is able to convince the alligators to spare his life and help him out of the alligator pit. This impresses the Mighty One-eye enough to let him join him.
-   This more or less happens in Don Bluth's _Thumbelina_ when Stalker with a Crush Determinator Grundel blackmails slimy Jerkass Berkley Beetle to search for the title character.
-   What might be the biggest villain team-up yet in film happens in _The LEGO Batman Movie_ first with The Joker and what is esentially the entire Batman's Rogues Gallery, but then after he escapes from the Phantom Zone he brings back; King Kong, Sauron, Lord Voldemort, the Daleks, the Gremlins, Agent Smith, the Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys, Medusa, the Kraken, the T. rex and Velociraptors, Count Dracula, Jaws, the Mummy, Zod, Skeletons, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon.

-   Villain Team-Ups are a common occurrence in _Red Panda Adventures_. The most prominent in the series is the Red Panda Revenge Squad, consisting of the Crimson Death, the Electric Eel, the Genie, Mordriel the Malevolent, and Professor Zombie. An Alternate Timeline version of this team up successfully killed the Flying Squirrel and information on _how_ is used to sway the main timeline's Red Panda into helping a traveler from that world. When the group eventually forms in the main timeline, they very nearly succeed in defeating the Red Panda despite the mystery man having had years to work out how to beat them. The episode also brings up some of the issues that plague such team-ups, such as Insufferable Geniuses and Large Hams causing clashing egos, past team ups ending on a sour note restricting who to have join.

    Tabletop Games 

-   This was the point of the Vengeance expansion for _Sentinels of the Multiverse_, with Baron Blade uniting a team of minor villains to take out the Freedom Five. More minor villains turned up to join the team with Villains of the Multiverse.

It eventually unravels when Stocking is revealed to be a Well-Intentioned Extremist to minimize consequences, half of the members are killed off or KO'd, and Wilford backstabs the organization and becomes the biggest threat to the world after absorbing Madotsuki's sorrows, forcing the remaining members to team up with Frollo and his allies.
-   _RWBY_: Neo uses Little Miss Malachite's services to track down Cinder, seeking revenge for Roman's death while in Cinder's employment.

Neo stops fighting Cinder when she is given a demonstration of the Fall Maiden's full power, but becomes a little irritated with Cinder's suggestion that they talk it out because she doesn't speak, something Cinder momentarily forgets.

    Webcomics 

-   One story in _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ has Fructose Riboflavin, the Pirates of Ipecac, and Galatea all teaming up, although the pirates are there against their will, and it's arguable that Galatea doesn't really understand what's going on.
-   The Hat and Robo-Cube in _Stickman and Cube_, although this is more of a hostile takeover on The Hat's part.
-   At the climax of _Everyone Is Home_'s Sephiroth arc, Sephiroth brings an army of video game villains to wipe out the other Smash fighters. The team-up lasts until the Phantom Thieves (and Kirby) use their respective Heel–Face Brainwashing techniques on Sephiroth, at which point the villains lose their respect for him and go home.
-   As it's based on the _Mega Man X_ series (specifically the game mentioned above), this happens in _Burning Stickman Presents...Something!_, with a third villain, original to the comic actually being the one to put Sigma and Wily together. Naturally, all three are planning to betray the hell out of each other, though to their credit, they're planning to do it _after_ the Evil Plan plays out.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   The team of Lord Xykon and Redcloak started off as this. The prequel shows that the two first met when Redcloak saw Xykon obliterate a garrison of paladins and, as Redcloak's brother says, "Let's suggest a team-up with him, Marvel style!"
    -   General Tarquin joins forces with Nale and the Linear Guild.
-   _Tales from the Pit_: The Rules Manager and the copier team up to defeat MaRo! Their evil plan: make duplicate copies of the relevant rules to prevent Mark's new mechanic from seeing print!

Oh, and the birdosaurus.
-   When some of Wonderella's lamer enemies with edible themes team up against her, she just sees an opportunity to not buy Thanksgiving food. With one of them even being a turkey, they were kind of asking for it.
    -   In another strip Wonderella discusses and deconstructs the Villain Team Up when fighting two minor supervillains, pointing out that it makes villains seem weak because they can't succeed on their own, and the hero only looks better when they win. Conversely, _Hero_ Team Ups are a lot more impressive since they're usually combating a gigantic, world-ending threat.
-   _Dominic Deegan_:
    -   Celesto Morgan, Jacob Deegan and the Chosen all teamed up for the "Storm of Souls" arc, each for different reasons: Celesto wanted revenge on Dominic for his hand in killing Amelia Travoria (later shifting to "cleansing" the world with the titular Storm), Jacob wanted revenge of Rillian for stripping some of his necromantic powers after the former started this mess with his experiments and the Chosen wanted to unleash the Storm on the world.
    -   The "March Across Maltak" arc saw Jacob join forces with the Shintula orc tribe.

    -   During the final arcs, the Infernomancer teamed up with King David and the Beast. The Infernomancer was just in it for the power boost, not indicating he supported their goal of wiping out all non-human life and chomping up the now-barren bits of the planet.
