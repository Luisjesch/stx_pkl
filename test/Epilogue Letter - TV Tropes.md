_"I write this letter to you now: I know it must've brought him unexpected joy to have an opponent like you at the end of that meaningless war. ...At least that's what I want to believe. Only you, the pilot who shot him down, can confirm this. And so, I write to you..."_

Simply put, a series ends with the narration of a letter, usually written by or for one of the main characters. This letter will usually serve as a kind of "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue, explain what the long term consequences of the events of the story are, and possibly explain things that were happening concurrently with the main plot, but occurred offscreen. In visual media, the letter will usually be narrated by the character who wrote it via voice-over.

Any Epistolary Novel will of course end this way, as the whole story is told through letters.

This is an Ending Trope, so consider yourself warned; this will contain unmarked spoilers.

    Anime and Manga 

-   The end of the Hatamoto family arc of _Case Closed_ involves the woman getting married sending a letter to Conan, Ran and Ran's father about the aftermath of the murders.
-   The epilogue in the manga of _Chrono Crusade_ uses a modified version: a video-taped message from Azmaria to Satella, anticipating the day when Satella would be unfrozen from crystal. It's used as a framing device for a flashback that covers what happened to most of the characters in the months leading up to Rosette's death, then jumps back to the "present" to show what happens to Satella and the others still living at that point.
-   The epilogue in _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_ is a letter exchange between Winry and Sheska.
-   At the end of _Fushigi Yuugi_, Miaka discovers a letter in her drawer from Tamahome. The letter was actually written when Keisuke asked Tamahome to return to the other world, and the latter complies as long as he can write a letter. Miaka only got to read it after everything went back to normal, but given that everyone did go back to the other world after the battle with Nakago, it still fits.
-   The final Sound Stage of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ uses the framing device of Fate composing an email to Subaru to describe events after the end of the season.
-   _Gundam_
    -   Subverted in _Gundam Wing_. Relena gets a letter from Heero, reads it, but then gets his attention and tears it in half, saying "Next time tell me in person", book-ending his ripping up her birthday party invite in the first episode. The anime never reveals what it said, but the novelization of the series and the Radio Drama/manga _Blind Target_ offer suggestions: In the novel it's a goodbye letter, saying he's going to Mars to help with the Terraforming project, which was the originally scripted ending for the anime; in _Blind Target_ it's simply "Happy Birthday".

-   From the _When They Cry_ franchise: "By the time you have read this, I will probably be dead. Although there may or may not be a body. You who have read this, please find the truth. That is my only wish."
