A Super-Trope. This trope occurs when two or more people who have a given defining quality in common (let's call it X) are polarized on opposite ends of the good vs. evil spectrum, and the good X must defend a person or group that does not have that quality against the evil X.

## Sub Tropes:

-   Animal Wrongs Group: Humans (wrongly) defend animals against other humans.
-   Damsel in Distress, Wife-Basher Basher, and Date Rape Averted: Men must defend women against other men.
-   Evil Twin: Twin must defend non-relatives against his other twin.
-   God Before Dogma: A "pure" religious hero stands against a corrupt religious villain.
-   Humans Need Aliens: Aliens defending human against other aliens.
-   Hunter of His Own Kind: Monsters must defend muggles against other monsters.
-   Predator Turned Protector: A predator refuses to harm their natural prey, instead choosing to protect them.
-   Serial-Killer Killer: These killers work to defend the nonviolent against other killers.
-   Superhero and Supervillain: Supers must defend muggles against other supers.
-   White Man's Burden: Part of the trope is about whites defending non-whites against other whites.
-   Zombie Advocate: Someone (most often a human) defends a monster/alien/etc's rights from ridicules of other humans.

Comes with the implication that people with X trait are more powerful, as well as the implication that people without it are more "like us" or conversely, Closer to Earth than us.

This trope is often lampshaded by Fantastic Racists, who will argue to the one defending that the group they seek to protect isn't worth harming their own kind for. The smaller and more fantastical of a group X is, the more likely this sort of argument is to work. It can lead to accusations that the protector is a Category Traitor. A man who refuses to defend a woman against another man, for instance, is a He-Man Woman Hater, but a vampire who kills other vampires will certainly have at least a moment's pause about killing vampires to save humans. On the other hand, the protector can fire back by pointing out to the Fantastic Racists that their behavior is no justification to harm, bully, or kill the group they are protecting, especially if said racist continues endorsing things like genocide and cruelty hence the justification for protection and rights groups to exist in the first place.

Related to Takes One to Kill One and My Species Doth Protest Too Much for one reason why X would bother to defend non-X. May also lead to Enemy Mine or Restricted Rescue Operation.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Arpeggio of Blue Steel_. The Crapsack World status quo is humanity having been confined to landmasses, totally at mercy of the Fleet of Fog, the mysterious alienish extremely-sophisticated armed and non-negotiating naval vessels. The protagonists' team agenda may be not about obliteration of the Fog, but its initial voyages are made possible only due to having Iona, functionally a Fog submarine, on their side.
-   _Berserk_. The Apostle Nosferatu Zodd does this several times in the series.
    -   After fighting Guts and Griffith (impressed by Guts' ability and Griffith having a Behelit) and sparing them, he later shows up to indirectly save a disarmed Guts' life by throwing him a sword from miles away.
    -   After barely surviving an attack by an Apostle-form Wyald, the Band of the Hawk continues on their way... only to be stopped by the still-living but badly wounded Wyald. He grabs Griffith, demanding that he use his Behelit to save him... and then Zodd shows up to kill Wyald once and for all since the time for the Eclipse wasn't right.
    -   Guts and Zodd team up to defend against an Apostle-form Emperor Ganishka. The two part without fighting each other, since Guts' first priority is to get Casca healed and Zodd doesn't want to kill the only human who he enjoys fighting so much.
-   _Omamori Himari_ starts with Ordinary High-School Student protagonist running into a weird sultry girl (speaking an old dialect and then optionally sprouting cat tail and ears). The girl explains his most recent heritage issues. He's a descendant of Demon Slayer family, and his power starts to stir now that he's 16. A family keepsake, actually an obfuscation charm, has depleted, and now he's a target for all kinds of spirits who may fear or otherwise oppose Demon Slayers. Finally, his ancestor has subdued a feline demon long ago, sparing it in return for servitude of protection, so the girl is here to make good on that promise, and she is a supernatural being herself. She drives off a first assailant even before actual chance to explain all this.
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_, Coordinator Kira Yamato defends the Naturals on _Archangel_ against other Coordinators.
-   _Fairy Tail_: A big part of the backstory reveals that roughly 400 years ago, the Dragons were split between those who saw humans as allies and friends and those who saw them as food and entertainment. When these tensions eventually boiled over into a civil war, the outnumbered pro-human side chose to bolster their numbers by enchanting and teaching their specific magic to humans, creating the first Dragon Slayers. Unfortunately for everyone involved, what nobody expected was how human bodies would react to the magic of Dragons, with many of those Slayers being overwhelmed by their enhanced senses, going insane, and in the worst-case scenarios becoming dragons themselves. This last fate in particular befell the strongest and most bloodthirsty Dragon Slayer Acnologia, who promptly started slaughtering _every_ dragon and Dragon Slayer he could find and crowned himself the "Dragon King" of a nearly extinct race.
-   _The Seven Deadly Sins_:
    -   Ban was (and is) a thief who tried to steal the Fountain of Youth. Along the way, he met a fairy who explained to him that the Fountain was vital to keeping her home forest alive, and he left the Wretched Hive where he had to steal to survive, and so when the next guy trying to steal the Fountain came along, Ban fought to protect it. Eventually he became one of the forest's foremost protectors.
    -   Meliodas was a demon unfortunate enough to live in a world where God and Satan Are Both Jerks. Growing tired of the pointless war between demons and goddesses/angels, he (and the goddess Elizabeth) fled to the human realm to live a peaceful life, fending off the demons that are preying on humans and trying to force him back into the fold. This is why Meliodas' non-demon companions are horrified when they realize his true heritage.

Intermarriage and power struggles led to the formation of the longest incarnation of The Empire.
-   _TRON_:
    -   The title character is a Program who fought malicious Programs in defense of Users.

As Ma3a is Lora Baines-Bradley's Virtual Ghost, Alan is forcibly uploaded, and Jet has to battle the invasion while his parents act as Mission Control, this makes the Bradleys Users who fight for the Programs. Fitting, as Tron was Alan Bradley's Program to begin with.

    -   Also applies to Worf during the show's fourth season, as he was brought to DS9 as a strategic advisor after the Klingons ended their prior treaty with the Federation, although this treaty was eventually restored mid-way through the fifth season and Worf's own status in the Empire restored towards the end of the same season.
