_I am not the type to faint  
When things are odd or things are quaint  
But seeing things you know that ain't  
Can certainly give you an awful fright!_

Bob has been undergoing Sanity Slippage and begins hallucinating. Depending on the show, these may result in a Tomato Surprise at the end, revealing that someone he's been talking to was Dead All Along, or that the person he killed was an innocent bystander or an ally.

In a game with a Sanity Meter, this is one of the signs (sometimes, the only one) that it's getting pretty low. The hallucinations may also somehow injure the character in-game, even though _they're not actually there._ They may also just result in a Camera Screw, Interface Screw, or Impairment Shot.

If Bob is undergoing a Mushroom Samba, the hallucinations will usually not be shown on-screen, making it look like he's afraid of trees and talking to rocks.

Depending on the nature of the show, the hallucinations could be a source of comedy, tragedy, or both.

If Bob is dying or near death, this may be the cause of his Dying Dream. If Bob has been brought Back from the Dead recently, it may be a symptom of Resurrection Sickness.

If the hallucination takes the form of a person talking with one of the characters, it has a very high chance of lampshading itself by saying "I'm just a hallucination," or something along those lines.

Of course, one attribute of having these is a difficulty to distinguish between real and imagined, leaving plenty of room for Or Was It a Dream? twists. And if you can't even distinguish between the real and the imagined world anymore, well...

If you can't believe the thing you're looking at, ask your friend if he can see it too.

When caused by drugs, see Mushroom Samba. When caused specifically by alcohol (or alcohol withdrawal), see Pink Elephants. Bloody Hallucinations of Guilt is a Sub-Trope.

Once you get to the tree, it sprays some kind of pollen what stuns you and when you turn and start walking away from the swamp, you'll be sent to a 'nice' little trip to horror lane where — for example — ghouls appear out of nowhere, you'll find your mom´s skeleton next to birthday decorations and you'll find the corpses of familiar characters floating in the swamp.

John Konrad tells him to choose, but both the people hanging from the ropes are already dead - Walker simply sees them as struggling. In fact, every conversation with Konrad is a hallucination, because Konrad was dead long before Walker even arrived in Dubai.

It became one of many signs of a severe Sanity Slippage that would go untreated for millennia, and contributed to Golden Scepter's deteriorating leadership.
