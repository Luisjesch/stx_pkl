**Kryten:** But what about the Space Corps Directive, which states it is our primary overriding duty to contact other lifeforms, exchange information and wherever possible bring them home?  
**Arnold Rimmer:** What about the Rimmer Directive, which states "Never tangle with anything that's got more teeth than the entire Osmond family"?

Monsters with a huge number of teeth.

This is a simple and common trope, playing on a natural fear of toothy predators. There are three common kinds of teeth you will see on a big scary thing: flat, triangular shark teeth; conical teeth similar to those of crocodiles; or ridiculously pointy needle teeth like a deep-sea fish. The monster's mouth will often be so crammed with teeth that half of them should break off with every bite. The teeth are usually all of the same type. Despite being a common animal trait in real life, human characters often make use of this trope, and when doing so is often used to mark a character with, well, _monster_\-like behavior, especially if it involves or is implied to involve murder in a very predatory sense. Commonly used in Nightmare Faces and Nested Mouths.

Subtrope of Scary Teeth. Also see Phlegmings — the lines of drool often seen between the teeth. When the teeth are arranged in a ring rather than opposing jawlines, that's a Lamprey Mouth. _Beware_ Vagina Dentata. Often overlaps with Fangs Are Evil or Tombstone Teeth depending on the shape. Stop by Cheshire Cat Grin for a less toothy but still creepy variation. Often found in conjunction with Threatening Shark and Never Smile at a Crocodile, and occasionally followed by Palate Propping.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Baikinman (and by default, his brothers Aokinman and Akakinman) from _Anpanman_. Teeth should not begin to look like that. His teeth are so prominent that they actually _disort_ into shapes to form vowels when he speaks! Baikinman's an alien, so there's at least a bit of justification. Females of his species don't have this style of teeth, and two other males of the species (Baikinsennin and Mushibaikinman) have different-looking teeth (Baikinsennin's are normal teeth, and Mushibaikinman's are similar to Baikinman's, but he only has five forming his mouth).
-   The titular monsters of _Attack on Titan_ are all human-like save for some odd deformities (disproportionate limbs, lack of skin), but more importantly mouths full of square incisors<small>◊</small>.
-   Kamineko in _Azumanga Daioh_ looks sweet, until the point he rocks the top of his head back to reveal he has dentition that makes bear traps look sick...<small>◊</small>
-   In _Baccano!_, one of Christopher Shoulder's most distinguishing features is that his mouth is filled with what appear to be shark teeth. Combined with his red eyes and archaic mode of dress, most people assume that he's some sort of vampire.
-   _Berserk_ is absolutely full of these. It's no wonder that _Berserk_'s creator, Kentaro Miura, took so long to release chapters when he had to draw each and every single tooth on pages full of literally _dozens_ of creatures. The biggest example is Borkoff, the demon that forced Guts to chisel off his left hand.
-   Grell Sutcliff the Shinigami from _Black Butler_ doesn't seem to have a greater than human amount of teeth, but his/her teeth _are_ all fangs, which isn't the case for the other shinigami or even the demons seen in the series.
-   Tier Harribel from _Bleach_.
    -   Averted, since those teeth were just a part of Harribel's hollow mask. When she uses her Resurrección, the mask vanishes and her now visible mouth and teeth are clearly normal.
    -   Well, there's Di Roy Rinker<small>◊</small>, and his square-sawed top row of teeth...
-   Masakaki from _\[C\] – Control_ gets shark teeth whenever he is excited about something evil happening. Appropriate too, since he's a _loan shark_.
-   The titular warriors from _Claymore_ gain these when they're dangerously close to liberating their powers enough to become demons.
-   Ryuk from _Death Note_ has these, along with a permanent Slasher Smile.
-   Krory the quasi-vampire Exorcist of _D.Gray-Man_ may look like he has Cute Little Fangs when his mouth is closed (and that only in the manga), but when he moves his lips, the result is a distinctly inhuman array of shark/crocodile-like fangs.
-   Tokomon of _Digimon Adventure_, in an unexpected way given it's coming from an otherwise Ridiculously Cute Critter. Tokomon's teeth are a direct nod to the Digimon virtual pets that the show was based on. All the child Digimon from the virtual pet keychains were adorable little monsters that revealed incongruous amounts of pixelated teeth when they ate or got mad at their owners. The Tamagotchi virtual pets that preceded Digimon did the same thing with their young forms.
-   Hiruma in _Eyeshield 21_ and his mouth full of fangs. It's part of his Spikes of Villainy look.
-   Some of the homunculi in _Fullmetal Alchemist_. Gluttony, when in attack mode, reveals a hippopotamus-like mouth with extra rows of teeth inside<small>◊</small>, Greed and Sloth have sharklike teeth, and Pride's true form consists entirely of eyes, teeth, and Living Shadow.
-   Neko Musume of _GeGeGe no Kitarō_ may have inspired Kamineko above, because let's be honest, _cat teeth are not like that_. Yikes.
-   The Tsuyoshi family in _Great Teacher Onizuka_ - those short friendly people with shark teeth.
-   Lots and lots of flesh rending teeth appear to be the most defining characteristic for the mysterious invading Eldritch Abominations in "Hakaijuu". Special mention goes to the one that not only has numerous mandibles but hundreds of three-fingered hands with smaller mouths in each finger tip that it uses to strip the flesh from unlucky high school students.
-   _Hanako and the Terror of Allegory_ gives us the Slit-Mouth Woman. Although she has a fairly normal tooth-to-mouth ratio, she's got quite a bit of mouth.
-   Vampires in _Hellsing_ (especially the OVA and Manga) generally have teeth like sharks...it is only when Alucard fully activates the Cromwell Initiative and essentially becomes an _Eldritch Abomination_ that this trope really starts getting fulfilled. A lot.
    -   And the HUMANS too. Please see any chapter where Father Anderson is doing what he does best. Or when the Major...talks.
-   In _Kill la Kill_, the tennis club captain, Omiko Hakodate, has, shall we say, spiked dental ridges for some reason, likely as a Shout-Out to the aforementioned Viral.
-   The second form of the berserked defense program in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_, which had two massive heads filled with massive, pointy teeth.
-   In _Mahou Shoujo Pretty Bell_, the demon Meyer looks like a normal human until he opens his mouth to reveal several rows of shark teeth.
-   _Musuko ga Kawaikute Shikataganai Mazoku no Hahaoya_: A mouth full of numerous incredibly sharp fangs is a common feature on most demons. While there are occasions where these are portrayed as Scary Teeth, particularly when characters are acting threatening, most of the time they act as Cute Little Fangs, even on characters that aren't exactly "cute" themselves.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Kurama's mouth was set in a permanent snarl revealing a massive number of teeth larger than the titular character. However, such a trait has faded with Kurama's Character Development, and his teeth now resemble what they should-a giant fox's. At times, the only thing that can be seen of the demon are two red eyes and gleaming teeth.
    -   It appears to be common for Hidden Mist shinobi to file their teeth to resemble a shark's, though this may be restricted to Seven Swordsmen and their aspirants. Then again, given the other sharklike traits of some of those characters, it's possible that their teeth are naturally that way.
    -   The Ten-Tails's first form is presented with a huge mouth with dozens of spiky, sharp teeth for a murderous Glasgow Grin.
-   _Psyren_: Ash from the W.I.S.E. squad Scourge.
-   Ratman of...well, _Ratman_ does this when he gets angry or excited. Normally, he can function fine with his mouth closed, and it looks just like a helmet. But when he opens it for whatever reason, it's enough to give one of his friends recurring nightmares.
-   Soul of _Soul Eater_ has them. It's never explained why besides just Rule of Cool.
-   Holo in _Spice and Wolf_ gets these in mid-transformation from human form to a giant wolf. It's pretty disturbing to see them on such a cute face.
-   Viral from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_, who is part shark and part feline.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_: Noro has a Cool Mask with an enormous toothy smile, and Combat Tentacles with mouths that are either this or a Lamprey Mouth. Either way, that's a lot of teeth that want to eat everything in sight.
-   _Toriko_:
    -   Tommyrod has several rows of retractable teeth, which he uses, when he runs out of bugs.
    -   Nitros have teeth covering both of their jaws. Yes, not lining - covering.
    -   Acacia, after eating Neo has not only sharp, teeth-like spikes coming out of his jaw, but also several rows of sharp teeth leading down his throat.
-   Clara Valac in _Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun_ has a mouth filled with sharp teeth. This isn't unusual for demons, but it's more visible on her because she's constantly smiling.
-   The Misago from _Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou_ has lots of sharp carnivorous teeth. She's good and kind-hearted and only uses them to eat fish, but most people freak out after seeing her scary dentition.
-   Junji Ito's 2017 horror manga _Layers of Fear_ has both the daughters of a widow with rows upon rows of teeth because their bodies grow in layers with the fetus being the core as a part of a curse.

    Asian Animation 

-   In _Larva_, one of the larvae, Violet, has a horrifying appearance with a mouth full of sharp fangs, helping to establish him as a villain.

    Comic Books 

-   Parallax from the _Green Lantern_ continuity has a few sets of these, forming the shape of the Sinestro Corps symbol with his throat as the hole. It's freakier looking than it sounds. Also a few Sinestro Corpsmen themselves, including Tri-Eye<small>◊</small>, who has three wide-ass mouths and teeth on the edges of all three faces, and Maash, who has three entire heads piled on top of each other.
-   The Corinthian in _The Sandman (1989)_. Though his eye-teeth are usually just straight, smaller copies of the teeth in his mouth, spinoffs and fanart tend to make them pointed. Also Azazel — a lord of hell who appears as a black void filled with eyes and disembodied teeth.
-   _Supergirl_:
    -   In _Bizarrogirl_, the giant insect-like creatures spawned by the godship have huge fang-filled mouths.
    -   In _Superman/Supergirl: Maelstrom_, Supergirl fights a giant alien squid whose mouth, instead of a beak, has at least sixteen sets of sharp teeth.
-   _The Maxx_: Isz, especially black Isz.
-   _Batman_: Some images of the Joker show his (non-pointy) teeth as being so long, it looks as if the chemical he'd gotten dumped in must've given him ever-growing dentition like a rodent's, as well as weird coloration. This is noticeable in Tim Sale's art _(The Long Halloween_ and _Dark Victory_ in particular), though certain panels exaggerate this more than others. Here's a noticeable example.<small>◊</small>
-   The alien symbiotes from _Spider-Man_. Spidey himself didn't get this effect when he was wearing the black suit, but Venom, Carnage and basically anyone else "wearing" a symbiote is going to develop these. Interesting note: Venom didn't start out with this either. Todd McFarlane originally drew him with a mouth that was toothy, but mostly human-looking (at least as much as the Joker's). Then Erik Larsen, who hated the character, was assigned to draw him and started giving him a drooling monster mouth and an Overly-Long Tongue, supposedly to avoid getting bored. Most "good" symbiotes don't have the mouth. If they develop one, run.
-   In _The Orc's Treasure,_ by Kevin J. Anderson, all Orcs are distinguished by the impossible overabundance of pointy teeth. Many of them have teeth protruding through parts of their lips or cheeks.
-   Phil Foglio is fond of this trope in his artwork.
    -   In the _Myth Adventures_ comics he depicts Aahz this way. Even in the novels, Aahz is described more than once as _dropping_ his smile when he wants to put people at ease.
    -   _XXXenophile_ is good for teeth. And Cute Monster Girls.
    -   The grins the Jägermonsters (and occasionally some of the Sparks) have in _Girl Genius_.
-   Elves from _Amulet_. When their mouth is closed it's no big deal, but when they open it to eat something, _brrrrr!_
-   Any time Rob Liefeld draws someone grimacing, as seen here: "How many teeth are in a mouth? Like a billion, right? I’ll just draw a billion, all the same size and shape." In the same article, example 27, Liefeld makes the opposite, but equally weird mistake: He somehow draws the Red Skull, a villain whose entire motif is that his head _is a human skull_, with only 17 teeth in the entire mouth, all of them incisors.
-   Max of Sam & Max stands out from other fictional rabbits by way of his pointy teeth.
-   An unusual example: Frank Miller in his more recent projects such as _Sin City_ and _Holy Terror_ has characters being punched in the jaw, resulting in losing copious numbers of teeth. Which evidently grow back almost instantly; if someone gets punched more than once, he'll lose more teeth than he had in his mouth originally.
-   The Dominators, a humanoid alien race from DC Comics, are distinguished by an abundance of long, sharp teeth. Specific character examples are rare since their culture doesn't use names, but the defector Sakritt who allied herself with Wonder Woman in WW Vol 2 was rather gleeful about using her impressive teeth to intimidate foes.
-   The Titan Magazines Transformers comics based on _Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen_ give us Dead End, a bizarre vampire-cannibal-zombie-robot thing whose most notable feature is that his face seems to consist of little more than a visor and a large collection of very un-robot-like teeth.
-   Violator from _Spawn_ has a mouth full of fangs which is almost always wide open and drooling.
-   _Simon Dark_: While Suzie used to be human these days she's an eyeless tentacle-covered blob with a gaping mouth that has several rows of needle-sharp teeth.

    Comic Strips 

-   Liō somehow acquires them once.

    Fairy Tales 

-   Implied in _Pintosmalto_. Pintosmalto isn't a monster, but he is not human, either. A regular adult has thirty-two teeth, so Pintosmalto has eight too many, going by the forty pearls Betta ordered.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: After her Metamorphosis into half of Monster X, Vivienne Graham's head now has two sets of teeth: a universally sharp front set, and a more human-like rear set with canines and molars, reflecting hers and Monster X's dual nature as a fusion of humanity and Titan.

    Film — Animated 

-   The anglerfish in _Finding Nemo_. Also the sharks, although they're trying to go vegetarian.
-   The Cheshire Cat from _Alice in Wonderland_ was originally going to have these, but they were later changed.
-   The robotic shark from
-   _Dawn Of The Dinosaurs_ has blue pterosaur with pointed teeth.

_James and the Giant Peach_.

-   McNasty from _Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw_ is a human with sharklike teeth because... he's evil?
-   The Mighty One-Eye in _The Thief and the Cobbler_ has so many teeth that you _CAN'T SEE THE BACK OF HIS THROAT_, even when he opens his mouth to its widest extent.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Alien_:
    -   The Xenomorphs have enough teeth to outfit a _second, smaller mouth_. Their appearance is all the more nightmarish for having a variety of different teeth, looking almost like a fanged human. The Xenomorph jaws were inspired by a real-life creature, the Goblin Shark.
    -   In _Prometheus_, the Deacon that bursts out of the Engineer's chest at the end has a jaw very much like a Goblin Shark's.
-   _Blade II_: The Reapers have a normal number of human/vampire teeth, but the probosces inside their Flower Mouths are also visibly lined with extra fangs.
-   _Godzilla_:
    -   Godzilla himself sometimes, depending on the incarnation. Heisei Godzilla sports twin rows of fangs in most of his designs. Shin Godzilla has even more teeth, a few of which look as if they're growing out of his _skin_.
    -   _Godzilla vs. Biollante_: In her second form, Biollante has so much teeth that even the roof of her mouth and her _tongue_ are covered with them.
-   _Independence Day: Resurgence_: Unlike her minions, who lack visible mouths, beneath her armour the Queen has jaws and a _nest_ of fangs along her gums.
-   _Jurassic Park_:
    -   _Jurassic World_:
        -   The _Indominus rex_ has a set of teeth in a similar manner to the _V. rex_ from _King Kong (2005)_. The film's web even accomplishes this in its sneak peek: _"Bigger. Louder. More teeth."_
        -   The Mosasaurus has teeth on her palate!
    -   _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_: Like his predecessor the Indominus, the Indoraptor has a large mouth full of irregular crocodilian fangs.

-   The Kraken in _Pirates of the Caribbean_ showcases numerous rows of teeth right as it roars at Captain Jack Sparrow.
-   The titular creatures in _The Deadly Spawn_ have so many teeth that rows of them are still outside the mouth when it is closed.
-   The vampires in _Fright Night (1985)_ tend to have this, especially during the third part of their metamorphosis.

-   In _Coneheads_, Beldar demonstrates how many teeth coneheads have when he goes to the dentist to get them capped... _all four rows of them_. And he can open his mouth _reeeeeeally_ wide.
-   The titular creatures in _Critters_ are giant furballs with teeth<small>◊</small>.
-   Fizzgig from _The Dark Crystal_ is a little furball who looks innocent until he opens his mouth, and then he becomes mostly teeth.
-   Shark teeth aplenty in the monsters from _Feast_, particularly at the end of the first movie, when you can actually see how many of them Heroine #2 smashes out with a rifle butt.
-   _King Kong (2005)_: One of the _V. rexes_ (the bull that is the second one that Ann encounters and the Climax Boss of the fight) has a distorted upper jaw with room for still more gigantic teeth, probably due to some old facial injury. They vary from multiple teeth in the upper jaw in a gap in the lower jaw, to a smaller tooth growing from the same socket as another one. The _Piranhadon_ from the deleted scenes also qualifies.
-   _The Thing (1982)_: Since it's a consummate shapeshifter, the titular Thing only piles on the teeth when it needs to attack someone.
-   _The Meg_ is about megalodon shark, a species whose name means "Big Teeth" the name is accurate<small>◊</small>.
-   The title vampire character _Count Yorga_, though oddly when he bites his victims he only leaves the usual tiny pinprick bites.
-   _Men in Black_:
    -   "Jeff", the 600-foot alien worm from _Men in Black II_ who lives in New York's subway stations, makes his first appearance by munching on one of the subway trains.
    -   Boris the Animal in _Men in Black 3_ is literally _all_ teeth when his body unravels.

-   In _It (2017)_, Pennywise's teeth go berserk when he's in Game Face, particularly in the projector scene, where he sprouts _multiple rows_ of teeth so massive they don't even fit in his mouth. Sweet dreams, folks.
-   _Dead Birds_: Anyone who ends up possessed gets these, along with an Eyeless Face.
-   _Feeding Frenzy_: The primary monsters are "globkins", cantaloupe-sized balls of flesh with big, toothy maws.
-   The bioraptors in _Pitch Black_ have mouths that are _filled_ with long, needle-thin teeth.

    Literature 

-   _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_: The Cheshire Cat is quite nice, save for the part where there are far more teeth in his mouth than should actually fit. Which he is very fond of showing off.
-   The Taxxons from _Animorphs_ have, among other nasty features, a Lamprey Mouth.
-   One of the most defining characteristics of the dwarven race in Artemis Fowl is a mouth full of large, powerful teeth.
-   When Magicians (read: Demon Summoners) in David Eddings' _The Belgariad_ and _Malloreon_ summon their demons, they try to outdo each other by making their demons look as menacing as possible. One common area of embellishment is in the face, where they try to cram as many teeth into the mouth as possible inside. If they aren't satisfied with the number of teeth they can get that way, they may also go the "multiple mouths" route, to allow them more space for more teeth. A few even go for multiple faces, for more room for more tooth-filled mouths. It should also be noted that these imaginary forms are also the way they keep demons under control. A demon in his (uncontrollable) true form is terrifying in itself, but for other reasons.
-   _Bruce Coville's Book of... Nightmares_: The true form of _The Fat Man_, which has "lots and lots of teeth".
-   Said word-for-word in the first _Cal Leandros_ book, though Cal is describing Robin, who, though nonhuman, has the normal amount of teeth.
-   In _Going Postal_, one of the things the post office sign instructs you not to ask about are "Huje Green Things With Teeth", possibly a Noodle Incident as none ever actually show up here. Later, Anghammarad, a twenty-thousand-year-old Golem, remembers that in his day, it was "Do Not Ask Us About Saber-Tooth Tigers, Tar Pits, Huge Green Things With Teeth, Or The Goddess Czol". When asked "you had huge green things with teeth back then?", he answers "Bigger. Greener. More Teeth."
-   The Witches in _The Doomspell Trilogy_ have four jaws, each full of nasty, sharp, pointy teeth. (For an artist's impression, see the example in the New Media category.) They're also full of symbiotic spiders.
-   The Sand Worms from _Dune_ are living tubes ranging from puppy-dog small to town-swallowingly humongous, with very sharp crystalline teeth that can literally be made into knives and which pretty much line the entire visible inner side of their tubing when they open wide to let you look. Most don't want to look.
-   In _The Girl from the Miracles District_, when Nikita goes berserk, the number of teeth in her mouth multiplies.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_:
    -   Agrajag in _Life, the Universe and Everything_ has a patchwork body and a vast array of teeth. Lampshaded, in that Agrajag's excessive and deliberately unpleasant teeth don't all quite fit nicely into his mouth, resulting in them lacerating his lips and mouth. There are some sticky black plasters covering the nastier wounds.
    -   The Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal is often depicted this way.
-   N. K. Jemisin's _Inheritance Trilogy_: Lil, Physical Goddess of hunger, has a jaw that hangs down to her knees and is full of multiple rows of fangs, which rotate like chainsaw teeth. Fortunately, she's a Horrifying Hero and can Humanshift into something less conspicuous if need be.
-   The titular Clock Roaches in Stephen King's _The Langoliers_. The TV version depicted them (poorly) with three rows of alternately rotating teeth, like a cross between an excavation drill and Pac-Man.
-   Kelpies in _Market of Monsters_ are depicted as having countless layered rows of countless razor-sharp teeth.
-   Phil Foglio's covers for the Donning-Starblaze illustrated editions of the _Myth Adventures_ books depict Aahz this way. Even in the novels, Aahz is described more than once as _dropping_ his smile when he wants to put people at ease.
-   _Rifters Trilogy_ contains deep-sea fish like this, but their teeth are so brittle that when one tries to bite a person's arm off, the teeth shatter.
-   _Rivers of London_: This is the reason Molly, the Folly's rather creepy maid and cook, doesn't talk and covers her mouth when she laughs. Other members of what appears to be her species are the same way.
-   William Sleator's novel _Singularity_ had a creature coming through a Portal Pool from another universe. It was visible from this universe long before it arrived, and the only part of it that was visible was its huge mouthful of teeth. The main character, in fact, spent a whole year waiting for the creature to arrive, knowing only its toothy appearance.
-   _S. Petersen's Field Guide to Cthulhu Monsters_ is packed with teeth. Big, nasty teeth! Let's see who's the champ in the dental department, shall we?
    -   The byakhee has back-pointing narrow fangs like a snake's, and plenty of 'em.
    -   The Deep One's teeth are crocodile-like, extra-sharp, and appear to come in multiple rows.
    -   The dhole's teeth are rooted in several extensible jaw-like structures and are about as big as the human silhouette on the size-comparison diagram. The _teeth_, not the jaw-like structures.
    -   The flying polyp has two mouths of crocodile-type teeth. At least, two mouths visible in the picture. The one you encounter may have more.
    -   The formless spawn has several rows of oversized teeth, which best resemble human incisors. Which is kinda creepy in itself.
    -   The Hounds of Tindalos has a lot of crocodile-like teeth, but should probably be disqualified because it's the tongue you really have to worry about.
    -   The Servitor of the Outer Gods' mouth would look good on a deep-sea angler.
    -   _Bzzzt!_ Sorry, Mr. Shoggoth, you should've submitted a pic where you had lots of _teeth_, not lots of eyes. Better send that one in to a different contest.
    -   Shub-Niggurath has a half-dozen mouths of crocodile teeth showing, presumably with more on the back. If she has a back. Maybe this _is_ her back in the pic. Who can tell?
    -   Ghouls, ghasts, hunting horrors, shantaks, and Ithaqua get consolation prizes. Not bad teeth, guys, but not nearly enough to hold your own against such tough competitors.
    -   Lots of other oogey-boogeys in that book, but whatever the heck they've got, it sure ain't teeth.
    -   And the winner is ... the Dhole! Not least because it's probably eaten most of the other contestants by now.
-   _Princesses of the Pizza Parlor_: "Princesses on the Lonely Isle": The first monster seen has "a lot of teeth!":
    
    Sally had seen sharks that weren't so well equipped.
    
-   In _The Starchild Trilogy_, the pyropods (lit. "flame foot") are terrifying living rockets with a mouthful of teeth at the other end, which fly around devouring everything.
-   The Chtorran worms in David Garrold's _The War Against the Chtorr_ novels may have been a homage to the sandworms of _Dune_.
-   In _Watersong_, when they assume their true forms, the sirens' mouths become filled with a huge number of sharp teeth.
-   Boomer the hammerhead shark from _Who's Afraid of Boomer?_.
-   The _Zachary Nixon Johnson_ series has a villain named Sammy Smiles, who has a hideously wide mouth with at least sixty teeth visible when he smiles.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The _Beetleborgs_ episode "Buggin Out" featured a gnat-like monster named Kombat Gnat who had several teeth like this and the power to shrink. This particular episode was a satire of David Cronenberg's remake _The Fly (1986)_. Flabber brings a drawing of a teleportation device to life and he tests it out. Kombat Gnat flies into the machine and their DNA gets merged. This causes Flabber to slowly turn into Kombat Gnat — starting out with cute little vampiric fangs, then developing antennae and a row of razor-sharp teeth like this.
-   _Channel Zero: Candle Cove_ takes this trope to its logical extreme with the Tooth Child, which appears to be _made entirely of human teeth_.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Eleventh Hour": Prisoner Zero had a mouth like a viper fish<small>◊</small> in its natural form. And these teeth are sometimes visible in its human mouths.
    -   The vampires in "The Vampires of Venice".
    -   The new-series model of Cybermats. Yet they're adorable.
    -   "The Woman Who Fell to Earth": Tzim-Sha (who the Doctor annoys by calling him Tim Shaw), an alien warlord wannabe who takes teeth from everyone he kills, and then implants them IN HIS OWN FACE as trophies on display.
-   _The Goodies_. In "Frakenfido", Graeme Garden reveals he actually used the Osmonds to provide teeth for his monster dog.
    
    **Graeme:** Look. Teeth. You wouldn't find teeth like these on a mere dog.  
    **Tim:** What are they? Horse, alligator, tiger...  
    **Graeme:** Look at them.  
    **Tim:** No! Not Donny Osmond!  
    **Graeme:** Yep.  
    **Tim:** You...you've been using people! And Donny Osmond!
    
-   An episode of _The Greatest American Hero_ featured a mystical black void guarded by a Beast that was nothing but a giant champing set of teeth.
-   The insect-like Mooks of _Kamen Rider Gaim_ are all top heavy guys with bulbous upper bodies, which are actually _four massive jaws_ all lined with sharp teeth.
-   _The Langoliers_ (again).
-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_: From the animated mind of Terry Gilliam, it's Conrad Pooh and his Dancing Teeth.
-   An interstitial on MTV2 featured a hoard of superhero parodies, including Too Many Teeth Man, whose power is obvious.
-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_: In "Stranded", Tyr'Nar has a huge number of razor-sharp teeth.
-   The Polymorph in the _Red Dwarf_ episode "Polymorph", a spoof of the Xenomorphs. The Polymorph, a shapeshifting Emotion Eater, assumed the form of a monster from one of Lister's nightmares, which Rimmer fittingly describes as an "8-foot, armor-plated, alien killing machine" with "more teeth than the Osmond family".
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   Vampires have two sets of teeth: their human-like teeth, and a set of piranha-like retractable fangs which descend from their gums.
    -   The Leviathans from season 7, whenever they reveal their "true" face. Essentially their entire head is occupied by mouth.
-   _The Wheel of Time (2021)_: The Myrdraal looks like a humanoid version of a sandworm with the complete large set of teeth, as shown when it screams in rage at Moiraine thwarting its Trollocs' pursuit.

    Multiple Media 

-   MonsterVerse:
    -   _Kong: Skull Island_:
        -   The Skullcrawlers' mouths are full of a ridiculous number of inward-angled fangs<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , which serve predominantly to support using their prehensile tongues to swallow smaller creatures whole.
        -   Monarch's files describe the Swamp Locust as just being a throat filled with teeth and armed with claws.
    -   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_:
        -   Not in the actual film, but in the novelization, Mokele-Mbembe is described as having a crocodilian mouth with thousands of fanged teeth.
        -   Also downplayed with King Ghidorah's heads, which each have roughly a single row of main teeth and smaller teeth poking out of their gums in random places (these extra teeth are more visible in the Ghidorah skull in _Godzilla vs. Kong_).
    -   _Skull Island (2023)_: The Kraken's beak has at least two rows of sharp teeth lining either jaw, and it's an incredibly nasty piece of work with a malicious personality fit to rival Ghidorah.

    Music 

-   The Osmonds, the Trope Namer, were a 1970s Boy Band from Provo, Utah, composed of Mormon brothers (and occasionally one sister) who were collectively renowned for their super-excellent gleaming dentition. Posterity grants them a couple of not-bad tunes; younger generations may know Donny Osmond as the singing voice of Captain Li Shang from _Mulan_ (y'know, "Let's get down to business...") or as Joseph in _Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat_. Prankster comedians The Goodies also had a too-many-teeth-related gag or two at their expense.
-   Freddie Mercury of Queen fame had a distinctive overbite caused by four extra teeth that pushed his incisors outward. He refused to have this corrected for fear that it might harm his singing voice.

    Mythology and Folklore 

-   Manticores. Those things have _three rows_ of metal teeth. Fortunately they don't exist. What was that sound?
-   In traditional Eastern European Vampire folklore, vampires tend to have double rows of razor-sharp, strong-as-iron teeth used for chewing through wood, soil, flesh, bone, and organs. Some just have hollow, sharp tongues, and few don't have anything sharp in their mouths and take blood magically without even physically puncturing the victim's body.
-   Some versions of the Japanese urban legend the Kuchisake-Onna have her Glasgow Grin full of lots and lots of sharp, pointy teeth.

    Pinball 

-   In _Pinball Dreams 2_, the robots in "Revenge of the Robot Warriors" all have this

    Radio 

-   _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme:_ The guy in charge of the Celestial Bureaucracy's animal design department is alarmed when he sees the man who previously designed puffin's newest creation - the anglerfish, prompted by a very nasty breakup. He's particularly alarmed by its maw of needle-like teeth. And that's before he hears about how they reproduce...

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Tyranids, partly inspired by the Xenomorphs from _Alien_, have ridiculous numbers of teeth, somewhere between the dinosaur type and the needle type.
    -   Tyranid Rippers seem to be composed of _nothing but teeth_. The basically unusable nature of the teeth is justified because they _are_ nothing but weapons - Tyranid battle organisms do not have digestive systems, and are expected to simply throw themselves into pits of digestive juices after the battle. Assuming they survive, of course.
    -   Then you have the Squigs of _Warhammer_ Fantasy (as well as 40k, though far less prominent). Ironically, Squigs are not only edible themselves, but described as delicious — moist and flavorsome, combining the taste of smoked ham with the lightness of young chicken. One breed of Squig is actually known as the "facebiter/face-eater squig". A common orc contest of toughness and bravery has the Orcs try to eat a live squig, without using their hands, before it eats them. According to some early 40k sources, the Squigs are actually Tyranids created with Ork base genetic material; the Orks found the Squigs and adopted them into their culture sensing their inherent "Orky" nature. This was forgotten, though it may serve as the ultimate foundation for the Biovores and their rumored nature as Ork gene-infused Tyranids.
    -   Then there are the Orcs/Orks, who in either setting use "teef" as money. Teef are acquired by either using your own or ripping out someone else's. Don't worry, they grow back. In the 40k fluff, there are various "tribes" of Orks that have different genetic quirks (usable in-game through several fan expansions). One of them is the Bad Moonz, who not only have more teeth than average but also regrow them at an increased rate. As such, they're the richest Orks around and always have the most snazz (although this isn't considered an unfair advantage because any other ork can acquire a fair share of this money via the traditional "right hook").
    -   Chaos' Legions of Hell just wouldn't be proper daemons if some of them didn't have more teeth than a dentition textbook, usually sticking out at odd and possibly noneuclidean angles.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_ has an entire creature type of toothy monsters called Atogs. Here's one example.
    -   Not that they're the only creatures that qualify.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
-   In _Exalted_, Halkomelem, The Enigma in Red and Gold, has three sets of jaws and learns anything a creature it eats knew.
-   The Legion of Everblight from _Hordes_ in the _Iron Kingdoms_ setting. It has warbeasts with no eyes, ears, or noses. Just mouths full of large, sharp teeth.
-   One adventure for _Paranoia_ had a table of descriptions for the various robots. For the Doberbot, the entry first lists the weapon, 16" long teeth, then under description: "You don't know, all you see are the teeth."
    -   Was a possible Shout-Out to the monster in the Den segment of _Heavy Metal_.
-   In _Scarred Lands_, one of the fallen titans was Gaurak the Glutton - an obese and monstrously ravenous deity who was said to have devoured everything on the once verdant moon. After his defeat by the titan's children, the gods, every one of his hundreds of teeth were pulled out and thrown across the destroyed world, taking on the form of mountains, obelisks, and trees which currently taint the surrounding land.
-   In _Vampire: The Masquerade_, the merit "Gaping Maw" is available to Nosferatu characters—who are already butt-ugly per their curse—which lets them deal extra bite damage and gain an additional Blood Point every turn they spend feeding.
-   In _Guess Who_, some characters have a ridiculous number of enormous teeth.

    Video Games 

-   The titular Ao Oni.
-   Fuel your nightmares with this picture<small>◊</small> - Abyss of _Soul Calibur III_. Four rows of teeth pointing down at the top of his mouth, three rows pointing up from the bottom, and no, that's not a crown, those aren't horns, that's another row of teeth pointing up _at the top of his head_. And this is the Soul Sword empowered form of Zasalamel, a _normal (immortal) guy_.
    -   Some versions of the sword Soul Edge, in addition to having eyes, also have teeth. Inferno, the spirit of Soul Edge, is implicitly an immaterial being with so many teeth they can spill over into the physical realm.
-   The monsters of _Evolve_ each come with a mouth packed full of fangs. They put them to good use eating the population of Shear.
-   _TimeSplitters Future Perfect_: "Shoot anything with teeth bigger than its face!"
-   Pretty much every monster in the Amiga/Atari/C64/MS-DOS game _Weird Dreams_ had lots and lots of very large teeth. According to The Other Wiki, the author had a dental phobia.
-   As if the entire concept of _X-COM_'s Chryssalids aren't nightmarish enough, someone decided to give their research entry images permanent, toothy smiles.
-   Decarabia from _Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow_. Imagine a starfish's hungry mouth staring straight at you. Imagine that mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth. Now, imagine said starfish hurtling at you at approximately 80 MPH.
-   The Rifle Demons in the _Disgaea_ series have mouths full of large, pointy, and perpetually visible teeth. They tend to get a lot of emphasis in their team attack portraits.
-   _Mortal Kombat_:
    -   Baraka has a mouth full of pointy teeth, as do other Tarkatan. His teeth in his first appearance were acryllic nails glued to a cheap Nosferatu mask.
    -   Mileena, a female ninja with a bombshell body ruined by a mouth with more teeth than a school of piranha. This is because she's a deformed clone of Kitana fused with Tarkatan essence.
-   The Protopets from _Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando_. Give a tribble the jaws and personality of a Great White Shark, and you've got a pretty close approximation.
-   One of two discernible facial features of Taokaka in _BlazBlue_ is a mouth full of lots of very sharp, pointy teeth.
-   A few mutants in _Resident Evil_, particularly in the later stages of G-virus infection.
-   The Gaets in _Tales of Legendia_ are easily among the toothiest monsters in the _Tales Series_, all of their various species having a huge mouthful of large, perpetually visible teeth of either the shark-like triangular or pointy needle variety.
-   Yogg-Saron<small>◊</small>, one of the Old Gods from _World of Warcraft_.
-   Just in case you didn't figure out Chancellor Cole was an Evil Chancellor before then in _The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks_, the last you see of him before he explicitly outs himself as one is him flashing an evil grin full of pointed, shark-like teeth.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   Thresher Maws are described in the Codex as "abominations of tentacles and teeth." They're even _scarier_.
    -   The yahg, who are clearly not a species to mess with despite only appearing twice (counting DLC). The first one you meet is the Shadow Broker. Shepard calls attention to this in the third game.
-   Fuzzles from _Oddworld_. They start out looking tiny cute little furballs until they go into attack mode where they become rabid and reveal their mouth filled to the brim with razor-sharp teeth.
-   The Dragon God from _Demon's Souls_ needs a second mouth to contain all his teeth. _Dark Souls_, its Spiritual Successor, gives us this lovely beast; less "Monster with lots of teeth" and more "Teeth with a hint of monster." It's called "the Gaping Dragon" and it's basically a _bona fide_ dragon whose entire upper torso has been transformed into a gigantic mouth, so consuming is its Horror Hunger.
-   The Malboros from the _Final Fantasy_ series are giant plants with this many teeth, almost as many eyes, and Combat Tentacles. Neither of which is their true power that makes them deadly; the fact that they exhale choking, poisonous gas (which may or may not be a way nastier, weaponized form of tobacco smoke) with their signature Bad Breath attack is.
-   The Garmraid in _Super Robot Wars MX_ can attach its shoulder guards to its fists, then tossing a _Rocket Punch_ with teeth.
    -   One upped by Alfimi's Persoenlichkeit in _2nd Original Generation._ It is not pretty to see.
    -   The Shiseiten, the Epilogue Boss from _Third Super Robot Wars: Jigoku-Hen_, is a six-mouthed skeletal beast with tons of sharp fangs.
-   The Ultimate Chimera in _Mother 3_ is a devilish-looking beast that's practically a walking set of huge, pointed teeth, it having a massive maw that runs almost the length of its whole body. One chomp from it is enough to do the party in immediately, without even giving them a chance to battle it proper.
-   Night Of Wallachia from _Melty Blood_ has a lot of extremely sharp teeth.
-   The Hebby Repp and Sudo Neku Dream Eaters in _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_ have a mouthful of pointy triangular teeth, kept in a constant smile, though it's purely for cuteness. The Tyranto Rex, on the other hand, has a mouthful of perpetually visible fang-like teeth that make it look more than slightly intimidating.
-   True Ogre from the _Tekken_ series has a couple of fangs on his _lips_, along with the set of fangs in his mouth, which are attached to gross, elongated gums. It's as if he has a mouth _within_ a mouth.
-   Demitri Maximoff from _Darkstalkers_ has lots of sharp teeth, as prominently shown in the _Night Warriors_ OVA.
-   The Nosalis mutants in _Metro: Last Light_, redesigned from the first game, now have enormous mouths that dominate their whole faces and are filled to the brim with huge fangs. Their lack of visible eyes serves to further highlight their teeth.
-   One of the most immediately obvious characteristics of the murderous animatronics of the _Five Nights at Freddy's_ series is their teeth.
    -   From the first game, there are the enormous, denture-like teeth of Bonnie and Freddy, the sharp fangs of Foxy, and Toothy Bird Chica. _Too_ toothy, in fact, as her costume plainly exposes the endoskeleton's teeth at the back of her mouth and makes her look even more disturbing<small>◊</small>.
    -   This gets progressively worse in _Five Nights at Freddy's 2_ with the old animatronics now in such a state of disrepair that their endoskeleton teeth are even more prominent. This is especially startling with Bonnie, who in spite of having his face ripped off, still manages to have a lot of teeth visible in what remains of his jaw. The worst is probably Mangle, who manages to have no less than _three_ sets of jaws thanks to its status as some kind of Body Horror animatronic.
    -   It comes to a head in _Five Nights at Freddy's 3_, where the horrific and frankly revolting-looking Springtrap has a near-permanent Slasher Smile. This is because when it _does_ open its mouth it reveals that it has more teeth inside just like all the others... that is, _real human teeth_, because of the presence of a mutilated, decades-old mummified corpse hidden in the suit... the corpse of the child-murdering psychopath responsible for the entire _Five Nights at Freddy's_ saga.
    -   In _Five Nights at Freddy's 4_, Chica's taken this trope back: she has three sets of teeth,<small>◊</small> all of them incredibly sharp. In fact, all the animatronics are focusing on teeth this time.
-   In _Batman: Arkham Asylum_, Killer Croc has enough teeth to permanently injure Scarecrow's face and leg with a single bite.
-   Several of the bosses in _Dragon's Crown_ that has a bite attack naturally come with lots of teeth to chew you with. Most notable among them is the boss in the B Path of the Lost Woods, which looks rather benign until it opens a mouth larger than the rest of its head and shows its rows of nasty, big, pointy teeth.
-   The Kayran from _The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings_, a part-crab and part-cephalopod monster, has plenty of teeth in its mouth.
-   Undyne from _Undertale_ has so many sharp teeth, she can't even fully cover them with her lips, leaving her with a constant Slasher Smile. It becomes a minor plot point during her "I Know You're in There Somewhere" Fight segment of the True Final Boss battle when one of the things player has to do to snap her out of the trance is remind her how much she liked to smile.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, this is a trait of Daedroths, a crocodilian form of lesser Daedra. They have rows of razor-sharp teeth.
-   _StarCraft 2_ plays this for laughs:
    
    **Dehaka:** I have so many teeth! Must evolve toothbrush.
    
-   In _Eat Me_, Frypan Frederick, who is made of frogs' legs, has these:
    
    No eyes, poor dear, nor nose, nor ears: that's what you get with a leg for a head. At least he has a mouth, and what a mouth, with human teeth in the hundreds to compensate.
    
-   The swamp krakken boss from _Eternity: The Last Unicorn_, who resembles the classical Giant Squid monster (of the Humboldt squid variety) save for having _spiked_ tentacles and a gigantic mouth lined with hundreds of razor-sharp teeth, which it uses to chomp you down.
-   By virtue of having _a mouth that extends down her torso_, the Widow enemy from _WRATH: Aeon of Ruin_ has a _lot_ of teeth. On the bright side, it means quite a bit more ammo for the Fang Spitter to use when you kill one.
-   Almost everything in the Gluttony area of _Dante's Inferno_. The normal enemies with multiple faces<small>◊</small>? The background with massive teeth snapping at you<small>◊</small>? Cerberus who is a nightmare of giant human body with three fleshy heads consisting of multiple teeth that try to eat each other? The third circle of hell got 'em all!
-   _Paranormal HK_ have the ghosts, whose teeth are several _inches_ high and bulges out their mouths, especially evident in one Jump Scare cutscene where a spooky ghost-girl lunges at you,
-   _Pathfinder: Kingmaker_: The Troll King Hargulka's lower jaw consists of an absolutely massive amount of teeth, even for a troll.
-   _Monster Hunter 3 (Tri)_ introduces the Deviljho, a constantly ravenous T. rex-like monster that stands out among other examples. How so? Not all of its teeth are in its mouth.

-   In _El Goonish Shive_, the Goo, especially in its Omega Goo form has countless sharp teeth.
-   Florence Ambrose of _Freefall_ has these, but she struggles to keep them hidden, as long as she remembers, since humans tend to react badly to them. Example: Snap!

-   The Joker in all his cartoon incarnations (_Batman: The Animated Series_, _The New Batman Adventures_,_Justice League_, and _Batman Beyond_) so much so that when Mark Hamill auditioned for the part in _Batman: The Animated Series_, he commented in a Making Of video that the Joker seemed to be "all teeth".
-   Sky-byte's _Transformers: Animated_ version<small>◊</small>, as seen in the _Transformers Animated Allspark Almanac_. Terrified yet? The different version of him shown in _Decepti-Con Job_ is far less horrifying.
-   _Transformers: Prime_ brings us the Scraplets. Two feet tall... with mouths that make up about a third of that height. They make a sound like a chainsaw revving when they open their jaws. According to Bulkhead, they bite their way into a mechanoid and then eat them alive from the inside out.

    Real Life 

-   Sharks, both living and extinct. Not only do they have a complete set of choppers, but they have multiple replacement sets growing right behind the first set. This is because when you eat like a shark, you go through teeth _fast_. Most sharks have anywere from 50-300 teeth.
-   Leatherback Sea Turtles have mouths lined throughout with sharp teeth. This is not so much a malicious example as a practical one—their main diet is jellyfish.
-   Crocodilians. Their teeth are not designed for cutting or grinding but are designed for grabbing and holding. So they're shaped more like dull railroad spikes that are driven into your limbs so they can rip chunks off of you when they spin their bodies. And, like sharks and dinosaurs, the teeth are designed to fall out and be replaced easily. Crocodiles have up to 66 teeth, alligators up to 80, and gharials up to 110.
-   Humans. When they are young, children will have two sets of teeth; their baby/milk teeth, and their adult teeth beneath. This means that a child's skull will contain both<small>◊</small>, even if they aren't in the mouth at the same time.
    -   Sometimes, humans young and older will suffer from hyperdontia, where their mouths become unsightly jumbles of uneven teeth.
-   Lampreys have a sucker that is full of sharp teeth and serves as their mouth. And they use it to latch on to a fish, so they can suck on its blood, until said fish dies. They even have a trope named after them that's about this very same kind of mouth.
