_"Do you know I'm an assassin who's **never** killed anyone?"_

In this world there are tons of people and organizations who specialize in Professional Killers, who have racked up tons of kills under their belts. But there are members of these groups who, despite being with them for a long period of time, have never secured a kill of their own before. These instances may result from lack of confidence, experience, opportunity or any other factors that explain why, usually driving them to try and get their first kill.

When these guys _do_ get their first kill, expect them to be ecstatic about it, gaining more confidence and determination to perform more kills afterward. Except if it turns into Suicidal Overconfidence, then expect it to be the first and last kill of their short career. Could be justified if they work more as the Mission Control, or intel gatherer, or (at worst) a field assistant, who doesn't confront the targets directly.

However in some works, a kill will not count if the victim is not human, a monster, or a being that Was Once a Man but discarded their humanity and will only apply to a human killing another human. What Measure Is a Non-Human? will come into play here if this is the case.

Possible Sub-Trope of The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything. Compare Gaining the Will to Kill, These Hands Have Killed and Bleed 'Em and Weep, when someone's first kill causes them emotional angst, It Gets Easier, when a character suffers emotional trauma when they first kill, but subsequent killings have less effect on them, and It Never Gets Any Easier, when dealing with death (including killing), a character has emotional trauma no matter how many deaths (killings) they've been involved with. Another bad outcome is Murder Makes You Crazy.

    Film — Live Action 

-   In _Black Patch_, Young Gun Carl is determined to avenge Hank by killing Marshal Clay Morgan. However, while he is extremely skilled with a gun, he has never shot a man before.
-   In _The Island (1980)_, teenager Justin is The Gunfighter Wannabe, and thinks becoming a pirate will allow him to live out all of his fantasies. However, he has never given any thought to what the emotional toll of killing another human might be. After making his first kill, he is shocked and sickened, loses his nerve, and starts to crack up.
-   Billy Valance in _More Dead Than Alive_. A trick shot artist in Ruffalo's traveling shooting show, Billy believes that he is great gunslinger and a ruthless killer, but has never been in a real gunfight. Cain keeps showing him up by demonstrating that things are different when the target can shoot back: such as slapping him in the face before he can draw his gun. The only person Billy manages to kill is Ruffalo who is unarmed. And this act puts Cain on his trail looking for revenge.
-   In _The Seven Samurai_, Katsushiro is an apprentice samurai who never killed before; during the defense of the village, he loses his killing virginity (and his sexual virginity as well shortly thereafter).
-   _Unforgiven_ has the Schofield Kid approach homesteader William Munny about collecting a bounty in Big Whiskey. Kid claims to have killed three men, but always one at a time; there are two targets in Big Whiskey, so the Kid figures to have a wingman. After the killing's done, the Kid consoles himself with whiskey, and admits that he'd never killed before. The deed clearly unnerved him.
-   In _The Whole Nine Yards_:
    -   Jill, the assistant to dentist Dr. Nicolas Oseransky, is actually a newbie assassin whose first job was to kill "Oz", as the doctor is often called. She got the job as a dental assistant as part of an effort to get close to him, learn his habits, and make it easier to kill him and cover up her hand in it. However, Oz was such a Nice Guy and so genuinely decent that she found herself unable to go through with the assignment. (The fact that her employer, Oz's wife, is a godawful human being whose only motive is greed didn't do anything to convince her to go through with it.) She does eventually get her first kill late in the movie when she helps longtime assassin Jimmy Tedeski and his friend Frankie Figgs ambush and kill the gangster Janni Gogolák and his men.
    -   Jimmy tells a similar story of having once being a young killer who got too close and friendly with a target and found himself unable to go through with killing him. He opted to warn the guy about the hit on him and tell the guy to flee. Unlike Oz, the guy was a fellow criminal, and he repaid Jimmy's kindness by shooting Jimmy in the back. Jimmy no longer had any qualms about killing the guy, and Jimmy all but says that he horrifically tortured the guy to death as payback.

-   _The Brothers Cabal_: The Dee Society reluctantly accepts the vampire Horst's help to fight an army of monsters, assuming it to be an Enemy Mine situation. He's deeply distraught afterwards; the Society members are shocked to realize he'd never killed before and truly is the Friendly Neighborhood Vampire he appears to be.
-   In _The Garden of Sinners_, this is a big part of Shiki's character. Despite repeatedly stumbling onto murder scenes and routinely killing supernatural beings like ghosts, she constantly suppresses a psychological urge to kill fellow humans and never once takes the life of another human being until the final book, when she symbolically crosses this threshold by killing Lio. This is eventually revealed to be an expression of her grandfather's philosophy, who claimed that a person can only ever kill one other person, because the act of killing irrevocably changes the murderer into something slightly less than human.
-   _Jarhead_: The cast do very little killing despite being snipers during the Gulf War due to the prominence of aircraft and artillery.

-   _Pyramids_ sees Pteppic, Prince of Djelibeybi, graduate from seven long hard years at the Assassins' Guild School. He realises the awful truth during his Final Exam: that despite having trained to do it, he is not temperamentally at home with the idea of actually _killing_ people. For an Assassin, this is something of a drawback.
-   _The Valley of Fear_: Two inexperienced members of the Scourers are tasked with hosting a pair of killers there to do a job and insist on participating in the 'fun'. After the deed is done it turns out it's not so much fun anymore.
