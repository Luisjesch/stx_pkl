_"A walking skeleton, the basic frame of the human body, can inspire more fear in the common man than an excessively armed soldier or knight."_

Animate beings constructed from ossific material in their entirety are a very common form of The Undead in video games, but much rarer in other media, to the point where, as an object of fear, they have become slightly camp. They're cousins to the Zombie in spirit, but remain explicitly separated in the public consciousness by the lack of flesh and other juicy bits. A likely explanation for their ability to see and hear, not to mention _move_ without any muscles, and indeed their status as Perpetual Motion Monsters is a necromancer used Functional Magic to raise and operate them. Thus, these creatures are firmly inhabitants of Fantasy works. You might know them as skeletons. We call 'em "Dem Bones".

And wouldn't you know... There's a skeleton inside you right now! ... Of course you don't actually count, 'cuz you have flesh and organs over those bones. Anyway...

There are human, non-human, and weirder variants, and in 99% of their appearances, they're enemy Mooks. Their prevalence in Role Playing Games is owed to _Dungeons & Dragons_, which established them as the slaves of necromancers. When they aren't Mooks, they're usually liches, which are much nastier, because they tend to be powerful mages. Skeletal spellcasters who are **not** liches are rare (in cases where "skeletal spellcaster" isn't the outright ''definition'' of a lich, that is), but not nonexistent.

Often enough, Dem Bones are reused in the same game _à la_ Underground Monkey. Expect, in the spirit of a Zombie Minotaur, to find double-category monsters, like a skeletal mammoth or dragon. Many games have even tougher skeletons that are colored red. This could be because the red ones are a little more skilled and covered in the blood of hapless adventurers who couldn't best them.

A prominent variation is a being composed of just a skull without a body. In this case, their ability to attack may be a simple bite, or through magic spells. They may or may not also have the power to defy gravity to compensate for the lack of legs. As trope examples indicate, there are a noticeably greater number of friendly talking skulls compared to the rare Friendly Skeleton.

In video games, skeletal foes will often attack by throwing bones. One cannot help but wonder where they get _dem_ bones from. Some versions are difficult to harm with ordinary swords or arrows, but can be dealt with using blunt weapons or magic. But be warned: many have the ability to pull themselves back together after you knock them apart.

In Mexico, Dem Bones are called _Calacas_ and are associated with the Day of the Dead holiday much the same way bunnies are associated with Easter, making them less common as stock spooky elements (they tend to be more comedic). It helps that said calacas are made of sugar and chocolate.

See also Skull for a Head and Stripped to the Bone. May or may not be prone to dancing. A unique example is The Grim Reaper, so ubiquitous it's its own trope. If the Skeleton is friendly and/or comical, it's a Friendly Skeleton. See also Bad with the Bone if bones are used as Improvised Weapons, and Ballistic Bone if they're used as Abnormal Ammo. A Walking Ossuary is when bits from multiple skeletons are assembled into a single chimeric whole.

If the skeleton is really a robot, see SkeleBot 9000.

-   As Bones Coffee would imply, every label has a depiction of at least one human skeleton on it. Apparently, they are all the same skeleton, aptly named "Bones."
-   An advertisement for Pillow Cube features a talking skeleton that is used to demonstrate how the product supports side sleepers better than a normal pillow.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Berserk_: In Episode 2 of the Black Swordsman Arc, "The Brand", the evil spirits attracted to Guts' Brand Of Sacrifice possess the skeletal corpses of warriors who died at an old battlefield and use them to attack. The Skull Knight also appears to be an armor-wearing undead skeleton, although since he is the most powerful known being opposing the Godhand, he is actually the closest thing the series has to a Big Good.
-   _Bleach_: Barragan Luisenbarn turns into a skeleton dressed in a crown and robes upon releasing his zanpakuto, and his original form before becoming an Arrancar was a mighty Hollow, possibly even a Vasto Lorde level, in the form of a similar skeleton. This is to symbolize his power over old age and decay, which lets him rot _other_ people into skeletons. The dead kind.
-   _Buster Keel!_ has the skeletal army summoned by Jack Bone.
-   In _Delicious in Dungeon_, walking skeletons are a type of monster that can be found in the titular dungeon. They occur when a dead body is possessed by a wandering spirit and, because the ghost inhabiting it isn't the right one, the flesh rots off.
-   _Digimon Adventure_: SkullGreymon is giant, freakily shaped dinosaur skeleton that launches fish-looking rockets from its back. SkullGreymon is one of Greymon's evolutions and it returns in _Digimon Adventure 02_.
-   _Fairy Tail ZERØ_: The dragon skeleton of Blue Skull is an example of this. Once under the Sirius Orb's influence, it ultimately becomes a Dracolich.
-   Horohoro from _Galaxy Express 999_ episode "The Skeleton's Song"; after having his heart broken by the woman he was in love with, he slowly lost one part of his body every time she betrayed him until he was reduced to a living skeleton with a hole in place of his ribcage.
-   _The Keeper Wants to Build a Zoo in Another World, so He Tames Monsters_: Two kids, Mensh and Gwena, accidentally awaken a bunch of murderous skeleton warriors, only to be saved by Merou, Ikuhara, and Cerberus. According to Merou, they're manifestations of magic rather than animated human bodies. A Gashadokuro appears as well.
-   Docky from _Midnight Horror School_, while not a real skeleton, is a plastic skeleton. Also a majority of the school's faculty are living skeletons.
-   Morborgran of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, the massive, Multi-Armed and Dangerous, skeletal demon member of the Canis Niger bounty hunters in the Magic World. He's actually a pretty friendly guy, though with a bit of a complex about his appearance.
-   _One Piece_: In the Thriller Bark arc, the Straw Hats meet Brook, who's eaten a Devil Fruit that lets him come back to life once. But due to the fog in the area he was in, he got lost on his way back to his mortal body. By the time he found it, it was nothing but bones. Although initially freaked out by his own appearance, he eventually adapted and grew a habit of making puns about it. Constantly. He also came to discover that being a skeleton has surprising advantages over being made of flesh, such as making him a lot faster and lighter. He eventually joins the crew as their musician and second swordsman.
-   In _RWBY (2015)_, the body of the Cephalopod looks like a giant horned skull.
-   Shiro from _Shakugan no Shana_. His true form, though, is a Bishōnen.
-   Used by a Faust VII in _Shaman King_, quite drastically - in his fight against the main character, he insisted it be held on a Western (Christian) graveyard, where the dead were not cremated, so he could use their skeletons to launch a mass attack at our protagonist. On top of it, he carried his deceased wife's skeleton under his clothes and used it as a secret weapon.
-   _Shonen Sarutobi Sasuke_: As she keeps exhausting her powers against Sasuke during the final battle, Yakusha transforms from someone who at least appears human into a decrepit old woman and then into an animated skeleton that ultimately falls to pieces when she gets a dagger in the skull.
-   Similar to the above, we have the title character from the Manhwa _Skeleton Soldier Couldn't Protect the Dungeon_.
-   The title character from _Skull-face Bookseller Honda-san_ is drawn as a skeleton (an entire one, not just a Skull for a Head like the title indicates). He isn't literally a skeleton though, he's a human in an entirely mundane setting.
-   Admiral Perry, the Big Bad of _Space☆Dandy_. He first appears as a flaming skull with a body composed of stars, though later episodes show that he has bony arms as well.

    Arts 

-   _Shipping Leviathan — Ark of Apocalypse_: Part of the ship's crew (as well as the scaffold) is made of human skeleton beings.

    Asian Animation 

-   In the _Motu Patlu_ episode "Bhoot Bangla", Motu and Patlu go to a mansion that is said to be haunted and, sure enough, among the things they find in it are walking, talking skeletons. They're actually being controlled by Jon the Don in an attempt to scare the duo.

    Card Games 

-   In _Magic: The Gathering_, skeletons are closely tied to the "regenerate" mechanic. Most creatures with the Skeleton creature type have an ability that allows them to keep fighting after they've been destroyed, a tradition that began in the very first expansion with Drudge Skeletons. (Ordinary undead minions that don't regenerate are typically classified as regular Zombies instead.) Skeletal Grimace has a ghoulcaller pointing out that everyone has a skeleton _inside_ them already...and there's no real need to wait for someone to die first before controlling it. The card grants a minor power and toughness boost to the enchanted creature and a "regenerate" mechanic just like that of skeleton creatures'.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, there is the Wight archetype. Originally, this was nothing more than Skull Servant, a Joke Item at best, as it was weak and had no real function (aside from a few Fusion Monsters who were equally bad) but eventually, cards were introduced to make it playable, like King of the Skull Servants, The Lady in Wight, Wightmare, and Wightprince.

    Comic Books 

-   Fairly common in pre-Comics Code horror, to the point where David Hajdu's _The Horror! The Horror! Comic Books the Government Didn't Want You to Read!_ contains an entire essay on their usage and associated tropes. Hajdu's observation is that they typically appear to avenge their own deaths with as much poetic justice as possible.
    
    _Unlike the zombie, skeletons are neither "natural" (staggering like a living person) nor "unnatural" (staggering despite mortal wounds), but are abstractions from a body. They are, in fact, traditional allegorical images — from the medieval memento mori. They are symbols sprung to life and strangely able to manipulate the material world. The uncanniness of the skeleton in this regard is not to be underestimated._
    
-   In _Agents of Atlas_, the organization fights mobile skeletons so much it borders on a Running Gag.
-   _Bill & Ted's Excellent Comic Book_: Death is a skeleton because Evan Dorkin didn't see any stills from the _Bill & Ted_ movies until he was a third of the way through the comic and it was too late to redraw.
-   In _Bizarrogirl_, Supergirl suffers several nightmares where her enemy Superwoman, her parents and all deceased Kryptonians turn into walking, rag-wearing skeletons and try to drag her down into Hell.
-   Zigzagged with Ghost Rider, whose skeleton form is largely Depending on the Artist. In more than a few comics, only the head is a burning skull and rest is normal, see 1,000,000 BC Ghost Rider. Yet the majority of the time the riders e.g Johnny Blaze have their bodies become skeletons as well as revealed by Clothing Damage or the Marvel Swimsuit Special.
-   In the _Superman_ story _The Jungle Line_, the Man of Steel is attacked by the skeletons of some species of mammoth-like Kryptonian beast during one hallucination.
-   In _The DCU_ event _Blackest Night_ event, black power rings re-animate dead characters, typically making them look like slightly-decayed versions of their former selves. The body of Boston Brand, aka _Deadman_, however, had been dead so long that his Black Lantern version is little more than a skeleton with a black version of his costume stretched over it. In some stories (most notably, _Kingdom Come_), Deadman's ghostly form also appears significantly more skeletal than usual.
-   _Conan the Barbarian_: In "The Valley of the Howling Shadows" (The Savage Sword of Conan #118, November 1985), Conan and his followers meet a group of talking and walking skeletons. The skeletons are the nicest and friendliest characters in the entire story, but their dialogue creeps Conan out. They claim that Conan looks familiar to them, suspect that they have seen him before, and ask him whether he is related to them through their families. They also indicate that they would like to know him better. Conan retreats quickly. Notably, for most of the scene, the skeletons pay no attention to the other characters present.
-   _The Crawling King_ contains plenty of illustrations of living skeletons. From one of a frog riding a dog skeleton, to a story of a woman whose skeleton leaves her body.
-   In _The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones_ #33-34, an Evil Sorcerer raises a skeletal army of Viking warriors to kill Indy, or—at the very least—keep him occupied until the soccer's evil ritual is completed.

-   _Pierre Tombal_: In this Black Comedy comic book about a gravedigger at his local cemetery all dead bodies are living skeletons who spent their afterlife on the cemetery and are treated as residents. Usually they spent their activities underground.
-   In _Pretty Deadly_, the entire story is being narrated by Bones Bunny, a skeletal bunny. In addition, Death is a skeleton (not with a human skull, but rather an animal one).
-   In _Seconds (2014)_, the Seconds restaurant employs some walking, talking skeletons when reality starts to break apart.
-   In one crossover, Savage Dragon and Hellboy fought the undead skeletons of pirates while inside of a giant sea monster.
-   Similarly to Mr. Bones, _Tom Strong_ had a minor villain named Charlie Bones, a gangster with invisible flesh who was supposedly the first villain Tom fought after coming to the USA.
-   In _Tragg and the Sky Gods_ #9, the Necromancer Ostellon, Master of the Living Bones reanimates the skeletons of the tribe that used to inhabit the caves that Tragg's tribe have just moved into and uses them to attack Keera

    -   _Vol 1_:
        -   When Artemis, Diana's predecessor as the Amazon's champion, is "revived" by Circe she comes back as a vengeful walking skeleton clad only in the scraps remaining of her armor.
        -   The henchmen the Adjudicator created as manifestations of his will modeled after the Horsemen of the Apocalypse in _Judgment In Infinity_ were each skeletal figures wearing cloaks.
    -   _Vol 2_: When Hippolyta is confronted by her guilty conscience she faces a skeletal Diana accusing her of killing her by siphoning her power to Artemis in order to ensure Diana didn't win The Contest. This _did_ end up getting Diana killed, which was precisely what Polly was trying to prevent after having a premonition that Wonder Woman would die.
-   _Yorick and Bones_: Yorick, one of the protagonists of the comic, is a magically-resurrected skeleton who was dug up by Bones.

-   In _The Book of Life_, both La Muerte and the Spirits of the Dead are based on _calacas_, skeleton figures which are decorated on The Day of the Dead, specifically the ones made out of candy. In particular, La Muerte’s overall design in particular is inspired by the iconic _La Calavera Catrina_ of Mexican culture.
-   Similarly, in _Coco,_ the inhabitants of the Land of the Dead are walking, talking, clothed skeletons with colorful facial markings like those found on sugar skulls. They can detach their bones from their bodies with no ill effects and their body parts can move independently even when not attached to their bodies.
    -   Lampshaded when one of the customs officials in the Land of the Dead is allergic to Dante, the Mexican Hairless dog:
        
        **Miguel**: But, Dante doesn't have any hair!  
        **Skeleton**: And I don't have a nose, and yet here we are. _\[sneezes\]_
        
-   _Corpse Bride_. The inhabitants of the Underworld are either zombie-like or skeletal. Not that that makes them any less fun to hang around.
-   The B-17 segment of _Heavy Metal_ has the Loc-Nar reanimate dead crew of the B-17 as skeletons, melting away the flesh in the process, which have Super-Strength and crave human flesh. Its influence spreads to a Derelict Graveyard on an island, reanimating the pilots' bodies to corner the B-17's pilot in a Bolivian Army Ending.
-   A Gashadokuro appears in _Kubo and the Two Strings_. It guards the Sword Unbreakable, which is embedded in his skull, along with dozens of regular swords. Removing it causes the Gashadokuro to fall apart.
-   _The Last Unicorn_: A talking, _wise-cracking_ skeleton appears.
-   A lot of animate skeletons appear in _Monster Mash (2000)_.
-   Jack Skellington, of _The Nightmare Before Christmas_ is, well, a skeleton. He's the hero, so that's OK.
-   _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_: Luigi gets chased by a horde Dry Bones shortly after he lands in the Dark Lands. And later, when Bowser reveals to his troops his plans to marry Peach, one Koopa soldier makes the unfortunate mistake of asking "What if she says no?" He gets roasted by Bowser's fire breath and turned into a Dry Bones for his trouble.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Extraordinarily common in early cinema. Sprightly, dancing and otherwise animated skeletons appear with great regularity in the trick films of Georges Méliès and his contemporaries.

-   _Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion_ has Lou hallucinating a talking skeleton while in the desert.
-   Most of the "Deadite" army in _Army of Darkness_. Evil Ash ends up this way (sans his eyes) after Ash sets him on fire.
-   Tim Burton examples, which in addition to the aforementioned _Corpse Bride_ and _Nightmare Before Christmas_ shows the extent of his inspiration in Gothic Horror and German Expressionism.
    -   _Beetlejuice_ includes the charred ghost of a man who died in a house fire caused by his own smoking addiction.

-   _Halloweentown_ has a wisecracking skeleton, Benny, drive the local taxi.
-   Many of the zombies that attack the Evers in _The Haunted Mansion (2003)_.
-   In a memorable film example, Ray Harryhausen's animated skeletons make up half of a Chroma Key battle scene in _Jason and the Argonauts_, after they sprout from the earth where hydra teeth are sown. However in the original myths, they were instead flesh-and-blood warriors called _spartoi_.
-   Such a skeleton appears at the climax of _House on Haunted Hill (1959)_. It's less elaborate than the above examples though, which is ultimately justified because it's a "Scooby-Doo" Hoax, operated by Vincent Price's character. In theaters, it was originally set up to have a plastic skeleton on wires fly over the audience, but it posed a tempting target to kids with slingshots and other projectiles.
-   The ghostly skeletal army in Peter Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_.
-   _The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra_ has this. Of course, since it's an Affectionate Parody of cheesy movies from The '50s, there's probably a number of straight examples from that era that no one really remembers.

-   _The Return of the Living Dead_ features a brief but memorable scene where a reanimated skeleton rises from a grave. It's never seen again after that. There is also Tarman, a prominently-featured zombie so decayed he's a skeleton held together with rotting muscle tissue and a thick black substance (hence the word “tar” in his name) ; unlike the skeleton, different Tarman zombies show up in two more films, albeit with designs of lesser quality compared to the original.
-   Parodied in _Scary Movie 2_, when Cindy is being chased by a skeleton, only to be reprimanded by Brenda for being afraid. To illustrate her point, Brenda pulls the skeleton apart and reassembles him badly.
    
    **Brenda:** Cindy this is a skeleton. This is bones. Would you run from Calista Flockhart?

-   José Guadalupe Posadas is the man who started the "calavera" trend in Mexico. What is often confused by people as Dia de los Muertos symbolism is actually a harsh social critique against the higher social classes that seem to not realize that they're going to die. Eventually this art form evolved and merged with Dia de los Muertos itself, portraying more than just rich skulls but also every Mexican out there.

    Food & Drink 

-   During the Halloween season, Cheetos has their white cheddar flavored "Bag of Bones", whose four shapes are a straight bone, skull, rib cage, and hand/foot.

    Gamebooks 

-   Skeletons are a reoccurring enemy type in the _Fighting Fantasy_ series of books, with notable villains such as Zanbar Bone (_City of Thieves (1983)_), Razaak (_Crypt of the Sorcerer_), Chancellor Unthank (_Night of the Necromancer_) and Mencius (_Magehunter_) capable of summoning skeleton warriors as mooks to deal with the players.
    -   Oddly enough, in their very first appearance in the very first book, _The Warlock of Firetop Mountain_, the skeletons are depicted as labourers building a boat for the titular warlock, with armed warrior-skeletons only appearing afterwards.

    Literature 

-   Horrorman and Horako from _Anpanman_. Horrorman's a pretty nice guy (at least, when he's on the heroes' side) and Horako's a sweet little girl... even though her imagination has a tendency to go over the top and she's actually a sea princess.
-   _The Asterisk War_: Gustave Malraux, an Enemy Summoner who specializes in beasts out of Classical Mythology, uses "dragons' teeth" to summon the Spartoi as they were depicted in the film _Jason and the Argonauts_. They're no match whatsoever for Kirin Toudou, who has added techniques to deal with multiple enemies to her repertoire.
-   _The Bartimaeus Trilogy_ has Honorius, a powerful and murderously insane Afrit. Instead of manifesting himself in a physical form like most magical creatures, Honorius' essence is instead infused into the skeleton of the long-dead magician president Gladstone. He basically acts as a "living" security system against people trying to pilfer the mage's tomb, who open it up only to see the skeleton spring up and brutally obliterate them.
-   The hermit's ghost in _The Castle of Otranto_.
-   _Bruce Coville's Book of... Monsters_: The title character of _Kokolimalayas, the Bone Man_ is a giant skeleton.

-   _The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time_: The appropriately named Bone Man is one of the first undead our protagonist creates, and while at first he's not much stronger than the average skeleton, in time he grows to be one of the deadlier fighters under Vandalieu's command. Funny thing is his skeleton was possessed by mice spirits who were given human-level sentience.
-   There's a "very old zombie" in Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ book _The Last Hero_ who is basically a skeleton. Additionally, Death uses a living horse because he hates having to keep wiring the skeletal one together.

    -   And now there's Charlie, the Department of Necr- Post-Mortem Communications' resident skeleton, who's been there "forever".
    -   In _Reaper Man_, the New Death rides a skeletal horse. After Bill Door defeats this upstart and reclaims his position as Death, Miss Flitworth decides to keep it, because any hay it "eats" just falls through its ribs to the stable floor, making it cheap to feed.
-   In _Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm Queen of the Dead_, Francis starts terrorizing L.A. with his undead army of empowered skeletons.
-   _The Dresden Files_ is borderline - there's Bob the Skull, a spirit who lives inside a skull, but it is merely a casing, and Bob leaves it when he needs mobility. When a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton was reanimated in book 7 "Dead Beat"; the higher quality a reanimated being, the more life-like they appear. (broadly)
-   Sid is a walking, talking skeleton in _Family Skeleton Mysteries_.
-   Inverted in the _Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser_ stories: "Lankhmar Ghouls" are perfectly normal, living, breathing humanoids who just happen to have invisible body tissues—except for their bones.
-   _Forest Kingdom_: In book 2 (_Blood and Honor_), early on, Jordan and his escorts are confronted by Bloody Bones, a Transient Being in the form of a nine-foot, bloody (and blood-drinking) skeleton.

-   _Mermaid Moon_: Baroness Thyrla has prolonged her life by many years by stealing the remaining lifespans of other people, including her mother, her uncle, her husband, and all but one of her children. She keeps the bones of her victims in her bedroom, where they can speak and have limited movement. They act as her advisors.
-   _Nine Goblins_: The cervidians, magical creatures which resemble animate deer skeletons, are very similar to this. Except they're specifically noted to still be ALIVE somehow, the bones held together with a fine organic webbing. They're not actually evil, but are distinctly sinister and are drawn to magical disturbances.
-   In _Overlord_, main character Ainz Ooal Gown is a skeleton — a Lich, to be more exact. Well, to be even more exact, he is a regular guy permanently stuck in the body and world of his video game character, but that's beside the point. Of course, as a godlike Necromancer Sorcerous Overlord, he also has legions of skeletal minions at his beck and call.

-   The Andre Norton novel _Quag Keep_, which was based on _Dungeons & Dragons_.
-   _The Rifter_: The walls at the convent of Umbhra’ibaye are strung with bones who are issusha’im: women who’ve been stripped of their flesh but kept alive, with charms carved on the bones. This somehow gives them the power to see through time, seeing multiple possible futures as well as (maddeningly) the lives that they might have lived if they hadn’t been turned into issusha’im. The Payshmura use the issusha’im’s soothsaying to avert future events that they don’t want. It’s a Fate Worse than Death, but at least it’s possible for them to take on flesh again, which is a considerable improvement, if they escape Umbhra’ibaye. Ji, a talking dog, is an issusha who took the body of a dog and is now a leader of the Fai’daum. She’s centuries old and has very powerful magic as well as soothsaying abilities. Laurie was taken partway through the issusha-making process and they used the blood of her own baby to create the enchantment. She’s now part-flesh, part-walking skeleton. Understandably mentally unstable, she’s been using those enchantments herself, but only managing to create "hungry bones", monstrosities patched together from human and animal bones which thirst for blood.

-   The titular character of the _Skulduggery Pleasant_ books is a centuries old living skeleton. The secondary protagonist, when being introduced to the supernatural for the first time, actually points out that he has no muscles to move with or lungs to speak with and asks how he works. He is rather disgruntled and gives the simple answer "it's magic". Later on, she wonders if he can whistle without lungs (he can). He's also entirely unique, with _how_ he ended up like that being a long running question. The answer is that Skulduggery was naturally magically ambidextrous, with vast potential as a Necromancer as well as an Elemental. The necromancer who discovered that potential took the chance to install a failsafe in the Red Right Hand of Skulduggery's arch-enemy so it wouldn't _quite_ kill him, because he was curious to see what would happen. The answer was an extremely angry living skeleton turned necromancer better known as 'Lord Vile'.

    Music 

-   Alice in Chains's song "Them Bones".
-   The song "Spooky Scary Skeletons" by Andrew Gold, best known for its association with the "2spooky" meme, is about how the eponymous skeletons will torment you. The song is a very good example of the erosion of the skeleton as a source of horror.
-   Camille Saint Saens' well-known _Danse Macabre_ (1874), a symphonic poem describing skeletons rising from their tomb to dance. Notable for having introduced the xylophone in European Music, to imitate the rattling of the bones.
-   The children's song "Ghost of John" describes the titular ghost as a skeleton:
    
    ♬ Have you seen the ghost of John?  
    Long white bones and the rest all gone  
    Ooooooooooooh  
    Wouldn't it be chilly with no skin? ♬

    Mythology and Religion 

-   The Bible had the story of Ezekiel and the Valley of the Dry Bones that came to life and inspired the Trope Namer "Dry Bones"/"Dem Bones" song. The trope-naming song is based on a Biblical incident involving Ezekiel, who was told by God to create an army of these things with a prophecy. The Bible is surprisingly metal, in places. The bones are immediately given flesh and souls during their resurrections, instead of being a literal skeleton army like those created by Ray Harryhausen.
-   The Gashadokuro from Japanese Mythology is a super sized version of this. This monster is created from collecting the skeletons of people who have died _en masse_ without getting a proper burial (usually from famine, disease, or warfare). It is known to bite the heads off humans it encounters and to be forewarned of by a ringing in the ears. They often grow up to 15 times larger than a man.
    -   The Hone-onna<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  creates a look of a beautiful woman, based on how she looked when she was alive, to get close to her chosen lover and drain him of life so they can be together forever. The problem is it only works on him and everyone else sees a man flirting and caressing a rotting corpse.
    -   Another skeleton youkai is the Kyokotsu, a spectral skeleton formed from the spirits of those whose remains were simply thrown into wells instead of receiving a proper burial or committed suicide by throwing themselves into a well. They like to leap out of wells to scare people or place curses on them.
    -   The Bakekujira is the animated skeleton of a _whale_ feared as a harbinger of disaster for coastal villages, forever seeking vengeance against the humans that killed it.
-   The Pakahk from Cree mythology, similar to the Gashadokuro, are the animate bones of people who died from starvation. They have a chilling cackle, but sometimes they will help people with healing or hunting.
-   The Pauguk from Ojibway mythology, is a phantom with a skeletal appearance and eye sockets filled with balls of fire. It hunts people, often warriors, with invisible arrows or clubs.
-   Kokolimalayas from Modoc myth is the Bone Man, a giant skeleton who destroyed a village, drank of the river and left the earth barren, then went to sleep for a time. Eventually, after reawakening, he is destroyed by Nulwee, the boy who inadvertently revived him, and the rains return, allowing the people to return as well.

    Pinball 

-   In _3-D Ultra Pinball: Creep Night_, the player must hit various animated skeletons to return them to their dungeon cells.
-   _Bone Busters_ is all about an army of animated skeletons attacking the city of Chicago, and the oddly familiar proton-beam-firing heroes who must stop them.
-   _Crüe Ball_ has the Bad Bones, legless Skeletons that wander the playfield.
-   Skull the Bone Head in _No Fear: Dangerous Sports_, though his attacks are strictly verbal.
-   In _Pinball Quest,_ the main enemies of the first table are a set of animated skeletons.
-   Williams Electronics' _Scared Stiff_ has the "Boney Beast", a gigantic skeletal serpent that resides in the house of _Elvira, Mistress of the Dark_.
    
    **Elvira:** "This thing is huge... and _ribbed!_"
    
-   The Wizard Mode of _Tales of the Arabian Nights_ begins by having the player fight through several skeletal warriors before facing the evil genie of the game.
-   _Guns N' Roses (Jersey Jack)_ portrays every member of the band as a living, clothed skeleton in the game's artwork. This alludes to the replacement cover for their album _Appetite for Destruction_, which depicted the group as skulls.

    Roleplay 

-   Fesxis from _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_ is an otherwordly being whose appearance is noted to be similar to a human skeleton with a doe skull. The actual composition of her body seems closer to chitin than bone.
-   Exploited in _Nan Quest_. The Pilgrim looks like an example of this, but is actually just a squishy human wearing a costume — _precisely because_ it makes people assume they're an invincible skeleton. It _works_, too — players occasionally made suggestions that would have actually worked, such as strangling him with his own noose, only to be shot down by other players saying something to the effect of "He's a skeleton, are you crazy?"

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Captain Bones Gold_ is a boardgame in which you have to acquire gold doubloons while avoiding having it stolen by Captain Bones, a skeletal pirate who lives inside a treasure chest.
-   _The Dark Eye_: Skeletons are a very common type of undead, routinely created by necromancers who want cheap, plentiful troops without having to put up with the decomposition, clumsiness and bad smell of zombies. They are quicker and more agile than the walking corpses, although they're vulnerable to blunt weapons as these can shatter their bones.
-   _Dragon Dice_: Skeletons are one of the basic undead troop types — they move faster than zombies, but do less damage and are less capable of absorbing damage.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   A variety of skeletons exist, displaying different levels of power and intelligence. They're usually the result of spellcasters using necromancy, but a few have been known to spontaneously awaken in places of evil. Usually. Of course, there are also liches and their variants (archlich, baelnorn, banelich, master lich).
    -   The Basic Set of the first version of D&D had 4 kinds of golems, one of these was the Bone Golem which was a skeleton with 4 arms.
    -   The Dracolich is an undead evil dragon that has combines the powers of a dragon _and_ a lich. While their description does not specifically say they _have_ to be skeletal, most are depicted as such.
    -   While most settings are full of undead, _Forgotten Realms_ is especially fond of this theme and has the remarkable collection of unusual bones. For example, there lived — until she tried to raid a big temple of the god of wizardry, that is — Tashara of the Seven Skulls, who seduced and tricked into becoming spellcasting flying skulls (under her control) seven archmages, one after another. There's even one city _openly ruled by_ floating skulls (no, not Tashara's seven). _Realms_ is also the origin of the baelnorn and banelich.
    -   _Eberron_: The setting's "evil, schmevil" attitude (it subverts the Always Chaotic Evil trope _hard_) means that a nation like Karrnath can have a _significant portion of its army_ composed entirely of skeletons, and nobody thinks any differently about them because of it.
    -   _Planescape_ has "mimirs", recording devices shaped like metallic skulls.
    -   _Ravenloft_: The original products had a number of variants of this trope, such as archer skeletons whose ammo turns into more skeletons, or giant skeletons (enlarged human bones) that toss fireballs from the green flames ablaze inside their ribcages. Arthaus's _Van Richten's Guide to the Walking Dead_ has guidelines for customizing the Obedient Dead with all sorts of creepy abilities.
    -   The Demilich is a lich who had decided to leave his/her phylactery and use astral projection to learn from other realms. All that's left is a weathered skull or skeletal hand that skill can dish out a world of hurt by sucking the souls of anyone who bothers them or summoning Demiliches, six inch tall/long magic roaches with Skull for a Head. By the thousands.
    -   Apart from the lich, _D&D_ featured many other skeletal sentient undead, like the Death Knight (skeletal warrior), the Huecuva (skeletal divine spellcaster), or skeletal Ancient Dead (variant of the Mummy from the _Ravenloft_ setting).
    -   It should also be noted that, in 3rd edition anyway, just about _anything_ with bones that isn't already dead can be turned into Dem Bones through application of the Skeleton template. This includes everything from normal humanoids, to dragons, to bizarre aberrations with bone structures such have never been seen by mortal eyes.
-   _Godforsaken_: Skeletons are the most common servants of Crumellia the necromancer. Some are human, many belong to the extinct sapients that once ruled Flevame, many more are animal, and quite a lot resemble nothing that ever lived and were likely created by Crumilia as macabre works of art from bits and pieces of other things. For the most part they are little more than mindless automatons.

-   _Kings of War_ uses skeletons in much the same role, in much the same army, alongside the slightly less expendable, slightly better-dressed skeletons known as Revenants.
-   _LEGO Games_: Skeletons are among the minifigures you can find in _Monster 4_. You use them as wild cards; they act as one of the monsters you are placing in a row. The game's official description says the monsters play with the skeletons, implying sentience.
-   _Mage: The Awakening_ has these as a variation on the standard Animate Dead spell. The corpse's connective tissue and some of its flesh is transmuted into razor-edged metal plated around the bones (giving it damage resistance and a better attack) and it rips its way out of the rest of the flesh. It was invented by a member of a Black Metal band whose bandmates promptly declared the spell to be metal as hell.
-   _Mazes and Minotaurs_: Skeletons serve as mooks.
-   _Rattle Me Bones_, a game where you must remove accessories from a pirate's skeleton in a way that doesn't move its limbs too much, otherwise he'll **RATTLE AND SHAKE!**
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Floating servo-skulls — although they're robotic rather than undead.
    -   Not to mention the Necrons. No really, don't mention them, they aren't this trope. They are robots shaped like skeletons that function as Soul Jars for an ancient alien race.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy_: Skeletons are the basic grunt troops of the undead armies, serving the factions of Vampire Counts and Tomb Kings. The Vampire Counts use skeletons as expendable meat(bone?)shields, and that's about it. The Tomb Kings are an army of nothing but skeletons, with some mummies, animated statues and ancient, immortal priests to taste.

    Theme Parks 

-   These are seen in several of these at attractions in Disney Theme Parks, including in _Phantom Manor_, _Pirates of the Caribbean_, _Indiana Jones Adventure_, and _The Great Movie Ride_. More cheerful versions are in the Mexico pavilion at EPCOT. The skeletons in the original _Pirates of the Caribbean_ at Disneyland were real (arguably adding to their creepiness if you knew this), as replica skeletons at the time were not advanced enough to look realistic and old. They were obtained from a medical center and later received burials, with replicas taking their place in the ride. Supposedly, one real human skull still exists in the ride (attached to the headboard, above the skeletal pirate captain, in the grotto sequence), but Disney will neither confirm nor deny this.
-   Plenty of animated skeletons can be seen inside Europa-Park's Haunted House ride, "Geisterschloss".

    Toys 

-   _LEGO_ features skeleton minifigures in various series, primarily in _LEGO Castle_, _LEGO The Lord of the Rings_ and _Ninjago_.
-   _Pose Skeleton_ created by Re-Ment is a series of miniature skeletons along with various accessories, they're far smaller than Revolectech Skeletons, however they're as flexible as the latter, capable of wielding LEGO weapons and they're so lightweighted that they can be lifted by _Figma_ at ease.
-   _Revoltech_ once made the action figures of Skeleton Warrior from _Jason and the Argonauts_, the Revoltect joints on them are perfect for making stop motion movie, exactly what Ray Harryhausen made. It Makes Sense in Context, certainly. The Takeya series also has Japanese skeleton and its brother, Skeleton Samurai.
-   A majority of the characters in the _Treasure X_ toyline are skeleton treasure hunters that need to be unearthed from a sandstone and pieced together, along with a buried treasure.
-   _Vitruvian H.A.C.K.S._ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  series created by Boss Fight Studio features several skeletons warrior figures with Greek motif.

**Redcloak:** I didn't. They're human skeletons, I put a blue robe on them and called it a night. Heck, I had to put those colored pendants on them just to tell them apart.

-   _Our Little Adventure_ is set in an RPG Mechanics 'Verse and has both regular mindless skeleton minions and the Bone, skeletal undead who retain the minds and skills they had in life. Some of them are extremely unhappy about this.

-   _Talk With Monsters_, based on _D&D_, features a hero that scoffs at having to fight skeletons, maintaining that skeletons are not dangerous—they're what you get when you take a normal guy and remove things. In the dungeon, however, he sees the error of his ways: "Gaah! Super-pointy elbows!"
-   _Unsounded_'s Duane Adelier is a rare heroic example: a former rector and family man who died six years before the story begins and continues to inhabit his body via unknown means, which he hides with heavy clothing and glamours. His mind and his formidable magical skill are intact but his body decomposes at the normal rate; his tongue and eyes are magical prostheses and he scavenges pieces from cadavers to replace limbs that get too damaged. He strips the meat off those pieces for his own comfort: feeling them rot is _really_ unpleasant for him.

    Web Original 

-   Shows up a few times throughout the course of _The Adventure Zone: Balance_:
    -   Kravitz's skeletal form, which is supposedly what inspired The Grim Reaper mythos throughout the planar system which includes our world, as well.

-   _SCP Foundation_ has several skeletons, including the sad and scary case of SCP-3114. It's an animated skeleton and kills and skins any human or humanoid creature it comes into contact with and tries to wear it. When exposed to a simple border collie, 3114 was friendly to the dog and they played together for two hours before the dog was removed without incident. When exposed to an articulated skeleton for medical teaching, 3114 approaches and seems hopeful for a moment and then dejected when it realises the skeleton isn't alive. Finally, when it obtains a cadaver that fits perfectly and attempts to interact with a D-Class prisoner, it reacts with no hostility and even tries to hug him; when the (very disturbed) D-Class is recalled, 3114 stares at the door for a moment and then tears the skin off and kicks it into the corner and then lies down to "sleep" for several days before returning to its old behaviour. 3114 is just a confused and frustrated creature desperate to belong.
