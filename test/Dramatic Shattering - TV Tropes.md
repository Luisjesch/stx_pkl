_"**Never ever** give a fragile cup to anyone with psychic powers. You're only going to end up minus one cup and pissing off the janitor."_

Drama can be quite a vandal. It likes to break things just to punctuate the mood. Often takes the form of a dropped glass or other fragile item. This could often involve trying to catch it in slow motion, accompanied by a Desperate Object Catch. Yet smashing even upright things will do for dramatic emphasis.

Rage Against the Reflection, Broken-Window Warning, and A Glass in the Hand frequently are because of this trope.

A Sub-Trope of Rule of Drama.

A Super-Trope to Dramatic Drop, Slow-Motion Drop (save examples where it's Played for Laughs).

Compare Super Window Jump (awesomely breaking glass to herald one's appearance or retreat), Glass-Shattering Sound, Grievous Bottley Harm, Rockers Smash Guitars, and Symbolically Broken Object.

    Advertising 

-   The first "Cleaner Close" advert for Daz washing powder features a middle aged woman named Maureen berating her son for fooling around with a 'grubby girl' in the middle of the local pub (because the bra she found was grey instead of white). When she hands the bra back the girl says "But that's not my bra." Cue the shattering glass.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _AKIRA_ has a particularly memorable scene in which Tetsuo breaks the window of his hospital room as his powers awaken. He also steps on a glass cup as he stumbles away from the Espers, in a rare aversion of Soft Glass.
-   _Betrayal Knows My Name_: Reiga does this deliberately with a wine glass in episode 7.

-   Parodied in _Crayon Shin-chan_, with Shin Chan picking up a book, asking for his mother Misae to _repeat_ the bad news, and then dropping the book he is holding. This happens quite frequently in the manga and the anime.
-   _Death Note_: The first opening has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment where a glass statue of Light falls to the ground and breaks.
-   _GaoGaiGar_: As far as intentional breaking goes, they have Break In Case Of Monster of the Week glass covering a button as part of the over-the-top emphasis.
    -   The connector for the Goldion Crusher was designed for GaoFighGar. It was actually used by Genesic GaoGaiGar, whose arm is significantly bigger than GaoFighGar's. As Geki Hyuuma advised, Guy "adjusted with \[his\] **guts**!"
-   _Girls und Panzer_: When the Maus fires its 128mm cannon for the first time, all the windows on both sides of the street are shattered by the force.
-   _Hellsing_: there are two examples:

    -   The second being when Alucard's wine glass falls and shatters (in slo-mo!) before the start of his fight with Luke Valentine.
-   _K_:
    -   In the first episode, HOMRA's introduction is punctuated by Misaki's Super Window Jump, on his skateboard, from the roof of the building across the street. Because he can.

As a result, the stepsisters are told that they won't be forgiven for it and are subsequently fired.
-   _Umineko: When They Cry_ does this with its Eyecatch. It actually comes straight from the visual novel, which would use the effect whenever there was about to be a time lapse in the narration.
-   Parodied in _Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun_. Anytime Ameri's father Henri hears anything that can be _remotely_ interpreted as Ameri being in a relationship with Iruma, the lenses on his glasses burst into pieces before going back to normal. The first time this happened, it did so _four times in a row_, the absurdity of which Iruma lampshades.
    
    **Iruma:** How do they keep breaking?!
    
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Pegasus has his wine glass shattered after receiving a threatening message from Yami Yugi.

    Comic Books

-   Jason Todd's costume display case has this happen a lot in _Batman_. Maybe less now that he's alive.
-   _Star Wars: Darth Vader_ has a subdued but no less dramatic example, when Vader in his room on a Star Destroyer receives a report from Boba Fett, revealing that the Rebel pilot who destroyed the Death Star is named Skywalker.

-   Done with a cup of coffee when Shadow is freed in _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_.
-   Shows up as a result of a lot of power and anger in the _Danny Phantom_/_Beetlejuice_ crossover, _Say It Thrice_. When Betelgeuse observes Sanduleak through the reflections getting far too close to Lydia with some rather unpleasant plans in mind, Betelgeuse's frustrated anger shatters _all_ the reflective surfaces in the real world.
-   An episode of _Rose of Versailles Abridged_ discusses this.
    
    "In a specific trope that amps up drama, break things."
    
-   Done with a wine glass in _A Taste of the Good Life_ when Ebby decides not to throw herself Off the Wagon and to continue trying to regain her daughter's trust.

    Films — Animation

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Bicentennial Man_: Andrew's accidental breaking of young Little Miss's favorite glass horse figurine leads to his first demonstration of creativity as he carves her a new one out of wood. This replaces the scene where he creates a wooden necklace in the book.
-   The snow globe when the title character dies at the beginning of _Citizen Kane_.
-   Played for laughs in the _George of the Jungle_ movie. Ursula, the heroine, nervously reveals to her parents - during a reception held for her and her fiance - that she no longer wishes to get married to her fiance. Her parents respond with a cheery, "That's OK, dear. We understand." The Narrator then quips, "Just kidding!" before Ursula's mother lets out a harrowing scream and promptly drops her wine glass, shattering it on the floor.
-   _The Glass Cell_: Philip has been getting more and more suspicious that his wife, Lisa, is having an affair with his lawyer David. But when David puts his arm around Lisa's shoulder at her birthday party, Philip has a sort of spasm, knocking over a wine glass which dramatically shatters.

-   The Russian admiral in the film version of _The Hunt for Red October_ drops his tea while reading Ramius' letter.
-   Done surprisingly well in _Iron Man_. After learning that his weapons have been sold to a terrorist group without his consent and seeing the news report about how they're being used to terrorize an Afghan village, Tony Stark gets up and in a moment of fury/surprise uses his new and improved pulse-blasting gloves to shatter the windows of his shop.

-   In the extended edition of _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_, Aragorn gets into a Palantír staring match with Sauron, who shows him a taunting vision of a dying/dead Arwen. The Evenstar pendant she gifted him with falls to the floor and shatters very prettily and dramatically into glittering bits, though he's later seen wearing it, so it was apparently a hallucination. The shot of the pendant shattering is shown before this scene, divorced from context, throughout the trilogy; it symbolises Arwen's dependence on Aragorn's victory to survive.
-   _Manhunter_ and _Red Dragon_ has the killer at large; Francis Dollarhyde who leaves slivers of glass embedded in his victim's eyes. In the climax of the former, he's shown shattering a mirror as he prepares to kill his blind girlfriend.
-   _Mirrors_: As might be expected in a movie about (evil) mirrors. Both the normal version (when Anna lets herself get re-possessed in the mirror chamber) and a version with a Moment of Silence (when all the spirits are freed) occur.

-   In Andrei Tarkovsky's _The Sacrifice_, the first sign that World War III is about to break out is when low-flying jet fighters shake the house, causing a pitcher full of milk to fall and shatter.

Her magic mirror though is composed of highly polished magic metal rather than glass.
-   The "Line Must Be Drawn Here" scene from _Star Trek: First Contact_, in which Captain Picard loses his temper, shouts two Big Nos, and smashes the glass case holding his models of previous _Enterprises_. The camera even holds for an extra moment on the model of the ship from the television series sliding off of the shelf before it hits the ground.
-   _Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker_ : Kylo Ren forcefully smashes Emperor Palpatine’s Sith Wayfinder, to try and force his enemy, Rey, to join him by angering her and giving her no other way to get to Exegol
-   Lampshaded and deconstructed in the Bollywood movie _Taal_: upon hearing his nephew is going to marry the daughter of a musician (basically a commoner), Manev's uncle smashes a glass on the floor. Manev then proceeds to smash _seven_ glasses on the floor, and then says, "If smashing a glass makes your argument more valid, then I have smashed seven glasses on the floor, so my argument is seven times more valid."
-   In the film version of _Twilight_, Rosalie shatters a glass bowl of salad in rage when she learns that Bella has already eaten and her family's efforts to cook for her were in vain.
    -   The climax, taking place in a mirror lined ballet studio also has this in spades.
-   Done with a dropped coffee cup at the end of _The Usual Suspects_.
-   The Movie of _Watchmen_ does this: when Laurie figures out The Comedian was her father, she freaks out and punches a pillar of Jon's Martian glass palace, which leads to _the whole structure_ shattering around them. It's pretty awesome.
-   _The World Is Not Enough_ shows Renard punching clean through a glass table in frustration, showing his utter inability to feel pain.

-   Averted in _Spaceship Medic_ by Robert A. Heinlein. The protagonist does a Dramatic Drop of his coffee on receiving some bad news, but because he's on a spaceship in the future it's made of unbreakable glass.

    Live-Action TV 

-   A particularly cliched Portent of Doom used in Filipino soaps: when a character is about to die in a scene, there is a quick cut to his (or a close friend's) house showing a glass falling and breaking<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and all his friends or relatives present reacting in shock to it. It then either cuts back to show whether he died, or was just badly hurt, or, an authority calls up to bring the bad news.
-   _Arrow_: Laurel drops a plate when she learns that her sister Sara is alive.

-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: In "Like Angels Put in Hell by God", Louis de Pointe du Lac confronts his boyfriend Lestat de Lioncourt about the song the latter wrote as a Valentine's Day present because he's so offended that Lestat's mistress Antoinette Brown sings it. Louis drops the record in front of them to demonstrate his hatred of it and the disc shatters. (Please note that this is not an example of Vinyl Shatters because the scene takes place over a decade before large-diameter vinyl records were mass-produced, so the phonograph record is made of shellac.)
-   _Iron Fist (2017)_: When Madame Gao turns up in his apartment unexpectedly, Harold Meachum drops a glass in shock, and she orders him to get down on his hands and knees on the broken glass as a sign of submission.

    -   In "Heart", Madison drops the coffee pot when she finds Nate's body.
    -   In the Season 7 finale, Meg smashes the Impala into the Sucrocorp sign to cause the maximum amount of distraction. Or maybe she just did it to piss off Dean?
-   In the season four finale of _The West Wing_, when President Bartlet finds out Zoe, his youngest daughter has been kidnapped, he drops his drink glass.

    Music Videos 

-   A common trope in 1980s music videos. Russell Mulcahey (the director of _Highlander_) started his career by directing many, many music videos in the 1980s. He practically invented the "glass object shattering in slow motion" motif used so often in the TEN videos he did for Duran Duran.
-   Watch the music video for "I Don't Love You" by My Chemical Romance. Right after the Subdued Section, _everything_ shatters.
-   Subverted in the R.E.M. video "Losing My Religion"; in the beginning of the video, a pitcher of milk falls and spills on the floor but doesn't shatter.
-   X Japan's videos for, among others, "Week End" and "Jade" feature this trope.

    **Minkowski:** Leave. _Now._
    

    Theater 

-   In _Next to Normal_, Dan dramatically smashes a music box.

    Video Games 

-   _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_: "What is a man?! \*tosses wine glass\* A miserable little pile of secrets! But enough talk! Have at you!"
    -   Dracula does this quite a lot over the various _Castlevania_ games.
    -   He also does it in _I Wanna Be the Guy_. Just like everything else in the game, the wine glass can kill you.
-   One of the scenarios in the Interactive Fiction game _Constraints_ places you in the unlikely role of a vase on a shelf, waiting for the right dramatic moment to plummet to the floor.
-   In the first _Dead Space_, you'll run into a corridor with glass panes on the walls. Every single one shatters in some shockwave, announcing the arrival of something worse... Nope, just kidding; it's a jump scare.
-   In _Deltarune_ Queen has a glass handy for _exactly this purpose_ just to make a dramatic point. And then, still a little sauced on battery acid, immediately smashes down another one that _explodes_; apparently she also had an Extra-Dangerous Glass for whatever reason.
-   The Prototype boss on the penultimate floor of the Administrator's Tower in _Fairune 2_ uses this when breaking out of it's containment pod.
-   _Hakaiou: King of Crusher_ have this happening in the opening scene. After the alien bug bit you, you then drop your cup of milk. Including a close-up of the cup landing on the floor and shattering in slow-mo. He also does it in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_.
-   Near the end of _Mass Effect 3_, Shepherd can shatter Kai Leng's sword with an interrupt.
-   In _Persona 3_, characters would summon their Persona by placing the gun-shaped Evoker to their head and pulling the trigger —and a flurry of blue "shards" would fly out the other side of their head, with the sound of glass breaking, to symbolize their own _minds_ shattering in order for their inner selves to manifest. The same effect is used when the Protagonist (the only one who can switch Personas at will) "shattered" one Persona for another during battle, to represent his original personality breaking to make way for a new one.
    -   _Persona 4_ used basically the same motif and sound effect, except that instead of their minds breaking via gunshot, the Tarot cards symbolizing the character's Persona would fly apart when struck by his or her weapon of choice. The Protagonist's "mind shattering like glass while changing Personas" part was removed, however, and only the sound effect remained. This is because, unlike the third game, the characters of 4 have earned the ability to summon their Personas at will, instead of needing to trigger them in moments of life or death.
-   In some of the bad endings of _Streets of Rage_ 3, Mr X is shown with his back to the camera holding a glass of wine in his hand, which he then shatters by tightening his fist around it.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   Diego Armando in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_, Case 3-4, grows so full of Tranquil Fury at recent events as to shatter a _ceramic mug full of coffee_ in his _bare hand_.
    -   Barok van Zieks from _The Great Ace Attorney_ has a seemingly endless amount of wine chalices that he either crush with his hand or toss into the torch behind him for emphasis every time he makes an argument in court or just simply to intimidate the defense. Most likely a reference to _Castlevania_'s Dracula to go along with van Zieks' vampire motif.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_: In Volume 6, Salem learns that her Arch-Enemy has returned to help the heroes working against her. After spending two volumes as the picture of tranquil menace, her response to the news is a scream of rage and frustration that telekinetically shatters every single window in the room. Her subordinates have to leave swiftly as the glass cracks to avoid being shredded to death in the explosion.

    Web Comics 

    Web Original 

-   The _SF Debris_ review of "Signs and Portents"

-   In the _Clone High_ episode "Sleep Of Faith: La Rue D'Awakening", a pencil _somehow_ shatters into a million pieces when Abe drops it from exhaustion after spending countless nights trying to help Cleopatra study for the PXJT.
-   In the second episode of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, Nightmare Moon does this to the depowered Elements of Harmony. There is even a shot of Twilight looking with shock as the shards fall to the ground.
-   Near the end of the _Steven Universe_ episode "Keystone Motel", Steven grabs his plate at the diner when Ruby smashes the table. He then lets go and lets it shatter on the ground. This is so radically out of character for him that Greg, Ruby, and Sapphire all take it as a sign something has gone seriously wrong.
