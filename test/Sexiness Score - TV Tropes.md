**Sue:** You don't actually rate men on a scale of 1 to 10, do you?  
**Beatriz:** Of course I do!  
**Sue:** Don't you think that's a tad juvenile? Not to mention sexist?  
**Beatriz:** You're only saying that because you're married to a 4.  
**Sue:** Excuse me?

A character judges someone's overall sexiness by giving them an objective rank or score. This can range from the character's physical appearance to other things like sexual prowess, social status, financial stability, emotional availability, etc. The most common ranking system is On a Scale from One to Ten, but sometimes an Idiosyncratic Ratings Scale is used. Someone exceptionally high or low might cause a Readings Are Off the Scale or Broke the Rating Scale situation.

This usually comes with the connotation that the character doing the ranking is shallow, juvenile, or even sexist. Other characters will often call them out on it, especially if they know or _are_ the person being ranked. But sometimes the characters may actually simply join in and start a "ranking" discussion. These discussions frequently occur between people of the same sex, usually to establish that All Men Are Perverts or All Women Are Lustful.

This can also be done simply to inform the audience about the attractiveness levels of said character, especially in media with no visuals.

A common occurrence is also for a character to be offended or proud about the score, depending on if they scored high or low. An Alpha Bitch or a Proud Beauty may be indignant to get anything less than a 10 while the Ridiculously Average Guy may be happy with a 6. This can sometimes lead to hijinks where a character tries to debate or prove their score is higher than what they were given.

A character may also get offended if their Love Interest gets ranked by someone else, reacting with jealousy or anger. An Insecure Love Interest might even give themselves a low score in self-deprecation. A third party may criticize a couple they perceive as a Ugly Guy, Hot Wife or Unequal Pairing by pointing out the difference in "numbers" between them.

See Eating the Eye Candy for when a character is silently checking out another. See Male Gaze and Female Gaze when the _camera_ is the one doing the checking out. See Head-Turning Beauty and Lust Object for characters who usually get "scored". See Beauty Contest for when such scorings are codified in an actual competition. See Hold Up Your Score for when someone or their accomplishment is visibly judged on a numeric scale. Also related are Grade System Snark, Socially Scored Society and Sliding Scale of Beauty.

    **Draco:** You know who I think is the ugliest girl in school? That Hermine Granger! You know what I would give her On a Scale from One to Ten? 1 would be the ugliest and 10 pretty... I would give her an 8... 8.5... or a 9... Not, not over a 9.8 cause there is always room for improvement. Not everyone is perfect, like me. That's why I'm holding out for a 10. Because I'm worth it!

Heidi is in the "TOP TEN, FOR SURE." Qi, on the other hand, "GETS ONE OUT OF TEN FOR NOT BEING INTERESTED IN ME," sight unseen.

This leads to some unfortunate confusion between Minmax and the locals:
    
    **Minmax**: Let's ask her! She's only 13, but still cute! I'd totally do her.  
    **Forgath**: Uh Minmax, I don't think the locals know you're talking about charisma...  
    **Minmax**: _\[shouts\]_ Hey! 13 and hot! I love it!  
    _\[everyone stares at Minmax in shock and disgust\]_  
    **Forgath**: ...Yeah, we're gonna get lynched.

    -   In "The Funeral", Maury irrationally hates Matthew's little sister Brittany, and mocks her appearance with a low "score" despite her being a little kid.

    **Matthew**: Maury, she's seven.  
    **Maury** Yeah, she might be seven, but let's be honest, Matt. She's a fucking three.
    
-   _Family Guy_:

After he almost marries her (long story), and Wander intervenes dressed in drag (longer story), Hater is convinced he's actually desirable, and why should he settle for a 6 and a 4 when he can have all the 10s he wants. Sylvia and Wander are off the hook and leaving, when Sylvia notes, "I'd better have been the 6, or I'm going back there and punching him!"
-   _What's with Andy?_: In "Busting", Andy's crush Lori tells him that she and her friends have decided that he is an eight on a scale of one to ten. Andy, due to being distracted by a Potty Emergency, mishears "You're an eight" as "Urinate".
