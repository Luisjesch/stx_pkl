Believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role.

**Wade:** Must have been some party, though, right?  
**Sam:** You wake up in a strange bed with a strange man, and your first guess is "party"?  
**Wade:** Strange people in a strange bed sounds like a party to me, man!

Someone (usually a guy) wakes up in bed, and the audience assumes he's alone. But then either he moves or the camera pans, and we see there's someone else. Usually, it's implied that hanky-panky has just taken place, and if it hasn't, the guy will either anxiously ask for confirmation, or just assume the worst with hilarious consequences. Sometimes, it's used as a Secret Relationship reveal, occasionally by subverting the trope — the audience is shocked to see the characters together, and then further shocked when the characters themselves _aren't shocked_. A common variation is to have the guy wake up to find another guy in his bed. In that case, either he's _really_ anxious to ask for confirmation about why he's there, or he's too afraid to ask. Harem Genre loves this to death.

If the character is usually The Casanova and wouldn't be too put out to find any old stranger in his bed, the partner may be an Abhorrent Admirer.

With a little bit of tweaking this can also be a Horror Trope - say if the hapless victim rolls over in bed to find the monstrous villain in bed with them. Of course, the sexual connotations to this aren't an accident. Another variant is The Murder After, when the surprise bedmate is a freshly murdered corpse—or even part of one, particularly the head.

-   Happens in _DNA²_, when Junta finds Karin sleeping in a futon located near his bed, only in her undies plus one of his shirts.

Cue to Sousuke freaking out so loud Kaname wakes up too and comes to see what's going on.

-   _Gintama_ does it twice to Gintoki. First with (only) Sa-chan who fell through his roof and landed next to him, but convinces him that they are together now and must go on a ninja mission.

-   Kougyoku from _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_ wakes after a banquet to find herself in bed with a stark naked Sinbad, and assumes the worst. As a princess, the issue is complicated by the fact that she believes her honour can only be regained through either both their deaths, or marriage, and Sinbad's reputation as a drunken womaniser means that no one believes him when he denies taking advantage of her. The situation is eventually resolved peacefully. Interestingly, in the manga Sinbad's hand is resting on Kougyoku's thigh when she wakes up, but the anime removed this detail, apparently finding it _too_ suggestive.
-   Used for opposite the usual reason in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_.

-   _Monster Musume_. Kimihito wakes up to find that Cute Monster Girl Miia is in bed with him, her being Snake People and thus needing a warm body to warm herself up. Unfortunately that also means her instinctive reaction to someone trying to wriggle free is to grasp him tightly in her coils. At first this only means Marshmallow Hell, but Kimihito quickly faces the prospect of being crushed to death.

Meanwhile Asuka kept staring at the door, wondering why Shinji was lying next to her, why he had kissed her and since when he was so smooth.
    
    Shinji woke up, opened his eyes, and was then absolutely certain that he hadn’t done either. He could not possibly have woken up, for several reasons. Number one, that he was still alive. Number two, this was exactly like other dreams he’d had in the past, so it must be one. Number three, it had to be a dream, since the likelihood of him actually being awake, alive, and having Asuka not just in his arms but also smiling in her sleep must have been astronomical. That he was in fact holding her tightly against him and looking at the impossibly beautiful smile on her sleeping face from a few inches away, pre-dawn light giving her a surreal pale glow, was so unlikely that he must still be asleep. Q.E.D.

-   In the German movie _Lammbock_ the male lead jumps in bed with the wrong girl only to realize his mistake the next morning.
-   The male/male trope was used seriously in the film _Mongol_, when after the drunken party, they show the sleeping Jamukha, and Temujin rises from the covers of the blanket on the other side, and joins his wife a short distance away. The reason they were sleeping under one blanket was to symbolize their blood brother status to their troops, as real brothers would share a blanket for warmth (especially since Mongolia's freezing). Still a bit odd to seen used in that context in a modern movie though.
-   _Murder by Death_. After Milo Perrier gets into bed, he looks across and sees his male chauffeur Marcel Cassette in bed with him.
    
    **Milo**: What are you doing in my bed?

That night he sneaks into her bedroom, pulls back the curtain, takes hold of the figure under the sheets...who sits up to reveal herself as Blofeld's middle-aged henchwoman Irma Bunt.
    
    **Bond:** (Gasp!) Fancy meeting you here, Fräulein! _(A goon lunges out of the darkness and clubs Bond unconscious.)_
    
-   _Prince of Darkness_ (1987) uses this to grisly effect. Though not grisly enough to keep the internet from picking it up, replacing the bedmate with anything from Lex Luthor to Arnold Schwarzenegger, King Leonidas, the Burger King and even a copy of L Ron Hubbard's Dianetics.
-   In _Shanghai Noon_ Chon Wang wakes up in a tent with a splitting headache after partying with the Indians all night until he passed out.

-   _The Rebound_ subverts this- when Aram Finklestein wakes up a hungover Sandy, she immediately assumes they slept together. They hadn't yet.
-   There's a bit in a later John Wayne movie, _Rio Lobo_, where he wakes, after sleeping under the stars, to find the attractive young woman of their party snuggled up to him, and his arm draped over her. His startled, "Hey! What's she doing here?" is quite funny. So is his irritation that she cuddled up to him because she thought it'd be safer than with either of the young studs in their group. Occasionally during the rest of the film he sarcastically describes himself as "comfortable," because that's how she had put it.
-   A variant in _Sixteen Candles_ had characters waking up in a convertible rather than a bed, but asking the usual questions about what happened.
-   _Snow Dogs_: After an intimate night in the woods with Barb, we cut to Ted in bed the next morning. He asks "So, how did you sleep?" and we pan over to see him sharing the bed with Nana the dog.
-   A different use of this trope is seen in _Star Trek (2009)_. A young Jim Kirk is in bed with a woman whom we naturally assume to be Uhura. The lights come on, and it turns out to be Uhura's roommate, a Green-Skinned Space Babe.
-   In the John Carpenter film _They Live!_, the last shot in the movie has a rare awake (and _during_ sex) version. The twist? The bedmate is an alien and the woman didn't know until _right now_ due to mind control. This scene is both gross and hilarious. It's the slick voice coming out of the lifeless prop head that makes it funny. Every time.
-   _Ticket to Paradise_: Bitter exes David and Georgia freak out upon waking up after a drunk night out and finding themselves sharing a bed. Georgia is wearing David's clothes and David isn't wearing pants. They have to remember exactly what happened to assure themselves that they didn't do anything.

-   Played for horror in _Videodrome_. When Max wakes up in his bed late in the film after an extended Videodrome hallucination, he finds someone laying next to him. When he removes the sheets it turns out to be the corpse of an associate of his, tied up and tortured to death. He calls up a friend to come over and look, but it turns out he was again hallucinating and his bed is empty.

-   In _Listen to me, girls. I am your father!_, Sora has a habit of moving close to Yuuta even when she's fallen asleep, so it's a case of both of them getting a surprise when they wake up. The way she moves while clinging to Yuuta makes you wonder what kind of dreams the girl is having...

In the subsequent volumes, Flum invites Milkit to sleep in her bed with her.
-   The fourth volume of _The Unexplored Summon://Blood-Sign_ begins with Kyousuke waking up in an unfamiliar hotel room, with the White Queen embracing him. He tries to run away, but fails due to her Super-Strength. He then grabs anything in reach and tries to kill her, which just causes her to knock him out with a flick to the forehead. She then comments that it's the 45th time this exact event has happened that morning, and complains that the breakfast she cooked will get cold.

-   Toyed with in the Robert Ludlum novel _The Arctic Event_. Randi Russell wakes up naked in a sleeping bag with not only Jon Smith, but also Valentina Metrace. Despite her understandable surprise, there was no hanky-panky. They were trying to keep her from dying of hypothermia after she was out in Arctic blizzard conditions without protective clothing. Doesn't stop someone making a joke, though.
    
    **Val**: It's alright, darling. Nobody waits until marriage anymore.
    
-   On the subject of _The Cat Who Walks Through Walls,_ Richard goes to sleep with Gretchen on one side and Xia on the other, then wakes up to find himself in bed with Pixel (licking him enthusiastically), Minerva (whom he kisses enthusiastically), and Galahad (whom, after a pause, he also kisses enthusiastically).
-   Delayed in _Ciaphas Cain_: Cain needs to talk with the schola's bursar, a self-important Obstructive Bureaucrat... or so he seems. Cain discovers a lot of it is an act, since it's expected of the position (much like Cain pretends to be a **HERO OF THE IMPERIUM!**), and also figures out there's someone else who was over for the night waiting for him to go away so she can leave undetected. He hides to see who it is, expecting a servant... and is flabbergasted to see it's a Sisters of Battle Veteran Instructor.
-   The first book of _The Helmsman Saga_ has the protagonist wake up in the morning and find his lover next to him. As a variation, she woke him up when climbing in and they had quite a night together - it's just that, upon waking up, he believes it was All Just a Dream until he actually finds her there.
-   Invoked oddly in William Gibson's _Mona Lisa Overdrive._ One of the protagonists has memory issues (due to complicated backstory), and when he wakes up in bed with a girl, his lack of memory is not due to alcohol or drugs. (She's just there to get warm.)
-   In the Novel Within a Novel _Peter Flowerbuck_, this occurs between a man and a young prostitute he had intended to set free.
-   _To Sail Beyond the Sunset_ opens with protagonist Maureen waking up in bed with a cat she knows (Pixel, familiar to readers of _The Cat Who Walks Through Walls_) and a dead man she doesn't know.

    **Sheldon:** _\[clutching geology textbook\]_ It's not my friend. Nothing happened!

    -   _Angel_:
        
        -   In "Not Fade Away", Angel warns the bad guys might retaliate against their people. Cut to his vampire Sexy Secretary Harmony sprawled out with Blood from the Mouth. This trope then shows Harmony is sharing a friendly cup of blood with The Dragon and spilling Angel's secrets.
        -   Also the trope was summed up by Lorne in "Epiphany":
        
        **Lorne:** What's hard to understand? You think you're the first guy to ever roll over, saw what was lying next to him and went "GYYYAAAH!"?

-   Happens in the Series 2 finale of _Drop the Dead Donkey_ between Alex and Dave, much to both their horror, after a drunken Christmas party.
-   And either ripped off or Homaged at the end of second episode of _ER_, which finds Dr. Susan Lewis getting into bed with her boyfriend, the psychiatrist she'd been bickering with earlier in the day over a patient's care. There's a similar scene a year later in the second season premiere, after Dr. Benton and his mother's physical therapist spend the entire day acting very uncomfortable around each other, barely exchanging two words. The viewer is led to believe that this awkwardness comes from them deciding not to act on the sexual tension that had developed between them, until the end of the episode finds them in bed together, revealing that they _have_ in fact been carrying on an affair for several months and that the awkwardness was so that they could conceal it from their coworkers. Another episode manages to conceal _both_ partners, showing only a bedroom in disarray, until the camera pans across a crutch, thus revealing that one of the bed occupants is Dr. Kerry Weaver, accompanied by the doctor she'd been flirting with for the past several episodes.

A third hand comes into shot, rubbing his eyes. He looks down at the two hands on his chest, then — with mounting horror — over at Janice in bed next to him..
    -   Additionally, Ross and Joey wake up together on a sofa after having a nap. It's played off in the manner of the two drunken guys version.
-   _Ghost Squad_: The episode "The Necessary Means" opens with the protagonist, a undercover policewoman working for the titular squad, throwing aside her quilt at the sound of an alarm. Then the other half of the quilt is thrown aside to reveal she's in bed with another female officer. Their subsequent dialogue makes it quite clear something is going on between them. Furthermore the moment her partner steps out of the room the protagonist searches her personal items for evidence of corruption, making it clear she's sleeping with the target of her investigation.
-   In _Gossip Girl_ Blair has a whole conversation with Serena while still in bed, mostly consisting of criticism and outright requests to leave.

When they go into the bedroom, C.C. angrily demands to know why they are in bed together, and after she and Niles leave, Fran and Maxwell explain what happened, which leads to a Did They or Didn't They? situation.
-   The famous finale of _Newhart,_ where Bob Newhart's character, Dick Loudon, seems to die, then wakes up next to Suzanne Pleshette (reprising her role as Emily Hartley), complaining about the weird dream he had just had- implying that the whole show had been All Just a Dream of his character, Bob Hartley, from his previous sitcom. Played With in that the reveal is only a reveal to the _audience_ - Bob isn't surprised to wake up sharing a bed with his wife, but the studio audience goes _wild_ when she sits up.
-   This happens to Felix on _The Odd Couple (1970)_. It's a long scene with no dialogue that begins with Felix coming home late from work, gargling, putting his PJ's and a sleep mask on and climbing into bed.

-   _Scandal_: At the end of "Hunting Season," David and Abby. It is revealed after the two...uh, finish.
-   Exaggerated in _The Secret Life of the American Teenager_'s season 4 episode "And Circumstance". The last ten minutes is completely saturated with it.

-   In the 7th season of _Seinfeld_, Elaine is in bed with Jerry, and during their post-coital conversation, George comes out from under the covers, as does Kramer. Fortunately for her, it turned out to be a dream.

This was just one way of showing Richard's final Face–Heel Turn to the Dark Side, and by the finale he's been fully seduced by Sex, Drugs and Musical Theater.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: "Tapestry" features this. Picard wakes up with Q next to him, who goes on to talk about how "now, everything has changed". Actually Picard slept with a fellow female cadet, but apparently she's Not Staying for Breakfast and Q teleported into the bed just to mess with Picard. Given the dialog, it's pretty clear this was written to be funnier out of context.
    
    **Q:** Morning, darling.
    
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_:
    -   The scene is given a bit of a Continuity Nod when Q does it to Janeway (except this time the indecent proposal is more serious). Janeway is not amused. Made even funnier because Q is wearing a silly nightcap.
    -   In the episode "Non Sequitur", Harry Kim wakes up with his girlfriend on Earth. The problem is he should be stranded with his shipmates on the other side of the galaxy. He spends the rest of the episode trying to work out what happened and get back to Voyager, much to the puzzlement of the audience.

    **Wayne:** Colin?! _(runs away)_
    
    **Ryan:** _(popping up next to Colin)_ What's his problem?
    
    **Colin:** I don't know.
    
-   In _Warehouse 13_, Pete and Myka wake up in bed together at the start of an episode. Naked. In Artie's bed at the Warehouse. They then have to figure out just what series of events led them to such a ridiculous outcome. As it turns out, an artifact made them drunk and they bronzed Jinx. Knowing they would pass out before being able to help him, they were just rational enough to do the one thing they _knew_ they'd never do normally, which would drive them to figure it out and free Jinx.
