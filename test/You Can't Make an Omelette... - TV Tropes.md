_"Making the mother of all omelettes here, Jack! Can't fret over every egg!"_

... without breaking a few eggs.

Stock Phrase that means that in order to achieve something, it is inevitable and necessary that something should be destroyed or sacrificed. It's used as a response whenever someone's confronted about major damage or the like, and is frequently used by those on the cynical end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism. Villains in particular, especially Well Intentioned Extremists who believe that Utopia Justifies the Means, are fond of using the line, as it perfectly underscores their disregard for the lives they are destroying or ruining for the sake of their Evil Plan.

The phrase originated with Count Pahlen, one of the conspirators in the coup of 1801 that resulted in the death of Tsar Paul I. (see below in Real Life). It was continued by Egyptian historian Charles P. Issawi: "but it is amazing how many eggs one can break without making a decent omelette".

The people who use this phrase usually don't think _they_ will be the proverbial eggs.

Often leads to Metaphorgotten or \[Popular Saying\], But....

Compare I Did What I Had to Do or Utopia Justifies the Means. Antonym of Never Hurt an Innocent.

    **Ghost Kid Loki**: (whispering) No. It doesn't.
    

    Film 

-   In _Batman (1989)_, it’s revealed that The Joker "improved" the looks of his girlfriend Alicia. After he tells Vicki Vale that Alicia threw herself out a window, this line is used, implying that Joker may have killed her himself to free himself for Vicki:

-   In _Batman: Assault on Arkham_, Batman confronts Amanda Waller for her reckless use of Task Force X to have the Riddler killed, which resulted in a massive breakout and riot among the inmates. Waller responds with the omelette saying, only for Batman to retort that Waller's "such a messy cook" that everything went horribly wrong.
-   In _Clue_, regarding the possibility that by splitting up into pairs to search for the murderer, one of the characters could wind up dead after a couple of house staff members have already been killed:

    Literature 

-   _Falling Free_: Van Atta uses this to justify killing some of the quaddies, to Dr. Yei's irritation:
    
    **Van Atta:** The quaddies are—ah, have made themselves expendable by turning criminal. It's no different than shooting a thief fleeing from any other kind of robbery or break-in. Besides, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.  
    **Yei:** I've been wondering when you were going to say that. I should have put a side bet on it—run a pool—
    
-   In the _StarCraft_ novelization _Liberty's Crusade_, Arcturus Mengsk quotes this as part of his justification for setting off psi-emitters on Tarsonis's surface, dooming the entire planet to the zerg. Nobody seems to believe him. (Which is why he promptly covers the whole thing up, claiming it was a massive coincidence.)
-   Taken literally in _The Atrocity Archive_ when Bob's flatmates Pinky and Brain try to prove that you _can_ in fact do it, provided you inject the egg with a ferrous solution then put it in a rotating magnetic field. It doesn't quite work, but it proves a Chekhov's Lecture, eventually leading Bob to the solution to how to disarm a tactical nuke.
-   Variant in _Ciaphas Cain_. An insane rogue Inquisitor quotes "The path of righteousness is a stony one" to justify abandoning hundreds of people to die, despite the fact that they had altruistically helped him. Cain mentally notes that he's forgotten the rest of the quote. Amberly explains the full quote to be "The path of righteousness is a stony one, made smoother by concern for others."
-   Said word by word by Big Bad of _Safehold_, Zhaspar Clyntahn, more than once. Some characters speculate that he's merely saying this to justify his megalomania and increasing hold over the Church, but others fear that he started to veer in the territory of Believing Their Own Lies.
-   In _Goldfinger_, the mobster Billy Ring says this to Bond, when they see that the entire population around Fort Knox have been killed dead in their tracks by the poison Goldfinger introduced into the water supply. Or so they think.
-   In Sinclair Lewis' _It Can't Happen Here_, the protagonist reacts with anger when his own son uses the phrase to defend the fascist reigme that came to power in America.
    
    "If I ever hear that 'can't make an omelet' phrase again, I'll start doing a little murder myself!

By God, sir, men's souls and blood are not eggshells for tyrants to break!"

-   According to Greg Sanders of _CSI_, commenting on a brain found unexpectedly intact a significant distance from its owner's smashed head, "it's hard to crack an egg without breaking the yolk".

When Thelma (who has become human and is distressed by her newfound inability to communicate with the ship) pleads with her to reconsider, Davenport brushes her off with the omelet/eggs metaphor. Thelma's dejected response? "That's what I get for talking to an egghead."

-   _Vision of Escaflowne Abridged_:

        **Dornkirk:** _\[to heroes\]_ Look, you can't bake a cake without breaking a few eggs.  
        **Hitomi:** Yes, you can. My grandma used to make me vegan cake all the time.  
        **Dornkirk:** You can? Hold on a second.  
        **Dornkirk:** _\[to Falken\]_ Falken! Did you know you can bake a cake without breaking any eggs?  
        **Folken:** Yes, my lord, yes you can.

    Western Animation 

-   _Darkwing Duck_: In "Something Fishy", Neptunia namedrops the trope when Launchpad tries to point out that she's hurting a lot of people by flooding St. Canard.

-   _Men in Black: The Series_:
    
    -   In the Grand Finale, "The Endgame Syndrome":
    
    **Alpha:** _\[observing the destroyed MIB headquarters\]_ Ah, the old clubhouse. Such a shame, so many fond memories... But as we say on Earth, one can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.  
    **Vangus:** Omelette... Eggs... Good one!
    
    -   This becomes an Ironic Echo later when Vangus decides to just blow Earth to bits, as it's proving too much hassle to conquer. Alpha protests that this wouldn't leave him anything to rule, but Vangus just quotes the trope back at him.
-   A lighter example is done in _Static Shock_ where Richie uses this line to convince Virgil into breaking into the school to use the microscopes inside to study a part of the Mega Microbe monster terrorizing the week.
-   _Wakfu_: When showing the _Zinit_ to Adamaï, Qilby quips that one can't make an omelette without breaking some Dofus, foreshadowing the revelation that Qilby needs and wholly intends to drain the World of Twelve of its wakfu to get the _Zinit_ back in the air for the "good" of returning his people to their cosmic cruise.

    Real Life 

-   The phrase originates with Peter Ludwig Count Pahlen (1746-1826), military governor of St. Petersburg and one of the officers conspiring to depose Tsar Paul I on 23 March 1801. Pahlen, speaking in French, said: "Quand on veut faire des omelettes, il faut casser des oeufs" (When you want to make omelettes, you have to break eggs), and the coup did result in the "accidental" death of the Tsar. In a speech to a delegation from Strasbourg on 21 December 1890, Otto von Bismarck gave it the form: "On ne peut pas faire une omelette sans casser des oeufs" (You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs).
-   The phrase was infamously employed by _New York Times_ Moscow bureau chief (and Stalin apologist) Walter Duranty in a 1933 article purporting to debunk the famine in Ukraine.
-   Nikolai Yezhov, head of the Soviet secret police (NKVD) pre-World War II, is credited with using the similar phrase, "When you chop wood, chips fly." Fitting as his reign over the NKVD was during the peak of the Purges, and he himself was executed as part of them.
    -   That phrase is sometimes continued with the comment "This can be unpleasant if you're one of the chips."
    -   Yezhov's wording is similar to a German saying, "Wo gehobelt wird, fallen Späne" (Where there is planing, shavings will fall).
-   Economists use the phrase "creative destruction" to describe this idea. Creative destruction is when a new invention or business succeeds, it means other skills and capital goods become obsolete. This means that people have tools that they can't profitably use or have trained for jobs that are no longer done.
-   This is the reason why Not in My Backyard! exists. You cannot have a (insert useful or necessary thing here) without inconveniencing _someone_.
-   Jack Kroll in _Newsweek_ once reviewed a production of a certain William Shakespeare play, pointing out "You can't make a _Hamlet_ without breaking eggs."
-   A popular, but likely apocryphal, story claims that someone once used this line in defense of the Soviet Union, and George Orwell replied, "Where's the omelette?"
-   During storms and floods, the Chinese Communist Party would often release floodwater from dams to drown out small towns (and some cities) to protect Beijing, their capital, from being flooded.
