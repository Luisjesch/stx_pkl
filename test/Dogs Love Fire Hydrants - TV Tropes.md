_"Be careful, for the dogs have had their way with this water pump!"_

In fiction, it seems to be assumed that dogs have a kind of fascination or obsession with fire hydrants, loving them almost as much as they love bones and chasing cats. Though not always stated outright the fact that they enjoy marking their territory on them is rarely denied, although sometimes it's treated more like normal urinating than territory marking and you have dogs waiting in line to pee on them for instance. Some works take the obsession to the next level, however, without mentioning this tendency.

This trope is to a certain extent very United States-centric. In many nations, fire hydrants are more inconspicuous (often being fully underground) and less likely to be seen by a dog as something to mark. For example, this<small>◊</small> is your average fire hydrant in the United Kingdom. In those countries, street lampposts and other utilities of that nature tend to have the reputation for attracting dogs, not hydrants.

Can overlap with Urine Trouble. Subtrope of Canine Confusion, since dogs in real life don't particularly love fire hydrants, and even when it comes to marking territory they don't prefer them over other objects.
