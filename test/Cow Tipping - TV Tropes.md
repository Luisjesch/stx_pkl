What a load of bull.

_"That's called cow tipping! Haw, Haw, Haw!"_

People (usually those afflicted by Small Town Boredom) will sneak out at night and try to tip a cow over, because as you all know cows sleep upright and are too dumb or weak to do anything about people pushing them over. When they finally fall they will just lie on the ground helpless until someone gets them back on their feet. Right?

Actually no. In Real Life this is downright impossible, because:

1.  Cows don't sleep standing up (though horses do, sometimes).
2.  Cows are very heavy and you need a lot of strength and force to be able to get the animal into motion. It will likely reorient its footing while you are wasting energy pushing against it.
3.  Unless injured or sick, cows are perfectly able to lie down and regain their footing whenever they want.
4.  You will probably make the cow angry, and it will try to defend itself, possibly killing anyone who attempts this.

A subtrope of Artistic License – Biology and a popular Urban Legend (you see, there's a reason why it is called an urban legend and not a _rural_ one). See also Constantly Lactating Cow for another trope about cattle being portrayed inaccurately.
