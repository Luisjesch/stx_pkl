_"I'll let you have thirty more seconds. But you're enjoying this too much. When I think you've had enough fun to realize I don't have a weapon, I'm going to step back, and you'll take your hands away. If you don't, I'll break your neck."_

When a character uses a pat-down as an opportunity to grope another character. Often times done by a Dirty Cop or a Mook who has a character, usually female, in a position where it seems unlikely they would fight back, usually because they're tied up or in the case of a Dirty Cop doing the pat-down, the character is likely to get in more trouble for assaulting a cop.

In Real Life, various law enforcement officials and workers need to frisk people, including police, prison guards, airport guards, and security guards, to search for hidden weapons and illegal items. In some jurisdictions, police try to get a female officer to search a female suspect, but this is not always feasible.

-   _Los Hombres de Paco_: Pepa does this to Silvia after the two have a misunderstanding; while Silvia loads up a car, Pepa "arrests" her on the grounds of neglecting and ignoring her, and submits her to a frisk, which includes caressing Silvia's upper arms, rubbing and massaging her thighs, and practically fondling her as well, leading to a brief make-up make-out session.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Patting down wrestlers for concealed weapons is not commonly seen in major post territorial promotions, even though only those dedicated to garbage wrestling like ECW or with a predetermined honor code like Ring of Honor have any excuse for doing away with it.

Attempting the ball-grab knockout, however, will cause Snake to grope them, and get kicked in the face as a result.

    Web Comics 

-   Defied in _Schlock Mercenary_. The extremely well-endowed Dr. Bunnigus (who paid her way through university as an exotic dancer) is threatened with this by the border guard at Haven Hive entry port.
