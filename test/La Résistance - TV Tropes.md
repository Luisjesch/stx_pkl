_♫ "One day to a new beginning  
Raise the flag of freedom high!" ♫_

_"Aux armes, citoyens! Formez vos bataillons! Marchons, marchons! Qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons!"_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

— _**La Marseillaise**_

Wherever The Empire is, you'll always find La Résistance: A Ragtag Bunch of Misfits using The Power of Love and Friendship to fight against a tyrannical rule, often to help put the Government in Exile back into power. Always underdogs, they fight using guerrilla warfare and by raising the rabble of the people by revealing unpleasant truths about The Empire they've been trying to hide, causing the oppressed peoples to shake off the yokes of their tyrant rulers. Sometimes it's as simple as continuing to resist an invading regime after it attacked their homes. Usually led by a Rebel Leader and armed via Vehicular Turnabout. Expect them to be opposed by Les Collaborateurs.

Almost inevitably, The Hero will join La Resistance while the battle is already underway and will grow to become a great champion in the fight against The Empire. After all, Hollywood usually romanticizes resistance fighters, for three reasons. The first is rooted in America's origins as rebels fighting against a tyrannical monarchy during The American Revolution. The second is likewise World War II where the conflict between the Resistance and Nazi Germany fell, as close as it ever has, to clear divisions between right and wrong, and of course, Cool People Rebel Against Authority. In most cases in history and in Real Life, resistance movements are complex and confusing events. A common mistake is to confuse resistance movements with revolutionary movements, when this is not always the case. Some resistance movements _are_ revolutionary, seeking to install a new regime to displace the old. Revolutions, needless to say, are complex, murky and at times brutal affairs. It has led in the past to the new regime forming the new government which can be as bad or worse than the old.

Of course, people rarely like having it pointed out that these groups are terrorists from the perspective of anyone who disagrees with them and Innocent Bystanders who may get caught up in the crossfire of said conflicts. This may be deliberately ironic, perhaps inviting a "we are not so different" moment. Or, the author might simply assume that the audience will always sympathize with rebel protagonists against The Empire, therefore moral justification of the rebellion is unnecessary and the rebels can get away with whatever is expedient. This could be averted if the Evil Empire really is evil and the rebels exercise chivalry and restraint.

Alternatively, La Resistance will be utterly incompetent and little more than an annoyance until the hero gets in there and shows them how it's done. Sometimes their inner dissensions render them nearly unable to get anything done. Expect at least one member of La Resistance to be The Mole, or a homegrown Les Collaborateurs sabotaging their efforts from the inside. La Resistance may even be defeated without the assistance of its enemy: when the only thing uniting it is opposition to The Empire, they may end up clashing thanks to some point of ideology (generally portrayed as stupid) or method (generally portrayed as worthwhile).

Also alternatively, La Resistance may represent the last remnants of the reactionary or counter-revolutionary cronies of the old regime fighting against the Revolutionary Progressive Forces. Once re-installed, the Resistance "heroes" decide to Retcon the revolution and institute purges for the cause of revenge, and remind people why exactly they were toppled in the first place. In some cases, as it happened in some parts of World War II, the Resistance contains factions who want to restore the old regime and factions which want to bring a new regime, and these two factions might struggle during and after the war.

When La Resistance form the main ensemble of the show, or one of them, they'll frequently exhibit a mix of characters similar to The Squad. However, they'll usually have sneakier methods, they tend to be more morally pragmatic and ruthless than most Squads, and in series like _Battlestar Galactica_ members becoming Shell Shocked Veterans.

Sometimes La Resistance can be downright nasty. Usually, though, even at its worst La Resistance will be the Lesser of Two Evils. If not, Grey-and-Gray Morality may be at play. In an interesting twist, if the resistance is every bit as unscrupulous as The Empire, then the hero will end up doing a bit of Conspiracy Redemption or forming a third faction. _Very_ occasionally, La Resistance may even be the Big Bad rebelling against a peaceful government. Occasionally, La Resistance will be shown in a more comedic light, where they don't do much besides sitting around debating theory.

Eventually, La Resistance will either die out, or grow into The Alliance as it gains power, allies, and sympathizers.

For the villainous equivalent, see The Remnant. For the opposite of La Resistance, see Les Collaborateurs. Sometimes La Resistance may not be heroes but _villains_, as happens in an Enemy Civil War.

Compare Vigilante Militia and The Magnificent Seven Samurai.

Not to be confused with the First-Person Shooter series, _Resistance_, the board game _The Resistance_, the Muse album, also named _The Resistance_, or with WWE's French-Canadian Foreign Wrestling Heel Tag Team La Résistance (Tag Team).

    Anime & Manga 

-   Kenji of _20th Century Boys_ form a resistance out of a Ragtag Bunch Of Middle-Aged School Pals. A move eventually followed by his niece, Kanna, which takes the original (and now leveled up) members and throws in the part of the Chinese Mafia.
-   The SSS from _Angel Beats!_ is comprised by a bunch of dead high schoolers who are rebelling against, not an empire, but God himself for the bad crap that had happened in their lives.
-   In _Attack on Titan_:
    -   The entire Survey Corps begins a rebellion against the Government Conspiracy while the rest of the military either opposes them or stays out of the mess. After an Engineered Public Confession, whereby the Monarchy orders Wall Sina sealed after Wall Rose apparently fell and dooming a half of the remaining human population, the other two military branches quickly join them.
    -   The Eldian Restorationist movement, an underground resistance working with the mysterious Owl to overthrow Marley's government and restore the Eldian kingdom. Grisha Yeager was a member of this organization, and attempted to use his own son to infiltrate the government's Tyke Bomb program. It backfired horribly, with young Zeke betraying the group by reporting them to the Secret Police. The entire organization was arrested, tortured, and then transformed into mindless Titans as punishment for their actions. Only Grisha survived, after the Owl revealed himself and rescued him.
    -   The Owl confided to Grisha that his own father had been part of another rebel army when he was a child. They were very ineffective, however, and were quickly captured and burned alive while he hid in a closet. This hints at the possibility that there had been several resistance groups since the end of the Great Titan War, all of which failed to accomplish much of anything. The Owl became convinced that they needed to change their approach, and passed the Attack Titan to Grisha after instructing him to infiltrate the Walls and start a family while searching for the Founding Titan.
-   In _Blue Comet SPT Layzner_, eventually the Gradosian Empire transforms Earth into a Vichy Earth. therefore, Eiji and his friends become this towards Grados and its leaders, Gresco and _specially_ specially Ruu-Kain. This includes Eiji returning to his friends's sides with Layzner after being MIA, David and Simone as a Battle Couple and resistance leaders, Anna as an Action Survivor bordering on Messianic Archetype, Roanne as The Mole, Arthur _trying_ to be The Mole, Julia as a Guile Heroine and Actual Pacifist...
-   _Code Geass_ features a prime example of the useless-and-only-an-annoyance-kind of La Resistance until Lelouch turns them from a bunch of scraps playing guerilla against the Britannian Empire to a fully organized and highly efficient army with victory after victory as its signature (that doesn't mean they're error-free, as we painfully find out in the Special Zone incident and the following Black Rebellion).
-   In _Death Note_, the Anti-Kira Taskforce gradually becomes this as Kira's rule spreads and gains support, especially after the US of A stops opposing him.
-   In _The Elusive Samurai_, the secret resistance movement that wishes to take Kamakura back from the Ashikaga clan and the Emperor is built up over the course of two years and includes members of the Suwa Shrine, several disgruntled retainers around the Shinano region, and remnants of the Hojo clan who managed to escape the massacre.
-   In _Endride_, the Ignauts form as a revolutionary army seeking an ideally non-violent overthrow of the kingship, in hopes of more equality and support for the disadvantaged. When King Delzaine is suddenly killed by a third party, a major wrench is thrown in their plans and they end up becoming something of a temporary peacekeeping militia instead as the country falls apart.
-   The Gekkostate in _Eureka Seven_, an anti-military commune which opposes the United Federation.
-   Stick/Scott Bernard's True Companions in _Genesis Climber MOSPEADA_/_Robotech: New Generation_ as they fight the Inbit/Invid that have invaded and conquered Earth.
-   The Jouishishi from _Gintama_, who set out to take down the Amanto even if it meant going out into an all-out war with them. They failed. However, Katsura is the only one that makes an attempt to carry out any of the original group's ideals after that failure (and even then, it's kind of laughable); Gintoki decided that fighting stupid enemies was pointless and dropped out, Takasugi became a Nietzsche Wannabe in order to avenge the death of his teacher, and Sakamoto started a company of merchant spaceships.
-   The People's Army in _Glass Fleet_ is fighting against the tyrannical Holy Empire.
-   A staple of the _Gundam_ series.
    -   The original example being the AEUG, first introduced in _Zeta Gundam_. They were a bit of an odd example though, in that they did not oppose the government itself, per se, but rather they opposed the formation of an autonomous State Sec in space (the Titans). They actually started out as a lobbying group within the Federation government before arming themselves and taking in like-minded personnel from the Federation military. Once the Titans were abolished, the AEUG peacefully dissolved back into the Federation, their goals having been accomplished.
    -   The Principality of Zeon in the first _Mobile Suit Gundam_ portray themselves as freedom fighters looking to liberate space colonies from a corrupt and oppressive Earth Federation. In actuality, Zeon gained their independence from Earth years before the start of the series and are simply using anti-Federation rhetoric to justify their own takeover of the Earth Sphere. They're perfectly willing to trample on their fellow Spacenoids when it suits them.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_ dealt with five space colonies and their respective scientists training five teenage boys in guerrilla warfare and piloting their respective Gundams, just so that they could overthrow a corrupt Earth-based government led by the United Earth Sphere Alliance, followed by the Romefeller Foundation after the latter overthrew the former. Eventually, a new rebel army called White Fang would corrupt the very rebellion the Gundam pilots staged, namely by stealing a space station from Earth-based military organization, OZ, and dropping it on Earth to render it uninhabitable.
    -   Crossbone Vanguard, originally The Empire in _Gundam F91_, turns into La Resistance in _Crossbone Gundam_.
    -   _Mobile Suit Victory Gundam_ has the League Militaire, created to fight the Zanscare Empire when the Federation is too weak to do so.
-   _The Heroic Legend of Arslan_ features a restore-the-old-regime variant, with the young crown prince gathering an army to retake his fallen kingdom. "And thus, the boy becomes a king..."
-   _Inazuma Eleven Go!_ features "The Resistance", a group fighting against Fifth Sector who rule over the JHS soccer world with an iron fist, fixing matches and taking away "real soccer". The Resistance is based at Teikoku and existed before Raimon began their solo fight against Fifth Sector, although Raimon join The Resistance after they beat Teikoku in Holy Road.
-   _Kill la Kill_ has Nudist Beach, which live up to the name by being clothed in nothing but strategically placed belts and pouches. They fight against the usage of clothing for oppression. They later formally join forces with Ryuko and Satsuki after it becomes clear that all three parties are fighting the same enemy.
-   Harato's militia in _The Legend of Mother Sarah_ is composed mainly of resistance fighters whose main goal is to overthrow the military oligarchs of Mother Earth and Epoch in order to end the False Dichotomy both factions propose in regards to what to do with Earth's future.
-   Tends to show up in the _Leijiverse_ a lot, particularly in _Arcadia of My Youth_ and _Space Symphony Maetel_.
-   _Lupin III_ runs into these a few times.
    -   In _The Hemingway Papers_, Lupin finds himself searching for a lost treasure on the island of Colcaca, where a bunch of prospectors and mercenaries have taken over the island and started a war amongst themselves. The native islanders formed The Scorpions, a guerrilla force dedicated to liberating their home. Unfortunately, they were found out and the result wasn't pretty. Only one member survived, this story's Girl of the Week.
    -   In _The Secret of Twilight Gemini_: After more than three hundred years of civil war, the remnants of the Geltic Tribe continue to fight the oppression of the Igo Tribe, who drove them from their ancestral home. Lara and her friend, Zora, lead them in the quest to unify their people and reclaim their homeland. With help from Lupin, of course.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   The Revolutionary Army, an anti-government faction directly opposed to the World Government and led by none other than Luffy's father, Dragon. So far they haven't actually appeared often, but they'll certainly be more important down the line. Luffy's ties to the Revolution have become stronger over the Time Skip. Robin was protected by them during those two years and it's recently been revealed that Luffy's other older brother, the long-thought dead Sabo, is alive and the _second-in-command_ of the Revolutionary Army.
    -   A smaller example with the rebellion of Alabasta; Believing that King Cobra has become The Caligula, they are completely unaware that they are in fact the Unwitting Pawn of Sir Crocodile's coup, and when the rebel leader learns the Awful Truth, he tries to enlighten his fellow rebels- only to learn firsthand that Crocodile's Baroque Works have infiltrated both rebel and royal armies.
    -   Another smaller one for the Tontatta Tribe found in Dressrosa. Consisting entirely of dwarfs and one renegade Living Toy, they are dedicated to upending Don Quixote Doflamingo's rule of the kingdom and reinstating the ruling family prior to Doflamingo's coup. When Doflamingo fakes his resignation from the Shichibukai, which had given them hope that he would finally be removed as king, it becomes the final straw that pushes them into taking action. Incidentally, Doflamingo only faked his resignation after being blackmailed by Law, who captured a scientist that played a crucial element in his black market business with the help of the Straw Hat crew; they become justifiably horrified when they learn of this.
    -   While Wano Country does have people opposed to Orochi, they are painfully aware that they are no match for Kaido and the Beast Pirates who enforce his rule. As such, they lay low for 20 years and don't actually band together until the Nine Red Scabbards return to lead them.
        -   When Momonosuke and half of the Nine Red Scabbards were sent 20 years into the future, Ashura Doji gathered fellow rebels to prepare for their return. After ten years, however, most of the rebels began to doubt that they had actually travelled in time, and decided to launch their own raid on Onigashima before they became too old to fight. Predictably, they were all killed, which turned Ashura Doji into the cynical man he is in the present. He eventually gets out of his funk when he's reunited with the rest of the Scabbards, after which the gang of bandits he leads promptly pledges their support to the cause.
        -   Kawamatsu rescued Hiyori from Oden Castle after it was burned by Kaido, but eventually she ran away from him after she became afraid that he would starve himself to death for her. While this nearly drove him into despair, Kawamatsu decided that there was still something that he could to and began amassing weapons for the rebels by collecting them from the graves in Ringo. While he was admittedly ashamed of Robbing the Dead, he rationalized that the dead samurai would be more than happy to help remove Orochi from power. Eventually, he began stealing weapons from Orochi's men, which landed him in Udon's Prisoner Mine. Onimaru continued his work after Kawamatsu was imprisoned by posing as Gyukimaru (Kawamatsu's alias) and relieving people of their weapons in Ringo. When Kawamatsu broke out of prison and returned to Ringo, he found that his weapon stash had vastly increased in size and that the weapons had been restored and maintained to the point of usability.
        -   Kin'emon quickly begins to make plans to raid Onigashima during the Fire Festival, where Orochi and his retainers will have a dinner party with Kaido and his crew. However, his plans are leaked to Orochi and the comrades they gathered are imprisoned. They are liberated at the last minute by Denjiro, who had until now posed as Kyoshiro, one of Orochi's retainers and head of his own Yakuza family, who also pledge their support to the rebellion.
        -   After Luffy gets curbstombed into next week by Kaido and thrown in the Prisoner Mine, he becomes friends with an old man named Hyogoro, formerly the most powerful Yakuza boss of Wano, who agrees to train Luffy after becoming impressed with him. When he later learns that the rebellion is still alive, he becomes overjoyed that he has lived long enough to see it and pledges his support. The rest of the Yakuza bosses follow suit after they are released from prison and mobilize to gather their subordinates before the Fire Festival.
        -   Luffy later starts a Prison Riot, during which he gives a Rousing Speech to the rest of the prisoners that rekindles their spirits and convinces them to fight the wardens. When they learn that he's a pirate just like Kaido and start having doubts about the rebellion, Momonosuke seals the deal by revealing himself, showing them that the Kozuki Family is still alive. This motivates them to pledge their support.
        -   Ultimately, and thanks to everyone's efforts (and a colossal amount of luck), Kin'emon suddenly finds himself leading a sum total of 5,400 men towards Onigashima, all of them fully armed and burning with determination.
-   _Romeo × Juliet_ has the followers of the overthrown regime of the Capulets, fighting against the usurper Lord Montague. Not quite as Shakespeare wrote it, but it's more of an homage to Shakespeare's favorite tropes in general than an adaptation — Juliet is a Sweet Polly Oliver vigilante, for one.
-   In _Saint Beast_, the rebellion against Zeus is lead by the six Saint Beasts until four of them end up Brainwashed and Crazy leading to its failure and Judas and Luca taking the fall for it.

-   _Shimoneta_'s OP explains that SOX is fighting the oppression of the Japanese government's censorship laws, which has banned all pornographic material and use of foul language for the last 16 years. Their country now has the highest morality rating in the world, except it's come at the expense of its citizens no longer understanding even basic Sex-Ed. SOX's goal is to correct the problem, for which, they've been branded as a group of "ero terrorists".
-   Team Dai-Gurren from _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_. Not only do they rebel against Lord Genome and his forces, but also the millennia-long reign of the Anti-Spirals.
-   The Dorssian Royalists in _Valvrave the Liberator_. There was a coup ten years prior in which a military dictatorship imprisoned — but didn't kill — most of the centuries-old royal dynasty, who were beloved by the people. L-elf and A-drei, a former prince, are planning their own revolution to restore the royal family. Later, it's revealed that Kriemhild is also working with a Royalist faction. It's notable that the Chancellor of the military federation wears the crown and facial markings of the royalty — possibly indicating that those symbols are really still that powerful even after the coup.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V_ features the Resistance, a group of Xyz Dimension survivors fighting back against invaders from the Fusion Dimension. Of the three members who show up in the series, Yuto is an Identical Stranger to series protagonist Yuya, Shun joins the Lancers as an Aloof Ally, and Kaito just serves as a glorified cameo when the main cast visits the now destroyed Xyz Dimension.

    Fan Works 

-   _Better Bones AU_: There are several of them throughout the series, some of which are new to the rewrite and others which existed in canon but are expanded upon with new members.
    -   Nightpelt's resistance against Brokenstar, which eventually overthrows him with Thunder Clan's help, included Deerfoot and Stumptail... and not Runningnose, who is a loyal supporter of Brokenstar here.
    -   Several TigerClan cats oppose their leadership and secretly help the half-Clan cats, mostly RiverClan cats with the exception of Deerfoot and Jaggedtooth due to Runningnose having killed a lot of the former Nightstar supporters from ShadowClan in the epidemic. Besides Deerfoot and Jaggedtooth, this includes Reedpaw, Mudfur, Mosspelt, Dawnflower and Swansong. They allow Stormpaw, Featherpaw and Mistyfoot to escape to ThunderClan but Deerfoot gets caught and killed for refusing to name his allies.
    -   Breezepelt and Heathertail oppose the Kin from within it and help rescue many cats slated for execution, with the help of Wind Clan allies like Harespring and Brushblaze.
    -   As in canon, there is a resistance against the Bramblestar impostor, though this time Cloudtail and Briarlight are also involved, and Finchpaw is an active member rather than just leaving with Sparkpelt, helping set up the reputation of Firestar's kin as heroes.
-   _Equestria: A History Revealed_: Celestia is forced to create the resistance to reclaim all of Equestria that she lost in her absence to Nightmare Moon. She reclaims small towns at first, relying on guerilla tactics while slowly amassing a larger and larger army of ponies who choose to fight on her side, before eventually reclaiming the east with a large enough army to move into the rest of Equestria.
-   _FFS, I Believe in You_: In the sequel, the unpopularity and tyrannical rule of the Mormaer have caused an armed insurgency to form against him in Zola Province, resulting in a rapidly escalating conflict that the main characters find themselves drawn into.
-   _Pony POV Series_:
    -   The Dark World Series has several rebel groups aimed at bringing down Discord. While there's some level of cooperation between them, there doesn't appear to be a central command structure aside from Discord himself infiltrating several groups and riling them up for his own amusement...or so it seemed, as by this time Discord had long since undergone a Heel–Face Turn Eclipse was preventing him from acting upon, so his motives may have been far less sinister by that point.
    -   Dark World also has the changelings, who thanks to Cadance are now symbiotic instead of parasitic and protect ponies from Discord. They're also immune to Discord's magic thanks to Cadance. Cadance once ruled them and their kingdom Avalon was about the only place safe from Discord. While she was eventually killed and it destroyed, the Changelings are still protecting ponies from Discord and Discord hasn't managed to infiltrate them either.
    -   The Shining Armor Arc has a group of Deer opposed to Makarov and the Hooviets, led by their true goddess, Mother Deer. The group eventually allies with Shining and Cadence's forces.
    -   During the Wedding Arc, this role falls to the Mane Six, the real Cadence and her entourage, and Misfit Actual, after Chrysalis' more elaborate and thought out plan succeeds in leaving Canterlot occupied by her forces without the main populace even being aware of it. As such, she's able to convince the public that _Cadence_ is the imposter, and that she's brainwashed the others. This forces them into hiding and having to strike against Chrysalis when they can, but they also manage to slowly reach out to trusted individuals in Canterlot, who are able to spread the word and round up help. By the time of the arc's climax, most of Canterlot has been roused up into an army, which fights the changelings alongside the heroes.

-   _Hivefled_: The Sufferists, although more of a Black-and-Grey Morality due to their Well-Intentioned Extremist leader Lereal. Either way, things don't end well for them.
-   _Night's Favored Child_ has the Harbingers of Dawn (or "Dawnists", for short). They're mostly in the background right now, but Twilight's late parents were members, as is Miss Loch, the head of the orphanage Twilight grew up in.
-   _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ has Empath secretly forming one in the alternate timeline where Papa Smurf marries Smurfette.
-   _My Hostage, Not Yours_: The third story, where Zim and Gaz go full-scale Villain Protagonist and start taking over Earth, sees Dib form a resistance with his classmates, which he simply calls "the Group" (Gaz lampshades how lame it is). There's also the Swollen Eyeball Network, which proves to be much more effective. Both fail, though the epilogue reveals that resistance groups continue to pop up worldwide for years afterwards.
-   _Mega Man Recut_ has the Underground Alliance in "Future Shock."
-   _Queen of Shadows_ has the Shogunate in the Shadows, the elite group of warriors gathered from across Japan by Lord Rokutaro to lead his regular armies against the Shadowkhan.
-   _The Power That's Inside_ has Pikachu leading one of these.
-   In _The Lunar Rebellion_, a number of loyalist militias/insurgencies sprung up during the eponymous conflict, when Pegasopolis rose in rebellion against the rest of Equestria.
    -   Multiple small, disorganized ones formed by Solar loyalists spring in earth pony territory controlled by the rebels, with their scattered and decentralized nature (as well as their ability to go to ground amongst the civilians whenever Pegasopolian troops come around) making it very difficult for the elite pegasus army to fight the otherwise inexperienced and poorly supplied earth pony militias.
    -   A larger resistance is led by the unicorn magus Mossy Banks, who gathered a large number of loyalist earth ponies in his home in Froggy Bottom Bog and started striking rebel patrols and supply trains, keeping attacks at bay with a combination of ambushes, hostile terrain and using his magic to turn the very bog and its animals against invaders. It’s mentioned that in modern times, Mossy Banks has become something of a folk legend.
-   _The Queen of Sunshine and Bright Things_: It's mentioned that the benevolent Queen Elsa gets several petitions a month from angry citizens who fear her ice powers and want to dethrone her. A few days in a cell usually fixes the issue, at least until the next attempted resistance starter pops up.
-   _Fallen Kingdom_ has the Fire Flower resistance, led by Yoshi, which has resisted Bowser since he took the world.
-   The ERF in _Power Rangers Cosmic Defenders_ starts out as this, before becoming an Ultraman-esque defence organisation.
-   AVALANCHE in _Seventh Endmost Vision_, unlike in canon _Final Fantasy VII_, is portrayed as a worldwide resistance movement against Shinra, instead of a handful of people in Midgar's underbelly. This brings it into line with the portrayal of AVALANCHE in the rest of the Compilation, though, rather funnily, Barret is still the leader, though this time he is the head of _all_ AVALANCHE. Several characters who were not part of it in canon have joined- such as Rufus and his Turk squad, along with the Turk Cissnei, who apparently was it's _co-founder._
-   _For the Glory of Irk_: After The Conspiracy pulling the strings of the Irken Empire is uncovered, the Irkens aware of it and free of its control start building a resistance based on Earth, with nominal support from the Syndicate.
-   _Becoming a True Invader_:
    -   On Heboad, Tel leads a rebel group against his sister Pel's cult's authoritarian rule of their society.
    -   Despite the fact that Oberox has no native species, its key location as an armory makes it a flashpoint for anti-Irken resistance groups from around the galaxy to gather and fight against the local Irken forces running the place.
-   _Chasing Dragons_: Oberyn Martell tries doing things this way after failing to defeat Stannis in a conventional war. While it works seemingly alright for awhile, after his death his movement either broke up or degenerated into banditry.
-   _Earth's Alien History_: The Freedom for Pioneers Movement is a group of Cardassian colonists and sympathetic Bajorans who fight back against the Bajoran government's oppression of the Cardassian population of the worlds ceded to them following the Praxis War.
-   _Tarkin's Fist_: Following the surrender of Great Britain to the Empire, a resistance movement called the Merry Men springs into action to oppose the Imperial occupiers and their British collaborators. They are led by Prince Harry.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension_: The alternate dimension versions of Candace, Buford, Baljeet (sorry, _Dr._ Baljeet), Isabella and the Fireside Girls, and later, Phineas and Ferb, are members of the Resistance against the alternate dimension version of Doofenshmirtz.
-   The backstory of one chef in _Ratatouille_ involved running guns for one of these. "Which one?" "He won't say — apparently they didn't win."
-   _Shrek Forever After_: The alternate universe has a secret band of ogres, led by Princess Fiona, who plan to attack and overthrow Rumpelstiltskin.
-   _Sky Blue_: A spontaneous rebellion forms around Shua after one of them is killed by Ecoban soldiers. They end up being instrumental to Dr. Noah's plan.
-   _South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut_ is the Trope Namer with a French-themed La Resistance being composed of the children of South Park rebelling against their parents in the hope of rescuing Terrence and Philip from being executed. They even had their own song, as well as a Dark Reprise.

    Music 

-   Leonard Cohen's song "The Partisan", from _Songs from a Room_, is a translation of a 1942 song about the French resistance during World War Two.
-   The Chant des Partisans, which exalts the sacrifices made by the opponents to the Nazi occupation and became the unofficial anthem of the French Resistance, is one extremely badass example.
-   The Resistance is a reoccurring faction in Kaizers Orchestra's song universe, especially in _Ompa Til Du Dør_, which is set during WW2.
-   Subverted in the film Rattle and Hum, where, during a performance of "Sunday, Bloody Sunday", Bono rages against the IRA, and calls out Irish Americans for glamourising and idolising what most Irish people view as ruthless terrorists.
-   The 1970 sci-fi concept album _Blows Against the Empire_ by Paul Kantner & Jefferson Starship has hippies in the 1990s operating as La Résistance against an increasingly oppressive US government.
-   Sabaton's songs "Coat of Arms" about the Greek resistance and "Uprising" about the doomed 1944 Warsaw Uprising glorify the tough resistance of those patriots who fought the Nazis and tried to free their countries.
    
    _"Warsaw...**rise!**"_
    

    Pinball 

-   _Foo Fighters (2023)_: The Show Within a Show depicts the titular band as freedom fighters battling a hostile alien overlord attempting to take over the United States.

    Podcasts 

-   _Mission to Zyxx_ has at least two. The first season opening crawl references a rebellion against the Galactic Monarchy that establishes the Federated Alliance. The Rebel Alliance then arises to oppose the Federated Alliance.

    Radio 

-   _Journey into Space_: In _The World in Peril_, Paddy Flynn tells the _Discovery_ crew and Frank Rogers that he is the leader of a resistance against the Martians. He composed a rebel song, "The Green Hills of Earth", that he and the other resistance members sing on a regular basis. However, Paddy later admits that the so-called rebellion had been mostly talk and that he had never intended to take direct action against the Martians.
-   _The Resistance_ was the original title announced for what became _Welcome to Our Village, Please Invade Carefully_ about an alien invasion in the English Home Counties. The Resistance in this case consists of just two people.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The _Champions_ scenario _The Sands of Time_ features an extradimensional species, the Orisha, who are ruled by a theocracy set up by one of the scenario's villains. There is also a rebel movement of heretics, though not too surprisingly, they're a little nuts. Still, they heretics _are_ a resistance force who can help the PCs against the evil government of their world.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   _Dark Sun_ has the Veiled Alliance which provides most support in areas of non-defiling magic and helping slaves to escape.
    -   _Forgotten Realms_ got Randal Morn and his supporters conducting guerilla war against Zhentarim occupation of Daggerdale for about 16 years (1353-1369) before Zhents were finally kicked out and he became the official ruler. Calimshan has Janessar, the group with strongholds in Marching Mountains that works to support common folk and free slaves.
-   In _Giant Guardian Generation_, the Revolutionary United Front has taken up arms against the Outsider-led United Earth Federation. Curiously, although they're outnumbered, the RUF appears to have the technological edge of better Gears and the AI-controlled Mobile Battleship Wagner.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_ has the Mirran resistance struggling against the forces of New Phyrexia. They know the odds are against them and that they are vastly outnumbered, which is reflected in the greater number of Phyrexian cards in the "New Phyrexia" block, but they refuse to lay down and give up.
    -   In _Return to Ravnica_ story, the population who are not part of the ten guilds are starting to take up arms against those guilds. Considering that the ten guilds include The Mafia who'll bleed people (of their money or life) dry, Mad Scientist guild who should be maintaining the city's infrastructure but aren't, sneaky spy guild, an entire clan of barbarians and so on, it is understandable why the populace are angry.
    -   The Renegades of Kaladesh block, who reject the repressive Consulate's control over the aether flow. They're not shown to be _totally_ pleasant (they have ties with organised crime), but given that the Consulate has been Hijacked By Nicol Bolas (via his proxy Tezzeret), there was pretty much no way they _wouldn't_ be the good guys.
-   The _Pathfinder_ adventure path "Hell's Rebels" is all about building one of these up after the city of Kintargo is taken over by Barzillai Thrune and placed under martial law. To free their city, the player characters gradually build up their popular support through acts of heroic resistance in order to overthrow Barzillai and declare their independance from the Thrune-ruled nation of Cheliax.
-   _Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution_: The Zodiac Order and they play this image up to new recruits and hangers-on. They're an underground organization of disenfranchised espers (primarily young espers) living on the fringes of society that actively fight against the government to bring in a new world where they'll be free.
-   _The Resistance_ is all about this. Some players (randomly chosen) are the Resistance, and some are The Mole. The aim of the resistance is to accomplish at least three out of five missions. The aim of the traitors is to sabotage at least three out of five missions.
-   _Sentinels of the Multiverse_ features the Thorathian Rebellion, a resistance movement dedicated to fighting the tyranny of Grand Warlord Voss, as part of the Dok Thorath Capital environment. Skyscraper used to be a member before being kidnapped by the Bloodsworn Colosseum so she could be a space wrestler.
-   The _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ card Huge Revolution is part of a story where the Oppressed People started to plot and plan until they formed a United Resistance against a tyrant. While this first revolution was unsuccessfull, the Emperor's cruelty and carelessness led to a second, successful one. (To date, at least. When last seen, he was being mocked by his former subjects, but future cards may continue the story.)

    Theatre 

-   In _Les Misérables_, Les Amis de l'ABC (whose name has "the friends of the downtrodden" as a second meaning).

    Webcomics 

-   _Deviant Universe_ had the Freedom Fighters in the Freedom War arc, and the superheros of the world fighting against Omega in the Omega Rising arc.
-   In _Ensign Sue Must Die_, after Sue Prime creates the Sueniverse for her and her progeny to have her 'perfect' world, a multiverse-spanning resistance forms to fight the Sues and anyone they corrupted, consisting of Kirk, Bones, The War Doctor, Sherlock Holmes, Optimus Prime, Mr. T, Snake Eyes, Snoopy (as the Red Baron), Superman, the SWAT Kats, Luigi, Michael Jordan, Pippi Longstocking, Hercules, Xena Warrior Princess, Sailor Moon, Applejack, Scrooge McDuck, Spinks, Sam and Dean Winchester, Agent Coulson, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Moomintroll, Speedy Gonzales, Mega Man, Michaelangelo, and Bruce Lee.
-   _Existential Comics_: The 10th July 2017 comic discusses and spoofs the Existentialists involved in the French Resistance (Sartre, Beauvoir, Camus), noting that it amounted to three people more or less doing the same thing they did during the wartime but somehow convincing themselves that it's actually resisting Nazism. Of course this might be considered unfair if only when placed in context of the historical Resistance, most of which was far tinier than advertised and militarily not as impactful until D-Day, while Sartre _was_ imprisoned for several months in a POW month after the Fall of France.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   The Warweary Villein unites the pawns of Prospit and Derse and leads a rebellion against the Black King to end the war on Skaia. Then Jack Noir starts his bloody rampage, starting with the combined armies...
    -   Later, on post-Scratch Earth, adult versions of Rose and Dave lead La Resistance against the forces of Betty Crocker/the Condesce, who far in the future has taken over everything. Unfortunately, they are doomed to fail, but they go down fighting and take out some of her top puppet leaders in the process.
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!,_ Galatea joins Riboflavin thinking he represents some romanticized version of this. He's actually a megalomaniac.
-   _Legend of the Blue Diamond_: The Diamond Resistance. They are unhappy with the failing ecosystem, but Queen Ekala says they are enemies of her "perfect kingdom." If someone is found to be a member of the Diamond Resistance, they are killed.
-   _Magick Chicks_: After Cerise takes over Artemis Academy (chapter 16) and enthralls the faculty along with the rest of the student body, The Ninja Club are among the only ones left to oppose her. So they secretly abduct Dark Skye and replace her with Rain, in order to spy on Cerise and undermine her authority.
-   In _Nip and Tuck_, the Show Within the Show _Rebel Cry_ shows the revolt against the Empire — which gets crushed.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
-   _Remus_ is centered around one of these in a Dystopian future United States. Whether they're any better than the people their fighting is a major source of tension.
-   In _Sluggy Freelance_, when demons invade the Dimension of Lame, the humans put together a resistance movement. Unfortunately, since it's a very lame dimension, "resistance" consists mainly of hitting the demons with pies, and most people in the dimension even think _that_ makes them no better than the demons who kill them for fun and eat their souls. It's a very, _very_ lame dimension.
-   In _The Specialists_, the French Resistance plays an important role — such as here and here.
-   In _Squid Row_, one of the elderly they go carolling for belonged to the French Resistance.
-   In _Terra_ the Resistance want to stop the war between the humans and Azatoth because the unaligned races and civilians are getting it in the shorts, and because factions on both sides (the military-industrial complex in the UEC, and the Shadow Cabal in the Asurian Empire) have ulterior motives for continuing it. The Resistance formed out of an alliance between several militias and resistance groups.
-   _Unsounded_:
    -   The March is the big rebel group against Alderode's surveilance state, but not much is known about them save that Vienne was building Uaid for their leader. She was tortured to death before she ever finished, but it's notable that Uaid is _not_ a traditional war construct being designed to protect those he's carrying rather than kill opponents.
    -   The rebels in the Foi-Hellick affair allied with Cresce and managed to dismantle the Dammakhert's surveilance capacities in their entire ginnal before they were hunted down and killed by the Aldish military.
-   In _Without Moonlight_ there is the actual Resistance against the Nazi Occupation in Greece that is being organized, and the resistance by the gang of street rats Fotis leads throughout the comic.

    Web Original 

-   The _Chaos Timeline_ has various. Spaniards against Republican France, Germans against Russians and Italians, (again) various against the Socialists.
-   In _Decades of Darkness_, there are several ones fighting the expansionist, slaveholding \*USA, like the Velvet Underground in Pennsylvania, Mexican generals like Juarez, and Eunuco Mitchell (it's a pseudonym). Unfortunately, none have prevailed.
-   _Fire Emblem on Forums_ has many an example:
    -   _Chains of Horai_: The Amatsuan Resistance, divided into a poltiical arm of Internal Reformists and a military arm of warriors. They are led by the enigmatic Noriaki Kiritani who is heavily implied to be one of the Cursed and are allied with the friendly Kamisato Clan. Their aim, unusually, isn't necessarily to dethrone the Empress but to return some sense to her; the Empress has been so utterly obsessed with the Cursed that the Resistance was created out of frustration either to dethrone her or else knock some sense back into her for her to actually run her country.
    -   _Liberation Of Izzarra_: The protagonists are the last remaining vestige of the Izzarran resistance and travel all over the world to try to get support to remove Mordo from the eponymous country.
-   Taking from its source material, the Rebellion in _The Gungan Council_ have been revived several times to restore democracy after the Galactic Empire came back.
-   Both played straight and inverted in _A Hero's War_:
    -   Morey instigates an uprising to end slavery in Illastein. It quickly becomes messy, but he's smart enough — and has learned enough from Earth's history — to win the PR angle and minimise the alarm caused in all the neighbouring countries. His knowledge of guerrilla tactics doesn't hurt, either.
    -   Inverted when Minmay territory is invaded by neighbouring (and envious) Duport. The recent advances in farming equipment and the burgeoning industrial revolution, combined with widespread dissemination of knowledge about the basics of using magic, mean that the populace are pretty favourably disposed toward their chancellor. When Duport's knights start walking into villages to declare that the people will now answer to someone else, quite a lot of the peasants rise up _in favour of_ their current government, and drive the knights out with homemade wands and force of numbers.
-   _New Deal Coalition Retained_ has a couple of examples:
    -   The Polish Home Army, a militia formed by Lech Wałęsa after he secretly returns from exile during World War III, and which rises up against the communists when the war turns against them, thus enabling the Allied invasion and liberation of the country.
    -   The Timurid Liberation Front, a rebel army in the Soviets' Central Asian territories who rise up during WWIII in reaction to repression and being used as Cannon Fodder on the other fronts.
-   _No W_ has the Continental Army, a domestic militia group that emerges in 2008, composed of Americans of all stripes opposed to the oppressive Santorum administration.
-   In _Shadowhunter Peril_, the main characters are forced to become the Resistance because it's either fight back or die. They actually end up doing a pretty good job, even amassing a giant army of _**phoenixes**_ and raining a fiery storm down upon the Big Bad's capital city. Currently they're in the middle of the final battle, so there's no way of knowing who's going to win, especially with Lilith and Valentine still alive.
-   Some of Soviet Womble's most popular video series involve himself and his clanmates roleplaying as one of these in _Arma 3_'s "Antistasi" multiplayer mode. Both the campaigns he's made video series of have ended with the rest of the Zero Fucks Clan's Comedic Sociopathy and lethal idiocy causing everything to Go Horribly Wrong despite the best efforts of an increasingly exasperated Soviet, who's the closest thing ZF has to an Only Sane Man.
    
    **Soviet**: (shortly after the others realise they can use captured enemy NPCs as human shields) "\*sigh\* Are there any war crimes we have not yet committed?"
    
-   In _Survival of the Fittest_, the main opposition to the Arthro Taskforce, the terrorist organisation behind the games, comes from STAR, a militia primarily composed of past SOTF escapees and defected terrorists, who seek to destroy the AT and put an end to SOTF. Although they haven't managed a complete victory yet, in Version Four they launched a direct assault on the terrorist headquarters, killed Danya and rescued almost thirty of the abducted students. They didn't do anything in Version Five, but as of the prologue to Version Six, they seem to know about the latest abductions and to be planning some kind of intervention.
-   In _Victoria_, a story from _The Wanderer's Library_, the Earth has been taken over by… something. What exactly is never made clear, but they're opposed by the Human Resistance Group, who uses superior numbers and technology to fight back. Whether it eventually succeeds or fails is never elaborated upon.
-   Attempted in _Welcome to Night Vale_, when Tamika Flynn's army of well-read children try to rise up against StrexCorp.

    Western Animation 

-   _Amphibia_ has the Wartwood Resistance, formed by most of the main and supporting cast to combat against King Andrias' tyranny. They later join forces with rebel toad and newt forces led by Beatrix and Tritonio, respectfully

-   The Resisty from _Invader Zim_ were a resistance movement against the Irken Empire. To their credit, they very nearly destroyed the Massive, but only because Zim had seized control of it and had removed its defenses. Also in _Invader Zim_ is the Swollen Eyeball Network, a group of genre-savvy conspiracy theorists who have foiled alien invasions. Naturally, Dib is a proud member, codenamed Agent Mothman.
-   Lampshaded in _Justice League_ by Green Lantern in "Hearts and Minds." "There's always a resistance, isn't there?"
-   In The Movie _Kim Possible A Sitch in Time_, Kim's twin little brothers and tech buddy form a resistance by teaming up with an army of Super-enhanced Naked Mole-rats to overthrow an evil Shego who went from being a sidekick to an Evil Overlord who calls herself _the supreme one_.
    -   Should be noted that every person in the resistance is some how connected to Kim and Ron
    -   This trope was actually implied by one of the twins who yells "Viva La Renaissance" while shooting at the enemy to save his sister and friend.
-   The Burners in _Motorcity_, against Abraham Kane of Detroit Deluxe.
-   _My Grandmother Ironed the King's Shirts_: The resistance to the German occupation of Norway. They're briefly shown doing more traditional Resistance activities like blowing up a bridge. Then the titular grandmother organizes a resistance group of rebellious launderers who sabotage German uniforms.
-   The Great Rebellion in _She-Ra: Princess of Power_.
-   The Rebellion in the reboot _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_ continues to style itself as such, although they’re a coalition of kingdoms trying to _retain_ independence rather than trying to regain it.
-   The rebel pirates in _Skyland_.
-   The Knothole Freedom Fighters of _Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)_ and the comic book adaptation.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_ introduces Saw Gerrera's Partisans. Like the Rebel Alliance we all know and love, they're resisting the Empire. _Unlike_ the Alliance, they lean proudly and worryingly towards Well-Intentioned Extremist tendencies.
-   The 2003 version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had one in the Triceraton race, started by a Triceraton gladiator hoping to overthrow the corrupt Prime Leader.
-   _The Owl House_ has two independent groups:
    -   Covens Against The Throne (C.A.T.s), formed by Raine, Darius and Eberwolf, then joined by the main cast, to see how they can stop the Day of Unity and defeat Belos.
    -   New Hexside, first formed by Principal Bump and his students after discovering what the true outcome of the Day of Unity would be. After Bump was captured and Belos defeated, it reformed to try to survive The Collector's takeover of the isles.
-   _Urban Vermin_'s heroes, the Garbage Liberation Front, are a gang of Funny Animal rebels fighting against the dictatorship of the show's Big Bad (who happens to be the rebel leader's brother).
-   _The Venture Bros._:
    -   The Orange County Liberation Front is a resistance movement trying to take down the Brisby "empire", an obvious Disney parody.
    -   The second season also features a lame but zealous resistance to Baron Ünderbheit's iron-fisted (and -jawed) rule in Ünderland. One of their proudest achievements is sneaking a cat hair into his drink.
-   _W.I.T.C.H._:
    -   The first season features the rebellion against the Big Bad Phobos, with Badass Normal Caleb as the young rebel leader. After Phobos is defeated and imprisoned, the situation is inverted during Season 2, with a small band of Phobos' remaining loyal troops attempting to overthrow the benevolent queen Elyon.
    -   The Rebellion returns late in Season 2, after Phobos seizes the Seal of Nerissa and gains the power of two Hearts. He promptly tries to conquer Meridian again. And succeeds, at least for a short time.
