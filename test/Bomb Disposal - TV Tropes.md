Here, it's a metaphor. But it's always a good metaphor.

_"Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb!"_

Bombs, mines, and other explosives are a lethal threat, and sometimes, you have to disarm them rather than go around them, if they're blocking your way, hidden, or threaten the whole block/city. In fiction, our talented heroes can quickly and safely set them off (from a safe distance), disarm them before continuing on, throw them far away, or, if they're a cartoon character or huge monster, eat them, etc.

In Real Life, this isn't so easy. Even a bomb disposal expert with proper equipment finds it dangerous and difficult to disarm explosives. And it's probably worse if you have to set them off using nothing but a stick, or defuse them with nail clippers. Thankfully, in the 2020s, police have remote controlled robots that help make the job a little safer. Hence why this trope is a subtrope of Artistic License – Explosives.

In shows where physics is on a vacation, such as kids' cartoons, expect people to do things like swallowing the bomb or stuffing it into a not even nearly bombproof container, like a paper bag. See also Bombproof Appliance for more "serious" shows.

Gritty, realistic war movies and police shows may have a fairly accurate depiction of bomb disposal. Blockbuster action movies tend to depict defusing as simply a matter of choosing the right colored wire to snip; of course, if our hero is wearing Plot Armor, they'll always snip the right wire at the last second.

Truth in Television is that bomb and mine disposal is stressful and dangerous, even for the most seasoned professionals.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Desert Rose_: Given all the terrorists in the manga, naturally the protagonists have had to deal with bomb threats on a regular basis, with Jessica and Colleen's job focusing entirely on this.

-   Multiple instances in _Terror in Resonance_. In the most applicable, a character is held hostage in a vest full of explosives on a timer. Another races to disarm them all before they go off and kill both parties.

    Comic Books 

-   In the _Superman_ story "Time And Time Again Again", the quantum field generator that Superman and the Metal Men try carefully to extract from a pile of wreckage in Metropolis becomes volatile and ready to explode. Superman tries to fly it safely away from Metropolis, but it ends up exploding...though its explosion is stopped in its process by Liri Lee of the Linear Men transporting both the generator and Superman to Vanishing Point to study it. The Linear Men, however, have no interest in stopping the bomb from exploding and killing people in Metropolis, but Waverider, seeing what their technology can do, takes one of their time-travel controls and uses it to transport the generator to the distant past, where it explodes harmlessly without hurting anyone.

    Film — Animated 

-   _Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox_: Each of The Flash's Rogues that were present in the Flash Museum when Thawne first appeared got affixed with a bomb that, by Thawne's word, couldn't be deactivated. When the rest of the Justice League arrived, each took one of the Rogues to isolated locations to manage the detonations in their own way.

    Film — Live-Action

Instead, he gets rid of the nuke by putting it in a motorboat and sending it out to sea before the countdown hits zero.
-   _Godzilla Minus One_. Shikishima takes on the well-paid but dangerous work of clearing the thousands of sea mines laid in Japanese waters during the war. Clearing involves two small boats made of wood (to avoid setting off magnetic mines) towing a cable between them to cut the mine's tether so it will float to the surface and be detonated with gunfire. When Godzilla makes an appearance, they are ordered to use some of these cleared mines to try and stop it. Naturally the crew think this is even more suicidal than their usual job.

With "007" reading on the timer.
    -   An interesting variation in _The Spy Who Loved Me_, where he isn't disarming an armed nuke, but instead removing the non-nuclear explosive from one in storage. Naturally there's a failsafe to prevent this, namely a magnetic ring that has to pull the explosive through (think _Operation_, with detonation for failure). He then uses the bomb to get into a secure room.

Short on time, the convict suggests connecting wires to short out the timing mechanism, and Austin remembers the bomber's last dying words: Red, White, and Blue. They connect the red and white wires, and then Austin has a hunch that "blue" was deliberately misleading, "his final stab at the country he'd grown to hate," and correctly selects the yellow wire instead.

Most of the gameplay hinges around helping Sam deliver important cargo across the ruins of America from outpost to outpost, but at one point, he ends up being given a shady-looking package by an even-sketchier looking "maintenance worker", and upon investigating the contents, you'll find that it's a _thermonuclear bomb_ that will explode in thirty minutes unchecked, and _immediately_ if Sam lets go of it or it enters the city it was being delivered to. The only solution is to locate a massive tar pit through enemy-infested lines and chuck it in for a reduced explosion.

With a high skill, you can disarm the mine or even recover it to use yourself. If your skill level wasn't high enough, the mine might go off (or the disarm can simply fail). A jedi character with an anti-droid force power can fire it to detonate the mine at a safe distance.

Notably, the bomb disposal expert who gives the player the coolant spray stresses that they will _not_ be actually permanently disassembling the bombs here, as that is no task for amateurs. However, the coolant spray will keep the detonators frozen, preventing them from going off long enough to bring in a formal bomb squad to more thoroughly deal with them later. The facility itself is later destroyed when Arsenal Gear starts up, rendering the question of bomb disposal moot.

He tossed it under the car behind him, killing several people but sparing the crowd. He was later successfully assassinated when his driver got lost on the way back from visiting the people who were hospitalized as a result of the earlier attack. The rest is history.
-   One design feature of many foxholes or trenches is something known as a "Grenade Sump". In essence, it's a deep hole or ditch in the bottom of the foxhole. If a bad guy tosses a grenade into the foxhole, kick it into the grenade sump, then get as far away from it as you can. The ground absorbs much of the explosion, and directs the rest upwards.
    -   Some cities use concrete garbage cans for a similar reason: If someone decides to drop an explosive device into a trashcan (a convenient hiding place in a crowded area), the shape of the garbage receptacle will focus the blast upwards instead of outwards. Of course, many other cities simply get rid of public trash cans to avoid the issue entirely... with the obvious drawback that people who have trash they can't (or don't want to) carry home will probably dispose of it in a manner inconvenient for the city (and generally illegal to boot).
