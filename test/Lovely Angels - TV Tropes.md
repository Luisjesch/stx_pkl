_"Good evening. I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time. And this is my wife."_

_"Well, it's kind of like James Bond. But instead of Bond, there are these two women..."_

The most common Gender Flip of the Bash Brothers trope.

Female buddy-shows are rather widespread, especially in anime. This trope refers to adventure series starring two rather competent women with contrasting personalities — compare with Betty and Veronica, Red Oni, Blue Oni, Tomboy and Girly Girl, Light Feminine and Dark Feminine, and Bifauxnen and Lad-ette. They're usually not romantically involved with each other and generally are Just Friends. Subtext regarding otherwise may be present, though.

In contrast, female buddy _movies_ are extremely rare, probably since Most Writers Are Male.

More than two Lovely Angels eventually become known as an Amazon Brigade. Everything else of the above stays the same.

Not to be confused with Angelic Beauty. Compare Strictly Professional Relationship where it's a man and a woman who work together.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Gunsmith Cats_: The two main characters are Rally Vincent, a gunsmith and bounty hunter, and her partner Minnie May, an expert bomb-maker.
-   _Read or Die_, the original OVA version. They also had a third, male team member — he was just completely irrelevant to everything.
-   Heinkel and Yumie are unusual examples from _Hellsing_, with strong religious connotations, at that. They are Action Girl best friends who were raised by a Holy Hitman and appear numerous times on either side of Father Anderson's shoulders, seeming to represent a figurative version of fallen angels for Iscariot and the Catholic Church.
-   _You're Under Arrest!_: Natsumi and Miyuki are two police officers who are a pair.
-   _Noir_ and its second Spiritual Successor by the same studio, _El Cazador de la Bruja_. The first successor, _Madlax_, avoids this by a large margin despite having a similar setup (unless you ignore the monstrous gap in Madlax and Vanessa's skills and put them in the same league).
-   _Carried by the Wind: Tsukikage Ran_ is a show chronicling the adventures of a pair of young, attractive, asskicking female vagabonds wandering feudal Japan together. Meow is a cheerful Chinese martial artist looking for merriment and goodwill, while Ran is a snarky dark-haired Rōnin going wherever she can find good sake. Much of the show's humour comes from the two distinct personalities clashing and how they deal with the situations that arise each episode.
-   _Slayers_ had OVAs and movies where Lina is adventuring teamed up with a Vain Sorceress Naga, in Red Oni, Blue Oni contrast.
-   A _Code Geass_ radio drama taking place between the two seasons has Kallen and C.C. in this type of relationship. And then there's this piece of artwork.<small>◊</small>
-   The _Mazinger_ series: _Mazinger Z_ and _Great Mazinger_ had Sayaka and Jun (even if it was for a short while). _UFO Robo Grendizer_ has Hikaru and Maria.

-   _Futari wa Pretty Cure_ features Lovely Angel Magical Girls, as does _Futari wa Pretty Cure Splash★Star_. For at least half a season each, _Heart Catch Pretty Cure_ and _Suite Pretty Cure ♪_ fit this trope, too.
-   _Excel♡Saga_ initially starred two ladies, Excel and Hyatt, but they were two incompetent henchwomen, not two smart heroes. The anime kept this dynamic, while the manga added a third character, Elgala.

-   Anaak and Endorsi Jahad from _Tower of God_. Paired with Vitriolic Best Buds.
-   _Najica Blitz Tactics_: Najica and her Humaritt sidekick Lila.
-   _Michiko & Hatchin_ has some of this, despite the age difference between the leads.
-   Noriko and Kazumi in _GunBuster_. Nono and Lal'C in _Diebuster_.

-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   There's Nanoha and the newly-befriended Fate during _A's_. Others are solo fares (1st season) or feature Amazon Brigades (_StrikerS_, _ViVid_, _Force_). Nanoha and Fate have, in-universe, inspired several examples of similar pairings, complete with both action duo dynamics and Les Yay. Teana and Subaru from _StrikerS_ are this trope when operating by themselves. Vivio and Einhard of _ViVid_ are nearly certain to go in their footsteps as well, once they grow up.
    -   There was also Quint and Megane, prior to their entire unit sans Quint getting killed by Jail Scaglietti's forces.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ takes this to the logical extreme with Panty and Stocking being literal angels... except they're not too angelic personality-wise.
-   _Tetragrammaton Labyrinth_ with Meg and Angela
-   _Rosario + Vampire_. Kurumu Kurono: succubus with huge boobs, Femme Fatalons the size of your average assassination knife, wings, a tail, and need it come to that, seductive supernatural powers. Mizore Shirayuki: abominable snowgirl who can hurl icy shuriken at you, cut you open herself with claws of ice, and freeze you heel-to-hair if you've so much as a drop of liquid on you (and sometimes even without). It's not called the Black and White Duet because of their skin tone (both have pale-ish skin); it's because _they're **that** different and they can **still** dance like that_.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Different Story_: This spin-off manga of _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ and the _Farewell Story_ drama CD it adapted reveal that Mami Tomoe and Kyouko Sakura were like this during their early days as Magical Girls - growing into Heterosexual Life-Partners. It is only when the Pater Familicide went down and Kyouko grew into her Social Darwinist tendencies that she and Mami fell out.
-   _Pokémon Heroes_ has a villainous example in Annie and Oakley, a sister team that combines Tomboy and Girly Girl and Foolish Sibling, Responsible Sibling character dynamics.
-   _Lycoris Recoil_ has Chisato, a Technical Pacifist Genki Girl with light-colored short hair who excels in radical tactics, and Takina, the Unscrupulous Hero who is more demure and has long, dark hair, excelling in conventional tactics.

    Comic Books 

-   Page image features Misty Knight and Colleen Wing, from the second volume of _Heroes for Hire_. The two of them happen to be _so badass_, even the _Rhino_ is afraid of them. They are good friends and normally appear together, but the epitome of their Lovely Angels dynamic can be seen in _Daughters of the Dragon_.

They starred, along with Catwoman, in _Gotham City Sirens_ as a trio of attractive, deadly women on the town in Gotham. And then there was that exchange where Harley informed Batgirl that Ivy had given her some kind of treatment so they could "play" together. More than one fan has taken this as outright confirmation of a canon relationship. Paul Dini says it was.
-   _Whiteout_: Before the changes made to the movie, it starred US Marshal Carrie Stetko and pal solving murders down in Antarctica. Unfortunately, The Movie (For various ridiculous reasons) felt that two female leads was a bad choice for a film, and made one of them a man (and not even one of the already existing men from the comics, but a completely new creation).
-   The Italian comic series _Legs Weaver_ has such a team of the titular character and her sidekick May. The lesbian relationship is overt this time.
-   _Patsy and Hedy_ eventually had Patsy and Hedy in a relationship of this sort when they dropped the mutual romantic interest.
-   _Supergirl_ and _Batgirl_:
    -   Kara Zor-El and Barbara Gordon during the Silver Age. They first teamed up in _The Supergirl-Batgirl Plot_ and they quickly became best friends and an excellent crime-fighting duo.
        
        **Supergirl:** _"It just took a little teamwork to accomplish our goal, Batgirl"_  
        **Batgirl:** _"Right, Supergirl! We make a great twosome!"_
        
    -   In _The Attack of the Annihilator_, Kara and Barbara team up to take the Annihilator down. Although Batgirl feels she has little to contribute to the fight, Supergirl is delighted to fight alongside her.
    -   In the Post-Crisis continuity, Supergirl teamed up with _the third Batgirl_, Stephanie Brown. They hit it off from the start and often fight together. Kara goes to Steph's aid whenever she needs her, and doesn't put up with people picking on her friend.
    -   In _Supergirl (Rebirth)/Batgirl (Rebirth)_ crossover _Escape from the Phantom Zone_, Kara and Barbara renew their friendship as battling a particularly sadistic Kryptonian Mad Scientist.
    -   In _Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl_, Kara and Barbara are forced to team up. In spite of their differences, both super-heroines manage to work together and become a very effective crime-fighting duo.
        
        **Bruce:** Two cranky girls take down a pillar of society...
        
    -   In the _DC Universe Holiday Special 2008: A Day Without Sirens_, Oracle and Supergirl team up to stop all crimes in Gotham during one day<small>◊</small>.
    -   In _Bizarrogirl_, Kara and her Bizarro counterpart team up to defeat the godship and save Bizarro-World.
    -   Their Earth-Two counterparts Huntress and Power Girl have this dynamic in 2011 series _Worlds' Finest_. Which is a throwback to their original team-ups on Pre-Crisis Earth-2. Batman's daughter, Superman's female cousin — what could be more obvious than that they'd become a team?
    -   Kara and Terra fought together in Power Girl's 2009 book. Usually Kara fights at the forefront as Terra handles group control and attacks from afar with her geokinesis.
-   In _Superman vs. Shazam!_, while the titular heroes square off, Supergirl and Mary Marvel search for the impersonators who tricked their relatives into fighting each other, discover the real Big Bad and his plan, and set off to stop him.
-   In _Superman_ story _The Phantom Zone_, the nuclear holocaust schemed by General Zod is averted thanks to Supergirl and Wonder Woman working together and destroying all nuclear warheads.
    
    _"In moments the combined might of the two most powerful women on Earth reduces the missiles to a hail of flaming metal that sizzles and sinks into the icy strait below!"_
    
-   _Guardians of the Galaxy_ has Gamora and Angela, who hit it off after they beat the tar out of each other in their first encounter. They enjoy going on missions together, and generally have each other's backs. There's a bit of a Les Yay vibe as well.
-   During the Golden Age of Comics Wonder Woman, a magical Amazon Princess, almost always teamed up with Etta Candy, a prankster Badass Normal Ladette, for fighting Nazis, gangsters and alien menaces. Sometimes they were joined by members of Etta's Holliday Girls or Steve Trevor but Di and Etta made a solid team of two very contrasting ladies. In the modern age, Diana frequently teams up with her fellow Amazon, Artemis, either of the Wonder Girls or other female superheroes like Power Girl and Black Canary.
-   _Batgirls (2021)_ sees the batgirls Stephanie Brown and Cassandra Cain team up to fight crime, under the watchful eye of Barbara Gordon as Oracle.

    Fan Works 

-   _A Crown of Stars_: During the military campaign to overthrow the warlords ruling the post-Third Impact world Asuka bonded with several of her female comrades like Ching or Misato. They fought effectively in tandem during several battles.
-   _Advice and Trust_: Asuka and Rei. When they start to spend time together their bond grows and they learn to fight together more effectively. Also, Asuka and Hikari. When they fought Zeruel, Hikari was stuck inside Unit 03, and Shinji used her bond with Hikari to move it around and fight.
-   _The Child of Love_: Asuka and Rei were war mecha pilots and teammates, but due to Asuka being pregnant for most of the history they did not fight a lot together. Still they coordinated their attacks to fight an Eldritch Abomination in chapter 3, Asuka came up with a strategy to fight their enemy in chapter 7 and Rei followed it, and in the sequel they fought together like Arael and Armisael.
-   _Children of an Elder God_: In this crossover Asuka and Rei team up to destroy Eldritch Abominations... but not of _the usual kind_.
-   _Doing It Right This Time_: Asuka and Rei combine it with Battle Couple. In the altered timeline Asuka comes along early and she and Rei start training together (and hooking up with each other AND Shinji) and fighting in tandem. Her first success was taking down Ramiel.
-   _Evangelion 303_: The Evas (advanced war planes in this Alternate Universe) are two-seaters aircrafts. All female pilots are aided by female weapon officers. Asuka is Unit-02's pilot and Hikari is her weapons officer. Mari and Kelly pilot other of the war planes together.
-   _HERZ_: Asuka and Rei were teammates and fought together during the Angel War, but their giant robots were destroyed at the end of the conflict. However the organization HERZ rebuilds Unit-02 and builds a new Unit-00 during the history, and Asuka and Rei face and fight the Final Battle together (with Shinji).
-   _Higher Learning_: Asuka and Rei were part of a squad of Humongous Mecha pilots. Asuka was more focused on physical combat whereas Rei was a sniper, and both had undergone a decade of training. However their teamwork was poor due to their clashing personalities. Then they got a new teacher taught them to open up to others, and their combat effectiveness improved.
-   _Last Child of Krypton_: Unlike in the original series, Shinji did not become a pilot, so Asuka and Rei fought most of battles together in their war mechas. Asuka also went through a synch training with Rei (instead of Shinji) to fight Israfel coordinately.
-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_, Asuka, Rei and later Keiko are a female combat team.
-   _Once More with Feeling_: An involuntary but welcome consequence of Shinji meddling with the timeline was Asuka and Rei becoming friends and a better fighting team. As Shinji thought: "And woe to the enemies of humanity if this fragile new friendship grew into the simultaneously awesome and terrible weapon it could become..."
-   _The One I Love Is..._: Asuka and Rei were part of a team of Humongous Mecha pilots. Unfortunately, due to their different personalities and being fighting over the same boy their teamwork was pretty ineffective.
-   _The Second Try_: After returning to the past Asuka no loger is jealous of Rei and afraid of being replaced, so they fight together better. They teamed up successfully against Bardiel and fought coordinately against Zeruel (Asuka fought it hand to hand as rei provided cover fire).
-   _Superwomen of Eva 2: Lone Heir of Krypton_: In this crossover Asuka and Rei piloted giant robots and fought giant alien monsters together... and in their secret identities of _Supergirl_ and _Wonder Girl_ -respectively- they fought some super-villains together, like the Parasite. It was in that battle in which they cooperated and fought back-to-back where Asuka gained a newfound respect by Wonder Girl.
-   _Thousand Shinji_: Thanks to Shinji's mentoring in this crossover Asuka and Rei developed a better teamwork and new abilities (the former became a Super-Soldier and the latter a living factory of bio-weapons of mass destruction) turned them into a very dangerous team-up... until Rei tried to seduce Asuka's boyfriend (Shinji). After that point they were angry with each other and their teamwork suffered.
-   _Atonement_: Tether and Vista. After training together for a while they become a very effective combat unit.
-   _Intrepid_: Emma and Lisa fight together as members of the Undersiders.
-   _Wonderful (Mazinja)_: Taylor with Sophia or with Emma when they fight together. In chapter 13, Taylor and Emma teamed up to save their squad from a tank.
-   In _Power Girl_ story _A Force of Four_, Power Girl and Huntress are a scarily effective crime-fighting duo. Power also fights alongside Fury, Wonder Woman's daughter.
-   In _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_/_Supergirl_ crossover _The Vampire of Steel_, Buffy and Kara are a surprisingly good fighting team. Supergirl provides the muscle and sheer power and Buffy the fighting skills and expertise to deal with magic-based monsters.
-   Misty and Iris seem to be developing this dynamic in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, as they're often paired together in tournaments.
-   _Golden Threads Tie Us_ has Severa and Lucina. Both women trust and like each other, and find their fighting styles match well with each other.
    
    **Severa:** Are there any more of them creeping around?  
    **Lucina:** Most likely. I wouldn't be surprised if more were coming as we speak.  
    **Severa:** Right. Well, we'll just have to take them together.  
    **Lucina:** Of course. I'm lucky to be paired up with you.  
    **Severa:** Yeah, we have similar fighting styles. And I guess you're not Owain or Inigo.  
    **Lucina:** You're right, of course. But moreover, I'm glad you're with me. There are few I'd rather have by my side in battle.  
    **Severa:** Same goes for me. The princess is surprisingly handy with a sword.
    
-   Aldonza and Zapana in _Zero Context: Taking Out the Trash_ are best friends who were part of the same crimefighting organization for decades, know each others' combat styles forwards and backwards, and are at their best when they're fighting an opponent together. Aldonza herself is very free-spirited and personable, worries (sometimes needlessly) about her friends when they're in trouble, and specializes in wind attacks and martial arts; in contrast Zapana is laidback and mellow, and is well-versed in fire and straight-up punching enemies into oblivion.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous_ features a Tomboy and Girly Girl version.

-   Averted in the film adaptation of _Whiteout_, as Executive Meddling decreed that people wouldn't go to see a movie with two female leads. Which means Yuri Fans are going to miss out on some Les Yay.

-   Sara and Maria from _Bandidas_.
-   The film _Feds_. Two women: one a badass ex-Marine, the other a booksmart wimp, team up to defy their chauvinist classmates and instructors and become Special Agents of the FBI.
-   _The Heat_ with the at first emotionally repressed, by the book, FBI agent with very good results in getting her man paired with a wild, emotional, Perp Sweating, Cluster F-Bomb using Police Detective who is also good at getting her man.
-   The Marias from _Viva Maria!_.
-   Louise and Maria at the end of _The Legend of Frenchie King_, after spending most of it feuding.
-   The main characters from _Blonde in Black Leather_.

    Literature 

-   _Dirty Pair_: Trope Namers Kei and Yuri are a female team of detectives-for-hire. While "Lovely Angels" is their official code name, they're more often known as the "Dirty Pair" for all the destruction they cause in their wake, much to their frustration. They are the inspiration for all of the Manga and Anime pairs, above.
-   Mercedes Lackey's _Heralds of Valdemar_ books have Tarma and Kethry, a swordswoman and a mage, traveling the country as a team of mercenaries. (Tarma is a celibate priestess and Kethry eventually marries, but their relationship outlasts her marriage when Kethry's husband eventually passes on.)
-   Despite their differences, Angua and Sally of the City Watch appear to be on their way to this trope in the _Discworld_ books.
-   Nancy Drew and her two best friends, cousins Bess Marvin and George Fayne. George and Bess are Nancy's most frequent companions in helping her solve mysteries and bring down the bad guys.
-   In the Vlad Taltos books, Norathar and Cawti, aka The Sword and Dagger of the Jhereg, were a two-woman assassin team, and for a long time they only had each other to rely on. After their lives changed radically, they continue to be the best of friends. In _Tiassa_, the two briefly resume their old partnership, to the enjoyment of both.
-   The light and dark sisters in Jane Yolen's _Great Alta Saga_. Every light sister calls up a dark sister to be her lifelong companion in battle.
-   In _The Echo Case Files_, Sara Ramirez and Maggie Tycho.
-   In the psycho world of espionage set in _MARZENA_, Marian and Livia are this.
-   The princess and barbarian duo of _Sparrow and Bright_ fit this description.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: It didn't last very long either time, but Buffy had this partnership with both Kendra (who got killed) and Faith (who turned to the dark side).
-   _Xena: Warrior Princess_ has the title character and her sidekick Gabrielle, although the Subtext eventually surfaced.
-   _Cagney & Lacey_, portraying two female police detectives working as partners, pioneered the idea of a female buddy-cop show, sometimes dealing with issues of women in a traditionally male role and environment.
-   _Charlie's Angels_ upped the ante by including a third girl. So did _She Spies_, which some consider to be a _Charlie's Angels_ knock-off.
-   _Super Sentai_ and _Power Rangers_ usually have an episode a season where the male Rangers get into trouble and the girls become the episode's focus as they team up to bail them out.
    -   _Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger_'s "Twin Cam Angels," Jasmine and Umeko, become this in some episodes (complete with their own special end title.)
    -   _Power Rangers RPM_ even named their girl-power episode "The Dome Dolls".
-   Ichiko and Ritsuko in _Madan Senki Ryukendo_. They mostly served as comic relief, but got a few A Day in the Limelight moments - including one episode that involved one of the pair falling in love with a member of the show's Quirky Miniboss Squad.
-   _Nikki And Nora_, which garnered a fanbase despite only having an unaired pilot. The show was going to be about police partners in New Orleans who were also a closeted lesbian couple in a Secret Relationship.
-   _Rizzoli & Isles_ is about a Cop and Scientist\-meets-Tomboy and Girly Girl duo solving murders in Boston. It garnered _Nikki And Nora_ comparisons for having Homoerotic Subtext in spades.
-   While not the main characters of _Doctor Who_, Vastra and Jenny count, given that they're interspecies lesbian detectives who fight crime in Victorian London. Eventually, though, Strax the Sontaran joins the group, turning the situation into Two Girls and a Guy.
    
    **Vastra:** Good evening. I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time. And this is my wife.
    
-   _Scott & Bailey_: Janet Scott and Rachel Bailey work for the fictional Manchester Metropolitan Police Major Incident Team in this English series. They are a chalk & cheese pairing, rather like a modern-day Cagney & Lacey.
-   _Miami Vice_ has Gina and Trudy.
-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_: Both Amy Santigo and Rosa Diaz are competent female cops and often team up. They started to call themselves "the Sleuth Sisters" in Season 5.
-   _SOKO Potsdam_, one of many spin-offs of the long-running German police procedural show _SOKO 5113_, has as its group of main characters a "special commission"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  of police officers tasked with investigating murders and other serious crimes. Its English-translated version was renamed _Luna and Sophie_ after two female detectives in this group, whom the show focuses on initially. The show's official synopsis plays up<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  the "contrasting personalities" aspect of this trope.

    Manhwa 

-   _Yureka_ (translated as _ID\_Entity_) features a pair of Idol Singer minor characters actually _called_ The Lovely Angels.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   While Jungle Jack and Double Kong (and its variants) are Aja Kong's most successful tag teams, her pairing in Oz Academy with Hiroyo Matsumoto is likely her most successful team that qualifies for this trope. Aja Kong is a large, often overly brutal, no selling, face painted, delinquent haired, trash talking monster who is also prone to dirty cheats involving folding chairs and nunchucks. Hiroyo Matsumoto is well made up, almost always smiling and much smaller. Her wrestling style is much more traditional and her cheats slide more toward experimental pranks than unfair advantages or intent to cause unnecessary harm.
-   The eponymous duo from _Dirty Pair_ were inspired by the 1970s tag team wrestlers "The Beauty Pair".

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Double or Nothing_ is a two-player RPG designed around pairings of this type, especially infulenced by the Trope Namer. Any combination of sexes is game legal, but the example characters from the rulebook are both women.

    Video Games 

-   Bayonetta and Jeanne from _Bayonetta_ go from being rivals to being this by the end of the game, with both women willing to go through hell and high water for each other. Hell, in _Bayonetta 2_, Bayonetta goes on an out-and-out _Rescue from the Underworld_ after one of her demons goes rogue and Jeanne is Dragged Off to Hell.
-   Asuka and Hitomi Kaga, the pilots of the PC Engine Shoot 'Em Up _Burning Angels_. They wear identical Stripperiffic outfits.
-   _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_ stars Komaru Naegi, a friendly but emotionally fragile Ordinary High-School Student, and one of the first game’s survivors, Toko Fukawa, the Ultimate Writing Prodigy who is a Sour Outside, Sad Inside loner but is stronger than Komaru.
-   _Fate/Grand Order_:
    -   Mary Read & Anne Bonney are a pair of Servants that share a single Spirit Origin and therefore are summoned as a duo and are almost inseparable. This pirate duo will always fight together and die together and their Noble Phantasm is a combination attack. The two also frequently flirt with their Master (especially Anne) and are very into the idea of a threesome. They also hate the same type of men. While the two have basically the same likes and dislikes, the two are differentiated by their appearance and personalities: Mary is short, flat and a Bokukko and Tomboy whereas Anne is a Statuesque Stunner with huge boobs and acts very feminine.
    -   In the "Saber Wars II" event, Space Ishtar and Calamity Jane have this dynamic, being a pair of space bounty hunters that aren't so dissimilar to the _Dirty Pair_ above. Unusual for this trope, they are joined by The Protagonist and Mysterious Heroine X in the second chapter of the story and the team stays as a quartet for the rest of it, with the bounty hunter duo and X-san forming a trio of Action Girls. That said, the team is made of two different parties that share a common goal, and the story focuses more on SpIshtar and Jane due to them being new Servants that haven't been seen before. Unlike other pairings, there's a huge age gap between the two. SpIshtar is still a teenager and is noted to be physically younger than Ishtar and Ereshkigal, whereas Jane has been around since ancient times.
    -   Ax-Crazy Genki Girl Mysterious Heroine X (simply X-san) and Kuudere Mysterious Heroine X Alter (simply Ecchan) used to be this trope when they were still in their academy, but they eventually went separate ways after Ecchan recovered her memories.
-   _Fear Effect_ with Hana Tsu-Vachel and Rain Qin, who are the Tomboy and Girly Girl, respectively. There is a strong implication that they are lovers, and other sources indicate that both of them are attracted to men as well.
-   Crystal and Madison in the Sega Genesis game _Trouble Shooter_.
-   Claire Redfield and Moira Burton end up becoming this in _Resident Evil: Revelations 2_.
-   Chun-Li and Cammy White have a scene like this in the intro for _Super Street Fighter IV_, then fully embrace the trope in _Street Fighter X Tekken_. They're preceeded by Juni and Juli in _Street Fighter Alpha_.
-   _Touhou Eiyashou ~ Imperishable Night_ has the option of playing as four teams of these: Reimu and Yukari, Marisa and Alice, Sakuya and Remilia, and Youmu and Yuyuko.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Danger Zone One_ Reena and Madison are officers with the Pallad City Police Department. Both have been paired up, despite being polar opposites.
-   _Last Res0rt_ has Jigsaw and Daisy as the only girl-girl team on the show so far. There are plenty of other characters they share the spotlight with though.
-   Freija and Rachel for a girl-girl partnership in _The Senkari_, especially in the first story arc. Later they tend to share screentime more with other characters.
-   Vriska and Terezi, the Scourge Sisters from _Homestuck_.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Nanase and Ellen engage in this sort of thing.
-   In _Agents of the Realm_, Adele and Norah fight the bleeds together during their first two missions before their group morphs into Amazon Brigade.
-   _Star Mares_ splits up its unwieldy cast into two-pony teams starting in volume 2: Wind Whistler and Moontear, Cookiecutter and Spring Clean, and Gracenote and Maple Leaf. Bonus points for a cameo appearance from the actual Lovely Angels.
-   Magical Girls Undine and Heartful Punch have become this over the course of _Sleepless Domain_. The two are a Tomboy and Girly Girl pair, with HP handling the hands on brawling and Undine handling range and support. After a few nights working together, and Undine training with HP to become stronger, Heartful Punch offers to become an unofficial fighting duo with Undine. This is remarkable as before this point Heartful Punch was well-known In-Universe for preferring to fight solo.

    Web Original 

-   This trope is spoofed in the webseries _3Way_, with _Ladycops_, an homage to creator Nancylee Myatt's unaired show _Nikki & Nora_. The characters in _Ladycops_ are played by the same actresses from the _Nikki & Nora_ pilot.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Legend of Korra_ gives off this vibe with Korra and Asami in Book 3, who have more missions together apart from the other members of their team.
-   _Totally Spies!_ invokes the Power Trio version of this trope.
    -   As do Taffy, Dee Dee and Brenda of _Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels_.
-   Pre-teen version with the _Codename: Kids Next Door_ episode "Operation: M.U.N.C.H.I.E.S.", the only story to focus solely on Numbuhs Three and Five.
