Some accessories might be outdated, but not the dress.

_Ever since I was a little boy  
Dressing up has always been my greatest joy  
But when it's time to be discreet  
There's one thing you just can't beat  
And that's a strapless backless classical little black dress._

The Little Black Dress (or LBD for short) is a simple, (usually) short black dress, with little to no trimming or decoration. Expect very few frills, ruffles, or sequins. It's also most often sleeveless, strapless, has spaghetti straps, cap sleeves, or a halter-style top. The effect is to make an impression of a grand, yet simple style, that could fit the fashion in any decade since the early 20th century.

This dress was created during The Roaring '20s when fashion was in a big upheaval compared with the decades before. Coco Chanel came up with a dress that would work in an evening or formal occasion, and blend in through any decade since.

An anecdote on where Chanel found inspiration on the dress is that while she was looking at her maid, she observed upon the simplicity of the uniform and tweaked it by removing the apron and the lace trimmings, leaving only the black part of the dress. In reality, Mme. Chanel, and fellow couturier Jean Patou<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , after seeing women wearing black mourning dresses during and after World War One, transformed them into livelier and classier outfits that could be worn for multiple occasions.

This versatility and ability to work with any shot made the dress immensely popular with Hollywood costume designers, which spread the dress's popularity around the world.

Despite how it seems, this isn't really the opposite of a Pimped-Out Dress (and may rarely even overlap with each Happy Holidays Dress). It's just the pimping out is rare, to a lesser degree, and still done in a way that makes the dress last.

But not every style of this dress is guaranteed to last. Many such dresses (stereotypically from The '80s) are more likely to be an Outdated Outfit.

Also, while it's true that the first thing that comes in mind for the dress is the one worn by Audrey Hepburn in _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ (as the page image above), do **NOT** mention it as a Chanel creation made in 1926, like most fashion articles do. Though the concept of the Little Black Dress is Chanel's, the specific one Hepburn wore was created by Hubert de Givenchy in 1961.

-   Nicci of the _Sword of Truth_ wears one of these all the time. It's symbolic of her unfeelingness and becomes associated with her being "Death's Mistress".
