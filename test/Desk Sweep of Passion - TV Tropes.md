Clearing off space in one mighty sweep so you can make love on top of the desk in an office.

Desks are convenient flat surfaces for office liaisons, or at least they would be if they weren't so cluttered up with office supplies, paperwork, food, etc. So... sweep it all off in one dramatic move! That'll please your paramour and turn them on, right?

This move is titillating because Making Love in All the Wrong Places is so damn sexy. Doing it in a semi-public place and the idea that the couple might be seen or caught... that makes it even hotter and more thrilling. It also implies that the loved one is so hot that the character who does the sweeping can't control himself/herself. They're so turned on and so eager that they simply _must_ have their lover, now, consequences be damned.

Usually, it's a direct prelude to Professionals Do It on Desks unless a Moment Killer interrupts. This trope appears mostly in sitcoms and work coms, and it's Played for Laughs more often than not.
