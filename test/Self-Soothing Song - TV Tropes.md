A character sings to themselves while something distressing or traumatizing is happening to them, in an attempt to calm themselves.

Thing is, music _does_ help people relax and may help them manage pain better. Thus it's understandable why someone would do this.

The song is usually something comforting to the character. They could attach it to a good memory, (especially one from their childhood). It could also be a song that their mother or caretaker used to sing to them when they were little, also in an attempt to calm them down or make them go to sleep.

They might sing this song in a Troubled Fetal Position and/or while rocking back and forth.

The song in question may be a well-known one, particularly if it is in the Public Domain.

Could be a Bravado Song. May overlap with Ironic Nursery Tune. Compare Melancholy Musical Number and Songs of Solace.
