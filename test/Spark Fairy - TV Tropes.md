Hey, look!

Often in fiction, fairy creatures, fireflies, or other magical insects get depicted as simple little points of light rather than going for a full design for something so tiny we'll never get a good look at it.

The obvious inspiration is fireflies. It's funny how fireflies often end up behaving in unusual and rather magical ways. In a way, it's an example of the connection between light and magic.

Do not confuse with By the Lights of Their Eyes; this trope is about Energy Beings or Faceless Masses that may or may not sparkle. See also Will-o'-the-Wisp (point of light that leads unwary travelers into danger) and Hitodama Light (floating flame that represents ghosts). Contrast Ball of Light Transformation.

    Anime & Manga 

-   This trope actually becomes motive for _murder_ in _Furuhata Ninzaburou_ — a very eccentric editor decides to change the lime-green points of light to _red_ points of light for the hell of it. The original artist flipped out and bashed the editor's head in. (Art is Serious Business.)

    Comic Book 

-   _The Kane Chronicles_: In the graphic novel of _The Red Pyramid_ a Flashback of Bast is shown with her battling Apophis. In the flashback, Bast is portrayed with little detail and is mostly a humanoid green glow.

    Fan Works 

-   _Homecoming, 2026_: A Virtual Assistant created by a character is modeled after Navi from _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_, and is described as "a ball of light with wings".
    
    As additional students and visitors wandered through the culinary laboratory, a ball of light with wings flickered into existence over the shoulder of one of the school's shide students. The Virtual Assistant flitted in front of its master and began speaking. "Hey! Listen!"  
    "What is it, Navi?" Came the expected response.
    
-   _Shattered Skies: The Morning Lights_: The mysterious Lighthouse Keeper, Fantine, uses a spark of light with blue, feathered wings as a holographic avatar.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_: The "pyreflies" are depicted this way, more or less. They're visibly insects up close, but for the most part, they're depicted as flying points of light.
-   _Pinocchio_: The Blue Fairy first appears as a bright light that looks like a star before taking the form of a beautiful woman. She departs in the same way.
-   _The Princess and the Frog_: The scenes with Ray's family have _both_ detailed fireflies in the foreground and points of light in the background. Because the stars look like fireflies that are just further away, one of the fireflies has tragically (and ironically) fallen in love with a star.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_: When Mothra is hovering above the oil rig that is the Monarch base called _Castle Bravo_, her body is glowing so brightly that aside from her wings no other features can be made out.
-   _It's a Wonderful Life_: The ghosts/angels in the opening are seen as celestial bodies that flicker when they speak.
-   _A Midsummer Night's Dream_: In the 1999 film version, the fairy characters have this form at the beginning of the movie, when they arrive, and at the end, when they leave.
-   _TRON_: Bit is the personification of an on-off bit. It's basically a Disney sidekick fairy in Cyberspace.

    Literature 

-   _The Dresden Files_: Harry summons a tiny glowing pixie named Elidee to serve as a guide in _Summer Knight_. She has a body, but you have to look very closely.
-   _The Stormlight Archive_: Some of the smaller spren are described as this, such as lifespren (small green sparks) and rotspren (tiny red points of light).

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: In "Fear, Itself", Willow summons a fairy like this to guide her out of the haunted house. However, the spell is warped by the demon haunting the place and her own lack of focus, leading to her being chased around by a swarm of little floating lights.
-   _Doctor Who_:

-   "The Empty Child"/"The Doctor Dances": The nanogenes are floating pinpricks of light, much larger than "nanogenes" would imply.
-   "In the Forest of the Night": The entities controlling the trees look like this when the Doctor temporarily increases the local gravity to make them visible.

-   _Merlin (2008)_: The Sidhe look like blue points of light, but due to Merlin's magic powers, we get some lovely FX shots of them in all their scary magical glory.

-   _Supernatural_: The fairy is shown on screen as a ball of golden light, albeit a fast-moving Pintsized Powerhouse one that can hit as hard as a grown man. When you get a closer look, though...
    
    **Dean:** _\[squinting\]_ ...Nipples?
    

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Fraggle Rock_: The Ditzies are tiny luminous Energy Beings who are the source of all light in Fraggle Rock. They depend on music to keep them alive.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Lantern archons, the lowest rank of archons in most cosmologies, resemble floating, featureless spheres of light.
-   _Pathfinder_: The Lantern King, one of the Eldest who rule the fey of the First World, takes the form of a ball of golden light crowned by floating arcane symbols.

    Theatre 

-   _Peter Pan (1904)_: Tinkerbell and adaptations is commonly depicted as a glowing ball of light (dragonfly wings optional), based on the original medium using a small light reflected from a mirror and a tinkling bell.

    Video Games 

-   _Animal Crossing_: All the games have fireflies shown as points of light until you catch one of them.
-   _Black & White_: Gods like the player character manifest as large balls of light with their symbol floating inside. Your own cursor appears as a hand that physically interacts with the world, but other gods show no sign of a physical body.
-   _Child of Light_ has Igniculus, a newborn firefly with the appearance of a glowing blue raindrop. He is later revealed to be an elemental, and there are others like him.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_: Most "realistic" games from _Ocarina of Time_ onward depict fairies as a ball of glowing light with butterfly wings, as opposed to the "cartoony" games such as _The Wind Waker_, where fairies are the usual fully humanoid figures. While this was originally done because of the N64's engine limitations, their appearance seems to have become literal at some point, as the fairies still appear as balls of light in the mangas and higher-end console games. Often, "ball" and "human" fairies appear side by the side, with the former being common fairies that act as healing items and the latter being the more powerful Great Fairies who act as NPCs. _The Minish Cap_ and _Hyrule Warriors_ have the fairies transforming between the two forms, implying this may be a case of A Form You Are Comfortable With.
-   _Lost Ember_: The wolf's companion is a ball of red light that used to be a human spirit but has since lost his human form after forgetting who he was in life.
-   _Mega Man Zero:_ The Cyber-Elves have different appearances and forms, but in gameplay, they all look like flying sparks of light.
-   _Nox_: A magical spell summons a small swarm of fairies that circle Jack until an enemy approaches, at which point they go kamikaze on the enemy. The fairies never appear as anything more than yellow sparks.
-   _Quest for Glory_: The fairies in the first game are little balls of light of various colors. The ones in the fourth game, however, are far more detailed.
-   _Rayman_: The Lums are literal spark fairies, in the sense that they're actual balls of light with faces and small wings.
-   _Spirit of the North_: The guardian of the Northern Lights, a translucent fox, is reduced to a point of light after lending her powers to the player fox in order to heal it.
-   _Stonekeep_: Fairies can apparently switch between spark-fairy mode and detailed mode.
-   _Terraria_ uses this look for both insects (fireflies and lightning bugs) and actual fairies (both the hostile kind that will attack you and the kind you can summon to produce light). Insects only appear this way when present in the world though, as they get a more detailed sprite in your inventory.
-   _Uru_: Flying points of light (presumably insects) are an important plot element in one Are. They're attracted to your character but dislike crossing water or getting rained on.

    Web Animation 

-   _Dreamscape_: Eleenin can separate into a horde of these for defense. If they are destroyed, she instantly appears in a flash of light.
