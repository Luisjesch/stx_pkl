_"It's a praying mantis. Do you know how they mate? The male will sneak up on the female and she'll bite off his head and the rest of his body will keep on mating and when they're done... She'll eat him. She'll eat the rest of him."_

Mantises (Order _Mantodea_) are a widely known group of predatory insect species with a very distinctive and iconic look. One of the bigger pop-cultural Animal Stereotypes about them is the females' propensity to eat the males after intercourse, making them the insect equivalent of a Literal Maneater. This stereotype is so well-known it's become common fodder for fictional references to mantids. Often it's Played for Laughs as the punchline to a joke. For whatever reason the male is usually portrayed as totally fine with this.

The trope has _some_ basis in reality, but while female mantises are known to sometimes eat their mates, it is a lot rarer in real life than advertised. In fact, as much as 70% of the time the female does not eat the male (although this can vary wildly from species to species). Sexual cannibalism also occurs far more often in captivity than in the wild, typically because of variables that disturb the usual mating process such as the female not having been fed properly by the mantises' human keepers and the enclosed environment making it harder for the male to evade the female. On top of that, pop culture tends to claim that she eats her mate _after_ the mating when in reality it typically happens beforehand—typically a rejection of an unwanted suitor—and occasionally during the act. In fact, many mantis species are cannibalistic in general, males included; females just tend to be larger and thus more likely to feed on males than vice versa. Post-copulation devouring is in fact the _least_ likely scenario and a male that successfully completes the breeding process is more than likely going to live to breed another day.

Non-mantis-related examples should go on Conceive and Kill.

Subtrope of Conceive and Kill, Stock Animal Diet, and Somewhere, an Entomologist Is Crying. See Out with a Bang for other types of sex-related deaths. May overlap with Furry Reminder or Literal Maneater. See also Black Widow, which is named after another animal famous for the female eating the male.
