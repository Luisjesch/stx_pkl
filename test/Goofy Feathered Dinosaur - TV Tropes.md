_"\[Scientists\], stop ruining everyone's fun when it comes to dinosaurs! I've never met a dinosaur that a scientist hasn't tried to ruin;_ Jurassic Park _comes out and everyone's enjoying the T. rex and the velociraptors, but then Johnny Scientist jumps up and goes, "Um, actually, we did a little bit more science, and we've learned that velociraptors were 2' tall and feathered and could be trained to fetch slippers. Also, the T. rex was more of a scavenger than a hunter, and all the other dinosaurs used to bully it and knock its schoolbooks out of its tiny, pathetic arms."_

For more than a century, dinosaurs were seen as reptilian animals and were often treated as little more than giant, hulking monsters, especially in fiction. Within the last few decades, researchers have re-evaluated these ideas. Newer research has revealed that dinosaurs were overall much more like birds than lizards— in fact, birds are themselves considered to be very specialized dinosaurs based on mountains of evidence available in the fossil record, with a line being drawn to distinguish "avian dinosaurs" (birds) from "non-avian dinosaurs" (classical prehistoric dinosaurs).

This, however... hasn't gone well with the mainstream media. People like their big, scary, roaring and sulking lizard creatures, even if the actual animals were anything but hulking monsters (in fact, most dinosaurs are and were small). Even many dinosaur enthusiasts (many who grew up on media such as _Jurassic Park_, despite the film depicting dinosaurs as warm-blooded bird-like animals according to newer theories, even if it was still inaccurate at the time) are averse to the idea. Dinosaurs in media still tend to be based on older reconstructions, either because the artists didn't care enough to make them accurate, because they didn't know better, or because they simply don't like the contemporary reconstructions.

Feathered dinosaurs were hit hard with this stigma.

The idea of feathered dinosaurs tends to be mocked and scoffed at in media. Contrary to common belief, not _all_ dinosaurs are theorized to have had feathers— just many theropods (almost all of them being coelurosaurs) and a few of the smaller ornithischians.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  It's also perfectly possible for dinosaurs to have had _both_ scales and feathers<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . However, the popular view of feathered dinosaurs is a giant fluffy dinosaur with brightly coloured feathers. _Tyrannosaurus rex_ has received most of the brunt of this issue. Due to its popularity, it's the poster-child for feathered dinosaurs, albeit highly misguidedly: paleontologists aren't quite sure whether they were fully feathered or not (or even if it _had_ feathers), but the mainstream image is that tyrannosauruses are now "cute and cuddly". Feathered dinosaurs bring to mind fowl like chickens and ducks, rather than the equally-feathered-but-frightening modern-day raptors or extinct terror birds.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Large ratites such as ostriches, emus, and especially cassowaries, also feathered-but-frightening, tend to be ignored in the subject of feathered dinosaurs as well (and the fact that ostriches themselves are not taken so seriously in media doesn't help), despite being the closest things to living prehistoric dinosaurs, not to mention many dinosaurs resembling them such as _Ornithomimus_, _Struthiomimus_ (whose name literally means "ostrich mimic"), and _Gallimimus_.

Adding to this is that a piece of media that _does_ want to get the science right and isn't afraid to give its dinosaurs feathers is also likely to try to depict them as the animals they were, rather than the monsters and dragons as which they've historically been depicted. For people who prefered the "cooler" monstrous versions, the feathers became symbolic of the perceived "softening" of dinosaurs.

As a consequence of the above, feathered dinosaurs in media tend to be joke characters; they're goofy looking and often goofy acting, particularly making failed attempts at flying which frequently happens with _Archaeopteryx_, arguably the most famous of all feathered dinosaurs.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  A major exception to this rule is the dromaeosaurs, a.k.a. raptors, which _definitely_ had feathers due to fossil evidence (with the biggest kicker being the discovery of a tail preserved in amber, feathers and all) helped by the group being very closely related to birds. This may be because raptors are almost always portrayed as small, screeching Lightning Bruisers as a counteract to the "giant, roaring brutes" image— in fact, they were the very dinosaurs to break that stereotype and revive the bird-dinosaur connection theory (with the discovery of the raptor _Deinonychus_ whose skeletal structure was nearly identical to that of _Archaeopteryx_). Feathered dromaeosaurs in media will usually be more exotic or bizarre-looking than goofy, but even then, they won't be taken as "seriously" as the classic scaly version. The short version is that feathered dinosaurs are typically only actually unintimidating because they're deliberately made to be so by people who don't like the idea of it; a real encounter with a fully-feathered _Tyrannosaurus rex_ would be just as terrifying as with a scaly one because it's still a gigantic apex predator. If you still need some modern day perspective to this, just watch the climax of _A Bug's Life_ and ask yourself if those cute feathers made the baby birds any less terrifying when Hopper got fed to them.

The reluctance to feature feathered dinosaurs is sometimes attributed to budget—feathers are expected to be blown around by wind and the motion of the animal or "expand" like a bird's wing in flight, meaning that they need to in visual media as well or else invite the Uncanny Valley, whereas a scaly or otherwise hairless animal doesn't typically have this requirement. However, given CGI birds have been done many times even with a low budget, this may actually be due to ignorance or lack of experience on part of the animators. Feathers tend to lay flat against the body even in wind or motion, especially on birds-of-prey, thus the issue of animating feathered animals is resolved by having the feathers sculpted as part of the model and kept as textures, with only the more prominent feathers like on the wings and tail being rendered. Picture this, a predatory dinosaur with a smooth or sleek-looking coat of feathers like on an eagle would not invoke the same uncanny effect as one with all of its feathers sticking out like frazzled hair, not to mention would be easy on the budget.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

In Japanese media, however, feathered dinosaurs are more common and less likely to be depicted as goofy, with a feathered _T. rex_ being just as much of a threat as a scaly one. This may be due to Japan's emphasis on compulsory biology education for children, which results in more familiarity with modern scientific concepts. The growth of the internet has also led to increased acceptance of the idea, to the point of complaining about the _lack of_ feathers on certain dinosaurs, though not without a good amount of people still joking about the _T. rex_ looking like a massive chicken (though making even the big, hulking lizard version cute and cuddly is also not unheard of). This dislike towards non-feathered depictions has also started to grow among Western dinosaur fans in recent years, and paleoartists in general. This has reached the point where many artists have depicted almost _every_ dinosaur as having feathers, including sauropods (which most likely didn't have feathers) and ornithischians (which only has three specimens with quill-like feathers). So far, the only dinosaurs that are confirmed to have _true_ feathers were the coelurosaurs.

It should be pointed out that the idea of feathered dinosaurs is not in fact as recent as many are led to believe. While definite evidence of feathers on dinosaur fossils (and broad acceptance of the idea in the paleontological community) is indeed _relatively_ recent, well-supported speculation of feathers on certain dinosaurs is almost as old as the basic hypothesis of a bird-dinosaur evolutionary connection from the 1800s. Even without smoking gun evidence found in the late 1980s, paleontologists had been almost certain some dinosaurs had feathers and rendered them with such as far back as the 1970s, while speculative fiction writers were toying with the idea as early as 1908.

As people get more used to the idea of feathered dinosaurs, however, with the influx of more accurate Dinosaur Media in The New '20s such as _Prehistoric Kingdom_, _Prehistoric Planet_, _Jurassic World Dominion_, and _Dinosaur Sanctuary_, this trope does seem to be in decline.

Naturally, a subtrope of Artistic License – Paleontology. Contrast Feathered Fiend. Compare Basilisk and Cockatrice and Feathered Dragons, which are usually not seen as goofy.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  See also Creepy Hairless Animal, for when the absence of fur or feathers makes an animal scarier. See Doofy Dodo and Quacking Up for subtropes applied to _avian_ dinosaurs.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the Viz Media manga _Dinosaur Hour!_, two _Protoceratops_ learn about the concept of a feathered _Velociraptor_ and try to add plumage to a drawing of a raptor in the most ridiculous way possible. As for the real feathered _Velociraptor_ itself, it is overly fluffy and resembles a cartoonish duckling. That doesn't stop them from viciously attacking the _Protoceratops_.
-   _Dinosaur Sanctuary_ defies this trope and then some by undermining the scariness of featherless dinosaurs. In the first chapter, Suzume tries to comfort a schoolgirl who is scared by Yuki, Enoshima Dinoland's female _Giganotosaurus_ (a featherless theropod), by explaining that dinosaurs are not all scary, pointing out that birds are also dinosaurs. One schoolboy then makes a dig at her statement by insisting dinosaurs are big and scary, much more so than birds, and expects Yuki to eat a whole deer carcass that's currently being fed to her. He is dismayed when the _Giganotosaurus_ initially hesitates in eating the carcass, due to being unfamiliar with it as she's usually fed meat with the bones and hair removed, proving Suzume's point that even big dinosaurs are not always scary.

    Comic Books 

-   In Issue 21 of _Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur_, one of Moon Girl's taunts to her Alternate Universe counterpart Devil Girl is that Devil Dinosaur's counterpart Moon Dinosaur has more feathers than Big Bird. Moon Dinosaur himself is an aversion, however, as he is just as fierce as Devil Dinosaur.

    Comic Strips 

-   Paul Gilligan draws _Pooch Café_, wherein one strip has Boomer mention to Poncho that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Poncho envisions a _T. rex_ with ridiculously small wings defecating on a car... and crushing it. Poncho agrees that the notion is difficult to believe.

    Films — Animation 

-   The only feathered dinosaurs in _The Good Dinosaur_ are the raptors going after the _T. rex_'s herd. Although fearsome, they are depicted as goofy rednecks, with their feathered crests resembling mullets. Unlike most examples, though, it's their _lack_ of feathers that highlights their goofiness— their bodies look plucked and scrawny, giving them a "dumb hillbilly" look.
-   _Ice Age_:
    -   _Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs_ had a goofy-looking _Archaeopteryx_ which falls victim to Black Comedy. Averted by the _Guanlong_ in the same film, who are depicted as threatening (though their feathers are really more like quills).
    -   _Ice Age: Collision Course_ has a trio of feathered, _flying_ dromaeosaurids as the main antagonists. They appear to be somewhat smarter than the scaly dinosaurs seen in _Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs_, as they talk fluent English, but they're also goofier and less monstrous.
-   _The Land Before Time_ does this with Guido the _Microraptor_ from the 12th movie, who is a nervous and awkward Plucky Comic Relief; the goofy Yellow Bellies (_Beipiaosaurus_) from the 13th movie, who are scaredy cat comic relief types; and the neurotic and panicky _Nothronychus_ Wild Arms from the 14th movie. The 14th movie, however, also averts this with the menacing _Yutyrannus_ (granted, they're _far_ more scantily-feathered than the real thing).

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Hatchling_ plays this straight with Ralph, a baby _Deinocheirus_, but averts this with the adult _Deinocheirus_, which are shown in a regal light.
-   The _Jurassic Park_ franchise has historically had a complicated relationship with this trope.
    -   The male _Velociraptors_ in _Jurassic Park III_, the _Indominus rex_ in _Jurassic World_, and the _Indoraptor_ in _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_ all have small crests of quill-like proto-feathers, but are mostly scaly, presumably to make sure they still look threatening.
    -   In the first film, a kid at fossil dig comments on Grant's assertion that birds are descended from dinosaurs with "That doesn't sound very scary! More like a six-foot turkey!" but Grant goes on to lay out why a real _Velociraptor_ would be anything but a joke. This might be considered an aversion, were it not for the fact that the movie's raptors are themselves featherless.
    -   The lack of feathers on the "modern" dinosaurs is ultimately justified, via retcon, as being a result of the genetic engineering that created them in the first place and they can only be made viable thanks to a "null gene;" coincidentally, this causes them to lack feathers. The real reason is because the dinosaurs didn't have feathers in the first film — long before the idea of feathered dinosaurs was widely accepted even as their relationship to birds was directly acknowledged in-universe — and so it wouldn't make sense in-universe for them to suddenly have them without explanation, _especially_ in the case of the _Tyrannosaurus_ that appears in _Jurassic World_, which is explicitly the original tyrannosaur from the first film rather than a newly-cloned specimen.
    -   Defied with the _Pyroraptor_ and _Therizinosaurus_ in _Jurassic World Dominion_ — both are given decent feathered coats, but they are also treated as legitimate threats. Special mention goes to the _Therizinosaurus_, which is one of the most aggressive animals in the franchise—it delivers a One-Hit Kill to a deer in its territory just for being there, and soon after is clarified as an herbivore to anyone unfamiliar with it in the audience.
    -   Played With by the _Moros_ — while it has a sparse coat of feathers and most of its scenes are goofy and lighthearted, one in the Biosyn sanctuary is shown viciously killing and eating a jerboa, making it a sort of Killer Rabbit. Of course, this was in a very small enclosure and was clearly meant to be like feeding a live mouse to a pet snake, rather than the piranha-like behavior exhibited by the _Compsognathus_ elsewhere in the franchise.

    Literature 

-   Defied in the fourth _Dinotopia_ book, _Journey to Chandara_, where feathered dinosaurs appear for the first time in the series and are treated with a sense of wonder as much as the scaly dinosaurs.
-   Defied in _Primitive War_. A majority of carnivorous dinosaurs in the books are feathered, and many of them are terrifying. The _Utahraptor_, _Tyrannosaurus_, and _Yutyrannus_ are notable examples.
-   _The Monster of Partridge Creek_ is a Weird West short story published in 1908 in which a living _Ceratosaurus_ is found roaming through the Yukon Territory. Presumably as an adaptation to the cold environment, the creature has developed a shaggy coat, which does not make it any less threatening. This story is the oldest known fictional portrayal of a feathered dinosaur, and possibly even the oldest portrayal of non-avian dinosaurs surviving into the present day.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Prehistoric Planet_:
    -   Averted with most of the feathered dinosaurs. The troodontids are shown as agile and cunning hunters using arson hunting like firehawks, the _Nanuqsaurus_ are portrayed like Fantastic Fauna Counterparts of gray wolves hunting _Pachyrhinosaurus_ in the snow, the _Qianzhousaurus_ is a nimble and ferocious woodland predator, while its _Corythoraptor_ prey are fast and wary (if strange-looking) animals, and the _Velociraptor_s are shown as elegant and fierce predators hunting on cliffs like snow leopards.
    -   Played straight, however, with the _Deinocheirus_, portrayed as a shaggy, moose-like swamp-dweller that comically scratches its back on trees and poops onscreen as a bit of Toilet Humor, and with the fluffy baby _Tyrannosaurus_, who play-fight, romp around and curiously explore their environment like a bunch of theropod kittens. The adult _rex_es are given very sparse feathers, as well, and portrayed with all the dignity you'd expect for a full-grown _T. rex_.
    -   Played straight-ish with the trio of fluffy _Therizinosaurus_ chicks, whose clumsy attempts to reach a beehive to get at the honey are played for laughs... but averted with the equally-feathery adult _Therizinosaurus_, which is portrayed as a creature of majesty and awe.
    -   Downplayed with the _Mononykus_. Her hunt for insects is portrayed comically due to being unfamiliar with the wet season environment - David Attenborough even gives a sympathetic "Oh dear" at her antics. But the creature's appearance is more cute than goofy, being more or less a toothy mix of barn owl, roadrunner, and anteater. Her introductory scene also emphasizes her keen survival abilities, as she uses her sharp hearing to pinpoint the location of termites inside a log, and then scoops them up with her long tongue.
    -   Some of the series' more overtly comical moments do have dinosaurs showing the behaviour of modern-day birds, though not necessarily the physiology, from a bachelor herd of feathery _Ornithomimus_ making nests to impress females to a scaly _Carnotaurus_ acting like a gigantic bowerbird and keeping a well-tended glade in the woods and doing a mating dance. However, the scenes - being based on actual animal behaviour - play more as a good-hearted chuckle than outright mockery. Part of the ethos of the series is that dinosaurs were animals, not monsters, and real animals are somewhat goofy sometimes, and if that ruins dinosaurs for you, that's your problem.
    -   Played utterly straight, however, in some of the reactions to the show. Notably, British newspaper _The Sun_ ran an article complaining about the "softer 'woke' version of T-Rex<small>◊</small>".

    Magazines 

-   A _Muse Magazine_ dinosaur issue featured a _Kokopelli & Company_ comic featuring Koko showing off various feathered theropods. Among them a feathered _T. rex_ that clucked like a chicken.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Zigzagged in _Magic: The Gathering_, usually based on what year a given plane was designed.
    -   Averted with the dinosaurs of Dominaria. The primary setting of Magic's first decade—created in the early 1990s—the rarely seen dinosaurs are large and saurian in the style of _Jurassic Park._
    -   Muraganda debuted in 2007. Appearing on just four cards as of 2023, one of them depicts an enormous reptilian dinosaur, much like those found on Dominaria.
    -   Defied with Ixalan's dinosaurs, first shown off in 2017. The dinosaurs on this plane are depicted with feathers, but are portrayed as dangerous predators in the wild and noble mounts and symbols of the powerful Sun Empire. They are, however, mostly depicted as larger than humans by the time they reach adulthood.
-   Defied in _Pathfinder_, where a few of the dinosaurs (and pterosaurs) are given feathers, but still look like legitimately threatening and cool creatures.

    Video Games 

-   Defied with the feathered dinosaurs in _ARK: Survival Evolved_, most of which are portrayed as Feathered Fiends. _Yutyrannus_ in particular is The Dreaded, and _Deinonychus_ is almost purposely-built to be a boss-killer due to its attributes for attacking large prey. Played for laughs in this piece of the _Yutyrannus_ made for April Fools' Day.
-   In _Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem_, Tweety and Road Runner's prehistoric counterparts, Tweetysaurus Rex and Roadius Runnerus, are both dinosaurs covered in feathers. While they are fearsome fighters, they are as goofy-looking as their modern counterparts.
-   _Marsupilami: Hoobadventure_ features feathered raptors and _T. rex_ in the "Hidden World" DLC, though the latter is a background animal. While they are fierce, they look pretty goofy thanks to the game's cartoon art style.
-   _Paleo Pines_: _Gallimimus_ are appropriately feathered, and they sprint so quickly that it causes the player riding them to comically lean backwards. The Dinopedia even points out how cute they look when they run.
-   Mostly averted in _Pokémon_, which has three feathered dinosaur-based Pokémon families: the Archen line<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the Tyrunt line, and the -zolt line. All of them are pretty cool, both in and out of universe. It's played straighter by Arctozolt and Dracozolt, Mix-and-Match Critters that are respectively half-dromaeosaur/half-stegosaur and half-plesiosaur, and look deliberately ridiculous (it's _heavily_ implied that they are botched reconstructions). An even bigger aversion is a few prehistoric Paradox Pokémon you can find in _Pokémon Scarlet_, which are dinosaurian/draconic with feathers but are vicious, as mentioned in their discomforting Pokédex entries, and _will_ attack you on sight in the overworld.
-   Implied in both _Zoo Tycoon_ games. In the first game, the _Caudipteryx_ is the only feathered dinosaur and the only one that doesn't require reinforced fencing for its exhibit which makes it the most harmless animal of the dinosaur expansion pack. In the second game, the _Velociraptor_ (which played the Raptor Attack trope straight in the original) is more accurately depicted as chicken-sized and feathered making it a 1-star animal which is harmless alongside peacocks and gazelles. In contrast, larger dinosaurs which lack feathers (including the _Utahraptor_, aside from a mohawk crest on the males' heads) are much more prone to and capable of escaping their enclosures and wreaking havoc in the zoo.

    Web Animation 

-   _Dinosaurs: Terrible Lizards_ features a sparsely-feathered _Tyrannosaurus_ that is an extremely inept predator. To be fair, all the dinosaurs in the series are equally goofy.
-   King Rexxtopher from _Mighty Magiswords_ is a rare case of a feathered _T. rex_. It fits the overall wacky tone of the show.

    Web Comics 

-   _Addictive Science_: When Celia learns that dinosaurs are still around in the magical universe she gets hold of some velociraptor DNA, inserts it into her Transformation Ray, and uses it on herself. Only to discover, to her horror, that's she's now covered in feathers.
-   _Dinosaur Comics_ has an overlay that modified the characters to have feathers, although not in a way that’s any more scientifically accurate than the rest of the comic.
-   _Girl Genius_: Treylawney Thorpe encounters one, courtesy of Dina. The "completely accurate dinosauria" would be more accurate on a farm than in the Jurassic.
-   In _Manly Guys Doing Manly Things_, the trained velociraptors are chubby-cheeked, tropical-coloured, fluffy, coo like pigeons, and friendly. Justified in that it was a side effect of the genetic engineering and breeding that made them trainable, while the unmodified velociraptors had sleeker plumage and nastier tempers — the genes that made them friendly and trainable were also the ones that made them fluffy and cute.
-   Defied in one _Sandra and Woo_ strip where Sandra expresses her frustration at _Velociraptor_ being depicted _without_ feathers. The feathered _Velociraptor_ model in the comic is portrayed very realistically.
-   _Schlock Mercenary:_ Somewhat applies, in that the dinosaurs are significantly less threatening than anyone remembers now that they know they were intelligent enough to get past the Medieval age before having to be rescued from the comet by a passing precursor worldship. Even the _T. rex_ turns out to have become a domesticated hunting animal more adorable than terrifying, although still looking magnificent.
-   _xkcd_ has many, many comics pushing back against the supposed goofiness of feathered dinosaurs. One suggests that anyone who finds them unthreatening has never fought an ostrich; another imagines a world where aliens are similarly disappointed to find out that humans weren't "cooler" and cling to wildly inaccurate understandings of our physiology. A third has a parent teasing their child for the modern depictions of raptors, but upon the child informing them of the gruesome modern theory of how raptors hunted ends up equally engrossed in dinosaur books.
-   Conversational Troping in _Dumbing of Age_. Dina considers Walky's statement that "My view on feathered dinosaurs is dependent on dinosaurs being _awesome monsters_ and not just friggin' _giant chickens_" to possibly be worse than Joyce's Bible literalism on the subject.

    Web Videos 

-   Defied by _TREY the Explainer_. He goes with whatever the scientific research suggests but he is especially fond of feathered dinosaurs. He has several videos discussing them.
-   Frequently discussed on _Two Best Friends Play_. Any time the topic of dinosaurs came up in their Seinfeldian Conversations, at least one of them would rant about how scaly dinosaurs are so much cooler and scarier than feathered ones — and they would also insult fans who, in the past, tried to convince them otherwise. Of the crew, Matt seemed to feel particularly strongly about the issue. And if they're playing a game with actual dinosaurs in it, expect them to say something along the lines of "Look, this game has dinosaurs the way they _should_ be — with no feathers!" This is clarified in Episode 192 of the _Super Best Friend Cast_ as being Kayfabe. Pat explains that they _do_ believe the new discoveries, they just prefer the old, scaly versions in an aesthetic sense.
-   YouTuber HoopsAndDinoMan made a video called "The Allure of Modern Dinosaur Artwork" deconstructing this trope, speculating on why some people had such a strong negative reaction to the idea of feathered dinosaurs, pointing out that the _Jurassic Park_\-style dinosaurs they preferred were _also_ considered heretical when first proposed, and defending the modern vision of dinosaurs having feathers and other soft tissue - though he admits that one day, this model too may become outdated, and that's okay.

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_: In the episode "The Wondercabinet", Steve experiences an astral projection and decides to use it to see dinosaurs. He is somewhat disappointed to see that many of them had feathers, including a feathered _T. rex_ that roared and clucked.
-   _Darkwing Duck_: In the episode "Jurassic Jumble", Darkwing gets hit with Dr. Fossil's Devolution Device and is transformed into a dinosaur, one that is covered in feathers. Despite being large and powerful in this new form, Darkwing still remains as comical as ever, and not only does Fossil ridicule his form upon sight, but actually came close to defeating him had Stegmutt, Gosalyn, and Honker not interfered. Interestingly, this was before feathered dinosaurs became official by science.
-   _Gigantosaurus_ has Archie the _Archaeopteryx_, who is the prominent feathered dinosaur in the cast. He also has an awkward personality and is always on the receiving end of slapstick humor. Season 3 introduces Missy, an eccentric _Incisivosaurus_. Ironically, the raptors Cror and Totor are also depicted as goofy, but they are stereotypically featherless.
-   Munro Ferguson directed _How Dinosaurs Learned To Fly_ for the National Film Board of Canada. It's a six minute cartoon about a rotund dinosaur named Dip that amuses himself by jumping off cliffs. Though the sensation while falling approximates flying, the sudden stop at the end dulls Dip's enjoyment. However, Dip developed feathers (and lost weight) until he could fly. Some of his fellow dinosaurs developed similarly, spawning the myriad variety of birds we see today.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: Zig-Zagged in the episode "Last Train to Bustville". Dr. Doofenshmirtz plans to revive a dodo due to thinking they are dinosaur-like creatures (because they are extinct like dinosaurs) and imagines a large feathered dinosaur rampaging across Danville. He is disappointed when he finds out dodos are flightless turkey-like birds<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , but then he gets attacked by the dodo he resurrected.
-   _Primal_: "Slave of the Scorpion" features a Goofy-_Acting_ Feathered Dinosaur in the form of an _Anzu_ that acts like a chicken, makes comical flamingo-like honking vocalizations, and is easily killed. Unlike most instances of this trope, the _Anzu_ is amazingly anatomically-accurate with realistic feathering. However, the episode averts this with the fuzzy _Kulindadromeus_ which, while harmless, behave realistically and come across as cute.
-   _Sesame Street_: Played for Laughs in the _Bert and Ernie's Great Adventures_ segment, "Invent the Wheel". Cavemen versions of Bert and Ernie and their pet sauropod get chased by a "Ticklesaurus", a theropod that has what appear to be feathers on its head and back, which befit its tickling nature. The trio treat it as a terrifying creature, only out of not wanting to be tickled.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   "Forgive and Forget" has a new version of Truckasaurus designed with feathers "in conformance with the latest paleontological theories about dinosaurs". The crowd ends up hating it and destroying it.
    -   Subverted in "Days of Future Future", where some (partially-)feathered raptors tear apart a live goat fed to them during a show.
-   _Wander over Yonder_ somewhat downplays this with Sylvia. She's an alien resembling a feathered dinosaur, but is the tough, no-nonsense Cloudcuckoolander's Minder to her goofy partner, Wander.
