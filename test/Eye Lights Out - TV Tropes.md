Optimus was like a nightlight for children across the world.... one that just burned out. Again.

Whenever a being, mechanical, magical or meaty, has Glowing Eyes of Doom (or just glowing eyes, Doom Sold Separately) these will flicker and fade out whenever they die. Much like a candle guttering on the last of its wick, death can turn off the literal light in someone's eyes. If the being also has natural Power Crystals in their body (or as the eyes themselves), these too will fade out.

The standard justification for having glowing eyes in the first place is that these eyes are not detecting by ambient light, so the death of the owner also terminates whatever biological, mystical, or electronic process makes them light up. It probably has more to do with the Rule of Cool.

Speaking of, since most beings capable of lighting up their peepers aren't human, you can expect that if one is Not Quite Dead they won't just have their eyes open, but blaze brightly.

Related to No Ontological Inertia, and when objects that the person has linked to their Life Energy (which also glows) fades out or breaks at their death. Glowing Mechanical Eyes are a prerequesite for the robotic version. Not at all related to By the Lights of Their Eyes. Nor when you See the Whites of Their Eyes. Compare Volcanic Veins, where the veins stop glowing once the character dies.

**This is a death trope. Spoilers ahoy.**

    Anime and Manga 

-   Both times Kuma dies in _Afro Samurai_ (once in the first series, once in _Resurrection_), his one cyborg eye goes offline.
-   _Code Geass_: When C.C. shoots Mao, the Geass sigil in his eyes can be seen dimming.
-   After Cell crushes Android #16's head in _Dragon Ball Z_, a piece of circuitry with a bright green light falls out, and slowly dims to black, signaling that he is irreparably dead.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, whenever Alphonse's soul is "unconscious", or being pulled over to the Gate, his eye-lights go out.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_:
    -   The 0 Gundam does this after it is impaled on Exia's GN Sword in the finale of complete with the entire mobile suit going limp before it explodes.
    -   In the first season, the entire face mask on Howard Mason's flag goes dark when it is turned into a pin cushion by the Throne Zwei's GN Fangs.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_:
    -   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_'s Unit 01. Its eyes tend go out when it runs out of power or the pilot's synchronization is interrupted by something. Although if the pilot's in sufficiently deep shit, it's probably going to get right back up with the eyes lighting up again. Especially noticeable in _End of Evangelion_ when Unit 01 simply turns off while hovering in mid-air to represent that Shinji hitting his Despair Event Horizon resulted in him losing his chance of fighting back for good.
    -   _Rebuild of Evangelion_ does it a little differently. When Unit 01 runs out of power, the green parts of its armor fade out along with the eye. Makes sense as the armor is the only part that actually requires power. Similarly, while the dummy plug-controlled Unit 01 is strangling Unit 03, Unit 03's eyes are shown flickering before Unit 01 breaks its neck with sheer strength. Right before Unit 01 punches Unit 03's head so hard it explodes, Unit 03's face is shown once again with the eye still flickering but much dimmer.

-   In _Pokémon: The Series_, Staryu and Starmie's cores blink and stop glowing when they're KOed.
-   Downplayed variation in _Transformers: Cybertron_ - a similar effect indicates unconsciousness in a Transformer (which is actually very serious in a series where visible armour damage and/or visible short circuits indicate significant damage, and many attacks are successful but have no visible effect).

    Films — Animated 

-   In the film version of _The Last Unicorn_, King Haggard at first sees a forest-scape in Lady Amalthea's eyes. After a while in her human form, this image fades to the normal human reflection, hinting at the death of the unicorn inside.

-   Optimus Prime in the 1986 _Transformers: The Movie_ has his eyes go from glowing blue to black when he dies
-   _Wall E's_ EVE's eyes turn off when she's in sleep mode, leaving her face a black screen, and AUTO's single red eye goes off when he's deactivated.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _2001: A Space Odyssey_, the single glowing red light that represents HAL 9000 turns off when he's deactivated for good.
-   B.OB from _The Black Hole_, does a different version where the 'lid' of his Tin-Can Robot closes over his eyes. It might have been played straight originally, as the eyes were meant to be computer screen, but they couldn't get them to work during filming, so the robots had fake cartoon eyes attached, as if put there by the designers to make them look more personable.
-   _C.H.U.D._: The eyes of the C.H.U.D.s stops glowing when they get killed.
-   _Godzilla_:
    -   Kiryu's (AKA Mechagodzilla 3) eyes stop glowing in _Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S._ after he sinks into the bottom of the ocean with Godzilla during a Heroic Sacrifice.
    -   Similarly in _Godzilla (1998)_ when the mutant lizard is finally felled there is one last shot of its eye as it slowly dims and closes to the sound of falling rain.
    -   In _Godzilla (2014)_, when the male Muto dies, we get a close up on his eyes to emphasize with this trope that he is dead.

-   _The Matrix_. After Trinity removes the Agents' bug from Neo's body, it returns to its mini-robot form, which has a small red light. After she drops it out of the car, it falls to the ground and its red light goes out.
-   Spoofed in _Scary Movie 3_. A woman is hit by a car and ends with the engine block through her body. When she dies, the car's lights go out.
-   _Star Wars_
    -   _The Empire Strikes Back_: C-3P0's eyes go out when he's blasted apart by the stormtrooper. Notably, after Chewbacca repairs Threepio, his lights were still out, and he complained about not being able to see. When Chewie fixes that, they come on again.
    -   _Rogue One_: Happens when K-2SO finally collapses after being blasted several dozen times by stormtroopers in the process of holding them off to protect Jyn and Cassian.
-   _Terminator_:
    -   _The Terminator_: The sign that the Terminator is finally destroyed after it is crushed in a hydraulic press is its red eyes going out.
    -   In _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_, when the Terminator suffers its Disney Death we see a close-up of its exposed mechanical eye going out, but in its next scene, there's a faint, pulsing glow in the eye, as it reboots and activates its back-up power source. When it dies for real we see it from the point-of-view of said eyes as they shut off.
    -   In _Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines_, the T-850's blink off at the very end of the movie following his Heroic Sacrifice to save John and Kate, and as the nukes fly and Judgment Day begins.
-   Several times in the Transformers Film Series. _Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen_ in particular has a gut-wrenching repeat of Optimus' eyes fading out. We know he'll come back, but you can't help but feel your gut clench when Mecha Jesus dies protecting a human.

    Literature 

-   Golems in _Discworld_ have glowing eyes that go out when they're inactive.
-   Marvin in _So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish,_ after reading God's Final Message To His Creation:
    
    The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever.
    
-   The short story _Ieia_ features a deity trapped in a statue, with glowing amber eyes as the only sign of life. The statue's owner, who doesn't believe in the supernatural, thinks she's imagining the glow. When the deity proves its existence in the course of committing a Heroic Sacrifice, the owner is so overcome with reverence that she barely notices the eyes have gone dim.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   In _The Thrawn Trilogy_, the glow in Grand Admiral Thrawn's eyes go out right after his Final Speech.
    -   Subverted by Ton Phanan in the _X-Wing Series_. Even after he dies, his mechanical eye is still powered and glows redly, and Face finds himself wondering what it's seeing.
-   When Ba'alzamon in _The Wheel of Time_ dies, the flames that constantly come out of his eyes (and mouth) go out... leaving burnt out sockets (and mouth) behind.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _BattleBots_'s 2018 competition, Kraken has a pair of eyes with bright lights within them. Appropriately, when it suffered a mechanical failure in its debut battle, the lights started to flicker and dim, then went out completely as the referee did the knockout countdown.
-   The Centurions in _Battlestar Galactica_. Not only do they have the Cyber Cyclops roaming red eye, but it goes out when the 'bot is destroyed.

-   A strange variant happens with the Goa'uld in _Stargate SG-1_. Since their eyes aren't _always_ glowing, and only do so when they choose, they don't fade when they die like in most cases of this trope. Instead, the eyes flash once and then fade before they die, accompanied by the special Goa'uld eye-flash sound effect.
    -   There's a particularly good example of this in "Double Jeopardy", when Teal'C's robot duplicate shoots Cronus in the back several times with a staff weapon - his eyes flash in time with the energy blasts hitting them, then light up one last time and slowly fade as he expires.
    -   The genetically-engineered Goa'uld Kull Warriors wear full-body armor, including helmets with blue lights over the eyes. When the warrior dies, the lights fade out. (The armor seems to sense the brain activity of the wearer, to know when they want to fire their weapons or when they die.)
-   A slight variation in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. Data and his identical brother Lore have amber irises. In Lore's final episode when Data deactivates him for good his pupils shrink until they disappear, leaving his eyes blank and sightless.
-   _Supernatural_
    -   In the episode episode "What Is And What Should Never Be", the djinn's glowing blue eyes fade before he collapses dead.
    -   In a variation in "All Hell Breaks Loose Part Two", when the Yellow-Eyed Demon is killed the yellow fades from his hosts eyes, leaving the normal eyes of his dead host.
-   Happens to the robot in the pilot episode of _The Tick (2001)_ immediately before he says "Gravity Is a Harsh Mistress".
-   _Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger_ The Movie: Volger's eye lights go out when he's defeated... then he gets back up.
-   _Ultra Series_
    -   Many of the series' kaiju have their eyes go dark after being defeated, sometimes with their eyes shutting, sometimes without.
    -   Jirass, after Ultraman kills him with a punch to the gut. He falls to the floor after bleeding profusely from the mouth, and then his eyes dim.
    -   Ultraman after Zetton defeated him. In fact, as he begun to pass out, his eyes actually flashed in tune with the blinking of his colour timer, then went out simultaneously when his colour timer stopped blinking.
    -   Ultraseven after his crucifixion at the hands of the Guts aliens.
    -   Ultraman Jack after Alien Knackle crucified _him_.
    -   Ultraman Ace after he gets tag-teamed by Doragory and Metron Jr.

-   _Bright Eyes_, a song by Simon & Garfunkel for the 1978 film version of _Watership Down_ includes the lyrics:
    
    _Bright eyes,_
    
    _Burning like fire._
    
    _Bright eyes,_
    
    _How can you close and fail?_
    
    _How can the light that burned so bright_
    
    _Suddenly burn so pale?_
    

    Theme Parks 

-   In the final scene of _Transformers: The Ride_ at the Universal Studios parks, Megatron is shown dying after his body briefly sparks, and then his red eyes go out.

    Video Games 

-   In _Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon_, the trope is averted during normal gameplay. You can examine AC wrecks and notice that they're still emitting lights. However, the trope is played straight in several cutscenes.
    -   A downplayed example after the boss fight against IB-01 CEL 240, 621 is ambushed by V.II Snail with Stun Needle. As the AC slumps down from the paralysis, you can see that the lights are fading out, prompting the capture and re-education by Arquebus.
    -   Played straight for dramatic effects on all the three endings' bosses to signify their demise.
        -   In "Liberator of Rubicon" ending, after you defeat Walter's IB-C03 HAL 826, he charges his Coral Rifle and aims at 621, only to relent, and the camera cuts from explosions of Xylem to HAL's head part to show his lights fading out.
        -   A more solemn example in "Fires of Raven" ending, where you're presented with the remains of Ayre's IB-07 SOL 644, with the camera cuts to the head part to focus on Ayre's fading lights.
        -   In "Alecta Iacta Est" ending, with the IB-07 SOL 644 destroyed and ALLMIND uttering its last words, Ayre ensures that they'll pull the trigger themselves, and the scene cuts to ALLMIND's slumping head, complete with the green lights going out.
-   The Big Daddies in _BioShock_ exhibit this, their visors shutting off once they die.
-   _Breed_ features humans going to war against the "Breed", a hostile alien race who seems entirely mechanical, with glowing blue eyes and assorted glowing electronic appendages attached to their body. When killed, not only does the Breed's eyes goes out, but also every component on them.

-   _Mass Effect_
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_, shortly before the Collector General's death, the light in its eyes go out as Harbinger releases control.
    -   In the first game, if you pay careful attention to geth corpses (that weren't incinerated, frozen, melted, or turned into clouds of ionized gas) you'll find that after about ten seconds, their flashbulb heads begin to dim and eventually go out. It also happens to Saren, showing just how far he's been implanted with Reaper tech. Shortly afterwards the eyes light back up as Sovereign takes control of his corpse.
    -   Geth eyelights don't seem to switch off automatically. In _Mass Effect 3_ Legion's lights continue to glow when he's dead, at least while the camera is on him. The sinister red glow of a Reaper's firing chamber _does_ go out, though.
-   Raiden's visor does this in _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_. But it later turns out he's Not Quite Dead.
-   _Metroid_

    -   _Metroid Dread_ has this happen to Samus at the end of the game when Raven Beak is choking her to death. When Samus's body gives out, the light from her visor fades. The light quickly returns however when Samus's Metroid powers kick into overdrive.
-   In the intro for _Mortal Kombat: Deception_, Quan Chi and Shang Tsung "defeat" Raiden, whose eyes lose their glow shortly afterwards. He recovers soon after in time to take on the new Big Bad, Onaga.

-   _Undertale_.
    -   Used for Rule of Symbolism While Sans's eye lights going out doesn't signify his literal death, it does accompany the moments where, as some players have put it, "Sans stops being Sans."
    -   Also used when Mettaton's power runs out at the end of his fight. Alphys even sort of mentions it, stating "...Thank GOD, it's just the batteries."
-   In _Warcraft III_, after Grom kills Mannoroth, he collapses, and his red eyes stop glowing.
