Please don't list this on a work's page as a trope.  
Examples can go on the work's YMMV tab.

_"Crying is cleansing. There's a reason for tears, happiness or sadness."_

Some viewers are impassive when it comes to what they watch. They've seen it all. No fictional death, sacrifice, emotional display or confession can move them.

Except these.

Since most of these involve death scenes, shocking twists, or something just as major, expect **many** unmarked spoilers. However, they can also be as simple as the right imagery, tone, and music coming together - for the sole purpose of working those tear-ducts.

This being one of the YMMV items, one person's Tear Jerker may be another's Narm, which is often a failed attempt to induce this. Comments such as "If you didn't cry at \_\_\_\_\_, you have no soul" are **not** welcome here; since this is defined by emotional reaction, what causes someone to burst into tears may cause another to shrug or even laugh, and guilt-tripping people just because they don't experience the emotions you want them to is not cool, dude.

Many Downer Endings and Bittersweet Endings include tearjerking moments. Either way, make sure to bring the Kleenex. If you want to avoid them altogether, then you might want to consider heeding that Snicket Warning Label.

Some tear-jerking moments, especially of deaths, can wind up being horrifying or traumatizing as well. Compare Harsher in Hindsight, which may be a Tear Jerker in and of itself. Contrast Heartwarming Moments, which can induce tears for more positive reasons, although they can overlap.

Tear Jerker is No Real Life Examples, Please! and examples for real events reported in documentaries or other non-fiction works aren't normally permitted. Examples for docudramas and historical fiction are allowed, but must focus on things as they're presented within the work, not the real events they adapt.
