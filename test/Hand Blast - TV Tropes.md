Yes it is.

**Nick Fury:** Okay, your turn. Prove you're not a Skrull.  
**Carol Danvers:** _\[destroys jukebox using her energy blast\]_  
**Nick:** And how is that supposed to prove to me you're not a Skrull?  
**Carol:** That's a Photon Blast.  
**Nick:** And?  
**Carol:** A Skrull can't do that.

Hand Blasts are a stock superpower where the character shoots blasts of energy as a projectile out of their hands, palms, wrists, fingertips or fists. "Energy" and "Projectile" in this case are broad terms, and can encompass nearly anything: a heat ray, laser bolts, concussive force, whatever. The subject simply points his hand (or finger) at a target, and a Bright Ray O' Doom shines forth. Sometimes it requires activating with the other hand.

Differs from Ki Manipulation and Kamehame Hadoken in that the Hand Blasts are not tied in to the subject's Life Energy or Mana (though they can overlap); the Power Source is usually external or some other form of Applied Phlebotinum. Many instances of this trope imply that anyone can fire the blasts if they simply had the right equipment or circumstance.

May overlap with Arm Cannon if the entire arm/hand is weaponized.

Subtrope of Energy Weapon. See also Breath Weapon, Eye Beams, Full-Contact Magic, Head Blast and Psi Blast.

If this is specifically through the palms, see also Power Palms.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Digimon_:
    -   A recurring example across multiple series is Leomon's Signature Move, Fist of the Beast King, which fires a lion-shaped projectile from his fist.
    -   _Digimon Adventure_ has Angemon, with his Hand of Fate attack, which fires a beam from his fist.
    -   In _Digimon Frontier_, Agunimon's Pyro Punch, despite the name, has him create large fireballs around his hands and launch them. There's also IceLeomon, who uses an icy version of Leomon's Signature Move called Frozen Fury. Finally, Lucemon is able to fire blasts of concussive force this way, though the attack goes uncalled and unnamed.
    -   In _Digimon Adventure tri._, Alphamon is able to fire blasts of green energy from his hands. In _Digimon X-Evolution_, Alphamon instead creates a magic circle in front of his outstretched hand and fires a Beam Spam from that.
    -   _Digimon Adventure: (2020)_ brings back Angemon's Hand of Fate and also gives us Goddramon's God Flame, a blast of holy fire from both fists.
-   Amagiri of _Darker than Black_ has the power to shoot concussive force from his hands.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
    -   Androids 16, 17, and 18 had this.
    -   Frieza's iconic Death Beam comes from his fingertips.
-   _Gundam_:
    -   The Zeong from _Mobile Suit Gundam_ has particle beam cannons in its fingertips. Bonus points in that the forearms can detach, becoming Attack Drones.
    -   _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam_'s Psyco Gundam, (Mk 1 & 2) feature fingertip-mounted particle beam cannons.
    -   The Destiny Gundam from _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_ has palm-mounted, short-range beam cannons, but because its pilot uses them to perform Facepalm Of Doom attacks 99 times out of 100 a lot of fans don't even realize they're meant to be ranged weapons.
-   The clones of the lead girls in _Kiddy Grade_ have this as their main attack.
-   _Mazinger Z_: In one of the first episodes, Mazinger-Z shot missiles from its fingertips. This weapon was quickly ignored for obvious reasons.
    -   _Great Mazinger_: Great Mazinger's Thunder Break. The Humongous Mecha gathered lightning bolts from the atmosphere and blasted its enemy with it. Tetsuya came up with a bunch of variations: Great Mazinger shot a continued stream of electricity from its forefingers, launched lightning bolts from its open palms -or fingertips-, powered up its sword with it...
    -   _UFO Robo Grendizer_: Grendizer's backhands shot energy beams.
-   As mentioned in the Mazinger Z example above, Gunbuster also shoots missiles from its fingertips... _**NUCLEAR ONES**_!
-   In _One Piece_, Franky and The Pacifistas can do this with laser beams. The beams themselves are rather thin but cause huge explosions, as opposed to the traditional "Huge energy wave". Interestingly, Kizaru- the marine admiral whose light powers their lasers were based on- never actually uses his powers in this manner; he prefers to extend his leg as if to kick and then releases the beam from his leg.
    -   Subverted with Absalom. They're really just BFGs strapped to his arms and made invisible using his powers to invoke the image of this trope.
    -   When Rayleigh first demonstrated a Haki strike on a wild beast, he did it as a Hand Blast rather than the usual darkening of the fist. Later on it's revealed that this is an advanced form of Armament Haki, where not only Haki is used to cover one's body as an armor, but it is also delivered _into_ the enemy body and destroying them from the inside out.
-   _Photon_: Photon's flighty sister Aun can launch a stasis field from her fingers (or her mouth if she's panicking). She fires one off to freeze Photon's sand cart, causing him to topple off into a canyon. Keyne Aqua can shoot zap balls from her palm, but only if she's wearing an aho bracelet on that wrist. She fires off five of these at Photon, whom she'd found in her bed when she awoke.

-   From _Sailor Moon_, Sailor Venus' "Crescent Beam" emanates from her fingertip.

    -   _Thanos_: Thanos can fire powerful energy blasts from his fists. This is revealed to be a potential ability for all of Earth's Eternals (Thanos's parents were exiled Eternals) but most haven't got the same aptitude for it. It's left unclear whether or not it's also been enhanced by his various modifications and resurrections.
-   _The DCU_:

    Fan Works 

-   _Boldores and Boomsticks_: After Shade tries to teach Blake Shadow Ball by handing her one, her next attempt to use her Semblance results in Dark Pulse shooting from her hand.
-   In _Child of the Storm_, this is Tony's standard form of attack, through his repulsors.
    -   Loki also tends towards it.
    -   And until he really gets the hang of his telekinesis, it's Harry's primary default, too - usually along the lines of Kill It with Fire. It varies from 'take out an Elite Mook' to, when briefly aged up, 'blow up half a mountain with a _small_ blast that's visible from thirty miles away'.
-   In _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_, while Paul tries several times to use his Hand Blast, he can never get it to work, since it's likely a Psychoactive Power and only works when he's furious. Also, he knows he has no aiming skills and refuses to even try to use it when one of the others could be hit or he could set something on fire.
    -   Also, Spectrem has at least three different kinds of Hand Blasts, all of which are entirely ineffective against Paul (except to make him feel good).
-   In _With Strings Attached_, while super-strong, Actual Pacifist Paul is freaking out and struggling not to go berserk on the Hunter's ass for slaughtering a bunch of wolves, his fingernails begin to glow as he clenches his fists, growing brighter and brighter. Eventually he has to swing around and let all that energy loose into the swamp to avoid cooking the Hunter. He had no idea he could do that; nor does he want to, and he has a Heroic BSoD over nearly killing the Hunter. Later, when they're fighting wraiths and it turns out they're transparent to physical attacks, the Hunter apologizes for not warning Paul in advance and assuming he would use his energy beams to attack them. Paul responds by looking at his fingernails and admitting he'd forgotten he could do that.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Transformers (2007)_, Ironhide whips out two huge cannons from his forearms. In fact, almost every projectile weapon used by the robots are like this, produced from their own arms and directly connected to their body.
    -   More of a Shapeshifter Weapon. Ironhide's BFG's were mounted on his forearms, while the rest either used handheld guns or the replaced their hands with guns. By Dark of the Moon, almost everyone is using a handheld gun.
-   Done in _Star Wars_ by two entire lines of CIS Battle Droids.
-   The ABC Warrior robot in _Judge Dredd_ was armed with machineguns built into its hands. Cue the slaughter of faceless judges.

    **Pepper:** I thought you weren't making any more weapons?  
    **Tony:** This is a flight stabilizer, it's perfectly harmless.  
    _\[activates the stabilizer, gets knocked back into the wall\]_  
    **Tony:** ... I didn't expect that.
    
-   The Mighty Strobe in _The Specials_ has this. Amok has something similar, except their source is more random, due to a slight case of power incontinence, meaning they can sometimes come out his dick.
-   The protagonist in _Pandorum_ puts on a wrist-mounted concussion gun designed to stun people. However, he's warned from the get-go that it's deadly at close range, which he demonstrates later by liquefying some mutant's head. The use of the weapon aboard a spaceship is justified, since bullets can either pierce the hull or ricochet.
-   _Captain Marvel (2019)_: One of Carol Danvers's abilities is to shoot photon blasts from her arms. She uses this to prove that she's not a shapeshifting Skrull... which does nothing to assuage Fury's worries, because he has no idea what Skrulls can or cannot do.
-   One of the many New Powers as the Plot Demands that the Kryptonians had in _Superman II_ as if heat vision Eye Beams weren't enough.
-   In the opening scene of _Tetsuo II: Body Hammer_, a drunken salaryman staggers home when he notices Yatsu pretending to shoot him with his finger. He blows it off until a couple of holes are blown out of him mere seconds later.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Appointment with F.E.A.R._: The Energy Blast is one of the four available superpowers you can start off with, where you're given the ability to fire a powerful beam of pure energy from your hands. It's Cast from Hit Points, however - you lose two life points every time you use it, and because of your character's Thou Shall Not Kill (humans) nature, you can only use your hand blasts for stunning supervillains (at one point however you're given the option to use this on a Threatening Shark; since you're fighting an animal, your blast turns the shark into Ludicrous Gibs).

    Literature 

-   The Cobra cyborg warriors in Timothy Zahn's _The Cobra Trilogy_ have a laser built into each hand.

-   In _Auf zwei Planeten_ ("On Two Planets, 1897) by Kurd Laßwitz, Martian Repulsite cannons project a kind of cone-shaped particle beam which functions like a Iron Man's repulsor rays, but on a larger scale. They can be used e. g. to stop projectiles shot at yourself or to create artificial tidal waves.
-   Both Blaze and War Hammer of _Superheroes Anonymous_ can fire blasts of fire from their hands. They generally choose not to because said fire is the one thing that bypasses their defenses.
-   In _Super Powereds_, Michael fires cold blasts from his fists. It helps that his preferred fighting style is boxing.
-   _Reign of the Seven Spellblades_: To an attentive mage, fourth-year Vera Miligan's bangs hairstyle is an obvious clue that there's something off about her left eye: it's the eye of a basilisk, with a paralyzing gaze. It's also misdirection to conceal the fact that she has a second basilisk eye embedded in the palm of her left hand.

-   The Skrills in _Earth: Final Conflict_ are bio-engineered weapons designed to meld into the wielder's forearm and interface with the CVI in the brain. They produce a powerful energy blast that works equally well against organic beings, Energy Beings (like Taelons), and inanimate objects. Additionally, the Shaqarava is an organ present in a number of races (as well as Liam Kincaid) that allows one to project or absorb energy with the palms (strangely, Shaqarava is also a figure from Taelon mythology who destroys Umrath'ma the Liar).
-   _Time Trax_ has an episode featuring Human Aliens called Procardians (and this is the only episode in the entire series even mentioning aliens). In lieu of our fight-or-flight, Procardians, when threatened, produce a powerful hand blast that can send a human into a coma. Things turn ugly, when two hunters happen upon the crash-landing site of a Procardian teen. He instinctively blasts one of the hunters, when he aims a rifle at him. This starts a Torches and Pitchforks hunt in the nearby town.

Barry forces Cisco to remove the beams afterwards, despite their incredible usefulness against anyone without Kilg%re's abilities.
-   Played with in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: Geordi was interfaced with a remote-controlled probe, and to himself (and to the audience) it looked like he was walking around with his legs and picking up objects with his hands. In reality, that was an illusion, and it was just the probe using tractor beams. The probe was armed, and did fire a phaser blast at one point; when this happened, it looked to Geordi and to the audience like the beam came from Geordi's palm. But obviously the probe didn't have a hand to fire it from per se.

    Tabletop Games

Apparently it's technically not a handball if you don't directly touch the ball with either hand, or maybe Rule of Cool just takes precedence over the other rules.

-   _Danny Phantom_. While not really a thing ghosts usually do, Danny can fire ectoplasmic blasts or "Ghost Rays" from his hands.

    Real Life 

-   The Pistol Shrimp uses this attack as a hunting weapon: it can snap its claw shut so fast that the cavitation bubble generated can incapacitate or kill a small fish up to 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) away. This is more impressive than it might sound given that most species of pistol shrimp only grow to be between 3-5 cm long.
    -   This power is shared by a few other shrimp species, including the Internet-famous mantis shrimp. Onetwothree DEATH!
