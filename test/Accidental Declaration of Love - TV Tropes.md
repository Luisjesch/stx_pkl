And you should not blame me too

If I can't help falling in love with you!

_\* blushes and covers her mouth \*_

They may be friends or colleagues but Alice and Bob care for each other, maybe each in their own way. Everyone can see it but may be thinking if they will go through with it or not, or otherwise there is not much between them to begin with. They can't be together because of different problems like family, other partners, or other circumstances.

It might happen when they're alone together, after having a drink, or engaged in some mundane occupation. Suddenly, one tells the other how they feel. Be it through direct words or subtle gestures, perhaps spurred by an unexpected revelation or heartfelt surge of emotions. This trope comes into effect.

Mistaken Declaration of Love overlaps, but there, the recipient of it is the wrong one. And like it, can be an important plot point of many Romantic Comedy bits as characters get some Character Development in order to feel or realize they have the emotional backing that makes it a hard secret to keep, especially for longer spanning story arcs.

Conversely, if a character declares this too early/late in a relationship and it misfires, or doesn't land properly, it may be reason enough for more Character Development.

If this is averted long enough it may lead to the plain old Love Confession territory — because it would be this, inverted and/or not accidental. Or, even extremes as Anguished Declaration of Love. After all, the audience may expect one of them to happen.

Because Characterization Marches On this may appear early on Foreshadowing later developments as Rule of Romantic. The "I Love You" Stigma can overlap if, for instance, there is no narrative parity between characters involved. If later, expect it to be the point of having Traveling at the Speed of Plot.

Characters will often do this in situations as odd as Twice Shy or otherwise pressed from Cannot Spit It Out. May come across as a Freudian Slip — of the emotionally charged kind and in a purely romantic sense.

It might endure Verbal Backspace or Immediate Self-Contradiction if Played With at a basic level. As well as being the single intelligible thing out from the mouth of a character that does Gibberish of Love.

For more means by which it can be accidental, it can involve eavesdropping, truth serum or inebriation, magic spells, that Noodle Incident with the Instant Messenger Pigeon...
