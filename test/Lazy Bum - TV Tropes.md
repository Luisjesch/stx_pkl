**Joe:** I could do a lot of things if it was necessary.  
**Queenie:** Then why don't you?  
**Joe:** It ain't necessary.

A Lazy Bum is very rare. Just ask anybody if they're lazy. They may be Brilliant, but Lazy, or Book Dumb, or shrewdly saving their energy, but they're not just plain lazy. They work hard, really, or at least they could if it was worth the effort to do it, but they're not lazy. The only people who think they aren't working are their fascist bosses. Got it? In fact, if you asked these hard-working people about their co-workers, you'd realize that they're the only ones who do any work around here.

Of course, every now and then you get a Lazy Bum who is more self-aware. These tend to be Smug Snakes who think it's hilarious that other people bother to do work instead of just leeching. Then there are the ones who are _really_ self-aware, and almost philosophically devoted to being lazy. They scheme so hard at getting out of work that it's actually harder work than just doing the work. Usually their boss is a humorless Control Freak who is so annoying that we root for the worthless slacker instead.

A more metaphorical example of this trope would be moral laziness. Usually seen in villains, anti-heroes and anti-villains this type of laziness applies to those who "take the easy way out" in a psychological sense. Usually, this includes murder, being an Extreme Doormat, allowing oneself to be easily manipulated, lacking empathy toward others or just lacking the drive and willpower to say "no".

Then there are the ones who are supposed to be sympathetic, because they're just like you. These may be the most common type of all, and there's probably others, but it's too much work to write about them. No doubt Wiki Magic will take care of it.

Being a Lazy Bum — whether in the traditional sense or the metaphorical one of moral laziness — is also known as **Sloth**, which is one of the Seven Deadly Sins. Not to be confused with the South American mammal, which is named "sloth" because it sleeps a lot and moves very slowly even when it's awake. Compare The Slacker.

Subtropes include Ambitious, but Lazy, Beauty Breeds Laziness, Cats Are Lazy, Laid-Back Koala, Lazy Dragon, and Sluggish Seal. If someone's laziness gets someone harmed or killed, it is a case a Lethal Negligence.

## Examples:

    Anime & Manga 

-   Europa the Lazy from _Claymore_. In her Claymore days she was a single digit who might have been #1 if she tried harder and her special technique (all single digits at lest were apparently expected to come up with a unique fighting style) was Playing Possum. In her current Eldritch Abomination form she initially struggles against a being of similar power but vastly less experience, skill and intelligence before she bothers to get serious.
-   A defining trait for En Yufuin of _Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!_, who prefers to hang out at the hot spring rather than get anything done.
-   _Doraemon_: Nobita is a very lazy person who normally wakes up late for school, often dozes off in class, and naps almost every day after school, making him unable to sleep at night and wake up late the next morning. This creates an endless cycle of laziness.
-   Shizuo Heiwajima from _Durarara!!_, of all people, appears to be this. In his official character profile his only hobby is listed as "basking in the sun", and he tells Celty in his "Special Voice" on the character CD that he likes days where there's "just nothing to do".
-   _Ebisu-san and Hotei-san_: Played for Drama with Ebisu's sister. Her constant slacking off and neglect of her daughter is a heavy burden on Ebisu, and other characters call her out for her Jerkass behavior.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   The Homunculus Sloth. It's in his name, but if you get him going, he becomes a Lightning Bruiser. He represents wasted potential; he has immense physical strength and moves like lightning, yet is too lazy to develop the skill necessary and reach his full potential.
    -   Interestingly, _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_ double subverts this. Sloth is portrayed as a beautiful woman who can turn herself into water. In her human disguise as King Bradley's secretary she's a very hard worker, but when in combat, she appears to be rather lazy, as it's been shown at least once that she can actually turn her entire body into water and drown anyone and everyone around her, but she usually just uses a small amount of her power (usually in her arms) and kind of just stands there in one spot while trying to hit her target.
    -   Both Sloths are also morally lazy. Manga Sloth tends to use his Super-Strength to go through objects rather than around them, and commits crimes because he simply lacks the willpower and drive to say no. In his case it's justified as he's the literal embodiment of the sin he's named for. The 2003 anime's Sloth, in a similar vein, tries to take the easy way out, killing the Elric brothers rather than psychologically coming to terms with the fact that she is the reincarnation of their mother.
-   _Gakuen Babysitters_: Outside of the occasional moments where he shows insight or rare signs of actually being responsible, Usaida Yoshihito is like this almost all the time while on the job, sleeping whenever he gets the chance.
-   Lazy-Sensei from _Haré+Guu_, who enforces "siesta" time on his class purely to get himself more shut-eye. Nevermind that his students range in age from 9 to late teens, and are all past the need for naptimes.
-   _Himouto! Umaru-chan_: The titular Umaru is this in her Umaru-chan/UMR form; a lazy, selfish video game addict who only does chores when forced to. She hides this side of her from her friends and classmates, instead being the pretty, polite, good-at-everything Umaru.
-   _K-On!_: Before she joined the Light Music Club, Yui was part of the Going Home Club (AKA, she always went home after class). Her time was spent reading manga, eating snacks, and just lazing around while Ui took care of the house. She's gotten better since joining the club; she spends a lot of time practicing with Giita, but her laziness still shows from time to time.
-   _A Lazy Guy Woke Up as a Girl One Morning_ naturally has the title character, Yasuda. He's not all that bothered by inexplicably turning into a girl one morning, since he thinks it would be too much work to find a way to turn back, but hates all the work he has to do to adjust. For example, he insists on continuing to stay with his roommate Hayasaka in the boys' dorms and use the boys' bathrooms, claiming that because he's a boy at heart. His actual reason is that it'd be a hassle to move, and he probably couldn't mooch off his new roommate as much as he does off Hayasaka.
-   Ryner Lute from _The Legend of the Legendary Heroes_, who much prefers taking afternoon naps to fighting evil.
-   _My Hero Academia_: Downplayed with Shota Aizawa. He can be a force to be reckoned with in battle and is a competent, if extremely stern, teacher, but he is also well known for handing off his class to another teacher and going to sleep in his sleeping bag instead of spending time on subjects he thinks are irrelevant.
-   _One Piece:_ The very first thing we learn about Admiral Ryokugyu is that he's such a fundamentally lazy man he finds _eating_ to be too much effort and doesn't bother. The fact he's still an admiral despite that and it's been _three years_ since he had a meal speaks volumes.
-   Genma Saotome of _Ranma ½_ is downplayed. In the series itself, he almost never bothers to do anything besides loaf around, eat, and play shogi, leaving his son to handle any problem that pops up. Even if Genma caused that problem in the first place. However, prior to the series, Genma willingly left his Supreme Chef wife and the comfort of his home to travel the highways and byways of Japan and China for over a decade, in order to help his son become a powerful martial artist, and in fact designed two schools of techniques (the Yamasenken and Umisenken) that are amongst the most powerful in the series, with near-perfect invisibility, vacuum blades that can cut through steel like runny butter, spine-snapping bearhugs, and more. He has also displayed mental sloth in regards teaching Ranma- for example, failing to read the Nekoken training scroll all the way through, or taking his son to Jusenkyo simply on the virtue that it sounded impressive, without bothering to find out _why_ it was called "The Valley of Cursed Springs".
-   _PandoraHearts_: Played with. Vincent Nightray. Often found asleep in hallways, rarely seems more than half awake, will never do for himself anything his servant Echo could possibly do instead, _including_ getting to a chair or bed before going to sleep, lacks the slightest empathy for anyone other than his brother Gilbert, and simply sits there waiting when death is coming for him, rather than even try to find a way out.
-   _Sailor Moon_: Usagi Tsukino would rather play video games and eat than study for tests. She even lampshades this when she's bewitched by Ramua in the 9th episode of Season 1.
    
    **Usagi**: I have a lot of things to accomplish today. First off, I have to get home. Then, eat a pork bun. After that, finish playing my video game, take a bath, and then — OHNO, LOOKWHATTIMEITISALREADY!
    
-   _Servamp_: Kuro is the living embodiment of this trope — unsurprisingly, as he's the vampire that represents Sloth. He'd rather spend his days eating ramen and potato chips and playing video games, but the world won't let him.
-   The titular character's shtick in _Tanaka-kun is Always Listless_. He's worse than a sloth most days, as imagining him doing something as strenuous as clinging to a tree is almost impossible. His close friend Ohta seems the main reason he seems to live a manageable every day life — it's to the point Ohta will sling him over his shoulder to make him go to the dentist when he needs to.
-   Played with in _Umineko: When They Cry_. Belphegor represents the sin of Sloth, but is a very hard worker. It's just that if she's the only one doing the work, it advances her vice. Still, when Rudolf tricks her into a Duel to the Death in the third arc, she doesn't notice that her master, Eva-Beatrice, is in the line of fire until she only has time to take the bullet (he apologizes to her, at least). As she puts it, _"I was lazy ?!"_

    Comic Books 

-   From _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_, Gladstone Gander. His perpetual good luck has given him a very warped set of morals, including such a disdain for work that he sees the one coin he made on one unlucky day where he _had_ to work as My Greatest Failure and hides it in a safe out of shame.
-   Lupo from _Minimonsters_, a narcoleptic werewolf and also a Big Eater.
-   Lazy Smurf from _The Smurfs_, both in the comic books and the cartoon show.
-   The titular character of Franco-Belgian Comic _Philémon_ spends his days idly wandering the countryside with his donkey Anatole, dodging his chores and dad.
-   Maya from Emilka Sza is a lazy, spoiled girl who mooches of her blind roomate and is to busy sleeping or chasing boys to pay her part of the rent.

    Comic Strips 

-   Wally from _Dilbert_ is also an example of Dismotivation, and one of the ones who puts more work into avoiding work than it would ever take to do the work itself. He was based off of a co-worker of Scott Adams's who was trying to get fired in a Springtime for Hitler situation.
-   Garfield, pictured above, embodies both sloth and gluttony. Case in point, in one strip he mounted a television to the ceiling so he could sleep and watch TV at the same time.
    
    **Jon**: Have you ever seen someone work so hard at being so lazy?  
    **Garfield**: And you say I never do anything around here.
    
-   Beetle Bailey's primary characteristic is his laziness; if you see him work hard at anything, it's usually a scheme for shirking work.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Avantasia Protag AU_ series, the demon Acedia is a recurring character. He is literally the embodiment of sloth and never manages to get anything truly evil done because he deems it too much work. He's only effective when manipulating his victims into harming themselves.
-   _Cutie Mark Crusaders 10k_: As a side effect of taking a dip in the Chaos pit, Rainbow Dash can't be bothered to do so much as lift a finger to help anyone unless they offer something of interest to her. She's content to just lie around, take naps, and eat snacks, though she's still capable of using Super-Speed to avoid people.
-   _Miraculous: The Phoenix Rises_ gives readers Maximillian, the father of Max and Haley who spends most of his time in bed watching a childish sitcom, even when at threat of being evicted.

    Films — Animation 

-   The hyenas in _The Lion King (1994)_, followed Scar supposedly because they wanted food. What that meant _in practice_ was 'forcing other carnivores to hunt food for them and having Scar beat them up if they object'. At no point do they do anything but sit around and wait for others to enable their survival. _In a wilderness._ How they're not already dead boggles the mind.
    
    **Banzai:** It's dinner time, and we ain't got no stinkin' entrees!
    
    -   _The Lion Guard_ spinoff confirms that the Outlands are perfectly capable of sustaining a hyena population- in fact, most hyenas feel very fond of the place. Shenzi and her gang were just lazy.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The lovable slackers from the works of Judd Apatow.
-   The Dude from _The Big Lebowski_.
    
    **The Cowboy:** "Even if he was a lazy man— and The Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest man in all of Los Angeles, which'd place him high in the runnin' for _laziest worldwide_."
    
-   See The Hobbit under "literature" for the slothful Smaug.
-   _The Disappointments Room_: David. At one point, he says that he plays Xbox and takes naps while he watches his wife Dana work, when he's asked what he does for a living.
-   Baloo in Disney's adaptations of _The Jungle Book (1967)_. His song "The Bare Necessities" is all about taking whatever life brings his way rather than working for it. Although there is wisdom in being content with what you have, he definitely takes it to the point of outright laziness. In the live-action version he's somewhat manipulative as well, getting Mowgli to work for him.
-   In _The Comedy of Terrors_, Trumbull would frequently have Gillie do all of the dirty work for him while he sits back and waits (usually in his bottle). This is illustrated when they try to break into Mr. Black's home to kill him, Trumbull verbally abusing Gillie for his lack of climbing skills despite almost being twice as tall as him. Trumbull could have easily scaled the wall himself, but couldn't not be bothered.
-   _Wild River:_ Hamilton and Cal Garth (and possibly Joe John, although he's absent during that conversation) are old enough to be great-uncles but openly admit that they don't do any work on the Garth farm and just mildly supervise the black farmhands, and have been that way since childhood. Knowing that the relocation would force them to get jobs causes them to resist for a while.
-   _Shoes_: Eva is supporting a family of six from her meager salary as a shopgirl, and she is so broke that she has to use cardboard to repair her crumbling shoes—and then the shoes and the cardboard get soaked in the rain. Her perfectly able-bodied father sits around the house all day reading books.
-   In _Santa Claus Conquers the Martians_, the annoying comic relief character Dropo is referred to as "the laziest man on Mars". His problem isn't really that he's lazy so much as it is that he hasn't found the right job for him.
-   Grimsdyke from _Doctor in the House (1954)_ is content to stay as a medical student for as long as possible as he continues to receive an allowance of £1,000 a year as long as he remains studying at St. Swithin's. Unluckily for him, Stella is having none of this and wants to marry a proper doctor:
    
    **Grimsdyke**: But do you realise what this means? I shall have to qualify.
    
    **Stella**: Yes.
    
    **Grimsdyke**: Well, if I qualify, my grandmother's allowance will stop.
    
    **Stella**: Yes.
    
    **Grimsdyke**: Well, if Granny's allowance stops, we won't have... Good heavens, woman. I shall have to _work!_
    
    **Stella**: Yes!
    
    **Grimsdyke**: And you say you're in love with me?
    

    Literature 

-   Victor Tugelbend is the hero of the Discworld novel _Moving Pictures_, who puts an extraordinary amount of thought and effort into being lazy. He finds the student life at Unseen University very cushy so he studies extra extra hard to get exactly 84% on all his exams. 88% is the minimum passing grade for UU, and he has to get at least 80% to keep his trust fund. He's also in very good shape, so he doesn't have to waste energy hauling around excess body mass.
-   Each of the villains in the _Keys to the Kingdom_ series represents a deadly sin, with Mister Monday representing sloth. He has servants carry him around at all time and the waiting line for people seeking his approval to do something stretches into the hundreds of thousands. Seeing as he keeps an important part of the Celestial Bureaucracy running... Let's just say that in the ten thousand years of his reign, even some people remain unaccounted for.
-   Older Than Feudalism: The Grasshopper in _The Ant And The Grasshopper_, one of Aesop's Fables.
-   Mrs Ablewhite in _The Moonstone_.
    
    My Aunt Ablewhite is a large, silent, fair-complexioned woman, with one noteworthy point in her character. From the hour of her birth she has never been known to do anything for herself. She has gone through life, accepting everybody's help, and adopting everybody's opinions.
    
-   The protagonist in the Heinlein story _The Man Who Was Too Lazy To Fail_.
-   In _Tobacco Road_, Jeeter Lester believes himself to be a hard-working farmer who's not to blame if other people won't give him credit to buy seed cotton and fertilizer. His actions, or rather his inactivity, suggests otherwise.
-   Bertie from _Jeeves and Wooster_, who has more than enough money to support his lazy lifestyle and dreads nothing more than losing his valet, who runs his life and sees to it that he doesn't have to do a thing himself. While Bertie loves travel, sports, and helping out his friends, he also loves lounging around with a cigarette and a cheap mystery novel.
-   Sol in the _Warrior Cats_ series. He's charismatic enough to convince other cats to do what he wants, but somehow always ends up letting them fight in his place, or having them bring him food. Barley's brothers are also freeloaders that insist they need Ravenpaw to "show" them how to hunt and prepare sleeping areas.
-   In John Milton's _Paradise Lost_, Belial urges lying low and not provoking more wrath — they are already better off than they were in the act of falling:
    
    _Thus BELIAL with words cloath'd in reasons garb  
    Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,_
    
-   _The Hobbit_ has a rare example of an antagonist who is extremely slothful yet legitimately dangerous. Smaug "the chiefest and greatest calamity of our age" spends decades just sleeping on his Dragon Hoard, and doesn't bother anyone unless his Greed needs sating or his Pride needs salving. If anyone does provoke him, however...
    -   The film makes him a more active threat by factoring in Sauron's return, and Gandalf's thoughts about how much trouble they'd all be in if Sauron were able to shake Smaug out of his sloth and persuade him to take an active role in Middle Earth's destruction. This concern was also present in some of Tolkien's (posthumously published) writings, although for various reasons the film had to separately reason it out based purely on _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ (including appendices).
-   In _Metaltown_ Otto Hampton spends his time drinking and being with women instead of doing his job, which is at least partially responsible for the deplorable conditions in Metaltown.
-   The fireflies from _The Underland Chronicles_. Mareth describes how he once saw two fireflies try to fight to the death over a piece of cake, only to accuse the other of cheating and resort to sulking.
-   _Ratburger_: Zoe's mean stepmother Sheila is so lazy that it takes effort for her to use the TV remote.
-   The Bogeys from _Fungus the Bogeyman_ are a whole species of Lazy Bums. Their posters advertise past events so no one has to bother going to the events, they try their best to be slow, and they often fall asleep while sailing.
-   In Clark Ashton Smith's fantasy stories, the jerkass god known as Tsathoggua is basically this on a divine scale. He's described as moving with "divine slothfulness", and pretty much only wakes up when it's time for a Human Sacrifice to be fed to him, or to deliver a snarky bon mot.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In an episode of _The Addams Family_, Morticia and Uncle Fester mistakenly overhear Gomez say the family is broke. Fester turns to Morticia: "What will we do for money? I'm too proud to beg and too lazy to work!"
-   Basi from the Nigerian TV show _Basi And Company_ is a man whose goal in life is to become a millionaire without ever doing work. In the pilot episode, he tells an unemployed friend to try throwing himself off a bridge instead of job hunting... because some good Samaritan will save him and get him a job, just like happened to one of the current cabinet ministers.

-   _Fort Boyard_: Pr. Kevin challenges the candidates' knowledge in the Boyard Academy... while doing the absolute minimum of effort himself. And usually taking a little nap right afterward. Or before. Or both. When outside the watchtower, he moves around on a motorized bed.
-   _Frasier_: Daphne's brother Simon is a massive slob who won't do anything for himself if there's a possibility he can get someone else to do it for him. A large part of the reason Daphne doesn't like him is because he expects her to wait on him hand and foot.
-   Lui from Studio 100's _Kabouter Plop_ series is constantly drowsy, and is always seen sleeping. His catchphrase is "Ik Word Daar Zoe Moe Van" and a song about his sleeping habit.
-   _Law & Order:_ McCoy says of an opposing lawyer, "Dean's not a bad sort, just morally opposed to hard work."
-   Subverted in _LazyTown_ with Robbie Rotten, whose efforts to get everyone else to stop doing things (or just ruin their day) actually take a lot of work; this is lampshaded at least once.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: Malva Meadowgrass is a lazy Harfoot woman who would order other people around than do the job herself.
-   Maynard G. Krebbs from _The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis_. The mere mention of work was enough to scare him.
-   Peg Bundy, female lead of _Married... with Children_. Early on, she was portrayed as a jaded but competent homemaker, but exaggeration set in until Peg is so lazy that basic tasks like grocery shopping and feeding her children are foreign (and repulsive) to her.
-   Nathan from _Misfits_. Not quite smart enough to be Brilliant, but Lazy, not nearly dumb enough to qualify as The Ditz. He's capable, but _oh so_ lazy.
-   Lister from _Red Dwarf_ is one of the ones we root for. He never does any work whatsoever, but it's not like a giant empty spaceship with no crew needs a lot of work, and he's more fun than his Control Freak nemesis. He's also self-aware of it. When asked to state his "occupation", he outright says that it's "bum".

-   _The Sopranos_: Tony Soprano has the hardest time getting his spoiled son A.J. to do any work whatsoever, and almost never without a ton of whining beforehand.
-   Almost every season of _Survivor_ has at least one contestant who makes a show of not doing work, gloats about how funny it is that other people do work instead of them, and then has no clue why the other contestants (and the audience) hate them.

    Music 

-   _Evillious Chronicles_: "Gift from the Princess Who Brought Sleep" represents Sloth, sung by Hatsune Miku. Unlike most examples, this one is rather metaphorical. Margarita (who is a very Broken Bird) grows discontent with everyone's unhappiness, and starting with her unfaithful husband, gives everyone her "gift" ("poison" in German). The metaphor is: life is a struggle to gain happiness, Margarita is too "lazy" to work for her and everyone else's happiness, so she took the "lazy way out" by granting everyone eternal sleep.
-   And then there's Bruno Mars' _The Lazy Song_. "_Today I don't feel like doing anything..._"
-   Mandatory Fun has a parody called "Inactive" that has someone who epitomizes sloth.
    
    _My muscle's gone, I'm atrophied  
    Always lose my fight with gravity  
    I rest my bones, and just chillax  
    My NordicTrack's collecting dust  
    And my Stair-Master's a pile of rust  
    This is it, The Inertia_
    
-   The Tin Pan Alley standard "Lazybones", with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and music by Hoagy Carmichael, is all about this. Mercer's lyrics were written to tease Carmichael.
-   The narrator of Lene Alexandra's satirical "My Boobs Are OK" is a Dumb Blonde who freely admits that she's too lazy to work, and gets away with it because of her looks, especially her boobs.

    Myths & Religion 

-   The Book of Proverbs from The Bible contains several warnings against slothfulness, such as the following verse about a guy who is so lazy that he won't even _eat food_.
    
    The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth (26:15).
    

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Kevin Nash developed this reputation in WCW, specifically of getting paid a lot to do comparatively little work. In TNA it became his gimmick outright, with very little motivating him to move anything other than his lips for a paycheck. (Attacking Scott Hall, as Jeff Jarrett did accidentally or Samoa Joe did verbally was one thing, pursuit of pretty women such as The Beautiful People was another).
-   This is how Jimmy Jacobs treated Milo Beasley in The Age Of The Fall's Full Impact Pro branch. On an Ring of Honor show Jacobs refused to admit Beasley was even an Age Of The Fall Member, insisting he was a "homeless man" whom he had bought a ticket for.

    Theatre 

-   _La Nona_: Chicho contributes exactly nothing to the household. He doesn't help with the chores, spends all day lazing around in his bed composing tangos, and is allergic to the idea of seeking a job. When the family's finances start tightening due to the crisis, he still makes excuse after excuse and plans harebrained schemes to avoid working. It's Played for Drama because his reluctance forces his relatives to make great sacrifices, which ultimately leads to their demise.

    Radio 

-   _Our Miss Brooks_: The hobo calling himself "The Earl of Peoria" in "Miss Brooks Writes About a Hobo".

    Video Games 

-   _Atelier Annie_'s protagonist Annie Eilenberg puts much more effort into sleeping than she does in her alchemy.
-   Merak from _Azure Striker Gunvolt_ complains once you enter his boss room because you didn't have the decency to die on the way there and spare him from having to fight you. When you do fight him, he spends the entire battle in his flying throne, and his ultimate attack is called "Lazy Laser". Once he dies and is resurrected, he complains that he has to keep fighting instead of relaxing.
-   _Bendy and the Ink Machine:_ In the joint recording between Thomas Connor and Wally Franks in Chapter 3, Wally is implied to be one. Thomas keeps explaining how the pipes and valves work asks Wally to keep an eye on a valve, but Wally seems annoyed that Thomas seems to be trying to get him to do his job.
-   Subverted with Python in _Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia_. Forsyth seems to _think_ that Python is this trope. However, Python's definitely capable of getting stuff done; it's just that, as he points out to Clive, Python is very aware of classism issues going on, even in The Deliverance, and is convinced that Hard Work Hardly Works since he (Python) is a commoner, while the commanders are pretty much exclusively nobility.
-   Hilda in _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ is Brilliant, but Lazy with an emphasis on the latter, often trying to push responsibilities she doesn't like onto someone else, or coming up with excuses to avoid activities she doesn't want to do. In truth, she is quite smart and capable in many areas and often steps up to perform a task well if the person she tried to push it onto isn't doing a good job. She admits to Byleth that she doesn't like doing most work because she's scared of disappointing others, reasoning that if nobody expects anything of her, she can't fall short of those expectations.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
    -   Sora is a bit like this in the beginning (Kairi actually _calls_ him one after he wakes up), but he's slowly growing out of it. Saving the universe does that to a guy.
    -   Demyx is this among Organization XIII. He prefers kicking back and writing songs to actual work, and isn't above bribing Roxas to do his missions for him.
-   Relaxed villagers in _Love Life_ like to relax by lounging around or watching paint dry. Also, Carefree villagers hate doing the chores and sometimes skip them to do other things, upsetting their partners.
-   Link is heavily implied to be this prior to the game events and during the prolougues in many games of _The Legend of Zelda_. All before his heroic upgrade status, he is usually having to be forcibly woken up by a close friend or important circumstance.
-   In _Plantasia_, flytraps are described as lazy plants that take a while to grow.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   _Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire_ introduces Slakoth and it's final evolution, Slaking, the 2 laziest Pokémon in the game. Their ability, Truant, means they only make a move every other turn. According to their Pokédex entries, Slakoth moves so little, it only requires to eat 3 leaves a day. Meanwhile, Slaking eats grass within it's reach, and reluctantly moves to another spot when there's no more grass.
        -   Slakoth's first evolved form, Vigoroth, averts this, as it has to constantly move to burn off energy to sleep at night.
    -   _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ brings us Tapu Bulu, who is believed to be this as opposed to its rather docile nature.
-   _Rengoku_: In the second game's backstory Briareos was a mercenary who never did much, to not "do anything wrong". He end ends up being shot after trying to flee from Gryphus. As a boss, he uses ranged laser weapons to attack and conveyer belts to move around.
-   Akashi Kuniyuki from _Touken Ranbu_, who considers his laziness so much a part of his character that he _apologizes_ when he gets MVP status during a battle.
    
    _Sorry about that. My selling point is my lack of motivation, but I ended up giving it my all._
    
-   Sans from _Undertale_ never does anything except lounge around the house whenever his younger brother Papyrus is trying to get actual work done. Though given that Sans actually puts a lot of thought and intricacy into his pranks, the "lazy" attitude is partly just a front to make Papyrus mad. The fact that he's constantly on the borderline of utter despair might also be a contributing factor. Sans muses about this if you can survive his boss fight, wondering aloud if it's just an excuse to be lazy.
    
    **Papyrus:** SANS! PLEASE PICK UP YOUR SOCK!  
    **Sans:** ok.

    **Papyrus:** AND DON'T BRING IT BACK!  
    **Sans:** ok.  
    **Papyrus:** IT'S STILL HERE!

-   _Trillion: God of Destruction_: Fegor, the older sister of Zeabolos, is the holder of the Crest of Sloth, and also proves to be quite the Sleepy Head. This is deliberate, as her powers far surpass that of her older brother, and in a prior War against Heaven, she racked up the _single highest body count!_ She was given the crest to keep her docile during more peaceful times. When it comes time for her to fight Trillion, her Crest being released is treated as a severe Godzilla Threshold.

    Visual Novels 

-   Henry from _Double Homework_ is excited about the website Dennis is setting up for him and the protagonist... unless the protagonist tells him that making it succeed requires hard work. He also is happy about postponing his graduation by accident, because it will delay his entry into the working world for another year.

-   _Squid Row_: Grace. Let special orders accumulate for months — and then when Randie cleared up them, Grace got more hours for it.

-   _Biter Comics_: A man contemplates getting up to answer the phone but decides instead to let it ring several more times at least to make sure that it is, or was, important.
-   In _Godslave_, Edith was doing pretty much nothing ever since she left school. When Alma asks her what her plans for the evening are, she points at her laptop and says "you're looking at them".
-   In _Kill Six Billion Demons_, the Demiurge Jadis of the Seven is associated with the Sin of Sloth, being mostly immobile, completely uninvolved in the running of her empire and the least proactive of the Seven. She is currently sealed inside a coffin of glass due to having seen the universe from the outside and coming to understand everything about Creation. All of it, at once. As a result, she's become a Mad Oracle Straw Nihilist who lacks the motivation to do _anything_, because her perfect knowledge means she already knows what she's going to do. Furthermore, having perfect knowledge of everything means she's currently trapped in all her worst moments of trauma: She cannot 'move on' from the tortures of her abusive father, or the hell of the Multiversal War, or the moment seeing the True Shape flayed her alive, boiled her eyes and ruined her mind, because due to perfect omniscience she's _constantly_ reliving it.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Amazing World of Gumball_: Richard Watterson, Gumball's dad, who's an over grown Manchild who sits in the couch all day. "The Job" reveals that the idea of him actually getting a job is so alien that it results in a Reality-Breaking Paradox.
-   _American Dad!_:
    -   Hayley only seems to work her hardest when attempting to screw over her family. For example, in "Helping Handis", she makes a video about how worthless Francine's life as a homemaker is for class, despite the fact that she keeps dropping out of college; the show openly acknowledges that she will never move out of the house. In "Less Money, Mo' Problems", it's revealed that Jeff is the only one working full time; Hayley would rather remain a community college student and blame the low minimum wage for them mooching off Stan and Francine instead of getting a job herself to bring in more income so they can move out.
    -   Roger prefers to drink, eat, do drugs, or watch TV over doing anything productive unless he actually feels like it.
-   _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_: Master Shake spends all day lazing around the house, and actively refuses to get a job or do any task at all, even when said task is something he decided to do. On one of the few occasions he had a job, he refused to work and eventually liquefied his uniform and tried to steal from the register so he could go play games at the arcade.
-   _Beavis And Butthead_: Beavis and Butt-Head would rather eat and watch TV than do their homework or chores. They are more than willing to cut class or ditch work whenever they feel like it.
-   _Brickleberry_: Malloy slouches around munching on junk food, watching TV, and playing video games.
-   _The Cleveland Show_: Robert, Donna's ex-husband, spends his free-time watching TV in his filthy apartment, getting drunk and/or stoned, occasionally visiting his children — and even "occasionally" is too much of a stretch — going to strip clubs, and generally supporting himself, with only Donna's alimony.
-   _Danny Phantom_.
-   _Daria_: Trent spends most of his time sleeping; he is also heavily implied to be a pothead.
-   The _Dick Tracy_ animated series had the Ethnic Scrappy Go-Go-Gomez, a lazy Mexican detective who solved crimes from his hammock.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_: Timmy Turner; the Made-for-TV Movie movie "Fairy Idol" opened with him being so lazy he relied on Cosmo and Wanda to _get dressed_. By the end of it, however, he learns to stop taking advantage of them.
-   Peter and Chris Griffin from _Family Guy._
-   _Futurama_: Fry often slacks off, takes naps, and refuses to get off the couch. He even says, in one comic, "I take my laziness seriously".
-   _Gravity Falls_: Wendy Corduroy has no work ethic and spends most of her time lazing out around the Mystery Shack.
-   _Hey Arnold!_: Oskar Never Learned to Read English despite having lived in America for several years until Arnold taught him how. He was so lazy he initially tried to cheat his way out of it.
-   Beezy on _Jimmy Two-Shoes_ literally schedules his sloth.
-   _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_: Experiment 625 is every bit as powerful as Stitch... but he has no interest in using his abilities, and would rather make sandwiches. He does get to work to help Lilo a few times, though, and in the Grand Finale movie, _Leroy & Stitch_, in addition to finally getting his own name, Reuben, he gets a Moment of Awesome when he successfully repairs Gantu's crashed ship, something that Gantu had been unable to do in the series.
-   _The Looney Tunes Show_: Daffy Duck is Bugs Bunny's lazy roommate who mooches off his fortune and patience. Funnily enough, through his Cloud Cuckoolander shenanigans, he managed to get several jobs he couldn't hold down, including briefly being the _CEO_ of Eccentric Millionaire Foghorn Leghorn's company. When he tries to get a normal office job after this, the astonished manager tells him he's overqualified. When he falsely believed Bugs was kicking him out, he immediately joined the Marines.
-   Mr. Lazy from _The Mr. Men Show_.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Spike would rather sleep than do anything else, despite his job as Twilight Sparkle's assistant.
-   _Regular Show_: Both Mordecai and Rigby fit the bill, but Rigby moreso, to the point of becoming The Millstone, at least up until his Character Development. Rigby would rather play video games and goof off than do his chores. "First Day" reveals he was too lazy to fill out his work application; Mordecai had to do so for him.
-   Homer Simpson from _The Simpsons_.
-   Bird from _Skunk Fu!_ fits this trope rather well. He also induces this on Ox as well.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   Squidward Tentacles, especially when it comes to his job at the Krusty Krab. He's a sloppy employee, either reading magazines (even in front of waiting customers), outright sleeping on the job (one time, he faked an injury from that), occasionally Playing Sick or hoisting his workload on SpongeBob. It's to the extent that in "Bubble Buddy," he only wanted to pop Bubble Buddy because he "made \[him\] provide excellent service."
    -   Patrick Star also qualifies as one too. In contrast to the hard-working SpongeBob, he tends to be unwilling and uninterested in doing any physical labour.
    -   While normally a hard worker, SpongeBob himself was this in "Welcome to the Chum Bucket", where he ended up going to work at the Chum Bucket after Mr. Krabs bet his contract in a poker game with Plankton and lost. Plankton believed that having SpongeBob work for him would result in his success at getting the Krabby Patty formula and putting the Krusty Krab out of business, but the scheme backfires when SpongeBob drives him crazy with his rebellious attitude and refused to do his job, even after Plankton steals his brain and implants it in the robot chef. Plankton, as a result, admitted to having cheated in the poker game, put SpongeBob's brain back in his body and allowed him to return to his original workplace. In spite of having his brain stolen by Plankton, SpongeBob's loyalty to the Krusty Krab remains tried and true.
-   Dodsworth the cat in a couple of Robert McKimson's Warners shorts (_Kiddin' the Kitten_ and _A Peck o' Trouble_) in The '50s.
-   _Velma_: Despite proclaiming how she has to work diligently to get anything that Fred has instantly handed to him, Velma in practice tends to pawn off work to other people and reap the rewards of it. She frequently comments how she doesn't try to do any chores around the house, mooches off of Norville for homework answers, relies on others to give her the clues to the mystery, and when she had to pretend to be Amanda's mother she often tried to pawn her off to others to take care of her.
-   Crock, the nominal Big Bad of Disney's _The Wuzzles_, is characterised first and foremost by his laziness. He finds work offensive to the point that, in "Bulls of a Feather", despite having been reduced to ripping out pictures of food from magazines and eating them due to having nothing else, he reacts to Flizard saying he's hungry enough to look for work as if the other Wuzzle had said something profane. He literally asks where Flizard heard that "disgusting word", suggests he picked it up in the streets, and threatens to wash his mouth out with soap as if he were a kid spouting vulgarities. Meanwhile, the whole plot of "Crock Around The Clock" is kicked off by Crock's laziness (refusing to prepare for the well-predicted tropical fruit-storm until it actually happens) and further driven by it (he feigns being injured to mooch off of Butterbear's kindness until the other Wuzzles get suspicious and trick him into revealing himself).
