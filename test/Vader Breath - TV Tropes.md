_"Oh, boy. Here comes an evil asthmatic._"

_SSSHHH HOHHHHHH..._ There is something particularly creepy about wheezy or labored breathing. _...SSSSHHHHH_ Unnatural breathing can characterize someone as being_...HOHHHHHHH_ unnatural, or less than human. As a result, _...SSSSHHSH_ this sort of breathing is often given to _...HOHHHHHHHHHHHHH_ evil characters. This has been particularly true since 1977, when the Trope Namer Darth Vader first appeared in film. Ideally, the creepy breathing is combined with some sort of _...HOHHHHHHH_ creepy voice, and an Evil Laugh _cough_. Sometimes the creepy breathing is justified by some sort of disfiguring accident, which gives the evil character a creepy appearance as well.

    Trope Namer (Darth Vader and related examples) 

-   _Star Wars_:
    -   Darth Vader. Weirdly, the breathing never stops, even when he's talking. This is most apparent at the very end of _Revenge of the Sith_, when Vader's yelling "Noooo..." According to _Dark Lord—The Rise of Darth Vader_, his vocal cords and lungs are both only barely usable and he relies on an artificial life support system built in his suit, and the constant asthmatic breathing is a constant mechanical pump supplying oxygen, while his speech is heavily amplified to make it louder than a whisper. In _Shadows of the Empire_ we see that he can use The Dark Side of the Force to briefly heal and breathe on his own, but only for a moment, and then his sudden joy at being able to do that breaks his Dark Side focus. There were plans to give Vader a new suit that would remove several of the problems mentioned above. Too bad the procedure put his life at serious risk — specifically, the previous suit would have to be removed, including the oxygen pump. _Revenge of the Sith_ shows Vader getting his suit, allowing us to hear his first iconic breaths. In fact, due to the smoke in front of the mask, we also get to _see_ them.
    -   General Grievous has a rather nasty sounding hacking cough, which George Lucas has stated is deliberate Foreshadowing that Anakin will turn into Darth Vader, with Obi-Wan fighting both. In the Canon continuity, he always had it, while in the _Legends_ continuity, he only gained it shortly before _Revenge of the Sith_ from when Mace Windu made his chest implode.
    -   By the events of _Rogue One_, Saw Guerrera relies on a breathing mask which makes this sound, though he doesn't need to use it constantly. Similar to Grievous, Saw's case is to reflect on how his radical tactics make him no different from the Empire. Also used by the trope namer himself in the climax, to the most terrifying possible effect.
    -   Also used in _Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order_ to signify Vader's arrival as the Final Boss.
    -   The series finale of _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ also uses it to reveal his presence in the final scene of the series.
    -   In a bit of cruel irony, this iconic sound would become Harsher in Hindsight after David Prowse, the first actor to wear the Vader suit, passed away on November 28th, 2020 due to COVID-19 complications.
-   Almost any parody of Vader, including the ones done by _Family Guy_ and _South Park,_ must include Vader Breath. Conversely, if a character on a show such as these suddenly develops Vader Breath, it _becomes_ a parody of Vader.
-   Parodied in _Spaceballs_. And the Rule of Funny helps cover the fact that, as stated above, Vader can't breathe OUTSIDE of his suit. Dark Helmet didn't _need_ his helmet to survive, he just wore it because it was sooooo big.
    
    "I can't breathe in this thing!"
    
-   The German sci-fi parody _(T)raumschiff Surprise_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  has a Vader-like character who is merely asthmatic. No mask, but he needs to use his puffer a lot.
-   In the brief moment he is described as "Darth Valer" in _My Immortal_, Voldermort's quote has ellipsis and is described as having "a raspy voice", meaning that Tara Gillesbie _intentionally_ drew attention to this. It's an underappreciated piece of evidence that the whole thing is a Troll Fic.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Yashiro Chikama in _Adachi and Shimamura_ breathes very loudly during her time in her space suit, especially in the anime. When her human form is ready, she takes off the space suit and loses the loud, labored breathing.
-   Kuma in _Afro Samurai_, until his helmet is torn or knocked off.
-   Jagi of _Fist of the North Star_ is also given this, as a result of the damage inflicted by Kenshiro in their first battle.
-   Death Gun in _Sword Art Online's_ second season has this going on with his skull mask.
-   Bui from _YuYu Hakusho_, until he removes his armor.
-   Pia Decem in _GaoGaiGar Final_, since he doesn't talk, this is the only sound he makes.
-   Anyone who put on Majo's gas mask in _Wasteful Days of High School Girls_ gets this in the anime, along with muffled voices.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: In this _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ fanfiction; by the time Mariko is introduced to Monster X, the deformed monster's breathing has been reduced to labored wheezing by dehydration.
-   _This Bites!_: Shiliew of the Rain's dialogue is regularly interspersed with a wheezing, mechanical _Pshhh-koh_ noise, courtesy of him being turned into a Cyborg after Crocodile tears most of his limbs off and sucks all the moisture out of his body.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Mars Needs Moms_: Gribble imitates the breathing.
-   _My Little Pony: A New Generation_: At one point Sprout is hiding in the shadows and he appears to be breathing heavily but as soon as he steps out into the light its revealed he's just drinking a smoothie.
-   _Toy Story_:
    -   In the first film, Buzz's breathing when he first appears on the bed and we see from inside his helmet.
    -   The opening of _Toy Story 2_ uses the real Vader sound, along with some other _Star Wars_ and _Terminator 2_ sound effects in and around Zurg's base.
-   In _Wreck-It Ralph_, Ralph does this when using a Reed Snorkel.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Non-villainous (but still damn creepy) example: the astronauts' heavy breathing in their spacesuits in _2001: A Space Odyssey_.
-   In _All Quiet on the Western Front (2022)_, this effect is produced when the soldiers have to put on their gas masks. It is unsettling and underlines the horror of war.
-   _The Batman (2022)_: The Riddler affects a low, gravelly voice and has some audible difficulty breathing. In scenes from his POV, the raspy breath is a persistent part of the background noise. This is presumably due to his mask, as he doesn't seem to have any trouble breathing in Arkham, where he doesn't have it.
-   Bane in _The Dark Knight Rises_. He couldn't breath at all once Batman damaged his mask, due to his tracheal chords being damaged.
-   One of the casualties in _Dog Soldiers_ realized that there was a werewolf behind him in the back seat of the truck due to its heavy breathing, then had his suspicions confirmed when a rush of exhaled vapors flowed past his shoulder. Oh, and also when it ripped him to shreds.
-   In Blake Edwards' suspense-thriller _Experiment in Terror,_ the psycho stalking Lee Remick has an asthmatic rasp for a voice.
-   _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_: The men in their hazmat suits invading the house are breathing like this.
-   The version of Cobra Commander (known as "The Doctor" before he assumes his famous title) from _GI Joe The Rise Of Cobra_.
-   Done for laughs in _The Graduate_, when Benjamin's demonstrating the scuba outfit his parents gave him.
-   In _The Grudge 3_, Naoko makes raspy, gurgling breathing noises after she becomes a Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl, thanks to being stabbed through the throat.
-   Michael Myers in the _Halloween_ movies achieves this sound by breathing heavily through his cheap rubber mask.
-   _Harry Potter_: The Dementors breathe quite heavily, as a sign of them inhaling people's happy feelings. This is consistent with the books, where in Harry's first encounter with one, it is described as "\[drawing\] slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings."
-   _Hellboy (2004)_: After Hellboy resurrects a long-dead Russian man named Ivan, the guy has to breathe in to speak and does so with a large wheeze.

-   Saddam Hussein does this (Along with a Vader impersonation) in _Hot Shots! Part Deux_, before succumbing to a coughing fit. After a drag on his inhaler, he's back to normal.
-   The appropriately named Wheezy Joe in _Intolerable Cruelty_.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   _For Your Eyes Only_: When Bond is about to be attacked underwater by an enemy diver in a JIM suit, all we see is a POV shot accompanied by the sound of the air regulator.
    -   _No Time to Die_: Lyutsifer Safin's respiration (likely because of exhaustion after a long walk) under his Noh mask in the Distant Prologue makes him even more sinister as he comes to the home of Mr. White in Norway to kill him, his wife and his young daughter Madeleine.
-   Referenced in _Jarhead_. During a gas mask drill, one of the solders can't help but breathe extra-deeply and throw a few Vader lines.
-   Immortan Joe in _Mad Max: Fury Road._ Word of God states that his respirator is actually just to filter out sand, worn out of habit ever since he was young and healthy, and his labored breathing (and sore-covered body) are just results of being an old man living in a post-nuclear wasteland.
-   The thing that haunts Lucie in _Martyrs_.
-   The gas-mask wearing slasher in _My Bloody Valentine 3D_.
-   Parodied in the second _Night at the Museum_ film, where the Big Bad Kahmunrah recruits historical "bad guys" Napoléon Bonaparte, Ivan the Terrible, and Al Capone as his Dragons. Later, two more "bad guys" ask to join them. One is Oscar the Grouch and the other is Darth Vader, who doesn't say a word. Kahmunrah doesn't get what's so scary about Vader and points out that he sounds as if he's having trouble breathing. Vader tries a Force Choke, further confusing Kahmunrah.
-   The very creepy Pale Man from _Pan's Labyrinth._
-   In _Phantom of the Paradise_, Winslow Leach has a freak accident with a record press, severely deforming his face and damaging his vocal cords. He later sneaks into the Paradise, with his own labored breathing imposed over the soundtrack — predating the Trope Namer, by the way.
-   In _Quarantine (2008)_, when the CDC guys enter the building, their gas masks make this noise; it's a little over-the-top.
-   Rippner in _Red Eye_ gets a distinctly wheezy breath after he gets stabbed through the windpipe with a pen, which would do that to you — especially if your idea of medical attention for it is ripping it out with your bare hands and using somebody's silk scarf as a bandage/cravat to buy you some time for the climax of the film.
-   In _Revenge of the Nerds_, the head jock is wearing a helmet and gas mask disguise at the carnival. Louis, the head nerd, "borrows" this disguise to get with the head cheerleader. A perspective shot through the mask has a Vader Breath sound.
-   The opening scene of _Richard III_ has the title character leading gasmasked commandos in a raid on the previous King's headquarters. Once the tank smashes through the wall the gun battle is muffled, with the main sound being Richard's breathing through his gas mask up until the moment when he shoots King Henry VI. The script notes that Richard is breathing in iambic pantameter.
-   _Twinkle Twinkle Little Star_, being a _Star Wars_ parody, naturally has their (unnamed) Vader expy exhaling deep breathes like the original. It appears to be a recycled sound effect.
-   Vega in _Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li._
-   The incarnation of Alien Baltan in _Ultraman Cosmos: The First Contact_ substitutes the iconic Baltanian laugh (oh-ho-ho-ho) with this. Baltan's Vader Breath is in fact the first thing audiences hear as soon as the movie starts.
-   In _When a Stranger Calls_, many of the phone calls made by the titular Stranger consist of his creepy, heavy breathing.
-   Wheezy the weasel from _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, complete with hacking and coughing, due to his smoking habits.
-   _The Wild Geese_. The mercenaries use cyanide gas to kill a room full of sleeping guards. Unfortunately their Vader Breath starts before the mercenaries have put on their gas masks. Nevertheless the laboured breathing of the sleepers suddenly coming to a stop as each dies has a sinister effect.
-   In _The Wraith_, the title character is The Voiceless, with this trope as an exception.

    Literature 

-   Max Barry's _Machine Man_ has this for Dr. Charles Neumann after he's been reduced to a Man in the Machine. Every word he speaks requires another gasp from plastic lungs.
-   In _The War of the Worlds_, Martian breathing is described as "tumultuous," and it's assumed that it's because they're not used to Earth's atmosphere and gravity. Although it might also be pneumonoa, as they got rip-roaring sick the instant they breathed Earth's air according to the epilogue.
-   A minor character in the Ciaphas Cain novels is severely injured during _Caves of Ice_, and doctors have to give her a set of augmetic lungs as a result. Every other time she shows up in the series, there's at least one reference to the _hiss! click!_ noise of her breathing.
-   The _Fire of Heaven_ series justifies this with the Arkhos of Nemohaim, and immensely fat man who already has breathing trouble and who is usually left wheezing and gasping for air after exerting himself.
-   The Crippled God from _Malazan Book of the Fallen_ has to constantly inhale incense in order to keep his lungs clear. Even then, his breathing is still ragged and wheezing.

    Live-Action TV 

-   An episode of _That '70s Show_ centered on the original release of _Star Wars: A New Hope_ had Eric punch an asthmatic rival for Donna's affections in the nose; this causes him to speak in a Vader-like voice ("Donna WILL be mine!") and develop the trademark breathing.
-   _CSI: NY_: The villain in "Blacklist", who coughs a good bit and uses an oxygen tank, has very labored breathing and speaks quite slowly with a low, raspy voice due to advanced lung cancer.
-   Cheney's cough is played up in this clip on _The Daily Show_. Part of their running riff on the evil of the former vice president. They eventually stopped. Vader called and complained.

-   _Game of Thrones_: Gregor Clegane very noticeably breathes heavily after Qyburn's treatment.
-   _Henry Danger_: In "Gas or Fail" when Charlotte wears a protective gas mask during Henry's test, she does a heavy high-pitched version of Darth Vader's breathing sound, complete with a similar-sounding distorted voice.
-   _Malcolm in the Middle_... ... ...
    -   The show... has...Malcolm's...friend...Stevie...who has...a really...bad...case...of asthma...and...only...one...lung. His...inability...to say...more than...a couple...words...at a time...is always...played for....laughs...usually...by giving....him....very....long...lines...and having...the other....characters...lose patience...before he's...finished....speaking.
    -   And when....he's under...stress...his father...develops...this same...problem.

-   In _Sherlock_, "The Hounds of Baskerville" features the true killer breathing heavily through his red-eyed gas mask.
-   Evil Cripple Lex Luthor in _Smallville_'s eighth season suffered from this, due to breathing by means of a respirator.

-   _Supernatural_: In "Nightmare Logic", the first sign that Maggie is in trouble is the ghoul's ominous, heavy breathing behind her.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   The Cigarette Smoking Man, the main villain of the Myth Arc, always smokes and his habit gave him heavy breathing.

    Music 

-   "Forsaken" by Jonathan Davis as covered by David Draiman has this layering the track.
-   The intro of "Edge of Dawn" by Covenant.
-   "Mr Frump in the Iron Lung" by "Weird Al" Yankovic has this, done with the air valve from his accordian.
-   Pink Floyd has it in the background on "Don't Leave Me Now".
-   Jean-Michel Jarre's "Oxygene Part 10" from _Oxygène 7-13_ ends with a sample of a SCUBA regulator, which is also a Call-Back to the outro of "Fourth Rendez-Vous" from _Rendez-Vous_.
-   Testube's "Second Soul" from the album of the same name has a particularly creepy one throughout the whole song.
-   The intro and ending of Juno Reactor's "Mars", the former starting during the fade-out of the preceding track "Rotorblade" on the album's CD and digital editions.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Raistlin from the _Dragonlance_ stories.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   Techpriests often have their lower face and lungs replaced by cybernetics. Because of the strongly varying tech-levels of the setting, this can work perfectly well and even surpass the original organs or result in Vader Breath, which in the roleplaying games makes strenuous physical activity harder (the lungs are less efficient at oxygenating the blood) and applies a penalty to Sneaking rolls.
    -   Cue inevitable Shout Outs—for example, a Techpriest model for _Inquisitor_ reminding the creator of "He's more machine now than man."
        
        Dmitri hisses like an asthmatic pensioner when he breathes, naturally.
        
    -   The Necron Lord of All Kaurava in _Dawn of War_. A Necron that speaks _at all_ is unique in the setting.

    Theater 

-   In the Screen-to-Stage Adaptation of _Beauty and the Beast,_ the stage directions say that when Belle arrives at the castle to try and rescue her father, she can hear the Beast breathing behind her - "animal-like."

    Theme Parks 

-   On of the scares in _The Haunted Mansion_ is a door that bulges out and gives off a heavy breathing sound.

    Video Games 

-   Regenerators from _Resident Evil 4_. These things sound like someone might if they tried to breathe with a slit throat.
-   King K. Rool in _Donkey Kong 64_, in a rather obvious nod to _Star Wars_.
-   _Endless Ocean_: Your character does it every time you go underwater.
-   Psycho Mantis from _Metal Gear Solid_.
-   Von Bolt, the Big Bad of _Advance Wars Dual Strike_.
-   Kassadin, one of the Champions in _League of Legends_, has this when he has charged one of his moves, Force Pulse. It gets irritating after a while which makes the player want even more to use the move on an unsuspecting enemy.
-   Gol in _Jak and Daxter_ wheezes constantly for no apparent reason. It may be an effect of his Dark Eco corruption, but none of the other corrupted characters in the series have any noticable breathing difficulty, including Gol's sister. Gol has parts of his body replaced with precursor technology, so it's probably either a result of the tech itself, or whatever injury caused him to lose those parts of himself in the first place.
-   Inner Lavos, the second form of the final boss in _Chrono Trigger_.
-   Dark Star in _No More Heroes_, among other _Star Wars_ references.
-   In _Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time_, the Vizier's bloody cough is probably for this purpose, underlining his evilness. It's not the Incurable Cough of Death, since he, well, doesn't die of it. Only because the Prince kills him first. It _was_ a sign he was dying, making part of his motivation to find the sands the promise of immortality.
-   Used as part of the background music in _Silent Hill_, and in the OST tracks "Never Again 2" and "Die". The in Universe explanation is that it's Alessa's labored breathing on a hospital ventilator. The real world explanation is that a game that breathes as you play it is _fucking creepy_.
    -   Likewise for some of the ambience in _Silent Hill 2_ and _Silent Hill 3_, which also sometimes include a Heartbeat Soundtrack.
-   The G-Man, particularly in _Half-Life 2_. \*gasp\* The right man in the wrong place... It's believed to be yet another imperfection in his "normal human" facade, and more than one fan has described it as speaking like someone who's entirely unused to having lungs.
    -   In the _Half-Life_'s Expansion Pack, _Opposing Force_, the second stage of Headcrab Zombies could be identified by their creepy breathing. This breathing carries on with HL2's poison headcrab zombies.
-   For some strange reason, the magical lampposts and lanterns in the Night Elf regions of _World of Warcraft_ make this noise whenever you stand near them, leading many confused newbies to ask in the in-game chat rooms, "All right, who keeps doing the Darth Vader impression?"
-   The Pyromaniacs from _Sacrifice_. Their unit quotes are also filled to the brim with Darth Vader and Lord Helmet Shout Outs.
-   The zombies in _Thief_ have a bad, bad case of bronchitis.
-   The ending seasons of the _Mega Man Battle Network/Rockman.EXE_ featured Zero.EXE. It helps that he's not only based on a hero, but is seen working for the side of evil at first and has a lightsaber for an arm when he fights?
-   Vohaul from _Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge_ is hooked up to a ventilator machine and has a Vader-like mask (although his dialog is all text).
-   _Battle Realms_ Lotus Clan has a unit called the Diseased One, which attacks by coughing toxic spores onto enemies.
-   The volus in _Mass Effect_. The drastic differences in pressure and gravity require them to wear special environment suits on other planets (or at least all the ones Shepard has seen them on). They're not exactly evil, but they are a Proud Merchant Race without any really "heroic" representatives until the multiplayer DLC.
-   _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_ has a section where your character must don a spacesuit to travel across the outside of a space station. Seeing as it's a Star Wars game and can't go ten minutes without a Shout-Out, the spacesuit has breathing very similar to Vader's.
-   In _Metro 2033_, you breathe very loudly when you put your gas mask on, and when your filter starts to fail, you start wheezing (while looking at your lens fog up).
-   Q from _Street Fighter III_. Idling makes him do Vader Breath, and the rest of his voicework is Voice Grunting.
-   The Vores from _Quake_ appear to suffer from this.
-   One of the sound effects in _Fate/stay night_, generally only used in very creepy situations and when the narrator is sufficiently badly injured.
-   In _Dark Fall: Lost Souls_, the Inspector whom you play has emphysema, and starts breathing hard if you climb steps or ladders, or stay in one place outside in the cold for long. The opening segment of the game consists of a black screen, and the sound of his increasingly-desperate attempts to draw air into what's left of his lungs.
-   _Wolfenstein (2009)'s_ Heavy Troopers sound like this, if you can get close to them unnoticed. It's probably because they're vat-grown Super Soldiers with insufficiently developed lungs.
-   _RuneScape_ has Mi-Gor, a small zombie wearing a gas mask. The breath is not actually heard, just described in the dialogue lines as \*wheeze\* before every line, and before that, "as if someone is trying to talk with his throat full of mud".
-   The _Fallout: New Vegas_ DLC Dead Money has the Ghost People, all of whom have wheezy, raspy, _loud_ breath. The loud breathing is the best way to tell when they're sneaking up on you. Serves as Paranoia Fuel when you can't see them, but you can hear them breathing.
-   _Minecraft_ have blazes which breathe heavily.
-   Titanite Demons in _Dark Souls_ do this to indicate their presence, even though they don't seem to have a head.
-   The Pyro in _Team Fortress 2_ has this in Meet the Pyro and presumably in-universe as a result of asbestos lung damage.
-   Porky Minch in _Mother 3_. It is explained that his extensive abuse of time travel has left him immortal, but still with an aging body, resulting in oft-childish banter and insults being peppered with the coughs and wheezes of an old man.

-   _The Journeyman Project_: Agent 5, Gage Blackwood Turbo gradually descends to this if you take too long in the maze below the Mars Colony. Once the music dies down, you can hear him struggling for air through an oxygen mask he's wearing. You can also hear him breathing heavily if he doesn't have the mask on at all in the maze or the NORAD VI time zone, which has sleeping gas in the vents.
-   _Penumbra Black Plague_: The music for the Chemical Laboratory has what sounds like heavy breathing in the background. Philip also does this when wearing a gas mask.

-   _Exmortis_ starts with the player character breathing like this, out in a cold forest at night.
-   _Obsidian_: The second dream world does this in one of its four elemental puzzles, where the goal is to provide the Mechanical Spider with air. The _landscape_ breathes when it's solved, and the spider visibly breathes in and out for a few seconds, as you return to the hub.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_: The Hero's Shade breathes like this constantly, despite being a skeletal ghost. As confirmed by _Hyrule Historia_, he's actually a heroic example, being a previous Link.
-   _Little Nightmares II_: The Doctor is heard making a heavy breathing which only enhance his creepiness.
-   _The Secret World_: Featured when players finally catch up with Joe Slater; the first indication that something is very wrong with him is his hoarse, labored breathing. He's partially transformed into one of the aquatic Draug, and his lungs aren't coping well with dry land.
-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse — Earthblood_: The Endron Elite Mooks, guards turned into muscular hulks through the use of a Super Serum and equipped with breather masks, breathe loudly and raggedly when moving or fighting.
-   _Wick_: Tim and Tom Weaver. Tim from having caught polio as a living child, and Tom from having all his bones broken.
-   _Wick (2020)_: Mara has rather loud, raspy breathing (possibly from the plague that ravaged the cathedral), which can be a tell-tale sign she's nearby.
