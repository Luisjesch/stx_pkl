No, not that The End. Or that one. Or even that one. Or to some extent that one.

The characters are about to do something, but are interrupted by the end of the episode, often in the form of a "The End" card. This isn't a Cliffhanger that will be resolved when the characters finish their plans next episode; either the end of the episode actually prevents them from ever getting it done, or they at least express dismay that the episode's ending has stopped or delayed them.

Often overlaps with Smash Cut and The Unreveal. Often used for a Curse Cut Short.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo_: The last episode of the anime has absolutely no lead-in to the ending, which is simply announced by Dengakuman holding up a sign while the rest are about to charge into a fight. Nobody in the group is pleased by this, not even the narrator, all while Dengakuman cheerfully waves goodbye as the screen fades to black.
-   This is a running gag in the _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ anime's "Baka Rangers" shorts. Baka Pink's introduction always gets cut off by the segment ending, and the one time the others let her go first she gets crushed by a giant robot.

    Fan Works 

-   _Turnabout Storm_: The Stinger in the final episode has Princess Celestia talking to an unknown person. After some cryptic dialogue of which only Celestia's side is heard, the princess asks the other person's name. She then answers: _"My name? My name is..."_. Cue ending. Subverted since the end gives the answer by giving the credits for Princess Celestia and Mia Fey.

    Films — Animation 

-   In the very last scene of _Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show_, Jonny, AKA Captain Melonhead, has turned to evil after the other kids beat him up for beating up the Eds. He vows to rain terror on the cul-de-sac as The Gourd, only for Plank to tell him that the movie is over.
    
    **Jonny**: What? There's no time left? It's the end of the movie? _What_ movie?
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Stinger of _Birds of Prey (2020)_ has Harley Quinn about to reveal a secret about Batman. She begins by saying, "Did you know that Batman f-" only for the film to abruptly end right there and then.
-   The ending of _The Lost Boys_ cuts off right before the cast reacts to Grandpa having apparently known that vampires existed in the town.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ ends with Captain America calling for the new team of Avengers to assemble, but is cut off by the end credits as the A from "assemble" is emerging from his mouth.
    -   _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ ends with Aunt May seeing Peter in his Spider-Man outfit and managing to get out "What the fu-" before the credits start.
    -   In _Spider-Man: Far From Home_, the film ends with J. Jonah Jameson showing a video to the world of Mysterio declaring that Peter is Spider-Man. Funnily enough, he has the same reaction as Aunt May did in _Homecoming_.
-   Monty Python:
    -   The 1972 film "And Now For Something Completely Different" starts with the How Not To Be Seen Sketch, the opening titles and a sudden "The End" card. Terry Jones comes out to apologize for the brief film length and goes on to a man with a tape recorder up his nose before the film resumes.
    -   Budget shortfalls necessitated the fourth wall-breaking ending of _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_, in which Arthur's climactic attack on the castle is interrupted by the police, who shut down production.
-   _Muppets Most Wanted_ has Nadya attempt to sing a solo verse in the ending song, "Together Again Again" - but the movie cuts to the credits before she can begin.
-   Though it also appears in an earlier scene, _My Fellow Americans_ ends with a verbal cutoff. One character distracts the other and seizes a microphone in front of a large audience. As the latter begins "My fellow Americans," the former sees he's been deceived and mutters "you son of a--"
-   _Patriot Games_: Cathy Ryan is on the phone with her doctor, who has just told her whether her unborn child will be a boy or a girl. After she gets off the phone, she grins and savors the moment as Jack and Sally anxiously stare at her waiting to hear the answer. Cue credits.
-   The film _The Rules of Attraction_ ends mid-sentence. It also begins mid-sentence. The book did the same thing with the exact same two lines.
-   _Saria_ is about the Real Life events that led up to a tragic orphanage fire in which 41 girls were killed. The fire breaks out while the girls are locked in a room, the evil guard smirks and turns back to her phone—and boom, the film ends, just like that, without showing the end of the fire, much less anything that followed.

    Literature 

-   The great prophet Zarquon, whose second coming has been long awaited in _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, is interrupted not by the end of the episode, but by the end of the universe.
-   "Behind the Painted Smile," a 1983 essay by Alan Moore on the origins of _V for Vendetta_ ends:
    
    So anyway, that's where we get our ideas from. I was going to go on from this point and tell you exactly who V really is, but I'm afraid that I've run out of room. The only real hint I can give is that V isn't Evey's father, Whistler's mother, or Charley's aunt. Beyond that, I'm afraid you're on your own.  
    England Prevails.
    
-   The David Lodge novel _Changing Places_ ends with one of the characters arguing that film is a superior medium to literature, because you can always see the end of a novel coming by the fact that the book is running out of pages. Movies have more potential for surprise, he argues, because they can end at any moment, sometimes with no explanation. As he is saying this, the book abruptly cuts him off in mid-sentence and ends.
    -   Just to drive the point home, the last chapter is written in the form of a movie script, while all the previous chapters had been done in normal prose.
-   _The Crying of Lot 49_ is about a woman who suspects she has discovered an enormous Ancient Conspiracy of mailmen. One of her clues is that an old stamp collection is up for auction, and she believes that - if the conspiracy is indeed real - someone will show up to bid on it very heavily. Looking at a program, she sees that the stamps have been designated as the 49th lot to be cried at auction. Not only are we cut off from The Reveal, but _The Crying of Lot 49_ ends seconds before the crying of lot 49.
-   Bret Easton Ellis's novel _The Rules of Attraction_, as noted above under the film adaptation, ends in mid-sentence on exactly the same two words it began with.
-   James Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_ also ends in mid-sentence, with the words "_Away at long at last the_" implying that the _real_ story is just about to begin.

    Live-Action TV 

-   At least one episode of _EastEnders_ had this happen unintentionally; the iconic closing drumbeats started playing while a character was still talking, drowning them out and effectively cutting them off mid-sentence.

-   The _Good Luck Charlie_ episode "Dress Mess" ends with the doctor about to tell Bob the gender of the soon-to-be-born fifth Duncan child, but it cuts right to the Vanity Plate before he finishes the sentence.
-   Used in the Spanish Inquisition episode of _Monty Python's Flying Circus_; when the three cardinals finally reach the courtroom where they are most definitely not expected, the screen goes black before Cardinal Ximenez can finish announcing their presence, prompting him to cut himself off with "Nobody expects - oh, bugger!"
-   The final scene of _Mimpi Metropolitan_ is Melani, after sending her scholarship application, calling Bambang to tell him something. What exactly is that something is not revealed as the scene is cut off by the ending quote.
-   Several seasons of _The Morecambe And Wise Show_ would end with a harmonica player walking onstage after the closing credits had rolled, and being cut off after playing a few notes.
-   In the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ episode "Doomed", when Spike discovers the chip in his head only prevents him from hurting humans:
    
    **Spike:** What’s this? Sitting around watching the telly while there’s evil still afoot. That’s not very industrious of you. I say we go out there and kick a little demon ass! What, can’t go without your Buffy? Is that it? Too chicken? Let’s find her! She is the Chosen One, after all. ... Come on! Vampires! Grrr! Nasty! Let’s annihilate them. For justice... and for... the safety of puppies – and Christmas, right? Let’s fight that evil! ... Let’s kill something! \[Fade to black.\] Oh, come on!
    
-   _The Sopranos_ finale "Made in America" infamously ended with the middle of the lyrics of "Don't Stop Believing" as part of its Gainax Ending.
    
    _Don't stop—_
    
-   The _Community_ episode "Pillows And Blankets" has a mock telethon for a closing credit tag. Troy tells the audience "We need the funds to keep up from getting pulled off the air which could literally happen at any..." Fade to black.
-   During one episode of _Top Gear_, the guys mentioned that they would be ending a minute early for a soccer match. During the end, Jeremy continued to ramble on while Richard and James begged him to stop while reminding him of the early ending. He says "What are they going to do? Cut us o..."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _WandaVision_ features an episode where Wanda attempts to weaponize this, ending an argument by rolling the credits while she says she's going off to bed. Vision refuses to end the argument, causing the credits to fizzle out.
-   _Just a Gigolo_: The final moment of the series has Natalie realize that she doesn't know what Nick does for a living. He's about to explain, but is cut off by the endboard before he can say the word "gigolo" (presumably - the series wasn't picked up for a second one).

    Music 

-   Subverted by Pink Floyd's _The Wall_: the last track ends with someone quietly (almost inaudibly) saying "Isn't this where...", while the similar first track starts with the same voice saying "...we came in?"
-   Kero Kero Bonito ends their album _Time 'n' Place_ with "Rest Stop", which abruptly ends before Sarah Bonito finishes her last line. Bear in mind, it's being delivered otherwise in complete silence following a climax of the most terrifyingly glitched-out and distorted sounds the band has ever conceived, so you're definitely meant to notice it — what it actually means is up to you.
    
    _So when we walk among the clouds  
    Hold your neighbour close  
    As the trumpets echo 'round  
    You don't wanna be_—

    Web Animation 

-   In the final episode of _Every Faggot Ever_, after being thrown into a cell, the black man in there asks the faggot what he's in for. The faggot can only force out the n-word, and the "FIN" screen cuts him off before he can finish it.
-   _Zero Punctuation_:
    -   The review of _50 Cent: Blood on the Sand_ sees Yahtzee regularly insisting that he isn't racist, going so far as to include "subliminal" messages about his lack of racism. He ends the review with an inspiring speech about how we should all put aside our differences and work together to build a better world. "Not that they'd know anything about work, the lazy nig—" \*CREDITS\*
    -   The review of _Mafia II_ ends with Yahtzee complaining about the game's own unsatisfying ending, and then provides a demonstration of what he's talking about:
        
        And the ending's a disappointment. Without wishing to spoil, it's like if _The Shawshank Redemption_ ended while Tim Robbins was still covered by poo in a pipe. After reaching the CRIME DOES NOT PAY phase of the standard mafia storyline, the game just sort of cuts out halfway through resolving everythi-\*CREDITS\*
        
    -   At the end of the review of _Babylon's Fall_ Yahtzee simply stopped caring about the game any further, admitting that he'd only reviewed it because his only alternative was _Shadow Warrior 3_, which was too short for a full review.
        
        **Viewer:** How short is it, Yahtz?  
        **Yahtzee:** Well, put it like this: it was—\*CREDITS\*
        
-   This is actually a Running Gag for _Dick Figures_. In many episodes characters that say the last sentence after a crazy amount of mishaps, they often get their speech interrupted at the end. However one of them is subverted in "Pussy Magnet" after this gem.
    
    **Red:** How'd it go?
    
    **Lord Tourettes:** (_Appearing from the side of the screen, giggling_) You know, all you really need is a biiig DI-
    
    (_Credits roll_)
    
    **Blue:** Figures...
    
-   _Homestar Runner_:
    -   In the very first Decemberween cartoon, Homestar Runner cuts off Strong Sad, claiming they're out of time, but a few seconds then pass before the end screen actually appears.
    -   Another animation called "Strong Bad is a Bad Guy", which is done on _Mario Paint_, has Strong Bad, Strong Mad, and The Cheat talking about tattoos, but they are all interrupted by Homestar Runner, who tells them about _his_ design for a perfect tattoo. When Strong Mad realizes that Homestar cannot have tattoos because of his lack of arms, he yells out "YOU DON'T HAVE AR-" but the episode ends.

    Webcomics 

-   A Running Gag in _Kid Radd_ is that The Hero of the "Kid Radd" video game has never been able to kiss his Damsel in Distress because the credits run just as he's about to do it.
-   _The Order of the Stick_: In "Rock the Vote", had Elan not complained about the verdict being interrupted by the end, it wouldn't have been (a fact that is, of course, lampshaded by Roy).

    Web Video 

-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_:
    -   In one episode, Bakura is about to begin some Bakura-style Fanservice — but to his dismay, the closing credits arrive and stop him.

    -   In a variation, in one episode Ishizu predicts that another guy will be interrupted by the opening credits.

        "What the hell are you talking ab—?"
        
-   RedLetterMedia's video game show _Previously Recorded_ ends every episode with an abrupt edit to the word "End" that fills the screen and often cuts someone off mid-sentence.

    Western Animation 

-   One episode of _Futurama_ had Zoidberg try to start up his own musical routine at the end (copying Hermes who had one earlier in the episode):
    
    **Zoidberg:** Now it's time for Zoidberg's song — _When I was two there was a tidal wave..._  
    (_Credits start_)  
    **Zoidberg:** Awww...
    
    -   Played with in another episode where Fry and Leela go on a private vacation where, unbeknownst to them, they're secretly in a zoo on a planet of intelligent apes being watched by hundreds. Amy, Zoidberg, and Bender become aware of this but, despite being angry after seeing footage of Fry and Leela bad-mouthing them behind their backs, decide to keep it a secret to spare their feelings. Then the two push their luck a little too far, Amy angrily gives permission to tell them the truth, and it fades to the end credits. Then abruptly cuts back to Bender screaming "YOU WERE IN A ZOO!!!" at a shocked Fry and Leela, and then cuts to the credits for real.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   At the end of the fourth-season episode "Homer The Heretic", Homer convinces God to tell him the meaning of life as they stroll through Heaven together. God gets as far as "The meaning of life is—" before the credits cut Him off. The writers thought that when the episode aired, the end would be immediately followed by a Fox promo (rather than just the credits). The idea was that the viewers would be pissed off by having a revelation from God being cut off by a promo. Ironically, on the episode's original broadcast Fox _didn't_ run a promo over the credits for once.
    -   Used in the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield," when Professor Frink showed up too late.
    -   "Pygmoelian" has Moe complain about the absurdity of the Reset Button: A prop wall fell on him, magically reversing the plastic surgery he underwent back to his original appearance.

    -   "You Kent Always Say What You Want" ends with Homer trying to tell Lisa an awful truth about Fox, only for his dialogue and Lisa's response to be dubbed over. When Homer protests against this, it immediately cuts to the 20th Century Fox logo, then to a white screen where he says "Okay, what I was going to say was-" before it cuts to the Gracie Films logo, and then the episode credits.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   Used in the episode "Krusty Krab Training Video". The episode documents the history of the Krusty Krab restaurant, safety and etiquette and the like, all dragging to finally how to make a Krabby Patty. As the narrator says "Okay! The secret formula i—", the episode cuts off. Many fans speculate the episode ends this way because, In-Universe, it is a fail-safe to protect the formula in the event Plankton gets his hands on the tape.
    -   Done in the very end of "SpongeBob's Big Birthday Blowout" when Patrick asks SpongeBob how old he is. SpongeBob responds with "Well, as of today, I am-" it then cuts to static and the episode ends.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _South Park_:
    -   In the episode "Here Comes The Neighborhood" Mr. Garrison convinces others in town to got rid of all the rich blacks, with methods such as burning a lowercase "t" on their lawns and scaring them by dressing as ghosts. At the end he states they can now become rich themselves by selling the homes only for the others to point out that what they did was meaningless since there will still be rich people. Garrison says "Well, at least we got rid of those damn ni—".
    -   The episode "Trapper Keeper" had Cartman constantly make fun of Kyle, who saves him in the end. When Stan demands Cartman to apologize, he utters "Kyle..." before the credits roll.

Eventually Goofy finally finds out that the national anthem is actually "Star-Spangled Banner", and is about to sing it only to find out that the episode is over. The episode ends with him singing the first few lyrics of the anthem, but is then cut off.
-   _Space Ghost Coast to Coast_ often ended this way. This was lampshaded in one episode when the show was hijacked by an angry fan, who among his demands wanted "at least one episode of Space Ghost to have a decent ending, not one that just is abruptly interrupted by the theme—" \*credits roll\*
-   _Family Guy_
    -   One episode doesn't feature Meg until the end. When she does appear, Brian says "Oh, hey, Meg. What did you get up to today?" Meg opens her arms to explain animatedly and a huge smile comes to her face...BAM. Credits.
    -   Happens again in one of the Thanksgiving specials centered around Kevin Swanson having deserted from his unit in Iraq. After the plot has settled and Joe and Kevin have made peace, a second Kevin shows up claiming that the other Kevin is an impostor. Peter says that he doesn't think they have time for that story, and is followed by the credits.
    -   After an episode has an All Just a Dream reveal, Brain questions Stewie on whether the audience might find that an unsatisfying cop-out. Stewie gets indignant and says "At least it's not like The Sopranos where they just cut to black in the middle of a sen—"
-   An early 50s Mighty Mouse cartoon has Pearl Pureheart in a predicament and Mighty Mouse in flight on his way to save her as the cartoon starts to Iris Out, as the narrator entreats us to catch the story next week.

    -   The episode "Magic Duel" ends with Pinkie Pie interrupting the Iris Out and pointing out she still doesn't have her mouth. Twilight comes in and restores Pinkie's mouth, and Pinkie inhales to speak... then the credits immediately start rolling.
-   When _Hilda_ becomes a troll at the end of "The Stone Forest", at the end of Season 2, Hilda is confused by this revelation and when she asks what's happening, the episode ends. Luckily, "Hilda and The Mountain King" is available for reading for those that are wanting to know the answer.
-   Dave from _Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts_ finally asking the obvious question about the three blind goat's cheese that no one else seemed to think about, only to be interrupted by the credits.
    
    **Dave:** Wait, where did you guys get the milk? (Cue end credits.)
    
-   The classic scene from the classic Daffy Duck cartoon "Duck Amuck," where Daffy pleads "Let's get this picture started!", only for the animator to iris the scene out and plant a "The End" card on screen. Averted in that this is not the end of the short as Daffy pushes the card off the screen and the madness continues.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_:

-   _Teen Titans Go!_: After the events of "Nostalgia Is Not A Substitute For An Actual Story", Robin begins to discuss the flaws he found with the Titans' adventure in the 80s. Cut to credits.

-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_: At the end of "One False Movie", Bloo is complaining about his movie losing the film festival, which Mac points out is because the movie had no ending (due to Eduardo taping over it with a show he was trying to watch).
