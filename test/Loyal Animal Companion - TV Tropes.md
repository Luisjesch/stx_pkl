Una and the lion, from Spenser's _Faerie Queen_

_"You were never masters, but friends. I was your friend.  
I loved you well, and was loved. Deep love endures  
To the end and far past the end. If this is my end,  
I am not lonely. I am not afraid. I am still yours."_

â€” **Robinson Jeffers**, "The House Dog's Grave"

Ah, the loyal, lovable, non-human friend. For whatever reason these dutiful companions will follow their (usually) human friend just about anywhere. Sometimes it be magic, other times merely loyalty. In any event, everybody loves pets that know how to kick ass.
