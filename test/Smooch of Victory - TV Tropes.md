_"It's time I gave you a proper thank-you! Pucker up, handsome!"_

_"My hero! \*mwah!\*"_

Some men quest for glory, fame, and riches. Some men seek power and strength. Some want To Be a Master.

And some guys just want a kiss from the princess they're trying to save.

For some strange reason, princesses and other Love Interests seem to love giving out kisses as rewards for helping them. The smooch of victory is a standard part of the Rescue Romance, but it can appear in almost any scenario where a guy has the potential to impress a girl—either by winning a contest, saving her from a horrible beast, recovering her purse from thugs, or whatever the plot writers think up. The scenario generally goes like this:

1.  Alice is in trouble. Bob vows to help her. Alternatively, Bob is entering a contest. He vows to win for Alice's sake.
2.  Bob overcomes obstacles, goes through many trials, and goes through hell and back for Alice. He eventually saves Alice or reaches his goal.
3.  Alice says to Bob, "Oh, Bob! How can I _ever_ thank you?"
4.  Alice then proceeds to show Bob _exactly_ how she can thank him by giving him lipstick imprints right on the face.
5.  If this is Bob's first Big Damn Heroes moment, it will often result in Post-Kiss Catatonia.

May also occur in an After-Action Patch-Up, in which case she may merely acknowledge his courage first — or may berate him for stupidly getting into the matter first.

Usually, Bob is a Nice Guy, and he's perfectly content with receiving a kiss as his reward. If he's lucky, he might even get a full-on make-out session with the girl he just helped. If he's not... well, even a chaste kiss on the cheek is pretty sweet. Sometimes, though, Bob might be a lech who's only trying to help the girl in the hopes of lockin' lips with her. Thus, this is one of those frequently invoked tropes.

The most common ways to play with this trope are to have the kiss-ee _not_ want the kiss, for some reason, and try his darndest not to get it. Alternatively, if he goes into the rescue or competition _expecting_ a kiss, the girl at the other end may well refuse to give him one. The question of why it's desired if it's out of obligation, and thus doesn't actually mean anything, may not be addressed. A growing number of examples exists where both parties are the same sex, if only for the sake of a quick joke.

Note that in many historical settings, kissing an eligible member of the opposite sex is Serious Business; it may go all the way up to being tantamount to a marriage proposal.

Sometimes it might be unplanned or the victory coincides with the resolving of their UST. When prefaced with aggression, it's Slap-Slap-Kiss.

One of the most popular methods of Ship Teasing. Can overlap with The Big Damn Kiss if Rescue Romance is involved.

If the smooch is given by a damsel after being rescued from sexual assault, they Got Over Rape Instantly

See The VJ Day Kiss for a Real Life example. Compare Standard Hero Reward, Rescue Sex, Rescue Romance, Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex, Sealed with a Kiss. The direct opposite of "Take That!" Kiss.

-   In _Sheep's Clothing_ Doc receives a delayed one from Sarah, but it's only delayed only because he was in and out of consciousness for two weeks after the final battle.
-   _Reign of the Seven Spellblades_: Played for laughs in volume 1 when Chela decides Oliver hasn't been congratulated enough for his part in saving the day earlier, and tries to kiss him on the cheek.

The crowd of bystanders start chanting: "Kiss! Kiss!" and Bradley eagerly leans in for one only to Talk to the Hand.
-   _Black Mirror_: Used quite cleverly (and creepily) in "USS Callister". The antagonist of the story, incel loser game designer Robert Daly, makes digital clones of his co-workers act as crewmembers in a Game Mod based on his favourite TV show (an ersatz _Star Trek_) where he is the captain, and subjects them to threats, humiliation and abuse if they don't play to the script. At the end of each gaming session, as a reward for "saving the day" and a power play over the crew, he forces every female crewmember to give him a smooch. Lowry and Elena are quick to stress to newcomer Nanette that the kisses are closed mouth and never involve tongues - in fact every crewmember has Barbie Doll Anatomy, so Daly doesn't use them for sex. This is to hint at Daly's arrested development.

-   Many _Match Game_ contestants got to kiss the celebrity with whom they won the big money (the head-to-head part of the Super Match)—opposite sex, naturally. They were usually polite, quick kisses, but some celebrities like Patty Duke Astin and Debralee Scott were known to ramp it up.

-   _Person of Interest_. In "Prisoner's Dilemma", Detective Fusco (normally the series Butt-Monkey) has to protect that week's POI while the others get Reese out of jail. We never see what happens exactly, but it ends with Fusco being kissed by supermodel Karolína Kurková after he saves her life from Armenian gangsters. Some days are obviously better than others.

-   Hilariously, at the climax "A Fistful of Datas" in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, Worf is clearly horrified at the thought he's about to get one from a saloon girl whom the holodeck has given Data's face. The look of desperation on his face as he kept telling the computer to end the simulation _**now**_ is something to behold.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_. In "Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy", the holographic Doctor has Dream Sue fantasies where he saves Voyager with his amazing heroics and is desired by every woman in the crew. At the end of the episode the Doctor has saved the ship for real, so his unrequited crush Seven of Nine gives him a peck on the cheek, though she makes it clear it's only a platonic gesture.
-   In the Mirror Universe episode of _Star Trek: Enterprise_, Captain Archer plans to use the over-whelming power of the U.S.S Defiant to seize control of the Terran Empire, only to be poisoned on the brink of victory by his Hot Consort, Hoshi Sato. The last thing he sees before passing out is Hoshi kissing his bodyguard, Tavis Mayweather. Hoshi goes on to become Empress, which is worth celebrating with a snog on any day!

    -   "Scoobynatural", the crossover with _Scooby-Doo_, concludes its animated part with Velma planting The Big Damn Kiss on Sam after the mystery is wrapped up (at least the way it was intended as it was a deconstruction/reconstruction of a _Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!_ episode).
-   Josh and Donna's first kiss on _The West Wing_ was one of these.

    Pro Wrestling

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Monster Manual for _Dungeons & Dragons_ 3.5E says that succubae are known for exploiting this trope. They steal life energy through kisses so any reason to plant one on an unsuspecting adventurer is worth using.

    Theatre 

-   In _Albert Herring_, Albert, after making his big Shaming the Mob speech and shrugging off their attempts to shame him, receives a big kiss from Nancy, even though she never was his Love Interest. Sid, her actual boyfriend, protests: "Hi! That's _my_ girl!"

    Video Games 

-   There are several in the _The Legend of Zelda_ series
    -   _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_ and the linked ending of _The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games_ end with Zelda giving a kiss to Link.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening_, Link gets a kiss from Madam MeowMeow after rescuing her Chain Chomp dog. The kiss will refill Link's hearts.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_, you would normally get the blue Zora's Tunic by saving King Zora, but you can also buy it. Why you'd want to do this when you can get it for _free_ isn't obvious, but if you do, he'll try to give Link a kiss instead. Yes, the _king._ Link never says anything, of course, but he quite obviously adamantly refuses—the king seems disappointed.
    -   Subverted in the CD-i games. The CD-i games are based on the cartoon series where Link will repeatedly try and fail to get a kiss from Zelda. After Ganon is defeated:
        
        **Gwonam**: You, Link, are the hero of Koridai!  
        **Link**: I guess that's worth a kiss, huh?  
        **Zelda**: Hah!
        
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Princess Peach has given more than one to Mario, to the point where it's considered tradition. In some of the games, if you beat the game using Luigi, she'll give one to Luigi as well.
    -   In _Paper Mario 64_ Goombaria gives one to Mario as a reward for finding her doll. He shudders.
    -   In _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_:
        -   Goombella gives one to Mario for helping her escape the X-Nauts in Rogueport.
        -   Vivian gives one to Mario for helping her find the Superbombomb.
        -   Attempted defiance in the second chapter: Portly cloud spirit Flurrie offers to give Mario "a little sugar" for finding her necklace. Mario refuses (as much as a Heroic Mime can obviously refuse, anyway), but the poor plumber gets a face full of lipstick anyway. She almost does a Foe-Tossing Charge to get to him, too. His partners at the time are pushed out of the way and lie dizzy on the floor while she smooches Mario.
    -   Even _Wario_ gets one in _Wario Land 4_, complete with his own princess.
    -   Defied in _Wario Land: Shake It!_ where Wario, who's way more interested in the treasure than the princess, tosses her out of his way before she even finishes her congratulatory speech.
    -   _Super Mario RPG_ features a mini-game that uses this trope straight and averts it. In the Marrymore Wedding Chapel, Mario teams up with Bowser to save Princess Toadstool (Peach) from being married to the hairy Wario-like Booster. Toadstool expresses her admiration by promising him a kiss, something that both Bowser and Booster cannot tolerate. Depending on your performance, you are rewarded with a kiss from Peach... or Bowser... or Booster... or _both_.
-   In _Maximo: Ghosts to Glory_, each time you rescue a sorceress, you can choose a "kiss" as your reward. It occupies a valuable slot in your powerup menu, but if you carry all four kisses to the end of the game, you unlock a concept art gallery.
-   Lynn in _Summon Night: Swordcraft Story 2_ offers one (or several) to the main character _regardless of the main character's gender._
-   _Resident Evil 4_, where Ashley Graham offers to "do some overtime" with Leon after he rescues her. It doesn't take long for him to decide to say no.
-   An optional action in _King's Quest III_ after rescuing Rosella. It also shows up in _King's Quest II_ (Graham and Valanice), _King's Quest VI_ (Alexander and Cassima), and _King's Quest VII_ (Edgar and Rosella).
-   In _Chibi-Robo!_, Mrs. Sanderson gives one to Mr. Sanderson after he and Chibi defeat all the mega Spydorz and the Queen Spydor, leading to an Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other moment.
-   _Castle Crashers_ features this no less than three times. It is taken to new levels of Victory by the fact that the winning Knight has to _fight his fellow Knights_ to win her kiss!
-   _Spelunky_:
    -   This is the player's reward for rescuing damsels trapped in the caves, and on a good run you might get half a dozen kisses. Each one happens to give you extra health. There are also, however, "kissing parlors" where you can pay for a kiss with the same healing effects, apparently under duress since they also reward you if you "rescue" them from there.
    -   In the upgraded rerelease, the damsels can be replaced with "mansels" (males dressed in nothing but a full body ribbon) or "pugsels" (dogs).
-   Kirby receives one from Ribbon in _Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards_, causing him to swoon.
-   _Beyond Good & Evil_ has a rare male-on-female example. Double H attempts to give one to the heroine Jade after she wins the hovercraft racing championship. Jade is not amused.

-   In _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game_, the Turtle who saves April gets a kiss on the snout from her, complete with Lipstick Mark.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_:
    -   Both titular characters get kissed by Angela when they beat the final boss of _Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando_.
    -   The next game, _Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal_, has Ratchet kissed twice by Sasha. The first time is after he, Klunk, and Skrunch escape from the Dreadnaught Leviathan when it self-destructed. The second is at the end, at the premier of the latest Secret Agent Clank movie. Skrunch saw this, and also tried to kiss Clank.
        
        **Clank:** Do not even think about it.
        
-   _Final Fantasy IX_ - Averted when Zidane rescues Princess Garnet from the crumbling castle. She hugs him very warmly, but never actually kisses him.
-   The _Dragon Age_ series:
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins_: The Player Character can request this reward a couple of times throughout the game, such as:
        -   In Redcliffe, Kaitlyn will give the hero a very chaste kiss on the cheek for finding her brother Bevin, and will make said brother cover his eyes in embarrassment
        -   Bella the barmaid will give the hero a big smooch if you ask for a “hero's welcome” after saving the village, or if you give her enough cash to quit her job at Lloyd's tavern, which will leave every drunk in the tavern gaping in wide-eyed surprise.
    -   In _Dragon Age II_, you can take a sidequest off your companion Isabela, and one dialogue option is to ask if you can get a kiss if you do it. She seems amused by the idea and says you can 'even pick where you want it."
-   Done in the Golden Ending of _Kid Icarus_, following a Plot-Relevant Age-Up.
-   The arcade version of _Double Dragon_ provides a bit of a twist. Normally if one player completes the game, then he will get kissed by Marian (the kidnapped girl). However, if two players defeat the final boss together, the game will force both of them to fight each other until only one remains to claim Marian for himself.
-   _Joe & Mac_ has each Damsel in Distress do this, providing After Boss Recovery.
-   Smurfette does this to Smurf as his reward for her rescue in the Atari 2600 version of _Smurf: Rescue In Gargamel's Castle_ and in Infogrames' _The Smurfs (1994)_.
-   In _Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose!_, after Buster beats the final boss, Babs gushes about how great he is, then offers him one of these. Buster doesn't seem interested at all, and Plucky intervenes to stop the whole thing.
-   This trope is the reason that, unlike the other _Ultima_ games built on the same engine, _Worlds of Ultima: Savage Empire_ only gives you the option to play a blonde white male. They only prepared one cutscene for the princess's rescue and ensuing kiss, so your character had to match it exactly (and a Gay Option was unlikely in 1990).
-   At the end of _Earthworm Jim_, Princess What's-Her-Name awaits and offers to give the titular hero one of these... Unfortunately the cow you launched at the very beginning of the game squashes her and ruins the whole thing... But hey, at least Jim got to take her crown!
-   There's this mod of _Stardew Valley_ in which the bachelor or bachelorette the player romances gives one of these to the farmer during the Community Center restoration ceremony.
-   Beat the Game Boy port of _The Tower of Druaga_ with four or less continues and you’ll get a cute picture of Ki kissing Gil on the cheek.
-   In _Mass Effect 2_, provided they were in a romance in the previous game and Shepard has remained committed, Shepard and Liara can have one near the end of _Lair of the Shadow Broker_ DLC after defeating the Shadow Broker, one that also represents them reigniting their relationship after two years.
-   _Tropical Angel_: Passing the master class leads to the girl giving you a congratulatory kiss, complete with an icon.

-   In _American Barbarian_, for Rick.
-   Played with in _Magick Chicks_.

    -   In a weird variant in "Evicted", Marceline kisses Finn after he fights a gigantic monster bat. The thing is, _she_ was the gigantic monster bat, and it wasn't so much a "smooch of victory" as a "smooch of her giving up because she's decided he's a Worthy Opponent."

    Real Life 

-   The victory over Japan kiss in Times Square is a gender inversion; the sailor saw and impulsively kissed her, and a photographer happened to capture it. Such kisses happened all over the country on that day.
-   This can be a fairly nasty trope when applied to Real Life, as demanding a kiss as a price before saving someone is G-rated Sexual Extortion.
-   When Georgiana Cavendish, the Duchess of Devonshire, canvassed for the election of her lover Charles Fox in 1784, it was famously reported and satirized that she offered men kisses in exchange for their votes.
