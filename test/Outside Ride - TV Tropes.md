_"About this time, someone is telling you to get on the plane. 'Get on the plane, get on the plane!' I say 'Fuck you, I'm getting_ in _the plane! Let Evel Knievel get_ on _the plane! I'll be in here with you folks in uniform. There seems to be less_ wind _in here!'"_

Just because the car's locked doesn't mean you can't go along for the ride. Just hop on top or side of the car, and hold on.

This is popular in many cop shows; our hero can be counted on to leap to the roof of a speeding getaway car at least once per season. Alternatively, he can jump onto the hood and glare at the driver while said driver tries to shake him off. Larger vehicles can also be used (particularly popular version is jumping onto a tall vehicle from an overhead bridge) — if it's a truck, for example, our Hero will often need to climb forward to the cab somehow. (You can also climb about on trains, but they're a bit different since they don't swerve about.)

Busted by the MythBusters, who found it much less safe in reality than on the screen.

For example, in Real Life it is incredibly difficult to hold on to a car even at low speeds, and at high speeds it is impossible to do so. It may be slightly easier to hold on to a train, but all of your effort has to be spent in _just_ holding on _and_ you have to be on top of a car that isn't rounded or containing hot liquids — plus, tunnels can cut too close to the roof for a standing person to survive passing through one. Aircraft — at least when we're talking jets, spacecraft, or anything that is flying at a sufficiently high speed and altitude — are literally impossible to stand on the outside of, and doing so is certain death.

Two variant forms have become outdated with modern car designs, but may be seen in older media. For a stealth Outside Ride, jump onto the back bumper and hold on tight (the technical term is Skitching). This is often a convenient way for the hero to get to the villain's hideout. A more obvious method would be to stand on the running board, though if the driver's not paying attention you might be able to crouch underneath the window before he sees you.

See also: Hood Hopping, Traintop Battle, Underside Ride. Punk in the Trunk (the second option) is a more modern version of riding on the back bumper, which isn't to say characters in older works can't do it. May precede a High Speed Hijacking.

(This was in the Golden Age before she'd been upgraded with the power of flight by later writers.)
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Golden Age Diana _and_ Steve Trevor spend an awful lot of time hanging out on the Amazonian stealth plane's wings or dangling from its ladder while it's in flight, usually to try to catch, give a hand to or lasso someone.

In the sequel _Magnum Force_ a mobster trying to escape a police raid speeds out in a getaway car and Harry clings to the hood of it.
-   The running board version is seen in _Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze_, with Doc pointing dramatically as he stands on the running board (in the rain no less) as the Fabulous Five drive off to take on the villains who've killed Doc's father.

-   In _GI Joe The Rise Of Cobra_, Snake Eyes does this on the approach to the Eiffel Tower.
-   Constantly in _The Gods Must Be Crazy_.

Not too surprising as it's set in Africa where riding on top of a car is not uncommon.

        -   There's also the submarine incident of questionable plausibility, in which Indy somehow _rides a submarine_ across the Mediterranean.
    -   Indy also clings to the front of a speeding mine cart in _Temple of Doom_, braking it with the sole of his boot.
    -   Then there's the extended action sequence in _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ that takes place in, on and around a tank.
-   _The Invisible Man (1933)_ has the eponymous character follow his target this way. Made easier by the fact that, well, he's invisible. Ignore the fact that he's also naked in the middle of winter hanging onto the side of a speeding car...
-   _James Bond_ runs into this a bit, as one might expect:
    -   In _From Russia with Love_, after leaving the stopped Orient Express with Tatiana Romanov, Bond grabs onto the rail of a car and rides it for a hundred yards or so, to a point on the other side of the tracks from where Grant's contact is waiting for him.
    -   At the end of _Live and Let Die_, Baron Samedhi is seen riding on the front end of a train locomotive after he was killed by poisonous snakes earlier in the movie. Badass indeed.
    -   In _Octopussy_, Bond leaps from a horse onto the twin-engine aircraft Kamal is using to escape. Once he's gained some height Kamal loops the plane to throw Bond off the roof (fortunately there are some handy rails for Bond to hold onto) and thinks he's succeeded until he sees Bond yanking out the wires on one of the engines.
        
        **Kamal:** Got out there and get him!

-   _Mad Max_:
    -   _Mad Max_. Toecutter's gang steal fuel from a tanker-truck while it's on the move by waiting till it's slowed to drive up a steep road, pole-vaulting onto the tanker, then running a hose off the back.
    -   Coupled with Traintop Battle in _Mad Max: Fury Road_. Many fight scenes involve characters hopping onto the War Rig to hijack the truck. And of course, this is just one of the things that makes the Doof Warrior even more awesome. Playing a flamethrower/guitar hybrid is cool enough, but it's even more awesome when it's on top of a speeding truck.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   _Captain America: The First Avenger_—When _doesn't_ Cap take advantage of this trope? Taxicab, personal submarine, speeding train, drone aircraft...

    -   Black Panther does this in both _Civil War_ and his solo movie.
    -   In the Action Prologue of _Black Widow (2021)_, Red Guardian gives covering fire against SHIELD agents while lying on the wing of the light aircraft his sleeper cell "family" are using to escape to Cuba. And then continues clinging onto the wing for the entire flight, which started in _Ohio_. Much as his character is played for laughs later in the film, the scene shows what he was capable of in his prime.
-   _The Matrix Reloaded_: An upgraded Agent jumps onto the hood of a car from another car, and just stands there while the car swerves back and forth. There is also a full-scale kung fu battle on the top of a semi truck, brought to an abrupt end when it slams into another truck head-on.

    -   _Mission: Impossible III_: Ethan and Lindsey escape by jumping down to the van Luther is in and hanging on to the roof while Luther drives away.
    -   _Mission: Impossible – Fallout_: Ethan spends some time clinging to netting on the outside of aircraft.
-   _The Mummy_: How do four people ride on a two-seater biplane? Answer: Two in the seats and one on each lower wing. Of course, it probably wasn't moving when they got on it. And if you look closely they _are_ tied to the wings.
-   In _Mercenaries_, Clay jumps on to the back of the truck carrying the missiles before jumping off to ambush the drivers when they stop.

-   In _Phantom of the Mall: Eric's Revenge_, mall guard Christopher Volker attacks Melody and Peter at gunpoint as they talk, in a car, about the fire; he boasts that he is the arsonist. As they escape and Volker chases them with his car, Eric leaps onto the roof, distracting him and causing a crash.
-   In _Platoon_, the soldiers arriving to the carnage scene at the end of the film ride atop their M113 personnel carrier, not inside. Justified, since this was the usual practise in the Vietnam War.
-   The first _Police Academy_ introduces Fackler as he's having a spat with his wife. She's begging him not to join the police force due to how accident prone he is.

-   Subverted in _Red (2010)_. CIA agent William Cooper is trying to warn the Secret Service they've fallen for a Not My Driver trick while they're hell-bent on driving their charge away as quickly as possible. He leaps onto the roof in a suitably badass manner, slides down the back window with a silly expression on his face (as he's pressed against the glass), makes a futile attempt to get the Service agents to stop, then gets thrown off when the limo abruptly turns a corner.
-   _Reform School Girls_: After she steals the bus, Charlie kicks out the windscreen and climbs out on to the roof, while the bus is still driving.
-   In _Revolver (1973)_, one of the police officers who stumbles across Carlotta's truck at the service station grabs the bar at the front when Vito drives off.

-   _Sheitan_: After Joseph is out the broken window of Ladj's car, he somehow turns up on the roof: trying to stab down through it.
-   _Spider-Man_: Spider-Man pulls it off in the first movie. Justified, since he "does whatever a spider can", being sticking to surfaces, like a car roof. A hold-over from the comic book; Spidey frequently hitched unwitting vehicles when traveling through places with low overhead or few to no skyscrapers.
-   _Star Wars_: In _Attack of the Clones_, Anakin hangs on to the outside of Bounty Hunter Zam Wessell's enclosed speeder during part of the Coruscant chase sequence, after jumping out of his and Obi-Wan's speeder.
-   In _The Sting_, Hooker runs out of a diner, across the street and out of camera view, while escaping from two of Lonnegan's thugs.

-   _Major Crimes_: In "Four of a Kind", Flynn is attempting to pull a suspect out of her vehicle when she slams it into gear and accelerates. Flynn manages to cling to the door for some distance before she slams on the brakes and throws him off.
-   _Mayday_: The captain of British Airways Flight 5390 goes through this when a blown-out windshield leads to him getting sucked out of the cockpit and pinned to the fuselage.
-   _MythBusters_: In addition to the test referred to in the trope description, Jamie once took an Outside Ride on a speedboat. During their preliminary testing for the motorcycle water ski myth, the rig they'd mounted to the stern of the boat was too heavy, so Jamie climbed onto the bow to play counterweight.
    -   The build team also confirmed the "tennis on a plane's wing" video linked in the Advertising section. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _The New Avengers_: In "Dead Men are Dangerous", Gambit leaps on the back of a fleeing car. He gets thrown off but manages to pull off the number plate as he goes.
-   In a season 3 episode of _Primeval_, Danny does this in an attempt to escape some hungry terror birds.
-   The _Rescue 911_ episode "Bumper Baby" reenacts an improbable Real Life story of a two-year-old clinging for dear life to the back of her dad's box truck as he drives it down the highway not knowing she's there. Amazingly, she is able to hold on for several miles before he pulls over.

-   In an earlier episode of _Shake it Up_, Cece gets herself and Rocky stuck dancing on the wing of an airborne plane. In a later episode, Rocky expresses to Cece that she is not happy about it.
-   During the climax of the _Starsky & Hutch_ episode "A Long Walk Down a Short Dirt Road," both guys cling to the outside of the Torino, which the villain is trying to use as a getaway vehicle.
-   _Star Wars_

    -   Skitching is used by Din Djarin in the final episode of _The Book of Boba Fett_. Peli Motto arrives in the middle of a battle as passenger in a droid-pulled rickshaw. Din shouts at her to get the hell out of there, then clings to the back of the rickshaw as the droid shoots off as fast as possible to escape a pursuing Spider Tank.
-   _T.J. Hooker_ is notorious for the aggressive stunts Hooker pulls on duty like leaping onto vehicles.
-   _Wonder Woman_: Wonder Woman does this several times. For example:
    -   In "Anschluss 77", Lynda Carter personally did this with a _helicopter_ without safety gear. The producers were not happy about their star risking herself like that.
    -   In "Mind Stealers from Outer Space - Part 1", Wonder Woman leaps onto the hood of a car being driven by possessed teenagers leading to capturing one of them.
-   In the episode "Real Time" of _Workaholics_, the guys are trying to get to work in a hurry, but are too drunk to drive. Adam dons rollerblades and when the gang goes to get on a bus, he tries to hang on the back to be skitching. The guys talk him out of it, and later he tries it anyway with Alice's car. She promptly backs up into him.
-   Featured once on _World's Dumbest..._ with people in India holding on to a train as part of their morning commute.

    Music Videos 

-   The Romanian pop band O-zone dances on the wings of a plane in flight, in the Music Video for "Dragostea Din Tei" (aka the Numa Numa song).

    Pinballs 

-   The protagonist of _Airborne Avenger_ does this while Sky Surfing on his one-man jet-sled.
-   A scene in _Lights... Camera... Action!_ shows two of the film's characters hanging from the railing of an airborne helicopter.
-   _Time Machine (Data East)_ has a fifties-era football jock clinging to the outside of the time car as it drives through history.
-   The sides of the cabinet for _Vacation America_ show one of the kids hanging onto a rope as the family wagon drives off.
-   In _Aerosmith_, the visuals for the mode "Last Child" depict the band performing on top of their tour van as it's moving.

    Roleplay 

-   Led to one of the most memorable sequences in _Dino Attack RPG_. The heist on Dacta Corp.'s just gone horribly wrong, and the two survivors have to get away with the plans they were trying to steal... while the assassin who responsible for killing the others is right on top of their car. Cue intense chase as Montoya has to navigate a freeway while simultaneously trying to help his partner shake her off- They only got away because she believed them dead when the car veered off the road and caught fire, when in actuality they managed to escape when she left just before the blaze.

    Video Games 

-   _Battlefield 1942_ lets you do this ON AN AIRPLANE.
-   _Bayonetta_ absolutely _loves_ this trope. Cars, planes, missiles, trains, Bayonetta rides 'em all. The second game even begins with Bayonetta fighting angels atop a jet fighter.
-   Bandit runner patrols in _Borderlands_ have a driver, a gunner, and two Psychos hanging on the outside.
-   In _Bully_, while riding a skateboard you can latch onto the bumpers of cars to get around town more easily.
-   In the intro cinematic for _Dead Island 2_, Jacob is seen sneaking onto the evacuation flight by hitching a ride on the landing gear until he can climb up into the baggage area.
-   In _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_, Dante surfs on a missile.
-   In the first _Drakengard_ you can unlock a jet plane for Caim to use and he decides to be a man and ride on the outside of it.
-   After the first boss battle in _Final Fantasy VII_, and the homage sequence in _Crisis Core_.
-   _Grand Theft Auto_:
    -   Doable in _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ though not for long in the case of airplanes. One mission has motor officers jump from their motorbikkes and land on the hood to engage you with Good Old Fisticuffs. At the end of the mission, one officer managed to survive by jumping on top of the car's hood but has to recover from the impact, and, before he can jump out, is quickly dispatched by a Helicopter Blender.
    -   In _GTA IV_ and _V_, if you carjack someone, there's a chance that they will try to fight back. Speed away, and they will grab onto the car's door handle, getting dragged down the road until they finally lose grip.
-   In _inFAMOUS_, you can do this by hopping on a moving car, even though the creators didn't intend on you doing so.
-   _Just Cause_ lets you do this; in its improved sequel, you can even hop around on top of a moving car, leaning around to avoid being shot at. You can also deploy your parachute to take to the air.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_, during the Cerberus coup, Kai Leng leaps onto and _runs around on top of_ Shepard's skycar in order to get to a position where he can sabotage it.
-   Another train example would be the intro and ending of _Mega Man 4_.
-   Just like Dante above, Solid Snake goes missile-surfing in _Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes_.
-   Every zombie in _Road of the Dead_ is capabile of this: hitting a zombie too slowly will knock it onto your windshield rather than run it over, the sequel's 'grub' zombies will crawl up the front of your humvee if you run them over, and mutants will always cling to the hood/bonnet no matter how hard you hit them, and in the sequel can grapple the Player Characters from the sides.
-   It's easier to do by accident than on purpose in _Saints Row 2_, as most impacts, even minor bumps, send the target flying. But climbing on the roof of a stopped vehicle activates a car surfing minigame.
-   _The Simpsons Hit & Run_ has a "surfing" animation when you're on the roof of a moving car.
-   _Skitchin'_ was a Genesis game where you would hitch rides on the bumpers of cars while on your inline skates.
-   In _Sonic The Hedgehog_, Sonic and Tails have a regularly used biplane called "The Tornado". Tails flies the thing from a regular seat. Sonic prefers to ride it by _standing on the wings._
-   Fox does this several times in _Star Fox: Assault_, riding on the wing of another ship while shooting things with a powerful energy bazooka. Subverted in that the ship has to fly very slowly and carefully when he's riding it: if they were to perform the maneuvers they usually do, he'd fall off immediately. This carries over into the _Super Smash Bros._ arenas based on _Star Fox_ games, where everyone runs and jumps on the wings as easily as on stationary surfaces.
-   Other examples from _Super Smash Bros._:
    -   The Big Blue stage in _Melee_ and _Brawl_ has characters fighting on _all_ of the F-Zero cars as ther race. Falling on the track itself is near-instant death.
    -   In _Brawl_, Meta Ridley is fought on top of the Falcon Flyer in the Subspace Emissary mode.
        -   This is later turned into a standalone stage, Sand Ocean, in _Super Smash Flash 2_.
-   In _Syndicate_ (2012), Agent Kilo jumps onto an enemy dropship from a Manhattan skyscraper and rides it all the way back to its origin point, a floating city in the middle of the Caribbean Sea.
-   _Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4_ introduces skitching, which allows the player to hold on to the rear bumper of a car (just like in _Back to the Future_) for a speed boost and some extra points.
-   In _Ubersoldier 2_, one mission sees you infiltrating a Nazi armored train by clinging on the engine of an Allied aircraft and jumping before landing on the train's back. The same stage sees you climbing on the sides of the train to avoid wnemy fire. You _are_ a Super-Soldier, after all.
-   The Manta in _Unreal Tournament 2004_ can be used in this manner - let a pair of teammates hop onto the fans, and (at least until the physics wonk out enough to force them off) they can hitch a ride on the fastest vehicle in the game. _Unreal Tournament III_ removed this ability, but also added hoverboards and grappling hooks to let vehicles drag you around partially because this was too useful an exploit to just get rid of outright.
-   Some more train examples happen in _Wario Land II_ and _Wario Land: Shake It!_.

    Web Comics 

    Web Videos 

-   In _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_, Captain Hammer jumps onto a moving car this way. Nathan Fillion even mentions it in his song "Better Than Neil" in _Commentary! The Musical_.

    Western Animation 

-   _Batman: The Animated Series_ has quite a few examples—some particularly notable ones are:
    -   In "See No Evil", Batman grabs onto the roof of a car rendered invisible by Applied Phlebotinum to prevent the (also invisible) driver from kidnapping his (the driver's) estranged daughter. The whole thing comes crashing past through an alley, leading a witness (who only sees Batman zooming along about four feet off the ground) to remark, "I didn't know he could fly..."
    -   In "Beware the Creeper", the madcap final chase has Batman clinging to the Joker's car (which is being driven by the Creeper) as Robin follows on a wheeled platform attached to the car with a grapple line. This becomes particularly hair-raising when the Creeper starts trying controls at random and fires the car's rear missiles.
-   In the _Batman Beyond_ episode "Black Out", Inque sneaks into the Batcave by covering and blending with the outer surface of the Batmobile.
-   _Ben 10: Alien Force_: In the few times Julie fights without using Ship as Powered Armor, she stands on top of him in spaceship form while he mows down entire squadrons. Ship presumably has some kind of artificial gravity to prevent her from falling off or suffering motion sickness.
-   In the _Dilbert_ animated series, riding Business Class on Elbonia Airlines apparently entails sitting on the wing of the plane.
-   _Fillmore!_: In "Codename: Electric Haircut", Fillmore clings to the back of the stolen lockers as they are being driven away, before climbing over the top to perform a High-Speed Hijack.
-   Once on _The Flintstones_, Fred and Barney had to take the cheapest seats available on a plane, which meant sitting on the wing.
-   In the Mr. Magoo cartoon "When Magoo Flew", Magoo mistakes a plane for a movie theater. At one point he steps outside and walks along the wing, complaining that the air conditioner is on too high.
-   In one episode of _Rocky and Bullwinkle_, Rocky flies a jet plane to catch a falling Bullwinkle, who grabs onto the plane's tail. He holds on so tightly that he leaves hand imprints in the tail.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: In "The Protector of Concord Dawn", Kanan ends up hanging onto the outside of Fenn Rau's starfighter all the way into the upper atmosphere while attempting to prevent Rau from escaping. So Kanan disables the fighter by slashing at the engine, before making his way to the cockpit and capturing Rau in time for the _Phantom_ to catch up so he can jump aboard.
-   _Star Wars Resistance_:
    -   "The Triple Dark": During a pirate attack, Kaz is blasted into the air and, along with diminutive Aleena conman Grevel, who's hanging onto his ankle, winds up briefly clinging to the ship of pirate leader Kragan, before they eventually fall back to the Colossus.
    -   "The Core Problem": Kaz and Poe escape the Colossus with the latter riding on the outside of the _Fireball_.
-   In _The Transformers_ episode "A Plague of Insecticons" where the episode-namer Insecticons used lightning to down the Autobots, they found the lightning-based attacks are nulled with the rubber on the tires of their vehicle mode. Optimus Prime and Wheeljack (team's tech-head) both rode a pair of teammates in vehicle form whilst firing their weapons. It's probably simpler to coordinate this stunt when everyone involved is a robot.
-   _Wacky Races_: When Dick Dastardly decides to impersonate a wild west outlaw who looks like him, he has some scenes where he rides his car while Muttley drives it.
-   In one episode of _Yogi's Space Race_, the prize for winning the race was a trip on a space plane. As usual for this show, there was a twist to the prize that made it not worth winning: In this case, the trip was _on_ the space plane, rather than _in_ the space plane.
-   _What If...?_: In "What If… Captain Carter Were The First Avenger?", Captain Carter hitches rides on the back of the HYDRA Stomper to move to where her missions take her and Steve, as well as to attack German planes in mid-air.

    Real Life 

-   At least one 1920's bank robber favored involuntary Outside Rides — he would put a solid row of hostages on his getaway car's running boards until he got out of town.
-   Lieutenant Paavo Kahla, Finnish Air Force, in WWII. He was an observer-gunner on Fokker C.X reconnaissance plane. During a mission, his pilot, 2/Lt Mannermaa, got killed by flak. Kahla noticed, and instead of parachuting (and becoming a POW) he climbed _outside_ the observer's seat along the fuselage of the Fokker onto the lap of the dead pilot, assuming the controls. He then flew the plane safely to base, saving himself, the aircraft and the photos. For his insane bravery, he was rewarded the highest Finnish decoration, the Mannerheim Cross.
-   Unfortunately, teenagers + booze + cars can equal Truth in Television for this trope. It normally ends with a trip to the hospital (or morgue), since they never add in safety harnesses.
-   Real Life: The remora, a fish that uses a suction cup on its head to hitch rides with sharks.
-   Roman Riding, or riding simultaneously two horses by standing on their backs.
-   Trick riding in general.
-   In some towns and cities around the globe, some people (especially pre-teen boys) routinely used (or use) this kind of transport on tram buffers to avoid paying the fare. This is particularly common in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Africa, where the trains are the best way to get around both within cities and between them, but are often overcrowded.
-   Firefighters used to do this, but stopped because it was too dangerous. The Secret Service still does in an emergency. Note that those vehicles are probably designed to be ridden (especially old fire trucks).
-   The extremely dangerous activity called "Subway Surfing" (or a variation thereof), where a person rides on the roof of a subway car, high-speed train etc. "just for fun". In Germany alone, 40 teenagers have so far been killed while train surfing.
    -   If vertical people-movers qualify as "vehicles" for this trope's purpose, "elevator surfing" is a similar (and similarly-dangerous) activity.
-   Until the invention of air brakes in the 1860s (and as late as the 1920s), this was the job description of the "brake man" on trains, particularly on freight trains, having to hop from car to car to manually activate the hand brakes, between this and other safety measures that had yet to be invented, brakemen were essentially Red Shirts with a fatality rate between 1889-1891 of as high as 19.3 per thousand.
-   See the 'Making of' video of the example filed under Advertising.
-   A British Airways pilot was sucked out of his plane and pinned to the fuselage after one of the windshield panels popped out. Remarkably, he survived with only minor injuries and continued flying for eleven more years.
-   In 2012 a Romanian gang tried to rob a moving truck at night by tailgating behind it, climbing onto the roof of their car, and opening the truck's rear doors. Video can be seen here.
-   In 1895, a group of children were playing somewhere outside of Michigan City, Mississippi and had dashed across the tracks in front of an oncoming train some fifty-sixty yards down the railroad. All but one, a little girl who had suddenly froze up in fear of the train, made it across the tracks, but the little girl was very fortunate. An engine crewman by the name of John Luther "Casey" Jones was maintaining the engine aboard the train, and had spotted the girl. He risked serious injury, possibly even almost certain death, by shimmying out to the cowcatcher of the moving train to foist her up off of the rails to safety. The girl was shaken but unharmed, and the crewman, who was later promoted to engineer, would go on to lay down his own life around five years later by staying aboard to slow down his train to spare the passengers.
-   The practice of tank desant, the tactic of soldiers riding on the hull of a friendly tank so they can disembark and provide it infantry support when it meets the enemy. This was most commonly used by Russian forces in World War II, but is uncommon these days due to increases in tank speed and most modern forces that can afford tanks can afford separate transports for their infantry to let them keep up. Many tanks were even built with this in mind, and had telephones attached to the outside hull to allow the soldiers to communicate with the tank crew without having to shout over the engine or risk exposing the crew by opening a hatch.
    -   It is customary in modern era for the troopers to ride _atop_ on their personnel carriers instead of inside, especially at combat zone. The inside is reserved for the gear or carrying wounded troopers. The rationale is that if the personnel carrier is hit by an RPG, it becomes a death trap for everyone inside. It is also far easier to jump straight into combat off the top of the vehicle than from inside. Moreover, every man atop the vehicle is another pair of eyes for observation and another rifle for counterstrike. This practice became standard in The Vietnam War. Bulletproof vests and kevlar helmets have made this practice safer to the riders than what it used to be in WWII.
    -   Played straight in the Finnish Army when crossing water features on amphibious transports. The Russian-made BTR-60, an amphibious armoured personnel carrier, proved a sinking prone death trap in any winds more than a few knots. (It gained an ironical nickname _Sukellusvene_ ("Submarine") after a lake crossing accident which claimed the lives of seven conscripts). Since then, the soldiers _must_ ride on the top of the vehicles while crossing deep water.
-   Played straight by skydiving instructors. In AFF (Accelerated Free Fall) skydiving instruction, the student jumps together with two instructors. One of the instructors climbs outside the plane, grabs the student with one hand and the plane fuselage with other hand and rides there before they all jump together. (The other instructor jumps from inside the plane.)
    -   Likewise, in formation skydiving, usually two skydivers ride outside the plane before jumping off. Those who ride outside are called _floaters_ and those who jump from inside are called _jumpers_.
    -   In early World War II, Soviet paratroopers used to cling to the fuselage of an aircraft; when it was time to jump they'd slide down the wing and just fall off!
-   While at skydiving, played straight by jumping off a small plane, such as Cessna 172, where the jumper first climbs out the plane, grabs the wing strut and sets himself off on the slipstream, letting go. Such brief antics of skydivers exiting may not count, given that they're generally only there for a few seconds, it is possible to climb _on top_ of some jump planes and ride them (note that airspeed on jumprun is significantly reduced to allow people to climb out). This is considered to be ridiculously dangerous for everyone involved, given the highly increased chances of a tailstrike killing the jumper and taking down the entire plane.
    -   There is also this stunt, involving two gliders.
-   This is one of the typical jeepney rides in Philippines. Jeepney conductors pull this off to maximize the number of passengers. In some towns where the jeepney is not common, it is typical for the passengers to go for top load<small>◊</small>.
-   This trope was popularized in the San Francisco Bay Area under the name "ghost riding the whip", or simply "ghost riding". It happens when the driver exits his moving vehicle, climbs atop, and surfs. As you can imagine, ghostriding or car-surfing is incredibly dangerous and has led to deaths.
-   This happened to bombardier-navigator Lt. Keith Gallagher in an A-6 Intruder tanker in July 1991. The BN in question survived and went back to flight status shortly afterwards. The cause of the mishap was due to an improperly-armed ejection seat causing a partial ejection. The BN's parachute had wrapped itself around the tail of the aircraft, and the tension from his parachute risers kept him from getting impaled on the remnants of the canopy when the plane trapped.
-   On slower planes with low stall speeds, riding _on_ the plane is possible. "Wing walking" and was a popular stunt in early 20th century air shows, when the _top_ speed of most planes was usually around the mile-a-minute range.
-   Presumably, one _might_ be able to do this on a VTOL aircraft, provided that the pilot flew _very_ slowly and didn't make any sudden maneuvers, and that the "passenger" kept clear of those air intakes.
-   Dragging someone behind a car is a well-known form of lynching. One of the more infamous instances of this was the murder of James Byrd, Jr. in 1998.
-   There are various online videos where someone rides an escalator from the outside by grabbing the handrail and holding on, lifting them up to the next level. However, some people who attempted to do this ended up falling, resulting in serious injuries or even death.
-   A 19-year-old American tourist did this after he failed to reboard an Australian passenger train in time and it started to leave without him. The train sped along some 120 miles before somebody noticed him.
