An ability, item, or situation that affects items used by players. The Item Caddy often has this ability.

Examples include:

-   Gaining more resources on pickup
-   Items are more effective when used.
    -   Potions heal more than usual, often a skill The Medic has.
    -   Item effects last longer than usual.
    -   Items grant additional effects.
-   In cases of Breakable Weapons, items last longer when in use.
-   Additional actions can be performed when using an item.
-   Items affect more than one target when used.

Compare Amplifier Artifact, an item that boosts the user's already existing powers, Quad Damage, a power-up to a character's stats, and Money Multiplier, something that can increase the amount of items found.

    Action Adventure 

-   Some _Castlevania_ games, like _Harmony of Despair_ have an Ankh item that increase the effect of healing items when equipped.

    -   Leona gains 20% more ammo and grenades.

    Real Time Strategy 

-   _League of Legends_ has this in the form of the Rabadon's and Wooglet's Deathcaps. They're a bit of a mix between this and Amplifier Artifact though, since they improve the ability power gained from any source: Be they items or the character's innate ability power.

In the last case, you can even use it alongside other abilities that affect how frequent or how powerful critical hits will be.
-   _Divinity: Original Sin II_: Characters with the "Five-Star Diner" talent gain double the normal effect from consuming food and potions, such as ability score boosts, percent-based healing, and percent-based damage resistance.

-   A staple in the _Final Fantasy_ series:
    -   The Scholar job in _Final Fantasy III_ doubles the effectiveness of all items used including the magical attack items making them far more deadly then they initially appear.
    -   The Economical Ring in _Final Fantasy IV: The After Years_ doubles the effectiveness of healing items used and is typically given to Edward to supplement his Item Caddy abilities to supplant a role usually had by a White Mage.

    -   The Chemist job in _Final Fantasy V_ doubles the effect of HP and MP restoring items.
    -   The Alchemist dressphere of _Final Fantasy X-2_ can combine different items to create interesting effects that you wouldn't normally obtain.
    -   The Item Lore Augments in _Final Fantasy XII_ increase the effectiveness of items for each one purchased.

-   The _Wild ARMs_ series:
    -   There is a recurring Force ability called "Mystic" usable by one character per game (one _class_ in the Strategy RPG Spin-Off _Wild ARMs XF_) that allows them to use an item and have it affect the entire party.
    -   Some of the games have a skill that can be equipped to any character that causes healing berries to restore twice as much health.
    -   In _Wild ARMs 3_, the "Mystic" ability applies to attack items, and in that game enemies that are killed by elemental attacks drop an attack item of the element that killed them. So by using Mystic with Virginia, you can use attack items to create more attack items than you used and create your own infinite stock. Very helpful when exploiting weaknesses.

    Turn-Based Strategy

    Non-Video Game Examples 

Tabletop Games

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The 2nd Edition chronomancer spell Item Supercharger could increase the number of times a magic item could be used per day and the duration of the item's effect(s).
    -   In the Dragon magazine #56 article "Singing a New Tune", bards were given the class ability to increase the effects and duration of several magical musical instruments.
-   _Fabula Ultima_:
    -   The Tinkerer's Potion Rain and Secret Formula skills. The former allows their crafted single-target restorative potions to affect extra targets at the cost of halving the HP or MP restored. The latter permanently makes their potions, elemental shards, and magispheres restore more HP/MP or deal more damage.
    -   The Alchemusket is a rare gun which makes any potion crafted by its wielder more potent, making them deal extra damage or restore extra health.
    -   The Butler Uniform and Maid Uniform are a pair of rare armors which enhance the potions and magispheres crafted by the person wearing them. The former makes these items restore more HP, while the latter makes them restore more MP.
-   _Pathfinder_ has the Scroll Savant Wizard archetype, which makes the spells cast from normally-weak consumable scrolls as strong as if they were casting them personally, i.e., far stronger.
-   In the _Pokemon Trading Card Game_, Magnezone has the effect "Double Brain" that lets the player use 2 Supporter cards per turn instead of the usual 1.
-   The second World Book of Atlantis from _Rifts_ introduced the option of attaching an Eye of Eyelor to any weapon. This added to the damage, gave it unlimited payload, and allowed to teleport on the command on the wielder. It was however prohibitively expensive, much more so than other uses of Eyelor eyes like implanting them on living beings or siphoning their power using staffs.

Web Animation

-   Coco Adel from _RWBY_ has a Semblance she calls "Hype". It lets her use her aura to amplify the power and effects of Dust. Most commonly she uses this on standard Dust bullets to make them powerful explosive rounds, but she can also increase the power of elemental based Dust like Gravity or Ice.
