Agent Pink, the Mayincatec forerunner to Agent Orange.

_"Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!"_

Need to show how the Phlebotinum du Jour affects living things, but the character isn't evil enough to test it on an animal? Well, plants are fair game. Therefore, plants tend to get mistreated a lot in fiction.

Are you a scientist who wants to test your new mystery formula? Just take an eyedropper and drop a few drops in the soil of your philodendron. If it's a miracle cure, the plant will go from wilting to flourishing — and possibly to horribly mutated. If it's deadly poison, as it so often is, it will go from healthy and green to a sad pile of ashen leaves and shriveled vines. (Do note: for added drama, the plant will often wait to transform until you're sure that nothing is going to happen and leave the lab disappointed. _Then_ it will probably turn into a monster and start wreaking havoc.)

Do you suspect that your friend is infected with The Virus or some sort of radioactivity? Do you want to make sure it's still safe to go near him? Have him go near a potted ficus. If your friend is dangerous, the tree will instantly shrivel and die, all its leaves falling off at once.

Is your friend a Lethal Chef, but you don't want to hurt their feelings? Do you just want to make sure their cooking is safe to eat? When they're not looking, dump the foul food or pour the dreadful drink into the dracaena's pot. The plant will probably curl its leaves and die at once from the toxic substance meant to be comestible. Good thing _you_ didn't consume it.

Incidentally, none of these tests would work so well in real life. If you're paying attention at all, you may have noticed that humans and plants are very different living things. They have different needs and different ways of meeting them, and a lot of things harmful to us are harmless to them (or vice versa). Anyway, houseplants are often the _most_ resistant to neglect, disease and dangerous substances. And we haven't even touched how long it could take for the substance in question to be absorbed into the soil, and then absorbed from the soil into the plant, and _then_ for the substance to actually start killing the plant. Like Hollywood Acid and Poison Is Corrosive, this trope provides a visible (if unrealistic) clue that a substance is dangerous.

Vegetation is also apparently an excellent barometer for magical evilness. Has your character gained incredible nature-based powers and is Friend to All Living Things? Flowers and plants will sprout around her Fertile Feet. Meanwhile, the Enemy to All Living Things is likely to be a Walking Wasteland surrounded by dead trees and withered grass.

Despite what the name implies, has nothing to do with either That Poor Cat or That Poor Car. Also please refrain from adding examples where plants are harmed by situations other than those described above.

A Sister Trope to Ill-Fated Flowerbed. Contrast Soulful Plant Story, where bad things happening to plants are taken very seriously, and Weeding Out Imperfections, where flowers and weeds are used as metaphors for "desirable" and "undesirable" people.

    Literature 

-   Aversion: In _The Belgariad_, Garion's recently-discovered cousin Adara asks for him to show his magic powers by making a bush bloom again. Garion refuses since it's winter and the bush would die. He then creates a new flower for her out of a twig and grass. The flower is decidedly lopsided, puny, and... well, it's lopsided, let's leave it at that. Give Garion a break; it's his first go at live transmutation. It's nicknamed Adara's Rose, because Garion really, really loves his beautiful Algarian cousin, (or so Ce'Nedra thinks), and it _does_ have a nice smell. And oh, did we mention it's a _sovereign specific_, cures any poisoning? Imagine wearing anti-poison as a perfume (Sadi wonders if it works as antivenin as well; we never do get to find out). One of the funnier scenes in the Malloreon plays out during this arc, especially when Belgarath tries to get the plant to grow.
-   Averted in _Busman's Honeymoon_.

-   In a single case, _Butler Parker_ suspected an opponent from giving him a drink laced with sleeping poison. He poured it onto a flower instead. Later in the scene, he noticed the flower having half-closed blossoms and drooping leaves and blossoms, as if it was very tired.
-   Inverted in _Dragon Bones_: One of the fields around castle Hurog is spoiled by salt, and almost nothing grows there. That was an accident, or possibly Gaia's Revenge. However, when they have to figure out what to do with the dragon bones, which they know are a magical artifact that would grant more power than would be healthy to a human sorcerer, if ingested, they grind them into powder and use that on the field. After that, the plants there grow very well.
-   Crowley and his plants in _Good Omens_. They're the healthiest houseplants in London, and the most terrified. He occasionally kills the one who looks weakest, to show the others what happens if they don't try hard enough.
-   In "Rappaccini's Daughter", the title character is so poisonous that ordinary plants wilt when she touches them.
-   In _Thief of Time_, one of the History Monks teaches novices to be wisely-cautious about the procrastinators by setting an apple on a table and accelerating time around it. Within seconds, it's rotted away and left behind a circle of frail, stunted tree seedlings that sprout from the resulting lump of mold.

-   The trope is invoked in an episode of _Drake & Josh_: At a gathering to carpool to Drake's concert, Josh hands out homemade lime drinks to the guests.

The plant dies dramatically and Klink believes Hogan's story.

This trope is also inverted when in S4 Ogron, the leader of the Wizards of the Black Circle steals the gift of life which could be used to bring a dead person back to life and uses it on a dead flower to prevent the Winx from using it to revive Nabu, who had just sacrificed himself to save the Earth fairies from the Dark Abyss that the Wizards of the Black Circle had created.

    Real Life

-   Ironically, some sensitive houseplants can actually be badly damaged by minerals such as chlorine and chloramine that are added to tap water to make it _safer_ for humans. (Such treatment is designed to eliminate disease-bearing bacteria from the water supply, that is, for human diseases such as cholera that likely wouldn't bother plants at all.) Houseplant enthusiasts generally recommend using distilled or filtered water on their plants for this reason.
