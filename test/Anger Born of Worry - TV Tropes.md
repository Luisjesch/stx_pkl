_"Being a parent is wanting to hug and strangle your kid at the same time."_

A lot of things make people angry. Minor insults. Their own reflection. Awful jobs. This trope is when a character is angry because some fool they love put themselves in danger.

It's the caring that really makes the trope. The most common variation is that they embrace the person they thought was in danger into their arms and tell them they're glad they're safe, followed by them saying something to the effect of "Don't you _ever_ do that to me again!". This is seen from any kind of loved one, from a Best Friend, especially sidekicks giving a What the Hell, Hero? speech, someone's One True Love terrified of a Heroic Sacrifice, or parents when their children return from whatever world-saving adventure they've been on.

Related to How Dare You Die on Me!, except it's milder, as in, "how dare you put yourself in so much danger." May also involve a Slap-Slap-Kiss or lead to Calling Out for Not Calling. Contrast Tearful Smile, which occurs when Alice is still distraught even when she's happy. Good odds for a Punchy Love\-type to be this if they are far enough on the "punchy" side. Compare I Have Just One Thing to Say and Arson Murder And Life Saving.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Ace of the Diamond_, Takashima-sensei finds out that Miyuki has been hiding a serious abdominal injury since the semifinals of the Fall Tournament, and _immediately_ gets _extremely_ mad at him for endangering himself and risking long-term damage. It's about the only time in the Anime that she audibly raises her voice.
-   In _Aruosumente_, Legna is known for getting angry whenever he catches His Majesty outside his duties, e.g. while trying out a new invention. However, that's because he's responsible for His Majesty's safety, and they're childhood friends besides.
-   In _Attack on Titan_, after Gabi risks her life in an unauthorized mission to infiltrate the island of Paradis, which nearly gets her killed on multiple occasions, she finally sees her commanding officer Commander Magath again after Marley invades Shiganshima. Magath expresses relief that she's alive, then yells at her for going off on her own.
-   _Berserk_: When Casca attempted suicide by jumping off a cliff, Guts rushes in to catch her just as she's falling and manages to drag her back up and throw her a good distance from the edge. Afterwards, he angrily yells at her to never do something so stupid like that again, especially after having sustained injury himself. Casca approaches Guts, tearfully yelling how foolish he was for saving her at the risk of his own safety. From this point, they both calm down and realize how much they don't want to lose the other, and they share their first kiss. The rest is history.
-   In _Black Lagoon_:
    -   At the end of the "Goat, Jihad and Rock and Roll" arc, Revy, having managed to rescue Rock from kidnappers with a mixture of her characteristic ultraviolence and uncharacteristic guile, rips strips off him for being dumb enough to be kidnapped: "This isn't some feel-good movie! The cost of this is coming out of _your_ paycheck! The next time this happens, the only help you'll get is from the Almighty!" And then they go off together.
    -   In the Japan arc, after Balalaika comes very close to killing Rock, forcing Revy into a face-off with Balalaika and Boris, Revy punches Rock a good one for being so foolhardy: "Over here, I'm your gun! I could keep you alive through Tarawa or the Alamo! But I can't protect someone who's that anxious to die! ...If you weren't you, I'd have shot you myself for being so stupid!"
-   In _Bleach_, Rukia's anger at Ichigo's attempts to save her from execution during the Soul Society arc have very strong undertones of this. She constantly yells at him to just leave her to die and that her punishment is deserved, but Ichigo is having none of it and refuses to listen to her complaints.
-   In _Ceres, Celestial Legend_, Aki yells at his twin sister for risking her life jumping off an overpass just to catch a woman's stolen purse.
-   In _Code Geass_, Shirley, who has a crush on Lelouch, gets frustrated over his delinquent tendencies, and worries that he doesn't apply himself.
-   Ian from _A Cruel God Reigns_ has several instances of this after bringing Jeremy back to England to help Jeremy get his life back together. They usually occur after Jeremy has done drugs or prostituted himself, although sometimes they are in reaction to Jeremy's flippant behavior toward both and his original problems.
    
    **Ian**: "You were beat until you passed out! Don't act as if it happened to someone else!"
    
-   In _Cyberpunk: Edgerunners_, Rebecca deeply cares about her crew and is just as ready to get angry as all hell when they are in danger. This reaches a point where she's _intensely_ vitriolic with David as his health massively declines due to his cybernetics, especially once he dons the Cyberskeleton, and is constantly mouthing off at him due to her frustration over him progressively killing himself. However, once it's clear that David has finally slipped off the deep end completely as they rush to Arasaka to bust out Lucy, she drops the attitude altogether and sadly accepts he's on his last legs and makes her goal to get him to the top of Arasaka to save Lucy by any means necessary.
-   _Daimos_: Even though she has no military experience, Erika tries to join the Baam army as a medi. Her military-trained brother Richter is furious and shrieks at her when she comes back, but he feared she wouldn't make it back alive, due to his ideals that it is better to die than surrender.
-   _Delicious in Dungeon_:
    -   Chilchuck gets pretty damn pissed off at Laios's insistence on continuing deeper into the dungeon, despite the party being very worn down in every possible sense after the fight with the Lunatic Magician. However, it's obvious Chilchuck is simply worried about losing his friends.
-   A little while after finally rescuing his sister Falin (she pulled a Heroic Sacrifice to save the rest of the party, and the whole point of going back into the dungeon was to save her before it killed her for real), normally blithe Laios shouts at her to never do anything so risky again, and then immediately hugs her afterwards.
-   In the final episode of the _D.N.Angel_ anime, Riku Harada abandons her family's vehicle during a citywide evacuation to go after Daisuke, who she'd seen riding his bike in the opposite direction, ignoring her twin sister Risa's protests. When Risa catches up to her later in the episode, she immediately slaps Riku before pulling her into a hug.
-   There's a manga chapter in _Doraemon_ where Nobita received this from his parents after coming home so late after playing outside. Unfortunately, Nobita being Nobita, it's too much for him and made him believe that his parents despise him. So he decided to leave his house. To make his actions much _less_ sympathetic, he also stole some of Doraemon's tools and gadgets (including Bamboocopter) because he believes they will help him survive while living far away from his family. Predictably, it becomes much worse when he lost his bamboocopter and this caused him being trapped in a stranded island for the next _ten years_ until Doraemon finds him, when Nobita already becomes a Manchild and has grown a Beard of Sorrow. From Bad to Worse, indeed.
-   Bulma from the _Dragon Ball_ franchise tends to express her fears and worries for the protagonists' safety with eruptive rage. Goku, Vegeta, and especially Yamcha were the most common targets. A good example can be seen here.
    
    -   And again, she displays this at the end of the Copy Vegeta arc:
    
    **Bulma:** You should know better Trunks! You can't just climb into someone's space truck! Do you have any idea how worried we been about you two?
    
-   Anemone from _Eureka Seven_, who has only just realized she is in love with Dominic when he leaves around the same time, goes to save him when she accidentally attacks him with her mech while he's falling from the sky, clinging to a ref board to try and save her. She admonishes him for doing something so reckless, even though they're _both_ in a freefall at this point. Now she's normally been pretty harsh on poor Dominic until now, but fortunately for him, she lets it slide. Cue The Big Damn Kiss.
-   Miaka goes through a mild version of this in _Fushigi Yuugi_ the first time Tamahome _really_ risks his life saving her. When the tables are turned and she ends up risking her own life for her Seishi, Tamahome gives a Meaningful Echo.
-   This is what happens at the end of _Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid_, although Tsundere Kaname Chidori was afraid not only for Sousuke (who disappeared without a word in the middle of the series) but also for herself (since villains are constantly after her, and Sousuke was supposed to protect her). The progression of fear to relief to anger causes her to deliver an _epic_ Get A Hold Of Yourself Man beatdown to Sousuke - himself in the throes of a massive Heroic BSoD - when they're finally reunited.
-   Happens in one episode of _G Gundam_ involving Rain and Domon.
-   _Hyakunichikan!!_: Shuuto _very_ lightly slaps Chiho when she runs off looking for Fukumen and gets lost in the neighborhood. He stands impassively as she cries, telling her how much he worries about her.
-   _Inuyasha_:
    -   Kagome breaks down into tears when she thinks Inuyasha's dead, calling him "Idiot!" When Inuyasha shows up alive and well, she yells at him, causing him to think that she's mad at him at first before she says that she's just so relieved that he's alive.
    -   In the anime, a similar scene has Kagome yelling some more at him because she's embarrassed at having broken down in tears.
        
        **Kagome**: I'm not crying because I'm sad! I'M CRYING BECAUSE I FEEL HUMILIATED!
        
    -   And another after the defeat of the Thunder Brothers. When Inuyasha sees Shippo and Kagome surrounded in foxfire, and thinks they're ghosts.
-   _Interviews with Monster Girls_: Takahashi ends up yelling at Machi when she almost drops her head out of carelessness and downplays the accident. He later apologizes for it.
-   In _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind_, Narancia's backstory involves Bruno saving him off the streets and paying for his hospital treatment while also saying he'd beat the boy senseless if he tried to join Passione instead of going back home and attending school. Having been neglected and betrayed by his father and friends, Narancia realizes no one ever scolded him out of concern before and is only further determined to work for Bruno.
-   In _Kamisama Kiss_ Tomoe has a Bodyguard Crush towards the heroine Nanami who she keeps pulling stunts that send his blood pressure skyrocketing and causing him to rip her a new one verbally. It doesn't help that Tomoe is a definite Jerk with a Heart of Gold.
-   _Kekkaishi_: After returning from the Kokoboro's dimension, Tokine slaps Yoshimori to the ground, gives him a What the Hell, Hero? lashing for recklessly following Kaguro to the Kokoboro’s base, and refuses to forgive him before being overcome with emotion over his actions. Yoshi admits how thoughtless his actions were, but in spite of that he had to avenge Gen or he'd never be able to forgive himself and move on. Tokine embraces him stating that there are others who'd feel the same way about him as he did for Gen if something were to happen to him.
-   _Kotaro Lives Alone_: After Kotaro has spent a good chunk of the day helping a friend of him "run away from home", he returns to his apartment to find that his neighbor, Karino, has been looking all over for him since he never arrived to the usual trip to the bathhouse they take and he's pretty steamed about it. Since this comes at the same time that Kotaro had been thinking about how he had nobody who would worry about him if he didn't return home, he actually feels thankful and delivers a genuine apology to Karino (Who is surprised at this rather out-of-character moment from him).
-   Sakura of _Laid-Back Camp_ whacks her younger sister Nadeshiko on the head and violently shoves her into the car over how upset she got after Nadeshiko left without her cell phone.
-   _Majestic Prince_: Episode 9. Asagi, specifically, is violently berated by his AHSMB's youngest mechanic, Anna, for being a "lame pilot". Her father tries to defend her protests by saying that she was actually worried about him.
-   _Mekakucity Actors_: Episode 10. After a very peaceful opening showing the scenery of Japan several centuries in the past, we cut straight to Azami - arms crossed and brow furrowed - yelling "He's **late**!" at her daughter Shion. After some reassurance from Shion, Azami admits that she is worried for Tsukihiko (her husband)'s safety since he left for the (extremely xenophobic) village over three days ago. As it turns out, she was right to worry; as she'd feared, the villagers _had_ captured Tsukihiko, tortured him for her whereabouts, and despite him not saying anything, found the trail he'd left himself to return home - and promptly come knocking to murder her and her daughter.
-   The reason Elma quarrels with Tohru for most of _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_ is that they were close friends before Tohru disappeared without even giving her a peep. Tohru used to disdain human contact and went through great lengths to convince Elma to distrust humans; Elma found it very hypocritical of her when she found out that Tohru was openly living with a human as if nothing had happened (after having supposedly been killed in a battle with the gods). As such, Elma is offended at the fact that Tohru practically abandoned her.
-   In _Muhyo and Roji_, during Nana's backstory, she took a photo of a bank robber being arrested, causing her father to crumple the photo, since he was upset over her putting herself in danger.
-   In the _My-HiME_ side novel _Natsuki no Prelude_, after Natsuki returns to school after her first battle with an Orphan, covered in wounds, Shizuru is quite shocked to see her hurt, and (not being a Hime at the time) tells her that if falling off her motorcycle caused it, she will keep her away from it even if she has to hit her. Natsuki insists that she's all right, but is touched that Shizuru cares about her.
-   _Naruto_ goes to town with this. With only a few exceptions, Sakura always worries about Naruto's safety in a combat situation. This persists despite him proving his skills over and over, and her insistence that she genuinely doesn't feel that way about him.
    -   Possibly the best example is from Chapter 450 when Naruto returns after defeating Pain, Sakura punches him for being so reckless, then embraces him, thanking him. He did not hug her back, which, in retrospect, foreshadowed what was to come nineteen chapters later...
    -   Rin also seems to have felt this for Obito, as he would always try to act tough and hide his wounds from her, which greatly annoyed her.
-   Chisame from _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ delivers one to Negi after he risks his life trying to study Evangeline's Black Magic. For all the chaos he has (unintentionally) brought upon her, she still cares about him more than she's willing to admit.
    -   Asuna does this to him quite often too.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ played with this one in the Leliel/Dirac sea episode. Asuka is clearly aiming for the trope, but she keeps having to take a number as first Misato and then Rei "butt in" after Shinji reappears. She's left at a low simmer, but Shinji sees her the second time and seems to understand. Notably this is the only time we ever see Shinji laugh.
-   In _Rebuild of Evangelion_ 3.0+1.0, Sakura Suzuhara slaps Shinji for going against her orders not to pilot any more Evas, then breaks down crying.
-   In _Ouran High School Host Club_, Tamaki calls Haruhi an idiot for trying to take on a group of bullies by herself and nearly getting killed in the process. The rest of the episode has Haruhi and Tamaki giving each other the silent treatment until they make up near the end.
    -   Also in _Ouran_, the Creepy Twins Hikaru and Kaoru pull this off in the vacation episode to score Moe points through twincest subtext. Whether it was intentional or not is up to debate. Though in general, Hikaru is much more prone to this trope compared to the more level-headed Kaoru whenever there's actual conflict regarding them.
-   In _Princess Tutu_, Fakir constantly treats Mytho harshly and orders him around. When Mytho begins to finally grow a backbone and stand up for himself, Fakir starts getting so distressed that his harsh demeanor escalates until he finally snaps and slaps Mytho. At first it's played to show him as a control freak, but it's soon revealed that he's really a Jerk with a Heart of Gold and he's _terrified_ of Mytho getting hurt because of past experiences. (He just has a very, very poor way of expressing himself when he's upset.)
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_: Downplayed example in Episode 3. When Mami and Madoka reach Sayaka and Kyubey, who had willingly let themselves be absorbed by a Witch's Barrier to prevent the Witch's escape, Mami berates Sayaka's rashness but concedes that she's just relieved that they're both alright.
-   _RahXephon_: In Episode 9, when Haruka finds Ayato after his being missing for several days, calling him a big dummy
-   _Ranma ½_:
    -   Akane is wracked with worry over Ranma going to fight their first bonafide _lethal_ opponent, who had locked him as a woman permanently. When he finally comes back, manhood restored (well, unlocked, anyway) he sneaks into the bathroom before greeting her. When she sees him, she's very obviously relieved to the point of tears, even as she's angry at him that he didn't go see her first.
    -   Shortly afterwards, Akane is the one who faces a legendary eight-headed dragon to repay a life debt, without asking for Ranma's help. After she's nearly killed, and Ranma rescues her, he berates her (albeit gently) for making him worry.
    -   After Shampoo and Akane have their first physical fight in the series, Ranma finds Akane unconscious on the grass. Thinking she might be dead, he urges her to wake up. When she does, he looks relieved, right before he promptly calls her an idiot and reprimands her for fighting Shampoo.
-   _Rebuild World_:
    -   The Friendly Shopkeeper Shizuka, as part of being Team Mom, shows this to Akira multiple times over his risk-taking, which she tones down after she notices that this makes Akira really nervous.
    -   After Erio overdoses on combat stimulants in combat training and falls into a coma for days, his girlfriend Alicia shows this for him.
-   In _Sailor Moon_, whenever Usagi places herself in danger, Rei can and will call her an idiot. But when it is all said and done, she will be the first one to give her friend a hug. Before calling Usagi an idiot again.
-   _7 Seeds_: This is basically _the_ meaning behind Semimaru's yelling. Since he made himself to be a tough guy, admitting that he was really worried in a heartfelt way would be too embarrassing, he opts to yell at people who made him worry. Particularly Arashi or towards Natsu.
-   Early on in _A Silent Voice_, Shoya is confronted by his mother over him intentions to kill himself, her voice full of fear that her son contemplated his life. To make sure he wouldn’t do it again, she threatened to burn the money he gave her to repay a debt put her in and made him swear not to try killing himself.
-   _Snow White with the Red Hair_: Zen is particularly prone to this as Shirayuki and Obi quickly learn and is especially annoyed when his friends try to hide or play down illnesses or injuries. Obi manages to earn this reaction out of Zen, Shirayuki, Mitsuhide, and Kiki when he leaves during the night with one of his former associates without telling anyone where he's actually going just leaving a note under Zen's pillow saying he'll be back by morning. He seems both cowed and relieved when they track him down before dawn has even fully broke and he grins in response to Shirayuki and Zen's anger at learning he was injured since he never before had anyone he trusted and cared for the way he does the two of them.
-   This is a possible explanation for Maka's reaction in the _Soul Eater_ manga when her partner, Soul, is possessed by the Black Blood and starts attacking her and their teammates. She was clearly worried about him, but when he snaps out of it her response is to hit him on the head and then start kicking him. When asked, she claims it's payback for pulling her pigtails.
-   In _StrikerS Sound Stage X_, Nove has this reaction when a severely wounded Subaru<small>◊</small> meets up with her after fighting her way out of some ruins.
-   In Episode 6 of _Suite Pretty Cure ♪_, Kanade, in the midst of scolding her brother Souta for staying out late with Hibiki, says he was gone so long she got worried.
-   In _Talentless Nana_, Michiru Inukai ends up almost dying of exhaustion and dehydration after overusing her Wound Licking "Talent" as it is Cast From Life Span. Her friend Nana goes to great lengths to take care of her, including breaking and entering into the cafeteria to get ingredients for soup. She cuts her finger in the process and when Michiru tries to habitually lick it better, Nana yells at her for wasting any more of her lifespan on such a minor injury.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: Kamina and Yoko had a moment like this in episode seven, after facing particularly overwhelming odds in a fight and almost being killed in the process. A sad/bittersweet scene in hindsight as Yoko's worst fears come true one episode later when Kamina dies in battle, mere hours after they had kissed for the first time and revealed their feelings for each other.
    
    **Yoko:** There's always been a method to your madness. I could always just tell myself, "if anybody can pull something off, Kamina can." But this afternoon was different. That wasn't reckless or even crazy; that was plain stupid! You rushed in there without thinking it through, and if Simon hadn't been there, you might very well have been killed!... I guess... that frightened me...
    
-   _Waratte! Sotomura-san_: Haruno reacts like this when Sotomura shows up at school in spite of having a fever.
-   _Yotsuba To_: It's never specifically said, but this was no doubt the reaction of Mr. Koiwai after finding out Yotsuba had gone to Fuuka's school, by herself, without telling him where she was going. Absolutely justified, since there were at least two points on her adventure where she was _very_ lucky she wasn't seriously hurt.

    Comic Books 

-   _Death & the Family_: Supergirl gets angry when she finds out her surrogate aunt Lana Lang has been hiding her sickness from her for one year.
    
    **Supergirl:** _(thinking) Thara— Flamebird— revealed to me that something was wrong with Lana. Lana was sick. And she had been keeping it from me._  
    **Lana Lang:** Honey, I understand you're angry—  
    **Supergirl:** You're damn right I'm angry, Lana! What were you thinking?!
    
-   _Invader Zim_: The comics have Gaz's tense relationship towards Dib become this as part of Adaptational Nice Guy; her regular anger and annoyance towards Dib is no longer from seemingly disliking her brother, but rather disappointment that he's wasting his life obsessing over Zim, who she thinks is an incompetent egomaniac doomed to Failure Is the Only Option and thus isn't worth dealing with.
-   _Runaways_: During _Secret Invasion (2008)_, the Runaways got stranded in New York City at the very moment that the Skrulls were gathering for their final push against Earth's superheroes, and Xavin, being an apostate, and thus a very high-value target for the fanatical Skrulls, tried to abandon the team, including their fiancee Karolina, in the hopes that the Skrulls would rather chase after an apostate than waste a bunch of Earthlings. After the team caught up to Xavin, Karolina gave them an earful.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_: This was Princess Sally's reason for dumping Sonic. He had just returned from a lengthy absence, during which he had been presumed dead, and yet he now continued risking his life at the drop of a hat. The fear of potentially having to mourn him a second time was more than she could stand.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Crabgrass_: when Miles and Kevin get lost in the woods and are finally found, Miles' mother goes back and forth between being so relieved that he isn't hurt, to being so angry with him, she yells at him to never do that again, and grounds him until further notice.

-   In _A Game Comes to Equestria_, Yugi blows his top at Pinkie during _Luna and the Little Game_, though the anger is more so out of concern for Luna's self-esteem.
-   In a Halloween chapter of _A Game of Cat and Cat_, Matilda tears into Eleonora for going to confront a ghost alone, but Eleonora gets her to admit that she's just worried. Neither of them know the real reason why: in their past lives as Mathias and Leon, Leon confronted that same ghost and died, leaving Mathias a devastated wreck.
-   When Roxas in _I'm Nobody_ returns after disappearing for a couple of days, the Normandy Crew make their displeasure at him unexpectedly leaving and worrying them known; namely Shepard bonking him on the head, Ashley giving him a noogie and promising him more, and Stitch jumping onto his face and squeezing it.
-   In _The Hater Good_ Glargg shouts at Chuck for getting lost on his delivery mission.
-   _Lucy's Secret_: When Luan discovers that Lucy is at the store instead of Haiku's place like she claimed she was going, she gets angry at her out of fear that something bad might have happened and they didn't know where to look.

-   _The Many Dates of Danny Fenton_: In _After Many Dates: Danny and Spectra_, Danny's parents were angry at him for staying in Gravity Falls for more days than intended and not calling them.
-   _Monsters Versus Aliens_: Even though Lilo's now eighteen and has Stitch to protect her (though living with a bunch of aliens has also made her capable of protecting herself), Nani is still a strict guardian who (when Lilo does something Nani believes to be dumb/risky) is prone to speaking in Angrish. Both Lilo and Stitch know, however, that her anger comes from a place of worry and love for her little sister.
-   _My Huntsman Academia_: Weiss has a tendency to tear into Izuku for his self-destructive heroic impulses and tendency to not place any value on his own well-being when others' lives are in danger. This gets to the point that she creates a "Prevent Izuku From Doing Something Stupid Kit" specifically to have all the tools she needs to chastise him (including Purely Aesthetic Glasses and a spray bottle) and threatens to hurt him if he even considers trying to take up a job in addition to the ridiculous amounts of training, studying, and meetings he's juggling because she knows it's unhealthy.
-   _New Stars_: When Dr. Finn sees Maxx with her kids shortly after a Krill attack on an outpost, she quickly goes on the defensive. Maxx immediately realizes that this trope is in play, as seeing a strange armored man so soon after an alien attack (one where she almost lost her children) would scare any parent.

Once they're in the car, though, she explains that he scared her when he ran off without telling her, as it's a rule in the Bat family to tell one of them before they go off to do hero work. She promises not to go off at him again if he, from then on, tells her or Batman before he goes off to fight villains. Peter agrees.
-   In _Thousand Shinji_, when Asuka nearly blows herself up to take down Sandalphon, Shinji got incredibly mad at her.
    
    **Shinji:** _(angrily)_ What the fuck were you thinking?  
    **Asuka:** _(dazedly)_ I... I did what I had to do, just like how you blew yourself up to take out Shamshel.  
    **Shinji:** It’s called the 'Shinji Suicide Special' for a reason.  
    **Asuka:** _(grinning)_ Well they can call it the 'Soryu Suicide Special' now.
    
-   In _White Devil of the Moon_, after Nanoha, who has recently been injured, collapses from using Divine Buster against Jadeite, Fate yells at her for using high-level magic despite her being warned about the strain on her Linker Core, before breaking down crying and telling her how worried she is about her.
-   The fanfic of _The Great Ace Attorney_, _The Great Ace Detective_, has best friend Kazuma beating up Ryunosuke in a rage because he almost got murdered thanks to not having any backup when he confronted the Big Bad with his crimes, nonetheless crying with relief that Ryunosuke's still alive as he does it.
-   In _Three Strikes_:
    -   Count gets a little miffed when Naomi continues to try to take Mimic Squadron on her own and refuses to leave her, which ends up helping her get a shot in on Scream.
    -   Ionela starts to get frustrated with her grandfather’s lack of concern for his health and his obsession with Three Strikes. Pointing out that either one can be the death of him.
-   In chapter 12 of _Hell is Other People_, we get this line, which essentially sums up the trope:
    
    _When Wolf arrived at the infirmary, he was worried, and consequently, he was angry._
    
-   In _Starship on a Grill_, the main heroine, looking for her lost son, follows her husband to a parallel world where the Hadean Era is in full swing. The latter is perfectly livid since he is able to survive in such conditions and she can only spend there a couple of hours in a special suit (theirs is an Interspecies Romance). When he sees she has followed him, he bursts into a long string of curses in a dozen languages she doesn't even try to understand.
-   _Medicated_: Hop Pop is furious when he learns that Anne disobeyed him and has been neglecting her potions because she wants to try out her human form. He later admits that he is mostly just scared of Anne turning into some savage beast and hurt someone in the family. He lost his daughter and her husband to wild animals, and he doesn't want to lose his grandkids. Especially not if one of those grandkids turns _into_ a wild animal.
-   _Spider-Ninja_: Master Splinter, as usual, is this trope. He loves his kids, but he's terrified for their safety. While he's a little more lenient here than he is in most of his depictions (allowing his kids to become vigilantes and forming a partnership with SHIELD), he's still very strict and (along with possessing a Death Glare worse than Nick Fury's) can/will give his kids ear-splitting lectures if they do something stupid.

A dead person is dead forever, so I am angry. I am angry and I am hurt that he could not wait for me to wake up, and I don't care if he succeeded now, because if tomorrow he does the same and he fails, then I'll be the one left to pick up the pieces of his scattered corpse to sew them back together, and then I'll have to present it to his family saying that he died bravely, but they would rather have their son back."

    "You were in danger," Lucina mumbled. "Couldn't let you get hurt." She added something else, but Severa couldn't make out the words.  
    "Tch! You're the last person who should be putting yourself on the line for others!"

The next day, he yells at Sirius when he shows any remorse for his recklessness, and then goes to Dumbledore to yell at the Headmaster for sending his son to such a dangerous mission.

When all four of them meet Tsunade at the hospital, Shikamaru finally allows Naruto to reveal himself, much to the shock of everyone else.

While crying, she tells him that she hates him for that before saying that she missed him so much.
-   In _Sugar Plums_, Ume gets this from most of her adopted siblings. This is partially because Ume isn't afraid of dying, but will arrange things so the rest of them are almost always away from the danger so she's the only one who's truly at risk. This tendency is not only lampshaded several times, one character spends an entire chapter ripping her a new one because of it.
-   _Shards To a Whole_ does this three times:
    -   Shortly after Tim McGee and Abby Scuito move in together and begin planning a life together, Tim, Gibbs, Tony, and Ziva nearly die of hypothermia after being locked in a walk-in freezer full of Sarin gas canisters by a group of terrorists. Once they are rescued, and after everyone has more or less makes a full recovery, Abby, after a few days of nursing Tim back to health, lays into him big-time, shouting, "You do not get to dangle this perfect fantasy life in front of me: married, house, kids, grow old together and then take it away by dying on me! You don't get to make me want that, need it, and then take it away!" Realizing how much his nearly dying upset Abby helps Tim decide to apply for the position of Head of Cybercrime, which he believed would be mostly a desk job.
    -   While trapped in the basement of CGIS headquarters, which is being stormed by the FBI, Gibbs takes a bullet for Abigail "Abbi" Borin, his Love Interest. She is none too happy about this and pretty much flays him open for it — particularly given that she is still a serving federal agent and he most decidedly _isn't_ (having retired several chapters earlier) — but he can't wipe the goofy smile off his face, because if she's yelling at him, it means she's _alive_.
    -   Breena lays into Tim in a later chapter <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  after Tim had Abby, Jimmy and Breena take the kids and evacuate to Montreal while he remained in DC where he, Vance and others publically revealed a decades-long conspiracy between both the RNC and the DNC to control and manipulate Presidential and Congressional elections. This led to massive riots and looting, along with the wholesale resignation of the President and most of Congress. Tim, Gibbs, Vance, and many others wound up trapped in a Naval base with dwindling food and potable water supplies, dealing with looters and rioters while the Coast Guard attempted to keep the peace. Finally Gibbs managed to get Tim out of DC to a safe haven in Virginia, from where he was able to drive up to Montreal to meet with his family. When he arrived he was emaciated and in the midst of a massive Heroic BSoD, but that didn't stop Breena from laying into him once he had some food in him.

        _Asuka’s grip on his left hand tightened and she growled, “You leave me hanging like that again, Ikari, and I get to rip your head and arms off.” Her grip relaxed again. “And don’t you dare ever vanish for a month like what happened after that, either. You made me worry, Third. And you’re sworn to watch my back from now on, until I let you go, got it?”_
        
    -   In chapter 28:
        
        **Shinji**: _"And as for time apart... yeah, after the last three and a half years... I'm sorry I disappeared that month. I'd have come back sooner if I'd been able to. I didn't know I made you worry so much."_  
        **Asuka**: _"You start in on that philosophy crap and I'll make you disappear again. Yes, you worried me! \[...\] Don't you get killed on me, Third."_
        
-   _The Child of Love_: In chapter 7 Shinji gets struck during a battle and knocked out. In reaction Asuka completely loses her temper.

    _Asuka was obviously upset but was trying admirably to keep her turbulent emotions under control. Her first impulse was to run off and thrash wildly in an effort to find her husband.

    Slowly, Keiko's breath returned, her chest stopped heaving and resumed a more normal pace. When she opened her eyes, she saw Asuka leaning over her in concern, her face so close she could have kissed her.  
    "God, don't scare me like that," the redhead hissed, raising her hand as if to slap her then thinking better about it.
    
-   In _Once More with Feeling_, Ritsuko notes that Misato is angry at her charges after the quad bike race because she was terrified of them getting hurt.
-   _Read The Fine Print_: Shinji runs off after Asuka defeats Shamshel, believing he is nothing but an unneeded nuisance. When Asuka catches up with him, Shinji is surprised because she berates him for making her worry.
    
    **Asuka:** _"What the fuck is wrong with you, Ikari?! \[...\] Do you know how inconsiderate you are, making me worry like this?"_  
    **Shinji:** _"Worried? About me?"_  
    **Asuka:** _"Well I wasn't losing any sleep over the performance of the local sports team!"_
    
-   _Scar Tissue_: In chapter 8 Asuka gets angry with Shinji because he has reopened his wounds after yelling at their friends when they ganged up on her.
    
    _Terror, she was paralyzed in fear, her worn-out brain darkened in utter fear; fear of herself, of what she was capable of. In her state of restless hysteria, the abused subconscious of the redhead activated its most primitive defense mechanism. She attacked._  
    _"You Idiot!!"_  
    _Ritsuko seemed to shut up with that. As a matter of fact, the entire room had gone deadly quiet when exposed to her rage, even Shinji, who seemed to have been dying to seconds before, straightened up and gulped._  
    _"What the hell were you thinking, huh?! Do you realize how injured you are?!! And who told you I need to be protected? I could've handled those three asses myself!! Even if...! Even if it was... nice of... you..."_
    
-   _The Second Try_: Asuka to Shinji a good number of times:
    -   In the post-Impact chapters every time he was missing for hours (in episodes 4 and 6).
    -   In the post-time travel chapters, Shinji gets slapped by Asuka twice as he's waking up in the hospital for having her worried. The first time after the fight with the 12th, the second after his month-long stay in Unit-01. Each time is immediately followed by a kiss.
    -   Right before the JSSDF attack Shinji broke curfew to go back to their apartment, not telling Asuka was he was going to do or where he was going, and he left her worrying for hours. When he returned, he got a well-deserved slap.
-   In _Wake_, Asuka gets angry with Shinji when he insists on using a boat without warning her beforehand he cannot swim.
    
    "Humph. I'll let that one slide. By the way, you want to tell me why you're holding on so tight?"  
    "I... I can't swim," he said with a blush.  
    "WHAT? You let me drag you out here without... YOU IDIOT!" she screamed at him. "If you ever do anything that dangerous again I'm going to kick your ass to the damn moon! Do you hear me Ikari?"
    
-   _Ships Ahoy!_: Oprah lashes out at O'Donahue both for him not telling her about what Olga did to him, and when he gets into a van with a Drunk Driver and a group of other drunk people, and ends up getting into a nasty accident.

As a result, he swears off of drinking unicorn tears (considered alcoholic in this universe) for good.

-   In _Curses!_, Lili finds Raz in the treehouse and slaps him across the face as soon as he comes out of Fannie's mind. When she heard the wolves, she tried to call him, and he never answered.

    **Lili:** Well _how the heck was I supposed to know that you weren't dead?!_
    
-   _Love Covers All Sins_, When Holmes reveals to Culverton Smith that he _didn't_ actually touch the poisoned spring, Watson originally feels utter relief that he won't have to watch his best friend die.

-   _Missing_: Watson tries to downplay the severity of his condition after being found and ends up suffering a very dangerous fever.

    "It's just... I had a dream Leviathan attacked here and you died."  
    "I'm here," he said.  
    I ignored him. "Because of course you went charging into a fight against an Endbringer. Of course you couldn't help yourself, or have the common sense to stick to the sidelines. Of course you had to go and—and get yourself crushed. You dumbass."  
    It wasn't fair of me to blame him for his own death. Leviathan moved so fast there weren't sidelines to stick to. Still, I'd often thought of the ways things could have gone differently; he could have sought shelter with his family, or stayed paired with someone who could move him from danger, or done anything but try to face off against Leviathan.  
    But he wouldn't have had it any other way, and I wouldn't have had him any other way.  
    Didn't mean he wasn't a dumbass.

-   _Time to Disinfect_: Sunny spends most of chapters 10 & 11 acting short-tempered and quick to snap at Mari. It takes her awhile to realize that he's actually terrified for her wellbeing, because he walked in on her Self Harming.
-   In ‘’Torque (Jak and Daxter)’’, Torn is furious that Keira and Daxter nearly got themselves killed when they went outside the city to fix the pump without a proper weapon. He nearly kicks them out of the Underground if Keira hadn’t stood her ground and pointed out that she got the job down.

        **Mufasa:** I'm only brave when I have to be! Simba, being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
        
    -   Simba continues the trend in _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_ after Kiara pulls a similar stunt and goes into the outlands.
        
        **Simba**: Kiara, what were you thinking? You could have been killed today  
        **Kiara**: But daddy, I didn’t mean to disobey-  
        **Simba**: I'm telling you this because I love you. I don't wanna lose you.  
        **Kiara**: I know.  
        **Simba**: If something happened to you, I don't know what I'd do.
        
-   _The Little Mermaid (1989)_:
    -   King Triton's arguments with Ariel over her interest in humans are based in fear for her safety, because he sees humans as fish-eating barbarians (and in the prequel, we learn that humans killed Ariel's mother).

She scolds him with "You could have killed yourself!" but the conversation quickly turns to her assuring him that he has no need to be jealous. She even points out that she missed what he intended as the Grand Finale of his work, but no worries, he videotaped it for her.

    -   _Thor: The Dark World_: Thor calls Loki a fool for not following along their plan after he gets seemingly fatally stabbed by Kurse.
    -   In _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ (and in general), Tony Stark verbally chastises Peter Parker and even confiscates his Iron Spider suit for recklessly putting himself and others in harm's way.

Please leave a message after the beep!_" before coming completely unglued in relief.
-   _Now and Then_: Chrissy when Roberta had thought it would be a good prank to pretend she'd been killed jumping into a river. Touching as Chrissy only gets the punch in because she's bending over Roberta as the only one of the three girls who was prepared to give rescue breaths.

    Literature 

-   _The Belgariad_: Polgara and Durnik, repeatedly.
    
    **Polgara:** You great, clumsy, dear fool. Never do that again — never! You almost made my heart stop.
    
-   In Patricia A. McKillip's _The Book of Atrix Wolfe_, when Tanis was unhorsed and injured, and then had to kill a boar, his brother descended on him, dragging him away, and pounded him — only when Tanis recovered from his shock did he realize he was saying that he thought Tanis had been killed.
-   In the _Charlie Parker Series_, side characters Angel and Louis are lovers, gay, comic relief, snarky, kind of sort of insane, and just happen to be _incredibly_ badass. Near the end of their own book where they act as main characters rather than supporting cast, there is a moment where Louis pretends to be dead to fake out the antagonist. Angel, wounded, weaponless, is pretty convinced Louis is dead, too, and has to fight to put aside emotion and focus. When it's revealed, then, that Louis was a big fat lying liar who was barely wounded, rather than being pleased, Angel _kicks him_, repeatedly, and without being gentle about it. It's made rather obvious this reaction is born of fear and adrenaline, and Louis takes it all in semi-amused stride.
    
    **Louis:** I got _shot_!  
    **Angel:** Not shot enough!
    
-   In _Cold Days_, Harry commits suicide-by-proxy and, much to his surprise, is resurrected several months later. His brother Thomas, who knew nothing about this except that Harry had been assassinated practically _tears_ into him when Harry has finally gotten around to telling him the truth.

-   Discussed in Nat Hentoff's young adult novel _Does This School Have Capital Punishment?_. When Sam, the main character, is nearly expelled from school for possession of marijuana, and he tells his parents it wasn't his, they don't get angry at him because they know he's telling the truth. When he wonders why they get angry at him at other times (such as when he wandered out in the middle of the road), his mother explains that it's protective anger, and they get angry at him because they get worried, but if they didn't trust him, that would be worse.
-   In _The Goblin Emperor_, the one time Csevet yells at Edrehasivar VII (alias Maia, the protagonist and eponymous emperor) is after Maia did something very reckless that he did not consider dangerous, but which landed him in a position wherein he could easily have been assassinated. Since yelling at the emperor is just not done, Csevet prostrates himself on the garden path immediately after this outburst. Maia generously forgives him.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   In _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_, Mrs. Weasley's reaction to her children and Harry arriving at the Burrow is "Beds empty! No note! Car gone—could have crashed—out of my mind with worry—did you care?" (She then makes a point of telling Harry that it's not _his_ fault.)
    -   _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_: When Harry, Hermione and Ron go off looking for horcruxes, Ron gets discouraged about how tough the search is, so he runs off. Hermione is worried sick, and while Harry forgives Ron after his Big Damn Heroes moment, Hermione isn't so forgiving (at first); Harry has to cast a spell to keep them apart:
-   In Tamora Pierce's _The Immortals_ series, Numair is prone to this trope with Daine, her safety being his Berserk Button in general. In the first book, _Wild Magic,_ he throws an epic fit after she accidentally stops her own heart with her powers and needs to be magically resuscitated, and has similar (though milder) reactions to her endangering herself throughout the series. Soon it becomes a running joke between them, with him threatening to do outlandishly horrible things to her if she doesn't come back safely from her missions. Eventually, in _The Realms of the Gods_, they have this exchange soon after their Relationship Upgrade:
    
    "Don't you ever—_ever_—frighten me that way again!" He shook her for punctuation, then wrapped his arms around her so tightly that she thought she might just pop. "_Ever_," he added, and kissed her thoroughly before releasing her.  
    "I don't know," she said impishly, smiling up at him. "I like this particular kind of tantrum."
    
-   In the _Judge Dee_ novel _Murder in Canton_ Tao Gan explodes in fury when he hears the blind girl he just met is missing, ranting to Chiao Tai about her naivete and how she belongs in jail where she'd be protected. Chiao Tai raises an eyebrow. He is experienced enough to know what this means.
-   In the third _Kate Daniels_ book by Ilona Andrews, we get this exchange.
    
    **Kate:** What the fuck is wrong with you? He was silver! I had it under control. What was going through your head? Here's a toxic silver golem; I think I'll jump on his back! That's a damn good idea!  
    **Curran:** Were you worried about me?  
    **Kate:** No, I'm ranting for fun, because I'm a disagreeable bitch!
    
-   In _Leia, Princess of Alderaan_, Leia's parents try to keep her out of their work in La Résistance, hoping that her youth and innocence will protect her if they're caught by The Empire. She's eager to help anyway and despite not explicitly going against them keeps ending up in dangerous situations. When she goes to the Naboo system she meets a Moff who served her biological mother and who sees the Strong Family Resemblance and means to tell the Emperor, but he's fortunately assassinated by Saw's faction _just_ as Leia's leaving his home. This double near miss has Bail furious, and he's even more terrified and angry when Breha later gives him the Anti-Smother Love Talk trying to convince him to allow their daughter to go on low-risk assignments. He manages to work through it on his own, fortunately. It's a Foregone Conclusion that Leia will be crucial to the Rebel Alliance and Bail will trust her place in it.
-   _The Last Dogs_: In _Dark Waters_, when Rocky the dachshund had been separated from his friends (Max the Labrador retriever and Gizmo the Yorkshire terrier), Rocky is later seen at the zoo, eating hot dogs with Barbs the hyena. Max's first thing to do at seeing this is snapping at Rocky for making them worry, even accusing him of abandoning his friends. But Gizmo tells Max that there's no need to yell at Rocky (whom she says is making the best of a bad situation), and Max sees how afraid Rocky was of him at the moment and apologizes, explaining that he was just worried for him. Rocky accepts the apology and apologizes too for making Max and Gizmo worried for him.
-   _McAuslan_: The reason Baronet MacKenzie is so dissatisfied with his son joining the "Regiment" rather than the Scots Guards. MacNeill originally assumes he is just angry with his son for going his own way rather than follow in the family tradition. Later, he realises that this trope is in effect; if his son had joined the Guards, the elder MacKenzie could have used his connections to keep tabs on his son and maybe pull a few strings if necessary. However, since he has no contacts inside "the Regiment", he can't do anything for his son except worry.
-   In Seanan McGuire's _October Daye_ novel _Rosemary and Rue_, Toby comments on how Luna is generally angry only when she's worried.
-   In _The Battle Of The Labyrinth_, the fourth book of _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_, Annabeth has this reaction when Percy returns from Calypso's island, having been thought dead after an explosion in Hephaestus's workshop.
    -   And again in _The Heroes of Olympus_ when Annabeth is reunited with Percy at Camp Jupiter.
-   Towards the end of the second _Shades of Magic_ book, Kell goes off on Lila for collapsing during a tournament battle after not heeding his warnings about over-using her powers. Kell's brother Rhy later tells Lila that Kell would only react that strongly towards people he loves.
-   _Sunshine_: Rae and her mother have some heated arguments after she escapes the vampires — or, as far as her mother knows, after Rae shows up bedraggled and traumatized after a three-day disappearance and refuses to talk about what happened. This is also when her mother starts giving her excessive quantities of Protective Charms.
-   Camille from _Super Powereds_ gets this way when Vince comes dangerously close to getting himself killed just to put in a good showing on a test. She even goes so far as to say that if he gets that badly injured again, she won't rescue him, just stabilize his wounds and leave him to suffer.
-   _Tempest (2011)_: In _Tempest Unleashed_, the half-mermaid Tempest swims from Coral Straits to La Jolla to check on the people from her old life. On the way back, she's attacked by five of Tiamat's goons, one of whom stabs her in the tail and almost cuts off one of her fins before she can fight them off. She loses a lot of blood but manages to make it to friendly territory. Her boyfriend Kona meets her at the selkie clinic and yells at her for traveling alone when Tiamat is gunning for her, leading to the couple's first real fight.
-   At one point in _Uninvited_ by Sophie Jordan, Sean chews out Davy for going to his house to check on him despite how dangerous that was. She thinks he's just annoyed because he doesn't care about her when he's obviously scared and worried for her because he cares more than he's letting on.
-   In _The Valkyrie_, Mstivoy constantly hints to Zima her place is to Stay in the Kitchen and calls her stupid on a daily basis, and don't you even remind him she wants to fight in his army. It turns out he is deeply in love with her and doesn't want to lose her like he lost his first wife.
-   _Vorkosigan Saga_: In _Komarr_, when she and Miles are rescued by Captain Toumonen mother Ekaterin Vorsoisson instantly recognizes the Impsec man's furious 'Thank God you're safe/I'm going to strangle you with my bare hands' reaction as this trope.
-   C. S. Lewis's _Voyage of the Dawn Treader_: Reepicheep, herioc Talking Mouse Knight of Narnia, goes overboard, and Lord Drinian, the usually stoic and reserved captain of the eponymous ship, bursts into exclamations that Reepicheep's more trouble than the rest of the crew put together, and ought to be thrown into irons. The narrator lampshades this by pointing out that the captain is so angry because he likes Reepicheep very much — just like your mother will be much angrier with you for running into the street than a stranger would be.
-   In the _Warrior Cats_ novella _Spotfur's Rebellion_, Spotpaw is in trouble after sneaking up on and attacking Bumblestripe as a joke. Her parents explain to her that half the reason Bumblestripe is so furious is that he almost killed his Clanmate before he realized who she was.
-   In the fifth book of the _Wings of Fire_ series, Sunny returns to the rainforest after being missing for god-knows-how-long since getting kidnapped and escaping/being rescued a few times and has to deal with a _very_ angry/worried Tsunami when she sees her again.
    
    "Where have you BEEN? Do you know how WORRIED we've been? How could you DO that to us? I was so sure that the Night Wings did something to you that I nearly threw them all back to the volcano! We've had search parties out every day, but not ONE SIGN of you ANYWHERE! Not even Deathbringer, well, he said he smelled you over to the west, but who trusts him, NOT ME IS WHO. I haven't slept in days, Sunny! DAYS!"
    
-   Twisted inside-out and upside-down by Darken Rahl in _Wizard's First Rule_. While brainwashing a young child whom he intends to sacrifice, he asks about the boy's dog. The boy tells him that his dog once ran away, but was greeted lovingly when he was found. But one time the boy ran off without telling anyone and was punished with a belt when he returned. Darken Rahl asks him if his parents really love him, if they're willing to beat him and Pet the Dog for the same offense. While the boy's parents undoubtedly abided by this trope, Rahl managed to convince him that it was inverted just for him, causing the boy's love for them to be shaken.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._:
    -   In "FZZT", Simmons gets infected with a Chitauri virus that's already killed others, and all the anti-serums she and Fitz come up with have failed. Knowing she's putting the plane at risk if she stays, she jumps out without a parachute, right as Fitz discovers one of the anti-serums actually works. Fortunately, Ward is able to jump out of the plane, inject her and save her, but that doesn't make Coulson any less pissed when they return.
    -   In the 4th season episode "Boom", Simmons gets mad at Fitz for heroically helping to throw Shockley out of the plane, because he could have been blown up.
-   _Andor_: Maarva yells at her adopted son demanding to know who all he's told that he's actually from Kenari rather than Fest as his forged identification papers claim after a wanted message is put out, furiously asking who told "These Pre-Mor bastards about Kenari!", since she knows that them having this level of information on him could easily get him killed.
-   Brennan on _Bones_ punches Booth when it turns out he wasn't really dead. She claimed it was because he didn't tell her. According to him, he requested that she be told, but his superiors decided not to. The audience can probably figure out why.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: In "Passion", Buffy gets a moment of this after saving Giles when his Roaring Rampage of Revenge against Angelus goes wrong. She straight-up decks him in the face and chews him out for doing something so stupid... then collapses and hugs him in tears.
    
    **Giles**: Why did you come here?! This wasn't your fight!  
    \[_Buffy punches him in the face, knocking him down_\]  
    **Buffy**: Are you trying to get yourself killed?! \[_tears up, collapses, and hugs him_\] You can't leave me... I can't do this alone...
    
-   _The Cosby Show_: Possibly the greatest (or worst, depending on who you ask<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) example in fiction comes from the episode "Off To See The Wretched". To provide context, Vanessa and her friends went to Baltimore for a concert but didn't tell their parents. Clair learned that Vanessa's friend's apartment caught fire, so she spent a long time thinking Vanessa was dead. When Clair learned that Vanessa instead went to Baltimore, she was less than amused, and loudly berated her for lying and making her worry<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> :
    
    **Clair**: You bring yourself into this house right now! And, if you think that 30-minute ride home was something, believe me, honey, we've only just begun! Here we think you're lying in the floor of some burning building dying of asphyxia and you're down in Baltimore, having BIG FUN! Weren't you, Vanessa? Isn't that where you were? Didn't you go down there to Baltimore to have big fun, Vanessa? Tell me, didn't you go for big fun?  
    **Vanessa**: Mom...  
    **Clair**: SHUT UP! Don't you DARE open your mouth when I'm asking you a question!
    
-   _Daredevil (2015)_:
    -   Throughout the show, Matt shows himself to be very protective of Karen. On a few occasions where she goes off on her own and does something dangerous, Matt gets mad at her because he's scared that she could have gotten hurt.
        
        -   In "Stick", two of Wilson Fisk's men jump Karen after she visits Elena Cardenas. She is saved when Foggy shows up and takes them both down with his softball bat. At the beginning of the next episode "Shadows in the Glass," Matt lectures Karen on her recklessness.
        
        **Karen Page:** No, I-I trust Ben as much as I do you or Foggy, Matt. I know what I am doing. I am not some kid!  
        **Matt Murdock:** Then don't act like one! Both of you. I know you're just trying to do the right thing here, but we have to be smart about this.  
        **Foggy Nelson:** We?  
        **Matt Murdock:** First rule, no more skulking around, asking to get hurt. We do this, it's gonna be on our turf. The legal system.  
        **Karen Page:** You know, that's not nearly as heroic as you might think-  
        **Matt Murdock:** I don't want anyone to be a hero, Karen! I want you to be safe! And I want to protect this firm and everything we're trying to build here! We know the law. We'll use it to our advantage. Agreed?  
        **Foggy Nelson:** Do we have a choice?  
        **Matt Murdock:** Not so much.  
        **Karen Page:** Yeah, okay. So, what's the second rule?  
        **Matt Murdock:** ...I don't know, I'm making this up as I go along.
        
        -   In "Penny and Dime", Karen slips out of the office and secretly breaks into Frank Castle's house, taking with her a photograph of Frank and his family. The next morning, in "Kinbaku", when she tells the guys about her little investigation, they're both angry at her; Foggy because she committed illegal activity, while Matt because she could have been hurt. Once Foggy leaves the conversation, Karen apologizes to Matt for pushing too far, but Matt calmly says, "I don't think you're wrong about Castle. But, it’s really simple, Karen. I don’t want you to get hurt." This scene is an interesting parallel to the aforementioned scene from "Shadows in the Glass" because it’s the same configuration with the same characters and, once again, Karen is the bold one. The one difference is that even though Matt is upset, he more openly admits it’s because he’s afraid something bad could happen to Karen. He felt the same as in that previous moment, but it’s even stronger here because, after their kiss in the rain the night before, he now knows he has deep feelings for her.
    -   Foggy is pissed at Matt once he learns that Matt is the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, and his anger stems from different things. First is his obvious anger at the fact that Matt's kept a big secret hidden from him for the five years that they've been friends. Second is the fact that Matt is proving himself a great hypocrite, preaching about going after people through the legal system then beating the shit out of strangers. But third of all is the fact that Foggy is afraid that one day, Matt's going to get himself killed. For a good example of this, when Matt's recuperating on his couch from a concussion after Frank Castle shoots him in the head (the bullet is stopped by Matt's helmet), Foggy isn't lecturing him about his activities but about the fact that Matt came that close to dying. Given Matt seemingly is killed in Midland Circle during _The Defenders (2017)_, Foggy's fears are not unfounded.
-   _The Defenders (2017)_: Karen is annoyed at Matt for dropping the bombshell that he's starting up Daredevil again to take down the Hand, just days after she had been led to think he'd left that behind, but is understanding when Matt says he has to do this. She takes a harsher tone, though, when Matt tells her that the Hand may know that he is Daredevil, because this is incredibly reckless of Matt to do and Karen doesn't want him to get hurt or all the work they did to put away Wilson Fisk get undone.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Sarah Jane Smith had a lot of this when she travelled with the Fourth Doctor. A classic example is "Pyramids of Mars" — she thinks he's dead and starts weeping over him, only to be flustered when he says, "You're soaking my shirt." When she meets up with the Doctor in the New Series, after her initial joy her reaction is: "I thought you died! I waited for you and you didn't come back and I thought you must have died!"
    -   "The Poison Sky": After the Doctor almost commits a Heroic Sacrifice only for another character to take his place, Martha immediately hugs him. Donna whacks him on the arm before she does the same.
    -   The Eleventh Doctor is rather prone to this — he can be quite harsh with Amy and Rory when he's exceptionally frightened for their safety.
    -   "The Impossible Astronaut": River Song greets the Doctor with a slap as she's just seen his future self die.
    -   In "Revolution of the Daleks", the Doctor reappears ten months after departing on a Suicide Mission in the previous episode. Yasmin Khan responds by shoving her angrily, which Jack Harkness calls Yaz out on later, as he shares much the same unrequited feelings for the Doctor.
-   Inara does this to Mal in _Firefly_. She even gave his unconscious-but-alive body a kiss; however, it was also played with when her relief turns to anger when she realizes that the knockout agent Saffron used was on his lips, and she passes out moments later while halfway through insulting Mal's parentage.
    -   At the end of the episode, just as she is about to admit that she kissed him, Mal assumes she instead kissed Saffron. Inara doesn't deny this, because she would rather not face the consequences of kissing Mal.
-   _The Flash (2014)_
    -   When Barry Allen angrily confronts his childhood-bully-turned-metahuman before the team has worked out how to beat him and gets badly injured as a result, Dr Wells yells at him for it. When Barry tries to justify his recklessness with his Healing Factor, Wells angrily tells him that he can't heal when he's dead. With the reveal of Wells' true reasons for training the Flash, scenes like this have the added dimension of him needing Barry alive for his own purposes, rather than being purely concerned for his safety.
    -   Played for laughs in "Legends of Today", when Barry, Cisco and Kendra visit Ollie and Felicity:
        
        **Felicity**: Barry, it's good to see you. _(hugs Barry)_  
        **Barry**: Felicity. Good to see you, Felicity.  
        **Felicity** _(swats Barry on the chest)_: How come you didn't tell me Zoom broke your back? _(hugs Barry again)_ I'm so glad you're okay.  
        **Barry** _(to Ollie)_: So this is what it's like dating her?  
        **Ollie**: More bruises from her than from Deathstroke.
        
-   Jules in _Flashpoint_ gave Team Dad Parker a lecture after he had put himself in danger to protect a girl from one of his previous cases and almost died because of it. Half of the lecture was about Parker placing himself in that situation without calling for backup. The other half was causing the team to go frantic with worry.
    -   Spike gets one from Parker in "Shockwave".
    -   In "Lawmen", Greg and Ed are furious with their sons, Dean and Clark respectively, for disobeying their orders, leaving the police car and putting themselves in danger at the scene of a crime.
-   Practically Jo's default state around Henry in some episodes of _Forever (2014)_. Since she doesn't know he's immortal, she frequently chews him out for putting himself at risk.
    
    **Henry:** Investigating behind your back was a poor decision on my part. It could have endangered the case.  
    **Jo:** It's more than that, Henry, you could have been killed! If Mark Bentley had cornered you the way he did me, he could have seriously hurt you!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
-   In _Game of Thrones_, when his brother Jaime picks up a spear and attempts to charge down Dany and an actual _dragon_, all Tyrion Lannister can do is murmur, "Flee, you _fucking_ idiot," in equal parts frustration and horror. Played With with Bronn, who is _also_ livid with Jaime for the above stunt... because he almost saw his paycheck go up in smoke along with his employer.
    -   _House of the Dragon_: In Episode 6 of Season 1, Lyonel Strong loudly chews out his brother Harwin after his scuffle with Criston Cole. As he points out, it is only Viserys' willful denial of the blatantly obvious keeping his son, bastard grandchildren, and Rhaenyra from any punishment.
-   In _Gotham_, when Alfred finds out Bruce was burning himself intentionally to "test his own strength", his first reaction is to hit the boy and call him a "stupid boy" before immediately hugging him tightly and trying to reassure him.
-   _Helix_: Downplayed between CDC coworkers Alan and Julia. For the first two days of their mission at research base Arctic Biosystems, Alan needlessly bickers with ex-wife Julia while pulling rank as mission lead and dictating where Julia focuses her efforts at containing an outbreak of Synthetic Plague. He later apologizes and reveals that he's snappish because he feels he can't protect her from The Virus if he doesn't know her whereabouts. She chides him mildly, but it's made clear that, in their brief time together, he's reignited his old torch.
-   Nina gets like this a lot during _House of Anubis_ in season 2. She had a tendency to get mad at her friends for trying to help save her life, because it was putting themselves in danger, too.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   The events of _Kamen Rider Den-O_ 's first movie has three out of four of Ryotaro's partner Imagin disappear from the timeline. When they reappeared just fine later the fourth Imagin, Momotaros (a possible male Tsundere), shows up how much he missed them. It involves a lot of yelling.
    -   When Taiga finds out that Nico infected herself with the Game Disease later on in _Kamen Rider Ex-Aid_, his first reaction is to yell at her for being reckless. He is very good at hiding that he cares about her, but he does.
    -   _Kamen Rider Build_: How can you tell that Ryuga cares about Sento? He stomps in, slams the door behind himself, drops into his seat like a bomb, and starts a rant with _That Sento_. On the flip side, how can you tell that Sento cares about Ryuga? He stalks into the room, drops into his seat like a bomb, and starts a rant with _That Banjou_ or _That meathead_. Other times, he tears into Ryuga like a father would into his rebellious son and has actually called him his wayward lamb in the movie Heisei Generations Final. He tries not to feel anything, which usually comes to bite him and Ryuga just feels too much at once, so it naturally ends badly if they are truly mad at each other.
-   _Luke Cage (2016)_: After Luke tracks down Chico as a favor for Pop, and brings him back to the barbershop, Pop is furious with Chico...and hugs him a second later. He can't help but smile in relief as he chastises him.

-   _Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries_: In "Blood at the Wheel", Jack is uncharacteristically short-tempered, snaps at Phryne about her reckless driving, and avoids her whenever possible. When Phryne calls him out on this, he finally reveals the truth: he had thought _she_ was the car-crash victim at the top of the episode, and found the prospect of losing her "unbearable". This scares him so badly that it takes until the end of the subsequent episode for him and Phryne to regain their equilibrium with each other.
-   Ziva and Tony on _NCIS_ have a tendency to yell at each other and get really annoyed when they were worried about the other person. They'll both deny it's worry, though.
    -   Also Diane, the mutual ex-wife of Gibbs and Fornell. After her third (and current) husband is rescued, she goes off on him for being reckless. Knowing that this trope was in effect, he calms her down by telling her he's okay. She immediately breaks down and embraces him - much to the shock of Gibbs and Fornell, who have never seen that side of her.
-   In the first episode of season 3 of _Sherlock_, the titular character reveals himself to be alive after a 2-year absence. John proceeds to punch, strangle, and headbutt him after each attempt at an explanation. The creators of the show agreed that this is a far more natural reaction than that of Watson in the book (he faints).
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_: Kirk and Spock are all over this one. In the episode "The Apple", Spock takes a poisoned dart for Kirk. Upon Spock's waking up, Kirk berates him for putting himself in danger, then afterwards adds "but thanks." This would be a Crowning Moment Of Ho Yay for any other couple, but for Kirk and Spock, for whom the original Slash Fic was written, this sort of Ho Yay is just par for the course.
-   Dean Winchester of _Supernatural_ is the poster boy for this trope. His brother, his father figure, his best friend—if they put themselves in danger, they can expect to get snarled and yelled at.
-   _Uchuu Sentai Kyuranger_: Stinger/Sasori Orange shuns Kotaro/Koguma Sky Blue after he joins the team and generally acts meaner around him than usual. Kotaro is put off by this because the former's earlier actions made it look like he has a soft spot for Kotaro. Later events reveal that Stinger was worried about him because of his reckless behavior that reminded Stinger of his older brother, Scorpio, who got drunk on power and things just went downhill from there.

-   On _White Collar_, this is Peter's reaction every time Neal does something heedless... so it happens every episode.

-   In _Thunderbirds_, in the episode "Atlantic Inferno", Jeff Tracy is outraged when Scott orders International Rescue to deal with a fire jet on the ocean bed, since no lives were immediately in danger from this situation. He yells at his son that International Rescue is "not just a lot of machinery for putting out fires" and that they should not waste time dealing with "chances". When questioned by Lady Penelope, he confesses he isn't really angry with his son - he's just worried in case anything goes wrong for his organisation.

    Religion 

-   In the Gospel according to Luke, 12-year old Jesus gets lost when the family is returning from Passover in Jerusalem. Mary and Joseph are frantic (this is GOD'S SON they were supposed to keep an eye on!), and they return to Jerusalem to search for Him. When they find Jesus safe in the temple, Mary's worry (like any mother's) turns to anger: "Son, why have You treated us this way? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You."

-   In the first _Animal Crossing_ game, if you talk to a Snooty villager after being attacked by wasps, there's a chance she'll be concerned at first, then come to the conclusion that you probably shook down the tree with the hive looking for hidden money — which, to be fair, was the only reason to shake trees without fruit back then — before chastising you for putting greed over your own safety and then storming off furiously.
-   In _Baldur's Gate II_, one event that shows up if you try to romance Jaheira is for the party to be ambushed by bandits who take her hostage to rob you. If the protagonist tries to exchange himself with her as a hostage, you'll get arrowed for half your current hit points, Jaheira fights free, and this trope will get evoked once the bandits are dead.
-   In the True Ending for _BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger_, Noel Vermillion manages to save Ragna the Bloodedge from a long fall into the Cauldron and a horrible fate as the Black Beast. As soon as she manages to haul him out of the Cauldron, she begins screaming at Ragna about how scared she was that he was going to die, repeatedly calling him stupid and punching his chest. It actually manages to get through the stoic attitude he tries to wear fairly quickly.
    -   Noel does it again in the True Ending of _Continuum Shift_ after Ragna frees her from Terumi's brainwashing and loses his arm in the process.
-   In the backstory of _Bug Fables_, Vi wanted to escape the drudgery of working in the Bee Kingdom's honey factory by becoming an explorer, but her big sister Jaune mocked her ambitions. In the present, when Vi and Jaune are still too bitter with each other to be on speaking terms, Kabbu notes that explorers like them face many dangers on a regular basis and suggests that Jaune's mocking was an attempt to keep Vi from getting herself killed.
-   _Collar × Malice_:
    -   In Okazaki's route, Ichika becomes furious with him when she realizes how little Okazaki thinks of his life and how he wants to die protecting her without taking her feelings into consideration.
        -   Later in his route, it's switched around as Okazaki becomes quietly angry at Ichika when she protects him via Taking the Bullet and ends up in the hospital, though he calms down and asks her to not do something like that again.
    -   In Yanagi's route, Yanagi loses his composure and punches Okazaki after the latter nearly dies saving Yanagi and Ichika and was _delighted_ about almost dying. Yanagi tells Okazaki to never sacrifice themselves like that again or else Yanagi would kill him himself. Okazaki is stunned but promises to not do it again.
-   In the backstory of _Digital Devil Saga_, Dr. Heat O'Brien was always yelling and hitting things whenever he was around Sera, which is why she was scared of him and why his AI copy Heat is a Blood Knight.

-   Dorian, in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, will unleash this on an Inquisitor who has either romanced him or maxed out their friendship, after the latter returns from falling physically into the Fade.

-   In _Dynasty Warriors 5_, if you're fighting on the side of Wei and your character takes a beating, Cao Cao will berate you, all the while sounding concerned for your well being.
-   Saber from _Fate/stay night_ has this reaction whenever Shirou puts himself in danger. Makes a lot of sense, since she is essentially his bodyguard and he's less than cooperative with her efforts to protect him. Rin goes so far as to attack Shirou, out of anger that he could be so thoughtless about the dangers of the Grail War that his ability to survive it worries her, which feeds back into anger about her worry about him. Though many of her attacks are lethal, the one that gets him actually protects his life by removing his Servant and his memory about the War.
    
    **Cao Cao**: _Are you trying to kill yourself!? Fall back!_
    
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    
    -   _Final Fantasy IX_: Zidane has opted to stay behind and rescue his brother Kuja, and, after a year, was presumed dead. Cue this touching ending.
    -   At the end of the main story of _Final Fantasy XIV Endwalker_, the Warrior of Light sends the rest of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn away against their will to face the ultimate incarnation of despair alone. After the battle, when the Warrior is miraculously returned to the Scions's ship, grievously injured and on the brink of death, the Scions desperately try to heal them and beg the heavens for their survival. Once the Warrior has recovered enough to open their eyes and speak, the Scions take turns berating them for doing something so foolhardy and demanding to know how they think the Scions would feel if they hadn't come back. It's even worse if the nearly-dead Warrior has the audacity to ask their friends if _they_ are all right.

        -   The A-ranked support conversation between Midori and Kiragi has the latter retrieving a rare flower for the former (a possible call back to _Fire Emblem: Awakening_ which had Morgan do the same for Nah). The flower only grows over _dormant volcanoes_, which are nevertheless covered with poisonous gas. Naturally, Midori tears into Kiragi for risking his life for her.
        -   Midori ends up on the receiving end of this at the end of her Paralogue, when she ends up in a fight with a bandit named Candace and her lackeys over a rare herb Midori picked. Her father Kaze calls her out on risking her life for the herb, saying that she could have waited until it grew again next year. Midori counters that times passes much more quickly in the Deeprealm where she's staying, and thus a year for her father is much longer for her. Kaze apologizes for making Midori lonely and decides to take her with him.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_:
        -   The B-ranked support conversation between Annette and Mercedes has the former defending the latter after a rogue attempts to mug them. After fleeing, Mercedes tears into Annette for trying to take on the rogue while Annette explains that she thought Mercedes would be in danger, causing them to mostly stop speaking to each other for a while. Later in the A-ranked support, Mercedes apologizes to Annette and explains that she was scared that something bad would've happened to Annette that day because of her.
        -   Similarly, the A-ranked support between Ferdinand and Mercedes has the former go to Fhirdiad (which, depending on the route and when you do the event, is deep in enemy territory) to get financial records from Mercedes' adoptive father to prove how much of a scoundrel her father was. Mercedes is impressed for a moment, but calls him out on how reckless it was.
            
            **Mercedes**: That's amazing! I mean... amazingly irresponsible! I can't believe you put yourself at risk for my benefit. I really wish you wouldn't do such things!
            
        -   In Hanneman and Manuela's paralogue, Hanneman chides Manuela for running off to fight the Death Knight on her own after overhearing some rumors.

Manuela admits that she worries about Hanneman too despite how often she snipes at him.
-   One event in _Frostpunk_ has a child climbing the generator slip and fall a would-be lethal distance, were it not for the watchperson on patrol at the time. Said watchperson then gives said child an earful for his carelessness. The mother for her part is just grateful her child is safely home.

The right one will let him put an end to the deadly, acidic rain that's harming the locals, while the wrong one will kill him outright.

    -   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_:

        -   In a bonding event with Altina, she goes on a solo mission to Ymir without telling anyone else, having discovered that the IDF is planning to take the town hostage to lure Rean out.

        -   During the Ouroboros attack on the Pantagruel, Musse orders a suicide attack on the Glorious, which is averted when Olivert reveals himself to be alive and arrives in the Courageous II. After the attack is repelled, Rean reveals that he overheard her order and approaches her with an expression that is calm but a clear sign that she's in deep shit, telling her that he needs to talk with her about being willing to needlessly throw her life away like that.
        -   During his Bonding Event with Emma, Emma attempts a forbidden Spell to enter his subconscious in a vain attempt to relieve him of the Curse, leaving out how she's likely to end up an Empty Shell if it failed. Rean immediatey cuts off the spell and snaps at her for being so reckless.

-   _Mega Man_:
    -   In _Mega Man Zero 3_, Ciel pulls something similar. After Zero leaps onto a launching missile in an attempt to stop it from destroying innocent lives (he fails to stop the missile, though), she tells him to promise that he'll never do anything like that again. His response? "I'll think about it." Considering what happens to him in the _next_ game, he never learns. Also consider that, technically, Ciel is Zero's superior, and that _both_ times he's acted against her orders.
    -   _Mega Man Star Force_: Hope has moments of this when she doesn't understand that Geo's random disappearances are a result of him saving the day as Mega Man. Near the end of the game, she understands everything after Heartless visits and tells her the whole story.

        -   Later on in the game, after Naoto allows herself to be kidnapped in order to set a trap for the culprit, Kanji's the angriest with her, pointing out how reckless it was. The fact that he has an apparent crush on Naoto may influence this.
        -   In Kanji's third Social Link event, he invites the protagonist to his house, only to learn that his mother went to the hospital. Once the two of you get there, Kanji learns that his mother actually took a young boy who was injured, and is infuriated at the misunderstanding, but is embarrassed about how he overreacted once he calms down.
        -   In Naoto's eighth Social Link event, the two of you encounter a man with what looks like a knife, and you can choose whether to protect Naoto, flee together, or fight the man. Naoto knows that the "knife" isn't real, but says that if it was, you might have been in danger if you'd offered yourself as a shield.
        -   When Teddie returns to the group after a long absence shortly after the group discovers that Adachi is the killer, Rise pulls this off, hugging him and crying while chewing him out for disappearing:

Futaba starts crying again, and when Sojiro strolls through the front door as though nothing had happened, she chews him out, though not quite as harshly.
            
            **Futaba**: You're just the same as Ryuji!
            
        -   When Sojiro finds the calling card that had been given to Futaba by the Phantom Thieves in Futaba's room, he grills her and Joker about it to the point that Futaba starts crying from stress. Sojiro does calm down, but only after seeing how upset Futaba is and Joker sticking up for her.
-   In _Piofiore: Fated Memories_, in Dante's route, there are two times when Dante becomes very angry at Lili.

-   In _Resident Evil 2 (Remake)_, Marvin is far more harsh and stern with Leon in their final encounter, as Marvin knows he is badly wounded and will succumb to the zombie infection soon, despite Leon's attempts to bring him to a hospital. Marvin even pointed a gun at Leon to make him leave but it's clear that he did so as he was more concerned about Leon's safety.

-   In _Super Robot Wars: Original Generation_, Arado covered Seolla from fire and almost died for it. Seolla then angrily chews out Arado.

    -   Cue a slap and more chewing out from Seolla. But shortly after she expresses that she is thankful for the cover.
-   Tyrna spends a lot of _Sword Daughter_ in various forms of danger, and Gavin spends a lot of _his_ time yelling at her about it, contributing significantly to their general dynamic of Belligerent Sexual Tension.

-   _Warframe_: If the Grustrag Three show up in the middle of a mission, the Lotus will uncharacteristically freak out and order you to abort the mission and _get out of there_. If you succeed in fighting them off anyways, she'll somewhat reservedly praise your skill, and then tell you to follow orders next time.

    **Akane:** Being the sole survivor does _not_ make me happy!

-   In _Archipelago_ Paolin does care lots about Credenza. The symptoms of this, when they're reunited after Credenza running off on an adventure (and never even writing!) are yelling, Sand In My Eyes, refusal of a Cooldown Hug (denied) and
    
    **Paolin**: That's it! You're grounded! Everyone's grounded!

        **Gil:** You _**idot!**_ Are you trying to commit _**suicide?**_  
        **Tarvek:** You _know_ I wouldn't do that to her. \[...\]  
        **Gil:** _**All right I know!**_ Have you already forgotten how much trouble we went through to keep you _**alive?**_ How dare you risk yourself and _**her**_ by acting so _**stupid!**_
        
    -   Agatha is very loudly not pleased to find Tarvek fighting a hive monster on his own.
-   From _Homestuck_, Karkat Vantas' fussy anger and caustic snark is a near-perpetual state of being. This is partially due to his ego and anti-social attitude, but in the main because he's constantly worried that his friends (be they Alternian Troll or human) won't get out of Sburb alive, and fears that he's the reason for it. He's not entirely wrong, either.
-   _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_—This is how Princess Voluptua let slip to Hibachi that she has feelings for him.

-   In _Carmilla_, this is Danny's reaction to a lot of what Laura does, particularly when she learns Laura's untied Carmilla. This is also what leads to their unofficial breakup, since Laura doesn't want anyone worrying about her. It didn't help that the reaction was rather unfair to Laura, especially since she _didn't_ untie Carmilla. Carmilla's adoptive brother did, and Carmilla punched him out when he tried to kill Laura, proving that she's not quite as bad as everyone (Danny in particular) thinks.
-   In the first campaign of _Critical Role_, this is the usual reaction of the rest of the party to Vax running into dangerous situations alone (again), almost getting himself killed (again), and scaring the hell out of everybody (again). It never really takes.

    Western Animation 

-   _Bojack Horseman_: Three times, Diane has expressed this to Bojack.
    -   The first was after Sarah Lynn's funeral where the two told each other how much better than they made themselves out to be but Bojack went off-grid for nearly a year, not answering Diane's phonecalls, and didn't even tell her when he arrived back to LA, or explain what happened to him.
    -   In Season 5, Diane expresses this quite passive-aggressively when Bojack is unable to deal with his issues and "works out his own system" (read:gets addicted to opoids) and refuses to properly talk to Diane about them or acknowledge that he might need help, so she freezes him out.
    -   Finally at the series finale, because Diane missed several phone-calls that Bojack made during his Despair Event Horizon, he attempted suicide. A year later, she admits to Bojack that she was so afraid that he died that she felt incredibly guilty for not answering - but when he survived, she resented Bojack for turning to her again, and making her feel like it's her fault that for leaving Hollywood, when he promised her he was going to be okay. And it is for this reason that she decides that it's better off if they permanently part ways.
-   In the _Courage the Cowardly Dog_ episode "The Lady in the Puddle", after Courage saves Eustace from being seduced and eaten by the eponymous Lady, Muriel goes from distraught to relieved, then to clocking Eustace with the usual rolling pin and angrily asking "_Where_ have you been?!"
-   In (Nickelodeon's) _Doug_, episode "Doug Way out West", Doug is furiously berated by Patti for exaggerating about how well he could ride a horse.

    -   In that same episode, we have this exchange between Barda and Scott's assistant Oberon:
        
        **Barda**: Always were more trouble than you were worth, little man.

-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: In "Maud Pie", after Maud saves Pinkie from Pinkie's own obstacle course, she glares at Pinkie, who shrinks under the glare before Maud pulls her into a hug. It's a subtle moment, but one that speaks volumes given Maud's usual stoicness.

-   _The Spectacular Spider Man_: Peter has to sneak off to fight the Sinister Six as Spider-Man, and Gwen thinks he has been crushed by the giant tree in Times Square. When he shows himself again, complete with lame excuse, she throws her arms around him and exclaims "PETE!" _Then_ she starts with the "Where have you been, I thought you were dead!"
    -   Then there's Sally Avril, who, despite strongly disliking Peter, is genuinely horrified when she thinks he's been killed in the episode "Probable Cause". She does hug him when he reappears—then demands, "Wait! How come you're still alive?!", and then punches him, saying, "Do you know what you put me through?" Peter, taken aback, says that he didn't know she cared. Sally says that she doesn't, but she didn't want him blown to bits either—she's not a monster. Then she tells him that if he told _anyone_ that she'd hugged him, he'd wish that he'd died.
    -   In some of the earlier episodes of the first season, Aunt May comes off as slightly overbearing in her giving Peter a fairly strict curfew and grounding him when he breaks it. But it's made clear fairly quickly that this comes from a genuine worry for Peter; after losing her husband, Peter's the only family she has left. Not to mention the fact that she's stressed out with trying to pay the bills now that they don't have income from Ben's job. After the fourth episode, though, she visibly mellows out a bit and starts giving Peter more freedom.
