**YOU:** Am I having some kind of stomach seizure?  
**ENDURANCE:** Stomach truth. You're having a stomach \*truth\*.

This trope is for when parts of the body have "minds of their own" and will control or influence the brain of whomever they're attached to. Typically happens when said limbs aren't normally a part of the body, as happens to a Frankenstein's Monster or Shapeshifter Mashup. Quite a few times they can be considered part of the same _person_ who can just move them from a distance. Possible reasons include when the body is mechanical or undead or another supernatural explanation. Depending on what the body does it can become Personal Horror. A Super-Trope of Evil Hand.

Any time this trope is present, expect it to either be a case of Anthropomorphized Anatomy or Animate Body Parts, depending on how the body part is depicted.

When a physical part other than the brain (usually the heart or liver) is the source of a person's emotions, see Cardiovascular Love.

If this is taken to extremes, it can drift into Body Horror territory.
