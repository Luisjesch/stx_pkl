_"PMS isn't real, Needy, it was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem like we're crazy."_

Ah, periods. The monthly bane of a girl's existence, and a blunt reminder that Puberty is ongoing. They can add up to six years and nine months in a woman's lifetime. And they can be rather painful _before_ the uterine walls even start shedding.

If a fictional work decides to avert No Periods, Period, though, forget about the 25% who don't suffer any ill effects. The only effect of PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, will be irritability, and _every_ woman _will_ suffer from it. PMS and periods are near-universally conflated in fiction to the point of being considered synonyms. Another thing to note is that in real life, the symptoms of PMS typically occur about a week or so _before_ a woman begins her cycle (as the name suggests). When Aunt Flo finally comes, the symptoms of PMS typically start to fade. But in the land of fiction, PMS starts at the same time as the period itself — the two run concurrently.

Occasionally, stories will use a different effect of PMS. However, the only sign of these will be to _make_ the character irritable. Bloating might show up so the character can complain about her clothes not fitting. You may see food cravings, too, even though they're often associated with pregnancy — but the writers may be trying to throw a curveball, especially with chocolate. Also, watch out for Embarrassing Damp Sheets (and ruined, bloody clothes to be washed).

Could result in a sort of Sick Episode if particularly painful cramps take place. See First Period Panic for the very first time this happens to a clueless or unprepared girl. For the supernatural version, see Menstrual Menace and for an animal counterpart, see Mating Season Mayhem. See also Pregnancy Makes You Crazy, Bad Mood as an Excuse, and Hate Plague.

    Anime and Manga 

-   An episode of _Bubblegum Crisis: A.D. Police Files_ involves a stern, capable businesswoman who's insulted by her male peers for allegedly letting her menstrual cycle affect her judgment. She has herself cybernetically altered to get rid of her periods, but finds that Cybernetics Eat Your Soul.
-   Played to good effect in the _Gunslinger Girl_ anime when Triela suffers from her period. She has intense cramps and implied nausea, made worse by the fact that she is forbidden pain killers by the Agency because of her conditioning. The irritation arises naturally when her pain is compounded by the attitude of her handler and their target.
-   In _Inside Mari_, the protagonist suddenly gets crippling cramps and notices blood. The problem is the protagonist is a man in the body of a high school girl and he's never experienced this. It's traumatizing.
-   Played with in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_. Normal periods go without any mention, but Kaguya's period showing up outside of its regular cycle is listed in supplementary material as being one of the triggers for causing her (Ice) personality to manifest.
-   Ken Koyama's _Little Miss P_ stars an anthropomorphized menstrual cycle, in which each chapter is about her spending time with different women during her once-a-month visit, often as they experience some sort of personal crisis or emotional dilemma.
-   In Chapter 8 of _Minimum_, after Itou's friend Satou gets punched in the face by Haru for staring at her boobs, he (Satou) mutters if she's "on the period".
-   Referenced in _My Hero Academia_, Uraraka becomes really excited from the Sports Festival. Mineta is about to ask if it's PMS, but Asui slaps him with her tongue before he can get to M.
-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, Asuka is not amused by having periods, and adding to that the fact that Shinji has surpassed her, she's in an even worse mood than usual. Her period causes her discomfort, shame, anxiety, pain, and mood swings, with her lamenting in Episode 22 that she has to go through it because she's a girl, even though she doesn't intend to have children. Her written-out thoughts in the same episode during her Mind Rape show that "menarche" (a girl's very first menstrual cycle) is as much a source of anxiety for her as "sex".
-   _Puni Puni☆Poemi_: When one of the Aasu sisters hears an explosion in another part of the house, she assumes that her younger sister either is having her period or has missed her period. Her question gets immediately cut off.
-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_: Subverted. In Chapter 57, when Fuutarou demanded to know why Itsuki was missing from one of their study sessions, her sisters hinted that it was because of this trope. The implied explanation, however, completely flew over his head because the only girl he interacted with before the Nakanos was his 11-year-old sister. By the time Yotsuba got the nerve to spell it out for him, Nino cut in and told him the actual truth: Itsuki visits their mother's grave once a month on the 14th, the anniversary of her passing.
-   Averted in _Seitokai Yakuindomo_. Though the girls do complain about menstrual cramps, their personalities seem unaffected.
-   _Very_ subtly implied in _Toradora!_, but Ami gives us the right idea with this infamous quote of hers:
    
    **Ami:** _(to Midori)_ Whatever. Talking to you feels like having a period.
    
-   _Tsurezure Children_: Downplayed in the Luna, Luna. Kana flips her lid while on her period, not because of the period itself but because Chiaki suggests she goes back home since they can't have sex.
-   _Yona of the Dawn_: Yona is feeling a little under the weather and realizes she's menstruating. Princess Tao immediately recognizes that particular brand of distress and hustles Yona away from the crowds of men they live with so she can sleep it off. While it serves to characterize Tao as compassionate, sisterly, and observant and gives the two a chance to chat privately, it's never mentioned again.

    Comic Books 

-   In the _Sisterhood Of Steel_ graphic novel, _Boronwe: Daughter of Death,_ Boronwe's friend and roommate Dindra is bitching about her period while they're playing a board game. Boronwe sardonically asks why it is that Dindra seems to suffer the worst cramps whenever she's losing the game but is perfectly fine when she's winning.

    Fan Works 

-   In this _Attack on Titan_ fanfic, Mikasa, Historia, and Petra are the biggest victims of emotional instability.
-   The Massive Multiplayer Crossover Professional Wrestling fanfic "Character Championship Wrestling", Gwen Tennyson goes into a rage-filled PMS state whenever she is pissed off. Sometimes played for laughs, and sometimes comes with blood... lots of it...
-   In a _Discworld_ fic about the difference between Assassination and normal ordinary boring murder, licensed Assassin Miss Alice Band testily says that for a week in every month, a female Assassin is the deadliest thing on Disc as in that mood, she's capable of "inhuming" any number of men for fun rather than profit. Her post-menopausal colleague Joan Sanderson-Reeves, who has been there and done that, agrees but argues the inhumation fees are still jolly necessary, to buy expensive chocolate from Weinrich and Boettcher (the most expensive chocolatier in Ankh-Morpork).
-   In this _My Hero Academia_ fanfiction, while all the girls go through at least one very negative symptom during their periods, the moodiness part is played straight for Uraraka, Hagakure, and Yaoyorozu.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ Fan Fic "A Voice Among the Strangers", the main human character gets hit with this hard with her first period in Equestria. The fact that there is a language barrier between her and the ponies, and real horses don't bleed out the crotch when it happens (most likely twice per year) leads to some confusion. The fact that she was under emotional turmoil justifies it, as she mentions to herself that she hadn't had cramps this bad since she was a teenager, and she's _never_ been that emotional, period.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_: In chapter 10, Asuka has severe nausea from her period and spends several minutes throwing up. Turns out that her period is only partly responsible for her sickness, and that it has more to do with a case of being Allergic to Evil.
-   A story in this _The Owl House_ fanfic series has Amity undergo "Lunae Ortus", the Boiling Isles' version of PMS.
-   When Ruby comments on Blake's strange behavior in _RWBY: Scars_, Penny wonders if Blake's on her period.
-   Referenced in _Silent Wish_ when Trixie makes a sharp comment towards Tad and he replies with "Ouch, on your period, Trixie?".
-   In this _Steven Universe_ fanfiction where the Gems also get periods, Pearl outright says that near the Crystal Gems' time of the month, Garnet gets an even shorter fuse than normal, Amethyst eats everything in crazy combinations, and Pearl herself feels very vulnerable. Pearl also mentions that their Comfort Foods for their PMS are chocolate, strawberry ice cream, and pickles (for Amethyst).
-   This human AU of _Steven Universe_ has White Diamond, with a blanket, draped on her body, tearfully eating a big tub of ice cream while watching a romance movie. Played for Laughs when one of her daughters, Yellow, walks in on her.
    
    **Yellow:** _(panicked, to Blue)_ Don't go in there, I think Aunt Flo is in town.
    
-   Alluded to in this _SUGURI_ fanfic; it's mentioned that the Idol Singer Poppomikki Sunshine (actually Sham under a new identity) went on hiatus for a while due to fans shortening her name into the initials "PMS".
    
    **Hime:** Oh, my. Well, I do feel sorry for her, but... she did walk into it, didn't she?
    
-   In this _Encanto_ fanfic, Bruno's daughter Stefanie has her period, which makes her uncharacteristically grouchy, and at one point she engages in a Snark-to-Snark Combat with Bruno.
-   In the _Turning Red_ fic _The Panda Chronicles_, this is Zigzagged; Abby, and to a lesser extent, Mei, get irritable on their periods, but Miriam and Priya remain the same.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Incredibles 2_: When Violet throws a tantrum befitting for a teenage girl, Dash asks if she's "having adolescence".

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the movie _Brooklyn_, Eilis' boss bluntly asks her "Is it your time of the month?", having noticed how weepy she is. Eilis denies it, as her tears are due to homesickness.
-   In _Carnage_, Jodie Foster's character can be seen stashing a package of tampons out-of-sight when she's bringing a guest to her apartment's bathroom. Her emotional fragility during the events of the movie can be at least partially attributed to PMS.
-   _Gung Ho_: After Hunt gets fired, he and his understandably furious girlfriend talk on the way home. Cue throwaway gag:
    
    **Hunt:** Are you having your period?
    
    **Audrey:** STOP THE CAR!
    
-   _I'm Gonna Git You Sucka_. While working at the diner, Cheryl tells a fellow waitress that "It's my time" (of the month) and she has cramps. When Leonard tries to kidnap her, she asks him to leave her alone but he persists. She then turns into a character out of _The Exorcist_ (well, its Blaxploitation version _Abby_)— Blank White Eyes, giant Afro, growling voice.
    
    **Leonard**: You must got the Devil in you!  
    **Cheryl**: No! Cramps! _(Slams him up against a wall)_ I asked you nicely, now I'm going to rip your balls off!
    
-   Defied in _Jennifer's Body_, in which the titular character provides the page quote.
-   Used as a throwaway gag in _Mystery Men_. One of the candidates during the Terrible Interviewees Montage calls herself the "PMS Avenger" and warns the group that she can only work a few days out of the month.
-   _No Strings Attached (2011)_ had a scene showing all of the Natalie Portman character's roommates PMSing together, including the gay male roommate, who is having _sympathy PMS_. Wishing to nurture her in her pain, Ashton Kutcher's character shows up with cupcakes and a period playlist (yes, it's real).
-   In _10 Things I Hate About You_, Katerina's father calls her out on this, after she dents his car in a bout of anger: "My insurance policy does not cover PMS!"
-   Played straight and then subverted in _Black Widow (2021)_. During a helicopter ride, Alexei asks Yelena if she's on her period. She responds by explaining that she doesn't get periods because she was forced through a hysterectomy, and then goes into graphic detail about what that entails while Alexei is immensely uncomfortable, effectively flipping a sexist joke on its head.
-   _The Sex Trip_: After being yelled at by Jess, Eddie admits to Steve that he's suddenly getting overly emotional about everything, such as crying when he gets ketchup on his shirt. He later responds to Steve's admittance of having sex dreams about "Edna" by agreeing to have sex. Moments later, Eddie discovers that he's bleeding, explaining the past few scenes as PMS.

    Jokes 

-   A preacher was telling his congregation that anything they could think of, old or new, was discussed somewhere in the Bible. After the service, he was approached by a woman who said "Preacher, I don't believe the Bible mentions PMS." The preacher replied that he was sure it must be there somewhere and that he would look for it. The following week after the service, he showed the woman a passage which read, "...and Mary rode Joseph's ass all the way to Bethlehem."

    Literature 

-   Justified in _Blood of Elves_. The witchers' children's diet includes a cocktail of mushrooms and herbs that are meant to promote muscle growth and metabolic balance, but in Ciri they have the side effect of making her symptoms worse once she starts menstruating. The witchers had never tried to train a female witcher before and didn't realize it was a problem until Triss Merigold pointed it out.
-   _Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World_: Averted with Roxanne's period; the only crankiness she experiences is missing out on sex with Michio as a result, at her request, which is often Truth in Television.
-   _In Another World with My Smartphone_: Near the start of the journey, in Interlude I: "The Adventurers", the twins Elze and Linze both get their periods a day apart. They're not just irritable or moody as a result, they are _bedridden_ by the experience.
    
    _It must’ve been tough dealing with... girl problems like that. Even my **\[Recovery\]** spell had no effect. Probably because it wasn’t classified as an abnormal status condition, or so I figured. If anything, that kind of pain was proof that her body was functioning properly._
    
-   _Polgara the Sorceress_: What triggers the young Polgara's first use of sorcery? Being irritable because she's menstruating just then. (The rest of the series is solidly in No Periods, Period.)
-   A nice scene in the _Protector of the Small_ quartet averts this as Kel and her friend/maid discuss what happens during your period. While it does mention that some women do get overly angry, others might just get a little weepy or desire sweets. In the next book, a brief mention is made of Kel having her period and crying over a very bad day when she otherwise wouldn't.
-   _Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai_: When Saki tells Sakuta not to ever talk to Yuuma again, Sakuta asks the girl if she's on her period. Her response is to insult him and storm off.
-   _Reborn as a Space Mercenary: I Woke Up Piloting the Strongest Starship!_: At the start of volume 5, Mimi and Elma are both on their periods and feeling like crap. Hiro tells his two Bridge Bunnies to take the day off.
    
    _The two smiled. They were clearly not feeling their best. Not that they were sick; it was just a... feminine issue. Even on the pill, it doesn't stop the monthly beast from rearing its ugly head. I don't really have to spell it out for you, right?_
    
-   Averted in _The Red Tent_. Although the women all menstruate at more-or-less the same time (Jacob's wives start first, with servants starting a few days later) around the New Moon, and they are secluded (partly because of Jewish laws labeling menstruating women as "unclean", and partly so they can conduct certain religious rituals without any objections), they don't seem to experience adverse symptoms aside from perhaps a little tiredness. It's a restful time, and the women celebrate this chance of renewal with offerings to Inanna, socializing cakes (more like cookies or scones), and fine wine.
-   In the Swedish short story collection _Mamm- och Pappsagor_ ("Mom and Dad Stories") by Gunnel Linde, one story presents it in a comically exaggerated fashion by establishing that all mothers everywhere turn into angry firebreathing dragons once a month. For most of the story, the kids who are the main characters don't know what's causing this; they spend a lot of time discussing with kids from other families what they do when their mothers start breathing fire, and trying to find ways to stop the transformation. Finally, they talk to their father who basically says "don't worry, PMS is completely natural."

    Live-Action TV 

-   Referenced on _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, when Willow is consoling her boyfriend Oz, who we've just learned is a werewolf.
    
    For a few days a month, I'm not so fun to be around, either.
    
-   At least one episode of _My Wife and Kids_ centers around this, with Michael's wife and teenage daughter both having extreme PMS at the same time.
-   A sketch on _SCTV_ was about "PMS Awareness Week."
-   There have been multiple jokes in _The Big Bang Theory_ where Penny snaps at Sheldon and he comments that she must be on her period.
-   _Roseanne_ episode "PMS, I Love You". When Roseanne gets PMS she pretty much goes crazy, with wild mood swings. This causes terror in the members of her family. Oddly though, her issues with this time of the month are never brought up again after this episode.
    -   In the same episode, Roseanne's friend Crystal, who is most often the kindest, sweetest, most naive and most Woobie-ish of the cast (if a little neurotic,) mentioned how even she becomes a complete she-beast during her time of the month, saying once she went around and broke a streetlight for every man who did her wrong; Dan called it the "Great Blackout of '84."
    -   In an episode where Roseanne revealed she missed her period and is afraid she might be pregnant again, Jackie asked how she managed it when she's always so horribly mean and angry during her time of the month that everyone would've noticed. She gleefully reveals she _faked_ her PMS that month, and even tacked on an extra day for the hell of it.
-   Referenced in an episode of _Maude_ when she runs for State Senate. One of her staffers (who isn't a staffer for very long) says that women are unfit for public office because of their mood swings.
-   Sorta referenced in one episode of _Sliders_ where the land on an Earth (or at least a US) with a Matriarchal Society. One local guy they talk to says that a Patriarchal Society wouldn't work, in part because women only get mood swings once a month and men have them all the time.
-   In _Commander in Chief_, Geena Davis scornfully suggests that the reason men worry about a female president is: "once a month, will she or won't she push the button?"
-   Played for laughs on _Saturday Night Live_ in a fake commercial for a pill called "Annuale," which lets a woman have her period once a year, meaning she gets PMS to the nth degree (one attacks her co-workers with an ax, a second scarfs down an entire birthday cake at a children's party, a third kicks her husband in the crotch, punches him in the face, and runs screaming out the room, and a fourth French-kisses a dog). There's even a Side Effects Include... warning near the end that states that these once-a-year periods should be told to authorities in advance so officials can lock any woman who takes Annuale up like the Wolfman.
    -   SNL Korea also did their take on this idea (but calling the pill "Veranil Jung"), except one woman delivers a beatdown on her boyfriend in a restaurant, another rampages through a taekwondo training session, another one breaks into a car and takes it for a joyride, and they all finally converge upon a convenience store and raid it.
-   _Everybody Loves Raymond_ features Debra going near-psychotic when she's on her period, yelling and arguing at Ray for even less reason than normal. Ray eventually tapes her rants and plays them back to her as a form of revenge and proof that she's being unreasonable... at which point she goes full-on "weepy PMSing woman" and poor Ray's forced to backtrack. It was head writer Phil Rosenthal's apology/explanation to his wife.
-   "The Camping Trip" episode of _Married... with Children_ (originally titled "A Period Piece," but the censors objected, even though _Married With Children_ never showed episode titles onscreen) dealt with Marcy, Peg, and Kelly having their cycles sync up while in a cabin with Steven, Al, and Bud. Played for Laughs, and probably contributed to a funny line in _Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy_, as their periods attract all sorts of wildlife... including bears.
-   Inverted in an episode of _Taxi_; the cabbies at first assume that Simka's foul mood that she has once a month (called a "kremkapush" by Latka) is her ordinary period. In truth, she _does_ have PMS.
-   An episode of _30 Rock_ has Liz wondering why people think her show is demeaning to women. We then see a series of the show's sketches about illustrious women losing it because they are having their periods. Later exaggerated with Avery—she goes from understanding and sensible to wild the second her period started.
    
    "YOU STUPID DOUCHE!!!"
    
-   On an episode of _Modern Family_, all three of the Dunphy women get their periods at the same time, terrifying Phil. Luke, terrorized, yells that they're all "monsterating." They then turn their wrath on Phil for giving Luke that mindset.
-   In the sketch comedy show, _Touch Me, I'm Karen Taylor_, Karen invented the super-heroine Pre-Menstrual Girl, who is the alter ego of normally pleasant and cheerful office worker Penelope. When trouble arises her super-power kicks in: she alters her body-clock and transforms into Pre-Menstrual Girl, a superheroine who saves peoples' lives, either by winning the villain's heart with her neurotic sobbing or terrifying him into bludgeoned submission by screaming, being aggressive, and sniping.
-   In an episode of _The IT Crowd_, Jen has a "visit from Aunt Irma" that makes her so irritable that she screams with the Voice of the Legion. To make matters worse, Roy and Moss start having the same symptoms as though their cycles are synchronizing, even though they're men.
-   Invoked by Alison's husband Donnie on _Orphan Black_, when she's ... tied him up in a chair and is threatening to torture him to find out whether he's her monitor or not. While she may be justifiably angered by the suggestion, her reaction<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  does nothing to suggest he isn't right.
-   In one episode of _Charmed,_ the sisters all get PMS, which causes their powers to mess up. Also, because of a blue moon, they turn into werewolves or something.
-   Mocked on _The Nightly Show_ during a panel discussion about the idea that Hillary Clinton being post-menopausal would make her a better president than a younger woman. Staff writer Holly Walker says that not only is she on her period right now, so are plenty of women in the audience, and yet they are _not_ burning the studio down. Then she lampoons the stereotypical portrayal:
    
    "_RRRRRAAAAGH! Chocolate!_ Salted nuts!"
    
-   Scottish comedy duo Hale and Pace and their sketch "Reality Street". "It was brought to you today by the letters PMT!" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Mocked in the _Red Dwarf_ episode "Beyond a Joke": After Kryten (who, it should be said, is a robot who presents and identifies as male) steals a T-34 from a World War II simulator and uses it to blow up Mr. Bingley's gazebo when the rest of the crew have forgotten it was the day he joined the crew and won't eat the dinner he cooked, Dave's only comment is:
    
    **Dave:** I didn't know robots got PMS....
    
-   _Million Yen Women_: After Hitomi happens to overhear Shin and Midori discuss possibly having sex after Midori turns 18, she starts acting moody towards Shin. Since Shin doesn't quite realize Hitomi could be acting this way because she's interested in him, he concludes that she's on her period. He later gives Hitomi some pills intended for menstrual cramps, which doesn't amuse her at all.
-   Vaguely referenced on _Growing Pains_ when Maggie declares, "It's the second Saturday of the month. You know what that means!" Ben snarkily responds, "You're gonna be cranky?" (Though Maggie was referring to it being the day to do chores).
-   Downplayed in an episode of _Community_ where Abed turns out to have accidentally charted the cycles of his female friends. He started just noticing that there were certain days when their tolerance for his weirdness was especially low, and tried to keep track of those days to avoid annoying them. By the time he realized what he was tracking, knowing which days to tone it down and keep chocolate handy had proven too useful to stop.
-   _Sense8_: Thanks to their cluster link Lito Rodriguez starts feeling Sun Bak's period symptoms including cramps and mood swings. While driving home from work Lito, who still doesn't fully understand the cluster link yet, starts breaking down while on the phone to his boyfriend having convinced himself that it's cancer.
    
    **Lito:** Hernando, there's a crying Korean woman...  
    **Sun:** _(with tears streaming down her face)_ I'm not crying.  
    **Lito:** Okay. There's a Korean woman who's not crying in the same way that I'M NOT SCREAMING!
    
-   _Victorious_: It's implied that Jade makes videos of things she hates to get through "that time of the month".
-   _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit:_ In the episode "Intoxicated", the defense tries to use the killer being on PMS as a psych defense. The detectives and ADA are... less than convinced.
    
    **Stabler:** P.M.D.D.? PMS made her do it.
    
    **Benson:** You're not buying this.
    
    **Novak:** What, we can't control our emotions because we're pre-menstrual? Yeah, that's bull.
    
-   In _The People v. O. J. Simpson_, when Marcia Clark, the prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson case buys tampons, the cashier recognizes her from TV broadcasts and jokes: “Guess the defense is in for one hell of a week, huh?” Marcia isn't amused.
-   Discussed on _The Golden Girls_, when Blanche starts menopause gets them talking about their own experiences. Blanche and Rose apparently had no issues with it, while Dorothy had it so bad that she actually liked menopause.

    Web Original 

-   _Fem Fortress,_ a fan video of _Team Fortress 2_ that swaps out the male voices for female ones (but not the models, presumably because of the Rule of Funny). Everyone on the team goes on their period _at the same time_, and is unable to fight. Except the Pyro.
-   A fanmade list of commandments for _Warhammer 40,000_'s Space Marines commands them to stay well away from the Sisters of Battle when the Red Rage is upon them.

-   Discussed on _Not Always Working_, when a delivery driver comments to his trainee that they will need to be tactful with their next client; she's ordered tampons, tea, and chocolates. The trainee needs it spelled out for him that the customer is on her period and probably cranky, and then he's too disgusted to make the delivery.
    -   Meanwhile on _Not Always Learning_, an English-as-secondary-language teacher is informed of a student's absence by one of her less-fluent friends, who says the absentee had "woman month pain" that day.
-   In this _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ parody, Fiery Redhead Asuka yells "I'm permanently menstruating!"

    Western Animation 

-   As pointed out by CR, Katie Ka-Boom from _Animaniacs_ is a teenage girl whose violent and sudden outbursts are portrayed as her transforming into different monsters. The show never outright states that she's dealing with PMS, but the implications are there.
-   _Daria_: In "Arts 'n' Crass", after dumping the bowl of pasta on Jake's head, Helen returns to the kitchen and gives a half-assed apology by blaming her reaction to her PMS.
-   Referenced in the _Family Guy_ episode "Screwed the Pooch" when Brian is fighting for custody of his puppies after he had sex with Carter’s dog Seabreeze. Lois calls out Carter for being such a Jerkass, but Carter dismisses it as Lois being on her period.
-   The _Robot Chicken_ episode "Slaughterhouse on the Prairie" shows what happens when _She-Ra: Princess of Power_ has her period while the usual problems arise. _There are no survivors._ (Or almost none, anyhow.)
-   _6teen_: In "Enter the Dragon" (which was banned in the States, by the way), this is the driving trope of the girls' plot when their period cycles sync up.
    -   Jen gets cramps when she's on her period—and apparently, her cramps are so painful that she compares it to what she imagines being hit in the stomach with a bowling ball would feel like.
    -   Nikki and Caitlin basically swap personalities when they're on their periods, acting like exaggerated versions of each other —
        -   Nikki becomes Prone to Tears (very emotional and needy) and, for some reason, develops a craving for chocolate that's so strong that she can't bring herself to stop eating it, even though she hates chocolate.
        -   Caitlin acts bitchy and cranky when she's on her period, though it's unknown if she develops an aversion to chocolate because, unlike Nikki, Caitlin loves chocolate.
-   _Unsupervised_: Usually mild-mannered Megan went berserk when a new girl she was mentoring stole her cramp medication in a bizarre attempt at getting high.
