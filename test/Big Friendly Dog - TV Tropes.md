_"I have just met you, and I love you!"_

— **Dug the Dog**, _Up_

The opposite of the Angry Guard Dog, this canine Gentle Giant is big, friendly and often somewhat dim-witted, will only "kill" you (if at all) by licking you to death, and is likely to knock you over because he's just _so_ happy to see you. Slobber included free of charge. Truth in Television, of course, so much so that real life examples would be redundant.

Sometimes the "big" part can be taken to extremes (see the mention of _Clifford_, below) or have the dog be big enough (or the kid small enough) to ride on. In other hand, due to their likeable appearance, a Big Friendly Dog can often invoke Cuteness Proximity. In Real Life, large dogs tend to have shorter life spans than their smaller counterparts, but this is mostly glossed over in fiction.

See also Canis Major, Mega Neko, Precious Puppy and Cute Kitten. Mister Muffykins is generally the polar opposite in both size and temperament. Also contrast Bully Bulldog, Psycho Poodle and Hellhound. Compare Gentle Giant. Very often a Heroic Dog if they get the chance. Even a Big, Friendly Dog is still a descendant of the wolf, so don't discount the possibility of a canine version of Beware the Nice Ones if you threaten his pack. No relation to BFG.

    Alternate Reality Game 

-   _Welcome Home (Clown Illustrations)_ Barnaby is a huge beagle, and serves as _Welcome Home_'s comic relief, being Wally's best friend and a funny, smiling goofball.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Aria the Scarlet Ammo_: Haimaki (the wolf Reki manages to tame) starts as a plain wolf, but when Reki becomes more prominent in later volumes, he starts to act as an adorable furball outside of combat. This contributes to make him a character of his own.
-   _Azumanga Daioh_: Tadakichi-san is a Great Pyrenees, and Chiyo does actually ride him like a horse on occasion. How friendly is he? He's the first animal Sakaki can pet <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . He gets a little _too_ friendly in one episode, where he tries to imitate Maya the cat (who jumps into Sakaki's chest) and tackles Chiyo-chan _into the air_.
-   _Belle and Sebastian_: Belle is a Great Pyrenees large enough for Sebastian to ride her. The anime's original Japanese title is "_Meiken Jolie_", with the dog called "Jolly". It retains the source's title and names in the Western world. Belle is a very friendly dog unless someone she cares about is threatened, but she was falsely accused of attacking people without reason, so they're fugitives from the law together.
-   _Black Butler_: Pluto. Subverted since he can turn into a naked guy when excited.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Shou Tucker's dog Alexander, loved to show Edward his affection by jumping out of nowhere and crushing him underneath. The last thing Ed ever saw was a giant shadow descend from the sky. Sadly, he becomes the object of a Moral Event Horizon crossing moment when Tucker combines the dog and his daughter Nina into a chimera. Scar then kills it as a Mercy Kill.
    -   Just as adorable is Den, Winry's pet dog, incredibly friendly and strong enough to knock down two late-teenage boys like bowling pins before giving them a generous coating of dog drool. Made more awesome by how she has an automail leg. She's a _Cyborg_ Big Friendly Dog.
-   _Futari wa Pretty Cure_: Chuutaro, Honoka's Golden Retriever.
-   _Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin_: Moss the English mastiff may be a huge dog and one of the strongest in the series, but he also has a soft side for puppies and is shown taking good care of Chibi.
-   _Gintama_: Hilariously subverted by the _very_ large Sadaharu, most of whose appearances result in body parts getting chomped on, and only Kagura is strong enough that she is unhurt and takes his behavior as being playful. It's later revealed that he's a dog god, originally owned by a pair of miko sisters.
-   _Hello Sandybelle_: Sandybelle has a Scottish sheepdog/collie mix named Oliver, who's protective of her and also functions as a Horse of a Different Colour.

-   _Maison Ikkoku_: Soichiro, especially around the dog-phobic Mitaka.
-   _Naruto_: Kiba's dog Akamaru fills the part about being big enough to ride on after the time-skip, though he also fights alongside Kiba. This contrasts to earlier, when he could ride on _Kiba's_ head and intentionally peed on Naruto at least once. Its shown that Akamaru spends his fun time defending stray cats around Konoha from stray dogs, with Kiba translating what he says. He's also occasionally shown his affections to other ninjas, having licked Kiba, Hinata, and Ino.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Kotarou's dog spirits occasionally act this way, such as the time when they "attacked" Asuna by playfully licking her to submission.
-   _Remy Nobodys Girl_: While not ridiculously huge like other typical examples, Capi<small>◊</small> is bigger than Dolce and Zerbino, and is very friendly.
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_: Tamaki's dog Antoinette. She's pretty big, affectionate, and, when seen, usually pounces on Tamaki and licks him silly.
-   _Persona 4: The Animation_, Chie and Yukiko met as children when the latter was sad her family couldn't adopt a puppy. Chie took the puppy in, instead, and when she shows a picture of it to Yu, it's shown to have grown mighty large<small>◊</small>.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   In _Houndoom's Special Delivery_, Togepi is separated from the others during a Team Rocket attack and gets picked up by a Houndoom.

-   _Strawberry Marshmallow_: Ana's dog Frusciante is generally very friendly, although he likes to chase Miu around. Then again, who can blame him?

-   _Yohane the Parhelion -SUNSHINE in the MIRROR-_: Lailaps, a major character in both story position and sheer size.
-   _Yuri!!! on Ice_: Victor's dog Makkachin, who is a standard poodle. The first thing Makkachin does when meeting Yuri for the first time is to pounce on him enthusiastically and lick his face.

    Comic Books

-   _The Inhumans_: Lockjaw, the Inhuman royal family's teleporting dog, actually resembles a bulldog, normally a small dog breed, albeit larger and with antennae on his head. Many Marvel heroes have been on the receiving end of his friendly tongue. And Puppy, his offspring, who was briefly owned by Franklin Richards, before disappearing into Comic-Book Limbo. He eventually ends up in the care of one Kamala Khan, for _her_ sake more than his.

    Comic Strips 

-   Ruff from _Dennis the Menace (US)_ is Dennis' pet dog, and in some media such as the comic books and the 1986 cartoon, he was depicted as being much bigger than Dennis. Ruff eagerly follows Dennis around whether Dennis is running or riding his bicycle or skateboard. One of the strip's running gags is that even though Ruff chases cats, he is actually afraid of them.

-   _Garfield_: Odie, Jon's dog, doesn't have a big body, but his _tongue_ is huge and he likes using it.
-   In George Gately's _Heathcliff_, the titular cat gets repeatedly soaked in a flood of slobber from being licked when "Great-Big-Lovable Chauncey", the English sheepdog, stops by. In one strip, Heathcliff puts on Iggy's rain gear upon hearing that Chauncey was about to visit!

-   _Marmaduke_ is one of the classic examples, also fitting the "dumb" description. A very large Great Dane who means well despite the mischief.Also in film version. He's obviously a CG-produced dog, and voiced by Owen Wilson.
-   Woofie in _Mutts_ was explicitly described as such the week we met him. He's most often seen jumping on and kissing Mooch.

    Fan Works 

_Bucky And FUBAR_

_The Matrix_

-   In _Bringing Me To Life_ there's Hai, a black Wolf Hound. Hai is slightly smaller than a normal Wolf Hound, but still big.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Brave_, King Fergus' hounds would qualify though they are also hunting dogs. They mainly show their affections to him, though being hunting dogs, they also do get aggressive towards bears, such as the transformed Queen Elinor.
-   Ozzie from _Epic (2013)_ by Leafman standards. He's certainly very friendly and _loves_ licking.
-   _The Fox and the Hound_: Hunting dog Copper becomes this after he grows up due to him being playful and easygoing and in his mentor Chief's eyes, not taking the business of tracking game seriously (at first). Chief briefly scolds him about this being his "trouble on the hunt" at one point.
-   Toby from _The Great Mouse Detective_. He's large partly because all of the other familiar characters are mice. He's also based on a dog Sherlock Holmes picked up in _The Sign of Four_.
-   _Hercules_ has Pegasus (a big friendly _flying horse_) fill this role. As Zeus puts it, he has the heart of a horse and the brain of a bird. He still helps the main characters by flying them around and helping fight against Hades, and even licks Hercules and Phil's faces a few times.
-   _The Little Mermaid_ has Prince Eric's English sheepdog, Max. He is fond of jumping around and licking Eric and Ariel's faces on various occasions. He also serves an Evil-Detecting Dog as he's able to see through Ursula's disguise.
-   _Oliver & Company_: The ironically named Great Dane, Einstein is shown to be one of the various dogs raised by Fagin, and just as affectionate as all the other dogs towards him.

-   _Peter Pan_: Nana, the protective Saint Bernard of Wendy.
-   Luis from _Rio_ is a Tracey Morgan-voiced bulldog, thus only seeming big by comparison to the birds he towers over, and who excessively salivates. He initially chases Blu and Jewel, before showing he is actually a gentle dog who agrees to help remove their chains.
-   Duke from _The Secret Life of Pets_. He's at first reckless but he does have a sympathetic backstory. Under normal circumstances he's a gentle big dog.
-   Spike from _Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas_ is a friendly mastiff owned by Sinbad himself. He shows his friendly side by heading over to lick Marina's face after Sinbad tosses her in a room.

-   _Strange World_: Legend, the Clade family's sheepdog in is big, friendly, and always up for adventures.
-   _The Sword in the Stone_: Tiger and Talbot, the two castle dogs, immediately tackle young Wart (the future King Arthur) to lick him together, both so persistent they are grabbed off of him by Ector.
-   Though a rapper from 1912, the dog from _Titanic: The Legend Goes On_ is one of these. He saves a little mouse from being eaten by a cat.

-   _Toy Story 2_: While he's a small regular-sized mutt on a normal human scale, Buster falls into this at least through the point of view of the toys. Buster is rather crazy but unlike Scud from _Toy Story_ he's actually playful and friendly. Heck, he even helped Woody rescue Wheezy. Jessie was able to understand Buster in one scene due to her fondness for animals.
-   _Up_: As mentioned, Dug provides the page quote and is a fairly sizable dog besides. He was one of many dogs working for Charles Muntz, the film's Big Bad, and like the other dogs, he has a collar that can translate his thoughts, allowing him to communicate with humans. He is both the nicest and stupidest of the dogs, taking an immediate liking to both Carl and Russel. By the end of the film, he turns against Muntz and joins Carl.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Against a Crooked Sky_, Russian's large, scruffy dog Bar Killer loves Sam and keeps following him around the small cave where they're staying.
-   _Alice in Wonderland_:
    -   _Alice in Wonderland (2010)_: The bandersnatch - a character mentioned in Lewis Carroll's famous nonsense poem _Jabberwocky_ - at first comes off as a heatless attack dog used by the red queen Iracabeth. Gradually, however, it’s revealed that he suffers very poor treatment at her hands and in truth is surprisingly sweet and gentle. After Alice shows him kindness, he heals a wound he himself inflicted using his tongue, rescues her from the queen’s soldiers, and becomes her mount in the final battle.
    -   In the sequel _Alice Through the Looking Glass_, this role is made even more explicit, as he affectionately greets Alice as soon as she arrives, and continues to provide transport during her journeys.

-   _The Sandlot_: The "Beast" turns out to be a big friendly dog by the name of Hercules.

-   _Stella Maris_: Stella's dog companion nearly goes up to her waist (Mary Pickford was 1.54 meters, or 5'0). He's however a very friendly and protective dog. Stella received a small Pomeranian-looking dog as a present, however it ended up running off due to it not being as well-trained as Teddy. The unnamed dog comes back in The Stinger.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_: Jake's pet dog Homer, a golden retriever. Aside from being Jake's very first morph, Homer shows up infrequently in early books as a source of some comedy relief.

-   In Terrance Dicks _Baker Street Irregulars_ series, a Snooping Little Kid is caught by some criminals who threaten to let their Angry Guard Dog eat him. Unimpressed, the kid just orders the dog to "Sit!" and it does — he points out that guard dogs are trained to guard, not eat people. The dog later gets adopted as a Team Pet (and in a later novel, another criminal discovers that it can be an Angry Guard Dog if provoked enough).
-   _Bat_: Ezra has a mastiff named Pumpkin who weighs 120 pounds and is still growing. Every time there's a visitor, he rushes to the door to slobber on them.

-   J. R. R. Tolkien's _Beren and Lúthien_: Huan, the Hound of Valinor, is an intelligent, immortal wolfhound the size of a horse. He also helps Luthien escape from his former master Celegorm, who captured her when he found out she was on a quest to find a Silmaril, and afterward helps to slay Carcharoth, the werewolf who ate the Silmaril (along with Beren's hand). However, it was prophesied that Huan would only be killed by the greatest werewolf ever to live, and so even though he killed Carcharoth he died in the process.
-   _Chalet School_: Rufus, a Saint Bernard puppy who Joey Bettany rescues from drowning while the school is in Tyrol, and who later becomes a skilled tracker and guard dog. After Rufus dies, the school give Joey another Saint Bernard puppy as a present, who she names Bruno. Bruno is more rambunctious than Rufus and tends to jump on people, but is a lot more gentle around Joey's frail daughter Phil.

-   _Circle of Magic_: Sandry, Daja, Briar, and Tris have Little Bear, a puppy they save early on in the series. He grows up very friendly and, appropriate to the name, very big.
-   _Clifford the Big Red Dog_: The titular character is, of course, the logical extreme of this trope, standing approximately as tall as a _two story house_. He actually started off as a small puppy who grew huge thanks to his owner Emily Elizabeth's "love" — at least, that's the official story.
-   _Discworld_: Thcrapth— er, Scraps from _Carpe Jugulum_. So aggressively friendly that Death allowed Scraps to return to life to keep him from fetching Death's scythe for eternity.
-   _The Dog Stars_: Jasper is the main character's only real companion After the End. Although Higs has a human partner, a sociopathic killer who keeps them safe, he prefers the company of his gentle and loyal watchdog.
-   _The Dresden Files_: Mouse is actually a very intelligent magical creature, a hybrid of a normal dog (implied to be a Tibetan mastiff) and a magical foo dog bred to guard Chinese temples.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  As a puppy he was small enough that the protagonist carried him around in a jacket pocket for a whole book (_Blood Rites_), but when he's grown to full size he's enormous (Harry named him without knowing how big he would get). Harry suspects that he's actually intelligent enough to be deliberately invoking this trope, and based on what we've seen since he's almost certainly right. As he puts it, "Really big dogs that aren't acting overtly friendly tend to make people nervous". Heck, when Mouse wants to be intimidating, a lot of the time he doesn't even growl. He just stops acting friendly and looks at you, which anyone familiar with dogs knows can often be just as bad. Not only is he very physically intimidating, but the responses he's received from various other magical indicates he's got a lot of power on that axis as well. A Fallen Angel is freaked out just by being in his presence, and even Queen Mab is quite polite to him. In short, if you're evil or trying to harm Dresden, he is straight up bad news. Then in _Changes_ Harry's Fairy Godmother turns him into a dog and he's able to understand Mouse:
    
    **Mouse:** _"Restore them before I rip your ass off. Literally rip it off"_.
    
-   _Family Skeleton Mysteries_: Byron the Akita isn't that big compared to some examples, but he _is_ friendly.

-   _Good Dog, Carl!_: This series of children's books feature a Rottweiler caring for a baby through various wacky hijinks. The baby often rides him like a pony, and Carl always manages to get the mess cleaned up before Mom gets home.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Carl does defy one aspect of the Big, Friendly Dog stereotype — he's actually incredibly _smart._
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Fang, Hagrid’s enormous black boarhound, is highly affectionate. Whenever Harry and friends visit, Fang barks, tries to lick them, and has a tendency to drool. Said to be a coward, but also fairly intelligent for the trope, at least going to get backup when he runs away.
    -   Subverted in _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_ when Hagrid acquires Fluffy - a literal Cerberus - to guard the titular stone (while Fang’s name belies his affectionate tendencies, Fluffy’s name masks his literal killer instinct).
    -   Though not literally a dog, Sirius Black’s animagus form is a black canine the size of a bear, and he often plays up the friendly, protective side of such an animal while in form.
-   _I Wish You All the Best_: The first time Ben visits Nathan's house, his golden retriever Ryder knocks Ben to the ground and starts licking their face.
-   _John Carter of Mars_: Woola is a big friendly dog-like beast who accompanies John Carter on his earlier adventures on Mars.

-   _The Man with the Terrible Eyes_: The Man's dog, named Dog, is a very big and very friendly dog (or at least something that looks like a dog), as long as you're not a shadow monster or someone trying to hurt his master.
-   _Mercy Thompson_: It's noted in the first novel that werewolves in wolf form and aren't doing anything aggressive have a sort of glamour that causes people who aren't used to werewolves to mistake them for large, friendly dogs. Mercy is able to pass Adam off as her pet Saint Bernard due to this.
-   _Nancy Drew_: One book from the _Nancy Drew Files_ features a suspect named Tony, who has two pet German Shepherds named Fred and Max. The two dogs are absolutely tame and eager to make new friends. The only way he can get them to act ferocious for the climax (to intimidate the bad guys into surrendering) is by pretending that he's about to give them a bath.
-   _North To Benjamin_: The titular character, who's a big, elderly dog.
-   _Old Kingdom_: The Disreputable Dog mostly falls under this, with the fact that she talks and is really the avatar of one of the most powerful beings in the universe.
-   _Orconomics_: When the heroes find themselves in an orc village (assuming they've been taken prisoner), they pass by a kennel full of massive, slavering wargs. The orcs laugh and say that the wargs can "have their fun" once the chief is done with them. After the misunderstanding is cleared up and the heroes realize they're not prisoners, they come back the same way and are assaulted by the wargs, which refuse to leave them alone until they get belly scratches.
-   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_: Mrs. O'Leary, a hellhound who used to belong to Quintus Read: Daedalus and was turned over to Percy at the end of _Battle of the Labyrinth_. Oddly enough, for a larger-than-life Hellhound, she's very loving, playful, and _loves_ her human/demigod friends.
-   _Peter Pan_: Nana is not so "dumb", at least for a dog given that she quite capably lived up to her name/job description.
-   _Pinocchio’s Sister_: Sparkle Bob, a retriever. He seems rather big and powerful and he loves everybody, especially his owner Rosie Pelosi.

-   _Stephanie Plum_: Joe Morelli owns Bob, a vaguely Golden Retriever-shaped blob of fur. He has an appetite to match his size and enthusiasm, and isn't very picky. Joe once left him in his car, and when he came back, Bob had eaten _the front seat_.
-   Stephen King: A recurring trope in his works
    -   _Cujo_, twisted cruelly when he turns rabid. A portion of the horror of the book is seeing Cujo's simple thoughts warp as the rabies drives him mad. Hilariously, the film version had a genuine problem with the Truth in Television: Try as they might, the filmmakers just couldn't make a real St. Bernard act convincingly aggressive, so they disguised a Rottweiler for the more aggressive scenes; and even then, they had to tape the dog's tail to his leg so that it wouldn't wag.
    -   His novel _Under the Dome_, with its ensemble cast, contains a few. Audrey, a golden retriever, warns one family when their daughter has seizures. Clover, a German Shepard, also plays happily with the children before he shows the darker side of this trope when his master is pushed down stairs...
    -   Kojak from _The Stand_, an Irish Setter in the novel and a mixed breed (mostly Labrador Retriever) in the film. "If all things serve the will of God, maybe that goes for big dumb dogs, too".
    -   A sad version in _IT_. Mike's dog, Mr. Chips, is so friendly he eats the poisoned treats that Henry Bowers feeds him. He even wags his tail as he's dying.
-   _Survivor Dogs_: Much of the cast, especially the ex-Leashed Dogs, are large and friendly dogs. Even Storm counts when she isn't riled up.

-   _They Are Smol_: The Dorarizin are lupine aliens larger than polar bears. While humans find them pants-crappingly terrifying, the Dorarizin think we're freaking adorable since we smell like their pups. The danger of a Dorarizin killing a human with kindness is very real, and humans working on Dorarizin vessels have to bunk with an adult male to mask the odor so the females don't go Mama Bear in an attempt to protect the "baby" human.
-   _Vigilauntie Justice_: Cookie, Peggy and Carole's dog, is big enough to deter people at night and incredibly friendly to almost everyone.
-   _You Have a Match_: Savvy's Labrador Rufus introduces himself to Abby by knocking her over and aggressively licking her face.
-   _Young Wizards_: Kit's dog, Ponch, loves to play with him and chase (but not catch) squirrels. When Ponch is eventually revealed to be roughly the equivalent of Jesus, this trope makes it all the more jarring.

-   Comet from _Full House_ is the Tanner Family's pet golden retriever, introduced in the series' third season.

-   Ghost, Jon Snow's pet direwolf on _Game of Thrones_, turns into a Big Friendly Dog with people he trusts, especially Jon, Sam and Gilly. Otherwise...
-   _Human Target_: Carmine, Chris's dog is supposed to be a guard dog. He'd prefer to sleep and eat.
-   _It's Me or the Dog_: Victoria considers training a Big Friendly Dog to _not_ jump up and slobber all over people is an important step in proper dog behavior, since a lot of people are dog-phobic and a sufficiently-sized pooch can cause harm just by being "friendly".
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: Huan and Luthien, have their Memorial Statues carved together by the Elves of Lindon.
-   In a season four episode of _Matlock_, the murder victim has a Caucasian Shepard named Otis that would jump up on and lick the face of everyone he met.
-   In one _Midnight Caller_ episode, Billy brings his St. Bernard, Mighty, to work with him. She slobbers all over the equipment, causing the On The Air light to go out.
-   _Search_: Leo, Dong-jin's German Shepherd, is very friendly. So is Mac, Leo's replacement. The flashback to Dong-jin playing tug-of-war with Leo is one of the most heart-warming scenes in the series.

-   _The Terror_: Neptune, a Newfoundland dog that accompanies the crew. You're probably better off not knowing his fate.
-   _Victorious_: Jade mentions them in her "Stuff I Hate" video.
    
    **Jade:** I hate it when I go to someone's house, and their dog jumps all over me, and the owner says: "oh, it's okay, he's friendly". Guess what; I'm not. Get your dog off me!
    

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Fraggle Rock_: Sprocket is a big, friendly — if cowardly — sheepdog who is Doc's pet. Sprocket is initially suspicious of the Fraggles, but eventually warms up to and befriends Gobo, on some rare occasions even entering Fraggle Rock itself and going on adventures with the Fraggles.
-   _Sesame Street_: Barkley is a giant and playful dog who is Linda's pet and understands American sign language. Whenever he runs while somebody is walking him, that somebody often gets pulled along.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The adventure EX1 _Dungeonland_ has a giant dog nearly as big as an elephant. It will attempt to play with the PCs, and will play "tug of war" and "fetch the stick" with any stick-like objects the party may have (staff, pole, etc.).
    -   D&D also has Riding Dogs, which are Exactly What It Says on the Tin: dogs big enough to be ridden, at least by small characters.
    -   Blink dogs, while not as big as some examples, are larger than average for real-world dogs, and were among the first Lawful Good monsters in the _D&D_ game.
-   _Pathfinder_ has the Cayhounds, a race of Chaotic Good teleporting sapient mastiffs. While not at Clifford-level, they are big for domestic dogs, and since they're always good-aligned, they're descended from mastiffs, and their divine patron, Cayden Cailean, is a pretty jolly guy, it's safe to assume they're friendly. They also have a neotenous form, the caypup, available as an improved familiar.
-   In _Warhammer_ the Beasts of Nurgle have this sort of personality, desiring only to meet new people and make friends with them. Unfortunately, where most dogs have slobber, Beasts of Nurgle have acid. They jump up at you, knock you over, and crush and burn you as they crawl over with acidic slime. Of course, because their new friends stop playing with them so quickly, they have to find new ones.

-   _Beyond Good & Evil_: The aptly-named Woof is an Old English Sheepdog the size of a _refrigerator._ His tongue is always hanging out of his mouth, and he loves to cuddle, play, and chase insects. One of the end credits photos shows the aftermath of him bowling Jade over while chasing a ladybug.
-   In _Crusader Kings II_, you can get a hunting hound from a friend as part of the Hunting focus. If you then switch to the Family focus, there's a potential event where your dog starts befriending children in your court (for a bump in Relationship Values).
-   Hank's dog Sumo from _Detroit: Become Human_. It's a giant St. Bernard whose only response to Connor smashing a window to get into Hank's house is to walk up and sniff him. Even when Hank tells it to get violent as Connor takes him to the bathroom to sober up, it doesn't.
    
    **Hank:** _\[drunkenly\]_ Sumo, attack!  
    **Sumo:** _\[from the other room\]_ Woof!  
    **Hank:** _\[happily\]_ Good dog. Attack!
    
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins_ has a Mabari war hound named... Dog. Despite being a trained war hound and attack critter, in cutscenes and conversations this is _exactly_ how he comes across. The only members of your party that Dog doesn't get along with are the dwarf Oghren, who thinks Dog stole his pants (he didn't) and thinks Dog is perfectly-sized to pull a chariot bearing him into battle; Alistair, who keeps forgetting that Dog is sentient and can understand everything he is saying (and even then things end up well enough after some initial problems); and Shale, who used to be a living statue and whose sole interaction with Dog is to warn him not to mark his territory on her. Even Loghain gets along very well with him, if he's allowed to join. He isn't too crazy about Wynne since she insists on giving him baths and wants to tie a pretty pretty bow around his stubby tail.
    -   _Dragon Age II_: The sequel's "Black Emporium" DLC gives Hawke a Mabari war hound that can be summoned into battle. Party members will visit Hawke's home throughout the game just to see the Mabari. Anders, being a cat person, is the only one who doesn't particularly like the dog — but the dog lavishes affection on him anyway.
-   King from _EarthBound (1994)_. While he may be cowardly he isn't affected by the evil power of Giygas. The novel adaptation refers to his breed as an English Sheep Dog.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_ series has Barbas, the external conscience of Clavicus Vile, the Daedric Prince of Bargains and Wishes. Barbas normally takes the form of Vile's Canine Companion, and usually attempts to talk people out of Vile's deals, much to Vile's irritation. Following the events of Vile's quest in _Oblivion_, Vile gains the means to split himself away from Barbas and banishes Barbas to the mortal plane. However, since Barbas contains a measure of Vile's power, this left Vile weakened and trapped in a single shrine high in the remote mountains of Skyrim. Vile's _Skyrim_ quest is kicked off when the Dragonborn meets Barbas, who is attempting to reunite with Vile. He joins the Dragonborn as a temporary companion in order to get to Vile's shrine. There, Vile gives a quest to the Dragonborn and Barbas to retrieve the Rueful Axe, which Vile previously gave as a granted wish to a wizard looking to cure his daughter of lycanthropy. After retrieving the axe, the Dragonborn has a choice: do what Vile asks and use it to "kill" Barbas, who will then need to spend a few centuries reforming in Oblivion giving Vile a break, or reunite the two, after which Barbas convinces Vile to give his Masque in exchange for the axe.
-   _Fallout_ has Dogmeat, a series of Wasteland dogs who can befriend the protagonists. They're all very big dogs (the one in _3_ is a Blue Heeler, and the one in 4 is a German Shepherd), they have Undying Loyalty to the player (_4_s Dogmeat is the only companion to not have an affinity meter, because he loves you no matter what), they'll fetch items, and they can tear out the throats of anyone who dares try and harm you and your party- and the creator of _4_'s Dogmeat comments that Dogmeat's fighting style is mostly based around holds because his goal isn't to hurt people, it's to protect you.
-   _Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light_: Brandt becomes a gray husky in his animal form, and since he's a friendly Nice Guy of a hero, that makes him this.
-   _Hades_: Cerberus is still the giant three-headed Hellhound of myth... but because you're playing as Zagreus, son of Hades, he's nothing but tail wags and licks to you. There's an option to pet Cerberus every time you're in the House of Hades, and when you encounter him in the Stygian Temple, Zagreus utterly _refuses_ to harm him, instead seeking a way to bribe him into moving aside. There's even a purchasable wall scroll showing infant versions of Zagreus, Thanatos, and Megaera playing with Cerberus, who's more than willing to let them.
-   _Half-Life 2_: Subverted by D0g. Who is big and friendly to the protagonists, but is also a robot that's shaped more like a gorilla than a dog. (Though he can play fetch with an electric ball, and will valiantly defend his loved ones. And he _is_ adorable.) Alyx has been adding modifications to him for years. It's possible that he originally did look like a dog.
-   The default dog in _Harvest Moon_ is a small Beagle, however various games such as _Harvest Moon: Animal Parade_ let you adopt larger but just as friendly dogs.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   Urz in _Mass Effect 2_, fits all the criteria... except that he's not a dog. He's a varren, a creature colloquially known as a "fishdog", and is just as Ugly Cute as that name implies. However, he still allows Shepard to pet him and, if fed some pyjack meat, will happily follow Shepard and company around Tuchanka, generally being adorable, in complete contrast to other examples of his breed, who all try to rip your head off. And you can get him to pitfight other varren for you. (Did we mention that he's actually a champion pitfighter?) If he loses, he has to go to the medical tent until you leave Tuchanka and come back. A short story posted on the third game's website reveals that Urz has had many adventures throughout the galaxy under many different names where he's either saved lives or changed them for the better.
    -   In _Mass Effect 3_, the _Citadel DLC_ reveals that Jack has rescued a _biotic_ varren that she's named Eezo from an abused animal's centre. Shepard ends up playing a game of catch with him using a frying pan (originally grabbed for self-defense).
-   The Palamutes from _Monster Hunter: Rise_ are big enough to ride on, but when not out on a hunt behave like big ol' puppy dogs who love nothing more than treats, belly rubs, and licking their owner's face. They're not so friendly if you happen to be a monster, though.
-   The _Monster Rancher_ series gives us the Baku, a large, blond dog whose size and features remind one of a hippopotamus. Its attacks include deafening barks, messy licking, and falling asleep, among more traditional attacks like biting and ramming. As an additional fun point, in the 4th game they can actually be ridden inside dungeons to go trampling through barricading underbrush like a big, happy elephant. It is awesome.
-   People tend to think that _Ōkami_'s Amaterasu is a big friendly dog: she's Big, she's friendly with muggles... She is NOT a dog.
-   While small on a human scale, _Pikmin 4_ introduces a friendly dog-like creature called Oatchi that can be used to cart around the main character and some of their Pikmin across water, carry objects with the strength of multiple Pikmin, and sniff out castaways, treasures, and other objectives. He can even be controlled independently like a second captain when he's separated from the player character.
-   _Pokémon_: Stoutland is a plump (hence the name), 3'11" Scottish Terrier-like Pokémon that makes a great guard dog and is known to rescue people trapped in the mountains. In the Gen VII games, the player can ride around on one. It's actually pretty fast in spite of its chubbiness and can detect hidden items.

-   Zib, the pilot of Vlad in _Rising Thunder_, is what happens when you make one of these a mech pilot.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Poochy from _Yoshi's Island_, who serves as a Power Up Mount for Yoshi that can walk across dangerous terrain.
    -   The ghosts of Evershade Valley from _Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon_ turn hostile when the Dark Moon gets shattered, with the exception of the Polterpup, whose troublesome meddling in Luigi's quest stems from a desire to play rather than a desire to hurt.
-   The Inadvisably Big Dog in _Sunless Skies_ embodies this trope: he is one very large puppy oozing with affection and happiness, whose eagerness coupled with his gargantuan size tends to bring some property destruction around. It does help that his portrait is the cutest and happiest thing you've ever seen in a _Failbetter Games_ game. As the game puts it, there are very few things in the High Wilderness that are so innocently happy.

_It stares at you, drooling with love. When you meet its gaze, its vast tail wags, dusting your wash things from the sink onto the floor._

-   _Undertale_: Greater Dog is a big white dog in heavy plate armor carrying a spear... it's a miniboss, but all it wants is to be petted and played with. If you ignore it a few times, it will even scootch closer to the screen just to give you Puppy-Dog Eyes and beg to be petted. The canine Amalgamate, Endogeny, is basically a Big Friendly Goo Dog, housing the combined essences of at least five canine monsters. It's all but outright stated to have a relative of Greater Dog somewhere in there, and thus it behaves similarly. In spite of its horrific appearance, it too just wants to be petted, even if its actions sound a bit erratic and creepy.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Double Homework_, Morgan has a dog, Barghest, which is large and intimidating but friendly toward pretty much everyone.
-   _To Heart 2_ has Genjimaru, Konomi's Old English Sheepdog. Despite being very friendly, he scares Tamaki to death by chasing after her (mainly because she's afraid of dogs; after the chase he stops and sounds apologetic when she trips and hurts herself and starts crying), and in _To Heart 2: Another Days_ he tackles Silfa on sight, causing her to talk in gibberish when he licks her face (of course, she hides in her box after that, only to get tackled again when she comes out). He also keeps Konomi company as she ponders on her relationship with Takaaki in her story path, seemingly talking to her as she is rambling.

    Webcomics 

-   _Boy and Dog_: Murphy weighs 90 pounds and is very benevolent and friendly.
-   _Freefall_: Florence is an uplifted wolf rather than a dog but she still acts like a large dog from time to time. This strip is a good example.

-   _Homestuck_: Becquerel the Reality Warper god-dog and Halley the completely normal dog, from whom Bec was partially cloned. Later, when Becquerel prototypes himself and Jack Noir gains his powers, Bec's Big, Friendly Dog loyalty is also carried over and Jack is forced to feel overwhelming love for Jade to the point where he is reduced to behaving like a lost, timid puppy around her. That's right, _Jack Noir_.
-   _Lola and Mr. Wrinkles_: Hugo, the St. Bernard next door, can readily be called upon to administer rescue hugs to a freezing person. The problem is that gentleness isn't his forte.
-   _Pixie and Brutus_: He may not look it, but Brutus can be surprisingly gentle when he needs to be, especially when his little buddy Pixie is involved. Of course, this doesn't hinder his ability to tear you to shreds.
-   _Questionable Content_: Jeph Jacques owns a Great Pyrenees named Shelby, and in the comic she's not depicted as being too bright, and among other things thinks her name is actually Shebly.

    Web Videos 

-   _The Autobiography of Jane Eyre_: Mr Rochester's dog Pilot is a Bernese Mountain Dog which is a breed of dogs that are generally extremely affectionate. Adele Rochester must be fond of Pilot as she drew a beautiful picture of him.
-   In the aftershows of _Critical Role_, Brian Foster's cattle dog mix Henry is often snuggled by the rest of the cast without a hint of complaint (with Laura commenting he was extremely good around her and Travis's son Ronin). The only time he's barked was when Marisha was trying to sneak around the set, saying hello to her and wanting to be pet.

    Western Animation 

-   _Animaniacs (1993)_:
    -   Runt is a stray dog who is bigger than his cat friend, Rita. He isn't very bright, hates cats, and thinks that Rita is a dog (which is why she is the only cat he doesn't hate), but he does care a lot about Rita, coming to her rescue if she's in trouble.
    -   Buttons is bigger than his child owner, Mindy, and is very protective of her, saving her from (and often taking beatings from) dangers she is otherwise oblivious to. Though he usually gets chewed out by Mindy's parents for breaking some minor house rule as a result of keeping Mindy safe, most of his shorts end with Mindy giving him a hug.
-   _Archer_: One episode involves an English Mastiff named Kazak that fits... unless anyone in his presence is waving around a firearm.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ / _The Legend of Korra_: While there are no actual “dogs” in either series (most animals are chimeras- i.e. hybrids of two or more real-world animals), plenty of creatures exhibit the same or similar behaviors.
    -   Appa, Avatar Aang’s flying bison and his team’s primary mode of transport. While normally conscious of his 10-ton size, Appa definitely shows his affection by pouncing and/or licking.

    -   The Polar Bear Dog Naga is Avatar Korra's animal companion. Naga's Establishing Character Moment is licking Korra's face over and over. Her friendliness extends to licking a police attendant's hair. She's also so big that multiple characters can ride on her back at once.

-   _The Casagrandes_: Lalo, a Bull Mastiff who is the size of a lion and is very friendly towards his owners.
-   _Classic Disney Shorts_: Pluto. He's based on a Bloodhound; Bloodhounds are almost always Big Friendly Dogs in real life. He's very nice to Mickey's friends.

-   _Danny Phantom_: The ghost dog. When it turns big, that means it's aggressive. However, the pup always makes an exception for Danny whom remains affectionate towards.
-   _Dinky Dog_: A Hanna Barbera creation (initially from _The All-New Popeye Hour_) and in exactly the same mold as _Clifford the Big Red Dog_, in that this big orange doggy grew from his owners' love.
-   _Family Guy_: _Road to the Multiverse_: In one of the many parallel dimensions visited by Stewie and Brian, anthropomorphic dogs are in charge of society, while humans are considered pets. Whenever the doorbell rings, dog-Peter gets extremely excited and bounds to affectionately greet whoever is outside.
-   _The Flintstones_: Dino, although not technically a dog. He's very loving toward his owners.

-   Chief from _HouseBroken_ is a big, dim-witted, fun loving Saint Bernard whose personality contrasts to that of the down-to-earth poodle Honey.
-   _The Jetsons_: Even more so than his spiritual cousin, Scooby-Doo, Astro has a tendency to affectionately pounce on and aggressively lick the ones he loves.
-   _Looney Tunes_: An old short about dogs featured a doberman pinscher. He was actually a fairly calm chap... but it didn't take long for the guy _named_ Doberman to sour on him.

-   _My Little Pony_
    -   _My Little Pony 'n Friends_: Dinah from the episode "Pony Puppy". She's so massive her dog house is as big as a small house, but she's is introduced rescuing a baby pony from drowning and never stops being affectionate, even if she's so huge she causes damage without meaning to. She's also a _baby_ and there are more of her kind that pick her up at the end of the episode. The ponies loved having her around so much they near instantly miss her.
    -   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
        -   In the episode "It's About Time", Cerberus looks fierce, being a three-headed Hell Hound as big as a house, but the only reason he shows up in Ponyville is because he wants to play. Granted, since he's the size of a house, even his play can be dangerous to the average pony, but Fluttershy pacifies him with a tummy rub easily enough. Later Twilight leads Cerberus back to the Gates of Tartarus by playing fetch with him during the entire trip.
        -   In the episode "Trade Ya", Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy comes across a rather vicious Orthros that they need to trade for a limited edition Daring Do book. Once Fluttershy pacifies it, it acts like a playful puppy for the rest of the episode.
-   _Nature Cat_: From the main cast, Hal is bigger than his friends, who are a cat, a bunny, and a mouse. He is very friendly with anyone he meets and is also very happy-go-lucky. A ditz he may be most of the time, he gives out useful solutions to some of the problems, but is clueless about it when complimented.
-   _Oh Yeah! Cartoons_: the short _Ollie and Frank_ had a Child Prodigy named Ollie create a gigantic Frankenstein monster dog named Frank, who was very loyal and friendly to his master.
-   _Peg + Cat_: this is the resolution of "The Big Dog Problem" — the big dog that's standing in front of the mailbox that Peg and Cat keep running away from is just one of these and even helps them to reach the mailbox so that they can mail their really important letters once they make friends with it.
-   _Pound Puppies (2010)_: There isn't a lick of the description above that doesn't apply to Niblet. He is easily the biggest, kindest, and least intelligent of the team.
-   _Scooby-Doo_: Being a Great Dane, Scooby is naturally very large. He's also very friendly, and a Lovable Coward.
-   _Skull Island (2023)_: Annie's beast companion Dog, one of the creatures native to the titular island, could be charitably described as a ten-foot-tall mutant bulldog.
