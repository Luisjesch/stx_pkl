I should think that my sister is very comfortable and very genteel. Probably if she met me she would turn up her nose with the utmost disgust and rush indoors to her spinster-mistress with squeals of indignation. "Squeak-squeak", she might say, "I very _nearly_ came face to face with an alley-cat." So you did, my darling, so you did. For an "alley-cat" is what I am and proud of it — as you shall hear. Not for me the comfortable parlour where my sister probably, at this very moment, snoozes while her mistress watches a boring programme on the electrical picture box.

In a world of Talking Animals, one commonplace issue amongst them is whether animals should live amongst humans or not. On one side are pets who tend to think stray animals are unmannered, disgusting, and/or pity cases who don't have the luxury of living amongst humans. On the other side, stray animals will often mock pets for being overly pampered playthings who are _owned_ by humans (who might themselves be either looked down upon or feared by strays, especially if they were abandoned or abused in their past).

Depending on how it's written this trope can have parallels of classism and racism. This may also sometimes have an allusion towards humans with the same problems, i.e those poor ones who live in the streets vs those born into a stable (if not rich) society.

A Pet into the Wild will likely face mockery and discrimination from strays who find out that he is, or used to be, a pet.

Note that tropes are flexible and that this doesn't just apply to pet animals. Any animal kept in captivity counts.

A subtrope of Animal Jingoism and Fantastic Racism. Also comparable to Cat/Dog Dichotomy and Dogs Hate Squirrels. See also From Stray to Pet and Abandoned Pet in a Box, for ways to get a character experienced with both sides of life.
