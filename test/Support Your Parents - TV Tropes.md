Family is important. Everyone knows that. But to what extent can characters go to emphasize that? Maybe a song? Fight alongside them? No, some characters go beyond that - they want to support their parents financially for raising them in love and care (or not, depending on the story), and will do anything for that. The job that they work on may even be disgusting, but they will work nonetheless. Supporting a family is that important.

Usually it leads to:

-   Good circumstances: When there are Good Parents, who do not have any problems with money, a child wants to support them anyway as a gratitude for all the love they received in their life.
-   Bad circumstances: When parents, while being good, are Cutting Corners, a child wants to help their parents get out of poverty and live a life worthy of their good deeds.
-   Dysfunctional Family: When parents are bad to the point where many would want to ignore them, they can either force a character to work for them, or child would support them despite all the hardships he would get as a result, because they are still his family.

An Immigrant's Tale stories may involve the immigrant in question sending some or all of their hard-earned money to their parents back home, as many immigrants have done in real life.

May cross with Former Child Star if the child actor's parents are financially supported by their child's fame.
