Romance between Police Forces and unofficial investigators (Amateur Sleuth, Private Detective, Magician Detective, etc) can be complicated. Expect the couple to go back-and-forth between helping each other with their work and getting in each other's way. Sometimes they'll have a Friend on the Force situation going on, where the cop provides the sleuth with information about a case, maybe even with access to the crime scene, and the sleuth, after discovering a culprit, will let the cop make the arrest. Other times, one or both may be sabotaging their partner's investigation, usually to keep them safe from finding the truth.

The relationship between these law enforcers and unofficial investigators is strained by many factors. They're often working towards the same goals and have a lot in common, but the police officer has rules and regulations to follow, which the independent sleuth often ignores and gets in the way of. The cop also has a duty to protect citizens from harm, a job not made any easier by their sleuth friend throwing themselves into dangerous situations. The cop may worry that their significant other will get hurt or killed one of these days, and try to dissuade their partner from sleuthing. It's not uncommon for the cop to come to the rescue when the sleuth gets in over their heads, resulting in a Rescue Romance. In some cases, the cop isn't even aware the person they're dating is an independent sleuth, forcing the sleuth to act like they're just really interested in their partner's work so they can get information to fuel their own investigation. Expect this secret to put a big strain on the relationship, with a dramatic confrontation when the cop inevitably finds out.

While this sort of relationship can theoretically exist in a Cop Show, most often the sleuth is the lead character and the cop is their Love Interest. As such, we're usually not meant to agree with the cop's objections to the sleuth's involvement in the case, and if the relationship goes on long enough, the cop will eventually come around.

-   In _Death Note_, Raye Penber, an FBI agent sent to Japan to aid in the investigation of the Kira case, does not want his fiancee, ex-FBI agent Naomi Misora, to get involved in the Kira case. Unfortunately for him, she was the better detective between the two. If he had let her get involved, the series would be one and a half volumes long, and both of them would still be alive.
-   In _Future Diary_, Uryuu (9th) has Detective Nijishima, who swings between wanting to help her and wanting to help someone else in favor of her throughout the series. Near the end, he decides he wants to help her because he has fallen for her. He proposes about ten minutes screen time before his death. At the end, she goes back in time and marries him before he was supposed to die, and averts his death.
-   _Nightwalker_ has a Friends with Benefits type relationship between Shido, the vampire detective protagonist, and Yayoi, who works for a monster control secret agency.

-   Stephanie Plum has both an off/on boyfriend (Joe Morelli) and an off/on bounty hunter/mercenary boyfriend, Ranger. Ranger is somewhat more cool with Stephanie's cases than Joe is.
-   Kinsey Millhone rarely dates, but she has had a boyfriend (Cheney Phillips). Kinsey is an ex-cop and PI, so the disapproval thing was not an issue.
-   In Tanya Huff's _Blood Books_ (and the TV show made from them, _Blood Ties (2007)_), the heroine is a cop-turned-PI, and her human love interest/former police partner fills this role.
-   In _A Mantra For Murder_ series, A.J.'s cop boyfriend Jake.
-   In Earlene Fowler's quilt-themed mysteries, quilter and Amateur Sleuth Benni Harper dates Officer Gabe who later becomes the police chief, and Benni's husband.
-   In the novels by Ngaio Marsh, artist Agatha Troy has her husband, Detective Chief Inspector (later Chief Superintendent) Roderick Alleyn. Several of the novels begin with events that happen to her (painting a portrait at some country house or going on a trip by herself), and he comes into the picture later. He's never happy about his wife being involved in crime, particularly murder.
-   Daisy Dalrymple from the Carola Dunn novels of the same name eventually marries the Inspector Lestrade of her series. Since it's set in the 1920s, he's remarkably enlightened about her solving what seems to be most of his cases.
-   In _Seeking Who He May Devour_, by Fred Vargas, Jean-Baptiste Adamsberg plays this role, since the focus is more on his lover Camille. However, due to their complicated relationship, Camille is the most reluctant to ask for his help (the idea of getting the help of an "unusual cop" originally comes from Soliman), while Adamsberg doesn't really care about the case itself but is rather pleased to help her.

-   Jill Churchill's Jane Jeffry is a mother of three with a boyfriend on the force.
-   In _The Dresden Files_, Harry Dresden and Karin Murphy are Just Friends but otherwise fit this dynamic perfectly (especially _vis-a-vis_ their mutual trust issues in the first few books) and they sometimes suggest that they would be a couple if they weren't certain this is how it would turn out. They eventually decide to hook up after she is fired; fate naturally has other plans.
-   Private eye Ukiah Oregon is dating FBI agent Indigo Zheng.
-   A favorite device of gay-mystery writer Josh Lanyon, used in both the Adrien English mysteries and the Holmes and Moriarity series. In the latter case, J.X. Moriarity is an ex-cop-turned-writer, but (as with Adrien and Jake) J.X.'s experience and hard-nosed cop sensibility is used as a counterpoint to Christopher Holmes's more intuitive amateur sleuthing.

    Live Action TV 

-   _The Closer_ - Brenda's boyfriend-then-husband Fritz is an FBI agent. Brenda belongs to the LAPD, but she has often found it useful to have an inside source in the FBI who can get information or do things that the LAPD cannot. He will sometimes offer to help, but there have been times when the FBI and the LAPD both had mutually exclusive interests in the same suspect (for example, a suspected murderer may be a mid-level member of a crime syndicate, and the FBI may consider his usefulness as a snitch above the interests of the LAPD). In these cases, Brenda will do something underhanded, in essence tricking the FBI, and, more personally, Fritz. Fritz will often take this very hard and will call Brenda out, often gaining the sympathies of the audience (Brenda will often take an "ends justify the means" defense with Fritz when he reacts this way).
-   _Crossing Jordan_ - Jordan, a medical examiner, shouldn't be anywhere where a freshly-found dead body isn't. But she constantly goes snooping, often dragging Det. Woody along with her (and just as often following him to where the action is).

-   In _Moonlight_, Beth's boyfriend is a district attorney. He is very adamant about her staying away from cases he is investigating/prosecuting, although he has no idea that she is slowly falling for Friendly Neighborhood Vampire Mick.
-   In _Tracker_, Mel's on-and-off boyfriend is a police detective. He is constantly doing favors for her, hoping to rekindle their relationship. He even searches for her missing fiancé, who disappeared years ago. He is distrustful of Cole, whose quirky personality and speech patterns don't help matters.

-   _McMillan & Wife_: Sally Mc Millan has her husband, San Francisco Police Commissioner Stewart McMillan. Since they are a married couple, they regularly discuss crime and its solution (frequently in bed or some other intimate setting).
-   _Castle (2009)_: Detective Beckett became Castle's Cop Girlfriend once they resolved their Unresolved Sexual Tension. Castle's Genre Savvy\-ness as a mystery fiction author is useful for solving cases and he uses Beckett as the inspiration for his new character.

    -   Andy for Prue in the first season. He serves as a source for information and help within the police department with cases concerning magic.
    -   This then becomes something of an attraction for Paige: she has Federal Agent Kyle Brody in season seven, an unnamed cop in season eight, and Henry in the same season, who she then goes on to marry. For Paige, at least, she meets all of them in the course of her Charmed duties - Agent Brody is investigating the Avatar threat and needs the sisters' help, who then offers to clear them of suspicion with his influence, and one of Henry's parolees is an innocent Paige is supposed to save.
-   In _Parks and Recreation_, this is applied (an subverted) in Season 2's "Greg Pikitis," in which Leslie Knope (a bureaucrat in the parks department) plays detective while trying to prove that the titular teenage delinquent is responsible for vandalizing a statute. She tries to get her boyfriend Dave Sanderson—a local cop—to help out, but it turns out that small-town police departments simply can't swing that.
-   In _Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries_, Phryne Fisher is a sleuth who, er, has a lot of Unresolved Sexual Tension with inspector Jack Robinson. It's only a matter of time before they fall into this trope. Also, Phryne's assistant Dot is dating constable Hugh.
