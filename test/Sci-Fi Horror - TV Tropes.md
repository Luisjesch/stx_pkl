One giant leap in terror. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_In space, no one can hear you scream_

Sci-Fi Horror is a sub-genre of both Science Fiction and Horror that uses scientific advances or futuristic settings as a source of fear.

Notably, the first Sci-Fi genre work<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  was also one of the first works in this sub-genre: Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_, published in 1818.

The broad variation of the parent genres allow for a multitude of ways this can play out: scientific advancements being used for evil ends or creating new, dangerous lifeforms; man's hubris leading to horrific consequences because of our reliance on technology; alien monsters menacing the characters; or the vast loneliness of outer space being a source of ontological dread, branching into Cosmic Horror Story and Space Isolation Horror. Compare and contrast Digital Horror.

-   Several _Cthulhu Mythos_ stories are within this genre, and the shared setting pretty much implies this for any of its horrors. H. P. Lovecraft's stories clearly within the subgenre include:
    -   _At the Mountains of Madness_
    -   "The Colour Out of Space"
    -   "Cool Air"
    -   "The Dreams in the Witch House"
    -   "From Beyond"
    -   "Herbert West–Reanimator"
    -   _The Shadow Out of Time_
    -   _The Whisperer in Darkness_
-   _Daikaiju Yuki_, or at least the Mokwa trilogy that takes place within the same universe. The rest is more traditional science-fiction.
-   _The Dark Descent of Elizabeth Frankenstein_, a retelling of _Frankenstein_ through the perspective of the title character.
-   _Dark Warrior_
-   _Dead Space_
    -   _Dead Space: Martyr_

-   _The Expanse_ is half this and half Space Opera. In the words of the author himself in the afterword of _Leviathan Wakes_:
    
    _"I've never written anything in my life that didn't at least blur the line into horror. If I wrote greeting cards, they'd probably have a squick factor."_

    -   _Rifters Trilogy_
    -   _Blindsight_ starts out with a world where humanity is becoming obsolete in the face of cyborgs, hyper-intelligent A.I., and genetically reconstructed vampires with savant skills and no morals whatsoever. Then a team is sent out into the Oort cloud to make contact with aliens and find what appears to be simply a non-sentient biological probe at first, but later it dawns on them that the aliens aren't sentient but are much, much smarter than them. Plus, self-awareness is nothing but an anomaly that aliens see as a threat and vampires and A.I. are evolving away from.

-   In _Eclipse Phase_, the Earth was taken over by A.I.s that made head-stealing drones, rampant Grey Goo swarms, and viruses that take over people's minds or mutate them into horrific monsters, all of which invoke Sanity checks on the behalf of players. Due to the gregarious use of Brain Uploading, the Player Characters can expect to be decapitated, slowly dissolved molecule by molecule, mind-controlled, mutated, and vaporized by their own employers to prevent whatever they caught from infecting what's left of civilization, repeatedly. Also, transhumanity has explored dozens of planets and found ruins of long-extinct alien races, but only one that is extant has been encountered.
