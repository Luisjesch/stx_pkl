I was wondering where I'd put that CHCl<sub>3</sub>.

**Clank:** You'd be surprised how often scientists get kidnapped.  
**Scientist:** Actually, this is mein _third_ time. I'm starting to get used to it.

An occupational hazard of having a specialized talent in demand is that sometimes "demand" can be taken literally — a professional such as a scientist or engineer is kidnapped and coerced into working for the bad guys, under threat to their life or the lives of their loved ones. Although there should be some obvious inherent risks to letting someone hostile to your plans work so intimately with them, doing things no one else in your organization fully understands, the success rate for this method seems to be pretty high — at least until the heroes get around to rescuing them, until the villain decides that they've outlived their usefulness, or until the scientist takes advantage of everyone's ignorance to sabotage the evil plan or craft a weapon that allows him to escape.

Note that this is not the same as kidnapping someone for information, using them as a Living MacGuffin, or having someone Made a Slave for menial (or sexual) tasks — but having a professional work intimately with the most delicate aspects of a plan, requiring highly specialized skills.

Subtrope of An Offer You Can't Refuse. Compare Reluctant Mad Scientist, Kidnapped Doctor, and Forced Creativity. Also see The Worm Guy, a (usually) more benign version, and Doctor von Turncoat, a (usually) more amoral version. Inverted with Kidnapped for Experimentation, where the scientist is the one _doing_ the kidnapping.

-   In the 70s and 80s _Kamen Rider_ series, a highly common plot of the week was a scientist being forced to build some doomsday device or plague or whatever, either by kidnapping the scientist (and it's his kid who runs into the Rider by dumb luck) or the scientist's loved ones (then it's the scientist who runs into the Rider by dumb luck.) Note to scientists: if you ever get kidnapped by any Nebulous Evil Organization run by the disembodied voice of Gorō Naya (and there's a lot of 'em!) do _not_ expect them to actually keep their deal.
-   In _Walker, Texas Ranger_, a geneticist named Susan Lee (played by Julia Nickson) fell under this trope not once, not twice, but _three times_ she's appeared. In her first appearance, "Higher Power" (Season 5), she was kidnapped by a Chinese warrior named Chang, who sought instead to kidnap her son, Davey, who is the reincarnation of Master Rin's former master, Lama Dolgin. Then, in "Heart of the Dragon" (also in Season 5), she and her father, Dr. Henry Lee were kidnapped by a Chinese gang led by Jiang Chu, when they were intending to kidnap Henry's student, Henry Wu, who had stolen an ancient Jade Dragon from them hoping it would heal his sister who was left in a coma after their parents were killed by a drunk driver.

    Video Games 

-   _Fallout 2_: Downplayed by Vic the repairman, who is first found being held captive by slavers using him to construct a radio, except that it wasn't so much that he did the job unwillingly as that he'd been paid for it it, failed to get it right the first time and was held prisoner until he could finish it properly.

    -   Dr. Drago Pettrovich Madnar in _Metal Gear_, original inventor of the eponymous battletank (or at least a more compact version of the concept).
    -   Dr. Pettrovich again in _Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake_. He's faking it this time.

-   Occurs semi-regularly in _Command & Conquer: Tiberian Series_, most notable examples being Dr. Ignatio Moebius and Dr. Alphonse Giraud. Thing is, Nod scientists are treated _very_ well and have practically limitless resources, so it is not uncommon for kidnapped scientists to pull a Face–Heel Turn, which is implied to have happened with Dr. Giraud.
-   A coercion version occurs in _BlazBlue_. Litchi Faye-Ling, a talented scientist who used to work for the even more genius Kokonoe, has a certain breakthrough research. The bad guys, Hazama, wanted that, so they coerce her to joining 'on her own will' by dangling the cure for her actual target, her friend-turned-monster Lotte Carmine/Arakune, someone she felt that it was her duty (out of grief and guilt) to save. It's clear that she disliked the prospect of working with the bad guys with aims for world destruction, but she ended up having to do it, unless she wants danger to happen to Lotte if she just leaves him be without her supervision (they also had him in custody).
-   _Arcanum_:

-   In the crossover comic between _Flare_ and _Spying with Lana_, the two heroines work together to rescue a Belorussian scientist from the Corrupt Corporate Executive J. Reginald Butte.

    Web Original 

-   In _Twig_, Sylvester and Mary are forced to work without Lillian, their Academy supervisor in the prison-town of Warrick.

-   In an episode of _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_, the Mad Scientist Professor Nimnul was kidnapped by a mob boss so he could use Nimnul's shrinking ray to go on a crime spree. Ironic in that Nimnul was already evil, but he still hated not being given credit for the crime spree.
-   Terran Prof. Algernon from _Exo Squad_ was captured by the Neosapiens early in the war and constructed a number of fantastic weapons for them (most notably, the GRAF Shield) until his recapture by the Exofleet. Being somewhat of a Mad Scientist, however, he is rather indifferent towards his employees and cares more about lab equipment than about who uses his inventions and to what ends.
-   Actually used by the _good guys_ once in _Gargoyles_, when Goliath kidnaps Sevarius to find a cure for the mutants he'd created. Elisa calls him out on it and in the end Xanatos rescues Sevarius anyway. It's never made clear whether the serum Sevarius made was truly a cure or would have been a poison.
-   All the time in _Inspector Gadget_. It seemed like half of M.A.D.'s plans involved kidnapping scientists, although they just about never showed the unwilling ones actually working.
-   Subverted in _Invader Zim_ where there is an entire race of kidnapped scientists... whose inventions always seem to go horribly wrong for some inexplicable reason.
-   A common occurrence in _Kim Possible_, due to the fact that the titular spy _is_ the daughter of a rocket scientist (her father, James) and a brain surgeon (her mother, Ann):
    -   Played with in "Number One", Duff Killigan's first (and only, as a solo villain) episode. Killigan kidnaps a scientist who had developed a top-secret missile-defense system... a technology that is now obsolete and readily available on the Internet. The golf-obsessed villain was actually after the now-retired scientist's quick-grass-growing formula.
    -   Subverted in "Attack of the Killer Bebes", where Dr. Drakken's eponymous robots kidnap multiple scientists, among them Kim's father (though they actually got Ron impersonating him). It turns out Drakken's doesn't want their expertise (and, in a subversion of Omnidisciplinary Scientist, which are pointed out as irrelevant to the situation), he's seeking revenge on his old college friends after they mocked him over his scientific skills way back when.
    -   Dr. Wanda Wong in "The Truth Hurts". She is kidnapped by Dr. Drakken and Shego, demanding she reveal her scientific secrets to them, threatening to make her talk with a Truth Ray, but the Ray hits Kim and Ron instead while they rescue her. At the end of the episode, when Mr. Dr. Possible's bosses come over for dinner and Kim is unable to keep everything her father said about them to herself due to her having been hit by the Ray (one has a bad hairpiece, one is a crashing bore, and one is an annoying know-it-all) in spite of her attempts to avoid blurting it all out, Wong is revealed to be the board chairwoman of the space center, and clears up the whole issue when the other board members refused to believe Kim.
-   _The Simpsons_: When Mr. Burns tries to capture the Loch Ness Monster, he kidnaps Professor Frink for help.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: Plankton, tired of going to the trouble of stealing the Krabby Patty formula, once "kidnapped" SpongeBob (albeit in a completely legal way, since he tricked Mr. Krabs into betting SpongeBob's contract in a card game) to work at the Chum Bucket and make him one.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: "In the Name of the Rebellion, Part II" has Ezra, Sabine and Chopper rescue a group of technicians who were kidnapped by the Empire during a mission with Saw Gerrera. The technicians decide to join the Rebellion at the end, and it is heavily implied that they were kidnapped to work on the Death Star.
-   _Tangled: The Series_: In the two-part episode _Cassandra's Revenge_, Cassandra is after a scroll that contains an incantation that will allow her to control the mysterious black rocks. Said scroll is written in a long-forgotten language, with the only one capable of translating it being Varian. She abducts him and forces him via Truth Serum to translate the scroll, then uses him as bait to lure Rapunzel to her.
-   The TMNT cartoons have had this happen a few times. Most of the time, the abducted scientist is Baxter Stockman.
    -   A notable example happened in the 2012 episode "Mikey Gets Shellacne", where Dogpound and Fishface become desperate to be human again and kidnap Stockman to try and make him change them back.
-   This has happened at least once per series in the _The Transformers_ TV shows:
    -   _The Transformers_: There were several episodes in the G1 series where the Decepticons would capture or steal from human scientists to further their own goals.
    -   _Transformers: Animated_: An important plot point in Season 2 is that Professor Sumdac (both as revenge for reverse-engineering Megatron's head and because he's the most intelligent human in the show) is held prisoner by the Decepticons so he can help them construct their space bridge. When it's revealed that Bulkhead is _the_ expert on space bridges, the Decepticons kidnap him, too.
    -   Towards the very end of _Transformers: Prime_, Ratchet is kidnapped by Soundwave and taken aboard the _Nemesis_ due to his inventing synthetic Energon. Megatron manages to coerce him to help them create a stable formula (although Ratchet is trying to escape the entire time and manages to turn Preda-King against Megatron).
-   Serling Roquette from _Young Justice_ was kidnapped in order to produce a nano-robotic "fog" capable of stealing information and destroying the computers that held it. She's freed within the episode and later is instrumental in producing Cure-Tech.
