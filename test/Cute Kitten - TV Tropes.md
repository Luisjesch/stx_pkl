_"Side note: Kittens make everything better."_

...admit it, how long did you spend looking at the example picture before you started reading this article? Looking at the picture with automatic Bambi eyes setting in, with brain geared to "Such wee small biddy kitties? Whosa cute kitty? Sleepy kitty."

Kittens seem to provoke an automatic pleasure/protective/affection reaction in many (if not most) people. For this reason, they are often used by creators to arouse those feelings toward a character as well. Want to show that someone is a softy despite their crusty exterior? Have them rescue a kitten! Want to indicate that they're evil instead? Torturing or killing a kitten will do it. Want to lighten a mood that's gone Darker and Edgier? Add a kitten or two.

Kittens increase the cuteness factor exponentially. Examples on this page should be limited to works where this is deliberately used with kittens or cats, not simply "this work includes a kitten," or "this work includes a cute little animal."

Cat Girl can be a Sister Trope if you're creative enough. See also The Internet Is for Cats.

Compare Cool Cat, Fun Size, Mega Neko, Precious Puppy, Big Friendly Dog, Kindhearted Cat Lover, Cuteness Proximity, Bunnies for Cuteness, Panthera Awesome, Great White Feline, and High Koala-ty Cuteness. Contrast with Cats Are Mean, Hair-Raising Hare and Mister Muffykins. (Except when Cute Is Evil, in which case they go hand-in-hand.) In most cases, though, kittens are portrayed as more friendly and likable than adult cats, hence the contrasting tropes of Right-Hand Cat and If You're So Evil, Eat This Kitten!. In fact, when a dog is chasing an adult cat, the dog is usually portrayed as the hero but when a dog is chasing a kitten, the dog is often the villain.

-   This Nexus S 4G Advertisement. Featuring a cameo of Nyan Cat!
-   This Bouygues Telecom commercial with live kittens as office workers.
-   Every advert for cat-related products, such as cat litter (one UK advert involved a white kitten searching the house for the litter tray with a child-like voice over) and cat food. They also tend to appear on the packages of said products (especially for food that's specifically designed for kittens).
-   This advertisement for Sauza Tequila, in which a fireman (who has just rescued a kitten from a burning building) teaches you how to make a margarita. With the kitten's help.
-   Chessie, the mascot of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. She was introduced in 1933 to promote the railway's overnight trains, and soon took over C&O advertising. The railway added two kittens (Nip and Tuck) and a husband (Peake the tomcat). In 1972, when the C&O merged with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and the Western Maryland Railway, Chessie became the mascot for the entire Chessie System. You can still see her silhouette on boxcars.
-   This advert for Chocolate Digestive Biscuits.
-   This commercial for Pampers diapers may contain a lot of adorable animal babies, but the different feline cubs shown surely attract the most attention and adoration, and it's likely no accident it ends with a lion cub.
-   In _Dear Kitten_, a BuzzFeed viral ad campaign for _Little Friskies_ brand cat food, an older cat explains the facts of life to a new kitten, combining **Cute Kitten** with Cats Are Snarkers.
-   This commercial for the Swedish air-travel website Flygresor.Se, featuring a whole group of kittens wearing little airplane costumes. It got popular enough to warrant several "sequel" ads with the same concept.
-   The Progressive commercial "A Pet Too Far" has lots of cute little animals, but Mittens the kitten is the most popular one.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Osamu Tezuka
    -   _Atom Cat_: In a world where Astro Boy is just a cartoon show, a bullied Astro Boy-obsessed kid is forced to take his little tomcat away from home. When a group of aliens disguised as humans accidentally run over him and his pet cat, they try to cover it up by healing both the boy and cat up and erasing their memories of the event. However, because they have never seen a cat before, they unwittingly give the near-death tomcat all the powers of Astro Boy based from their readings of the injured boy's memories. With the ability to speak, lift heavy objects and fly, Astro Cat spends the rest of the series saving his sweetheart, Mink, or his owner from danger, both mundane and supernatural. Subverted by one of Astro Cat's enemies, Mephisto, a devil-like feline with supernatural powers who's lived since Egyptian times, who attempted to make Mink his bride.
    -   _Kimba the White Lion_. No points for guessing who the main character is. This even extends to his Love Interest and future wife Kitty/Laiya.
    -   _Yuusha Dan_, a young Ainu native, Kotan, who's a Friend to All Living Things befriends a white tiger after it escapes from a train carrying him to the zoo. Together they fight off villains while searching for a fantastic treasure.
    -   _Unico_: The 1981 movie and original manga has a cute kitten named Chao/Katy the Cat (renamed "Chloe" in _Unico: Awakening_). She's a black kitten that Unico first meets after accidentally falling into her basket. She reveals to Unico that she was abandonded by someone and dreams on becoming a "Cat Witch" due to reading a book about fairy tales. Chao/Katy later wishes to become a human after believing an old lady to be an actual witch (much to to confusion of Unico) which the titular unicorn temporarily grants the next morning. While Unico reveals to her that he granted he wish, Chao/Katy doesn't believe him until she suddenly turns back into a cat. After saving the old woman from drowning with Unico's help, she permanently becomes a human girl.
-   President Aria<small>◊</small> from _ARIA_.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
-   _Azumanga Daioh_:
    -   Kamineko and Mayaa, the latter of which is actually an Iriomote cat cub. Kamineko only plays it straight only when luring Sakaki in for the kill. Otherwise, he's an evil little bastard (or alternatively possibly just acting like a real feral cat and averting All Animals Are Domesticated... Or just hates Sakaki).
    -   Additionally, Chiyo in a cat costume in Sakaki's imagination. Awwwww!
    -   And if that weren't enough for you, Sakaki likes to fawn over Nekokoneko ("neko" meaning "cat", and "koneko" meaning "kitten"), a pair of white cats with Blank White Eyes (more accurately, a kitten resting on top of a cat's head). In fact, Sakaki fawns over _any_ cat. Even though they usually run away or get violent with her.
    -   Then there's also the very, very realistically-drawn newborn kitty that Yukari tries to hand off to the girls, and those in photos from Sakaki's _Cat Fancy_\-style magazine. It was the Art Shift that made them realistically _adorable_.
-   Would you believe this trope is used in _Battle Royale_? The island the students fight on seems to have a lot of kittens. Shuya and Noriko get a literal Cat Scare moment, a kitten is cruelly killed by a maddened student and there is a whole Flash Back sequence about one guy who took to his class a very young kitten. All those kittens are realistically drawn.
-   WHENEVER Sebastian from _Black Butler_ finds a cat (cue Ciel calling him a _neko-baka_, cat-obsessed idiot. Even if it's true when he sees one). Yes, cats are cute enough even to make demons gush over them.
-   Yoruichi from _Bleach_ has the ability to turn into a black cat, which for some reason makes her voice sound male. Rather amusingly though, one of Yoruichi's first appearances consists of Urahara perhaps succumbing to this trope, and tossing her up and down in the air in a playful manner, while saying something nonsensical.
    
    **Urahara:** Upsy daisy! Upsy daisy! _\[tossing Yoruichi up and down\]_
    
-   Keroberos and his "Evil Counterpart" Spinel Sun in _Cardcaptor Sakura_ are pretty darn cute in their power-conserving size. Kero's Big Eater tendencies and love of sweets, and what happens to Spinel when he eats sugar, only add to the delight.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_:
    -   Sphinx, the cute little kitty Index smuggled home. She was so taken by his cuteness she'd named him shortly after she saw him.
    -   Also, MISAKA. Aw, she's taking care of the kitty and oh shit Accelerator just ruptured all her veins by making her blood flow backwards.
-   Chi<small>◊</small> from<small>◊</small> _Chi's Sweet Home_ is a cute, friendly kitten.
-   _Chainsaw Man_: Power's cat Meowy (Nyako) is a cute, friendly furball that also acted as her Morality Pet. Back when Power was a wild Fiend wandering the woods, she found Meowy as an emaciated cat and took it in. Initially merely intending to fatten up Meowy and eat it, Power ended up bonding with the kitty and becoming true companions with it.
-   Umibozu of _City Hunter_ fame has a debilitating fear of cats, particularly if they're adorably cute kittens. This is mainly used for hilarity ensues purposes, but it also lead to a few serious scenes, such as, in one story, one of Umibozu's worst enemies knowing this weakness, and cornering him with it (but is ultimately saved by Ryo, who immediately after bursts into laughing at this scene).
-   The Student Council mascot Arthur in _Code Geass_. He enjoys biting Suzaku, his unofficial owner, but he's much nicer toward pretty much everyone else in the show. Word of God says that Arthur _does_ like Suzaku. His bites are supposed to be his way to show his affection, which is Truth in Television, as cats may bite or otherwise nibble on the object of their affection.
-   _Comic Girls_ has Kaoruko's cat Nyaos, which is adored by most of the cast (except Tsubasa), especially when she has that beret on her head.
-   Yune of _Croisée in a Foreign Labyrinth_ has a knack for finding cats wherever she goes, and she just can't... help... petting... them— _'scuse me, gotta chase a cat!_ Even the ending theme and mid-episode transition cards feature her with cats.
-   Gatomon/Tailmon from _Digimon Adventure_ and _Digimon Adventure 02_... which makes it even funnier when she kicks your ass.
-   He doesn't look much like one, but Doraemon is a robot cat. He had cat ears once upon a time, but they were chewed off by a mouse when he was sleeping. Poor guy is now terrified of them. His sister Dorami invokes this trope full force.
-   Bulma's father in _Dragon Ball_ has a gigantic soft spot for animals, and takes in stray cats, dogs, and dinosaurs (yes, dinosaurs) and lets them have free roam of Capsule Corporation. His favorite is a small, black, seemingly never-aging cat that spends almost all of its time perched on his shoulder. The cat is named Tama in the Japanese version and Scratch in the American dub. One of the very few times it moves off his shoulder is to rest in Android 16's hand and nuzzle into it in _Dragon Ball Z_. And that's not even getting into Yamcha's best friend Pu'ar, a sentient, floating shapeshifting cat; well, more of a cat-like thing, but still...
-   In _El-Hazard: The Magnificent World_, there's Ura the armor cat. Why does El-Hazard have an armored vest that happens to be a talking cat? Because he's _adorable_.
-   In _Fairy Tail_, Natsu has Happy, Wendy has Carla, and Gajeel has Pantherlily. Sabertooth's Dragon Slayers Sting and Rogue have Lector and Frosch, respectively.
-   _Fruits Basket_:
    -   Not only can Kyo turn into a cat when hugged by a girl, but he even attracts cats to him, like a pied piper of cute. He's just chilling in class, minding his own business, when BAM! a dozen cats are suddenly draped all over him.
    -   Kisa turns into an adorable tiger cub. When Tohru first meets Kisa in her tiger form, she mistakes Kisa for a cat while proclaiming how cute she is.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Cute kittens seem to be all over omakes. Al taking in a stray is probably part of the reason "Flame vs. Fullmetal" is a fan-favorite in _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_ (bear in mind, Al is an animated suit of armor).
    -   In another omake even Scar loves them, then things got weird...
-   In _GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class_, a misreading of the word for "sketching" inspires Kisaragi to draw cats in her croquis book and on a pasteboard where a cat who's "looking for a girlfriend" has been drawn; she later finds the same pasteboard with a bunch of kittens on it.
-   _Hanamaru Kindergarten_: Pa-pa-pa-pa Panda Neko! Hinagiku is also playing with a kitty in the eighth ending.
-   Tama & Shiranui of _Hayate the Combat Butler_ invoke this trope when they show up. Isumi even comments on Shiranui being a cute kitten, before he starts his evil plan.
-   _Inuyasha_ has Kirara the two tailed demon cat. In her 'rest' form, she is an adorable little kitten.
-   _Jewelpet_ has Garnet, Sango, Alex, Tour, Kaiya, Lapis, Diana and Dian. Being a Sanrio franchise, it's to be expected.
-   Neko's cat form in _K_, especially when she's with Shiro, sitting on his shoulder, and they blink in unison, or she waves her tail at the same time as his hand (_throughout_ the first episode).
-   Piro in _Kanon_. Despite being allergic to cats, Nayuki loves the little guy.
-   Komaneko the cat from the 2009 Japanese stop-motion series "Komaneko: The Curious Cat".
-   An episode of _K-On!_ has Azusa taking care of a little bitty kitten that actually belongs to Jun. Azusa is uncertain due to her inexperience, but relaxes for a bit after the kitten climbs into her lap and lies down there.
-   No wonder why _Lucky Star_ has a kitty mascot, who turns out to be Kagami Yoshimizu's Author Avatar. The character is sometimes referred to as Nyamo.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   Suzuka's house in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_ is filled with lots and lots of cute kitties, including one that got its wish to become a bigger kitty.
    -   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid_ later increases its usage of Rule of Cute by introducing Asteon, Einhart's Device which Hayate, Rein, and Agito made in the form of a snow leopard cub.
    -   _ViVid Strike!_: Being Einhart's apprentice, Fuka's device Huracan is also in the form of a kitten.
-   Episode 21 of _Maison Ikkoku_, in which Godai has to look after a cat called Kyoko.
-   _A Man and His Cat_: Fukumaru gets jealous when Kanda says that he saw cute kittens on the train to work. Then Kanda says that no cat is cuter than his.
-   Shamisen in _The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya_ series, owned by Kyon's family after participating in the movie the SOS Brigade made. Unusually, it's a male calico. A talking, philosophical male calico.
-   _My Bride is a Mermaid_ has an entire episode revolve around a kitten. Merfolk regard cats as their natural enemies, so when Nagasumi picks up a stray kitten, he finds out he can weaponize it and reduce hardened gangsters to gibbering wrecks. Everybody else at his school is just awed at the cuteness.
-   Mikoto Minagi from _My-HiME_ has two pet cats that follow her around. Mikoto from _My-Otome_, on the other hand, _is_ a cat. Well, one of the Mikotos is, anyway. The other one is a cat-themed god with the sleeping habits of a cat.
-   While not a kitten, Naruto gets help from an adorable cat named Ishi in completing the first step of the Rasengan.
-   Ridiculously Human Robot Chachamaru in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has an Animal Lover scene when she fed the kittens (she was supposed to be evil at the time). Yes, it was adorable. Then Chachamaru gets her artifact: a Kill Sat with a cute cat motif.
    -   Meanwhile, the Alternate Continuity series _Negima!?_ includes a kitty character in the form of Shichimi. While the cat may be annoying at times (although not as annoying as Motsu), Shichimi also has her share of cute moments (especially when said moments involve Nodoka in some way).
-   Even _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ is cuter with kittens, until the manga version of Kaworu murders them with his bare hands.
    -   The fourth _Rebuild of Evangelion_ movie contains a scene where Rei is fascinated by a mother cat with kittens in the Fourth Impact survivors' camp.
-   Sakamoto-san from _Nichijou_. As a Talking Animal (thanks to a scarf invented by the professor), he demands respect and hates being treated as cute, and becomes embarrassed when he finds himself giving into stereotypical endearing cat behavior.
-   In _Nyan Koi!_, the main character Junpei, has been cursed to understand cats which he has an allergy to. To cure the curse (which will turn him into a cat over time), he has to grant 100 wishes to the cats he meets. Meanwhile, he's surrounded by a growing harem who likes cats.
-   The main characters from the anime and manga series _Nyanpire: The Animation_.
-   _The Prince of Tennis_: Ryoma's adorable cat Karupin exists to show that he's not a complete Jerkass. Said cat had a _whole_ episode dedicated to him. It's a mix of funny and heartwarming from the start to the end.
-   A black cat named Amy in the opening of _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_. Other than a drama CD, she doesn't exist anywhere else. According to the PMMM wiki, Gen Urobuchi admits that he was not aware of any cat and that he was surprised when he saw it at the storyboard of the OP. Amy was never part of the original storyline as she was fabricated by SHAFT for the OP of the Anime to mislead viewers and fans with a Red Herring. However, SHAFT approached Urobuchi for the Drama CD and asked him to include the cat in it, so Urobuchi accepted and she was included in the drama CD. Amy is actually the reason why Madoka was a Magical Girl in the third timeline; her wish to Kyuubey was to save the kitty's life when she was seriously injured.
-   Shampoo from _Ranma ½_ is cursed to turn into a cute kitten with pale pink fur and violet socks and ears. One of the more adorable transformations, but unfortunately a trigger for Ranma's number one phobia.

-   In the twelfth episode of _Sgt. Frog_, Giroro takes a liking to a white kitten he finds in the rain (the Funimation dub gives her a name — Miss Furbottom). She goes on to become a recurring character.
-   _Sketchbook_. Sora would love to take one of the strays as her own.
-   Blair in _Soul Eater_. True to the series form, she actually kicks a lot of ass as a magical kitten!
-   The cat-like fairy mascot from _Suite Pretty Cure ♪_, Hummy.
-   All five of _Super Sonico_'s cats. There's even an episode that focuses on them!

-   This short anime made in 1947 called "Suteneko Tora-chan" (_Abandoned Cat Little Tora_) follows a family of anthropomorphic cats who adopts a homeless kitten.
-   Japanese electronics giant Sony owns a franchise called _Tama & Friends_, which features plenty of cute kitties. For example, an OVA based on the frachise features the title character walking up to his owner (with a close up of his face<small>◊</small>) and licking him - only to find out the human owner has transformed into a cat. This turns out to be All Just a Dream.
-   Ryo-Ohki from _Tenchi Muyo!_. Nyaa~. She's technically a cat, but close enough. She combines the cuteness of kittens with the cutness of bunnies, for a massive cuteness overload.
-   _Tokyo Mew Mew_: When the main heroine Ichigo Momomiya gets excited, the extreme result is turning into an adorable black kitten.
-   A "small black cat" appears, randomly and inexplicably, in each episode of _Trigun_. Her name is Kuroneko-sama and you _will_ refer to her as such! <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   An _Ushio and Tora_ OVA had an animated short called "Tora and the Kitten". It's just as adorable as it sounds.
-   _Vampire Game_ has Duzell, a deadly vampire king reincarnated a century after his defeat to wreak brutal vengeance on his foe. In the form of a kitten. Specifically, an orphaned baby fantasy wildcat adopted by a Rebellious Princess. It’s not exactly the most dignified revenge narrative.
-   _Windy Tales_ has massive amounts of cats. Everywhere. And they can _fly_.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_: Okay, Pharaoh was pretty amusing at times, but in all its seriousness _5Ds_ manages to top him.<small>◊</small>
-   Early in _YuYu Hakusho_, Kuwabara is being blackmailed by a random thug who is holding his kitten hostage. That's right - the character who looks most like a normal street thug is a kitten lover.
-   Nya from _Zatch Bell!_. Sadly, this is a filler Mamodo.

    Card Games 

    Comedy 

-   Averted by, of course, George Carlin:
    
    "You attack a baby, he cries. Attack a puppy, he cowers. Attack a kitten, he fights! _One day old_ and he's lookin' for some shit!"
    
    -   Anyone who has seen the milkbar fights at Tinykittens HQ or any of the other live cat rescue channels can attest to this, including with kittens _one hour old_.

    Comic Books 

-   Garfield: Nermal likes to boast that he's "the world's cutest kitten". To Garfield, nauseatingly so. Subverted in that some strips imply he is an adult that pretends to be cute.
-   _Hellboy_ agrees with this trope, underlining how he's an Anti Anti Christ.
-   Dex-Starr uses this to his advantage by being a) aggressively adorable and b) adorably aggressive. Then he blows your head off with his Red Lantern powers. His tragic backstory just makes him more desire-to-hug inducing.
-   The (not so) pious Helene (a story by Wilhelm Busch) has one. Though the trope gets subverted when her cat and<small>◊</small> another one (a tom)<small>◊</small> first kill Lene's canaries<small>◊</small> and then wreak havoc in the house.
-   In Astro City story "Pastoral", Cammie, however grudgingly, admits the farm has cute kittens. This proves a plot point later when she is wrestling with Curious Qualms of Conscience, goes off to play with them instead, and follows one to learn a crucial point.
-   The titular heroine of _Albedo: Erma Felna EDF_ is an anthropomorphic cat girl who was this in her younger days, the same goes with her baby son. Also, her younger brother, named Tasak, was also this when he was a kid.
-   Salem in the early (i.e. 1960's) _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ stories. He was small enough to fit in Sabrina's hands.
-   _The Snow Cat Prince_: Syv, the youngest of seven cat princes, who looks like this.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage)_: Lunk, a stray kitten Michaelangelo found and adopted one Christmas Eve, as shown in the _Michaelangelo #1_ one-shot from the late 80's.

    Eastern European Animation 

-   _A Kitten Named Woof_: Woof is a stray colourpoint kitten living in an attic of an old house. Very cute and quite naive.

    Fan Works 

-   The Adventures of James Vega and Sergeant Whiskers, a _Mass Effect_ story done as a takeoff of a forum meme postulating that Vega likely owns a cat.
-   Ann-Kathrin Kniggendorf is well-known in _Galaxy Rangers_ fandom for her Dark Fic. The main exception to this? A series of vignettes where Gooseman adopts a kitten. (See "Possessor" under "Story Cycles")
-   Sarah Girl 1998's fanfic, "Cat Mario," has Mario wearing the Cat Suit. Once he shows it to Lumpy and SpongeBob, they just about fall in love with its cuteness. Apparently trying to ignore their affection, Mario offers them some Super Bells, which give them Cat Suits of their own, to their joy. When Meowth arrives and sees the characters wearing their Cat Suits, however, he finds them more ridiculous than cute, leaving Mario to decide not to let Lumpy and SpongeBob wear the Cat Suits anymore.
-   One look at a cute kitty in the distance in _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_, and Italy rushed toward it at full-speed. Poor Japan nearly died as he was on Italy's back _while the latter was speeding_. The cuteness of Pookie helped make things better though.
-   _Game Theory_ has Vesta, an adorable eight-week-old kitten. Although after Nanoha makes her a Familiar, she's a Cat Girl or a Panthera Awesome much of the time.
-   _Mall Rats_ sees Lincoln and Leni Loud from _The Loud House_ renting a movie and wanting something cute so Lola would enjoy it. Frank picks out a movie with a cute little kitten called Archie.

-   _Forever And A Mile_ introduces the younger and more tame versions of spider-cats, known as spider-kittens. They reside in gaps in Precinct 13579's ball pit.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Disney Animated Canon_: Many.
-   In _Turning Red_, the ultimate test for Mei's control of her red panda transformation is _The Kitten Box_: five absurdly cute kittens crawling all over her, purring affectionately. The Cuteness Overload nearly does get to her.
-   _Lightyear_: Sox, Buzz Lightyear's Robot Buddy, has the shape of a cute little cat, to help provide better psychological help and well-being to Star Command space rangers once they go back from missions.
-   Kitten-like proportions and demeanor contribute a large part to the appeal of Toothless the Night Fury in _How to Train Your Dragon_.
-   Puss-in-Boots in _Shrek_, the cutest badass ever. He knows it and uses it to his advantage.
    -   In his spin-off film _Puss in Boots (2011)_, a flashback shows Puss when he was an actual kitten.
    -   A tie-in short film features Puss running into the Diablos, three adorable kitten siblings who are assassins for hire.
-   The Cat from _The Bad Guys (2022)_. Once he warms up to Mr. Wolf, he fully qualifies as this in his interactions with the Bad Guys, whether it's nibbling his fingers or rubbing against him.
-   Jiji from _Kiki's Delivery Service_ is so sweet he can cause a sugar high! In the English dub, he's voiced by Phil Hartman, so you get cute _and_ snarkiness.
-   _My Neighbor Totoro_ got a short film sequel, _Mei and the Kittenbus_, that plays exclusively in the Studio Ghibli museum. And if anything on earth is cuter than a Catbus, it's a Kittenbus - cuddly-looking just like the bigger Catbus, but smaller.

-   _The Secret of Kells_ has Pangur Ban, the white cat of Brother Aidan of Iona.
-   _Home (2015)_ has Pig — a small, chubby cat who's put through some slapstick.
-   _Lucky and Zorba_ has Yoyo, an adorable ginger kitten.
-   _The Cat Returns_ exists solely because of this trope. It's about a girl who's taken to the magical world of cute, talking kitties and then herself begins to transform into a cute, talking kitty.
-   _Cat Soup_ uses kittens as the "cute" half of Grotesque Cute.
-   Edmund from _Rock-A-Doodle_ gets turned into a cat by the evil owl because he finds kittens "more digestable."
    
    "Jeepers, I'm all furry!"
    
-   _Kung Fu Panda_:
    -   You really can't blame the Misaimed Fandom for thinking Tai Lung from the first film is awesome — after all, he's incredibly badass and cool and oddly sympathetic — but the real clincher comes when we see Shifu's flashbacks to raising him from a kitten. A rambunctious, big-eyed, fluffy-tailed, eager-to-please, kung-fu-lovin' kitten. The creators themselves admitted that they may have gone a bit too far in trying to avoid a one-note villain.
    -   The same applies for Defrosting Ice Queen Tigress. While some found her behavior in the first movie grating, seeing her as a sad young kitten trying to earn the approval of a man incapable of giving it did astounding things for her popularity.
    -   Goes even further in the spin-offs, in the Orphanage, the directors and other kids were terrified of her because she was so strong despite all she wanted to do was play and have friends. And it got to the point where every time she asked an innocent question like "Why is the sky blue?" or "Why is soup hot?", the directors would openly ridicule her for "being stupid", alienating herself further from others.
-   In _Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs_, Flint uses LOLCats to distract Sam. It is amazingly effective.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Salesman_: A cute kitten is a resident at the apartment complex, providing random moments of cuteness. This may be because the mood of the rest of the film is rather bleak.
-   In the French comedy _The Closet_ the hero's quasi-mentor figure owns an adorable kitten. In fact, it was because the main character found the kitten on the terrace of his apartment that he ended up meeting his gay neighbor who helps him.

-   _The Adventures of Milo and Otis_ has this in spades, doubled with Precious Puppies.
-   In universe example: Leo Spitz of _Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen_ started off his conspiracy website by selling kitten calendars. Later, Sam uses them as his Madness Mantra.
-   Horribly, horribly subverted in _The Brothers Grimm_. The most infamous part in the movie is when a small, adorable white kitten is walking along the floor during an absurd scene where a woman is being threatened with a large, spinning blade. When the torturer sees the animal, he gets startled and (read at your own risk) kicks it in the air, where we see it hit the blade and get chopped up into pieces as its flesh flies everywhere.
    -   Crosses the Line Twice: the evil General then takes the kitten's eye that's been splattered to his coat, and eats it like a rare delicacy — a Take That! at French food?
    -   Similar horrible, horrible subversion in _Pet Sematary Two_: at one point the evil, reanimated dog is shown in a kennel at a vet's office, growling at another kennel with three adorable tabby kittens in it. The kittens hiss back. Cut to the next morning, where we see an excited little girl being led into the room by her mom who tells her that she can pick whichever kitten she wants, only to scream in horror at the sight of the dog's busted-open kennel and the kittens' busted-open kennel _caked with blood and gray fur_.
-   _Hellboy_'s film counterpart likes kittens even more than his comicbook version, keeping entire litters of kittens in his room. In the first film's moment of awesome, he whups a baddie while _simultaneously_ rescuing a basket of itty-bitty kitties.
-   Invoked in the DVD commentary of _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ where Daniel Handler, assuming his Lemony Snicket persona, spends most of the movie trying to convince viewers to watch something else:
    
    You know what I really like? A basket of kittens. I think everyone watching this film should just go out and buy, or otherwise procure, a basket of kittens.
    
-   Several kittens appear in _Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers_. Strangely enough, Michael, who is known to kill dogs, completely ignores the kittens.
-   Jonesy in _Alien_. Not even the xenomorph can resist thinking the cat is cute.
-   _The Spirit_ establishes that the main character likes cats, and The Octopus the villain pretends like cats and introduces us to a cute kitten, Muffin, "his favorite" who he then proceeds to... melt to death.
-   In _Licence to Kill_, the Hemingway House where James Bond meets up with M has some kittens wandering about (used for a Mythology Gag — the mysterious figure stroking one of them turns out to be Bond's boss, not a Blofeld-like character with a Right-Hand Cat).
-   When Bruce Lee fights Chuck Norris in the climactic battle in the Colosseum in _Way of the Dragon_, they are surrounded by adorable baby kittens.
-   _Keanu_, the feline star of the film of the same name, who is so adorable that a _gang war_ is fought over him. Just look at the film's page image!
-   Thunder the cat from the 2013 French-Belgian film _Thunder and the House of Magic_.
-   _Cats & Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore_ uses this to thoroughly stomp out the last remnants of the first film's Always Chaotic Evil stance on cats that Catherine (the heroic cat agent) haven't already removed — the kittens (Catherine's nieces) are cute and _very_ friendly, being only excited and happy to hang around and play with a dog.
-   _Upside-Down Magic_: Most of Nory's animal hybrid forms have some part of a kitten, such as the body of a kitten with dragon wings (a Dritten), the head of a kitten on a badger's body and the feet of a kangaroo, and the head of a panda on the body of a penguin with kitten ears.
-   _The Winter Guest_ has two roughcut adolescent boys who smoke, swear and talk crudely about sex, adult life and whether Growing Up Sucks. You know their hearts are good when they immediately take up the abandoned kittens they find and plan to adopt them, thus introducing themselves to mature responsibility. And cuteness.
-   _A Kitten For Hitler_ is a short created by Ken Russell where a little Jewish boy travel to Germany to give Hitler one of these for Christmas hoping it will give him a change of heart. It almost works, until he notices the boy's Swastika shaped birthmark and Star of David necklace. Can you tell that the film was intentionally made to shock and appall?
-   _The Electrical Life of Louis Wain_: Invoked. Louis and Emily adopt an adorable kitten, and Louis's art based on said cat become incredibly popular. Though the notion of cats as pets had already existed, it became more popular after his art became widespread. In part thanks to Louis, people now see cats as cute housepets rather than as vermin-catchers.
-   French movie titled _A Cat's Life_ (original title: _Mon chat et moi, la grande aventure de Rroû_) is about a kitten's adventures in the wild and his owner, a little girl named Clémence. Adapted from a novel named _Rroû_.

    Literature 

-   _Cats vs. Robots_ has Stu and Scout, a pair of kitten siblings that Max brings home after saving them from the river in "This Is War". Obi recruits them to retrieve the Singularity Chip for him.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   You (yes, that's her name), in the novel _Wintersmith_, even softens Granny Weatherwax. Slightly. Deny it though she may. Nanny Ogg's angelically challenged tomcat Greebo (he's a big softy, really), on the other hand, found an encounter with her somewhat disquieting, to say the least.
    -   Greebo himself was apparently once a fluffy kitten. Now, he's an absolute menace feared across the Disc, and with good reason - he's known to have killed two vampires (he _ate_ one) and at least one elf, and terrorises every normal animal in sight. He's seen cornering a full-grown bull and trying to play with it like a mouse, causes bears to climb trees in his presence, and brings in dead wolves the same way other cats bring in mice. The only things that consistently scare him are the Nac Mac Feegle, Legba (Mrs Gogol's decidedly uncanny cockerel), and You.
    -   Death, who is normally dispassionate (though kind, in a detached sort of way), has a soft spot for cats and gets really upset when he has to collect a bunch of kittens at once because someone drowned a sack of them in a rain barrel.
        -   In _The Last Hero_, he also had a few things to say about Schrödinger's famous thought experiment.
        -   In _Reaper Man_ he is buying chocolates as part of a venture into human courtship, and finds one box decorated with pictures of cute kittens. He asks in menacing tones, "Are they cat-flavoured?"
        -   And then there's this exchange from _Thief of Time_, on a diorama of stuffed kittens.
            
            **Susan:** I wonder what happened when the man who did this met my grandfather.  
            **Lobsang:** Would he have met your grandfather?  
            **Susan:** Oh, yes. And my grandfather is rather fond of cats.
            
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   One of the ways it's made clear that Tommen Baratheon isn't bad is that Tommen is given a trio of kittens, of whom he becomes very fond. This is in contrast to his older brother Joffrey, who was once told that a cat was pregnant with kittens, so he cut them out of her with a knife. And if you think that this series could never be cute, just listen to the names Tommen picks: Ser Pounce, Lady Whiskers and Boots. After four books full of endless grim tidings, betrayals and suffering, this is exactly what the audience needs.
    -   It is mentioned that Princess Rhaenys also had a black kitten which she named Balerion after the ginormous historical dragon of that name, who was incidentally also called "the Black Dread". After her death, it is implied that little Bale grew up fending for itself to become a true Fire-and-Blood Targaryen; it is the toughest, meanest old cat currently in the Red Keep, and one well able to give Arya Stark the complete run-around in the maze of secret passageways. Martin has even basically confirmed this
-   In _The Belgariad_ and _The Malloreon_ series by David Eddings, Kal Zakath, the "evil" emperor of Mallorea, is foreshadowed as turning out to be a decent guy at heart by his affection for his striped tabby cat and her kittens. A Running Gag soon develops where 'Zakath is constantly trying to give the kittens away to people, as his cat keeps having so many of them.
-   _Warrior Cats_. They manage to even make _Tigerstar and Scourge_ look adorable when they're written/drawn as kittens. And of course, fan artists will always fall back on this trope when it comes to drawing chibis.
-   In the _The Cat Who..._ series of books by Lillian Jackson Brown. There is a cast of several Kitties, but the main stars are the Psychic cat Koko, and his partner Yum Yum.
-   In T.S. Elliot's "Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats" and the musical based off of it called _Cats_, there's a couple dozen, and a subversion: Grizabella, the Glamour Cat, is now quite old and ugly.
-   In _Kafka on the Shore_, Johnnie Walker murders cats and saws off their heads, cutting out their "cute little hearts" and EATING them.
-   Subverted by Umbridge in _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_. Just because she likes (moving!) pics of kittens and decorates her office with them, this doesn't mean she's one of the good ones.
-   _Garrett, P.I._: In _Whispering Nickel Idols_, Garrett acquires a bucketful of kittens whose very presence seems to radiate feelings of happiness, contentment, and party-time good cheer. It turns out that they're disguised lesser avatars of a goddess of merriment and the night.

-   H. P. Lovecraft was a Kind Hearted Cat Lover. He only owned one cat in his lifetime, but fed and named every alley-cat he found. His Dreamland story "The Cats of Ulthar" explains the chilling reason why "In Ulthar, according to an ancient and significant law, no man may kill a cat". The Ulthar cats return in his longest work, _The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath_, where they respect and aid the hero because he loves little black kittens. HPL also wrote an essay on why cats are better than dogs. (Just don't ask what his cat's name is...)
-   In _The Witch of Blackbird Pond_, Hannah's cure for sad children is blueberry cake and a kitten. It never fails.
-   There is an entire subgenre of mystery books called the Cozy Mystery in which the protagonists very often have a pet cat, who may even help in solving the murder.
-   German philosopher Oswald Spengler wrote in _The Decline of the West_ this: "A peacock is indubitably speaking when he spreads his tail, but a kitten playing with a cotton-reel also speaks to us, unconsciously, through the quaint charm of its movements." Even cultural pessimists think everything's cuter with kittens!
-   _Letters Back to Ancient China_ has the narrator/protagonist often talking about his Shiao-shiao and how misses her.
-   _Rainbow Magic_:
    -   Kirsty has a kitten named Pearl, whom she adopted during the second series and named after Pearl the Cloud Fairy.

-   Yoko the cat<small>◊</small> from Rosemary Wells's "Yoko" series from the late 90's. She's a sweet-natured and kindhearted anthropomorphic Japanese kitten who loves sushi and is very friendly with others. She is also one of the main characters in _Timothy Goes to School_. Another character that shows up in the Yoko series is a Spanish kitten named Juanita.
-   _The Tale of Tom Kitten_ and _The Tale of Samuel Whiskers_ by Beatrix Potter all have cute kittens.
-   The fire kittens from _The Bad Unicorn Trilogy_, especially Moki. Subverted with Loki, who, despite being a fire kitten as well, is pretty evil.

She explores happily in the city, while Karen waits and prays. Months pass, until early winter brings Muffin back to Karen's farm — along with her own kittens.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Findus the cat from Swedish children's book series _Pettson and Findus_ (_Pettson och Findus_ in Swedish) is a friendly brown and white kitten who's able to talk to his owner Findus. He later gains green clothing and a green hat and is frequently seen walking on two legs and sometimes on all fours.
-   _Stick Dog_: In "Stick Dog Chases A Pizza", Stripes becomes distracted by the sight of a pair of paws inside the passenger seat of a delivery truck, which compels her to save the creature inside. Then they see that the paws belong to a kitten, which Stripes immediately becomes enamoured with. She decides she wants to make the kitten a part of their group, and wants to take it out of the truck. Then it's revealed that the kitten was actually adopted by a truck driver, and was excited to see him coming back. Stripes is disappointed to have to say goodbye.
-   Polish book series Kicia Kocia (Kitty Kotty) is all about missadventures of a white cute antropomorphic kitten.
-   _The Saga of Tuck_: Tuck was pretty much the only one in his family not to be smitten by Cheddar Underfoot, mainly because cats are yet one more thing the he's allergic to. Unfortunately for him, given just was being done to the kitten when Brian saved its life in the first place, there wasn't any way that the cat was going to go.
-   _Whateley Universe_: in the Timeless stories, James has a pet kitten even though you're not supposed to bring pets to Superhero School Whateley Academy. It's so cute that even Eldritch Abomination Carmilla finds it adorable.
    
    **Carmilla**: "No hurting the cute kitty!"
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   Comedians Hale & Pace can't resist playing with this trope. Enter Hale with some really, REALLY cute kitten on his shoulder. Cue to Pace revealing a big microwave...How will THAT end? After much talk and zig-zagging, they finally open the microwave to reveal an already microwaved cat. Plastic, of course. (Note: This gave them instant infamy to the point that even the Other Wiki mentions the sketch.)
-   German TV station hr3 used to play segments of this video during programme breaks. Probably the only case in history where you were annoyed at the break ending.
-   Mimsie, the adorable kitten in the MTM Enterprises Vanity Plate. And if the Tommy Westphall Snow Globe didn't piss off the audience in the final episode of _St. Elsewhere_, the end credits certainly did. Ironically, the poor kitty really did pass away the same year.
-   Even Keith Olbermann is not immune. The "sanity break" at the middle of his show often had one or more adorable kitten videos. Keith would occasionally interrupt himself to squee "Ooo, a kitty!" Unfortunately, he's allergic to cats. (He does have two adorable Maltese dogs, though. They're hypoallergenic.) To this day, he features adoptable kitties and puppies on his Twitter feed.
-   In _The Big Bang Theory_, the normally aloof Sheldon Cooper turns to the comfort of cats when distressed. And of course his lullaby in times of extreme distress, for which he usually conscripts any nearby female friend to play the role of Momma/Mee-Maw:
    
    _Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur;_  
    _Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr...._
    

This song, whose real title is "Warm Kitty<small>◊</small>," was written by schoolteacher Edith Newlin in 1937. It was published by Willis, a company that produced song books for children. It also appears in the 1940s edition of _Childcraft_. The producers of _Big Bang Theory_ had permission from Willis to use the song, but not from Newlin's heirs, who filed a lawsuit.

-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_: In "Terry's Kitties", we find out that Terry's old bullies back at the Six-Five send him a kitten every year to remind him of his screwup twenty years ago. (It Makes Sense in Context, but the short version is: Terry thought he'd cracked his first case, when it turned out he was wrong, he accused a cat of being an accomplice in desperation.) Terry understandably doesn't find it cute, and keeps insulting the kittens, but Jake adores them.
    
    **Jake:** _(whispering to the kittens)_ Don't listen to him. You're a part of something much bigger than yourselves. _(blows kisses)_
    
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Willow and Tara decide to get themselves a kitten. Not as a familiar, but just so they can make it do cute things like playing with string.
        
        **Willow:** I keep thinking, okay, that's the cutest thing ever, and then she does something cuter and completely resets the whole scale.
        
    -   Miss Kitty, incidentally, disappears after only a few appearances. We're never told exactly what happened to her; all we know is that a crossbow was somehow involved.
    -   Spike takes Buffy out for a night of gambling with his demon buddies. In a Visual Pun the 'kitty' is filled with actual kittens ("They're delicious!") being used for currency. Eventually Buffy gets annoyed and upends the kitty, letting them escape.
-   _The Chaser's War On Everything: The Hamster Wheel_'s "Australian Politics, as told through YouTube videos of cats" segments play on this.
-   _The Closer_ provides a possibly deliberate example in introducing Joel, Brenda's new kitten, given that the case the episode revolves around is particularly draining emotionally.
-   _The Colbert Report_:
    -   On March 5, 2009, Stephen Colbert discussed the imploding U.S. economy with CNBC analyst Jim Cramer while videos of kittens and puppies played in the background. Well, I sure feel better about the economy!
    -   Also Black Comedy in the form of Colbert challenging a guest to debate him on the subject of throwing kittens in a wood chipper.
    -   In the 21-February-2012 episode, he challenged a fake anti-Colbert TV ad's claim that he doesn't like kittens by holding a kitten in each hand. "I love these two little kittens," he said, "And I will continue to do so until the moment they become cats."
-   One infamous moment on _Countdown_ had Jimmy Carr trying to distract the panel (from, appropriately enough, _8 Out of 10 Cats_) with two baskets of kittens. This failed miserably... because the kittens promptly made a break for it, leaving him in the unenviable role of trying to keep them in line.
-   _The Daily Show_:
    -   The healthcare debate had the great toss-up between healthcare and a video of kittens playing in an empty tissue box.
        
        **Jon Stewart**: Healthcare is today's hot-button issue, but... how did the kitten get in the box?
        
    -   Stewart tried using pictures of cute kittens as a form of Brain Bleach on the segment about cover-ups of child molestation in the Catholic Church. They didn't take.

-   _Doctor Who_: Not even the Doctor is immune to the power of kittens, as "Gridlock" shows.
-   _House_: Death Cat. How can something so cute be an omen of your doom? Based on a True Story of a cat in a nursing home that predicted the deaths of residents. See article about Oscar.
-   Extremely subverted in _Hyperspace_, where anyone who is sentenced to their equivalent of rehab gets put in a room where all they see is kittens, and a voice saying stuff like, "Look at the kitten. The kitten obeys authority. The kitten is happy. Be like the happy kitten. Obey authority and be like the kitten." Everyone who goes in comes out brainwashed, although it does appear to wear off, otherwise the entire show would be full of people wandering around singing silently.
-   Invoked in _Jane the Virgin_, where the narrator shows the audience footage of cute cats when confronted with heavy subject material on a few occasions.
-   This is the point of the _Kitten Bowl_, Hallmark Channel's equivalent of the _Puppy Bowl_. It's cute kittens playing around in an American football stadium play-area. There is also the spinoff _Meow Madness_, which is essentially the same thing but with basketball.
-   _Late Night:_ In the episode before the 2018 Midterm elections, Amber Ruffin performed a song in her signature cheerful style with an adorable kitten named Liberty, telling the audience to vote or else the cat will meet a grisly demise.
-   _The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson_ always ends with the feature "What did we learn on the show tonight, Craig?", which is introduced with an animated kitten.
-   In the Discovery Channel documentary _Mega Predators_, a kitten is shown when the narrator is introducing the felid relative _Barbourofelis_, interacting and jumping up on a skull of it. It doesn't really serve a purpose beyonf Rule of Cute.
-   In the "Charlie" episode of _The Mighty Boosh_, Naboo advises Howard to look at a picture of kittens in a barrel to soothe himself whenever he feels himself getting too angry. The kittens in a barrel reappear during the end credits of the episode, apparently entirely for the viewer's benefit.
-   In _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ season three, P.C. — short for Park Cat — who was actually Kat under Rita's spell to spy on the Rangers.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_: Crow had a tendency to exclaim "Kitties!" with delight whenever a kitten showed up in a movie...or any kind of cat...or, well, pretty much any animal at all, especially if it happened to be deadly.
-   _Operation Kitten Calendar_ on VH1 was an extreme example of this trope. It's basically a spot-on parody of _The Apprentice_ except people are competing to make the best kitten calendar, not work for Donald Trump.
-   _Odd Squad_:
    -   "Not OK Computer" has the "virus cat" that Olympia unintentionally infects her computer with, which manifests as a cat meowing rhythmically and dancing, and rapidly multiplying. Olympia originally opened it because she thought it was a file photo of a kitten sneezing.
    -   In "Odd Squad in the Shadows", while the Van Computer drives the Mobile Unit van to Mr. Sides' restaurant, Opal, Orla and Oswald spend time looking through the many pictures of kittens in the workbooks that the latter has made and printed, and react accordingly.
-   _Animal Planet_ uses footage of kittens at play as the "half-time show" for its annual _Puppy Bowl_.

-   In an episode of _Scrubs_, after the guest star psychiatrist told JD about "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy" (broken heart syndrome), where the heart muscle weakens due to emotional stress, JD wonders how he's supposed to treat emotions. Cue an Imagine Spot where he dumps a box of kittens over a patient having a heart attack ("Get me a box of kittens! Stat!") and then lists the possible side-effects of kittens. Namely, allergies, tiny scratches, and erectile dysfunction. Just to make you go "Awwww!", here's a link.
-   Data's cat, Spot, in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. Possible subversion swinging back towards a straight play when Barclay's Protomorphosis Syndrome causes her to de-evolve into an iguana and then have a litter of perfectly normal kittens.
-   _The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien_ puts puppies and this trope together and gives us Puppies Dressed As Cats! (Note: link is from Hulu and may not work in all regions. Sorry.)
-   There's a show on Animal Planet called _Too Cute! Kittens_ that looks at litters of various cat breeds from birth to a few months old.
-   An episode of _Top Gear (UK)_ has Jeremy discussing the finer points of twin turbocharged engines, but before he launches into his explanation, he remarks that some people in the audience tend to find such explanations boring, "so here's some soft little kittens for you to look at." The screen splits halfway between Clarkson and a mound of cuddly little kittens.
-   _VR Troopers_ had one episode where Ryan Steel and J.B Reese rescue a kitten from a tree. A very cute kitten.
-   Earlier on in their run, _X-Play_ sometimes censored scenes of horribly gory, mangling violence with poorly cropped photos of kittens. In one instance when the censored violence escalated even further, said kitten's eyes bulged out with a startled yowl.

    Music 

-   In the song _Wretch_ by the Canadian band Protest The Hero, there is meowing at 3:31.

-   "Black Cat" by Gentle Giant has the band making various cat meows with guitars and violins.
    -   On that same note, Queen did a song called "Delilah", which Freddie Mercury wrote about his favourite cat. It includes a guitar solo filtered to sound like mewing.

-   The song "Kittens for Sale" by TV's Kyle goes on at length about the cuteness of kittens.
-   Mew is a name of a band.

Also created a female cat character named "Pussycat Tiger" in 2009. The character starred in her own music video where she has a crush on a male cat. The music video itself is cute, very sparkly, and oddly suggestive when you read the lyrics. Another feline character made by Jamster is a tiger named "Tiger Boo" a cute tiger cub.
-   On October 8th, 2020 Sanrio and Sega Toys teamed up to create new Sanrio characters called "The Beatcats". A 5-piece Virtual Idol Unit starring adorable cats that perform J-Pop created by them.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Swords and Scorcery Creature Collection - Moon cats. Magical kitties that appear after moonrise. Those who encounter them get good luck afterwards. Although sought by mages believing them to hold access to powerful magical energy, there are no known instances of them being captured. The rare times a moon cat has been caught, it vanished by sunrise.
-   In _Warhammer 40,000_, The World Eaters, despite being blood knights in the service of Khorne, are quite fond of khittens.
    -   It's something of a Running Gag among the fandom that the World Eaters are less psychotic in their downtime. And that Kharn is a hell of a guy.
    -   A fanwiki for it, Lexicanum, has an entry for cats in the fourth-first millenium. An example is an Astropath's pet cat, who is described as being killed along with the entire planet's population after the planet it lived on was hit by Exterminatus.
    -   There are also Gyrinx - cat-like creatures used by some Eldar and human psykers as Familiars, enhancing their psionic abilities. These kitties have a strong telepathic link with their owners and are very loyal to them, which is unusual for cats.

    Video Games 

-   _7th Dragon III: Code VFD_ has you get involved making a cat cafe at one point, the completion of which requires you to go into the Tokyo Underground and rescue some cats. Offering cat food to the cafe lets you rest there, restoring all parties' LF and MN and giving everyone some SP. For the rest of the game, you can occasionally find stray cats to recruit for the cafe.
-   _Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia_: There are cats hiding in some areas. Upon picking a cat up, it will go back to the village. Normally you can't do anything with them (aside from hitting them to make them freak out), but if you have a particular glyph, you can transform into a Cat Girl and talk to them to get some hints. Also, the cats are all named after various ingredients (like Soybean, Flour and Tofu), which makes them all the more cuter. Holding the stylus on the screen while one of the cats is present will cause a toy mouse to appear, allowing you to tease the cats with it and make them jump after it.
-   _cat planet_ of course!
-   _Cat Quest_: As one could expect, almost its _entire cast_ consists in Cute Kittens.
-   _Chrono Trigger_:
    -   The main character has a cat, and he can win more kitties at the fair (as well as a supply of food!). Later on, we learn Magus used to have a cat named Alfador... and if you have Magus in your active party and go where the cat is, he'll follow his owner around the area!
    -   When you fight Ozzie as part of Magus' sidequest, you hit a switch and fall down a pit. After heading back, everyone prepares for battle, then stops and they all watch as a cat randomly wanders in and presses the switch that kills Ozzie, then leaves.
-   _Cookie Clicker_: Kitten Helpers, Workers, Engineers, and Overseers are all upgrades you can purchase. Their effectiveness increases as you accumulate more milk<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Notable for being among the few things you can do that doesn't make the world a significantly worse place.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   Subverted in _Dragon Age: Origins_ "The Stone Prisoner" DLC. Kitties aren't nearly as cute when possessed by demons.
    -   Played straight in _Awakening_. You can give Anders a cute little kitten that he will immediately gush over, naming it "Ser Pounce-a-lot". Anders' love of cats has a tragically hilarious backstory: the only fond memories he had of his time in the Circle Tower were the times he played with a cat that lived in the Tower named Mr. Wiggums. Sadly, Mr. Wiggums somehow became possessed by a Rage Demon and had to be put down — but not before Mr. Wiggums _killed three Templars by himself_. Also, sadly Anders had to give up Ser Pounce-A-Lot after he nearly gotten him killed during an expedition to the Deep Roads (though he still has a deep love for cats).
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_ Leliana and Sten have a conversation about Leliana catching the 'fierce Qunari warrior' playing with a kitten. Sten of course justifies it as 'training'. (As in, giving 'warrior training' _to the cat_. No one believes it for an instant.)
-   _Dragon Quest V_:
    -   Talk to a cat while Madchen is in the party, and Party Chat with her afterward. Nine times out of ten, she'll be delighted.
    -   Saber looked an absolutely adorable golden-and-red furball as a cub. People are shocked that Sabrecats can even be tamed.
-   _Dwarf Fortress_: Dwarves are susceptible to this trope, often adopting the fort's ludicrous supply of cats. This can be very bad for your framerate. The main developer, Toady One, has his own feline companion, Scamps, and the update log often includes lines such as "Scamps fell asleep on my shoulder like a very tired parrot today." Awwwwwwww...
-   _Eiyuden Chronicle Hundred Heroes_: The Kickstarter campaign has used the abundance of cats as a marketing point, and a golden one is available as backer-exclusive DLC. There was also a reward for premium backers to have their own cats appear in the game, but that sold out within just the first hour or so.
-   _Epic Battle Fantasy_: Cats are a frequent appearance, owing to its creator, Matt Roszak, being a big fan of them:
    -   A limbless cat named NoLegs appears in every installment — first appearing as _Brawl Royale's_ first opponent, then appearing atop _Epic Battle Fantasy 1's_ first boss, King Slime. All subsequent installments have him as an ally, with him being a playable character in _Bullet Heaven_, _Bullet Heaven 2_ and _Epic Battle Fantasy 5_.
    -   Similar limbless cats appear as an enemy type starting from _Epic Battle Fantasy 2_.
    -   NCHProductions' mascot, a pale yellow cat named Meow Meow, also cameos in the series — first appearing as one of Natalie's Summons in EBF2, as a sidequest-giving NPC and a skill in EBF3, and as the Meow Meow Badge in EBF5.
-   _The Evil Within_: "Save Cat" in the DLC mission _The Assignment_. When you save the game, a black cat with a red ribbon round its neck appears for Kidman to stroke.
-   _Exoptable Money_: The player can buy a cat that he is she can send out to collect money, with visible hearts pouring out of the kitten each time it comes back. Don't get too attached to it, as Madame Sinclair takes notice and skins it so you can make more money off its fur.
-   _Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon_ relies heavily on this. Not only can you feed and play with stray cats, but there are three mandatory quests that involve Seto following or befriending a cat. Part of Ren's motif is her strong friendship with the cats. Cats are arguably the one thing in the game that is _happy_, put there to cheer the player up.
-   The _FreeSpace 2_ Game Mod _Blue Planet_ has a bit where the "Meditation Widget" in Noemi's computer displays an adorable animated kitten picture, after the mission where the GTVA attacks Earth.
-   _Genshin Impact_: Diona is a playable Catfolk who is of the small girl model, and thus comes across as a kitten and has the Tsundere attitude one expects from a cat. She works at Mondstadt's Cat's Tail Tavern, where patrons come to drink while in a bar full of cats; said patrons usually start off thinking Diona is just wearing something to fit the gimmick, but are surprised to find out she is indeed catfolk.
-   _Ghost Trick_: Sissel turns out to have been a stray kitten during the fateful day ten years before the game's present in Temsik Park. During the prime timeline, he grew up to be a Cool Cat as the Big Bad's quite literal Morality Pet, with Yomiel even naming him after his fiancee who killed herself to be Together in Death with him. And during the altered timeline created during the game's climax, he stayed a kitten as the Temsik Meteorite fragment was now lodged in his body instead of Yomiel's body.
-   _Guild Wars 2_: A number of heart areas have kittens about, notably at the Snow Leopard shrine in the norn starting area. You can progress these areas by killing enemies, helping the priests... or playing with the kittens.
-   _Hidden City_ has Snowy, a fluffy orange cat with big eyes who somehow wanders into the City, prompting his human family to come looking for him. The game certainly milks his cute charms by featuring him as a bonus avatar in various events, and in the 2021 Halloween event, he is featured in a mini-game which the player can play every 12 hours in exchange for artifact assemblers and other rewards. The Detective describes him as "the City's favourite cat".
-   _Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius_ has Mike and Ran, flying cats that shoot balls of yarn. Mike's "force field" power is hiding under various furniture, and Ran's shield is a paper bag.
-   _League of Legends_: The 144th champion is Yuumi the Magical Cat, who is exactly what her title describes her as. While she speaks and has an arsenal of supporting magic as she rides around on a flying Spell Book, she otherwise possesses every cute cat stereotype in the books, making her one of the most utterly adorable members of the cast.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_:
        -   There are quite a few cats in the game, who always come up and greet Link (be he human or wolf) with a 'Mew!'. You can even cuddle them! In the Hidden Village you can even play a game where you have go talk to them all, and one of the responses you can get if you talk to cat which you've already talked to is "We're already friends, meow!". Awww. Telma's cat is a very plot important kitty.
        -   There's also the minigame late in the game where you explore the Hidden Village as a wolf in order to find and talk to 20 cats, all of whom want to be friends!
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_: Remlits look cute and innocent, but only during the day. At night...
-   _Mega Man V_ for Game Boy introduced players to Tango, a cute, green robotic cat that meowed endearingly when summoned — and then sprouted spikes and rolled menacingly into enemies! _Mushroom Kingdom Fusion_ brought him back as one of Roll's weapons.
-   In _Miitopia_, you Mii can **be** cute kittens, as it is a _Class_ that focuses on dishing out damage with Wolverine Claws and restore MP to teammates by cuddling them.
-   _Minecraft_ has kittens made of blocks and they are _still_ adorable. They are also one of the game's only defenses against the kamikaze creepers which won't go within 16 metres of one.
-   _Mitsumete Knight_: Laury Callwell gets a few scenes where she finds three cute kittens abandoned, adopts them, and later lose them, leading to the protagonist helping her to search for them. The latter scene also draw to this trope the tough as nails Gene Petromolla and Sam Burston, revealing them as adorable Kindhearted Cat Lovers.
-   _Monster Hunter_: Your character can interact with the simply adorable Felyne, a race of cat people. Starting with _Monster Hunter Freedom Unite_, keeping one as a partner has beneficial effects such as decreasing damage taken, enhancing the benefits of food consumed, reducing field tool breakage, affecting the size of your bombs, improve cooking results, negating the intimidation effects of some monsters, and much more. But watch out for the Melynx; behind their cuddly appearance lies master thieves and pickpockets. In _Monster Hunter Portable 3rd_, _two_ Felynes can accompany you on hunts as Palicoes, helping you fight monsters and gather items. _Monster Hunter Generations_ lets you _play as_ a Felyne hunter.
-   _Mortal Kombat_: While Kintaro would normally be classified as Panthera Awesome, if you manage to pull off a Babality on him in _Mortal Kombat 9_, you wind up turning him into a cute kitten version of himself, complete with kittenish mewling and purring and him drinking from a saucer of milk.
-   _Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector_, as its title implies, has you collecting kittens. More specifically, you use cat food and toys such as balls and scratching posts to attract cats to your yard. However, like real-life cats, the cats in this game are a bit shy and will only come to your yard while the game app is closed.
-   The Nintendo 3DS _Nintendogs_ games are named "Nintendogs + Cats". They add kittens to the roster, though the main focus still goes to the puppies. The kittens aren't terribly active, can't learn tricks, and are hard to gain money from but at least they're cute.
-   _No More Heroes_:
    -   First game:
        -   Jeane the cat, the closest thing to family our homicidal hero Travis has in Santa Destroy. The player can interact and play with her by selecting the "Jeane" option in Travis' living room. There is absolutely nothing gained by doing this. Try to stop yourself doing it every time you're in the room.
        -   One of the jobs in the first game has Travis wondering around picking up cute runaway cats.
    -   _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_: Jeane the cat returns in this game, much chubbier. A major sidequest is to bring her back down to brainshattering cuteness, which also nets a nice extra.
    -   _No More Heroes III_: Jeane gave birth to several adorable kittens prior to the events of the game, and Travis is asked by her to retrieve them all.
-   In _No Umbrellas Allowed_, Eggie visits your shop to show you her pet cat Guylian, who looks at you with adorable, big green eyes. She also tells you to give Guylian a warm smile whenever you see the latter after work, and doing so will eventually have her dropping by your shop to rest. Your customers fawn over how cute she is and give you donations or ask for simple item recommendations, to HUE's jealousy.
-   _Ōkami_ also provides lots and lots of cats to feed in the game's strangely endearing "Animal Feeding" mini-quests. The game went as far as to reinstate the Cat as a Chinese Zodiac constellation, and this Brush God gets along quite well with Amaterasu despite the latter being a canine.
-   _Persona_:
    -   There are plenty of stray cats to feed and befriend in _Persona 3_. One of Elizabeth's Requests is to feed one in particular. When you do feed it, it comes back looking larger and healthier.
    -   _Persona 4_ has them too, including one you can spend time playing with to increase a social stat.
    -   _Persona 5_ has Morgana, a Badass Adorable anthropomorphic cat (or cat-like creature, it's unclear) who tags along with the protagonists in their quest to help those who abuse their power reform.
-   _Phantasy Star_: The musk cats are cute kittens that talk! In the first game, one is even a playable character!
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   There are several kitties in the series, many of them are sweet and loyal to the trainers, though getting into the evolutions may take too long for some. Meowth, Glameow, Purrloin, Espurr and especially Skitty are the proper kitten Mons (though, in Purrloin's case, it uses its natural cuteness to its advantage in order to get away with stealing things and to lower the guard of its opponents).
    -   _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ introduces a cat named Litten as the fire starter. Its fur is oily and highly flammable so it can attack with flaming hairballs.
    -   The ninth generation starter is Sprigatito, a Grass-type kitten. Its _Violet_ Pokedex entry states that it has a sweet scent that mesmerizes those around it. The scent grows stronger when its under the sun.
-   The entire premise of _Purr Pals_, a _Nintendogs_ clone for the DS and Wii.
-   The _Puyo Puyo_ series has a pair of cute twin Siamese cats named Cait Sith.
-   _RuneScape_: During one quest, certain gruesome scenes (such as a brain transplant) are censored with animations of kittens performing adorable actions such as playing with yarn or wearing pirate outfits.
-   _Shadow of Destiny_: Doing an extra side quest can result in the library being filled with cute cats. You just go back into the past and give the little girl there a kitten. Back to the future, and bam. The place is filled with its descendants.
-   _The Sims_:
    -   In _MySims_, the cat statue ground flair adds 3% to a building's cuteness.
    -   In _The Sims 3_, a Sim who uses the "Awwww" interaction on a kitten will receive the +10 moodlet "Kittens!" for one Sim hour. A cat that had just given birth to a litter of kittens will give herself and her family the +80 moodlet "New Kittens" for one Sim day. All the same things work with Precious Puppies, too.
-   _Something Else_: Cat Beach has Luigi collecting 75 kittens for a cat before he allows Luigi to move onto the next level. The cat even does a cute smile at Luigi when Luigi completes this task.
-   _Stray (2022)_ marketed itself on being able to play as an adorable orange moggie wandering through a cyberpunk\-style world, complete with the ability to meow, jump, and solve puzzles by knocking stuff off ledges.
-   Subverted with _Sukeban Shachou Rena_ for Wii, which, despite being based around a premise of cat love, ended up being the worst-selling Wii game at 100 copies sold.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story_ has a Collection Sidequest in which Bowser collects Blitties, kittens made out of coin blocks by sucking them out of an enemy. Collecting all of them grants him his ultimate attack: The Broggy Bonker, which if performed perfectly will have Broggy lead the blitties in a blitzkrieg against the foe.
    -   _Super Mario 3D World_ features cat-based outfits for Mario and co. Its Updated Re-release adds a campaign called _Bowser's Fury_, which centers around Lake Lapcat's friendly cats (who turn evil when Fury Bowser shows up) and not-so-friendly enemies with cat-like features.
-   _The Talos Principle_: There's one on the cover art, and you can free one in level B7. If you do, it changes the "free will" ending slightly, with you character picking up and holding a kitten at the ending.
-   _TinkerQuarry_: Although he resembles an adult cat, Whiskers has a cheerful personality, and is quite the Nice Guy, invoking this.
-   _Tokimeki Memorial 2_: The resident Kindhearted Cat Lovers, Miyuki Kotobuki and Kaori Yae, have positively adorable scenes revolving around cats: you can see in Childhood Mode a young Miyuki with her kitten Mii-chan in the front pocket of her dungarees, playing with her; and Kaori has a post-She's Back scene where she finds and happily plays with a kitten. In addition, Kaori has a beautiful Image Song named "Tsukiyo no Koneko" ("Moonlight Kitten").
-   _Tomodachi Life_ has the Rent-A-Cat Coupon level-up gift, which allows the Mii possessing it to play with a kitten, whether by themselves or with their friends.
-   _Touhou Project_: Chen is sometimes depicted in fanart as having cat subordinates. And her animal form, as part of her nekomata shtick, is a two-tailed cat. She canonically _tries_ to have cat subordinates. They don't listen to her and only hang around because she feeds them.
-   _True Love Junai Monogatari_: In under certain circumstances the Player Character might find one during a rainy day. If he does, he can keep it hidden in his apartment or not. She's actually a Cat Girl... sort-of.
-   _WarioWare: Smooth Moves_ has _disco dancing kitties_ in Jimmy T's stage.
-   _World of Warcraft_: Even Kel'Thuzad has a cat. And he gets angry if it's killed (however, rumors about doing so making him harder to kill or altering the Random Drops have been proven false).
    -   On the other hand, an undead questgiver has nothing better to do with her kitty than using it as a guinea pig for experiments with demonic substances.
    -   With pet battles, now there are many different cats to collect as vanity pets, including Kel'Thuzad's cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, now a reward if you collect certain pets that drop from older raids. Unlike most cats in the game, he's classified as undead and has ice attacks.
-   You can easily buy kitten 'companions' (pets) in _World of Warcraft_, provided you have enough gold.
-   _Yo-kai Watch_: Jibanyan is the series mascot and is a cute, talking cat.

    Web Animation 

    Webcomics 

-   Random kitties go here.
-   _Bittersweet Candy Bowl_, being a comic about anthropomorphic cats (and dogs!) has Molly, Abbey's cheerful younger sister. Fanart of hypothetical offspring is also a fan favorite, and the author herself sometimes gets into it.
-   _Breaking Cat News_ is simply made of this trope. Special shout-out goes to Beatrix, the ever enthusiastic polydactyl intern, who shows up and rearranges the whole station. She sets up the social media accounts, and she's "got a system!"
-   _Cat Nine_ of course, which can turn into other animals or cat girl too.
-   Mike is killed and one of their own is missing. What will make the _College Roomies from Hell!!!'s_ day better? This.
-   _Commander Kitty_ has Fluffy, an adorable Cloud Cuckoolander kitten. Just look at her go.
-   Brittany from _Domain Tnemrot_. Also, her owner.
-   _Drowtales_ nastily subverted this. Kel'Noz gives little Ariel a kitten — which then gets sick while Ariel is locked in a room for a week with it, and Ariel's abusive older sister Syphile, disgusted, kills the kitten in front of her.
-   Dolly in _+EV_.
-   _The Gamercat_ manages to do this even though most of the main cast is made of cats: Pixel (a female cat) finds Glitch the kitten adorable, and in a story arc Gamercat himself tries to use Glitch's cuteness to pick up girls.
-   _Girl Genius_: Krosp isn't cute exactly, but he's very good for Agatha.
-   _Girly_: Marshmallow Cat is genetically modified to be the world's most perfect cat. She gets pregnant with the scary black cat and has tons of ridiculously cute kittens.

-   _Loserz_: Gus. Jodie is reduced to nigh incomprehensibility in the face of his sheer adorableness.
-   _Narbonic_: When the mad scientist has her superintelligent gerbils begin their inevitable rebellion against their creator, she sends in a cute kitten named Sir Pounce. The gerbils' human intelligence causes them to coo and aww over the kitten even as he eats them one by one. After his death, Sir Pounce is spotted in Hell.
    
    "You can't sentence Sir Pounce to eternal torment!"  
    "It was an evil kitten. We can't give leniency for cuteness."
    
-   _Nip and Tuck_: While they are inconvenient in many ways, they are easier to wake up to than a DJ.
-   _The Order of the Stick_: Mr. Scruffy. In a stick figure comic, his presence never fails to add a sense of levity to the scene. Even when he's disemboweling minor human characters. (A joke about a notorious quirk in the _Dungeons & Dragons_ game rules.)
-   _Papi Nyang_ is all about cats and that gives us Socks, the newborn who is adorable once they start walking and talking.

-   _Problem Sleuth_:
-   _Rhapsodies_: Goblin, Lysistrata's store cat, exploits this for all it'sworth.

-   _A Softer World_: "Calm down, guys. We can ride this out. Just convert all our stock to kittens for now. They just get fluffier and fluffier."
    -   Another strip plays with the idea of "_Pride and Prejudice and Kittens_. No. Kittens and Kittens and even more Kittens, oh my goodness, by Jane Austen."
-   _Squid Row_: A good reason to take in a cat: it's really a kitten!
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_ has the main cast eventually take in a kitten. At some point, the animal causes such a bad case of Cuteness Proximity in most of the team that they don't notice Lalli has woken up from his two day long Deep Sleep until the one person who noticed points it out.
-   _Sticky Dilly Buns_: The irascible Ruby acquires a kitten whose cuteness (arguably mostly an Informed Attribute) serves to relieve her Hair-Trigger Temper; see, for example, the scene where he's introduced to Amber (who names him "Minow"). For a Bilingual Bonus, French-Canadian cats do not "meow" or "miouw". They _minow_. Hence the name.
-   _Wapsi Square_: Selenium, the kitten that acquires Amanda.
-   _We Are The Wyrecats_: The kids like to keep cats around their workspace. K.A.'s father isn't too keen on this, but the team loves them.

    -   In a first-season episode, a botched practical joke leaves Starfire angry at Beast Boy — who tries to cheer her up by turning into a kitten. It doesn't work the first time, but the second...
    -   There are metric tons of fanart where BB is in kitten form — and being stroked, petted, or otherwise admired by Raven or Terra. Try to guess the obvious Double Entendre.
-   _ThunderCats (2011)_: Young Catfolk Wilykat and Kit are cute Cheerful Children, but also experienced Artful Dodgers who very deliberately invoke this trope when searching for marks to pickpocket. When they try to convince The Hero Lion-O to let them tag along with his team of Thundercats, they Cat Smile, Faux Paw and employ kittenish mewling to play on their sympathies.
-   _The Tick_: When the Tick was trying to masquerade as a villain to track down another villain, he was asked to prove it by, well, eating a kitten. Naturally, he beat all the bad guys and saved the kitten, instead.
-   _Tiny Toon Adventures_: Furrball is portrayed as both this trope and the prime example of The Woobie.
-   _Tom and Jerry_:
    -   Averted in the cartoon "Triplet Trouble" when Mammy Two Shoes adopted three kittens who turned out to be complete brats that terrorized Tom and later went after Jerry. It was one of the few times Tom and Jerry teamed up against a greater foe.
    -   "The Unshrinkable Jerry Mouse" has another interesting variation: Jerry protecting a new kitten from the jealous rage of Tom. In other words, a mouse is protecting a _kitten_ from a _cat_, never mind that kittens eventually turn into cats.
-   There are several Van Beuren Studios cartoons that featured cute kittens as the protagonists, a trio of which were minor recurring characters in their Rainbow Parade shorts, including the kits in "Rough on Rats", "Merry Kittens", "Rag Dog" and "Scottie Finds A Home". Felix the Cat also counts in his three shorts produced by the studio.
-   _Wander over Yonder_: Little Bits is this, as well as both Cats Are Mean and Cute Is Evil since she uses her cuteness to hypnotize victims by appearing to be innocent, when in fact she's an evil bounty hunter.
-   Buurpoes the kitten<small>◊</small> from the Dutch children's series _Woezel & Pip_ is a very cute kitten. She's close friends with the titural puppy characters, and mostly purrs out her sentences and words.
-   _Xiaolin Showdown_: The cat wearing Catwoman wannabe Katnappe uses genetically altered super-kittens as weapons against the Xiaolin.

    Real Life 

-   When the (extremely popular) Sheffield branch of Virgin Megastore finally closed, they left a sign in the window reading "Thank you and goodbye. We love you all. P.S. HMV kills kittens for profit."
-   There's a Japanese train station which never got any service or tourism — so Tama, a cat, was made station master. The station's now raking in the tourism money, which, according to Stephen Colbert, goes to "repairing the horrific accidents that result from having a _cat_ as station master." She was so popular that the moment she passed away, the company officials and the cat's fans decided to elevate her as a goddess during her funeral.
-   This is closely related to the idea of killing/eating kittens as a definite sign of evilness, as in this rather elaborate insult hurled at a Canadian politician.
-   Life subverts itself in that even adorable little kittens are proficient killers and learn to hunt as early as three or four weeks of age. It's creepy-cute to see a kitten carrying around a (nearly) dead mouse that looks to be nearly the size of its wee head.
-   Islam in general tend to consider cats as clean and playful animals, and Prophet Muhammad, a Kindhearted Cat Lover, took care of cats and kittens with respect. Also, as they are ritually clean in addition to adorable and playful factor, they are allowed to keep as pets and enter mosques and homes.
-   Some studies have indicated that having a cat "may" have limited beneficial effects on the health and well-being of people, especially older adults. Also, medical researchers have demonstrated that stroking a purring cat can lower human blood pressure and pulse rate, as well as increase feelings of peace and well-being. That said, pregnant women are advised to not handle cat litter, since it contains germs that, while harmless to adults, can pose a real danger to the fetus.
-   Just search for most popular YouTube videos for "Pets And Animals" and see how many you get featuring cats.
-   Likewise, search for "kitten cam" on YouTube. Tiny Kittens HQ, Kitten Academy, Kitten Cuddle Room, Alley to Attic, The Critter Room, Frank Einstein's... Many are the offspring of feral mamas who are spayed after giving birth and then everybody is put up for adoption. (Partly thanks to environmental experiments at Tiny Kittens HQ, we now know that many adult feral cats can be socialized and adopted like any other.)
-   Taylor Swift has designed several greeting cards featuring kittens. She's on record as saying "I feel like kitten cards make everything better, pretty much." Here. And of course she then went and adopted one (two, now).
-   Cat cafés are cafés featuring a number of cats that can be interacted with by customers. They started in Korea in about 1997, are rather popular in Japan, and have spread to the U.S., Canada and Australia. The cats frequently come from a shelter and can be adopted.
-   In the spring of 2018, filmmaker Paris Zarcilla discovered an unknown cat with four newborn kittens under his bed. She had apparently slipped through his open back door. Overwhelmed with protective emotions, Zarcilla decided he was now a "cat dad" and gave himself completely to their care. The crowning moment was taking the little mother to the vet and discovering that she had no chip, so he was able to keep the whole family.
    
    _This is too much. I'm approaching nirvana. I legitimately suffer from anxiety attacks and depression and my capacity to deal with it recently has been waning. The Cat Gods have smiled upon me with benevolence and turned the monsters under my bed into kittens._
    
-   Some NYC bodegas keep cats to control rodents, and those cats are popular amongst locals who shop at the stores. For many, seeing a cat in a bodega brightens their day.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In fact, when someone complained about a bodega cat on yelp, New Yorkers were outraged and quickly rushed to the cats' defense.
-   Managed colonies of feral cats are used in some cities to get rid of rats and vermin naturally. Because the cats are spayed and neutered, they cannot breed out of control.
