She's (usually) a human. He's anything else. Together, they work to achieve common goals.

She's often a mage, summoner, warrior, adventurer, detective or just an unfortunate average girl who got mixed up in an unusual situation. She will most likely be a human, but can be anything human-adjacent (for example, she might be an elf mage who entered a pact with a demon in a universe that has elves and humans living side-by-side.). Often times she's a skilled fighter, or at least capable of protecting herself, but it's also possible that she never had to fight anyone in her life. If she's not that good in a fight, she still often has other skills she can utilize, like intelligence, street smarts, charisma or empathy.

He's most commonly a demon, ghost, beast or other supernatural creature like a vampire, but sci-fi works might feature an android, an AI or an alien. It's possible that he used to be human, but isn't anymore due to different circumstances. He also needs to be sapient - something like a female handler with a male Attack Animal isn't this trope. He doesn't need to be strictly a man, but needs to have a masculine presentation (like an android who has a masculine voice and name). It's worth noting that "monster" is used here in the broad way meaning "other", and has nothing to do with the "monster's" appearance (which can range from clearly inhuman to near-indistinguishable, like in case of a ghost or a highly-realistic android) or personality/behavior (from an aggresive berserker to a proper gentleman).

Together, they work with each other to achieve some kind of a goal, noble or otherwise. This can be anything from winning combat tournaments, adventuring, solving mysteries, planning to take over the world or protecting it, to something as mundane as running the local inn, travelling with their wares or conning people out of spare change. Their dynamic can range from anything between Platonic Life-Partners to Snark-to-Snark Combat (or both at once) to even Teeth-Clenched Teamwork, they just can't be openly antagonistic and working against each other. Their partnership might be due to a deep bond between them, a strictly business relationship of convenience or unfortunate circumstances bringing them together, with the two trying to find a way to get out of their situation. Sometimes they might openly be in a romantic relationship, but platonic partnerships (often with heavy doses of Ship Tease) are more common. They usually see each other as even, and the matter of their differences doesn't really come up that often (though it's possible she thinks that Freaky Is Cool).

Their skillsets and abilities often complement each other, allowing them to achieve things that would be impossible if they were by themselves: A ghost can't interact with the physical world, but he can give her advice, phase through walls or possess others. She might channel a demon for a strength boost in hand-to-hand combat or spells. A beast might protect her from physical threats, while she handles the diplomacy or is the brains of the operation.

Most of these duos work on the basis of contrast - women tend to be associated with gentleness and beauty, so pairing up a human woman with a non-human man, who often looks or behaves abnormally is interesting visually and/or dynamic-wise. In most modern works, she tends to be just as capable as he is, or at least has a different skillset she can use to not leave her completely helpless if he's not around. It's worth mentioning that while in most cases the "monster" will be the more physically stronger and imposing, this isn't a rule. An example like a human woman bodyguarding a frail, male alien also fits under this trope (though these examples are few and far between).

The most important part of this trope is just how different the two are on a basic, biological level; a pair made up of a human woman and a male demon will pretty much always qualify, but a pair made up of a human woman and en elf man is highly situational and depends on how (if at all) elves are inherently different from humans in this universe. Cyborgs are a similar situation- while a pair consisting of a human woman and a masculine-presenting android fits this trope, a pair consisting of a human woman and a male cyborg isn't inherently this trope (especially if he leans more into his human side). How their paticular species is seen in-universe might be a clue in more debatable examples (if he's considered an "anomaly" or "other", while she's the "standard", they qualify).

Often overlaps with Action Duo, Adventure Duo, Battle Couple (if the relationship between them is romantic), Female Flatfoot and Snarky Guy, Huge Guy, Tiny Girl, Interspecies Friendship, Odd Couple, Odd Friendship, Opposites Attract, Savvy Guy, Energetic Girl, Talker and Doer, Willing Channeler.

Compare A Girl and Her X and Symbiotic Possession. Contrast Demonic Possession, which is usually done without consent and with malicious intent. Sometimes related to You Sexy Beast. If they're in a romantic relationship, but don't work together, that's Beast and Beauty (a specific dynamic) or Interspecies Romance (more broad category). Death and the Maiden is a popular visual motif that portrays the personification of death with a young woman.

-   _Darkstalkers_: Donovan Baine is a Dhampyr (half human, half vampire) and travels with a human girl (though one who has psychic powers) named Anita. Donovan looks after Anita and wants to help her with the trauma she got from being shunned by other humans due to her psychic powers.

    -   The _Devil May Cry 2_ novel has Dante teaming up with a human woman named Beryl. She is actually a prototype of the aforementioned Lady, being a female devil hunter with a BFG and a father who becomes a demon.
    -   _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_: A variation with Dante and Lady. The former is half-demon while the latter is fully human. Both are on the heroic side but are antagonistic towards each other for most of the story due to Lady's prejudice towards demons. The climax shows them fighting demons side by side after both undergo Character Development and come to see each other as allies if not friends.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_:
    -   A female Dovahkiin that belongs to one of the "men" races (Breton, Imperial, Nord or Redguard) can recruit the Khajit Kharjo or the Argonian Derkeethus as her follower. Likewise, a male Khajiit or Argonian Dovahkiin can recruit one of many female followers that belong to "men" races, like Lydia or Mjoll the Lioness.
        -   Special mention should go to a female "men" Dovahkiin who recruits Farkas or his twin brother Vilkas. While both of them appear to be normal Nords, the Companions faction storyline reveals that the brothers are actually werewolves, like all high-ranking members of the guild.
    -   A female non-beast Dovahkiin can arguably have this dynamic with Paarthurnax, the leader of the Greybeards, who is a dragon. They have to work together at least to an extent to resolve the main plot.
-   _Fallout_
    -   _Fallout 3_: A female Lone Wanderer can recruit a supermutant Fawkes, a ghoul Charon or a Mr Gutsy robot Sergeant RL-3 as her companion.

        -   In the "Far Harbor" DLC, Sole Survivor and the synth Nick Valentine work together to solve the case of a missing girl.
-   Midna (and Zelda, to a lesser extent) and Link in _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_. Midna is a Twili, a member of a race from the Realm of Twilight, who is proficient in Twili Shadow Magic and very much knows more than she lets on. Link spends quite a bit of time as a Hylian, but the dynamic is more apparent when Link is in his wolf form, as Midna rides around on his back, gives him orders, and generally corrals him around Hyrule to recover the Fused Shadows for her own ends. Following a near-death experience and a good helping of Character Development, it becomes much closer to a partnership between them, with a heaping dose of Ship Tease as well.
-   _League of Legends_: Downplayed with Lamb and Wolf, the Kindred. The two are a pair of spiritual entities representing death across Runeterra. Lamb is an anthropomorphic female... well, _lamb_ in contrast to the much more animalistic male Wolf.
-   _Lollipop Chainsaw_: Juliet is a zombie slayer who wants to defeat the Dark Purveyors, find her family and get out of her zombie-infected town. She's accompanied by her boyfriend Nick, who's just a severed head (who she decapitated herself to stop the infection from spreading) she has attached to her skirt. Nick can still talk, briefly take over headless zombies to help Juliet with heavy lifting and be used as a projectile, but it's Juliet who has to handle most of the fighting and legwork herself.
-   _Murdered: Soul Suspect_: Ronan O'Connor comes back from the dead as a ghost, and starts a partnership with a teenage medium Joy Foster. She's trying to help him find his murderer and together they're trying to find Joy's Missing Mom.
-   _Overwatch_:
    -   Ashe can summon her robot companion, B.O.B as her ultimate, who acts as a stationary turret and a temporary seventh team member. Outside of gameplay, B.O.B serves Ashe as her bodyguard and butler.
    -   Winston is a hyper intelligent gorilla, who is sometimes deployed on field missions with fellow Overwatch members. He technically creates this kind of setup with any female Overwatch member he's fighting alongside with at the moment, but in-lore he seems to be the closest with Tracer and Mei.
-   _Skullgirls_:
    -   Fillia is currently a host to a sentient parasite named Samson. Samson is attached to the back of her head, which makes him look like her hair, with which he can grab and hit opponents with. Fillia isn't that good of a fighter, so it's mostly Samson doing all the legwork for her, in exchange for Fillia's body supporting his own.
        -   Samson also formed this kind of a duo with his old host, a woman named Delilah.
    -   Squigly and her parasite Leviathan are a more sophisticated and harmonious equivalent. Leviathan is devoted to Squigly, especially since his old host was actually Squigly's father. Their moves are more like a dance, compared to Samson's more dominant and brutal fighting style, where Fillia is mostly dragged around by him.
    -   To a lesser extent than Fillia and Squigly, we have Peacock and her parasite, the tiny bird-like Avery. Unlike Fillia and Squigly, whose bodies are literally merged with their respective parasites, Avery's body is separate from Peacock's, and he functions more like an Assist Character that appears in some of her attacks. Andy Anvil, another one of Peacock's assists, also qualifies.
-   _South Park: The Fractured but Whole_: Henrietta can summon Satan himself for her ultimate move.
-   _Stardew Valley_: A female Farmer can ask Krobus, a shadow person to move in with her. Krobus will help around the farm in the same way a human spouse will, even willing to help raise Farmer's children if she has any from a previous relationship.

-   _Them's Fightin' Herds_: Oleander entered a pact with a demon known as FHTNG (or Fred) to protect her home from the predator invasion. Fred is currently locked in a tome Oleander carries with her (and uses as an Improvised Weapon), but he can reach out from it to swipe his claws, or give some of his powers to Oleander. His plans regarding Oleander aren't fully clear, but for the time being he's fine with working with her.
-   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky The 3rd_: Being a Vignette Episode connected by dungeons, one of the stories is about an orphan girl Mary befriending and riding a friendly small dragon.
-   _Transistor_: Red fights using the Transistor, a BFS with the spirit of her boyfriend, Mr. Nobody locked inside. He can't do anything by himself, but he offers Red company by talking to her and encouraging her during fights.
-   _The Witcher_:
    -   _The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings_: Seems to be the case with the elf Iorveth and the human leader of the Aedirnian resistance Saskia. Ultimately subverted, when we find out that Saskia was actually a dragon taking a human form.
    -   _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_: In the _Blood and Wine_ DLC, the witcher Geralt works with the duchess Anna Henrietta and later on with her sister, Sylvia Anna.
-   _The Wolf Among Us_: Zig-zagged in case of Bigby Wolf and Snow White. While both of them are Fables, Snow White always looks like a regular human woman. Bigby owes his human form to an enchanted dagger he was stabbed with, and can transform back into a more monstrous wolf-like form at will (or when the situation calls for it). They work together to solve a mysterious murder of their neighbor and fellow Fable.

    Western Animation 

-   _Beetlejuice_: Perky Goth's Lydia Deetz's best friend is Beetlejuice, who is described as "The Ghost With The Most", but acts more like a Literal Genie. She is his Morality Chain and the only one who can keep him at all under control; he, in turn, is her adoring protector and considers it his mission to make her happy.
-   _Gargoyles_: Eliza Maza is a human detective. She has the closest relationship with the Gargoyle leader Goliath, with whom she has some Ship Tease while they fight crime together.
-   _The Haunted World of El Superbeasto_: Suzi X is a bubbly, one-eyed super agent who fights crime and monsters in the city with her partner Murray The Robot (who also serves as Suzi's vehicles and has a huge crush on her).
-   _Jane and the Dragon_ is about a peasant girl who lives and works in the royal palace and is best friends with the resident dragon. They help the king solve various problems in the realm.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   One of Twilight Sparkle's closest friends is a dragon named Spike. Though it's downplayed, since Twilight actually hatched Spike when she was very young and been raising him since (likely with help from other ponies), so Spike seems to identify more with ponies, rather than dragons. Spike also serves as Twilight's assistant and is her means of contact with Princess Celestia.
    -   Fluttershy manages to befriend the Mad God Discord. She's pretty much his Morality Pet and the only character he cares about (except himself, of course).
