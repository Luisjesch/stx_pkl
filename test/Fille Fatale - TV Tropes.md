_"She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up."_

A Femme Fatale in training, a Fille Fatale (French for "fatal girl", idiomatically "girl to die for") is an adolescent or younger girl who knows how to use her looks to get what she wants.

Where some will focus solely on their peers, others want actual grown men and will proceed to seduce one. She may well initiate a Teacher/Student Romance plot. This, of course, has much bigger implications for the adult in question, who is very liable to suffer sacking at best (if he's a teacher), with a statutory rape charge being more common (depending on jurisdiction).

It is also not uncommon to depict her as an adult, but so much younger and less mature than the rest of the cast that she is far closer to this trope than to Femme Fatale or The Vamp, particularly if her advances towards older men are rejected.

Note that, in real life, children who exhibit sexualized behavior have often been the victims of sexual abuse. This is rarely addressed in fiction. In some people's opinion, overexposure to adult content like movies, porn, the internet, and music can cause the same kind of prematurely sexualized behavior, though how true this is is **hotly** debated.

Compare her Spear Counterparts, the KidAnova and Dirty Kid. In gay media, a particularly young and aggressive Twink can fill much the same role.

For obvious reasons, Dawson Casting is very likely, as is a Hand Wave that the character is much older than she looks (maybe even to the point of Really 700 Years Old). See also Troubling Unchildlike Behavior. In some Western countries (though certainly not all of them), a major source of Squick.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Touka Yada and Hinano Kurahashi from _Assassination Classroom_, while we don't see much of them, are shown to be this trope thanks to being students of Irina Jelavic, a professional seductive assassin who serves as the class' foreign language teacher.
-   Mitsuko Souma of _Battle Royale_ tries to be a Femme Fatale, but she really is this. Unlike most examples of this trope, it actually _is_ a result of sexual abuse as a child.
-   Juno from _Beastars_ proudly uses her looks and her wolf strength to get what she wants.
-   Alois Trancy from the second season of _Black Butler_ is a Rare Male Example; despite his young age, he's already very aware of how to use flirtation and sex appeal to get what he wants, often wears skimpy booty shorts, and has No Sense of Personal Space. He's a textbook example for the oversexed behavior of some young victims of sexual abuse. Sadly, Alois (or better said, Jim Macken) _is_ one: he and other boys around his age were Sex Slaves for a rich nobleman, and he was the only one who survived. Already unstable from _before_ the abuse thanks to the death of his younger brother Luca, Alois /Jim ultimately crossed the Despair Event Horizon and make a Deal with the Devil, summoning Claude Faustus...
-   _A Certain Magical Index_. Lessar of New Light is a middle schooler who probably can't be much older than 14, yet already possesses an impressive knowledge of seduction and love of lewdness of someone many years older. She's willing to use every trick she can think of to "convince" Touma to get with her. Granted, it _is_ partially motivated by her desire to get him to swear loyalty to the UK, but at times that just seems to be the official excuse since she was always interested in him after he saved her life.
-   _A Certain Scientific Railgun_. Given her age of only 13 years old, Kuroko Shirai's sexual fixation of her "Onee-sama" makes her this. Especially when you see her taste in underwear and swimsuits.
-   Jeremy from _A Cruel God Reigns_ is a rare real life example in that in the manga, the entire first six volumes are a flashback to the sexual and physical abuse that he received at the hands of his stepfather. While this is going on, Jeremy begins to envision drinking Ian's blood in a fetish sort of way, and repeatedly forcibly kisses his roommate William (although this is more along the lines of Sex for Solace). In the latter, present day half of the story, Jeremy becomes a teenaged prostitute and is constantly making advances toward or is trying to seduce his stepbrother Ian to "bring him down to his level" and essentially punish him for not believing or helping him when he first confessed that he was being raped by their father. He seduces or trades sex for things like drugs from his older classmate Pansy or even a random adult at a party in exchange for a cigarette. Although on the older side at 16, Jeremy's flirtations are blatant examples of Fan Disservice and are far more adult than they should be.
-   In _Cyborg 009_'s story _Heart of the Machine_, Albert/004 strikes an Odd Friendship with a 13/14-year-old girl named Nana. She turns out to be this, due to _extreme_ Parental Abandonment; at some point she even strips naked to taunt Albert, and when he doesn't take the bait, she covers herself and breaks down crying.
-   Akari in _Domina no Do!_. She's way too dangerously oversexed for a grade-schooler.
-   _GTO: 14 Days in Shonan_: Twins Miko and Riko Sakaki use their yakuza foster father's inappropriate interest in their bodies to wrap him around their little fingers.
-   In _Gunsmith Cats_, Minnie May was working as a prostitute and taking age-slowing drugs to appeal to those with a young girl fetish. Though it's explained rather vaguely, she used drugs in order to hasten her puberty so that her adult boyfriend wouldn't feel weird about being with her. She got breasts and hips a lot earlier than normal, but, as a side-effect, stopped growing for good.
-   15-going-on-16 years old Yukime from _Hell Teacher Nube_ is introduced as one. She at first intended to either drag him by force with her or kill him, but when she committed the mistake of threatening his students and he fought her off, her love became more genuine and she decided to gain his affections by more honest means.
-   Akane, a character in _The Irregular at Magic High School_, feels comfortable flirting with the teenaged Kichijouji.
-   Despite only being 14, Lucy Steel from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run_ is aware of her good looks and uses it to her advantage, first by seducing Scarlet Valentine into giving her the Corpse Parts that Funny Valentine has in his possession, followed by her disguising herself as Scarlet and trying to sway Valentine into giving up everything he has that could help him achieve his goals. Though, the latter works a little too well, as Valentine finds out that she's not actually Scarlet and still ends up attempting to rape Lucy.

-   Ibuki Yagami from _Maison Ikkoku_, who aggressively pursues Godai, her substitute teacher.
-   Older Than They Think; this archetype appeared in 1975 with Meg, the tomboyish heroine of the Magical Girl series _Majokko Meg-chan_. The girl is pretty aware of her good looks, is coquettish and outspoken (unlike the more mellow heroines of the time), and the OP of the series has her singing about using her beauty to woo guys and get what she wants from them.
-   15-year-old Flay Allster from _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_. When her father is killed by a ZAFT pilot, she decides that she wants the Coordinators of ZAFT dead, and also wants her former classmate Kira to suffer for failing to protect her father. Knowing that Kira hates killing but is also the only one with the skills to really combat the Coordinators, she feigns a romantic interest in him and manipulates him into fighting, including at least one instance of having sex with him. Eventually, her feigned feelings begin to become genuine, but she dies before she ever gets to make amends for her original motivations, leaving Kira believing she was really in love with him from the get go.
-   Nao from _My-HiME_. She pretends to engage in Enjo Kosai, then rolls the marks with her CHILD.
-   Evangeline McDowell from _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ seems like this at first glance, but the little detail about her apparently being the oldest entity on campus technically disqualifies her. Now, if only she would quit making passes at her 10-year-old teacher...
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_'s Asuka Langley Soryuu has a blatant, possessive crush on Kaji (and raging 14-year-old narcissism in general) that turns out to be a symptom of her trauma and desperate need for attention to give her self-worth. Kaji doesn't accept her advances whatsoever, thinking she is much too young. She also makes a few subtle (and a few not so subtle) advances at main character Shinji Ikari, most of which pass over Shinji's head. In _Rebuild of Evangelion_, Asuka's crush on Kaji is completely absent, and she tries to win Shinji over by being a good cook.
-   Shzuku from _Omamori Himari_. She might be Really 700 Years Old water demon, but Shizuku is still the Token Mini-Moe here and intending to seduce the main character.
-   Green from _Pokémon Adventures_ is a young con artist and has no problem flirting (at least with boys near her age) to get what she wants. She grew out of it later, though.
-   _Rebuild World_: Sheryl, who's a teenager seemingly the same age as Akira (who doesn't know his age). Sheryl contrasts with her eventual ally, the adult full blown Femme Fatale Carol. Carol is a Predatory Prostitute who sleeps with men for money, information, or favors. While Sheryl uses her smile and empathetic words to sway and dig information out of men in what’s often compared to a Honey Trap (which her crush Akira reacts to with a combination of amazement at her Guile Hero skills, and Trauma Button panic that he may fall victim.) The two women’s interactions mostly consist of Carol lightheartedly teasing Sheryl.
-   Annie Labelle in _Robotech_ is a mild example as she was usually played for laughs, although it would be subject to more serious scrutiny today than back in 1985. Annie was said to be thirteen in most source materials of the time. She flirted (a lot) with Lunk, who was at least in his early twenties. She flirted not at all with Rand, whom, being 17 years old, was actually the closest to her own age. In her birthday episode, she treated the guys to what was essentially a burlesque show.
-   Ren and Maria from _Skip Beat!_, the latter invoking this trope in a daydream in which she imagines the former professing undying love. Outside said daydreams, he's fond of her (not in that way) and pities her for her family situation, so he pays attention to her.
-   Subverted in _Soul Eater_, where Rachel Boyd acts this way... but _only_ when she's the victim of Medusa's Grand Theft Me. Once Medusa leaves her body, it's presumed she returns to be a more or less normal 5-year-old girl.
-   Chinami from _Strawberry 100%_. She is very used to getting whatever she wants. She initially used Manaka as an excuse for dumping one of her previous "boyfriends" and eventually ended up joining the Film Studies Club. While she does not hold any genuine feelings for Manaka, she is bothered by how unremarkable she is to him.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul Jack_ provides a subtle example: Uruka Minami is well-aware of her looks, and uses them to create a false Love Triangle between herself, Fura, and Arima. She also uses her beautiful hair to lure another ghoul into attacking her, allowing her to earn the heroes' trust through being rescued by them. The killer's true nature is also hinted at during the very beginning of the story, when a male victim is discovered naked and robbed in a hotel room.
-   Mel in _Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle_ is thirteen years old and flirts with the seventeen year old Lux with surprising confidence. She's more mature than her age in other ways as well, having been forced to grow up quickly after her family was killed by Abyss.
-   Ryuuko from _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_. The creepiest version ever possible.

    Comic Books 

-   While pretty much every female member of the cast in _Archie_ comics is capable of this, it defines Cheryl Blossom to a T, much to the disgust (and regret) of Betty and Veronica.
-   _The Spirit_: Saree is P'Gell's stepdaughter who shows every sign of following in her stepmother's footsteps as The Vamp (and probably the Black Widow).

    Comic Strips 

-   Very cleverly and humorously applied in _Calvin and Hobbes_ without it being the least bit Squicky. 6-year old Susie Derkins "charmed" stuffed tiger Hobbes into giving her his water balloon during a water fight, and she used it to drench Calvin.

    Fan Works 

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Angela in _American Beauty_, played by Mena Suvari, is one of these—except she never actually did anything; the tales of her sexual conquests of older men were fabrications, and Lester gently turned her down upon learning she was still a virgin.
-   Kara from _Brick_, along with Laura Dannon. The two straddle the line between this and full-on Femme Fatale; they're high schoolers, but (seemingly) on the older end, and they're also involved in a variety of adult crimes such as drug dealing and blackmail. And one is indirectly involved in murder.
-   Ali and Heather in _Bully_.
-   _Carrie (2013)_ hints that Tina manipulates Mr Ulmann to pick on Carrie further in class. One scene has her flirting with him from the back of the room.
-   Michelle from _Cherrybomb (2009)_ is most certainly this.
-   Adrienne Forrester (Alicia Silverstone) in _The Crush_. A 14-year-old girl falls in love with her parents' house guest. When he declines her advances, she makes his life a living hell.
-   Dodger Allen, _Cry\_Wolf_ who is having an affair with one of her tteachers and murders another student she regards as a rival.
-   Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) of _Election_ has had an affair with one of her teachers (who is now an ex-teacher).
-   Leelee Sobieski's character in _Eyes Wide Shut_.
-   Double Subversion with Mia in _Fish Tank_. She is clearly intrigued by Connor from the beginning, but doesn't consciously act on it. However, when he starts reciprocating the interest, things turn inappropriate.
-   _Flower (2017)_: Erica is explicitly seventeen. Her m.o. is to charm older men and give them a blowjob while her friends obtain evidence of this act. The three of them then blackmail the guy for engaging in sexual acts with a minor and extort money out of him.
-   Bibi (Lynn-Holly Johnson) in _For Your Eyes Only_. James Bond even turns down the chance to sleep with her after she strips off and lies naked in his bed. Then, he offers to buy her an ice cream cone.
-   The title character in the 1987 British-Swedish movie _The Girl_. She's a 14 year-old Swedish schoolgirl who prostitutes herself out of boredom and seduces Franco Nero's character, who's married.
-   Hayley Stark of _Hard Candy_ appears to be an example at first—that is, until she throws it all aside, ties up the man she was previously seducing, accuses him of being a pedophile, pretends to castrate him, and generally just Mind Screws him until he commits suicide.
-   Luli in _Hick_ is a deconstruction. She _tries_ to be this trope but has the misfortune of dealing with someone far crazier and more ruthless than she is.
-   Wendy Hood from _The Ice Storm_ uses her sex appeal to tease Mikey and Sandy Carver.
-   _Jennifer's Body_: Jennifer is this, as she is in high school, but uses her sexuality to get into bars, pay for drinks, seduce boys, and lose her virginity to a cop. The fact that the same cop she teases in Melody Lane tells her "not here" since they are in public only adds to this.
-   Becky in _Kidulthood_.
-   Eli in _Let the Right One In_ is a subversion: she's a vampire that was 12 years old when transformed. Eli can't remember exactly how long it's been, but it's implied to be around 200 years. "She" is also actually a boy.
-   Regina's little sister in _Mean Girls_ (who looks to be about 9) is seen imitating the girls on TV lifting their shirts up. Mark Waters says on the DVD Commentary that he felt it was the low point in his directing career asking the child actress to move closer to the teddy bear before flashing.
-   Taissa Farmiga's 16 years old character in _Mindscape_, although in a very subtle light.
-   Mini, the Villain Protagonist of _Minis First Time_, is, at eighteen, technically too old for this trope, but nevertheless is worth mentioning here since it is her youth that makes her seductiveness, manipulativeness, and evil so astonishing and compelling.
-   Tamsin in _My Summer of Love_. She does seem to bring out the darkest, most fatalistic sides of Mona and Phil at the end.
-   _The Night of the Iguana_: Charlotte, played by 17-year-old Sue Lyon, is crawling all over Larry Shannon the Mexican tour guide. This is despite the constantly watching presence of her chaperone Miss Fellowes, who is threatening to have Shannon not only fired but arrested—in fact, that seems to be part of the thrill for Charlotte. (Yep, Sue Lyon, _Lolita_ herself, in another jail bait role.)
-   Nikki in _Odd Girl Out_, this aspect of her isn't directly relevant to why she's dangerous to the main protagonist, but we are told how she likes to manipulate boys.
-   Dede Truitt (Christina Ricci) in _The Opposite of Sex_ is the teenage sister of a gay teacher and, as soon as she moves in with him, sets about seducing his boyfriend and then getting pregnant by him.
-   Esther Coleman from _Orphan_. Or so we think, since her real name is Leena and she's truly in her 30's. Then again, the girl playing her was only 12, so it could still qualify.
-   Ivy (Drew Barrymore) in _Poison Ivy_, who is based on an actual experience producer Melissa Goddard had as a teenager - where a friend stayed over and tried to seduce her father. In this case, it's said that Ivy's parents were abusive and neglectful, and she's viewed very much as a tragic figure.
-   One of the most extreme examples; Violet in _Pretty Baby_ is a Daughter of a Whore who was raised in a whorehouse and has her virginity auctioned off by the madam when she's 12. After running away from the whorehouse, she seduces the photographer E. J. Bellocq and lives with him.
-   Kimberly Joyce from _Pretty Persuasion_ is a very ruthless example.
-   Sue Ann Stepanek (Tuesday Weld) from _Pretty Poison_ would be a vamp if it wasn't because she was 17.
-   12-year-old Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman) in _The Professional_ (aka _Léon_).
-   After a certain age, girls in any of the incarnations of _St. Trinian's_ fit this trope to a tee. Although it should be noted that this, like some of the other British examples listed on this page, features girls of 17 (the heavily sexualised Trinian's girls are Sixth Form students), and are therefore of legal age in Britain (Age of consent is 16 in the UK).
-   Jodie in _Tamara Drewe_. She even gets a song written about her, "Jail-bait Jody".
-   Tracy and Evie, the main characters in _Thirteen (2003)_, especially Evie, as Tracy mostly follows her lead. Aside from dressing provocatively for most of the film, at one point they seduce their hot lifeguard neighbor, who's in his 20s. He eventually resists and kicks them out of the house.
-   Sadie and McKayla in _Tragedy Girls_ are a pair of teenage Serial Killers who have no problem using their beauty and charisma to get close to their male victims. Sadie's also perfectly willing to go as far as actual sex if it means they can accomplish their goals.
-   Diane in _Trainspotting_.
-   Lux Lisbon in _The Virgin Suicides_, she's the second youngest (14 years old) and the only one who had sexual intercourse among her sisters.

    Literature 

-   In _Alatriste,_ Angélica de Alquézar uses this style to manipulate teenage squire Íñigo.
-   Ellington Feint from _All the Wrong Questions_, constantly lies, tricks and manipulates Lemony Snicket repeatedly, and he knows it. But because she has a sympathetic backstory, "a smile that could mean anything", and sometimes casually invades his personal space, Snicket keeps acting really stupid around her.
-   Alluded to with Chris Hargensen in _Carrie_. Although she is a high school senior by the time the story starts, her narration mentions that she's had numerous lovers who she could "dance and dandle at her whim". She's in a relationship with a slightly older boy who's just as twisted as she is, and she convinces him to help her pull off a Deadly Prank on the titular Carrie. It is however said that she's attracted to Billy precisely because she can't control him.
-   In _The Clique,_ Nina Callas is Alicia's beautiful cousin from Spain. She is able to attract most of the 7th grade boys, including the main characters' crushes. She also claims to have tons of experience with boys and knows what attracts them. It turns out that Nina was just using the boys to hide her kleptomania and was punished when she got back to Spain.
-   _Dragonvarld_: Evelina is a fifteen year old girl who worked as a Honey Trap with her father, a professional thief. Later too she becomes a Gold Digger aiming to seduce Prince Marcus with the hope she can be a royal mistress and mother of his child.
-   In John Steinbeck's _East of Eden_, the character Cathy tricks boys into tying her up and fooling around with her at the age of **10**, only to practice her ability to manipulate people. This is only the first in a long life of shocking deeds...
-   Felicity Worthington in the _Gemma Doyle_ trilogy qualifies as a deconstruction, as she actually _is_ a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of her pedophiliac father.
-   Diana Ladris from _Gone_ starts the series at fourteen as a Manipulative Bitch with no qualms about using her appearance to get what she wants, which usually works. In the fourth book, when she's either 14 or 15, she tries to convince Caine to follow her plans by sleeping with him. It doesn't work and has consequences. Somewhat justified, though, in that she's really not that young for the setting.
-   _Great Expectations_: This is Miss Havisham's goal for Estella.
-   Adèle in _Jane Eyre_ is a sort of G-rated nineteenth-century version of this, taking after her mother, who was an opera dancer, by being obsessed with looking good and proto-flirting.
-   _Journey Under The Midnight Sun_ has Yukiho Karasawa, who since a child use her charm to climb up the social ladder and commit several crimes.
-   In the Joan Rivers book _"The Life and Hard Times of Heidi Abromowitz"_, the titular character is a really ribald one... _right out of the womb!_ In the book, the authoress said that Heidi blew in the delivery doctor's ear!
-   _Lives of the Mayfair Witches_ trilogy: When we first meet 13-year old Mona Mayfair, she has already seduced her way through a number of her male cousins and proceeds to seduce the thirty-something male protagonist. She later falls for a _much_ older man, namely, a vampire.
    
    **Mona**: I didn't _lose_ my virginity. I _obliterated all traces of its existence_.
    
-   Dolores (Lolita) in _Lolita_ is portrayed this way by Humbert Humbert, the pedophile Unreliable Narrator. Is possibly the Trope Codifier.
-   In _The Lunar Chronicles,_ this is part of Levana's backstory. As a teenager, she had a Precocious Crush on Evret, a palace guard about ten years older than her. Levana is a Troubled Teen, a princess, _and has Mind Control powers._ It ends badly for everyone, and sets Levana up as the Wicked Stepmother that she is in the main books.
    -   Levana's sister, Channary, is also noted for having lots of trysts at a young age, which is apparently pretty common on Luna. However, she mocks the idea of love and sees Mind Control as "cheating," contrasted with Levana's desperate pursuit of Evret alone.
-   Late teenager Allriane Cett of _Mistborn: The Original Trilogy_ is accustomed to manipulating everyone around her, including her own father. She is currently in a relationship with 30+year-old Breeze, and Word of God explicitly states that _she_ seduced _him_, not the other way around.
-   The main characters in Roger "Rosalind Erskine" Longrigg's _The Passion Flower Hotel_, although they stick to boys their own age.
-   Amma Crellin (aged 13) from Gillian Flynn's _Sharp Objects_.
-   In the Andrew Vachss Burke book _Terminal_, the murder victim, Melissa Turnbridge, is described as someone confident in and abusive of sexual power.
-   Helen of _Twig_, an Artificial Human who adopts whatever roles she needs to fill at the moment as a Master Actor, usually looks like a 12-year-old girl and hangs out with her fellow children. It should also be noted that she experiences romantic desire as the desire to kill.
-   Paparazzi of the Whateley Universe, who is already a supervillainess while still in high school. Granted, it's Whateley Academy, but still...
    -   Solange (Tansy Walcutt) probably counts as well, since she's been using her feminine wiles and good looks to seduce and humiliate guys since she was 14.
    -   Vamp deliberately cultivates this image. When Alex first manifested, she'd ended up on the street, and when not hunting down information on the school principal who had set her up (and later during the time she was being blackmailed into joining a team of supervillains) she used her Charm Person and minor Shapeshifting talents to pretend to be a twenty-something debutante turned paid escort; none of them ever connected 'Abby Carfax' with either the supervillaness Vamp or the missing teenaged boy Alex O'Brien. She later insisted that she only made her clients _think_ she had sex with them, though she still plays the sexy vampire angle when she thinks she can get something from one of the other students that way.
    -   One of Sahar's main knacks is the ability to copy _other_ people's Psychic Powers through, ah, intimate association with them. Having lived as a street orphan in Beirut, she was used to seeing other people as either threats or targets, and set about seducing as many of the other Psychic Arts students, male and female, as she could. She only stopped when she fell in love with Zenith and had a Heel Realization about how much she was hurting her targets.
-   Most of the older sisters—Fanny Casteel, Vera Claythorn—in the average _V. C. Andrews_ novel fall into this category, displaying highly sexualized behavior at a very young age. Sadly, no one ever considers the possibility that they might be victims of abuse.
-   In _Wise Blood_, Hazel Motes briefly tries to seduce Sabbath Lily Hawks, the 15-year-old daughter of an itinerant preacher (mostly because Hazel wants to horrify the preacher). As it turns out, Sabbath is even more interested in seducing Hazel.
-   _X-Wing Series_: While just 16, Tavira seduced a Moff and then took his position later after usurping him, then murdering him (she'd also murdered his wife to clear her path).

    Live-Action TV 

-   One of the major plot points of _Californication_ is Hank sleeping with his ex-wife's soon-to-be daughter-in-law. She blackmails him for attention through the series.
-   In _Copper_ child prostitute Annie. Although she has a major league Freudian Excuse, having been forced into marriage at the age of 10, to a man who treated her so badly that life in a brothel seemed preferable plus the pressures of survival on the streets of the Five Corners district of New York in the 1860s.
-   Rosie Webster in _Coronation Street_ technically was over sixteen by the time she started displaying this behaviour, and therefore not one by UK law, but she still went after much older men. First she had Precocious Crushes on her bosses Liam and Tony and then, having previously dropped out of school, she re-enrolled so she could seduce teacher John Stape. As she entered her twenties, this side of her levelled off, and she was presented as more of a Brainless Beauty.
-   One of the killer's victims in the _Criminal Minds_ episode "52 Pickup" is depicted as one of these in a flashback sequence.
-   _CSI_: The principal villain in "Coming of Rage" is a high school girl who manipulates three of her fellow students into brutally murdering a fourth, while she stands by cheering them on.
-   _Fate: The Winx Saga_ has Beatrix, who's a scheming manipulator that even seduces two boys into a polyamorous relationship with her to achieve her goals. She's also manipulating a faculty member, albeit in a non sexual way, to accomplish her evil plan. In Season 2, the fatale part is lessened, as she becomes more of a Wild Card who occasionally helps the protagonists.
-   Marie Minshull in _Footballers Wives_.
-   Sansa Stark seems to be trying her hand at this in the fourth season of _Game of Thrones_, telling Littlefinger (who'd been bragging that his enemies are in the dark about his true motives), "_I_ know what you want" and dressing in a more flattering and provocative manner. A rare sympathetic example, given her precarious situation and lack of options.
-   Silver St. Cloud in _Gotham_, who is tasked by her uncle Theo to seduce Bruce Wayne.
    -   In season three, Ivy Pepper is artificially aged and uses her newfound beauty to seduce rich men into giving her food, clothes, and riches. Downplayed as she is played by adult actresses after the age-up and she doesn't have to do much for men to do her bidding.
-   Ruby Buttons (Anna Shaffer) in _Hollyoaks_.
-   One of the patients in _House_ seduced her father because she knew that the threat of revealing that he had committed statutory rape with his own daughter would give her power.
-   Lucy Archer in _The Lakes_.
-   Kelly Bundy was well-known for this on _Married... with Children_. Various jokes referred to her dating all her male high school teachers, being a Serial Homewrecker, juggling multiple boyfriends at once and using Distracted by the Sexy for various purposes.
-   Jane Harper from _Night and Day_, as revealed through the flashbacks and visions of some of those she leaves behind when she disappears. Not that this remotely justifies some of them sleeping with her when she was underage. It's subverted in that sense, in that we learn as the story progresses how bad experiences with men made Jane the way she was, and that she wasn't always that way. Meanwhile, her personality as seen in visions etc probably says more about the characters imagining her than Jane herself.
-   _Pretty Little Liars_ has teenage girls seducing grown men—though as these teenagers are played by 20-something year old women, the effect is somewhat muted.
    -   Alison DiLaurentis was only 14 or 15 when she seduced Ian. (Though this is an Age Lift from the book, when she was only _12_.) Among the other older men she had seduced are detective Holbrooke and Ezra. Deliberately played with Emily's crush on her.
    -   Spencer is a more downplayed take on this trope—she not only hooks up with both of her big sister's fiancés, she is also flirty with her older sobriety sponsor and tries to get back on the Academic Decathelon team via strip trivia. Melissa lampshades it, and the actress herself refers to Spencer's "aggressive" sexuality in several interviews.
    -   Jenna Marshall seduces officer Garret in order to protect herself from Allison, A, and just about anyone.
-   Karen Jackson in both the British and American versions of _Shameless_.
-   Parker McKenna in _Six Feet Under_.
-   _Skins_: Effy. Slightly scandalous, as the actress really _was_ 14 at the time of filming—no Dawson Casting there!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Sugar in the first season of _Sugar Rush_, when she is 15 years old. By the time of the second season, she is 17-18, so the trope no longer applies by that point.
-   _Total Recall 2070_: A runaway teenage girl becomes involved with a Virtual Reality bootlegger of sexual scenarios. The two cops put her up in android Farve's apartment for her safety, but she later tries to come on to him.
-   _Twin Peaks_
    -   Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) is particularly infamous for the Double Entendres that she aimed at almost every male she encountered in the series, and especially for the scene where she tied a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue—but just like Mena Suvari in _American Beauty_, it's all an act.
    -   Except for her showing up naked in Agent Dale Cooper's bed.
-   _7 Yüz_: In "Büyük Günahlar", fifteen-year-old Elif plays the part of fille fatale, enticing Aytaç into phone sex and thus ensnaring him in Mete's revenge scheme.
-   Ingrid in _Young Dracula_.

    Music 

-   The ABBA song "Does Your Mother Know?" is about a man turning one down.
-   The Boomtown Rats' "Mary of the 4th Form" is an analysis of the trope.
-   The speaker's ex in the Hip-Hop song "Slow Down" by Brand Nubian was this in her youth: "She was doin' lays before she started bleedin'."
-   Lana Del Rey's "Lolita" (arguably) uses this trope in full. While it's not outright stated if the singer is young, it can be implied from the title.
-   The Dresden Dolls have fun with this trope in the song "Missed Me."
-   The dancehall song "Can't Satisfy Her" by I Wayne is about a prostitute who has been "strip dancing since she was just 11".
-   Jethro Tull's "Cross Eyed Mary" is a school girl who "gets no kicks from little boys/Would rather make it with a leching grey"
-   The titular character of the KISS song _Domino_.
-   The song "Rock Queen" by Love/Hate is about an extremely promiscuous 13-year-old girl.
-   The Police's "Don't Stand So Close to Me" uses this trope and even references Nabokov's "Lolita" in the line "Just like the old man in that book by Nabokov."
-   Elvis Presley's song "Little Sister" is about a guy who has the grown-up younger sister of his Femme Fatale ex-girlfriend make passes at him.
-   "Beneath the perfumes and makeup, you've kept the secret of your youth. You've led me to believe you're old enough to give me love, and now it hurts to know the truth. Woah-oh-oh, young girl! Get out of my mind!" (Gary Puckett & Union Gap—Young Girl).

    Professional Wrestling 

-   _GLOW_ had a character called Jailbait who never actually appeared on screen beyond a rap used in a reunion PPV. House show footage of her does exist, and she actually plays a Good Bad Girl as opposed to an outright Heel.

    Theatre 

-   Deconstructed and Played for Drama in _Six: The Musical_ with Katherine Howard who is often remembered by the general public as a tramp who wasn't too bright. Except, as the show points out (along with several historians), she was _fifteen_ when she married Henry (who was at this point well into middle age), and she allegedly lost her virginity to a twenty-three-year-old teacher when she was thirteen. Katherine's big song, "All You Wanna Do," is all about her various affairs with men who only wanted her for sex, and how she enjoyed it at first, simply because she didn't _know_ any better. Every time, she tells herself, "this guy is different," but, as she slowly realizes, they never are. By the time she marries Henry, she really just wants a friend, and seems to find one in Thomas Culpeper. When she realizes he wants to sleep with her, too, she's crushed.
-   Ilse Neumann from _Spring Awakening_ has shades of this, though played for tragedy, in the scene preceding Moritz's suicide. After returning from the artists' colony and failing to reach out to Moritz, she resorts to unsuccessfully attempting to seduce him. Due to Ilse's childhood sexual abuse both by her father and the members of the artists' colony she ran away to in an attempt to escape him, it's implied that she believes the only way she can connect with people is by having sex with them.

    Video Games 

-   Misha of _Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia_ seems like one, but her true self is an adult and she's able to switch between her young and adult forms. She adopts a younger form through most of the game for various reasons, one of them being that she believed Lyner preferred her that way.
-   Lola Lombardi from _Bully_ fits this one. She's pretty overtly sexual and uses it to con money, gifts, grades, and whatever else she wants from the male students.
-   _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_: Monaca Towa uses Nagisa Shingetsu's crush on her to get him to do what she wants, and in one particular scene, she goes as far as to forcibly kiss him and rather distressingly indicates she'll grant Nagisa sexual favors if he pleases her.
-   Remilia Scarlet from _Touhou Project_ is sometimes portrayed as such by the fandom, with Sakuya usually being the object of her desire. She's a vampire who looks like a young child which can be Squick.

    Visual Novels 

-   Illyasviel von Einzbern in _Fate/stay night_ very much enjoys watching Shiro squirm when she puts the moves on him in the anime series. Also an Enfant Terrible and a Tyke-Bomb. It turns out that she's actually biologically _older_ than the person she tries to seduce, and only looks like a young child. Even after that, she doesn't have her own H-scene; in the Tiger Dôjô, we're told that she was going to have an H-scene in that gorgeous bed, but her route was dropped in favor of expanding the Heaven's Feel route.
    -   Chloe from the spin-off _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA_ is a magical clone containing Illya's repressed memories and abilities as the Holy Grail, and is represented as such by her having the personality of _Fate/stay night's_ Illya in the Prisma Illya universe. As such she is just as precocious as her Visual Novel counterpart, but actually _is_ as young as she looks, with all the Squick it entails. Thankfully her antics are Played for Laughs since _PRISMA☆ILLYA_ is a Lighter and Softer entry in the _Fate_ series, but some scenes have gotten the spin-off banned in other countries as child pornography (while Chloe is not the sole offender, she's easily the biggest).
-   Dahlia Hawthorne from _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_ seduced a childlike man at the age of 14 and forced him to make a suicide pact for her. It's her Moral Event Horizon moment. To make things worse, she has plenty more where that came from, and the Ephebophile she dated (and who may or may not be mentally challenged) looks _far_ more sympathetic than her as he kills himself in court.

    Webcomics 

    Western Animation 

-   In _Animaniacs_, Dot Warner appears petite and adolescent and often flirts with other characters, including occasional deliberate double entendres and upskirt shots. Watching the program again as an adult can turn out to be extremely uncomfortable, although her actual age is not established (if the characters were born in the 1930s, they're Really 700 Years Old).
-   _Archer_ episode Swiss Miss, the underage rich guy's daughter ISIS is trying to protect. She tries to seduce Archer, and given his Extreme Omnisexual reputation he has a hard time convincing his colleagues that Even He Has Standards. As the show spoofs spy movies, she may have been inspired by Bibi (Lynn-Holly Johnson) from _For Your Eyes Only_.
-   Lolita and Tanqueray from _Beavis and Butt-Head_ use their sex appeal to manipulate the titular duo in no less than three episodes.
-   With assistance from Ms. Bellum, _The Powerpuff Girls_ employ this to defeat and destroy the Rowdyruff Boys.
-   Jessica Lovejoy from _The Simpsons_. Amongst boys smitten by her, she falls right into the role of femme fatale, and isn't afraid to use it.
-   In _South Park_'s 19th season, the Big Bad, Leslie, is able to charm both Jimmy and Kyle into helping her, all while seeming like an innocent victim. As a sapient advertisement, she's really good at manipulating people.
