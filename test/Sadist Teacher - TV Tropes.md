Never trust The Trunchbull on dealing with bullies. She will bully _you_ instead. **Seriously...**

_"We had a teacher who was so strict, you weren't allowed to breathe in her lessons."_

— **Michael Rosen** reciting the beginning of his poem "Strict".

So you're attending the Sucky School. There's the bus driver who puts the kids in danger by deciding to recreate his favourite scenes from _Speed_ on the highway, the dinner lady who attacks you with their disgusting meal, the school bully who spends his breaks stuffing you into lockers and trying to flush you down the toilet, and the popular kids are looking for ones that are also considered popular and would exclude you because they hate you. And then there's _these_ teachers...

The teacher who bullies you for their own amusement (and your humiliation). The one who openly mocks you in front of the rest of the class. The one who won't let you go to the bathroom, no matter how desperate you are. The one who tells you they _want_ you to fail because they hate you and you don't _deserve_ to move up, then gives you F-- grades. If you're not paying enough attention in class, beware of flying objects. If they teach gym you'll likely end up getting dodgeballs in the face every day (if you're lucky). In short, they are the education system's answer to the Drill Sergeant Nasty—or worse. And even when they're not picking on you themselves, they are often perfectly happy to look the other way when the Barbaric Bully is doing so. (They might even occasionally employ the latter as their enforcer.)

Sometimes they're a Child Hater in general. Other times it's just one particular child who becomes the target of their rancor. Either way, they are as cruel as they can possibly be within the confines of their job. Worse, because they're a _teacher_, anyone seeking justice for their sadistic behavior is likely to be completely ignored.

They also tend to be the ones who are the most suspicious of the Ordinary High-School Student with a Secret Identity, and determined to uncover the Masquerade. Worse, maybe they _have_ uncovered it, and now the student has to keep them from exposing them on top of everything else.

Principals, guidance counselors, and coaches are no exceptions to this trope. Sadly, many students will escape these at graduation only to subsequently run into their classier but similarly cruel college equivalent, Dean Bitterman.

All too often this is a case of Truth in Television. Sometimes this trope will be inspired by the creator's own personal experiences, but many examples will portray levels of abuse that would get any actual teacher fired and/or arrested on the spot. Values Dissonance applies, as these techniques are often still considered appropriate in some countries, and even stateside these teachers will have defenders among more conservative parents and administrators.

See Stern Teacher for their more reasonable counterpart. May overlap with Evil Teacher, or Sinister Minister in a parochial school. Pick on Someone Your Own Size comes in any time one of these sees a child or teenager as their personal enemy. Commonly found in a Boarding School of Horrors. Their favorite target is the Teacher's Unfavorite Student. Contrast with Apathetic Teacher, Hippie Teacher, Cool Teacher, Misplaced Kindergarten Teacher, and Badass Teacher. May become the Tormented Teacher.

-   In this Hershey's commercial, a class of 2nd graders bid farewell to their kind-hearted teacher for the summer, only to wind up with a menacing replacement when they reach 3rd grade.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Aokana: Four Rhythm Across the Blue_'s Kagami-sensei's cruelty is legendary. However, this is largely an Informed Attribute since virtually every time she's seen, it's with concern for helping her student Hinata to recover from his childhood trauma. She _is_ the student counselor, after all.
-   Akira Takaoka in _Assassination Classroom_ initially sets himself as a self-titled Team Dad, but in reality he's a Drill Sergeant Nasty to a class of ninth graders. Even the principal (who has his own issues) decides Takaoka's not worth keeping around with his attitude and gives him his pink slip after a day.
-   Yukari from _Azumanga Daioh_ with disturbing frequency abuses her students for such things as "going on vacation with his parents" or being shorter than the rest of the students.
-   The school staff from _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_ seems to be universally mean and strict if not just lazy. They fail Himeji on her placement exam despite the fact that she was having a **medical emergency.** They blatantly insult the students of Class F, calling them idiots to their faces. No one ever seems to break it up whenever Minami beats the ever-loving crap out of Akihisa. How these people became educators is anyone's guess. Surprisingly, Mr. Nishimura (who is _definitely_ one of these when he takes the students away for remedial lessons) is a Reasonable Authority Figure as well.
-   Taken to its literal extremes in the different teachers for the book, manga, and film versions of _Battle Royale_.
    -   In the manga version at least, the "teacher", who is also the host of "the Program", shoots one student twice when he raises a furor over the fact that said teacher raped his caretaker, then sinks a knife into another student's head for talking. In all three versions, when some of the students are about to escape the island, they make a point of finding and killing the "teacher".
    -   In the manga, there's an interlude during the Sugimura/Kotohiki section that talks about Jaguar, a gym teacher they had. Jaguar was a jerk, challenging the students to martial arts duels and humiliating and/or hurting them when they wouldn't fight back. He eventually challenged Kiriyama, who plucked out and squished his eye.
-   Subverted in Osamu Tezuka's _Black Jack_. A sadistic Maths teacher terrorizes his "weakest" student to the point of traumatizing him but is actually a good person at heart who only wants to toughen the kiddo up. The boy almost dies in a street accident that he got in because he was too distraught by his phobia of the teacher to look before crossing the streets, and the man feels so guilty when he finds out that he attempts to kill himself and give the money of his health insurance to the kid's mother so Dr. Black Jack can operate on the boy. In the end, Black Jack saves both of them.

-   _Captain Harlock_: To punish Mayu for being associated with Harlock, the Dorm Matron of St. Giovanna's school has her mop all the floors of the school (with the implication that if Mayu calls Harlock to earth, she'll be free of her punishment). When Mayu doesn't give up, she has the other kids deliberately dirty her clean floors. When Mayu still doesn't give up, she becomes angrier and tries harder to break her. She threatens Mayu with punishment many times, but they all end in futility.

-   A filler episode prior to Future Trunks's appearance of _Dragon Ball Z_ had Chi-Chi hire a private tutor for Gohan named Mr. Shu, who at first admits to being quite strict... but as soon as Chi-Chi is out of the room, shows his true colors as a sadistic asshole by hitting Gohan with a whip at the slightest mistake to "discipline" him and openly and relentlessly insulting Goku, dismissing him as a "brainless brute" and a deadbeat parent. When Gohan stands up to him and damages his whip in the process, Mr. Shu quickly calls in Chi-Chi and makes Gohan seem like the bad guy... before declaring that Goku's abandonment drove Gohan to such violence and proceeding to whip Gohan across the face hard enough to draw blood right in front of Chi-Chi. Chi-Chi promptly goes Mama Bear on his ass, throwing him out the window and chasing him off of their property all while screaming at him never to come back.
-   _The Dreaming_'s Avril Merriweather, the first headmistress of Greenwich Private College, punishes her students by locking them in cupboards and coffins.
-   Turns out Yasuhiro-sensei in _ERASED_ is secretly a sadistic serial killer who preys on young kids.
-   _Full Metal Panic!_:
    -   Played for laughs with the gym teacher. He genuinely hates Sōsuke, but Sōsuke just sees him as a respectable Drill Sergeant Nasty. Whenever the teacher goes on a tirade against him, Sōsuke treats him like an officer, which he considers back-talk. When the gym teacher attempts to sabotage the students' bread sales, he runs afoul of Sōsuke's traps and gets sent to the hospital — but Sōsuke mistakenly interprets his symptoms as overwork and mentally wishes the teacher a speedy recovery.
    -   And Sōsuke's assumption that such sadistic malice is _normal_ for a teacher makes _him_ one as well. Just look at the way he trained the school's gentle, girly rugby team. Well, you can't say it didn't work...
    -   Considering that Sōsuke obtained his training techniques from Melissa Mao, and her "How to Abuse a Training Recruit" manual, one must qualify Mao as one as well.
-   Gunjou-sensei from _Gals!_, an unrepentant Social Darwinist at heart, forced his class to bully the girl whom he blamed for their loss at the sports festival. When Ran confronted him about this, he _punched_ her. Protip: don't punch the student who punches back _even harder_.
-   _GTO: The Early Years_: Yoko Minamino is a hardass teacher who Tsujido hired to reform Class 1-F, the problem students. His methods include beating his students with his bare hands (he's a 5th dan karateka) or with a _shinai_ and making them swim in a cold outdoor pool (with clothes on) in April. It's likely that he influenced Eikichi on what _not_ to do when he became a teacher himself in _Great Teacher Onizuka_. And then, just when it seems like he can't get any worse, we find out he's a lolicon.
-   In one _Ghost Hunt_ arc, Hideaki Matsuyama was so obsessed with his students applying themselves academically, he would destroy his student's _personal belongings_ for not being related to classwork. He actually drove one student to suicide - but not before the student created a ritual curse intended to kill his tormentor and tricked half the student body into continuing the ritual.
-   Several examples in _Gokusen_, all of which are fairly realistic and Played for Drama; you've got a teacher that purposefully isolated a student he didn't like for no reason, a teacher that refused to give one student an education because the student was delinquent-ish... and then you have a teacher who is _literally_ a sadist with a BDSM fetish and has a very disturbing obsession with one of the high school-aged protagonists...
-   _Hell Girl_ follows a group of supernatural beings who can be "hired" to send one person bodily to Hell, at the cost of the contractors' soul upon death. Sadist Teachers are some of their more frequent victims, ranging from a literal sadist who felt sexual pleasure from humiliating one of her female students, to an extremely strict teacher who kept a notebook full of details about the students' misbehavior (which, it turns out, was actually blank).
-   _Kanon_: Kuze, president of the student council, is introduced to ridicule Yuichi at the school ball, before issuing Mai a harsh warning about the trouble she had been causing for the school. He is all too eager to expel her when a demon attacks, even though she didn't actually destroy anything herself, is not any nicer to those debating things with him, and even threatens Mai's friend Sayuri if anything ever happens again after Yuichi and Kitagawa just barely talk him out of following through.
-   _Kekko Kamen_: Most teachers at Sparta Academy, while extremely qualified in their subjects, take delight in tormenting the students, with the first chapter having one promising torture to anyone who'd get less than 90 in a surprise test-and then going through with it. This caused the school (supposedly the best in Japan) to either have the students commit suicide...or worse actually _murder_ them and make it look like a suicide, prompting the arrival of Kekko Kamen to protect the kids and investigate the school for the police and the Ministry of Instruction, who have started wondering why the best high school in Japan has such a high student suicide rate, leading to the school eventually being shut down.
-   _Kirby: Right Back at Ya!_: King Dedede sets up a school where the teachers are required to wear this hat while teaching. Their lessons included math (throwing students across rooms for wrong answers), science (splitting plutonium!), and so on... And the producer is embarrassed.
-   In _Kodocha_, Sengoku-sensei has an almost obsessive hatred of Akito, going to great lengths to make the kid miserable, even hit him once. Turns out it's because Akito reminds him of the kids who used to bully him when he was younger.
-   _My Hero Academia_: Shota Aizawa, a.k.a. "Eraserhead", has developed an In-Universe reputation as one of these because he not only has absolutely no tolerance for fools in his class, he also goes way out of his way to steadfastly crush his students' belief that hero business is a cool thing and bore them into being pseudo-zombies with his relentless pessimism. One major factor in his reputation is the fact that he has a special dispensation to expel students all by himself, which he has already used once to kick out an entire class _on the very first day of school_ . because he found them too cavalier (a hundred chapters later we discover that he re-enrolled them all the day after in a "logical ruse" to Scare 'Em Straight, although the expelling remained in The Permanent Record all the same - one of the students of that class even walks up to Aizawa and _thanks_ him for it) and he is not afraid to keep bringing it up to force Class 1-A to behave. He actually is kind of a zigzag though as he does genuinely care for his students and has fought nearly to the death to keep them safe. He just wants to make sure they realize how hard their path will be and maybe keep them from dying like his late friend did.
-   Miss Minchin from _Princess Sarah_ makes her novel counterpart look positively benign. Not only is she greedy and unjust, but she resents the slightest threat to her inflated self-esteem, and has serious anger management issues.
-   Being a deconstruction of the Fighting Series Played for Laughs, _Ramen Fighter Miki_ has Kayahara Sensei: she tries to be a Save Our Students teacher, and she is a Bully Hunter, always trying to stop any abuse. Unfortunately, she is always depressed (maybe because she cannot admit to herself that she doesn’t enjoy teaching) and for that, is always being taken as a Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl, all her students are very afraid of her.
-   _Soul Eater_: Franken Stein will beat up students for the purposes of training, throw scalpels at them, and speculate on experimenting upon one girl after pointing out his previous test subject was her father, _and also his former Weapon_. His sadistic tendencies are usually played for laughs, but in serious moments including his introduction, are genuinely creepy. And it's not _too_ difficult to imagine him making good on any of his "dissection" threats. With that description, it's worth pointing out that Stein is a decent guy, who seems to genuinely care about his students. Well, okay, a guy who makes an effort to be decent because his less-than-decent compulsions scare even him.
-   _The Unforgiving Flowers Blossom in the Dead of Night_: In the first manga story, Yoshihito Kanamori, the teacher who initially defended protagonist Marie Moriya against her cruel classmates, has taken to sexually molesting her during their "supplementary lessons" to relieve the stress of the job. Between his abuse and the abuse that she still has to deal with from her classmates, it's little wonder that poor Marie wants to become a youkai.
-   _Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun_ has Kalego Naberius, the homeroom teacher for protagonist Iruma's class, who provides an interesting mix of Sadist Teacher, Stern Teacher, and Reasonable Authority Figure. He makes it very blatant that he takes every available opportunity to make life miserable for his class, but in regards to his actual teaching he's very strict but fair, never letting his biases and sadistic desires get in the way of having the students genuinely keep improving as both students and people, even if it means degrading himself in order to ensure he follows his own standards, utterly refusing any possibility of acting like a hypocrite.
-   Played with on _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ with Professor Chronos. In addition to being as biased as Snape to the students in his dorm, Chronos has a personal grudge against Judai for publicly defeating him in a duel and thus devoted Season 1 to trying to get Judai kicked out of school. However, Chronos has had his moments that prove deep down, he really cares about his students. He also manages to combine a Heroic Sacrifice with a Rousing Speech to raise his students' morale, just before getting beaten by one of the Seven Stars Assassins.

-   The first 7 volumes of the original _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ have: a Vamp who dates men and breaks their hearts for the hell of it, a sadistic guidance counselor who regularly mocks the lower-scoring students and tried to stomp on Anzu/Téa's electronic keychain, and a gym teacher who bullies Bakura because of his hairstyle. All three found themselves on the receiving end of karma in the end, though (the Vamp had her makeup peeled off, revealing how ugly she really was to the whole class; the counselor was revealed to be bald and wearing a toupee; the gym teacher got turned into an RPG figurine by Dark Bakura).
-   And The Vamp, Chono, likes ordering desk inspections so that she can catch students with contraband and have them expelled. She does this with the puzzle love letter Honda made for Miho, but Dark Yugi gives her the Shadow Game as soon as she completes the puzzle to determine whether Yugi, Jounouchi or Honda had given it to Miho, as all three claimed responsibility.
    -   Though the gym teacher got turned back once Dark Yugi beat Dark Bakura, and goes back to being his old Jerkass self.
-   Chronos/Crowler shows some sadistic tendencies in the GX manga, like when he forced Judai and Sho to duel each other after Sho got a zero on a test (which wasn't even his actual grade, as it was a preliminary form, and the zero was a formality since he'd forgotten to write his name), and Judai had failed every test since entering. If Judai won, Sho would have been expelled, but if Sho won, Judai's deck, which he got from world champion Koyo Hibiki, would have been confiscated. Judai wins and Midori comes to resolve the misunderstanding, but while she plans on informing the principal, apparently, nothing happens to Chronos.

-   Mr. Iwamoto and Mr. Akashi from _YuYu Hakusho_. The latter forces Kuwabara and his friends to swear off violence under threat of Okubo losing permission for his job, which he needs to provide for his family. When the students keep their end of the bargain, he forces them to score above 50% on the next test. When even Kuwabara succeeds, he alters his test score to provoke him to hit him and break the agreement, but he relents with Yusuke's help. Mr. Iwamoto takes items out of students' bags to frame Yusuke, and keeps one student's pen for himself. Mr. Akashi isn't seen after Takanaka catches him altering Kuwabara's test score, so his ass probably _was_ fired.
    -   When Yusuke dies in the first episode of the series, these two actually discuss how happy they are that they don't have to put up with him anymore. _At his funeral._
    -   Iwamoto's sadistic tendencies really come out when he's possessed by a Makai insect and tries to kill Keiko for simply being associated with Yusuke.
    -   Two other teachers in a manga-only arc did their utmost to set their prize pupils at each other's throats in a competition to see who in their school would be able to produce the one student who would go on to a prestigious high school. The fact that the girls in question had been friends before they did this didn't matter to them. In the end, the girls decided that their friendship was more important than the egos of all involved and selected a slightly less prestigious high school that they could both attend.

    Comic Books 

-   _Archie_'s teacher Miss Grundy did the same thing as Charlie Brown's teacher (see below) in December of 2013, assigning _The Brothers Karamazov_ over Christmas break.
-   In the story _Batman: Gothic_, it's shown that Bruce had one of these growing up, named Mr. Winchester, as if his childhood wasn't messed up enough already. to most people, he appeared to simply be an extremely mean-spirited sadistic brute, who was eventually fired for some sort of "scandal." Bruce reveals, however, that Mr. Winchester _murdered_ a boy there, and it's eventually found out that he is the villain of the story, and made a Deal with the Devil to live forever, and has done all sorts of atrocities over the years.
-   Teacher in _The Bash Street Kids_ is usually just stuck with an uncontrollable class (except for the pet). Well, one annual had him bring the kids (along with goody-two-shoes Walter, and Dennis the Menace and Minnie the Minx) on a field trip. Nice, right? Except it was a trip into space. After which, obviously with his approval, Walter and Cuthbert LAUNCH ALL THE TROUBLEMAKING KIDS INTO SPACE. Where they _realized that they would fly through space forever_. Sure, everything works out in the end, and the kids were a bunch of jerkasses, but he was essentially starving a bunch of kids to death. Beware the Nice Ones!
-   The British comic strip _Billy Bunter_ often featured Billy getting beaten by his sadist headmaster, even on those occasions where something wasn't his own fault.
-   _Chick Tracts_: In "Big Daddy?" a biology teacher **erupts** at a child for quietly stating he believes in creationism, and only lets him stay in class just so he can "tear his beliefs to shreds" in front of the class. Since it's a Jack Chick work, we see the kid tear his beliefs apart in front of the class and, of course, convert his classmates into Evangelism.
-   In _Diabolik_, Eva Kant had many when growing up at Morben, inflicting corporal punishment for any infraction and putting "unruly" students in dark cells with little food for days at a time. Said teachers now live in terror, because as an adult she's become the lover and accomplice of the title character, a thief and murderer rightly known as the King of Terror and the Murderer with a Thousand Faces and one day she may well decide to track them down. She did just that with the headmistress after realizing her best friend at Morben was murdered by her.
-   _Empowered_: Ninjette's father taught her; he's the head of her ninja clan and the most powerful. He's also a violent drunk.
-   James-Michael from _Omega the Unknown_ encounters this when he first arrives at his Inner City School, where the teacher is so flustered and mistrustful of children, he hits James-Michael before he even has a chance to introduce himself.
-   In the fourth volume of _The Sandman (1989)_, "Season of Mists", Lucifer closes down Hell, so all the damned are forced to wander other places in the universe, including Earth. One chapter focuses on a boy at a boarding school left there for the holidays when this happens. The students who died while at school and went to hell are all resurrected, as is an old headmaster who proceeds to openly torture and torment the student body using old-school punishments. He is _literally_ a teacher from hell.
-   In _Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures in the 8th Grade_, Linda Lee's teachers appear to delight in making her life Hell, mocking her and putting her down the whole time. They are in fact Mr. Mxyzptlk and other imps from the Fifth Dimension. Most of them seem to think their “pranks” are funny, but Mxy deliberately wants to make Supergirl miserable.
-   _St. Trinians_: In this series of drawn cartoons by Ronald Searle the pupils of a local girls' school are all shown to be juvenile delinquents who are frequently seen murdering and torturing their fellow students, while also being mistreated by their teachers too, by being hung by their wrists in cellars for instance.
-   In _Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes_ story arc, rejected Legion applicant Eyeful Ethel later joined the Justice League of Earth as a teacher at their satellite headquarters, "reeducating" Earth children about Superman's supposed human origins. While Ethel does not physically abuse any of her students, she takes a great amount of pleasure knowing that they will believe everything she tells them simply because she's their teacher, including lies about how the Martian Manhunter was an alien invader and that the Legion of Super-Heroes were alien terrorists. While not the most violent or powerful, Ethel's by far the worst member of the League due to the sadistic pleasure she takes in exploiting impressionable young children.
-   _Urbanus_: Meester Kweepeer is a sadist teacher, though this could also be the result of Urbanus' bad behaviour. He beats the pupils up, gives them impossible to answer exam questions, orders them to strip naked so that they are unable to cheat during a test, takes credit for stuff they discovered, and makes everybody repeat the same grade each year.
-   _Ultimate Spider-Man_: Before getting superpowers, Peter Parker sucked in the gym class. The teacher trolled and openly insulted him for his poor performances.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Surprisingly averted with the villain Byrna Brilyant. Despite being an unrepentant supervillain who goes on to be a founding member of Villainy Inc. she's never shown acting maliciously to her students and seems to have been a good teacher before her criminal activity was discovered and got her fired.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Calvin and Hobbes_: Miss Wormwood is an interesting take on this trope. Calvin (being the type of kid that he is) believes his behavior is justified, even appropriate, so when she doles out completely reasonable punishments, it appears to him that she is a sadist. In reality, it's a combination of her being both the worst possible teacher for a student like Calvin, and Calvin being a Sadist Student.
-   In the Fort Collins _Collegian_, a comic strip featured a sadist professor. Aptly named the "PR Ofessor", the strip showed a professor (implied to be teaching chemistry) throughout a year at Colorado State University. Played for Laughs, since half the stuff would get a professor fired faster than you can say Trope Namer. Such antics included:
    -   Scheduling office hours at the same time as lectures
        -   Then misleading students about the physical location of his office with signs pointing to the other door.
    -   Apparently holding his teacher's assistants captive
    -   Miscalculating someone's grade by 20 points, then taking 20 points as a regrading fee
    -   And on the final, stapling the syllabus for the next class (taught by him) to the test and saying "Since most of you guys are going to fail anyways, I'm going to get a head-start!"
-   _FoxTrot_:
    -   In one week-long series, Paige's biology teacher Mr. Ting assigned 60 chapters of reading for a test the next day, thinking it would "alleviate the tension" of the torrential rainstorms they were having. This only got worse for Paige, even though you can't blame the rest on Ting; the storm caused a blackout that made the assignment an even greater nightmare. And the _worst_ part of it? While she managed to complete the reading assignment, Ting had no access to his computer due to the blackout, and wasn't able to hold the test. (Meaning she had done it for nothing. While it technically wasn't his fault either, he gave the assignment in the first place...)
    -   In another strip, he showed disappointment that Paige's lab reports were _improving_, claiming they were a source of entertainment for him.
    -   He seems a little more understanding in this strip, possibly because the cafeteria staff can be even _more_ sadistic at times.
    -   In another strip, Paige's unnamed math teacher handed out the test sheets for the final exams dressed in a Grim Reaper costume and collected next of kin information.
-   Chalky, the cadaverously evil teacher with an impressive collection of canes and a love of terrifying schoolchildren and other teachers, from the newspaper cartoons by Giles.
-   Some of the assignments that the teachers hand out to elementary school students in _Peanuts_ really make you stop and wonder. One instance included handing out a test that just says "Explain World War II." To say nothing of the books they assign for them to read in a very short period of time, like "Gulliver's Travels," "A Tale of Two Cities," "Anna Karenina," and "Tess of the d'Ubervilles." Some of these assignments would be daunting even for some college students, let alone elementary school students.
-   In _Zbeng!_, one of the main characters, is this trope taken to the absurd: a green dress-wearing monster named Anuga Zaafani. In her own personal book, it is even showed how she drove to extremes Peter Parker (drove him up the wall), Clark Kent (green dress... guess what material), Garfield the Cat (decided to take a vacation in Thailand), and her day schedule consists of waking up, falling asleep, and eleven cases of shouting in between. In the end, where everybody is supposed to have their graves shown — she is alive and well among everyone else's graves. Naturally, she'll bury them all.
-   Ms. Butcher from _Zits_. She supposedly writes Jeremy's grades in blood. To make things clear, one time Jeremy and his best friend Hector got the same score, a 94. Jeremy was still given a C- (and the aforementioned grade written in blood) and Hector got an A written in perfumed lilac ink.
-   In _Big Nate_, Nate likes to depict Mrs. Godfrey as this in his drawings and the way he talks about her. In truth, she's typically depicted as a fairly normal teacher in reality, albiet one that has very little patience for Nate's antics. Tellingly, no other characters seem to feel that way about her, and Francis and Ellen even view her rather fondly. The Nickelodeon series depicts her more in line with how Nate tends to view her in the comics.
-   _Sabrina at See-CAD_: The professional illustrator professor who claims he doesn't want to teach his students how to be _better_ than him because he views them as potential competition in the field. The liner notes point out the professor is a Take That! to a real teacher who was working at the Columbus College of Art & Design at the time the strip was published.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Bolt Chronicles_: In "The School," Penny runs afoul of an English teacher with a strange concept about the William Shakespeare play _Macbeth_. When she corrects him in class, she earns after-school detention.
-   It's clear by now that the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fandom loves the Ron the Death Eater trope. An infamous fic to take this trope is a surprising-not-_Cupcakes (Sergeant Sprinkles)_\-inspired fic entitled _Cheerilee's Garden_. In said fic, Cheerilee gets fed up with her class's behaviour, even questioning her Cutie Mark in the process. So, what does she do? Frackin' KILL them by, in this order, impaling them with spears, crushing them with a lead block, dissolving them in acid, setting them on fire, eaten alive by rats, impaled vampire-style with their own unicorn-horn, and drowned in their own friends blood. All of which masquerades as a school play. In the direct sequel called Scarlet Harvest, she does arguably _worse_ things to the mane 6 and Spike. It's safe to assume she can be considered this and in the sequel, she can also be considered a Villain with Good Publicity, even more so than this trope by itself implies. How good is the publicity she has? Twilight gets blamed for her murders.
-   _A Diplomatic Visit_: As noted in chapter 4 of the second sequel, _Diplomacy Through Schooling_, Trixie had one in her hometown, a Mrs. Hydia, mentioning that the thoroughly unpleasant Spoiled Rich reminds her of the teacher in question. This is one of the reasons she transferred to the School For Gifted Unicorns instead.
-   In _Discworld_ fanfiction set at the Assassins' Guild School, the Teacher-Assassins develop a canonical theme where pupils who have been slack, or lazy, or _over-confident_ (or who have simply annoyed the teacher) are sent out on humiliating tasks or painful assignments which are bound to fail. This is partly to instruct, educate and correct the pupil, and partly so the teaching staff can compare notes and have a jolly good laugh in the staffroom later. Assignments given by teachers have included Extra Elephants at the city zoo ("Wear old clothes. A shovel and a wheelbarrow will be provided."); being sent to the University to research supernatural entities, whose theoretical inhumation can win prizes (the unfortunate student involved ended up looking at the wrong entities, and became catatonic with terror); or merely being sent to deliver a message to Sam Vimes. A partial list of Sadist Teacher assignments might read:
    -   Miss Alice Band: fics such as _fresh Pair of Eyes_ develop her canonical tendency to send pupils on the dreaded Vimes Run;
    -   Doctor Davinia Bellamy _(Botany)_: pupils offending Davinia are assigned chores such as pruning the Pyramid Strangler Vines, vegetation that fights back;
    -   Doctor Smith-Rhodes _(Zoology and Natural History)_: Extra Elephants, as detailed above; or cleaning out the habitats of other lively and territorial animal species; or simply tending the needs of Acerian Skunks, who are friendly creatures who show appreciation to the kind human by spraying them.
    -   Miss Gillian Lansbury _(Art)_: Grinding pigments to make your own bespoke paints. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Miss Joan Sanderson-Reeves _(Domestic Science)_ Cleaning the ovens. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Miss Joyce Tanner _(Arts and Crafts)_ - will send an errant pupil out on Work Experience at the abbatoir or in the tanning yards, so they gain an appreciation of leatherworking at all stages from living beast to completed belt and scabbard.
-   Mr. Bleak in _Living The Dream_ will lock his students in the classroom and hit them if they ever break his Four rules. No talking, no eating (he will offer food and hit them if they accept), no leaving your seat, and to not touch his ruler (unless he is hitting them). On top of that, punishing his students gives him a sort of sexual glee.
-   Aizawa in _Mean Rabbit_, constantly singles out and punishes Izuku for anything he can think of. During the Quirk Assessment, he fudges the scores to expel Izuku and when Izuku refuses, Aizawa instead expels the five students who got worse scores, explicitly stating that "They don't deserve to be at UA if they can't beat one Quirkless kid". During the Battle Trial, Izuku breaks Bakugo's arms, due to Bakugo trying to murder him. Aizawa punishes both of them, insisting he doesn't care about Izuku's "little grudge" against Bakugo, despite acknowledging that Izuku had no way to defend against Bakugo's attack. Finally, when Izuku, Setsuna, and Tetsutetsu climb the fences to avoid the mob of reporters outside U.A., Aizawa gives them two weeks detention then bumps it up to six when they want to know why.
-   In _My Immortal_, every teacher except Trelawney and Professor Sinister are out to get Enoby and her posse (and half of them are perverts of some sort to boot). They're only ever shown yelling at Ebony for petty reasons, and otherwise don't contribute much to the plot.
-   In _New Chance_, Minato is this to Iruka. Iruka considers becoming a Jonin. Minato decides to be his teacher.
    
    **Minato:** _\[pointing at a food stand\]_ There!  
    **Iruka:** Dango will help me become a Jonin?  
    **Minato:** No. You see Mitarashi Anko there? (Iruka nods) Well go grope her.  
    **Iruka:** **WHAT**!?  
    **Minato:** Come on! If you can outrun or hide from her it means you're getting better.  
    **Iruka:** And if she catches me!?  
    **Minato:** _\[smiling\]_ You get to work on increasing your pain threshold.
    
-   In _The Official Fanfiction University Of Middle-earth_, Morgoth and Sauron delight in making the students suffer.
-   Being the asshole that he is, Snotlout in _Prodigal Son_ is prone to make stupid decision after stupid decision and give bad advice (like forgoing the handiness of a shield and sending minors to fend for themselves against dragons).
-   Professor Kaita in _Soldier of Zero_ is noted for using his wind magic to humiliate his students due to his belief wind is superior to every other element. Saito helps Guiche pay him back by convincing him not to launch a ranged attack, which Kaita would send back at him, but instead conjure a golem at his feet which drags the man to the ground.

-   Aldera's teachers in _Turning a New Leaf_ tend to fall into the same quirkist bullying as the students, Izuku's teacher telling him that "even a pathetic quirk like that is better than no quirk" after his quirk manifests. The school being a means of indoctrinating kids for the Meta-Liberation Army makes a lot of sense with this in mind.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: Professor Goldgrass is needlessly cruel towards Spectra, mocking her and penalizing her for tiny reasons and calling her to the front of the class for "practical demonstrations" that inevitably hurt or embarrass her. All of this stems from Spectra's parents having murdered her husband during their failed bank robbery.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Kung Fu Panda_: Shifu comes across this way to Po at first, putting him through a lot of butt-kicking and torture and calling it training, because he believes that Po is not worthy of the title of Dragon Warrior (a position to which Grand Master Oogway himself appointed Po). Later, Shifu becomes more of a Stern Teacher and sincerely tries to teach Po the ways of kung fu, through much discipline and exercise.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Professor Terguson (played by Sam Kinison) in _Back to School_, harassing college students over the Vietnam War.
    
    **Prof. Terguson**: Is she right? 'Cause I know that's the _popular_ version of what went on there. And a lot of people like to believe that. I wish I could, but I was _there._ I wasn't here in a classroom, hoping I was right, thinking about it. I WAS UP TO MY KNEES IN RICE PADDIES, WITH GUNS THAT DIDN'T WORK! GOING IN THERE, LOOKING FOR CHARLIE, SLUGGING IT OUT WITH HIM, WHILE _PUSSIES_ LIKE YOU WERE BACK HERE PARTYING, PUTTING HEADBANDS ON, DOING DRUGS, AND LISTENING TO THE GODDAMN BEATLES ALBUMS! AAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
    
-   Elizabeth in _Bad Teacher_ when she decides to win the prize. She even hits her students with dodgeballs for wrong answers.
-   _Bloody Reunion_: The flashbacks reveal that Mrs Park was a sadist teacher who enjoyed tormenting and humiliating her students, supposedly to make them strive to improve themselves. However, the ending reveals that these 'flashbacks' are an invention of the killer, and that all of the bad things that Mrs Park is supposed to have done to the other students actually happened to her.
-   _Class (2021)_: The titular class is led by Adam (David Krumholtz) who frequently belittles his students and expects to be praised by them and has control over them.
-   _Deadtime Stories: Volume 2_: In "On Sabbath Hill", Professor Weaver is an arrogant and egomaniacal lecturer who does not allow absences from his classes. If a student misses one of his classes, he forces them to withdraw from his course to keep his perfect attendance record intact. This insistence on students attending his class no matter what will come back to haunt him in a very literal fashion.

-   _Freaky_: Mr. Bernardi, the wood shop teacher, loves to pick on Millie for no good reason.
-   In _Freaky Friday_, Anna Coleman had a mean teacher who always put her down in class even when she gave an intelligent answer. Her mother Tess didn't believe her until they get their bodies swapped... and suffers at his hands, only to recall that he is a guy she rejected back in the day.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   The cruelty of Alan Rickman's Snape may be a little toned down from the books but he's still an unrelenting bully towards students that aren't in his house and by _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ is Nevile's worst fear.
    -   Imelda Staunton's performance as Dolores Umbridge in _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_ is properly horrifying. She uses blood quills, which cause whatever is being written with them to be carved into the hand of the writer, in her detentions, makes up increasingly strict and petty rules, is unabashed about her prejudices, and nearly uses an unforgivable curse on Harry and Hermione.
    -   The Carrows may not get much screen time in _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ but the fact that they are sadists who are torturing students in detention and acting as Voldemort's enforcers at Hogwarts is still clearly communicated.
-   _Heaven Help Us_: Brother Constance appears to take some sick pleasure in the Corporal Punishment of misbehaving students.
-   _High School Musical_: Ms. Darbus is one of the best drama teachers so far (even if she gives Troy and Gabriella detention as it soon becomes a nightmare on East High).
-   _The Karate Kid Part III_: Terry Silver becomes Daniel's mentor all so that he can have him experience physical and emotional pain on behalf of Kreese. He even lampshades it in his monologging phone call to Kreese himself.
    
    **Terry:** When I'm finished with that kid, he'll be begging me to be his teacher! And you know what he's going to learn from me? Pain—in every part of his body, and fear in part of his mind! And here's the kicker, he's going to thank me for it.
    
-   _Kids in America_: The main plot of the film involves a group of high school students' goal to prevent their principal, Donna Weller, from becoming State Superintendent. Since she uses authoritarian methods to suppress the students’ right to free expression and firing a teacher for backing them up, the entire student body teams up to prevent students in other schools from meeting the same fate by telling the voters directly and getting the media involved.
-   The headmistress in _Mädchen in Uniform_, who doesn't hesitate to starve her students in order to teach them proper Prussian discipline. Her strict approach bites her in the rear when one of her students tries to commit suicide over the treatment received.
-   _Matilda_ has Ms. Trunchbull, the violent, dictator-like principal of the school that Matilda attends. Apart from having broken the arm of her stepniece, she _enjoys_ torturing children, be it defenestrating them from the third floor, hammer throwing them by their pigtails, putting them in a non-lethal iron maiden called the "Chokey", and even force-feeding them cakes laced with body fluids. She in fact loves it so much that she has taken the punishments further, just to be sure that the parents would never believe their child if one spilled the beans.
-   _Max Keeble's Big Move_: Elliot T. Jindrake, the Principal of the middle school.

-   Lt. Harris is a Sadist Police Instructor in the first _Police Academy_ specially towards Jerk with a Heart of Gold Mahoney who he forces to do things such as push-ups under the rain and run until he pukes and then run some more.
-   _Rhymes for Young Ghouls_: All of the staff at the school, but especially Popper.
-   _Suspiria_ (both versions) revolve around a prestigious ballet academy, where it's revealed that all the teachers are part of a coven of witches. Miss Tanner in particular seems to be especially stern, forcing Suzy to perform a dance when she's clearly ill (and the result is that she faints there in class). Considering the reason Suzy is sick in the first place is that the witches put a spell on her, this seems like a Kick the Dog moment.

-   Max's teacher in _Where the Wild Things Are_, who’s shown cheerfully explaining to a class of nine-year-olds how entropy reigns, the sun is dying, and everything is pretty much doomed in the end. An interesting example, as the sadism clearly isn’t intentional; the guy’s just doing his job and describing real aspects of astronomy, but he’s so oblivious that he doesn't seem to realize that _maybe_ subject matter like that isn’t appropriate for a class of elementary schoolers.
-   _Whiplash_: Terence Fletcher is a disgustingly callous perfectionist who hurls bile at his students to push them past their limits. His methods work, but the mental scars they leave make it questionable if the skill is worth it. Some of the things that Fletcher has done to his students include racist and antisemitic comments aimed at his students, hurling chairs at them for being out of tempo, and forcing them to play until their hands are raw with pain. The competition between band members is so bad that any mistake could cost someone their hard-earned position, to the point one of them forced themselves to play drums while barely out of a car accident. Another former student suffered so much from the abuse that they killed themselves. When Andrew's father finds out about the abuse, he gets Fletcher fired.

    Jokes 

-   A Latin teacher tells his colleagues: "I had a wonderful dream tonight: I gave Cicero an F in Latin."
-   A professor of anatomy searches his class for a victim and selects a young woman (who he knows is only there for her MRS Degree) for interrogation.
    
    "Young lady, can you tell us which part of the human body can expand until it reaches a size eight times larger than its most contracted state?"  
    The student blushes.  
    "Here's a hint: it ends in _\-is_."  
    The student hems and haws and finally admits that she knows what it is but doesn't want to say it out loud.  
    "Indeed? Then here are three things you should know: First, the word I was looking is "iris". Second, you have a dirty mind. Third... you are going to be so _very_ disappointed on your wedding night."
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   Back in 1986, Christopher Lloyd had a field day playing the gleefully sadistic Professor B.O. Beanes in "Go to the Head of the Class", a memorable, hour-long episode of Steven Spielberg's _Amazing Stories_. One fan's excellent review, available here, goes into loving detail and includes numerous clips that _must_ be seen. _Especially_ the clip wherein hapless high school student Peter Brand is forced to _"meet the Misters!!"_
-   _A.N.T. Farm_: Principal Skidmore, who uses the eponymous A.N.T. Farm as a sweat shop. On one occasion, she herself admitted that the entire purpose of the A.N.T. Farm is so she can exploit the students' talents for her own use.

-   _Bonanza_: The 1972 episode "First Love" focused on the school's new headmaster Dan Edwards, who belittles and humiliates the students... except for star pupil Jamie Hunter Cartwright, who somehow meets the teacher's demands. But the teacher-student relationship is doomed by other means, as Jamie becomes friends with Mr. Edwards' wife, Kelly... who is abused by her husband. In the end, Jamie tells Mr. Edwards that he is aware that he is abusive, and after Edwards slaps Jamie, it isn't long before he is run out of Virginia City.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Principal Snyder. He does explain why he's a teacher, despite hating kids: "Somebody has to keep an eye on them." An example of an Aborted Arc, as the end of an episode reveals he's among Mayor Wilkins' inner circle and is aware of the existence of vampires. The Season 2 finale also shows him reacting more with glee that Buffy is wanted by the police rather than nervous about being in the presence of a mundane juvenile delinquent. After she was cleared of all charges, Snyder still refused to let her back into Sunnydale High simply because he was glad that she was gone, but the school board, along with physical and professional threats from Giles, forced him to change his mind. However, he's returned to standard Sadist Teacher when Season 3 begins and is as astonished as anyone when the Mayor ascends.

-   Saskia Duncan from _Dance Academy_: An inexperienced teacher in the process of recovering from an injury that could shorten or end her career as a principal dancer, Saskia becomes intensely jealous of Tara's lyrical style and ability to dance the same solo (the Red Shoes) that made Saskia the youngest ever principal dancer with the Company. Initially, this jealousy leads Saskia to undermine Tara's confidence and bully her both in and outside of class. Later, in a private pas de deux class, she forces Tara into a dangerous stretch that results in a _broken vertebra_, leaving Tara courting paraplegia with every step. Fortunately Ben was there too...
-   Miss Sinclaire in _Dead Gorgeous_. She makes it her life mission to have the Ainsworth sisters expelled.
-   _Drake & Josh_:
    -   Mrs. Hayfer is considered an overall nice teacher by Josh, but she often nitpicks at Drake for his poor performance, even going as far as to continuously say she hates him out loud. The most obvious example of how much she hates him would be in one episode where she asked him what language _The Odyssey_ was in. Drake answers Greek. She says "Wrong," then asks another student who gives the _exact same answer_, which is right. She even said he was wrong on a rhetorical question! However, Drake is frequently a complete Jerkass.
    -   Mr. Roland, a chemistry teacher, is far more sadistic as he doesn't allow Josh to take the exam due to his tardiness, tells him that he will have a make-up test that next Saturday at 6 a.m., and marks him down one grade. Josh was late because of Drake and when Drake moves out, Mr. Roland treats him much better at the make-up exam and decides to revoke the grade punishment and Josh gets better. Drake living in the same house as Josh must have been why Josh was having bad days.
    -   On one occasion, Josh himself. When he tries to be a student teacher for Megan's class, the first homework assignment he gives? A science one with _college-level textbooks_ that even the class's _parents_ couldn't figure out. The next day, when he finds out none of them could do it, he _punishes them_.
-   _Even Stevens_: Coach Tugnut actively encourages his gym students to inflict as much pain on each other as possible in games like dodgeball, and he once built an obstacle course that included a cage where students would be locked inside with a live gorilla. That episode was a dream, though.
-   _Family Ties_:
    -   In the episode "The Harder They Fall", Reuben Tedesco is an insufferably rude and insulting to parents as well as students, he provokes both Keaton parents to violence when Mr. Tedesco can't shut his mouth:
        
        **Mother 1:** My son says you're always insulting him in front of the other students. You call him names.  
        **Tedesco:** Who's your son?  
        **Mother 1:** Larry Morgan.  
        **Tedesco:** Larry the Loser? Madam, your son is a pimple-faced liar!  
        _\[later\]_  
        **Mother 2:** My daughter Cindy so enjoyed reading _The Little Prince_. Is there anything else you could recommend for her?  
        **Tedesco:** Yes, I'd recommend she lose about forty pounds. You could lose about thirty yourself.
        
    -   Tedesco happens to be one of Alex's favorite teachers, and Alex is at first upset with his parents; however, Alex eventually realizes Tedesco is modeling behavior he doesn't want to be associated with and dis-associates with him.
-   Although he's now _de facto_ retired due to his alcoholism and being exiled to Craggy Island, Father Jack Hackett from _Father Ted_ was once clean, sober, and a brutal parochial teacher who beat students with a hurley and set a desk on fire while threatening his class with eternal damnation.
-   And she has a Spiritual Successor in _Flesh and Bone_'s Paul Grayson, who alternates between praising, berating, and seducing the dancers in his company (His Bipolar Disorder makes him likely to do any of these on a whim). In one memorable scene, right as they're about to leave for Thanksgiving weekend, he makes them rehearse for an upcoming show over and over again, remaining displeased no matter how flawlessly they perform, to the point where he's hurling constant verbal abuse at them.
-   Sue Sylvester from _Glee_. From her brutal yet efficient ways of training the 'Cheerios' cheerleading squad to the way she throws things around and almost throws a kid out of a corridor when she's angry in one episode, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone worse than her (Roald Dahl notwithstanding). Even then, admittedly, it's only done mainly for comedy purposes... Surprisingly enough she's a reasonable principal (with the exceptions of trying to disband football and fire Will. That she relents when she sees him as a very competent teacher). She even responds to the bullying in the school better than Figgins ever did and does seem genuinely upset that she couldn't protect Kurt. She has her reasons for this - bullying someone for being different seems make her really mad. Although she ruthlessly terrorizes the school, she is very much an equal-opportunity bully, and the kids know it.
-   Mr Bronson of _Grange Hill_ was mostly a stern man but his treatment to one student in particular was _definitely_ sadistic. The kid, Danny Kendall, was about to leave school and was even given an offer to his ideal job... before Bronson found out, called up the business and said some truly awful things about him. The two had been having this arc where Bronson was trying to 'Bring \[Kendall\] into line' which ended when Danny lost the job offer, they had a fight in Bronson's office, and Danny stole Mr Bronson's car and used it in his carbon monoxide suicide, which in turn led to Bronson being forced to prematurely end his own career. The fact that Bronson was Hitler shows how bad he was.
-   _Hank Zipzer_: Ms. Adolf is Hank's teacher who despises even the concept of anything fun. She is very harsh towards students in her class who don't understand the lessons, like Hank.
-   The _Horrible Histories_ franchise gleefully invokes this both on the page and screen (a direct result of creator Terry Deary's deep mistrust of formal education). Highlights from the TV series include the puppet rat host introducing a single pea on a plate as a brain 'from a PE teacher', the Grim Reaper deciding to quit and 'become a school headmaster', and this doozy from Elagabalus in the "Evil Emperors' Song":
    
    _"You'd think to children, I'd be cuter  
    No, I was their biggest executor  
    Used their guts to read the future  
    Says here I should get a job as a school tutor!"_
    
-   _iCarly_:
    -   Mr. Howard, the teacher in the episode "iGot Detention". This leads to double the trouble in the episode "iHave My Principals": after Principal Franklin gets fired, Briggs and Howard are made co-principals, and turn the school into a miniature police state. Not only do they act horrible to the kids (Gibby got detention just for _being Gibby_, and the guy told Freddie to wipe "that look off of his face", despite it being Freddie's neutral face. When Freddie protested by saying that it was his face, the guy said "Well, maybe you should change it, then!"), they also force them to wear uniforms, and apparently have hidden microphones in the hallway.
    -   Ms. Ackerman from "iHave a Lovesick Teacher" treats her students harshly after her boyfriend breaks up with her. The iCarly gang tries to get her to loosen up by setting her up with Spencer, but she turns out to be a Yandere who treats him horribly. Ultimately, they manage to get rid of her by tipping the FBI off about how she's been downloading pirated songs onto her PearPod, leading to her arrest.
-   Mr. Gilbert from _The Inbetweeners_ goes between this and Apathetic Teacher. For the most part, he's clearly lost any and all enthusiasm he may have once had for his job and, barring incredibly cutting put-downs, generally if the students keep their heads down and behave themselves sufficiently to avoid causing too much trouble or bringing the school into disrepute he leaves them alone. However, if they manage to sufficiently get on his bad side, he tends to target them with Disproportionate Retribution and take active, malicious pleasure in any misfortunes they may encounter. And unfortunately for our protagonist Will, he managed to piss off Mr. Gilbert with quite literally _the very first thing he said to him_:
    
    **Will:** Mr. Gilbert, you seem like an intelligent man...  
    **Gilbert:** I _seem_ intelligent...? How lovely of you to say.  
    **Will:** No, I just meant...  
    **Mr. Gilbert:** I mean, I've long since been insecure about my capacity for learning, so it's nice to have it ratified by you. A _child_.
    
-   _Iron Fist (2017)_ has the martial arts version. Flashbacks shown Danny Rand being beaten by the monks of K'un-L'un, and when Danny strikes a student in Colleen Wing's dojo for disrespecting him she is _not_ impressed, as many of them are victims of street violence or domestic abuse.
-   _Little House on the Prairie_: In the 1976 episode "Troublemaker", Miss Beadle is fired for her inability to control the older students (solely due to the influence of Mrs. Oleson). Miss Beadle is replaced by Hannibal Applewood, a mean, cruel headmaster who singles out Laura Ingalls as the school's bad seed after she is incorrectly blamed for a series of infractions for which other students were responsible, thanks to a completely false tip by Mrs. Oleson. Charles learns about "Mr. Crabapple" and his past and, after confronting Applewood about his demeanor, forces his resignation. Miss Beadle is returned to her job and the schoolchildren finally stand up to the school's true troublemakers.
-   _Malcolm in the Middle_:
    -   Herkabe delights in verbally abusing the _smartest_ students (generally because he himself was considered a brilliant child, and ended up a total disappointment to himself). Of course it's not surprising that an important character is a teacher who's a sadist — how many characters on that show _aren't_ sadists?
    -   Reese's teacher Mr. Woodward from before Herkabe showed up. Malcolm figured it out when he proofread an F on one of Reese's papers that for once he didn't deserve, along with the teacher's "Kids like Reese..." speech.

-   _Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide_:
    -   Played for Laughs with Mr. Sweeney. In one episode, Ned asks Mr. Sweeney to explain how a science fair diorama should look. In response, Mr. Sweeney reaches behind his desk, takes out an elaborately detailed diorama explaining why Ned is likely to get an "F" on his science fair project — and shows it to the whole class. However, he does soften up over time, with the eventual result being that Sweeney was only sadistic from Ned's point-of-view and Ned usually deserved the grades Sweeney gave him.
    -   Sweeney also subverts this trope in the Grand Finale, where he admits to Ned (who is hanging upside-down in a tree) that Ned was his favorite student and enjoyed his antics. And leaves him hanging in the tree.
-   In the _Night Gallery_ episode "Deliveries in the Rear", a student at a surgical lecture is made woozy by the sight of a demonstration cadaver. The instructor's response is to make snarky quips about the corpse and the young man's distress until the unsettled student faints.

-   Mr. Messerschmidt from _Phil of the Future_ delighted in making the students miserable. He once administered a test, the Omicron Gambit, that's so difficult no one has ever passed. Even opening the test booklet is impossible:
    
    **Messerschmidt:** Opening the test is _part of the test!_
    
-   _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_:
    -   Principal Kraft will give out detention slips at the literal drop of a hat.
    -   An episode had the one-off character Mr. Rockwell, a rude and incredibly sadistic math teacher (for example, after warning students that anyone who was late to the test by even a _second_ would fail, he shuts the door and taunts a student who was one second late due to helping a fellow student _in a wheelchair_). Sabrina asks her aunts for help and they eventually get him to stand trial in an Other Realm court, where he claims he hates teaching and is only doing it to raise money for his computer start-up. Rockwell is then sentenced to his worst nightmare: remaining a math teacher for the rest of his life. When Sabrina complains about the effect this ends up having on those unfortunate enough to be his students, Zelda handwaves it by claiming he teaches them a "valuable lesson" that some people are just jerks. Yay.
-   The historical reality show _That'll Teach 'Em_ is about 30 modern teenagers who attend a simulated 50s or 60s boarding school. By today's standards, most teachers at these schools would probably qualify, as they insult their pupil's intelligence, yell at them for the slightest infraction and deal out nasty punishments. However, this practice was commonplace in the 50s and 60s and actually seen as a helpful way to shape teenagers into well adjusted members of society.
-   Haresh Chandra appears to be this when he first appears as the new headteacher in _The Sarah Jane Adventures_, then it turns out he is the new regular character Rani's father (much to the dismay of Class Clown Clyde who has an obvious crush on Rani). He's also a nicer person when he gets home, and Rani and her mother Gita make fun of him for his stern streak.
-   _The Secret Life of Us_ has a substitute teacher nicknamed Mr. Mad Dog, who appears in a flashback to Will's childhood. Will tells his friends a story about the teacher walking into a rowdy class, forcing everyone to admit to how they'd been misbehaving and hitting each on the hand with a ruler in turn. When it was Will's turn, he told him, quite honestly, that he'd done nothing but sit there trying to ignore everyone else. Mad Dog ignored him, repeated the question, and continued hitting Will, who refused to change his story. It went on long enough for another teacher to hear them from the hallway and intervene, and Mad Dog was fired.
-   _The Secret World of Alex Mack_: Alex, in one episode, has to do a science project for a teacher who also had her older sister Annie for a student. As such, the teacher continually mocks Alex for not being as smart as Annie, provoking Alex to use her powers to "spice up" her project in a way that would be very hard to explain.
-   Chuck Noblet in _Strangers with Candy_, particularly to Jerri. Word Of Stephen Colbert says he does this because he's so repressed and secretive, and resents her for trying to find things out and figure out her life.

-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_: Sister Dominique. Despite being a _nun_, she shows blatant favoritism towards London, always punishing Maddie for things that London does. One episode has her giving Maddie detention for "tempting" London when she accidentally violated a copyright while writing a kid's book. London was the one who decided to blow the entire thing out of proportion and have her book published. Another episode (one where Maddie is Put on a Bus) has her giving Maddie a pamphlet that was at least 30 years old to get her to come over to a camp. Said camp is a horrible place (they are across the street from a slaughterhouse; they once had _leech cobbler_ as a meal).

-   _Two Sentence Horror Stories_: In "Elliot" Principal Meyer shamelessly taunts Elliot for being trans, then tries to murder him with a pipe.
-   Mr Tanner from _The Vampire Diaries_ proves himself one in his thankfully short run of episodes. During his time, he openly insults students who don't know things and brings up personal tragedies in front of the class (Such as the death of Elena's parents), keeps files on students he doesn't like such as Jeremy, proves he doesn't know _basic facts such as the end of The Korean War_, bullies students and tells Stefan he hopes to see him hurt while playing football.
-   Mr Norris in _The Worst Year of My Life, Again_. He particularly seems to have it in for the protagonist Alex King but is also shown handing out detentions at the drop of hat to almost anyone.

    Music 

-   Pink Floyd: In _The Wall_, "The Happiest Days of Our Lives" describes how "when we grew up and went to school, there were certain teachers who would hurt the children any way they could" as a way of venting their frustrations with their dysfunctional marriages. The teacher is portrayed in a slightly more sympathetic light in _The Final Cut_, in which we learn that he is a bitter veteran of World War II who takes his anger out on the children, whom he perceives as whiny and ungrateful.
-   Mrs Blaileen, she was a sixth grade teacher/ and she controlled the children/by using humiliation..
-   From Neil Innes' _My New School:_
    
    _The teacher's like a bear with a greasy head  
    And if he had a gun we'd all be dead  
    In my new school_
    
-   The Smiths: "The Headmaster Ritual" describes Manchester's teachers as "belligerent ghouls" who sadistically torture and humiliate students.
-   This song from Danny Elfman's abandoned musical project "The World of Jimmy Calicutt" is told from the perspective of one such teacher.
-   The Beatles:
    -   Verse two of song "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" has a teacher with no recourse but to punish Maxwell:
        
        _Back in school again  
        Maxwell plays the fool again  
        Teacher gets annoyed  
        Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene  
        She tells Max to stay  
        When the class has gone away  
        So he waits behind  
        Writing fifty times I must not be so, uh-uh-oh_
        
    -   "Getting Better" cites this:
        
        _I used to get mad at my school  
        Teachers that taught me weren't cool  
        You're holding me down, turning me 'round  
        Filling me up with your rules_
        
    -   Also John Lennon's "Working Class Hero" touches on it:
-   In the Eminem song "Brain Damage", a prepubescent Slim pretends to be sick to get sent home before his bully can batter him, but his teacher assigns him extra homework - "_that bully wants to beat your ass, and imma let him!_". Later, when his bully is stomping him in the toilet, the school principal comes in and joins in. (The sadist teachers ended up helping Eminem avoid a lawsuit when the bully, namechecked in the song, tried to sue Eminem for defamation - the over-the-top detail of the teachers joining in was used as evidence that the song was an exaggeration and could not be taken as fact.)

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Wrestling school in general is this, by a combination of tradition and necessity. First of all, no matter how choreographed it is, wrestling _hurts_. And it hurts more when you're learning how to take the expected bumps. There's also a belief in the industry that the training has to be brutal as a safeguard to keep out the insufficiently determined — if the training is sadistically painful, only the kids determined enough to become wrestlers that they'll _always_ put the business first stick with it. Lastly, in a bit of Enforced Method Acting, wrestlers are often taught to sell submission holds by the trainer applying the hold to the point of significant discomfort. This practice is known as "stretching." This trope in regards to wrestling finally got a major overhaul in 2020 when the 'Speaking Out' movement exposed several trainers (most notably Ricky and Saraya Knight) whose methods were outright abusive and demeaning, all under the guise of "paying your dues".
-   Very common in the Japanese pro wrestling scene, where training regimes tend to be extremely hard. Pretty much every puroresu company has had at least one sadist trainer in its dojo.
    -   Kotetsu Yamamoto from New Japan Pro-Wrestling was _feared_ by his trainees, but after his retirement, Riki Choshu and his apprentice Kensuke Sasaki became the worst offenders. Sasaki accidentally killed a student named Hiromitsu Gompei who failed to impress Choshu during a training session who went too far, and years after, another wrestling prospect named Giant Ochiai died under suspicious circumstances in a dojo run by Choshu. In general, the NJPW Dojo has also been subject to allegations of abuse for years.
    -   During the 90s, All Japan Pro Wrestling seniors and trainers were accused of physically and sexually assaulting the students of its dojo. It was apparently usual for them to order apprentices to do push ups on the showers' floor while the older wrestlers urinated on them, and an even uglier rumor has an apprentice of Satoshi Kojima choosing to quit wrestling altogether due to Kojima's advances on him.
    -   Yoshiaki Fujiwara was a legit tough guy, and he passed his toughness to his New Japan and Universal Wrestling Federation trainees through terrifying training regimes.
    -   As Chris Jericho cites in his book, Genichiro Tenryu used to have his students from Wrestle Association R dojo repeatedly beaten up for no reason. He even told the foreign wrestlers (Jericho himself) to punch them as hard as possible while working with them in the ring.
    -   Satoru Sayama was an incredibly cruel and harsh trainer both in wrestling and Mixed Martial Arts promotions, to the extent that there are clips of him beating students with a shinai cane, and it's popularly stated his apprentices get hit harder in the dojo than in the ring. In fact, Karl Gotch supposedly remarked that Sayama was a great trainer yet an equally great gym bully.
    -   In the old Fighting Network RINGS promotion, Akira Maeda once assaulted his trainee Wataru Sakata during a post-match interview (with the TV camera running!) after the latter performed too bad for Maeda's liking. According to some, this was just the tip of the iceberg.
    -   Former FMW wrestlers claim to have passed beatings and sexually humiliating initiation ceremonies in the FMW Dojo.
-   Old catch wrestlers like Billy Robinson and Stu Hart were very, very sadistic towards their trainees. It's said that The Dungeon, Hart's training gym, had holes on the walls from slamming people against them while sparring.
-   Stu Hart refused to let any of 'the boys' in his area train Desiree Petersen on the grounds that they were "mean", and sent her south of the border to The Fabulous Moolah instead. Apparently that didn't end up being any better, as Judy Martin, Mildred Burke, Penny Mitchell, and Princess Victoria are named as her trainers in the states but Moolah isn't.
-   Wendi Richter named The Fabulous Moolah as such. In order to train with her, she had to pay a sizable entrance fee and also rent an apartment from her - and she had to work at Wendy's to pay for that in addition to her grueling training. Moolah would also encourage the trainees to make themselves sexually available to promoters, while also taking a large portion of their booking fees, which she continued to do while Wendi was working with WWF for a while<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . The kicker? According to Wendi, Moolah never trained the girls personally and just got her more experienced girls to do it.
-   To the surprise of no one, Homicide admitted to brainstorming and actively searching out new ways to make his students miserable such as wearing abrasive material or dipping his hands in chemicals to burn their eyes. Most of his students interviewed play it for laughs though some of his already established peers have joked there would be more good wrestlers if so many up-and-comers weren't too scared to get training from him.
-   These allegations have followed WWE's farm leagues for years. Specifically, Jacqueline was accused of working trainees at Ohio Valley Wrestling to the point of injury while Ivory was said to be verbally demeaning and abusive. Bob Holly gained infamy for beating _Tough Enough 3_ winner Matt Cappotelli to a bloody pulp in training and later giving him a concussion (the internal bleeding was said to be accidental). Rip Rogers was known for beating wrestlers who messed up on OVW shows with a kendo stick afterwards (and he was a _favorite_ of the students). Meanwhile, Deep South Wrestling trainer Bill DeMott was accused of physically abusing students and Kevin Matthews produced a picture on Twitter of DeMott over seeing a naked wrestler giving a stink face to a trainee. DeMott defended his actions by saying he was often acting on the orders of John Laurinaitis (yet it was Jim Cornette who was fired for slapping a trainee who got a fan hurt when Laurinaitis lectured him on liability issues of publicly traded companies).
-   The trope is at least nominally acknowledged by NWA Quebec's school, which is known as "Onyx and LuFisto's Torture Chamber".
-   In kayfabe:
    -   Matt Striker, who parlayed his real-life job as a high school teacher into a gimmick as a sadistic teacher. He had a Piper's Pit-style segment called "Matt Striker's Classroom," where he insulted the fans and the faces as intellectually inferior — all while playing up the heels as his friends. Naturally, his behavior led to plenty of feuds with his opponents wanting to shut him up.
    -   Terry Taylor: His gimmick as the Red Rooster during the late 1980s WWF, a novice wrestler guided by his "teacher" … Bobby "the Brain" Heenan. In promos prior to Taylor's debut, Bobby Heenan boasted that he was such a great manager and teacher that he could turn a "mediocre" wrestler into a feared championship contender. Naturally, Heenan succeeded only in embarrassing Taylor, often yelling at him, belittling him in interviews (e.g., "Maybe he's not the fastest wrestler" or "He often doesn't hit hard enough," etc.) and at least once slapping him after he lost a match. Predictably, Taylor eventually realized he didn't need Heenan and began doing things his way, further frustrating "the Brain," and eventually, Taylor turned on his "teacher".
    -   Michelle McCool was briefly a sexy teacher and a heel, who brought a wooden cane to the ring and fought dirty in matches. Like Matt Striker above, she was previously a middle school science teacher. The gimmick didn't last too long and she was mortified by it, terrified of her former co-workers seeing it in case she ever wanted to get the job back.

    Radio 

-   For a little while, _Adventures in Odyssey_ had "Dr. Hawthorne", who is always convinced that local Nice Guy kid Trent Dewhite is up to no good. Said teacher crosses into this trope in the episode "A Glass Darkly", where he repeatedly accuses Trent for all sorts of random crimes that Trent had nothing to even do with, refused to let Trent explain himself if he didn't just flat out ignore him, and wouldn't let Trent off the hook even though Trent had a very important meeting to attend.
    
    **Trent:** You can't do this to me! I have an important meeting to get to!  
    **Dr. Hawthorne:** Well, you should have thought of that before you flung your jello.
    

Perhaps the writers decided that Hawthorne was getting too unsympathetic despite their intentions (Hawthorne was typically placed in the right in many situations even in "Darkly") as he was chucked shortly afterwards.

-   Headmaster Hardthrasher of St Bastard's in _Bleak Expectations_ is a parody of Wackford Squeers. Unlike Squeers, he isn't stealing funds from the students, but his school boasts a 100% fatality rate. Usually by savage beating, for any number of insane and irrational reasons (crying, not obeying the rules, talking back, not talking back then talking back when told to, not convincingly miming eating...).

    Tabletop Games 

-   One of the prompt cards from _Cards Against Humanity_ reads "My gym teacher got fired for adding \[blank\] to the obstacle course." Possible answers include "Bees?," "A Burmese tiger pit," "Flying robots that kill people" and many, _many_ others that imply this trope.

    Theatre 

-   Terence Rattigan's _The Browning Version_ deconstructs this trope. The protagonist, Andrew Crocker-Harris, appears to be a stuffy, hateful bore who enjoys humiliating his students. Students despise him as the "Himmler of the lower fifth" and even his fellow teachers don't much care for him. But Crocker-Harris reveals his Hidden Depths as a brilliant but frustrated academic with a fractious private life, who's lost sight of why he went into teaching in the first place.
-   In _A Chorus Line_ Diana Morales recounts the story of her first acting teacher at the High School for Performing Arts, Mr. Karp, who turns on her after she questions his approach, and allows the other students to humiliate her.

-   Professor Calahan from _Legally Blonde The Musical_ is unafraid to kick Elle out of class on the first day. Justified in that she didn't do the reading, but still. And he treats his TA like crap, _and_ he teaches students that ethics shouldn't play into law. He gets better... until we find out he hits on interns...
    -   In the movie, the teacher who kicked Elle out was Professor Stromwell, who Elle initially saw as a Sadist Teacher (Emmett also said "she can really kick you in the balls"). Stromwell turns out to be a tough-but-fair Reasonable Authority Figure, though, and later gives Elle an inspirational talk about not giving up when Elle is seriously considering going home.

    Video Games 

-   In _Avencast: Rise of the Mage_, three senior teachers at Avencast Academy give the player character tasks to complete before they approve his graduation. Two assign easy tasks. Della Gustera sends him to pacify a huge crypt full of hostile undead that the wrathful spirit of the Academy founder reanimated, then threatens to withhold his approval anyway for destroying the founder's body in the course of their Boss Battle. Guess he really hates people who sleep in class.
-   The entire premise of the game _Baldi's Basics_ is built around evading the eponymous Baldi, a teacher who becomes angrier and angrier as you get impossible math questions wrong, and chases you with a ruler to kill you.
-   Mr. Henderson from _The Classroom 2_ who tells a student to shut up when a lab experiment blows up in their face. Later in the game, he participates with another student in blackmailing the protagonist to make it looks like _he's_ the one responsible of the lab incident.

-   In _Fortune Summoners_ Mr. Harnel is a pretty open version of this (much of his dialogue early in the game is gleefully thinking of how he can torment his students). Ms. Sophia is a more subtle version; she seems nicer, but still has a mean streak (one student had to be "rescued" from her by the headmaster and she picks Arche to answer a mathematics question because she was the only one who didn't put her hand up).
-   The plot of _Giana Sisters: Dream Runners_ involves Doc Owl traveling to the waking world to torment Giana in disguise. He works as Maria's substitute teacher and makes her so miserable that she's sent home crying to her sister Maria.
-   The staff from Harvest's only school in _Harvester_ takes this trope to an insane level; the teacher Steve meets gleefully uses a baseball bat to punish her students. A cutscene shows that she whacks a child so hard on the head, he bleeds out on the floor.
-   The teacher seen in the intro movie of _Heart of Darkness_, wherein he puts Andy in a hole and asks him if he's afraid of the dark...
-   _Lost Judgment_ has Hiro Mikoshiba, a student teacher at Seiryo High School, whose death kicks off the plot of the game. Yagami's investigation reveals that Mikoshiba was a vicious bully who drove one of his classmates to suicide back in high school. Then, as a student teacher, he forced the students in the basketball club to perform needlessly intense exercises and began singling out Mami Koda, a beginner in basketball, for abuse, which resulted in the entire team ganging up on Koda as well.
-   Kaidan's Biotics instructor in the first _Mass Effect_. A Drill Sergeant Nasty turian who was on active duty during the First Contact War, he was extremely racist towards humans for humiliating the turians, enjoyed introducing himself to the young humans he was begrudgingly forced to teach as "The man who killed your parents" and his training involved forced overclocking of biotics with flawed first generation implants (which led to unpleasant effects like migraines, nosebleeds, and seizures), enacted extremely harsh punishments if they didn't (Kaidan mentions him breaking a teenage girl's arm for trying to drink water without using biotics) and was generally a horrible person. No tears were shed when Kaiden accidentally severed his spinal column and killed him during a fit of Power Incontinence that his abusive teaching caused, and the incident was even glazed over entirely once the humans in the council learned about his cruelty.
-   _My Child Lebensborn_, being about raising a child that is ostracized by an entire town, has its fair share of those:
    -   Miss Hansen is at the very least singling the child out. The child is introduced to the notion of being a German bastard via her _telling the entire rest of the class about it_. Before that, the Player Character sends the school a letter in response to other students damaging the child's books or backpack while bullying them, only to find out that Miss Hansen read the letter in front of the class and called the child a tattletale. If the player decides to not send the letter out with the child to avoid this, Miss Hansen will instead make them demonstrate the Nazi salute during an entire lecture about war. Yes, the child is part German, in case you're wondering.
    -   Mr. Solheim is quickly dreaded by the entire class because of his extremely strict attitude and such a firm believer in the idea that Germans are mentally deficient at a genetical level that he refuses to believe that the child _actually is_ a good student. He's also the person who eventually sexually assaults the child.
-   _Persona_:
    -   _Persona 2_ has Principal Hanya. He's a massive jackass who abuses his authority in _very_ creative ways in order to ensure his power, and uses the city's powers to brainwash his students into believing he's the best. Except magic has a price, and he should have read the price tag...
    -   _Persona 4_ has Kinshiro Morooka, a.k.a "King Moron", a brutally conservative Jerkass who is convinced that all teenagers are horny troublemakers and that the main character is nothing but trouble from the city. He treats his students rudely (putting the main character on his "Shit List" within minutes of meeting him if the protagonist talks back to him in response to being told that he's a loser), and has a tendency to get drunk on school field trips. Still, his accusations of the Main Character being a horny bastard may actually have some truth behind it. That said, conversations with some students in the school reveal that he's dragged several girls into his office for "private talks"... in which he advises them on their career paths and urges them to follow their dreams. Morooka might be one of the subtler mean nice guys out there, since you'll never, ever find this out without talking to everybody. It's likely that he genuinely cares for his students but really doesn't know how to properly show it. Even the main cast, who all hate him, admit that he _really_ didn't deserve to die when Mitsuo murders him. And his replacement, Ms. Kashiwagi, is if anything an even _worse_ Jerkass than him!
    -   _Persona 5_ has gym teacher and Starter Villain Suguru Kamoshida, who uses his status as a former Olympic athlete to sexually prey upon the female students (to the point where one of his victims tries to kill herself) and physically abuse the male students (to the point of breaking former track star Ryuji Sakamoto's legs). His Palace shows that he truly thinks of himself as "king" of the school and that it gives him every right to treat his "subjects" however he wants. No wonder the heroes decide that Heel–Face Brainwashing him is the only option since the school's been actively covering up his crimes.
-   Mr. Namyah, the gym teacher with No Indoor Voice from the _Reality-On-The-Norm_ series. In his very first game, he forces a student to box a punchbag covered with little shards of glass, all while he is screaming insults at the student. He is also a bigoted, paranoid conspiracy theorist.
-   Miss T from _Scary Teacher 3D_ catches the player character leading to a failure. The objective in this game is making pranks at her.
-   Overseer Harkun, from the Sith Inquisitor storyline in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_, certainly qualifies. He despises the Inquisitor for being a former slave (and potentially an alien) and plays favorites with Ffon, a pureblood Sith acolyte. As a result, he gives Ffon easy tasks for his trials, while sending the Inquisitor to ancient tombs crawling with enemies, hoping they’ll die before they return. In the end, Lord Zash kills Ffon and takes the Inquisitor as her apprentice, so it definitely backfired on him.

    Visual Novels 

-   Mr. Yamato from _Lux-Pain_. It's fairly obvious from when you first meet him, but just to cement the point, he tries (and succeeds, for a while anyway) to take several students in school hostage. He fires a few shots, but no one dies.
-   Law teacher Aristotle Means in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies_ teaches some very, very grim and underhanded tactics and philosophies in the classroom, despite his apparent pleasantness. And then if you insult his motto in court, he'll shift his demeanor, complete with hairstyle change, into 100% this, pulling out a large chalkboard from nowhere and treating everyone (including the Judge, who is visibly intimidated by him) as students.

    Web Animation 

-   _ATTACK on MIKA_:
-   _ETU - Animated Stories_:
-   _GoAnimate_: Just as the parent characters frequently come off as sadistic in the "X Gets Grounded" videos, so do the teacher and principal characters. This can range from them holding back a student a grade just for getting a single math problem wrong, to holding races (usually swimming races) for their students just so they can suspend/expel the one student unlucky enough to come in last place, to torturing them in detention or getting them arrested or even killed for so much as causing a pin to drop in class.
-   _Ed, Edd, n Eddy Z_ has this trope as its backstory: when president George W. Bush passed the No Child Left Behind Act, American congressmen started cutting corners when hiring teachers to teach America's students. These teachers made America's children and teenagers participate in medical and military experiments. It eventually got so bad that the nation's students (which included a group of three saiyans) waged war on their educators, an effort in which they got support from the U.S. military. One of these teachers, Professor Utonium, is the Big Bad.
-   _Gossip City_: Yamai was a brutal PE teacher who forced sick students to participate and hit people with balls for petty reasons. He even forced Nao to take off her hat revealing her bald head.
-   _Manga Angel Neko Oka_: Waruo keeps expelling students due to bad grades and blames them for not preparing but he doesn't teach them well. Akira got him fired from the school.
-   _Manga Soprano_:
-   _Refreshing Stories_: Mr. Nagano is a tough PE teacher who hits his students. When he hit Ruri's brother, she swore revenge on him and she eventually exposed him to everyone and he lost his job and was thrown in jail.
-   _Revenge Films_:
-   _Shishihara_: Ms. Jogasaki is infamously known for being overly strict, she sucks up to the principal and other teachers while also picking on students, and she often confiscates makeup from several students only to use them for herself. She even tries to get Sota and Yurika expelled just because of an arguement over a lip balm.
-   _XIN_: The school rules are practically built around allowing teachers to do whatever it takes... violent or non-violent... to keep order in class. Including brutalising students into bloody shivering pulps... for homework violations...

    Webcomics 

-   Mr. Albany from, _I.M. Hip_ He goes to great lengths to put the main character in detention (again!)

-   In _Red String_, Arata routinely torments his students; he even orchestrates getting the main character expelled when she dares to stand up to him in class for ridiculing a friend. It's to the point that another main character (known for being headstrong and prone to foolhardy heroism) has been asked by the student body to do something about him.
-   _Sequential Art_: Kat takes a photography gig to take elementary school yearbook photos, only to discover to her horror that the teacher who meticulously insulted and humiliated her in fifth grade was the principal of the school. It should be noted that in her class, Kat would be repeatedly reprimanded for not giving precise details to correct answers while her school rival Brittany would earn nothing but praise, implying that the teacher _knew_ Brittany was a sociopath _and loved her for it_. Their adversarial relationship was promptly renewed, with Kat trying to stay professional while the principal repeatedly pulled up old grudges for the sake of it, until Kat finally confronts the teacher, calls her out about her treatment, and declares that she'll put up with it no longer. Somehow, this manages to give the principal a _heart attack_. Instead of grieving, the schoolchildren joyously sing "Ding Dong the Witch is Dead" because she'd been doing the same to her other students for _decades_.
-   Keiko Keshin from _Triquetra Cats_ is an evil vampire sadistic Principal, using her position to torture students, those who survive the torture are made into vampire henchmen.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, the science teacher (who hasn't actually been seen in a while) was shown to feel schadenfreude toward Elliot during the time Elliot was locked in a female form during the "Sister" arc. He mocked Elliot for thinking that his teachers really cared about their students' education instead of just their salaries.
    -   The school principal, while well-intentioned, is fully convinced that art (murals in particular) is the _only_ way to educate children about morality, and repeatedly abuses them through school policies in other ways because he thinks they _don't count_ for the purposes of psychological growth. He isn't actively trying to make the children's lives miserable so much as trying to cut costs on essential services and resorting to abusive practices that he thinks are 'trivial' and 'forgettable' for the purposes of launching big-ass morality-boosting murals.
    -   Mr. Raven is a subversion; he starts out looking vehemently unhinged. He also refuses to believe Grace doesn't know anything about the World Wars, and then, when he tries to make it up by saying she should be in a special class, refuses to believe she could have learned about WWII that quickly. It's also mentioned that being one of his 'favorites' isn't a good thing; he's _tougher_ on the students he likes because he expects more from them. But he will also fight to defend his students without hesitation, is apparently a decent guardian to Noah, helps Grace try to save a boar, and explains things patiently when they can't and is filled with recrimination about his role in Tedd's parents breaking up. He's really a Stern Teacher with enough personal baggage to comes across as a sadist if you don't know him. The whole initial incident boils down to Stern Teacher Raven assuming Grace and Ellen are typical high school kids and them assuming he's a typical high school teacher. Ultimately, Raven is simply the son of a national guardsman who was convinced by both his father (and his father's gruesome death) that children need to learn how to be tough, and that abuse is worth not watching them die horribly. And then there's his _mother_...
    -   Conversely, the math teacher offered a subversion — although he initially seemed like he was going to be one of these, giving Ellen and Grace a hard time for their improbable coincidences, he quickly revealed he was actually fooling around and in fact turned out to be quite nice.
-   Mrs. Cruddletwat, Max Pritchard's teacher from _Ennui GO!_ regularly insults and physically abuses her students and _barely_ puts forth any effort in actually teaching them something. "Fraud" reveals that she's a subversion, as in she's not a teacher _at all_. She's actually a crazy squatter who pretended to be a teacher specifically to torture the students attending the school. Once Max's mom Bella _and_ the principal find this out, she is promptly arrested.
-   In a surprising move, the titular character from _Dominic Deegan_ is a subversion of the Sadist Teacher trope; he has a reputation as an incredibly difficult teacher, but all of his students love him and are better people because of him, he never humiliates or bullies them in any way, and they all actively try to help him in every way they can. The class is hard because the _subject_ is hard, not because he's a bad teacher. In fact, all of his students considered him their favorite and were devastated when his reputation as a "hard" teacher caused him to get fired.

-   Von Pinn from _Girl Genius_ seems to be like this. It is subverted though, as later it is revealed that the students actually love her.
-   An arc in _So You're a Cartoonist?_ involves Curmudgeonly Carl, a substitute art teacher who verbally eviscerates an artistic hopeful's style and abilities to the point where the kid is at a loss for words. However, Carl quickly turns into more of a Stern Teacher, since not only does the kid in question has an over-inflated sense of his own ability and _really_ needed to be brought down a peg, but Carl actually gives him pointers and tells him that he _does_ have potential, his skills just need fine-tuning. The arc ends with the kid trying what Carl suggested, but mumbling to himself, "I still hate that old coot." In his second appearance, Carl's calmed down considerably, and offers to help the same kid with his portfolio after an abysmal college fair visit, if he agrees to visit the college fair every year so Carl can critique his work personally. The kid balks at the idea until Carl smugly reminds him the college he's representing is the only one in the state that has a comic art degree program. The kid begrudgingly agrees, claiming he _still_ hates that old coot.
-   Miss Arlene from _Neko Machi_, who is constantly coming up with new ways to mess with her students. Among other things, she's the inventor of the "pop-midterm" (basically a pop-quiz, but worth 25% of your grade), and she considers clicking erasers to be "cheating erasers".
    
    **Kitty:** You're trying to hurt my brain, aren't you?
    
-   Korgar, from _Peter and Company_. For example.

    Web Original 

-   Usually subverted and/or averted in the _Whateley Universe_, even though the stories center around the Super Hero School Whateley Academy and some of the teachers are retired _supervillains_.
    -   Erik Mahren, the ex-Marine range master on Range 4 (the heavy weapons range) is notorious for being absolutely ruthless when it comes to weapons safety, but the net result of that is that no students are hurt or killed on the ranges in his entire tenure as rangemaster.
    -   The Reverend Darren England has gone after a couple students when he senses their connection to planet-threatening evil... but goes _way_ over the line when he hires Syndicate hitmen to help some of his minions try to assassinate one such student (who happens to be one of the good guys).
    -   The closest thing to the "sadist teacher" archetype seen at Whateley so far would actually be Amelia Hartford, though she ends up being more of a highly placed Obstructive Bureaucrat or Dean Bitterman due to not actually having a teaching position (that we've seen thus far).

    Web Videos 

-   Madam Soot Beng from _Titan Academy_ is a hyper strict, overbearing and sadistic teacher that gives out detention very easily, gives way too much homework and is not afraid to give Corporal Punishment to misbehaving students. Considering she was put in charge in the so-called 'worst class in the Academy', it's almost a necessity. By the end of it, it turns out she really cared for the students and her sadism was her means to protect the students from the harshness of the Singaporean education system, taking the blame and getting herself fired when the students were in danger of being expelled.
-   _Unwanted Houseguest_: Coach Hooten in issue 3 of the comic enjoys picking on the less athletic kids. He does show concern for Melody's safety, however.

## Michael Rosen

In his poem "Strict", Michael Rosen tells a story of his experience with a teacher who didn't let her students breathe in her classes.
