Those _were_ the droids he was looking for.

_"Watson, if it should ever strike you that I am getting a little over-confident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper 'Norbury' in my ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you."_

Nothing defines a hero better than his morals, and the biggest sympathy point can be guilt over some monumental screw-up that taught the hero to buckle down and stop taking his job too lightly. This is sometimes related to the origin of a Superhero, but has more impact when the hero's career has otherwise been going well for a while.

From a philosophical standpoint, this makes sense — if someone wins all the time, as heroes tend to do, they would be more defined by their failures than their successes. In Marvel Comics, this is sometimes a consistent psychological flaw (the "Marvel Flaw") which occasionally prevents a hero from succeeding.

The hero will often declare that "It's All My Fault" while their friends and family say, "You Did Everything You Could."

The hero may recover from this and when they do, it's usually a sign they have grown, although retcons can cause an unpleasant return to status quo.

The Failure Knight has this as part of his backstory to explain why he is so devoted to his new charge. Often produces a combination of Past Experience Nightmares and Anxiety Dreams.

See I Let Gwen Stacy Die for one of the most common failures. Might result in We Used to Be Friends. Often happens to heroes who fail to make amends. Can be a Career-Building Blunder. When the failure is what put the character on the path to being the current (better) person they are now, it's Necessary Fail. If the plot brings about an opportunity to correct or make up for their failure, you have My Greatest Second Chance. If failure puts the hero in a funk that takes years to shake off then you have a Scrap Heap Hero. Also compare to Old Shame, which is often what drives this mindset.

    -   James Conrad gets one in his backstory in _Kong: Skull Island — The Official Movie Novelization_. He previously took a mission to rescue the illegitimate Malaysian daughter of a British embassy worker who'd been kidnapped by rogue Indonesian soldiers, and the mission ended with the girl and several of Conrad's own men dead.

Deconstructed in _Godzilla vs. Kong_, where Mark has misinterpreted and over-embellished the lesson to be learned from this mistake by swinging from being an overly-absent father to instead being a controlling, patronizing and hardass father who insists to the point of delusion that Madison is Just a Kid with no brains of her own.

-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
        -   Captain Kirk failed to restrain his friend Commander Mitchell when he began exhibiting God-like powers, although he was warned by Mr. Spock; it wasn't until Mitchell killed a crewman and set about destroying the Enterprise that Kirk took action. And prior to that, he was haunted for over a decade by the deaths of over 200 crewmen (including his CO) because he thought his hesitation in firing on the Monster of the Week allowed it to attack; it was only when he saw it would have made no difference that he accepted his choice.
        -   Beyond Kirk, Commodore Decker in "The Doomsday Machine" is pushed beyond the Despair Event Horizon when he watches in horror as the planetoid he evacuated his crew to is destroyed by the titular device, killing everyone. He's Driven to Suicide by the result.

        -   In the episode "Things Past", Odo's friends witness his greatest failing as a security officer during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor: in the interest of keeping order, he condemned three innocent Bajorans for attempting to assassinate Gul Dukat based on circumstantial evidence. He eventually recognized his mistake and has tried to do better ever since. At some points, he seems to suggest that working for the Cardassians in general was this to him.
        -   Worf has his own: as a child, not realizing how much more powerful Klingons are than humans, he killed another child during a game of soccer. He's held himself back from full enthusiasm over anything ever since.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Chakotay failed to catch (and ended up falling in love with) the Cardassian spy Seska in his Maquis cell, which came back to haunt him when she betrayed the series' titular ship and its crew to the evil Kazon. To add insult to injury, he also failed to catch the _Federation_ spy Tuvok, compounding the guilt over Seska's betrayal. He only (sorta) recovered when he realized that _neither_ spy realized the other was in the cell, making the incident not (entirely) his fault.

-   _Forgotten Realms_: For decades, Drizzt Do'Urden had kept a vow to never kill another dark elf. However, he couldn't keep it forever, and in order to escape, he had to kill one of his kin. He was guilt-wracked for this... but, in a possible subversion, not for long, as he realized it was a hypocritical vow, given that he had often seen the necessity of killing orcs, humans, goblins, duergar, wererats, and others who actually tended to be less Always Chaotic Evil than his own people. In addition, the primary reason he had been able to keep that vow for so long was that he had been able to _avoid_ other members of his race for most of that time, and being able to keep a vow because you never end up in a situation where breaking it is possible doesn't mean all that much.
-   _In Nomine_: Even 20,000 years after the fall, the Archangel Blandine still hasn't got over her lover, Beleth, betraying her and Heaven, and blames herself for having failed to notice Beleth's growing resentment and unhappiness.

-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Imperium of Man had its own greatest failure during the end of the Great Crusade. During the beginning, it was believed that there was nothing science and reason couldn't conquer.

So new measures were taken to make sure such heresy never happened again.
    -   Sarpedon of the Soul Drinkers nearly led his Chapter into the clutches of the Dark Gods... and has _eight legs_ to remind him of the danger of Chaos.
    -   This is nothing compared to the Eldar race's greatest failure, which resulted in: 1) the destruction of their galaxy-spanning empire and the deaths of billions (if not _trillions_) of their race; 2) the fragmenting of the race into repressed ivory-tower ascetics, nature-attuned tribal agrarians, and blood-thirsty torture-obsessed sociopaths; and 3) **the creation of one of the most powerful, and seriously messed-up Chaos gods**.
    -   Ahzek Ahriman feels a lot of guilt for accidentally transforming most of the Thousand Sons into suits of Animated Armor when he cast the Rubric and spends a lot of time trying to restore their humanity. The novel _Ahriman: Unchanged_ reveals that he’s repressing an even deeper sense of guilt for failing to save his brother Ohrmuzd from dying of the flesh-change.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy_: The Dwarfs consider the Chaos Dwarfs this. They are everything the Dwarfs are not, forsaking the ancestor gods for the Chaos God Hashut, taking slaves instead of relying on good Dwarfen labor, allying with Greenskins instead of exterminating them on sight, and immediately putting new technology to use instead of relying on tried and true tradition. All this, combined with the utter shame of having their own people betray everything that is sacrosanct to them, means that the Dwarfs, to this day, prefer to pretend they don't exist and utterly refuse to speak of the Chaos Dwarfs, and react very angrily to anybody else bringing them up (the fact that the Dwarfs will also bring up Men and Elves' issues with Chaos traitors every chance they get is, to them, completely besides the point).

    Theatre 

-   In _Critic's Choice_ by Ira Levin, Parker resists Charlotte's demand that he give Angela's new play a good review even though it's not a good play and both of them know it, because he's still consumed with guilt over the uncritical reviews that he used to give the plays his first wife appeared in:
    
    "Charlie, I'm a nut, I know I am, but I still have _nightmares_ once in a while about those fake reviews I wrote to keep Ivy happy. And when I say nightmares, Charlie, I mean pajama-soakers! I'm in a plane, a passenger plane, flying over mountains. The stewardess comes around with cocktails, and those six reviews are printed on the little napkins. Suddenly everybody is ugly-drunk and coming at me with their knives and forks. "Listen, folks, look, I told the truth about _Helen of Troy_!" And then the pilot comes out, played by my high-school English teacher, and he taps me on the shoulder and informs me that we're overweight and one passenger has to jump..."

This hat trick of perceived failure leads her to swear off using her shapeshifting powers until her sister and grandfather convince her to stop blaming herself.
    -   Mr. Raven holds himself responsible for Tedd's mother having divorced his father and not having any further contact with her son.

-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Vaarsuvius is a highly intelligent elven wizard with a large ego. This sets them up for a fall on two occasions:
        -   Their ego takes a severe beating when they're unable to defeat a highly spell-resistant death knight, fail to prevent the hobgoblins from overrunning the breach at Azure City and winning the battle (including having fleeing allied soldiers _beg_ V to help them and one of them cursing the elf's "useless goddamn magic" with her dying breath after V is unable to help them due to having run out of spells), and then spends months trying to overcome the effects of an anti-scrying abjuration without luck, in a situation when the fate of the world practically hinges on the elf's success. The long-term consequences for Vaarsuvius remain yet to be revealed, but in the short term, they certainly include Past Experience Nightmares, every symptom in the book for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and easy temptation to a Face–Heel Turn when their self-perceived lack of ability puts their family in danger. Based on this strip, it looks like V isn't going to live down that Face–Heel Turn, either.
        -   After that is the realization that the Familicide spell V used during said Face–Heel Turn wound up being responsible for the death of a staggering number of innocent people.
    -   Elan gets a bit of this when the half-orc Therkla is killed trying to protect him. She's poisoned, and Elan lacked the Bard spell that would have cured her. It affects Elan enough that when he reunites with Haley, he reveals that he took "Neutralize Poison" at his next level up.
    -   Roy blames himself for not intervening in a situation where one of his father's experiments ended up costing his baby brother's life, in spite of Roy being ten years old at the time. A villain later tries to exploit this guilt.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: When he was thirteen, Lalli's Mathematician's Answer in a scout report caused a group of soldiers from his military base to venture into a dangerous area and four people to be killed. The number was considered low in regards to the attack's violence. His older cousin reprimanded him quite harshly about it, and during the scolding implied that a single mistake from their grandmother was the reason they had left their old home to live on that military base five years before that event. In the present day, it causes Lalli to prefer fixing a mistake in finding a path while half-asleep to leaving it hanging and forcing the rest of the crew to backtrack. When he couldn't find a safe path to a new campsite, he put himself into a Power-Strain Blackout to create one via clearing a tunnel full of troll pods.
    -   Adventure II goes into more detail about their grandmother Ensi's mistake: she dismissed Hilja's strange behavior as the onset of dementia, and locked eyes with her, which allowed the kade that possessed Hilja to force Ensi into the Hive Mind as well. This led to Hilja infecting an entire village with the Rash, the massacre of said village to prevent its spread (with Onni, Lalli, and Tuuri the only survivors), and Ensi being unable to move on to the afterlife since she's part of the kade.

    -   Ozpin takes responsibility for everything that's gone wrong in the world, regardless of accuracy. However, his greatest mistake seems to drive his actions in the present. The first time he reincarnated, he defied the God of Light's warning that Salem was no longer the person he knew; when they reunited, she manipulated him into trying to unite the world by pretending to be gods. He swallowed his misgivings until it eventually became impossible to ignore how evil she had become; this led to a terrible confrontation between them in which their castle, kingdom and four daughters all perished. That event became the trigger for Salem's world-destroying machinations, and the crippling guilt and secrecy Ozpin struggles with.
