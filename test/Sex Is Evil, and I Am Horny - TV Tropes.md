_"When I look back upon my life  
It's always with a sense of shame  
I've always been the one to blame_

_For everything I long to do  
No matter when or where or who  
Has one thing in common, too  
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin."_

A character with this state of mind believes that Sex Is Evil, but can't escape their own sexuality. This forces the character into a couple difficult dilemmas, which they may resolve in any combination.

1.  **To have sex or abstain from sex.** Having sex means they're participating in something they believe to be evil, but abstaining from sex leaves them with the anguish of unmet sexual desire. (Likewise regarding masturbation)
2.  **To judge others, oneself or both**. Some characters judge other people as "evil" for having sex, but hypocritically give themselves a free pass. Other characters exclusively judge themselves and fall into self-hate, without being especially focused on the actions of other people. Some characters judge themselves and other people in equal measure. One common pattern is for a character to criticize others for inspiring his own sexuality, in a Never My Fault scenario. This latter type is likely to care little, if at all, for their sexual partners, as they consider them "dirty" and might resent them (or worse) for "leading him into temptation."

Needless to say, these characters operate under ethical guidelines completely opposite to those of an Ethical Slut.

The character isn't necessarily a rapist (though they might well fear becoming one if they aren't careful); it's enough for them to be a Jerkass about their sexuality under the presumption that Sex Is Evil, "unmarried non-virgins are whores", or similar. They are likely to eventually take it out on their partner(s), themselves, or both.

If they do commit sexual harassment or worse, they might be Obliviously Evil about it. They are likely to show their consideration by choosing victims who are already Defiled Forever, so that some extra abuse won't make any difference… to them, that is.

In a setting where Sex Is Evil, this character will exemplify the evils of sexuality. If they make a Heel–Face Turn and become good, they are likely to forgive their victims for "tempting" them. In a setting where sex is _not_ evil, the character is likely to be contrasted with a Chivalrous Pervert, Good Bad Girl, or fully operational Ethical Slut.

A character with this mindset is likely to think that at least some men are incapable of controlling their sexual urges, so women should expect them to commit sexual harassment or worse and be Crazy-Prepared in various ways, such as second-guess what these men might find attractive and then try her best to _not_ look attractive, lest these men get their urges. Some particularly unsympathetic or tragic characters may take this attitude one step further, demanding the Double Think that we should all consider men to be some kind of monsters while still considering them to be the superior gender—morally and otherwise. This is done by blaming women for "tempting" men (by their appearance or even their mere _existence_) and thus making any sex-crimes against them their own fault. Naturally, many works portray this attitude as barbaric misogyny.

While this trope seems like it would fall into the "Always Male" category, and traditionally it was, female examples do exist. They're less likely to be genuinely dangerous and more likely to be frumpy killjoys taking out their repression on others in their capacity as Moral Guardians. On the other hand some such women may cause genuine harm depending how cruel they are in enforcing propriety, especially if they're Abusive Parents or otherwise in a position of authority.

Makes for a particularly tragic Politically Incorrect Villain — or Anti-Villain. See also Armoured Closet Gay, Troubled Sympathetic Bigot, Then Let Me Be Evil, and Internalized Categorism. Contrast the two tropes that oppose this one, Celibate Hero ("I Don't Need Sex But You Can Have It, Just Not With Me") and Ethical Slut and Chivalrous Pervert ("Sex Is _Not_ Evil, And I Am Horny"). Contrast Romanticized Abuse for when abusive sexual gratification is played for fetish appeal rather than angst, contrast the polar opposite I'm a Man; I Can't Help It when the male character doesn't even try to keep his sexual urges in check. Compare _and_ contrast Why Did You Make Me Hit You?, which is more about "Violence Is Evil And I Am Angry." This can lead to a case of Romance and Sexuality Separation.

In many cases, this trope comes with religious connections. Many religions have specific rules regarding sex, and some go so far as to claim that sex is inherently wrong (with perhaps a grudging acceptance of the fact that there needs to be _some_ sex in order to create the next generation, but you're not supposed to enjoy it).

Compare and contrast Evil Desires Innocence.

No Real Life examples, please. But examples of how real cases have been _portrayed_ in media are okay.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, Asuka tells Misato that she has never seen "such an inappropriate relationship" by someone who is supposed to be her guardian regarding Misato's relationship with Kaji. However, she makes several passes at the man herself, including trying to seduce him the night before they arrive in Japan, but he flatly turns her down. She also makes several less than subtle attempts to get Shinji, who is so socially awkward he doesn't get it.
-   Jirou from _Kamisama Kiss_ is pretty much the walking embodiment of Straight Edge Evil, the Evil part doesn't last, but he soon starts becoming attracted to the heroine Nanami. Unfortunately for Jirou, Tomoe (a Kitsune and Shapeshifting Seducer) notices this...
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_: Mutsuki is a trans man who was initially depicted as finding Male Gaze and attention to be disgusting owing to being a victim of implied sexual abuse by his father and later Torso. However, it's seeing Sasaki interact with Touka that makes him jealous and realize he has feelings for Sasaki and secret resentment for Sasaki leaving the Quinx squad. It results in Mutsuki stabbing Uta when he is wearing Sasaki's face while proclaiming his love and begging Sasaki/Uta to Please, Don't Leave Me. He then undresses from the waist up and is implied to do something sexual to Uta/Sasaki while calling himself embarrassingly female and cuddling close to him.
-   _Shimoneta_ is rife with this, as society has declared that _anything_ with "lewd" connotations should be strictly outlawed for the public good—including basic sexual education and even clinical terms for genitalia. Suffice to say, suppressing peoples' natural tendencies in such a manner leads to this trope, particularly with Anna, who confuses lust with love after being given an Accidental Kiss by Tanukichi, going full-on Yandere not long after.
-   Iino from _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ is repeatedly shown to be bottling up a ton of repressed sexual urges, and cracking down hard on lewd material/conduct on campus is implied to be her idea of keeping it under control.
-   Explored in _O Maidens in Your Savage Season_, which is all about girls coming to terms with their sexuality. Early in the series, Kazusa and Rika both suffer from this. Rika suffers more from the 'Sex Is Evil' thought, and Kazusa more from 'and I am Horny'. Though both get better about it by the end of the manga.

    Comic Books 

-   In _New Mutants_ Wolfsbane's guardian Reverend Craig was a preacher of the hellfire and brimstone variety, and he basically beat it into her that she was going to hell because her mother was a prostitute. It was later revealed that he used to have sex with prostitutes, one of them being Rahne's mother. She realized this later on and went to confront him revealing she knew his secret and that he was actually her biological father.

    Comic Strips 

-   A _Beetle Bailey_ strip illustrated how the Reverend Staneglass dealt with the trope in him regarding Miss Buxley. It shows Staneglass and Miss Buxley walking their separate ways, and two privates talking about them:
    
    **Private 1:** \[asks how the Chaplain avoids Miss Buxley's charms\]  
    **Private 2:** He just closes his eyes to it.  
    _\[the Chaplain crashes into a streetlight\]_
    

    Fan Works 

-   The general gist of this fanfic on a _Pokémon_ kink meme involves Cyrus feeling this way about Cynthia. Considering that Cyrus's canonical motivation is "Emotions Are Evil And I Am Passionate," it's not surprising that fanfic involving sexuality sometimes takes him in this direction.
-   A lot of fic involving N and Hilda is like this, with N raping her because he's too overwhelmed by confusion over his sudden sexual urges and attraction to her.
-   Some _Kim Possible_ fanfics feature Ron feeling guilty over thinking of Kim in this manner.
-   Briefly touched on in _The Prayer Warriors_, when Michael, a fundamentalist Christian who's infiltrating Hogwarts to get information on a planned attack on the Christians, meets Ginny. He briefly finds her "hot" but forces those thoughts out of his head because they're evil, and is deeply uncomfortable when she pats him.
-   The NSFW _RWBY_ fanfic _Love Hurts:_ Weiss was raised in a strict upper-class household, and her sex education came from an alcoholic mother who hated her husband and an overprotective older sister. She was therefore taught not to have sex before marriage, and she got the impression that she shouldn't enjoy it anyway. So when she does get into a premarital sexual Friends with Benefits relationship, she occasionally feels really guilty about the whole affair. Though the fact that her mother is blatantly cheating on her father and her beloved older sister is in her own premarital relationship helps a bit, she still holds herself to an unreasonable standard.
    
    Weiss stopped herself a second time. _Do I want this?_ she thought to herself. On one hand, asking Jaune to do what she was going to ask just seemed wrong, almost abusive. On the other, she _was_ getting rather delicious shivers just thinking about it.  
    "I'm such a slut," Weiss berated herself, which was very, very far from the truth. Nonetheless, she knocked on Jaune's door.
    
-   In _Flag Flying High_, Lan Sizhui has been adopted by the very proper Lan clan, with the expectation that lust was something to purge out of yourself. Then he falls in love with Harry and starts to daydream about kinky situations involving the other boy, something that makes him extremely ashamed and flustered.
-   _Lelouch of the Wings of Rebellion_: Normally, as in canon, Shirley is very adamant that she loves Lelouch for his good quality and believes in reforming him from his bad qualities. Shadow Shirley is very blunt in clarifying that, no, Shirley does in fact like his dark side and when Shirley found out he was Zero, that only skyrocketed her attraction to him.

    Films — Animated 

-   The "Hellfire" sequence from Disney's _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ is the epitome of this trope in song-form; Claude Frollo constantly tries to convince himself that his attraction to Esmeralda is her fault and not his and that "God made the devil so much stronger than man." This leads to him trying to have her burnt at the stake to rid his mind of her, or be his and his alone.
    
    _Like fire, hellfire,  
    This fire in my skin  
    This burning desire  
    Is turning me to sin!_
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Adult Version of Jekyll and Hide_: Leeder is cheating on his fiance, and Hide picks up a sailor just to have sex then mutilate him.
-   The master of the reformatory for wayward women in _Diary of a Lost Girl_. He confiscates a tube of lipstick from a particularly pretty prisoner, then puts the lipstick on himself. Then he writes "Punish Erika" on his day calendar with the lipstick. _Then he draws a heart_.
-   _Dark Shadows_: Barnabas, in his attitude to his attraction to Angelique. He is quite unapologetic about the way he used her for sex and broke her heart. This being a setting where a witch is created as a woman makes a deal with the devil, it is heavily implied that it was his cruelty that turned her into a witch... Just like it was her cruelty that later turned him into a vampire.
-   The bad guy in _Preaching to the Perverted_ spends the movie fighting against harmless sadomasochists. At the end, it turns out that he is a sadist as well, but has avoided taking part in the "perverted" lifestyle by living out his sadistic lusts in a "more acceptable" way... taking it out on children.
-   The protagonist of the movie _The Good Girl_ is so repressed that it leads her into a destructive adulterous relationship.
-   One of the main themes, if not the main theme of _The Wicker Man (1973)_ is the conflict between the stuck-up, virginal, devoutly religious Sgt. Howie and the sexually liberal, promiscuous pagan islanders. The filmmakers have stated that Howie's decision of whether or not to have sex dictates what happens to him in the end.
-   In the movie _Crimes Of Passion_, "Reverend" Peter Shayne mixes moralism and horniness into a combination that grows more and more destructive. Stalking a prostitute he has the hots for as a misguided crusade to "save her soul." His sexual harassment of her eventually forces her to kill him in a final confrontation. Afterwards she and the protagonist (who tried to save her from the psycho, but she saved herself instead) become a couple and presumably live happily ever after.
-   In _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_, Judge Turpin fills this role, fooling himself that he can protect young Johanna from the evil of other men's sexuality by forcing her to marry him and satisfy his own selfish lust. Various theater versions of this musical have various takes on this. Some make him a more clear-cut example by highlighting his self-loathing, while others make him more one-dimensional. His solo "Johanna (Mea Culpa)" exemplifies this much the way "Hellfire" does for _Hunchback_'s Claude Frollo.
-   In _Disturbing Behavior_, this is the most frequent cause of the mind-control chips glitching out—fundamental instinct on the part of former teen delinquents straining against puritanical brainwashing resulting in temporary Ax-Crazy. Either that, or it's a form of pon farr.
-   In _Secretary_, this view on his own sexuality seem to be the core of Edward's internal conflict.
-   Greg Pilkington in _Priest (1994)_. The conflict is pretty natural since he's a gay Catholic priest, but the way he treats his sex partner is still pretty appalling, and Father Matthew calls him out on it.
-   Amaro, the eponymous priest of the Mexican film _El Crimen del Padre Amaro_, being under the Catholic Priesthood's vow of celibacy he becomes infatuated with a beautiful teenager, he at first rejects her advances and performs acts of penance for his lust, but then he later gives in and goes full swing from this trope to I'm a Man; I Can't Help It.
-   Subverted in _The Seven Year Itch_. Richard Sherman knows full well that "The Girl" is sexually innocent and theoretically shouldn't pose any threat to him, and that his own subconscious lust is what is sorely tempting him to ravish her. But that doesn't stop him from temporarily entertaining the idea of murdering her in order to end his torment.
-   In _Sadie Thompson_, Davidson the puritanical Christian reformer kills himself after he can't overcome his lust for Sadie (see Theatre below for the stage version, _Rain_).
-   In _The Marriage Chronicles_, Ethel is shown as enjoying the sex antics of his wife, but repeatedly protests that he "don't want no freaky things" during the therapy.
-   _Dr. Strangelove_'s completely insane Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper believes that because he feels sleepy after sex, that therefore means women are trying to steal his essence (he also seems to have no concept of the refractory period). However, he still has lots of sex, he just tries to not let them steal his essence.
-   Mark of _The Sessions_ has great guilt over his sexual feelings, both due to his Catholic upbringing and because of the profound guilt he feels over what he perceives as the sacrifices that everyone makes for him. It is only after Father Brendan gives him his blessing that he pursues losing his virginity and even then, his negative feelings toward sex make it difficult for him to make progress.
-   _The Barretts of Wimpole Street_: In his Villainous Breakdown, Edward more or less admits that his own unyielding grip on his daughters Elizabeth and Henrietta is driven by his own belief that sex is sinful, because his own urges led to him raping his wife.
    
    **Edward:** You know nothing of the brutal tyranny of the senses, and how even the strongest and best are driven by it to hell!
    
-   Implied in _Deathgasm_ during the fight at Brodie's uncle and aunt's house. After they—religious fundamentalists—become possessed, Brodie finds a variety of sex toys in the closet which he uses as improvised weapons.
-   _Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles_: Jeanne is a Single Mom Stripper prostitute who entertains callers in her apartment. She receives men with the same rote dullness that she peels potatoes for dinner or does the laundry — until she gets a strange expression on her face when a client is on top of her humping away. Out of nowhere, and clearly to her own shock, she gets an orgasm. As soon as she gets out of bed, she murders her client by stabbing him in the neck with a pair of scissors.
-   _Psycho_: Norman Bates has this as a result of his oedipus complex. Whenever he gets attracted to a woman, the "Mother" side of his Split Personality takes over and murders them to punish him.
-   Mallory Knox in _Natural Born Killers_ is a female example of this due to her deep rage over her sexual abuse at the hands of her father. She has a tendency to initiate flirtation or sexual activity with men other than her One True Love Mickey, then flip out and kill them for being depraved sex beasts.
-   _Blood of the Tribades_: The priests preach that everything sexual except for straight sex between married couples is wrong. However, when they come upon Élisabeth and Fantine (the lesbian vampire couple) after they've had sex, they pause to stare at them rather than kill the pair immediately. Élisabeth sees and accuses them of being hypocrites who are turned on by them. It seems to be true, given the above, but they kill them both after this.
-   _Stations of the Cross_: Maria's church has a very high bar for modesty and sexual purity, so when she begins to talk to a boy who likes her, her priest insists she's tempting him to lust and her mother screams at her until she cries over the dinner table. This abuse culminates in Maria asking the boy to never talk to her again and worrying about his own soul, leaving Maria friendless.
-   A major theme in _The Devil's Playground_ is the tensions, personal or otherwise, that arise from religious doctrines requiring one to suppress their natural sexual desires, whether it be a boy going through puberty or an adult man struggling to control his desire for the opposite sex after catching glimpses of women's bodies at a public pool.

    Literature 

-   _Ai no Kusabi_ has Iason Mink who is The Beautiful Elite that must abide by the No Sex Allowed law. He chastises his eventual Sex Slave early on for being disgusting and having no value other than to perform sex acts as low-class scum. Then _he_ starts engaging in sex himself realizing he quite enjoys it.
-   The villains in the first book of the _Millennium Series_. The original title translates to "Men Who Hate Women", and that sums it up quite nicely. The villains are distinguished, morally upstanding gentlemen who happen to be serial rapists and sexual serial killers. They are contrasted by a protagonist duo of Action Girl hacker and Knight Errant journalist who are both Ethical Sluts.
-   John the Savage, from Aldous Huxley's _Brave New World_, is a classic example of this trope. He's completely confused thanks to an upbringing consisting of a mother from a society where all desires including sexual ones are instantly gratified, the traditional "savage" society in which he's been living as an outcast with her that shames female promiscuity, and reading a lot of Shakespeare. When he falls in "love" with someone from the hyper-liberal society, he wants to think of her as pure and is terrified that she actually wants to sleep with him because that's dirty. Yet he certainly has his own repressed urges.
-   In Victor Hugo's _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_, the villain, Claude Frollo, has this with his mix of lust and loathing for Esmeralda.
-   Carrie's abusive Bible-thumping mother from _Carrie_ was convinced that sex was evil, even within the confines of marriage. However, her husband managed to pressure her into having sex (or outright raped her; it's a bit ambiguous), the result of which was her telekinetic offspring. She never got over the fact that she enjoyed the act.
-   Keira in the _Dark Heresy_ books is a religious fanatic who believes that sex is evil and killing people is good. She is also a teenage girl. Needless to say, she is _very_ confused.
-   Baelor the Blessed, a Targaryen king in the backstory of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ was a fairly decent king and laid the foundation for unification with Dorne, but he was also a religious nut who imprisoned his three sisters (one of whom was also his wife) so that he would not be "tempted" by the sight of them. This meant he was indirectly responsible for the founding of House Blackfyre, who rebelled no fewer than five times against the crown, and his refusal to father an heir cleared the way for Aegon the Unworthy, arguably the second or third worst king of the Targaryen dynasty (after Aerys the Mad King and Maegor the Cruel).
-   Alec D'Urberville in _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_ morphs into this trope. After he seduces Tess (read: rapes her while she sleeps) and she leaves, he has a spiritual "reawakening" that causes him to become a man of God. When he meets Tess again, he blames her for his fall and makes her swear on a roadside cross to never tempt him again. Which is, of course, his way of trying to cover up the fact that he still wants her, bad. In the end, he drops the religion.
-   Played with in _The Belgariad_ with Relg, a religious fanatic and zealot. His problem is not that he believes _sex_ is evil. It's more that he believes _taking pleasure in pretty much anything except religion_ is evil. He hates women who tempt men, and he hates himself for responding to physical beauty in women. The rest of the characters think he's off his rocker, including Taiba, the extremely attractive Marag woman who also becomes part of the group. She confronts him about it, arguing that the 'sin' is in his mind, not hers. His inability to resist her is the first step towards him getting over his attitude, which he eventually does.
-   The villain of _Whispers_, and one villain in _Watchers_, both by Dean Koontz. Actually, the vast majority of Koontz' villains (more so in his early work, but still present today) have major issues with sexuality.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   In _I Shall Wear Midnight_, this trope is what drives The Cunning Man, the villain of the piece.
    -   In _Small Gods_, female worshipers at the Church of Om are kept strictly segregated behind partitions during all services, lest a mere glimpse of half the human race render its priests or male worshipers mad with lust.
-   In _Atlas Shrugged_, Hank Rearden displays this about having sex with protagonist Dagny Taggart and cheating on his wife, Lillian.
-   In a _Nightside_ short story, this trope is used as a spiritual weapon that backfires. A fanatical trio of Christian fundamentalists — one man, one woman, and one ghost — uses the cumulative power of the abstinent living members' sexual frustration to power magical attacks against pagans and their deities on the Street of the Gods. As it happens, the Street is a place where _any_ revered figure can take on spiritual power, and when the holy trio make the mistake of coming too near the Church of Marilyn Monroe, the first two are overwhelmed by the Horny side of this trope and start tearing each other's clothes off, oblivious to danger or their ghostly associate's protests.
-   In _The Redemption of Althalus_:
    -   The protagonists have to rescue Leitha from being burned as a witch. It turns out that the local priest is constantly getting aroused by seeing pretty girls, but since he's a holy man and assumed to be above that sort of thing, he assumes they're using witchcraft to "corrupt" him, so he has them charged and executed instead of dealing with his own weak moral fiber. While Leitha (who did actually have supernatural powers—that let her figure out the whole tragic mess, to boot) survives, it's revealed that he's murdered a very large number of girls beforehand.
    -   Heroic character Bheid has a bit of this going on, he's eventually forced to get over it, and ends up married to the above-mentioned Leitha.
-   In _The Poisonwood Bible_, Orleanna indicates that her husband Nathan is a prime example of this trope. She mentions that he would rarely sleep with her, and when he did, he would end up begging God for forgiveness and blaming her for having led him into temptation. Somehow, they managed to have four children, a fact that Orleanna wryly lampshades.
-   In one of the Aubrey-Maturin books, a sailor comes to Stephen asking if there's such a thing as the opposite of an aphrodisiac, and if so, can he have some—because his wife is a very religious woman and is disgusted by the idea of sex being pleasurable, so even when she's willing to sleep with him, he freaks her out with his enthusiasm, and then he feels even worse. He's concluded that his only chance of ever having the thing he wants so badly is not to want it.
-   In _In the Time of the Butterflies_, Patria describes her hands "wandering" at night and her desire to lick the fingers of every man that walks into her father's store, despite the fact that she wants to be a nun.
-   Being what he considers an upstanding Christian man, John struggles with sexuality in _Dirge for Prester John_.
-   _Song at Dawn_: Raymond de Toulouse is described as having "a priest's mentality about sex and a fifteen-year-old's restless penis". He reconciles this by deluding himself into thinking he's a Knight Templar and therefore he can rape the daughter of a vassal because that somehow fits into God's plan. Everyone else thinks he's evil.
-   W. Somerset Maugham's story _Rain_ ends on the strong implication that the reason Rev. Davidson killed himself is that he tried to act on his unspoken lustful attraction to Sadie Thompson while trying to convert her to lead a more decent life. The notorious stage adaptation makes the implication only slightly more explicit.
-   Two of the young adult characters in _Needful Things_ are saving their virginities for each other until after they marry, leaving them both incredibly sexually frustrated. It leads one of them to being seduced by the cursed items from the store.
-   The Big Bad in Bertram Fox's _Impudent Crimes_ gets his start when a prostitute mocks him as a nervous virgin and he pounds her to the floor. He concludes that he's been given a calling to fight the evil of sex and goes on to be an evangelical preacher, but still beats up whores in his spare time.
-   A major theme in _The Naked Sun_. Solaria is a planet where all physical contact is obscene and tolerated only for the purpose of procreation. The main suspect is the murder victim's wife, Gladia, who was actually curious about sex and sexual pleasure, which led to a lot of problems between her and her "Good Solarian" husband. The criminal turns out to be a person who lusted after Gladia and hated her for it, especially after she refused what passed for his "advances". She refused to become his assistant. There is no way he could compromise with his feelings beyond that; he was the one person on Solaria who would (and did) rather die than see another person face to face.
-   The antagonist in one of the _Night Huntress_ novels, the ghost of Heinrich Kramer, the guy responsible for the _Malleus Maleficarum_, could be described in these terms. He's intensely obsessed with women and resents them for it so much that he's spent five hundred years raping, torturing, and burning them at the stake on the pretext that he thinks they're witches. Their real crime is obviously that they make his pants fit funny.
-   Eileen, the protagonist of _Eileen_ describes herself as a prude. She harshly judges women who she deems too slutty, and is disgusted by and tries to deny anything sexual about herself, to the point of starving herself and wearing very baggy clothes to avoid looking feminine. Yet she is constantly thinking about sex and always disgusted by her own arousal - at one point she shoves snow down her pants in response to some sexy thoughts.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Game of Thrones_: King Baelor Targaryen locked up his sisters in the Maidenvault so they wouldn't "tempt" him. Baelor was such a zealot that he ended up fasting himself to death. He died without an heir and was succeeded by his uncle.
-   In one episode of _Sex and the City_, one of the main characters dates a guy who gives her a hard time for "making him dirty" by allowing him to have sex with her.
-   In the miniseries version of _Les Misérables_ (NOT the novel by Victor Hugo and not the musical either — only the miniseries version), the protagonist Jean Valjean has been given a dose of this. In all versions of the story, he loves his adopted daughter, but in the miniseries, this has been given creepy undertones of him having pedophilic urges that he needs to fight with himself to keep in check.
-   This is the reason behind Karofsky's bullying of Kurt in _Glee_, although in his case it's more of a case of Homosexuality is Evil and I Am Gay.
-   Brandon Hantz from _Survivor_ states in a confessional that Mikayla "flaunts herself" and that as a born-again Christian he has trouble being around her. To their credit, the editors show **no** sympathy toward this attitude, putting together a montage of Mikayla obliviously working around camp whilst Brandon stares at her in the creepiest way imaginable.
-   _Marco Polo_: Jia Sidao is traumatized by his sister becoming a prostitute when they were both children, especially because he had to hide under the floorboards while she did so. When he actually falls for a woman he has trouble expressing it.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   Substitute "illogical" for "evil" and you get a Vulcan going through _pon farr_. Dr. McCoy says that "perhaps it's the price they pay for having no emotions the rest of the time". They're so ashamed of it that they can barely discuss it among themselves, much less with any offworlders. In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Amok Time", Vulcan attitudes toward sex almost result in terrible consequences.
    -   In the _Star Trek: Voyager_ episode "Someone To Watch Over Me", Seven of Nine has to deal with the fact that her..._desires_...are starting to awaken when Janeway finds her watching Tom and B'Elanna's relationship going on.
-   _The Tribe_: The Guardian, the fundamentalist preacher of the Chosen cult, actively represses his own sexual desires. He takes it very badly when Trudy offers herself to him, as he had conferred the title of Supreme Mother unto her as she carried the child of Zoot, his supposed God. He gets into a complicated relationship with Tai-San, whom he genuinely lusts for, while seeking spiritual advice from her.
-   In _Shadow and Bone_, Matthias Helvar is a Witch Hunter Fundamentalist who has been raised to believe women fall into Madonna/Whore categories, and that Grisha women in particular will use charms and wiles on any unsuspecting man. So when he finds himself forced to rely on a Hot Witch to survive a shipwreck and the subsequent trek across dangerous permafrost, culminating in the two of them having to conserve heat by sharing a bed... suffice to say, he doesn't handle it particularly gracefully, resorting to calling her "lewd" and "immodest" to try and hide the fact he's insanely attracted to her. The cherry on top is that this witch's specific power-set allows her to read heart rates and body signals, so he's not fooling anyone.
    
    **Mattias**: _I can't wait to be back in my own bed._  
    **Nina**: _Yes, I can **feel** how much you hate sleeping next to me._

-   The Genesis song _Jesus He Knows Me_, about a televangelist.
-   Implied in Nirvana's "Lithium": "I'm so horny, but that's okay, my will is good." I.e. I can resist my urges.

    Print Media 

-   A lot of newspapers accused themselves, each other and a certain politician of internalizing this trope in their portrayal of a horrific event where eighteen men gang-raped an eleven-year-old girl. The politician was portrayed as thinking it was the kid's own fault she got raped — and thus really her parents' fault since they were responsible for her — while the papers, in reporting on how the girl seemed to dress way above her age, cast unfortunate overtones of "Did you see how she was dressed? She was asking for it!"

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Jim Cornette displays this attitude when cutting a promo on how much better The Midnight Express is than the Street people Jimmy Valiant, Rocky King, and manager Big Momma only for her to show up and interrupt him.

-   _Chronicles of Darkness_:
    -   One supplement for _Mage: The Awakening_ features a town where a mage with strong ideas on wholesomeness and youth morality created a working that would keep teenagers away from sex, _especially_ "aberrant" forms of sex such as homosexuality or kink. The good news is, it's worked, as most of the youth have sublimated their sexual desires into other hobbies. The _bad_ news is if they ever give in to their sexual desires outside of the context of heterosexual marriage, it's a sin against the Karma Meter — with premarital sex being as bad as manslaughter, and homosexual or kinky sex being as bad as _torture_. Which means the Mage has effectively created a ticking time bomb for mass-producing sociopathic sexual sadists and serial killers. For Black Comedy, the mage, not being a great titan in social studies, centered the enchantment around a statue of the high school's namesake. Its name? _**Benjamin Franklin High.**_
    -   The supplement _Inferno_ features the Rider in Shameful Dreams, a Demon that personifies lust mixed with shame. A mage was so convinced that her sexuality was "inappropriate" that she severed it from her mind and banished it to Astral Space, where it mutated into the Rider and set off to victimize other believers in the trope.
-   In the furry pornographic tabletop game _FAPP_, everybody in the world is infected with a disease that causes immortality and Extreme Libido. One faction called the Prudes hates all sex and anyone who is caught engaging in sexual activity is either Made a Slave, forced to join the military, or imprisoned, and all of these will be forever due to the immortality. The society is naturally full of hypocrisy. Nobles can get away with all the sex they want as long as they do it in private and commoners caught having sex can often avoid punishment through bribery, often in the form of sex.
-   The _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ book _Possessed_ features an old man who spent many years standing with a bible in hand at the college gates, berating female students for their skimpy clothing. Turns out that his true motivation was that he enjoyed staring at beautiful young women and commenting on their bodies and clothing. The whole moral superiority thing was merely an excuse that he used to trick everyone (surely including himself) that his behavior was acceptable. To make it worse, indulging his hatred of beautiful young women and his self-inflicted sexual frustration opened him up to what can be called demonic possession. Having turned into a Formori minion of the Wyrm, he ends up attacking a young beautiful female coed _werewolf_, making himself the first kill in her new career as a slayer of wyrm-tainted monsters.

    Theatre 

-   Angelo in William Shakespeare’s _Measure for Measure_ considers himself wholly above carnal desire but is horrified when he finds himself sexually attracted to a virginal nun. In fact, this messes his head up so badly that he almost instantly descends into Then Let Me Be Evil and becomes one of the most duplicitous bastards in the whole of the Shakespearean canon.
-   Grace Chasity from the _Hatchetfield_ universe (specifically in _Abstinence Camp_ and _Nerdy Prudes Must Die_) is the self-appointed Moral Guardian of Hatchetfield High. She is extremely sexually repressed due to her religious upbringing, so when she becomes attracted to Jerk Jock Max, she panics and feels like a "dirty girl." Her mental state deteriorates from there. Her hatred of all things sexual eventually causes her to snap and declare that all "dirty dudes must die."

    Video Games 

-   _Divinity: Original Sin II_: Kniles' fundamentalist mother beat into him that abstinence and chastity are the greatest virtues in life. Now, they're the names of his daggers, he relieves his urges with torture and necrophilia, and his mother has no clue that he's widely known as "the Flenser".
-   The Vestal in _Darkest Dungeon_ is a religious hero, implied by the name to be chaste (though she can still visit the brothel). However, one of her trinkets is a salacious diary, she will frequently throw out baseless sexual accusations at her teammates when Afflicted, and her horniness played a significant part of her backstory.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Tsukihime_, this trope is more or less the entire reason for Michael Roa Valdamjong's Face–Heel Turn in the past. He became insane and evil because, as a man of the Church, he was unable to come to terms with his attraction to Arcueid (or even realize that it was love/lust that he was feeling for her).

    Web Comics 

-   Joyce from David Willis' works _It's Walky!_ and _Dumbing of Age_, both incarnations of her. In both, she was raised a strict fundamentalist Christian. She eventually overcomes this in _It's Walky!_ (and in fact, sex SAVES her boyfriend, Walky, or rather is responsible for his resurrection, turning the Sex Is Evil trope on its head. In _Dumbing of Age_, she is still battling her urges against her faith—and her being drugged at a party has done her no favors on that front.
-   In a series of strips in _Sinfest_ where Monique dressed as a Gypsy girl, at one point she ran into Seymour, who accused her of inflaming lust. She paraphrased Matthew 18:9 to imply that Seymour's just as inflamed.
-   In _Scandinavia and the World_, among the Anthropomorphic Personifications of countries, Faroe Islands. Since the Faroes are more religious than most of Scandinavia, he gets the whole repression thing full force. He also reacts to Denmark and Netherlands petting in the same way as Sister Japan—with a Nosebleed.

    Web Original 

-   The satire newspaper _The Onion_ commented on the scandal of the Catholic Church covering up for pedophile priests (by moving them around instead of firing & reporting them, thus covering their tracks and giving them access to new victims) with a fake announcement from the Pope, who announced that God will forgive the children for their crime of leading his priests into temptation.
-   The idea that women must dress and behave modestly and demurely so as not to tempt men or cause them to sin is deconstructed in this essay, as well as in this one by the same author.
-   In the _Cracked_ article 5 Ways Modern Men Are Trained to Hate Women, #3 is "We Think You're Conspiring With Our Boners to Ruin Us".
    
    When that happens, when we get that boner at the funeral, we get mad at the girl showing the cleavage. Because we, ourselves, our own rational personality that knows right from wrong and appropriate from inappropriate, knows this is a bad place to get a boner. So it comes off like cleavage girl is conspiring with our penis to screw us over.
    
    Is that a crazy thing to think? Yep! That's why it's so frustrating, especially if you don't have a whole lot of emotional maturity, and grew up with male role models who had even less.
    
    No, this doesn't excuse anything. Obviously, "She was asking for it!" is still a bullshit rape defense. All I'm saying is when you see guys actually get annoyed or angry at the sight of a girl showing too much skin, or if you see them eager to degrade or humiliate the girls at the strip club, this is why. It's probably why some Muslims make their women cover themselves head to toe.
    

    Western Animation 

-   The controversial _South Park_ episode "Red Hot Catholic Love" combines this trope with Pedophile Priest. Due to the law forbidding catholic priests from marrying, the priests have decided to turn to sexually abusing children instead since this isn't specifically prohibited by the Holy Document of Vatican Law. Aside from the alien priests of the planet Galgamesh who apparently practice pedophilia because the adult females of the species have enormous genitals lined with teeth.
