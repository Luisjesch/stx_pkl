Lots of times in fiction, during a climactic battle or a time of great peril, the main character in trouble will begin to hear the voices of people, oftentimes repeating what they told them earlier. This is to denote how stressed out the character is when under pressure, especially if they are or otherwise feel responsible for everything the voices are saying. If it's played seriously, it's a hallucination. If played non-seriously, it's just a memory/their imagination.

See also: Hearing Voices (when the voices are more vague), Floating Advice Reminder (where in this trope it doesn't have to be an advice).

Usually a precursor to a Heroic BSoD or other collapse of some kind, particularly when there's a lot of voices that start to overlap.

Contrast Spirit Advisor for when those voices are real and coming from a definite source, although only certain people may hear a Spirit Advisor. See also Flashback-Montage Realization, where a character remembers previous images and lines of dialogue during a "Eureka!" Moment.

-   Happens through external means in _Naruto_ — the titular character gets trapped in Itachi's illusion and his body parts start revealing faces of Kakashi, Sakura, Sasuke, and Gaara all berating him for being a failure.
-   Happens to Lucy in _Elfen Lied_ in her flashbacks when she feels rejected and humiliated, particularly after she finds out Kouta lied to her. She visualises Kouta telling her he was only interested in her because he thought of her as an exotic animal and goes into a furious, murderous rampage.
-   Implied to happen in the last two episodes of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ to the main characters, and later only with Shinji, after Instrumentality starts.

These include her grandpa telling her off for being hot-headed and stupid. Famke gets this in full colour 3-D stereo with Dolby sound. She also wonders what the previous occupant of the Chamber saw and heard from _her_ life which resulted in her ending up in the School Infirmary on heavy sedatives.
