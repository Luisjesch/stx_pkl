_Meet the cop who can't be stopped._

One step up from the Cowboy Cop who enters Hot Pursuit with no regard for their own safety or anyone else's, here you have the police who have the equipment, the powers, or whatever else that puts them above and beyond the capabilities of the average police officer. This is common to the point where one of the Stock Superhero Day Jobs is police work, though they don't always do both at once.

Often takes the form of a Superhero who works for the police, a Cyborg, or a Humongous Mecha. A particularly Badass Normal can qualify if the criminals they chase are superpowered and they are not.

Overlaps with the Vampire Detective.

Not to be confused with Always Gets His Man, which is a freakishly perfect cop (though the tropes can obviously overlap). It also does not usually overlap with Police Psychic, which is when a psychic helps the actual cops out in some way, although there are examples of that trope who are actual members of law enforcement.

Compare and contrast this trope with Super-Soldier and Military Superhero.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Used in many works by Shirow Masamune:
    -   _Appleseed_'s ESWAT units (mecha).
    -   Section 9 Public Security in _Ghost in the Shell_ and _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_. Cyborg bodies, advanced weapons, Tachikomas, super-hacker skills, etc. It helps that most of their field operatives are former soldiers.
    -   Averted with _Patlabor_. They _could_ be Supercops, but regulations have them stuck in the station until a crook brings out his own Humongous Mecha. For regular criminals, they have to go on foot just like all other cops and face the same obstacles.
    -   _Dominion Tank Police_ probably counts, since the heroes are cops... with TANKS. Really BIG tanks, at that. And unlike the _Patlabor_ dudes, these fellows DO move against any and all crime, with superior firepower through and through. Unfortunately for the city, they're also all Cowboy Cops... can you say 'Collateral Damage'?
-   In _Lyrical Nanoha_, most named members of the Time-Space Administration Bureau's Enforcer division would fall under this. However, special mention goes to Fate Testarossa-Harlaown, who also happens to be a genetically-engineered Artificial Mage.
-   _Codename: Sailor V_ and its better-known spin-off _Sailor Moon_ have a strange example in Minako Aino, alias Sailor V and Sailor Venus: Minako has a rather vocal dislike for police officers, yet both the manga and anime continuities show her befriending some officers and acting like a Japanese cop when superheroing (and getting mistaken for a Super Cop by a youma during her early days as Sailor V), with the anime even having her as a Super Cop in London for a while as part of her background and the _Codename: Sailor V_ manga ending with Minako accepting to work for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, meaning she was a Super Cop for the whole run of _Sailor Moon_ without it ever coming up. She _still_ dislikes your average Japanese cop. In fact, she initially took on the role, not for justice, but to stick it to Tokyo's cops by making fools out of them.
-   The title character of _Birdy the Mighty_. She has superhuman strength, speed, agility, and durability. She's also a bioengineered Super-Soldier.
-   _Dragon Ball_ has quite a few instances of these:
    -   Jaco the Galactic Patrolman will _not_ stop reminding you he's a member of a "super elite" police force (even adopting "Super Elite" as a pseudonym when he was stuck in East City for a while), and often shows superhuman prowess. However, he's quite low in the power totem pole, as in his solo series he flat-out admitted he'd have been no match for _any_ adult Saiyan back when they were still working for Frieza (by the time of _Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'_ he's grown strong enough to easily defeat Frieza's Mooks, but he was still no match for his stronger soldiers, let alone Frieza himself).
        -   To give a perspective, back in his solo series Jaco was the _weakest and less competent of the patrol_, and yet could easily kick a giant container of rocket fuel at dozens of kilometers in the air _without blowing it up_. Other members of the Patrol (among which there was a Namekian) were much more formidable-but in the end, they aren't capable of taking on Frieza and his army.
    -   As of _Resurrection F_ (and by extension, _Dragon Ball Super_), Krillin has joined Satan City's police force. Bear in mind that he is arguably the strongest non-augmented Earthling, with enough ki to slice the planet in two, if not destroy it outright. However, as he takes his job very seriously, he will only use the vehicles and equipment issued to him for their intended purposes, using his absurd power only as a last resort.
    -   When he returns in _Dragon Ball Super_, Android 17 is a park ranger, single-handedly defending an island with many rare animals from poachers. As the rare animals in general and the last minotaurus are extremely valuable on the black market, poachers generally show up in small armies with cannon-equipped armored cars and bazookas... And remain so outmatched that the only reason they last a few minutes against him is that he holds back to not damage the island or kill them.
    -   The Pride Troopers are an interplanetary police force in Universe 11, very similar to Universe 7's Galactic Patrol except in power: Toppo, the leader of the Pride Troopers, is strong enough to be training to become a God of Destruction, and Jiren is simply the mightiest mortal of all universes, stronger than even a _God of Destruction_ (as verified by Belmod, Universe 11's God of Destruction).
    -   Katopesla from Universe 3 is a Space Cop, and, thanks to his super suit, can fight in the Tournament of Power alongside the likes of Goku, Vegeta, and fellow Super Cops 17, Krillin and the Pride Troopers (and in fact went toe-on-toe with many of them without getting smashed).

    Comic Books 

-   Dan Garrett, the original _Blue Beetle_, was a police officer in Powered Armor.
-   _Marshal Law_: "I'm a hero hunter. I hunt heroes. Haven't found any yet."
-   Alan Moore's _Top 10_ series (and its spinoffs) is set in a city where all the cops are superheroes because **everyone** is.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Supes frequently has to remind people that he's _not_ one of these, but because since he has such a good relationship with the Metropolis PD and the citizens of Metropolis, they often treat him like one. Though at one point in the comics he did actually register in the police department so he could legally arrest supervillains.
    -   The Metropolis Special Crimes Unit (later the Metropolis Science Police) has Powered Armor and other gear to fight supervillains when Superman isn't available. They even had superhuman members briefly during the late '90s.
-   _Batman_: In stark contrast to most contemporary depictions of the character as a vigilante, during most of the Golden Age and Silver Age, Batman was a deputized officer of the Gotham City Police Department. While his precise official status is seldom explicitly brought up, he and Robin essentially functioned as special cops reporting to Commissioner Gordon, albeit cops who wore costumes and masks and used their own resources.
-   Orion Pax in _The Transformers (IDW)_ comics is a Point One Percenter and a genius investigator who routinely arrests dozens of criminals. This turns out to be good practice for when he becomes Optimus Prime.
-   _Judge Dredd_:
    -   While Dredd himself is not an example, being merely a very well-trained Badass Normal, the Justice Department have their own division of Psi-Judges, the most notable of which is Judge Anderson.
    -   One could say Judge Dredd is a Downplayed Example, since his eyes were replaced with Electronic Eyes after he travelled into a Bad Future, making him a low-key cyborg and boosting his already impressive marksman skills considerably. However, because they are electronic, they can also be an impediment under the right circumstances. Say, if a perp uses an EMP on him or an influential Dirty Cop with the proper access codes...
    -   Justice Department's history with robo-judges is... complicated. Most of the Mechanismo projects have failed because of bad AI, and even after the Day of Chaos, when they finally got most of the problems ironed out, they're still only used as back-up for human Judges. Some Judges are cyborgs, having lost one or more bodyparts in the line of duty, though these don't always afford superpowers.
    -   There's a What If? story where Joe Dredd himself was never cured of his lycanthropy after his encounter with a pack of werewolves. His Heroic Willpower allows him to regain control over his wolf form and he becomes a crimefighter in the Undercity.
-   Meet the _Savage Dragon_, the Chicago Police's best weapon against super-human crime. Taken even further because there have been many times when he's been able to handle superhuman rampages by talking down the suspect instead of applying violence like cops are trained to do.
-   _Rising Stars_: One of the supers hides his powers and works as a cop. When his secret is out and he's banned from working in uniform, his coworkers (who very much like having a superpowered ally) make him a custom one.
-   In the Elseworlds tale _Justice Riders_, Diana Prince is a super-powered sheriff in the Wild West.
-   _Nightwing_ served as a police detective in his civilian identity for a time.

    Film 

-   _Maniac Cop_: Matt Cordell was once considered to be a "supercop" by the media and his fellow officers in the NYPD, considering his merits. This carries over in later movies, both literally and figuratively.
-   One word: _RoboCop_. An officer dies and is rebuilt by the MegaCorp that owns Detroit's PD as a cybernetic anti-crime Immune to Bullets One-Man Army.
-   _Police Academy_ borders on this when the Ragtag Bunch of Misfits turn into Bunny Ears Lawyers. The animated series, _definitely_.
-   Of course, there's the movie _Short Time_ (a.k.a. _Super Cop,_ on some markets) in which the cop was trying to get killed in the line of duty before he retired in a few days because of a pretty bad case of Mistaken for Dying (and thus invoked Retirony) meeting Springtime for Hitler (and thus coming off as a Cowboy Cop).
-   In the _Police Story_ series, Jackie Chan (mostly) becomes this by necessity. The third movie is even called this in Western markets.
-   The _Super Fuzz_ movie, pictured above, with Terence Hill in the lead role.
-   _Scanner Cop_ and _Scanner Cop II_ are a set of B Movies about a cop with Psychic Powers. This doesn't just help him in dangerous situations with armed suspects or in interrogations, but the paperwork as well. He reviews a hundred case files in a few minutes, and can actually scan the office computer to speed up a facial composition.
-   The low-budget film _WolfCop_ is about an inept policeman who gets turned into a werewolf by way of a satanic ritual through no fault of his own. He's at least as competent in his Beast Man form as he is while drunk...

    Literature 

-   The Night Watch from _Discworld_ may fit in this trope. Living in a fantasy world, they've got trolls, dwarves, golems, zombies, vampires and werewolves in their ranks; and Carrot Ironfoundersson. Of course, criminals can also belong to any of those supernatural species, which makes The Watch even more impressive because their superpowered members don't necessarily have an edge because of their superpowers.
-   In the X-Wing Series, Corran Horn discovers that his father, who was part of the Corellian Security Force all his life and got Corran into it too, was the son and the student of a Jedi Knight. Both of them did rely a bit on their Force-sensitivity. _I, Jedi_ also notes that Corellian Jedi, including Corran's grandfather, tended to work closely with the Corellian Security Force on the tougher cases.
-   The Aurors (and also the poor forgotten Hit Wizards) of _Harry Potter_, including Aurors Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Mad-Eye Moody was a legend amongst them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Season 7 of _Arrow_ has Oliver Queen joining the Star City Police Department, as the exposure of his Secret Identity, coupled with anti-vigilante legislation, makes it impossible for him to continue to operate as a masked vigilante. He continues to wear the Green Arrow suit, albeit without the now-redundant hood and mask.
-   _The Boys (2019)_ has two villainous examples. Blue Hawk is a police-themed "superhero" and Politically Incorrect Villain who performs like a Rabid Cop, curb-stomping a black man he thinks looks suspicious. Arc Villain Soldier Boy is a Corrupted Character Copy of Captain America who was used as an attack dog by the government to do things like put down protests.
-   _Future Cop_ features an android programmed to be the perfect cop.
-   In his first episode of _Heroes,_ cop Matt Parkman is able to telepathically hear a little girl calling for help. In later episodes and seasons, he uses his powers to also try to help people, even when he is no longer a cop.
-   The robot Yoyo from the TV series _Holmes & Yoyo_.
-   Three _Kamen Rider_ shows have featured superpowered cops tasked with dealing with the show's villains:
    -   _Kamen Rider Agito_ had the Kamen Rider G3 suit and its variants, which were worn by several different operators throughout the show, although Makoto Hikawa was the primary wearer.
    -   _Kamen Rider Double_ had police superintendent Ryu Terui, who would become Kamen Rider Accel to deal with Dopant-related crime waves.
    -   _Kamen Rider Drive_ puts its super cop front and center as the title character.
-   Most Metal Heroes take on this role. In fact, the first three, Gavan, Sharivan and Shaider, all share the title Uchuu Keiji, which literally translates to Space Sheriff.
    -   The "Galaxy Federal Police" all three of them report to effectively functions as an organization of Super Cops, with the Space Sheriffs being One Man Armies sent to defend planets from the inexplicable number of alien crime syndicates marauding across the galaxy.
    -   Rei Yagyu and her partner Rin Asuka in _Sekai Ninja Sen Jiraiya_, both being ninjas who work for Interpol.
    -   The titular protagonist of _Kidou Keiji Jiban_ was a rookie detective who was fatally injured in an attack by the resident Nebulous Evil Organisation and rebuilt into a superpowered Cyborg, a la RoboCop.
    -   The protagonists in the "Rescue Police Trilogy" all wear Powered Armor that makes them more durable and agile.
-   Has occurred a few times in _Super Sentai_ (and by extension, _Power Rangers_):
    -   Signalman from _Gekisou Sentai Carranger_ (and the Blue Senturion from _Power Rangers Turbo_) is a Super **Traffic** Cop.
    -   _Mirai Sentai Timeranger_/_Power Rangers Time Force_ is about a team of Time Police from the year 3000, chasing a villain who travelled a millennium back in time with an entire prison of criminals in tow.
    -   The S.P.D. from _Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger_ (where it stands for Special Police Dekaranger) and _Power Rangers S.P.D._ (where it's Space Patrol Delta) plays the police theme much heavier, down to having Finishing Moves that can only be used when the team's superpowered badges judge an enemy guilty. The team even have a "SWAT Mode" as their Super Mode.
    -   _Kaitou Sentai Lupinranger VS Keisatsu Sentai Patranger_ features a team of Super Cop heroes competing with a team of Phantom Thief ones to get their hands on the lost fortune of Arsène Lupin.
-   _Witchblade_: Sara Pezzini is a detective in the NYPD homicide department who gains the power of a magic artifact known as the Witchblade.
-   _Roswell, New Mexico_: Max Evans is a sheriff's deputy with alien powers, though he rarely uses them on the job.

    Radio 

-   _The Brewing Network_: In Lunch Meet, when an article mentions a police officer by the name of J. R. McKnight, they immediately make jokes about him being this tough, no-nonsense cop who can take care of anything (as well as using a fake voice to give him lines). From then on, when they talk about situations that need a tough hand to fix it, they mention that J. R. McKnight is on the case.

    Tabletop Games 

-   "Officer Prometheus" from _Silver Age Sentinels_. A combination between the powers of the Human Torch, the mentality of Captain America, and an allegiance to the NYPD (well, Empire City PD, actually). He prefers not to think of himself as a (super-) hero (even actively declining membership with the local super-teams), but rather as just one more cop — one that can be an equalizer when his brother cops have to deal with a super-criminal.
-   The Adeptus Arbites of _Warhammer 40,000_, due to their paramilitary like nature and being _Judge Dredd_'s expy.
-   The policing forces of the various human factions in _Infinity_.

    Video Games 

-   _ESWAT_. Once your character achieves chief rank he gets a cyber suit with turbo-thrusters and armor.
-   _Future Cop: L.A.P.D._, where you play a heavily armed Transforming Mecha fighting all kinds of criminals.
-   _City of Heroes_ features Blue Steel, a Memetic Badass and the only major superhero who works directly for the police force. There are also cops in Powered Armor, cops with Psychic Powers, and the Awakened division of alien symbiote-infused cops. There's also nothing stopping player character concepts from being cops.
-   You play one in _Crackdown_. Morality optional.
-   Konoko from _Oni_. Helps that she was secretly bred to be a One-Woman Army capable of handling anything the Syndicate could field.
-   A rare glitch in _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City_ would sometimes render a single random police officer invincible. There were also rumors that he could arrest you anywhere, including magically teleporting from the ground onto your helicopter and playing the arrest animation.
-   _Mortal Kombat_ has Kurtis Stryker. Just a regular guy but packs some ordnance to make up for it. Fights otherworldly monsters so he's going a bit above the line of duty.
-   Chun-Li of _Street Fighter_ is an Interpol agent, always hot on the trail of M. Bison.
-   Lei Wulong of _Tekken_, which makes sense since he is an Expy of Jackie Chan.
-   _Project × Zone_ puts Chun-Li together with Rikiya Busujima from _Zombie Revenge_ and Bruno Delinger from _Dynamite Cop_/_Die Hard Arcade_.
-   _Astral Chain_ has you playing as a police officer wielding weapons named Legions. Most people are unable to see them. People who wield a Legion are synchronized to it, and with a high enough sync rate (as you are) your own abilities are boosted and you are able to control the legion as easily as your own body.
-   _Disco Elysium_'s protagonist, an unnamed police detective, can hear the city's voice talking to him. This has enabled him to close cases that were _impossible_ for other cops, many of whom bemusedly recognize his ability.
-   The _Trails Series_ has the Special Support Section, protagonists of the Crossbell games. Officially they're just a branch of the local police department meant to deal with street crimes. However, throughout the series they've dealt with everything from criminal organizations to doomsday cults and have risen from being seen as plucky underdogs to the heroes of the city to eventually helping save the continent from a dark god in the climax of _Trails of Cold Steel IV_
-   _The Scramble Vice_, has the titular group. Officially designated as the 9th Mobile Unit, they are a special task force that employ a Humongous Mecha to take down powerful criminals that also use a mech. They have a reputation for their destructive tendencies, as cities are often engulfed in flames whenever they are deployed.
-   _X Com Chimera Squad_ focuses on a special forces unit of police that consists of both humans and the remnants of the alien invaders from _XCOM 2_ who have chosen to live among the humans.

    Web Animation 

-   The titular _Inferno Cop_ pursues criminals and other miscreants using the powers of Hell. His police car's siren lights are actually flames.

    Webcomics 

-   _Axe Cop_, who upon finding the perfect fireman axe uses it to behead every evil he encounters while building an ever-expanding team of do-gooders.
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ space cops wear "strength rings" which give them Super-Strength and Flight. Officer Krelch has additional powers by virtue of being a Cyborg.
-   In _Grrl Power_ ARCHON is organized under the DOD, making them technically Military Superheroes, but most of their work is based on policing supers.
-   _Inhibit_: Urquhart trains variant officers who deal with variant-related crimes.

    Western Animation 

-   The animated series _C.O.P.S. (Animated Series)_ was about a team of these.
-   _Inspector Gadget_. In the revival series, he gets promoted to a secret agent (and becomes Lieutenant Gadget).
-   From _ThunderCats_, Mandora the Evil Chaser.
-   The metalbending police force from _The Legend of Korra_ have Supernatural Martial Arts on their side, which is pretty impressive against innocent non-Benders. Against Benders or non-Benders who prepared to fight them (such as the Equalists) they are just a Redshirt Army. Notably they suffer from Crippling Overspecialization, as they never use conventional earthbending, even in cases it would be more effective. They do seem to learn their lesson, as the police force becomes more diverse in later seasons.
