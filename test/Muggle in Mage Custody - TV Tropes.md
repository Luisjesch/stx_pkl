A particular type of relationship involving an ordinary, non-magical character at the mercy of a mage, a god, or another kind of supernatural being. The muggle's status in the relationship may be either akin to that of a beloved child or to that of a servant or a slave... or something in-between. Accordingly, the magician may reward the muggle with miracles and/or punish them with curses.

Such a relationship may be depicted both positively and negatively. Mostly negative depictions date all the way back to Celtic Mythology, in which fairies kidnapped humans and held them captive in their world (often for years, decades or centuries), having fun at their expense and viewing them in the same way as we view pets. However, at some time around the 19th century, with the advent of the Bildungsroman genre, it became commonplace to depict the trope in a positive light. These kinds of works usually have religious overtones and use the relationship between a supernatural creature and an ordinary human as a metaphor for the relationship between God and humanity: in those, even if the "mage" has to resort to tough methods sometimes, it is ultimately for the "muggle"'s good, to enlighten them, and to help them become a better person. Some of the most prominent examples are _The Adventures of Pinocchio_, _Mary Poppins_, and the works of C. S. Lewis.

May sometimes overlap with Muggle–Mage Romance; contrast Muggle Foster Parents. For a large-scale version of this, when _the society_ as a whole is governed by magic users, see The Magocracy, Sorcerous Overlord, and Benevolent Mage Ruler.

See also The Renfield for a vampire-specific subtrope; also compare Raised by the Supernatural and Muggle Born of Mages. Another frequently overlapping trope is Mistress and Servant Boy, when the "mage" is an older woman, and the "muggle" is a younger man.

-   Inverted in _Rozen Maiden_, where ordinary humans become "masters" of magical dolls. Played straight with the protagonist Jun Sakurada and his doll Shinku though, since in spite of formally being Shinku's master, he is de facto her slave (she is fond of ordering him around and slapping him whenever he disobeys her orders).
-   In _Spirited Away_, an ordinary girl Chihiro becomes a servant of the evil witch Yubaba, and has to do menial work for her in her bathhouse for spirits.
-   In _Xxx Holic_, the protagonist Kimihiro Watanuki is plagued by visions of ghosts and monsters, and asks the witch Yuuko Ichihara to help him. In exchange for her help, he agrees to become her de facto slave: she does genuinely care for him, but also enjoys having fun at his expense.

    Comic Books 

-   In one of the issues of _Donald Duck & Co_, released by Egmont, Donald and Scrooge are on an underwater expedition when they meet the old wise sea king Saltomon. Saltomon hasn't had guests for about a thousand years, so he wants Donald and Scrooge to stay with him just for a little while... a hundred years or two. The protagonists manage to leave, and then the villainous Beagle Boys get stuck with Saltomon instead.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _D.N.Angel_ fanfic _Of Darkness and Light_, an orphaned boy called Yami asks to stay at the temple of the oracle Lunara, and becomes her servant. He has to obey Lunara's orders, and is forbidden to leave the temple without her permission (and occasionally she also makes fun of him).

-   _Maleficent_ has the titular sorceress Maleficent and her muggle servant Diaval. The usual mode of communication between them is Snark-to-Snark Combat, and whenever she gets tired of it, she transforms him (back) into a raven. There is also some romantic tension between them.

    Gamebooks 

-   The _Fighting Fantasy_ entry _Creature of Havoc_ has several bad endings of this sort:
    -   In one of them, an unnamed Wizard in red robes puts a Control Creature spell on you, making you his slave for the rest of your life.
    -   In another, a witch gives you the Potion of Obedience, after which you come to see her as your benevolent master, and remain with her for the rest of your life.
    -   Downplayed in another ending, in which you become one of the henchmen of the evil sorcerer Zharradan Marr.
-   Several entries from the _Give Yourself Goosebumps_ series also feature bad endings of this kind, in which you end up as a slave to some supernatural being:
    -   _Deep in the Jungle of Doom_: In one ending, Cronby the Troll hypnotizes you and makes you his slave till the end of your life.
    -   _Hocus-Pocus Horror_: In one of the endings, you end up on an eternal probation with the evil magician Mysterio. In another, you are enslaved by a Jackass Genie.

    Literature 

-   In _The Adventures of Pinocchio_, the relationship between Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy is of this kind. He lives with the Fairy in her house, she takes care of him, but when he misbehaves, she often resorts to Prank Punishments like making his nose grow for lying or giving him fake food.
-   In _Ascendance of a Bookworm_, orphans are often slaves in all but name, while most of those who can afford to purchase them from whichever local institution cares for orphans by default are part of the noble Supernatural Elite. The practicalities of the dynamic depend entirely on the noble. In worse-case scenarios, the orphan was _better off_ pre-purchase.
-   _Black Dawn_: In the Dark Kingdom, which is ruled by vampires and has witches and shapeshifters in its ruling class, this is done _en masse_ to humans; all humans in the Kingdom are slaves to the Night People. Hunter Redfern has grand plans for the Night World to Take Over the World and enslave the entire human population.
-   In _The Changeling Prince_ by Vivian Vande Velde, the protagonist Welland is a slave of the evil sorceress Daria.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_: _The Voyage of the Dawn Treader_ has a borderline case between this and Benevolent Mage Ruler. The eccentric magician Coriakin governs an island inhabited by dwarf-like creatures known as Dufflepuds, but the Dufflepud community is small, Coriakin has no formal title, and his role is more akin to that of a caregiver than a ruler.
-   Taran, in the _Chronicles of Prydain_, is the ward of the great enchanter Dallben, whom he regards as his master. Taran has no magical ability of his own and in fact has absolutely no idea why Dallben is the one rearing him or where his real parents are; but he has nowhere else to go, and he sincerely loves both Dallben and his other (non-magical) guardian Coll, so he stays. Only at the end of the series is it finally revealed that Taran was an orphaned infant whom Dallben found and decided to rear in the hopes of fulfilling a great prophecy.
-   _Discworld_ has an odd example in that the "muggle" is actually a wizard, but is rarely seen to use magic: Death's manservant Albert was once Alberto Malich, a very powerful wizard who decided to cast the Death-summoning ritual of Ash-Kente in reverse to gain immortality. Instead, he found himself dragged into Death's realm but took on the position of Crusty Caretaker there, as he had very little time left in reality and the other options for immortality were less than pleasant or likely to succeed.
-   In _Doctrine of Labyrinths_, Felix casts the obligation d'ame on Mildmay in large part to keep him protected in the Mirador, as the contract makes them as one legally. But it still makes Mildmay his slave.
-   _The Faerie Queene_ has Amoret, who is captured and tortured by the Evil Sorcerer Busirane, with the intent of forcing her into becoming his lover.
-   In _Fairest of All_, the protagonists Siofra and Mahon are taken as slaves by the fairy King and Queen, and subsequently become their lovers.

-   _Land of Oz_: _The Marvelous Land of Oz_ is another negative example, with the main character Tip being raised by the wicked witch Mombi who constantly abuses him.
-   In _Mary Poppins_, the Banks children have a genuinely loving relationship of this kind with Mary. Most of the time, she takes them on exciting adventures, but when they misbehave, she can punish them by transporting them into a decidedly unfriendly magical world.
-   In _Master of Crows_ by Grace Draven, the protagonist Martise is a slave of the mage-priest Cumbria who promises to free her if she agrees to spy on a renegade sorcerer, the titular Master of Crows.

-   Played With in _Spice and Wolf_. Ordinary traveling merchant Kraft Lawrence encounters the wolf spirit/harvest goddess Holo, and they go on a journey together. Holo teases him by saying that she's Lawrence's mistress who has the right to order him around due to her status as a goddess, but in reality, she hasn't adapted yet to the changes that took place while she was stuck in Pasloe, so the power dynamic between them is more ambiguous.
-   In _Tam Lin_, the titular character is a mortal who had been captured by the Fairy Queen and remained with her in her world ever since. The protagonist Janet eventually manages to set him free.
-   _Uprooted_: The Dragon is a wizard and feudal lord whose only "tax" on his subjects is to take a local girl every ten years to serve him. The locals assume the worst; the truth is he has no ill intentions, and the girls usually just use their pay to move to a nicer city afterwards. Zig-zagged when the protagonist is chosen and soon realizes she has magical potential herself.
-   In _The Wise Man's Fear_, Felurian, a magical Fae creature, seduces and enslaves human men with her charms, bending them to her will. Eventually they either die of sexual exhaustion, or are driven mad by lust after she abandons them.

-   _Dragon Quest VIII_ has David, a servant to the magician Dominico whom the player's party meets in the town of Arcadia. David shows nothing but gratitude towards his master for taking him in when he was alone and starving, even though Dominico constantly bullies and humiliates him and wonders even to himself why he keeps David around. It turns out that David is actually descended from a great sage who transferred his powers to Dominico's family in exchange for them protecting his descendants. So while David himself is a muggle, he's still linked to Dominico by magic, even though neither is initially aware of it.
-   _King's Quest_:
    -   _King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human_ features a negative version of this.

-   Rufus and Amberley are apprentices to the Dream Maker in _The Dreamstone_, often helping him in his occupation of making dreams and protecting the titular stone, as well as assisting his allies the Wuts, an army of equally powerful mages. This relationship is generally closer to a paid occupation and more benevolent than many other examples, though odd jokes slip in later in the show that the two are often errand runners volunteered for grunt work their far more powerful authority figures would be far better suited for.
-   In _Over the Garden Wall_, an ordinary girl Lorna is being raised by the sorceress Auntie Whispers, who uses a magic bell to force her to work constantly. Auntie Whispers insists that she has no choice, as otherwise Lorna would "fall into wickedness."
