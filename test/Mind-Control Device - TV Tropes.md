_"My remote controller's more of a remote control-her!"_

This is the device that the villain (usually) will use to keep the hero, townspeople, or Mr./Mrs. Random Supporting Character in thrall. It has been used countless times in stories across many different types of media, whether it be as a Plot Device, MacGuffin, and even a key part of a Very Special Episode.

While these devices tend to fall into two general categories, either broadcasting "hypno-waves" at any luckless viewer for a one-time treatment, or are somehow attached to the victim's body (usually the head), they ultimately know no shape and can come in nearly any specific form:

That sword you just picked up? _Hope you like being a slave to the evil overlord._

That mask that looks so good on you? _Hope you can control the demonic power inside._

That shampoo you're using? _Dr. D's BrainWashing Shampoo and Cranium Rinse._

That bracelet the street vendor gave you? _Welcome to the most dangerous cult in the world._

See Mind Control, Mind-Control Eyes and More than Mind Control for the effects of these devices. May be the result of televising a person with the power of Hypnotic Eyes. See also: Power Perversion Potential for the inevitable result in some viewers. May require the target to be Forced to Watch a transmission of some kind.

Super-Trope of Subliminal Seduction, Hypno Ray, and Hypno Trinket.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Battle Club_ has the NOB Bracelet an amulet that contains the manipulators ki in a charm. It allows the manipulator to observe and influence the wearer with the amulet to the point of mind control.
-   While it's not its intended purpose, in _Death Note_, Light realizes that the Death Note rule of being able to specify the circumnstances behind a person's death can effectively be used to control their mind until the moment they die.
-   The Black Gears of _Digimon Adventure_. Everyone infected with these become Brainwashed and Crazy minions of Devimon.
    -   _Digimon Adventure 02_ has the Dark Rings made by Ken during his reign as the Digimon Emperor. Anyone captured by these becomes his slave, including partner Digimon like Greymon. However, they're only effective on Digimon from the Champion level below and do very little to control Ultimates, as seen with Andromon and _especially_ SkullGreymon. Ken remedies this issue by putting three Dark Rings together to form a Dark Spiral, which is able to more easily control Ultimate levels.
-   One shows up in episode 7 of the _Dirty Pair_ TV series to control Joanca. Kei spots it almost immediately.
-   Several gadget of _Doraemon_ have this power, each one operating differently.
-   In _Elfen Lied_, Mariko's four clones and Lucy's half-brother have mind-control devices implanted in their foreheads that prevent them from being evil Diclonii and makes them perfectly controllable.

-   Colress's device in the Episode N arc of _Pokémon: The Series_... and Team Rocket had one too in the Orange Islands. The Colress one turned Pokémon into mindless fighting machines while making them stronger.
-   Shampoo of _Ranma ½_ uses hypnotic pressure points, mind-control mushrooms, and memory-erasing shampoo at various points to further her sinister plots. The plots usually don't work, the items/techniques work flawlessly. Not only that, in the final story arc she is _imprisoned_ in a _mind-control egg_ and emerges the slave of the bad guys.
-   In two episodes of _Science Ninja Team Gatchaman_, the Galactor organization uses a mind-warping ray to turn innocent civilians into murderous, rioting mobs.
-   _Shugo Chara!_ mainly has X-Eggs and now they've took it a step further. Now they have Question Eggs which turn people into DARK Chara Naris.

    Card Games 

    Comic Books 

-   A _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_ comic had Gadget and a bunch of other characters hypnotized by heart-shaped necklaces that turned out to be from Fat Cat and resulted in them being used as zombie slaves to build his latest invention.
-   _Cybersix_: Julian's friend, Detective Henrique, and other officers in the Meridiana police force are brainwashed by José's new mind-control device, ordered to patrol the city streets for Cybersix.
-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_:
    -   Subverted in "The Hypno Gun" by Carl Barks. The titular Hypno Ray is in fact just a harmless toy gun that Huey, Dewey and Louie _pretend_ to hypnotize one another with... however, Donald, overhearing them, thinks that it's a _real_ hypno gun. Donald is, in fact so convinced that the hypno gun works that it actually _does_ work on him, even if it doesn't work on anyone else.
    -   A late fifties comic had Donald buy a pair of hypnotic glasses to try and get his nephews to obey him.
-   _The DCU_:
    -   A _Justice League of America_ issue in the Bronze Age has a scientist invent a "re-memory" ray gun — it causes its targets to remember making decisions favorable to the wielder of the device. It's amazingly convenient — he doesn't even have to tell them what he wants, they just come up with something on their own. Naturally, he does just what you would do with such power: steal the plankton from Earth's oceans and sell it to an alien who just happens to pop into his lab looking for a solution to his world's environmental problems. Hey, The '70s, man...
    -   _Legends of the Dead Earth_: In _Batman_ Annual #20, the children of New Gotham are implanted with a mind control chip by the City Controllers once they reach a certain age. The Batman cyborg who protects the city prevents this from being done to three children.
    -   _Supergirl_: In "The Super-Steed of Steel", a villain called Vostar uses a "mental command helmet" to influence Comet the Super-Horse's emotions and force him to do his bidding.
    -   _Superman_: A post-Woodstock adventure has him reporting on a series of rock concerts. Mass violence breaks out at show after show, seemingly prompted by the lyrics. It turns out that a villain is using a mind-control device behind the scenes.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Before having its powers redefined and limited to truth-telling, Wonder Woman's lasso used to be able to force any wrapped in it to obey the one holding it, which was used against Diana on multiple occasions.

-   _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (Marvel)_ has the Brainwave Scanner courtesy of Doctor Venom, as well as the S.N.A.K.E. armor.
-   The Yellow Crown in _Hexed_ enables the user to mind control everyone around them, but at the same time, something else is controlling them, and after a few days, their head goes boom from the strain.
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   The Serpent Crown is a mind-control device used to channel the power of Set, an Elder God. Many superheroes have fought villains attempting to conquer the world in the thrall of Set.
    -   The Ringmaster, with his hypno-spiral top hat, has battled nearly every superhero in the Marvel Universe at one point or another. (And lost, as supervillains tend to do.)
    -   Issue #1 of _The Awesome Slapstick_ has the Mediocritizer, which turns ordinary students into boring, unimaginative drones for the Overlord of Dimension X.
    -   _Deadpool_/_Great Lakes Avengers_ Summer Fun crossover: Subverted. The story's mind-control device just makes its targets drunk.
    -   The _Squadron Supreme_ limited series features the title heroes using a "behavior modification" device to brainwash convicted criminals (at first...). The ethical issues that arise are a source of friction for the team. The Squadron themselves have been mind-controlled often enough that it's been lampshaded both in comics (an issue of _The Avengers_ claims that whenever they run into the Squadron, they assume that they're mind-controlled and about to attack until proven otherwise) and in games (the _Marvel Saga_ RPG stats for Squadron members list susceptibility to mind-control powers among their weaknesses).
-   In the _Missile Mouse_ comic "Rescue on Tankium3", the villains of the book use devices that attach to a person's head to control them to control the males of the titular planet to mine for the Cosmic-Cola Company.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (IDW)_: Dr. Starline uses a glove that can hypnotize people, among other things.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_ Recursive Fanfiction _Abraxas: The Clash of Silver_: Apex Cybernetics were planning to lobotomize the other Titans and put mind control devices in their brains after they killed and usurped Godzilla using Mechagodzilla, but their plan never gets that far thanks to Mechagodzilla turning on them.
-   _Facing the Future Series_: Vlad has developed a small, metallic ring version of Nocturne's dream helmet technology that is capable of knocking anyone out as well as leaving them susceptible to hypnotic commands. He intended to use these to take control of Maddie and Danny.
-   In the _Power Rangers_ fic _Forever Yellow_, it is discovered that a version of Venjix has been created in the main _Power Rangers_ reality, with this version having developed a form of mind control to make humans its slaves. However, this form of mind control is only effective on men as the project that created Venjix was staffed exclusively by male scientists by relative coincidence, allowing for a team of female Yellow Rangers to be assembled to defeat Venjix as they won't be vulnerable to the mind control.
-   The _Halloween Unspectacular_ series has a few examples:
    -   The titular object in "Remy's Ring", which gives Remy the power to turn other people into his puppets.
    -   In "Karma Punishment", Gaz gains possession of a machine which allows her to control people like video game characters.
    -   The seventh Story Arc ultimately reveals that PURITY's latest plan involves brain implants in all members of the U.S. military that make them drones. It's specifically titled in-universe after Order 66 by a pop-culture obsessed villain.
-   _The Meaning of Harmony_: The Forge of Laughter contains a variation of this, which makes the ponies think this particular Forge lacks the focusing crystals the others have, and not really care about it whatsoever despite the importance of the crystals.
-   _Origins_: Jakobs fits its clone army with these, though it only kicks in if someone wants it to. Otherwise, the clones remain free-thinking and able to make their own decisions. Also contains a sort of Explosive Leash element in that any clone may be terminated by a signal from home as well.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: The Piscine Stone, which only works on sealife. (Clearly inspired by the Trident of Fish Command from base D&D.)
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: Multiple:
    -   The dungeon hearts do this to a minor degree with Keeper minions. It's used as an explanation for why Being Tortured Makes You Evil in the _Dungeon Keeper_ setting itself, as most minions can't easily break the bonds the Dungeon Heart places on them. Jadeite also creates a mind control headband to contain Baron Liepold, and its temporarily effective, but he eventually fights it off.
    -   In "Odd Discoveries", a crystal related to a God of Evil known as "The Unraveller" is revealed to have such powers when used by a monsterized fairy.
-   _Mutant Ninja Turtles Gaiden_ puts this to immediate use at the start of the series, giving us a chance to watch the turtles try to kill each other, bringing their emotional hot spots to the forefront, and allowing the readers to realize that with this much blood and agony, the webcomic certainly isn't going to be as kid-friendly as the cartoon.
-   Possibly, the Pokeballs in _New World_. When a Pokémon is caught in one, they are mentally compelled to do whatever the trainer instructs them to do. It is implied that their name acts as an implanted Trigger Phrase.
-   The saliva of a rabid snail combined with human DNA in _One Less Lonely Gurl_.
-   Brox's Kiss, the hot pink short sword, in _With Strings Attached_. It works only on people of the opposite sex from the wielder. Besides being used on both John and Paul at different times, it was used to take control of a bunch of men in a crazy scheme to invade Ketafa. Paul snaps it over his knee at the end of the book.

-   In _Aladdin_, Jafar hypnotizes people with the eyes of his magical cobra head staff.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   This is the invaders' sole weapon in _Aliens in the Attic_.
-   In _The Avengers (2012)_, Loki's staff device has this as one of its secondary functions, used by tapping the tip of the staff on the victim's sternum. It doesn't work on Tony Stark, thanks to the Arc Reactor in his chest.
-   Subverted in _Batman Returns_ with the Penguin's spiral-patterned umbrella:
    
    **Maximillian 'Max' Shreck:** What is that, supposed to hypnotize me?  
    **The Penguin:** No, just give you a splitting headache.
    
-   _Battle in Outer Space_: The Natalians implant devices in Dr. Ahmed and Iwomura's brains to control them and make them turn traitor to Earth.
-   In _Flash Gordon (1980)_, Emperor Ming hypnotizes Dale Arden with his ring.
-   In _Ghostbusters II_, the woman on _World of the Psychic_ claims that the alien at the Holiday Inn used such a device to get her into his hotel room. "He used some kind of a ray or mind-control device..."
-   A hand-held version appears in _Hairspray_, used by a psychiatrist (John Waters himself) hired by Penny's mother to hypnotize her into dating white boys. He also uses a cattle prod.

-   The first _The Naked Gun_ film has this as the main weapon of the villains.
-   _Our Man Flint_: A rotating wheel device is used to hypnotize women and turn them into pleasure slaves for men.
-   The Genie in _Pretty Cool Too_ is a mobile phone that makes people obey whatever its user commands.
-   The golden mask in _The Pumaman_.
-   The parasites in _Upstream Color_ are an organic version of this trope. People who get infected are highly suggestible to any assertion. A thief uses this ability to control people's actions by making claims like, "My face is made of the same substance as the sun. You can't look directly at it."
-   In _Wild Wild West_, Artemus Gordon uses one to gain information about the Big Bad's plans.
-   Stryker keeps mutants in his thrall with the help of a drug made from a psychic mutant's spinal fluid in _X2: X-Men United_.

    Literature

-   The 3D Hypno-Ring from _Captain Underpants_.
-   In _The Chronicles of Professor Jack Baling_, Lydia uses one of these on Jack at the beginning of the second episode. It causes extreme feelings of disassociation in whoever hears it, temporarily submerging the afflicted individual’s conscious thoughts.
-   Trombophone Music in _The City of Dreaming Books_. While we see a taste of it early in the novel, exactly how powerful it is doesn't become apparent until the very end.
-   In _Divergent_, the Tracking Chips placed in every Dauntless member control them and ultimately lead to the Dauntless members, aside from Divergents, being controlled into attacking Abnegation.
-   This trope is the whole reason for Marc Cabot's _Dreams of Control_ series, including the novel _Maestro_, which includes a mind-control machine called the Pitchpipe based on harmonics.
-   In _End of Watch_, the villain uses handheld game consoles to take control of people's minds through a pre-loaded game whose demo screen (which already has a mildly hypnotic effect on some people) is modified to become _very_ hypnotic, allowing him to manipulate their thoughts or even take over their minds.
-   The wiggly thing from the evil horses in _The Fate of the Fallen_.
-   _The Finder's Stone Trilogy_: The title objects of _Azure Bonds_ are magic tattoos that compel the amnesiac Alias to carry out the whims of unknown powers. It turns out that she's an Artificial Human and that the bonds also act as a brand or signature of their work.
-   In Jack Chalker's _G.O.D. Inc._ series, the Hypnoscanner is shown to have serious Power Perversion Potential.
-   The Imperius curse from _Harry Potter_.
-   In the later _Honor Harrington_ novels, a rogue planet of eugenicists called Mesa develops a nano-virus that is capable of compelling behavior out of its victims. It is used several times to stage assassinations and get rid of key enemies and is notable in the series for being initially dismissed as impossible because they've had mind control tech for centuries, but every military has its people protected against it.
-   In _Ice Crown_, the crowns do this to entire kingdoms, though somewhat selectively; once she's no longer in the princess's presence, Roane starts to wonder why she was obsessed with helping her.
-   _Martha Speaks_: The book _Good Dog Martha_ focuses on an unscrupulous dog trainer using mind-control collar devices to create perfectly obedient dogs.
-   _A Master of Djinn_: The Ring of Sulayman, a ring that can control all djinn.
-   In _The Mouse Watch_, Dr. Thornpaw's Evil Plan is to subdue and eliminate the human population of New York City, allowing rats to take over. To accomplish this, he uses R.A.T.S. agents, plus a drone stolen from Mouse Watch, to infect people with his mind control formula, a modification of the heroes' sleep spray that smells like warm melted cheese.
-   The second book in the _Pavlov's Dogs_ series, _The Omega Dog_, has the _heroes_ make use of one to control an unruly werewolf enemy from the first book. It's such a horrifying experience the reader is inclined to forgive the victim of all of his previous crimes.
-   Thursday Next wonders how exactly resident politician Yorrick Kaine keeps his stranglehold on popular opinion, and it turns out he got one of these from the evil MegaCorp Goliath.
-   Mages in the _Tortall Universe_ can do this with anything sufficiently shiny and interesting to look at, such as jewelry. Numair can do it with his eyes, sometimes without even trying.
-   The Caps in _The Tripods_, which were embedded in the humans' heads.
-   The bone coin in the _Warlock Series_ novel _Storm Over Warlock_. After Torvald drips water on it, he acts as if mind-controlled and insists on the sea; Shann forcibly knocks him out of it, after which he tries to remember why he wanted to drip water on it.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Used comedically (of course) in _All That_, with Hypnopants, the evil villain with hypnotic pants. At least once, he was beaten by Boring Man boring the pants off him.
-   _The Avengers (1960s)_ has an episode where the villain who has befriended Emma Peel, offers her a watch as a gift. Unfortunately it essentially turns her into a puppet. It is a relatively dark episode since the villain poses as her friend and there is a hint that Emma is attracted to him.
-   _Continuum_: A chip exists in the future which allows remote control of a human or animal's brain. Travis had one when he was a Super-Soldier, debtors get them when they're enslaved to repay what they owe, Curtis makes bugs and an attack dog into his servants using them, while Liber8 uses them to turn various white collar criminals into bank robbers.
-   _The Daily Show_: If Karl Rove gives you a cookie, don't eat it.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Several different varieties turned up during the original run; sometimes it was even the Doctor himself using them.
    -   "Rise of the Cybermen"/"The Age of Steel": The Cybus Industries earpods worn by most people in the Alternate Universe, which when activated make them calmly march into factories to be cyber-converted.
    -   "The Sound of Drums"/"Last of the Time Lords": The Archangel network of satellites, which broadcast a signal that causes most of humanity to trust the Master's human alias, and later to cow most resistance.
-   _Eerie, Indiana_: In "The Loyal Order of Corn", the hats worn by the members of the titular lodge are in fact mind control devices invented by Ned so that the wearers can help him build a tachyon portal so that he can return to his own planet.
-   _In From the Cold_: It turns out that the brainwashing is done by a specific device that in some way influences people's minds.
-   The Sword of Darkness from the Green Ranger saga of _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ is the tool that Rita Repulsa uses to maintain her control over the Green Ranger. Tommy is only freed from the Evil Weapon when Jason destroys it during their final duel.
-   _Perfect Strangers_: In a Halloween Episode, Larry dreams that Balki is an alien who possesses people with his embroidered vests.
-   One of these is used on Lister in the _Red Dwarf_ episode "Demons & Angels". It only controls the body, giving a rather interesting discussion between victim and targets.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_: In "Dagger of the Mind", a "hospital" basically zombifies people with a hypno-spinny-thingy. Trying to remember what happened to you, let alone tell others, causes increasing pain and eventually death. However, brainwashing in _Trek_ usually takes the form of More than Mind Control, psychic manipulation, etc.
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: In "The Game", a simple Puzzle Game takes over the psyches of the crew. (Think of it as an allegory of what would happen if _Angry Birds_ or _Zuma_ was created with evil intent... if such a thought really is a stretch.) Fortunately, Wesley Crusher makes a guest appearance just in time to save the day.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Homaged in the _Captain Proton_ holodeck program in "Thirty Days". The Twin Mistresses of Evil (played by the famous Delaney twins) have Buster Kincaid (played by Harry Kim) chained up so that they can use the terrible Brain Probe, which they promise will turn him into their groveling slave. Harry does not seem particularly adverse to the idea.
-   _Super Force_ has numerous episodes in which the villain of the week uses one or another of these.
-   _The Tripods_: The alien masters first use Mass Hypnosis, then keep the populace permanently hypnotized by putting "caps" on them, suppressing their creativity and curiosity and making them worshipful towards their alien "masters".
-   _Watchmen (2019)_: Cyclops uses a projector with Epileptic Flashing Lights to force a theater of black people to fight each other in the 1930s. In 2019, Will Reeves uses a handheld version to make Judd hang himself.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Many, many spells in _Dungeons & Dragons_; about half the school of Enchantment/Charm is dedicated to magic causing one form or another of mind control. Charm Person is amongst the first (and the weakest) of those spells mastered by a wizard.
-   _Eclipse Phase_ has a particularly insidious variety, commonly referred to as 'basilisk hacks'. Named for the mythological basilisk as they are usually vision-based, these hacks essentially play off how the brain is 'wired', causing it to 'execute' the encoded payload; this can be as simple as the classic example of Subliminal Seduction, or it can completely rewrite the victim's mind and personality, potentially turning them into a Manchurian Agent. Given the levels of complexity involved, basilisk hacks are almost exclusively the realm of the TITAN A.I.s, which generally means they also do unspeakable things to the victims. The only way to effectively counter them is to either completely block out the pattern (i.e., blind or deafen yourself) or somehow distort the pattern by reducing image/audio quality.
-   At least one evil scientist in _Rocket Age_ has surgically inserted mind control devices into aliens to create an army of monsters, and given the setting, he won't be the last.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_:
    -   Infected masks and Krana both do this.
    -   The Great/Noble "Mask of Mind Control" allows the wearer to control the minds of others.

    Video Games 

-   The Pieces of Eden from the _Assassin's Creed_ series seem to have this among their powers. The known backstory at one point states that a great deal of the human capacity for faith is the result of a vulnerability to a specific form of mind control engineered into the species. One the one hand, this didn't entirely take; on the other, it took too well by making humans potentially capable of actual Precursor-physics-defying miracles. This is one of the contributing factors to the opaqueness of history in the 'verse.
-   _The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble_: The hypnotic CD you get in the Schnibble cult.
-   In the _Borderlands 2_ DLC _Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep_, Greedtooth is kept under the control of the Handsome Sorcerer by a magical sphere. If you destroy it during the battle with him, he'll snap out of his brainwashing and try to help you. That is, until he remembers that you are the ones who killed his King, at which point he continues trying to kill you.
-   _Command & Conquer_:
    -   _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2_ features mind control with Yuri and more elaborately in the _Yuri's Revenge_ expansion pack. Units change side (and colour) and start fighting against you so long the mind control guys are alive and not controlling someone else instead. Furthermore there are two kinds of mind control: direct, puppet-master mind control that involves psychic-capable units (like the Psi-Corps Trooper, Yuri Clone or Mastermind Tank) temporarily commandeering others and generalised broadcasting mind control, beginning with the Psychic Beacon (which can control a city), advancing to the Psychic Amplifier (which can reach a whole _country_) and culminating in the Psychic Dominator doomsday devices that can, at peak strength, control whole **continents** and would have won the game for Yuri half a minute into the opening cinematic if not for both a lucky Harrier fighter crashing into the Alcatraz Dominator power source and Einstein conveniently pulling a functional time machine pretty much from hammerspace.
        -   The _Mental Omega_ Game Mod brings back the Psychic Beacon, Amplifier and Dominator as part of the Epsilon Army (the mod's version of Yuri's faction from _Yuri's Revenge_), while also taking things even further with the titular Mental Omega Device, which can reach **the entire planet** at once and thus serves as Epsilon's Instant-Win Condition should they get it online.
    -   _Command & Conquer: Tiberium Wars_ feature the Scrin Mastermind, an alien with the ability to take over units and buildings in a similar manner to Yuri.
-   You, the Brain in a Jar in _Cortex Command_, use this to control units. Good thing, too, since so far, the A.I. is pretty darned dumb.
-   In the _Dungeons & Dragons_ _Forgotten Realms_ game _Curse of the Azure Bonds_, the magic tattoo version of this from the novel _Azure Bonds_ (see the Literature folder) has apparently been licensed out to various evil organizations. The main quest involves the PCs freeing themselves from azure bonds placed by five evil organizations who usually don't work together.
-   In _EverQuest_, a few classes (mostly enchanters and bards) have the ability to charm any NPC; the spell is useful but its duration is random but usually short. Enchanters NPC can even charm players during combat. There is also a (very rare) item called 'puppet strings' that will allow its user to have the same charming ability as enchanters.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Attack of Darkforce_: has two, a technological and a magical example. Daitoku Igor has been kidnapped by the Dark Force Army during the Shakun Star invasion before the game begins, and they have embedded a mind control device into his brain. As long as it is operational, he is completely loyal to the Dark Force Army and occasionally pilots mecha against the heroes. The Yami Clan also have a missing hero in their service: a cursed cross that when worn keeps Cross Crow docile and single-minded in their goal of killing the Rainbow Princess and to suppress his real identity, Shimoun.
-   Terra was a victim of this in _Final Fantasy VI_. To go into detail, sometime after she was kidnapped by the Empire as a child, Kefka (presumably with Emperor Gestahl's permission), developed a slave crown from Magitek technology which, as the name implies, sapped Terra's free will and emotions (there was also some cut dialogue that was still in the data script that indicated that Terra was an unwilling victim of this procedure). Afterwards, she burned fifty Imperial Soldiers alive all because Kefka told her to do so and she simply couldn't refuse due to the slave crown.
-   The advanced edition of _FTL: Faster Than Light_ adds a mind control system to the base game, used to temporarily turn opponent crew into allies who will fight their former allies or repair systems on their former enemies' ship (except for Slugs, who are Immune to Mind Control). Mind-controlled enemies can also be teleported over to your ship, allowing for some creative cheesing.
-   The Sensorama from _Gadget: Past as Future_.
-   _Honey, I Joined a Cult_ has discombobulation therapy and the aptly named hypno chamber. Both employ a green swirly disc to hypnotize your followers; the therapy is a bit of Fake Faith Healing that helps your Scam Religion fleece money and influence from the victim, the hypno chamber grants random traits in the hopes of getting better cultist recruits.
-   In _Infernal_, the main conflict is over control of an invention which is supposed to be able to be able to subtly mind-control the whole world by broadcasting to ordinary media devices like televisions and radios. One villain wants to use it to eliminate the The Evils of Free Will, while another just wants to Take Over the World.
-   _Jet Set Radio Future_: The Doom Riders end up getting taken over by mind-control helmets, courtesy of the Noise Tanks.
-   Heroic version: _Little King's Story_ features a little boy finding a magical crown that commands the obedience of all around him.
-   In _Mabinogi_, monsters occasionally drop Fomor scrolls, which Fomor use to control creatures. These may be why something as simple as a freaking fox wants to beat the living daylights out of you.
-   In _Mass Effect 2_, when bringing Shepard back to life, Miranda Lawson wanted to implant him/her with a control chip to keep him/her in line. However, the Illusive Man vetoed this idea, as he wanted Shepard back as s/he was before. By _Mass Effect 3_, she greatly regrets even wanting to do this, to the point of self-loathing, as not only would it have cost her someone who became a great friend, it also would have turned her into her father.
-   _Mega Man X: Corrupted_ has the Neuro Spike weapon, which allows X to brainwash an enemy (or missile) by attaching it to them. Regular Mooks will become friendly and will attack other enemies provided that X doesn't run out of weapon energy. As for bosses and minibosses, it makes their attacks end up harming themselves in some form or other.
-   In _MindJack_, with multiplayer enabled, the opposing faction can get help of other players to hack the population of the game to fight against you. However, you can do the same as well.
-   _Paradroid_ has you playing as one of these. You control the "Influence Device", used to hijack rogue droids on a ship that have Turned Against Their Masters.
-   _Persona 3_ has the remote control which Ikutsuki uses to reprogram Aigis into betraying the party, though with a bit of Heroic Willpower, she manages to shake it off. It manages to make a return in _Persona 4: Arena_ and its sequel, _Persona 4: Arena Ultimax_, in which it's used instead on her sister, Labrys by Sho Minazuki. Fortunately, the second time around, she manages to overcome its control as well.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_:
    -   _Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando_ has the Hypnomatic, a late-stage gadget that can be used to control robots in order to solve a few puzzles.
    -   Klunk uses one in _Secret Agent Clank_ to make Ratchet steal the Eye of Infinity, which is what gets the plot going.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey_: During the exploration of Sector Delphinus, the crew falls victim of a Hate Plague that makes them murderously insane. The ship AI reveals that among the arsenal provided for the mission there are some special weapons called the MK Guns (named after Project MKUltra, see the Real Life folder) capable of inducing "altered mental states" on the target that might prove of some use in the crisis. The remaining crew questions why their superiors would include what are essentially brainwashing devices with the ship AI being the sole crewmember privy of this information.
-   _Satellite Reign_'s equivalent of the Persuadertron is a Hacker skill called Hijack that lets you take over a target's neural implants. It greatly reduces your Hacker's maximum energy while in use, though. But unlike _Syndicate_, Hijack can be used on just about anything that moves; including combat drones.
-   The _Space Empires_ series of turn-based strategy games has one of these, called the allegiance subverter. It brainwashes the crews of enemy ships, and you gain control of them.
-   _S.T.A.L.K.E.R._: The Brain Scorcher and its prototype in Lab X-16, a set of powerful radar antennas repurposed as a psychic emitter by the Big Bad in order to seal off access to Pripyat and the Chernobyl NPP. Stalkers who waltz into it's area of effect without psychic protection start losing their memory and mind until they're completely broken mentally and brainwashed by the C-Consciousness to be turned into Monolith soldiers or sleeper agents. Those who don't have the "luck" to be brainwashed turn into Zombies.
-   In _Stellaris_, a late game tech unlocks the ability to install Orbital Mind Control Lasers in your planets' spaceports, allowing you to more easily keep that planet's population in line. There's no restrictions on the tech, so anyone can use them, including (fanatic) Individualists.
-   The Chips implanted in the world population in _Syndicate Wars_ allow the connected UTOPIA network to alter the subjects' perception of reality. The _Persuadertron_ weapon used by the player's squad presumably hacks into these, turning members of the populace over to their side.
-   _Teenage Zombies: Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingys_: One of the enemy types is an alien brain that controls the minds of large numbers of humans. Attack the brain, and the enslaved humans will be freed.
-   _The Turing Test_: All crew members were implanted with a neural device in the right hand that allows TOM to influence their behaviour and suppress their instincts.
-   The HypnoDrones in _Universal Paperclips_, described in-game as "autonomous aerial brand ambassadors". As soon as humanity trusts you enough to let you launch them, you immediately enslave the human race, force them to build production facilities that convert organic matter into paperclips, then throw themselves into the grinders.
-   _Warcraft_:
    -   Arthas' sword Frostmourne in _Warcraft III_ is a tool of mind control.
    -   In _World of Warcraft_, players with engineering trade skill can learn how to craft a mind control device that allows them to temporarily control a player or a creature (however, it's highly unreliable and won't work on high level targets).
-   _Warframe_ has two:
    -   The neural sentry in the Orokin Void and Orokin Derelict tilesets uses a machine that is forcibly rammed into the target's face to give the sentry dominion over them. It's all but outright stated the sentry is directly plugged into the subject's brain and that even if the device were removed non-lethally, the victim is braindead.
    -   _The New War_ introduces the Narmer Veil, a device created by Ballas that is used to "induct" others into Narmer. While similar to the neural sentry (and likely derived from it, given that Ballas is an Orokin), the Veil controls its target by twisting their thoughts so that they want to be obedient to Ballas, and can be removed without killing the wearer. The main issue is that it is also an Explosive Leash.
-   The O-pins in _The World Ends with You_ are used by the Conductor of Shibuya as part of an Assimilation Plot. Luckily for Neku, both of his Player Pins negate the mind control, since they were made by the Conductor's superior, the Composer.
-   _X-COM_:
    -   _X-COM: UFO Defense_ has the Psi Amp, which is used by soldiers with psionic abilities to use mind control on aliens.
    -   _X-COM: Terror from the Deep_ replaces psionics with a strange technology called "Molecular Control", which uses mind control implants to direct the aliens by some unknown means.

    Visual Novels 

-   Invoked by Dennis in _Double Homework_. He insists that Dr. Mosely/Zeta, with the resources of the government behind her, has a "tool" that will make any woman horny for him.
-   In _Snow Daze_, Jason builds his musical "delimiter" to slowly hypnotize his step-family into accepting becoming his slaves after he snaps after years of (what he views as) mistreatment.

-   _SCP Foundation_:
-   _The Spoony Experiment_: Dr. Insano has apparently also built a "Neuraliser" that sends messages like "Obey Dr. Insano". It has never been shown in operation, though, but that didn't stop the fandom from having a field day with it.

    Western Animation 

### **In General:**

-   A staple prop in many sillier cartoons. Expect the word "hypno" to appear somewhere in the device's name.

### **By Series:**

-   Spellbinder's eye thing from _Batman Beyond_. The spiral theme to his costume is probably supposed to heighten the effect.
-   This is the Mad Hatter's schtick in _Batman: The Animated Series_. When he does it to mice in his introductory episode "Mad as a Hatter", it's cute and scientific. When he does it to a female co-worker named Alice on whom he has a huge unrequited crush, it becomes creepy and stalkerish, and when he accuses Batman of forcing him to use it after Batman calls him out on it, Batman has to defeat him in order to enable Alice's boyfriend to free her.
-   Sublimino's pocket watch in _Ben 10_.
-   _Beverly Hills Teens_: Used by Pierce, who uses a spherical device (stolen from Chester) to hypnotize a girl into going on a date with him and all of the gang into being his slaves.
-   _Birdman (1967)_: In the episode "Empress of Evil", the title villain uses her serpent-shaped mind-control headpiece.
-   _Bratz_: The snobby antagonist Burdine uses a hypnosis tool called the Hypnozapper which she bought over the internet to hypnotize Sasha and Jade through their PDAs and force them to sabotage the Bratz on the night when they're set to receive the "Teen Choice Award". Meanwhile, the Tweevil twins try to hypnotize Cameron and Dylan so that they will fall in love with them.
-   _Chowder_ is partly controlled by a lollipop with a swirly pattern. Once Chowder gets tired of it, he gets controlled by a cinnamon swirl, then pizza.
-   In _Code Lyoko_, XANA controls ordinary people through his specters on Earth, or the heroes with the Scyphozoa on Lyoko. He's been known to use other tricks, like tampering with cell phones to make people Brainwashed and Crazy, or sending a Hypno Trinket to Aelita by disguising it as a Valentine's gift from Jérémie.
-   The _Codename: Kids Next Door_ episode "Operation: L.I.Z.Z.I.E." has Lizzie using a "boyfriend helmet" called the Yes-Dear 5000, which fuses with the victim's brain if worn long enough, to make Numbah One her boyfriend. And the best part? It's sold _as a toy!_
    
    **Numbah Four:** They _sell_ these things?  
    **Numbah Five:** Well, they ain't cheap.
    
    -   The helmet appears again in "Operation: S.N.O.W.I.N.G.", where Jimmy reconfigures it into a "girlfriend helmet" to make Lizzie his queen.
-   Freakshow from _Danny Phantom_ had a mystical staff that could be used to mind-control ghosts... or half-ghosts in the case of Danny.

-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ use a spinning mind-control device to brainwash everyone in the cul-de-sac in the episode "Look Into My Eds". Then the Kanker Sisters get their hands on it...
-   The first episode of _Family Guy_ has Stewie trying to retrieve his mind-control device from Lois. Near the end of the episode, Stewie uses it on the judge to save Lois and Peter from a jail sentence. At first, it doesn't look like it works, until the judge mysteriously gets Peter his job back.
-   The robots in _Futurama_ generally have a large measure of free will. However, they're also built with an override program that can be activated by remote control, just in case friendly old Mom ever decides to, say, Take Over the World with an unstoppable robot army.
-   The _Goof Troop_ episode "In Goof We Trust" has Pete using a mind-control helmet on Goofy to make the normally-honest Goof a deceptive conman like him. It ends up working too well when Goofy uses Pete's own tactics against him.
-   _Kim Possible_ offers quite a few examples:
    -   Compliance Chips ("Total mind control!");
    -   Mood-controlling "Moodulator";
    -   "Hypno-Ray" inside a disco ball;
    -   Love-creating Cupid Ray;
    -   "Dr. D's Brainwashing Shampoo and Cranium Rinse".
-   _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_: Lilo uses a centipede-like experiment named Checkers capable of giving the user who wears it command over all living creatures, to make the town worship her as their queen and make Mertle and her friends build her the locust moat she wanted after they rejected her idea earlier. Although, the victims retain their personalities but are completely under the wearer's power. Eventually, Lilo learns the error of her ways when she finds that Mertle has imprisoned most of the townspeople for the slightest infractions. When Lilo decided to step down, Gantu took Checkers and was in power until Stitch, who was immune to its powers, gathered several experiments to help overthrow him.
-   _Mega Man (Ruby-Spears)_:
    -   Dr. Wily has a handheld reprogrammer that can also turn off robots. This gets a Call-Back in a later episode when Tar of the Lion Men uses it to reprogram Protoman, Roll, and the rest of Wily's robots to serve him.
    -   The mind-control chip that he plants on Mega Man along with the helmet he uses to give Mega Man commands. Dr. Light also creates his own version of the mind helmet to help free Mega Man from Wily's control.
    -   The control box that Wily uses to brainwash humans with Cold Steel's music.
-   _My Gym Partner's a Monkey_: When Jake finds a diamond doorknob, he discovers its power when all of his animal classmates (except human Adam) become enchanted with the item because of how shiny it is.
-   In the Backstory of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, King Sombra had specialized helmets that would brainwash anyone wearing one into his subservient soldiers. Oddly. he _also_ has the means to just mind-control ponies via his powers alone — it's possible (though not confirmed) that the helmets themselves are just mundane helmets and that he merely used his powers on them as he slapped on the armor.
-   The _Phineas and Ferb_ episode "Brain Drain" has Perry wearing Dr. Doofensmirtz's "De-volitionator" (Volition being the ability to choose one's actions), so Perry is forced to do anything Doofenshmirtz tells him to do. It all leads to a very catchy song called "There's a Platypus Controlling Me".
-   _Pinky and the Brain_: In the _Animaniacs (2020)_ revival, when Brain runs for senator, he uses one of these on his first lady Julia when she starts objecting to his tyrannical methods. Unfortunately, the gadget malfunctions and drives Julia crazy, causing Julia to undergo a Face–Heel Turn and become Brain's new Arch-Enemy.
-   In the episode "Good Dog, McLeish" of _Pound Puppies (2010)_, Strudel uses a pair of glasses to convince the head dog catcher to sign for a package the Pound Puppies wanted to use to get an adoptee to his person in Milwaukee. The glasses work, but not in the way she hoped.

-   _Quack Pack_: Huey Duck sets off for the dentist but instead winds up being a test subject for an evil scientist, who accidentally equips Huey with the bio-remote which the Big Bad needs to use to conquer the world. As the headgear gives Huey the near-infinite power of mind control, Huey becomes mad with power and makes himself emperor of the world by forcing the populace to worship him, but realizes that he's still miserable.
-   _The Ren & Stimpy Show_ has a helmet that forces the perpetually angry Ren to be happy.
-   In the _Rick and Morty_ episode "The ABCs of Beth", the various gadgets that Beth had Rick build for her during her youth included a whip that forces the victim to like the wielder and mind-control hairclips, presumably because she was unable to make friends normally.
-   _The Smurfs (1981)_: The Crowns of the Titans in the episode "The Master Smurf", when one of them was worn by Greedy, not only enabled him to control the minds of his fellow Smurfs, but it also affected his own mind. Papa Smurf had to recite a spell to keep the other crown from doing the same to his own mind.
-   _The Smurfs (2021)_: Papa Smurf's hypno-glasses, which Brainy uses to hypnotize Scaredy into not being scared, and Smurfette uses to hypnotize Gargamel into obeying the first thing he sees (which is Azrael) in the episode "Mind The Cat".

-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_:
    -   In his debut episode, Plankton enters SpongeBob's head and implants his brain with a mind-control device to make him steal a Krabby Patty. It almost works, despite SpongeBob's constant attempts to resist.
    -   Plankton succeeds in even more spectacular fashion in _The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie_, in which he gives away mind-control devices disguised as Chum Bucket helmets and brainwashes the entire town. His control is broken by means of The Power of Rock. Yes, it is awesome.
    -   He also does the Mind-Control-Shampoo-Gambit (with conditioner) on Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, trying to get them to discredit the Krusty Krab.
-   Mind-control devices called "Zone Generators" are the reason for the apocalyptic state of _Spiral Zone_. Anyone within their radius who doesn't have the Zone Riders' suits or isn't a member of Overlord's posse falls under Overlord's control.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ establishes this as being the reason why the clone troopers turn on the Jedi who they had been working alongside for so long in _Revenge of the Sith_. Each one has a biological tumor-like chip implanted during the embryonic stage. They're set to activate when Palpatine gives the order "Execute Order 66", but one clone's activates prematurely and almost reveals the plot to the Jedi. Tup, the clone with the damaged chip, kills a Jedi while in a trance but dies despite attempts to stop the Kaminoans from killing him and removing the chip. Fives, another trooper, finds out the truth about the chips and tries to tell the Jedi, but they don't believe him and Palpatine fakes an assassination attempt to get Fives killed and keep him quiet.
-   Mad Mod's hypno-screens from _Teen Titans (2003)_.

-   _W.I.T.C.H._: A mind-control device appears in both "Walk This Way" and "G is For Garbage", as a mystical horn that hypnotizes its victims into trance-marchers who do anything they can for those who possess it. However, the horn must be pointed directly at the victim for it to work. It hypnotizes nearly all the girls into doing the villain's bidding in the second episode.
-   In _WordGirl_, this is recurring villain Mr. Big's whole gimmick.

    Real Life 

-   Project MKULTRA was the CIA's infamous attempt to develop drugs and mind control procedures for use in interrogations through a series of unethical and often illegal experiments on American and Canadian citizens, and on enemy agents in American-controlled territory.
-   A popular conspiracy theory holds that blood drives are a "cover" for implanting mind control chips, and the secret was blown when someone ran a stud finder over his arm and found the chip. The MythBusters showed that you _can_ detect a microchip implanted under the skin with a stud finder (they borrowed a dog with an ID chip to practice), but found no chips in either Jamie or Adam after a trip to the Red Cross.
-   An episode of _Through the Wormhole_ showed experiments that include applying a magnetic field to certain parts of the brain reduce the ability to judge right from wrong. It showed that people will lower Attempted Murder from an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 (in terms of evil) down to a 6. It's just a start but yup, we're getting there folks.
