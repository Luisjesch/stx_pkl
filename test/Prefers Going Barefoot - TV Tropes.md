_"Shoes? No, I can certainly afford them; I go barefoot for comfort."_

This character tries to avoid wearing shoes whenever possible. The reasons for this vary greatly, some of which are common enough to be tropes of their own:

-   Barefoot Loon: As a sign of eccentricity or absent-mindedness. Bunny Ears Lawyers and Cloudcuckoolanders may go barefoot in public because they are either flouting societal conventions or are simply oblivious to them.
-   Barefoot Sage: Enlightened sages and eccentric mentors, for the reason that they know and see more than everyone else does, and are just too wise to care about said social conventions. This may also be a form of religious asceticism.
-   Earthy Barefoot Character: To show that they are connected to the soil in some way. This may overlap with other subtropes if they have elemental or nature-linked powers that are weakened or neutralised if they don't have skin contact with the ground, but it's frequently just a metaphor. Most often though, this is simply the rural character who just enjoys feeling nature. The Nature Hero, Barbarian Hero, Noble Savage, Hot Gypsy Woman, Jungle Princess and Tarzan Boy are almost always barefoot.
-   Magical Barefooter: Characters with magical powers sometimes go barefoot — this may be because they need contact with the soil for their powers, because they are invulnerable to injury or soiling, to demonstrate their lack of interest in social conventions, or to demonstrate their "higher being" status.
-   Surefooted Barefooter: When a character prefers going barefoot because it allows for unhindered agility; typically associated with stealthy, instinctive or resilient characters.
-   Martial Artists Are Always Barefoot: Martial artists are often portrayed as being habitually barefoot even in non-combat situations.
-   Undead Barefooter: Undead characters may go barefoot, either to dramatize their inhumanity and/or because they don't feel pain or cold and are thus unconcerned about the comfort of their feet.

This is also sometimes a sign of youthful innocence or vulnerability, and many of the characters who demonstrate this trope are either children or childlike. The lack of shoes may also be used as an indication of untamed ruggedness.

This trope is often used in visual media as an excuse to show frequent close-up shots of bare feet, usually due to Fanservice or Author Appeal (or both if you're Quentin Tarantino or Joss Whedon), which may explain why female barefooters outnumber males practically 2-1, or why their feet are very rarely visibly dirty or calloused. Conversely, there's a little bit of Truth in Television here; women are more likely to go barefoot than men in a given context.

Characters may end up barefoot due to circumstances beyond their control (Barefoot Captives, Barefoot Poverty, etc.), which is _not_ this trope, unless they _develop_ the preference for going barefoot if they enjoyed their shoeless experience.

Downplayed, but still _broadly_ applicable, if a character has a notable preference for open-toed (or especially open-arched) footwear like sandals or flip-flops, particularly in circumstances when others usually put on closed shoes or boots (like in cold weather or on formal occasions); this version is often used to still convey the essence of the trope while sidestepping questions of practicality. Does _not_ apply if none of the characters wear shoes and the work portrays a society or setting where shoes don't even exist.

Contrast The One Who Wears Shoes, wherein a character is the only one to wear shoes in a world of barefooters (usually Barefoot Cartoon Animals).

And no, it is not this trope if a character only is only barefoot at common times. Being barefoot in the shower, in bed, or at the beach/swimming pool, or wearing sandals on a hot day are **not** examples of this trope. The character must be shown to specifically enjoy being barefoot and exploit any opportunity to do so, especially at times and in places you would otherwise expect one to wear shoes.

    Advertising 

-   Mountain Dew's Country-inspired "Get That Barefoot Feeling" jingle from the late 1960s/early '70s practically name-drops this trope<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , while attempting to make the soda sound equally invigorating. The advertisements themselves show various Mountain Dew drinkers happily attending public or social situations in their bare feet.
-   A businessman in one BMW commercial, promoting the sensitivity of the car's all-wheel drive, decides to explore his workplace and its city barefoot, and learns to enjoy feeling different tactile sensations with his feet, including the brush of an asphalt road, and the rush of a rainwater stream.

    Comic Books 

-   _Teen Titans_: Jinx, of the Fearsome Five and Villainy Inc., is perpetually barefoot. This is because her powers are tied to her contact with the earth at her feet. As she can be disabled by simply lifting her from the ground, imagine what shoes would do to her magic.
-   Danny from John Byrne's _Next Men_. Justified in the sense that shoes can't stand up to the force of his running, so he has to toughen up his feet to do so.
-   During The '70s, _Shang-Chi_ went barefoot everywhere. Called out on this by a security guard at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City ("Hey, kid! Why Don't you get some shoes?"), he replied, "Why do you fear to touch the ground? Does the concrete not separate you from it enough?"
-   Both Swift and Jack Hawksmoor of _Stormwatch_ and _The Authority_ rarely wear shoes, as she has flight powers and the ability to turn her feet into bird-like talons, and he has powers derived from urban environments and needs to stay in skin contact with the ground or buildings. Jack Hawksmoor's alterations to be fully adapted to city living include "metallic" appearing foot soles, allowing him to walk on any city surface comfortably (concrete, asphalt, etc).
-   The Séance from _The Umbrella Academy_, but in an odd forgettable comment in the _Dallas_ arc, it's because _he can't use his powers when wearing them._ Granted, this does come from a psychotic assassin in a dog head, but in that time, Seance doesn't really try to fight back, so his powers are probably at least inhibited.
-   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Giganta, who was in this iteration a gorilla transplanted into a woman's body, refused to wear shoes and only barely puts up with the torn tunic which preserves her new body's modesty.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Peanuts_: Peppermint Patty strictly prefers wearing sandals almost everywhere she goes, even in the winter, which emphasizes her tough nature. One story arc involved the school's dress code banning her sandals, which her dad bought her because she's a "rare gem." It upset her to the point of tears.
-   In _Phoebe and Her Unicorn_, Marigold points out in one strip that "Goblins find shoes uncomfortable".
-   In _Red and Rover_, this is definitely the case with Red in all the summer strips. One has him announcing it's summer vacation to his dog, Rover. Rover bounds to meet him, knocking Red's shoes and socks off in the process, and his thought bubble is "Whaddya wanna do first?" Red's reply is "Trade my shoes and socks for a pair of bare feet." Another one has him taking his shoes, socks, and shirt off, saying "Summer vacation, it is here!" Another has him ripping his shoes, socks, shirt, and even trousers off, revealing his swimming costume, saying he certainly is prepared for summer vacation. And yet another has him going to the shoe shop, saying shoes feel odd, and his mum saying any shoes would, as he's spent the entire summer barefoot.
-   The title character in _Wallace the Brave_ makes a ritual of throwing his shoes in the bay at the start of summer. In his words:
    
    "Without shoes I'm quicker, faster and stealthier."
    

    Fan Works 

-   Terra Caldwell from the _Pokémon_ fanfic _Convergent Paths_ is nearly always barefoot, due to being a "Mother Earth" character who likes meditating. Lampshaded by one of the other characters, Daniel, who mentions her "strange aversion to shoes" in Chapter 62.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_ fancomic _Ghosts of the Future_ introduces Silver's sister Venice, who is always seen barefoot. Granted, she's only ever seen in her physical form at her home or, later, a hospital bed, where it's not atypical, but her character sheet explicitly notes she "likes to go barefoot", implying it's more than that. In addition, Nicole also goes barefoot, as per the character's original design, while Tikal and Scourge lose the shoes from their original designs.
-   Xanna (and later Naruto) in the _Reaching for a Dream_ series hates wearing shoes. Even when wearing rather impressive looking (if impractical) armor, she always goes barefoot because she finds it more comfortable. It helps that she's a demon and by the end of the story both she and Naruto are gods.

-   As the title implies, Harry Potter in _Barefoot_ goes barefoot as often as possible. This is because he can learn the history of anything he touches and notes all the things he can learn through his soles.
-   A.A. Pessimal's _Discworld_ fic _Hyperemesis Gravidarum_ sees Assassins' Guild student and long-distance runner Mariella Smith-Rhodes setting out for a race. She is from the Discworld's Expy of South Africa and like Zola Budd prefers to compete barefoot, for much the same reasons.
-   _Firefly foot story_ focuses on this aspect of River's character. Upon realizing she's the only woman onboard Serenity with an interest in walking barefoot, River gets the idea to steal every piece of footwear that she, Kaylee, Inara and Zoe own and throw them out the airlock. When the other three women realize they're stuck being barefoot for an entire month, they're initially annoyed and uncomfortable, but by the end, all three women admit that they're enjoying being barefoot.
-   Aki from _The Second Try_ is noted by her parents as hating footwear of any kind, to the point that they gave up trying to force her unless it was absolutely necessary. This comes up as a gag in the sequel comic _Aki-chan's Life_ when they have to put her shoes on when she starts attending kindergarten, though later chapters imply that she's at least learned to tolerate it.
-   Lambda in the _Time Break Saga_ doesn't wear shoes at all and makes it clear that she hates wearing them. She tries to justify it by saying that her auto-repair fixes any wear-and-tear her feet go through. Even when she's convinced by others to wear shoes, they're always open-toed.

    Films — Animation 

-   Once she gets feet, Ariel in _The Little Mermaid_ goes barefoot more often than she wears shoes. Her daughter Melody in the sequel is a dedicated barefooter, only wearing shoes when she's forced to.
-   Dot in _Dot and the Kangaroo_ and its sequels.
-   _Fire and Ice (1983)_: Princess Teegra does not seem to mind being Exposed to the Elements, running through the jungle and in a frigid ice palace in only a micro bikini. She does feel cold one earlier evening, but does not seem to mind running around barefoot on ice and snow.
-   In _The Prince of Egypt_, Moses throws off his sandals when God in the burning bush tells him to take them off in respect of this holy ground. Moses seemingly never recovers them again after that.
-   In _Rise of the Guardians_, Jack Frost walks barefoot, leaving frozen patches on the ground where he walks. When offered a pair of blue elf shoes (with _bells_) from an elf, Jack cringes and stops the Guardian initiation ceremony immediately. Near the end of the story, it is revealed that he walked on ice barefoot even as a human.
-   _Tangled_: Rapunzel is of the youthful innocence variety, plus she never needed shoes due to never leaving her tower. Interestingly, no one in the entire film comments on it, aside from Mother Gothel pointing a mirror down at Rapunzel's bare feet and commenting that she's "underdressed" — causing Rapunzel to immediately pull the bottom of her dress down over her feet. (There's considerably more lampshading in _Tangled: The Series_ since she's a royal princess who spends time outside and yet never wears proper shoes.)
    -   In the storybook version of _Tangled Ever After_, she's still barefoot, even at her wedding. (In the short film, her dress is too long to tell.) The later storybook _Ghosts of Christmas Past_ then shows that while she'll shun shoes most of the time, she'll renege to them if it calls for walking in snow.
    -   Ironically, one bit of early concept art shows Rapunzel with shoes... however, in the artwork, she's shown kicking them off her feet. In _Ralph Breaks the Internet_ her comfy outfit includes sneakers.

    Films — Live Action 

-   In the 1939 film _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_, Huck says, "Shoes and I don't get along."
-   Juliette, Brigitte Bardot's character in _And God Created Woman_. She even goes to work barefooted; her foster mother mentions that one of the customers complained about that.
-   _Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe_: Dante prefers to eschew shoes, even on Texas dirt roads, a character beat that helps underscore his unique way of looking at the world.
-   Maria Vargas, Ava Gardner's character in _The Barefoot Contessa_ could practically be the trope namer. She goes from poor peasant girl to internationally famous actress, but never loses her love of going barefoot. When a statue is commissioned of her, she insists on posing for it barefoot, and at the end of the movie, after her husband murders her, Humphrey Bogart's character removes her shoes to bring her soul some peace.
-   _Barefoot_, a Foreign Remake of the German film _Barfuss_', naturally features this. Here, it's the Manic Pixie Dream Girl Daisy, who insists shoes hurt her feet. This is the _least_ of her many crazy quirks.
-   The aptly-named German film _Barfuss_ (which is German for "barefoot", except in a slightly incorrect spelling) features a pretty naive girl named Leila. Being held at home by her mother (until she died) for full nineteen years not only made Leila completely unfamiliar to the socium - it has made her completely unfamiliar with shoes as well. Leila's feet remain naked even when Nick shows the girl all the wonders of the modern life and even after she has stopped wearing her nightdress all the time.
-   In _Bell, Book and Candle_, Hot Witch Gillian Holroyd (played by Kim Novak) is a Magical Barefooter who goes barefoot in just about every indoor scene, and some of the outdoor ones as well. At one point in the movie, an old classmate claims that she came to college that way (until said classmate ratted her out to the dean, earning herself a fantastic curse in retribution). Here, it's a matter of style/statement. At that time, going barefoot was associated with Beatniks and bohemian types. When Gillian loses her powers, she undergoes Chickification and begins to wear shoes indoors.
-   Agador/Spartacus, the houseboy in _The Birdcage_ (the American remake of _La Cage aux folles_), does not wear shoes because they make him fall down. His employer, Armand, scoffs at this, but it turns out he is telling the truth as he slips and falls at least once. Armand and Albert don't seem to care, or even notice, that he's barefoot until they're about to have company, which is when their son Val insists he wears the shoes.
-   _Dark Shadows_: The movie adaptation from the series, have Carolyn Stoddard. She doesn't wear shoes in the movie, and she's always in bare feet or long socks. It's later revealed that she's a werewolf, and her feet transforms into a wolf-like digitigrade legs. Curiously, she is the only werewolf in Dark Shadows to be female and barefoot, as the other werewolves from the franchise (that don't appear in the movie) are males and used shoes.
-   In _Happy Death Day_, Tree goes barefoot often - sometimes while relaxing in her room, and other times leaving Carter's dorm in the morning without ever putting her shoes on. In one occasion, she even tosses her shoes away as soon as she steps outside, before happily going about her routine.
-   In _The Kidnappers_, Harry and Davy Mackenzie are usually barefoot once they have settled in with their grandparents and paternal aunt and only wear shoes when they are attending school.
-   Eli in _Let the Right One In_ doesn't wear shoes as a rule, even when in the snow. Of course, she's a vampire and as she explains to Oskar she doesn't get cold. As well, not wearing shoes makes it easier for her to climbs things like trees and walls.
-   _Liane, Jungle Goddess_: Having grown up in the jungle, Jungle Princess Liane is not used to wearing shoes, and kicks off her high heeled shoes and leaves them in the middle of the street in Hamburg.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   _The Avengers_ and _Iron Man 3_: After Pepper Potts starts a relationship with Tony, she's often seen being barefoot once they start living together. Along with her more casual clothes, it's a sign of how they're able to relax around each other. (The practical reason for this is that Gwyneth Paltrow is taller than Robert Downey Jr. especially with heels and the filmmakers will take what they can get to keep them in frame together. It also prevents her high heels from getting in the way when she wears the Mark 42 armor in _Iron Man 3_.)
    -   Thor goes barefoot in the _Team Thor_ series of _Thor: Ragnarok_ viral promos, whenever unwinding at his roommate Darryl's house. The second video briefly shows that Thor does have slippers while staying there, but _Team Thor_ never shows him wearing them.
    -   _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_: Wanda Earth-838 counterpart spends most of her screen time barefoot.
-   _The Million Dollar Hotel_ has an eccentric girl named Eloise (portrayed by Milla Jovovich). This fact has been lampshaded in the movie at least once, brought up with the help of Feet-First Introduction, and strengthen with that even after Eloise gets a white dress, she leaves her new high-heeled shoes in the bar, continuing her barefoot life. Milla actually spent two months barefoot in preparation for this movie.
-   In _Moonrise Kingdom_, Suzy Bishop's three younger brothers are usually seen playing games or listening to music together in their bare feet.

-   In _Rush (2013)_, James Hunt is seen barefoot even in places where most people would wear shoes, like a garage. Apparently, this is Truth in Television: the real James Hunt would often appear in public in a T-shirt, jeans and barefoot, even when meeting V.I.P.s and sponsors.
-   The title character of the _Tammy_ film series carries her shoes _with_ her, telling people, "You don't have to wear fancy shoes to let people know you've got them."
-   Zig-zagged in the 1995 film _Tom and Huck_. Tom wore shoes for most of the movie even though the character commonly goes barefoot in the books, supposedly at actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas' insistence so that he wouldn't hurt himself on the outdoor sets. Meanwhile, Huck's actor Brad Renfro had no problem with it because he was a proud country boy from Tennessee who was already used to being barefoot most of the time. In fact, when Huck gets taken in by an elderly widow at the end of the movie, shoes are part of his new civilized look that Tom hates.
-   _Soledad Descalza_ (_Soledad Barefoot_/_Barefoot Soledad_) is a Spanish mockumentary dealing with Soledad who is barefoot and the various reactions that her perpetual shoelessness engenders.
-   Victor from _The Wild Child_ is initially afraid of shoes, thinking they'll hurt him. Itard forces shoes onto his feet, and then Madame Guérin helps him walk across the room, showing him he has nothing to be afraid of.

    Live-Action TV

-   Joe Hart from _Glee_ does not feel comfortable with shoes and goes barefoot all the time. He justifies it by saying it's because of his religion, and that Jesus didn't use shoes<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , but going barefoot to school _has_ got to be against some kind of regulation!
-   In the British series _Love, Nina_, the title character walks around north London in the 1980s perpetually barefoot, only putting on a pair of gym shoes for a job interview. In the last episode of the first (so far the only) series, Nina does explain her aversion to shoes; "I find that if you wear shoes, you don't feel so much"; evidently, she has never stepped on a snail...
-   _Ocean Girl_: Being a Wild Child, Neri goes barefoot at any opportunity. Her reaction when Jason and Brett make her wear boots (to draw less attention when she first walks into ORCA) is "Do I have to wear them?" Later, it turns out all of her race don't wear anything on their feet, as it would impede their ability to swim.
-   _Shaka Zulu_. The young Shaka complains that his army sandals impede him on the battlefield, and demonstrates his lack of need for them by grinding out a flaming stick with his foot while sneering contemptuously. When he's put in charge of training an army, he makes them go barefoot too, running them for miles until they have callused soles like he does.

    Music

-   Cape Verdean singer Cesaria Evora was called "the barefoot diva" and recorded a studio album by the same name. This is because she sung in small, local taverns, often appearing barefoot on stage, where there was a stage, until the age of 47 when her international career started. She was quite a literal case of this trope, as she said openly she avoided wearing shoes in everyday life wherever possible.
-   Deana Carter prefers not to wear shoes at all — when filming on a Puerto Rican beach for one music video they had to first make sure there were no needles left lying in the sand and she's seen walking the streets barefoot in the same video (and stopping to remove something sharp).

-   Raquel del Rosario of the Spanish band El Sueño de Morfeo often performs barefoot or wearing barefoot sandals.

The cover for her video documentary "Candle in the Lives" even features her bare feet on prominent display on the set where she performed her "Dizzy Dive" music video that day (also while barefoot, of course). One of her music videos also sees her taking off a pair of shoes in the background because they hurt her feet. In fact, in her music video "Chain," she makes a deliberate choice to leave her shoes behind as she exits her house because she'd rather go barefoot. She even spots a pair of shoes on display in a boutique and seems to have a change of heart, but then she scoffs at them. Then the reason why she doffed the shoes becomes clear- they were the proverbial chain preventing her from being free.

-   Lorde, going along with the summery, earthy vibe of her album "Solar Power," appears barefoot in all of the album's music videos and frequently in live performances promoting it.
-   Mariana Vega likes to have bare feet when she performs, because while living in Canada, she developed the habit of walking barefoot in her house and would write and play music as such. She admitted that being able to touch the ground with her bare feet liberates her and allows her to feel in her own skin the vibe and the energy from the crowd. Vega sometimes gets compared to Shakira for the bare feet and the similar styles of music they have. She even appeared on a talk show barefoot and got called out on it.

Rikishi did go barefoot earlier in his career when he was Fatu of The Headshrinkers (WWF) and the Samoan SWAT Team (WCW). In the mid-90s, the Headshrinkers had a gimmick where their manager, Captain Lou Albano, tried to "civilize" them by making them wear boots in the ring, and they had trouble climbing to the top rope and doing other moves because they couldn't get used to not being barefoot.

-   Belkar Bitterleaf from _The Order of the Stick_. Being a halfling, this might as well be a racial ability for him. In his own words, he is "A SEXY SHOELESS GOD OF WAR!"
    
    **Belkar:** Pffft. Shoes are for suckers. All part of a big conspiracy on the part of the cobblers.
    
-   Mab from _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_. Her official biography once stated that "Mab has a deep-seated dislike of wearing shoes."
-   Nyarai from _Furry Fight Chronicles_ is barefoot inside and outside of the ring contrasting the other humanoid characters who wear shoes. Since she is a humanoid cheetah with fur and paw pads, shoes are not really necessary. A flashback even reveals that she was a barefooter as a child.
-   Antimony Carver from _Gunnerkrigg Court_ (picture above) just prefers to get her feet dirty from time to time. Surprisingly, the dirt on her bare feet is actually depicted at times, versus most fiction where the barefoot character's feet remain sparkly clean.
-   Morgana Honeydew of _Flaky Pastry_, being a halfling, doesn't wear shoes. She claims this is because she can't find any in her width.
-   Meghan, the lead character of _Arpeggio_, has "got no use for shoes... and can get rather militant about that." After she's chastised by an administrator, Meghan's best friend asks, "Meg, do you even _own_ shoes?" The response: "I think I saw a pair at the bottom of my closet last spring. Maybe."
-   Hope from _Alone in a Crowd_ usually prefers to go barefoot because, as she explained in one comic, she loves feeling and exploring what nature has to offer with her feet. However, she does wear shoes when she needs to.
-   Sette Frummagen from _Unsounded_ remains barefoot from the first panel where she appears and on. No one really cares enough to bring it up. Word of God states that street children from Sette's hometown of Hanghorse go barefoot habitually, out of a combination of poverty, comfort, stealth, emulation of the sailors they see in the port, and because wearing shoes before winter is likely to get you beaten up by the other kids for "putting on airs". Even though Sette's Da makes plenty of money and is more than able to afford shoes for her, he doesn't want her growing up feeling superior. Plus, Sette just doesn't like wearing shoes at this point.
-   The title character of _Go Get a Roomie!_ is a Shameless Fanservice Girl who prefers not to wear _anything_, but even when she is otherwise fully clothed she still won't put anything on her feet.
    
    **Lillian:** _\[points down at Roomie's bare feet\]_ Aren't you forgetting something?  
    **Roomie:** I am, aren't I? _\[leaves and comes back a panel later, wearing a headband\]_ NOW I'm ready!
    
-   Sydney Brooks, the titular character of _Sydney's Pokémon Adventure_, is a happy-go-lucky and ever-barefoot tomboy who became a Pokémon trainer four years late at the age of fourteen. She's never worn shoes because she's spent nearly all of her young life at home and never needed to. As a very young child, she would wear shoes and socks, but switched to bare feet when she got older, presumably to emulate her lazy brother who is also always barefoot. She happily embarked on her journey while remaining barefoot, because it's simply just what she's used to and the most comfortable in. She eventually gets _forced_ into a pair of shoes against her will — a rich girl gave her and her friend Neison tickets for the S.S. Anne as thanks for helping her out, but insisted on giving Sydney a full makeover once aboard, declaring that it would be much too embarrassing for someone of her social status to be seen associating with someone dressed like _that_. Sydney immediately changes out of the outfit after leaving the ship, though.
-   In _Yokoka's Quest_, Yokoka says in the first Q&A strip that she goes barefoot because she was never given any shoes, but she likes walking barefoot anyway.
-   Lee Meadows, the protagonist of _Roundhouse_. Since she's a Flying Brick, her feet presumably don't need any kind of protection, allowing her to go unshod without any problems. Her habitual shoelessness has only been acknowledged twice so far: In this comic, a bird poops directly onto her foot, prompting her friend to ask if it will get her to finally start wearing shoes, and in this one, she pretends that wearing shoes is her Kryptonite Factor that leaves her completely de-powered in an attempt to fool a couple of crooks into attacking her (though she oversells it a bit too much and they don't fall for it).
-   _Eureka Seven: Paradox Makers_: Claire Hannah is a Played for Drama example: she used to like shoes, but grew adverse to footwear when the sale of a pair of limited edition superhero boots made her neglect her grandmother, who collapsed in her garden, and shortly afterward died on Claire's high school graduation day. Now, she associates her guilt with shoes, and when Claire is alone or relaxing, she prefers to be strictly barefoot.
-   The eponymous Yoon Ina, AKA "Nina" of _The Barefoot Nina_, habitually goes barefoot whenever she can get away with it because she feels liberated when she takes her shoes off. The same applies to her socks.
-   Jackie from _Cats Way_ goes barefoot at the start, despite having easy access to shoes. Word of God is that she will start wearing open-toed shoes later in the story.
-   Shiro Watanabe of the webcomic K9 is only seen wearing shoes when forced to, to add to his crazy demeanor.
-   In _Dumbing of Age_, Sierra doesn't wear shoes. When Joyce first notices she's barefoot and asks how long that's been the case, Sierra says since sixth grade. She's the Dumbiverse counterpart of an _It's Walky!_ character known only as Tootsi, who was played for fanservice. (Tootsi was a member of SEMME's Squadron 48, the entire joke of which was that they consisted entirely of highly-sexed bisexual girls and Joe.)
-   Marine, the protagonist of the "Under Tale" webcomic "The First Human" takes off her boots shortly before falling into the Underground, and spends the rest of her adventure barefoot, much to the confusion of Flowey and other monsters.

-   In an obvious display of Author Appeal, _The Barefoot Sorority_, a series of stories by southerncrossfire44, is built around this trope. The concept is Exactly What It Says on the Tin. The first story is here. southerncrossfire44 has also written two other series, also available at his DeviantArt site: another Slice of Life story called _No Shoes Pizza_, and a Spy Drama called _Barefoot Agent_.
-   Gwenevere Singley's foppishly sociopathic shapeshifter Erroneous is always barefoot, even when he's engaged in espionage activities where shoes would help him blend better. He refuses to explain why, but it might be for the same reason he's not 100% comfortable wearing normal clothes even; he can do it, but if he's not required to wear something else, he prefers a slightly mangled chainmail robe under a long black coat. He's so anti-shoes that in a recent Christmas picture, he's actually transformed his feet into ice skate blades rather than just wearing a pair of skates.
-   Alexandra Hutton of _The Book of Stories OCT_, being a famous bookwriter, as well as working for a major publishing company, doesn't want to give a damn about wearing shoes: unless it's not needed, she will most probably wear sandals.
-   A lot of PodFrog's original characters either go barefoot or wear sandals, and his Author Avatar is often drawn barefoot as well.
-   JesuOtaku is barefoot more often than not, both in character and out.
    
    "I tend to walk around barefoot everywhere, even outside. Sometimes I'll even drive barefoot if I know I'm not going anywhere that requires shoes. Of course as Ed in the 4th year movie I was barefoot for a reason, but...yeah. Not often. When I do wear shoes: sandals and flipflops. Socks are rare with me. But my feet are clean! XD"
    
-   Vesta from _Beyond the Impossible_ always goes barefoot. It's even the first thing we learn about her when she’s introduced:
    
    _Vesta is a very strange waitress: she never wears shoes. She's also immortal._
    
-   Joanna Martin and Millie Smythe, two of Inspector Spacetime's associates. Joanna loathes shoes, and as they fall in love Millie follows her eventual wife's lead, although she once had All Women Love Shoes tendencies (and occasionally still does). They go on to form a team called the Barefoot Bounty Hunters.
-   Dina M Nealey prefers to go barefoot whenever possible, a preference shared by many of the characters in her work. Most notably, her Author Avatar Chibi-Dina is almost always drawn barefoot, and none of her Fae characters ever wear shoes or socks.
-   Mary of _Hi I'm Mary Mary_ is almost always barefoot. The only time she dons footwear of her own volition is a single occasion of her wearing socks in order to relieve her boredom by sliding across the hardwood floor of the house, and she takes them off once she's gotten bored of that too. She does wear boots when in the Garden, but they are part of an automatic Instant Costume Change that happens to her upon entering it. She does not seem to actually own any part of her "Garden outfit" since she can't find any of it in the house. Fittingly, in the ending she puts on her boots, getting ready to leave the house.
-   A lot of the female characters in ChipmunkRaccoonOz's Pokemon-related fan works have a strong preference for going barefoot as often as they can, and some canon characters in other fanfics are depicted without shoes as well. Chipmunk himself also has a preference for going barefoot whenever possible.
-   Alex Apollonov of _I did a thing_ is noticeably barefoot in almost all of his videos, even at times you'd think he'd _want_ to wear shoes, like when he works with machinery in his garage, or visits a beekeeper (though the beekeeper himself was only wearing flip-flops...), or cooks meat on the pavement in the Australian summer. It sometimes gets lampshaded, either when he injures himself this way or acknowledges the foot fetishists that follow his channel. When Alex took part in _Creator Clash_, a Youtuber boxing event, he wanted to fight barefoot but the boxing commission overseeing the matches wouldn't let him.
-   For a video, YouTuber Loser Ana spent a day without shoes, which she seemed to regret. Months later, she did it again, and again, until she started going barefoot full-time, even making a video to celebrate her newfound lifestyle. While she does wear shoes in Winter, they come off as soon as Spring arrives.
-   Dodger of _Press Heart To Continue_ prefers to walk _everywhere_ barefoot. She's admitted frequently on camera she loves being barefoot all the time, even when told she needs shoes onset or wandering over hot concrete. She'll even opt for bare feet in the **snow**. And rather adorably, her husband is just as much of a barefooter as she is.
-   _Roadkill_: David Freiberger will take any excuse to wear sandals or flip-flops instead of shoes (even if it's really impractical).
-   Adriene Mishler of _Yoga With Adriene_ almost always barefoot in her videos, although it's kind of understandable, as she _is_ a yoga instructor.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   Being a blind Earthbender, Toph uses the vibrations in the ground to sense around her. Toph does not like wearing shoes or having her feet touched, because doing so affects her vision. When she does have to wear shoes as a disguise, she kicks their soles off so her feet still make direct contact with the ground.
    -   Earthbenders in general tend to be averse to footwear, beyond sole-less coverings for the top of their feet. All Earthbenders seem unperturbed by rough terrain and a large portion of their bending is based on stances and foot work to manipulate the earth.
-   Cricket on _Big City Greens_ hates wearing shoes. Even at a dance, when he's otherwise in formal wear, he's barefoot. The only time he willingly wears shoes is in cold weather, treating it the same as wearing a jacket, or when playing a specific sport such as football or baseball.
-   Several of the children in _Craig of the Creek_ go barefoot:
    -   The Scratchless One, who indeed doesn't wear much of anything.
    -   Roger the Bridge Troll. Trolls don't wear shoes, after all.
    -   Wildernessa, who styles herself as a Nature Hero - though she does wear proper footwear in cold weather.
    -   The Sewer Queen, which makes sense considering she and her subjects always play in the water.
    -   Zoe, the guardian of Cardboard City. Even in the flashback of her first meeting with Carter, she was barefoot.
    -   The Muddy Buddies. Again, shoes would mostly get in the way when playing with mud.
-   _DuckTales (2017)_: While the majority of the cast are Barefoot Cartoon Animals as usual, Dewey is the first to explicitly state that he does not like wearing shoes, after trying out a pair. He even awkwardly stumbles around in pain while wearing shoes, though this seems to be because they were the wrong size for him.
-   Peter Griffin from _Family Guy_ went through this as a phase, going as far as to refer to shoes as "foot prisons". Since it was a Cutaway Gag, though, it's unknown if it actually happened.
-   _Kaeloo_: Played with. Kaeloo is a Funny Animal who does not wear any type of clothing or accessories, but it is explicitly stated that her being barefoot is a choice she makes because she's not a fan of shoes.
-   The natives on _Mike, Lu & Og_ don't have access to shoes, until one episode where a crate of them washes up on shore and they go nuts for them. The shoes end up causing them problems, so they give them up. Mike, on the other hand, is a Tomboy and therefore doesn't _like_ shoes (in the sense that All Women Love Shoes), but other than in the aforementioned episode, she is the only one who actually wears them.
-   Nisa from _Mission Odyssey_ doesn't wear shoes because she likes being barefoot. However, in episode 17, she and the others visit an icy land, and when they enter a kingdom warmed by magic crystals, the sweltering floor is too hot for her bare feet to handle. She's then given a pair of fur-lined shoes when their ruler notes she has sensitive feet unlike them, who have adapted to the conditions. Unfortunately, the citizens are all huge in stature and the shoes fall off quite easily, so she goes snooping around in the hope of finding a pair more her petite size and stumbles upon something she wasn't meant to see, resulting in her being taken captive. Ironically, the one time she wears shoes, the rest of her friends are alerted to the fact she's in trouble when one of the shoes falls off again as she's carted off to a dungeon and they find it in the snow. She reverts back to being a barefooter after this adventure. A couple of other characters don't wear shoes among the crew, either, being inhuman species.
-   Tommy Pickles from _Rugrats (1991)_ is almost always seen barefoot, in contrast to most of the other babies on the show. It is explained in the _A Day in the Life of Tommy_ book that the reason for this is because Tommy likes to feel the mud squish between his toes. The episodes in which Tommy does wear shoes are few and far between. This does not apply to his eleven-year-old counterpart in the _All Grown Up!_ spin-off.
-   Jesse from _Solar Opposites_. As she says in "The Unstable Grey Hole":
    
    **Jesse:** I like humans, but I hate shoes. Like, how are we supposed to taste the ground?
    
-   _Star Trek: The Animated Series_ introduces Lt. M'Ress, a Cat Folk alien who joins the Enterprise crew. She exemplies this trope as well as Barefoot Cartoon Animal; the official explanation is that she doesn't need (or want) footwear because of her thick pawpads, although the animators don't bother drawing them when her soles are visible.
-   _Tangled: The Series_ calls a lot more attention to Rapunzel's preference for going barefoot everywhere than the original movie did (which mentioned it a grand total of _once_, and even then not explicitly). "The Way of the Willow" introduces Rapunzel's aunt Willow, who shares a great many personality traits with her, including going barefoot. Another episode featured O.O.C. Is Serious Business, where Rapunzel willingly wearing shoes is a sign to Eugene that something is _very_ wrong. By the final season, she's even stopped wearing them in the snow (or any other winter clothing for that matter, just wearing her standard Limited Wardrobe instead) while in the earlier seasons she would bundle up and put on some boots.
-   _ThunderCats_: The Drifter, a Rascally Rabbit, seems a typical Barefoot Cartoon Animal, but a flashback reveals that he was The One Who Wears Shoes until a traumatic event caused him to abandon the trait, and acquire a more disheveled appearance, with tattered clothes and Messy Hair.
-   The title character of Canadian/French series _Tupu_ is the "Wild Girl of Central Park". As such she generally wears a T-shirt and slacks but no shoes. Her logo is a bare footprint.
