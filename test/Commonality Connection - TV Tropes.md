_Once in a hotel dining-room, I said, rather too loudly, "I loathe prunes."  
"So do I," came an unexpected six-year-old voice from another table.  
Sympathy was instantaneous. Neither of us thought it funny. We both knew that prunes are far too nasty to be funny. That is the proper meeting between man and child as independent personalities._

— **C. S. Lewis**, "On Three Ways of Writing For Children"

Two characters, strangers or hostile to each other, accidentally discover a common thing. It can be an interest, a past experience or a background, but it foments friendship between them. For dramatic purposes, this is often between extremely different characters.

It can also mark the deepening of an existing relationship.

Lies can sometimes backfire when another character thinks it's this trope; see I Am One of Those, Too.

Compare Fire-Forged Friends; note that merely finding they were both soldiers or the like is this, though if they fought in some of the same battles, it may shade into that. For much more extensive commonalities, see Birds of a Feather. Also compare Lonely Together.

Contrast "Not So Different" Remark and Opposites Attract. Supertrope of Bonding over Missing Parents and A Shared Suffering. The lack of this drives Joins to Fit In. Examples that do not precede a friendship may go under The One Thing I Don't Hate About You.

    **Critic:** Those are the best.  
    **Douchey:** They _are_ the best!

    **Douchey:** I love them, too—I MEAN, OOOOOOOOH! How dare we almost find something in common!
    
-   _Sword Art Online Abridged_ makes both Kirito and Kayaba into this who both complain about the other players of the game as annoying pissants, considers themselves a massive cut above normal people due to their intellect, but what really clinches the deal for Kayaba is that Kirito is as big of a Movie Nerd as he is, and they both love to spout movie quotes that nobody else gets; it was one of the many things that allowed for Kirito to deduce Kayabas' secret identity as Heathcliff.
    
    **Kirito:** You're the only one I've ever met in this game who makes as many movie references as I do.  
    **Kayaba:** Ah yes, I guess I should have known that would... Wait. _You get my references?!_  
    **Kirito:** Um, yes. I just remembered-  
    **Kayaba:** "There Can Be Only One."  
    **Kirito:** Oh, ah _Highlander_.  
    **Kayaba:** "Well who you gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"  
    **Kirito:** _Duck Soup_ Marx Brothers, 1933.  
    **Kayaba:** "DRY LAND IS NOT A MYTH! I HAVE _SEEEEN IIITTTT!!_"  
    **Kirito:** Ah, getting tricky are we? While that line is famously attributed to the 1995 film _WaterWorld_, it is never actually spoken in the movie.  
    **Kayaba:** ...Hot damn, you're the real deal.
    
-   _Mystery Incorporated (2022)_: Velma reaches out to Freddie because she knows what it's like to lose a parent and because he's looking up demonology like her mother does.

    Real Life 

-   C. S. Lewis recounts in _Surprised By Joy_ when he went to visit a sick neighbor when he was a boy.

-   Psychologists found that in an experiment where people could punish their partners for errors, if you told the people that the (invisible) partner had a thumbprint that was classified in the same group as them, they would punish this partner less. Even if the person doing the punishing was a textbook narcissist.
-   Starring together on _Star Trek: The Original Series_, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy became friends in no small part thanks to learning they were both Jewish (Nimoy had an Orthodox Jewish upbringing, Shatner had a Reform Jewish upbringing).

-   Cops who play the "Good Cop" in interrogation will often start off "befriending" the suspect by chatting with them about sports, etc., or claiming to understand their feelings of anger towards the victim. Many suspects will inevitably slip up.
-   Similarly, this is a tactic used to survive being held hostage or taken prisoner by enemy soldiers. Enforcing your humanity to them to elicit sympathy and sharing similarities such as children you both have or even mutual interests makes it harder for them to mistreat you since they begin to connect with you on a personal level and no longer merely see you as "prisoners." Even something as simple as looking a gunman in the eye makes it more difficult for them to shoot you by evoking this.
