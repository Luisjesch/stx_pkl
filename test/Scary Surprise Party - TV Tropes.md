A character is kidnapped and told that something nasty will happen unless they go somewhere. It turns out to be a Surprise Party. An elaborate Practical Joke. Often the end game of Friendly Scheming; also often a subtrope of Kidnapped by an Ally. Contrast with Shock Party, when the "Scary" part is all too real.

    Literature 

-   A short variant occurs in _The Curse of Chalion_: On a leisurely ride in the countryside, Cazaril and the princess he's working for are surprised by a band of robbers who turn out to be mostly young nobles meeting them for an unexpected picnic.

    Live-Action TV

-   Used a couple of times in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    
    -   Played with in "Surprise." The Computer Science teacher, Jenny Calendar, whom the audience has just learned has a hidden agenda, intercepts Buffy on her way to a meeting with Giles, and tells Buffy he's asked her to take Buffy to meet him elsewhere. The audience is led to believe that Jenny is up to no good, but it turns out she's just taking Buffy to her surprise party. Though as Buffy runs into some vampires on the way, it's something of an inverted trope.
    
    _(Buffy crashes through the window and dusts a vampire.)_  
    **Cordelia:** _(leaping up from hiding)_ Surprise!  
    **Oz:** Actually, that pretty much sums it up.

    **Buffy:** Don't be so sure...
    
-   Done memorably on _Castle_ when Richard Castle, laid up in a wheelchair with a broken leg, is convinced he witnessed a murder in the apartment across the street.

Castle meets Esposito and Ryan outside the apartment and charges in...just as the lights turn on to reveal the surprise party.
-   _Chuck_'s friends attempt to kidnap him as practice for his soon-to-be brother-in-law's bachelor party. Which they aren't invited to.

-   _Columbo_: In "Candidate for Crime," having just murdered his campaign manager, the murderer sneaks into his own home and flicks off several lights, plunging his wife into the dark. He then sneaks up behind her and claps his hand over her mouth. Then the lights turn on and guests yell surprise. The whole thing was a surprise party he organized as part of his alibi.
-   Spoofed in a sketch by Conan O'Brien, where they showed "foreign Reality TV Shows". One of them was "Surprise Party or Coup?" where African dictators are led to a room, and they have to guess whether it's a surprise party or a coup d'etat. "Yes, it's a party... a _murder_ party!"
-   One episode of _CSI_ has the male leads abducting one of The Lab Rats as he's leaving the building, to take him out for a birthday dinner. Unfortunately for the birthday boy, the "party" keeps going downhill even after The Reveal.

-   _Dexter's_ buddies bag him up and toss him in the trunk of a car in order to escort him to his bachelor party. Problem is, Dex was already anticipating a rival killer's plot against him, and so he escapes his bonds and deals a fierce punch to Masuka's eye when his friend opens the trunk. Whoops.
-   The staff at _ER_ frequently used made-up medical emergencies as a way to get the victim into the room where the surprise party was being held. And they could never say no and take the chance of it being a real emergency.

-   For _Monk_'s birthday, Natalie decides that she will throw him a surprise party, no matter what. After her first few attempts fail because Monk figures out she's planning a party and refuses to go with her, in the middle of a case, she has someone follow them, gets the captain to fake a warning about them being followed and in danger, convinces Monk to hide in a dumpster, getting them wheeled into the surprise party. Monk (and probably the viewers) never saw it coming for once.
-   On _Titus_, Christopher Titus remembers (in a flashback) the surprise party for an uncle. As the lights came up and people started to yell surprise he started shooting. Then he realized what it was and said "Aw, you guys."
-   The _Two Twisted_ episode "Finding Frank" has a security guard's colleague disappearing and calling out desperately over his walkie-talkie. When the guard goes to find him it turns out to be a surprise retirement party, but it goes terribly wrong when the nervous guard overreacts, firing his gun when the lights come on, killing his wife. But as the guard is being led away, he drops a bit of paper that his colleague picks up. It's an invitation to the party with the exact time, location and everything, showing that the guard knew all along and used the party to kill his wife, framing it as accident. It's even better when you know the actor who plays the guard played a put-upon Extreme Doormat in his most famous role.

    Video Games 

-   In _Ao Oni_ 3.0, this trope is cruelly subverted. The hero, Hiroshi, is suddenly attacked by the monster that has been chasing him and murdering all his friends, only for the Oni's head to pop off, revealing that it was a guy in a suit all along and that the whole ordeal was just a setup for a surprise birthday party. Pity that this turns out to be just a dream, and his friends really _are_ dead.

-   _The Lord of the Rings Online_ has a quest in which you're told how an NPC overheard part of a sinister plot and wants you to investigate. When you arrive, a bunch of suspicious characters with gangster-style nicknames greet you as a fellow conspirator.

-   In the third _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_ game's fifth case, Larry Butz has a crush on the defendant, Iris. However, he's so bad at writing love notes that his request to her to come see him in the middle of the night for a romantic excursion is taken instead as blackmail, especially since Larry believes Iris has a secret love for him. However, Iris took this "secret" to mean something different and much more plot-relevant...
-   Deconstructed in a sidequest in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_, where an extremely paranoid Imperial officer became convinced his men were plotting against him and had them all executed, despite the fact that they were simply planning a surprise party for his promotion.

-   In _the white chamber_, the comedic ending which requires you to get six chalk marks (six good deeds) to obtain. As Sarah leaves the White Chamber, she returns to the ship via the vent duct only to see everyone shouting "Surprise!". It turns out it was her birthday and her surprise was being scared to death. Sarah and the crew make no mention whatsoever of the horrors she just encountered (or the fact that she was impaled at one point and electrocuted at another) and sit down to have cake. The ship is then unexpectedly blown apart by an asteroid, but instead of an explosion, a bubble appears that says "BANG".

    Western Animation

-   The _Sealab 2021_ episode "Der Dieb". What annoyed Quinn was not only the abuse they put him through to get him to his birthday party (which involved getting the crap beaten out of him after Captain Murphy declared "Martian law"), but also the fact that it wasn't actually his birthday.
    
    "Broken hands, get it?! Broken hands!"
    
-   Featured in _The Simpsons_. In "Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind", an episode reminiscent of _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_, Homer's journey to track down the secret of his erased memories lead to a surprise party on a party boat.
    -   Even stranger was that this was _entirely self-inflicted_. Homer accidentally found out about the party early, and so arranged events so that he would eventually find his way to the party boat after taking a drink that wiped his memories of the event save for specific bits that caused him to come to the wrong conclusions.
-   A variant in _The Venture Brothers_ has The Monarch's henchmen throw him a surprise party. He's surprised in the wrong way. He catches on only after he shoots one of them in the face with a poisonous dart, thinking it was an ambush.

    Real Life 

-   Legendary jazz pianist Fats Waller was kidnapped on leaving a performance in Chicago in 1926 by four armed men. Given that there may well have been people with serious personal grudges against him, he was naturally terrified.

He was allegedly allowed to leave three days later, very drunk, exhausted, and with several thousand dollars in tips.
