Feed the birds, tuppence a bag...

_Early each day to the steps of Saint Paul's  
The little old Bird Woman comes,  
In her own special way to the people she calls,  
"Come, buy my bags full of crumbs."_

A homeless person with a loyal animal companion. Usually a clear signifier that they're a good guy and not one of the Crazy Homeless People. Note that this refers to all kinds of animal companions among the homeless. Pigeons, for whatever reason, are the most common.

Interestingly, even though pigeons are generally considered Feathered Fiends by the populace at large (some cities have regulations against feeding them), most characters with pigeon friends are portrayed in a favorable light. Probably has something to do with helping the helpless.

Crazy Cat Lady is a far more negative portrayal, though cats are generally agreed to be fluffy and cute. Older female Kindhearted Cat Lovers can have a similar vibe to this pigeon trope but without the negativity of Crazy Cat Lady in terms of portrayal. Also see Crazy Homeless People.

-   _Mary Poppins_ sings a song to Jane and Michael about the Bird Woman (providing both the page quote and the image), a poor old women who sells bread crumbs to feed the pigeons with on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral. Later on in the movie, Mr. Banks prohibits them from buying birdfeed from her with the tuppence he was going to have them invest at the bank. Close to the end, when Mr Banks soberly walks through London to the bank to be fired, he comes across the empty steps of the cathedral, with the heavy implication that she died, and that his children will never show kindness to her thanks to his callousness.
    
    _"Feed the birds, tuppence a bag,  
    Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag!  
    Feed the birds! That what she cries  
    While overhead her birds fill the skies."_

-   Subversion: Franz Liebkind, the crazy Nazi playwright from _The Producers_. Here, the pigeons prove that he is one of the Crazy Homeless People beyond a reasonable doubt. Mainly because he uses them for his crazy Nazi hijinx.

-   The title character from _Wizard of the Pigeons_, an Urban Fantasy novel by Megan Lindholm.
-   Mrs Tachyon, the time-travelling bag lady from Terry Pratchett's Johnny Maxwell Trilogy, has a pet cat (only the one, so she avoids being a Crazy Cat Lady through a technicality). Mrs Tachyon is a fairly benevolent, though totally incoherent, character; the cat is pure evil.

In her grief, Tita takes to living in the dove-cote and treating the doves as children.
-   The Duck Man in _Discworld_ appears to be an example of this trope. However, conversation will reveal that he is, or claims to be, completely unaware of the duck that gives him his name, despite the fact it's on his head.
-   Merivel in Restoration by Rose Tremain could be seen as this by the rather non-sequitur end of the story - he has lost much, but at least the King has given him some pigeons in the house he once occupied.
-   Blake Thorburn of _Pact_ has mentioned that he fit this trope during the period in which he was homeless after running away from his Big, Screwed-Up Family, which led him to get bird tattoos and influences his general bird motif, which includes sharing the personality traits usually associated with birds, having a Familiar who takes the form of a sparrow, and bleeding feathers when cut.

-   _Neverwhere_ has Old Bailey, who lives with the birds and dresses like them too, although this variation also sells rooks and starlings at the market.
    
    **Old Bailey:** Fine wise birds - tasty and wise!

    **Yemana**: The pigeons.
    
-   Claude from _Heroes_. He basically walks a fine line between this and Crazy Homeless Person.
