Need to report a crime? She's all ears.

Rabbits and hares (the latter of which includes the so-called "jackrabbits") are usually presented as the good guys in fiction, if not The Hero outright.

This is a result of What Measure Is a Non-Cute?; adorable fuzzy animals are usually on the side of good, and ugly creepy ones are usually the bad guys. As such, expect them to have a common predator for an enemy, like foxes, snakes or wolves. In addition, there is a tendency for rabbits and hares to gravitate towards roles as the main character of a work, not only because their cute looks make them fitting for such a role, but also because they possess a higly distinct appearance thanks to their most recognizable physical trait: A pair of unusually elongated ears. This characteristic thus lends itself easily to the rule that main characters should possess signature design traits that set them apart from the rest of the cast.

This positive portrayal of lagomorphs is by no means universal, but it's common enough that subverting it has become its own trope. Inversions and subversions are usually a Hair-Raising Hare. Even then, it should be telling that scary rabbits are often treated more as a twist of expectations than something more natural.

A Rascally Rabbit can also be a Righteous Rabbit, as long as its trickery is aimed at people who deserve it, Doc.

This is a subtrope to Good Animals, Evil Animals and Herbivores Are Friendly and is also a type of Animal Stereotype. Compare Nice Mice, Bunnies for Cuteness and Cute Kitten.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

    Anime and Manga 

-   In Osamu Tezuka's 1965 manga _The Amazing 3_ (_Wonder 3_ or _W3_ in Japan), Bokko (Captain Bunny or Bonnie in some English versions) is the kind-hearted leader of an alien trio who transform themselves into Earth animals to study humanity. Disguised as a White Bunny, Bokko and her teammates (who pose as a duck and a horse) befriend a human boy, a relationship that eventually saves the world. The aliens were sent to Earth because the Galactic Federation is afraid that humanity's violent nature makes them a threat to the universe. The heroes' friendship with the boy convinces them that humans should be given time to evolve instead of being destroyed.
-   _Cat Shit One_ features rabbits as the good guys.
-   Terriermon and Lopmon from _Digimon Tamers_ both resemble rabbits, a semblance that grows stronger as they digivolve. The former is one of the three main Digimon from the start, while the latter undergoes a Heel–Face Turn late in the show (though Terriermon is more meant to resemble a dog more than a rabbit, hence the name). Not only that, but Lopmon within the genre as a whole has a final form called Cherubimon, which as the name suggests, is modeled after the holy angels Cherubim.
-   Angoramon from _Digimon Ghost Game_ is a very fluffy rabbit and the kindest of the series' three partner Digimon, being very protective of the main characters and Ruli in particular. He's also formed strong friendships with other Digimon that have been stranded in the human world.
-   _Jewelpet_: Most of the titular characters are good-aligned by definition; The Heroine Ruby is the best example in the series.
-   In _Made in Abyss_, Nanachi's bunny-like appearance is a clue that they're a good person, despite their initial rudeness.
-   Patty Rabbit, the main heroine of the 1986 series _Maple Town_, is a kindhearted, brave, and cute rabbit who spends most of her time with her family and friends. She's also very serious when it comes to rescuing her friends from a wolf who is the main antagonist of the series.
-   Hare from the _Monster Rancher_ anime is an annoying and mischievous, but ultimately good rabbit monster.
-   _My Hero Academia_: Invoked with pro-Hero Rumi Usagiyama, AKA Mirko. Her Quirk, Rabbit, grants her long, rabbit-like ears and immense leg strength, which is very suitable for her style of fighting.
-   Wenet from _Oh, Suddenly Egyptian God_ is a kind-hearted hare deity, helping out the other deities' messily planted crops while they're asleep, by replanting them and growing them overnight.
-   In _Sailor Moon,_ the main character Usagi. Usagi means 'rabbit,' and not in some distant, esoteric "Genius Bonus for those who know the etymology" way; it's a very standard word. Her name is straight-up "Rabbit" and more than one foreign dub names her "Bunny." Her Girlish Pigtails are pretty much symbolic rabbit ears and there's a rabbit pattern on a lot of her things. Her full name, Usagi Tsukino, translates to "Rabbit of the Moon." (As for why, there's a pattern of craters and darker spots on the moon that's said to resemble a rabbit, so there's an association between rabbits and the moon in a lot of Eastern... stuff. It's less common, but _not_ unheard of, outside of China and Japan.)
-   In the _Star Wars: Visions_ episode "Lop and Ochō", Lop is a kind-hearted, idealistic, rabbit-like alien who is quite capable of wielding a lightsaber with some skill when she has to.
-   Milk, one of the _Yes! Pretty Cure 5_ mascots, is a bunny, and while she's a stuck-up tsundere, she's also the only mascot as of this writing to gain both a human form and superpowers instead of just one, the other, or neither.

    Comic Books 

    Films — Animation 

-   Lucky Jack from _Home on the Range_ is a friendly fellow who helps the cows capture Alameda Slim.
-   Boingo in _Hoodwinked!_ subverts this trope, by virtue of turning out to be the mastermind behind the "Goodie Bandit" robberies.
-   Bunnymund from _Rise of the Guardians_, a six-foot-tall Awesome Aussie take on the Easter Bunny. Like the other guardians, he's a heroic figure dedicated to protecting children, and he specifically acts as the Guardian of Hope.
-   The poor but loving rabbit family from Disney's _Robin Hood (1973)_ are definitely sympathetic, complete with one of the children being the film's Kid-Appeal Character.
-   Another Disney example is Judy Hopps from _Zootopia_ (pictured above), who joins the police force hoping to make the world a better place.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Roger Rabbit from _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ is a heroic Nice Guy, even if a little bit off-kilter.

    Literature 

-   In _Redwall_, the few rabbit characters seen are fussy, complaining females or their Henpecked Husbands. Hares, on the other hand, are unambiguously heroic (and very, very British).
-   In the children's book series _Sweet Pickles_ we have Responsible Rabbit, a Funny Animal rabbit who works as a banker and could out-do Twilight Sparkle in OCD habits.
-   In _The Unexplored Summon://Blood-Sign_, the summoner who's famous for never killing his enemies and answering all requests for help is called Alice (with) Rabbit.
-   The protagonist rabbits in _Watership Down_ are the heroes of the work, and from their perspective pretty much every other animal is a slavering hellbeast (while Humans Are Cthulhu). However, most of the true villains are also rabbits, so it's a Zig-Zagging Trope.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The titular hero of _Kamen Rider Build_ has a variety of animal and object-themed superpowers, but his primary form is RabbitTank. The Rabbit side is portrayed as being symbolic of his heroic ideals and desire for peace, while the Tank side reflects the inescapable fact that he was created to be a weapon of war. Notably, in the few times one side is given precedence over the other, it's always the Rabbit.
-   The Yellow Ranger in _Tokumei Sentai Go Busters_ and _Power Rangers Beast Morphers_ is rabbit-themed. Part of the concept is that the Rangers have different physical skills, with the rabbit representing leaping ability where the Red Ranger's cheetah is speed and Blue's gorilla is strength.

    Myths and Religion 

-   The Rabbit is the fourth year of the Eastern Zodiac. This is because she tried to go across the river by hopping on some rocks. She ended up falling on a log, which took her to the finish line.
-   The rabbit's association with the moon is because of another story from Chinese Mythology that shows this trope. One day, an old man was walking through the woods and he complained that he was hungry. Three animals heard that and decided to help the man. The monkey started gathering fruits, and the fox looked if there was some meat he could get quickly. The rabbit, however, was outsourced as it only knew how to get grass. It then proceeded to make a fire and throw itself in it, as a means of offering itself. The old man then revealed himself to be the Boddhisatva and the rabbit was not burned, but granted access to the moon, where it keeps Chang'e company. The rabbit in the moon<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is seen pounding the elixir of life, its shape formed out of the craters on the moon.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Bunnies & Burrows_, which was inspired by _Watership Down_. The PCs are rabbits that go on adventures. and are generally expected to act heroically. Although given how RPG players frequently act...
-   Trix Condello from _Crimestrikers_ is another Guile Hero/Karmic Trickster. She starts as a Con Artist (albeit with a Just Like Robin Hood moral code), but after a life-changing encounter with the titular heroes, she does a Heel–Face Turn and joins the team to use her skills for good.

    Theatre 

-   Rabbits Kingdom follows the heroic adventures of two rabbit kings and their entourages. They interact with kingdoms of other animals — wolves, birds, mice — all of whom seem to look up to the rabbits.

    Video Games 

-   Double Subverted in _AdventureQuest_, which has a werehare as a pet usable in combat. It looks terrifying and ferocious, but deals Light damage which is usually associated in-game with good.
-   Guren from _Bound by Blades_ is one of The Bound, a trio of heroic animal warriors out to save their kingdom from an Ancient Evil. She's also the only girl in the team.
-   Clive, one half of the titular duo of _Clive 'N' Wrench_ is a rabbit on the trail of an escaped time-traveling criminal while being assisted by his monkey sidekick Wrench.
-   Usalia from _Disgaea 5_ is a wererabbit and arguably one of the nicest characters in the series. She's so nice that she ends up being a catalyst for "Christo" aka Lamington's future goals as seen in the first game.
    -   Double Subverted with her Berserker state, especially post chapter 10 when it becomes Usalia's overload skill. Its not evil, just very dangerous to the point of being one of the best overload skills in the game.
-   _Dusty Revenge_, an action game set in a world of sentient animals, have the titular character being a heroic rabbit on a quest of revenge against the villains who killed his girlfriend. Before he discovers he's The Chosen One to stop a villain from recovering a doomsday artifact. The prequel _Dusty Raging Fist_ have Dusty as the hero who saves the world from the forces of darkness again.
-   This would have been the case in _Kingsley's Adventure_, the titular character being originally conceived as a rabbit before being changed into a fox someways through development.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_, going into the Dark World without the Moon Pearl makes you change your shape based on your personality. Link, being a good guy, is transformed into a rabbit.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_, the Zonai are revealed to have been a race of benevolent bestial-looking humanoids with vaguely rabbit-like appearances, primarily in their Unusual Ears. In ancient times, they helped uplift the Hylians to an advanced civilization after descending from their home in Floating Islands high above Hyrule, and they fought side-by-side with the Hyrulean races against Ganondorf in the ancient Imprisoning War. Their king, Rauru, serves the same role as King Rhoam in helping Link acclimate to the world and his new powers, as granted by the right arm Fused to Link (the arm in question belonged to Rauru when he was alive, and was the only part of him left over when the seal on Ganondorf finally failed).
-   Most rabbits in _Lonely Wolf Treat_ are racist jerks towards predators. However, there are a few notable exceptions, namely Mochi, Boreas and Annie.
-   _Moshi Monsters_ has the Funny Bunnies, a species of benevolent rabbits who tell jokes.
-   Zig-Zagged in _The Night of the Rabbit_: The Marquis de Hoto is sometimes enigmatic, does seem to be well-intentioned, but some characters hint to his apprentice (the player character) that he may have sinister ulterior motives. He turns out to be just as good as he claims, thus playing the trope straight. However, he also turns out not to be the _real_ Marquis de Hoto; he is, in fact, a _memory_ of the rabbit that the Marquis de Hoto was in the past. The _real_ Marquis de Hoto subverts the trope, having undergone a Face–Heel Turn and been imprisoned some time before the events of the game started.
-   _Paladog_ has Hood the archer (Rabbit Hood, geddit?), who is easily the most useful of all your allies (despite that list including bears, rhinos, penguin wizards, bomb-throwing pirate monkeys and dragons) because his special attacks plow through all enemies. Using only Hoods causes what can best be described as a Wave-Motion Gun that can kill enemies before they're even spotted and severely weaken the enemy's base.

-   Cream the Rabbit from _Sonic the Hedgehog_, a young bunny girl who joins Sonic's group after she rescues her mother from Eggman in _Sonic Advance 2_. Assisting Cream is her lovable Chao companion, Cheese.
-   _Spyro: Year of the Dragon_ introduces bunny-girl Bianca, apprentice to The Sorceress. She tries to come off as threatening and scare the heroes away, but it's very quickly clear that her heart's just not in it. She's only helping the Sorceress capture dragon eggs because their world's magic is drying up. Once she finds out the _real_ reason her mistress wants all those baby dragons, she immediately switches sides to help Team Spyro defeat the Sorceress and rescue the remaining eggs. Also, she hooks up with Spyro's buddy Hunter.

-   _TinkerQuarry_: Peter, the first toy to show genuine concern for the protagonist and join the party, is a golden plush rabbit.
-   _Touhou Project_: While she was originally introduced as a haughty and cowardly boss character in her debut game, Reisen Udongein Inaba has developed into a completely heroic character. She's one of the most level-headed characters in the series and will occasionally solve incidents. In fact, she's one of the four playable characters in _Touhou Kanjuden ~ Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom_, going back to her birthplace on the Moon to stop the invasion of Gensokyo.
-   _Zombidle_ has the residents of Talar Country, who are all rabbit-people. Their knights, king, and wizard actively fight against the evil Bob the Necromancer and his legions of undead and demons. Since you play as Bob the Necromancer, these rabbit-people are your enemies. You can also have their king subvert this trope by bribing him, after which he'll help Bob to destroy the very country he rules over.
-   _Jazz Jackrabbit_: All the rabbits in the games are portrayed as good guys who fight against the forces of Devan Shell.

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Adventures of the American Rabbit_, a hero with superhero powers is born once a generation specifically in a village of rabbits.
-   The hares in _The Animals of Farthing Wood_ are the most useful animals in the group who can't fight or fly, as their speed allows them to deliver messages and warnings quickly, partake in search parties efficiently, and their vibration detection allows them to be among the first to sense danger. While the rabbits are also mainstays of the protagonist cast, their tendency to panic and need constant saving makes them less heroic.
-   The 2006 revival of _Biker Mice from Mars_ had the Biker Mice work together with a group of benevolent alien rabbits in the episode "First Mice on the Moon".
-   Many Bugs Bunny short films had Bugs in a heroic role where he (in Joe Adamson's words) "fought Yosemite Sam because it was the right thing to do." Of course, he'd use his wiles and sense of being a Karmic Trickster in his battles.
-   _Crusader Rabbit,_ the first cartoon star created specifically for TV, is probably the Ur-Example. He's a smart and brave little guy who, with assistance from his pal Ragland T. Tiger, is never afraid to tilt at windmills.
-   _Doctor Snuggles_ features Benji and Freddy, two rabbits who are friends of Doctor Snuggles and also help him with his inventions.

Alix is apparently destined to wield her powers as the Future Badass heroine Bunnyx.

-   The Drifter from the _Thunder Cats 2011_ episode "The Duelist and the Drifter" is this, although he's also an eccentric Trickster Mentor. He brings himself out of an Heroic BSoD involving the episode's villain to guide Lion-O to victory.
