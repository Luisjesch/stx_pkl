**Angry Mob:** TRAITOR! GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM!  
**Green Lantern:** BACK OFF! She doesn't have to take that from you people!  
**Hawkgirl:** Yes, I do. But that's okay. I deserve some of it, I guess.  
**Woman:** _\[taking Hawkgirl's hand and motioning to her daughter\]_ You saved our lives. God bless you, Chica Halcon.  
**Green Lantern:** You deserve that, too.

A former villain has undergone a Heel–Face Turn. They've become The Atoner. They have worked hard to help others, at great risk to themselves. And they've managed to avoid a sudden case of Redemption Equals Death.

They're not looking for thanks. They're not looking to be treated special. They probably might not even think they're worthy of anyone's gratitude. They might even think that they're still hated for their past misdeeds. Indeed, they've had several people tell them that they won't forgive them for their past crimes. They might even be on the edge of deciding Then Let Me Be Evil.

And then, suddenly, someone acknowledges that they've reformed, that they're a better person.

And just that acknowledgement is enough to give them hope. In a crisis, where they were on the edge of the Despair Event Horizon, they may now get a Heroic Second Wind. They may even become The Determinator, in the process.

It may overlap with a You Are Better Than You Think You Are speech.

Sometimes, however, the acknowledgement might come after the former villain does a Heroic Sacrifice, putting Redemption Equals Death back into effect, in which case, those who refused to acknowledge their repentance will have a Jerkass Realization and mourn the fallen (and now acknowledged) hero.

Has overlap with Because You Were Nice to Me. Compare and Contrast Morality Pet/Chain.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Freya from _Doraemon: Nobita's Drifts in the Universe_ betrays the rest of the heroes, selling out Doraemon, Nobita, Lian, and the rest of the Space Knights to Angolmois and the Independence Army due to believing she's helping the Milky Way Drifting Fleet find a new home, only to have a Heel Realization after Angolmois have everyone imprisoned, returning to help everyone escape. Her subsequent Redemption Promotion has Lian telling everyone else, "I want you all to meet our latest friend", that friend being none other than Freya.
-   _Martian Successor Nadesico_: Admiral Fukube was responsible for causing the Chulip to crash on Akito's colony, which he only learned well into their mission on Mars. Akito is outraged and assaults him. When they're faced with an overwhelming force of Jovian forces, and the ship is too damaged to fight back, the Admiral uses a UEF ship to force the Nadesico into an open Chulip, then puts his ship between the Nadesico and the Jovians, saying he hopes it makes up for his past mistakes. Akito angrily rejects it at the time. Then it turns out many months later that the Admiral survived and was taken as a prisoner of war. Given how Akito reacts to his survival, it seems he'd learned to forgive him in the intervening time.
-   The former No.2, now the current No.1 hero Endeavor in _My Hero Academia_ may not have been a villain, but his behavior certainly qualified in forcing his wife into a marriage for the sake of producing a child powerful enough to surpass the former No.1 (leading to her getting pregnant four times), then putting his children that he saw promise in through **serious** abusive "training", all for the sake of his own dream to be better than All Might. It's only when the No.1 retires and Endeavor is thrust into the spot without actually believing he earned it that he's forced to change, and has a Heel Realization of all the damage he's done. Unfortunately, that includes being the cause of his wife's mental breakdown and his eldest son's death or so he thought, his daughter constantly having to play peacekeeper between him and his second son Natsuo who utterly loathes his guts, and his third son Shoto who for the longest time, refused to even use the power he inherited from his father purely out of spite. When he rescues his second son from a villain's attack, Endeavor expresses that he never expects forgiveness from his family, but he will continue to try and atone for his past actions, never once disputing their hatred for him and even planning to have them all move into a different home from him, both to shelter them from further danger and remove them from the bad memories of their childhood with him. While Natsuo still harbors anger towards him, he at least learns to be more civil, and Shoto even opts to intern at his father's agency, to learn under his tutelage properly and as a way to bond genuinely.

-   _X-Men_: Reeling from the effects of Carol Danvers' personality in her head, Rogue leaves the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and joins the X-Men. Most of them threaten to quit if she's allowed in, but Xavier convinces them to stay. When Logan's fiance, Mariko, treats her more kindly than her own team, Rogue takes a blast meant for Mariko. This earns her Logan's respect and trust, and he offers to let her "borrow" his Healing Factor with her power. She refuses, pointing out that it could hurt him. This only further convinces him that she's sincere in her efforts to redeem, and he touches her, loaning her his power anyway. It took a little longer for the rest of the X-Men to trust her, but she had a good and faithful friend in Wolverine from that day forward.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Peace Not Promised_: Lily's father Martin is initially opposed to her and Severus dating, knowing that Severus comes from an abusive household, and that he has called Lily a racial slur once when he lost his temper (but not knowing that Severus is now several decades older and has spent that time regretting his choices), and Severus acknowledges that he has cause. However, after observing Severus over the summer holidays, seeing his dedication to keeping his word, his sincere devotion to Lily, and his respect, Martin decides that he has indeed changed.
    
    _Lily had told me you are a changed man. Something I am inclined to agree with, but I suppose that is what growing up is about. I had been so worried for my daughter when she first told me about her plans with you. But you laid them to rest with your behaviour and demeanour over the holidays. You are not the boy you once were, and you are certainly not your father._
    

    Film — Animated 

-   _FernGully_: Zach tells the Fairies that the humans were the ones who have been cutting down the trees in the forest as Hexxus and The Leveler approach Fern Gully. The Fairies seem to be doing a Heel–Face Door-Slam, brushing past him. Batty, however, who has been very anti-human the whole film, acknowledges Zach's efforts.
    
    **Batty:** You know, Zach, the truth doesn't always win friends, but it certainly influences people. You're not half-bad, for a homonid.

Someone later remarks that the man he was pre-Alexis would have gone over to the pirates for real.

    Live Action TV 

-   _The Rifleman_: This shows up a few times, usually preceded by a bout of Reformed, but Rejected. One particular standout example occurs when a new preacher and his son come to Northfork. At first Lucas McCain plans to be welcoming but recognizes the man as a former gunfighter and troublemaker who'd used brutal tactics to run farmers and ranchers off their land and even burned a records office in order to steal land for resale before disappearing. The priest insists he's no longer that man, having undergone a spiritual change after being confronted by one of his victims, but McCain accuses him of only using his collar as a shield against his past. Sure enough, a pair of bounty hunters arrive in Northfork to stir up trouble, citing the preacher's past to his new parishioners and even embellishing it to provoke the preacher back to violence so they could kill him. Pushed to the brink, the man begs Lucas for some guidance on what to do, as he doesn't want to let his son down, only to be rebuffed. Finally he decides to spare his son the shame of so disreputable a father and confronts the bounty hunters, ready to lose the gunfight and end their cruelty. Lucas intervenes at the last minute, deciding that the callous outlaw the priest had once been would never have been willing to confront death. In the end, McCain offers to help the priest rebuild his reputation with the town, accepting his reformation as genuine.

She tells Negan that while she'll never forgive him, she won't actively hate him anymore, and acknowledges that he and his new wife Annie deserve to have a fresh start together as part of the survivor community without fear of retaliation from her.
