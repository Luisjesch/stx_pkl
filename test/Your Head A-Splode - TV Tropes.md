Homer got a little ahead of himself.

**Hans:** A head can't really explode just because it's shot, right?  
**Marty:** It can. If it's filled with explosives.

Stuff Blowing Up is cool enough, but it somehow becomes even cooler when that stuff is human heads. Asploding heads may not be particularly realistic in some cases, but they sure look impressive. If people's heads start blowing up, it's usually a bad sign.

The Trope Namer comes from the Intentional Engrish for Funny used in the _Strong Bad Email_ episode "video games" and subsequent game _StrongBadZone_ on _Homestar Runner_, wherein the head of the person playing the game is presumed _not_ to have actually asploded, although there have been no studies done on the matter so far as we are aware.

Head asplosions are typically the result of an Explosive Leash, being shot in the head with high-powered ammunition (resulting in Pink Mist, which is Truth in Television. Water is largely incompressible, so a large caliber, high velocity bullet entering the skull would transmit that energy throughout the interior and pop! goes the cranium), interacting with a Brown Note, or absorbing too much knowledge. Often, just before it happens, the unfortunate character clutches their skull.

There's also the metaphorical (and occasionally literal for Mechanical Lifeforms) asploding that is said to occur when one's brain has gone mad from the revelation, or assaulted by a Mind Rape or Logic Bomb, or requires sufficient Brain Bleach.

For less explosive loss of heads, see Off with His Head! For head impacts that aren't as violent, see Cranial Eruption. For heads getting crushed instead of exploding, see Head Crushing.

This is a death trope, meaning there is bound to be unmarked spoilers ahead. Tread on at your own peril.

    Comedy 

-   The ending of the Cheech & Chong comedy sketch "Up His Nose" from the _Los Cochinos_ album. When the doctor looks in on a patient who constantly shoves things up his nose, including _bullets_, he tries to use pliers to remove the bullets, but eventually settles for just using a hammer, which causes the bullets to explode, presumably taking the boy's face with it. All the father could do at that point is rejoice and tell the doctor to "keep the change."
-   Discussed by George Carlin in one of his stand-up routines:
    
    "Wouldn’t it be interesting if the only way you could die was that suddenly your head blew up? If there were no other causes of death? Everyone died the same way? Sooner or later, without warning, your head simply exploded."
    

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Bloom County_, the strip when Opus lights up his first cigarette shows his head exploding, but Narrative Backpedaling ensues in the final panel:
    
    **Opus**: That actually didn't happen... but it _is_ reminiscent of the taste.
    
-   Calvin from _Calvin and Hobbes_ occasionally imagines his head exploding. In one strip, he sneezes so hard his head blows up. In another, a particularly bad mosquito itch makes him feel like his head caught on fire and exploded.
-   _Dilbert_: Scott Adams loves this trope, especially pairing this with the Cleanup in Aisle Three gag.
    -   Happens to a random Red Shirt.
        
        **Guy**: Uh-oh... suddenly this meeting and all these strange words make sense.  
        Guy's head explodes.  
        **Wally** (to Dilbert): It's your turn to buy the card.
        
    -   Has also happened before, when Dogbert rescued Dilbert from the bowels of Accounting by presenting the accounting trolls with something their brains -couldn't comprehend: wearing a cap backward on his head.
        
        **Dilbert**: What was that popping sound?  
        **Dogbert**: A paradigm shifting without a clutch.
        
-   _Doonesbury_: Duke's head has been exploding since 1985. For some reason, it kept exploding when he found out Hunter S. Thompson had died.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Batman: Assault on Arkham_: Amanda Waller assembles the Suicide Squad to infiltrate Arkham Asylum to retrieve information stolen by The Riddler. She also warns them that she had explosive implants in their heads if they desert her; KGBeast tries to leave but the implant explodes, proving her point.
-   Inverted in _Transformers: The Movie._ Unicron's head is the only part of him that _doesn't_ explode.

    Folklore 

-   Some versions of the "Pop Rocks + Soda = Death" Urban Legend describe how a victim took a swig of cola while chewing pop rocks, and died horribly from an explosion that went off in his/her mouth.
-   There's a persistent rumor of a Russian guy whose head literally exploded during a chess tournament. According to the legend, he had some type of electrical imbalance in his brain, which must have somehow boiled his cranial liquids, causing pressure to build up inside his skull, exploding his head "as if someone had put a bomb in his cranium". (In terms of "head exploding like a watermelon with a firecracker in it," that would be impossible. There is no electrical configuration possible in a brain to be able to generate enough force to rupture the skull. Aneurysms, weak areas in your brain's circulation, can rupture under increased blood pressure, which is entirely possible in a stressful situation, and this can be instantly or near instantly fatal, but nothing in your brain can blow your head up.) The story actually originates from a spoof article in the Weekly World News.

    And then my mind split open...
    
-   From "The Small(er) Song" by Carla Bozulich ( The Geraldine Fibbers / Ethyl Meatplow ):
    
    You thought you saw me in a dream  
    Inside a junkyard contraption with rocket parts.  
    I was zooming away at an alarming rate  
    In a bunch and nuts and bolts that looks like a toaster.  
    You called out to me but I could not hear you.  
    I covered my eyes from the blinding light.  
    As I disappeared behind the clouds,  
    **You thought you saw my head explode...**  
    **You're not dreaming.**
    
-   Invoked in _**extremely**_' gruesome fashion with the original cover of Big Black's _Headache_ EP. Yes, those are real police photos.
-   In the video for the Vengaboys' Rocket To Uranus, Pete Burns's character suffers from this after too much happy music.

    We talk and we talk until my head explodes...
    
-   Song by People In Planes, "If You Talk Too Much (My Head Will Explode)".

    Pinball 

-   The "Traffic Jam" Supergame mode in the _Judge Dredd_ pinball ends with one driver throwing an axe at the other, causing the victim's brains to splatter.

    Roleplay 

-   A variation happens in _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_, where Zia hits a lizard monster with a telepathic blast so strong that its brain explodes inside of its cranium. The resultant gunge shoots out of its eyes and covers Ciro, leaving everyone on the scene rather queasy.
-   _Survival of the Fittest_ is directly inspired by _Battle Royale_, and the explosive collars do make an appearance here as well. Generally, they are set off if tampered with, if a character stays in a danger zone too long, or as a warning to other characters/groups. When they do, you get this trope.

    Toys 

-   The _Zombie Roamer_ from _The Walking Dead_ Comic Book Series 1 toyline has "Head Splitting Action".

    Visual Novels

-   _School Days_: Happens in the 2nd Bad Ending of the Visual Novel when Kotonoha commits suicide by throwing herself off of the balcony of Makoto's apartment when he tells her he wants to be with Sekai rather than her, and landing headfirst into the pavement. This all happens in front of Makoto and Sekai, which is what eventually drove them apart. It's even worse when you realize that was her goal. Which is why she was smiling at the last second. Complete with High-Pressure Blood
-   In _Togainu no Chi_, Keisuke's first act with his newly enhanced strength is to hunt down Takeru - a fighter who mugged him earlier - and crush his skull with his _bare hands_.
-   In _Zero Time Dilemma_, the team that loses the first vote is executed via exploding neck collars. Unseen, but in some timelines their headless bodies are found by the other players or in one case themselves.

    Web Animation 

-   One of the listed side effects of competing in _Brawl of the Objects_ was a possible implosion of the brain. Shelly suffers from one in the finale.
-   _DEATH BATTLE!_:
    -   In "Zelda vs Peach", this is the ultimate fate of Princess Zelda, via Princess Peach kicking her in the head so hard like a soccer ball it is reduced to chunky salsa. Ouch.
    -   In "Android 18 vs Captain Marvel", a similar fate befalls Captain Marvel, who gets the back of her head caved in by 18's boot as the _coup de grace_ after getting her arms broken and punted into a crater.
    -   Inverted in "Metal Sonic vs Zero" as Metal's head is the _only_ thing that survives the explosion that tears him apart.
    -   In "Thor vs Vegeta" Vegeta dies in a unique application of the trope. After being grabbed by the face by Thor, the God of Thunder proceeds to drag the Prince towards the ground while calling Mjolnir back to him, causing Vegeta's skull to be crushed like a watermelon between Thor's hand and Mjolnir's head.
-   _The Demented Cartoon Movie_ has a parade of Blah Guys whose heads explode after they say "Blah!"
    -   Specifically, saying "Blah" in the _The Demented Cartoon Movie_ will cause you to be killed somehow, most commonly through spontaneous detonation and decapitation. There's one who has his head kicked off and several who are crushed by Mr. Weight. And a few are apparently able to say the word without consequences.
-   _Dumb Ways to Die_ recycles the old myth that you explode if exposed to space. Not that being exposed to space is a pleasant experience, but no, you don't explode.
-   In the Valentine's Smoochie (featuring Giggles) on the _Happy Tree Friends_ website, if you pick the option "Flowers", she would sniff it, and sneeze a few times before the final one blows her head off, complete with her brains sticking on the wall.
-   _FreedomToons_: Seamus is able to counter NPC zombies by shouting information that contradicts with their pre-programmed opinion at them with a megaphone, which causes their heads to pop.
-   The Cheat has a number of head-a-sploding moments in _Homestar Runner_, though they just leave him with the cartoon-explosion look. It was, in fact, Vector Strong Bad who coined the term "Your Head A Splode," as well as a few other poorly translated phrases on the subject.
    -   Strong Bad attempts to invoke this trope (this was shortly before he named it) in the email "couch patch" by typing "make homestar's head explode.exe" on the computer. Nothing happens. However, you _can_ click on the text to play an Easter Egg in which _The Cheat_'s head explodes instead.
-   In _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, one Funny Background Event has one Stormtrooper's head exploding after witnessing too much of the Warp.
-   _Object Terror_: After Cactus is released from prison in "P to the Fourth" he goes over to Coffee Cup to show him his muscles. He doesn't find them impressive, but then he starts growing _muscles on muscles_. What does this lead to? The poor teacup getting so confused that his face explodes.
-   This happens to Ness and Lucas in Smash Kingdom Melee after sampling Captain Falcon's new energy drink.
    
    **Captain Falcon:** That's right, it's got enough vitamin C and antioxidants to _blow your goddamn head off!_ FALCON PUNCH!
    
-   _Suicide Lover_ is about a man who has a bomb in his head. If he doesn't fall in love by midnight, it will blow up. He has a Meet Cute with a woman and tries to fall in love with her. _Her_ head explodes.
-   _You Wanna See My Pecker?_: Twelve dick jokes and a Unishark (Basically an excuse to give bloodthirsty sharks legs and lungs) later:
    
    **Bird:** Hey, you wanna see mah pecker again?  
    **Man:** NO!  
    **Bird:** You wanna see mah pecker?  
    **Man:** _(louder)_ NO!  
    **Bird:** Aw, come on, it'll keep your head from explodin'!  
    **Man:** Wha... _(scared)_ Are you serious?!  
    **Bird:** Yew wanna see ma peckuh?  
    _(everything above the man's jaw explodes)_  
    **Bird:** Upp! Too late! Hahahahaha! Oh boy, cartoons and the internet are WEIRD!

-   _Sword Art Online Abridged_ uses the _Scanners_ footage to depict what would happen to players who died in the game as a means of locking them in. It re-uses said footage again at the end of the Aincrad arc, but what makes it particularly disturbing is that it retcons how Recon got his; he bought it at a marked-up price from a pair of grieving parents whose kid was one of the SAO casualties, and even after cleaning the brains out he still suffers occasional fear attacks from the faulty device.
-   _Mr. Welch_ has been specifically told that he cannot make anyone's head asplode no matter how well he does on an IQ roll.

    Real Life 

-   President John F. Kennedy's infamous assassination, as seen in the Zapruder Film, was often described as being turned into a "pink mist" by commentators.
-   It should be noted though that this is not always the result of "eating a gun". For example, the infamous "Bjork Stalker", according to the FBI, had intended to cover a sign situated behind his head with blood and gore by shooting himself in the mouth, but the cartridge he used was too low powered and didn't exit his head. Nine times out of ten, most suicides that involve the use of firearms don't involve exploding heads, but that doesn't mean they aren't absolutely gruesome.
-   The _Darwin Awards_ cites a Truth in Television case in Konotop, Ukraine, in which a chemistry student who had a habit of chewing gum until the flavour ran out, then continuing to flavour it by dipping the gum in citric acid powder. He apparently dipped his gum in a similar-looking, but explosive compound in powdered form. This likely inspired a similar scene in _1000 Ways to Die_, though his jaw falls off rather than his head exploding.
-   The fate of Osama bin Laden. The Navy SEALS shot him in or just above the eye with a high-powered gun at close range, and the resulting images were not fit to show the public.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Rumors going around the Internet that a chess player's head asploded due to too much thinking (and a made up medicinal condition "Hyper-Cerebral Electrosis") are, not surprising, purely fiction.
-   One traditional, albeit uncommon means of prepping an actual human skull for anatomical display is the "exploded skull", aka Beauchêne skull. The individual bones of the face and cranium are separated from one another, then mounted on rods and wires in a configuration that mimics their relationships in life, but spaced slightly apart for easy viewing. The impression is that of a time-lapse image of a skull that's just begun to undergo this trope.
