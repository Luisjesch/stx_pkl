_"If there's a war, I'll sleep with you before you get killed..._ \[scoffs\] _that's what maidens do in books, and I'm a maiden!"_

— _**The Camomile Lawn**_

It's The End of the World as We Know It, or rather, it's going to be. The heroes are gearing up for the last battle, or just waiting for the End to come. In the meantime, there's some time to spare, some Unresolved Sexual Tension, and a Will They or Won't They? plotline that is driving everyone crazy. There's also a good chance none of them will make it through this alive. So, what now?

It's time to go down with the ship.

See Now or Never Kiss for a PG version. Can lead to an infuriatingly ambiguous Did They or Didn't They? moment.

Note that the trope _only_ applies when at least one of the participants consummating their affair before a life-threatening event is a virgin, as that gives an additional sense of urgency. For anyone else, the supertrope Pre-Climax Climax applies.

See Someone to Remember Him By for when one half of a couple dies and leaves a little something behind. Relationship Upgrade may be awkward if they weren't thinking, and both survive.

Not to be confused with Out with a Bang. Contrast Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex. Subtrope of Pre-Climax Climax. May be part of a "Too Young to Die" Lamentation.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Hilariously invoked in _YuYu Hakusho_ when Juri thinks she's going to be killed in the collapsing stadium.
    
    **Juri:** _I don't want to die as a virgin!_
    
    **Koto:** Ah! Well, Juri's just revealed a bombshell that I never would have guessed, based on her popularity in the cocktail lounge. As much as I want to stay and commentate the match, I think this cause is a bit more noble. Let's find you a man!
    
-   _Shaman King_: On the off chance that Yoh gets killed in the Shaman tournament, Anna _asks_ him to have sex with her the night before his next fight. More exactly, she asks if they can sleep in the same room that night, but the intention behind that is very obvious even if not 100% spelled out. In one of his rare serious moments, Yoh agrees. And as a result, Anna gets pregnant with their son Hana.
-   In the first volume of _Crying Freeman_, Emu Hino wants to experience her first time with Yoh Hinomura before he dispatches her and straightforwardly asks him to be her first. Luckily, Yoh (who _also_ is a virgin) finds the offer too tempting to pass up and takes her in instead.
-   _Future Diary_: Yuki and Yuno, who are both virgins before Chapter 52.
-   Thoroughly deconstructed in _Bokurano_, where Isao Kako, upon learning of his impending death via Humongous Mecha piloting, tries to lose his virginity by attempting to rape his crush and fellow pilot, Chizuru "Chizu" Honda at Dung Beetle's goading. Not only was Chizuru a rape victim _who was pregnant due to it_, but she first repels Kako's forceful attentions, then later ends up killing him. On top of that, they're both _thirteen_ at the time.
-   Yokoshima in _Ghost Sweeper Mikami_ constantly try to hug/kiss a nearby female whenever the situation turns bad, saying things to the effect of this.
-   In _3×3 Eyes_, Yakumo and Parvati have sex before she leaves for the humanization ritual.
-   Subverted in _Fushigi Yuugi_. Miaka and Tamahome decide that (just in case one of them dies in the ensuing battle with Nakago), they will consummate their relationship. However, Miaka's stomach grumbles, which ruins the mood. That, and the fact that Miaka has Virgin Power.
-   When Italy first meets Germany in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_, he pleads for his life, telling him he's still a virgin.
-   In the last episode of _Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu_, after a seemingly deadly virus spread to the school, Sōsuke drags Kaname to the infirmary and asks her to Take Off Your Clothes. Kaname reacts all flustered, saying she needs time to prepare her heart, eventually balking at the idea. But Sōsuke learned that the "virus" only attacks synthetic fibers, including clothes, and only at the temperature of body heat, so he's just asking her to undress to save her school uniform before it'd disintegrate. Meanwhile, the Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy has to constantly fend off the unwanted attentions of an aggressive female student who wants to fulfill this trope, as the only thing he's interested in doing before he dies is fighting Sōsuke.
-   In _Brynhildr in the Darkness_ this is the main motivation for Kazumi, why she develops a sexual interest in Ryouta and is sometimes very aggressive. Like all "magicians", she often has to take certain pills so that her body does not dissolve, so she must always expect to run out of pills or be killed in a fight.
    -   But at least the anime ends so that a cure is found for her and the other "magicians", and she no longer has to fear being killed at any time. But it is unlikely that this will stop her from continuing to harass Ryouta.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_. Alessandro Ricci has to tell Petrushka that she still has the cancer she had before she became a cyborg. He asks if there's anything she wants, only to have Petrushka start to say, "I want you to sleep with me." She's only sixteen so Alessandro cuts her off, saying she has to grow up a bit first. It's mentioned that she died a year later of leukemia, and it's never revealed whether they did consummate their relationship.

    Card Games 

-   Played with in the color text of the "Nymphomaniac Cheerleader" card from _Grave Robbers from Outer Space_:
    
    "Oh, no! I don't want to die a virgin!"  
    "You're a virgin?"  
    "Look, do you want to get some or not?"
    

    Comic Books 

-   Kitty Pryde tried to fulfill this trope with Colossus in _Uncanny X-Men_ #165 when it seemed like both were doomed to die from Brood infection. However, Colossus refuses because of her young age, despite her pleas.
-   Amazingly, Mystique seduced Iceman by persuading him to pretend that he was going to die the next day; in his case, this was almost true as she was wearing poisonous lipstick supplied by Mister Sinister; fortunately, Bobby didn't die and it was the start of a brief, though torrid, relationship.
-   In _Teen Titans Annual_ #1, during _Infinite Crisis_, Wonder Girl volunteers to look after Superboy as he recovers while the other Titans are called away to organize the relief effort in a decimated Blüdhaven, since her powers are slowly vanishing. Superboy awakens, and he and Wonder Girl spend time alone, reminiscing and longing for "simpler times". Thinking this may be their last night together, the two consummate their relationship in the Kent barn.
-   _The Punisher MAX_: there's an in-universe book called "Valley Forge, Valley Forge" written by the brother of a soldier who served with Frank in Vietnam. At one point, the author states that he was reasonably certain that his brother lost his virginity before he left for Vietnam. He would eventually die in battle.
-   Played with in _ElfQuest: The Rebels_. When Chandra is convinced the city they are in is doomed and there is no way they can survive, she propositions Scorch. He doesn't really get it, because he runs off before she's finished talking, because her phrasing gives him an idea of how to save the city.

    Fan Works 

-   During this chapter of the _Code Geass_ fanfic _In the End_, Lelouch has sex with C.C before he banishes her. One of the most popular tropes in _Code Geass_ fanfiction is Lelouch having sex with Suzaku or CC...or both the night before Zero Requiem.
-   In _Hellsister Trilogy_, Supergirl wonders while she's being overpowered by Satan Girl whether she'll die without ever having made love to her boyfriend.
    
    I'll die without ever once having made love to Dev, she told herself, looking at the masked woman who was about to close on her again.
    
-   Played for drama in the Kalash93 story, Welcome To The Brothel.
-   Played with in Relax, where the protagonist is not a virgin, though he's still seeing the same prostitute who took his virginity. It's more a case of _I don't want to die before I see you again._
-   In _The Second Try_, Shinji and Asuka spend together in NERV's locker room the night before their final battle against the JSSDF and SEELE's MP-EVAs. Since this story is a Peggy Sue, it's actually their _second_ first time.
-   Subverted in _In Sotto Voce_. Thinking Impa's going to die the next day, Zelda and Impa have an intimate... cuddle. They _literally_ sleep together. However, right before Impa leaves they have a Now or Never Kiss.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: The night before the final battle Jaune and Yang finally decide to consummate their relationship. Jaune's mom overhears and is very excited, which is a bit of a Moment Killer, but Yang insists they're still doing it anyway. Everyone else ends up sleeping in Ren's room, as far away from Jaune and Yang as possible.
-   _The Reaping of Hatsune Miku_: The Reaper's Game in Diola has a version perhaps best described as "Must not be erased a virgin". A Love Hotel in DIVA District will scan Player Pins and bill the Reaper Colletive for the Players' nights. We don't see it happen, but Yowane Haku explains the general attitude thusly:

    Films — Live Action 

-   Alicia Casse's boyfriend from _Independence Day_ tries to talk her into losing her virginity, seeing as the world is probably going to be destroyed by aliens. Foiled by Alicia's Big Damn Brother interrupting and taking her home. Given a slightly touching revisit in a deleted scene, where Alicia says the same thing to a boy in the underground bunker, and he replies that if they don't make it, they'll _both_ die virgins, but at least they'll die together.
-   Niida tries this in _Battle Royale_ with Chigusa. He then tries to rape her...it ends badly.
-   Played for laughs in _Zombie Strippers!_. A chaste young man and his equally virginal girlfriend are trapped in a room while zombies pound on the door outside. As it seems their deaths are imminent, he suggests they have sex. After she shoots him down, he begins to run off a list of increasingly filthy sex acts that they could perform instead. When she asks where he's even heard of this stuff, he replies "The Internet".
-   _Grease 2_: Intentionally invoked and set to music, with the song "Let's Do It For Our Country". One of the guys brings his girlfriend down to the bomb shelter, where a confederate sounds the bomb siren to make her think it's The End of the World as We Know It. Cue musical number. Unfortunately, she misses the point and thinks he's singing about joining the army, and when the siren stops, she rushes out of the shelter only to find his buddies listening at the door.
-   Parodied in _Airplane II: The Sequel_ where the supposed virgin has a long line waiting for her as she repeats this trope to every guy on the plane. For extra Rule of Funny, the line also includes a donkey—in the next scene, she and the donkey are smoking together.
-   In one of the many dramatic scenes in _The Sinking Of Japan_, the protagonist's girlfriend asks him to make love to her before they both die. The protagonist politely declines, saying that they will have their chance when they meet again in London. The protagonist is really going to perform a Heroic Sacrifice and wants to save his girl the sadness.
-   A variation in the After the End movie _Testament_, played as a pure Tear Jerker: A girl dying of radiation poisoning asks her _mother_ to describe what it's like to make love since she knows she won't live long enough to find out for herself.
-   In a very brief scene in _Evolution (2001)_, after the potential end of the world is released to the public, there's a large scale college party/protest for The End. One girl is holding up a sign which says "I can't die as a virgin".
-   _Cherry Falls_: In this Slasher Movie, the killer only targets virgins and having sex is the only thing that the teens can do to stay alive. That is, until the killer figures out the loophole, says "screw it", and just starts bumping them off indiscriminately.
-   Jay refuses to allow Bethany to renege on their agreement when things seem their bleakest near the end of _Dogma_. When she continues to hold out, his pleas for her to make good on it end up giving her the film's big "Eureka!" Moment.
-   It's hinted that this is why Tatiana asked 'Aren't You Going to Ravish Me?' to the guard that peeked in on her in _Nicholas and Alexandra_ and nearly invited him in: she's 21, pretty, no man has ever looked at her, and she's currently under house arrest as a member of the royal family with an unknown future.
-   Lampshaded in the title of the 1966 war movie _Once Before I Die_, referring to a scene where a young soldier begs Ursula Andress' character for sex so he'll have experienced it at least once in his life. She obliges, then he gets killed shortly afterwards.
-   Averted in _The Killer Elite_. Tommie casually reveals to Locken that she's a virgin. Realising where she's heading with this, Locken abruptly cuts her off. "Look, lady, I don't give a shit!"
-   Touched on in _Seeking a Friend for the End of the World_—with an asteroid expected to destroy the Earth soon, we see a bulletin board with various notices (including one providing the Title Drop). One simply reads "Fuck a Virgin" and gives a phone number.
-   _The Candy Snatchers_ contains a very dark example. When Alan is told to kill Candy, he rapes her first so she won't die a virgin.
-   Another dark example in _No Blade of Grass_. Mary asks her boyfriend to "make her a woman" as they're facing the collapse of civilization through mass famine. He refuses because she's only sixteen, and she gets raped later on in the film.

    Jokes 

-   A subversion in joke form: The captain of a cruise ship announces the ship is sinking, and there aren't enough lifeboats for everybody. One young woman stands up and starts yelling that she doesn't want to die without knowing what it's like to be a woman. Then a Tall, Dark, and Handsome man stands up as well, slowly approaches her. With everybody watching, the young girl trembling with anticipation, he rips off his shirt and throws it in her face, yelling "Here, iron this!"

    Literature 

-   In _Twilight_, Bella Swan wants to have sex with Edward Cullen before she's turned into a vampire.
-   In _Battle Royale_, Niida tries to persuade Chigusa of this. Unfortunately, he doesn't take "no" for an answer and becomes a bit more forceful...
-   In the third _Protector of the Small_, before Kel is set up to joust against Lord Wyldon, Cleon jokingly makes this offer to her. She calls his bluff but realizes that the only reason he does not want to sleep with her is that he wants to marry her in proper Noble fashion—with her as a virgin. He's trying to talk his mother around to allowing them a marriage and wants to prove that he doesn't just think of Kel as a happy fling.
-   Happens in _Good Omens_ when Newt and Anathema are caught in the big pre-Apocalypse storm. Made funnier because it was prophesied by Anathema's ancestor, Agnes Nutter, and subsequent family members had added encouraging comments and cat-calls on an index card with the prophecy. Even better, said prophecy refers to something else entirely. Agnes must have deliberately written it that way to play matchmaker.
-   In _A Darkness at Sethanon_, squires Jimmy and Locklear hook up with two girls about their age before the sack of Armengar. Both of the girls and the street-smart Jimmy are extremely casual about it, while the naive Locklear overreacts and decides he's going to marry the girl he slept with, who inevitably dies. This is in contrast to their roles in later books, where Locklear is a suave ladies' man and Jimmy is Happily Married.
-   In Michelle Magorian's _A Little Love Song_/_Not a Swan_, set in 1943, Derry convinces Rose to have sex with him before he goes to war, invoking this trope. It isn't until after he has left town that Rose finds out that Derry wasn't even allowed to join the army, and tricked her into having sex with him to boost his own ego.
-   Adrian Mole, in his first diary, commented that he hoped the bomb wouldn't be dropped before he finished his O Levels as he didn't want to die an unqualified virgin (and getting laid seemed unlikely).
-   In the first book of the _Tales of the Otori_ series, Iida Sadamu uses this as justification for attempting to rape Kaede when she resolved that she would have to commit suicide. He doesn't get far.
-   In _Gust Front_, it's lampshaded, then carried out a few chapters later, with Tom Sunday Jr and Wendy Cummings (the latter being the virgin, in this case, and not the geeky former) during the Fredericksburg engagement, after the building-sized FAE bomb is detonated and they're waiting for recovery.
-   Downplayed in _Shadow of a Dark Queen_ when Erik von Darkmoor spends his free time before his first major battle in the company of a prostitute, more out of curiosity than anything else.
-   In the short story Do Virgins Taste Better? from the anthology of the same name, the hero is selected to die precisely because he's a virgin. His attempts to lose his virginity are thwarted and he does die, sadly, a virgin.
-   _The Shadowhunter Chronicles_:
    -   In _The Mortal Instruments_, Jace and Clary have sex before they attack the castle, which is ruled by Clary's evil brother. At least Clary is still a virgin at this point, Jace most likely not, but that's never really made clear.
    -   In _The Clockwork Princess_, Will and Tessa have sex when they are trapped together in a prison cell and believe the Magister is in all likelihood going to kill or enslave them the next day.
    -   In _Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy_, Simon and Isabelle have sex, and Simon loses his virginity. The next day he is to become a shadowhunter, but the chalice of the angels is very picky. While vampires and werewolves can turn ordinary humans into creatures like them with little effort, on average the angelic goblet kills four out of five humans, turning only the fifth human into a shadowhunter. For this reason, Simon really has to fear that he could be killed ... but it works out well for him.
-   In _Eyes of the Calculor_ a fifteen-year-old youth is going off to fight a duel against a more experienced opponent. He intends to stop off a brothel first because dueling as a virgin is regarded as bad luck, but his 22-year old maid seduces him, figuring she'd be a better inspiration to live than some anonymous whore.
-   For most of _Ravelling Wrath_, Rinn would've been happy to have sex with Yali, while Yali held back because of her past trauma. But in chapter 16, it's _Yali_ who initiates this trope, and _Rinn_ who stops her because Rinn can tell something's wrong.
    
    **Yali:** I – I – I don’t want to die! I don’t want to die before I ever have sex consensually!
    
    **Rinn:** Yali, I don’t understand! I mean, don’t get me wrong, this is fuckin’ hot, but, I thought, you always said –
    
-   _InCryptid_: In "And Sweep Up the Wood", when Alice thinks she's going to die facing a swarm of Apraxis wasps alone, she goes to see Thomas one last time, and they finally kiss and have Their First Time.

    Live Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Parodied in Xander's dream in "Dirty Girls":
        
        **Girl 1:** I've never been with a man. I could die tomorrow, and I've never been with a man.  
        **Xander:** Well, uh?  
        **Girl 2:** I've never been with a man before either.  
        **Xander:** Colleen...  
        **Girl 2:** I've never been with her in front of a man before.  
        **Girl 1:** I've never been with her in front of a man, either.  
        **Xander:** Um...  
        **Girl 1:** Xander...  
        **Girl 2:** We're so scared.  
        **Rona:** Xander! Xander! Goddamnit!  
        **Xander:** _(wakes up)_ What's going on? I was sleeping.  
        **Rona:** Dominique has the stomach flu, and the toilet bowl is backed up.
        
    -   Not played for laughs on Buffy's 17th birthday in "Surprise". She and Angel barely survive an encounter with an apocalyptic demon, so they decide to consummate their love, destroying Angel's soul and creating the _real_ Big Bad.
    -   Willow loses her virginity to Oz the night before the Mayor is scheduled to ascend to true demonhood and try to kill them all in "Graduation Day Part 1".
-   _Angel_. Implied with Connor and Cordelia in "Apocalypse Nowish" as the sky turns dark and rains fire down upon Los Angeles.
    
    **Cordelia:** You've never had anything that's real... And if this is the end, I want you to have something that is.
    
-   _Supernatural_: Just before an encounter with an archangel that the characters believe will prove fatal, Dean, on hearing that Castiel "never had occasion" to lose his virginity, attempts to set him up with a hooker (called Chastity, no less). Hilarity Ensues when Chastity throws him out of her room while screaming abuse.
    
    **Dean:** What did you do!?  
    **Castiel:** Nothing. I just looked deep into her eyes and told her that her father, Stan, didn't leave because he didn't love her. He just hated his job at the post office.
    
-   In the Australian mini-series _1915_, the two couples consummate their relationships before the boys ship off to World War I. One of the girls becomes pregnant.

-   _No Ordinary Family_: Referenced for laughs in the first episode; on a plane experiencing engine failures during a storm, the teenage daughter of the family wails that she's going to die, "and I haven't even done it yet!" With both her parents in earshot. They look... unsure how to respond to or feel about this.
-   The remake of the TV Movie _The Initiation of Sarah_ does this, but interestingly it's actually tied to the plot. Right before the Good Sorority goes to try and stop the Evil Sorority, Sarah goes to \*ahem\* "be with" her boyfriend. However, it was earlier established that the Evil Sorority was a group of witches who were sacrificing virgins to prep for a ceremony, so Sarah was trying to take her boyfriend off the menu.
-   The _Clueless_ Halloween special is a parody of _Scream,_ with the cast being apparently killed off one by one in a haunted house. When Dionne and Murray, the last ones left (surprisingly), are being trapped by the killer, Murray tries to instigate this. Dionne cuts him down, pointing out that the virgin always survives in horror movies.
-   The _M\*A\*S\*H_ episode "The Army-Navy Game" has the 4077th threatened by heavy shelling and an unexploded bomb in the compound. Radar, of all people, manages to cajole a nurse into joining him in the supply tent.
-   One episode of _Scrubs_ has Elliot and Carla attempting to find a male prostitute for a dying patient with this attitude. They end up getting arrested, while the patient does the deed with Ted.
-   On _The Bold and the Beautiful_, Taylor and James were trapped together during the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake. Believing they were going to die, James took the opportunity to declare his love for Taylor (he'd kept his feelings hidden out of respect for her marriage) and beg her to deflower him. She complied.
-   _The X-Files_. A satanic cult is supposedly killing virgins, so the real culprits (two teenage girls) lure a boy to becoming their next victim by asking him to take their virginity.
-   In the _Game of Thrones_ episode "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms", everyone is facing almost certain death in the upcoming battle with the Army of the Dead. Arya Stark interrogates Gendry as to his prior experience with women, then says she "wants to find out what it's like" and sleeps with him.
-   In _Grey's Anatomy_'s Season 4 finale, a boyfriend-girlfriend pair of brain cancer patients enlist Meredith and Derek to stand guard as they invoke this.

He dies, while she becomes the first to survive the procedure.
-   _My Left Nut_: Shy Mick gets a surge of courage in his relationship with Rachael when he believes he has cancer, and decides to push to have sex with her so he won't die a virgin.
    
    **Mick:** Fuck it. Everyone dies. They just don’t think about it. So I'll just put it out of my mind. This is gonna be a big night. My last party with the lads. My last chance to get with Rachael. I’m not gonna die a virgin. Giant ball or no giant ball.
    
-   On _One Day at a Time (1975)_ a group are trapped in a closet by a psycho burglar who they think is going to kill them; teen-age Barbara berates her mother for telling her to wait and preserve her virginity. Her boyfriend offers to relieve the situation; mother Ann is not pleased.
-   _Intergalactic_: Genevieve says this as she's propositioning Drew. She doesn't want to die a virgin, as she and everyone else among the main cast are constantly put in danger.
-   _Yellowjackets_: Jackie still hasn't lost her virginity (in the sense of sexual intercourse at least) and is insistent that she won't die as a virgin, convincing Travis to sleep with her.

    Music 

-   If you listen to the lyrics of Romanthony's unplugged version of Daft Punk's "One More Time," (from the Daft Club remix album), you realize that what was originally just a silly dance refrain ("one more time") is actually a plea from the singer to invoke this trope before machines take over.
-   Lenka's "The End of the World" is possibly either this or a metaphor.
-   The Divine Comedy's "To Die A Virgin". It even opens with a sound clip of the above page quote.

    Poetry 

-   In Andrew Marvell's Seduction Lyric poem, "To His Coy Mistress," he basically tells the woman in verse that life's too short to be shy, and that if she dies a virgin "then worms shall try/ That long preserv'd virginity."
-   A. D. Hope, in his poem "His Coy Mistress to Mr. Marvell," serves him a blistering (and hilarious) retort:
    
    Shall I be moved to love you, pray,
    
    By hints that I must soon decay?
    
    No woman's won by being told
    
    How quickly she is growing old\[...\]
    
    But — well I ask: to draw attention
    
    To worms in — what I blush to mention,
    
    And prate of dust upon it too!
    
    Sir, was this any way to woo?
    

    Video Games 

-   In _Mass Effect_ and _2_, the protagonist and his/her love interest have a chance to consummate their relation before the game's final mission. Most of the options definitely aren't or probably aren't virgins, the exceptions being Tali and Liara. Tali because her race's unique answer to the immune system leaves a very high chance that she'd be allergic to any potential partners, even of her own species, while Liara explicitly mentions that she's never been in a romantic relationship.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, if the female Warden is romancing Alistair (who reveals himself to be a virgin after getting to a "good friends" sort of stage) and doesn't proposition him herself, once it's been going on for a while, he'll eventually approach her, saying that seeing as they face danger day-to-day, he wants to take advantage of having the chance and "say I threw caution to the wind just this once".
    -   In _Dragon Age II_, this is Upper-Class Twit Emile de Launcet's motivation for running away from the admittedly draconian Kirkwall Circle of Magi: he had never got drunk in a tavern or kissed a girl. This wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't telling everyone he runs into that he's a blood mage in order to make himself seem more alluring to women.
    -   In _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, when the party is working to save the region of Crestwood from being destroyed by animated undead, they come across a pair of amorous teenagers hiding in the abandoned pub on the dam. Given the dangers they must have encountered just to reach the place, one can only assume that this is at least part of their motivation.
-   Occurs in _Final Fantasy VII_ between Cloud and Tifa on the night before the party enters the Very Definitely Final Dungeon.
-   In _Saints Row IV_, The Boss can offer to have sex with Matt Miller so that he doesn't die a virgin.
-   In _YU-NO_, Takahashi Couple Takuya and Mio get trapped in a cave. After hours of fruitless searching for a way out, Mio loses hope and offers her virginity to Takuya, who reluctantly complies.

    Web Animation 

-   One of the non-canon endings to _Red vs. Blue_'s fifth season has Tucker try this on Sister, who's more than eager to get to it. Until Grif kills Tucker. Later, Tucker tells Grif in Revelations that "I fucked your sister." Normally, one would take this as an empty taunt, but this is Sister we're talking about...

    Webcomics 

-   In _Sluggy Freelance_, Lord Grater stops himself and Princess-Princess from escaping a Universe Shattering Kaboom in order to invoke this trope.
    
    **Lord Grater:** You said you'd give me a kiss if I was the last man in the universe, and I am!  
    **Princess-Princess:** _I said I **wouldn't** kiss you even **if** you were the last man in the universe!!!_  
    **Lord Grater:** Oh. Never mind.
    
-   In a _Cyanide and Happiness_ strip:
    
    **Man:** Baby... you don't want to die a virgin, do you?
    
    **Woman:** Um... That line only works if I'm about to die.
    
    **Man:** Hmmm... good point. _(pulls a gun on her)_ Baby... you don't want to die a virgin, do you?
    
-   Played for Laughs in _El Goonish Shive_ during the goo panic scene. The background screams call attention to this trope.
-   _Girls with Slingshots_ offers a Jamie’s kitty, supposedly a reincarnation of an infantryman who died a virgin.

    Web Original 

-   Discussed as possibly the best end-case scenario in the event of apocalypse via meteor in Cracked's After Hours

They force Billy to volunteer where he reveals he's a virgin and doesn't want to die one. The others see that as a perfect reason why.
    
    **Dr. Venture:** Billy, that makes you the best candidate to take a ray blast. You have nothing to lose. You've never done anything. The way I look at it, it's not even murder. It's a very late abortion.
