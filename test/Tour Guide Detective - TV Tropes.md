_"When someone is killed, for a short time people have to answer questions. An investigator has permission to go to different levels and see how the world is built. A murder is a little like a house splitting in half; you see what floor is above what floor and what door leads to another door."_

— **Arkady Renko**, _Red Square_

A detective story can be a good way to give an audience insights into a society that is vastly different from the one they are currently living in. This society can be real or fictional, so the detective can be doing detective work anywhere and anytime from the Brezhnev-era Soviet Union to a victorious Nazi Germany in the 1960s. The detective can either be from the location being depicted, or the detective can be a Strange Cop in a Strange Land who learns about the setting along with the audience.

A good reason for making a detective the character who lets the audience explore this kind of setting is that while the detective is often exposed to the failings and dysfunctional aspects of this society, the detective is not from this stratum and can often access locations and information that an ordinary citizen cannot. The detective's work also often takes him or her across class rankings and the various groupings within the social strata; from the prostitutes, drug-pushers and thugs of the underworld to the glittering echelons of high society where the white-collar criminals might hide, from the corridors of power where their superiors in government and politics might be operating to the streets where the lower-level functionaries have to work, and more besides.

In order to qualify for this trope, the setting must be significantly different from the initial intended audience. Works that were set in the present day when they were written and/or set in a location that would have been familiar to the original intended audience, but which have today become snapshots of a bygone era or those which have been exported to locations other than where they were originally made (such as _Sherlock Holmes_ or _High&Low_) _do not_ count as this trope; however, a work written in the present day but set in the Victorian Era or a work taking place in Japan but written for an American audience _would_ count as this trope.

Historical Detective Fiction is a related trope, but a Tour Guide Detective story could just as well take place in the present day, in the future, or even in an alternate history setting or on another planet. May result in Minor Crime Reveals Major Plot.
