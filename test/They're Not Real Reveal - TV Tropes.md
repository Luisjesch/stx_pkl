Oo wa wa? Hey, where'd he go!? Did he disappear? Or was he never there to begin with?

In most stories, there is a main character. You follow them through the plot. Through the course of the story the protagonist meets side characters. They can be friends, family, or even enemies. Either way, they are living, breathing characters in the medium. The Not-Real Reveal is a narrative trope that plays with the audience's understanding of reality within a story. It typically unfolds in several stages:

1.  **Introduction of the Character**: At the beginning of the narrative, a character is introduced who seems entirely real, with a distinct personality, backstory, and interactions with other characters.
2.  **Integration into the Story**: This character becomes an integral part of the plot, often influencing the actions and decisions of other characters. They may even have their own story arc or subplots.
3.  **Subtle Clues and Hints**: As the story progresses, subtle hints and inconsistencies may emerge. These can include discrepancies in the character's backstory, unusual reactions from other characters, or surreal occurrences related to this character.
4.  **Building Suspense**: The narrative builds suspense as these hints grow stronger, causing the audience to question the character's authenticity. Viewers or readers might engage in discussions and theories about the character's true nature.
5.  **The Revelatory Moment**: The climax of the trope occurs when it's revealed that the character was never real. This revelation can take various forms, such as the character fading away, being exposed as a hallucination, or simply being acknowledged as a creation of another character's mind.
6.  **Impact and Reflection**: The Not-Real Reveal often has a profound impact on the story's themes and characters. It may be used to explore psychological or emotional aspects of the character who imagined the non-existent character, shedding light on their inner struggles or desires. Additionally, it challenges the audience's perception of reality within the narrative.

This trope can be employed in different genres, including psychological thrillers, mysteries, and even fantasy, to create an engaging and thought-provoking narrative twist. It invites the audience to question the boundaries of reality and imagination, making it a compelling storytelling device.

Compare Noticing the Fourth Wall, where characters realize they aren't real in a _different_ sense. Also "Scooby-Doo" Hoax and Scary Shadow Fakeout.

Contrast Real After All (which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin). Related to Dead All Along (which is because the not-real character in question _used to be real_ and is dead at the time of the reveal). Not-So-Imaginary Friend is a character you thought wasn't real but was real all along. If a character finds this out about themselves, it may very well be a Tomato in the Mirror. May be part of a larger reveal that It Was All In Le Head.

    -   John's college roommate Charles, who's there despite John having been assigned to a one-man dorm room. He's the first character to be revealed to the audience as nonexistent, when John talks to Charles and a psychiatrist notices that there's nobody else in the room. It takes far longer for John to recognize the delusion, though, resulting in his infant son almost drowning in the bath because he thinks that Charles is watching the baby.
    -   Charles has a niece named Marcie, whom John realizes isn't real when he recognizes that she hasn't actually grown up all the times he's seen her. There are additional hints through the film as well, such as when she runs through a flock of pigeons that don't react to her.

Their entire relationship was just a figment of Arthur's increasingly frazzled imagination.
-   Inverted in _Cloak and Dagger_. Jack Flack, a role-playing character and imaginary friend of the Kid Hero, is presented as such from the very beginning.

Curiously, it somehow works: the bad guy's attention and gunfire are diverted, and Jack Flack later "dies" from gunshot wounds. It is never fully explained how or why Jack Flack was able to manifest himself into the real world, if only briefly (he disappears again after "dying" but then has some final words for our hero afterward).

Through her radio, the skywatcher, "Mets Fan", helps her stay focused and guides her through several dangerous situations. She is ultimately led to a helicopter pick-up, at which point the skywatcher goes silent. At the end of her story, it's _heavily_ implied that the skywatcher was created by her subconscious; there never was a skywatcher named Mets Fan, the radio was damaged in the crash and could not have received a signal, and Mets Fan only provided information the pilot had already received in her pre-flight briefing.
