The Turncoat is the guy who switches sides at some point to help out the other side. Can be a hero who turns bad, or a bad guy who suddenly decides to help the good guys, but usually it's just anyone who thinks that the switch will benefit them personally.

If they're discovered to have been on the "other" side the whole time, they're The Mole. If they're faking their switch, they're a Fake Defector. If they switch back and forth, they're going through the Heel–Face Revolving Door.

There are several possible motivations. Someone who decides that their side is corrupt or otherwise unworthy may become a Defector from Decadence; someone who simply wants to end up on the winning team may decide that I Fight for the Strongest Side!.

It's interesting to note the origins of the phrase "turn coat". Back in the day (we're talking horse and musket age) soldiers defecting to the other side would turn their coats around so the liner would face the outside, to indicate they were not a soldier of the enemy. Of course, one only did this when you were far enough away from your own lines, lest you fall victim to Friendly Fire for treason.

Turncoat has almost _universally_ negative connotations: calling someone a turncoat is roughly equivalent to calling them a traitor, scoundrel, self-serving jerk, or other bad names. It's rare to find someone called a turncoat with _good_ implications, though the trope can refer to bad guys becoming good guys just as often as the opposite.

Compare Opportunistic Bastard, Wild Card, Dirty Coward and Chronic Backstabbing Disorder. Not to be confused with _The Dresden Files_ novel _Turn Coat_.

-   _Beyblade_: Kai Hiwatari switches sides _six times_. First, he's part of the antagonistic Blade Sharks. Then he joins the Bladebreakers (first switch). Then he switches sides and joins the Demolition Boys (a Face–Heel Turn, and switch #2). Then he switches sides _again_ and rejoins the Bladebreakers (three). He stays with them until he goes over to the Blitzkrieg Boys (the Demolition Boys renamed, and switch number four). His next move is to join the bad guys of season three, BEGA (five). Of course, he realizes the error of his ways and switches back again (six).

    Comic Books 

-   In _All Fall Down_, Pronto becomes this in exchange for a new pair of legs.
-   Played for laughs in _Giraffes On Horseback Salad_ when Chico Marx gets himself hired as Linda's prosecuting attorney in the trial against the Woman Surreal. Given that this is Chico here, it's not particularly effective.

    Fan Works 

-   The 4th _Touhou M-1 Grand Prix_ had Utsuho, Orin, Satori & Koishi swap partners.
-   _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_: Quirrell's school armies start allowing these a few games in. The idea of being a spy is sufficiently appealing that it _very_ quickly devolves into absolute chaos, and the armies turn into three flocks of wolves — Draco and Hermione struggle to keep their armies in line, while Harry thrives. This turns out to be Quirrell's setup for a _very_ poor message of "fascism is good, actually". Of course, he is Voldemort, so we're not actually meant to _agree_ with him.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Little Giants_: Spike Hammersmith when he leaves the Little Giants and plays for the Cowboys after initially joining the Giants because Danny fibbed and said he was Kevin. Considering how he was tricked into joining the Little Giants in the first place, can anyone really hold it against Spike?
-   Richard Cameron from _Dead Poets Society_, who is worried about getting caught in the Society's off-campus secret parties, and informs Dean Nolan of the Society's activities after Neil's suicide, resulting in Keating's forced resignation from the Welton teaching staff.
-   Melchior in _Sodom and Gomorrah_ is already a self-serving schemer before he and his fellow Hebrews reach the title cities, but he completely turns traitor after first directing Prince Astaroth in his aggressive pursuit of Lot's daughter Shuah, then willingly joins the Sodomites and passes on intel about the Hebrews' defences against a possible attack by the Elamites (who are in league with Astaroth). The Hebrew elders are incensed to discover he has turned traitor and declare that he is dead to them.

    Literature 

-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_ is filled with these. Particularly sellswords, who will abandon battle and even turn _against_ those who hired them and join the enemy if the tide is against them.
    -   Theon Greyjoy is dubbed Theon Turncloak by the Northeners after he rejoins his family and betrays Robb.
    -   On Robb's side is also Lord Roose Bolton and Lord Walder Frey. They betray the Starks at the Red Wedding, when in a shocking violation of guest right the Freys kill his mother and most of his army, Roose personally murdering Robb.
    -   Because rule of the Stormlands is contested early on by three different members of House Baratheon, it becomes something of a Running Gag for any given Stormlord to rapidly change sides due to changing circumstances. Given the cynicism of the series, those that do _not_ switch sides end up suffering for not being able to adapt.
    -   The Second Sons once sworn themselves to Daenerys, then they switched sides with Yunkai when they lay siege to Meereen. Then its revealed they were playing Fake Defector, and were really on Daenerys side all along.
    -   "The Princess and the Queen", an in-universe history about a civil war between two branches of the Targaryen dynasty (the Greens and the Blacks), has Hugh Hammer and Ulf the White. They are dragonseeds (illegitimate descendants of those with Valyrian blood), who are recruited to become dragonriders by the Black claimant, Rhaenyra. However they betray her army at Tumbleton, joining the Greens for unknown reasons. Later they prove treacherous to the Greens, planning to seize power themselves. This leads to the Greens murdering them.
-   _Harry Potter_: Peter Pettigrew, who sold out two of his best friends, Lily and James Potter, to Voldemort, and then framed a third friend, Sirius Black, for the whole thing. He considered turning back (just a little bit!) after Harry Potter saved his life, but the mere thought of betraying Voldemort caused his magical prosthetic arm to strangle him.
-   Esmer in _The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant_ is chronically unable to choose a side, to the annoyance of everyone involved. He has the rare distinction of being able to switch sides several times a day and the personal power to pull it off.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: In Ben Counter's _Horus Heresy_ novel _Galaxy In Flames_, Lucius motivated by envy of how Tarvitz took command, betrays the last survivors of Horus's treacherous attack.
-   _John Carter of Mars_: In _Chessmen of Mars_, the ancient I-Gos is perpetually praising his days. So thorough is his admiration that he changes his loyalties on realizing who is The Hero.
    
    _Then I did not fully realize the cowardice of my jeddak, or the bravery of you and the girl. I am an old man from another age and I love courage. At first I resented the girl's attack upon me, but later I came to see the bravery of it and it won my admiration, as have all her acts. She feared not O-tar, she feared not me, she feared not all the warriors of Manator. And you! Blood of a million sires! how you fight! I am sorry that I exposed you at The Fields of Jetan. I am sorry that I dragged the girl Tara back to O-Tar. I would make amends. I would be your friend. Here is my sword at your feet._
    
-   In _Discworld_, Nobby Nobbs is famous in times of war for exactly this. He hovers around the edge of the battlefield, swiping boots off the fallen soldiers and will just move in with whoever he thinks is winning. The generals used his uniform as an indicator to tell who was winning.
-   In Mercedes Lackey's _The Black Gryphon_, two of Urtho's generals seem to be carrying the Idiot Ball for most of the book; they're constantly losing troops of all species by attempting flashy, dangerous tactics which would lead to glorious victories, if only they actually worked; it later comes to light that these losses are intentional, as they have been working for the enemy for some time.
-   _Conan the Barbarian_:
    -   In _Rogues in the House_, Conan's Back Story includes being betrayed by a woman. After he's out of prison, he tracks her down and (since she is a woman) abducts her to drop her in a cesspit.
    -   In _The Hour of the Dragon_, Publio turns on Conan because Conan's presence might reveal that his wealth springs from dealing with Conan when he was a corsair.
    -   In "The Scarlet Citadel" Amalrus, who lured Conan into an inverted Cavalry Betrayal.
-   Happens in John le Carré, along with moles, with regularity, since that's the whole point of having agents and double agents. As one character put it:
    
    _Don't feel too bad. Christ himself only had twelve, and one of them was turned._
    
-   In _Harald_, the leader of King James's secret police betrays him when James makes a Heel–Face Turn.
-   _Malazan Book of the Fallen_: Not that Kallor made the most trustworthy impression beforehand, but his betrayal still comes as a bit of a shock to his superiors. Nobody thought that he would willingly join the Crippled God just to get a shot at Silverfox.
-   _The Dresden Files_ novel _Turncoat_. However, the true traitor isn't exposed until the end.
-   _Victoria_: Though Lieutenant-Governor Asa Bowen was loyal to Governor Adams personally during the civil war, he comes to disagree with the newly independent Confederation's politics, as well as the growing power of the military clique around Chief of Staff John Rumford and shadowy elder statesman William Kraft. Eventually, under the influence of his mistress, he joins the mutinous "Deep Green" faction and leads a coup attempt against the constitutional government.
-   _The Lord of Bembibre_: In the former Castilian civil war, the Count of Lemos betrayed the Queen María to join the Infante Don Juan when he realized what side was clearly going to lose.
-   _The Black Arrow_: Sir Daniel Brackley constantly changed sides during the Wars of the Roses, profiting every side. During the Battle of Risingham, he is insistently asked by his Lancastrian "allies" to join the battle, but he tries and stalls for time until it is clear who is winning, and he nearly changes sides when it looks like the House of York is crushing them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Faith (Face-Heel, then Heel-Face) and Spike (Heel-Face, then Face-Heel, then _back_ Heel-Face). Not to mention Angel (Heel-Face when he got a soul, Face-Heel when he lost it, etc. ad nauseum). Also Andrew (Heel-Face) and Anya (Heel-Face, brief Face-Heel, then back to Heel-Face).
-   _The X-Files_: AD Walter Skinner started a bit shady and it looked like he was working with the Cancer Man. He turned out to be one of the few good guys at the FBI and trusted ally for Mulder and Scully. Episode "S.R. 819" paints him as a turncoat who seeks benefits for himself. He has a touching scene in hospital where he tells Scully he wishes to be helpful. Yet at the end of the episode, he refuses to support Mulder and Scully's quest.
    
    **Skinner:** I always played it safe. I wouldn't take sides. Wouldn't let you and Mulder... pull me in.  
    **Scully:** You've been our ally more times than I can say.  
    **Skinner:** Not the kind of ally that I could have been.  
    _\[several scenes later\]_  
    **Skinner:** So you still think this is about you? About the X-Files?  
    **Mulder:** Yes. Yes, I do. And I have an idea who may be behind all this. But I'd need your authority to continue the investigation.  
    **Skinner:** I have neither the authority nor the will to allow your continued inquiry into this matter. You'll perform your duties as directed by AD Kersh and only AD Kersh.  
    _\[Mulder and Scully stare at Skinner in surprise\]_  
    **Scully:** Sir?  
    **Skinner:** This matter's closed, Agents. Am I clear?
    
-   _Lost_:
    -   Juliet turned good while Michael turned bad and then good again.
    -   Ben often is in a Heel–Face Revolving Door, depending on who's side he's on at that moment and what his present goal is. He undergoes a final Heel–Face Turn in the final episode, after Hurley offers him a second chance at redemption, as his Number Two while he settles into the role as new protector of the Island.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_: In the final episode, the Cardassian ships turn on their Dominion allies and aid the Federation Alliance fleet. Though the fact that one of their major cities on their homeworld had been wiped from the face of the planet might have had something to do with it. Gul Dukat fits this trope alone, when he realizes that the military is going to be overthrown he switches to back the civilians ("Way of the Warrior")

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Bible_: In 2nd Samuel, Ishbosheth's military captain Abner, who supported him when he became king of most of Israel after his father King Saul had died, decided to defect and turn over the entire kingdom to its rightful God-anointed ruler David (who ruled over Judah at the time) when Ishbosheth accused him of sleeping with his father's concubine and Abner took offense to that.

    Video Games 

-   _Final Fantasy II_: Count Borghen betrayed Fynn to the Empire, becoming a general and leading to the assault that starts off the game.
-   _Final Fantasy IV_: Kain Highwind switches sides _four times_ throughout the course of the game. He was under More than Mind Control from about one hour into the game to about one hour until the end of the game. Golbez just liked to screw with the heroes by slackening his control on Kain.
-   _Final Fantasy VII_: Reeve Tuesti, controlling Cait Sith is The Mole for the bad guys at first, but quickly swaps sides wholeheartedly once he's found out, even taking a risk for the party through sacrificing one of his puppets for their cause.
-   _Tales of Symphonia_: Yuan switches from allying with the heroes to trying to kill them so often even the other characters comment on how hard it is to keep track. It makes sense, as he's a double agent within the villains' organization, and leads his own organization opposing the villains that is easily confused with said villains. So he never really switches sides, just motives. Pretty much half of the cast betrays Lloyd at one point or another. Which makes you wonder just how naive he is.
-   _Heroes of Might and Magic_:
    -   Any troops you build up in a city but haven't purchased yet can be bought up by anyone who takes the city from you. Those Archangels you've been saving your gems for can become reinforcements for your enemies' armies.
    -   Heroes who have been defeated in battle (i.e., haven't fled or surrendered) return to the pool of heroes that anyone, including your enemies, can recruit from, with all their levels and artifacts. The same happens if they _do_ flee or surrender, and you don't re-hire them by the end of the week.
-   Played for laugh in _Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory_. When Nepgear is tricked to switch side to Vert, a notification told everyone that "Nepgear gained Turncoat affinity!"
-   Zevran from _Dragon Age: Origins_ may join your party after you foil his attempt to assassinate you for Loghain. If he does, depending on his Relationship Values, he might later turn around and rejoin the enemy.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   Many recruitable characters start out on the enemy side, but can either be persuaded to join by your Lord character persuading them that their cause is wrong, your Lord character giving them a fat sack of cash, or a friend/relative/lover asking them to switch sides. Some examples include Beowulf from _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_, who will turn against his employers if someone carrying 10,000 gold talks to him, and Tharja from _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, a Plegian Dark Mage who finds herself disillusioned with her home nation and can join up with the Shepherds if Chrom talks to her.
    -   Treason in the heroes' home country or allies is also common. _Binding Blade_ is particularly rife with this. Several lords in the so-called Lycian League throw in with Bern when it invades. A huge chunk of Ostia's army also betrays their land after Marquess Hector is killed and plot to kill his daughter Lilina. (They fail.)
    -   The morality of defecting to the player's side is a matter of some weight. Unsympathetic enemies tend to be contemptuous of their former allies as having been useless all along, while more sympathetic antagonists tend to be outraged at their friends' lack of loyalty to their country.
        
        **Eagler:** _"I name you traitors all! Draw your blade! Do your worst!"_
        
-   _Phantom Doctrine_ includes this as a gameplay mechanic: if you capture an enemy agent and have the appropriate technology, you can make them into a sleeper agent and release them to work for you at certain times and in certain ways. Of course, you have to be careful, because the same can happen to _your_ agents (unless they have the perk "Loyal", which prevents any brainwashing). In the CIA storyline, Fender is considered a Turncoat, to the point of the Cabal using that as his codename after he betrays them, but it's clear to the player early on that he's been brainwashed against his will: the key in the game is to find out how, and more importantly, _why_.
-   _Grid Legends_: Lara acts as this for Seneca right before the final race, she does so to expose the McKanes for illegally modifying their cars to keep Nathan as Ravenwest's top driver.
    
    **Marcus:** You have a great driver; you're just holding her back because she's not named McKane.  
    **Ryan:** _(turns his attention to Lara)_ Is this your doing? You just ended your career, I hope you know that.  
    **Lara:** Que saber? Eu terminei com isso!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  I quit!

-   In Shōgi, captured pieces change sides.

    Webcomics 

-   Played with in regard to the vampire Durkon in _The Order of the Stick_. When he's first turned, he is a thrall to Malack, the vampire who created him, and is forced to fight against his former allies. After his creator's destruction restores his free will, he immediately joins back up with his friends. Except it's a ruse— a vampire in the OotS-verse isn't the same person they were when alive, but a malevolent spirit masquerading as them, with the original personality a helpless witness. Durkon's vampiric spirit is actually the High Priest of Hel, and while the audience is shown this almost immediately, it takes a while for the rest of the characters to catch on.
-   _Tower of God_: Rapdevil switches sides from Prince's team to Kim Lurker's defectors.
