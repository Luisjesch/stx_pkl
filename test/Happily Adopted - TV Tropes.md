**Spyro:** So... you mean I— I'm not your real son?  
**Nina:** You _are_ our real son. It's just that you came from somewhere else.

Once upon a time, being an adoptee was a raw deal. Either your adoptive or foster parents were Muggles—caring, but utterly, utterly clueless—or they were downright abusive, presumably because you weren't their "blood." If it wasn't adoptive parents, it was step-parents. Either you went Gene Hunting, found your REAL parents, and were loved for the rest of your life, or you moved out, lived on your own, and promptly forgot about them. Even if your adoptive parents were fairly harmless, if you ever found your _real_ family, you forgot all about the people who raised you. Blood's thicker and all that, right?

Or so it used to be.

Because there are some problems in implying that adoptive parents are either bad (in the Abusive Parents variety) or unnecessary/useless (the Gene Hunting variant), many adoptees have a better deal. They're adopted. They know they're adopted — if not right off the bat, then it gets revealed to them that they are. Their reaction is... not to care. Oh, sure — maybe they care at first. Maybe they spend some time wondering about their birth parents, their origins, and where they _really_ come from, but after some thought, they come to one conclusion: No matter who they were born to, they know who cared for them when they were sick, who helped them when they were down, and, most importantly, who loved them. When love's in play, the truth becomes obvious: Those who love them are their _real_ family, blood be damned. Usually, the kid will eventually tell the parent that, throw in a hug and Heartwarming Moments are made as their bond grows stronger.

What happens in cases where the child in question is a Wonder Child, and has celestial or other fantastic parentage? While in older works, the Muggle Foster Parents would frequently be forgotten about, in this trope, the child tends to accept both sets of "parents" as being real. If the child is a Heartwarming Orphan whose "original" parents died, the same thing may also apply. Thus, this has often become a component of the modern Happily Ever After: What will happen to the orphan child protagonist? He/she gets adopted by the adult good guys! Everybody is happy!

As one might expect this trope can overlap heavily with Like a Son to Me. It's not uncommon for the former to lead into the latter as a surrogate child is officially adopted.

Truth in Television (thankfully), but No Real Life Examples, Please!.

Can be an application of Nurture over Nature.

The counterpart trope to Adoption Is Not an Option and Adoption Angst.

Kids Raised by Wolves are often happy adoptees. If the adopted parents aren't even the same species as the adoptee, see Interspecies Adoption. Compare with Babies Ever After. Contrast Raised by Orcs and First Father Wins. See True Companions, which is closely related (by adoption, of course). An Adoption Diss might be used against these characters for Kick the Dog purposes if it's clear to the audience that this trope applies. Also see Orphan's Ordeal for the flipside of the coin.

    Films - Animated 

-   _Ark_: Amarinth is a member of the Cevean alien species, her race losing the war against the technologically-superior Storrians, and her father being the Storrian commander Jallek who killed two of his men when they tried to massacre a Cevean birthing pod full of children. The then-infant Amarinth unexpectedly awakens, at which point Commander Jallek decides to take her as his adopted daughter, which Amarinth is well aware of most of her life.
-   In _101 Dalmatians_, Pongo and Perdita end up adopting the 84 orphaned puppies that they helped rescue. Fortunately, their pet humans agree, and the film ends with Roger saying they'll buy a large place in the country so the dogs will have plenty of room.
-   In _All Dogs Go to Heaven_, Anne-Marie and Itchy get adopted by a loving couple in the end.
-   Hiro and Tadashi in _Big Hero 6_ were adopted by their Aunt Cass after their parents died when Hiro was three. It's clear that they adore Aunt Cass and consider her to be their mom.
-   _Arlo the Alligator Boy_ was adopted by swamp hermit Edmée of a Louisiana swamp bog for fifteen whole years since being abandoned in the sewers of New York City as a newborn. She cared for him and kept him safe until his fifteenth birthday when she finally told him the truth.

However, one song midway through the movie shows that Hercules is using his newfound fame to take _very_ good care of them, building them an enormous mansion. In the film's conclusion, when Hercules triumphantly returns to Earth, they greet him happily as well. Hercules seems to accept both his earthly and heavenly parents as legit. The Series had an Aesop about this, with Herc's Muggle parents showing up at his school for a Parents' Day Thing rather than his godly ones. This trope is notably absent from original myths, where Herc's mother is just another one of Zeus's conquests after he disguised himself as her husband so he could sleep with her (the movie chose to cut this part for obvious reasons).
-   _The Jungle Book (1967)_:
    -   The original film starts with an infant Mowgli being adopted by a caring wolf family led by a wolf couple named Raksha and Rama. After several years being taught on how to adapt to the jungle, Mowgli finds himself in the comfort of hanging out with other wolves; even when being told by the wolf leader Rama that Mowgli needs to leave the jungle due to the threat of the man-eating tiger Shere Khan, Rama is reluctant to abandon Mowgli by admitting that the latter is like a son to him. This forces Bagheera and Baloo to take Mowgli to the nearby village, where he would be safe.
    -   The 2003 sequel revealed that when Mowgli told his story about his life in the jungle to the villagers, it inspired the village leader (along with his wife Messua and son Ranjan) to adopt Mowgli into their family. Similar to the wolves teaching Mowgli on how to adapt to the jungle, the village leader and Messua try to instill a sense of responsibility for Mowgli to become a valued community member.
-   _Kung Fu Panda_:
    -   _Kung Fu Panda_ starts out with Po being Obliviously Adopted by Mr. Ping, with their relationship so lovingly strong that the subject of parentage never came up. _Kung Fu Panda 2_ has Po getting memory flashbacks that drive him to confront Mr. Ping to finally confirm that he is adopted and the panda is feeling rather ambivalent about it. However, by the end of the story, Po comes to realize that despite what he learns about his past, the fact remains he is truly Mr. Ping's son in every meaningful way outside of biology and makes a point of telling him that. Ironically, his biological father is revealed to be alive immediately afterward.
        -   In _Kung Fu Panda 3_, Po meets his biological father Li for the first time and Ping soon becomes jealous of their immediate bond. However, by the end, Po reaffirms that his reunion with Li doesn't mean he loves his adoptive father any less and he is perfectly willing to call both of them "Dad".
    -   Tai Lung was treated like a son by Shifu before the former betrayed his foster father's principles in his pursuit of power. Tigress and Shifu had a similar relationship, although Shifu was relatively cold to her because of his falling out with Tai Lung. At least Tigress got to turn that around with Po's help.

-   Penny was fretting about her chances of adoption in _The Rescuers_ before she was kidnapped by the verbally abusive Madame Medusa. With the help of the titular two mice, she saves the day, and the movie ends with her getting adopted.

-   Disney's _Tarzan_, Kala adopts Tarzan and they have a close relationship. Rosie O'Donnell (who has two adopted children) has said that she took a role in the film because she liked how it put adoption in a positive light. Granted, Tarzan was adopted by _gorillas_, but he was happy.

-   In _From Up on Poppy Hill_, Shun Kazama is told he was given to his family by his gruff but loving father's commanding officer following the Korean War. The story they know is that the C.O. simply showed up one day and told the couple his wife couldn't care for the baby. He even sent child support until his death. But Shun's father makes it clear that Shun is his son and nothing will change that. Shun only brings up the topic because he fears that the girl he likes might be his biological sister.

-   In _The Jerk_, Navin Johnson grew up part of a poor black family. While he does strike out on his own upon learning that he was adopted ("You mean I'm going to _stay_ this color?") it's solely out of a desire to find his place in the world, and he stays in contact with his family and sends them money when he starts making it. When it all blows up in his face, they take him back in, and it ends with him and his wife dancing and playing music with the family.

While it's implied that she was not formally adopted due to her referring to him as "Marshall" and "sensei," it's clear she considers him to be a father. _Pacific Rim: Uprising_ also shows that she and Pentecost's biological son Jake truly care for each other despite some tension over his irresponsible and illegal actions.

-   _Somebody I Used to Know_: Sean was adopted by Barry and Jojo, and though he loves them (to the point of building his home on the same lot as theirs), not knowing his birth parents is still a touchy subject and he can't understand why Cassidy wouldn't want her family at their wedding.

-   In _Splitting Heirs_, Eric Idle is the lost son of a British noble family who was switched at birth.

-   In _Star Wars_, Leia Organa (a Skywalker and Naberrie-Amidala by birth) fits into this trope quite nicely, until, well... yeah.
    -   The Expanded Universe suggests that Luke was this as well with his aunt and uncle, despite the conflicts he had with the latter during the movie.
-   The eponymous mouse in _Stuart Little_ was adopted by the human Little family. Despite the warnings of the adoption agency and some early struggles with George and Snowbell, Stuart ultimately fits in very well with the Littles. He's ecstatic when he finds out that his supposed real parents aren't actually family.
-   _Then She Found Me_ is a less than idealistic portrayal of this trope, with Helen Hunt's adopted mother being a Jewish Mother with all the accompanying difficulties - but she is nonetheless very much the heroine's mother, and is mourned accordingly when she dies early in the movie. While Bette Midler as the biological parent then shows up, it's pointed out that she wasn't the heroine's mother when being so required work (as Helen says when she calls her out, she was sick a lot as a child). Meanwhile, the heroine's brother (their mother's biological son) is the only person with whom she remains on speaking terms throughout the whole movie. And though she spends the whole movie trying to have a baby and ignoring all suggestions of adopting a Chinese orphan, the final shot is of her being a loving mother to a little Chinese girl.
-   Kim from _Wake of Death_, after being rescued from a Human Trafficking vessel belonging to a Chinese triad, ends up being adopted by the Archer family which she grows to embrace by the end of the film. The Archer family wife Cynthia is this trope herself, being an orphan and a white girl adopted by a Chinese-American family - which is why she felt obliged to provide a home for this orphaned Chinese girl she found.
-   An especially moving example is revealed toward the end of _Where the Heart Is_ when Lexie marries Ernie. She explains to Novalee that Ernie's daughter Carol Ann is not his daughter - she's the child of his ex-wife, with whom he also has a son. His wife ran off and left him with both kids, so he raised them as though they were both his own; when the ex realized that Ernie wanted custody of her daughter, she demanded that he turn over his valuable antique sports car in exchange. As Lexie says, "He traded _his_ car for _her_ daughter."
-   _Wolves_: Cayden at the beginning, although he doesn't know he _is_ adopted. The emergence of his Wolf form changes that in the most horrific way.

     Literature 

-   _Animal Ark_: Mandy Hope lost her biological parents in a car crash when she was a baby. She doesn't have any memory of them.

This trope is certainly the case with Danny, who prefers to stay with Alfred Swenson to moving to his biological mother and her new husband along with his sister Peg.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   _The Bible_: In the _Book of Esther_, Esther's elder cousin Mordecai adopts her as his daughter after her parents have died.
-   In Classical Mythology: Aphrodite, goddess of beauty, was born of Uranus, the god of sky, when his castrated privates hit the sea, and the foam coalesced as Aphrodite. Zeus takes her in as one of the Olympians, and she even becomes one of the twelve main Greek Gods, with her never qualified as anything but Zeus's daughter. It is a little more ambiguous if Zeus's wife, Hera, is adoptive mother or stepmother and the two had their fights from time to time... but Hera tends to get into fights with her biological family too, so that likely only reinforces Aphrodite as a daughter figure.

    Podcasts 

-   _The Adventure Zone: Graduation_:
    -   Gordy was abandoned as a small child because his parents feared his necromantic powers, but he was found and adopted by some kind people who weren't afraid of him, but instead took care of him as they travelled the world and taught him all they knew about necromancy.

    -   Gordy decided to pay it forward and wound up adopting Rainer when she was a young girl. Just as his parents did for him, he taught her everything he knows and completely adores her.

    Poetry 

-   "Not flesh of my flesh" by Fleur Conkling Heyliger
    
    Not flesh of my flesh  
    Nor bone of my bone,  
    But still miraculously my own.  
    Never forget for a single minute,  
    You didn't grow under my heart,  
    But in it.

-   Comic Joe DeRosa is likewise quite happy with his adoptive parents, and is annoyed by the suggestion that whoever gave him up is his "real" family:
    
    "I hear it constantly: 'Joe, you're adopted, oh my God. Did you ever look for your real parents? Did ya ever do that?' Uh, no; I pretty much **took the hint**, actually."
    

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   Trucy Wright, the adopted daughter of Phoenix Wright, adores her father. She even calls him "Daddy" immediately after Phoenix gives her the option to call him Nick or Daddy if she wants. However, Trucy loves both her adopted and real fathers to the same extent and was, in fact, extremely sad when she figured out that her biological father had been murdered. She merely put on a brave smile so as to not worry either Apollo or her adopted father, Phoenix. Too bad it doesn't work, as Phoenix already has prior experience with the Stepford Smiler trope.
    -   From _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All_ there's the brothers Acro and the comatose Bat, adopted by the circus ringmaster Russell Berry. This pushes the events of the "Big Top" case into serious Tear Jerker territory, as Russell is the accidental victim of Acro's murder attempt.

    -   While they aren't EXACTLY adopted father and son one could say this was the relationship between Sirhan Dogen and Simon Keyes as Dogen is the only one Simon trusts with his life as Dogen saved his life as a 12-year-old child, and both serve as each other's Morality Pet.
-   Misuzu in _Air_ is an interesting case. Her aunt Haruko acts as her adopted mother, but distances herself from her for fear Misuzu will be taken away; but as the series continues, they grow very close.
-   Hayama Mizuki from _ef - a fairy tale of the two._ was adopted as a Replacement Goldfish for her parents' actual daughter, who drowned as a little girl. Mizuki herself underwent several traumatic experiences previously. Despite all this, she adores her parents, they adore her, and Mizuki says late into the story that she wasn't born to her real parents—she only came to be with them later.
-   Shirou Emiya, the main character of _Fate/stay night_, was adopted by the magus Kiritsugu after his parents (and other immediate family members) died in a fire. After Kiritsugu also died, Shirou remembers the six years they spent together as the happiest time in his life.
-   Chizuru in _Hakuouki_, somewhat. It's subverted in most routes, where Kodo reveals that he only took her in and raised her because she was the heir to the Yukimura clan and would be useful for repopulating it, but played straight in Hijikata and Okita's good routes, where he sacrifices himself to save her.
-   _Hatoful Boyfriend_: Hatoful House was an orphanage for birds orphaned specifically by war. The older birds worked, most of the younger birds went to school, and it was explicitly a family. Nageki, at least, was happy there.
-   In _Reflections on the River_, Prince Shun was adopted into the royal family from a neighbouring kingdom and seems happy enough with his situation despite having been demoted to Spare to the Throne. However, it's somewhat illusory, and some paths through the game end with him deciding to leave. The king and queen may have given him a life of luxury, but they didn't do it for his sake, and expect unquestioning obedience in return for their "charity". If Shun tells them that they wronged the protagonist, they call it treason.
-   Quark in _Virtue's Last Reward._ Tenmyouji found him abandoned as an infant during a thunderstorm, and although he initially tried to find a better home for the baby, he ended up raising the child as his own. The two have a deeply loving relationship, and in the game's Golden Ending, it's strongly implied that Tenmyouji, AKA Junpei, doesn't _want_ the Bad Future to change because he loves his adoptive grandson.
-   In _Dream Daddy_, Amanda can become this if the player so chooses.
-   Both the main protagonists, Hitomi and Kyosuke, are this in the _Parascientific Escape_ series. Hitomi starts the first game going Gene Hunting, but not because she dislikes her family—in fact, she's still deeply traumatized by her adoptive father's death because of how much she loves her family. Similarly, Kyosuke took after his adoptive dad in becoming a detective. However, Ritsu and Tsukiko's adoptive family is a bit of an aversion, as their adoptive parent is a Manipulative Bastard.

    -   Tachibana's father Katsura re-married Yuri, who also brought her daughter Yuzuriha with her into their house. However, Katsura passed away in his sleep, leaving Yuri to raise both Yuzuriha and Tachibana, adopting him into her family. Four years later, Yuri re-married Tokusa who brought his son Kuroki with him. Yuzuriha and Kuroki adapted to the new family quickly, however, Tachibana didn't feel the same way due to the fact that he was not blood-related to either of them. Despite this, the family keeps treating Tachibana like their own and Tokusa also promises to cover Tachibana's tuition fees to study at the Etra Institute of Technology University so he could do what Katsura couldn't.
    -   Akane was given a job and a place to stay by Kuroki and his parents at his guest house after escaping from her physically abusive father, Tachibana. After the summer season is over, Akane decides to quit her job and leave the house, though Kuroki encourages her to stay whenever she likes. However, Tachibana manages to find them, and Kuroki lets himself be beaten up by Tachibana to save Akane from him. Fortunately, a police officer, Karin, caught Tachibana beating Kuroki, with her father Akamatsu recording the beating, causing Tachibana to be arrested for assault.

    Webcomics

    -   Clair's birth parents are dead and lost at sea as it later turns out, also, in a way, dead , but Cassie is her surrogate mother and they have a very loving relationship. After Clair's father's disappearance gets solved, the adoption is treated as official.
-   Several episodes in _Batman: Wayne Family Adventures_ have moments that show that all of the Bat kids are this, as most of them came out of bad situations or lost their parents (or both) and Bruce gave them a chance to have a loving family and (sort of) normal life. Even the more abrasive family members like Jason and Damian show how much they truly appreciate what Bruce has done for them.
-   Myan from _Cat Nine_. Calling her happy is an understatement as she seems to genuinely love her new dad.
-   Lampshaded in _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_, with Alexis' relationship with Destania.
-   _Demonseed Redux_: Chico and Dee are treated as family by Hal and Mama Baga respectively and they trust them the most.

-   _Dragon Sanctuary_: Dean's not a Conin, but he considers Ellen and Meale his mother and sister all the same. Even after he’s brought into the royal court, he reaffirms to Meale that they're not his real family, just more family.
-   _El Goonish Shive_: Elliot's parents don't bat an eye when he brings home an Opposite-Sex Clone of himself. They're just ticked he didn't tell them where he was.
    -   Similarly, Grace takes to the Verres household like a fish to water, though her exact status in the family is a bit ambiguous as to whether it's official adoption (she's dating their son, Tedd), but since she turns 18 during the course of the story it may be a moot point.
    -   It's also indicated that adopted siblings Rhea and Diane are also this, and despite sniping at each other their concern for each other is genuine.
    -   Noah, the androgynous seyunolu whose parents were killed by Damien, was taken in by Adrian Raven. While their exact relationship is unclear at first and seems a bit distant, it soon becomes clear that they both consider each other family and care for one another deeply.
-   _Forestdale_ has Jake Noel, a deer/wolf hybrid who was adopted into a family of chameleons at the ripe old age of eight. Despite some of the cultural differences between reptiles and mammals that exist in the world of Forestdale, Jake has adjusted quite well to his new family and loves them like they were his own flesh and blood. It helps that the Noel family is a MASSIVE step up from his biological parents.
-   _Freefall_ has the Bowman's Wolves, who were all adopted by human families. Florence's family treats her as a human child, for the most part. The fact that she's legally property is little more than a formality. Her owner considers her his little sister and buys and sells things for her.
-   Sharon of _General Protection Fault_ was adopted by an interracial couple.
-   Agatha Clay in _Girl Genius_ often speaks of Adam and Lilith Clay as her mother and father, though she's always known herself to be adopted. They make it clear that they love her, and she won't let anyone insult them.
-   Depending on how you look at it, artificial creature Molly of _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ doesn't _have_ any real parents (though Jean sort of qualifies, because they share some genetic material). Anyway, Bob raised her, and she's currently living with Jean, and she loves them both very much.
-   Cute Monster Girl _Gronk_ was adopted by human woman Dale, and very much prefers the human side of life.
-   In _Kevin & Kell_, Lindesfarne was adopted by Kevin during his first marriage with Angelique (who wanted a prickly species as an excuse to keep her at arm's length) and while she has her own issues with Angelique neglecting her during her childhood, she loves her father and stepmother. Corrie was also briefly adopted by the Canids, but while she tired of their obsessive routines, her clone Dolly, who was used to living a structured life from being in the lab, appreciated what her adoptive family had to offer.
    -   Dolly's rather special because she's Happily Adopted... _twice_. After she started rapidly aging, she pretended to be Corrie's birth mother so the Canids wouldn't realize something was wrong. Then a time machine accident caused Dolly to regress to a baby. She conspired with Corrie to present herself as a Doorstop Baby named Mary, whom the Canids promptly adopted.
-   Eva of _Metal Phone Mouse_.
-   In _My Daughter Is A Zombie_, the fact that Su-ah is adopted isn't even revealed until the return of her deadbeat biological father. After the flashback of how Jeonghwan raised Su-ah after his sister's death, he asserts that he is Su-ah's real father because he birthed her through his heart. It's later implied that Su-ah knew she was adopted because her parents' blood types don't match up with hers, but she didn't think any differently after finding that out.
-   Ozy from _Ozy and Millie_ is a fox raised by a dragon. He's quite happy with his dad, even if he is a bit... odd. And, at the very end of the strip, his dad and Millie's mom get married, giving him an adoptive-but-loving _mother_ as well. He's been told of his biological parents, but as he reminded Millie once, he knows who his real father is. Even if he occasionally sits on him, or sets him on fire, or makes him scrub the moat as a chore.
-   _Pet Foolery_: One strip retells the story of _The Ugly Duckling_ as it would have been if the cygnet had ended up in a crocodile nest rather than a duck nest. She still feels awful, this time because she can't hunt like her adoptive family, but she's very happy with them other than that. One of her brothers reassures her after a failed attempt to drown a wildebeest and brings her some meat from their most recent catch.
-   In _A Petty Nuzlocke Challenge_, after Spuds the Venusaur and Barb the Nidoqueen discuss Barb's sterility, a Pokemon Breeder in the Sevii Islands offers them a Togepi egg to raise. When it hatches, _Spuds Jr is already a Togetic_, apparently just that happy with his new parents and eager to be a Badass Family.
-   Arthur in _Arthur, King of Time and Space_ is fostered rather than adopted by Ector, even in the contemporary arc, but it's definitely a happy family, with even Kay being a Jerk with a Heart of Gold. When his worst fear is manifested in the space arc as being that he's really Ector's bastard and condemned to life as Kay's squire, his reaction is "Well, it could be worse".
-   This is actually the whole plot behind _Selkie_. It's even called A Tale Of Adoption by the author.

-   In _Slightly Damned_, Darius assumed the role of father for orphaned demons Iratu, Sakido and Buwaro. When Buwaro found out the lengths Darius went to in order to protect them, he proudly assumed Darius's last name, something Demons don't normally have.
    -   A similar connection can be made for Rhea assuming the role of "big sister" to Buwaro, something she promised Sakido she would do when they escaped Hell.
-   An odd version of this appears in _Something\*Positive_. The strip's resident ditz Monette is adopted by Davan's parents, Fred and Faye, once they realize that her biological parents are complete jerks. The oddity of the arrangement is that they adopt Monette when she's in her _twenties_. But it works out surprisingly well.
    -   And now, Aubrey and Jason have adopted Pamela Joycelyn ("Pamjee") and she already feels more kin to her adoptive parents than most could have hoped for.
    -   Donna's son Rory was briefly thought to be Davan's biological child but turned out not to be. Since his bio dad is apparently quite a shit, though, Davan's stepped into a paternal role to the point that Rory calls him Dad.
-   _Terinu_ has his adoptive mother Melika, who, though a vulpine, loves her ferin "cubling" deeply. Word of God has said that Teri's memory of their brief time together as a family has kept him from being completely warped by Space Pirate Mavra Chan's Training from Hell.
-   A complicated version in _Yet Another Fantasy Gamer Comic_: Glon Smitharm was raised by the local smith and wasn't exactly happy, being considered ugly and half-human. It's later revealed he's the son of Baron Greyfort and Mrs. Bloodhand, while the Baron's son Lucas is actually the smith's son. They trade places, but neither is particularly happy (Lucas having been one of Glon's tormentors and showing no inclination towards smithing). Eventually Glon goes to the Black Mountain, having embraced his half-orc nature and Lucas becomes the baron after their biological/adoptive father's death, and after a lot of Character Development become true Bash Brothers.
-   In _Yokoka's Quest_, the barrier around Betel's Forest, among other things, makes people believe that Betelgeuse is their mother, and in turn that everyone else is their sibling. Combined with Easy Amnesia, most inhabitants end up living there with their new family in blissful ignorance.

-   Flotsam the pegasus from _Fallout Is Dragons_ is very happy with her adopted family. Aurelia is also an example, although she does grow weary of her adopted family's antics on occasion.
-   _Protectors of the Plot Continuum_:
    -   Most kids picked up by them are far happier in the Nursery or with whichever agents become their parents than they were with their original families, which were often Suvians or other fic characters. Suvians usually do not make good parents; among other things, they've been known to cause their own children to be killed or molested just for attention.
    -   Agent Momoka Shigisawa has no living relatives, her mother died in childbirth and her father passed away from illness later. She thus lives with the wealthy Hazama family through her high school years before the start of her PPC career, which is why she's painfully loyal and subservient to agent Kaguya Hazama.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Sandwich Stoutaxe, a Drow raised among Dwarves. Despite rough beginnings (Dad wished she was a sandwich instead of a baby, she tried to stab him in his sleep as an infant) and the difficulties a Drow Elf would face living among Dwarves (such as doors that are built for people half her height), she does quite well. She considers herself a member of the Stoutaxe clan first and an Elf second. Given what Drow society is like, she is _definitely_ better off.
-   Played with in _The Book of Stories OCT_ - while Aella loved her foster family, she'd still like to know about her real parents.
