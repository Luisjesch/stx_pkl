**Bart:** We came to talk to you about your son.  
**Rabbi Krustofski:** _**I have no son!**_ _\[slams the door\]_  
**Bart:** Oh, great! We came all this way and it's the wrong guy.  
**Rabbi Krustofski:** _\[opens door\]_ I didn't mean that literally! _\[slams door again\]_

Sometimes, what parents want for their children differs from what the children want to do, especially if the parent has plans for the child to Follow in My Footsteps. Sometimes the child wants to be himself in a career the parent dislikes. And sometimes, the parent struggles with this, but eventually comes around and supports his child.

And sometimes he doesn't. And if the child, usually a son, doesn't step into line quickly, the offending parent quickly disowns him, disavowing all knowledge that this "son" ever even existed.

Cue the sad violin music —it looks like the kid is going to have to learn to make his own way in this harsh, harsh world all alone.

This doesn't mean that reconciliation is impossible further on down the track. But it usually happens years later, when the kid's a success and often when the parent is on their deathbed, and it's a long, bitter road until that happens.

Rest assured, however, that the chances of this happening are far higher than one might expect. The initial sequence typically takes place in flashback — we only learn the story because the now successful disowned son is giving us a sob story about how much he wishes his father would approve, or at least _acknowledge_ his existence. If we see the event unfold in real time, then usually it gets wrapped up much sooner.

Bear in mind that the parent doing the disowning might not be entirely a jerk; sometimes, the kid just crosses a line they shouldn't cross (especially if they've grown up wrong or done something that violates their parents' trust) and deserves being kicked out with all ties severed. Again, reconciliation isn't an impossibility, but since this kid's bitter and twisted anyway don't expect it happening any time soon. And rest assured that the parent is going to have to justify their actions to the audience explicitly anyway, since the act of disowning one's own flesh and blood for any reason is well, pretty harsh. A justification commonly seen in a Crime and Punishment Series is when the parents essentially disown the child due to a crippling drug habit that the child has plunged into; this is often accompanied with a justification about how "there's only so long you can watch or enable them to destroy themselves before you have to sever all ties."

This trope has various roots — most obvious is the tendency of many writers to be of Jewish descent. Orthodox communities could be particularly unforgiving when it came to children (particularly males) who decided to try making their own way outside of the Jewish community. The same holds true for members of the LGBTQ+ community. Coming out has often led people to be disowned by their parents and their broader community.

Of course, overuse of this term has caused the words themselves to be considered a Dead Horse Trope, if not the entire plot itself. As a result, most modern examples tend to skew toward the side of comedy and frequently involve something absurdly trivial. When the question is not about comedy but the descendant actually _is_ the culprit, this trope can constitute Know When to Fold 'Em.

The exaggerated variant of this trope is honor killing, where the parents _not only_ disown the child, but murder them.

Can result in Disinherited Child. Compare Prodigal Family, when estranged family members show up after a long time to complicate a character's life.

See also: Changeling Fantasy, Unperson, Acquaintance Denial, and Where Did We Go Wrong?. Not to Be Confused with That Thing Is Not My Child! or with Heir Club for Men, where _literally_ not having a son is the source of the problem. Contrast the inverse trope, Disowned Parent (where a child disowns their parent), You're Not My Father, which is the opposite and is more often aimed at a Parental Substitute, and Hates Their Parent, the more general trope for when it's the kid with the issue, not the parent. Related to Disowned Sibling, where a sibling disowns another.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Nadeshiko's parents were so angry and disgusted that she had abandoned the Yamato Nadeshiko lifestyle they forced upon her for a more American way of living (to the point of dying her hair and calling herself Naddy) that they threw her out of the house and forbade her from returning.
-   _AIR_: Minagi's mother does this, although to be completely fair this was after the dream she had about the time she miscarried Michiru caused her to ever forget she had a daughter, and they make up later.
-   _Attack on Titan_:
    -   As a child, Historia Reiss desperately wanted acknowledgment and affection from her distant mother. On the one occasion when Historia dared to approach her mother, the woman struck her violently and stated she wished she had the courage to kill "that thing".
    -   After years of dreaming about meeting his father, Reiner Braun finally went to see the man. His father screamed in his face, accusing him of being there for revenge and stated his Secret Other Family would be in danger if anyone found out about it. The man then called him a monster and slammed the door in his face before he could manage to get a word out.
-   _Cardcaptor Sakura_: Nadeshiko Kinomoto was cut off from her highly wealthy family after she married a poor, humble student-teacher and the protagonist's father; more hatred was directed at the husband both for being of a lower class and because she was a school student when she married him, but she was disowned anyway. Interestingly, she wasn't upset with this, and her living family, especially her cousin, talk of her as if she were a saint.
-   _Code Geass_:
    -   Lelouch vi Britannia gives up his claim to the Britannian Imperial Throne in outrage after his father, Emperor Charles zi Britannia, shows complete indifference to his mother and sister, who were killed and crippled respectively. The Emperor then verbally declares his ten-year-old son always dead from the moment he was born, before sending Lelouch and his sister, Nunnally, to Japan to serve as hostages, meant to be killed if Britannia ever invades. Less than a year later, Britannia _does_ invade, and (as far as Charles knows) condemns his children to death. However, out of all his children, the Emperor actually liked Lelouch and Nunnally the most and sent them over to Japan for their safety (though Lelouch furiously calls him out for the senseless hypocrisy of this plan). _The Nightmare of Nunnally_ reshapes them into more sympathetic characters, as well.
    -   Inverted when Lelouch accidentally forces his beloved half-sister, Princess Euphemia li Britannia, to commit genocide against the Japanese population, an act which causes the Japanese people to rise up in open revolt, giving Lelouch the chance to drive Britannia out of Japan once and for all. His father's reaction to this? _"Ha! Finally, an act which proves him worthy to be my son!"_
-   _Cross Ange_: This is expected of parents in the Society of Mana who conceive a Norma, a child who can't use the Light of Mana. In the world of _Cross Ange_, Norma are seen as violent, depraved monsters that must be separated from this peaceful society. This happens to several characters:
    -   The first episode shows our main character, Princess Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi, telling a begging mother of a Norma baby to "rid herself of the memory of this creature, and give birth to a new daughter who is not a Norma". The mother's response is to toss her baby's bottle at Angelise in a grieving rage.
    -   The plot manages to kick off because Angelise is actually a Norma herself, but her parents defied this trope and tried to pass Ange off as a respectable Mana user. However, Angelise's brother, Prince Julio, became aware of Angelise's Norma status, and sabotaged her Baptism Ceremony to reveal to the Misurugi Empire the truth. When Angelise gets her mother killed trying to resist arrest, Empress Sophia reveals in her final moments that she tried so hard to protect Angelise from the truth. The huge reveal is played as a case of Laser-Guided Karma for Angelise as well, as her own friends turn on her and reject her as well. We even get to see the mother of the Norma baby watching the whole ordeal on TV and shouting at the screen, "You deserve it!".
    -   Hilda is put on the receiving end of this trope when she reunites with her mother, who has already long forgotten about her and has had a new daughter whom she's named Hilda. When she finally gets her identity out (and scares the other Hilda by shattering a Mana spell due to her Norma status), her mother furiously claims that she wishes she'd never given birth to a "beast" like her, and demands she Get Out!. Poor Hilda even gets a piece of apple pie thrown at her when she doesn't immediately respond. The whole ordeal is made even more jarring when earlier in that episode, a flashback was shown of Hilda's mother trying to _keep_ the police from taking the original Hilda away.
-   _Count Cain_: Played for Laughs and drama during the Red Ram arc, when Oscar is introduced initially as one of Emmeline's suitors. He takes Mary off on a trip fairly late in the story, when it's become pretty clear Jack the Ripper is one of the people in the story, and when Cain telephones the baron Oscar said was his father to ask if he knows where his son is right now he gets "there's no one called Oscar in this household." Cain understandably _freaks_. After everything is sorted out with the real culprit and Cain has lost another Love Interest, Oscar's line when confronted is the spectacularly unclear "Aargh! That old bastard denied I was his son?" As it turns out, Oscar was pretty-much-disowned for being useless and dissolute and getting kicked out of college repeatedly after his fiancee died. No reconciliation is ever shown, but then apart from coming under suspicion over the Rose Scar thing, Oscar is a comic relief character for the rest of the series.
-   _Doki Doki! PreCure_: This is King Jikochuu's first reaction when Regina doesn't want to destroy the human world for him. His second reaction is casting a thunder on her. When he wants her to come back to him, she reminds him of what he said to her. He "apologizes" for that. Though, it's obvious his apology is not meant seriously. He brainwashes her.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Invoked in Chapter 491: Irene transforms Hisui into a mouse, intending for her father to be disgusted by his daughter's new form and throw her away. The exact opposite happens, as Toma makes it clear that no matter what form Hisui is in, she's still his daughter, and swears on his life that he'll do anything to return her to normal.
    -   Irene refused to acknowledge Erza as her daughter and even tried to kill her when they reunited. In turn, Erza disowns Irene, claiming that her only parent was Makarov Dreyar and true family was Fairy Tail. Though after her mother chose to kill herself in an act of redemption and parental love, Erza's opinion towards her has softened over the past year, even referring to Irene as her mother after her death.
-   _Fruits Basket_:
    -   Kyoko Katsunuma is disowned by her parents because she tarnished their rep by being a _sukeban (delinquent girl)_. She sort of was luckier than other examples, though: this happened _right_ when her counselor and until-then Big Brother Mentor, Katsuya Honda, was about to ask them for permission to marry her (she was a minor back then); once he saw how badly the Katsunumas treated her with his own eyes, he gave them a **very** deserved tongue-lashing and took Kyoko into his home.
    -   Momiji's mother rejected him for his Zodiac curse. Just before her memory was wiped, he overheard her calling him "that _creature_" and stating that she regrets ever giving birth to him. She refuses not only to see him as her son but also to consider him _human_.
    -   Kyo was kicked out of the house because his father constantly blamed him for "causing" his mother's suicide... even though she committed suicide thanks to said father's abuse for being the mother of the Cat.
    -   Rin was effectively disowned by her parents after an unfortunate question she asked shattered their Stepford Smiler attitude.
    -   Ren Sohma's treatment of her daughter Akito is an extreme example. She sees her not as a daughter, but as a _love rival_ for attracting the attention of her dead husband. While the Sohma were discussing about Akito's inheritance, Ren called her "that." Flashbacks reveal that Ren came very close to aborting Akito upon learning that she's female (before Akira vetoed it in exchange for Akito to be raised as a man), and refused to hold her as a baby, leaving Akito to be raised by the Sohma retainers.
-   In the OVAs to _Fushigi Yuugi_, after the events of the series proper, Miaka goes to live with her father, before marrying Taka Tamahome at the age of 18, to get away from her overbearing mother, who was not pleased that she ended up going to Yotsubadai High School instead of Jonan High School. Mrs. Yuuki is not seen at Miaka's wedding, or at the birth of Miaka's daughter, and it's implied that they no longer speak to one another.

    -   Miho's mother decides that as she is not living up to the family's standards, she will be disowned. In the anime, Shiho has not told Miho as of the end of the first season, but claps after her victory over Maho. In the manga, Shiho sends Kikuyo, one of the family maids, to tell Miho that if she loses against Pravda, she will be disowned; Miho has not reacted to this apart from becoming a Stepford Smiler.
-   _Heaven's Lost Property_: Eishiro Sugata accidentally got his older brother killed when he neglected to inspect a hang glider, causing his brother to crash. His parents angrily kicked him out of the house, and when they had another son, they did not tell him about Eishiro. When they briefly meet again, his parents act like he is not there, and when his younger brother asks who he is, they say he is just a stranger.
-   _Hunter × Hunter_: The Zoldyeks were notably known for, among many things, having only sons, and Alluka was presumed to be one as well, but she is "not to be thought of as human or as family."
-   _I Belong to the Baddest Girl at School_: Kanade's mother threatens to strip Kanade of her family name if she doesn't break up with Fuyuhiko. Luckily, it doesn't come to that.
-   _Isabelle of Paris_:
    
    -   Léon' disowns Geneviève for falling in love with a commoner.
    
    **Geneviève:** _"Father-"_
    
    **Léon**: _"Do not call me that."_ (to his crying wife) _"Marie, do not be upset. The Geneviève we know is dead. Our only children are now Andréa and Isabelle."_
    
    -   He does this again to Andréa after his actions inadvertedly cause Marie's death.

-   _Kaze no Stigma_: Kazuma wasn't a fire mage like the rest of the family, so Genma disowned him and kicked him out. Slowly subverted through the rest of the series mostly through Ren, Kazuma's brother and resident Morality Chain.
-   _Kotoura-san_:
    -   Haruka's parents disown her after she (innocently) reveals that they are both having affairs. Kumiko even tells Haruka that "\[she\] should never have given birth to \[her\]". It's revealed, in the final episode, that Kumiko regrets all this, but the damage had been done.
    -   It is implied that Haruka's grandfather then disowned his own daughter, Haruka's mother, and took Haruka under his care.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_: This is Precia's reaction to Fate when she realized that she's her own person and not a perfect clone of her dead daughter, Alicia, leading to much emotional and physical pain for the young girl.
-   _Magilumiere Co. Ltd._: Koshigaya's father cut ties with her and no longer wants to have any connection with her after she entered the magical girl industry.
-   _Metamorphosis_: Saki's own mother, after finding out about the apparent affair her husband was having with their own daughter (actually him raping her), ends up kicking Saki out of their house, with Saki's father also wanting nothing to do with her as well.
-   _Naruto_: In the Land of Tea arc, Idate Morino, who had always been regarded as cowardly and unfit to be a ninja by his brother Ibiki, ends up separated from Ibiki through an incident that Idate thought had resulted in Ibiki's death. He joins the Wasabi family, and after saving his clan from dissolution by winning a race with Team 7's help, sees Ibiki again, who says that he doesn't recognize him as his brother, since his brother was a coward, in a roundabout So Proud of You way.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Whitebeard considers every member of his crew, past and present, to be his sons. For the crime of killing another member of Whitebeard's crew, Blackbeard is the only one to ever be disowned. To put things into perspective, he even still considers the man who got manipulated into stabbing him his son.
    -   When Baby 5 was a little girl, her mother harshly abandoned her after telling her she's a bother, and isn't useful or needed. She's had a habit of doing things for others if she thinks that they need her ever since.
    -   Vinsmoke Judge doesn't consider Sanji a son of his or anything more than a means to an end.
    -   Lola herself still likes her mother, Big Mom, despite running away, so much so that she thought Big Mom would be glad to give the Straw Hats help if they showed up with a piece of Big Mom's Vivre Card that she had given them. In truth, Big Mom hates her daughter for running away because doing so ruined an especially important Arranged Marriage Big Mom had set up that would have given her enough power to become the King of the Pirates. This left Big Mom so angry that she is ready to have hitmen sent after her daughter if she ever finds her.
-   _PandoraHearts_: Zai Vessalius calls his son, Oz Vessalius, "it" and says he's filthy. Subverted in that the real Oz Vessalius was stillborn and Zai replaced his dead child with Jack Vessalius, who was trapped in an ever-repeating Fountain of Youth due to the Abyss rejecting his soul, and given that Oz himself is the Bloodstained Black Rabbit who was responsible for carrying out the Tragedy of Sablier, there's no reason why Zai wouldn't consider him filthy. Not only that, it seemed like an example of Even Evil Has Standards when he is revolted by Jack asking him to "replace" his dead son and dismissing his son's death. Basically, Jack just rubbed his son's death in the dirt and asked him to replace him with an imposter. Justified Trope indeed.
-   _Punchline_: Ito has been disowned by her politician father for dropping out of high school. He doesn't want people to know he has a daughter that won't go to school.
-   _Ranma ½_: Genma has done this to Ranma a few times. However, Genma does this for petty reasons, like Ranma stealing his food, or being beaten in a sparring match. Or if, y'know...he's a girl at the moment. This is Genma's default threat and response for all petty grievances, although in something of a subversion, whenever Ranma really is in trouble or needs help Genma is the one that he always turns to, and he's gone to lengths to help his son. Taking anything in _Ranma 1/2_ seriously leads directly to something bad, but Genma is a hideously abusive parent, and probably the main reason Ranma relies on him at all is that with the long training trip he's never known anyone else long.
-   _Shibatora_: "Surprise Acquittal" Kuma Gorou, a defense attorney with his own TV show, implied to be an Amoral Attorney, is called in by his son, who's been arrested for violation of juvenile prostitution mediation, juvenile prostitution solicitation, and anti-child pornography laws, to be his defense attorney. However, it turns out that Kuma Gorou is actually a Crusading Lawyer, who immediately recognizes his son's guilt and disowns him, saying that he encouraged his son to study law, not because he needed a successor, but because he hoped it would improve his son's character. He rescinds his disownment, to the detriment of his own career and public image, on the condition that his son confess to everything.
-   _Skip Beat!_: Kyoko's relationship with her mother is incredibly strained. Her mother, Saena, was always emotionally distant, quick to anger, and left Kyoko in the care of Shou's parents at a young age. Kyoko has come to terms with being disliked. Through a circumstance on a televised show, Saena gets asked if she has any children at all. Saena cooly claims on TV that she has none. Kyoko does not react kindly to those words, absolutely devastated that her existence is being denied by her mother.
-   _Takopi's Original Sin_:
    -   When Shizuka finally reaches her dad's city apartment, he's lovingly taking care of two other kids. They ask about the dirty, disheveled girl at the front door, to which he pretends he doesn't know her and goes back inside.
    -   Despite studying hard, Azuma comes home with a bad grade on one of his tests. His mom gives him the pancakes he's craved, with him believing his mom finally understands his pain... only for her to declare that she's given up on him, and she won't even bother trying to be a good mom.
-   _Tweeny Witches_: After 14 years of separation, Atelia blatantly lies to her own son, Lennon, that she's not the woman he's looking for. Even when she takes it back, he attempts to kill her because her Conflicting Loyalty reinforces his false belief that she abandoned him and his father to satisfy her lust for power. Fortunately, they reconcile after she sacrifices her reputation in exchange for his freedom with the encouragement of Arusu.
-   _Urusei Yatsura_: Ataru's mother's catchphrase is that she wishes that she never had him.
-   _Wandering Son_: Yuki is shown to have a tough time with her mother, whose visits are just stressful, and her father, who's more or less told Yuki not to come home because she's Transgender. The fact that she's "Mama" of a gay bar probably doesn't help, either.
-   _Your Name_: The side novel _Another Side: Earthbound_ reveals that Toshiki's family originally had someone in mind for him to marry. When he chose to pursue a relationship with Futaba instead despite various attempts to persuade him to do otherwise, they disowned him.

    Comic Books

This evil clone captured Cable's wife Aliya and raped her, leading to her having a son that, while genetically the same as if it had been Cable's, was _not_ his son.

-   In _X-Statix_:
    -   Vivisector's father insists that the fact that Myles is his son is "a matter of opinion". Why? Simple - Vivisector is a gay mutant. Joining the X-Force was evidently the last straw, because by becoming a celebrity daddy couldn't pretend he didn't exist anymore.
    -   Played for Laughs by supporting character Lacuna, who _actively tries_ to get this reaction from her parents after discovering she's a mutant. When they accept her mutation with open arms, she tries to join the X-Force... and they're supportive of that, as well. Finally, she becomes a talk show host, squandering her incredible gift by chatting up celebrities. All she ever wanted was for her parents to be disappointed in her.

-   This is a large concern for many young mutants, but a particular standout would be Surge from _New X-Men_. When her father finds out that she's a mutant, he disowns her, because he "doesn't believe in mutants." When she tries to get back in contact with her family, in particular her little brother, he basically says that she's not his daughter. It should be noted that this is entirely on his part, as her mother is just relieved that she's safe and learning to control her abilities.
-   Renee Montoya's parents disowned her when Two-Face outed her as a lesbian and she admitted it to them in the _Gotham Central_ arc "Half A Life." Her father appears in a later arc; from the look on his face when he sees her, he clearly regrets what he did, but by that point Renee is understandably unwilling to have anything to do with him. They're able to make up before he passes away in _Convergence_: _The Question_ #2
-   In the initial "Moon Knight" series, Marc Spector (Moon Knight) has this in his background. It happened after he one-punched his father, which should count as some sort of justification.

    -   Made worse when Tony's inner monologue includes the thought "I'd heard it before." Yes. Even _hell_ couldn't conjure up a father more emotionally cruel than Tony's actual father. And Tony _still_ couldn't bring himself to attack his own father. Until "Howard" tells Tony that he was a disappointment to his mother as well.
-   Green Arrow threw out his ward Roy Harper when he discovered Roy was a heroin addict and called him a no-good punk, then later acted proud as if _he_ was responsible for Roy going cold turkey and beating his addiction, when it was really because of Black Canary and Green Lantern. Much later, after Roy's arm was cut off and his daughter was killed, Roy angrily lapsed into being a drug-addicted anti-hero before he was found and knocked out by Dick Grayson. When he awoke, Roy discovered he had been strapped to a bed in St. Virgil's, a center for supervillains with substance abuse problems. Dick had done this with Black Canary's consent, who later flat out said that Roy was beyond help and washed her hands of him. In a later issue of _Birds of Prey_, it's shown that Canary very much realizes this was a mistake when she's subjected to Mind Rape involving an image of Roy asking how she could let him become "this thing" he is now.
-   After Klara Prast began talking to the plants on her farm (and they started _responding_), her religious asshole parents not only disowned her, they sold her to an alcoholic creep who took her off to America to be his wife... at 11 years old. All manner of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse ensued. Thankfully, she later befriended the Runaways, who took her off to the future, where her asshole parents and abusive husband were both long dead.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Bitterman_, a recurrent strip of MAD magazine, had one issue of the titular character visiting his father in the old folks home, so the attendant knocks on the door.
    
    **Attendant**: Mr. Bitterman! Your son has come to visit you!  
    **Father**: Son? I don't have a son!  
    **Attendant**: It's okay, at this age, the memory of the residents tend to fail.  
    **Bitterman**: Oh, his memory is all right. We just hate each other.
    
-   _Doonesbury_: There is a series of strips where Mark Slackmeyer's father used this phrase when he came to the conclusion that what he really had was "...a parasitic offspring who year after year just barely manages to pass his classes in time for me to shell out another four thousand bucks". This punchline lent itself to the name of the collection it was later reprinted in.

The boy and dragon land in the Encanto, where Hiccup is adopted into the Madrigal family and comes to realize just how affected he was by Stoick's treatment. A year after he escaped, Stoick manages to track him down (legitimately sorry for what he's done and wanting his son back).

-   A rare heartwarming version in _Harry Tano_. After saving four-year-old Harry from the Dursley house, Ahsoka is declared Harry's official mother by Lily's ghost.

-   Endrin practically says he's given up on Trian and Bhelen in _Dragon Age: The Crown of Thorns_, only it's the dwarven noble protagonist that he tells it to, just before the whole kinslaying happens (or does it?) and he sweeps the second son under the rug while passively watching Bhelen get things going his way. It's no wonder the DN takes matters into his own hands and manipulates _the entire city-state_, including Endrin, Trian, Bhelen, you name it, the way he does. Later, it is revealed that Endrin played it straight with Bhelen, although the fact he didn't do it publicly allowed the guy to take control of House Aeducan after the king died.

    **Miklan**: I know you do. _(Knocks her out)_
    
-   In _TO On the Streets_, Judy orders Monica out of the house on her eighteenth birthday, revealing that she actually wanted an abortion when she realised that she was pregnant with Monica and Jack and Ross are on holiday specifically to avoid dealing with this expulsion. Monica only learns the truth years later at her wedding to Chandler, as Chandler invited Ross as his college roommate unaware that Ross was Monica's brother, after which Ross confirms that he and Jack had no idea what Judy was going to do. Once Jack learns the full situation, he leaves Judy as soon as she confirms what she did, making it clear to her that just the fact she'd ask him to choose between his wife and his daughter is all Jack needs to realise that there isn't a choice as far as he's concerned.
-   In _Boys und Sensha-do!_, found here, it is revealed that Shiho is still planning on disowning Miho, despite her having won against Black Forest because her way is not the traditional Nishizumi way, and she now has boys on her team.

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: The sibling-to-sibling variation. San, formerly Ghidorah's left head before his head was cut off and he merged himself with Dr. Graham, stops seeing Ghidorah's other two heads as his "elder brothers" after his Heel Realization. Justified, as Ghidorah's definition of siblinghood is two or more heads Sharing a Body with each-other, like San now does with Vivienne and like he used to but no longer does with Ichi and Ni.
-   In _Three Can Keep a Secret_, Dipper inverts this. When Mabel asks Dipper how he could leave their parents behind in Piedmont, Dipper flatly tells her that life in Piedmont was terrible for him, that he's surprised if their parents ever noticed he was gone, and that it's always been obvious that they loved Mabel more than him. As far as Dipper's concerned, Stan and Ford are his parents.

-   In Chapter 10 of _Loud Heroes_, Chandler's father made for the fic, Mr. McCann, says to Chandler "You're not my son." when he sees the latter's burnt appearance (to which he claims "No son of mine is a hideous freak.") as a result of getting soaked in toxic waste spilled by collateral damage from the fight Mr. McCann had with the L-Crew beforehand, because of which he ends up caught by the police and arrested shortly after. It bites back on Mr. McCann (who regrets what he told Chandler too late) when Chandler goes to disown him and kill him in prison after being healed from his injuries and getting a new chance to live by Andrew Tetherby.
-   _Syngenesophobia_:
    -   In Chapter 2, Lynn Sr. briefly considered to disown the Loud sisters (sans Lily) for beating up Lincoln to the point that he had to be hospitalized in the first chapter, but thankfully didn't follow up on it.
    -   A Downplayed sibling version, because Lily's only a baby and can't exactly disown them. But she is smart enough that she's _furious_ with the other sisters and wants nothing to do with them. In later chapters, she lets go of her resentment after seeing how miserable the sisters ended up getting.
    -   Played straight in Lincoln's dreams as Ace Savvy, wherein The Deuce (his superhero version of Lily, now aged up to seven), disowns her older sisters.
    -   When the rest of the sisters confront Lori about losing her temper and yelling at Lincoln, Lynn threatens that they'll disown her if her actions ruin their chances to make up with Lincoln. Leni follows it up by saying Lynn isn't making a hollow threat, and none of the other sisters disagree with her (Leni herself actually does, but she was too shocked to protest against Lynn).
-   In _Ultimate Spider-Woman: Change With The Light_, Harvey Broxtel's parents call their son a "monster" and declare that he's dead to them. They also show more concern for Spider-Woman than for Harvey, even though she was the one who beat him unconscious. This is because Harvey is a sadistic psychopath with a long history of committing very violent crimes who became the full-blown Pyromaniac Firebrand after he acquired the ability to generate and control fire. The reason Harvey's parents are thanking Spider-Woman for knocking him out is because he tried to kill them for cutting him out of their will and using their money to compensate all of the people he murdered both before and after he became a supervillain.
-   _Miraculous: Marinette's baby_: Despite the fact that Adrien wants the baby and is fully willing to raise it, Gabriel thoroughly Un-persons his unborn grandson, believing that it would ruin his son's future. It is the part when Gabriel refers to the baby as "it" that really clinches it for Marinette.
-   _A Price to Pay_ uses this as part of Adrien's Laser-Guided Karma. After learning that Hawkmoth is his father, he switches sides and helps Gabriel win, not caring about how the Wish will warp reality or claim the life of another in order to bring back his mother Emilie. After all, it's not like anybody will _know_ they were responsible for the death, right...? But the Wish collects its price by having Gabriel cause a fatal car accident, and when he brazenly uses his wealth to ensure the trial goes his way through bribery, Emilie is so outraged that she divorces him. And since Adrien tries to defend his father's flagrant disregard for human life, Emilie disavows her son, wanting nothing to do with either of them.
-   _There's More Magic Out There_: In chapter 25, Audrey's treatment of Chloé gets worse after learning the latter is now a werewolf, treating her more like an animal than a human being.

-   When Ping comes back to home, after living twelve years as a soldier, in _Make a Man Out of You_, his mother rejects him for being transgender.

Ping ultimately decides that he doesn't need anyone from his old life anymore.
-   In _Karma in Retrograde_, Endeavor tells his son Touya this after learning that he (or rather, his future self) is Dabi.
    
    **Endeavor:** Quit acting like you don't know. You can trick them, but you won't fool me again. I should have known you were rotten to your core.  
    **Touya:** Like Father, Like Son, right?  
    **Endeavor:** You are _not_ my son.
    
-   _Mastermind: Rise of Anarchy_: Inko blames her son, Izuku Midoriya (aka Mastermind), for corrupting Shouto Todoroki when she visits Rei Todoroki at a mental hospital.
-   _A Diplomatic Visit_:
    -   Johnny Apple disowned his daughter Slice n' Dice, who'd become a butcher in the Packlands, over false information that her temporary laborers brought him; he even forced his wife Lazuli to destroy their pictures of her and pretend their second-born, Bramley, was their _only_ child. He eventually comes around though when Celestia presents him with evidence that he'd been lied to about her.
    -   Downplayed with Lazuli herself, who _acted_ like she agreed with him in public. Privately though, she refused to forget her eldest and only destroyed extras of the photos to fool her husband, having always kept the originals and a set or two of duplicates in a safe place; when Celestia comes to the family with proof that Slice n' Dice is not a criminal like they thought, Lazuli is the first to openly ask for more information in the hopes that she was right to continue believing in her daughter.
-   _Loved and Lost_, an extended retelling of "A Canterlot Wedding", has a sibling variant; the manipulated Twilight Sparkle disowns her brother Shining Armor when she mistakenly believes Princess Cadance just became injured because of him as well as her former friends and Celestia. She also does that in retaliation of the way he renounced her at the wedding rehearsal, wording her words the same way he did. She does later regret this once she realizes how she's being manipulated and reconciles with Shining Armor who in turn owns up to his own actions toward her.
    
    **Twilight**: And you can forget about me calling you my BBBFF<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  anymore! In fact, I don't even have a brother.
    
-   _A Moon and World Apart_:
    -   In chapter 5, it's mentioned that the Apple family disowned one of their own after that pony was discovered to be part of the "avengers" hate group. The rest of the clan won't even mention their name.
    -   Variant in chapter 27. After discovering he was behind the storming of Canterlot Castle and the attack on her personally, Celestia disowns Blueblood, declaring angrily that "_You are no nephew of mine!_"
-   An interesting variant of this trope happens in the _Reading Rainbowverse_ when Spitfire disowns Lightning Dust. At first it seems the usual "disappointed mother" route, but then Spitfire is relieved of duty and forced into therapy; she admits she's actually very sure that Lightning Dust hates her and that she deserves a better mother.
-   _How I Lost My Mother_ has this as part of Cozy Glows' Start of Darkness, being not only abandoned by her mother, but also _Un-Person'd_ through Celestia casting Laser-Guided Amnesia to erase all traces of her ever having a child in the first place and using both Cozys' aunt Luna and Twilight Sparkle to fill in the void afterwards. Made all the worse when Cozy discovers her mothers' personal diary to find out why this happened in the first place: Celestia essentially experienced a prophetic vision of Cozy Glow _potentially_ becoming a threat to Equestria, but that hours after committing the deed; she found out that it was actually a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. But instead of trying to track down her estranged daughter, Celestia doubled-down hoping that Cozy would just stay away and live out her life alone that way Celestias' reputation as an infallible ruler isn't threatened. Needless to say, Cozy Glow is completely unamused by this revelation.
-   Itachi is disowned by his clan in _Son of the Sannin_ due to him being against their planned coup. His disownment ends up being rescinded when the coup fails since only two other members of the clan survived and the new clan head is his best friend Shisui.
-   _Will Of Foxfire_: Itachi finds out that this was done to Naruto by his **entire** family to the point they pulled a partial Unperson on him by erasing his personal history before shoving him into foster care with fake induction papers at the age of five before threatening to kill him should he tell anyone who his real family is. The reason for this drastic action? Naruto is a werewolf born into a family of Kitsune. To be fair, the reason he was disowned was due to pressure from outside the family; while undoubtedly some of them wanted him gone, there were plenty of them who liked him. Also, the others wanted Naruto _killed,_ it's arguable that the only way to keep him alive was to do what they did.
-   _Father_: After Asuka is taken advantage of at a party and becomes pregnant, her father immediately intends to drag her back to Germany and "restore their family honor" by forcing her to get an abortion. When she resists, he strikes her, and Shinji responds by beating seven shades of crap out of him. Sohryu then disowns Asuka, declaring that he's seizing all the family property for himself... but Gendo bluntly informs him that not only are Asuka and Shinji untouchable due to being under NERV jurisdiction, her mother's will made Asuka the sole inheritor of the family fortune. By disowning her, Sohryu forfeited his own beneficiary rights. What's more, Shinji and Asuka are engaged, and Gendo makes clear that he considers her part of _his_ family now and will protect her at all costs.
-   _Mr and Mrs Gold_: Maurice essentially disowns Belle when he finds out that she married Rumpelstiltskin of her own free will and became a sorceress, denying her even when she offered to help him when he fell ill. In Storybrooke, Moe French did the same thing when she broke it off with her handsome finance Gaspard and cancelled all plans last minute to marry Mr. Gold, who he sees as an Ambiguously Evil landlord and implied criminal. They eventually reconcile after Mr. Gold gives him a "The Reason You Suck" Speech after rejecting Rose's offer to give one of her kidneys to save him.
-   In Nine Months, April's father disowns her after he finds out that she's pregnant.
-   This is used non-conventionally in _Achilles' Heel_ when Lusamine wonders whether she has the right to call Gladion and Lillie her children after their abusive upbringing.
-   A common occurrence in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_. Many parents have disowned their children when they turn out to be bloodliners, though in Belladonna's case, she was thrown out for being a _lesbian_ instead.
-   In _Ma Fille_, Louise disowns Laura after the latter tries to have her and Joe arrested in a ploy to take Katrina away from them. She words it as "having no children left", as her older daughter Heather had died over a decade prior from childbirth complications.
-   Weiss' father in _Fighting for the Future_ disowned her long before the story starts. He doesn't even refer to her as his daughter, but as "a lunatic who endangered \[the\] family".
-   In _Saki: After Story_, Teru keeps denying that Saki is her sister, even though Sumire knows otherwise. When Saki tries to go over to talk to Teru after defeating her in the final round of the tournament, Teru flies into a rage and beats up Saki with a metal pipe, a box cutter, and a chair (also attacking Nodoka when she tries to help). It takes the rest of Teru's team to restrain her, and Sumire telling Teru that she spoke with her parents and obtained proof that Saki is her sister before Teru realizes what she's done.
-   In two 4komas, (here and here) Teru's disowning Saki is parodied, when it's indicated that Teru is denying Saki's existence due to being angry over Saki making fun of her small breasts.
-   _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_: In an alternate timeline where Papa Smurf marries Smurfette and has a child with her, he becomes such a draconian leader that he is ultimately overthrown and run out of the village along with his new nuclear family by Empath and the rest of the smurfs. Later, when he learns that Empath and several other smurfs have been trapped in time, he declares that they're his "former little smurfs", disavowing even his relationship with his son Empath.
-   _Unlinked_: Downplayed. Amelia cares deeply about Hazel's wellbeing and enjoys having her in her life despite her general distaste for children. However, she dislikes thinking of the girl as her daughter and hates when Hazel calls her "mom".
-   _Unbreakable Red Silken Thread_: Gwen's mother disowns her and kicks her out of her house because of her insistence of staying with Duncan.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _The Book of Life_, after Manolo refuses to kill the bull, Carlos disappointingly tells him he is "not a real Sanchez."
-   In _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_, Hiccup is told this by his father Stoick. Fairly predictable though, given Stoick's personality and Hiccup's actions. Unlike many other examples of this trope, _Stoick_ is hurt by his words as badly as Hiccup is — he physically staggers when he leaves the room and realizes what he's said.
-   _Kung Fu Panda_:
    -   _Kung Fu Panda_, the first movie: When Tai Lung, who was all but a son to Master Shifu, confronts Shifu at the temple with "I'm home, Master." With barely restrained grief, Shifu retorts to his "son" with "This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master."
    -   _Kung Fu Panda 2_: Lord Shen was also essentially disowned by his parents when they banished him from his ancestral home. It's rather hard to blame the parents in this case as this was in response to Shen _committing genocide_. Despite this, it's later revealed that Shen's parents truly did care about him as the pain of having to do this to their son literally killed them.
-   In _The Sissy Duckling_, during an argument Elmer's father tells his mother that he doesn't have a son. He considers Elmer a weakling and a sissy for being so flamboyant.
-   _Wonder Woman Blood Lines_: When Diana chooses to help Steve escape Themyscira, she briefly battles with Hippolyta over aiding a prisoner and running off with the sacred armor. In response, Hippolyta proclaims she's not her daughter and essentially kicks her off the island. When Diana returns home and saves it from Medusa, Hippolyta welcomes her home and even proudly accepts her Man's World title of Wonder Woman. This is a huge departure from Hippolyta's usual characterization, where she wants to protect her daughter from the outside world.

-   In the 1994 version of _Angels in the Outfield_, Roger asked his biological father when they could become a family again. His father sarcastically replied "When the Angels win the pennant," spurring his son to Wish Upon a Star for that very thing to happen, not realizing his father was being sarcastic. Later, when his father officially gives up custody of Roger to the state of California, Roger is excited to be called in, as the Angels are rocketing up the standings and on the verge of winning the American League... only for his father to pat his shoulder one last time, quietly apologizing before walking out of his life. As the movie is focused entirely on Roger's perspective, the only insight offered as to _why_ his father gave up custody is him remarking to the judge that he's not proud of it, leaving it open as to whether he was just selfish and didn't want to deal with raising a kid, or if he gave him up to give him a chance at a better life than he could provide.
-   In the _Apocalypse_ film series movie _Tribulation_, Tom Canboro's brother Calvin disavows any knowledge of their sister Eileen and has his family pictures photoshopped to remove any evidence of her, at the time of the Tribulation when Eileen was Caught Up in the Rapture and Calvin had taken the Mark of the Beast.
-   A common trope in Bollywood movies and _Baghban_ is no different. Raj disowns his four sons after the misery they put him and Pooja through. A bit of an Inversion with Alok, though. He is not biological, but the adopted son of Raj and Pooja. However, in the end, Raj sees him as his only son.

-   In the 2000s film version of _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_, this is used as part of Willy Wonka's backstory, which was made up just for this movie.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Wilbur, his father and a dentist, did not want his son to be a chocolatier, so Willy tells him that he will run away from home. Wilbur angrily responds, "I won't be here when you get back." Becomes an Exaggerated Trope when Willy returns to find _the entire house_ missing from the street. However, it turns out that he had saved every newspaper article about his son.
-   The Hong Kong film _Cold War 2012_. Deputy Commissioner Lee discovers his own son Constable Joe Lee — a talented police constable — is behind the conspiracy to abduct five Hong Kong police officers (to discredit Lee's rival for promotion, whom his son thinks is a desk man not suited to the job). Joe refuses to believe his father will arrest his only son, only for Lee to draw his pistol on him...then offer it butt first.

-   _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_: Barty Crouch Jr. is ratted out by Igor Karkaroff in the middle of the latter's trial, which he was observing. He tries to walk out before he can be arrested, but Karkaroff is too quick, and Mad-Eye Moody stuns him with a spell as he tries to run. He is dragged before his father, and eagerly (in a deranged way) greets him, but Crouch Sr. looks on him with shock and disappointment and dismisses him.

-   Famously done in the 1980 version of _The Jazz Singer_, with that very line delivered by Laurence Olivier in full-on Large Ham mode. Slightly more underplayed in the 1927 version, with the Trope Namer title card "My son was to stand at my side and sing tonight — but now I have no son."

-   Happens in any number of Bollywood films. _Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham_ is a good example that adds an extra twist since the disowned son is actually adopted and states that if his father had not specifically said "You're not my son", he may have actually tried to mend bridges sooner.
-   In _The Karate Kid Part II_, Chozen refuses to help Daniel rescue the bell ringer girl during a hurricane, and when his uncle Sato helps Daniel instead, Sato declares that he is "dead" to Chozen...thus setting up the final climactic battle between Chozen, Daniel, and uncle issues<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .

    Eight-pound baby boy I bounced on my knee  
    No, you ain't no son of mine"_

-   The Genesis song "No Son of Mine" is about an abused son and his abusive father. After having enough of the torment, the unnamed boy runs away.

The boy, still trapped in this abusive relationship, states he will live to regret being told these words.
    -   Also, band member Mike Rutherford's solo hit "The Living Years".
-   The lines of George Michael's "Praying For Time" implies this on a cosmic scale with God:

    Did you cover your eyes when they told you  
    That He can't come back  
    'cause He has no children to come back for?_

-   In the Book of Hosea, Hosea marries a prostitute who bears three children. Two of them God tells him to name "Lo-Ruhama" and "Lo-Ammi", which literally mean "not loved" and "not mine".
-   In The Four Gospels, Jesus treats His mother Mary and His relatives as if they weren't biologically related to each other, with Jesus Himself saying, "Whoever does the will of My Father in heaven, the same is My brother, My sister, and My mother," emphasizing the spiritual birth of becoming believers over the natural birth of fleshly beings. Not that Jesus treats His biological relatives with any ill-will, as on the cross before His death He does give His mother's care over to His disciple John, "the disciple that He loved".

    Pro Wrestling 

-   This is played with quite often in the WWE dynamic between The Undertaker, Kane, and Paul Bearer. As it turned out, Paul Bearer was Kane's biological father, but at various times, he favored either one. At WrestleMania XX, he told Kane before introducing an again-reanimated Undertaker, "You're no son of mine!"
-   Saraya Knight infamously did this to her daughter, Britani Knight, after the latter lost a match, and then slapped her.

    Theatre 

-   The two times his son William is inquired about in _1776_, Benjamin Franklin is dismissive about him — he first asks rhetorically "Son? What son?", and then later asks what happened to "the little bastard" after he is arrested. While Benjamin is one of the major Founding Fathers of the United States and a major driver behind the push for independence, William was the royal governor of New Jersey and very much in the Loyalist camp; William's arrest was by the Continental Army when independence was decided upon. The "bastard" quip is in both senses of the word, William being the product of an affair by the notoriously lusty Benjamin and their relationship forever strained by their different political allegiances.
-   In _Beyond the Horizon_, James says "You're no son o' mine" after Andrew rejects him and the farm, electing to go off to sea.
-   In _Fiddler on the Roof_, Tevye agonizes over his first two daughters willfully opposing tradition and marrying men they choose rather than ones chosen for them by the matchmaker. The first begged for permission to marry her childhood friend, which Tevye granted; the second married an itinerant tutor who had been teaching her, and they made clear that they would be marrying, permission or not, but would be grateful for his blessing. Tevye eventually came around on that one, too... but when his third daughter marries outside the faith, Tevye can't take it: "if I bend that far, I'll break!" Though it breaks his heart, he disowns her.
    -   In the original stories by Sholem Aleichem, Tevye can't ever bring himself to forgive her; in the musical, just at the end, Tevye bends just enough to at least _acknowledge_ her, and her husband, when the husband makes a valid point:
        
        **Fyedke**: Some are driven out by edicts. Others... by silence.
        
        -   Actually, the Chava of the original stories delivers a twist on the trope by being the one to fold, leaving her husband and reconciling with the family before emigrating with them to America.
-   In _The Gentleman Ranker_, Lieutenant Graylen was cashiered from the army after forging his father's signature on a bank draft. He rejoined as Private Smith and ended up under his father's command. When they recognized each other, Colonel Graylen said that his son was dead.
-   Played With in _The Importance of Being Earnest_: Cecily tells Jack his brother Ernest is in the dining room, and he replies "I haven't got a brother".

-   _In Abraham's Bosom_: Abe proclaims this after Douglass drops out of school and turns to a life of drinking and dissolution. ("He ain't no longer mine, and that's the end of it.")
-   The early 20th-century musical _The Jazz Singer_, (probably better known today as being the first talkie) featured this as the central plot: Jakie Rabinowitz wants to sing jazz in blackface and his rabbi father disapproves. No, not for the same reasons we would disapprove of this action today. Actually somewhat Based on a True Story, making this one Truth in Television.
-   At the end of _The Lion in Winter_, a despondent Henry II makes this remark about all of his sons' collective betrayals. Well, in the next line, he acknowledges that he had offspring; what he seems to be saying is "My children aren't real men" rather than "I have no children".
-   Oddly enough, averted in _The Merchant of Venice_: despite Shylock's anger at his daughter's marriage and conversion to Christianity, he never actually disowns her. Later in the play, he mentions her, saying "I have a daughter..." The Al Pacino film version changed the line to say "I _had_ a daughter", turning the film into a straight example. As a matter of fact, it's _Jessica_ who disowns Shylock: "I have a father, you, a daughter lost."
-   Subverted in _The Music Man_ when Harold Hill suggests that the Mayor order a fluglehorn on the grounds that his son would be a virtuoso. The Mayor almost falls for it before realizing (loudly) that he doesn't have a son.
-   Because they abandoned him in favour of seeking power over Thebes and only sought him out once he was useful to them, Oedipus curses his sons to kill each other in _Oedipus at Colonus_ shortly before he dies.
-   Played for laughs in _Ruddigore_, when the protagonist is afflicted with an ancient curse that obliges him to commit a serious crime every day. He tries to satisfy the letter of the curse without doing anything genuinely terrible, so one of his "crimes" is to disinherit his only son. There's just one small problem:
    
    **Roderic:** But you haven't got a son.  
    **Robin:** No — not yet. I disinherited him in advance, to save time. You see — by this arrangement — he'll be born ready disinherited.  
    **Roderic:** I see. But I don't think you can do that.  
    **Robin:** My good sir, if I can't disinherit my own unborn son, whose unborn son can I disinherit?
    
-   Parodied in Rossini's opera _Il Signor Bruschino_. When Bruschino senior looks at the young man who supposedly is Bruschino junior and claims "This isn't my son!" Gaudenzio assumes he's evoking this trope. Actually, he's just telling the truth – it isn't his son, but an imposter, the tenor lead Florville.
-   In _Spring's Awakening_ by Frank Wedekind, after Moritz flunks out of school and commits suicide his father says at Moritz's funeral that Moritz was "no son of mine."

    **Lucius:** In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.  
    **Titus:** Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine.
    
-   No literal disowning, but in _La Traviata_ Germont exclaims "Where is my son? I no longer see him," after Alfredo insults Violetta by throwing money at her. Alfredo immediately repents, and the two are later shown as reconciled. It's ambiguous whether Germont is evoking this trope or just calling out Alfredo for not acting like his normal self.

    Video Games

Nina was born with black wings - and any child with black wings is supposed to be put to death since they're prophesied to bring tragedy to Wyndia. The royal family covered up the truth and disowned her so at least she'd have a chance to live. Nina understandably has a complex about this, but doesn't blame her parents for it.

-   _Dyztopia: Post-Human RPG_: If the player chooses Detritus for the Romance Sho, Zazz calls into the show to publicly disown Detritus for siding with Akira's resistance, who disowns him in turn for being a tyrant.
-   If you played through the entire plot of _Fallout 4_ by destroying the Institute, but completely ignore Codsworth your robot butler from before the bombs, you can still find him and catch up with him. At that point, you can sadly inform Codsworth of your spouse's death, but when he asks about your son Shaun, you can dismissively respond with "Forget him!" This is because Shaun grew up to become the sociopathic amoral Director of the Institute while you were in cryogenic stasis. And you had to leave him to die when you destroyed the Institute.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Wild child Gau in _Final Fantasy VI_ was abandoned at birth by his father because the mother died during childbirth and he went mad from it.

A year later after the world is ruined, the party finds Gau's father and they go to great lengths to dress up Gau and teach him how to speak properly so that the reunion would be a happy one. However, the man is still insane and claims that he has no son, but briefly mentions that he once had a nightmare of the birth of a "demon child" that he abandoned.

Gau chooses not to tell him the truth but is happy that he was able to see him again.

        -   During the main scenario quest in Patch 5.55, Fourchenault Leveilleur, a powerful member of the Forum, the governing body of the isolationist nation of Sharlayan, arrives to Gridania to deliver a callous refusal from Sharlayan to intervene in the growing conflict between Eorzea and the Telophoroi. When his children, twins Alphinaud and Alisaie, protest the decision, a furious Fourchenault, perceiving the opposing as a sign of his children Going Native against Sharlayan's isolationist philosophy, disowns both of them in public. One can tell the twins do not take this well.

Ares angrily disowned him and left him to be raised by the Furies.
-   In _Guilty Gear_, since getting actual confirmation Dizzy is his daughter in _Xrd_, Sol has been very cautious in ever directly referring to her as such, he even tries to get a cheap rise out of Ky in their personal fight to end their rivalry, by the end of the same game, by claiming Ky married a monster which immediately enrages him; that said, Sol doesn’t dislike Dizzy in any way, since he has saved her once, it just seems Sol doesn't quite want to bond with her as a daughter, also this is entirely one-sided since Dizzy quickly goes to try to call Sol father once.
-   In _Injustice: Gods Among Us_, we find out that the Nightwing in the Regime universe is actually Damian Wayne and that, prior to the story, he _killed_ Dick Grayson.

-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Happens in the climax of _Pokémon Black and White_, when Ghetsis storms in and disowns N for allowing the player to defeat him, spoiling Ghetsis's plans to conquer Unova. Rather than saying, "I have no child", the line is "you are unworthy of the name Harmonia", but the effect is the same.
    -   And from _Pokémon Sun and Moon_, we have Lusamine, the president of the Aether Foundation, disowning her children (Lillie and Gladion) when it's revealed that she's the main antagonist of the story.

    -   Riff ends up being disowned after using a mechanical replica of himself (piloted by Bun-Bun and Kiki) as a stand-in at one of his mother's parties, resulting in his doppelganger behaving disgracefully, such as punching out one of the guests while trying to shake his hand. Considering that Riff can't stand his mother, he's actually somewhat glad but finds the circumstances to be quite humiliating.
-   _Walking in the Dark_: There is a heartstring-yanking one of these moments between Ben and his dad, just before a newly-turned Ben kills him.

    Web Original 

-   In _AsteroidQuest_, The Don Father Zozu chews out his treacherous biological son Maklata after the latter orchestrates a bank job against his brother and tries to have everyone involved (most of which are "family members") killed in the ensuing coverup attempt. Zozu then proceeds to disown Maklata and has him executed.
    
    **Father Zozu:** Now.... as I have said, I do not kill my sons. But in light of your recent actions, you are no longer any son of mine.
    
-   Tsar Alexander of _Malê Rising_ invoked this after his daughter, Anastasia, announced she will marry Prince Tewodros of the Ethiopian Empire. Of course, her finding out what her father did during the Great War also influenced the falling-out.
-   Played for Laughs in a certain edit for a promo image of the Hentai _Oide yo! Mizuryuu Kei Land_:
    
    **Child:** _(arrived at Bimbo Land with his mother)_ I can't come in the theme park, mommy?  
    **Woman:** No, sweetie. This theme park is just for mommies and daddies. It's okay, I'll be back in a little while.  
    **Child:** O-okay mommy...  
    _(after spending the day at Bimbo Land)_  
    **Woman:** _(clearly about to get it on with some blonde hunk)_ Son!? I don't have a son! Stuff like that is just soooo dumb! All I care about now is cock! ❤
    
-   Played for Horror by SCP-3344 which causes Site 24 Director Carter (and anyone with whom he interacts) to believe that his adult son Niklas, who is living in Site 24 and desperate to contact his family, does not exist and to be completely unable to perceive any evidence to the contrary.
-   Common in the _Whateley Universe_, where mutants are often disowned by their family. Of the main cast, Ayla gets this most literally, to the point that his mother actually refuses to believe that "that thing" used to be Trevor.

    Web Videos 

-   The College Humour video "Sexually Confused Ninja" invokes this trope when a swordsman named White Falcon is impaled by his rival, the Black Eagle. Falcon implores his son Lee to avenge him, at which point Lee starts pulling off his father's pants, believing "avenge" to be a verb for sucking his father's dick. Thankfully, White Falcon ends up subverting this trope via a Verbal Backspace while still calling his son an idiot.
    
    **White Falcon:** So from the clues and context, you deduced and readily embraced the notion that to avenge means to suck your own father, you idiot?!  
    **Lee:** Yes.  
    **White Falcon:** I have no son.  
    **Lee:** Father!  
    **White Falcon:** I have no _smart_ son.  
    **Lee:** OK.
    
-   In a Downer Ending in the SML Movie, _Bowser Junior's Cheeseburger_, Bowser does this to Junior.
-   A Tom Grossi Comedy video made in early 2021 about the Cincinnati Bengals depicts a fan of the team as childlike and innocently naive for rooting for a team with a history of playoff ineptness (at that point, they had lost eight consecutive playoff games dating back to 1990). A flashback in the video shows that his father, a Baltimore Ravens fan, disowned him for drawing a crude bengal tiger with crayons and saying "Kitty goes meow" as a rallying cry, which the now-grown-up Bengals fan uses to console himself after another terrible season. It became Hilarious in Hindsight as in the next season the Bengals suddenly became good beyond expectations, not only winning a playoff game but making it all the way to the Super Bowl.

    Western Animation 

-   Invoked in _The Amazing World of Gumball_ in "The Words", when Gumball is trying to get his adopted brother Darwin to realize how all his verbal abuse is hurting people. After simple insults don't work, Gumball resorts to this trope ("You, are not my brother. You are just a pet! Who grew legs!"), which sends Darwin through a wall—literally—and reduces him to tears until Gumball, having made his point, hurriedly takes it back.
-   _American Dad!_ had one episode with Stan and Francine getting roped into a situation with their gay neighbors Greg and Terry when the latter's father comes to visit who oblivious of his son homosexuality. When Stan drunkenly reveals this, Terry's father in a rather calm manner states he has no son. Even when presented in front of a stadium full of people, Terry's father refuses to take back his claim. Terry eventually says "Forget him" and gets on with his life with Greg.
-   Referenced in an episode of _Arthur_:
-   _Avatar_:
    -   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, Ozai clearly had no regard for his son Zuko, stating he was "Lucky to be born" and even burning his face when Zuko questioned his logic during a war meeting. Zuko at first tries to get his respect for most of the series. But in the end, Zuko realizes Ozai's a Jerkass, gives an absolutely awesome example of Calling the Old Man Out, and helps the main heroes in stopping him. After that point, Zuko would gladly welcome his father's demise, but he was content with Aang taking away Ozai's firebending.
    -   In the interquel comic _The Rift_, Toph gets this from Lao Beifong. Apparently this was his Plan B after the "kidnap her back with mercenaries" plan fell through.
    -   _The Legend of Korra_:
        -   When Asami confronts her father, Hiroshi, as he's gathering his tanks for a full scale attack on benders. Hiroshi lost his wife to firebenders and feels every bender is evil. Asami however has more sense and tries to get him to see reason that he's becoming no better then his wife's murderers. However he's far too gone to realize this and states that if Asami won't aid him, then she doesn't deserve the right to be his daughter.
        -   This is revisited in Book 4, when Asami visits him in prison. By this point, he HAS realized what a monster he had become, and is trying to make up for it. He does so in the Book 4/series finale, where he assists Team Avatar in confronting Kuvira's Colossus mech by finishing and piloting one of two machine prototypes. While they are successful, Hiroshi is killed in the process, but not before saving Asami's life and saying he loves her.
-   _Bob's Burgers_: Played for Laughs in "Broadcast Wagstaff School News" when Gene starts acting and dressing like his dad Bob. When Tina begins acting up, he declares "I have no daughter!" Linda tells him not to say this while Bob bluntly points out the truth in the statement.
-   _Clone High_ has this happen when Gandhi tells his foster father that he wants to be a trucker.
-   In the movie of _Curious George_, Mr. Bloomsbury says "Ted, I am so proud of you. You're like the son I never had." His son Junior says "Father, I'm your son, remember?" to which Bloomsbury replies "Yes, but I had you."
-   During a role-playing exercise on _Drawn Together_ where Xandir came out of the closet to his parents (played by Toot and Captain Hero), Toot (his father, for some reason) says "My son is dead!", tears her sleeve and recites the Kaddish, reflecting the tendency of this trope to be centered on Jews.
-   _DuckTales (2017)_:
    -   In the Season 1 finale, Magica mocks Lena for the latter continuing to call her "Aunt" even though Magica created Lena out of her own shadow. This would practically make her Lena's _mother_. Not that it matters to Magica one bit - in her words, Lena was _never_ family.
    -   Played for Laughs in "The Lost Harp of Mervana!" when Dewey shows off his "mermaid tail" to Della, who can't stomach _anything_ related to fish.
        
        **Della**: _(dry heaves)_ I have no family.
        
-   _Elena of Avalor_: Throughout the course of the series, Elena ends up doing this to both of her cousins:
    -   Elena's paternal cousin Cristobal shamelessly accepted Shuriki's gold in exchange for his loyalty, and after Shuriki was overthrown, was far from grateful. Once Shuriki found him again, he sold his family out to her and accepted her renewal of their deal, leading Elena to disown him, telling him he doesn't know the meaning of _familia_.
    -   Season 3 has Elena find out her cousin Esteban's past treachery in helping Shuriki invade Avalor all those years ago, which led to the deaths of both her parents. Despite how much Esteban regretted his betrayal since that moment, Elena can't forgive him, and tells him he is no longer familia. In the finale however, she finally forgives him and welcomes him back..
-   _Family Guy_ lampshades this by having Peter gradually admit that even if Chris isn't his son, he still has Stewie and Meg.
    
    -   Another episode revealed that this happened...to _Death himself_
        
        **Death**: You know, actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig. You know, I really wanted to be a wood nymph. But, man, the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: "I have no son. I have no son," and Mom...Mom just stood there.
        
    -   Parodied when the Griffins visit an Italian street festival, and Peter tries an attraction called "Teach An Old Italian Woman How to Use an iPad", which quickly devolves into the two arguing about a dead older brother that Peter insists was corrupt (despite not being related to the woman or ever having met her before), and finally ends with him insulting her.
    
    **Woman**: I guess I don't have any sons now! _(storms off)_  
    **Peter**: Ma! I'm sorry, ma! MA!! _(falls to his knees)_
    
-   _Gargoyles_:
    -   When Angela tells Demona that she is Demona's biological daughter, Demona responds with "I have no daughter!" In this case, though, it's not based on disapproval—Demona honestly did not realize her child (last seen as an egg with people she considered her enemies) was still alive. When she realizes the truth, the only thing keeping her and Angela from bonding is Demona's genocidal hatred of the human race.
    -   In another episode, Elisa is arrested on the island of New Olympus for being human. While being escorted to her cell, an elderly minotaur calls out for the guard to have mercy on his old father. "You put your own father in prison?" "That's not my father." The audience thinks it's a generation-inversion of this, but it's almost immediately revealed that this is the shapeshifter who murdered the guard's father attempting to pull a Shapeshifter Guilt Trip.
-   A key element of Stan Pines' backstory in _Gravity Falls_: after accidentally ruining his brother Ford's science project and wrecking his dream college enrollment, he is disowned by his family and kicked out of the house. At the end of the same episode, Stan and Ford pull this on each other, thirty years after the initial breakdown of their relationship: Ford is angry that Stan risked a possible End of the World as We Know It scenario by saving him from the portal; Stan is angry that Ford isn't interested in thanking him for the thirty years he sacrificed to save him, and even angrier when he discovers that Ford wants him out of the Mystery Shack. For good measure, he says that Dipper and Mabel are the only family he has left. By the finale, they do patch things up, especially when Stan nearly sacrifices his memory to defeat Bill, _finally_ making Ford realize how foolish he's been.
-   _Jem_:
    -   Riot's father literally said "I have no son." when he disowned him in the episode "Riot's Hope". His father disapproved of Riot being into music - insisting only "sissies and women" were musicians - and Riot joined the army due to his dad. He eventually informally quit and joined a band. When he came home after being dishonorably discharged his father disowned him. They rekindle their relationship later after Riot's mother's health deteriorates due to stress related to them fighting.
    -   Pizzazz's father disowns her partway through the series because he's fed up with the trouble and money he costs her.
-   _Jimmy Two-Shoes_: They never really had anything that could truly be called a father-son bond, but in the Season 2 episode "You Can't Keep a Heinous Down", Lucius finally tells Beezy "You're no son of mine" after Beezy sells off the entirety of Lucius' fortune to the rest of Miseryville.
-   _Kaeloo_:
    -   Played for Laughs with the Alpha Bitch Pretty, who keeps threatening to disown her twin sister Eugly if she doesn't do what she says. For example, in Episode 131, Pretty is in a bad mood and refuses to allow Eugly to be happy because she herself isn't. Kaeloo asks them to smile for a picture, and Pretty says that if Eugly smiles, she will no longer accept her as her sister.
    -   Played for Laughs again in Episode 209. Stumpy is forced to spend a day babysitting his annoying little sister, Nombril, who likes to spend her time following Stumpy around and trying to get his attention. When Kaeloo asks about it, Stumpy insists that he "has no sister" and spends most of the episode pretending he doesn't know who Nombril is.
-   _King of the Hill_ Played This For Laughs in one episode between Kahn and Kahn Jr.--aka "Connie," his daughter. He said she wouldn't be his "son" anymore if she didn't go through with You Go, Girl!\-style wrestling match against her best friend. (As you can probably tell, he wanted a boy. The wrestling thing was her idea, though.)
-   Parodied in a dream sequence in _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_. Apple Bloom had a nightmare of her apple farmer family shunning her for not getting an apple-related Cutie Mark.
    -   Played tragically straight in "The Perfect Pear", when the secret wedding of Pear Butter and Bright Mac (the parents of the Apple Siblings) is discovered by bitter rivals Grand Pear and Granny Smith. The former forces his daughter to choose which family she wants to be a part of, and when she declares the Apples as her new family, Grand Pear angrily disowns her before leaving for Vanhoover, only to be comforted by Granny Smith, who immediately drops her bigotry and accepts Pear Butter as one of her own. It wouldn't be until years later until Grand Pear finally came around when visiting Ponyville and seeing his grandkids for the first time. Of course by then, Pear and Bright have...passed on. Something he does regret but doesn't want to make the same mistake with her daughter's family, even finally making peace with Granny Smith.
-   Said word-for-word by the recently Came Back Wrong Lord Garmadon to his son Lloyd in the _Ninjago_ episode "True Potential" when Lloyd tries and fails to find the good in him.
-   This trope is one of the main reasons Dr. Doofenshmirtz from _Phineas and Ferb_ grew up to be a villain. The worst part was he didn't really deserve it. His parents were so ridiculously negligent, they were never around for any of his birthdays, _even the day he was actually born_. He was completely ignored when he failed to jump off a high dive at the city pool (which was considered a rite of passage). Heck, his father even named the family dog "Only Son"! While his mom preferred his more successful brother Roger.
-   One episode of _Pinky and the Brain_ has Brain giving this treatment to a clone who has decided that he doesn't want to take over the world — "I have no clone."
-   _Rocko's Modern Life_:
    -   Ralph Bighead's decision to become a cartoonist results in his being disowned by his father, and he isn't particularly interested in reconciling. It requires intervention by Rocko and friends to restore the family relationship. The title of the episode is "I Have No Son!", and Ed Bighead even says it word-for-word a couple of times, while Ralph says "I have no father."
    -   In the _Static Cling_ special, Ed says that he has no daughter after seeing that Ralph is now a woman named Rachel.
    -   In "Who's For Dinner?", Heffer runs away from his surrogate family, the Wolfes, and looks for his real parents after he finds out he's adopted. He eventually meets the spirit of his real (living) father, who reveals that he disowned him because he found him ugly, just like his real brothers and sisters. After meeting his real father's spirit, Heffer comes to accept the Wolfes as his real family.
-   _The Simpsons_
    -   In "Like Father, Like Clown", as a parody specifically of the scene in _The Jazz Singer_:
        
        **Lisa:** Excuse us. Rabbi Krustofski?  
        **Rabbi Krustofski:** Oh, what can I do for you, my young friends?  
        **Bart:** We came to talk to you about your son.  
        **Krustofski:** _**I have no son!**_ _(slams the door)_  
        **Bart:** Oh, great. We came all this way and it's the wrong guy.  
        **Krustofski:** _(opens door)_ I didn't mean that literally! _(slams door again)_
        
    -   Parodied again in "The Principal and the Pauper", when Agnes Skinner learns that the real Seymour Skinner was imprisoned in Vietnam and the man she has raised as her son is an impostor; her dramatic declaration that she has no son is somewhat undercut by Homer rather acerbically pointing out that she obviously has at least _one_ son. She responds by saying "No, I have one stranger, and one fraud!"
    -   Parodied in another episode when Patty declares that if Marge doesn't come to her gay wedding then "I have no non-identical sister!"
    -   Played relatively straight in "Old Money" when Abe blames Homer for dragging him away on his girlfriend's birthday and causing her death by broken heart. He even says the trope word-for-word:
        
        **Abe:** You made me miss the last precious moments of Bea's life! I'll never speak to you again! _I HAVE NO SOOOOOON!_
        
    -   Parodied in yet another episode when the Squeaky-Voiced Teen working at the Bowling Alley says that he can't even give a lane to his own mother on League night. Lunchlady Doris walks past and says, "I have no son!"
    -   Played seriously with Homer's long-lost half-brother Herbert, who lets Homer design a car that will make or break his company, assuming Homer knows what The Everyman wants. Homer botches it, leading Herb to tell him rather venomously, "As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother." They patch things up in a later episode, after which Herb is never seen again.
    -   Inverted in the episode "MoneyBART", as Bart is running the bases on his Little League game.
        
        **Homer:** If he makes it, that's my son!
        
    -   Played straight and then subverted in "Burns, Baby Burns" when Mr. Burns finds out he has a son, Larry. At first, Larry proves an embarrassment to Burns (who calls him a "a coarse, boorish ignoramus") and he says this Trope almost word for word. He changes his mind quickly after Larry is kidnapped (actually, Homer and Larry stage a kidnapping, hoping it will help them reconcile) saying angrily that "nobody takes what's mine, whether it's my newspaper or my good-for-nothing son!"
    -   In "Old Yeller-Belly," Homer gets annoyed by Santa Little Helper's cowardice and tells Kent Brockman "I have no dog!" in a manner parodying this trope. This comes back to bite him in the ass later when the dog's former owner comes to take him back and uses the interview to prove that he's no longer Homer's.
    -   While Marge doesn't officially disown Bart nor kick him out of the house, she becomes so disappointed in him that she becomes distant.
        -   In "Bart the Mother," when Bart accidentally shoots a bird and Marge finds out, what she tells him in response is pretty much this trope.
            
            **Marge:** What's the point, Bart? I punish, and I punish, and I punish, but it never sinks in. So you know what? Do what you want. You wanna play with little hoodlums, fine. Have fun killing things.
            
        -   Played Straight in Marge "Love Is a Many-Splintered Thing" for siding with his father during an argument about women and love.
        -   Marge gives up on Bart again in "Peeping Mom" when her attempts get him to confess his plans involving a bulldozer fail and he becomes too stubborn to insufferable levels.
            
            **Marge:** You're in charge of yourself. Get home whenever. My parenting stops now. (prepares to leave, but then stops to wipe mud off his face) Okay, now.
            
-   Parodied on _South Park_ as part of the parents' hysterical, intense reaction to the news that the boys have been smoking. Stan tries to bring Randy back to earth, but as soon as he calls him "dad," Randy shouts, "I DON'T HAVE A SON!"
    -   _South Park: The Streaming Wars_: Downplayed. While Liane still plans to raise her son Eric, she is resentful that he made her quit her job, causing them to lose their house and move into a hotdog house, and refuses to let him blame her for the loss of their house. When Eric comes up with a plan for them to move in with a rich old guy by Liane seducing him and need her to get breast implants, Liane refuses, pointing out that they don't have the money for breast implants. And when Eric got the money for the breast implants, Liane outright refused to get them, saying that when Eric made her quit her job, she promised herself that she would never give in to him ever again. Liane refuses to give in, even when Eric threatens to either call the police or runway, telling her son she is done with this. And when Eric said that he himself would take the breast implants, while shocked, Liane called his bluff and was annoyed and disappointed when Eric actually took the breast implants. When Eric asks Liana what she will do now that she knows he is serious about his threats, Liane tells Eric that she plans to go grocery shopping. Liane leaves as Eric threatens to go to school with his breast implants. It is implied that while Liane will not abandon her son Eric and will support him financially until he becomes an adult, she has given up on having a relationship with him and closed off emotionally from him.
-   Near the third season of _Star Trek: Lower Decks_, Captain Freeman and Ensign Mariner have always had a contentious relationship due to Mariner's Military Maverick ways (which have resulted in her _needing_ to be on her mother's ship because any other captain would probably court-martial her sooner rather than later). They work on their relationship over the course of three seasons, but when Mariner gives an unauthorized interview to a Federation reporter everyone assumes she's the source of all the embarrassing stories the reporter is now asking about. Captain Freeman says that not only is she transferring Mariner to the worst posting in Starfleet, she's not even sure if she can call Mariner her _daughter_ anymore. Even her Number Two, who had reported Mariner, is shocked, to say nothing of how gutted Mariner herself is. Especially since Mariner didn't betray them at _all_. Her description of life on the _Cerritos_ was glowing. Meanwhile, all the officers Freeman had hand-picked to be "credible" casually dropped those embarrassing tidbits during their interviews. By the time Freeman learns this and tries to get Mariner back, however, Mariner's already resigned her commission.
-   Played for Laughs in _Steven Universe_. In "Giant Woman", Steven finds a goat who he named Steven Jr. and adopts as his "son". When the goat tries to steal the Heaven Beetle from him, he bitterly yells "You're no son of mine!"
-   Darkseid pulls this in _Superman: The Animated Series_ after sending his son Kalibak to a slave pit with his Omega beams. His exact words in response to Desaad saying that Kalibak was his son, "A technicality regarding his birth. As far as my destiny lies, I have no son." (This may or may not have been a subtle reference to Orion, another of his sons and one of his worst enemies. Ironically, when Orion appears several episodes later, Darkseid openly acknowledges him as his son and takes pride in Orion's boldness and ferocity. To add insult, he says this in the presence of Kalibak.)
-   _Voltron: Legendary Defender_: Not only does Zarkon disown Lotor, but he also orders his entire empire to kill Lotor on sight.
-   In the Hanna-Barbera TV special "The Little Troll Prince," Ulvik, the King of the Trolls, disowns his son Prince Bu once the latter professes his faith in Christ (thus committing blasphemy against the troll code) and (unwittingly) sheds his troll like appearance in front of him, and then strips him of his royal title, leaving him to the mercy of a hostile crowd. Afterwards, he's shown to be visibly upset that he lost his favorite son, and when his wife Serena fears that Bu would lead humans to their kingdom for revenge, he assures her that Bu is not a traitor and he will not cause them any trouble. He tells her to let him go as "it's all over."
-   When reunited with her father in _Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?_ in "Can You Ever Go Home Again?", Carmen's dad has a less-than-pleasant reaction. He refuses to believe that the toddler he thought died in an accident survived and grew up into a _thief_.
-   _Zeroman_: Rusty Woodenwater's mother renounced him as her son when he got booed off his own show.
-   While not imminently evident, _The Dragon Prince_ gives us Rayla, who nearly doomed her first assassination mission when the egg was revealed to be alive. Ranaan, the leader of the mission and later revealed to be Rayla's own foster father, says he will kill her for this and indeed draws his weapon against her. Subverted somewhat, as Word of God claims that Ranaan wouldn't have been able to kill Rayla if it came to it and would have probably settled for disarming her. Muddied a little with Ranaan's husband, Ethari, who has joined their village in their shared shunning of Rayla and blames her for Ranaan's apparent death, but he's also clearly heartbroken over it and momentarily breaks the spell to speak to her one last time.
