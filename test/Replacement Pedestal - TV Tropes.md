Somebody is devastated as their hero is not who they thought they were. Rather than being the great warrior that they looked up to, they turned out to be selfish and rude. Of course, this causes them to become a Broken Pedestal.

But what's this? The person found somebody who actually displays all of the traits they admired of their former hero. Well, now this person is who they admire instead.

A lot of people have role models, but it becomes hard when they find out their role models are not who they are, so they turn to a new one in their place.

Alternatively, they find out their replacement role model is the real hero of the story that their former hero was a part of, which gets them to desire the truth to be known so that the proper pedestal is put in place.

Compare Replacement Goldfish. Contrast Rebuilt Pedestal, when the character starts looking up to their former hero again. Some versions might play with this and Rebuilt Pedestal by having one pedestal rebuilt just as another is dashed. Compare Opposed Mentors, which is where a character is choosing between two very different pedestals.

Might overlap with Hourglass Plot. May also overlap with A True Hero if the change in heroes is accompanied by an Aesop about what a real hero is like.

-   _Warhammer 40,000_: In an extremely negative version of this trope, Lorgar of the Word Bearers legion only ever sought to uplift humanity through belief in the divine.

Unfortunately, this clashed with the Emperor's desire for a completely secular Imperium and he not only rejected Lorgar's attempts, he also had the Ultramarines burn the Word Bearers' capital city to the ground and forced them to kneel in the ashes and ruins while he chastised him. Tragically for _everyone_, Lorgar then found new gods to worship: the four Chaos Gods who welcomed his worship. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

When Dash saves her, it reaffirms her hero worship.
