_"Detective Hammer Logan III woke with a start, images of the bizarre bayou murder still fresh in his mind's eye — a dame in trouble, body covered with bloody toothprints and saliva—but as sleep lifted, the grizzled detective remembered that he was a dog and the dame a coyote, so he spun on the bed three times and slept the rest of the day."_

He may be the Funny Animal, the Intellectual Animal, or maybe even the Speech-Impaired Animal, but if there's one thing that he's incredibly good at, it's solving any kind of mystery that comes his way. He can be either a Hardboiled Detective, an Inspector Oblivious, or a Defective Detective. Whether he does it on his own, or with a friend, or with a group of humans, expect him to help solve the case with ease. This character may or may not work in a World of Funny Animals. Very often, these characters are dogs of some description.
