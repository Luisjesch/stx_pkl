_"If you believe in yourself, eat all your school, stay in milk, drink your teeth, don't do sleep, and get 8 hours of drugs, you can get work!"_

Stock Aesops are the morals that the writers and producers of TV most often love to explore. They sometimes contradict each other, but it's a clumsy writer indeed who sticks two contradictory aesops into the same script, which can either prove them both to be good advice or create a Broken Aesop. When An Aesop contradicts the typical beliefs of society, offends the Moral Guardians, or promotes an "unconventional" belief, it's a Hard Truth Aesop.

Because times change, some older Aesops tend to be seen as Fair For Their Day or Values Dissonance.

On the other hand, if they're treated as profound moral insights, they risk being seen as a Captain Obvious Aesop to the audience.

Many are Older Than Feudalism. And some, indeed, come straight from the original Aesop's Fables.
