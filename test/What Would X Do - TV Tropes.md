_"Sir, look outside, do you see that man sitting in the green car? That's my dad. Let me tell you a story about a dream, a boy's dream: A man promised to buy his son a car if I brought up three A's and two thousand dollars. I already have the two thousand and two A's. Your B minus? Poof! Dream gone. Kaput. Now sir, ask yourself... what would Jesus do?"_

When a character quotes someone's advice or asks what that person would do in a situation similar to theirs. That someone can be a religious figure of choice, mentors, someone known to be especially suited for such a situation, or even simply someone they idolize in general. Some characters have a tendency to do this all the time, as much as Once an Episode. (The Lancer sometimes describes The Hero in this manner when he finally gets a shot with The Leader ball.)

Because of the "What Would Jesus Do?" material in Christian homes, and other serious uses of the idea, this is an Undead Horse Trope. Opposite of Hitler Ate Sugar, when someone argues (fallaciously) that anything an evil person does is considered evil.

The Paragon, Mentor Archetype, Old Master, Ideal Hero, and anybody on the Mentor Index could potentially be the X in the equation. Of course, depending on how good a person is at judging character and what kind of values they have, theoretically anyone could be the object of imitation. It's the Sincerest Form of Flattery, after all.

Even an Anti-Role Model could be invoked, in a bit of an inversion— "What would that guy do? Go do the _opposite_ of that!"

Compare Jesus Was Way Cool and Real Men Love Jesus for people who specifically admire the Man himself. See also Don't Do Anything I Wouldn't Do (a Stock Phrase that means you should behave yourself by following someone else's restraints) and You Remind Me of X.

-   There's a throwaway line like this in _Power Rangers Operation Overdrive_ for the series' 15th anniversary Reunion Show, when Alpha Six wonders "What would Zordon do?!" (The answer is "Observe the viewing globe and let the Rangers figure it out," of course, but the whole reason Alpha is there is because the Rangers are absolutely useless in this situation.)
-   _The Professionals_ has a variation on the trope. In "Involvement", Doyle has fallen in love with the Girl of the Week and is upset when she falls under suspicion of being connected to the drug ring they're investigating. Cowley admits the evidence is circumstantial but asks: "What would _you_ do?" as in: "Would you cease to investigate this under normal circumstances?"
-   In one episode of _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_, Salem got cat-napped by a little kid who wanted a pet. A couple of scenes later, Salem is trying to figure out how to get back home.
-   This is a core concept of _Samurai Gourmet_. In his retirement, Takeshi Kasumi is determined not only to enjoy himself but also to be more assertive in doing so (in accordance with his new social status as "the elder", though he doesn't put it that way). Whenever social stickiness gets in the way of this, there occurs an Indulgent Fantasy Segue where a Sengoku ronin demonstrates how _he_ would handle the situation. This is sometimes preceded by the explicit question, "What would a samurai do?" Usually, the answer is not violence, but just being really, really cool.
-   The _Sense8_ episode "W.W.N.Double.D.?", which stands for "What Would Nancy Drew Do?" Said by Amanita to Nomi as they try to outsmart their pursuers.
-   One episode of _Stargate Atlantis_ has John Sheppard ask himself "What would McKay do?"
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
        -   In the episode, "Pen Pals", Captain Picard places Wesley in charge of a routine geological survey as an educational experience for him. At one point, when Wesley's confidence in his ability to lead is down, Riker advises him, "In your position, it's important to ask yourself one question: What would Picard do?"
        -   And then subverted in "The Best of Both Worlds". After Picard is captured and assimilated by the Borg, Riker is placed in command. One of the first things he does is walk into the now-his Ready Room, look at the chair and ask "What would you do?" Then walks in Guinan and tells Riker that he has to think for himself now, as the Borg now know all of Picard's tricks.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_
        -   A variant in "Course: Oblivion", when the biomimetic _Voyager_ which is in the process of melting back into "silver blood" comes into contact with the real _Voyager_ and the ship couldn't drop out of warp, the biomimetic Harry Kim orders Seven of Nine to dump the warp core. When Seven warns that dumping it while still traveling at warp would tear the ship apart, Harry tries to reason with Seven by saying, "What would Captain Janeway have done?"
        -   Another variant in "Tuvix". A transporter accident merges Neelix and Tuvok into the title character Tuvix. When the crew comes up with a means of seperating him however, Tuvix objects because this would mean effectively killing him. Janeway asks Tuvix to consider what Tuvok or Neelix would do. Tuvix agrees they would sacrifice their own lives, but even if his decision seems cowardly, Tuvix says he has as much right to live as anyone else.
    -   _Star Trek: Enterprise_: Harshly deconstructed in the episode "Cogenitor" when Trip Tucker sticks his nose into an alien culture to correct what he sees as a monstrous injustice on their part. When he gets in trouble, he claims that he did exactly what Captain Archer would've done — which ends up further enraging his already-furious captain.
        
        **Archer:** I might have expected something like this from a first-year recruit. But not you. You did exactly what I'd do? If that's true, then I've done a pretty lousy job setting an example around here. You're a senior officer on this ship. You're privy to the moral challenges I've had to face. You know I've wrestled with the fine line between doing what I think is right and interfering with other species. So don't tell me you know what I would have done when _I_ don't even know what I would have done!
        
-   _Suits_ frequently features Mike asking "what would Harvey do?"
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   In "Devil May Care" (S09, Ep02), Dean asks, "What would Sam Winchester do?"
    -   After Donatello becomes The Soulless, he states that he keeps his moral compass by asking, "What would Mr. Rogers do?"
-   _Vikings_: Cloud Cuckoo Lander Floki advises Björn on overcoming heartbreak.
    
    **Floki:** Just ask yourself, "What would Floki do?" That will make you laugh, and then you're already half cured.
    
-   _Weeds_: "What would Vic Mackey do?"
-   In the final episode of _The West Wing_ outgoing Chief of Staff CJ gives her successor in the new administration, Josh, a post-it note with "WWLD?" on it: "What Would Leo Do?"

    Music 

-   Alan Jackson's song "It's Five O'Clock Somewhere". The X here is Jimmy Buffett, who then joins in to sing the next refrain.
    
    **Buffett**: Funny you should ask, Al. I'd say, 'Pour me something tall and strong ...'
    
-   Bruce Robison's song "What Would Willie Do" is both a parody of WWJD and a tribute to Willie Nelson. ("He loves all the people, no matter their races / Hell, he even made a hit country song with Julio Iglesias")
-   Cult satire punk band The Causey Way with their album _WWCD_. The C here stands for Causey.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Common in lay religion. Protestant Christians ask themselves what Jesus would do, Catholics ask themselves what Jesus or the appropriate saint would do, Buddhists ask themselves what Buddha or the appropriate Boddhisatva would do, and so on.
    -   Although it was pointed out by Catholic apologist Jimmy Akin that the inverse question ("Would you want to do X in Jesus' presence?") is slightly irrelevant, as most devout Christians would want to do nothing other than fall on their knees and pray in Jesus's presence.
    -   The inverse question is also a bit of a moot point, as according to most orthodox Christian doctrine you're _always_ in Jesus's presence. That's how omniscience and omnipresence work. Feel free to either rejoice or shudder at the implications according to your preference.
-   In Pastafarianism there's "What Would the Flying Spaghetti Monster Do" (and the less common "What Would a Pirate Do").

    Video Games 

-   In _Final Fantasy Tactics_, Ramza, after killing some deserters who, while not necessarily evil, are intending to collect the bounty on his head and use it to gain a pardon, wonders what his father would have done in that situation.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   _Mass Effect 2_ has both Tali and Garrus drawing heavily on their experiences with Shepard, using his/her example to guide themselves in life during the two years that (s)he's dead. Incidentally, by following Shepard's example, Tali decides to blow stuff up, and Garrus builds a team of experts and starts shooting bad guys on his own. Shepard taught them well.
    -   And in _Mass Effect 3_ you get several more like this: Jack, Tali (again), Garrus (also again), Jacob, and Kaidan/Ashley. To be more precise, anyone still alive from the first two games, if they weren't already leaders or important, has become a leader/important, because _that's what Shepard would do._ And because Krogan have to do it bigger than the other races, Grunt takes his cues from both Shepard and Urdnot Wrex (himself having taken Shepard's example to heart and begun trying to save his race).
-   X-23 in _Marvel vs. Capcom 3_ would say this when activating her X-Factor:
    
    **X-23:** What would Wolvie do?
    
-   _Not for Broadcast_: If you let Jeremy Donaldson die in Day 296, then at the end of Day 371, after Advance nuke four cities and demand that the world bend to their will, Megan Wolfe spends the last few minutes pondering on what Jeremy would do if he were alive today in a situation like this.
-   _Persona 5_: When the Protagonist has to turn himself in so that the villainous politician driving The Conspiracy can be found guilty, the other Thieves imagine Morgana (who they believed to have disappeared with the other world) making fun of them for giving up too easily. This encourages them to find a way to save the Protagonist.
-   In _Poker Night 2_, Sam might ask himself what Max would do when planning his next move.
    
    **Sam**: What would Max do in a situation like this?  
    _(Sam looks over to see that Max is standing on a table, spinning in place)_  
    **Max**: AAAH! _Blackhawk Down!_ Blackhawk Down!  
    **Sam**: ...Okay, time for Plan B.
    
-   _Wolfenstein: The New Order_: Provided he survived the Prologue Wyatt at one point will admit at times he would ask himself what William Joseph Blazkowicz would do during those fourteen years spent keeping the The Resistance going. He still does.
-   In _World of Warcraft_, after the Battle for the Undercity, with the Horde facing war with the Alliance, Thrall wonders what his old friend Grom Hellscream would do in that situation. Varok Saurfang, who had recently lost his son, approaches Thrall and tells him that Grom would tell him to lead his people, giving him some small measure of relief.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_, Edgeworth is able to put the final pieces of the puzzle in the last case together by thinking to himself (paraphrased) 'That man who could turn around victories from the brink of defeat...what would he do?' This makes him realize that he needs to "turn around" his thinking, and thus that the blood on the Samurai Dogs pack might not be from the victim, but that it could be — and is — from the murderer.
-   In _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_, some time after the second murder, the victim's best friend refuses to forgive the person who, despite not being the killer, helped cause the murder. In response, the person in question attempts Seppuku and is taken away for medical treatment. Afterward, a third party asks the victim's best friend what the victim would do in that situation.

    Web Animation 

-   _DucktaleZ_ has an extra cartoon after the first episode in which the Author Avatar acts as a director and does auditions to find someone to play the role of Scrooge McDuck. After none of the candidates work out, his assistant asks "What would George Lucas do?" This gives him the idea of doind a computer-generated Scrooge (who somehow becomes an actual person) for the Oscars.
-   _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_ shows us Rogal Dorn's pain-love meditation room which has a W.W.T.E.O.M.D? (What Would the Emperor of Mankind Do?) poster on the wall.
-   _Minilife TV_: In "Chris and Ian Shamelessly Promote Themselves", when Conan asks Zach (disguised as Ian) to play the trumpet for the show, Zach asks himself what Ian would do. Ian tells him to go for it in his mind, which doesn't pay off since Zach is bad at playing the trumpet.

    Web Comics 

-   _Darths & Droids:_
    -   Somewhere between a serious and not-serious example, as Grievous's dreadnought is about to crash, Pete encourages Ben and Annie to think like Jim, on the grounds that a lunatic plan in the face of certain death is when Jim shines.

        **Pete:** That's the spirit!

    -   The whole running gag finally hits its climax towards the end of the book:

    Web Original 

-   In _Worm_, at one particularly critical juncture in Interlude 26b the superhero Golem asks himself what Weaver does, though in this case its because her tactics are similar to those of the enemy he's fighting, and it gives him an insight into what Jack's second power is.

    Web Videos 

-   _Crossed Lines_: In Episode 7, Rebel Iron, the Railway Board comes to Dawn asking her about strange behaviour they've been noticing on the railway (which pertains to Zebedee's rescue mission of Ember).

    -   In "The Saddle Row Review", the other members of the Mane Six keep asking themselves "What would Rarity do?" when trying to help set up the grand opening of Rarity's new boutique. It keeps going badly until Twilight Sparkle realizes that what Rarity would really want is for each of her friends to use their own judgment.

-   _The Owl House_ has two rather heavy examples.
    -   In "Young Blood, Old Souls", Lilith reveals that the reason decided to curse Eda before their fight to join the Emperor's Coven (opperating under the assumption that it would merely De-power her for a day rather than saddle her with a life changing disability) was because she asked herself what Emperor Belos would do in her situation.
    -   In "Clouds on the Horizon", Amity is despairing over her feelings of helplessness over the impending Day of Unity and Emira attempts to cheer her up by asking her what she thinks Luz would say to her.

    Real Life 

-   Common in Moral Philosophy. Many thought-experiments are based on some variant of "What would The Omniscient do?" or "What would a totally impartial person choose?"
-   There is a legal concept called a "reasonable person". The question "what would a reasonable person have done/felt/thought in such a situation?" can be used to analyze whether a defendant's actions were justified, whether mitigating circumstances can apply, whether someone acted recklessly or not, and so on.
-   Probably common way of analyzing various conundrums among anyone with a bit of imagination. Pick your favorite idol or fictional character and ask yourself what she would do. The problem there, of course, is "What if your favorite character is The Joker or The Master or someone?"
-   There was a canonical movement involving bracelets with the shield, inviting teenagers to ask "What would Superman do?"
-   Many alleged journalists covering Apple claim that whatever the company is doing is not what Steve Jobs would have done. This is especially baseless because Steve Jobs not only groomed his successors specifically for their current positions but also specifically instructed them not to waste time wondering what he would do.
    -   Part of this is to specifically avoid the problems that Disney had after Walt Disney's death. His successors got caught in the trap of 'What Would Walt Do?' and the company stagnated for almost 20 years. It was on the verge of being bought and broken up for parts when Michael Eisner, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Frank Wells were brought in to lead the company, bringing about the Disney Renaissance.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Lagoon_ has a conversation between Revy and Eda about what gun Jesus would use "as he walked through the valley of the shadow of death".
    
    **Eda:** Alright, the Good Shepherd. What's his weapon of choice?  
    **Revy:** Huh?  
    **Eda:** Psalm 23 verse 4, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death." But what I wanna know is, what would you take with you, you know, if you were him.  
    **Revy:** Hmm, I'd say a Jericho, 941 FBL.  
    **Eda:** That's a pretty limp-dick gun for _Jesus_...  
    **Revy:** You're the nun. What's your fuckin' answer?  
    **Eda:** _\[holding up her Glock 17L by its holster\]_ Isn't it obvious? This guy here.  
    **Revy:** You're full of shit. I mean he was Jewish, right? Of course he'd have an Israeli-made gun.  
    **Eda:** Goddamn heathen. You're out of your league when it comes to this shit.
    
-   In _Bleach_ there's a point where Kenpachi is in trouble fighting Tōsen, who has trapped Kenpachi in a dark space that disables all senses except the feeling of pain, thus preventing Kenpachi from effectively fighting back. He tries to imagine what his three main minions would do in this situation:
    
    **Yachiru's advice:** Cut with your instinct!  
    **Kenpachi:** I tried that already.  
    **Ikkaku's advice:** You could try that "see with your mind's eye"-thing.  
    **Kenpachi:** If I could do something like that, I wouldn't need you to tell me about it, stupid!  
    **Yumichika's advice:** If it was me, I'd probably... give up... in a beautiful way!  
    **Kenpachi:** Go die.
    

    Comedy 

-   Inverted by Mitch Benn in one show, where he describes how, after a gig, he was in the Bathroom Stall of Overheard Insults, and overheard two audience members saying he "really wants to be Jack Black". And the only thing that stopped him bursting out of the cubicle, trousers around his ankles, and saying "I was doing this for ten fucking years before anyone had _heard_ of Jack fucking Black!" was the thought that this was _exactly_ what Jack Black would do.

    Comic Books 

-   An issue of _MAD Magazine_ that was dedicated to riffing on _Family Guy_ for "being the most original cartoon on television" and featuring them drawn in the style of _The Simpsons_, showed that the studio where Family Guy is written has "What would Bart do?" signs prominently displayed everywhere.
-   From issue #1 of the _Roger Rabbit_ comic book, when Roger thinks his new neighbor, who's a weasel, is out to get him:

    **Roger:** ...And then he'd have another cuppa coffee and look at the sports page again! Gosh, Eddie's brave—
    
-   Subverted in _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_. When they end up in the fake Afterspark, Rodimus has a bit of a Heroic BSoD. Whirl snaps him out of it by asking "What Would Megatron Do?" - not because either of them seriously cares what Megatron would do, but because Megatron is something of a Berserk Button for Rodimus, and as such, Whirl knows that mentioning him is going to get Rodimus off his exhaust port and actually doing something. Sure enough, within a page, Rodders is rudely demanding to see the Afterspark's manager.
-   While it's debatable whether he was being serious or not, The Question once asked himself, "What would Rorschach do?" (Kill anyone who annoyed him, duh.) There _is_ an issue where the Question decides to take the Rorschach approach to crime fighting. He concludes that the Rorschach approach _sucks_.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Dilbert_, Dogbert advises Ratbert to live by the philosophy "What would Dogbert do?"
-   _Footrot Flats_:
    -   In a couple of strips, the Dog is trying to take care of the farm while Wal is away and whenever something goes wrong he asks himself what Wal would do.
        
        **The Dog:** Oh no! A weta snatched a baby duckling! Wal's not here. What would he do?" _**"YA &#^%@& WETA!!!"**_
        
    -   Another one, involving large numbers of stinging insects, had him conclude that Wal would... hide in the outhouse with the newspaper.

-   In _Flutterspy_, Fluttershy is trapped in a theater's storage room with evil ninja Yellow Viper. She imagines how the rest of the Mane Six would react, and realizes that most of their solutions wouldn't work for her. Desperate, she uses Pinkie Pie's method—dressing up in the old costumes and pretending to be a hostile ghost—because it's Crazy Enough to Work. However, Yellow Viper is not convinced, and Fluttershy has to fight her way out.
-   In _Marionettes_, Trixie is fighting Masquerade and asks herself what Twilight Sparkle would do. She ultimately decides she can't imitate Twilight as she lacks Twilight's smarts and level of power. She instead sticks to her own talents of illusions and trickery, which works.
-   _Turnabout Storm_: Phoenix gets summoned to and is asked to take a case in Equestria. At one point he wonders what would his Friendly Rival, Miles Edgeworth, do in his place. Let's just say that the mental image of "Gleefully riding and playing with the ponies through the land" isn't exactly the kind of mental support he was looking for.
-   In one episode of _Ultra Fast Pony_, everyone, even the villain, starts asking, "What would DJ 3-Pones do?", followed by a second-long or so Imagine Spot of her telling what she would do. Her advice starts relatively reasonable before turning into non-sequiturs (telling a dying Celestia "Be sure to eat your fruits and vegetables!") and she eventually talks to Shining Armor directly.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_:
    -   Episode 38 has Jean-Claude Magnum, who is a member of the "Church"-whose-name-shall-not-be-typed who tries to kidnap Mai after she beats him in a card game. This ends with Mai dangling from a flagpole with Magnum crying "She's going to fall to her untimely death! What would L. Ron Hubbard do?"
    -   Much earlier Yugi asks Mokuba what his brother would say about him stealing things. He has to amend this to what he would ay "if he wasn't a complete douchebag" after Mokuba imagines that Seto would tell him to steal something from Joey too.
    -   In a vision given to him by the Millennium Rod, Kaiba receives advice from the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, ending with "Ask yourself: What would Christian Bale do?" Kaiba points out that this was proceeded by a story of how Christian Bale was betrayed and murdered by his robot wife.
        
        **Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future:** Yes. _(points to Kaiba)_ Don't do that. I dunno man, you should probably summon your Blue Eyes or something.  
        **Kaiba:** Man, I really need to cut down on the drugs.

    Literature 

-   _Don Quixote_: Parodied when Don Quixote invokes Achilles in His Tent in the Sierra Morena, he asks himself What would two Knights in Shining Armor do? The catch is that being a deconstruction, Don Quixote must choose between the Knight in Shining Armor played straight (Amadis cries and prays for days because his lady Oriana doesn't want to see him anymore) and the Knight in Shining Armor deconstruction (Roland went mad and killed humans, animals and plants when he discovered princess Angelica slept with Medoro).
-   There's also "What Would Sethra Do?" and "What _Wouldn't_ Zeus Do?"
-   _Is It Just Me Or Is Everything Shit?_ has a chapter for Homophobic Christians, which suggests that if Jesus were alive today, what he would in fact do is walk up and down the high street carrying a placard that says "GOD HATES FAGS".
-   _The Laundry Files_ (by Charles Stross): In _The Apocalypse Codex_, Persephone has a "WWLJD" bracelet. The fundamentalist Christian cultists she's infiltrating naturally assume it stands for "What would Lord Jesus do?" Actually, it's "What would _Leeroy Jenkins_ do?"
-   Mark Watney has this thought in _The Martian_:
    
    _"I need to ask myself, 'What would an Apollo astronaut do?' He'd drink three whiskey sours, drive his Corvette to the launchpad, then fly to the moon in a command module smaller than my Rover. Man those guys were cool."_

While locked up, Peter tries to think of what his famous uncle would do in this situation. The notion he comes up with (And dismisses scornfully) is to seduce his jailer, the ambassador's niece. Amusingly, he eventually ends up doing this for totally different reasons, and this _does_ help him escape.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Community_ episode Comparative Religion Jeff eventually asks himself "What would Shirley do?" when confronting Mike. He initially reasons that she'd seek a peaceful resolution.
