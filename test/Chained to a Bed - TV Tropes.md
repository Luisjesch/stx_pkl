_"Obviously if you're watching a scene with a woman tied to a bed while a man forces sex on her, the final act of that movie will involve said man getting shot in the face by Bruce Willis. If, on the other hand, it's a man being tied down and forced into sex by a pretty lady, well, you're watching a wacky romantic comedy."_

_**It's a tie game with no score.**_

A guy meets a cute girl. They have drinks, maybe lunch; witty banter is exchanged.

She takes him up to a hotel room. She produces rope (or sometimes handcuffs) and suggests he be chained to the bed and kinkiness will ensue.

The guy always enthusiastically agrees. At which point she cheerfully robs him blind and leaves, leaving the robbed (and naked) guy stuck until someone finds him.

A prime example of Comedic Sociopathy in that the victim is not only robbed (as in a mugging), but deeply humiliated in a public way while the trope is (almost always) played entirely for laughs at his expense.

Sometimes the setup is used for dramatic, rather than comedic effect, as the person who was chained to the bed is now helpless and at the mercy of the person who tied them up or whoever discovers them. In the comic example the victim is nearly Always Male; in the dramatic example the victim might be male or female. If it _is_ a woman chained to a bed it's much more likely that it's deadly serious.

Compare Chained to a Rock, Bound and Gagged, and Shameful Strip. Overlaps with Kinky Cuffs and The Schlub Pub Seduction Deduction. Often a certain type of fanservice or a Casual Kink. Sometimes, it's part of a Hollywood Exorcism.

    Jokes 

-   There is a joke about a man waking up to his wife giving him a silk cord and telling him: "Tie me up and do whatever you wish." He ties her up and goes fishing.

    Literature 

-   In the short story "Bed of Roses" by Elisabeth Waters, the protagonist's suitor/stalker insists on "a night in her bed" in exchange for helping her to rescue her little brother. He should probably have asked for something else, considering that she's a member of a celibate order of Religious Bruisers, and as such lives in a barracks...
-   Played for Drama in _A Brother's Price_ after Jerin is kidnapped. The first time, he's assured that he won't be touched, and the _second_ time, he's been delivered to the women who arranged for his kidnapping, one of whom _rapes his mouth_. Cira, who was Bound and Gagged and chained to the foot of the bed to watch, is furious.
-   In Peter Robinson's _Friend with the Devil_, one of the investigating detectives finds a suspect tied to the bed in a hotel room. She proceeds to interrogate both him and his lover, before letting the lover untie him. It's just as awkward and absurd as it sounds.
-   The trope is played not just for drama but for outright terror in _Gerald's Game_, which begins with a woman being handcuffed to a bed out in the middle of nowhere by her husband, who then dies of a heart attack. And she has about two days before she'll die of thirst. And then Death himself shows up...
-   _Hilary Tamar_: In _The Sibyl in Her Grave_, bank director Edmund Albany gets found by one of the protagonists, almost naked and tied to a bed. It turns out that he referred to a French dominatrix as _tu_ — a grave violation of propriety, since one ought to pay respect by using "vous".

-   In Courtney Milan's _Proof by Seduction_, Gareth insists that Jenny wear a much fancier dress than the plain fare she prefers and won't let her voice any objections. She lifts her skirts to above her knees, slooowly peels down one of her stockings, and then climbs on his lap for makeouts. While he's distracted, she uses the stocking to tie one of his hands to the chair behind his back. Then she climbs off his lap and archly tells him to free himself. When he furiously declares that he can't reach the knots with his free hand, she tells him she can't reach the laces on the back of that fancy dress either. She's too poor to hire a lady's maid, and the plain dresses are the only ones she can put on and off by herself.
-   Alluded to in _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight_. The Lady Bertilak threatens to have Gawain bound to his bed if he does not 'strike a bargain with her'. In some translations and adaptations, the Lady is teasing, and Gawain responds in kind. In others, Gawain is rather nervous or legitimately concerned about the threat.
-   _Stephanie Plum_: In the first book, Stephanie is interrupted while showering and ends up handcuffed to the shower — an example of this trope being played to comedic effect with a woman. The book gets away with it because the guy who does it is just trying to keep her out of the way so he can search her apartment for something he believes she has. He ogles her a bit, but it's presented as being mostly playfulness (they have "history" together), as well as causing her to get embarrassed and cover up rather than make trouble.
-   _Vampire Kisses_: Played with in the first book when Raven distracts Trevor by making out with him and then stealing his clothes that he had taken off, thinking that he was gonna score with her. The next day at school, she plays a prank on him by supergluing his underwear to her locker.

    -   Casey is later chained to a radiator (no seduction in that case). He takes it with him, and uses it to hit someone.
    -   Roan Montgomery also got chained to a bed and blindfolded by a Moroccan terrorist in "Chuck vs. the Seduction Impossible".

    -   Subverted in another _CSI_ episode when a police officer with missing uniform was found to have engaged in some handcuff/uniform kinkiness but was _not_ robbed by the woman - it was instead stolen when sent for much-needed cleaning afterwards.
-   _CSI: Miami_:
    -   In one episode, a dead man is found handcuffed to a bed. It emerges the hotel has branded cuffs available for just that sort of thing.
    -   Another first season episode had a man _anally raped_. When the detectives cite how there was no forced entry Horatio drops a rather dark Quip to Black.

-   Inverted in _Farscape_, in the episode "What Was Lost- Part 2." John Crichton is being interrogated by Commandant Grayza, the fourth season's Big Bad; her interrogations involve pheromone-assisted rape, and it is most definitely not okay. However, after dosing himself with a stimulant to resist Grayza's pheromones, Crichton suggests that the next round involve bondage: as a result, Commandant Cleavage is left tied to the bed, humiliated and seeking revenge.
-   In one episode of _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_, Carlton sets up a prank of this nature on Will to teach him to respect women (somehow). Will escapes being tied to the chair and, having twigged to the plot, calls up Carlton and "explains" the situation, saying that he panicked and _killed_ the woman. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Friends_:
    -   Julia Roberts guest-stars as a girl Chandler humiliated as a child, and dates him for a while only to convince him to put on her underwear and get naked in a bathroom stall. She then runs away with his clothes. While he is technically not chained to anything, the effect is exactly the same.
    -   A variation occurs, AGAIN involving Chandler, later in the show, with Rachel finding Chandler handcuffed to a chair in her boss' office, whom he's dating. Cue him insisting she uncuff him, and her wondering whether it's worth the risk of her boss knowing she was in there and firing her (he's persuaded to stay when she promises to be "very generous" when her friends ask about this). Chandler later gets revenge by leaving the boss chained up, in her slip, for Rachel to discover.
-   Mandy did this to her crazy ex-boyfriend in _Game On_.
-   _Highlander: The Series_
    -   This happens to protagonist Duncan MacLeod, who was over two hundred years old by then and really, _really_ should have known better. The girl who did that to Duncan was a bounty hunter named Reagan Cole who uses sexuality as part of her MO to capture her prey. Once he was tied up, she blew a whistle and turned him over to the authorities, who were waiting in the next room. When she found out Duncan was going to be beheaded instead of imprisoned (it turned out Duncan had had relations with a duke's wife), she helped him escape. He got her back afterwards by kissing her, then tying her up to a wagon wheel and leaving her.
    -   It happens to Richie too. The poor boy never did have any luck with his women.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_, happens with Barney once...or so he says.
-   Stacey does this to a mark in the first episode of _Hustle_ (although its full significance does not become apparent till the end of the episode).
-   _In From the Cold_: Rather than delivering the threesome which she promised him, Anya leaves poor Su-Yin tied to a bed (he thought it was some light bondage foreplay).
-   _Justified_.
    -   In one episode, the US Marshals are tipped off about an escaped con hiding with his girlfriend. Guess how they find them...
    -   Boyd Crowder ends up doing this to Quarles near the end of Season 3. He messes it up however by having two Oxycontin addicts be guards, and leaving a nice bottle of the drug in the room.
    -   In season three, Quarles binds Brady to a bed and tortures him to death. The crime was part of Quarles' long history of abusing male hustlers.
-   Happened in at least the Spanish version of _Lalola_. Lola hires a prostitute to come to Jerkass Gustavo's house and handcuff him to the bed, making him late for an important meeting. The prostitute then puts lipstick on him, writes "SOY UN CAPULLO" (loosely, "I'm a bastard") on his chest in lipstick and takes pictures, which Lola hangs up around the office. It's fantastic.
-   Sam does this in _Las Vegas_, before she leaves him to be _raped_ by someone else.
-   Played Straight in _Life On Mars_. Sam Tyler is drugged by a prostitute (who is, of course, working for the antagonist of the day) undresses him and leaves him tied naked to his bed, left for his co-workers Gene and Annie to find when they break into his house after he doesn't answer his phone. To make matters worse, she also took incriminating-looking photos of the two of them while he was unconscious.
    -   The American remake _Life on Mars (2008)_ also has the same scene, but with Ray instead of Gene and using Scenery Censor instead of the Waist-Up Nudity shot of Sam that the original used.
-   On _Lost Girl_, the Morrigan has two pairs of handcuffs attached to her bed. In "Into the Dark," Bo comes to her, turns on her succubus seduction powers, puts the Morrigan in the handcuffs, and leaves, stealing a MacGuffin on her way out. Purely Played for Laughs; Bo is The Hero, and the Morrigan is a villain and only had the MacGuffin because Bo had stolen it for her earlier.
-   In Season 2 of _Mad Men_, Don Draper is having one of his many extramarital affairs when, just before having sex, his Girl of the Week tells him that he has a reputation. Draper is not happy with this; he takes the belt of the bathrobe she was wearing, ties her hands to the bed with it (to which she responds enthusiastically), then walks away.
-   Happens to Rayanne in a _My So-Called Life_ episode. Played with in that she does it to herself as a joke, and only afterwards realizes that the key isn't there.
-   _NCIS_:
    -   Subverted in Season Two's "SWAK": A girl was tied up by her boyfriend in a hotel (as a joke, supposedly to stop her from running off with the cute Navy guys having a celebration downstairs) and was left there for days when he got killed in a traffic accident minutes after he left her alone to go get food for them. Humiliated, she lied when finally found and said she was raped, and her mother goes wacko when the nonexistent rapist is never brought in.
    -   In Season Four's "Driven", a Navy programmer died, and while searching for the boyfriend as a suspect, he's found in exactly this situation.
-   Happens in _The New Statesman_ entirely by accident and the (rich female) victim loves the experience, even as Alan gets back to the hotel and concludes that he doesn't have time to deal with her cuffs if he's going to make the flight home. Possibly the only non-serious version with a female victim.
    
    "Now there's a man who really understands bondage!"
    
-   _New Tricks_: The Victim of the Week in "Prodigal Sons" was chained to a bed in what was supposed to be an act of publication humiliation, but turned into murder when the killer entered with a Vorpal Pillow.
-   Used in an episode of _Nip/Tuck_ in which Christian's bitter on-again/off-again girlfriend Kimber tricks him into letting her tie him to a bed, supposedly in preparation for kinky sex...then proceed to torment him with a knife (she never hurts him, but takes great pleasure in making him think she's going to), fed up with the crappy way that he treats her—his most recent stunt involved trying to trade her in for a CAR. Afterwards, she leaves him tied up with a parting shot of, "You'll be fine, your maid comes on Monday."
-   Marissa did it to a Jerk Jock in _The O.C._.
-   Adebisi did this to Kenny Wangler on _Oz_, but that was implied to be a straight-out Prison Rape.
-   Another accidental version in _Peak Practice_ - it's a medical show, so the one with the keys has a bad fall and can't get to the cuffs to unlock them.
-   The third time Leon Tao's number comes up on _Person of Interest_, he's handcuffed to a bed by a woman working for Nigerian Scammers who intend to kill him. When he realizes they intend to kill him, he goes from panicked and upset to confident because he knows Reese will be coming to save him. Again.
-   Played With in an episode of _Republic of Doyle_, the main character Jake is forced to strip at gunpoint by a woman, who cuffs him naked to the ceiling. He's later found in this position by both his ex-colleagues and his Love Interests Leslie who all mock him for it, especially on his size.
    
    **Jake:** There's something a lot bigger going on here.  
    **Leslie:** _\[glances down at his crotch\]_ Not from where I'm standing.
    
-   _Rizzoli & Isles_: In "Family Matters", a woman is tied to a bed and blindfolded by her husband in a hotel. While she is bound and blindfolded, someone enters the bedroom and beats her husband to death.

-   _Saving Grace_: In "A Language of Angels", Grace is about to have sex with a male prostitute named Zack. As foreplay, she agrees to be bound to the four corners of the bed with handcuffs on each limb, facedown and completely naked. He then draws a smiley face on her back and writes his name on her butt with lipstick. Unfortunately, when he finds out she is a cop, he panics and runs away, leaving her bound. Ham comes in and leaves in disgust instead of freeing her. Earl comes in and lectures her instead of freeing her. Several hours later, Ham comes back and frees her.
-   In the Mini Series _Scarlett_, as the villain's Sex Slave arrives at his home for their weekly session, she struggles to tell him that she no longer wants to be his plaything. He slaps her and throws her on the bed. After the Rape Discretion Shot, the scene fades back in to find her lying on the bed with her hands tied to the headboard, with him not the least bit affected at how traumatized she is.
-   Used in an episode of _Scare Tactics (2003)_ where the "victim" begs the person being pranked to free her, only to have the captor return and threaten the prankee with the same fate before the reveal.
-   This happened to George Costanza in _Seinfeld_. His latest plan to pick up women is to ride the subway in a suit reading the financial section of the paper, making it look like he's a hotshot stockbroker. The woman he picks up this way indeed thinks he's rich, gets him tied to a bed, and uses the opportunity to rob him. Or rather try to — George doesn't actually have any money ("Eight dollars? I wasted my whole morning on you for _eight dollars_?"), so she decides to steal his suit instead.
    
    "Will I see you again?"
    
-   On _Shameless (UK)_, used chillingly when Paddy is held captive like this and forced to take heroin and comedically in the US version when Frank is viciously insulted by the three firemen who come to cut him loose.

-   Inverted on an episode of _St. Elsewhere._ Dr. Ehrlich (Ed Begley) hooks up with a slightly kinky young woman who asks him to tie her up. He gets her tied, then goes out to his car to fetch one more item . . . and the apartment door locks behind him.
-   Played for horrific effect in _True Blood._ Jason Stackhouse gets captured in season 4 by werepanthers who tie him to a filthy bed, proceed to bite him, drug him with Viagra, and then have all the women of Hotshot gang-rape him in the hopes of creating more offspring.
-   Self-inflicted example occurs in _Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps_: Gaz is convinced that he and Donna need something to spice up their relationship. Something romantic. So he strips down to a latex posing pouch, covers his crotch and nipples in whipped cream, handcuffs every limb to a bedpost and waits,with a large, flashing novelty dildo in his hand, for Donna to come home. She takes one look and freaks out, running out of his flat and leaving him there...
-   Happens to Cliff in the _Veronica Mars_ episode "The Rapes of Graff", with Keith getting a phone call from him and then finding Cliff in an apartment, handcuffed to a bed, and naked except for a blanket covering his private parts and had his briefcase stolen by the woman who he seduced and tied him. When Keith asks Cliff how he made the phone call, he responds, "Acrobatically".
-   In _The X-Files_ two-part episode "Dreamland", Mulder and a MIB have had their bodies switched. When Scully figures out that something's wrong (in part because "Mulder" has been coming on to her), she gets control of the situation by playing along with his advances and then handcuffing him to the bed. (When he tries to talk his way out of it, addressing Scully as "baby", she warns him that if he does so again he will be "peeing through a catheter".)

    Music 

-   In "Lovers Lie" by The Atomic Fireballs, the singer tells how he woke up to discover that his lover has left him overnight. She also tied him to the bed and deposited all of his belongings on the lawn.
-   The WASP song "Animal (Fuck Like a Beast)". Comic phrase in comic song: "I'll nail your ass to the sheet..." It's self-irony 'cause it's just riotous fancy of a finger-artist.

    Music Videos 

-   In Die Antwoord's "Evil Boy", Yo-landi's verse has her boast about seducing a man, making him think they're about to engage in bondage play. She handcuffs him to a bed, blindfolds him, takes his pants off... then steals his wallet and runs away. This is also shown happening in the song's music video.
    
    Let me take your pants off, let's see what you made of  
    Go through your pockets no, we're not gonna make love  
    Go through your wallet, wow! Look at all this paper  
    What a fucking sucker, see you later, masturbator!
    
-   Another K-Pop example: In Epik High's "Fan," an obsessive "sasaeng" fan kidnaps an idol and keeps him chained to a bed. _It's not_ _played for laughs._
-   Madonna is lying on a bed with chains to her neck in the music video for "Express Yourself".
-   Happens to Joon of MBLAQ in Kan Miyeon's video Going Crazy. He's later shown with his hands tied with a red rope, which symbolizes exactly what it seems: The girl in the video apparently kidnaps young men and tries to force them to marry her. When they (very rationally) reject her, she keeps 'em locked up together in her closet. So, almost literally, the man in the video is Strangled by the Red String.
-   In the video for The White Stripes song "Icky Thump" the singer and guitarist Jack White is chained to a bed and robbed by a Mexican prostitute with a glass eye. The scene is derived from the lyrics.

    Video Games 

-   _96_: Niles keeps a zombified Sixten chained to a bed in the cabin he lives in. Sixten asked to be chained down before he turned, but Niles couldn't bring himself to kill him, instead keeping him there in the hopes he can change him back.
-   One of Aurica's cosmosphere levels in _Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia_ has her tie Lyner up in this fashion in attempt to rape him. He even lampshades this trope word-to-word.
-   In _Far Cry 5_, the 'good' ending has the player character chained to a bed in a bunker after a nuclear explosion, alongside the Big Bad of the game, being forced to listen to his rants forever.
-   _Leisure Suit Larry_:
    -   Happens in _Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards_. If the player has failed to acquire the knife necessary for Larry to cut himself free before this happens, its game over.
    -   Also _two_ different types of death scenes in _Leisure Suit Larry 2: Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)_ — one with "Mama Bimbo", another with any of Dr. Nonookie's "helicopter girls".
    -   A variation occurs at the beginning of _Leisure Suit Larry 7: Love for Sail!_, wherein Shamara (after indeed spending the night with Larry), leaves him handcuffed to a bed and steals Larry's wallet... Then he accidentally sets the hotel on fire.

-   _Oriental Legend_, a video game based on _Journey to the West_, have you playing as one of Xuanzang's disciples out to save him after he's abducted by demons. You do eventually find Xuanzang - chained on a stone slab in the lair of the Rodent King, surrounded by lesser rodent mooks.
-   In _The Secret World_, this wound up saving Madame Roget's life. She was handcuffed to her bed with fuzzy cuffs when The Fog rolled in, causing most of the townsfolk to march into the ocean and become zombies. Since Roget was tied up she couldn't go, the problem was that her partner, the mayor, did and he had the key. Thankfully, Deputy Andy was looking in people's house for supplies and survivors. Much blushing and Ship Tease ensued.
-   _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_: If Geralt tries to propose a threesome with both Yennefer and Triss, they will chain him to the bed, under the guise of sexy fun times, then leave with Geralt still restrained.
-   _World of Warcraft_ has a female comedic example. Some of the goblin joke lines reveal that female goblins like being tied up, and male goblins will steal their stuff while they're helpless.

    Webcomics 

-   Happens to the title character of _Dominic Deegan_. Played completely for comedy, because it's Rachel and Dominic. Comic here. What's interesting is the massive amounts of Dude, Not Funny! reaction from the fan forum. It was very much implied to be non-consensual (as Dominic claims to have had "no choice in the matter"), so treating it as comedy (compared to the male-on-female rape that is treated as drama) has some Unfortunate Implications.
-   _Girl Genius_: Tarvek wakes to find himself handcuffed to a bed after passing out in the bathroom following Gil rescuing him from the time stasis and his poisoned wound. At first he thinks it's Bang's work but he quickly surmises that he's been kidnapped from Gil's care.
-   _Last Res0rt_ uses a downplayed version of this routinely as a preventative measure / enforced "curfew" on criminal players staying in the Executioner's Quarters. Unlike most of the examples here, though, the chains still give them some freedom of movement as opposed to being left spread-eagle and completely vulnerable.
-   Inverted in this _Loserz_ strip where Jodie is the one chained to the bed, but it's after a Wild Teen Party and played for laughs.
-   Tip in _Skin Horse_ lets Julie chain him to a bed with her police handcuffs for some kinky sex. Afterward, she leaves him chained up "for his own protection." However, the handcuffs don't present Tip with much difficulty in the end.
-   Happened to Danny in the webcomic _Sorcery 101_. Possibly unique in that girl (er, demoness) does not escape scot free. Very much not.
-   One _S.S.D.D._ strip started with Anne telling her co-worker that she has this feeling she's forgetting something, then cuts to Richard tied to the bedframe.
-   This strip from _Toonhole_.

    Web Original 

-   The web miniseries _Adult Wednesday Addams_ has an episode where Wednesday leaves a one-night stand chained to his bed, largely just because she's Wednesday. (He ends up being kind of into it.)
-   A medical variant occurs on _Demo Reel_. The Fanatic Fan Family who abduct Donnie in "Blue Patches" keep him helpless and lying down by feeding him muscle relaxants. He manages to escape because the father forgets that they have to be administered regularly.

    Western Animation 

-   In an episode of _The Critic_, a female projectionist (who happens to be a very obsessed fan of movie critic Jay Sherman) invites him to her apartment, drugs his glass of wine, and when he awakens he finds himseif tied up to her bed with rolls of movie film. By the episode's end, his best friend Jeremy rescues him.
-   _The Fairly Oddparents_: In a non-romantic example, Vicky does this to Timmy at least once.
-   And Quagmire in _Family Guy_. Fortunately, he was able to dial the phone for help. And no, he didn't use his hands. Or his feet. He used his penis.
-   Non-romantic example in _Rugrats (1991)_; in "Cuffed", Angelica accidentally gets handcuffed to Chuckie after playing with toy handcuffs her dad told her not to play with as they were being donated to underprivileged kids. They do eventually find the key, but then Angelica gets handcuffed to her own bed.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ has a subversion in which the Titular Character is chained to her bed by her best friend albeit not for any romantic reasons. Instead, it was for the purpose of controlling or stopping her Golden Super Mode transformation and the antics that follow subsequently. It didn't work at all.
-   Mark's first appearance in _Ugly Americans_, a consequence of dating a demon.
