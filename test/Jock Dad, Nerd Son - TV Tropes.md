**Kent Brockman:** Rainier Wolfcastle... star of McBain and the upcoming film, _"Help, My Son Is A Nerd"_.  
**Rainier Wolfcastle:** My son returns from a fancy East Coast college, and I'm horrified to find he's a nerd.  
**Kent Brockman:** I'm laughing already!  
**Rainier Wolfcastle:** It's not a comedy.

Tends to be a High School trope. When a father was a jock in high school (usually marks his Glory Days) while his son pursues less athletic endeavors, usually to the father's disappointment. In quite a few cases the father's grief stems from him being a Jaded Washout who had hoped to live vicariously through his son, but the son's interests effectively means he can't.

Related to a "Gender-Normative Parent" Plot, but is part of the underlying characterization as opposed to a single episode plot. Subtrope to Like Father, Unlike Son. Could be considered an inter-generational version of Sensitive Guy and Manly Man, as well as a loose gender inversion to Feminine Mother, Tomboyish Daughter.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Doraemon_, Nobita's father is Dumb Muscle. Nobita himself, however, is one of the weakest kids in school and is thoroughly uninterested in any sort of physical activity.
-   A Gender Flipped version (more like Tomboy Mom, Girly Daughter) is shown in _Pokémon the Series: XY_ with Serena and Grace. Grace was a famous professional Rhyhorn Racer (a rather rough sport in the Pokémon world), and tries to enforce it on Serena, who eventually settles down for Pokémon Showcases.
-   _Dragon Ball_: Son Goku and Son Gohan. Goku is a martial artist who loves fighting and training who spends all of his days training whenever possible. Gohan on the other hand, while being a powerful martial artist himself, is more of a scholar, which is his profession. In days of peace, Gohan spends his days studying or doing his job, leading him to become out of shape. Goku has already accepted that Gohan is not a fighter and doesn't expect him to fight alongside him. However, Gohan would briefly return to fighting during serious crises. Depending on the media, Goku might show a little disappointment toward his eldest son.
-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_: Fuutarou Uesugi is a straight-A student whose physical capacities are below average, to say the least. His father Isanari, however, has a muscular physique that suggests he regularly exercises.

    Comic Books 

-   _Daredevil_: Subverted in issue #1. Young Matt Murdock wants to become a jock, but his father, the small-time prizefighting boxer "Battling" Murdock, forbids him to do that (or to "rassle" with the neighborhood kids) so that he can concentrate on his studies and have a better life than his past-his-prime dad. Thus very much against his will, Matt becomes a nerd and the butt of cruel jokes by the boys of his Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.
-   _Preacher_: An odd variation. Jesse's father was a Vietnam veteran but was murdered when he tried to take his family away from the clutches of his wife's Evil Matriarch. Jesse spent his childhood forced to train to be a preacher, but his grandmother's henchman Jody made sure to teach Jesse all about horses, cars, guns, and fighting (well, taking beatings), apparently honestly concerned that Jesse was a weakling just because he cried when his friend was murdered or his puppy nailed to a fence. His last words just before Jesse kills him were "Prouda you, boy".
-   _Robin_: While Tim is plenty active he's also a nerd whose into photography and doesn't care for American Football, which his dad doesn't seem to be capable of understanding. As a matter of fact, Jack only figures out Tim is Robin after he tears his son's room to shreds after hearing that the high school football coach doesn't recall Tim trying out for the team and discovers the Robin suit hidden behind a discrete panel in Tim's closet.
-   _Runaways_: Inverted. Chase is initially presented as a jock, and his parents are both super-geniuses. His father is less than impressed with his son's athletic abilities.
-   _Spider-Man_: Inverted in _The Amazing Spider-Man (1963)_ #372, where a Flashback showed us that Flash Thompson's dad was a brilliant academic, who was totally unimpressed by his son's prowess on the football field. Flash bullied Peter because he saw him as the sort of son his father wanted. However, this was eventually made non-canon with his father actually being established as an abusive alcoholic and a cop who pressured Flash into athletics.
    -   It's also inverted for Peter himself. He's the nerd dad and in different universes like Spider-Girl or Renew Your Vows, his daughters are more athletic and less interested in science than him (Mayday Parker was on the basketball team until she had her powers and Annie May was a Bully Hunter when she was a kid and her spider powers were active from birth)
-   _Teen Titans_: Cyborg is an inversion. Even though Victor _is_ brainy, he resents his scientist parents pushing him into academics and chooses to pursue athletics...until, of course, the accident that nearly killed him, at which point his dad made him a cyborg to save his life. Later versions of his origin have Victor's father brushing off his son almost entirely because of his athletic focus, even when it's made clear Vic's academically excelling as well.
-   _Ultimate Fantastic Four_: Played for drama. Gary Richards is a huge sports nut and obsessed with "manly" behavior. His son Reed's quiet nature and fascination with science elicits his scorn, to the point that he openly regards Ben Grimm as being the son he wanted but never had.

    Comic Strips 

-   Parodied in _Hägar the Horrible_ with Hägar, who is virtually Book Dumb illiterate and goes on raids to make a living, and his very literate and studious son Hamlet, who prefers reading to fighting and is vastly more skilled than his father at reading and writing.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _X-Men: Evolution_ fanfic _XXY:Evolution_, where most of the characters are genderbend, Kit Pryde (male Shadowcat) is a geeky kid who likes sci-fi and fantasy while his dad Carmen was said to have been a great quarterback in high school. Because of this, Kit believes himself to be a disappointment to his dad, which even the bullies, his coach, and one of his dad's buddies think so, and his emerging mutant ability makes it more difficult. But his dad does accept him for who (and what) he is, and apologizes for making him think otherwise.
-   Lightly touched upon in _Telling Lies? No, Mama_, when Lila and her mother turn into an akuma. Lila shoots beams that turn people into their opposite, while her mom makes people tell truths they've buried deep inside. One boy she hits is a basketball player. After her beam hits him, he admits that he hates basketball and only joined the team because his dad made him. He really wanted to do theater, but his father said it was for gays.

    Film

-   _Chicken Little_: Provides the contrast between scrawny and geeky Chicken Little and his father, a former star athlete.
-   _Father of the Bride (2022)_: Adan is a softspoken lawyer who dislikes sports, while his father Hernan is a pompous businessman who dabbles in several sports. Hernan laments late in the film about where he went wrong with Adan, and Billy reassures him that he raised a good son.
-   _Halloween (2018)_: An early scene has a father and son on a hunting trip right before Michael escapes from custody, with their dialogue showing the son he prefers dance lessons to hunting.
-   _Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves_: Inverted. Wayne is a tech nerd whose youngest son, Adam, plays baseball. At the beginning of the movie, Adam asks Wayne to let him go to baseball camp instead of science camp. Wayne ultimately obliges (and is overjoyed to discover how much math there is to it).
-   _How to Train Your Dragon_: Hiccup would be this to his father Stoick the Vast. Scrawny little nerd-boy in a society of huge, fierce, dragon-fighting Vikings.
    
    **Hiccup:** _\[sarcastically imitating Stoick\]_ Excuse me, barmaid! I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring! I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy arms, extra guts and glory on the side! This here, this is a talking fishbone!
    
-   _Life of a Horse Trader_: Yone is a Boisterous Bruiser who is also a champion sumo wrestler while his son is quiet and bookish. This causes some tension when it's time to decide about Daihei's education.
-   _Mr. Peabody & Sherman_: A downplayed version. Both title characters are extremely dorky, but Mr. Peabody is an accomplished athlete, winning two Olympic medals.
-   _Tea and Sympathy_: The play and film play this to the hilt: the former football player dad, who still acts like a high school jock, and his son, the sensitive actor and singer whom everyone suspects of being gay. Dad rather crudely tries to push his son Tom into more "manly" activities, oblivious to the effect on his psyche. Yet when Tom has a mental breakdown resulting in a suicide attempt, Dad's nowhere to be found.
-   Charlie from _Where's Willie?_ likes hiking, fishing, and sports. Willie is a Child Prodigy who invents a computer that can Hack the Traffic Lights. Charlie doesn't understand his son at all, and even threatens to get rid of all his computers at one point.

    Literature 

-   _Diary of a Wimpy Kid:_ Greg, the titular Wimpy Kid, is the nerd son to his father Frank's jock dad. An odd case since Greg is Book Dumb unlike the typical nerd, but the trope is still there: Frank wants Greg to play sports, even if Greg hates them and would rather stay at home with comic books and video games.
-   Park and Jamie in _Eleanor & Park_ are the poster child of this trope.
-   _Ghost Girl (2021)_: Elijah's father is a former football player who still has the body to prove it, in contrast to his son, who's out-of-shape and hates sports.
-   _Project Tau:_ Kalin Taylor has this relationship with his father, to the point where Benjamin Taylor wonders if Kalin is really his son.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire:_
    -   Prince Maekar is a medieval version of this in the _Tales of Dunk and Egg_ prequel series. He is famed for his joint military exploit in the Blackfyre Rebellion alongside his brother, Baelor, and tries to coach his sons to be great warriors like himself. Only one of his kids, Aerion, becomes a good warrior, and that one turns into a deplorable sadist as well, while the other three become a well-meaning but craven drunk (Daeron), a mild-mannered scholar (Aemon) and a rebellious runaway hanging out with commoners (Aegon). Maekar has a blindly antagonistic Papa Wolf moment in response to the prowess of his children being brought to question by the events of the first novella.
    -   Randyll Tarly is a brilliant, no-nonsense warrior while his eldest son Samwell is a fat bookworm. Randyll spent Sam's entire life trying to whip him into shape without success. Finally, when his wife birthed a second son, he gave Samwell a choice: Join the Night's Watch and renounce his claim as heir to House Tarly, or suffer a Hunting "Accident".
    -   The first known Baelish was a sellsword from Bravos, his son a knight, and _his_ son a minor lord who fought and distinguished himself in the war of Ninepenny kings. The next Baelish has no martial skill, instead being a financial miracle worker who elevates the house to greater heights.
    -   Aegon the Conqueror was a muscular, charismatic general who brought about the union of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through military force. His son and heir apparent, Aenys, was a spindly nerd who had no interest in fighting and preferred the company of septons and maesters to knights. Many people at the time complained that Aenys was not fit to be his father's successor, and dreamed of Aegon's other son, Maegor, who did inherit his father's physical prowess, of becoming king. Unfortunately, Maegor would go down in history as Maegor the Cruel...
-   _Things Fall Apart:_ A fairly unconventional example set in colonial Nigeria. The Hero Okonkwo is a phenomenally strong warrior and farmer with a predilection for violence and is as macho as one can possibly get—in sharp contrast to his eldest son Nwoye, who dislikes fighting and prefers listening to women's folktales (and later converts to Christianity because his sensitive heart is touched by the missionaries' songs). This irritates Okonkwo to no end, and more than once Okonkwo has considered possibly _killing_ his son.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Big Bang Theory_: Sheldon often talked about how his father forced him to learn football. Explored in detail in the prequel series _Young Sheldon_, where we see that his father is a football coach.
-   _Bones_:
    -   In the episode "Boy in the Time Capsule", Alex Stinson, an uber-nerd science kid, was the son of a jock football player (Terry Stinson) and his head cheerleader Childhood Sweetheart Janelle Stinson, and the father was disappointed at him being a nerd. It turns out the nerd was actually the son of the Victim of the Week, Roger Dillon (the titular "boy"), an uber-nerd computer geek who nobody in his class liked and who was the Abhorrent Admirer of the Alpha Bitch - that is, until they had to do a paper together, she fell for him, and they had sex. The "father", who had discovered the affair, as well as another nerd (Gil Bates), who was the victim's best friend with whom he had created a computer program that would make him very rich by the time the Jeffersonian was investigating the crime, were the murderers.
    -   Another episode has the body discovered by a pair of father and son deer hunters, with the son being more preoccupied with worrying about making it back in time to watch a _Project Runway_ like-show and read a biography on Diane von Furstenberg. His dad is chagrined, berates him a little bit about being unmanly, and Then proceeds to make a high-pitched scream when they find the victim of the episode while the son grabs a shotgun and blasts the skull.
-   _Frasier_: Martin has this relationship with both his sons in a slightly different context. Martin was a man's man cop for decades and has two opera-loving, psychiatrist sons with whom he has little in common.
-   _Frasier (2023)_ has an inverted case with Frasier and his son Freddy, who dropped out of Harvard to become a firefighter and has more blue-collar tastes like Martin did.
-   _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_: Uncle Phil was an Academic Athlete and a star athlete in college, while his son Carlton is academically oriented but terrible at sports, especially basketball. When his cousin Will starts playing basketball and becomes the star of the team, Carlton becomes jealous of his father bonding with Will over their shared interest in sports.
-   _Friends_: A bit of a Downplayed Trope in the relationship between the somewhat nerdy Ross and his father, even though he was generally portrayed as on the positive side of the Parental Favoritism; "The One With The Male Nanny" revealed that Jack Geller once saw the young Ross playing with his toy dinosaurs and asked why he wasn't outside "like a real boy". A similar, in-law version involved Ross and Rachel's dad, a stereotypical "All-American Boy" bordering on Jerk Jock.
-   _Grounded for Life_: Henry wants to sign up for tap dancing, but his dad pushes him to do a more "masculine" sport like soccer.

-   _Married... with Children_: Al Bundy was the Big Man on Campus in high school. He was a football hero and made it with every hot girl in his class. In contrast, his son Bud is constantly trying (and failing) to score with women and is much more academically oriented. On one occasion, Al says that if the two went to school together, Al probably would not have let Bud hang out with him.

When an alien bounty hunter's ship crash lands nearby, this makes the kid more open to an offer of friendship from the alien, who turns out to be the bounty hunter's criminal.
-   _Schitt's Creek_: Johnny brags about being on his school baseball team, but it was a Hebrew school team called The Flying Latkes, and it's clear Johnny was a nerd. However, he's a better player than his Camp Gay son David who only agrees to play in an amateur game to please his boyfriend. The storyline turns out very sweet as Johnny, who is on the opposite team, loses interest in playing to cheer on his adult son who makes a surprise hit and wins the game.

-   _Seinfeld_: Before coming up with the famous "show about nothing" idea, George pitches a sitcom idea to Jerry that revolves around this trope, although "jock" might be stretching things a little.
    
    **George:** You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach a gymnastics team in high school, and you're married, and your son isn't interested in gymnastics, and you're pushing him into gymnastics.  
    **Jerry:** Why should I care if my son is into gymnastics?  
    **George:** Because you're a gymnastics _teacher_, it's only natural.  
    **Jerry:** But gymnastics is not for everybody!  
    **George:** I know, but he's _your_ son!  
    **Jerry:** So what?!

-   Patton Oswalt talks about being the younger half of a variant of this — _Military_ Dad, Nerd Son. And also, its flip side.
    
    "My dad was a Marine colonel. Look at me. Fuckin' pot belly and man-boobs. 'You know, father, the short stories of Tilly Olson are a wonderful window into contemporary womanho—' Punch, drink, cry. So now _my_ kid's going to be a Navy SEAL, gonna beat the shit out of me and all my friends, rip up my comic books, melt our lead figures, make our lives a living hell; ughhhhh... 'Hey dad, I threw your _Blade Runner_ gun on the roof. Heh heh, faggot. Maybe if you do three pushups I'll go get it down.'"

    "Turn down your music, Dad! We're trying to study!"  
    "Excuse me, Father, may I have a word? These brownies taste peculiar."
    
-   Ed Byrne has a routine about his father, a former fabricator in sheet metal works, and now even as a pensioner is much tougher than his son. He explains that they share a sense of humour, but that's about it. Eddie Senior is a big burly chap who is good with his hands. Ed is a scrawny, long-haired 'weakling child' who likes performing.

    Video Games 

-   _Assassin's Creed Origins:_ One quest in the "Curse of the Pharaohs" DLC has Bayek run into a young man who wants to become a scribe, but is hesitant because he thinks his father would look down on such things. His father? Is Rameses II, one of Egypt's longest lasting and most successful rulers (it's a long story). Fortunately, the quest ends with the kid learning his father is actually fine with his choice of career.
-   In _Firewatch_, Ned Goodwin fancies himself an adventurous outdoorsman living off the land.

    Web Animation 

-   Dolph's dad in _Camp Camp_ is a military man who is very embarrassed about his son's love of arts and crafts and wishes he'd take up a manlier hobby, like guns or (American) football. For some reason, this disturbs him more than Dolph's other major issues.

    Webcomics 

-   Inverted with Roy Greenhilt and his father Eugene in _The Order of the Stick_. Roy chose a career as a fighter class as opposed to a wizard like his father, which are seen as a jock and nerd class at least in-universe. Played straight with Eugene and his own father, Horace, who had inspired Roy's career path. Interestingly, Roy was apparently a nerd compared to _other_ fighters (possibly because Roy tries very hard to avert the "fighters are Dumb Muscle" stereotype)
    
    **Roy:** Well I hate to break it to you dad, but this isn't the end of the line. More like half-time.
    
    **Eugene:** What? How can you halve time itself?
    
    **Roy:** \*Sigh\* I should have known a sports metaphor would be wasted on you.

-   _Batman Beyond_ has Willie Watt. He's a complete nerd and not the cute kind. Conversely, his father Frank is a well-built man who is into construction.

This inspires Willie to steal a high-powered construction Golem and attacks his fellow students with it at a school dance. He even aims to be a Self-Made Orphan and tries desperately to kill his own father. What was Frank's response when his son got arrested for all this mayhem? "Guess this means he ain't no wuss anymore." Batman's Disapproving Look makes him regret saying that.
-   _Big City Greens_: Remy, Cricket and Tilly's best friend, is a mild-mannered, geeky, nerdy-type kid who's more into science, math, music, and video games than typical manly or athletic endeavors.

The episode "Football Camp" even revolves around Remy's dad trying to get him into playing football by making him and Cricket come with him to a football camp, until Cricket convinces Remy to tell his dad that he's okay with being better at football on his video game than in real life, and that he doesn't have the same sports dreams as his father.

-   One _The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror_ episode shows us Prof. Frink's dad, who, although also an academic, is more of the Adventurer Archaeologist sort.

That said, Slickis supports Ickis despite his shortcomings, even emphasizing his own failures to make his son feel better.
-   Parodically reversed in _South Park_'s take on _High School Musical_: Bridon Gueermo wants to be on the basketball team, but his abusive Camp Straight father pushes him into dancing. And if anyone calls him out on it, they find themselves on the end of an annoying, limp-wristed slap.
-   An in-law version in _Regular Show_ between the socially awkward, sensitive Mordecai and Frank, Margaret's intrepid helicopter-piloting dad.

-   One episode of _Hey Arnold!_ featured a pair like this. In "Rich Guy," Arnold and his grandpa meet Sammy Redman, a millionaire who adores sports. Sammy becomes quite close to Arnold, even calling him "Sonny," which viewers find out is his way of making up for the fact that his own son Alan is a photographer who hates sports.

-   In the _DuckTales (2017)_ episode "The Dangerous Chemistry of Gandra Dee," after Mark Beaks uses nanobots to bulk himself up, he catches a projectile with ease, causing him to comment that he's never actually caught a ball before, and then retorting "Well, who's the loser now, Coach _Dad_?!"
