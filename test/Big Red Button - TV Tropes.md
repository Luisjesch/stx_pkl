_I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labelled "Danger: Do Not Push". The big red button marked "Do Not Push" will instead trigger a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will not clearly be labelled as such._

The activation control of choice for any truly powerful weapon or effect, usually located dead center on the control console, sometimes under a molly-guard. It's usually colored red, as a hazard warning.

Pressing the Big Red Button activates the function of a given machine that is important to the plot, be it firing the superweapon, activating the Self-Destruct Mechanism, or emergency shutdown.

In live action, this will often be the only control big enough to make out on camera. In animation, this will often be the only control, period. (At least the only one that's not painted on the background layer.)

Sometimes, it's used as an excellent piece of Schmuck Bait to lure someone into a trap by making it Forbidden Fruit; tell someone not to press it, list all the negative side effects it will cause and all the terrible consequences if they do press it, and you can almost guarantee they will press it.

Of course, if you _don't_ tell them about it, they might walk right up to it and discover by experimentation the answer to the question "What Does This Button Do?"

Almost every piece of factory equipment or free-standing power tool sold in the real world has an actual Big Red Button. It is _always_ an emergency shutdown or power disconnect, intended to save the life of the operator or bystanders by stopping the machine in a big hurry. In nuclear reactors, this is referred to as a SCRAM Switch (quite the meaningful name, due to the incredibly strong urge to _run like hell_ away from the malfunctioning nuclear reactor).

It is not, however, found in real-world examples of certain weapons.

There are several common things which pushing the big red button may do, including initiating the Self-Destruct Sequence, activating the Ejection Seat, using the Nitro Boost, sounding the Red Alert, and launching a missile, rocket, or air strike. It may also be there to confuse people infiltrating the secret base and it will immediately cause the pusher of the button to fall into a trap. Or it may do absolutely nothing.

Compare Big Electric Switch. See also Plot-Sensitive Button, What Does This Button Do?, and Caps Lock, Num Lock, Missiles Lock.

Not to be confused with the game company that developed the infamous _Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric_. Or with the late actor and comedian Red Buttons.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Lampshaded in a strip of _Ah! My Goddess_ where Skuld writes under a Big Red Button "don't push." Urd wants to push it because it's stated not to do so. Skuld finally writes "push it" to prevent her sister from using it. It ends with Belldandy (whose personality is markedly different from Urd's) pushing the button.
-   _Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure_: Subverted. Kazuki pushes a big red button that he thinks will activate the machine which will prevent the two alternate realities from destroying each other. Turns out, the button actually did nothing and the machine was instead activated by Mitsuki leaning against a lever on the machine. This turns out to have an affect on the third world that gets created by putting up a situation where Kazuki appears to be destined to end up with all three of her romantic rivals as well as her.
-   In _Future War 198X_ the Minister of Defense ignores orders and presses the large red button, which launches a massive second wave assault. Miami, New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo are all destroyed and from space the earth turns red.
-   In _GaoGaiGar_, Final Fusion is initiated with one of these. While it, like the _Gatchaman_ example above, has a glass cover over it that can, presumably, be flipped up with relative ease, Mikoto never bothers to do so, instead always opting to smash her fist right down through it.
    -   In one episode, Mikoto is out of action, leaving Swan to engage Final Fusion instead...she, too, opts for the fist-smashing-through-glass option. You gotta wonder how many of those little glass panels they go through in a month.
-   _Ghost in the Shell: SAC\_2045_. A Posthuman who can take control of any networked system is being kept in an isolation chamber with all crucial systems air-gapped. Except, Misato points out, the emergency systems connected to the big red button a technician just pressed when the Posthuman tried to break out...
-   There was an episode in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ movie "Paint it, white" when nations tried to find a way to control UFO, Russia presses one and activates an alert.
-   In Episode 9 of _Hirogaru Sky! Pretty Cure_, the button Kabaton uses to suck Tsubasa and Elle-chan into his UFO and kidnap them is a big red button.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ has one of these, and it might be one of the more realistic things in the series in that it's an emergency shutdown switch for the Eva. Not that it ever seems to help.
-   Used in _One Piece_ when Franky pushed the "Pirate" button in Vegapunk's lab, thus blowing the whole place up.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_: The Demon sisters' vehicle G-Sting has a particularly noticeable self-destruct button built inside, that Scanty accidentally pushed out of rage in "If Angels Wore Swimsuits". Way to go, dumbass.
-   In _Science Ninja Team Gatchaman_, the firing button for the God Phoenix's bird missiles is big and red and Condor Joe, being the team's gunner, just _loves_ to push it. To emphasize that, the button has a glass cover that retracts when the missile system is armed, but sometimes Joe doesn't wait and punches through it to push the button.
-   In _Wandaba Style_, Susumu always gets his experiments started by exclaiming "Wandaba Style A Go!" and pushing a large button labeled "Wandaba."

    Comic Books 

-   In the _Blake and Mortimer_ story "SOS Meteors", there is such a button standing out in the control panel of the Big Bad's base. Mortimer wonders what it does multiple times, before accidentally pushing it. It is the Self-Destruct Sequence.
-   _Doktor Sleepless_ causes a temporary city-wide blackout using a touchscreen tablet which he's set up to display the image of a Big Red Button labeled "DO NOT PRESS".
-   _The Legend of Wonder Woman (2016)_: Tilly Heyday pushes the large red button swathed in caution tape on the experimental aircraft Diana and the Holliday Girls "borrowed", despite the chorus of her friends shouting Don't Touch It, You Idiot!, in slightly more polite words. Luckily for everyone the button turns the plane invisible and doesn't cause them or their allies any harm.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In _DC Comics Presents #59: Superman and the Legion of Substitute Heroes_, it provides a trap for Ambush Bug. They provide the Superman Museum with just two signs in 20th century English instead of Interlac. One is a KEEP OUT. The other is the DO NOT PUSH THIS BUTTON sign on the Phantom Zone projector. Of course, Ambush Bug enters the room and pushes the button.
    -   In _Day of the Dollmaker_, the titular villain's remote control which sets off the bombs strapped to his hostages has a huge red button in the center.

    Comic Strips 

-   In a _Prickly City_ Sunday Strip, Winslow sees a button with a "Do not push" sign. After some careful idleness, he pushes it in the penultimate panel. In the ultimate one, he complains, "If you break the rules you deserve a boom."

    Fan Works 

-   _Becoming a True Invader_: GIR has to hit one to activate the Dibship's new power cell during the fight with the monster larvae on Fefa. Since he can't quite figure out how to press it, Gaz throws Dib at the button to trigger it instead.
-   _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_:
    -   Dr. Brainstorm has one of these in his lair that triggers several traps.
    -   Likewise, Brainstorm's aircraft has one that launches missiles.
    -   Thunderstorm has one on one of his contraptions, though it's not _big_.
-   _Child of the Storm_ reveals in Chapter 74 that there's one in the heart of Avengers Tower, which Tony presses in order to overload the arc reactor and destroy the building, preventing it from falling into HYDRA's hands. Actually deliberately invoked and justified, given that Tony's a Pop-Cultured Badass.
-   In _Fallout: Equestria - Project Horizons_, Blackjack finds one in a gem mine run by slaves and is just dying to press it. What it does is bit more... graphic than she would have hoped.
-   In _Food for Thought_ Moriarty has a big red panic button to summon his henchmen.
-   In _The Last Chance_ a man in the Resurrection Office pushes a big red button to send Harry and Hermione back to fourth year when they're killed before their time.
-   Invoked in _Infinity Crisis_ story _Powers and Marvels_. After the Rangers have received their new suits, Billy notices something in red in the data feed they're receiving from the new suits, and Shuri tells him to only press that in an emergency, as that triggers the suits to come together in what they term 'the Iron Zord'.
-   _The New Adventures of Invader Zim_:
    -   In the first chapter, it's shown that Dib's Spittle Runner (formerly Tak's) has one of these that Dib thinks activates the weapons systems. It's actually an emergency brake.
    -   A later chapter shows one of these on the control panel for the City Cesspool, which triggers an emergency purge that dumps the cesspool's contents into the sewer system.
-   _Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space_
    -   Annika-709 produces a Long List of security flaws in the Supervillain Lair, concluding with the Self-Destruct Mechanism being activated by a highly-visible red button.
    -   Invoked when the supervillain activates his Doomsday Device. "Focus the beams! Press the Big Red Button!"
-   _Ruby Pair_: Dib hits one to shut down all the security in the Vortian prison in "Frosting the 13th". Tenn is incredulous that such a button was even installed.
-   In _Rocketship Voyager_, the eponymous rocketship is a contraterrene\-powered torchship. In one scene the Chief Engineer has his hand on a red-lit lever which will eject the entire Cochrane Drive if needed, but knows that if the electromagnetic fields falter for so much as a microsecond, they'd all be obliterated before he could even think of pulling it.
-   _You Are (Not) At Fault_: Lampshaded when Asuka sarcastically notes the Third Impact happened because Rei, in her infinite wisdom, handed the big red button for the end of the world to a borderline suicidal.

    Film — Animation 

-   In _Cats Don't Dance_, Darla Dimple finds all her other efforts to ruin the animals' big musical number flummoxed by way of her being the villain of the picture. Then, she throws a Big Red Button (er...switch) bigger than she is, labelled "Granddaddy of All Switches"...which sets off all manner of fantastic special effects, making the performance that much more spectacular.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _The Incredibles_: One of the DVD Easter Eggs is a compilation sequence showing "every door, button and explosion in the movie" which highlights just how _many_ there are. Examples include:
    -   Mr. Incredible pushing one in his car at the start of the film to transform the car into the Incredibile.
    -   Helen activating flares when flying the jet to stave off Syndrome's missiles.
    -   Both of Syndrome's consoles have Big Red Buttons. One of them launches missiles, the other launches the rocket.
-   In the first installment of _The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour_, Timmy Turner's given a teleporter back to his room that takes the form of this and Jimmy Neutron accidentally presses it, sending him to Timmy's universe and leaving Timmy free to wreak his usual brand of havoc in his.
-   Lampshaded in _Monsters vs. Aliens_, where there are two big red buttons in the bunker: one that launches all of America's nuclear weapons, and the identical one right next to it which makes coffee. In a credits tag, one of the other characters asks for a cup of coffee from the President, who proceeds to press the _wrong_ button. Neither is labeled.
-   At the end of _Osmosis Jones_, Mayor Phlegming has been voted out of office (or possibly impeached and forcibly removed) following Frank's Near-Death Experience. He gets demoted to working in Frank's colon as a street cleaner, and comes across a Big Red Button. He wonders what it does, and presses it. This results in him being expelled from Frank's body via a fart.
-   Lampshaded in _Tom and Jerry: The Movie_, in which our cat and mouse heroes are attempting to stow away on a river boat and Tom is searching wildly for the start button. Jerry says that he should push the red button because "It's _always_ a red one!" They push it, aaand... yup. It is the start button they were looking for.
-   _Toy Story_:
    -   There is actually a big, red button on Buzz Lightyear's chest. Pushing it will cause his wings to pop out.
    -   Several big red push buttons can be seen in _Toy Story 3_ during the Fake Action Prologue. One on Mr. Potato Head's remote control that he presses to blow up the bridge.

-   _Wall E_
    -   WALL•E ends up pushing the big red button repeatedly to stop his doomed Escape Pod, with no visible result.
    -   In the companion short film, BURN-E accidentally pushes one in another pod, which turns out to be its launch button.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Alien: Resurrection_: Liquid helium sprays activated by a Big Red Button are set up to control the aliens in their cells. Unfortunately the Mad Scientist fumbles at removing the pin and raising the mollyguard in time to stop the aliens escaping. One alien is clever enough to deduce the connection between the sprays and the Big Red Button, which serves to bite the ass of a security mook.
-   In _Ali G Indahouse_, after pseudo gangsta Ali G becomes a member of Parliament, he asks the Prime Minister to see the red button for the nukes. After the PM shows it to him he pretends to slip and fall on the button.
-   In _Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery_, Dr. Evil's lair has a button that, when pressed, aborts the nuclear-armed probe that will cause all of the world's volcanoes to erupt simultaneously.
-   In _The Box_, a family is given a small box which has a Big Red Button. If anyone in the family pushes the button, they get 1 million dollars, tax free (this is set in the 1970s), but someone they do not know will die. Naturally, someone does, setting off the plot.
-   _The Cabin in the Woods_ has a Big Red Button under a clear box labeled "System Purge" which plays a pivotal role in the storyline. This is an obvious joke on the trope as well as a Deus ex Machina. It's right behind a desk in the main lobby, unguarded, can be pressed by just anyone (no extra keys, password, or security override necessary), and when activated, turns the entire base into a blood-soaked chaos because the controllers are woefully ill-prepared for dealing with all the monsters at once getting released from their containment units. Really, they _deserved_ to get slaughtered with that kind of Too Dumb to Live\-level risk management.
-   In _The Chronicles of Riddick (2004)_, some bounty hunters coming in for a hard landing on a planet are told to hit the "Party Poppers" by their leader. Said "poppers" are retro-rockets on strings, much like a drag chute. The relevant button is simply named "Party Poppers".
-   In the beginning of _The Crawling Hand_ a hysterical astronaut begs the main characters at command central to "_Push... the red... Button!_" They do, and it blows him up.
-   The van in _Fanboys_ has an exact duplicate of the _Falcon_'s Big Red Button, which activates the engine's nitro cylinder.
-   _The Fifth Element_:
    -   Not Big, but definitely red, is one mentioned by Zorg: "I hate warriors, too narrow-minded. I'll tell you what I do like though: a killer, a dyed-in-the-wool killer. Cold blooded, clean, methodical and thorough. Now a real killer, when he picked up the ZF-1, would've immediately asked about the little red button on the bottom of the gun." Immediately after, Arnot the Mangalore pushes that button, and the weapon self destructs. Impressively.
    -   While the doctors are reassembling the Sole Survivor of the Mangalore vessel, General Munro keeps his hand hovering over a large red dome, warning that their patient had better be polite. On revealing that their patient is a beautiful woman, the doctor gently moves a gaping Munro's hand away from the button.
-   _Flash Gordon (1980)_: Hans Zarkov's spaceship has a Big Red launch button.
-   In _Forbidden Planet_, the Big Red Button is a switch that, when thrown, initiates a chain reaction that will destroy the planet. It's not actually big, or red, and has to be activated by turning a disc, which raises a vertical rod from the floor that is then pushed down to activate. In other words, a disappointingly safe example.
-   Deconstructed in _Heathers_, where the time bomb has three red buttons. The reason isn't given but we can assume they are meant to complicate a defusing.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   In _Dr. No_, there's a big red wheel on the wall in the title Big Bad's nuclear reactor control room labeled "Danger Level". Bond turns it to overload the reactor.
    -   In _Goldfinger_, the red button that activates the James Bond car's famous ejector seat is under the stick shift.
    -   Two in _You Only Live Twice_: One pushed by Bond to destroy the SPECTRE space ship, one used by Blofeld to activate his base's Self-Destruct Mechanism.
    -   _Moonraker_. To stop the Centrifugal Gravity on Drax's space station, Bond flips up a red molly-guard cover and presses the black button underneath.
    -   _Spectre_: Franz Oberhauser (Bond's evil foster brother) muses that brothers always know which button to press to aggravate the other. He then pushes the red button to start the countdown to demolish the building they are in, giving Bond a Sadistic Choice between saving himself or trying to save the Bond Girl in time.
-   _Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom_: Maisie presses one to free the dinosaurs trapped in Lockwood Manor.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:
    -   In _Iron Man_, Tony Stark activates the untested flight system for the Mark I to fly away from the terrorist camp by punching the big red button on his arm.
    -   _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_: Rocket builds a nuclear weapon with two Big Red Buttons. They are right next to each other and look identical. One will start a five-minute countdown, the other will trigger instant detonation. This causes problems when Baby Groot is the only one who can plant the bomb but is unable to tell the difference. Rocket gets extremely frustrated trying to explain the concept in the middle of a battle.
-   While not as big as most, the button to activate the LTD's turbo engines in _Men in Black_ definitely qualifies. "Remember the little red button? Push the little red button."
-   _MonsterVerse_: Monarch's Titan containment sites in _Godzilla (2014)_ and _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ have Big Red Buttons which activate emergency procedures designed to kill the captive Titans (or rather _try to_ kill them). Ultimately, they only serve a very minor role in the plot of either film, as they either don't get pressed or they dramatically fail to so much as make the Titans bleed.
    -   Exactly _what_ happens when the button is pushed seems to vary by Titan. The Janjira Outpost's measure was a gigantic net of electrified wires that swung out over the open pit where the reactor cores and Hokmuto's cocoon were, in an attempt to either electrocute the Kaiju or at minimum keep him from leaving the area. Hokmuto, however, doesn't seem to notice the electrical current when he pulls the wires down and escapes into the night sky.
-   _Outpost: Rise of the Spetsnaz_: Dolokhov escapes from his cell where the Nazis where holding him so they could do experiments on him. He comes across a surgeon who has his comrade Strapped to an Operating Table. The surgeon casts a desperate look at the red button that will call the guards. Dolokhov just shrugs in mock apology, because he's standing between the surgeon and the button.
-   Downplayed in _Queen of Outer Space_. The Beta Disintegrator that will be used to destroy Earth is only activated by a tiny red button, as the titular queen points out. Presumably as she Does Not Like Men, she doesn't feel the need to compensate for anything.
-   As in the novel, _Ready Player One (2018)_ features a Big Red Button that will permanently shut down the OASIS and delete all its content. Unlike the novel, in the film version Wade is accessing the OASIS from the back of a speeding van when he is given access to the button — the van's wild maneuvering nearly sends him careening straight into it.
-   In _Resident Evil (2002)_, there's a Big Red Button in the subway car that opens and closes the door in the floor.
-   One controversial change in the American release of _The Return of Godzilla_ was the scene in which the Russian freighter Colonel Kashirin hits a big red button to launch a nuke. Of course, in the original release, he was valiantly trying to hit the button to _stop_ the launch before he died from his injuries, but the American release had the subtitles changed and added a quick clip of his hand hitting the button (which instead _triggers_ the launch now), most likely because the Cold War was ongoing at the time of release.
-   _Spaceballs_ has a Big Red Button on Spaceball One<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  that triggers the self-destruction of the ship. Lone Starr knocks Dark Helmet into it, setting off the countdown to the big boom. The bad guys later try to stop the self-destruct sequence with a second smaller, yellow button, only to find it's out of order, prompting Dark Helmet's cry of "Even in the future, nothing works!" The ship also features a lever-activated Emergency Stop which is labelled "NEVER USE"; Dark Helmet learns the hard way why that injunction was included.
-   _Space Station 76_: A crewman looks like he's about to blow up an approaching shuttle with a red button, but when he presses the button it turns out to be a pop-out cigarette lighter.
-   During the Wacky Racing sequence from _Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over_, one of the racers tells Juni Cortez to press a red button on his speeder labeled "Do not push." He presses it, and it triggers an Ejector Seat that knocks Juni off the speeder.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   The Millennium Falcon has one of these to activate its hyperdrive.
    -   In _Attack of the Clones_, Padme appears to press the same big red button twice in order to activate two different functions: first to forward a message from Obi-Wan to Coruscant, then to pull up a map of Geonosis.
-   In _Undercover Brother_, Conspiracy Brother foolishly pushes a large red button labeled "Atomic Core" and starts a Self-Destruct Mechanism that will destroy The Man's headquarters. This forces the Brotherhood's infiltration team to flee for their lives.
    
    _"Let's see what this so called_ button _does!"_
    

    Literature

-   The Richard Matheson short story "Button, Button" features a stranger who offers a couple a box with a red button in it. Push the button, they are awarded a hefty sum of money... and someone they don't know dies.
-   In the Russian novel _Death or Glory_ by Vladimir Vasilyev, the main character finds a mysterious black box with a big red button on it. He muses on how cliché situation is, but knows that he will press the button no matter the consequences, simply because it must be pressed. This ends up being a "blessing in disguise" of sorts. While their colony is destroyed, the characters manage to elevate humanity to a greater status in the galaxy.
-   Lampshaded heavily in _Discworld_ where it is explained that no matter what a big red button always attracts attention and that even if you tell everyone the dire consequences of pressing it and putting up a sign to warn them off, someone is going to press it just to see what it does. Especially if they're a wizard.
-   Subverted in _Forever Free_ (sequel of _The Forever War_). While pressing the big red button, the hero wonders how many people guessed that it has absolutely no use, everything being automatic.
-   In _Fortunately, the Milk_, the Really-Good-Moves-Around-in-Time-Machine is activated by pressing a big red button.
-   _The Han Solo Trilogy_: In _The Hutt Gambit_, illusionist Xaverri’s biggest and most risky illusion can be turned on when she hits a large red button on her control panel which had a label in all caps saying no one but her can ever touch it.
-   This was parodied in Douglas Adams' _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. When Arthur Dent encounters an inviting Big Red Button and pushes it, a sign lights up saying "Please do not press this button again." Later in the book, Arthur encounters a different button labeled, "This is probably the best button to press."
-   Subverted in Douglas Adams' _The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul_. Dirk Gently's I Ching calculator is supposed to be able to answer any question by consulting internal references to the I Ching if the user has his question in mind and presses the red button. There is no red button, but there is a blue button marked "red".
-   In _Ready Player One_, whoever controls the OASIS has access to a Big Red Button that will shut it down... permanently.
-   As in the Evil Overlord List, the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ novel _Valhalla_ had Bashir push a big red button on an abandoned alien ship, only to have one of the other characters tell him about a race which wires up its big red obvious buttons to a fatal electric shock to prevent exactly this situation.

    Live-Action TV 

## Game shows

-   The "Deal" button on _Deal or No Deal_ (well, maybe not the button _itself_, but it at least contains a big pulsing red light).
-   _Don't_ has the "Don't Push Button", which increases or halves the contestants' winnings from the current challenge, should they win or lose, if it's pushed beforehand.
-   The button used for the "Cash or Clunkers" game on the current incarnation of _Let's Make a Deal_.
-   _Press Your Luck_ used them to both buzz in when answering questions and stopping the Big Board.
-   _The Price Is Right_ features them in several pricing games, including ten of them serving as the reveal mechanism for "Ten Chances" and the method of stopping the range finder on "Range Game".
-   Later seasons of _Supermarket Sweep_ featured these on the bottom of television monitors located throughout the store; finding one and hitting the button revealed a clue to the bonus item located in the store. (Originally, the monitors were touchscreens.)

## Other shows

-   In the _Arrowverse_ crossover _Crisis on Earth-X_, during the final battle the Waverider engages against its Evil Counterpart Der Wellenreiter, but they're unable to damage it due to having its shields on. Felicity Smoak hacks the shields to override the system and put it on manual control. Once she does, Killer Frost spots the Big Red Button, and even quotes it by name before pushing it to shut the shields down.
-   _The Avengers (1960s)_. In "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Station" the villain proudly shows off the red button that will blow up the railway carriage carrying the Prime Minister of Britain. Later Emma Peel (who wasn't present to hear this) accidentally puts her hand on the button giving everyone an Oh, Crap! moment; fortunately Steed has already disconnected the wires.
-   _Battlestar Galactica_. A red-lit button is used to release the outer doors of the Viper launch bay, as seen in several execution scenes.
-   _Blackadder_. In "Back & Forth" Blackadder tries to stop the time machine and return to the present by hopefully pressing a red button he hadn't pressed before. It turns out to be a lolly.

-   _Danger 5:_ Used to activate Stalin's Doomsday Device, and the Ejection Seats on Danger 5's prop-driven fighter planes.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Genesis of the Daleks": The button to destroy the Kaled dome is a big plastic red button in a totally different aesthetic style to everything else in the story. And it's revealed in dramatic closeup, no less. Mocked enormously in the DVD commentary (Elisabeth Sladen: "It's very Blackpool").
    -   "The Christmas Invasion": The villains have a literal Big Red Button that activates the hostage-killing mechanism. The Doctor presses it himself, citing the allure of Big Red Buttons That Must Never Ever Be Pressed — and reveals that (he had deduced) the threatened hostage-killing mechanism was just a bluff.
    -   "Smith and Jones": Martha is told to activate a radioactive machine to take down one of the slabs. Not knowing how to do that she tries reading the operator's manual, but time being of the essence, eventually gives up and plums for the big yellow button. It works.

    -   "Planet of the Dead": The Doctor tells Christina to deactivate the security forcefield by pressing the big red button (right above the forcefield).
    -   Opposingly, in "The Time of Angels", River Song and the Doctor scramble to drive the wheezing TARDIS in pursuit of another Cool Starship.
        
        **River:** Use the stabilizers!  
        **The Doctor:** I don't have any stabilizers!  
        **River:** The BLUE switches!  
        **The Doctor:** The blue ones don't do anything. They're just... BLUE.  
        **River:** Of course they're BLUE, they're the blue STABILIZERS! _\[pushes buttons, pulls the switches, TARDIS calms down\]_ See?  
        **The Doctor:** Yeah. well, it's just boring now, isn't it? They're boringers, BLUE... _\[presses a bunch of other buttons\]_ ...BORINGERS.
        
    -   In the prequel to "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe", the Doctor is shown with his finger holding down the Big Red Button of a Self-Destruct Mechanism, pondering what's going to happen when (not if) he releases it.
    -   "The Day of the Doctor": The War Doctor complains about dealing with an unintuitive activation mechanism, wondering why he can't just have a big red button. Later, when he makes the decision to activate the Sentient Weapon, it creates one for him in the form of a large glowing red crystal.
-   Douglas Fargo of _Eureka_ is incapable of going by a big red button without pushing it. This has become a running joke.
-   In the live-action cartoon _Far Out Space Nuts_, the main premise was that two bumbling NASA employees were loading astronauts' meals onto spacecraft. They pressed the buttons for "breakfast" and "dinner", but accidentally pressed LAUNCH instead of "lunch", sending the pair out into space.
-   In an episode of _Father Ted_, Dougal is unfortunately confronted with one of these while visiting the cockpit of a jumbo jet. It is not only very Big and very Red but clearly labelled DO _NOT_ PRESS. Unsurprisingly, the rest of the episode deals with the consequences of jettisoning most of the fuel in mid-air.
-   _Firefly_ - the episode "Out of Gas" features a jerry-rigged Big Red Button to call Serenity's shuttles back in the event of a miracle. When Mal gets his miracle, he goes to hit the button, but collapses before he can, though luckily the ships came back anyway. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _The Good Place_: In a far off corner of the Good Place, on an isolated beach, there's a big red button that will kill and reboot Janet. She will lead anyone who asks to it, and the only safety guard is that, as people approach the button, Janet instantly starts begging for her life. She can't actually feel fear, or truly care about her impending destruction, but she's programmed to _act_ that way so people don't push the button without realizing the consequences.
-   _Hey You! What If..._: In "You Could Levitate?", there is a big red button that Ziggy presses repeatedly on the device that allows him to increase the Earth's magnetic field. He keeps pressing it until the Earth's magnetic field is 1,000,000 times stronger.

-   _Odd Squad_:

-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_
        -   Lord Zedd brings out Serpenterra (a spacegoing, _especially_ humongous Humongous Mecha) every so often. The planet-wrecking Wave-Motion Gun was triggered by a Big Red Button.
        -   Played for laughs in The Movie: the Humongous Mecha has a Big Red Button behind a pane of glass that must be broken, with a sign that says "For Emergency Use Only." Turns out it causes the mecha to knee an opponent in the groin.
    -   Played for coolness in _Power Rangers Ninja Storm_: The computer at Ninja Ops has a normal keyboard, with the addition of a huge button with the Wind Ninja Academy logo in red, which Mission Control always jabs emphatically to send the gadget he'd prepared via Rapid-Fire Typing.
-   In an episode of _The Pretender_, Miss Parker and Mr. Lyle are investigating one of Jarod's "lairs" (a shipping container) when they see a Big Red Button with a sign saying "DANGER - DO NOT PUSH" in Jarod's handwriting. Parker tells Lyle not to push it, saying it's probably a trap. Lyle pushes it...and it IS a trap. In the "lair", there's also a red lever marked "DANGER - DO NOT PULL". After the experience with the Big Red Button, Parker is understandably reluctant to pull it...until the container arrives at The Centre and Broots reads a note that tells them to pull the lever. Parker pulls it...and the container unlocks.
-   In _Rudy Coby: The Coolest Magician on Earth_, for the Most Dangerous Card Trick, Rudy wires himself to a "cardboard bomb", which he tells a volunteer to detonate at the "appropriate" time. Detonating it ejects a load of confetti.
-   _Solitary_ is a Reality Show where contestants are eliminated when they are tired of torturing themselves. Guess how they signify this.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   In the _Original Series_ episode "The Doomsday Machine" the button to start the timer to overload the impulse engines on the _Constellation_ is naturally this color.
-   _The Suite Life Movie_ averts this - A Big Red Button is seen as the Big Bad moves to initialize Stage Four of the Gemini Project - only to be pushed aside while a smaller button on a keychain is pushed.
-   _Titans (2018)_. Dr. Adamson is shown threatening the Nuclear Family with a remote detonator.

Miles away the Nuclear Family have red lights appear under the skin of their foreheads, before Your Head Asplode.
-   Derren Brown is a British hypnotist/magician who specialises in messing with other people's minds. In one episode of his _Trick or Treat_ series, he locked a young woman in a room with a Big Red Button which said "Do Not Press". The button was connected to a cage, and in the cage was a cute little kitten. Derren Brown told her that pressing the button would fatally electrocute the kitten, and if she could go for just 5 minutes _without_ pressing the button, she'd get a cool £500. With one second left, she pressed the button. The kitten didn't die, however, as Derren had been lying about that.
-   Episode six of the UK version of _Who Wants to Be a Superhero?_ had a challenge with this labeled "Do not touch", though it didn't actually do anything. Some of the superheroes actually pressed the buttons thinking it was the method to win the challenge (to save the world, or a model of it anyway).
-   _The X-Files_: This was played completely straight, with lots of unintentional humor, in "First Person Shooter", where a video game development company had a literal big red button to erase all data on their computers. In real life people go to great lengths to have backups, especially when developing something as expensive and work-intensive as a game, but apparently in that universe accidental evil Artificial Intelligences with physics-breaking abilities are an ever-present threat that justify installing a big red bankruptcy button.
-   Averted in _Yes, Prime Minister_ where "the button" to launch Britain's nuclear arsenal is actually a telex machine linked to naval headquarters that sends a coded signal to the Polaris submarines, where the actual button is pushed (no mention of what color it is).

    Music 

-   In the end of the "Land of Confusion" music video by Genesis, it is shown that Ronald Reagan had two Big Red Buttons in his bedroom. One was for "NUKE", the other for "NURSE". Guess which one he pressed.
-   "It's a Mistake" by _Men at Work_. A military officer has an ashtray sitting on the control console right next to the red button to fire the nukes, which he unwittingly presses while stubbing out his cigar. This button actually had a mollyguard, but he'd already flipped the cover off without noticing.
-   In the Rush 2010 Time Machine Tour, every show opened with a very funny short video featuring Gershon (Geddy Lee), Slobovitch (Alex Lifeson) and cop O'Malley (Neil Peart). In the video, Herr Slobovitz activates the "Gefilter", a contraption designed to improve the sound of the bar band playing at Gershon's Haus of Sausage. The device has a BIG OL' red button with a TIME MACHINE label, which is accidentally pressed. Watch the results here.

    Pinballs 

-   While it isn't red, the Fire Button in Stern Pinball's _Star Trek_ definitely qualifies. The game even tells you to PUNCH IT! at certain times during the game.

    Print Media 

-   The October 1983 issue of _Fantasy Empire_ featured a _Doctor Who_\-related quiz called "Would You Make a Fit Companion?". Question #41 was:

    A. Yes. It's always been the red one.  
    B. No. I'm colorblind._

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Seasoned Buttoneer is seen pressing a large red button marked DON'T PANIC.
-   _Munchkin_ has "The most fiendish trap of all!" It's this. The problem is, apparently, not pressing it. Everybody who gets it must.
-   _Nuclear War_ comes with printed mats for organising one's cards. They have a flavour illustration of a button, with THE BUTTON - PRESS TO TEST written beneath it.
-   In _Transhuman Space_, the "C-Brown" gardening cybershell (robot body) has large red buttons on the front and back that shut it down instantly. This is because berserk gardener shells attacking with their built-in shears are a popular threat in the setting's fiction, although it's never actually happened.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: In the lore, Ork planes come with one of these by default. It's typically labelled something like GO and it starts the engine without any need for the boring and useless preflight checks that more cowardly species than Orks insist on doing for some reason.

    Theme Parks 

-   In _Men in Black: Alien Attack_ at Universal Studios Florida, each vehicle has a red button, which guests are told to only press in "emergency situations", as it will unleash a massive explosion that can destroy any alien adversary.

    Video Games

-   In _Batman: Arkham Knight_, The Riddler put an Explosive Leash on Catwoman to force Batman to participate in his latest challenges.

He then feels the need to clarify that it didn't _need_ to be (he is intelligent enough to remember which button does what thank you), but he couldn't resist.
-   In _Battlefleet Gothic: Armada_, all of the four races have a speed boost on their ships. The Orkish speed boost takes the form of a big red button that gives the ship much more massive speed boost than that of either of the two human factions, and can't be shut off until it runs out of fuel.
-   _Blasto_:
    -   Pressing a large button with the sign "Do Not Press" displayed above it will result in Blasto getting disintegrated by a lightning bolt.
    -   In a slightly later section of the game, a second, identical button is encountered, with the same "Do Not Press" sign. If, against all logic, you fall for the same trick and press this one... a bunch of health and power-ups spawn nearby.
-   Comically obvious in _Brain Dead 13_, which has a huge and very convenient self destruct button sitting on the Big Bad's doomsday device.
-   German-made point & click adventure game _Chewy: Escape From F5_ has a room on the Borx' spaceship where there's just a button on a wall marked "Press this button". Doing so drops a giant anvil on top of Chewy. You later paint the extra word "DON'T" on the wall to compel a Bork guard to press it as well.
-   In _Conker's Bad Fur Day_, the weak point of the Haybot boss is a Big Red Button on his back.
-   The execution button pushed by Monokuma in _Danganronpa_ is one of these. Positively exhilarating for him to push, and absolutely horrific for whichever unlucky student is about to receive that execution.
-   _Daxter_: Kaeden presses one of these to destroy the Kridder Ridder building after finding a bug in there (Daxter’s friend Tik, if you’re wondering) and squishing it to death.

-   In _Evil Genius_, one can be used as a Death Trap. Popping up out of the ground with a big sign that says "Do Not Press", it compels low-willpower enemy agents to press it anyway, giving them a shock. The final mission also adds a big red "Launch" button to the main interface when it is complete; pushing this one activates your Doomsday Device and ends the game.
-   In _The Fairly OddParents: Shadow Showdown_, pressing these is how you cause changes in the levels to happen so that they become possible to clear, and also how you save your game.
-   _Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft_: "Dr. Boom, Mad Genius" is a Warrior hero card that switches your Hero Power to "Big Red Button", which swaps between one of five effects every turn: Deal 3 damage, gain 7 Armor, deal 1 damage to all enemies, summon 3 1/1 Microbots with Rush, and Discover a Mech card. The idea is that he wired all these functions into one button without bothering to test it.
-   In _Hitman 2_, pressing a Big Red Button is required to open the vault in "The Golden Handshake"<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> . Deactivating the security locks protecting the button in order to press it is a multi-step process.
-   _Into the Breach_: The Self-Destruct weapon, which instantly destroys a mech and everything around it, is displayed as a red button with yellow and black hazard stripes around it.
-   _Invasion: The Abductors_: The buttons to disengage the cargo pod from the alien mothership are massive (As in, given the scale, they're probably the size of a car at _least_) green buttons that you shoot to activate. Which turns them red.
-   _The Jackbox Party Pack 6_: The eponymous button in "Push the Button" is a big red button at the bottom of your playscreen. If a player thinks they know who the alien(s) are (or an alien player thinks they've sown enough distrust to trick the other players), they can hold down the button in order to pick players to be Thrown Out the Airlock, which the other players will have to vote on unanimously.
-   _Liberal Crime Squad_ allows you to push a "big red button" in a nuclear power plant to release waste into the environment. The catch is you need a character with the right skill to push the big red button.
-   _Lobotomy Corporation_ has "Don't Touch Me", which is a button that has dire consequences for pressing it.
-   _Maniac Mansion_ has a Big Red Button at the bottom of the pool, with the warning "Do not press!" written above. You just had to find out what the button did, and ended up detonating the mansion in the process.
-   _Mass Effect_ has no actual buttons but lampshades this trope anyway if Tali is in the party on Noveria. When Mira is explaining the neutron purge, Tali will provide immortal line:
    
    **Tali** "Don't press big red buttons."
    
    -   _Mass Effect: Andromeda_ _does_ have a Big Red Button, in the Collective Base on Kadara, which you are advised not to push. Repeatedly. Go ahead. It's broken.
-   _Modern Warfare 2_'s Museum level (A couple rooms with museum-style setpieces of all the levels) has two Big Red Buttons on the desks in the entrances of the rooms. Going up to them brings up a prompt "DO NOT press x". Doing so causes the enemies to attack en masse.
-   The final level of _Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus_ has a sign on the SoulStorm Brewery main boiler control panel that reads "ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NEVER EVER TURN THIS WHEEL!" Guess what your objective is.
    -   The previous game, Abe's Oddysee, has a button labeled Do Not Push. You can choose not to push that button if you want, you just miss a short cutscene.
        -   One of the games has a lever with an LCD marquee behind it that reads "Only a fool or a murderer will pull this lever." Pulling the lever will kill the slave next to you if you didn't rescue him first.
-   _Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening_ gets the game rolling with this trope. The titular protagonist pays a visit to the factory that apparently is responsible for the world's weather, with the intent to stop the thunderstorms that have been creeping him out so much. He gets an explanation that enlightens his viewpoint almost right off the bat, but he trips on his cape, causing him to fly into and press a giant red button on the control panel; said button inexplicably causes partial destruction of the factory. Sam ends up with the responsibility of locating the missing parts, a task that covers the rest of the game.
-   _Pandemonium! (1996)_: In the level "Fantabulous", there exists a button (though green) with **"Press this button"** printed above it. Kicking the button triggers an alarm and flashing red lights, the camera pans up to see **"DON'T!"** spray-painted in red above it, and the air station proceeds to count a self-destruct. The button turns red. Pressing this button is a must anyway, as it opens a path to escape the air station.
-   _Please, Don't Touch Anything_ has you in an empty room with a big red button and a monitor of a large city. You can guess what happens when you start messing with stuff.
-   In _Pokémon Red and Blue_, the player is prompted as to whether or not he wants to push the buttons he finds in Team Rocket's hideout. Choosing "Yes" makes the game reply, "Who wouldn't?"
-   Played straight in _Pokémon X and Y_. In Team Flare's lab, the player is given a choice of two buttons. The blue one deactivates the ultimate weapon, while the red one (obviously) activates it. However, even if you press the blue one, they activate it anyway.
-   _Portal_ has the "Fifteen Hundred Megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button". The biggest red button ever, and generally used in combination with the Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube to solve puzzles. There are also small red buttons that function as switches.
-   _Portal 2_, in addition to the above, has various highly prominent red buttons in the areas outside the test environments. They operate whatever key piece of machinery you need to resolve the current puzzle. The Old Aperture test chambers also feature a version of the Super Button with a retro 50's look.
-   _Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon_ has the Big Red LEVER - at the beginning of the game, there's a DO NOT TOUCH sign with a lever in front of it. Once a butterfly lands on it, Pep sees it and jumps for it, only to land on the lever and pull it, causing the fireworks factory to go haywire. This summons a rocket that carries Putt-Putt into space and eventually landing on the moon.
-   _Ratchet & Clank (2002)_ had a level that took place in a spaceship. On the console in the bridge is a big red button. What makes this more notable than most is the fact that the Action Command when you approach it is, word for word, "Press the big red shiny button?" It's the self-destruct. It's also a Shout-Out, and proves that the Insomniacs watched _The Ren & Stimpy Show_.
-   In _Sins of a Solar Empire_, the TEC Starbase can be upgraded to have the big red button. With the second level of this, the starbase explodes in a sizable area (More than the range of most attackers), causing enough damage to kill all but high leveled, full HP capital ships.
-   In _Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing_, Eggman activates his All-Star move with one of these. The announcer even references this trope. "Watch out, everyone! Eggman's pushed his Big Red Button!"

    **Tychus:** "Oookay, big red button, what do you do?" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>   
    **Tychus:** "Now how'd I miss this pretty little button with the _skull_ on it?" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
-   The plot of _Stay Tooned!_ gets kicked off when the player pushes a red button on their remote control, which many of the Toons warn you not to push. Doing so causes the toons to jump out of your TV and steal the remote, "tooning" the apartment building you're in while this happens. Naturally, the goal is to find the remote and send the Toons back home.
-   _Steel Battalion_ has a Big Red Button with a flip-up plastic cover and yellow diagonal stripes to trigger the Ejection Seat. Failing to use it before your VT explodes or floods will result in _a deleted save game._
-   You don't get to actually see it, but a recurring joke is that your shipyard in _Sunshine Heavy Industries_ has a big red button that Selene claims is either the airlock or the self-destruct. When you throw the pirates out of your station, it turns out it's the airlock. It comes up again when a crewmate from _Among Us_ shows up for a cameo, and presses it instinctively and blames Pink once you've finished building a ship for him.
-   _Twin Robots_: The first objective in each level is to push the big red button, which will deactivate the trash compactor and open the door to let the trapped robot out.
-   _Wasteland 2_ has a big red button that, when pressed, causes the screen to shake. It opens up another area, with a man named Aaron Chewitt and another button. Pressing this button causes Aaron to panic but does nothing else. The entire thing is a pun - Aaron Chewitt is the real name of comedian Red Buttons.
-   _Whacked!_ has these, which causes various things to happen. The world turns upside-down, zombie stars attack everyone, everyone's vision gets distorted, all weapons disappear, etc.
-   In _Whizz_, each level has several red buttons on the ground that launch nearby rockets when pressed.
-   The sandbox in _World of Goo_ can be reset with one of these, molly-guard included.
-   _World of Warcraft_:
    -   In the Ulduar raid dungeon, mechagnome boss Mimiron has one of these, conveniently labeled "DO NOT PRESS THIS BUTTON", that sets off his lair's self destruct mechanism. If you defeat him after activating it, you get more loot. However, it also covers half the room with fire, causes him to go into a frenzy that increases the damage of all of his attacks, gives him several methods of combating said fires that also hurt you if you happen to be in the wrong place, and finally, places a timer on how long you have to kill him before the room goes kablooey. Good luck. He's not happy about it, either.
    -   There's another one in a newbie questchain for goblins to destroy an oil rig. Oh, and this button is VERY BIG! (Also very red. And the character comments on it.)

    Visual Novels 

-   _Zero Time Dilemma_ has one of these as a round in the decision game. Stuck inside the healing room, Sigma, Phi, and Diana come across a big button with "Warning: Do not touch this button" flashing around it. While Phi's of the opinion that they obviously shouldn't press it, Sigma's persistent about doing the opposite of what Zero's telling them to do. It's ultimately up to Diana, aka the player, to decide whether to press it. Pressing the button results in the entire facility blowing up. Wait for around a minute, and the room's door unlocks letting the three get out.

    Web Animation 

-   _The Demented Cartoon Movie_ has a whole bunch of Big Red Buttons, most of which cause Stuff Blowing Up. One of the two that blows up the world is clearly labeled with a picture of an Earth-Shattering Kaboom (and Blah Guy presses it anyway), and the other is unseen because "the animator got lazy."
-   _Ducktalez 3_: In the cockpit of Robot Christopher Walken. Scrooge pressed it when the Cornmander got angry at him. It activated the secret move that finished off Vegeta.

-   _The Most Epic Story Ever Told in All of Human History_: Ridiculously Epic Fail launches himself into a big red button that causes it to rain adorable kittens and sunshine. Considering his goal was to cause chaos, this big red button accomplished the exact opposite of what he wanted.
-   Subverted in _Steve And Carlos_ where Carlos leads Steve to believe he's fallen for this trope, when really the big red button he pushed was the fire alarm.

    **Voice message:** ...real evil labs don't have self-destruct systems in their control room. What are you, stupid?
    
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_, Bob encounters a Big Red Button _so big_ he has to jump up and down on it to activate it.

-   One _Keiki_ comic had a red button that Amara's father had to push every 108 minutes, or else Hawaii might explode, a la _Lost_. When Amara got left to watch the button alone, she failed to press it quickly enough after the third time 108 minutes passed, but Hawaii still didn't explode. Her father subsequently claimed this did _not_ confirm the possibility that the button actually had no connection to Hawaii's safety, since "it gives you a couple extra minutes."
-   BIP in _Little Robot, Big Scary World_ is assigned to push one of these, and soon questions the monotony of this kind of life.
-   In this _Schlock Mercenary_ strip and the couple that follow, the team discusses putting big red buttons on demolition charges.
-   From the always-surreal _The Unfeasible Adventures of Beaver and Steve_: in this installment of the story arc, "The Revenge of the Shoe Goblin", the day seems to have been anti-climactically saved... but then Steve spots a Big Red Button marked "Self-Destruct Mechanism, for use only in case of anti-climax"... and the inevitable happens, with the result that planet Earth gets stomped by a size 6 billion shoe, and humanity is wiped out. _Again._ Thanks a lot, Steve.
-   In _S.S.D.D._ the fission reactor on the _Britannia_ had a "scram" button that stopped it dead, unfortunately the Inlay that sabotaged it ripped that button out before the protagonists had the chance to press it.
-   In _Tiny Raygun_, Nepta's ship has one presumably for achieving Faster-Than-Light Travel, helpfully labeled "Faster".
-   In _The Whiteboard_, Roger stumbles across one of these (aptly labeled "For the love of God, do **NOT** press this button!") in Doc's shop. He can't stop pressing it, with various responses suggested by TWB fans. It makes a return as a last ditch effort to change Doc and Roger back to themselves after launching fireworks.
-   In this _xkcd_ comic, it shows that given the consequences for pulling the big lever, a regular person will learn not to pull it. An engineer or scientist on the other hand will pull it again, ostensibly to learn whether it happens every time.

-   Invoked in _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_ when Frylock fiddles with the control panel of the Plutonians' spaceship to try to beam himself back to Earth.

-   In _Batman Beyond_, Bruce has a big red button to remotely shut down the Batsuit in case it ever ended up in the wrong hands. He uses it in the two-part pilot episode "Rebirth" after Terry steals the suit, and again in "Lost Soul" to freeze the suit after it is taken over by a hostile AI.
-   _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_: The Joker gets to ride in the Batmobile during an Enemy Mine, and is in full What Does This Button Do? mode, with Batman repeatedly telling him not to touch anything. He spots a Big Red Button, which Batman warns him he _really_ doesn't want to touch. He touches it — and gets hit in the face with knock-out gas. It's like Bats read the Evil Overlord List example at the top of the page and made it non-lethal. The Joker highlights this trope again during The Teaser, only this time it's a Self-Destruct Mechanism, which results in an Earth-Shattering Kaboom.
-   _Bonkers_ lampshaded this trope after a criminal toon told Bonkers not to push a very obviously hazardous-to-himself-and-his-human-partner big shiny red button, citing that it's a built-in rule for cartoon characters to push big red buttons once it's pointed out - making it a literal Rule of Funny.
-   In _Dexter's Laboratory_, Dee Dee is fond of pushing the Big Red Button that will wreck one of Dexter's inventions or otherwise cause trouble. A vapid "Oooh! What Does This Button Do?" became her main catchphrase. One would think that eventually, Dex would learn to stop putting Big Red Buttons on everything he builds.
-   From the _Donkey Kong Country_ episode "The Big Chill Out":
    
    **K. Rool:** With my KCCBM, we'll be up to our tails in Coconut Chills before you can say "Blast off!"  
    _\[Klump pushes the big red button and launches the KCCBM\]_  
    **Kritters:** Hooray!!  
    **K. Rool:** _I_ wanted to push the big red button!!  
    **Klump:** But you said "blast off" and I didn't get to say anything!
    
-   Parodied in _Family Guy_; Peter finds himself in front of a big red button with accompanying sign reading "Do not press this button". When he presses it, the only observable result is an elderly Asian black belt who enters the room, bows to Peter, and then roundhouse kicks him in the face.
-   An episode of _Gerald McBoing-Boing_ has the family buy a car. Gerald's dad sees the car has a big red button (alright it wasn't that big but it was red) in the car and presses it, activating an ejector seat.
-   _The Herculoids_: In the episode "Malak and the Metal Apes", Zandor sneaks into Malak's base inside one of the Metal Apes (robots). When he reveals himself, Malak orders his henchman to push a red button to activate the Ape's Self-Destruct Mechanism and destroy him.
-   _Invader Zim_:
    -   Parodied. Dib asks, "How'd I miss that??
    -   The Megadoomer's self-destruct button was also a Big Red Button with a crazy smiley face on it.
-   _Johnny Bravo_: In the episode "Bootman", Johnny ends up on the space station headquarters of the Astounding League of Super People, and is tempted by a big red button.
-   In the _Jonny Quest_ episode "The Robot Spy", the duty officer of an Air Force base pushes such a button to call a Red Alert and scramble jet fighters.
-   In one episode of _Johnny Test,_ Dukey tries to constantly edge Johnny _away_ from pushing said button, mainly because more often than not, said Big Red Button tends to cause the trouble that they have to stop. This is the one time where pushing the red button actually saves the day.
-   _Kaeloo_: Olaf's lair has one, and Stumpy pushes it despite Olaf telling him not to.
-   _Kim Possible_:
    -   One of Dr. Drakken's temporary lairs includes one of these, which Shego gleefully employes.
    -   In the series finale:
        
        **Drakken:** Oh! This is highly advanced alien technology! It's not going to be as simple as finding an... _\[Rufus finds the off switch and switches it to the off position; the noise suddenly quiets down and goes away\]_ ...off switch... mmmmmmmhhh...  
        _\[Rufus just snickers; the ship begins to lose power and fall to earth; the scene switches to the ship's bridge\]_  
        **Warmonga:** Oh! What madness is this?  
        **Warhok:** They found the off switch!  
        **Warmonga:** Ugh! Long have I questioned the wisdom of that accursed switch!
        
-   _Looney Tunes_: In "Design for Leaving", Daffy Duck equips Elmer Fudd's home with "time-saving gadgets" operated from a push-button control panel. The panel includes one Big Red Button which Daffy warns him to never touch. At the end of the cartoon, curiosity gets the better of Elmer and he pushes it. A display lights up reading "IN CASE OF TIDAL WAVE", and the entire house rises up hundreds of feet over the ground. Daffy arrives by helicopter and says "For a small price, I can install this little blue button to get you down."
-   In _Madballs: Escape from Orb_, Freakella correctly guesses that this is the button to press in order to start Aargh and Slobulous's ship:
-   _Megas XLR_.
    -   Coop's Big Red Button. Its label and effect would change depending on the situation, like when Coop yells "Maybe you'll like this better, then!", the button is _actually labeled_ "This Better Then". He even has a button labeled "Big Red Button of Irony".
    -   A couple episodes draw attention to this, in fact. One episode had the button marked "Five Minutes Until End of Episode," activating a brand-new power that saves the day.
    -   Another episode had Coop use it _twice_, for two different results. The second time, it's labeled "The Exact Same Button Coop Used Like Five Minutes Ago."
    -   And then there's "The Button That Does The Same Thing As The Other Button" button.
    -   Still better, Megas does, in fact, have a "Save the World" button (right under "Destroy the World", "Smite the World", and "Destroy the World Worse".) But it's been removed.
    -   He also has a button that is simply titled "The Button", which has the following warning posted around it: "Danger", "Do Not Touch", "This Means You!", and "Never ever press!". Said button launches an arsenal of nukes from Megas, though Kiva stops him from using it (to which he replies "What's the point of having nukes if I never get to use them?")
-   _The Owl House_: In "Enchanting Grom Fright", Luz pokes around in the Hexside gym while they're setting up for Grom. There, she sees a big red button on a plinth and gleefully gives in to the temptation to press it. It reveals an arena hidden under the gym and racks of weapons, and while Luz thinks they're just more decorations ("Medieval torture seems like a weird theme for Grom, but... eh!") it turns out they're part of a ritual where the Grom Royalty has to fight a ferocious monster.
-   Played with quite elaborately in _The Penguins of Madagascar_ episode "Tagged." While confined due to electronic bracelets, the penguins enlist the lemurs' help in fixing a heating/cooling unit that they had started to work on before being confined. Seven buttons appear before the three lemurs, each button an almost-imperceptible shade of red (ruby, brick, crimson, scarlet, etc.). Kowalski instructs the lemurs that they are supposed to press _only_ the scarlet button, which leads to King Julien and Maurice arguing over which one is scarlet. King Julien starts to play eenie-meenie-minie-moe, until Mort, The Chew Toy of the group, pads up and presses a button at random. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_:
    -   Used in every episode by Dr. Doofensmirtz, to the point that in one episode, he laments "Someone always finds my self-destruct button."
    -   In "Hail Doofania!", Phineas and Ferb build a big red self-destruct button on their rainbow generator. Naturally, it gets activated, which prompts Ferb to comment, "In hindsight, I question the logistics of including a self-destruct button in the first place."
-   The indie computer-animation short _Pigeon: Impossible_ involves a bird falling into a suitcase containing a Big Red Button (among other spy gadgets). The pigeon taps it, but doesn't fully press the button, only for the CIA agent to accidentally do so, whereupon the Washington Monument turns into a nuclear missile launcher.
-   In an episode of _The Problem Solverz_, there is a magic clock with a red button on it that is capable of ripping a hole in the fabric of the space-time continuum. Naturally, crazy fangirl Katrina Rad steals the clock and threatens to press the button if Roba doesn't marry her.
-   _The Ren & Stimpy Show_:
-   Both _Road Rovers_ ' first and last episodes had Colleen pushing a not-exactly-Big Red Button on a vehicle dashboard causing it to go ludicrously fast.
-   In the _Rocko's Modern Life_ episode "Power Trip", Rocko's Bad Boss, Mr. Smitty, goes out of town for a hair transplant, and leaves Rocko (his only employee) in charge, giving him the keys to the manager's office. He cryptically warns Rocko "Don't touch the green button." Rocko gets into the manager's office, and enjoys playing around with all the functions on Mr. Smitty's chair. He presses a pink button, which plays music and makes bubbles... and finds himself tempted by The Green Button. He decides to chance it and presses it. It starts off as an intense massage function... but it eventually causes Rocko to turn into a Bad Boss just like Mr. Smitty.
-   _The Simpsons_: In "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming", Sideshow Bob hooks an atomic bomb up to one of these. Lisa and Bart barges in as he is tracing his finger around the button. Lisa objects, saying: "Don't you see? That would be taking the easy way out!", to which he replies "I agree!" and presses it. The bomb turns out to be a dud.
-   Lampshaded in _Spider-Man: The Animated Series_: Spider-man points the big red button they must press to save the day. Why? Because in films, it's always the big red one.
-   In the _Star Trek: The Animated Series_ episode "Beyond the Farthest Star", the auxiliary warp drive controls are activated with a red button. Kirk presses it to send the Enterprise on a desperate slingshot maneuver to escape the dead star's gravity and get rid of the alien intruder.
-   _Superman: The Animated Series_: In "World's Finest", the Joker is flying Lex Luthor's jet and trying to shoot down the heroes. He asks Lex (whom he has tied up and is about to murder) for help:
    
    **Lex:** It's a _red_ switch.  
    **Joker:** _\[looks at a panel_ full _of red switches\]_ But which... aw, the heck with it! _\[pushes_ all _of them\]_
    
-   Subverted in _VeggieTales_. Bob and Larry are chasing after Madame Blueberry in a motorized shopping cart, and Bob asks "Can't this thing go any faster?" Right on cue, the big red button starts blinking. Bob pushes it and then flinches, expecting something incredible to happen. Instead, it prints a coupon.
-   In an episode of _Watch My Chops_, when Bernie has to demonstrate a hydrogen fuel machine that's controlled with multiple buttons, Corneil states to Bernie the machine activates with the white button and warns him to never press the purple button. Unsurprisingly, Bernie screws up the demonstration, claiming the machine is flawed and proceeds to press the purple button, blowing the machine and demolishing much of the school.
-   _Work It Out Wombats!_: In "Secret Tunnels," Zeke finds a big red button in the secret tunnels, but Super tells him not to touch it, since it will melt everyone's ice cream.
-   In the _Young Samson and Goliath_ episode "The Dome", the title villain tries to push a red button that will launch nuclear missiles against six targets, but Samson has Goliath destroy the button with his power beams.

    Real Life 

-   British artist Damien Hirst has spoken of an exhibition he will never be allowed to mount: it would consist of a big red button and a "Do Not Press" sign. If anyone did give in and press it, a boxing glove would come out and punch them in the face.
-   When color programming was introduced in German television, there was an actual big red button that the Chancellor of Germany was supposed to push in order to switch on the new technology. The technicians behind the scenes were a little trigger-happy and turned on colour transmission shortly before he actually pushed it, ruining the effect... for those few people who actually had color TV sets at that time. (Video in colour, complete with early switch-on)
-   The New York Stock Exchange has a Big Green Button that triggers the bells that signal the opening and closing of business. The Exchange invites guests to press the button almost every business day. Guests include representatives of corporations on the company's first trading day, political officials and foreign dignitaries.
-   For a 2009 diplomatic visit to Russia, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton brought a big red reset button (connected to nothing) that she would offer for a Russian official to push, symbolically forgiving previous tensions. It was hillariously screwed up, as the button was supposed to be labeled "Перезагрузка" (Reload, as in reload Russian/USA relations), but was instead labeled "Перегрузка" (Overload).
-   Most modern elevators have a Big Red Button, which may be an emergency stop or a fire alarm. Surprisingly, most elevator riders seem to be able to keep their hands off it.
-   Parodied in the European Nuclear Research Center CERN, of all places. The experiment station Atlas's control room has a big red button placed in the anteroom, labelled: "Your Unique Chance to Press an Emergency Button!" When pressed, the only thing that happens is that the screen above the button switches on and you get a lecture.
-   Cars:
    -   The four-way hazard warning flashers. On European cars it's a Big Red Button going back as far as The '60s, but on most American ones from before The '90s it's hidden on the underside of the steering column for some reason.
-   Many cars modified for racing are equipped with an externally accessible kill switch, so safety crews can shut the engine down from outside the car in the event of a serious crash or emergency. Many drivers hide them behind the car's rear license plate; the plate can be removed while the car is racing, so the button is accessible, but when the car is on the road, the license plate is attached and the button is hidden away.
    -   Also many sports cars have, instead of a key ignition, a Start/Stop button. Not exactly huge, but usually larger than the rest of the buttons and most often red, a more direct application of this trope.
    -   Buses and coaches that have the engine in the back of the bus also have a big red button (or rather, a switch) in the engine compartment for the purposes of starting or stopping engine, and preventing the engine from being started with the key in the front while the engine is being operated on.
    -   On June 24, 2014, engineers from Carnegie Mellon University put on a demonstration of a prototype self-driving car in Washington D.C. The demo ended before it began when one of the VIP guests (Elanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting "Delegate" to the House of Representatives) pushed the big red "Emergency Stop" button and knocked the car's systems completely off-line.
-   The Dave Smith Instruments synth module, the Mopho, has a "Push It!" button, described on the site as " a manual trigger that lets you play a specific note or latch notes and sequences on. It can also step through a sequence to play short melodic lines without a keyboard."
-   Speaking of synths, Waldorf's trademark design element was a Big Red Knob for data entry. This tradition wasn't dropped before the Blofeld.
-   A Big Red Button control for model trains was invented by veteran rocker and model train enthusiast Neil Young. It was designed to let his quadriplegic son Ben run the family's 750-foot railway by himself.
-   There was an experiment a few years back. The subject would be locked in a room for 5 or 10 minutes with a Big Red Button. If they managed to go the whole time without pressing it, they'd get $1000. Nobody made it. The closest pressed the button with about 20 seconds left.
-   Many IT datacenters contain Big Red Buttons for various purposes, usually for the purposes of cutting power (in a disorderly fashion) to all computer systems, or engaging the fire suppression system. These typically are behind some sort of safety cover, and contain signage stating something like "Emergency power off," "Halon" (in the old days), or something to that effect. There was one datacenter where the button had a sign reading "Resumé button," as in "Have your resumé ready." Supposedly, after several unplanned shutdown incidents when giving tours, one mainframe operator put a nice Big Red Button, at kid height. One kid pressed the button and stood there, shaking in fear. All the button did was light up a small sign which said "Release button to cause explosion."
-   In industries that use a good deal of automation Big Red Buttons exist as emergency shutdowns. Most have some protection over the button, and are commonly called clown noses because people really want to punch them. But since they are an emergency shutdown, they take a while to start back up and can get expensive. Very Expensive.
-   Often large pieces of machinery and heavy equipment will have one, such as forklifts. They're usually emergency shutdowns.
-   Escalators. The emergency stop buttons are very attractive to some people.
-   The Color Computer's keyboard<small>◊</small> had a bright red button in the upper right corner ominously labeled "Break". Unaware users would avoid it like the plague. Some later models relabeled the key "ESC/Break" to better explain its functionality.
-   Most industrial machines actually do have a Big Red Button as mandated by safety laws. It's usually just an emergency shut down button though, not a explosive self-destruct button.
-   The IBM PC/AT desktop model had the power supply controlled by a Big Red Knife Switch set in a panel towards the back of the machine.
-   The BBC wanted to know the date when the Large Hadron Collider would be switched on. There isn't really any one moment - different parts of the complex came into operation and were being tested at different times - but the project leaders decided the nearest thing was September 10 2008, when the first test involving a particle beam completing one circuit of the whole ring. The BBC excitedly named September 10 "Big Bang Day", planned a whole day of programming, and asked to take footage of the LHC being "switched on". The tests were all pre-programmed and controlled by computers, and the scientists just watched the results coming in - exciting to those in the know, but not what the BBC wanted. The BBC asked if they could build a fake button on a wall, and film somebody pressing it. The bemused scientists at CERN started referring to September 10 as "Big Red Button day".
-   The café in the National Space Centre in Leicester, UK has a couple of full sized rockets hanging down from the floors above. Underneath one of the rockets is a normal café table with a Big Red Button in the middle saying "Do Not Press". When the button is inevitably pressed, a countdown starts which then turns into a rocket takeoff sound with dry ice spraying from the bottom of the rocket that makes it look like it's about to liftoff. This can make for some interesting mealtimes when pressed by someone currently at the table eating lunch.
-   Lampshaded and averted in this tour of a former missile silo in Ukraine, where it's noted that the button to launch the nuclear missiles is actually grey.
-   When British TV went digital, BBC channels had a "Red Button" function which would load additional content (such as news headlines) when users pressed the Red Button on their remote control. After one of the early North Korean nuclear tests, while the BBC News 24 channel was reporting on the event, a message appeared on screen saying "Press Red Button to learn more about the outcome of the North Korean nuclear test." Not surprisingly, some viewers were _very reluctant_ to push it!
