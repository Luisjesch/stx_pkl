Illinois Nazis. We _hate_ Illinois Nazis!

_Ven der Fuehrer says, "Ve ist der Master Race",  
Ve_ **Heil!** \*raspberry\* **Heil!** \*raspberry\* _right in der Fuehrer's face!  
Not to love der Fuehrer ist a great disgrace,  
So ve_ **Heil!** \*raspberry\* **Heil!** \*raspberry\* _right in der Fuehrer's face!_

Those Wacky Nazis covers a variety of Nazi stereotypes.

Before we get on with the list, we suggest you take a look at Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, World War II, Ghostapo, The Holocaust, We Didn't Start the Führer, and Stupid Jetpack Hitler. And, by way of contrast, All Germans Are Nazis and A Nazi by Any Other Name.

    Character types 

-   The cultured one who stands around in vest, braces and lederhosen listening to classical music (usually Richard Wagner) on a gramophone and admiring all his stolen art, who says "You see, Herr Captain, ve are not all animals."
-   The loud one who is usually on the phone shouting "Get me ze Führer!".
-   The pervy, leather-coated Gestapo officer who is _super-creepy_ and maybe even Camp Gay; possibly inspired by Ernst Röhm and many of the high-ranking members of the SA, Hitler's original personal guard. By the time of their destruction on Hitler's orders, the SA was populated by numerous homosexuals or suspected homosexuals. Also possibly inspired by Hermann Göring, whose appearance was evidently rather campy.
-   The tight-assed Obstructive Bureaucrat who goes through the trouble of donning his entire uniform - including jodhpurs and Wellington boots - before talking to someone (even if said someone is on the phone and unable to see what he is wearing). Ends every conversation with a "Heil Hitler!" and a loud click of his heels.
-   The round-spectacled, black-gloved, sadistic torture master who emits a shrill giddy laugh after every sentence. May or may not overlap with the "perverted Nazi" above.
-   A female officer in the mold of The Baroness. In more salacious productions she'll be a sadistic dominatrix who tortures prisoners and forces them to perform sex acts for her own (and presumably, the audience's) amusement.
-   The older German who wishes Germany was still Imperial Germany. He is constantly saying "This is not the Germany I fought for in the Great War," and has an old war medal.
-   A bumbling Luftwaffe sergeant in direct charge of the American prisoners of war. May or may not be more devious than he appears. May have visited an American city at one point; if he did, he claims to have loved it ("I vas in New York, you know. I love the US! Vhen ze var is over, ve vill all be friends.") The cultured one above may do the same with fond memories of London, and hopes to pick up friendships in Britain once this dreadful business is over. Just don't expect either to feel anything less than genocidal about the Russians and other Soviet people when you bring them up.
-   The officer with a conscience, usually based on Erwin Rommel, so probably a bit of a Magnificent Bastard. Tries to convince himself it's all about My Country, Right or Wrong, and serves as a Worthy Opponent to Allied heroes. Often A Father to His Men. May have a full-on Heel–Face Turn, or else get a tragic death at the hands of his own superiors for his conscience.
-   The Nazi who joined the party/SS/army to get the chance to kill people for fun. May not even care about race, killing is all that matters. The slightest provocation (or none at all) means certain death for prisoners and civilians. Possibly modelled after real life sadist and Nazi SS officer Josef Blösche aka "Frankenstein", who killed over 2,000 noncombatants on his own.
-   The "Oskar Schindler" type — the guy who really has a heart of gold and works to save the Jewish people and others who have fallen into the Nazis' hands or works alongside La Résistance, a la _'Allo 'Allo!_ The civilian version of the Erwin Rommel type above.
-   The "I'm just a soldier doing my job" Nazi, either regular military officer or SS, who feels My Country, Right or Wrong.
-   The teenaged grunt who often finds himself in way over his head. Probably gets killed by the Allied soldiers, who lament the death of one so young.
-   The mindless drone who simply does what he is told out of ignorance and lack of ambition. This stereotype isn't completely unfounded because German soldiers in WWII were trained to be extremely obedient, sometimes to a fault because they would at times not act unless given orders. That said, it's not much comfort given that Wehrmacht war crimes (with the partial exception of the hundreds of thousands of instances of sexual assault) were usually the result of explicit orders from officers.
    -   Sub-trope: the blond and innocent-looking young recruit able to do the worst atrocities without slightest flinching, like a perfect robot. Common in Sven Hassel novels. Possibly inspired by the later war SS recruits subject to Training from Hell, from the 12th SS Division _Hitlerjugend_.
-   The mindless drone who does anything he is told, with a certain lack of ignorance but _not_ ambition.
-   The Nazi Nobleman with a fancy aristocratic title and ancestral castle; who may overlap with any of these.
-   The Mad Scientist or Deadly Doctor type who just loves cutting people open For Science! or just for the sheer hell of it, with science and medicine as a thinly veiled excuse, as was evidenced by those prisoners who had the misfortune to have to work for Josef Mengele. They may be researching immortality, or racial purity, or creating Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot Nazis. They may well posess a Morally Ambiguous Doctorate, and be Herr Doktor.
-   The sleazeball Nazi. This guy didn't join up because he believed in the cause or wanted an excuse to kill people, he joined up to take advantage of all the opportunities for looting, graft and partying that go with a victorious war. Generally found somewhere comfortable in France, Italy, or the main German Reich, taking a cut of every legal or illegal business that he can force or ooze his way into, getting high off morphine and speed intended to keep the armed forces going, and enjoying his private collection of priceless artworks that belonged to people who were "deported to the East" or had to leave in a hurry. If he isn't a complete monster, his sexual debaucheries will involve ladies who were already High Class Call Girls and will be genuinely rewarded for their devotion. If he _is_ a complete monster... let's not get into that. Generally inspired to some degree by crooked, drug-addicted, art-collecting Fat Bastard Hermann Goering or grasping, self-indulgent German ambassador to Vichy France Otto Abetz (yes, the great-uncle of Australian senator Eric). Expect him to be killed by the people he wronged, or executed for ripping off the Reich.
-   The aging (but evil) senior officer with cadaverous features, usually an SS member to link his skull-like visage with the death's head motif. Will normally be combined with one of the roles above, or feature in a minor role as a visitor from Berlin here to remind the Big Bad that "Zer Führer is not patient, he expects _results_". Partially based on SS-Oberführer Dr. Oskar Dirlewanger, whose physical features<small>◊</small> matched the description 100% and whose job was anti-partisan combat. The abysmal performance of his unit was the only thing which limited his ability to do even _more_ evil.

There were many branches of the Nazi military, each associated with the above subtropes to a varying degree. Most of the more evil, sinister Nazi archetypes tend to belong to the **Schutzstaffel** (SS), one of the Nazi party's paramilitaries (and the ones who ran the concentration camps). SS members are immediately recognizable by their ominous all-black uniforms (which were only dress uniforms; in the field, they wore standard fatigues, albeit with special insignia). More mundane Nazis may belong to the **Wehrmacht**, which was comprised of the **Heer** (Army), **Luftwaffe** (Air Force) and **Kriegsmarine** (Navy), where they are less likely to be members of the Nazi party at all and more likely to be conscripts.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

If Nazis are out hunting for La Résistance or Jews, you might encounter **The Gestapo**, the German Secret Police, though they tend to be less of a threat than their rivals in the SS (though they're usually no less horrible as people). Last but not least are members of the German spy service, the **Abwehr**, who are the most likely to secretly be working with the Allies. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the Abwehr, loathed the Nazis and put much of the Abwehr's energy into feeding them false information, smuggling Jews out from under their noses, and unsuccessfully trying to kill Adolf Hitler. He was part of the July 20th Plot, and was shot for his role in it.

On occasion, you might get to see actual infamous Nazis rather than fictional characters who are based on them (or at least share traits with them). They, too, will frequently be played in specific ways. One can generally expect Heinrich Himmler to be creepily detached, really into the occult, and frequently possessed of a cowardly streak. Reinhard Heydrich will be stony, intimidating and utterly ruthless, carrying out the most heinous of atrocities with the same demeanor he uses when deciding what to have for lunch. Hermann Goering will frequently be a flamboyant, decadent pig of a man, though some portrayals can make him surprisingly charming. Josef Goebbels will tend to be a man possessed of an inferiority complex and desperate to stay in Hitler's good graces. Rudolf Hess will typically be a weirdo and a bit of a Butt-Monkey. And so on.

Then there are neo-Nazis. Generally today they tend to be somewhat stereotypical and lower-class skinhead punks, covered with tattoos and listening to rage rock, with no real agenda besides anger and violence, and generally representing a particularly nasty strain of disaffected youth, often led on by calculating hatemongers with more cynical motives. These are common in cop shows, and are given a particularly chilling representation in the film _American History X_. Other films, like _The 51st State_, portray them as asinine thugs, dumber than a box of rocks. It's also important to note that not _all_ skinheads are Neo-Nazis, and making such an association around a traditional or anti-racist skin tends to invite a reaction. Other skinheads tend to be strongly _anti-Nazi_, even far left. The skinhead movement originated as a style of dress and haircut common among working class men: workboots, jeans, and no hair because you work with machinery. The neo-Nazi movement appropriated those fashions in the same way that the Nazi party appropriated socialist language, symbols, and colors before the war.

On the other hand, during the earlier days of the Cold War, spy shows, such as _Mission: Impossible_ or _The Man from U.N.C.L.E._, occasionally had their protagonists take a break from battling the commies in order to put a stop to someone's attempt to establish "The Fourth Reich". These Nazi wannabes would invariably be vaguely Germanic, paranoid, arrogant, obsessed with "discipline," and usually very morally rigid (such as announcing that in the New Order, women would be limited to making babies, their "proper function"). In short, such characters were little more than broadly drawn cartoons, although they _do_ have some factual basis (e.g. Nazi commando Otto Skorzeny's post-War activities). Given that the entertainment industry is predominantly Jewish, and World War II was still a recent memory for most people, it's not surprising that any Nazi character would be denied even the tiniest human characteristic. Another with some (increasingly small) currency today is the fugitive Nazi war criminal, who may well be hiding out in Latin Land (especially Argentina, it seems) or even the continental United States. Perhaps he's working as a dentist...

The sheer use of them as antagonists practically makes them an arguable standout example of The Usual Adversaries, and perhaps the ultimate form of Villain by Default. The extreme case of this is Gratuitous Nazis, where villainous Nazis appear in a geographical area or time period where they would not be expected to, with little justification. Nazis are also one of the most well-known examples of Politically Incorrect Villains. If people from the Nazi period are cast as protagonists instead, see Nazi Protagonist. These may or may not be Villain Protagonists as well.

    Stock Phrases and Slurs 

## Stock German phrases and words usually associated with Nazis:

-   Achtung — "attention!" If it's a fighter pilot movie, a common variation is "Achtung! Spitfire!"
-   Führer — "leader/guide". In today's German this word on its own is often avoided in its meaning of "leader", as it has become associated so much with Hitler; the words "Anführer" ("leader") or "Leiter", being not connotated that way, are used instead. In its other meaning of "guide" and in compound words (_e.g._ Führerschein = driver's license), "Führer" still is commonly used.
-   Hände hoch! — "Hands up!"
-   Halt! — "Hold it!/Stop there!" which may be followed by
-   Ausweis! — "ID"
-   Jawohl! — "Yes, sir/ma'am!" Technically it actually just means _emphatic_ yes (_YES!_) without the attached "sir" or "ma'am", but translations often include the honorific due to the way the word is used. "Jawohl, mein Führer!" is enough of a Stock Phrase to deserve a specific mention.
-   Scheiße! — Shit!
-   Schweinhund!— Literally "Pig-Dog", used as an insult, as in "Du Amerikaner schweinhunds!"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Kommandant — A commander, regardless of rank.
-   Raus! — "Out!" Often used in the context of the Holocaust.
-   Schnell! — "Quick/Quickly!" General-purpose exclamation by anyone giving orders.
-   Papiere, bitte! — "Papers, please", usually expressed in a _very_ commanding tone.
-   Was ist los? — "What's going on?" (or "What's wrong?") Usually uttered by a clueless Nazi trooper about to be killed by members of the resistance or in an ambush.
-   Los! Los! — when German soldiers urge their prisoners to hurry.
    -   Alternately, a single "Los!" by a sub captain meant "Launch!" (the torpedoes)
-   Alarm! — "Alarm!" ("We're under attack!", from Italian "all'arme", meaning "To the weapon"/"to arms"; on U-boats, this is the order to start a crash dive).
-   Amerikaner! or Engländer! — "Americans!" or "Englishmen!" Usually followed by the German soldier who yelled the warning getting shot by said Americans or Englishmen.
-   Verdammt! — "Damn!" though the literal is damned. Can also be Verdammter if it preceeds things like Amerikaner. "Verdammter Amerikaner!" (Damn American!)
-   Nicht schießen! — "Don't shoot!" (Not to be confused with Nicht scheißen! - "Don't shit!")
-   Sieg Heil! — "Hail victory!" (Always accompanied by a Nazi salute.)
-   Mein Gott in Himmel! — "My God in Heaven!" Expression of shock/surprise/disbelief, often when encountering Allied commandos. "Mein Gott!" "Gott in Himmel!" "Gott!" and "Himmel!" are also common.
    -   Ironically, the grammatically correct form "Gott _im_ Himmel" is never heard outside Germany.
-   Zu Befehl! — "On (your) command", expressing obedience. Usually followed by a clack of heels struck together.
-   Ach du Lieber! — "Oh dear!" Same usage as above. Yes, in direct translation, meaning, usage and force of utterance, the expression "Ach du Lieber" is pretty much identical to the English "Oh dear". <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Ach, der Teufel! — "Oh, the Devil!" General curse. Suitable response to anything from Allied attack to overdue library books. "Ach" and "der" are optional.
-   Donner und Blitzen! — "Thunder and lightning!" Angry curse or general expression of anger, more common with those who have underlings to rant at. Not to be confused with the reindeer of the same name that pull Santa's sleigh around.
-   Donnerwetter! — "Thunderstorm!" (lit: thunder-weather) Expression of surprise and/or awe and/or frustration and/or anger according to tone.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Schweigen Sie! — "Be quiet!"
    -   Maul halten! (lit. "shut your \*animalistic\* gob!"), Halts Maul! (ditto) _or_ Schnauze! ("Snout!") — the less formal, less nice versions of the above.
-   Verstanden! — "Understood!" or "Roger!" Used to acknowledge an order.
-   Sani! — "Medic!" or "Get a medic!" Short for Sanitäter.

Luckily for English audiences, a lot of the more functional parts of speech are extremely similar-sounding in English and German, so the lines are often blurred between Poirot Speak and Just a Stupid Accent. Along with the list above, you can include "ja", "nein", "mein(e)" (my), "ein(e)" (one/a), "wo/was" (where/what), "das", "ist", "gut", and many others. Das ist gut, ja?

## Stock slurs:

-   Schwein! — Almost-English stock insult, essentially saying Swine. Note: In contemporary German this is about as (in-)offensive as calling someone a "scoundrel".
-   Schweinhund — translated "pig dog". Might also be a compliment for especially resilient people. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Arschloch! — Asshole!
-   Dummkopf! — Blockhead
-   Scheisskopf! — Shit-head!
-   Ami — American. Somewhat neutral shortcut for "US American". Used in World War Two by German military, especially Army, to refer to U.S. military personnel and assets
-   Tommy — Brit/Englishman. Also "Tommyboy".
-   Franzmann — Frenchman.
-   Itaka — Italian. It has to be noted that fascist Italy was an ally of Nazi Germany; "Itaka" is short for "Italienischer Kamerad" or Italian comrade. Its true meaning became obscure over time and it was degraded to a slur for Italians. Also "Makaronis" (heard in _Das Boot_, among others), short for "Makaronifresser". "fressen" literally means "to eat" but is reserved for referring to animals or people eating excessively, or for use as insult.
-   Polacke — Pole. Later adopted by English-speakers under the anglicized "Polack".
-   Iwan (or "Der Iwan!")(pronounced "Ivan") — Soviet

Any low-ranking Nazi Mook will have a limited vocabulary, consisting solely of these phrases uttered in rapid succession, also called "voice achtung". In real life, the Wehrmacht did not print phrase books to its troops, essentially because most Germans already know a little English and French, and on the Eastern Front, the only words a German soldier needed to know was "Ruki Vverkh!" ("hands up!") and "Mleko, Kurki, Yaiki" (Milk, Chicken, Eggs) — for extorting said produce from the locals.

Despite their name, Grammar Nazis don't usually count (with the odd exception...). And of course, comparing someone unfairly to Nazis invokes Godwin's Law.

See also The Klan, another group of people infamous for their racism, as well as The Upper Crass and Evil Colonialist, for the similar types of villains with similar mentality. When they are ridiculed or Played for Laughs, you have Adolf Hitlarious. When they are Nazi-esque organisations but not Nazis themselves, you have A Nazi by Any Other Name. When the Nazis merge with Communist belief, you have Commie Nazis.

In post-WWII works, the Neo-Nazis will also overlap with Evil Reactionary trope due to their old traditionalist beliefs.

## Examples:

    Anime and Manga 

-   Brockenman and Brocken Jr. from _Kinnikuman_. Brockenman could actually _breathe poison gas_, as it happens. Notable in that Brocken Jr. is a HEROIC Nazi.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   The Red Ribbon Army from _Dragon Ball_ is essentially a Nazi variant and clear in most of their designs and ideas. From using U-boats, tanks, castle fortresses and even twisted science experiments. General Blue is an allison to Rudolf Hess as a homosexual obsessed with cleanliness also having the blonde hair blue eyes of the ideal Master Race which Akira Toriyama rightly mocked the hell out of.
    -   In _Dragon Ball Z_, Dr Gero of the RRA has German designs and has a dream of creating a new perfect race of cyborgs.
    -   _Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn_ has the General who looks just like Adolf Hitler, leading tanks to destroy a city, only to be stopped by Goten and Trunks.
    -   Also worth noting is that many of the vehicles and even a few robots from before and after the Red Ribbon Army's introduction had a very distinctive WWII appearance about them that evoked this Trope, including several one-offs from title page artwork.
-   Count Brocken from _Mazinger Z_ was a Nazi ex-officer was considered particularly blood-thirsty by his comrades. The uniforms of his troops -called the Iron Cross- remind of Nazi soldiers, too.
-   _Hellsing_: Millennium has more or less any possible (as well as impossible) Nazi variant with, for example, the Junior Warrant Officer Schrödinger, a Schrödinger's Cat-Boy wearing a Hitler Jugend uniform. Lieutenant Rip van Winkle _almost_ counts as one of the various potentially gay Nazi archetypes, except for the fact that Rip is a sharpshooter and who dresses in very masculine clothing. She also fits in with the cultured Nazi archetype due to her love for classical German opera. And then there's Dok...
    -   And the Millennium vampire SS officers dressed in the infamous black Schutzstaffel and the zombie soldiers. Really Millennium is designed to be as evil as possible to balance out the already menacing protagonist Alucard, in lesser of two of evils kind of way.
-   _Kurogane Pukapuka Tai_ gives us Captain Nina Stoltebeker, who plays into the 'kinky gay fetishist' type (lesbian with a _body odour fetish_) and 'Schindler' type (shelters a Jewish crewmember at the expense of a perfect personnel-loss record).
-   The neo-Nazis from _Black Lagoon_
    -   They get the uptight, fanatical portrayal of them, as does the SS Officer in the flashback. The U-Boat crew, however, are a bit more amiable, but not quite hitting any of the more positive portrayals listed above. The captain even tells the SS guy that, considering how he, his peers and his Führer seem, it might be better that the Nazis lose the war.
    -   The Neo-Nazis are also portrayed as comically inept and fanatical. Their hamminess doesn't help. The _real_ Neo-Nazi, the man who funded the operation, is a Retired Monster who still very much holds on to his Nazi ideals, but is polite enough to have a conversation with a black man before calling him degenerate.
    -   The U-Boat crew were more "loyal to a country that just happened to be Nazi Germany" than Nazis themselves. The Captain even stated that if their U-Boat sinking meant that his children would never have to see a Swastika again he would be glad to make that sacrifice.
-   _One Piece_
    -   The Impel Down staff are painfully clear Nazi inspired, and along with the hellish themes of Impel Down it makes for one of the most threatening places in the One Piece world, they even have their insignia which they wear on armbands like the swastika. However is worth saying that despite their appearance, inspiration and clear motif, most of them aren't bad guys.
    -   The former Warden Magellan is decked in a black SS Schutzstaffel officer uniform complete with armband and is winged and demonic in appearance (if he wasn't evil looking enough), Hannaybal adopts this look when he becomes chief warden in Magellan's place. Domino is also in uniform but as per female character quota is designed sexually. Former chief of staff Shrilew loves his Nazi outfit so much he never dress differently, even when defects from Impel Down to join Black Beard. But, like stated above, neither Magellan nor Hannyabal are bad guys and actually have a very deep sense of justice and responsibility with the regular people who trust Impel Down to keep the worst criminals locked for them to live in peace. Shrilew is a whole different story though.
    -   Oda wasn't done with Nazi themes as The Germa 66 and Vinsmoke family are references too. Not only having German designs right down to Reichsadler (imperial eagle) and threatening insgina, the Germa composed of a male-only Clone Army who are considered disposable Human Shield\-stormtroopers to the ruling family.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ (a Japanese comic about anthropomorphic countries set primarily in WWII)
    -   Germany is apparently quite into bondage, a Drill Sergeant Nasty, _and_ a tight-ass bureaucrat, though a constructive one. Canonically a Straight Gay Nazi as of the Buon San Valentino arc. Should be noted that overall, he's a nice guy. There may also be a hint of My Country, Right or Wrong too as he often complains his Boss is insane.
    -   Prussia also receives this treatment in Fanon, being Germany's more villainous big brother. When he does, he typically gets a less cultured portrayal than Germany himself, and tends to be drawn as too eager to spill blood or too eager to help his little bro. Often he's both.
-   _The Legend of Koizumi_ has Nazis as the main villains. It turns out they all survived, including Hitler, Mengele, and _Wagner_. They live on their moon base, travel to Earth in classic UFOs, and have a giant cannon capable of launching meteor-bullets that hit with the force of a nuclear weapon. Earth's only hope? Beat them in a mahjong tournament.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency_ has the German army that are initially shown to be stereotypical evil, but turns out to be able to develop into the hero's side because they are up against the same super vampire-like enemies. Also, the Nazis have cyborg technology. It doesn't hurt that Rudolf von Stroheim is an amazing Large Ham, who even made it into _Eyes of Heaven_ as a playable character (though with the Nazi references toned down).
-   The organization from _Monster_ fall into this pretty well, of the "Fourth Reich" variety.
-   _Lupin III: Part II_ had "To Be or Nazi Be", an entire episode dedicated to locating Hitler's lost treasure, which naturally played into this trope.
    -   A Neo Nazi group led by Herr Mafrodite are the villains in the 1995 special, _Lupin III: The Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure_.
    -   Among the many Lupin imitators in Green vs. Red, the genuinely villainous one is a Neo-Nazi in an assault chopper. Seriously.

    Comic Books 

-   The Nazis facing the Rifle Brigade in _Adventures in the Rifle Brigade_, featuring such luminaries as the eerie, skeletal Gestapo captain Venkschaft, busty grudge-bearing dominatrix Gerta Gasch, and the famous ladykillers and war heroes Otto and Ernst Flaschmann.
-   _The Desert Peach_ features Erwin "The Desert Fox" Rommel's (ficticious) younger, flamingly gay brother, in command of a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits unit of the Afrika Corps. The comic has an interesting subversion: the only honest-to-God Nazi party member in the unit is the Jewish Corporal Udo Schmidt.
-   The British war comics, such as _Commando_, were pretty much built on this trope. It got better in later years, mostly as a result of changing attitudes to war in general; one issue of Commando in the 90's even focused on a soldier realising the horrors he was having to perpetrate.
-   Neo-Nazi skinheads appear several times in German comic _Rudi_. Sometimes just for a gag, but in one of the first stories they beat up the protagonists.
-   Almost any Frank Miller comic — _Sin City_, _Batman: The Dark Knight Returns_, _Ronin (1983)_, etc. — will feature at least one Nazi henchman or gang member who gets killed off in a violent and/or hilarious way.
-   _Give Me Liberty_ has the Aryan Thrust, a group of gay white supremacists.
-   A staple of _Captain America_'s Rogues Gallery. On the other hand, the Red Skull is a Nazi, but not very wacky.
-   A less common but still present staple of _Justice Society of America_, owing to its World War II origins but carrying to the present day blending with Stupid Jetpack Hitler and Disco Dan.
-   In _American Flagg!_, we have the Gotterdammercrats, Illinois Nazis who most people seem to treat as tame and mostly harmless, but then ally with the also fascist, but violent and genuinely revolutionary, American Survivalist Labor Committee (A.S.L.C.) to take over Chicago.
-   Hammer in _Danger Girl_ (and inevitably the video game) is a group of neo-Nazis founded by a now-ancient former member of Hitler's personal guard. They've got every Nazi stereotype in the book among their ranks, including a sadistic mad scientist, a hulking strongman clad head-to-toe in black leather, a pair of creepy aristocrat twins, and _two_ "Baroness"-type sexpots.
-   One story in _Dracula Lives!_ set in the second World War has a bunch of Nazis stationed in Castle Dracula, and finding it to be not as safe as they thought.
-   In _Athena Voltaire_, the Nazis are prominent antagonists in half the stories. The stories are set a little before the start of the war proper, so Athena's conflict with them isn't specifically on behalf of her country — it's just that she keeps running into them when their interest in the occult needs to be thwarted.
-   _Age of the Wolf_: The second major enemy that Rowan faces in post-werewolf apocalypse Britain is a Neo-Nazi gang of slavers, led by a wheelchair-bound granny and her two grandchildren.
-   Blackstarr from _Supergirl (1982)_ is leader of a Neo-Nazi gang which looked to spread all over Chicago.
-   Most of the _Ultimate Marvel_ comics are set in the present day, but the conflict against Nazis (and their alien allies, the Chitauri) kickstarted the events of _The Ultimates (2002)_. Loki, half-brother of Thor, also infiltrated the Nazis and got some of their military forces to join the war against Asgard.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Subverted with Diana's most notable Pre-Crisis Nazi opponent who at first seemed to play it straight. The Nazis forced Paula von Gunther to become a spy and saboteur against the United States by using her daughter as hostage after killing her husband right in front of her without hesitation for her attempt to refuse. Though hating her new role, Paula could not bear to endanger Gerta, and thus drove herself to become a cold, cruel schemer. Once Gerta was rescued, Paula spent the rest of her life making up for what she had done under duress and was Diana's loyal support and friend through the Golden, Silver and Bronze ages of comics.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: Paula's Post-Crisis version played it straight, as she was a ruthless wildly eager Nazi occultist and a personal assistant to Adolf Hitler during World War II.
-   Captain Nazi of _Shazam!_ is a minor villain of the World's Mightiest Mortal who has similar Flying Brick powers that come from a Super Serum. He was originally an enemy of the Big Red Cheese during the Golden Age Of Comic Books, but was brought to the Modern Age after Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett heroes were incorporated into the main DC Universe following the events of _Crisis on Infinite Earths_.

    Fan Works 

-   The fanfic writer E350 is fond of using Nazis as the villains in many of his stories, to the point that an entry in _Halloween Unspectacular 7_ takes the time to list all his examples. He notes that for him, they tend to fall into three types: A (the breathtakingly incompetent ones), B (the moustache-twirlingly evil ones), and/or C (the gratuitous back-story ones).

    Film — Live-Action 

-   In _31_, Sick-Head is a Nazi clown with a swastika painted over his chest. His room has "Arbeit macht frei" written above the door and is filled with all sorts of Hitler and Nazi memorabilia.
-   A part of the Swedish comedy film _The Adventures of Picasso_ takes place in France during World War II. Picasso hides a handful of (presumably Jewish) refugees in his apartment, with the Nazis (led by Picasso's father) coming regularly for perquisition. Hilarity Ensues. In another scene, Adolf Hitler himself appears in a rather hilarious painting duel against Winston Churchill.
-   _The Believer_: The Neo-Nazis are divided between thuggish, violent skinheads vs. clean cut normal-looking people who oppose violence on pragmatic grounds.
-   Max in _Bent_ is taken into a concentration camp by the Nazis, and mistakenly thought pretending to be Jewish would make him be treated better.
-   _The Blues Brothers_: The Illinois Nazis. All of them get to be the Butt-Monkey.
-   _The Boys from Brazil_: One younger neo-Nazi strangles an elderly English target of Peck's "Mengele"'s character's assassinations of 65 year old civil servant fathers of adopted 14 year old boys and make the man's

death look like some sort of kinky sex suicide pact after knifing the young woman tenant of the Englishman's apartment building that he (the younger neo-Nazi) was having sex with. This younger neo-Nazi was part of an organization that attempted a "Fourth Reich" cloning attempt to bring back Adolf Hitler to modern times.

-   Following comic book history, _Captain America: The First Avenger_ has a couple of Wacky Nazis. Schmidt/the Red Skull is the cultured type, down to listening to Wagner on his phonograph (while having his portrait painted, no less); Zola's the icky doctor. Hydra in general is kind of an exaggeration of the SS. In _Avengers: Infinity War_, Red Skull has been banished by the tesseract to the planet with the soul stone because someone as evil as him will never be able to obtain it. In order to get the soul stone, one must sacrifice someone they love to get it. It's implying that he is eviler than Thanos because at least Thanos proves by sacrificing Gamora that he's capable of love.
-   The 1943 movie of _The Desert Song_ has Nazis building a railroad in Morocco with slave labour.
-   _Downfall_, a German film showing the final days in Hitler's life, deconstructs this trope, as the Nazis are portrayed as real humans, having both bad and good qualities, without glorifying their deeds. This was in fact the intention of the director, as he wanted to show the audience the Nazis were humans, instead of the one-dimensional inherently evil monsters most media make them out to be.
-   The title character of _Dr. Strangelove_, black gloves, shrill laugh and all. He's a sinister secret project leader, and changed his original German name after he was made a U.S. citizen.
-   Major Koenig in _Enemy at the Gates_, who seems like he's skirting the borders of sympathy until he pretty much catapults over the Moral Event Horizon.
-   _Escape from L.A._ When Snake is looking for the original soldier sent into Los Angeles to retrieve the Sword of Damocles, he runs into a bunch of Neo-Nazis using the guy's corpse for target practice. When they try to kill Snake over an insult he shoots one of them with his machine gun, looking nearly bored.
-   The villains in _Evil Easter 3 The Final Easter_ embodies multiple stereotypes of Nazis:
    -   The main villain Heinrich is the Wicked Cultured one and both a Mad Scientist and Nazi Nobleman.
    -   The Dragon Conrad von Starker is the Sociopathic Soldier who is in it For the Evulz.
    -   Godellieve claims she is Just Following Orders.
        -   For bonus points, the villains can't stop to says things like "Halt", "fürer", "raus", "sieg heil" and their cartoonishly extreme antisemitism.
-   In _Falling Down_, the first person Villain Protagonist Bill actually kills during his Going Postal rampage is a Neo-Nazi Gun Nut who picks a fight with him when he rejects his "Not So Different" Remark. Despite the man's Establishing Character Moment being terrorizing a gay couple, he's implied to be a case of Armored Closet Gay himself.
-   The main villains of _Fire with Fire_ are a neo-Nazi gang harassing a witness to a double-murder of theirs.
-   _Frieda_: As Robert and Frieda are attempting to adjust after learning the truth about Bergen-Belsen, an ex-German soldier appears—Frieda's brother Richard. Thinking he had been killed, Frieda is initially overjoyed. He had been captured and allowed to volunteer for the Polish Army. However, she soon realises that he has remained a Nazi at heart, his wedding present to Frieda being a swastika on a chain.
-   The horror film _Frontier(s)_ features a group of French students escaping a future Paris where the Neo-Nazi Party has taken power. They stumble across an abandoned inn and stay the night, where the patriarch of the family that owns it wears an SS uniform. He tries to get the men to have sex with his daughters to propagate the Pure Race, but upon discovering that one is Muslim and one is already in love, orders his family to kill them all. They are also cannibalistic.
-   _Goldfinger_. While Goldfinger's German accent and reaction to Nazi gold lead many fans to assume Nazi roots, the character is specifically described as a Soviet agent in the book. Ironically, the actor Gert Fröbe was a member of the Nazi party (not for long though), causing the film to be banned in Israel until it was discovered that he used his position to save a family of Jews, very much like a mini-Schindler. The German accent is an illusion. Fröbe didn't speak a word of English and had to be dubbed by English actor Michael Collins (Not to be confused with the Apollo astronaut Michael Collins, or the Irish patriot Michael Collins who was played by Liam Neeson...who played Oskar Schindler). Fröbe was such a good actor that the dub is completely unnoticeable.
-   _Grindhouse_ features the Rob Zombie\- directed mock trailer for _Werewolf Women of the SS_ with Udo Kier as a secret project leader creating... oh well, we don't want to spoil it for you.
-   Although Fritz Lang's _Hangmen Also Die!_ from 1943 never downplays the Nazis' ruthlessness, its portrayals of especially Reinhard Heydrich and Gestapo Inspector Ritter rely heavily on Camp Gay stereotypes.
-   Two-thirds of the bad guys from _Hellboy_ (the last third was Rasputin): Ninja Scientist Steampunk Cyborg Karl Kroenen and The Baroness Ilsa Hauptmann.
-   _Indiana Jones_:
    -   Toht in _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ is the torture master. His name is probably a play on the German words "Tod" (death) or "tot" (dead).
    -   Dr Elsa Schneider in _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ fills some part of the Noble Scientist role but more likely — she is The Baroness.
-   _Inglourious Basterds_ is basically a deconstructor fleet of this entire article. Most of the archetypes are there.
    -   SS Colonel Hans Landa is a primary example mixture of several of the above types - cultured, multilingual, sadistic, silly and prone to making ze important phone call vich vill change zee war. Gestapo Major Dieter Hellstrom being also the bossy cultured one - he even listens to classical music on a scratchy gramophone. Both constitute Wicked Cultured with ze kinky Cherman accents und leather trenchcoats.
    -   Fredrick Zoller is the "I'm Just Doing My Job" Nazi - even though that involves killing Allied soldiers from a clock tower in Monte Casino.
    -   Several mook cannon fodder types appear - some with Swastikas carved on their forehead.
    -   Celebrity Pantomine versions of Hitler, Goebbels and Goering amongst others.
-   Several Greek films set during WWII present Nazis that fall under this trope. In most cases the German officers are presented as a combination of the "cultured" one with the Obstructive Bureaucrat that yells "Heil Hitler" every chance he gets, even when drinking a glass of water. Examples similar to the "look how evil I am" SS-Standartenführer seen in _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ and Hans Muller (played by Klaus Kinski) in Five For Hell (1969) are not rare either. A notable example is the film _Ipolochagos Natassa_ (_Lieutenant Natassa_, a.k.a. _Battlefield Constantinople_), where SS Captain Max (played by Kostas Karras) is introduced not only as the "cultured" one and Obstructive Bureaucrat, but one that has personal story with the heroine before the war. Naturally, the most evil ones wear the black Allgemeine-SS uniform.
-   In the 2012 film _Iron Sky_, the Nazis who escaped Germany after World War II ended up heading to _the moon_ and establishing a base there to prepare for an earth invasion. For bonus points, their mothership is named the _Götterdämmerung_.
-   _Jackboots on Whitehall_ has this scaled down to 1/6 size.
-   _Jojo Rabbit_ essentially depicts Hitler and the Nazis as Laughably Evil as possible. At least in the beginning of the film.
-   Dr. Christian Szell from _Marathon Man_ is a perfect example of the torture master and the sadist. He is upset that thus far he has only been referred to cryptically and in passing. He wants to ask you a question. "Is it safe?"
-   The farmer from _New Kids: Turbo_ who ends up giving them weapons before accidentally getting shot by one of the New Kids.
-   The plot of _The Producers_ revolves around the made-up play "Springtime For Hitler", a musical romp into the lighter side of the Third Reich. Noted by Mel Brooks as the most tasteless topic for a musical he could think of. Influenced by Lenny Bruce's 'How Hitler Got Started'/'Hitler and the MCA' bit. Not to mention the author of the play who, when confronted said "Who are you? What do you want? My papers are in order. I was only following orders. I love my adopted country!"
-   The German film _Rosen für den Staatsanwalt (Roses For The Prosecutor)_, in which a pedlar from post-war Germany attempts to blackmail the local prosecutor, a rabid ex-Nazi officer who had unsuccessfully sentenced him to death during the war for acquiring two boxes of military-issued chocolate.
-   The villains in _Run for the Sun_ are a trio of Nazis hiding out in central America. Browne is an Englishman who broadcast propaganda for the Nazis; Von Andre is an army colonel wanted for ordering the massacre of an entire town; and Jan is a Luftwaffe pilot.
-   In _Stiletto_, several of Raina's targets are members of a Neo-Nazi biker gang called Nazis for Jesus.
-   In _The Sum of All Fears,_ an atomic bomb is smuggled into the U.S. by a group of German neo-Nazis, who expect the Americans to blame the destruction of Baltimore on Russia, leading to a war that would destroy or cripple both nations, leaving a power vacuum in which a new Reich can arise. (In Tom Clancy's novel, the villains were not Nazis but Palestinian extremists.)
-   In the future of _Surf Nazis Must Die_, various criminal gangs rule the beaches of California and the strongest one is, well, Surf Nazis.
-   In _Tarzan Triumphs_ (1943), after Tarzan has defeated a Nazi invasion of Africa, Cheetah stumbles upon the German radio, and begins gibbering into the microphone. In Berlin, the radio operator believes he is finally receiving a message from the mission commander and summons the general. The general listens to Cheetah for a few seconds, then chews out the operator. "This isn't Colonel Von Reichart! IT IS THE FUEHRER!" All present snap to attention and give the Nazi salute.
-   Colonel Erhardt in _To Be or Not to Be_ is a ridiculous buffoon, but is also extremely dangerous.
-   Mel Brooks' humorous remake of _To Be Or Not To Be_ features a lot of humor at the expense of the fumbling, bumbling Nazis, including a stage skit cut short entitled _Naughty Nazis_ wherein Brooks himself makes fun of Hitler: "Heil Myself!"
-   Not surprisingly, any Norwegian war movie made between 1945 and 1960 played it straight. In later movies, the trope is more subverted. The 1946 movie _We Leave for England_ tops the score with the most evil Nazis in any Norwegian movie before _Max Manus_ went back to play it straight.
-   "Klaus Schmidt" from _X-Men: First Class_ is a mixture of cultured and mad doctor; he tells young Erik that he is not like the Nazis, and mocks their obsession with genetics—or at least, blue eyes and blonde hair. Bring _mutants_ into the equation it's a whole different ball game.
-   The Three Stooges short _You Nazty Spy!_ is the Ur-Example, though Charlie Chaplin's _The Great Dictator_ is quite possibly the Trope Maker.
-   Subverted in _The Wall_. The neo-Nazi skinheads look like they’re just silly facists... until they go into the streets at night and start destroying everything, and beating people they don’t like, including an interracial couple. A number of the extras in the "Nazi hallucination" sequence were played by _actual_ skinheads (you can see several doing the Nazi salute during "In the Flesh" - that was _not_ in the script); subsequently, American white supremacists were inspired by the film to found a new movement, the Hammerskin Nation, using the crossed-hammers symbol of the Nazis in the movie.

    Literature 

-   George MacDonald Fraser occasionally mentions German ex-prisoners of war in his _McAuslan_ stories set in post-war North Africa. For a while, his batman - soldier/servant - was a German POW trusted to do this work for British officers. He is described as a huge shaven headed Prussian, a man who kept his officer's uniform impeccably tidy, who the narrator found one day looking thoughtfully at his Scottish highland dress uniform, with an expression on his face that clearly said "Next time, Scotsman."
-   The _Doctor Who_ novel _Just War_ features a "cultured" Nazi who's quick to say he _loathes_ Wagner.

-   The _Choose Your Own Adventure_ book _Shadow of the Swastika_ cast the player character as a Jewish teenager in wartime Vienna trying to survive the Holocaust. This concept had the potential to go very wrong indeed, but the goons who rediscovered the book were pleasantly surprised to find a mature, sensitive and well-researched handling of the subject material.
-   In Andrew Vachss' _Burke_ books, neo-Nazis are recurring antagonists and occasional partners in an Enemy Mine situation, although how important they are runs the gamut.
-   In _Gentlehands_ by M. E. Kerr, Grandpa Trenker is the "cultured" one who tortured Italian Jews by playing opera to make them homesick.
-   Robert Ludlum's _The Apocalypse Watch_ has this planned as a takeover of both Europe and the United States.
-   Douglas Muir's _American Reich_ has this as a future post-Reagan presidency takeover of America.
-   In Herman Wouk's _The Winds of War_ and _War and Remembrance_ the hero, as an assignment for the US navy translates the writings of one "von Roon", a German staff officer. Quotes are put in between chapters. This helps the reader agree how much he really dislikes Nazis. Von Roon is an arrogant, pigheaded, jerk, with more then a touch of Insufferable Genius in him. He constantly plays down his own side's evil deeds while heaping scorn and vilification on his enemies. Wouk's Nazis are _very_ well done and believable. In a series that contains war, and Holocaust scenes, they are the creepiest part.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   In Ian Fleming's _Moonraker_, Hugo Drax is the classic cold-war era fictional neo-Nazi. (The movie gives him an obsession with a race of perfect physical specimens, but eliminates all specific reference to Germany or the NSDAP).
    -   In _Icebreaker_, Bond is sent on a mission with three other agents from fellow secret services to deal with a Nazi terrorist organization called Nationalist Socialist Action Army, which is led by man who envisions himself to be the next Hitler.
    -   Max Tarn from _SeaFire_ is also a Hitler-wannabe, who seeks to invigorate the Nationalist Socialist Party in Germany.

_The Invisible Detective_: Dr. Bessemer, a Bavarian puppeteer from the first book, is a Nazi agent out to kill the Duke of York and replace him with a robot before the Duke of York becomes king once his brother, King Edward VIII, abdicates.

-   In "The Lacework Kid" by Damon Runyon, the Kid outwits a PoW camp commandant who is addicted to Gin Rummy, and the scheming of the commandant's disloyal subordinates leads to all the prisoners going free.
-   The short story "A Lovely Bunch of Coconuts" by Charles Birkin (involving Jewish prisoners being forced to participate in sadistic "games" in a concentration camp) is not remotely humorous, but does use several stereotypes from the list.
-   In _MARZENA_ Neo-Nazism is very popular in Russia of 2033, not to mention the people of the Transhuman Army who are sometimes referred to as Transhuman Nazis.
-   Post-apocalyptic military science fiction _Victoria_ features a neo-Nazi faction, the Landwehr, as one of its more dangerous villain groups. These Nazis are very influenced by (a particular reading of) Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, emphasizing heroism, struggle, and will, but they are also enthusiastic advocates of public order, advanced technology and impersonal modernistic efficiency; altogether, this makes them weird and even alien, but formidable adversaries, and the protagonists grudgingly come to respect the Landwehr officer they mainly tangle with as a Worthy Opponent.
-   _2666_: Averted, as the Germans are portrayed as normal people. The characters Hans Reiter _does_ meet are crazy in their own ways.
-   In _Eclipse Trilogy_ fascism makes a big comeback in Europe. In France, the son of Le Pen becomes president. They even plan a new Holocaust.
-   The main villain of _Encryption Staffe_’s World War II chapters was Historical Domain Character SS commander Walter Rauff.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The "Nazi Generals" sketch in _Alas Smith and Jones_ hilariously sends up many of the cliched character types:
    
    **Gruber:** I am General Gruber. As you can see, I am the Nazi general who is always being fitted for a new uniform. I enjoy the company of beautiful women while listening to classical music with my eyes shut. _\[he does so\]_  
    **Schtum:** I see.  
    **Gruber:** I am also the Nazi general who says "You see captain, we are not all barbarians."  
    **Schtum:** I am Schtum, ze Nazi general with a steely streak to my character. You vill find that I am always removing my gloves. _\[removes gloves\] So!_ I disapprove of ozzer generals being measured for new uniforms. _\[passively-aggressively turns off Gruber's gramophone\]_ And I am alvays ze one who is vinding up ze telephone _\[winds up telephone\]_ and saying "Get me ze Führer!"
    
-   In the comedy _'Allo 'Allo!_, there's a Nazi for every stereotype. Although the Kinky Sex Nazi, the Gay Nazi and the Gestapo members are three different people.
    -   Herr Flick appears quite kinky when he is alone with Helga (that will be the transvestite tendencies perhaps).
    -   Herr Von Smallhausen is somewhat bumbling as do the comedy Wehrmacht Colonels and other officers.
    -   Lt Gruber and his "little tank" being the Gay Nazi. Subverted at the end of the series run when he marries Helga, has six kids and hires his old boss as his chauffeur.
    -   General von Klinkerhofen is a Nazi Nobleman, but played relatively straight compared to his wackier subordinates.
-   On the Christmas Episode of _The Aquabats! Super Show!_, the band squares off against the Krampus, whose henchmen sport SS uniforms. The Krampus is even given a German accent! The character of the Silver Skull (not to be confused with Ashens' character) is also vaguely Nazi-esque in appearance.
-   Unsurprisingly since the show is set in the late 1940s, several of the villains of the backstory and series proper are Nazis in _Alta Mar._
-   The _Arrowverse_ massive crossover event _Crisis on Earth-X_ has Earth-1 being invaded by the people of Earth-X, the only parallel world, where the Nazis won World War II. The heroes have to deal with the Evil Counterparts, such as Dark Arrow (Oliver) and Overgirl (Kara). A later episode also has Siren-X (the Evil Counterpart to Laurel and, to an extent, Black Siren) show up to avenge the defeat of the Reich, following the loss of its Fuhrer and generals during the crossover.
-   In _Auction Kings_, Paul auctions a valuable Nazi ideology handbook. Bob buys it to donate to a museum.
-   _A Bit of Fry and Laurie_ classic Major Donaldson sketch plays upon many tropes - including the Gay Nazi and the "Ve are not animals" Nazi. Hugh Laurie, complete with sexy disfigurement eye-scar, does the best pretend Cherman accent.
-   In _The Boys (2019)_, the Super Serum Compound V was invented by Frederick Vought, a Nazi Evilutionary Biologist who perfected it using the inmates of Dachau as human test subjects. After turning his wife into a superhuman (with her taking the name Stormfront), the two defected to the Allies after losing faith in Hitler's ability to win the war and plotted to use V to elevate white people into a Master Race of literal supermen. After Frederick's death Stormfront continued to hold her Nazi ideals in the present day, with them mutating according to her time, resulting in her echoing alt-right talking points in the modern era. After Stormfront was unmasked & Driven to Suicide she became an Inspirational Martyr for American neo-Nazis, resulting in a group calling themselves the "Stormchasers" becoming shock troops for her boyfriend Homelander.
-   In _Breaking Bad_, Todd's uncle Jack runs a group of neo-nazis who are often used as very dangerous and effective hitmen.
-   An episode of _CSI: NY_ featured three flavors of Nazis - an original, a skinhead street punk, and a businessman who kept his affiliation secret. The original, even after sixty-odd years of living under an assumed name as a Jew, with an Orthodox Jewish son who he to all evidence genuinely loved, still had enough hate in his heart to come out with "We should have killed them all".
-   _Danger 5_ is set in an Alternate History WWII. The enemy is Stupid Jetpack Hitler commanding Nazis who are capable of cloning dinosaurs and using Japanese robots in their plans for world domination. It's as awesome as it sounds.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Daleks were actually modelled after the Nazis (although taking the policy to the logical extreme). Their creator, Terry Nation, was a World War II scholar. Michael Wisher once said that he had played Davros based on what he thought Hitler would have been like after a hundred years in power.
        -   The similarities between Nazis and Daleks are lampshaded in the novel _Timewyrm: Exodus_, which implies that the aliens who helped Hitler forge the Third Reich modelled it on the Dalek civilization.
        -   The Daleks are so obsessed with their proliferation of the Dalek Master Race that in "Victory of the Daleks", the old batch is positively _delighted_ at being destroyed at the hands of the newer, more "perfect" Daleks they had created.
        -   A meta comparison is invoked by the Sixth Doctor in the radio play _Jubilee_. On an alternate 20th Century Earth that barely survived a Dalek invasion at the turn of the century, the Daleks came to be portrayed in the popular culture as buffoonish, incompetent, ineffectual villains that were the go-to guilt-free enemy in any scenario. The Doctor complains about the human tendency to defang historical evils, resulting in ignorance of the larger applicable truths about them (like racism and cruelty), and directly compares how that Earth treats the Dalek to how the non-alternate Earth treats the Nazis. Incidentally, that alternate Earth is dominated by a inhumane, fascist British Empire wielding Dalek-derived tech. So they basically became the very thing they once fought against.
    -   The Cybermen also have certain Nazi parallels. "Silver Nemesis" has Neo-Nazis admiring and allying with the Cybermen (before inevitably being betrayed by them).
    -   "Spyfall": When the Doctor is briefly stranded in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943, the Master poses as a Nazi officer to track her down. The Doctor notes that this is low even for him. Just to make it ironic, as the Doctor points out, this incarnation of the Master looks Indian and thus has to use a Perception Filter in order to pass as "the Aryan ideal".
-   In the _Fringe_ episode "The Bishop Revival", the bad guy is a mad doctor who wants to purify the world with the help of a virus that detects special genetic characteristics.
-   Sue White "being a Nazi from a film" complete with leather gloves, sinister cigarette smoking and phone call to Berlin - in _Green Wing_.
-   _Highway to Heaven_ has them ("neos") in Season 2 episode _The Torch_.
-   _Hogan's Heroes_: The show averted All Germans Are Nazis, but most of the Nazi characters qualify for this trope. And then there are the fake Germans impersonated by Hogan's team...
-   _Horrible Histories_ tends towards this in the "Woeful Second World War" sketches.
-   The B plot in one episode of _The John Larroquette Show_ centred around John being forced to rent a bust to a group of neo-Nazis.
-   The pilot of _Justified_ introduces Boyd Crowder as the leader of a gang of neo-Nazi rednecks. Boyd blows up a black church and spouts white supremacy rhetoric but Raylan quickly figures out that Boyd is not a true believer. The black church was used to deal marijuana and Boyd was hired to blow it up by a rival drug dealer. Boyd's crew are mostly idiots who rob banks for him and the neo-Nazi shtick is intended to keep them loyal. In later episodes Boyd reforms somewhat and becomes ashamed of his actions during that time period. This brings him into conflict with Devil who is a true believer and does not take it well when he finds out that Boyd was only pretending.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   _Kamen Rider_ had _Shocker_, a Cobra-like Nebulous Evil Organisation with Nazi undertones and many legitimate Nazis among their ranks. The most prominent of these is Colonel Zol, who according to some sources served at Auschwitz and was quite proud of it.
    -   _Kamen Rider: Skyrider_ has Neo-Shocker executive General Monster, who was originally a protege of Zol's while they were still in the SS.
    -   _Kamen Rider X_ gives us the magnificence that is Hitode Hitler, meaning "starfish Hitler". The mooks accompanying him wear Nazi uniforms as well.
-   _MacGyver_: In "The Ten Percent Solution", a massive neo-Nazi movement within the American political system is uncovered by MacGyver after investigating the claims by a Holocaust survivor.

-   Multiple episodes of _Mission: Impossible_ put the team against neo-Nazis or former Nazis who are seeking to create a Fourth Reich.
-   A _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ sketch featured Mr. Hitler _(slap)_ I mean, Mr. Hilter (John Cleese), including his old friends Bimmler (Michael Palin) and Ron Vibbentrop (Graham Chapman), all having inexplicably survived the war and being entertained by a shrill enthusiastic landlady (Terry Jones) in a guest house in Minehead, England. Hilter runs for the office of Mayor of "Meinhead" on his National Bocialist ticket. However, very few people like his ideas.
    
    **Minehead Citizen:** I don't like the sound of these here boncentration bamps.
    
-   Wolfgang, a recurring Arte Johnson character on _Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In_. ("Verrrrrry interestink...but shtupid!")
-   On one episode of _Seinfeld_, George and Jerry pretend to be "O'Brien" and "Murphy" so that they can get a limo from the airport. On the way there, they pick up two fans of O'Brien, and find out that O'Brien is actually the Neo-Nazi leader of the Aryan Union, who believes that Jews are trying to take over the world using blacks to push drugs.
-   In _Made-for-TV Movie/Skokie_ has George Dzundza's leader of the National Socialist Party of America, "Frank Collin"

wanting to demonstrate with his unifomed stormtroopers through the titular mostly Jewish suburb of Chicago circa 1977 (many of whose residents are Holocaust survivors) in real life with Danny Kaye playing his opponent, a survivor of Hitler's camps himself whose mother died in one of those camps.

-   In _Not In This Town_ has a mother fighting against them in her Billings, MT. town.
-   In _Sons of Anarchy_ one of the many rival gangs of the Sons are the Neo-Nazis including the Nords and the League of American Nationalists.
-   Mark Ravenhead, a star news anchor for ATN in _Succession_, is revealed to have gotten married at Hitler's house, named his dog after Hitler's dog, and mentions having read Mein Kampf several times. Incidentally, he is something of a fictional stand-in for ex-Fox News poster boy Tucker Carlson, who frequently promoted the "great replacement" conspiracy theory.
-   _Taken_: In "Jacob and Jesse" and "High Hopes", Dr. Kreutz is an ex-Nazi scientist. As a physicist, he is more Werner von Braun than Josef Mengele, but he certainly doesn't have much problem with gruesome medical procedures.
-   The first episode of _That Mitchell and Webb Look_ is an unquestioning SS officer during the retreat from Russia being continually pestered by his friend, who has just noticed that their caps have _skull_ badges on them... and wondering if, perhaps, they might be the baddies.
    
    **Erich:** "I really can't think of anything worse, as a symbol, than a skull!"
    
    **Hans:** _\*thinking\*_ "A rat's... _anus?_"
    
    **Erich:** "Yeah. And if we were fighting an army marching under the banner of a rat's anus I'd probably be a lot less worried, Hans."
    
-   _Walker, Texas Ranger_: Season 6's "The Soul of Winter" has Walker dealing with a neo-Nazi group known as the Sons of the Reich. Its leader, Stan Gorman, used to be stationed at Ford Hood with the pastor of a church the former was terrorizing, and tried to kill his son, but ended up killing the wrong kid.
-   _White Rabbit Project_: The "Crazy WW2 Weapons" episode's first legend was regarding the British's plan to lace Hitler's food with estrogen. The episode then goes on to portray what the British think will happen should the plan be carried out, with Hitler hilariously getting more and more whimsical, culminating in the Führer growing _breasts_ and aping a scene from _The Sound of Music_. It's ultimately revealed that the British never tried it, and switches to show what modern science says will happen instead.

    Music 

-   Steely Dan's "Chain Lightning" is about two former Nazis returning to the site of Hitler's Nuremberg speech.
-   Many of GACKT's musical performances, including Requiem et Reminiscence, Ghost, and more.
-   Red Rider's song "Lunatic Fringe" is inspired by Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish businessman who rescued tens of thousands of Jews during World War 2. The song is basically about how the moral masses will identify and resist the "lunatic fringe" of Nazism and other extremist ideologies.
-   "Der Fuehrer's Face" by Spike Jones. As well as lyrics that mock Nazi ideology ("Ja, this Nutzi-land is good / Ve vould leave it if ve could!"), the song lampoons the Nazi anthem "Horst Wessel Song," featuring a "raspberry" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  making a rude noise after each "Heil."
-   "I Was Not A Nazi Polka" by the Chad Mitchell Trio takes a skeptical look at the moral aftermath in Germany "fünfzehn oder zwanzig Jahre" after the war. "Sure zer vas some Nazis, two or three at most!" John Denver's tenor is distinctive
-   Possibly an Ur-Example: In 1939, some Nazi leaders denounced the popular dance tune "The Lambeth Walk" as "Jewish mischief and animalistic hopping." So Charles Ridley of the British Ministry of Information took some footage of Nazi troops from _Triumph of the Will_ and remixed it to make it look like they were dancing to (you guessed it) the Lambeth Walk. It does indeed make them look pretty wacky. Comics historian Mark Evanier remarks, "It is said the film was shown for Joseph Goebbels and he exploded and ran screaming from the room in anger. If so, that alone was reason enough to make it." You can watch it on his blog here.
-   Richard Wagner's operas were favorites of several Nazi propagandists, who used it as (literal) Music to Invade Poland to. This has given his music Unfortunate Implications in some circles to this day, especially in Israel. Since the composer died long before the Nazis came to power, most music historians consider this a case of Hitler Ate Sugar. Wagner is regrettably on record with some nasty anti-semitic statements of his own, although he was also a pacifist.
-   Pro Vita from the Belgian band _Arbeid Adelt_ is all about laughing with the German Gestapo.
-   Slayer's "Angel of Death", "Behind the Crooked Cross", and "SS-3".

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Jack Adkisson and Walt Seiber made a name for themselves in the 1950s and '60s as Fritz and Waldo Von Erich, a pair of unrepentant Nazi heels.

    Radio 

-   Radio 7's _Play and Record_ has the Time Nazi - basically a parody of this trope and Per Degaton from _DCU_. He travels back in time to defeat his opponent, before they become a threat. Eventually he ends up fighting the past, present and future versions of himself
-   _Doctor Who_: Doctor (and later Colonel) Elizabeth Klein from the audios "Colditz", "A Thousand Tiny Wings", "Klein's Story", "Survival of the Fittest" and "Architects of History". She's from a parallel universe where because of something Ace did the Nazis won. She's not naive, she knows the Nazis have done terrible things, but she does believe in the "survival of the fittest" ideology of the Nazis. She is a medical doctor and as compassionate as the Doctor, but she's also cold-blooded enough to abandon the Doctor, steal the TARDIS and edit history to the point where the Nazis have a Moonbase and have beaten the Daleks (think about that for a second).
-   _The Adventures of Superman_: Superman and his co-workers fought more than a few of these during the war years.

    Theatre 

-   The villain of _Margin for Error_ is the Nazi German consul Karl Baumer. His underlings include the Nazi Nobleman Max von Alvenstor and the Bund leader and self-proclaimed "American Fuehrer" Otto Horst, who despite his fanatical devotion to Nazism was born in Milwaukee.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Pretty much every Nazi trope out there is played out in _Rocket Age_, possibly excluding Ghostapo. Though with psychic powers existing in Rocket Age there's no guarantee...

    Video Games 

-   _Freedom Force vs. The Third Reich_ involves the most gratuitous references to the most awesome of wartime comics. Including Nazi gorillas with machine guns.
-   _Pulp Adventures_ is a pulp-themed mod for _Freedom Force vs. The Third Reich_ and it includes a few missions involving fights against the same comedic Nazis that were in the original games (there's also a new unit with a jetpack). One of the features of the mod highlighted by the official description is "Nazi punching!"
-   The _Medal of Honor_ video games, although supposed to be serious WWII shooters, often are filled with prime examples. For instance, in _Allied Assault_, the Nazi guards on the submarine who salute every five seconds. It helps you were disguised as a high-ranking officer at the time.

-   _Putrefaction 2_ sees you entering a void leading to another dimension, and somehow encountering Nazi soldiers in it (complete with the Nazi Eagle flags!). It seems random at first, but then you found out the Nazi cult are from the 1940s, having escaped to another dimension and made a pact with evil forces to unleash a Zombie Apocalypse in the future. And then you fight Adolf Hitler, infused with demonic powers, as a boss.
-   Pretty much every Nazi from _Wolfenstein_.
    -   As befitting a first person shooter, most fall under the "hapless mook" category, but there are notable exceptions. General Wilhelm "Deathshead" Strasse ("Willy" to his good friend Herr Himmler) is a paragon of the "cadaverous and utterly evil Secret Project officer" and "Mad Doctor" types, while his crony Hans Grosse embodies the "kill-crazy muscle-bound grunt" traits.
    -   In _Return to Castle Wolfenstein_ there is also occult archeologist Professor Zempf, domineering Helga von Bulow and catsuit-clad voluptuous elite guards.
    -   And of course the literal Mecha-Hitler.
-   Doc Richtofen of the _Call of Duty: Zombies_ maps in _World at War_ (at least, the latter two) Is a Large Ham and loves killing his creations. (That is to say, zombies.)
-   _Laura Bow: The Dagger Of Amon Ra_ features tall, hot-tempered, sadistic martinet security guard Wolf Heimlich working at the Leyendecker Museum. Apart from being ridiculously strict and dressed in military uniform, he has a suspicious-looking goose step, his dialogue is interspersed with stock German phrases (often shouted/in capital letters), and the game frequently draws attention to the arsenal of weapons in his office. The game does take place in 1926 - three years after the infamous Beer Hall Putsch which put the Nazis on the map, but a considerable amount of time before Hitler's rapid rise to power.
-   _Dino D-Day_: The year is 1942. Adolf Hitler has succeeded in resurrecting dinosaurs. The reptilian horde has trampled Europe and the Mediterranean. Can nothing stop the Nazi’s dinosaur army?
-   Although Nazis don't actually _appear_ in _Tomb Raider_, the trope itself is in force: Lara discovers communications dating to World War II from scientists studying the island's unnatural weather patterns to determine whether they—or their source—could be harnessed for the war effort. The game doesn't explicitly identify them as Nazis, but the voice-over reading the communiques is done with a German accent, similar to the accents used for other documents to represent the language in which they are written.
-   _Escape from Hell (1990)_ includes Hitler and other Nazis plotting to overthrow Satan and take over Hell.
-   The _Gran Turismo_ series have notoriously contained some cool Nazi cars.
    -   In _4_, there is a nearly-useless, yet futuristic-looking-for-1935 Auto Union Type C Streamline racing car. As useless as it doesn't go into GT5. However, it's back in GT6 where it can be driven everywhere like Stupid Jetpack Hitler in race tracks. Of course, the handling is very terrible.
    -   GT5 adds two more Nazi cars, the Kubelwagen and Schwimmwagen. Players can drive these Nazi military vehicles as usual.
-   In _The Reckoning_, one of the joinable factions is the Aryan Brotherhood, a whole faction of neo-nazi wearing coats with swastikas, swastika tattoos, and wielding World War Two-era German guns (the game is set in 2019).
-   _Pathway_, another pulpish game, puts the player as the leader of a team of adventurers who clash against Nazi mooks accompanying German archaeological expeditions in 1936's North Africa and Middle East.
-   _South Park: The Stick of Truth_; partway through the plot, a UFO crashes and starts leaking green goo into South Park. Anything that touches to goo turns into a Nazi Zombie, complete with _swastika_ armband and Hitler voice clip. This includes regular citizens, rats, aborted fetuses, and Kenny.
-   One of the early bosses in _Brutal Orchestra_ is Trigger Fingers, who is a cowardly and sobbing Nazi holding a gun to his head. His instant-kill attack (a Boom, Headshot!) also deals 1945 damage should it connect.
-   The Medic from _Team Fortress 2_ is an interesting example; he actually _isn't_ a Nazi, but he borrows heavily from this trope (especially the stock phrases) to the point that many players genuinely suspected him to be a former Nazi until Valve explicitly stated that, no, he isn't and never was.
-   Zig-Zagging Trope in _We Happy Few_. The game takes place in an Alternate History where the Nazis won WWII but Hitler and the Nazi party actually lost control of Germany, and Hitler himself was deposed from power. What was left re-formed into the German Empire and went about invading Europe and the Soviet Union anyways, and actually ended up successfully occupying Britain partially due to the competence of Germany's new leader and the incompetence of the US president who replaced FDR, who was also assassinated in this alternate history. Despite not being actual Nazis, however, the German Empire apparently does not skimp on cruelty themselves, including taking all of Wellington Wells's children.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Brave Resistance_ which takes place in WWII there are examples of a variety of Nazi types from the cultured one to the misanthropic sadist.
-   _Rasputin Catamite_: Dima Satan slaughtered a gang of neo-Nazi skinheads at a New Year's party. Zoya wants to change her neo-Nazi ways, but her bigotry is so entrenched, she continues to make gigantic verbal faux pas.
-   _Roswell, Texas_: The "A Bit Gay" stereotype is brought to its logical extreme in this Alternate History webcomic. where the standard SS uniform is _pink_. Bondage gear also makes an appearance.
-   A dead serious example in _Without Moonlight_. The Nazis are occupying the area and treat the local people with smug disdain at best. At worst...
-   _Scandinavia and the World_: Nazi Germany is actually an entirely separate character from modern-day Germany, and completely opposite to him as well: Nazi Germany is a greedy demanding Jerkass who keeps Greece's art, whips Poland, and demands Denmark make him sex dolls, while modern Germany is The Atoner who Apologises a Lot and fears showing Patriotic Fervor.
-   _Hipster Hitler_ has to be seen to be believed. He's two targets in one!
-   _Subnormality_: Two Nazi "scientists" routinely fumble around with time machines, cubing guns, and R/C Landkreusers in the webcomic.
-   The Cliffhangers theme of _Irregular Webcomic!_. In fact, when World War II actually _starts_, the main characters are shocked that the Nazis have stopped being wacky.
-   Lipatov's Hitler vs. Stalin is a perfect example of trope deconstruction.
-   In _The Specialists_, the _Übermenschen_ represent several of the stereotypes listed above.
-   In _Misguided Light_ Nazi war criminal Albert Speer returns from the dead and goes right back to spouting the same revisionist history that he did when he was alive. At least he is cuter this time around.
-   In _Without Moonlight_ there's a range of assorted Nazi types, as it takes place during the Nazi Occupation in Greece, from the cold technocrat to the patriotic party member.

    Web Original 

-   _Angel of Death_ features Kaburlduth, an SS officer intent on finishing what the Nazis started. For now, he seems content to lead a group of neo-nazis who frequently beat random non-white people to death and refuse to devour the souls of anyone who is white.
-   _Atun-Shei Films_: Klaus is a fervent unapologetic Nazi who survived WWII to modern times without aging, and refuses to acknowledge his party's defeat and destruction. He answers an advertisement for a roommate and becomes a very annoying one.
-   _The Gmod Idiot Box_ has two: _Angry German Kid_ (which later evolved into _Furious German Man_), and the _Femi-Nazis_ in the April Fools YouTube Poop _Bobby Will Never Be MLG_.
-   _Reds!: A Revolutionary Timeline_: Currently the primary villains of the AlternateHistory.com timeline.
-   _The German Risk AAR_ has these, with an emphasis on _wacky_.
-   _Hitler Rants_ takes a film about the downfall of the Nazi regime, and put Gag Subs on them, turning the members seen into comedic versions of their character, ranging from The Trickster, A Commander Contrarian, a guy whose nickname is Dr. Skeletor, and a guy whose talent is pointing things on maps. Their leader turns into a Drama Queen with a Hair-Trigger Temper who responds to minor inconveniences with over-the-top meltdowns.
-   _Jreg_ has the "White Identitarian", of course. In keeping with _Centricide_'s anti-centrist theme, he has good and bad qualities, but serves as the butt of more jokes than the other extremists.
    
    **Narrator**: so you don't like being called a "Nazi?"
    
    **Nazi**: absolutely, it's very hurtful.
    
-   _World War II_: They're not wacky at all and their crimes and motivations are laid out with stark brutality in the series "War Against Humanity".
-   _Worm_ has Empire Eighty-eight, a group of Neo-Nazi supervillains who are one of the major powers of Brockton Bay. Individual members of the group vary wildly in ideology, from Kaiser, a cynical manipulator who only uses the group for his own ends and could care less about the ideals it was founded on by his father Allfather, to Hookwolf, a Blood Knight who cares only for the Aryan ideal of the warrior above any racism, to Purity, who thinks of herself as a hero who just happens to murder non-whites.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_ has Hans and Gruber, Kaiba's two henchmen who talk in stereotypical German accents, try to convince "Herr Kaiba" to change the logo of Kaibacorp to one resembling the Nazi flag and randomly shout "Heil Kaiba!"
-   Super powers first started becoming common in the _Whateley Universe_ around WWII so many of the early super villains started off as Nazi "theme agents". Even in the modern day setting enough over the top "Fourth Reich" types are still goose stepping around that the in universe version of this page has a large "Real Life" section dedicated to them.
    
    Baron Blitzen had never understood that. He'd built his entire identity around a vision of Hitler's Germany which had only existed in propaganda sheets, then complained that no one ever took him seriously. The man could not even hold onto his trophy wives for long; the bitches were often more ambitious and talented than he had ever been. As she recalled, Blitzen had large virtual paragraphs of material dedicated to him in the "Real Life" section of that TV Tropes page, which underscored how pathetic he'd become by the time he'd retired.
    
-   Count Dankula's most famous video features him teaching his girlfriend's pug, Buddha, to lift his paw to "Zieg Heil" and get excited to "Gas the Jews" as a prank.

    Western Animation 

-   They are natural comedic villains in many wartime cartoons:
    -   Donald Duck **(!)**, in the anti-Nazi propaganda short _Der Fuehrer's Face_, dreams that he is a bumbling Nazi mook driven mad by working in a munitions factory, where he is required to heil at every picture of Hitler. This is enforced by an armed oom-pah band.
    -   _Education for Death_ mostly portrays the Nazis as dangerous and menacing, save for a short Played for Laughs scene where Hitler is depicted as a German Knight in Shining Armor coming to save Nazi Germany, depicted as a Brawn Hilda character, from an evil witch that supposedly represents Germany's enemies.
    -   Daffy Duck works for the Allied forces battling a Nazi Femme Fatale Spy in _Plane Daffy_ and a Nazi hawk commander in _Daffy the Commando_.
    -   _Herr Meets Hare_ has Bugs fighting off Hermann Goering, depicted as a bumbling fool.
    -   _The Ducktators_ pokes fun at Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Hideki Tojo.
    -   _Russian Rhapsody_ depicts Hitler himself being beaten up by gremlins. When he gives a typical ranting speech a title card appears with the note: "Silly, isn't he?"
    -   _Tokio Jokio_ has cameos by Nazi propagandist Lord Haw-Haw, Adolf Hitler and Rudolph Hess for one joke in an otherwise predominantly anti-Japanese cartoon.
    -   The Tex Avery short _Blitz Wolf_ depicts Hitler as the wolf coming to battle The Three Little Pigs and failing miserably at it.
        -   This is, however, generally subverted in cartoons like _Private Snafu_ and other cartoons intended for military consumption, where the Nazis are often portrayed comedically, but are ultimately highly threatening. This is generally due to the different demands of civilian and military propaganda; civilian propaganda is intended to show people far from the front that the enemy is not an serious threat, the military stuff is intended to show people near the front that the enemy is a serious threat and needs to be treated as such.
-   Blitzwing from _Transformers: Animated_ manages in some way to be an example of a number of the above stereotypes with his Multiple Personality Disorder. In fact, even single faces manage to involve various stereotypes. Specifically, Icy would be the cultured and maybe the nobleman one, Hothead would be the loud Blood Knight, and Random would be the kinky gay one slash the torture master (though just with the giggling, gloves, and general craziness).
-   Megabyte's minion Herr Doktor in _ReBoot_ is a reasonably good approximation of the mad doctor mentioned above, albeit toned down for kids.
    -   "Mein digits!"
    -   It may have snuck in a time or two in the first two seasons, but from the third season on, he explicitly referred to Megabyte as "Mein Führer", with everything the title entails.
-   In the fourth season of _The Venture Bros._, the Nazis bring Rusty a dog who is the reincarnation of Hitler, asking him to clone Hitler back to human form.
    
    **Doc Venture:** Clone Hitler, that's all you Nazis ever want to do!
    
-   In one episode of _Hey Arnold!_, Grampa tells the story of how, during his days as a soldier in World War II, he was caught by a Nazi panzer division while looking for a place to dump some bad meat. In addition to having smiley faces in place of swastikas, the CO of the division uses highly convoluted logic to decide that Phil's earlier warning ("Don't! It's bad meat!") to mean that the meat is good. Phil recognizes that his best hope for survival is letting the CO think he's the smarter of the two. The result is the Nazis becoming sick from food poisoning.
