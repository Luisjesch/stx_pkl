_"You must pay for these crimes against art! The only question is... how will you be **art-xecuted**?!"_

The Art Attacker is a character who uses Art as a weapon. This could be paint, puppetry, music, video, etc.

Unlike a Starving Artist (who is dying _for_ their art), an Art Attacker has someone else dying _from_ their art. The attacker can be, but is not necessarily, a Mad Artist or a Cultured Badass. Their Weapon Specialization might be an Instrument of Murder, The Pen Is Mightier, a Weaponized Camera, or something else. They may be able to create Anomalous Art. And if they run a Wax Museum Morgue, then their victims are very, very screwed.

Super-Trope to the following:

-   Comedy as a Weapon
-   Dance Battler
-   Marionette Master
-   Musical Assassin
-   Paper Master
-   The Power of Acting

Examples fitting any of the above should be listed on their own pages. Sub-Trope of Improbable Weapon User. Compare Art Initiates Life, Brown Note, Imagination-Based Superpower, and Rewriting Reality.

This trope has nothing to do with the TV series, _Art Attack_. Or someone literally or metaphorically attacking a piece of art.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Clover_ has the captain of the Azure Deer, Rill Boismortier. Despite behaving like an energetic and excitable kid, he is an extremely formidable Magic Knight due to his Picture Magic creating anything that he paints. By proxy, the elf Lira possessing his body borrows his magic and uses it in forced blind hatred against the Clover Kingdom.
-   _Fairy Tail_ has Pict Magic, a subtype of Holder Magic, by which practitioners can summon items or familiars, generate attacks including fire blasts, or rend holes in the earth. Reedus Jonah, a minor member of the titular guild, is the most well-known user of Pict Magic and prior to the timeskip he was comically huge and rotund so that he can use his giant stomach as his canvas.
    -   The Dark Guild Red Hood is made up of members who all use advanced Pict Magic; they're so skilled with it, they don't need canvases and can just draw in the air. They're also capable of Unison Pict, the pinnacle of Pict Magic which allows them to combine their drawings into the most advanced of spells.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: Kakyoin does this while he's Brainwashed and Crazy early in the story. He attacks Jotaro by making a painting of him, then slashing the leg with red paint, causing a gash to appear on Jotaro's leg; later on, he uses a marionette to control the school nurse's body. After he's freed from DIO's mind control, it's shown that this was all unnecessary (since he then fights directly along with his Stand Hierophant Green), suggesting that it was just theatrical flair.
    -   _Diamond is Unbreakable_:
        -   Koichi Hirose's Stand Echoes is mostly based around the use of manga-style onomatopoeias. Its first form can make people hear a sound that he paints on their body. He uses this for a number of purposes, including torturing a con artist by writing things like 'boom' and 'crash' on him over and over again, stopping his mother from committing suicide by writing 'believe in me!', and tricking another enemy into stopping for a nonexistent train by writing 'ding ding ding'. Echoes' second form can actually cause physical effects with its onomatopoeias, like making something intensely hot by writing 'sizzle' and making something bouncy by writing 'Boing!'.
        -   Rohan Kishibe can turn people into books in which he can read their life story. He can also 'edit' the text of those books, which can cause a number of effects on his enemies; his most common use of this power is writing 'Cannot attack Rohan Kishibe', which prevents the target from fighting against him, but he's also blinded people, catapulted them through the air, forced them to self-immolate, and taught them to speak Italian.
    -   _Stone Ocean_:
        -   Ungalo's Stand; Bohemian Rhapsody, causes fictional characters over the entire earth to come to life. When a person runs into a character they like, they get the character's role and are doomed to share their fate. For example, if you really like Vincent van Gogh and run into one of his self portraits, you will cut off your own ear and kill yourself. How is the Stand beaten? Weather Report has Vincent van Gogh draw a fictional character whose ability is to stop Bohemian Rhapsody.
        -   In the spin-off, _Whitesnake's Miscalculation_, Fujiko Fujiyama's Stand; Bad Romance, is connected to her art. In order to be able to use it, someone needs to get a drawing from her to form a connection, and from them on, she can influence the person emotional status as she draws.
-   _Medaka Box_: The last episode of Medaka Box abnormal introduces an painter by the name of Fude Ezumachi. His color of beauty allows him to control colors and their associations. For example, his brittle grey paint makes objects brittle and fall apart. His blue paint covers the opponent with "bruises" and the body registers the pain as real. He'd be a fearsome character if he weren't just a one shot filler character.
-   _Naruto_ has a sizable stable of art weapon users. Sasori, Kankuro and Chiyo are trained puppetmasters, Deidara uses explosive clay, and Sai can bring his paintings to life. Sasori and Deidara, like the _One Piece_ example, were partnered, but constantly argued over whose definition of art was superior (Sasori argued that art should be eternal and sought to make indestructible puppets, while Deidara believed true art was ephemeral and thus explosions were the ultimate expression of art).
    -   The meeting of all of the above but Chiyo was the very first battle of the Fourth Ninja War arc. Chiyo got there later, after Sasori "left."
    -   There's also Konan and her origami.
    -   _Boruto_: Inojin has unique paintings like Sai, Hako Kuroi's puppets, Denki's scientific ninja tools etc.
-   Benisato, one of the Quirky Miniboss Squad from _Ninja Scroll_, uses her serpent tattoos to unleash venomous snakes upon her opponents.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Mr. 3, who uses wax sculptures, and Miss Goldenweek, who uses color to paint on Status Effects or other powers. They are paired together due to their art theme.
    -   Giolla of the Doflamingo Family is an even more literal version of this, as her power lets her transform things (and people) into abstract art using thought clouds.
    -   The former Supernova rookie Scratchmen Apoo ate a devil fruit allowing him to turn his body parts into musical instruments. The catch is that some of the soundwaves he produces cause slashes and explosions.
    -   Evening Shower Kanjuro can make anything he draws come to life to help him. Though there's a hilarious subversion from other people in One Piece (and probably Manga in general) who use magical drawings; Kanjuro's drawings are _awful_, and most of his attacks are squiggly and pathetic, and turns what could easily be one of the strongest Devil Fruits in the world (an Imagination-Based Power in a world where power increases are entirely determined by imaginative thinking instead of linear increases) into a complete and utter joke. At least, until it's revealed that he's not using his dominant hand to be unthreatening while playing the part of The Mole, when he switches to his actual drawing hand he proves exactly as dangerous as his power should entail him being.
-   _Sailor Moon_: Binah from the first arc does this by turning her feathers into quill pens, making them draw things in the air and turning those drawings into real things.
-   In _YuYu Hakusho_, Kurama goes up against a demon who uses make-up to power himself and de-power others.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_: The minor villain Pix has the power to bring her tattoos (body art) to life.

    -   Meanwhile, John Stewart was an architect, and all of his ring constructs have blueprint-like attention to detail.
-   _Spider-Man_: Wilhelm van Vile (a.k.a. 'Painter of 1000 Perils'), a foe of Spider-Man's and the Human Torch, possesses enchanted paints that allow him to paint inanimate matter to life. These creations can be erased from existence if he desires so. On top of that, the paints grant him superhuman speed when painting.

    Fan Works 

-   _Pokémon Wack_: The Paint type has been added. As you may expect, Smeargle (A painter Pokémon that uses its paint brush shaped tail to both paint and attack) has been given this type, as well as Octillery's Mega Evolution (which is exclusive to this game).

When Douglas Winter attempts to blast the Wrath painting with a shotgun, the painting sucks the shotgun into itself. The now-painted shotgun barrel then emerges from the painting and blasts Douglas.

-   One group of interest for the _SCP Foundation_ is the art group "Are We Cool Yet?", who specialize in producing artwork with anomalous properties - sometimes with deadly results.

-   Thanks to it being an aerosol, a can of spray paint could help you out in a fight in more ways than one. Orange paint is also used by police forces in Japan during car chases. During the chase, motorcycle units with special paint cannons will approach the targeted vehicle and spray it with the paint, which is difficult to wash off. Should the vehicle escape, it can be identified later.
-   Pens and pencils are valid choices for a self-defense weapon if the wielder is trained to use them effectively, as they can easily be used as shivs that are socially acceptable to carry in public. "Tactical pens", made from rugged materials with an intentionally sharp design, are even designed with this use in mind.
