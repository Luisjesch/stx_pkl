_"The secondary characters are singing a song_

_While the stars are snacking off-stage_

_It was their idea to bring us along_

_And now we're hijacking this page_

_Of the script_

_We're equipped_

_To steer the ship_

_'Til this trippy skit ends_

_And by the end of this song, we'll be best friends"_

In the same way that the Villain Song is the classic moment for the villain of a musical to have a chance to shine and expand upon their philosophy of life, the Sidekick Song is the chance for the hero's comedy sidekick to have their moment in the sun—have a few laughs, spread the joy, that sort of thing. The Sidekick Song typically explains why the Sidekick's abilities and/or philosophy are of service to The Hero. The Sidekick may also perform the "I Am Great!" Song for the Hero or Villain, as they may be too humble to do it for themselves, or they may need a Pep-Talk Song. Yet, the Sidekick Song may have little to do with The Hero's Journey at all, and is rather about Sidekick's own dreams and ambitions. The song doesn't have to be positive but usually is. The Sidekick Song can sometimes be combined with the Villain Song for Anti Villains or Magnificent Bastards.

Often goes hand in hand with Disney Acid Sequence.

    Film - Animated 

-   Disney Animated Canon:
    -   "The Silly Song" from _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_, "Heigh-Ho" is another example.
    -   "Give a Little Whistle" from _Pinocchio_.
    -   "The Work Song" and "Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo" from _Cinderella_
        -   "At the Ball" from the second sequel
    -   "The Bare Necessities" from _The Jungle Book (1967)_. "I Wanna Be Like You" provides an Anti-Villain example (if King Louis can even be called a villain).
    -   "Why Should I Worry" from _Oliver & Company_ — the Dodger isn't comic relief in the end, but it's very much a "let me astonish you, young stranger, with tales of my carefree lifestyle" song.
    -   "Under the Sea" from _The Little Mermaid (1989)_.
    -   "Be Our Guest" from _Beauty and the Beast_.
        -   With a bonus, "Human Again," in the Broadway show.
    -   "A Friend Like Me" from _Aladdin_, though Genie fans might consider "One Jump Ahead" to be the _true_ Sidekick Song.
    -   "Hakuna Matata" from _The Lion King (1994)_...except the main character sings in it as well
        -   "Circle of Life" may also count, as it is implicitly sang by Rafiki in the movie (and explicitly in the play).
        -   "Upendi" from the sequel.
    -   "A Guy Like You" from Disney's _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_.
    -   "One Last Hope", sung by Phil in _Hercules_.
        -   Also "The Gospel Truth", "Zero to Hero", and "A Star is Born" for the Muses.
    -   One of the Cut Songs from _Mulan_ "Keep 'em Guessing" was supposed to be one for Mushu. Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po get a song in the form of "A Girl Worth Fighting For" which has a reprise in the sequel, along with the background soldiers, although Mulan does sing one line of it—which is immediately rejected by the three as silly.
    -   _Every song_ from _The Princess and the Frog_ counts except "Down in New Orleans", "Almost There" and "Friends on the Other Side".
    -   "I've Got A Dream" from _Tangled_, though the leads Rapunzel and Flynn do join in near the end of the song (Flynn very reluctantly).
    -   "In Summer" from _Frozen_.
        -   Also the rock trolls' song "Fixer-Upper".
        -   "This Will All Make Sense When I'm Older" from _Frozen II_
    -   _Encanto_ has two.
        -   "What Else Can I Do?" for Isabela.
        -   "Under the Surface" for Luisa, perhaps more explicitly than the former.
-   "Make Your Life a Party" from the obscure _Katy the Caterpillar_.
-   "No Girl's Toy" from _Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure_
-   Sunny from _Strange Magic_ has "Three Little Birds" by Bob Marley and the Wailers.

    Film - Live-Action 

-   In _Chicago_, Billy Flynn has three songs—"All I Care About is Love," "Press Conference Rag," and "Razzle Dazzle" —that all relate to how he serves as an older Hyper-Competent Sidekick for Roxie (and, to a lesser extent, Velma).
-   Two of them from the Chuck E. Cheese Made-for-TV Movie _Chuck E. Cheese in the Galaxy 5000_:
    -   "The Real Me" for Helen Henny, as she voices her jealousy over Chuck E.'s relationship with Astrid the night before the qualifiers.
    -   "Snowball's Chance in Texas" for Jasper T. Jowels, sung at the soda shop after Chuck E. comes in last and barely manages to qualify for the final race, and when the X-Pilots mock him alongside Helen supposedly betraying him.
-   "Make 'Em Laugh" from _Singin' in the Rain_, possibly the most obvious example of this trope. "Moses Supposes His Toeses Are Roses", a duet between the hero and comedy sidekick, also counts.
-   "I've Got a Golden Ticket" in _Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory_ is this for Grandpa Joe, with Charlie joining in later. (See Musical below for the equivalent song in another adaptation of the story.)

     Musical  

-   In _13_ Patrice has so many solos/songs we can't even count her. Archie has "Get Me What I Need", "Any Minute" Is a Brett/Kendra duet, "Opportunity" Is a bizzare mixture of this, the Bad Girl Song, and Villain Song. and "Bad Bad News" is this for all the boys, while "Brand New You" is this for the girls.
-   From _Avenue Q_, "If You Were Gay", "The Internet is for Porn", "You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want", "There is Life Outside Your Apartment, and "The More You Ruv Someone" and all the Cut Songs all serve this Trope. Actually, More than 60% of the play IS this trope.
    -   It helps if you just pretend the entire cast is the main character. The real main characters aren't really that much bigger parts than the rest, anyway.
-   Though the song itself isn't thought of as comical by the characters, "Kids" from _Bye Bye Birdie_ gives the parents of the teenagers in the show a chance to say just what they think about the changing postwar culture.
-   "Don'cha Pinch Me Charlie" in _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ becomes a Crowd Song as the Bucket family and the press celebrate Charlie's Golden Ticket find, but most of it is handled by Older Sidekick Grandpa Joe (in fact, he's the one who demands the other bedridden grandparents follow his lead and get out of bed to join in!). Charlie gets a verse and chorus to himself, but it's telling that he lets Grandpa Joe lead everyone in the final stretch!
-   Being an ensemble-style show, _The Drowsy Chaperone_ is chock-full of these. There's "As We Stumble Along" for the Drowsy Chaperone herself, "I Am Aldolpho" for Aldolpho, "Toledo Surprise" for the gangsters- _ahem_, pastry chefs, "Fancy Dress" and "Love is Always Lovely in the End" for Mrs. Tottendale and Underling, and "I Do, I Do in the Sky" for Trix the Aviatrix.
-   "Mama Says" from the musical version of _Footloose_ gives Ren's best friend Willard his chance to (hilariously) shine. Rusty gets her version in "Let's Hear It for the Boy".
-   "Bidin' My Time" from _Girl Crazy,_ by the Gershwin Brothers that extols the slacker's philosophy.
-   In _Guys and Dolls_, "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" is Nicely-Nicely Johnson's Sidekick Song.
    -   He and two other sidekick characters get the opening number, "Fugue For Tinhorns" ("I got the horse right here/His name is Paul Revere...").
    -   For extra funny, Ernie Sabella - the voice of Pumbaa in _The Lion King (1994)_ - performs "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" in the 1992 Broadway Revival of _Guys and Dolls_. And Nathan Lane (who voiced Timon) played Nathan in that production.
-   _Hairspray_ has "Run and Tell That" by Seaweed and Inez, and "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful," by their mother, Motormouth Maybelle.
    -   Not to mention "You're Timeless To Me" for Wilber and Edna Turnblad.
-   _Hamilton_: "Guns and Ships" is arguably one for Lafayette. Angelica gets one with "Satisfied", as well as "The Schuyler Sisters" with Eliza and Peggy.
    -   Somewhat stretching the definition of "sidekick", Washington gets two notable solo songs, "Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story" and "One Last Time".
-   The _villain's_ sidekicks get one in _Kiss Me, Kate_: "Brush Up Your Shakespeare." And it's quite possibly the most well-known song in a show _made_ of songs you've heard before but can't quite remember where (in particular, "Another Openin', Another Show," and "Too Darn Hot," which are themselves both sidekick songs).
-   In _Mame_, "Gooch's Song" has Patrick's mousy nanny Agnes Gooch comically explain that she took Mame's advice to be more free-spirited and ended up with a Surprise Pregnancy in the process.
-   _Mamma Mia!_ gives us Tanya's "Does Your Mother Know" and Rosie and Bill's "Take A Chance On Me".
-   "I Like Him" and "A Little Gossip" from _Man of La Mancha_ neatly sum up (with a few interjections from Aldonza) Sancho Panza's personality.
-   "Master of the House" from _Les Misérables_, despite being the musical's main Villain Song, is also the musical's main moment of _light relief_.
    -   Also, Gavroche sums up his life philosophy in the plucky "Little People."
-   The _very_ bizarre "Shipoopi" from _The Music Man_.
-   "Get Me to the Church on Time" from _My Fair Lady_, sung by Eliza Doolittle's rascally father Alfred.
    -   Also "The Servants' Chorus (Poor Henry Higgins)", sung by Henry Higgins' staff.
-   "Sonya Alone" is one for Sonya in _Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812_, though it is serious and poignant, rather than a traditional comic sidekick song.
    -   "Balaga" is a raucous "I Am" Song for One-Scene Wonder Balaga, a popular and infamous troika driver.
-   _Next to Normal_ has "I've Been" for The Caretaker Dan, and "Everything Else" for Deadpan Snarker Natalie.
-   "Everything's Up To Date In Kansas City", "I Cain't Say No" and "All Er Nothing" from _Oklahoma!_ provide a set of songs for the comic relief _couple_. Meanwhile, "It's A Scandal! It's A Outrage!" provides one for the peddler Ali Hakeem.
-   In _Oliver!_, "You've Got To Pick A Pocket Or Two" serves as an Anti Villain Song for Fagin.
    -   "Consider Yourself" sung by The Artful Dodger.
    -   Fagin also gets arguably the most fun song in the entire show, "Reviewing the Situation." He shares the reprise with Dodger.
-   An unusual example in _Only You Can Save Mankind: The Musical_. Bigmac is one of Johnny's sidekicks, and he gets the song "My Brother's Eyes". Only Bigmac's subplot is the most serious part of the story, and the song reflects that.
-   _RENT_ has "Today 4 You", Angel's upbeat and bouncy song... about killing a dog, "Over the Moon", where Maureen implements a nursery rhyme into a nonsensical performance art piece, and "Santa Fe", about Collins' dream of opening a restaurant out west.
-   "The Creation of Man" in _The Scarlet Pimpernel_. And although the hero sings a lot of it, the hero is also his own comic sidekick.
-   The older brothers in _Shenandoah_ are sort of ensemble sidekicks for the father, the youngest brother, and the (only) sister, and they get one song in which each of them have either a solo or a duet: "Next to Lovin' (I Like Fightin')", in which they brag about their prowess in the manly arts. No, the _second_ kind. It's also the only really _funny_ song in a show made primarily of angst (being set in Virginia during the Civil War).
    -   Gabriel the slave boy teams up with the youngest brother in their own Sidekick Song "Why Am I Me?"
-   _Spring Awakening_: "My Junk". It's a rare non-angst song where the girls sing about their crushes, one guy sings about his crush on his piano teacher and another sings about his love of masturbation. Hilarity ensues.
-   "Not While I'm Around" from _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_.
-   "Baby, Dream Your Dream" is a bittersweet one sung by Nickie and Helene in _Sweet Charity_.
    -   Herman leads a high-spirited crowd number near the end of the show, "I Love to Cry At Weddings". Nickie, Helene, and Rosie pitch in at various parts.
-   "Secondary Characters" from _\[title of show\]_ is the most self-referential example, as well as a _sidekick duet_. "I Am Playing Me" and "A Way Back to Then" are about Heidi's apprehension over her career while "Die, Vampire, Die!" is about Susan's quirky outlook on being an artist. "What Kind of Girl Is She?" is about a (potential) rivalry between the two.
-   _Waitress_ has Dawn's "I Want" Song "When He Sees Me", "Never Ever Getting Rid of Me" and "I Love You Like a Table" for Ogie and Dawn, "I Didn't Plan It" for Becky, and "Take It From an Old Man/Ma'am" for Joe/Josie.
-   "Dancing Through Life" from _Wicked_ is a combination of this and a Villain Song... at least on the surface. This being _Wicked_, Hidden Depths abound.

     Opera  

-   Mozart seems to have been fond of these: both Leporello in _Don Giovanni_ and Papageno in _The Magic Flute_ get them. So do quite a few secondary characters in _The Marriageof Figaro_, which also puts the officially-a-sidekick Figaro in the lead.

     Web Original  

-   "Nobody Wants To Be Moist" from _Commentary! The Musical_ - basically a Sidekick Song that was cut from _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_ and put into the commentary.
-   "Partners" from the cancelled Persona 4 Musical for Yosuke.
-   "Get Back Up" from _Starship_ is this for Taz, although the trope is subverted in that she is Commander Up's former sidekick/mentee, and not Bug's.
-   "I'm Just a Sidekick" from _A Very Potter Senior Year_ for Ron Weasley. Double points for being almost entirely about accepting his position as a sidekick.
