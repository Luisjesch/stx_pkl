_"Oh no! What is the world coming to... when a squirrel can't even go to a dinosaur-themed world without getting mugged by a bunch of prehistoric brats!"_

Prehistoria is the trope for Video Game Settings taking place in the Lost World or Hollywood Prehistory. Cavemen abound chasing Nubile Savages, while dinosaurs will live in volcanoes or breathe fire and eat anyone who comes too close. Expect a blend of Jungle Japes and Lethal Lava Land.

A rarer variant may mix in Slippy-Slidey Ice World for an Ice Age setting — replacing the dinosaurs with prehistoric mammals like mammoths and saber-toothed tigers.

Typically features a mix of different prehistoric creatures — like mastodons and triceratops living side by side and Everything Trying to Kill You. Expect to kill a lot of dinosaurs and/or cavemen. Please ignore the palaeontologists sobbing softly in the corner.

Named after the cave area of _Secret of Evermore_.

Compare Lost World and Hollywood Prehistory, the non-video game versions of this trope.

For the new book series of the same name, see Prehistoria.

## Examples

-   This is the entire setting of many Video Games:
    -   _Dinosaur Planet_ and _Star Fox Adventures_, which mix this with Mayincatec.
    -   _Joe & Mac: Caveman Ninja_ and its sequels (including _Congo's Caper_)
    -   _Bonk's Adventure_ and its sequels
    -   _Dino City_
    -   _Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire_
    -   _Carnivores_ hand waves it, since it's set on a different world that happens to have convergent evolution. Past this weak justification, it's the trope, although it at least separates the dinosaurs and ice age mammals (the mammals going in the more polar regions, the dinosaurs in the more temperate, equatorial islands).
    -   _Roc'n Rope_
    -   _Adventures of Dino Riki_
    -   The _Chuck Rock_ series
    -   The _Prehistorik_ series
    -   _Bignose the Caveman_
    -   _Ugh!_
    -   Any games based on _The Flintstones_.
    -   _Saurusland_, a primitive game that was one of the first releases for the MSX and Tomy Pyuuta.
    -   _Trog_
    -   _Far Cry Primal_, set in a relatively realistic depiction of the Pleistocene. No dinosaurs, but plenty of mammoths, smilodons, and others
    -   _Wild_ from Michel Ancel
-   The original _Age of Empires_ game has a downplayed example- the first 2 Ages are Stone and Tool, while the latter 2 are Bronze and Iron (sadly, the Copper Age hasn't been added ingame). Basically for the first half of the game, the player will be playing as a caveman living in a hut decorated with bones and wielding a club before starting properly an ancient civilization.
-   _Kirby's Epic Yarn_ has "Dino Jungle" which is in the name and has a bunch of dinosaurs from pterodactyls to tyrannosaurus.
-   _Empire Earth_ like _Age of Empires_ begins the player as humble prehistoric humans who could potentially give rise to mighty civilizations... or chose to stay behind and remain primitive cavemen. Realistically, other players who play better are more technologically advanced (having access to nuclear bombs) will decimate them in combat.
-   _Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped_: The Bone Yard and Dino Might! levels as well as the secret Eggipus Rex. In the former two levels, Crash is chased by a large, scarlet-colored triceratops that aims to crush him, thus serving as the game's equivalent of the boulders and the polar bears from the first two games respectively. In the second level, Crash can also ride a friendly baby dinosaur.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   Dinosaur Jungle in _Sonic and the Secret Rings_. The game is based on the _Arabian Nights_, which made a lot of people wonder why there were dinosaurs... it's actually a reference to the story of Sinbad, although very exaggerated.
    -   _Sonic Rush Adventure_ has Plant Kingdom. While it's not set in prehistoric times, it does have the feel of its setting with giant plant life and the enemies being prehistoric beings such as dinosaurs, including the stage's boss.
    -   Paleo Tarpits from _Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice_.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Much of Dinosaur Land in _Super Mario World_. Cavepeople were added in the cartoon.
    -   The Special/Lightning Cup course Dino Dino Jungle in _Mario Kart: Double Dash!!_, _Mario Kart 7_ and _Mario Kart Tour_.
    -   The fifth chapter of _Super Paper Mario_ uses this setting, but with no dinosaurs to be found, just giant woolly mammoth things.
    -   The Cascade Kingdom (aka Fossil Falls) of _Super Mario Odyssey_ is home to plenty of dinosaurs, alive and dead. The visual focus of the level is the falls themselves, which pass through the fossilized remains of a Triceratops. Also, the outfit Mario can buy here is a caveman costume.
-   _Humankind_ simular to _Age of Empires_ above, starts with a Neolithic hunter-gatherer nomadic tribe which hunts mammoths before making enough progress to develop into a proper ancient civilization, though simular to _Empire Earth_ it can go beyond the period of Antiquity into modern times.
-   65,000,000 B.C.,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in _Chrono Trigger_, with the added touch of humanity fighting against reptilian humanoids called Reptites — essentially dinosaurs with human forms and intelligence. On the party's second visit, they witness Lavos crashing into the earth, causing the mass extinction of dinosaurs and Reptites alike. Hilariously, one of the early player's guides for the game called that age "Prehistoria" which led a fan or two to calling it that until the DS version gave them something better.
-   The Prehistoric Turtlesaurus level from _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time_.
-   The premise of the game _E.V.O.: Search for Eden_ is to evolve your character from tiny fish to mighty land mammal. The whole game is set in a relatively scientifically accurate version of this (except for the aliens meddling with evolution and the dinosaurs living in secluded areas).
-   World 6 (the Cliff) of _Donkey Kong Country Returns_. It's a primeval canyon where brown mud flows in many levels, greatly reducing Donkey's and Diddy's motion when they're soaked in it. There are also dinosaur ribs they can step onto, crumbling rocky platforms, and spiky boulders. Besides the dinosaur ribs, another prehistoric motif is fossils reminiscent of the Leviathan infants from _Metroid Prime 3: Corruption_ (both games were developed by Retro Studios).
-   _Banjo-Tooie_ has Terrydactyland, which serves as the game's fifth action stage. It is a scorched canyon inhabited by three families of cavemen and several dinosaur mooks, and has some areas with quicksand. At the very top of the stage lies Terry, a large pterodactyl who mourns the theft of his eggs (and erroneously accuses Banjo and Kazooie for it, forcing a boss battle), though things get better for him afterwards as the duo agrees to help him find them.
-   Planet Sargasso in _Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction_.
-   A few levels of _Ecco the Dolphin_ were a cross of this and Under the Sea. The enemies included a prehistoric version of the common jellyfish enemy, dinicthys fish standing in for the sharks, giant seahorses, and inexplicably vicious trilobites. Seriously.
-   The Lost Underworld segment of _EarthBound (1994)_. The place (and the monsters in it) are so _huge_ that your party is only a few pixels high by comparison.
-   Tyrannia in the virtual pets game _Neopets_.
-   One of the video game levels in which the _Scooby-Doo_ gang are trapped in the animated movie, _Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase_. And it does have a T. rex and woolly mammoths co-existing. And the characters lampshade it.
-   The first world of the first _Lost Vikings_ game. Its only pretense at actually _being_ a prehistoric world was its dinosaur and human enemies, however, as the stages featured the usual assortment of keys, bombs, and drawbridges found in the other levels. It is called "Prehistoria".
-   Pogo's prehistoric chapter in _Live A Live_.
-   The "Uga Buga" chapter in _Conker's Bad Fur Day_ takes Conker to a Lethal Lava Land cavern inhabited by the Uga Bugas (not to be confused with the U**n**ga Bu**n**gas from _Banjo-Tooie_, though both games were developed by Rare, so they're likely related), as well as sentient boulders that hang around the Rock Solid nightclub. There is also a T. rex marching down a walkway suspended over lava, eating cavemen as it goes. The game lampshades this trope by having Conker complain about how he can't even visit a "dinosaur-themed world" without being mugged by a bunch of cavemen.
-   "Cave Cat 3,000,000 BC" in _Garfield: Caught in the Act_ (arguably inspired by the book/TV special _Garfield: His 9 Lives_, one of which is a cave cat).
-   The Cavelem tribe in _Lemmings 2_.
-   _Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg_ has Dino Mountain. With dinosaur skulls that vomit lava.
-   Planet Sauria in _The Adventures of Rad Gravity_.
-   Prehistoric Plaza in _Power Pete_.
-   _Primal Rage_ combines this with After the End. A meteor crashes into Earth, reverting mankind to cavemen, rearranging the continents, and reawakening the gods. What does this lead to? Dinosaurs and giant apes beating the crap out of each other and eating each other's followers.
-   Level 2 of _Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp_. In this prehistoric era Dirk, Mordroc, and Daphne land in, our hero fights off dinosaurs and _centaurs_!
-   _Time Soldiers_ has a level set in "The Primitive Age."
-   This is quite an odd setting in _Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time_. Set in Gungathal Valley in 10,000 BC, it's home to the standard mix of Stone/Ice Age woolly mammoths, sabretooth tigers, dodo birds, anklyosaurs that act as catapults, pterodactyls (which make even less sense due to the cold), the ancestor of _all_ Coopers, and a jive-talking, garishly dressed painting black bear. The strange disappearance of the local pterodactyl eggs seems to be causing problems, though.
-   _The Journeyman Project_ briefly has you go back 200 million years into the past for a few minutes to obtain a disc containing the entire history of the world, which was placed far enough back in time that the likelyhood of someone tampering with it would be minimal. It is after this task that you begin your real mission.
-   _Jitsu Squad_ has a stage set in a planet where dinosaurs still exists and runs rampant. It was named "_Primal Rage_" as a blatant reference to an older classic dinosaur game.
-   _Joe & Mac_ takes the most cartoonish version and runs (and jumps) with it. Big stone wheels, Nubile Savage babes and pterodactyl rides are all included.
-   In _World of Warcraft_, while there are dinosaurs throughout Azeroth (raptors, stegosaurus-like thunder lizards, and plesiosaurs), it's in Un'Goro Crater that you can also find tyrannosaurs, dimetrodons and pterosaurs, which are found nowhere else in the world. The Crater was a popular questing area as well as a place to tame unusual animals as pets. Its "lost world" feel was reinforced by being the only zone in classic game with no proper town, only a small camp. The entire area is a Shout-Out to _Land of the Lost (1974)_, including the names of the characters and the camp itself ("Marshall's Refuge"). Cataclysm revamped the zone, but made it barely more settled, and explained why it so wild and unsettled: the Titans isolated the area from the world to experiment with lifeforms as they shaped the world.
-   Slash Man's stage in _Mega Man 7_, although all of the dinosaurs are robots.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ has aspects of this; in many ways a standard fantasy setting with a specifically Scandinavian flavour, but nonetheless inhabitant by caveman-like giants, woolly mammoths, and sabre-toothed cats. And there are lots of caves, and Dinosaurs Are Dragons.
-   The Lost Kingdom park in _Theme Park World_, the world of ancient Africa slash South America slash the Middle East.
-   _Cratermaze_ begins its adventure through time in the primitive world. Each time period has two types of enemies; here, it's cavemen and dinosaurs.
-   _Sponge Bob Square Pants Cosmic Shake_: has a Prehistoric version of Kelp Forest which is home to sea bears and prehistoric krabs. It’s also where Pom Pom, a prehistoric version (and possibly ancestor) resides.
-   _The Simpsons_ games:
    -   _Virtual Bart_ has a level where Bart is a dinosaur in Prehistoric times. Enemies in this level include dinosaurs and _Flintstones_\-esque versions of _The Simpsons_' cast, some of which give you corn dogs to restore your health after you defeat them. The first and third acts take place outside a volcanic cave, the second and fourth acts take place inside the volcanic cave, and the fifth and final act takes place in the Ice Age.
    -   _The Itchy and Scratchy Game_ has "Juracid Bath", which serves as the first level of the game. The stage features miniature cavemen-like robots of Scratchy as enemies and a sound-alike of _The Flintstones_' theme song as the background music. The boss of the stage is Scratchy, driving a turtle-like car.
-   The second zone of the Famicom Platform Game _Time Zone_ is a prehistoric world the Status Line calls "9999 BC," with the usual dinosaurs and volcanoes.
-   Stage 4 in _Strider (Arcade)_ brings this to the Amazon forest, and has Hiryu fending off Nubile Savages and a number of dinosaurs.
-   In _Gunman Clive 2_, South America has dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures as both enemies and platforms. The game supposedly takes place in the year "18XX".
-   In _Sesame Street: Countdown_, the seventh level takes place in a prehistoric jungle, complete with dinosaurs.
-   _Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly_ has Jurassic Jungle, which is this mixed with Lethal Lava Land.
-   In _Goofy's Hysterical History Tour_, the first stage takes place in a prehistoric museum exhibit. The boss of the stage is Pete disguised as a caveman.
-   In _Gem Smashers_, Egg Island takes place in a canyon filled with dinosaur eggs. The boss of the stage is a baby pterodactyl who wears eggshells as a hat and overalls.
-   _Caveman Warriors_: Most of the levels in the game are set in this.
-   _Golf Story_: Lurker Valley has shades of this. Features tar pits as hazards, dino skulls and mammoth tusks as set dressing, and the NPCs are all cavepeople who speak in You No Take Candle.
-   In _Home Improvement: Power Tool Pursuit!_, the first world takes place on the set of a prehistoric forest. Animatronic dinosaurs serve as enemies.
-   Jurassic Marsh in _Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time_. The zombies in this world are themed around cavemen, and the world's gimmick are invincible dinosaurs that helps the zombies in various ways (Velociraptors kick zombies past your defenses, T-Rex makes them faster, etc).
-   _Normy's Beach Babe-O-Rama_: The first stage takes place in New Jersey, 65,000,047 BC. It is a prehistoric town that resembles Bedrock, and the background music features a sound-alike of _The Flintstones_ theme song. The goal of this stage is for Normy to rescue Moon-Unity, the Goddess of waves from Ogg the Caveman, who serves as the stage's boss and has captured her to test his new invention, the surfboard.
