_"Oooh Dream Weaver, I believe you can get me through the night..."_

— **Gary Wright**, "Dream Weaver"

The protagonist's sexual dreams about a friend or enemy causes them to reassess their relationship, perhaps realizing they're actually in love with them. Or not, just as long as they're having them. If the content of the dream is homoerotic in nature, expect this to either be played for laughs or used to increase the psychological ramifications of the dream. If paired with Talking in Your Sleep this can cause annoyance to anyone sharing a room with the sleeper and embarrassment for the sleeper.

Truth in Television, of course, though given how many things there are that can cause such dreams, the odds of them happening can often be put down simply to chance rather than any one thing in one's waking life. Among the things studied by science on whether they cause these sorts of dreams more often include sleeping prone (on your front) and eating a particular food prior to sleeping, such as mature cheese.

See also, if they were denying Unresolved Sexual Tension before, Dreaming the Truth. See also Awkwardly Gay Dream, where a character established as being straight inexplicably has a homoerotic mental experience, often played for Cringe Comedy. If the other party is actually present thanks to Dream Walking or other magic, this becomes a Mental Affair.

-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_ manga: Anko dreamed about Noburo during the Okinawa trip. This was replaced in the anime with him walking in on her from the bath because apparently this was more acceptable on TV.

    -   Nagi was having a nice dream with Hayate in it.... and then he suddenly started to seduce her (despite her unconvincing protesting). She's awoken just before it gets NSFW.. by Hayate who then proceeds to give her a Headbutt Thermometer. Ship Tease at its absolute finest.

    -   In the 7th episode, Saya's shown sleeping on the couch with her legs spread, while dreaming of Hirano. Then her thought bubble dips between her legs and wiggles, causing her to blush moan. The scene only lasts a few seconds and is the closest the series comes to showing onscreen sex.

-   Played with in the _Lucky Star_ OVA, when Kagami dreams about Konata casting a spell on her house. To undo the spell, Dream-Konata tells her that she must call out a certain phrase, which she does as she wakes up, only to find her sister staring at her with the wrong idea about what just happened. Specifically, Kagami wakes up saying "I want to \*BLEEP\* with Konata."
-   _Level Up Just By Eating_ has the main character Kehma having this happen to him repeatedly. He has sultry dreams about all the lovely ladies of his party and the sultry inn-keeper Asha, waking up the next morning with a start, disappointed, though chapter 7 of the manga adaptation implies that it wasn't All Just a Dream with Asha, but fails to specify just how far they actually went, seeing as he's in bed with all his clothes on and Asha is nowhere nearby.
-   _Maken-ki!_: Used as a Running Gag in three of its omake chapters, two of which focus on Usui's lust for Himegami:
    -   In the 61.5 chapter, he dreams of being the principal at Tenbi Academy and how he'd change the rules to satisfy his sexual desires. It ends with him dry humping his mattress, while his dream self is being punished by Himegami, who turns out to be the real principal.
    -   The 66.5 chapter has him dreaming of being a hospital director, with Himegami as his nurse secretary. During this, he brings her to orgasm by giving her a medical exam and ends with Usui humping his matress again.
    -   Chapter 84.5 changes things by having him dream of Haruko and Love Espada instead. This time, he's a film director with the girls as his actresses. But instead of filming a love story, like he claims, he has them compete fanservicey mini-games while wearing sling bikinis. It ends with him being relieved of as director by Himegami, who punishes him again.
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: Gojo has a brief one at the start of Chapter 5 (Episode 3 in the anime). At first, he's just dreaming of seeing Marin in the complete Shizuku-tan cosplay that she requested him to do, and then she suddenly starts getting a little _too much_ into the character (for context, said character is from an Eroge videogame, which he spent the previous night playing for research and character references). She then lifts slowly her skirt, causing him to wake up right then, and lifts up his bedsheet in embarrassment.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: Shinji has a particularly Mind Screw\-ish dream (for the audience _and_ himself), including erotic visions of Misato, Asuka, and Rei. Even when Shinji is dreaming of Asuka throwing herself at him, she _still_ refers to him (affectionately) as "baka-Shinji" (stupid Shinji).
-   The protagonist of _Nozomu Nozomi_ has one of these. He's turned into a girl and dreams he changed back, and is having sex with his crush. Half-way through it turns into an Awkwardly Gay Dream, as he imagines himself as a girl having sex with a boy he's growing attracted to.
-   Naturally, Ayato in _RahXephon_ has a similar erotic (although it's a bit more complicated than that) dream about Haruka
-   In _Ranma ½_, the title character's subconscious must either hate him for being a Sex Shifter, or has way too much fun with it, as he keeps getting dreams where guys into girl Ranma make advances on them in either form:
    -   Almost at the beginning of the manga, Ranma had a dream about a mountain-sized Kuno grasping him (in female form, naked) while volcanoes erupted and jet fighters bombed a city. The anime version merely had him (again, naked in female form) in a pool, with Kuno offering his suddenly _very phallic_ wooden sword ("Grab onto this!"); upon refusing, "she" sank to a reef at the bottom of the pool, only to be surrounded by countless naked Kunos (and this was after he had Kuno repeating his declaration of love to male-Ranma, including at one point where they were both naked in the bath). Both times, he woke up screaming his head off.
    -   Once, a dying man named Harumaki sent out his astral projection to haunt Ranma's dreams. The reason: seeing female-Ranma reminded him of his love, Gyoko. The result: Ranma would dream about being a girl on a date with a (seemingly) handsome boy, only for him to turn into the wrinkly, bug-eyed old man as they leaned in for a kiss. The art implied that (male) Ranma woke up screaming _because_ the kiss had been consummated.
    -   Akane herself experienced a unique dream once when cursed to sleep endlessly by a magical incense burner. Not only did she (as the heroine of the dream) expressed definite love for Ranma, but she also saw the competition as cruel dominatrixes (an especially disturbing case with Kodachi,) and, when a Knight in Shining Armor Ranma came to rescue her, she didn't complain much when he brought her down for an amorous tryst.
-   Tsukune has a few in _Rosario + Vampire_, but he calls himself "The lowest of the low" for doing so when he wakes up.
-   Subverted in _Saikano_: Shuji has a nightmare in which Chise appears in full-on Ultimate Weapon mode and threatens to kill him; confused, he turns and sees Fuyumi naked in bed beside him.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ High School AU _Guren Gakuenhen_ has Simon dreaming about Nia this way. Specifically, a naked Nia saying "Okay, Simon... let's gattai!" while in his house.
    -   He wakes up and the last part turns out to be true.
-   _Stop Hibari Kun_: Kousaku has one about Hibari at the beginning of Episode 2.
-   Being a healthy young man, Rito from _To Love Ru_ has a couple.
    -   One notable instance in the first series is when Rito was dreaming about Haruna, which lead to an Almost Kiss between Rito and Lala because she was in his bed again.
    -   An anime-only memorable instance is actually an induced hallucination, featuring Rito, Haruna, _and_ Lala.
    -   By the sequel "Darkness", naturally even the dreams are Hotter and Sexier.
        -   Mea accidentally create one when she enters in Rito's dream with her ability and recreate the bath scene with Momo and Rito naked from the end of chapter 1 (she take the role of Momo).
        -   In Chapter 35 he has a dream about Haruna, Lala, and Run naked in the bath and kissing him.
        -   In Chapter 73, he has a dream about pushing Momo down and grabbing her breasts on purpose (while it actually was Lala in his futon at the time).
-   Played for laughs in _Welcome to the NHK_, where Sato decides to mess with Misaki when she plans on using a book of Freud's to analyze his dreams. The dream Sato tells her is replete with phallic (and to a lesser extent yonic) imagery, causing her to eventually turn beet-red after she finishes analysing it.
-   After Tetsuo from _Yuureitou_ reveals to Taichi that he is assigned female and is the Reiko person they've been looking for, Taichi has a dream where Tetsuo is a Sweet Polly Oliver coming onto him.

    Comic Books 

-   Issue 3 (Volume 2) of _Birds of Prey_ has The Penguin, while knocked out, dream about getting some of Huntress, Black Canary, Dove and Lady Blackhawk. Naturally the girls are disgusted.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Buffy has a sex dream involving both Angel _and_ Spike. With her in a Naughty Nurse Outfit.
-   A very _dark_ variant is featured in _Lady Death_, where Hope has a dream with the very handsome demon Azlando, whom she has unrequited feelings for, but it's implied that he can't return them. She wakes up right next to him and finds out to her horror that she _had brutally killed him_.
-   _Little Ego_ is an adult-oriented, erotic parody of the classic _Little Nemo_ comics written and drawn by Vittorio Giardino. The main character, called Ego, is a woman seemingly in her middle twenties. As in Little Nemo, each story is about her having a dream, and she wakes up in the last panel. Whereas Little Nemo talked to his mother after waking up, Little Ego thinks what she will tell her psychoanalyst. Every story in the Little Ego comic book involves erotic imagery, with Ego appearing half-naked or fully naked in at least one point. She has sexual intercourse with men, with other women, and even with plants and animals. It's suggestive rather than outright porn most of the time — but VERY suggestive — and all in all, a lot better than this description sounds.
-   During the "Dead End Kids" arc of _Runaways_, Victor has a dream about Lillie. While we only see the part where they kiss, it's implied that it gets a lot more erotic just as Molly wakes him up. Since their current living arrangements during that arc don't offer much privacy, he's awkwardly forced to try and explain away his moaning.
-   While exploring Bridget's dreamscape in _Soulsearchers and Company_ #3, Baraka discovers a portion of her mind featuring an erotic dream concerning him.
-   Superman during John Byrne's run on the character's titles during the late 1980s had one of Wonder Woman shortly after he met her near the end of _Legends_.
-   In _Watchmen_, Dan has one about a villainess he once defeated. First he sees himself with the villainess, then with naked Laurie... then they tear their skins off, revealing their costumes underneath. In the movie, they cut out the first bit, because they'd cut out the character. Andddd then a bomb goes off.
-   An elaborate example opens the _XXXenophile_ story "Net Dreams".
-   In _Zatanna (2010)_ #16 a seriously sleep-deprived Zee is woken from a dream involving two hunky men and a tub of cocoa butter when Uriah breaks into her library. She spends the rest of the issue trying to deal with the pest as quickly as possible so she can get back to the dream.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Foxtrot_:
    -   Paige has these all the time, usually involving her being romanced by a handsome Frenchman named Pierre. One dream, however, involved Pierre and a Dashing Hispanic named Juan Carlos fighting over her, the last panel of the strip revealing Andy and Roger discussing that she was trying to decide whether to take French or Spanish in the new semester.
    -   One 1998 Story Arc was about Jason having one of these about Lara Croft. Jason hates girls, however due to the beliefs kids his age have, so he spent the whole dream trying to get away from her. Needless to say, Peter was upset that he didn't get the dream instead.
        
        **Jason:** Oh man Peter, I had the worst dream ever last night.  
        **Peter:** Oh?  
        **Jason:** I dreamed that Lara Croft from "Tomb Raider" was determined to make me her boyfriend or something. It was like eight straight hours of misery. She just would not leave me alone. She even threw herself on top of me four or five times. Judging by the look on your face, I'm guessing you had lousy dreams,too.  
        **Peter:** Jason, are you familiar with the extra little prayer I say each night before bedtime?
        
    -   Peter did have one in a Sunday strip, two _Sports Illustrated_ swimsuit models were fawning over him. As bad luck would have it, they were about to ditch their bikini tops just as his alarm went off.
-   An innocent version of this trope occurred in _Peanuts_, when Lucy went to Linus's room because he was loudly talking in his sleep and she saw he was having an apparently romantic dream about his schoolteacher: "Yes, Miss Othmar, ... why, Miss Othmar."
-   Rat from _Pearls Before Swine_ is often seen having these. One strip implied he was having one about Winona Ryder, and an early Sunday Strip about his alarm clock had him dreaming about "The Land of Naked Supermodels".

    Fan Works 

-   After Shego tells Kim in _Anything's Possible_ that she owes her three favors, Kim's mind goes into the gutter that night. The next day she's more embarrassed about Shego being the top rather than the dream itself.
-   _Between the Lines (MrQuestionMark)_: As said in the Author's Note for The Dream II, the third dream is a Lemon, making this trope.
-   _Blissful Dream_ is a pretty graphic example of an erotic dream, where we get to see inside the mind of the dreamer.
-   In _Chemistry_, Shining accidentally notices his wife Cadance having an erotic dream about his sister Twilight after Cadance moans out Twilight's name.
-   _The Child of Love_ was inspired by a lemon fanfiction where Shinji had erotic dreams about Asuka. In chapter 5, Asuka reveals that she had erotic dreams starring Shinji.

-   An _ER_ fanfic about Doug and Carol has her having these about him, then waking up and seducing her fiancé. He has similar ones about her.
-   _Girls und Panzer_ fanfic, _Erika the Radical_ has the titular character Erika having one about her various crushes at the start of the series 'second season', which kinda messes with her psyche for the rest of the season. It involves an apparently jealous Miho, a _very_ dominant Maho, an unexpectedly submissive Karen and finally comes crashing down with Shiho Nishizumi walking in with the _intent to join in_.
-   _A Glass of Wine_, a NGE fanfic, takes a bit unexpected turn. After Hikari jolting upright in the middle of the night drenched in sweat...
    
    In the dim moon light filtering through the blinds Asuka noticed the condition of Hikari's lower region and understood the ordeal she was bearing. (If you really have to know, she dreamed of the main cast doing an orgy in the classroom after subjecting her to some mild bondage. Rei was the domina. And to think Hikari's the most innocent girl in the entire cast... wonder how she knows so much about _it_.)  
    "That must have been some dream… I want details."

-   Naruto has a rather _intense_ one, that he nevertheless finds himself being disturbed by, in _Here and Now,_ the sequel to _Time and Again_, after being rescued from imprisonment and torture at Orochimaru's hands. Sakura being in it is a natural consequence of the one time they had sex back in the future, Hinata being in it is presumably a manifestation of his as-yet unrealised feelings for her, but _Karin_ being in it is just a straight-up consequence of Stockholm Syndrome.
-   Smurfette has one of her with Hero Smurf in a loincloth while Hero is married to Wonder Smurfette in the _Hero: The Guardian Smurf_ story "Smurfette's Crazy Love".
-   In the _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ PWP fic Jaden Gets Lucky, Asuka has an extremely graphic sex dream about Judai.
-   _Love Can Surprise You At Any Time In Your Life_: In Chapter 5, Leela's second dream about Lars involves a Massage of Love that transitions into implied sex.

-   In _Luna's Power and Rainbow's Love_, Rainbow Dash starts having what are implied to be erotic dreams after realizing she's in love with Fluttershy.

-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_: When Asuka suddenly enters his room the dead of night, Shinji at first thinks it is just a recurring dream of his where Asuka comes in his room and has sex with him. He realizes that he is wide awake when he feels her putting her hand on his shoulder.

    -   Sookie's the first one to provide an example: having Bill's blood after receiving a massive No-Holds-Barred Beatdown from a couple whose plan she had foiled. Bill warns her about the dream but, being a virgin and all, she doesn't quite get it until it happens.
    -   Sam has an Awkwardly Gay Dreamabout Bill after drinking his blood in the season 2 finale to finish off the Big Bad of the season.
    -   In season 2, Eric tricks Sookie into drinking his blood so that she'd start having erotic dreams about him, which eventually she does in season 3. And there's even one that stars both Bill and Eric with her as well (viewers didn't quite complain though).
    -   We don't get to see them, but Lafayette mentions that he had erotic dreams about Eric after drinking his blood... which he likes in a way, but ends up finding them disgusting because of how much he hates Eric.
    -   Jason starts dreaming about Jessica after she healed him with her blood. In one of them, she suddenly turns into Hoyt while having sex with Jason.
    -   Jason also had a dream about Eddie, back in season 2, in which he just appeared on top of him. Although this one is probably due to the guilt he felt due to not stopping Amy from killing him.
    -   And in season 6, Jason drinks vampire blood _again_ and it ends up with an Awkwardly Gay Drema in which he licks Ben's neck while the two are shaving each other naked.
-   _The Vampire Diaries_: Elena has an erotic dream about making out and almost having sex with Stefan in 1x03 "Friday Night Bites". However, Elena's pleasurable, erotic dream ends up going south when Damon invades her dream, with Elena waking up panicking afterwards, scared and shaken up by Damon's presence in her dream.
-   _Will & Grace_. Will has an erotic _nightmare_ about doing it with Grace. He's so disturbed he ends up seeing a therapist and mentions that he usually has these dreams about news anchor Stone Phillips. After resolving the issues with Grace that caused his nightmares he finally gets to dream about Phillips again.
-   An episode of _Wings_ opened with Brian's sexy dream about Helen. This irked Joe, as he was dating her at the time. Helen, on the other hand, had no problem in joining Brian in teasing the elder Hackett brother about it.
-   _Xena: Warrior Princess_: Xena dreams of Ares in "Eternal Bonds". See also Unresolved Sexual Tension and Slap-Slap-Kiss.
-   _Young Sheldon_: In "Money Laundering and a Cascade of Hormones", Mary has a dream about having sex with Pastor Rob.

    Music 

-   Alan O'Day's "Undercover Angel" has the line: "I never had a dream that made sweet love to me."
-   Taylor Swift's "...Ready For It?" gets pretty clear on this one.
    
    _In the middle of the night,_ _in my dreams,_  
    _you should see the things we do, baby._
    

    Theatre 

-   Rod has a "really nice dream" about his roommate Nicky in _Avenue Q_.
-   In the 2009 UK tour of _Little Shopof Horrors_, the plant sleeps at one point and says "Yeah, baby. You make my stems all wooded."
-   Moritz and "legs in sky blue stockings" in _Spring Awakening_. The dreams get worse after Melchior writes an essay for Moritz explaining the ins and outs of sex, leading Moritz to kill himself.

    Video Games 

-   _BlazBlue_'s Bang Shishigami had one with Litchi in the Fourth-Wall Mail Slot.
-   _Crush Crush_: Referenced when selecting Eva at the Girlfriend level:
    
    I dreamt of you last night. It was... It was a dream I could not tell others about...
    
-   Joked with in _Dragon Age II_, when things go from worse to even more worse and Hawke says that this must all be a really bad dream and the next thing they will notice is that they are Not Wearing Pants. To which Merrill can reply "Hawke defending the city while being naked. Why can I never have this dream."
-   The female player character in _Dragon Age: Origins_ can confess to having erotic dreams about Alistair.
-   In _Fallout 3_, at the beginning of game proper, you are woken up by your friend Amata. One of the dialogue options both sexes have is "Amata? I was just dreaming about you..." It's unclear whether this is true, or just your character trying to flirt.
-   In _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, if Morgan and Kjelle get married, then he'll admit to having these about her.
    
    **Kjelle:** You've been... imagining me?  
    **Morgan:** What? Oh, no, I haven't been thinking about you like that! I mean, maybe once... or twice... okay, some of the time, o-or maybe all the time... I'm just going to stop talking now.
    
-   _Fire Emblem Heroes_ brings us Plumeria, a dökkálfar (dark elf) of the Realm of Nightmares. Her job is to deliver erotic dreams to mortals, but doing so has jaded her, finding such dreams disgusting, going as far to wish humans' desires didn't exist.
-   _Lonely Wolf Treat_: In _Dreaming Treat_, at one point the title character dreams of bathing with her crushes Mochi and Moxie.
-   _Story of Seasons (2014)_ has this implied by the female player character if she is married to Mistel. One of his morning dialogue is saying that she has been saying his name in her sleep and wondering what she's dreaming.
-   In _Tales of Phantasia_, depending on whether it's the official or the fan-translated version, Arche dreams (and talks in her sleep) of either making out with Cless, or flat-out having (really good) sex with him, respectively.
-   Then there's Dist in _Tales of the Abyss_. We never do learn exactly what he's dreaming of, but he's moaning Jade's name... And Jade was there. And he replies by implicitly "raping" him offscreen.
    
    **Luke:** Uhhhh, what was that scream just now?  
    **Jade:** Oh, it was nothing.
    

    Visual Novels 

-   _Chop Chop Fruit salad Mystery Jam DokiDoki Dating Sim THingy_: In Banana's route, Apple has a sexy dream about Banana with their peel off.
-   The protagonist of _Daughter for Dessert_ has a sexy dream about Lainie... and before long, it becomes about Amanda.
-   Shirou in _Fate/stay night_ gets one about Rin as well. Interestingly enough it's not in Rin's route. Except when she opens her eyes, her eyes are different. When Rider takes off the visor and you see the same eyes it becomes clear it was Rider in the dream disguised as Rin.
-   In _Fate/hollow ataraxia_, Rider causes Shirou to dream of having a threesome with her and Sakura.
-   The protagonist of _Melody_ has several dreams in which the title character acts sexually coy with him.
    -   Actually, for the first one of these, the player can choose Melody, Isabella, Becca, or Amy as the subject of the dream. It's also a subversion, with the chosen girl leading the protagonist to the shower for sex, only for him to find Bethany in his shower instead.
-   Shiki is _deliberately_ given an erotic dream by Arcueid in _Tsukihime_, as thanks for his assistance. Unfortunately, who he dreams _about_ is the source of much grief for Shiki, since it winds up being about Arcueid. In the anime, the dream itself soon turns into a nightmare when Arcueid makes it clear she wants Shiki's blood (the manga and game went with the sex). In the visual novel, though, you can actually _choose_ who you want the dream to be about. Note that Shiki is awakened every morning by Hisui, one of the maids. It's apparently pretty clear what Shiki's dreaming about as he sleeps. (Unless he dreams about _her_.)
-   It's inverted in _Kagetsu Tohya_, the _Tsukihime_ side story. Len actually has an erotic dream about _Shiki_ where he can do nothing but watch.

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_: In a guest strip, Black Mage has such dreams of White Mage, squicking Fighter out.
-   This _Awkward Zombie_ comic, in which Mewtwo hijacks one of Marth's dreams.
    
    Even Mewtwo has to get his kicks _somewhere_.  
    Even if "somewhere" is inside other people's brains.
    
-   In the _Ciem Webcomic Series_, Candi's erotic dreams about the men in her life are implied to be so intrusive (and memorable) that they interfere with her ability to function in life.
-   In _Dumbing of Age_ Joyce has a rather _odd_ dream about Ethan. Unfortunately it's also mixed in with all her anxieties about sex and turns to horror when dream!Ethan suddenly transforms into Ryan.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Elliot has an introspective dream that turns into one of these about Susan. He later gets another one starting here and culminating in kissing dream-Tedd.
-   In _Friendly Hostility_, Collin is creeped out after having an erotic dream about his friend Arath. Fox assures him that it's natural for him to dream about people other than his significant partner. He goes on to casually list the various people/beings he's had sexy dreams about, which Collin is not enthused to hear in its entirety.
-   _Linburger_. Poor Neut seems to be the only Cyll not getting any in the Free-Love Future hedonistic society. As such, he has sexual fantasies about Lin and the Firne twins Kien-Tai. But mostly Lin.
-   A recurring theme in _Ménage à 3_. Gary, for one, mostly dreams of Zii and DiDi; Yuki has some quite disturbing dreams about Gary — disturbing for the readers in that she sometimes changes his sex, but also disturbing for _her_ in that some of them occur while she's still defining herself as lesbian.
-   In _Nerf NOW!!_ Morgan and Angie have the same erotic dream about each other. Morgan's reaction was to throw a bomb at Tentajo telling him to stop drawing her doing weird things (namely the eroticism), while Angie laughs as she's now got a bingo on her wet dream card. Apparently she's had erotic dreams about Anne, Engie-tan, Samus, Morrigan, Peach, and, according to the next strip, Jane and Alek for her bingo. Anne's disgust at being the target of many of Angie's wet dreams is overridden by the fact that Angie _hadn't_ had one about Anne's sister Victoire. And then Victoire showed off her photoshoot in a gun magazine...
-   In _Sticky Dilly Buns_, the prudish Ruby experiences a dream involving her sort-of boyfriend Andy, expressed in her usual rather formal terms ("Let's kiss in altogether inappropriate ways"). Her growing (if much-denied) interest in Yaoi is reflected when she transforms into the gay Dillon during the dream, but it's also a sad comment on her self-image that she not only takes herself out of the erotic scene but dismisses herself as "boring" in the dream dialogue.
-   _Tiger, Tiger_: Jamis has a number of dreams where he is frazzled by being flirted with by his captain, in increasingly fewer clothes. Eventually he has a dream where his captain starts undressing and then puts his hand on his thigh as Jamis sits on a bed. He tries to put these out of his mind as he's convinced he's straight and doesn't know his captain is quietly pining after him.
-   _Unsounded_: Lady Ilganyag visits erotic dreams on the Black Tongues, and Duane's status as outright falling into the khert at night means she's able to use memories to give him erotic "dreams" as well.
-   _Wet Sand_: Jo has one of Ian after seeing him. Realizing he's having one of him without even knowing his name comedically makes Jo think of himself as a pervert and question his sexuality.
-   _World of Fizz_: Kelli dreams about having sex with Tim.

-   _Batman: The Animated Series_; Barbara dreams of being romanced by Batman, until a phone call from the real one wakes her up.
-   _Clone High_: In "Sleepovers," Joan has a sexual dream about Abe in math class, including bizarre imagery like him turning into a lighthouse.

-   _The Dragon Prince_ provides a G-rated example, as episode 6 begins with Callum apparently having a dream about his crush, Claudia. He claims he was dreaming about sandwiches.
    
    **Ezran:** You seemed _weirdly_ excited about sandwiches.  
    **Callum:** _\[chuckles\]_ You know what? In a few years, when you're older, buddy, we'll sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk about sandwiches.
    
    -   Also Discussed in the Whole Episode Flashback:
        
        **Harrow:** The night \[my father\] died, Lady Justice came to me in a dream.

        **Harrow:** _(playfully)_ She was wearing her robes.  
        **Sarai:** Ugh, so a boring dream.
        
-   In _Family Guy_, Peter dreams about someone named Jenny. Turns out he was dreaming of comedian Richard Jeni and his sweet ass.
-   In the _Futurama_ episode where Fry becomes Bender's roommate, first Fry hears Bender having a "Kill All Humans" dream ("I was having the most wonderful dream... I think you were in it."), then this trope happens. And gets weird.

-   Hinted at in the _Justice League Unlimited_ episode "Fearful Symmetry (a.k.a. Galatea)." Supergirl has confided a recent nightmare to Green Arrow, who says that dreams can feel realistic. He then mentions having one such dream the previous night as he looks over at Black Canary.
-   In an episode of _King of the Hill_, Hank has a dream that he's grilling naked with Nancy. He tells Peggy about the dream and says that she was in it instead. Hank asks John Redcorn what the dream means and then things start to get out of control. In the end, Hank realizes that it was _the propane in the grilling_ that turned him on, not Nancy. He just associated it with her because he had helped her install a propane-powered hot tub in her backyard as a surprise for her husband Dale.
-   _Mike Tyson Mysteries_ has this, but it's more of a coma version in the episode "Life is But a Dream", where the woman in a coma is having sex with her stepson which disgusts Mike's entire team.
-   In _Moral Orel_, Orel has a wet dream about being praised by God, which isn't an example of this trope.

-   _Total Drama_: For a hot second in "This Is the Pits!", reality and dream blur into one as Sky wakes up. Dave is standing over her to offer her berries for breakfast, but what she perceives is an extremely muscular and shirtless Dave offering her a ring and asking her to be his jungle queen.
