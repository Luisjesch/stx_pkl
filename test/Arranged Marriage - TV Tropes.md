_There was a girl  
And there was a man  
And there was the girl's father  
Who said, "You will marry this man."_

In an arranged marriage, the two spouses do not choose each other. Instead, others, usually their parents or guardians, make the selection and arrange the date and any other conditions that might apply, such as the dowry, for them.

The way an arranged marriage is treated by the plot depends on place and time. For most of human history, arranged marriages were the norm because "marriage" was less about the union of two souls and more about the union of two families. The rise of the "Marry for Love" ideal didn't really start in Western culture until the 16th century, and there are places on Earth where arranged marriages continue to be the norm. Additionally, the "Marriage Before Romance" trope often goes hand-in-hand with arranged marriages. While the priority firmly is the union of two families, that union is dependent on the stability and comfort of the two people getting married, so the two families do try their best to come up with a Perfectly Arranged Marriage. The couple's happiness just isn't the main goal the way it is in cultures where marriage follows from love.

However, the one thing that is almost always present in an arranged marriage is tension. Most people don't really want to marry a total stranger (much less have sex with them), and if that total stranger turns out to be a complete rogue and a cad, it may be necessary for the heroes to spring into action and rescue the hapless member of their group who is being forced to walk down the aisle. (Of course, being Big Damn Heroes, they'll have to do so in the most overblown and dramatic way possible.) Sometimes, the person in the arranged marriage takes matters into their own hands and becomes a Runaway Fiancé. The "aggrieved" party may claim Breach of Promise of Marriage in response, as arranged marriages tend to be viewed as legally binding commitments by those who initiate it. Alternately, there's a Love Triangle. The character of the suitor is less likely to be important in those cases, but they generally won't look kindly on the outsider's interference.

It's worth noting that historically, an arranged marriage would _not_ usually be to a complete stranger as far as most people were concerned. Most marriages took place between families that knew each other well—perhaps as vassal and liege, business partners, or (for the vast majority of the people that weren't merchants or noblemen) simply neighbors and friends. At least in the context of Europe, prospective spouses would have opportunities to interact socially and form an opinion of each other, and their feelings would naturally factor into their parents' thinking on the matter. The modern stereotype did, however, often apply to the political marriages of the royalty and high nobility, where the spouses might not even speak the same language in extreme cases.

Conversely, an Arranged Marriage can be used to lock the hero and heroine together so that their disputes can not end with one of them washing their hands of the other.

A common tactic is for the child of a wealthy but common family to be matched with the child of an impoverished family with a title: Nobility Marries Money. Families may even pledge infant children in marriage pacts that cannot be concluded until many years later.

Both in fiction and in Real Life, royal children (sons as well as daughters) were used as pawns in the political game cementing alliances and peace treaties with their marriages. You might say it was their job to take part in such Altar Diplomacy.

The Arranged Marriage is Not to Be Confused with: an Arranged Friendship (the platonic version); a Childhood Marriage Promise (whereby a prepubescent couple voluntarily pledges their own non-legally-binding, future troth); a marriage which may arise out of convenience; or a marriage that arises from some kind of cultural mistake. For clarity's sake, the Arranged Marriage trope will deal only with more binding, traditional types of unions.

See also Parental Marriage Veto, You Have Waited Long Enough, Old Man Marrying a Child, Homosocial Heterosexuality, Royal Inbreeding, and Marriage Before Romance. A Shotgun Wedding is a short-notice forced marriage. If someone agrees to an Arranged Marriage but loves someone else, Courtly Love may be involved. If the people doing the "arranging" in the marriage aren't the parents, that's a Bureaucratically Arranged Marriage.

Often involves Prince Charmless and Rebellious Princess. At least recently, one of the potential spouses was as likely as not to try to defy this. When the audience _really_ doesn't want this marriage, expect the Big Damn Heroes to show up right at the Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace line.

## Examples:

-   Literature

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ai Yori Aoshi_: Kaoru Hanabishi and Aoi Sakuraba are matched in an arranged marriage as young children, to cement a relationship between their powerful corporate households. This is an odd example, however, in that like the previously mentioned _Gankutsuoh_ example, the engagement is technically broken off (Kaoru left his family after being orphaned and then terribly abused by his grandfather): the series' drama results from the two main characters genuinely falling in love and _still wanting_ to get married, but not being able to do so for the whole scandal it'd bring.
-   _Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka_ has Yuuhi being arranged to marry Junichi, since Junichi's parents saved her father. Yuuhi doesn't approve of it, but that may change.
-   Minamo's parents suggest to her (often) to try a modern arranged dating/marriage in the _Azumanga Daioh_ anime. Fellow teacher, best friend, and pain in the rear Yukari shrugs the idea off and says to just do whatever she wants.
-   _Basilisk_: Oboro Iga and Gennosuke Koga were engaged since childhood as a part of the truce between the Iga and Koga clans. It certainly helped that they came to genuinely like the idea when they knew each other better.
-   In _Beelzebub_, Himekawa was revealed to have been engaged to his childhood best friend Kugayama since birth. The issue is that, well...he didn't exactly _know_ that Kugayama was female in the first place. Traditionally, the heir of the Kugayama family is male, and thus she was raised a male. However, when she was young she gained a crush on Himekawa, and her feminine feelings conflicted with her masculine upbringing. Her grandfather, who cared about her deeply, decided to arrange the marriage so that way she could be a woman freely without an restraints. Though due to her not wanting to damage her relationship with Himekawa, she never _told_ him about it, and her eventual betrayal made it so that Himekawa really hasn't been able to trust anyone through a bond of friendship, until Oga came along. He then started bonding with the rest of the Tohoshinki. Then, he met Kugayama again and the truth finally came out. Himekawa has admitted that Kugayama is perhaps the only person he will _always_ consider a friend, and it's implied that while he is probably still confused about his feelings on this arrangement (and that fact that she's _in love_ with him), his feelings do run deeper than platonic friendship.
-   _Black Butler_: Ciel and his cousin Elizabeth have been engaged since they were young. While they aren't going to actually marry anytime soon, it doesn't stop Elizabeth from pouring her affections onto Ciel which in the manga includes a bold Declaration of Protection from Elizabeth herself, and he cares for her in his own way.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   In a flashback arc, it's revealed that Masaki was originally adopted into the Ishida family as part of the matriarch's plan to set up an Arranged Marriage between Masaki and her son Ryuuken. The family's beautiful maid, Kanae Katagiri, is told that the reason the Arranged Marriage will never work as the matriarch hopes is because they will never be Happily Married; additionally, this is followed by a short rant about how the best future for the Quincies is to Marry for Love instead of blood purity or status. While it's clear that Masaki is unhappy with the situation, the twist is that the desire to marry for love is not her confession, it's _Ryuuken's_, and Kanae says he's very kind for thinking that way. The arranged marriage eventually falls through, and both Masaki and Ryuuken get to Marry for Love - to Isshin and Kanae respectively.
    -   In the Amagai filler arc, Lurichiyo, the heir to the Kasumioji clan, is set to mary Shun, who actually looks forward to being married to her. One of her friends has a similar arrangement, which she is not very happy about, and arranges to meet Lurichiyo and her other friends one last time before she's married.
-   In _Blue Ramun_, protagonist Jessie's betrothal to her clanmate Yuan was organized by their tribe when they were still quite young. It's not a binding contract (as Jessie would be free to marry any other member of their tribe if she liked) but it's considered a good match as they're close in age (15 and 17) and they've been friends for years. Yuan recognizes that Jessie's feelings for Guard Captain Eagle threaten their arranged marriage, so he pressures her not to become too involved with Eagle — ostensibly so that they can maintain the purity of their tribe's bloodline (because marriage outside the tribe is forbidden), but also because he genuinely likes Jessie.
-   _Bokura no Kiseki_: Princess Veronica and Prince Eugene are set up in a political marriage to help cement an alliance between their respective countries of Zerestria and Moswick. Though this doesn't stop Moswick from invading and killing everyone in Veronica's castle shortly afterwards.
-   _Boys over Flowers_: The main antagonist, Domyoji Kaede, arranges for both of her children to marry the children of wealthy entrepreneurs in order to acquire their companies for the family's vast corporate empire. When her children Tsubaki and Tsukasa prove to be unwilling, she resorts to less than ethical means to browbeat them into it with mixed success.
-   _A Bride's Story_: The story takes place in nineteenth century Central Asia, so most couples have at least an element of this; the extent is partially determined by the couple’s fathers. Amir and Karluk are a more typical example, as are the two by the Aral Sea, while others show a bit more input from the prospective match. Some story arcs actually revolve around how even those _marrying for love_ need to get their respective families to arrange the marriage. That said, usually, both parties try to love their spouses (else they’ll be miserable for the next few decades), so falling for one’s betrothed or spouse is at least hoped for. That said, this is _not_ the case for every couple, but very nearly.
-   _Bubblegum Crisis_. Lenna's parents arrange for her to meet a prospective suitor, and she is surprised to find that she actually likes him. But she decides to return to Tokyo to rejoin the Knight Sabers anyway.
-   _Case Closed_:
    -   _Almost_ happens when Sato's mother arranges an _omiai_ date between her and Shiratori. Bad thing, Sato _does_ have a guy she likes (Takagi) but he's caught up in a very weird case. Then, she tells Shiratori that if Takagi doesn't come by sunset, she WILL marry him instead. Takagi manages to get baaaaaarely in time so the arrangement falls through, some time later he and Sato get properly together... and so do Shiratori and his True Love, Kobayashi-sensei.
    -   Similarly, Kogoro and his doctor Yoshiaki Araide consider an arranged marriage between Kogoro's daughter Ran and Yoshiaki's _very_ hot son Tomoaki. Conan isn't pleased _at all_. It doesn't go through... because Yoshiaki is _killed_. After the murder case is resolved, Ran and Tomoaki prefer to just stay as friends.
    -   The upcoming marriage of Kaede Katagiri and Kikuhito Morizono turns out to be this, and the one who arranged it was the Morizono clan's family butler, Akio Shigematsu. Problem is... Kaede was in love with Shigematsu's adopted son and fellow butler, Yuji Sakuraba, and they had to break up but still liked each other. Seeing this, Shigematsu changed his mind and tried to convince Kikuhito to cancel the wedding - but Kikuhito, thinking that the butler would blackmail him (since he knew that he was messing around with the family company) _and_ that Sakuraba was trying to steal Kaede away, killed Shigematsu and tried to frame his rival in love.
    -   This trope is vital to the resolution of the " White Sandy Beach Murder Case". The Dr. Jerk Tanaka was offered a _very_ good arranged marriage to his boss' daughter, so he killed his beautiful ex-girlfriend Mitsuko Sekine so she wouldn't get in between and then made it look like she had been Spurned into Suicide after learning that he'd get married. Bad thing, Mitsuko's best friend Tomoko _immediately_ suspected him, and since Conan and the Mouris were there she told Kogoro to investigate. Conan rather easily found out the truth and, through Kogoro, he unmasked Tanaka as the killer.
-   _Cheeky Angel_: The heroes discover one of their group is entangled in an Arranged Marriage from which they must extricate her via a Zany Scheme.
-   _Citrus_: Student Council President Mei Aihara was initially engaged with a homeroom teacher named Amemiya, set up by her grandfather (and the Aihara Academy's chairman); however, this was called off when the main character and Mei's step-sister (and eventual love interest) Yuzu Aihara discovered and reported that Amemiya was marrying Mei for the status and money; he already had a girlfriend. Eventually, it is revealed that arranged marriages are common practice for wealthier families to maintain financial stability; Himeko Momokino and Suzuran Shiraho say this is the case for them. Mei is then put into another arranged marriage, this time with Udagawa, Yuzu's manager at her job. This, too, is called off and Mei ultimately marries Yuzu.
-   Attempted multiple times in _City Hunter_, as the police superintendent, unable to have a male child and heir, obsessively tries to arrange one for his eldest daughter Saeko... Who, not be thrilled by the idea and refusing to marry a man weaker than herself, beats up the suitors until they need to be hospitalized under the guise of a strength test. Then one day, to her horror, a suitor _passed the test_...
-   _Claudine_: Instead of marrying for love, Claude's parents' marriage was arranged.
-   _Code Geass_ has a few of these, as one would expect from a series with so many royals:
    -   Cool Big Sis Milly Ashford is engaged by her family to Earl Lloyd Asplund. She manages to sneak her way out of it. Lloyd doesn't mind. Well, not too much. He was just in it for the cool mecha, anyway - Milly's family owns the first true Knightmare Frame, Ganymede.
        -   Before Lloyd, the Ashfords tried to set Milly up with various nobles in the hope of restoring their status. According to official info, she screws up the dates by acting overly goofy and exuberant and getting the men sick on roller coasters. The novels (authorized but not written by an official writer) say that she simply kicks them in the junk instead.
    -   First Prince Odysseus and the figurehead Empress of China are arranged to get married by Britannian Prime Minister Schneizel and the Chinese Eunuchs. And the Black Knights use this to stage a Gambit Roulette.
        -   After saving the Chinese Empress, Diethard floats the idea of arranging a political marriage between her and one of the Black Knights, which Lelouch mentally admits is not a bad idea; before Lelouch can get a word in edgewise, **all** of the Black Knights' higher-up female members (except Kallen, who is absent) shoot it down and call Diethard an idiot.
    -   In the pre-series Picture Dramas, Suzaku's father and Japanese Prime Minister Genbu Kururugi attempts to force Nunnally to marry him so that Britannia would think twice about the possibility of invading. Suzaku attempts to change it to himself, because he was disturbed by his 50+ year old father marrying an 8 year old crippled blind girl - but apparently Suzaku, too, had his own arranged marriage, and the Sumeragi clan wouldn't approve Lelouch and Kaguya. When Lelouch finds out, he convinces Genbu and Kirihara, a pair of much older, highly intelligent and vastly more experienced men to let the matter go... _completely off screen_. Damn. (Word of God says he bought them off with information about Britannia's new super-weapon, the Knightmare Frame; still something that would have been cool to see, though.)
        -   In the _Nightmare of Nunnally_, manga, Nunnally is set to marry Suzaku so that Genbu can become related to the royal family and have a place in the post-war administration of Japan.

-   _Doki Doki School Hours_: In the last episode, Mika-sensei attends an _omiai_, which leads her students to fear losing her. Without much reason, though.
-   What kick starts the plot in _Engaged to the Unidentified_, where on her sixteenth birthday Kobeni suddenly finds out that apparently her long-departed grandfather set her up with the grandson of one of his old friends from the countryside... And said surprise fiancé suddenly moves into her family's house in the city, with his bratty younger sister in tow as a "chaperone".
-   In _Fairy Tail_, this turns out to be the indirect cause of the events in the Phantom Lord arc, as Lucy's father Jude hired Phantom to bring her back home just so he could have her participate in one of these for his business opportunities. However, Lucy did come back... for entirely different reasons.
-   The plot of _Flower Flower_ revolves around a princess arriving in a country to be arranged to a prince only to reject him as he's a Wholesome Crossdresser. She chooses his younger sibling instead, unaware that she's marrying another woman.
-   _Full Moon_:
    -   Mitsuki's rival Madoka Wakamatsu fled an arranged marriage and got plastic surgery in order to pursue her dreams of being a singer. The guy was Nachi; he got plastic surgery and started a singing career just to be closer to Madoka.
    -   There's also Mitsuki's grandmother Fuzuki, who was betrothed to a very rich man named Kimiharu as a teenager. She and her best friend Moe both ended up falling for a violinist named Seijuurou, but Seijuurou only returned Fuzuki's feelings. He asked Fuzuki's parents for her hand, and Kimiharu was then passed off to Moe by Moe and Kimiharu's families, which were already bound by businesses. Needless to say, the whole thing ended very badly: Moe mistakenly believed that Fuzuki and Seijuurou had betrayed her (they didn't; Fuzuki was about to _reject_ the engagement to Seijuurou because she didn't want to betray Moe, and the kiss they shared was a Last Kiss), fell into despair, barely managed to fend off an Attempted Rape from Kimiharu and then went the Spurned into Suicide way, which led her to become Yui Meroko. Fuzuki was so heartbroken that she called off the marriage to Seijuurou, cut all ties to him, and became comepletely embittered towards music as a whole.
-   In _Fun Territory Defense By The Optimistic Lord_, there are several directed at the protagonist Van Nei Fertio, who is 8-years-old and thus has a few years to get to know his "suitors" before he has to walk down the aisle. The first is a merfolk girl he meets whose tribe then moves into his territory. She describes herself as his fiancé and the chieftan, who is her father, makes it official, no matter how Van says "no." As a result of Van wiping out a legion of "armored dragon" beasts that the clan was fleeing from. The second to date is the "useless" daughter of a neighboring noble who fears an armed invasion, since Van's father is a famous Warhawk, and Van turned the village he was given into a viable fortress. The girl in quesion is actually a very shy and awkward 10-year-old who just wants somebody to acknowledge her existence. When Van _actually praises_ her \[Puppetry\] magic talent, there is much in the way of Ship Tease and she's _ecstatic_, quickly getting on board with hoping she and he marry in the future when they're both of age.
-   _Futari Ecchi_: Main characters Makoto Onoda and Yura Kawada (later, Onoda) meet in an _omiai_. They actually like each other so much that they end up Happily Married, and the manga follows them in their daily life and principally in their attempts to improve their sex life.
-   _GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class_: Apparently, the parents of Miyabi "Professor" Oomichi already arranged her a husband—despite she's only a tenth grader. A later chapter showed that she was not particularly pleased with that, and was glad that the _omiai_ was delayed.
-   Yomi and Noriyuki in _Ga-Rei -Zero-_. Unfortunately, Noriyuki's father breaks off the engagement when Yomi's life starts to go downhill.

After she gets better, Ayaka starts dating Hiroshi Nakano, Shuichi's male Unlucky Childhood Friend.
-   _Gundam_

At the same time, Flay Alster was engaged to Kira's friend Sai Argyle, and she breaks off said engagement after her father dies to pursue Kira. The PLANTS are also known to be enforcing arranged marriages among their population, in an attempt to counter their falling birthrates. It doesn't seem to be helping.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_: We get to see Cagalli's fiancé from childhood, Yuna Roma Seiran. It doesn't work well for him.
    -   In _Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury_ features a more _unique_ example. Due to the rules setup in the school, whoever is the number one duelist is officially the fiancé of Miorine, and it doesn’t matter what the person’s gender is. In the first episode, Guel is the Holder, but following his defeat in the first episode and subsequent defeat in the rematch in the third episode, the protagonist, Suletta Mercury, is officially declared the Holder and Miorine’s fiancé. In this case, Suletta had no idea that she would become Miorine’s fiancé. She only fought against Guel because she wanted him to apologize to Miorine for his abusive treatment towards her.
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_: Wufei was involved in one of these with a girl from his colony named Meiran (who called herself "Nataku").

-   _Haikara-san ga Tooru_: Benio and Shinobu were engaged since birth to compensate for a love match that was annulled many years ago.

When Akira confronts his father about trying to arrange a marriage for him his father replies that he knows better than to try to interfere with his life and that the candidates were actually arranged for Kazuki, not Akira.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_ has both an arranged marriage and a omiai set up:
    -   Nagi and Wataru are arranged to be married, presumably for the Sanzenin fortune. While Nagi and Wataru are antagonistic to the idea, both are 13, and show signs that there are the beginnings of love between them, hinting that they might not be entirely opposed.
        -   Since Nagi no longer will be the inheritor of the Sanzenin fortune, whether it still stands at all hasn't been touched on.
    -   Saki and Kaoru are set up on a omiai by their families. Both admit to being interested in other people, so nothing comes of this.
-   _Hello! Sandybell_: Marc Wellington is forced by his father to enter an engagement with the bitchy, unlikable Kitty Shearer, because the Wellingtons, despite their Blue Blood, are entering poverty and he wants to save face. While Kitty genuinely loves him, he only has eyes for Sandybell. Later, Marc ends their engagement and runs away from her.

This being a yaoi title, the unhappy bride throws the groom out of their cabin on their wedding night, and the groom promptly goes off and gets shagged by a hot Italian seme.
-   _Isabelle of Paris_: For two years, Victor has been engaged to Geneviève. It is implied the marriage is for political purposes, since it was arranged by the latter's father, a wealthy landowner, to Victor, an army captain. However Geneviève only has eyes for her piano teacher Jules, and her parents won't let them get married because Jules is from a poor background.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_: Discussed in Chapter 142 when Shirogane misinterprets Kaguya asking him to hold her hand as he walks her home as her saying that her family is forcing her into an arranged marriage due to a combination of him having not gotten a good night's sleep for the past several days and her sending him a bunch of mixed signals. In a subtle case of foreshadowing, that chapter also happens to feature the first onscreen appearance of Mikado Shijo, who she very nearly does end up forcibly engaged to near the end of the series.
-   _Kaitou Saint Tail_: Sayaka is trapped in an unhappy engagement that centers around a veil belonging to the other family; if Saint Tail steals it and returns it to Sayaka's fiancé, she'll be free to go.

-   _Koi Kaze_: Koshiro works at a marriage-arranging company and setting up omiais is part of his job.

    -   Then she messes things up again in _Encore 2_ by trying to convince Mylene and Basara to marry while at the same time she sets up another _omiai_ between Gamlin and Miho Miho, one of the Bridge Bunnies. Of course it's justified that she thought she was dying at the time.

-   _Maison Ikkoku_: Shun Mitaka is introduced to his eventual wife Asuna Kujou by way of an _omiai_ arranged by his uncle.

After accidentally proposing to her due to a misunderstanding, he warms up to the idea a bit more.
-   In _Maya's Funeral Procession_, Reina is arranged to marry Taku, but is reluctant to do so, both because she only sees him as a brother, and because she falls in love with Maya.

Naturally, she intends never to graduate, and an attempt by her father to push matters leads to him and the fiancé exposed to point-blank Surstr?ng.
-   In the worldbuilding of _My Hero Academia_, it's established that once Quirks became seen as desirable rather than feared, it led to a resurgence in the practice of arranged marriages, as ambitious families attempted to create desirable Quirks in their descendants, even leading to the term "Quirk Marriages". Amongst the hero trainees of UA Classroom 1-A, Shoto Todoroki is known to be the product of a Quirk Marriage, his flame-wielding Pro Hero hero father having deliberately bought the hand of an ice-wielding woman from her family in hopes that they would have a child able to wield both elements in some fashion.

-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Konoka Konoe is usually in an Arranged Marriage of some kind, set up by her grandfather. This causes her great annoyance since most of the suitors she's set up with tend to be somewhere around _twice her age or older_. She generally either turns them all down without a look or runs away and hides till they're over. Later events imply that another problem with the above-mentioned suitors may have been _their gender_.
    -   When Negi Pactios with Ku Fei, she states that he is now "committed to become her groom." She's pulling his leg, though. Chamo comments that FeiNegi is possible, given what his descendant Chao looked like.
-   _Ojamajo Doremi_: Aiko's divorced father goes to an _omiai_ with the daughter of his boss, the sweet Midori, much to Aiko's distress since she still hopes to get her parents reunited.

    -   In the Zou arc, an arranged marriage is revealed to be set up between Sanji, the third son of the Vinsmoke Family and Pudding, the 35th daughter of the Charlotte Family. The reason for this is because Charlotte Linlin, a.k.a. Big Mom, wants to have the power of Germa 66, which is led by the Vinsmoke Family. Vinsmoke Judge doesn't want to give any of his precious children to her, but since defying Big Mom is way too risky, he wants to give her the son he never saw as a son. Although it ultimately turns out that it was all a ploy to get the entire Vinsmoke family together in one place unarmed, so her family could assassinate them all in one flew swoop, giving Big Mom control over the entirety of their Germa 66.

    -   An earlier arc also features two students in an arranged marriage to seal a business alliance between their families. It's clear that they love each other, but he thinks he's too dull for her and wants to study abroad so he can become more worldly, and she's hurt because he made the decision without consulting her. The Host Club can't help but make sure the misunderstandings get cleared up... using the most convoluted means as possible.
-   In _Pumpkin Scissors_, Alice is engaged to be married to a high-ranking noble named Lionel Taylor. However, this went against her wishes to stay unmarried and continue working for Section III. She was even willing once to go as far as to try and get her fiancé to call off their engagement.

-   _Ranma ½_: The _entire plot_ revolves around the chaos created by two former training partners determined to force their children to wed, despite the vehement protests of the children in question (and, in the eyes of some readers, despite the ridiculously dysfunctional relationship between said children). Adding even _more_ chaos to the mix is the fact that the son, through no intention of his own, has gathered an Unwanted Harem consisting of a Bifauxnen Unlucky Childhood Friend who is also engaged to him (he made a promise to take care of her always as kids, though he didn't remember that, and shortly afterwards his father agreed to engage him to her — and then stole her dowry and Ranma both and ran off, leaving her behind), an Accidental Marriage to an Anime Chinese Girl with large breasts, and a Stalker with a Crush who is enacting her own warped version of a Rescue Romance (he saved her from a fall, having accidentally knocked her off the roof in the first place, so she's decided he's her destined lover). Then there's the guy who's in love with his female form (and who also happens to be the strange girl's brother).

    -   Then there's Oscar's case: when her father realizes that The French Revolution is coming and, due having raised her as a man and a soldier, she would be leading the charge, he tries to stop that by getting her married. Being ultimately a good man, he first chooses Girodelle (that he knows is a good person and has a personality compatible with Oscar) and then agrees to let her Oscar choose among her suitors at a dance. Oscar being _very_ stubborn and popular with women, she acts as a man at the dance and flirts with the female guests (who don't mind at all), and then has her soldiers run everyone out with their terrible table manners, and Girodelle, who, differently from the other suitors, had _not_ ran away (and in fact got a good laugh out of it) realizes she would never be happy with him and renounces.

-   _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_: Nozomu has been arranged to have an _omiai_ but it's a pun; instead of an arranged marriage, it is a an 'eye-to-eye marriage' where he is betrothed to the first person he makes eye contact with.

-   In _The Secret Agreement_, Iori is the heir to an Impoverished Patrician family and has to marry into wealth. He doesn't see his marriage as an obstacle to his relationship with his lover, Yuuichi, simply because it's always been a fact of life and he doesn't feel he has to love his wife.
-   _Star Driver_:
    -   Wako and Sugata are supposed to marry on the basis of Wako being a Maiden and Sugata having inherited Samekh's mark, of the most powerful Cybody on the planet. This is why main character Takuto tries his best to not interfer in their relationship despite having fallen in Love at First Sight with Wako. It's made even more complicated when Wako develops feelings for him too, but her old, existing feelings for Sugata stay as well. By the end and through Word of God, it's implied the three of them stay together as they are.
    -   In the past, Ryousuke and Sora (Takuto's mother) were this too. However, whereas Sugata and Wako appear to be in a Perfectly Arranged Marriage, Ryousuke acts very distant towards Sora. Then Head (Takuto's father) arrives and the whole thing goes down the drain.
-   _Stepping on Roses_ (_Hadashi de Bara wo Fume_): Featured between Nozomu and Miu, which is likely a source of their dysfunction. Since protagonist Sumi and male lead Soichiro both marry for money, however, they're not that much better off to start with.

Prince Marse is surprisingly okay with this and gives Sato all the help he needs.
    -   Turns out that the reason Prince Marse wanted to become Ring King in the first place is because he was in love with Saphira, one of the princesses promised to the Ring King. They thought that if he became Ring King, they could be together. Saphira was initially pissed that Marse broke their promise, but Saphira's sister Saphir stole the ring and married Sato before anyone knew what was happening, leaving Saphira free to have a normal relationship with Marse.
-   Less prominent, but the OAV _Tenchi Muyo!_ storyline features Aeka betrothed to her half-brother Yosho; she's happy with the idea... until she falls into Tenchi's Unwanted Harem, of course. She does imply that she wouldn't necessarily mind if Yosho _did_ ask her out, however.
-   Narrowly averted in episode 19 of _Twin Princess of Wonder Planet_ when the _Evil Chancellor_ arranged a marriage between Princess Mirlo and the very young son of a rich man. When the father learned the reason was entirely due to the Water Drop Kingdom being broke, the father called it off.

She decides to sabotage it by getting Nike to crossdress and pose as her fiancé.

-   _Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld_: Prince Topaz initially has a politically-driven betrothal with Lady Sapphire, but backs out at the last minute.
-   One _Captain Marvel_ issue (Carol Danvers, the former _Ms. Marvel_) involved an alien society where women had the right to marry whomever they pleased, but men could be married off at will by their families, whether they liked it or not. A friend of Carol's had inadvertently gotten engaged to a prince, and while she had the ability to back out, the prince told Carol that he couldn't ascend the throne without getting married and that making men able to marry freely would be one of his first official acts as a ruler. He asks _her_ to marry him, but she already has a boyfriend, so she refuses. Ironically, she ends up essentially fighting a duel against another woman for his hand (she enters the duel to protect her friend). She wins, and now that she is essentially engaged to the prince, she uses her new authority to give him the right to marry whomever he wants and recommends that all men be allowed to do the same.
-   _Convergence_: The _Supergirl: Matrix_ tie-in establishes that Lord Volt and Lady Quark aren't happy together because they were forced to marry each other by their parents (and it's also implied that they're gay). This is contradictory towards how _Crisis on Infinite Earths_ consistently depicted Lady Quark as genuinely loving her husband and being upset about his death when she became her world's sole survivor after it was wiped out by the Anti-Monitor.
-   During Maxima of Almerac's time with _Extreme Justice_ it was revealed that part of the reason she'd been obsessed with finding a mate, preferably Superman, was that if she didn't, royal protocol dictated she'd have to mary a fellow Almaracian named Ultraa, whom she despised. The same applies to the _Post-Flashpoint_ version of Maxima, who is even less interested in marrying Ultraa.
-   _Hound_: King Connor tasks Cú Cullan to escort Emer to marry him. Neither the king nor Emer has seen each other and the bride-to-be is unhappy that she is promised to a man older than her own father, and not by her will.

-   _Relative Heroes_: Allure's hand in marriage on her 17th birthday was promised to the son of Posidon when she was still an infant by her mother in exchange for Allure having supernatural beauty and essentially being a Living Aphrodisiac, though she did at least get a Compelling Voice out of the nightmarish deal. She's able to finagle her way out of the engagement by finding a loophole in the wording.
-   _Runaways_:
    -   Karolina and Xavin are brought together by one of these. This might've been tricky to do as Karolina is a lesbian... but Xavin is a shapeshifting Skrull and can get around this problem.
    -   A darker example from the same series was Klara Prast and her husband. Poor Klara was sold off to her husband at a young age because her parents found out she was a mutant. Mr. Prast beat her, sent her off to do dangerous work to earn money to buy booze, and then demanded that she perform... marital duties. Thankfully, she decided to leave him when the Runaways offered to take her back to the present, though, ironically, she almost declined because of her fear of the above-mentioned happy couple.

-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_, Princess Sally's parents were the result of an Arranged Marriage, but they're happy together. Sally's father, on the other hand, tried to set up an arranged marriage between Sally and her fellow Freedom Fighter Antoine D'Coolette.

-   Starfire (Princess Koriand'r) of DC Comics has twice been married to men from her home planet and both times she went through with the marriages to satisfy family and political obligations. The first time this happened, Starfire was romantically involved with Robin (Dick Grayson) and she didn't understand why Grayson was so upset. She said that in her culture, marriage was merely a social obligation; she did not believe that her marriage to another man should interfere with her romantic relationship with Grayson.
-   _Superman_: In the Post-Flashpoint Krypton parents often choose their children's spouses via gene-matching, although this custom was being phased out by the time of Kal and Kara. A Supergirl story showed Alura wanting to get her daughter gene-matched, and Kara complaining she wanted to choose her partner freely.
-   In the shortlived Furry series, _Tales of the Fennick_, the series began with a prologue story with a mother telling her story to her children about how as a girl she was being maneuvered for an arranged marriage by her parents who were losing patience with her continually and defiantly exercising her lawful right to refuse the beaus they are offering. Several suitors later, she found her last beau is actually no more enthusiastic at their meeting than herself. However, a combination of the boy showing that he is a genuinely kind and charming fellow and the chance meetings with gossipy friends who assume they are engaged puts them in an awkward position as they are both growing to like each other. In response, make a secret pact to stall any wedding plans by pretending to have a _long_ engagement so their friends and family will leave them alone. As it is, the mother admits to her daughter that this was simply a mutual rationalization to allow them both to submit to social expectations while feeling that they have some free choice in the matter since they married in the long run. At this, the young daughter playfully declares she is not going to marry, but become a soldier like her father. The mother humors her about this in the prologue story, but in the series proper, the mother is shocked to learn that her now-adult daughter is now an even more strong-willed, if more quietly defiant, girl than herself who is still serious about following through on that intention and imitating her mother's self-deceptions is _not_ going to be enough for her.

Some fans tend to believe that the higher class Hobbit families (mainly Brandybuck and Took) marry through arrangements, which is a good way of adding fanfic drama. This belief seems to come from the fact that Merry is an only child, Pippin has three older sisters and no brothers, and only one child of his own (a son), which could suggest that the parents simply get separate bedrooms once an heir has been born. There is, however, no indication in Tolkien's work that this is actually the case.
-   In _A Most Sensible Idea_, Frodo is entered into an arranged marriage with Thorin in order to open up new trade routes with the Misty Mountain. At the end he doesn't go through with it - Bilbo, who has been chaperoning him, falls in love with Thorin and marries the dwarf himself.

_Miraculous Ladybug_

-   The main conflict of _Wed Locked_ is Marinette being forced into a marriage by her maternal family.

_My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_

-   An arranged marriage happens in _Arranged Disaster_, although, after thinking it over, Twilight is willing to go through with it because she understands the importance of leadership:
    
    “Oh! I get it!” She smiled suddenly, and Celestia stared nervously.  
    “You do?” That wasn’t the reaction she’d been expecting.  
    “Of course! The parents put their brightest, most talented children together to keep their businesses strong and respect the honor of their families, as well as guide the non-nobles around them to a better future!” Twilight bobbed her head.  
    Celestia stared down at her for a good while, working her jaw. Shoot. Luna was so much better at not getting embarrassed about this. “Y-yes, of course Twilight, that’s exactly it.” Celestia nodded. She would find a… better way to explain this. “The Bluebloods will be expecting you to lead those around you to a better future.” ‘And have lots and lots of super-powered babies.’ Celestia groaned at the thought.  
    “Don’t worry Princess.” Twilight looked down at the street again, at the many citizens of Canterlot. “I promise I won’t let you down. Even… even if I don’t like this, I will fulfill my duties as a noble, and create a stronger next generation! Even if I have to dirty my own front hooves to do it!”  
    Celestia hid a laugh with a tiny snort, and bobbed her head. “O-of course Twilight! You will be an excellent leader.”  
    “And I will fulfill my duties no matter what. Even if it’s with Blueblood or any other pony.” Celestia did her very best to not grin. “I won’t take it lying down. I will be up on all four of my hooves fulfilling my duties, and not just in some fancy house! Blueblood and I shall strengthen the generation no matter where we are, in the castle, out on the streets, in the clouds- Princess?”  
    Celestia had suddenly collapsed, shaking with laughter.
    
-   Nav gets forced into one with Gilda in _Diaries of a Madman_, due to him causing a political scandal. Eventually, he finds a way out of it.
-   _Harmony Theory_: The griffons and changelings have eugenics programs. The Solar King also has the power to arrange this. He uses this power to betroth Star Fall to his son.
-   _Maternal Instinct_: Queen Chrysalis' daughter, Crown Princess Pupa, is arranged to be married to her first cousin, Prince Morphin. It is evidently a common practice in Changeling society, as well as marriage within the family, although the latter is particularly attributed to the royal family and other nobility.
-   _The Mixed-Up Life of Brad_: Marriages like this are rather common among pony nobility. Thanks to the talents of Princess Cadence, who can make ponies fall in (or out of) love as needed, they are happier than human arranged marriages.
-   _The MLP Loops_:
    -   Were a thing in 177.21. Applejack was with someone she thought might have been a pony version of Thorin Oakenshield (but didn't know whether he was Awake or not), Fluttershy was with Caramel, Rainbow Dash with her old bully Hoops, Octavia with Prince Blueblood, and Twilight was with Flash Sentry.
    -   In Loop 202.12, Filthy Rich's marriage to Spoiled Milk was an arranged one, but Filthy wound up having a one-night stand with Applejack, whom he admitted was the one he really wanted to marry, after being told. She got pregnant, and Diamond Tiara - who was subsequently raised by Filthy and Spoiled, though with the promise that if she found out about her birth mom and wanted to rejoin her, she could - was the result.
-   Yet another example involving Prince Blueblood happens in _This Platinum Crown_, due to Princess Celestia promising to reunite the Terre Rare and Blueblood family lines. As a result, Blueblood becomes engaged to Lady Antimony. This being the sequel to _The Best Night Ever_, he and Rarity have become an item after his Character Development in that fic, so she's understandably distraught upon finding out, and Antimony tries to soften the blow by saying she'd make a fine first mistress for the prince in question. Ultimately, since Antimony wanted to marry Blueblood for the sole purpose of gaining political power, it's Rarity who wins out in the end, due to her own desired marriage with him being one of genuine love.
-   RealityCheck's Nyxverse:
    
    -   Attempted in _Alicornundrum_, wherein Prince Blueblood's father gets Night Light, the father of Twilight Sparkle (who recently became an alicorn and was coronated as a Princess a few chapters earlier), drunk enough to sign a marriage contract between Twilight and Blueblood (in an attempt to sire a new unicorn heir to the throne) without Night Light realizing it until the next day. Twilight and her parents, of course, are understandably outraged over this, and Twilight convinces Lord Blueblood to sign an annulment immediately afterward. Upon reviewing the marriage contract, Celestia declares it invalid, only for Lord Blueblood to attempt to take it to court... which enrages Celestia so much that she immediately proceeds to verbally lay it onto him as to just how illegal the contract is, including such charges as statutory rape, pony trafficking, blackmail, and treason - to say nothing of the fact that _Celestia herself_ imposed all of the laws against the above charges, thereby preventing such contracts from being implemented legally. Understandably, the terrified Lord Blueblood immediately accepts the annulment. (Word of God was that this scene was intended as a rebuttal to another fanfic involving Twilight being married off to Blueblood, which the author hated due to everypony from Celestia to Twilight carrying a massive Idiot Ball throughout the entire story.)
    
    -   A later chapter reveals that the above incident was neither Celestia's nor Duke Blueblood's first rodeo as far as this trope was concerned. While being roped into his father's latest scheme, Prince Blueblood recalls a time when, to make an example of one of his cousins, his father convinced the mare's father, successfully, to marry her off to a wealthy but abusive stallion. In response, Celestia arranged for a fatal "accident" to befall the new groom during their honeymoon, allowing said cousin to inherit his estate. The mare in question is heavily implied to be A.K. Yearling, a.k.a. Daring Do.
-   Zig-Zagged in _What Hath Joined Together_. Since marriage options depend on your social class, one can either marry a few ponies or not marry at all, and as an alicorn, Twilight Sparkle only has the high-ranking unicorn Captain Ironhoof as a legitimate suitor. After being narrowed down, regular dating occurs, and ponies like Princess Cadance play matchmaker to help those relationships go smoothly (though, Cadance doesn't exactly like the idea, even though she was fortunate enough to get a husband she adored).

_Naruto_

-   _A Growing Affection_:
    -   Even though it is frowned upon and cannot be enforced in the Leaf Village, Hinata's grandfather seems to enjoy doing this. Hyouta arranges a groom for Hinata and hand-picked Hiashi's second wife.
    -   Nyoko tries (and fails) to arrange her own marriage to Naruto, knowing her father will accept it and afraid she will get forced into a bad arrangement otherwise.
-   In _War of the Biju_, Fugaku Uchiha intended to arrange one between his youngest son Sasuke and the Hyuuga Clan's heiress, Hinata — most likely to ensure the Hyuuga Clan's loyalty under the new regime should Uchiha Clan's coup succeed. He died before anything came of it.

_One Piece_

-   In _One Piece: Parallel Works_, Aki is in an arranged marriage, which fuels the events of the Noblesse Oblige Saga.
-   In _This Bites!_, to deal with the influx of strong pirates in their shared territory, the Accino family arrange a marriage between their youngest daughter Lil and the same-age Buratto of the Hiruno family, a far more ruthless and sadistic group of bounty hunters. It's clear that none of the Accino family are happy about it, with Don Accino only accepting it as a means of protecting his family, his children (sans Lil) asking the Straw Hats to sabotage the wedding while helping to set it up to get their flag back, and Lil admitting to Robin that while she likes Buratto as a childhood friend she can't bare her family working with their sadistic counterparts. Thankfully, a third choice is brought to the Accinos by Vivi: disregard the wedding and join Alabasta as one of its guardians, defending the coast from both pirates and marines.

_Persona 4_

-   In _One Year_, Hitomi, one of Yu's old friends, is engaged to a somewhat older man, and will marry after she graduates from high school. Hitomi's fairly conflicted about this, since she knows that since her grades are mediocre at best, her job prospects aren't much better, but she also knows that she'll have little freedom and will most likely be strongly discouraged from seeing her friends again. As for the man himself, Hitomi knows that he is a kind person at heart, but also that he's subservient to his family like she is to hers, and as such, does not love or fully trust him.

_Pokémon_

-   In a sidestory of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, the elders of the Blackthorn Dragon Clan attempt to pressure Clair into one, on the grounds that they need to secure an heir for the future of the clan. Some of the candidates include fellow Gym Leaders Falkner and Morty, as well as a couple of Drayden's grandsons, but they all fall through due to various reasons.
-   According to the artist of _Rebuild of Pocket Monsters: The Animation_, both Professor Oak and his son were in arranged marriages. However, arranged marriages aren't common in Ash's time.

_RWBY_

-   _Camellias_ (based on a series of fanart) is a _RWBY_ Alternate Universe Fic where Blake and Weiss are in an arranged marriage. Upon meeting at age ten, Weiss has a fit because Blake is a faunus girl, but things go along much smoother when they meet again several years later.
-   In _RWBY: Scars_, Jacques tries to marry off his daughter Weiss to Cardin's father Maximus. Not only is Weiss not into men, but she's also not interested in marrying a man old enough to be her father.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Jacques Schnee tries to arrange a marriage between his daughter Weiss and Jaune. When Jaune points out that he's _already_ getting married, Jacques says that multiple wives are an option, as are mistresses and concubines. Weiss is sitting there the entire time, and not amused. Especially since she's one of the only girls in the story without any romantic interest in him.

_The Smurfs_

-   In _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_, Psyches are bonded to members of the same sex with the Psyche Master choosing the partners. Empath, as it turns out, has been bonded to Polaris Psyche.

_A Song of Ice and Fire_

-   _A Dragon's Roar_:
    -   Jaime is betrothed to Elia Martell, both to forge an alliance between the Westerlands and Dorne, and to spite Aerys for refusing to wed Rhaegar to Cersei (as he wanted Rhaegar to marry Elia instead). The fact that the pair are already interested in each other helps.
    -   Rhaegar tries to arrange a marriage between Daeron and Ashara Dayne, but the Lannisters are ultimately more successful in managing to tie him to Cersei, while Ashara gets married to Ned Stark.
    -   Brandon is arranged to marry Catelyn Tully, but he breaks the betrothal to elope with Barbrey Ryswell, causing trouble with House Tully, while Rickard Stark considers betrothing Lyanna to Edmure Tully. This ultimately doesn't happen, however, as Lyanna instead ends up betrothed to Robert.
    -   To secure the Greyjoys' loyalty to Daeron's faction, an agreement is made to wed Asha to Jaime and Elia's firstborn son.
    -   Daeron arranges for Viserys' betrothal to Arianne Martell.
    -   After the Civil War, Cersei arranges for Tyrion to marry Ellyn Rowan when they're both of age in order to secure Tyrion's control of Goldengrove, which is given to him as a means of punishing the Rowans for siding with Rhaegar.
    -   Also after the war, Catelyn is betrothed to Stannis.
-   Avoiding one is the main motivation for Alys Boleyn's actions in the early story of _Forum of Thrones_. After her father betrothed her to Dante Karstark against her will, she ran away from home, leaving her father and her fiancé to try and follow her.
    -   Alisa Karstark's backstory holds a remarkable similarity, only that she ran away from home to avoid being married to a member of House Forrester.
    -   The marriage between Darren and Mileena Reyne is one of these. At least from her side, it is also a Perfectly Arranged Marriage.
-   Since _A Man of Iron_ is based in Westeros, marriage is more about political gain than love.
    -   As in the source material, Robb ends up engaged to a Frey girl. Contrary to canon, Ned Stark intends to honour the betrothal, only asking to screen Lord Frey's daughters and granddaughters to find the most suitable one for his son. Walder Frey is ecstatic about it.
    -   In the past, Houses Martell and Stark sought to bring their families together via a marital pact, but it didn't go anywhere since Horard Stark's only offspring was male - Antony Stark. When Tony adopts and legitimizes Jon Snow as his heir, Oberyn Martell remembers the pact and presents his eldest daughter as a bride for the teen.
-   _A Northern Dragoness_ revolves about fulfilling the Pact of Ice and Fire, which is giving a royal princess to marry the heir to the North. On Daena's side, this is a Perfectly Arranged Marriage - because she's so desperate to escape her brother's madness she would marry _anyone_. Jonnel has many more reservations about the matter.
-   _Robb Returns_ features a number of arranged marriages that weren't present in canon.
    -   After Domeric and Sansa fall in love, Ned and Roose sit down to discuss a marriage contract.
    -   As in canon, Robert plans to marry Sansa to his eldest son Joffrey. However, he finds out that Sansa is already betrothed to Domeric Bolton. Ned argues that such marriage is key in ensuring House Bolton's loyalty, and cancelling it would cause a huge rift between the Starks and Boltons, and the current situation with the Others demands a unified North. Fortunately, Robert decides to let the issue go without much fuss.
    -   King Robert suggests two other marriages between their respective children: Bran and Myrcella, and Arya and Tommen. Ned doesn't oppose these but warns Robert that for a Kindhearted Cat Lover like Tommen, a tomboy wild girl like Arya might be too much to handle.
-   _Wearing Robert's Crown_: Unsurprisingly, very few of the marriages in the fic are anything but politically arranged. Cersei, in particular, protested hers loudly. Most of them seem to work out though.

_Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_

-   The Fanon has an arrangement called _j'fallen_ in the Trill culture. The Symbiosis Board itself occasionally sets up two Joined Trills for marriage on the justification that their children will be of better stock and more likely to be among the Joined elite of the society. How well it works depends on the author.

_Star Trek Online_

-   Discussed in "To Absent Friends". Vulcans usually do arranged marriages but T'Var's parents thought it more logical to let her seek her own mate.

_Star vs. the Forces of Evil_

-   A few of the _Queens of Mewni_ end up in these, which is natural, since they are princesses living in a dimension where society resembles medieval-to-Victorian times.
    -   Averted with Festivia the Fun. Gold Stone offered to arrange a marriage between his nephew Quartz and Princess Festivia, but her mother refused, not wanting to force her daughter. However, Queen Febe had Quartz accompany young Festivia in hiding in the Silvan Kingdom during the Mud Dweller Rebellion, in the hope that they might fall in love naturally. It worked, but not right away.
    -   After a STD rendered her infertile after the birth of her first and only child Etheria, Queen Asteria took it upon herself to match her daughter with a noble son without any serious issues in his family medical history. She chose Germain Fields. At first, they hated each other, but over time, they developed a sort of friendship, which eventually gave way to affection.
    -   Etheria continued the tradition of arranged marriages by betrothing her daughter Skywynne to Filbric Flowers. Luckily, it was a Perfectly Arranged Marriage, as the two had met beforehand and become instantly smitten without knowing the other’s identity.
    -   Averted again with Skywynne’s daughter, Soupina the Strange. She was betrothed to Persian Waterson, who she actually liked a lot, but he died due to the sickness plaguing Mewni at the time. Soupina was devastated, but eventually found Second Love with friend and commoner Osmond Cross.
    -   Zig-Zagged with her daughters, Galaxia and Pulsaria. They were engaged to two Redbird brothers, Galaxia to the older Heron and Pulsaria to the younger Condor. However, each sister ended up falling for the other’s fiancé, and vice versa. So technically they both had a marriage with a Redbird as intended… just not the ones they were originally promised to.
    -   One day, Queen Meteora the First walked in on her daughter Hekatia to give her supper. It’s never explicitly said what she saw Hekatia doing, but it was drastic enough that Meteora forbid her to choose her own husband and promised her to Edmund Cross. They would end up Platonic Life-Partners.
    -   Eclipsa was given some agency over her arranged marriage, by being given three options and choosing one. She chooses Edric Flowers after he saved her from a Pie Folk assassin (who had also been one of Eclipsa's options, and the one she nearly chose until he tried to kill her), and they would become a Perfectly Arranged Marriage. After the supposed death of her first husband and their only child, Eclipsa was forced to marry Spiderbite Prince Shastacan (who had been the last option) in the hopes of producing a new heir to replace the dead princess. Eclipsa hated Shastacan and mourned her husband and daughter. This is when she met and fell in love with Globgor.
    -   Heaven the Scared was betrothed to Sir Arthur McKnight, partly to further strengthen the recently ennobled House McKnight, but also because Arthur and his father were two of the few people Heaven actually trusted.
    -   Diana tried to betroth her second oldest daughter Etheria to Lancel McKnight, but Lancel's mother would accept no less than the heiress, Sky. This match was also a Perfectly Arranged Marriage to the point that Sky died from Death by Childbirth exacerbated by despair after Lancel died.

_Story of Seasons_

-   _Storm Clouds And Grey Skies_: Leia's grandmother wants her to marry a merman of her choosing because she's worried about Leia's love life. Leia doesn't want to, but she also doesn't want to disrespect her grandmother by declining. Claire convinces her to speak up for herself.

_Sweeney Todd_

-   In fanfiction, Benjamin and Lucy Barker are sometimes said to have had an arranged marriage, which is odd as (a) arranged marriages were nearly kaput by the nineteenth century, (b) it seems unlikely that Lucy's parents would aim no higher than a barber, and (c) the way the man who used to be Benjamin remembers Lucy gives every indication of it having been a love match. The arranged marriage is often used to undermine their marriage in a case of Die for Our Ship.

_Transformers_

Crossovers

-   In the _Kingdom Hearts_/_Game of Thrones_ fanfic _A Songof Ice Fire And Heart_, Robert Baratheon forcibly engages Roxas to his daughter, Myrcella. This is because he believes Roxas to be the son of Ventus, who happened to be one of Robert's best friends before the latter grew angry with him because his rebellion caused the deaths of innocents and ended their friendship. Despite what happened, Robert still saw Ventus as his friend and regrets the day he left, so he wants to make Roxas a prince because Robert believes he'll be making it up to Ventus.
-   In the backstory of _A Strange Engagement_, Stan Pines entered a High Stakes Poker Game involving Bill Cipher, Him, Aku, Danny Phantom, Morrigan, Grim, and Sirzechs Lucifer. During the game, the topic of families came up, which eventually led to all of the drunken players betting marriage contacts involving their respective kids (and in Stan's case, his newly born great-niece and nephew). Stan won the contracts (among other riches), which force Dipper and Mabel in the present to enter a magically bound arranged marriage with several children of the Underworld.

Other

-   Khaos Omega pulls a Heads I Win, Tails You Lose variant in "Fairy's Eclipse":
    -   Before meeting a reporter friend Anise visits Jude to arrange a marriage between her and Lucy. She specifically tells Jude she knows the identity of the woman who impregnated Lucy (it's Anise herself, forced by Inextinguibili Raptus Mark III to do so), and will only reveal it if Jude agrees, otherwise any potential partners Jude comes up with will only see Lucy as "damaged goods" because of her earlier rape. Jude agrees after correctly identifying her as the owner of the multiversal superstore 'Sky Relic Central', allowing him to keep his fortune should his current choice of industry focus suffer a total economic collapse.
    -   Another Lucy-and-Anise example happens during the second installment of the "Rogue Genesis" subset. This time around it's Lucy's punishment for allegedly setting three Celestial Spirits to butcher Bora and his crew. In actuality, though, the Spirits in question (Aquarius and Taurus, which Lucy did have at the time, and Aquarius' boyfriend Scorpio, then contracted with someone else) are actually from another multiverse (specifically that of the subset's first installment, where Erza was convicted for her part in building the Tower of Heaven - she had avoided a Sadistic Choice that made up plans A and B for Sho and Simon to let Rogue Genesis get her, and an accidental murder that would've been plan C was outright negated in a Shout-Out to what allowed Anise to punish Fontina Evans and Michaela Martin at the end of her Los Santos vacation). On top of that, they had arrived on their own, not to mention being far more powerful - the power boosts a corrupt Rogue Genesis court blamed on Virgo, still under contract with Everlue at the time, for which Leo's punishment via the Celestial Spirit King was transferred to her and her contract with Everlue transferred to Anise. To put the final nail in Lucy's proverbial coffin, Jude says four words (which is a Shout-Out to Super RWBY Sisters) that not only enables the Meme Storm tangent named "Fairy Gear" to realize its full multiversal potential, but also evolve Anise's Inextinguibili Raptus Mark III curse into Mark IV. Oh, and part of the situation for Lucy is that she has to wear long, formal dresses at all times (as part of why Virgo got dragged into the mess).
        
        To further the above Shout-Out, when Rogue Genesis caught up to Weiss she too ended up on the receiving end of an arranged marriage to Anise as her punishment. Jacques made sure that Anise couldn't bring Weiss with her when she visits her teammate Natsume's own lesbian harem by invoking a limiter that made Weiss' businesswoman outfit require her Vale bolero in place of the outfit's usual blazer (which also makes Weiss unable to wear the bolero's associated wedge boots, noted to be a heel Anise especially loves with a heel type other than her normally-preferred stilettos, because a businesswoman's normal heels are pumps).
        

    Films — Animated 

-   In _Alpha and Omega_, Kate is to be married to Garth, to prevent war between rival packs. That plan is disrupted when she and her omega friend, Humphrey, are darted and relocated to a distant American park. As the pair struggle to get back to Jasper, Garth inadvertently falls for Kate's omega sister Lily and thus both are in an awkward situation when Kate returns. Even though both confess their true feelings with Lily perfectly willing to substitute for Kate, the packs don't accept this and go to war that sparks a caribou stampede that threatens the pack leaders, but Kate and Humphrey's rescue of them convince them to change their minds.
-   In _The Book of Life_, although there's no official agreement, General Posada is clearly planning to have Maria marry Joaquin. Joaquin genuinely did want to marry Maria, but not if she had to be forced; and they end up not marrying after all.
-   _Brave_:
    -   The firstborn sons of the three lords compete to the Highland Games to win Merida's hand for marriage. Merida does _not_ want to be married right now and wants her freedom so she actively sabotages their chances by entering the archery contest (As she was "the firstborn of a Lord", she was _technically_ perfectly allowed to compete). And at the end of the movie, the three sons reveal _they_ weren't exactly thrilled either at the idea of getting married just yet, only keeping quiet out of loyalty or respect for their fathers.
    -   This is also true for Merida parents who are still in love.
-   _Corpse Bride_'s main character Victor was engaged to Victoria Everglot by their parents, because she's the daughter of a poor nobleman and he's the son of a _nouveau riche_ fishmonger. It's an ideal match in that respect, but they both feel nervous about whether they're going to get along. As it turns out, it's a Perfectly Arranged Marriage and they're attracted from the first meeting. Of course, he then runs out of the wedding rehearsal in a wretched fit of anxiety and accidentally gets engaged to a zombie, but it works out eventually.
-   Disney Animated Canon:
    -   In _Aladdin_, the Sultan desperately tries to get Jasmine to marry. However, he does give her the option of choosing her husband herself and refuses to choose anyone she hates. Later, Jafar enspells him into arranging her marriage to him, without her consent. This doesn't last. He even allows her to marry Aladdin, a commoner.
    -   Made the subject of a brief gag at the start of _The Emperor's New Groove_: Emperor Kuzco is shown a lineup of potential bride-candidates, whom he casually insults and dismisses. After he has turned away, one of the gals can be seen being physically restrained from attacking him.
    -   _Encanto_: Downplayed in that Isabela and Mariano are not presented in a traditional arranged marriage, but Alma strongly favoring Mariano as a potential husband, which puts a lot of pressure on Isabela to agree to the proposal to make the family proud regardless of her own feelings. The film ends with Isabela breaking off the would-be engagement, and both she and Mirabel setting Mariano up with their cousin, Dolores, who does have feelings for him.
    -   In _The Lion King (1994)_, Simba and Nala are betrothed, much to their confusion ("I can't marry her — she's my friend!" "Yeah, it'd be so weird.."). They eventually get their own Falling-in-Love Montage as adults.
    -   _Mulan (Disney)_:
        -   _Mulan_ begins with her trip to a matchmaker in hopeful preparation for an advantageous marriage. Naturally, this ends in disaster, setting Mulan up nicely for The Call which comes a few hours later (and for the love match that eventually results).
        -   In the direct-to-video sequel, _Mulan II_, she and her friends are given an Escort Mission to conduct three princesses to their intendeds. At odds with Western ideals, the girls don't object to their arranged marriages, though they all end up in conventional romances and (presumably) marry for love.
    -   In _Pocahontas_, Kocoum asks for Pocahontas' hand and her father betroths her to him - she has no say in it. It doesn't go through since Kocoum is later shot to death by Thomas.
    -   _Sleeping Beauty_ had an Arranged Marriage between Princess Aurora and Prince Philip from different kingdoms. In contrast to the prevailing modern view of Arranged Marriages as loveless, Aurora falls in love with Philip before she discovers that he's her betrothed husband, making the Arranged Marriage one of true love. The main drama comes from Aurora telling Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather that she's fallen in love with Phillip and Phillip telling his father that he's fallen in love with Aurora. In both cases, however, neither of them know _who_ it is that they've fallen in love with, leaving all adult parties to believe that they've fallen in love with a peasant.
-   _Scooby-Doo in Arabian Nights_: The Prince in the gender-flipped version of Aladdin was supposed to marry the Princess of Serendibe but she disappeared back when she was a little girl. Perfectly Arranged Marriage: Aliyah-Din was revealed in the end to be the Princess of Serendibe.
-   In _Shrek 2_: It's heavily implied that this was the case for Princess Fiona and Prince Charming. But rather than being about politics, it was how the king was going to pay back the Fairy Godmother for turning him into a human so he can marry Lillian, by having Charming marry Fiona and eventually become king of Far Far Away. However, their plans are foiled when Fiona falls in love with Shrek and marries him instead. Harold attempts to break them up (even putting a hit on Shrek) but eventually he changes his mind when he sees how genuine Fiona's feelings are for Shrek and how much she despises Charming, though it costs him greatly.
-   In _The Swan Princess_, Derek and Odette are betrothed as children by their parents and forced to spend every summer together. This leads to a musical montage of them growing up hating each other, until one summer (having grown up), they realize that they've actually fallen in love.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Aquaman (2018)_:
    -   Arthur's mother Atlanna is in an arranged marriage with King Orvax, which was the reason why she escaped to the surface many years ago. She conceived Orm from this relationship, although it's worth noting that she had him after she was forced to go home.

Naturally, when he finds out she slept with Jake Sully, he's not pleased. They do mend fences later, though, and Tsu'tey names Jake his successor as chief before dying, preserving the tradition.
-   _The Bare-footed Kid_ uses this as a plot point. The owner of the Four Seasons Weaver, Madam Pak Siu-kwan, was bethrothed to a boy from a neighbouring rich family when she was still a child, but as luck would have it, the boy she was engaged to died before reaching adulthood. In order to preserve family honour, she is _forced_ to remain single for the rest of her life.

-   The 2004 Czech film, _Želary_, puts an interesting spin on this trope. The main character, Eliska, works for an underground resistance movement in the Nazi-occupied city of Prague, Czechoslovakia. When her conspirators are captured, the resistance sends her to a remote mountain village with a new identity to hide from the Gestapo. To keep her under the radar, she is ordered to marry one of the local farmers to avoid attracting attention. She is understandably pissed off about this arrangement and acts coldly towards her intended. Of course, the man she marries is quiet, kind, and chivalrous, so there's only so many directions that their relationship could go.

-   _All My Children_: An Li's mother wanted to take her back to their native China to force her into one of these. Her friend Brian offered to marry her himself so that she wouldn't have to leave the place she'd known for most of her life to marry a man she'd never met.

-   _Andor_: The planet Chandrila has a tradition of citizens entering arranged marriages as teenagers. Mon Mothma and her husband Perrin Fertha were married off at 16 because of this, and neither one of them is happy about it. Possibly the only thing they agree on is being reluctant to have their daughter go through the same tradition, but Leida is such a traditionalist that she actually wants to do it.
-   _The Arrangement (2017):_ Megan is offered a marriage contract to Hollywood star Kyle right after they first start dating, in "order to protect his brand". How this affects their lives is one of the main themes in the series, and it's also Zig-Zagged in that it's justified due to (In-Universe) Executive Meddling acting as Shipper on Deck; deconstructed in that it's a fairly political marriage, a la _The White Queen_ and Played for Drama as well in that the question is whether Megan will have a Sanity Slippage because of it.
-   _Arrow_: Ra's al Ghul forces his daughter Nyssa and Oliver Queen into one, much to the Nyssa's disdain (Oliver also flinched when it was announced, implying his discomfort). At the end of the next episode, Nyssa attempts to stab Oliver during the wedding. Although later events make it clear that they got the marriage annulled (if it was even valid in the first place), Nyssa occasionally snarks about it, such as greeting Oliver's sister as her sister-in-law.
-   In _Babylon 5_, the Centauri have Arranged Marriages of the forced variety. This results in a culture that believes weddings should be somber affairs with tears and recrimination, while funerals are joyous affairs. To celebrate a wedding is seen as bad luck.
    -   In fact, when Londo's service pleases The Emperor, the latter offers to grant Londo any request. Londo asks for a divorce from his three wives (one of whom hates his guts, one of whom tries to suck up to him, and one of whom is The Vamp). The Emperor agrees, but requests that Londo keep one wife to appear at functions and such. In the end, Londo chooses his first wife, the one who hates him and doesn't hide it. Why? Because he knows exactly where he stands with her, while the other two are manipulative liars. What he doesn't realize is that she's the most faithful of them all, having given her blood for a much-needed transfusion that saved his life on the condition that Dr. Franklin keep her identity secret.
    -   A first season episode had Vir's cousin and his girlfriend running away to escape arranged marriages. Londo wants to send them back to their families but eventually he breaks down and has his family foster them so they can decide who they marry.

-   _Best Friends Whenever_: Daisy was promised in marriage to Sebastian following the deaths of her parents, although she doesn't want to go through with it.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_:
    -   Raj, upset with being the only member of the group still single and feeling increasingly alone (especially with his heterosexual life partner getting married), decided to have his parents select an arranged marriage candidate for him (in the first of two instances). The date goes well, the girl is pretty, charming, has chemistry with him...and is also a lesbian who wanted to use him as her beard (although in a twist she thought he was gay as well and it would be a mutual thing). The poor guy was feeling so lonely he actually considered going through with it, before his friends intervened and bought him a puppy.
        -   In Season 12, Raj again asks his dad to give him an arranged fiancée. But this time, he only agrees to an arranged marriage after he had gotten rid of his selective mutism and thus got to play the field but failed to find true love. And this is still in reaction to his male friends having wives or girlfriends, notably Sheldon getting married and Stuart dating his coworker.
    -   At one point, Raj tells his parents that he wants to marry for love, and his father tells him that only idiots do that—you'll end up unhappy either way; at least if it's arranged you'll end up in a beneficial arrangement. His wife points out that they married for love. Raj's father quickly claims that they're the exception. Also they divorced later on.
-   An episode in the first season of _Blackadder_ spoofed the "royals using marriages to form alliances" phenomenon. In one scene, the king calls his elder son Harry to inform him of a marriage he wants to arrange for him. Harry then pulls out a scroll and recites a long list of the women (and one man) he's _already_ engaged to. This episode also spoofed the young ages at which said marriages took place when, in the end of the episode, Edmund is married to a 9 year old princess. The final episode of the third season involved King George III announcing that he wished his son to marry a rosebush. Not just any rosebush; a specific rosebush.
-   _The Blacklist_ had an episode that dealt with arranged marriages, where the girls are school-age and much too young to be wives and mothers. The Blacklister they're going after is someone who helps the girls by killing their husbands so they can leave.
-   Practically all marriages featured on _The Borgias_ are based on political alliances (this is Truth in Television for the time period, of course), with poor Lucrezia being saddled with a violent rapist, and thirteen-year-old Gioffre having to marry Sancia of Naples - a woman about twice his age, who sees nothing wrong with screwing Gioffre's older brother Juan mere minutes before consummating her marriage with Gioffre himself.
-   In the first episode of _Chinese Paladin_, Xiaoyao is asked to marry and protect Ling'er as the price for the medicine he's after. It is, fortunately, a Perfectly Arranged Marriage.
-   An episode of _Chuck_ includes a sub-plot where Lester (an Indian Jew) is pressured to marry a girl from his hometown. When he tells it to Big Mike, Big Mike assumes this is because he is Indian. However, Lester's parents are from Saskatchewan, Canada. Apparently, their culture is a mix of Canadian, Jewish, and Indian culture, which is shown when Lester sets up a "traditional" den at the Buy More, which is a mix of both cultures, with Lester himself wearing an Indian robe and a fur hat. The girl is also from a Canadian-Jewish-Indian "Hinjew" family, whose parents are pressuring her to marry Lester. She is initially put off by his "traditional" exhibit, but he reveals that he just did this to impress her. She warms to him a little... until he puts her on the spot and sings to her. Embarrassed, she leaves, calling off the wedding.
-   Season 9 of _Degrassi: The Next Generation_ introduced an Arranged Marriage plot for Sav Bhandari.

-   _Downton Abbey_:
    -   When the series began, the eldest daughter Mary Crawley had been engaged for years to her second cousin Patrick Crawley despite it not being a love match (indeed, the middle sister Edith was more into him). This was because her father Robert, the Earl of Grantham, had no sons and Patrick would be his heir as the next male Crawley in line given the practice of Heir Club for Men among the British aristocracy, so the arranged marriage between Mary and Patrick would ensure the title and Downton Abbey stayed with Robert's descendants. This was also meant to appease a sense of fairness, given that the considerable dowry of Mary's mother Cora (an American heiress), which kept Downton Abbey afloat, had been bound up in the estate and if Patrick married someone else, it would essentially mean that Cora's money would go to a stranger instead of her own daughter. Unfortunately, the series opens with the news that Patrick drowned on the _Titanic_.
    -   With Patrick's death, the next male Crawley in line becomes a much more distant cousin, Matthew Crawley, who is merely upper middle-class and works as a lawyer. Several of Mary's relatives suggest that she and Matthew should enter into this arrangement for the same reasons she was engaged to Patrick, but both resist the idea because of their clashing personalities and backgrounds. Eventually they marry each other for love, but only after most of the pressure from people playing matchmaker has eased off.
-   On _Farscape_, John is forced to marry a Sebacean princess because her DNA has been intentionally poisoned and she can't have children with anyone else. Eventually he just leaves her pregnant, frozen as a statue for 80 cycles with the man she loves. It Makes Sense in Context. He fully intended to go through with it to avoid death by Scorpius, though Aeryn is not amused.
-   In one episode of _Father Brown_ Joan is the bookworm daughter of a millionaire, being pushed into an arranged marriage with a handsome but impoverished Upper-Class Twit. At the start the engagement is treated very much like a business, with Robert casually giving Joan his grandmother's engagement ring saying that she can have it resized. As the story goes on we see Robert becoming impressed by Joan's intelligence, and later he is shown to be quite kindhearted. It doesn't hurt that the couple can commiserate about not meeting their parents' expectations. By the end, with the scandal that follows the affair at the center of the episode, Lady Malmort is resigned to the fact that the deal is dead but Joan clearly isn't going anywhere.
-   _First Kill_: These are common among Legacy vampire families. Margot in the past rejected one to marry the human man she loved. Her daughter Elinor in contrast willingly enters one, though she pulls out over the issue of being expected to keep getting pregnant until the union produces a daughter.
-   These are a common political tool in _Game of Thrones_ and _House of the Dragon_ among the nobility of Westeros. Some are happy, such as Ned Stark and Catelyn Tully, and others are not, such as Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister. Many are against the will of one or both parties, such as Daenerys Targaryen and Drogo of the Dothraki or Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark. The political consequences also make breaking a marriage pact Serious Business.
    -   In fact, breaking a marriage pact is what gets Robb Stark murdered as he had an agreement with Lord Frey to marry one of his daughters and breaks the betrothal in "Valar Morghulis" by marrying Talisa Maegyr.
    -   Arranged marriages happen to Sansa Stark so often that she's basically pimped out to unconsummated marriages. First, there is Joffrey Baratheon, which she views as a Perfectly Arranged Marriage until he shows his true colours. After Joffrey repudiates her, the Tyrells plan to marry Sansa to Loras Tyrell for her claim to Winterfell. When Tywin Lannister finds out, he declares that she shall marry his son Tyrion instead, which they both do, as mentioned above, unwillingly. Tywin orders Tyrion to impregnate Sansa. He chooses not to impregnate her yet, but when she is ready. Seeing as the both of them are soon on the run because they've been framed for Joffrey's murder and neither had bothered to consummate the marriage, no one in Westeros seems to really acknowledge or care as to whether or not she is still married to him. When Tyrion is in serious danger of being executed, Sansa's aunt Lysa Tully begins to plan a marriage for her with Lysa's son Robin Arryn. Later, Lord Petyr Baelish and Lord Roose Bolton marry her to Bolton's son Ramsay after the bastard is made heir to Winterfell. It goes exactly as one would expect, with him treating her cruelly until she finally snaps and escapes with Theon's help.
    -   Fat Walda Frey with Roose Bolton, although he did get to choose which wife he wanted. It was more 'arranged' from her point of view than his. In the books, Fat Walda was actually ecstatic about the arranged marriage, and fully aware that he chose her from among Walder Frey's daughters and granddaughters because he was offered the chosen girl's weight in silver as a dowry - she was outright _proud_ that being overweight actually helped her for once. She knows it wasn't a marriage for love, but few marriages _are_ in Westeros, not even Eddard and Catelyn. The arranged marriage meant that she went from being an overweight and put-upon minor granddaughter of Walder Frey to being the wife of the new ruler of the North, head lady of a new Great House. As a result she is very grateful to Roose. For his part, Roose seems to like her - at least as much as he's capable of "liking" anyone.
    -   Cersei with Robert, as mentioned above. She initially saw it as a Perfectly Arranged Marriage up until Robert came to her drunk and called her by his late betrothed's name on their wedding night.
    -   Tywin commands Cersei to marry Ser Loras Tyrell. She's not amused, but this one falls through as Tywin is not there to enforce it, what with his terminal bowel problems.
    -   Tommen Baratheon is betrothed to Margaery Tyrell after his brother Joffrey dies at Joffrey and Margaery's wedding ceremony, and she quickly sneaks into his bedroom to suss him out before his mother Cersei has the chance to alienate the relationship. Tommen ends up falling for her hard, though with Margaery it's always unclear how sincere she is on her part given that she's definitely an ambitious political actor, though not a malicious one like several others in the series.
    -   Daenerys to Drogo, a powerful Dothraki khal, as mentioned above, to secure an army for her brother Viserys. Later, she arranges her own second marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq in Meereen, showing how much she and her circumstances have changed.
    -   Stannis Baratheon is in an Arranged Marriage to Selyse of House Florent.
    -   Renly Baratheon was in an Arranged Marriage to Margaery Tyrell before he died and she became betrothed to first Joffrey and then Tommen. An amiable one, although largely sexless for obvious reasons.
    -   As part of the negotiations that produced the arranged marriage Robb failed to actually have, Catelyn also promised her younger daughter Arya to Walder Frey's youngest son. However, Arya never finds out about this arrangement and with everyone who _was_ aware now dead, it's a moot point.
    -   Like Ned Stark, Lord Selwyn Tarth originally planned to marry off his daughter for political advantage. Unlike Ned, he eventually relented and taught her to fight like she wanted.
    -   Viserys I Targaryen accepts an arrangement to marry Alicent Hightower, the daughter of his Hand, Otto Hightower. Alicent is far younger than he is (she is the same age as Rhaenyra, Viserys' daughter with his first wife), but the prospect is brighter compared to a previous proposal for him to marry Laena Velaryon, who is literally still a child. Alicent is shown to be displeased by the marriage, but carries on because she is a Proper Lady, giving Viserys four more children.
    -   After the birth of his grandson Prince Aegon, Otto Hightower advises Viserys I to marry him off to Rhaenyra, therefore solving the issue regarding her controversial status as a crown princess, as she will be able to reign as queen without the sexist baggage of being a queen regnant. Viserys rejects the proposal because Aegon is only two years old at the time. Later, Rhaenyra is betrothed to her second cousin Laenor Velaryon, to make up for Laena's spurned candidacy as queen, while Aegon is married off to his sister, Helaena. While Rhaenyra and Laenor are amiable to each other (albeit with no romantic love involved, considering Laenor is gay), the same cannot be said to Aegon and Helaena, the latter of whom outright states that Aegon ignores her except when he is drunk.
    -   Rhaenyra's children Jacaerys and Lucerys Velaryon are betrothed to their stepsisters Baela and Rhaena Targaryen to seal an alliance with the Velaryons. Lady Rhaenys Targaryen clearly favors her granddaughters over her supposed grandsons, so matching them together will not only bring Rhaenys to her camp, but also legitimize Lucerys' shaky claim to Driftmark.
    -   Aemond Targaryen secures the Baratheons' support towards his brother Aegon II by offering to marry Floris, one of Lord Borros Baratheon's four daughters.
-   _Goodbye My Princess_: Almost all of the marriages in the series are arranged, which is Truth in Television for Imperial China. The arranged marriage between Xiao Feng and Cheng Ji (later changed to an arranged marriage between her and Cheng Yin) sets everything else in motion.
-   Parodied in Goodness Gracious Me: parents compromise with their westernised Punjabi son by setting him up with an arranged _shag_.
    
    We put an advert in the paper .. We've had a lot of responses, but we think this girl is the easiest.
    
-   One _Heroes_, it's implied that Noah and Sandra Bennet's marriage started as this when he first started to work for the Company. Thompson, his former partner, suggested that a wife would be a good anchor for Bennet in order to keep him from being completely Married to the Job. He then comments that the kindly waitress serving them would be a good fit once she was out of earshot. It turns out from her name tag that it's Sandra.
-   The British miniseries _I, Claudius_ has the hapless title character, a 48-year-old man, being forced to marry his teenage relative, Messalina. (This is at the behest of Claudius's Evil Nephew, the insane Emperor Caligula, who thought it would make for a funny joke.) The marriage seemed happy at first, until Messalina started showing her true gold-digging, nymphomaniac colors. She was eventually executed after a failed plot to depose Claudius and make one of her lovers ruler of Rome. As the show is actually based on the real-life Claudius, this is an example of Truth in Television.
-   The reality show _Indian Matchmaking_ follows profesional matchmaker Seema Taparia in the process of arranging marriages for her clients. Several episodes open or close with interviews of long-term, Happily Married couples whose marriages were arranged, including Taparia herself. The show strongly averts any sort of _forced_ marriage however, as none of the couples matched by Seema actually end up getting married, despite some like Akshay facing strong social or family pressure to marry. Most clients turn down the matches Seema makes for them. They give her a list of traits they want in a spouse, but invariably the most important one is _someone I'm attracted to_ — a reasonable request, but not something Seema can predict or screen for. It's clearly frustrating and exhausting for her to endlessly play "bring me another rock" with her clients.
-   _Kamen Rider Saber_: The plot of the Sabela and Durendal mini-series takes a page from the aforementioned _Gundam SEED Destiny_ episode "Flight to Tomorrow". Reika is set to get married with the son of a powerful family within the Sword of Logos named Rui Mitarai. On the other hand, just before the wedding, Ryoga learns that Rui murdered his own uncle to become the head of his clan from Ren. That said, Ryoga crashes the wedding and saves Reika, at the same time exposing Rui transforming into a Megid.
-   _The Last Kingdom:_ Uhtred enters into one with Mildrith purely to gain lands and a title in Wessex. Despite this, it proves a happy match until their son is born and cultural and religious differences take their toll.
-   _The Law According to Lidia Poët_: Lidia resisted one when she was younger, wanting only to marry a man who she'd chosen, though her mother rebuked her for her defiance. It's revealed her father had done this not for her benefit but a need for money as he was in debt. Enrico, her older brother, didn't know and is very upset to learn what he'd done. Her niece Marianna is having her marriage arranged too, but secretly wants another young man, and Lidia encourages her to pursue him.
-   In _Leonardo_, Lisa's backstory is escaping an arranged marriage. Lorenzo de'Medici is expected to marry the Duke of Pisa's daughter, Angelica. Since he's a He-Man Woman Hater and she's an Ice Queen who only defrosts with Lovable Rogue Mac, he tries to tell his father that it's not going to happen.
    
    **Piero**: That's fine. I'll just explain to the Duke of Pisa that the wedding is cancelled. That the treaty between Pisa and Florence is to be abandoned because my son and his daughter _don't love each other_.  
    **Lorenzo**: Are you being sarcastic?
    
-   Rayyan of _Little Mosque on the Prairie_ ends up in a traditional arranged marriage by her father. She doesn't mind, though, as she has time to get to know her prospective groom before he proposes, and has the power to call it off at any time. It ends badly, but not because of the arranged part.
-   The Reality TV series _Married At First Sight_ plays this straight, pairing couples who have never met before the bride walks down the aisle. The pairs are matched by experts, who are available throughout the experiment, and at the end of each season couples are given the option to divorce. Seeing as this is Reality TV, in the first season all three pairs have some good chemistry but also some issues (a pair who have great sexual chemistry but poor emotional intelligence; an Ugly Guy, Hot Wife match who are Birds of a Feather under the hood; a couple with a wife from a huge loving family and a husband who has walls up and an ailing mother). At the end of five weeks, the decisions were as follows: get a divorce, stay together and stay together.
-   Season 3 of _Merlin_, when Uther attempts to coerce Arthur into marrying Princess Elena for political betterment.
-   _Motherland: Fort Salem_:
    -   In High Atlantic society, it is common for witches to make five-year marriage contracts between the major families in order to mix witch bloodlines.
    -   Later, due to falling witch birth rates and the increasing deaths among them, the Imperatrix or Matriarch of the Imperative gets introduced. She's the head of the organization which arranges marriages, and won't listen even to Genderal Alder. She tells young witches it's their duty to marry and have children (only with other witches-no muggles), including Raelle, a lesbian, who's naturally uninterested and flatly refuses (it doesn't help that she's the child of a mixed marriage herself, with the Imperatrix telling her to make a "better choice" then her mother had done).
-   _Never Have I Ever_: Kamala's family is trying to set her up with a husband. At first she's secretly very reluctant, as she has a boyfriend (who's not Indian, and they're also having sex, neither of which they'd like). However, after she meets her would-be groom, she's smitten by his good lucks and charm, dumping her boyfriend. After her past relationship is revealed, he actually expresses approval since it makes her more interesting. They both agree to not rush into marriage however.
-   In _New Girl_, Cece (who is Indian) decides to let her parents arrange a marriage for her after she finds out from a gynecologist she might not have long to conceive a child. She and Schmidt still have feelings for each other, and Schmidt and Winston work together to sabotage the wedding through pranks. When they go too big with the pranks and release a badger into the air vents, it stops the wedding right before the couple is declared man and wife. Luckily for Cece and Schmidt, it turns out her arranged fiancé Shivrang is also in love with someone else, takes this opportunity to run off with her, and the arrangement is called off.
-   In _Night and Day_, Natalie Harper and Rachel Culgrin plot and scheme to bring about a marriage between Jane and Sam, their daughter and nephew respectively.
-   In one episode of _Night Court_, a young, beautiful woman is brought in, who turns out to be a princess of a small island nation, who is desperately trying to get out of an arranged marriage. As she tells Harry, her fiancé is a hulking, ugly, violent brute who is known to eat children. (He thinks she's exaggerating, until she shows him a photograph of the guy; unfortunately, the viewers never see it, and we have to take her word for it.) Unfortunately, Harry isn't able to do anything as far as legalities are concerned, but when he finds out how superstitious their culture is, he's able to teach her a few tricks that make her convince them to annul the arranged marriage herself (and possibly even make advances for women's lib there in the process).
-   The pilot of _NUMB3RS_ reveals that Amita's parents tried to set her up in one of these. Her "fiancé" is back in India, while Amita moved to the US when she was little. When asked if she plans to marry him, she replies that she won't, as she doesn't like the guy at all. In a later season, Amita and Charlie start dating. However, Amita admits to Charlie that the fact that he's not Indian will be a problem for her parents. At a dinner with her parents, an old friend of Amita's shows up at the invitation from her parents in an obvious attempt to set them up. Only one problem - the guy is gay. Also, they reveal that, after meeting Charlie face-to-face, they have warmed up to him.
-   Prince James and Princess Abigail in _Once Upon a Time_. James (when he was a humble Farm Boy) had previously vowed that he would marry for love, not money (and his mother approved, even when it seemed like the only way to save the farm).
-   _Our Flag Means Death_: Mary and Stede were in an arranged marriage, eventually leading to Stede running off years later due to his discomfort with the relationship. After his return, the two of them work together to fake his death so they can be with who they truly love.
-   In the _Power Rangers RPM_ two-parter "Ranger Yellow," the Yellow Ranger is coerced into an arranged marriage by her filthy-rich parents. The marriage was decided on when she was five, and they probably would've let her decline had the Venjix computer virus not nearly wiped out humanity, leaving her parents with only enough money to pretend to be filthy rich until she married someone who was still rich.
-   _The Practice_: "Victim's Rights" has a Roma girl from Romania seek political asylum in the US to avoid arranged marriage with a boy chosen by her parents (she's twelve at the time). She loses.
-   In one episode of _Pushing Daisies_, a man offers his daughter's hand in marriage as a bet in a dim sum poker game.
    -   And loses. Of course, his opponent was cheating...
-   _The Rise of Phoenixes_: Zhi Wei gets two. First to Ning Yi, which is quickly called off, and then to Helian Zheng.
-   _Rome_:
    -   Vorenus and Niobe have a discussion with their eldest daughter about arranging a marriage between her and a senator, and she doesn't seem to object. The parents point to themselves as an example of loving married couples, with Niobe adding "strange marriage it would be if you loved them from the start" as if the idea was completely foreign to her.
    -   Season two also has Posca marrying Jocasta, courtesy of Atia's arrangements. Jocasta isn't happy about this, as she's Nouveau Riche and Tosca is a freed slave, but since she's been raped and her entire family massacred in The Purge, she's not in a position to object. When we next see them however, they've gotten used to each other and get along fine.
-   Divya of _Royal Pains_ is drifting towards accepting her arranged marriage to a childhood friend. At the beginning, she tried to call it off, but when the engagement ceremony came around, she couldn't bring herself to do it. However, it's not like she _couldn't_ call it off or she hates the guy (he's kind of clueless and cheerful, actually); she's simply not certain she should be _married_ to him. Meanwhile, Evan keeps hoping....
-   _Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace_: Hongli's marriage in the first episode. He's presented with a group of women chosen by his adopted mother and is told to choose an official wife and a concubine from among them.
-   On _Salem_, Anne's parents plan to marry her off to Cotton Mather.
-   _Sense8_: Subverted. Kala's marriage to a young, wealthy man who she is not in love with is not an arranged marriage. He genuinely loves her, and everyone thinks she loves him back. But it still carries most of the Arranged Marriage tropes, as she's only going through with it because she knows he's a perfect match and doesn't want to disappoint her family.
-   In _Shadowhunters_, Shadowhunter families have been known to do this and the Lightwoods are planning one for Alec as a means of restoring the family power and honor. He gets to the altar before he decides he can't go through with it, instead making it publicly known that he's gay and in love with warlock Magnus Bane.
-   _Special Ops: Lioness_: Aaliyah is having her marriage arranged, which she doesn't want, though her father doesn't care. Cruz also pretends that she's getting a marriage arranged too while infiltrating Aaliyah's social circle.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
        -   Vulcans have a quite complicated marriage arrangement process. This often involves telepathically bonding the intended spouses in childhood, and breaking one's marriage commitment carries dire consequences (especially when one or both of them are in their _pon farr_ mating cycle).
        -   In "The Paradise Syndrome", Miramanee, the daughter of the tribal chief, is betrothed to the medicine man of the tribe. When Kirk saves the life of a boy who nearly drowns, he is given the position, angering the previous holder Salish.
    -   Explored with T'Pol in _Star Trek: Enterprise_, who had to debate whether to enter an arranged marriage which would entail her leaving the ship and returning to Vulcan. Although she refuses, the fourth season episode "Home" shows that her suitor has not given up and T'Pol is required to go through with it, even though she has fallen in love with Trip Tucker by that stage. Her husband divorces her voluntarily however when he realises the marriage is not working - after having already pulled strings to help her overthrow the Vulcan government.
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: Betazoids also have arranged marriages, referred to as "genetic bonding". This is explored in the episode "Haven", where it's revealed that Deanna is betrothed to the son of long-time friends of her parents; although it's a bit of an odd example given that the other family in question is human. The arrangement gets called off since Deanna's intended turns out to be in love with another woman he met in his dreams. It Makes Sense in Context.
    -   _Star Trek: Picard_ revealed that like their Vulcan cousins, Romulans have arranged marriages in which children are promised to each other at a young age.
-   _Sunset Beach_'s Rae's parents also wanted to do this. Though she tried to stand her ground, especially since she'd genuinely fallen in love with someone else, she caved in when they threatened to disown her, breaking her boyfriend's heart and nixing one of the show's first storylines.
-   _Supergirl (2015)_: Rhea tries to force Mon-El and Lena into one of these to create an heir and legitimize her invasion of Earth. They both refuse initially, but go along with it once Rhea starts threatening hospitals. Fortunately, the ceremony gets interrupted and they team up to escape.
-   Used in _Super Sentai_ by _Juken Sentai Gekiranger'. Ran/GekiYellow is taken to an_ omiai'' of the modern variety. Not wanting to break up the team (or lose the only female member in Ken's case) the guys attempt several plans that backfire rather spectacularly. The situation is eventually resolved when Ran convinces her mother that her responsibility as GekiYellow is more important.
-   The second season of _Timeless_ had an episode where the team went back to 1981. They initially think they're there to prevent Rittenhouse from interfering in the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, but they then meet a young Agent Christopher (their boss in 2018), who is just a Washington police officer at this time. When she is wounded during the assassination attempt, her family tries to get her to give up law enforcement and settle down to a marriage they arranged. She initially agrees, but Lucy and Jiya convince her not to, showing her pictures of her with her future wife (Agent Christopher is a lesbian) and children.
-   In _Victoria_, attempts are made both before and after her ascension to the throne to marry Victoria to various foreign or distantly related princes. One such suitor, her cousin Albert, actually does end up marrying Victoria, but it is a love match as well.
-   _The White Queen_:
    -   Lord Warwick arranges a match between his first daughter Isabel Neville and George of Clarence without King Edward IV's consent.
    -   He later does the same with his second daughter Anne Neville, who marries Edward of Lancaster against her will.
    -   His own marriage to his wife was also a planned union.
        
        **Countess Warwick**: Do you think I married for love? No, it was an agreement, a contract.
        
    -   Margaret Beaufort is very bitter at her mother Lady Beauchamp for forcing her to marry Edmund Tudor, and later Henry Stafford.
    -   The Duke of Buckingham and Catherine Woodville are around _10 and 8 years old_, respectively, when they have to walk down the wedding aisle. The boy groom is visibly grumpy during the ceremony, and Queen Elizabeth states that he's sulky.
    -   Elizabeth of York and Henry Tudor are betrothed by their mothers, and Elizabeth hates it (at first).
-   Very much parodied on _The Windsors_, where Prince Harry almost has an arranged marriage with the Australian Prime Minister's daughter Ashley. This is because Australia wants to leave the Commonwealth, and apparently marriage with Harry, who's not just a royal but also the closest thing the entirety of Great Britain has to an Australian, will convince them to stay. However, Harry backs out of it at the last minute because he's in love with Pippa, and it's unclear if Australia went through on leaving.
-   _The Witcher (2019)_: Queen Calanthe planned on arranging a husband for Pavetta, despite her objection.
-   _Young Blades_: An arranged political marriage between King Louis XIV and the princess of a newly rich kingdom drives the plot of "The Girl from Upper Gaborski". The princess whines and complains about it for the whole episode, leading to this bit of marital advice:
    
    **Queen Anne:** A state marriage is like a state dinner: you might not like the menu, but it's impolite to show it.  
    **Cardinal Mazarin:** If you would, think of Louis as... asparagus.  
    **Queen Anne:** Eat your vegetables in public, dear, but have your dessert in private.
    

    Music 

-   The folk song "Annachie Gordon":
    
    _Down came her father and he's standing on the floor  
    Saying, Jeannie, you're trying the tricks of a whore  
    You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee  
    You must marry with Lord Saltan and leave young Annachie_
    
-   Emilie Autumn's "Marry Me":
    
    _"Marry me", he said, through his rotten teeth, bad breath, and then: "Marry me instead of that strapping young goatherd", but when I was in his bed and my father had sold me I knew I hadn't any choice, hushed my voice, did what any girl would do."_
    
-   "Alice Childress" by Ben Folds Five. The couple has broken up because they have different ideas about how life works. Includes the line "An arranged marriage is not so good."
-   "Jock o'Hazeldean" is about a bride eloping from an arranged marriage with the eponymous hero.
-   "The Pocket Knife" by PJ Harvey from _Uh Huh Her_ is about a bride who waits to be married against her will and keeps a pocket knife with her, just in case:
    
    _Please don't make my wedding dress  
    I'm too young to marry yet  
    Can you see my pocket knife?  
    You can't make me be a wife  
    How the world just turns & turns  
    How does anybody learn?_
    
-   In the English folk ballad "The Tree They Grow So High", the young woman protagonist blames her father for marrying her to a mere boy half her age. She comes to love the boy afterward and bears his child, just before fate snatches her dear young husband from her.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Fairly common in The Bible, often perfectly. Isaac and Rebecca, for example, were arranged when Isaac's father, Abraham, sent his servant Eliezer to find a suitable wife in the family's homeland. Jacob also arranged Rachel and got a couple of other wives (one of them being Rachel's big sister Leah) in the process.
-   According to Christian martyrology, in order to escape an arranged marriage to a pagan king, a Rebellious Princess named Wilgefortis pleaded to God to make her repulsive in appearance so she could remain unmarried and keep her vow of virginity. Soon she grew a beard, utterly repulsing the suitor who called the arrangement off, and for this her evil father had her crucified. With time, Wilgefortis was canonized and became the patron saint for women trapped in abusive marriages.
-   Classical Mythology:
    -   Zeus arranged the marriage between Aphrodite, the Goddess of love and beauty to the deformed Hephaestus-apparently to stop the other gods from squabbling about her. Although that did not stop Aphrodite from dallying around in any way...
    -   For that matter, Aphrodite arranged for Helen of Troy to fall in love with Paris, as reward for Paris giving a golden apple to her instead of to Hera or Pallas Athena. Of course, since Helen already _was_ married, this led directly to the Trojan War (at which point Paris learned why it's generally a bad idea to slight Hera). This indicates how little Aphrodite cared about the idea of marriage in the first place.
    -   Aphrodite and Ares' (illegitimate) daughter Harmonia <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  was given away in an arranged marriage to the mortal nobleman Cadmus, a distant descendant of Poseidon and founder of the Kingdom of Thebes. Apparently they were happy, but what happened to their kids...!

    Podcasts 

-   In _The Adventure Zone: Balance_, Merle was formerly in one of these with his ex-wife, Hekuba.
-   In _Trials & Trebuchets_, Serinepth finds to her horror that she has been arranged to marry the bumbling Prince Frederick. While she does manage to break off her engagement with the prince, doing so results in the prince declaring her and her family traitors to the crown.

    Roleplay 

-   _There is no GATE; we did not fight there_:
    -   Betrothals and arranged marriage are perfectly common and expected amongst the nobles of the Empire. Kytheus is expected to eventually be married to a Lady of another province to secure supplies and an alliance for Rhavenfell.
    -   The choice of Kytheus' eventual main wife was left to the players of the quest in a poll that listed each of the advantages that would come with them. The Quest GM also wrote a number of interludes from the perspectives of each possible spouse in order to showcase their personalities. The resulting arguments and deliberations were... _heated_ to say the least.

    Theatre 

-   _An American in Paris_: Although Henri seems relatively happy to comply, at least at first, it is very clear that Lise and Henri's marriage was arranged by Madame Baurel to protect Henri's reputation.
-   While the Commedia dell'Arte had no fixed plot (it was rather a set of stock characters), generally whatever the day's plot was involved this. The parents were generally Pantalone, a rich old merchant, and Il Dottore, an old doctor; usually Il Dottore's daughter was engaged to Pantalone but in love with his son, but they occasionally swapped parents. The plots were made up mostly of these four and a variety of servants and acquaintances that could work for any of them trying to unite the lovers and either get rich or laid.
-   _Cyrano de Bergerac_:
    -   It's implied Count De Guiche married Cardenal Richelieu’s niece only to improve his connections at the Court.
    -   De Guiche tries to set up one for Roxane, as she says in Act II Scene VI:
        
        **Roxane:** _\[who has unmasked\]_ That dandy count,  
        Whom you checkmated in brave sword-play  
        Last night... he is the man whom a great lord,  
        Desirous of my favor...  
        **Cyrano:** Ha, De Guiche?  
        **Roxane:** _\[casting down her eyes\]_ Sought to impose on me... for husband...
        
-   _Fiddler on the Roof_:
    -   Taking place in an early 20th-century Slavic Jewish community where Old Traditions (Arranged Marriage) were rapidly clashing with New Ideas (marrying for love), discusses this as a tradition; the original books suggested that it was a good idea, while the musical adaptation was more neutral on the subject. Each of Tevye's teenage daughters ultimately ended up with the man she wanted, but each suffered the consequences: Tzeitel lives in abject poverty with Motel, rather than the relative comfort she would have had with Lazar Wolf; Hodel winds up in Siberia and Chava is disowned. The practice was to keep marriages within the Jewish community, but the musical points out that this is why the system fails.
    -   Tevye and Golde's duet "Do You Love Me?" addresses the belief that an arranged marriage can ripen into love, while "Matchmaker", sung by the daughters, addresses both the pros and cons of arranged marriages.
-   Gilbert and Sullivan use this as a plot device several times:
    -   In _The Grand Duke_, Grand Duke Rudolph was betrothed in infancy to the Princess of Monte Carlo, but the arrangement has a sunset provision he hopes to exploit.
    -   In _The Gondoliers_, Casilda and the Crown Prince of Barataria were not merely betrothed, but actually married as infants. This is news to the bride.
        
        **Duke:** When you were a prattling babe of six months old you were married by proxy to no less a personage than the infant son and heir of His Majesty the immeasurably wealthy King of Barataria!  
        **Casilda:** Married to the infant son of the King of Barataria? Was I consulted? _\[Duke shakes his head.\]_ It was a most unpardonable liberty!  
        **Duke.** Consider his extreme youth and forgive him.
        
    -   _The Mikado_ has as its background Nanki-Poo running away and posing as a wandering minstrel to get away from an arranged marriage with Katisha.
    -   In _Princess Ida_, Hiliarion was two years old and Ida one when they were betrothed. Straw Feminist Ida, now 21, wants no part of this arrangement; but if her father Gama fails to deliver his daughter as agreed, it will mean war.
-   In _Knickerbocker Holiday_, Mynheer Tienhoven arranges for his daughter Tina to marry Governor Stuyvesant, though she remains in love with The Hero, Brom.
-   In _The Lady's Not for Burning_, Alizon's parents have arranged for her to marry Humphrey, the mayor's nephew. When she arrives at the beginning of the play to prepare for the wedding, she mentions that she's only met Humphrey once. She finds a kindred spirit in Richard, the mayor's clerk, and she and Richard elope at the end of the play.
-   The _Mrs. Hawking_ play series: In part one, _Mrs. Hawking_, the titular protagonist declares that her father "sold her like a sheep" to her husband the Colonel. In part four: _Gilded Cages_, it's revealed that her father, Governor Stanton, agreed to spare a starving village in Singapore from some oppressive policies if she consented to the wedding.
-   _Naughty Marietta_: The motivation for the heroine being in The Big Easy.
-   _On a Clear Day You Can See Forever_ has Melinda Welles' family making elaborate preparations for her to marry Sir Hubert Insdale. She quashes the proposal simply by saying "no" to him.
-   Parodied in _The Rivals_. Sir Anthony Absolute announces to his son Jack that he's arranged for him to be married to a wealthy heiress. Jack refuses to go along with the arrangement since he already loves Lydia. Then he finds out that Lydia is the wealthy heiress in question, and makes a show of allowing himself to be reluctantly persuaded.
-   Shakespearean examples:
    -   In _All's Well That Ends Well_, the king arranges a marriage between his ward Bertram and Helena. That ends better, once Bertram has been persuaded to accept it.
    -   _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ features Hermia, who is betrothed to Demetrius despite being in love with another man, Lysander; matters are further complicated by the fact that Hermia's friend Helena is in love with Demetrius. He used to love and court her but dropped her for a better marriage to Hermia. The matter is finally resolved when Oberon and Puck enchant Demetrius to go back to Helena; when he cancels the previous arrangement, Hermia's father allows her to marry Lysander instead.
    -   Shakespeare's most poignant use of this trope may have occurred in _Romeo and Juliet_, whereby Juliet finds herself forcibly betrothed to Count Paris (by this point, she's already married to Romeo, but her parents don't know that). His steady, mature love may actually have made him a better match for Juliet than the Hot-Blooded Romeo. (But how dramatic would _that_ have been?). _Romeo and Juliet_ was published in 1597.
        
        **Juliet**: _Is there no pity sitting in the clouds  
        That sees into the bottom of my grief?  
        O sweet my mother, cast me not away!_
        
    -   In _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, Sylvia's father insists that she marry Tyrio, when in fact she's in love with Valentine.
-   _Westeros: An American Musical_: The play takes place in a medieval setting during a war and focuses on the alliances made by various members of the nobility. Sealing alliances via arranged marriages comes up a lot.
-   _Which Witch The Musical_: Maria is to marry German banker Anton Fugger, despite being in love with bishop Daniel.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The wedding between Hanse Davion and Melissa Steiner was one of these in _BattleTech_, having been negotiated in a secret treaty between the Lyran Commonwealth and Federated Suns at the very end of the Third Succession War. By all accounts, it was a very happy marriage (even though the wedding day also saw Hanse launch the Fourth Succession War) both politically — merging the Federated Suns and the Lyran Commonwealth into the Federated Commonwealth (though the Commonwealth itself ended badly after both Hanse and Melissa had died) and personally, with both falling in love with each other, even despite the significant age difference between them — Hanse was 45 at the time of the wedding, Melissa was 18.
-   This is common practice for samurai in _Legend of the Five Rings_. The Advantage "Imperial Spouse" makes it a positive, as your clan has managed to wrangle a marriage between you and a member of one of the imperial families, giving you a reliable foothold in court politics. On the other hand, the Flaw "Bitter Betrothal" indicates that your spouse hates you (and the feeling is probably mutual) and will work to undercut your efforts.

    Toys 

-   At least two of the girls in _Little Apple Dolls_ have backstories of being betrothed to men. It never ends up well. In one of the cases he locked the girl in a cage, apparently was going to steal her soul, and planned to turn her into a demon. She opted to kill herself instead. Mind you, she was _seven_ when she died.

    Video Games 

-   Both _Crusader Kings_ games feature arranged marriages, as would be appropriate for a game based in the Middle Ages. The second one particularly focuses on the "contract between two families" aspect; since alliances are between relatives, the only way to ally with people outside your own dynasty is through intermarriage — yourself or one of your close relatives to them or one of their relatives.
-   The fourth licensed _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ game has this as part of the overall mystery of the murder of an Indian doctor in his bed while his blind wife was sitting downstairs. In fact, preventing it was the motive. The doctor was forcing his daughter into marrying a scumbag from the family's homeland - specifically the son of the doctor's old friend. The daughter kept refusing, even (rightfully) getting her fiancé charged for stealing her father's credit card and supplies from their surgery. Her father was insistent on the marriage and even had the charges dropped (again, the fiancé _stole from him_). She also tried to get her father's medical license revoked for malpractice (also justified as he performed a surgery he wasn't trained for on his own wife and blinded her more out of a sense of pride than anything), but the charges never stuck because the mother was willing to take the abuse to protect her daughter and her family's honor. Near the end, he made an ultimatum to the daughter: go through with the marriage or be cut off from her mother. Then it turns out that the mother isn't completely blind...
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins_:
        -   In the City Elf origin, you have an arranged marriage to another city elf. It's out of necessity or perhaps tradition rather than politics (elves are treated as second-class and relegated to slums). How your character views the situation is up to you - it's entirely possible that you're happy with the situation and so is your spouse. Of course, it still doesn't end well when the local nobility decides to have some fun.
        -   Arl Howe tries to set one up between the Human Male Warden and his daughter Delilah (or a Human Female Warden and his son Thomas) in the Noble Origin, but seeing how the story turns out, it never comes to pass. Then, in _Awakening_, you actually meet Delilah, who wasn't at all pleased about being set up with the Male Warden and has since married a commoner in Amaranthine, with a child on the way.
            
            **Delilah:** He's so much better than that stuck-up Cousland boy that father kept trying to set me up with.  
            **Warden:** I'm right here.  
            **Delilah:** Oh. Er. That was you, wasn't it? **Awkward**!
            
        -   It's possible to arrange a political marriage during the Landsmeet when resolving the question of who will rule Ferelden. This can be established either between Alistair and Anora, between Anora and Male Cousland, or between Alistair and Female Cousland, even if they are not in a romance.
        -   Anora herself states that her marriage to Calian was an arranged one, though they grew to love each other. _The World of Thedas, vol. 2_ more or less corroborates this, as the two were raised as close friends and went on adventures together.
    -   _Dragon Age II_:
        -   Leandra Amell, the player character's mother, was facing one when she met and fell in love with the apostate mage Malcolm Hawke. She eloped with him rather than spend her life in a loveless marriage. However, supplemental material indicates that she didn't really mind the arrangement until she met the dashing mage; as of the time of the game, she and her former betrothed, the Comte de Launcet, are still on friendly terms.
    -   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_
        -   During Josephine's romance arc, her family betroth her to a young nobleman, whom the Inquisitor can challenge to a duel for her hand in marriage. However, after seeing that the two are legitimately in love rather than just being a fling, the lord in question calls off the duel and is happy for them. (Oddly, this never comes up if Josephine is _not_ romanced, in which situation the betrothal would work out just fine; presumably it still takes place and she simply never brings it up since it's not a problem.)
        -   Dorian's conflict with his family centers on his refusal to enter an arranged marriage partly due to being gay and partly because he and his betrothed just plain don't like each other. He ended up fleeing altogether when his father tried something very, very ugly. Dorian's parents themselves were arranged in a loveless political marriage for the sole purpose of breeding a strong mage. The fact that they otherwise hate each other neatly explains both Dorian's determination not to end up in the same situation and why they have no other children who could have kept the line going.
        -   As it turns out, one of these factors into Varric's romantic history - not for him, but for the girl he wanted to marry. They were going to elope, but she left him at the altar and went through with the arrangement her parents put together instead.
-   In _Dragon Quest VIII_, Princess Medea and Prince Charmles have an arranged marriage. When the heroes (with Medea transformed into a horse pulling their cart) go on a mission with Charmles, she sees firsthand that his name may as well have an extra "S" at the end. In the end, with her own father's blessing (and even _Charmles's_ father going along with it, though how strongly depends on which ending you earned), Medea runs off with the hero instead. If the true ending is obtained, she is able to marry the hero with no obstacles, because the agreement was for her to marry a prince of Argonia, not Charmles specifically. Turns out the hero's father was the king of Argonia's older brother.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_: Optional follower Borgakh the Steel Heart is the daughter of the chieftain of the orc stronghold Mor Khazgur, and joins up with the Dragonborn to escape an eventual arranged marriage to another stronghold. This is accomplished either with a Speechcraft check, in which case she runs away with you, or by paying off her bride-price so the stronghold doesn't lose out on what they'd get for her.
-   _Final Fantasy_
    -   In _Final Fantasy Legend II_, the New God Venus arranges the marriage between Nills (Julius in Japan) and Flora (Olivia), despite the latter's relationship with Leon (Anthony) whom Venus has banished from her city due to his damaged leg. It's up to the protagonists to stop the marriage from taking place.
    -   In _Final Fantasy XII_, the Princess Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca has an arranged marriage to Lord Rasler of Nabradia intended to promote an alliance. He dies soon after (not a spoiler since it happens in the opening tutorial). Also note that unlike most examples of this trope, they were actually quite happy with each other after a little bit of friction.
        
        **Rasler:** A marriage of convenience. A symbol of the alliance between Nabradia and Dalmasca. This is how they see our match.  
        **Ashe:** They do, do they?  
        **Rasler:** These roles we play. I must admit I find it... wearying.
        
    -   In _Final Fantasy XV_, Prince Noctis Lucis Caelum, heir to the Lucian throne, is betrothed to Lady Lunafreya Nox Fleuret of Tenebrae. While there is insufficient information to conclude that they actually want to marry each other, there is likely no friction due to them being Childhood Friends. Despite having been estranged due to Niflheim's invasion of Tenebrae and Lunafreya being held captive, both are said to cherish their childhood memories of each other.
-   Arranged marriages in _Fire Emblem_ only lead to problems with irrevocable consequences:
    -   _Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem_: This is what happened to Prince Hardin of Aurelis and Princess Nyna of Archanea, for lineage-preservation and political reasons. While Hardin loved Nyna, she thought well of him but didn't _romantically_ love him and actually was in love with Camus, and she agreed to marry Hardin because of her counselors' pressure on her and the desperate need to save Archanea. It's easy to guess who exploits Hardin's bad feelings over the whole matter and turns him into a major villain in _Mystery of the Emblem_... _It's Gharnef._ At the end Nyna goes to one horribly Break the Cutie process, Hardin only comes to his senses as he _dies_ in Marth's arms, and after briefly seeing that Camus was Not Quite Dead (under the identity of Sirius), Nyna hands Archanea to Marth and Caeda, then gets the Hell away of everything.
        -   The Macedon noblewoman Lena and the Archanean nobleman Jeorge were supposed to marry Prince Michalis and Midia respectively. Lena got the Hell out of Macedon and ultimately got together with Julian, whereas Midia defied her and Jeorge's families by choosing Astram (much to Jeorge's relief).
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_: This is what happened to King Desmond and Queen Hellene for financial and political reasons. Desmond was embittered by not being able to choose the woman he wanted to marry - who ends up as his mistress bearing his daughter instead - and his just as embittered wife venomously taunts him over the fact that their son will be King of Bern and that his daughter will be nothing. This is what led to him conspiring to take his son out of the picture by any means, culminating with attempting to assassinate him and having it backfire (and Hellene also unintentionally neglected her own son's well being for being overly ambitious). And who is their son? _It's Zephiel._
    -   _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_: This is what was going to happen to Astrid for financial and political reasons. Astrid hated her family's decision of arranging a wedding consisting of her and a noble from Begnion, and she greatly despised the man in question. This is what led to her running away from her family to have a life that wasn't run by other people. Who she was supposed to marry? _Lekain_. Ashera knows what could have happened to poor Astrid if she ended up going through it.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, the A-Support of Bernadetta and Ferdinand reveals that they were arranged to be wed but the latter called it off after hearing some frightening rumors about the former. However, after getting to know her better, he says he would've been happy to go through with it. In their paired ending, they do end up marrying.
-   _Harvest Moon_:
    -   In _Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life_, Celia is engaged to a man from outside of town. She is ambivalent and later outright throws it off, in part due to her feelings for you. She'll marry Marlin if you don't marry her. If you get all of Celia's heart events but marry _another_ woman, Celia will appear at your house and call you about about how you broke her heart and how she threw off her arranged marriage because of you only for you to betray her.
    -   In the Japanese version of _Harvest Moon DS_, Muffy's parents try to arrange a marriage for their Old Maid of a daughter. Muffy refuses. The English version changes it into a blind date.
    -   In _Harvest Moon 2_, the mayor wants his daughter Maria to marry an unspecified man. Maria, however, doesn't want to. This leads to her staying at Sara's until her father convinces her to come home.
-   _Haven (2020)_: One of the reasons that Kay and Yu left the Apiary is because Kay was set up with a "Mate". He didn't even glance at her profile before they ran away, but Yu convinces him to at least take a look.

-   Two seasons into a new round of _King of the Castle_, the King is told (by the Queen Mother if they are at the beginning of a dynasty, by the Chancellor if they usurped the throne) that they must get married to secure their position on the throne. They are given a choice between the scions of noble families from each of the three regions, with political alliances emphasised over personal feelings, although the King can take a fourth option by refusing to marry any of them in favour of either not getting married at all or getting married for love to a commoner or one of several NPCs (at risk of raising all three regions' Defiance).
-   For what little the lore has, _League of Legends_ gives us how the Queen of Freljord, Ashe, arranged it herself that she's married with Tryndamere the Barbarian King in order to represent Freljord as a nation and stabilize politics. Their marriage seems steady despite how any romantic feelings between the two are unknown (although Fanon would depict them as Happily Married).
    -   And then the Freljord event happened and proved the marriage had the _exact opposite effect_. The union was all Ashe's rival Sejuani needed to convince every other clan to rebel in a concerted show of contempt for trying to use a coward's game of politics to take power over a land where the strong survive. And this happened just in time for the evil Ice Queen sealed in the coldest, least-habitable corner of the land to rear her head just when any chance of uniting against a common foe was completely off the table. Great move, Ashe.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_: Link becomes engaged to Princess Ruto when he accepts the Zora Sapphire from her, as it is only meant to be given to Ruto's future husband. After the Time Skip, Ruto still holds Link to this "promise", though ultimately the marriage must be put on indefinite hold because of Link's duty as the Hero of Time and Ruto's as the Sage of Water.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: Princess Mipha intended to propose to Link with the Zora Armor before she was killed, horrifying the royal advisor Muzu. In the alternate timeline game _Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity_ the player can choose to accept the Zora Armor from her on Link's behalf by completing the _Heart's Escort_ quest.
-   Channing and Gloria of _Lunarosse_ are caught in one since the beginning of the game due to business purposes. They don't like each other at all to start with, but the two can develop a genuine relationship depending on how the game plays out.
-   In _Might and Magic: Heroes VI_, Emperor Liam Falcon attempts to end the feud between the Wolf and Griffin Duchies by organising a wedding between Irina, daughter of Griffin Duke Slava, and Wolf Duke Gerhart.
-   In _Miitopia_, the Princess of Greenhorne is in love with her childhood friend, the son of a besmirched noble, but she is meant to be married to the Prince of Nekdsor, who is a cowardly, disdainful and insufferable douchebag. Though, when her face is stolen by the Dark Lord, the Prince runs away sobbing with fear while her friend bravely goes to save her without any hesitation, despite being hopelessly outmatched. The Princess's father saw it all, and realized that he was far better than the Prince of Neksdor, cancelling the engagement.
-   In _Odin Sphere_, the fate of valkyries too wounded in battle to continue their careers as warriors is to be married off and serve as housewives and child-bearers. They consider it a Fate Worse than Death.
-   _Oracle of Askigaga_: The princess of Hachisuka is set by her father to marry the prince of Askigaga to bring peace, but she doesn't like it, wanting to personally mow down the opposing army instead.
-   _Persona_:
    -   Go through Mitsuru's Social Link for enough time in _Persona 3_ and you'll discover that, to stabilize the Kirijo Group after her father's death, the board of directors has arranged for her to marry a much older man. She seems to have accepted it, but (judging by the proper answers to the dialogue prompts) the main character isn't fooled.
    -   In _Persona 5_, Haru, a party member and, like Mitsuru, representative of the Empress arcana, is forced into another such marriage and is somewhat more open about her dislike of it.
-   Nagamasa and Oichi in all _Samurai Warriors_ which was forged to create an alliance between Nagamasa and Oichi, but does not end well.
-   _The Spirit Engine 2_ has Ferwin, caught in the traditional business-pact-marriage. It's complicated further by the fact that there's _another_ woman who he does love and wants to marry her instead. This causes him to become a Runaway Fiancé.
-   In _Star Ocean: The Second Story_, the prince of Krosse and the princess of Lacuer have an arranged marriage. If you trigger a certain series of Private Actions in Krosse, however, you can stop the wedding so that one of them can be with their true love. However, it's implied that the _other_ royal _did_ actually have feelings for their arranged partner.
-   In _Super Paper Mario_, The Chaos Heart can only be awakened to its full, reality-sundering power by the marriage of two individuals never meant to be together. Count Bleck invades Mario's reality to abduct Peach and Bowser for his attempt to engender a Reality-Breaking Paradox, and Nastasia is forced to take control of Peach to get the doom train out of the station (Peach, naturally, would never agree to wed Bowser).
-   Discussed in _Tales of Graces_ by Malik, Asbel, Richard, and Hubert. While Malik plays observer to it, the other three show disdain for it. Hubert mostly dislikes it because he thinks the person you marry should be your choice. Asbel and Richard agree and bemoan the marriage proposals they get.
    
    **Asbel:** I don't think someone should pick their wife like something out of a catalogue.
    
-   _Tears to Tiara 2_ has an interesting twist. Hanno, the Governor-General of Qart Hadast, arranges a marriage between his daughter Elissa and Hamil to cement an alliance with Hispania. She agrees and sets out for Hispania. She's taken by slavers. When she and her bodyguard Daphnis were about to die fighting, Hamil and the party pulls a Big Damn Hero moment. The result is that Elissa rejects the proposal because of her Love Epiphany. Hamil himself is much relieved as well.
-   _Yes, Your Grace_: The Player Character's two oldest daughters are just old enough to marry and a year away from usual marriage age respectively. Marrying off the oldest of the two is a non-negociable element of the game's plot, but things are more open with the younger one: two different offers for her show up over the course of the game, and the player can choose to take neither and let her run off with her lover instead.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Akatsuki no Goei_ this was mostly a thing with the previous generation. Genzou was engaged to a woman named Yuri until Masaki eloped with her and took her to the prohibited district and Akiko married some random guy despite having a thing for Kaito's dad as well. He died, though, so she likes flirting with her daughter's boyfriend.
-   Kaori in _Crescendo (JP)_ intended to go through with an _omiai_ arranged marriage (and presumably does so offscreen on the occasions when the player fails to achieve her good ending or chooses a different path).
-   Leanna of _Crystalline_ is nearly coerced into one by her father, but he backs down when she threatens to give up her family name.
-   _Guenevere_:
    -   The game opens on the day of Guenevere's arranged marriage to King Arthur - player choice can determine whether it is to be a Perfectly Arranged Marriage or a nightmare.
    -   Morgana also had an arranged marriage to King Lot of Orkney prior to the beginning of the plot.
-   _Long Live the Queen_:
    -   Played very straight with the twist that you, the Crown Princess, get to arrange your _own_ marriage. Nearly all of these marriages are purely political in nature, although you and your spouse may or may not end up developing mutual respect at the very least, depending on who you choose. However, if you do manage to make it to the end of the game without getting engaged, you have the option to instead wait for love, and this causes you to end up with an unnamed Earl who's good at baking. It's also possible to marry a guy and end up with a lovely lady on the side, or to outright refuse marriage and instead cycle through a bunch of lovers, discarding them whenever you get bored.
    -   The player also has an opportunity to arrange someone else's marriage in order to end a war. This can either go as well as can be hoped for or end up _very badly_, depending on whether or not you pass the appropriate skill check.
-   _Seven Kingdoms: The Princess Problem_ takes place during a political summit which is held every seven years to strengthen diplomatic ties between the eponymous Seven Kingdoms. One of the main goals of the summit (and the game) is to form a politically advantageous marriage arrangement that will _not_ make the participants miserable.
-   Ai and Forbesii in _Tick! Tack!_ are arranged to be married. Ai likes the idea, but Forbesii doesn't really care. He doesn't hate her, but he's fallen for his maid in the last year instead.
-   In _Tyrion Cuthbert: Attorney of the Arcane_, William Frega arranged the marriage of his middle daughter Laefe and Jaiden von Sanctus. House von Sanctus would be absorbed, but Jaiden would inherit all of the Frega estate and be the new head. Laefe never wanted to marry Jaiden, and after William's death she's no longer obligated to do it.
-   Hatsuhime from _Yo-Jin-Bo_ was intended to be married to _a ten-year-old_ by her retainer Yahei, because said ten-year-old was the only "suitable" match for a princess to be found in the entire clan.

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_: In Elven society pre-marital courtship consists of an elaborate system of blackmail and counter-blackmail. And that's mild compared to what went on a few centuries earlier.
-   _Cirque Royale_ has Penelope explains to her niece, Red, that the royal line has always had the parents set up the next in line with an "appropriate" partner with wanted qualities for the kingdom—such as strength, beauty, or wisdom. Red's mother Quinn Mills was Clown Princess and engaged to Leo Cashworthy due to the Cashworthys' wealth in part because the kingdom was broke and needed the money the Cashworthys would bring to the kingdom, but she ran away from home and married the half-mime Kingston while she was missing. Multiple kingdoms have these kinds of marriages internally and externally in order to form alliances; Flower Queen and Cactus Queen are part of an arraigned marriage for the Plant Kingdom, and happen to have fallen in love over the course of the marriage. (Toothpaste Queen and Orange King, not so much.)
-   _The Cyantian Chronicles_: Tira and Caite. Twice.
-   Wildy of _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_ is due to be married to one of five possible candidates, they seem relatively okay with this.

    -   Jiminez Hoffmann accidentally arranges his own marriage when he proposes a way to end a generations-long war by arranging a marriage between the Talpini prince and the Arguron princess.

The Talpini king has adopted Hoffman as his son, so _he_ can get married to the princess instead!
    -   Seffie acknowledges that she is doomed to an arranged marriage, and is doing her best to arrange one with Gil.

-   The first story arc of _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_ involved a Squicky forced political marriage between Green-Skinned Space Babe Princess Voluptua and Starfish Alien Ahem.
-   Rabbit society in _Kevin & Kell_ is fond of this trope:
    -   The concept was introduced not long after Coney's first word when rabbits started trying to arrange a marriage between their sons and Coney. Even considering Coney's freakish in their eyes because she's half-wolf, they still want to do so because they know she doesn't attack her own family. Kell refuses and says Coney will marry for love.
    -   Kevin was supposed to have married who would be his rival in the school board elections, Fran Caudal, but Fran's parents called it off because Kevin had no fear (and therefore abnormal in their eyes).
    -   Angelique had arranged a marriage between Lindesfarne and a hedgehog without telling Kevin, only bringing it up — and that it hasn't been broken off — when she got engaged to Fenton. Turns out though that the hedgehog, Quinn, was dating Lindesfarne's best friend Rhonda, and they got married so Lindesfarne was free to break the contract and marry Fenton.
        -   And Quinn's parents, who were _very_ enthusiastic about the marriage (to the point of putting in quill-proof rubber walls in anticipation of children) vowed to force a divorce between Quinn and Rhonda until Rhonda defended them against her jilted ex-boyfriend.
    -   Long ago, the marriage of George and Martha Fennec had been one of these, done to add some diversity to their respective gene pools. Except they hated each other and eventually divorced when they caught each other cheating.
-   _The Less Than Epic Adventures of TJ and Amal_ begins this way, when Amal calls off the marriage his parents set up for him and comes out to them, prompting them to disown him. His ending up drunkenly agreeing to drive cross-country with a total stranger is what sets the plot rolling.
-   The Severin family in _Muted_ make their living off these. The daughter of the Head Matriarch must summon a demon on their 21st birthday with the explicit purpose of wishing for a rich husband.
-   _No Rest for the Wicked:_ The backstory of the comic is that (Princess) November ran away from home in order to escape a Standard Hero Reward with the unnamed "Boy", a naive Fearless Fool peasant who managed to rescue a huge treasure from a haunted castle. The Boy seems genuinely smitten with her, however; between November's own story arcs, the comic features him traveling around the world with an upbeat spirit, hoping to find her. Well, she is the youngest, if you catch my drift.
-   And for a modern Western example? _Ozy and Millie_ has Ozy betrothed to one of his more distant cousins, Isolde. There is a notable age difference, as only one of them is physically mature. Ozy 'talks' his way out of it: after an exceptional performance at a family sporting event, he breathes fire on the betrothal papers. His father objects to the idea; it's described by a matriarch-like figure that it'd be the best way for Ozy to really do good for his family, given the species gap.
-   _Princess Princess (2012)_: Amira's parents were trying to set her up with various princes whom she found boring (and, since she's only shown as attracted to Sadie, probably wouldn't work out regardless). She ran away to become a hero again.
-   It's the central plot for the two main characters, Miharu and Kazuo, in _Red String_. It's also the center of the subplot for Miharu's cousin Karen and her betrothed, Makoto.

-   In _Tsunami Channel_, Yamato Nadeshiko Haruna arrives and stays because she has promised with the protagonist, or so she claims. It's eventually discovered that she _was_ in a tightly arranged promise before, made when she was still a child. However, she and her fiancé eventually fell in genuine love with each other, but the boy got a mortal disease and dissolved the promise a couple of days before his death. Obviously, she was devastated, until the professor Hasegawa showed her a photo of the protagonist who, coincidentally, was too similar to her dead fiancé.

    Web Original

    Western Animation 

-   _Amphibia_:
    -   Played for Laughs in an early episode, where Sprig is betrothed to the local baker's daughter in exchange for pizza dough. Everyone is fairly nonchalant about "selling" Sprig, including Sprig himself (he's creeped out by _who_ he's marrying, sure, but doesn't protest the deal at all and expresses optimism that they can learn to love each other).
    -   Happens again with Sprig and his childhood friend Ivy. When Sprig's grandfather and Ivy's mother realize they're close, they immediately decide to start them courting as part of a profitable business arrangement for both sides. Sprig points out that he's already engaged to someone else, but everyone ignores him.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   In the final episodes of the first season, Sokka falls for Princess Yue, who is very unhappy to be headed for an arranged marriage to Hahn. She gets out of it by becoming the moon spirit, and by Hahn having a played-for-laughs death (Come on, thrown off a boat into Arctic waters? Dude is dead).
    -   Fire Lord Ozai and Princess Ursa were also an arranged marriage. Since she is Avatar Roku’s granddaughter, Ozai and his father wanted to marry the two bloodlines. Ursa was actually engaged to another man when he proposed. This might hint that Zuko and Mai may have been arranged for each other early on as well, although they're so genuinely in love with each other (even blushing around each other as children) that it doesn't really matter anyway.
    -   Sokka and Katara's grandmother, Kanna, was once arranged to be married to Waterbending Master Pakku, who saw her as the "love of his life". She ran away from the Northern to the Southern Tribe to avoid him and the Northern Tribe's traditions, and Pakku grew incredibly bitter and misogynistic as a result. It appears to have been the traditions were the problem rather than Pakku's person, however, because months after Pakku - having had a change of heart after meeting Katara and realising Kanna's actual reasons to leave - travelled to the Southern Tribe, he and Kanna properly got married, this time in mutual love.
-   _BoJack Horseman_: Happened with Beatrice Horseman in her youth when father heavily pushed her to accept Corbin Creamerman since their families could profit from a sugar-cream alliance to make a profitable ice cream empire. It's implied that it would've been a Perfectly Arranged Marriage when they started to get to know each other better. Then she got pregnant with BoJack from Butterscotch.
-   _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_: Just in case you forgot that Mira Nova was a princess (and considering how Action Girl she is, it's pretty easy), one episode has Mira finding out about an arranged marriage that has been set up for her.

Neither of them want to go through with it, so King Shark confronts his father and makes a big show of decline. When he returns to the surface, he reveals that he changed his mind minutes later and went through with it because he couldn't refuse his father. However, King Shark and Tabitha both decide to resume their own, separate lives, making their marriage an open relationship, so the effect this has on them is minimal.
-   An episode of _Jimmy Two-Shoes_ has Lucius arranging for Beezy to marry the Weavil Princess in order to get a large amount of treasure from them (which they were willing to sacrifice in order to get rid of her).
-   _The Simpsons_:

After sufficient hilarity ensues, the ruse is discovered and the wedding goes forward over Apu's objections. However, his bride Manjula turns out to be a good match for him, and they remained happily married... until they had _octuplets_. Their marriage pretty much derailed from there.

    -   One that actually worked out was between Princess Aisha and Nabu. The circumstances are similar to that in the _Sleeping Beauty_ example: When Aisha sees Nabu for the first time, she doesn't know it's him, and he doesn't tell her that he is either. Both were hostile to the idea, but they fell in love anyway. After their parents call off their wedding, Nabu proposed to Aisha, who accepted. Only to get _Killed Off for Real_.
    -   In _Magical Adventure_ when Sky seemingly breaks off his wedding with Bloom just after proposing to her, Oritel tries to set Bloom up with several other guys (including but not limited to the nerdiest character in the show, an Elvis Impersonator and a supposed Specialist who managed to cut his own hair and pants while showing his prowess with the sword), but Bloom manages to blow them all off.
-   On _The Proud Family,_ Penny had a budding romance with a Chinese-American boy, only to discover that his parents had arranged for him to marry some girl whom he'd never met. The boy thinks it's no big deal since they wouldn't get married for years anyway, but Penny refuses to be "the other woman." The issue is resolved when the boy meets his fiancée; the two immediately hate each other so much that the whole thing gets called off.

    Real Life 

-   There's a reason that royalty is often involved in Arranged Marriage plotlines: For Western historical examples, you need only read up on European royal houses from the last few centuries. Such tight inbreeding often resulted in diseases like schizophrenia becoming commonplace in such families, not to mention the horror that was known as the Hapsburg Chin.
    -   It's also the reason infidelity was so tolerated among men. You had to marry the princess to pump out the required legitimate heirs. What you did outside of business hours wasn't your wife's concern. On the other hand, any woman, even one with no enemies, could find herself on the wrong side of an executioner's axe (or could doom her lover to that fate) by having an affair - in some cases, even a merely emotional affair. The logic behind that Double Standard is simple to understand: if the woman had an affair, there could easily be an illegitimate heir, which could have caused problems in theory. In reality, though, an illegitimate heir was often the healthiest thing the queen could provide her husband, and often there was no way to know.
-   Arranged marriages were fairly common right up to the 20th century in many western countries and still fairly common in African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries even today. As much as 90% of Indian marriages are still arranged. Expect societal disapproval if you choose your spouse yourself.
    -   If you're rich, then you'll probably be under the most pressure to marry well. A rich person wanting to marry someone poor or even relatively poor would face tremendous amounts of resistance from family. This is true of Indians, but it's also an age-old story that you see across many cultures and time periods, including present-day white Americans. And it may well be true that 90% of Indian marriages are arranged, but that doesn't mean they're all _forced_. Many arranged marriages are consenting relationships. They're just done for more practical reasons than love because it's expected that you can grow to love just about anyone, so you may as well pick someone suitable and reliable.
    -   It has been described as a process by which parents vet the prospects and make a shortlist and leave the final choice to the child. This general practice is common in India across religious and caste lines, and is also common throughout the Muslim World and in parts of East Asia (where similar practices fall under the broader categories of _xiangqin_ in China and _omiai_ in Japan).
-   Among certain segments of society, they're still common even in Western countries. For example, Orthodox Jewish couples still largely meet via the services of a matchmaker, though websites such as Saw You At Sinai are trying to streamline the process. However, only the most conservative Hasidic families still practice the most extreme version of this trope; most will meet via a matchmaker but date for a month or two before deciding whether or not to marry. The combination of formality and desire to marry someone "compatible" has resulted in the infamous "shidduch problem" amongst Western Orthodox families whereby many singles remain single out of the inability to really find someone they connect to using this system.
-   For members of the Unification Church, "Moonies," all marriages amongst the flock are arranged by Reverend Moon himself (or _were_, until his death in 2012) or the couples' parents.
-   Some very conservative Christian groups practice "betrothal," meaning that they believe fathers have the authority to determine whom their adult children marry via Arranged Marriage or Parental Marriage Veto.
-   It's also pretty common for good friends who have opposite gender children to refer to them as a future husband and wife, although they're usually joking.
-   Arranged Marriage: Roman style is described by Pliny in one of his letters. He's been asked to look for a suitable husband for a friend's daughter and lists his candidate's qualifications in this order: family background; personal character; career prospects, appearance, and finally fortune which is probably placed last out of piety rather than its real importance. The physical description, interestingly, is clearly included for the girl's benefit.
-   Arranged Marriages are still practiced in South Korea as well, though they are becoming increasingly rare. Matchmakers and parents are usually very careful, though. They will scrutinize and vet a potential suitor for a period (a few weeks to a few years) before allowing the marriage to happen, allowing the couple to date and get to know each other during that period. That way they avoid most of the issues that could happen in arranged marriages of other cultures. Marrying for money is also discouraged.
