**Valentina:** Tony, wake up. I know you love Riff, but he hates Puerto Ricans. That ain't you.  
**Tony:** _\[dismissingly\]_ Riff doesn't hate _you._  
**Valentina:** I married a gringo. He thinks that makes me a gringa. Which it don't. And I ain't.  
**Tony:** Well, when it comes to guys like Riff and me, when things ain't _familiar_, we just get this instinct to, you know... _\[punches his palm\]_

A character who is well-liked or respected by bigoted individuals or institutions despite belonging to whatever group that's being discriminated against. Perhaps they had a friendship that predated whatever turned the bigots into bigots, perhaps there was a Fire Forged Friendship, perhaps they make the top guy laugh and no one crosses the top guy, perhaps they are so good they are worth making an exception for, perhaps they're just Token Minority cases for the others to point to as evidence that they're not really bigots at all. Whatever the case, it's obvious they are an exception.

Compare and contrast You Are a Credit to Your Race, If It's You, It's Okay, and Some of My Best Friends Are X, the former generally being an attempt at a well-meaning statement just layered with plenty of unfortunate subtext, while the latter involves the trope invoker being in denial about their bigotry. If the bigotry in question is misogyny, this can overlap with Not Like Other Girls.

Super-Trope to Bigot with a Crush.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Downplayed in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_. Shirogane managed to get elected Student Council President twice despite the fact that most of the student body normally looks down on "impures" like him. Despite his popularity, his commoner background was mentioned to be an issue when he was running for reelection.
-   _One Piece_: While never reaching the point of attraction, Arlong takes an uncharacteristically friendly attitude towards Nami, perhaps a byproduct of having her around for almost a decade. This in spite of his pathological disgust for humans like Nami and their supposed "weakness".

    Comic Strips 

-   In the regular _Viz_ strip "Mrs. Brady, Old Lady", there is a Running Gag in which Mrs. Brady will express extreme racism, and then, shortly afterwards, fulsomely praise her GP, the never-seen "Dr. Chakraborty".

    Fan Works 

-   _Bequeathed from Pale Estates_:
    -   Oberyn and the other Dornish contingent understandably despise the Lannisters. Most of them exempt Gwyn due to her age and good nature. Oberyn comes to terms with his distrust of her after much Character Development and seeing Gwyn risk her life on Lyarra's behalf.
    -   Keavan Forrestor hates all Ironborn for raiding, raping and killing his people, except Theon.
-   In _Codex Equus_, the Changelings of the Autumn Court are generally looked down upon by the Royal Changelings of both Spring and Summer Courts for "rejecting" their love, leadership, and protection, as well as undermining their royal legitimacy by simply existing. The only exception is Hive Thorax, led by the newly-Ascendant King/High-Prince Thorax - no one knew which court Thorax and his purified Changeling subjects would belong to, so they unofficially deemed them "Autumn" until they could figure it out. What also helps is that Thorax and his peers are the only ones who managed to break their racial Curse on themselves, which is considered to be impossible.
-   _Crimson and Emerald_: Endeavor is really misogynistic and sees women as subordinate and over emotional. Despite this, he was very good friends with Midoriya Inko and Hatsume Tomoko during his high school years and early career. However his misogyny also terminated his friendship when Inko and Tomoko had issue on how he treated his wife. Endeavor didn't understand why they would have a problem with him abusing his wife, it wasn't like he's treating _them_ like that.
-   _LearningToFly_: Wan Shi Tong loathes humans since a firebender trashed his library after using the knowledge he gained for it to worsen the ongoing world war, but he softens towards Zuko when the boy comes to him genuinely seeking enlightenement from the past and swearing to help restore the library.
-   In _Memories Like Ghost Stories_, Shen Qingqiu Does Not Like Men to the point he cannot even stand being in the same room than another male, courtesy of his former master's attempt to sexually abusing him. However, he allows Liu Qingge to touch him and enter in his bedroom, as the War God tried to defend him from his former master in a Pensieve Flashback.
-   Due to her Dark and Troubled Past involving the Galra, Allura in _The Princess and the Paladin_ has little trouble viewing all of them as Always Chaotic Evil. This view hardly changes when she finds out Keith (her boyfriend) is half Galra, assuring him that he's nothing like the rest. This only leads to a fight between the two until Allura realizes just how prejudiced she was being and resolves to change.
-   While Starscream utterly loathes humans in _Code Prime_, Schneizel is the _only_ human he has nothing negative to say about, and treats with respect.
-   _This Bites!_: Fishmen Chew and Kuroobi despises humans due to the suffering and enslavement the latter race has done to the former, though they make an exception to Koala since she was enslaved by the Celestial Dragons like many fishmen and traveled with them back when they were on Fisher Tiger's crew, and thus would sympathize with their plight. It's deconstructed, as Cross points out that by making an exception for her, they not only open the floodgate for other humans but the rules get reflected back on themselves. In any case, Koala is furious at the two for the crimes they committed on the humans in Conomi under Arlong's orders, regarding them with disdain when they meet up years later.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _West Side Story (2021)_: As in the original stage musical, the Jets are bigoted towards New York's Puerto Rican community. The exception to this is 90 year old Canon Foreigner Valentina, Doc's widow who has been a part of their community since before they were born and still runs the local drug store following her husband's death. Valentina herself is uncomfortable with this, reminding Tony that she's still Puerto Rican even though she was married to a white man.
-   _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_. Eddie Valiant may hate toons in general due to his Freudian Excuse, but he is very cordial to Betty Boop despite this. It's implied this stems from the two being friends who go back quite a bit, possibly from before said Freudian Excuse soured him towards toons.

    Literature 

-   In the Imperial era, Star Wars Legends Grand Admiral Thrawn, first appearing in _The Thrawn Trilogy_, is a Chiss in a military that disdains anybody who isn't a human male. Emperor Palpatine was so impressed with Thrawn's sheer skill as a soldier and strategist that he made an exception to the Empire's High Human Culture ideal for him.
-   _Gone with the Wind_'s Archie dislikes women, except for town sweetheart Melanie Wilkes. To the point that when someone insults her husband, he's ready to kill the man out of respect for _her_ rather than him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Detective Roger Gaffney from _Homicide: Life on the Street_ is an incompetent, racist slob who flat-out calls Pembleton "boy" at one point.

-   _Law & Order_:
    -   A suspect in "Homesick" was a deliveryman who worked at an upscale grocery store. He ended up being fired for slipping a racist note about Black people into one of the cereal boxes, which a Black family who shopped at the store happened to find.

    -   "Angel" has a shopkeeper who was bigoted towards Puerto Ricans not act too surprised that one was a suspect in the abduction of a little girl. He even said (in front of Curtis, no less) that he hoped they gained their independence from the states and said the only one worth respect was baseball great Roberto Clemente (which possibly makes his insult cut even deeper due to both openly offending a fellow Latino but by saying the only one worth their salt is _dead_.)
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In "He's Alive", Peter Vollmer is a committed neo-Nazi but the only thing in the world that he loves is Ernst Ganz, a survivor of The Holocaust. He even says that Ernst is like a father to him. However, after Ernst disrupts a public meeting and puts the growth of his organization at risk, Peter murders him at the urging of his Mysterious Benefactor, who turns out to be Adolf Hitler.

    Music 

-   The music video for the humorous song "Marly-Gomont" by French rapper of Congolese descent Kamini includes a racist villager from the eponymous place where Kamini grew up. He tells Kamini "I don't like blacks, I don't like Arabs, but I like you, even if you're black".

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Necromunda_: While the citizens of House Cawdor have a religious hatred of anything that deviates from the human norm, the Big Guy, Little Guy mutants that make up the 3rd Edition Stig-Shambler House Brutes are tolerated despite their deformities. Why such mutants are given a measure of acceptance is a mystery to some outside the House but it is simply because the Undying Loyalty of the Cawdor population causes them to accept anything their leaders decree, and the Cawdor nobles have decreed the Stig-Shamblers to be useful to their cause.

    Theater

    **Policeman:** _\[laughs\]_ That's what I like about you, Tevye. Always joking. _\[goes on for a bit, then stops laughing as he realizes Tevye meant it\]_
    

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Boondocks_ episode "The Story of Jimmy Rebel", a racist white country singer named Jimmy Rebel befriends a black guy named Uncle Ruckus, though this is because Ruckus hates black people as well. Jimmy decides that Ruckus is one exception for his hatred of black people, and even performs a song for Ruckus titled, "One Good Nigger". In the ending, Jimmy admits that he doesn't really hate black people that much anymore... though he's still very racist against Hispanics.

-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_: While most of Mewni are rather racist towards monsters, they have no problem with the non-mewman royal families of other kingdoms, such as the Ponyhead and Lucitor dynasties, who have been allies of the royal Butterfly family since Queen Solaria's reign, after her older brother, Jushtin, sealed alliances with them.

As they try to make their way back, they run into a small child named Hazel who agrees to join the Apex. Grace happily educates her about the cult only to discover that she's a Null. By then, she's developed such an affection for Hazel that she says it's ok and that she can join the Apex anyway.
