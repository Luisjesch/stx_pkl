A Last Request where the "MacGuffin" in I'm Dying, Please Take My MacGuffin happens to be human. Someone dying asks someone to please take care of their kids/family. Often implies a strong level of trust and respect between the two parties.

Precedes Children Raise You, Promotion to Parent, and Parental Substitute. Often an Ending Trope but not always. It also works well simply at the end of a Story Arc or in a Back Story.

## As this is a Death Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Ao no Fuuin_ Takao entrusts the entire Kimon family to Soko just before he dies by Akira's hands.
-   In _Ashita no Nadja_, this trope is why Rita Rossi, Cream and Chocolate are members of the Dandelion Troupe. Rita's parents owned another circus, which burned down one night; before they tried to save the rest of their animals, they went up to the Troupe, handed them little Rita and the baby lions, and asked them to take care of the little girl and the cubs. Few minutes after this, the circus tent collapsed and the Rossis died, so the Troupe fulfilled the Rossis' Last Request and took the three in as a part of the crew.
-   In _Assassination Classroom_, Aguri Yukimura's last request to Koro-sensei before dying is for him to devote the last year of his life to taking care of her students. Despite his insistence that he could never care for someone else as much as he does her, in his year as Class 3-E's teacher he grows to genuinely love his students.
-   _Buddy Daddies_: Miri's mother, Misaki, entrusts Kazuki to take care of her daughter as she slowly dies in his arms after being shot by one of the assassins hired by Kazuki's boss.
-   Subverted in _Full Metal Panic!_ when Sousuke's mother hands him off to Kalinin to raise... who then sends him off (albeit inadvertently) to the _KGB_. To be trained as a child assassin.
-   A flashback towards the end of _Fruits Basket_ reveals that this was the intent of Kyoko Honda's last words to Kyo Sohma. Upon seeing the now-teenage boy she'd befriended when he was a child, she attempted to remind him of the promise he'd made to her as a child to look after her daughter, Tohru. Unfortunately, because of her injuries, her words didn't all come out, causing Kyo to mistake her words for a Dying Declaration of Hate for his failure to save her. This causes trouble for his relationship with Tohru later on, but he keeps the promise nevertheless.
-   As revealed in a flashback, this was the dying request of Roy's alchemy teacher/Riza's father in _Fullmetal Alchemist._ Granted, "take care of my daughter" _probably_ didn't mean "make her your personal assistant and bodyguard," but hey, the woman is damn good at what she does.
-   Played With in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood_. It ends with Dio massacring Jonathan and everyone else on a ship, leaving Erina and a baby girl as the Sole Survivors. Erina wanted to stay and die with Jonathan, but he noted how the baby's mother died protecting her, and urged Erina to take the child and escape. The episode/storyline ends with Erina floating with the baby alone in the wreckage, with the narrator informing us that Erina was pregnant herself. The baby girl, Lisa Lisa, was raised by their companion Straizo, marries Erina's son George, and becomes the mother of the next protagonist, Joseph Joestar.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   Linith's last words before fading away was asking Bardiche to look after Fate and Arf.
    -   In _StrikerS_, one of the dying Zest's last requests to Signum was for her to take care of his charges.
-   In _Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit,_ this is both the main plot and back story: when the Second Queen of Yogo suspects that her husband is trying to kill their son Chagum, she tasks Balsa, a warrior-woman who happened to stop the most recent assassination attempt, to run away with him and keep him safe. As the series progresses, we learn that Balsa herself was once the "kid" in this trope, being taken in by a warrior named Jigoro on her dying father's request. A Whole Episode Flashback later fills in the details.
-   In _Noir_, in a Flash Back, Mireille Bouquet's mother's request to a five-year-old Kirika, who just killed Mireille's father and is about to kill her, is to take care of Mireille.
-   In _One Piece_, Gol D. Roger allowed himself to be captured by the Marines since he was dying of a terminal illness and wanted to go out in a more spectacular fashion. The night before his execution he confided in Monkey D. Garp, his most persistent foe among the Marines, that he had a pregnant lover. He told Garp that due to their frequent battles against each other, he knew and trusted Garp as well as he did any of his crew. He thus knew he could trust Garp to take care of his unborn child. And Garp does.
-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_: During the Scrambled Eggs arc, Fuutarou tries to get the Nakanos' grandfather to teach him how to tell them apart. Eventually, the old man seems to jugde Fuutarou is trustworthy enough and asks him to take care of his granddaughters, since he's ill and doesn't have much time to live.
-   Aiolos Sagittarius in _Saint Seiya_ gave the baby Saori to Mitsumasa Kido. She wasn't his kid, though; he was trying to protect her from the evil Pope, who wanted to kill her because she was Athena's reincarnation, and got killed in the effort.
-   Rem's famous last words in _Trigun_ are for Vash to take care of Knives. She probably didn't envision Knives to be the one who killed all her crew and tried to crash all the Seeds ships or that he would turn into a complete homicidal maniac but what can you do.
    -   On the other hand, maybe she did - in Japanese, her last words are "Vash, Knives wo..." "Wo" is an _incredibly_ ambiguous word on its own, requiring other words to define it. She could be asking him anything from "Help Knives" to "Kill Knives". "Vash, take care of Knives" is an attempt to capture that ambiguity in English ("Take care of him" often meaning "Kill him").
-   Part of Crow's Back Story in _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_: His father figure Robert Pearson, while trapped in a burning building, told Crow to escape, take his bike and deck, and watch over the rest of the kids he'd taken in.
    -   After their Duel, a dying Bommer asked Crow to look after his younger siblings before crumbling to dust. However Crow didn't have to since Bommer was resurrected at the end of that story arc.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_. Triela is something of a Team Mom to the cyborg girls. When she's wounded (eventually fatally) during the Turin attack, she tells Rico to look after the others.

She knows that she might not be coming back from the trip, so she pleads with him to go to Starkhaven at the first opportunity, collect her sister Bethany, and take her home to Kirkwall and look after her. It's a variant because Bethany is around thirty years old at this point; however, she's also the only family Hawke has left. Hawke also knows that she and Bethany are pretty much all Varric has left too, and the request is implied to be as much for his benefit as for either of theirs.

Mary was implied to have been widowed by that point, and in ancient Judean culture would have needed a grown son for financial support. (Whether or not she had others is open for debate.)  
    This may even be a twofer, as the disciple in question (John) was likely the Tagalong Kid among the Twelve (apart from being "significantly younger" than his brother James, it's unclear just _how_ old John was at the point where he Jumped at the Call), "whom he loved" might mean Happily Adopted, and Jesus also instructs _Mary_ to take care of _John_ as if he were her son.

Frollo wasn't keen on the idea, as the baby was ugly and deformed; but when Jehan unceremoniously dies of his illness, Frollo believes that raising Quasimodo is the only righteous thing to do.

She's killed (along with pretty much every other volunteer, but they're not plot relevant) and she says this just before falling to her death. Since she didn't tell him who her son is, Snow has no idea who to protect and decides to protect all the children that were to be taken on The Purge. Meanwhile, Hope witnesses this and blames him for it, follows him, and ends up as a party member. The in-game synopsis notes that in a way, Snow manages to fulfill her request to protect her son by providing Hope with a target and thus a reason to persevere despite the odds.
-   In _The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve_, Klint van Zieks's last request to Genshin Asogi was to take care of his unborn child.

Ull, who can't bring himself to take his baby with him, instead asks Takkar to adopt both his children into the Wenja tribe to make sure they don't die of "skull fire", like all the grown-up Udam have been. Takkar grants Ull's last request.
-   _Tales of..._
    -   _Tales of Xillia 2_: If you refuse to let go of Fractured Milla when she is being sucked into the summoning portal, and her Relationship Values with Ludger are high enough, then she tells Ludger to let her go so he can save Elle. If Ludger continues to hold on, she lets go herself and her last words plead to him to take care of Elle.
    -   _Tales of Berseria_: Shortly before the final battle, Velvet asks Eleanor to look after Laphicet if something should happen to her. Part of this is because they're going up against a god so survival is unlikely, but Velvet has also begun to suspect that her life is tied to the Big Bad, so if he dies she might too. Velvet ends up sealing him in a duel, while Laphicet becomes a god and takes his place. Eleanor decides the best way to fulfill her promise to Velvet is to turn the Abbey into a force of good that will support their new god.

    -   In _Dragon Age II_, Hawke's father has died prior to the events of the game, and it's heavily implied that he imparted such an injunction to his eldest child regarding their mother and younger siblings. Hawke certainly spends most of the game _trying_ to do exactly that, but given that Hawke is something of a Doom Magnet, it doesn't go well.
        -   Inverted if Bethany dies in the Deep Roads. She contracts the Blight and Hawke is forced to kill their only surviving sibling, rather than leave the girl to a horrible and drawn-out death. Bethany's parting words to Hawke are to say, "It's just you now. Take care of Mother."
    -   A variant appears in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, but only if Hawke survives the events of the quest "Here Lies the Abyss." They volunteer to travel to Weisshaupt, to bring news of the events to the First Warden, and before leaving ask the Inquisitor to "take care of Varric for me." Varric is Hawke's best friend - and roughly forty years old at the time - but as far as Hawke is concerned he's family, so it counts.
-   In _Grand Theft Auto IV_, Gerald McReary tells the main protagonist Niko Bellic to watch over his family just before he gets arrested. Depending on Niko's choices, he can fail Gerald with his brothers Derrick and Kate dying on his watch.
-   A flashback scene in _13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim_ shows this happening with Megumi's father, Nozomu. Specifically, he was an astronaut who became infected with a virus while working on the Ark Project. He was refused re-entry to the colony ship, but because the eight-year-old Megumi wasn't infected, Nozomu asks Juro to watch over her in his stead.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Arcane_, Vander is fatally wounded by an explosion and asks Vi to look after Powder before dying. However, Vi immediately learns Powder was indirectly responsible for Vander's death and by extension, Mylo's and Claggor's. In a rage, Vi assaults Powder and walks away from her, which led to her getting captured and Powder being taken in by Silco.
-   _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_: The original Black Canary's final speech exhorts Wildcat and the Justice Society to take care of her "little angel," (who then grows up to be the next Black Canary). They train her, but also tend to act overprotective of her even when she's an adult.
-   _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_: In "A Mine is a Terrible Thing to Waste", the team begins swapping backstories while trying to get out of the old mine Plunder used to imprison them. When it's Ma-Ti's turn, he talks about his parents participating in a protest against clear-cutting the Amazon. Ma-Ti's parents insisted that he stay with his grandfather because the upcoming confrontation with the clear-cutting advocates could be dangerous. Given that the flashback shows that his parents began crying once he was out of sight, it's clear that they knew they would probably die and were making sure their son had a home.
-   _Darkwing Duck_:
    -   Inverted in the episode "Toys Czar Us". Launchpad tells Darkwing that if something were to happen to him, he'd raise Gosalyn like she was his own daughter.
    -   In the episode "Dead Duck", Darkwing tells Launchpad to "take care of Gosalyn" as he says a final goodbye (which didn't turn out to be so final).
-   _Defenders of the Earth_: When Kshin's grandfather, Hai, is fatally injured towards the end of "The Adoption of Kshin", he asks Mandrake to look after Kshin. Inverted; Mandrake has been a father figure to Kshin since they met on the streets of Singapore seven years earlier, whereas Hai has only recently re-entered Kshin's life.
-   _Gargoyles_: Right before allowing the Magus to put him under the same indefinite sleep spell as the rest of his clan, Goliath asks the Magus and Princess Catherine to protect his clan's eggs. They do.
-   Implied in the _Galaxy Rangers_ episode "Psychocrypt" when Zach decides to make his suicide run. He asks his home AI to "take care of everything." Gee-Vee doesn't quite get it, but the audience does.
-   An inversion takes place in _Steven Universe_. In "Lion 3: Straight to Video", Rose Quartz ends her video message to Steven by telling him to take care of "them", "them" being the people she will leave behind with her sacrifice to bring Steven into existence.
-   _Samurai Jack_: After robot assassin X9 is killed by Jack, he asks Jack to take care of his dog Lulu (who was kidnapped by Aku to threaten X9 out of retirement) before shutting down. Even Jack looks down somewhat sympathetically at the robot before walking away.
-   _Final Space_: In Episode 6, Avocato is eventually forced to sacrifice himself to save his son and friends from a bomb. His last words to Gary are:
    
    **Avocato**: Take care of my boy.
    
-   _The Dragon Prince_: A few of Harrow's last words to his stepson, Callum, are "take care of your brother for me".

    Real Life 

-   After being shot by Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, considered the spark that started World War I, Archduke Franz Ferdinand's last words were (to his wife) "Sophie, Sophie! Don't die! Live for our children!" Tragically, Sophie was already unconscious and near death at this point, if not dead already; her final words had been "For God's sake, what has happened to you?!" The children (Sophie, Maximilian, and Ernst) were deported after their kingdom was destroyed and spent some time at the Dachau concentration camp. Eventually, they would receive their family's castle back.
-   During The Holocaust, many Jewish parents turned their children over to Christian orphanages, secret helpers, or even just other Jews who had a better chance of escape for one reason or another.
-   The Blitz Evacuees: Many parents in London put their children on trains to more remote parts of the country during the German Blitz in World War II so that they could escape the frequent bombings in the city. The parents who didn't have relatives to send their children to had no way of knowing if they would ever see them again; they had to trust that the distant strangers who were opening their homes would take good care of them.
-   For a more recent example, there were the events of September 11, 2001. As many parents trapped in the doomed towers and on the planes could contact their spouse/loved ones with cellphones, they often made this their dying request.
