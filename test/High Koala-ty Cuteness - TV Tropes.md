Now he's a koala and he's cute as a button.

Koalas are so widdle and cute. I mean, just look at that fuzzy-wuzzy thing. It looks exactly like a teddy bear! Don't you just want to smother it?

This is how koalas are seen by most people. Their big heads, big eyes, stubby little bodies, and fuzziness makes them so cute, you could even experience a Cuteness Overload. They're known to be lazy, which makes it even more adorable when they are shown sleeping. Perhaps because of this, a handful of fictional koalas subvert this trope, appearing cute and cuddly at first sight but revealing a mean, grouchy personality.

Finally, for some information, despite looking cute, koalas are still wild animals. Though not particularly dangerous, if they feel threatened by a human, they can chase them up to a long distance and then bite and scratch them with the help of long sharp front teeth and sharp claws. They also are known to carry diseases, especially chlamydia. Even if koalas look cute, you're better off giving them their space and just admiring them from a distance.

The perception of koalas as cute is specifically a modern western idea. To the indigenous peoples of Australia, koalas have a much more varied role in their oral traditions, from fertility figures (Bidjara) to something more in line with their actual behaviour as lazy and aggressive (Tharawal).

Sub-Trope of Animal Stereotype and Ridiculously Cute Critter. Compare Cute Kitten, Precious Puppy, and Bunnies for Cuteness for other cute animals. Contrast Drop Bears, which are killer koalas that are often subject to tall tales. See also Laid-Back Koala for another koala stereotype, and Boxing Kangaroo, Kangaroos Represent Australia, Puzzling Platypus, and Volatile Tasmanian Devil for other stereotypes applying to Australian wildlife in general.

## This is not a list of all koalas in fiction. This refers to koalas that are specifically portrayed as cute or otherwise that play with the idea of them being cute.

    Films — Animation 

-   Subverted with Pretty Boy from _Back to the Outback_. He is a zoo koala who is universally beloved by the public due to his cuteness, but he is a pretty big jerk once you get to know him.
-   _The Wild_: Nigel is known to be "cute and cuddly" by the public, though he doesn't like being known by this. He is really grouchy, though, despite this, he's pretty good friends with most of the main cast.

    Literature 

-   Jamie from _Dear Dumb Diary_ absolutely loves koalas because they're so cute. It's a Running Gag throughout the series that she'll find a way to bring up koalas in practically any situation, especially when trying to aesthetically improve a situation or set some kind of standard for cuteness.
-   _Spellsinger_: In _Paths of the Perambulator_, averted by Colin. Jon Tom looks at him and immediately notices that despite his inherent cuteness, he's well-armed and carries himself like someone who knows how to fight. Jon Tom makes a point of not underestimating him after that.

    Music

    Video Games 

-   The _Animal Crossing_ series features koalas as one of the original species of villager. By default, _all_ of them have the potential to fit the criteria with the series' cuddly art style, their potentially lovable personalities and the possibility of befriending any of them, but among the most conventionally Moe of them in design would likely be Melba<small>◊</small>, Ozzie<small>◊</small>, Lyman<small>◊</small>, Faith<small>◊</small>, and _Huggy<small>◊</small>_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ introduces Komala, a small, cute koala Pokémon that is always asleep and walks around on the log it's attached to.
-   Many of the friendly NPCs in the _Ty the Tasmanian Tiger_ series are cutesy-looking koalas with Black Bead Eyes. The third game averts it with the Drop Bears, though, which are large, muscular koalas that drop on Ty from trees with monstrous roars and pound on his head until he shakes them off.
-   _Yo-kai Watch 3_ has Koalanyan, who is part of the Charming tribe and his medallium entry points out his cute, large nose.

-   The _Zork_ universe has the minx, which is described as "an irresistibly cuddly animal which shares all the most ingratiating characteristics of kittens, koala bears, and piglets."

    **Flame King:** _(beat)_ I don't like koalas anymore...
    
-   Reginald the koala from _American Dad!_. In his first appearance, he even had a theme song and a montage dedicated to his cuteness. The fact that he's a secret agent who works for the CIA probably makes him even more adorable.
-   _The Kwicky Koala Show_ features the titular marsupial being depicted as innocent, albeit using his surprising speed (setting him from other Koalas) to escape Wilfred Wolf.
-   _Mofli The Last Koala_ is a Spanish animated series about a koala who is the Last of His Kind and the best friend of a little girl named Corina who protects him from Evil Poachers.
