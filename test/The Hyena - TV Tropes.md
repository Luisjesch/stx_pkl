**Michael:** What's so fucking funny?  
**Harold:** Life. Life's a goddamn laugh riot.

A character for whom every thing is funny, and everything is worth a laugh. They see the funny side of everything, and you can expect this character to laugh regardless of whether he just got hit with a pie or missiles are raining down from above. They'll laugh through sun, rain, sleet and snow, and they usually do it so much that it becomes a sort of Signature Laugh for them.

For villains, this often overlaps with an Evil Laugh, and, in fact, this trope is more associated with madness rather than heroes or neutral characters, and this often crosses with Comedic Sociopathy. A Giggling Villain has laughter as a defining characteristic.

A good Boisterous Bruiser does a lot of laughing, just because they LIVE LARGE!

Do not confuse with Lena Hyena. Compare The Pollyanna, who is always happy, and Perpetual Smiler, who is always smiling. The opposites are Prone to Tears, who is easily brought to tears, Perpetual Frowner and The Stoic, who never laugh and smile at anything.

Incidentally, the inspiration for this trope name, spotted hyenas (_Crocuta crocuta_), aren't really laughing when they make their infamous vocalizations. It appears to be a form of communication used mostly when fighting for food or in social conflict. For actual hyenas portrayed in a negative light, see Heinous Hyena. Also, the Hyena is often the sole exception to a Tough Room.

    Advertising 

-   Orangina of course has a rather creepy hyena commercial.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Elmer from _Baccano!_ is always laughing or at least smiling, and spends his long life trying to make everyone else smile. He does this even when this would be completely inappropriate, such as just after the person has gone through a traumatic event, making it seem like there's something seriously wrong with him.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_: Pure Boo (or Kid Buu in the US) very rarely says a word, and most of the sounds he utters are either insane screeches or maniacal laughter.
-   Sakamoto from _Gintama_. He wasn't always like that though.
-   Waji in _Haré+Guu_, has a rather creepy hyena like laugh. Apparently he believes laughing makes your worries go away. He was even compared to a hyena once. Interestingly there are a few hints he has a troubled home life, like being found in the middle of the night in the jungle, crying to himself.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_: Tsuruya tends to burst into loud laughter at everything she finds even slightly humorous. Her first appearance in the show has her utterly fail to stay in character while making Haruhi's student film because she's laughing too hard. She spends the rest of the scene laughing hysterically while Kyon does snarky narration.
-   Clair Leonelli from _Heat Guy J_, and his maniacal laughter... which even sounds like a hyena!
-   Jan Valentine from _Hellsing_. Seriously, he sounds _utterly deranged_ in the dub.
-   Mikihisa Komaki of _Library War_ is almost always at least smiling or chuckling. When something's actually funny he has to really hold back to not completely crack up.
-   Kate Popple from _Lucy-May of the Southern Rainbow_ is a Bratty Half-Pint, and whenever you see her make her default Cat Smile (:}), you know she's up to no good. Being The Gadfly, she's this trope by default, but especially in the first episode - Mr. Pettywell, the Arch-Enemy of the Popple family (due to using his wealth to buy favours against them, knowing they're poor), orders his workers to construct a house, only for the foundation to fall all over him. Upon hearing Lucy-May and Kate laugh hysterically, Mr. Pettywell stares at them furiously, balls his fists and turns a deep shade of red as he steps towards them...only to bark at his construction workers to fix the damage or he'll take away their supper and payment. This just makes Lucy-May and Kate laugh even more.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Hamburg, the Dumb Muscle of the Foxy Pirates, laughs at literally everything that happens around him. While, admittedly, some of these things are actually funny (like how a giant crewmate of his can never hear what anyone else says because he's so tall), he does it at _every_ turn.
    -   Miss Valentine, who appears for a whole story arc as a main villain, but only has three or four lines that aren't laughter.
    -   While not prone to laughter as per the trope, Bellamy has "the Hyena" as his Red Baron.
    -   Not to mention Bellamy's boss, Donquixote Doflamingo. Dude never stops laughing smugly.
    -   Tom, Franky and Iceberg's adoptive father, was prone to laughing at everything. This occasionally got on their nerves when he did so in serious situations.
-   The One-Scene Wonder that was Ash's (temporary) Haunter in _Pokémon: The Original Series_. It thinks _everything_ is funny.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_: If it's not her familiars, Walpurgisnacht's presence is almost always hailed by her delirious laughter. Even while she's being blasted out of existence by Madoka.
-   The narrator in _Serial Experiments Lain_: "Present day, present time. HAHAHAHAhahahaha!!!
-   Kururu from _Sgt. Frog_ utters his famous "ku ku ku" laugh, even when everything is going to hell around him. It seems like his standard reaction to everything.
-   _Shakugan no Shana_: Margery Daw's Lord, Marchosias. Can overlap a lot with Evil Laugh as they are a pair of Blood Knights.
-   Kusukusu from _Shugo Chara!_. Her name even means "Tee-hee"
-   Patti from _Soul Eater_. _The Sun_ is also usually depicted as laughing.
-   Cyclonus from _Transformers: Armada_.
-   _Yuyushiki_: Yukari laughs at almost anything Yuzuko does, regardless how random it is.

    Comic Books 

-   One story in an American-made comic set in feudal Japan featured a samurai, the principal courier for "the Great Lord", whose ability to see the humor in just about **anything** had caused him to be known as Harada the Jokester. Given a message to carry that would've forced the death of the two main characters, to whom he'd taken a liking, he picked a fight with a band of assassins, so they'd kill him before he could pass on the message. As the assassins closed in on him, he was laughing loudly.
-   During the Amalgam Comics crossover event for Marvel and DC, the Darkclaw, a hybrid of Batman and Wolverine, fought the Hyena, a cross between Sabretooth and The Joker that was basically a shirtless Joker on 'roids and a healing factor.
-   Neal in _Blacksad_ is a hyena who laughs at Blacksad's jokes. However, when he's stuck in a car with a guy who tells racist jokes, his sense of humor takes a leave of absence.
    
    **Neal:** Ok, this guy was an asshole but still punching someone while he is driving is dangerous.  
    **Blacksad:** At least with his black eye he is even more colored now, no offense to him.  
    **Neal:** Hin hin hin hin!
    
-   The Joker, a quintessential Monster Clown, laughs at everything, especially death, destruction, and despair. Life is a joke to him, and all ironies are equally funny in his mind. He even known to laugh maniacally when he's the one on the receiving end. His mirth is so much that, when he stops laughing, it's a surefire sign that things are as bad as they can get. One of the few things he doesn't find funny is someone explaining the joke. In fact this is one of his Berserk Buttons.
    -   In _The Dark Knight_, Batman threw him off a building and he laughed hysterically on the way down.
        -   He also does this in the comics, in the arc "Lovers and Madmen", only rather than being thrown, he delibrately steps off, just to see if Batman will save him, despite having just gone on his very first rampage through Gotham City. This being, at the time, the official first encounter between the Joker and Batman, he survives, obviously. Not sure whether this example, or the Dark Knight, came first.
        -   He also does it in the video game, _Batman: Arkham Origins._ Apparently, he seems to think falling out of buildings is hysterical.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Princess Hyeenia of Skizofrenia seems to laugh at everything, to the point that even her own father, who is otherwise very supportive of her, will yell at her to stop laughing or get out.

    Comic Strips 

-   This was the trademark of "Laffy" Smith, one of the villains in the _Dick Tracy_ strip.

    Fan Works 

-   _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_: Outright lampshaded by the Lemony Narrator:
    
    _Have we ever discussed Socrates' laughter? He starts out laughing at whatever it was that amused him. Then he keeps laughing. It goes on and on, until finally he's just laughing at the fact that he's still laughing. The laughter stops whenever he passes out, or finally decides to calm down and try to catch his breath._
    
-   Quill in _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_ chuckles quite a lot, a trait which really begins to annoy George after a while.
-   In A.A. Pessimal's _Discworld_, zoologist Johanna Smith-Rhodes feels obliged to explain a few fine points to an Ankh-Morporkian audience concerning life on the Rimwards Howondalandian veldt.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  She patiently points out that animals do not think like us and any romantic notion of a Lion King reigning over his loyal and obedient subjects is utter anthropomorphic nonsense. From the point of view of a wildebeest, for instance, it might be hard to express fealty to a liege-lord who has just slain and devoured your young. And it's not as if there's a huddle of rebellious hyenas getting together on the edge of the veldt and plotting to overthrow the monarchy so as to usher in a glorious revolutionary Hyena Republic. _Animals do not think that way._

    Films — Animation 

-   The Headless Horseman in _The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad_ does nothing _but_ spew evil booming laughter while chasing Ichabod Crane.
-   The Ghost of Christmas Present in _A Christmas Carol (2009)_. His constant laughter quickly moves from jolly to unsettling and becomes downright scary as he continues to guffaw as his body ages into a skeleton and then crumbles to dust.
-   The crows in _Dumbo_ laugh a _lot_ at Timothy Mouse, especially when he brings up the concept of an elephant flying.
-   _The Incredibles_ has Jack-Jack, who is a cheerful child by default. He tends to giggle whenever he unleashes a new power or in response to the panic he tends to cause in others.
-   A literal hyena starts laughing hysterically in _Lady and the Tramp_ after seeing Lady nearly getting her head bitten off from trying to get an alligator to help her remove her muzzle. Tramp then says "Huh, if anybody ever needed a muzzle, it's him".
-   _The Lion King (1994)_ not only features literal hyenas, but they also fit the trope stereotype perfectly. But out of all, Ed (pictured above) really takes the cake, as his entire dialogue consists of obnoxious laughter, which only Shenzi and Banzai are able to understand. He’s quite possibly the most literal example of this trope ever. Goes straight into horror when the other hyenas ask him about his opinion of Scar calling them "friends" shortly after denouncing them to Simba, and his only reaction is a Evil Laugh and licking his lips just before they all maul and devour Scar.
-   _Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure_ has Sir Leonard Looney and the other citizens of Looney Land, who seem to find _everything_ uproariously funny. It's implied King Koo Koo's constantly-laughing courtiers were former victims of the king's tendency to constantly prank others and laugh at their misfortune, which seems rather karmic given how much their constant laughter annoys him.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Amadeus_ plays Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as an immature frat boy with a near-constant Annoying Laugh. This makes his absolute undeniable genius all the more infuriating to those around him.
-   The title character — a Fun Personified heavily-drinking Idle Rich millionaire — in 1981's _Arthur (1981)_ is heard cackling before he's even seen in the opening sequence. He laughs to punctuate his jokes, he laughs when he falls out of his car at the Plaza Hotel, he laughs _in his sleep_...
-   In _Bank Shot_, El has a disturbing habit of bursting into laughter, even when nothing funny has occurred. It takes Ballentine by surprise more than once.
-   The Detective from the Coen Brothers film _Blood Simple_
    -   As recounted in the behind-the-scenes features for _Fargo_, the Coen Brothers themselves have what Joel's wife Frances McDormand refers to as a "collective laugh" and that once you get one of them started the other is almost guaranteed to join in. She also expresses some dismay that their son seems to have picked it up.
-   Fidget in _Cecil B. Demented_ laughs (and fidgets) a lot, to the point of almost seeming like he's doing an impression of Dwight Frye.
-   As in his comic book version, the Joker from _The Dark Knight_ is this, possibly as a result of an unhealthy mix of Ax-Crazy and Too Kinky to Torture.
-   In the kung fu movie _The Fearless Hyena_, Jackie Chan develops a fighting style all about confusing his enemies through hysterical, uncomfortable laughter.
-   Hans's father, who howls with laughter all the way to the guillotine, in _Frankenstein Created Woman_.
-   Jocko in _Frankenstein Island_ guffaws loudly after everything he says, regardless of whether it was funny or not, and often bursts out laughing for no reason at all. Probably a result of Sanity Slippage.
-   In _Freaked_, the Man Behind the Man's dialogue over the telephone is nothing but Evil Laughter, which villain Elijah C. Skuggs can somehow understand just fine:
    
    **Skuggs:** "I—I'm sorry, can you spell that for me?"
    
    **Codename: Laughing Man:** "Ha. Hoo. Hee. Heh. Hah."
    
    **Skuggs:** "Okay, got it."
    
-   _The Great Race_: Prince Hoepnick (Jack Lemmon) is a cheerful fellow, loving the life he's living, constantly drunk, and punctuates nearly every sentence he says with a loud braying laugh. HaHAAAHhahaaa!
-   The Daffy mogwai/gremlin from _Gremlins 2: The New Batch_.
-   Uncle Albert in Disney's _Mary Poppins_. He even sings a song about it!
-   Dicko, one of the psycho pet food hunters in _Razorback_, has an incredibly annoying laugh and will burst into laughter for seemingly no reason at all.
-   Johnny laughs at all kinds of unfunny things in _The Room (2003)_. One particular example is a scene where Mark tells a story about a girl who _ended up in the hospital_ because one of her multiple boyfriends found out about her affairs. It's _fucking weird_. What he says is "What a story", implying the story might sound far-fetched to him.
-   _Star Wars: Return of the Jedi_: Salacious Crumb, Jabba's imp-like minion/pet, always giggles when his master does something sadistic.
-   _3 Ninjas:_ Ishikawa, The Dragon in _Kick Back,_ is prone to mean-spirited, braying laughs.
-   The weasels in _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_. Results in their demise. Judge Doom mentions that the weasels had some "idiot hyena cousins".

    Literature 

-   Marco from _Animorphs_.
-   _The Cat Who... Series_: Book 15 (_The Cat Who Went Into the Closet_) Celia Robinson, who has a loud, musical laugh and will crack up even at Qwilleran's mildest quips. In book 17 (_The Cat Who Blew the Whistle_), Qwilleran introduces to her the idea of "fine-tuning" her laugh.
-   _Discworld_
    -   Carcer from the novel _Night Watch_ is the Psycho for Hire version of this.

-   Though more just a part of her general weirdness, Luna Lovegood from _Harry Potter_ breaks into a huge shrieking fit of laughter from a small joke Ron made on their first meeting. Understandably, he thinks she is making fun of him.
-   _Live and Let Die_ has Tee Hee Johnson, who is noted for his tendency to chuckle and giggle to himself for little or no good reason.
-   The _Old Man's War_ novel _The Ghost Brigades_ gives us Sarah Pauling. While most of her fellow recruits have a huge problem with trying to grasp humor, she finds pretty much every joke hysterically funny. Eventually they figure out that she doesn't actually get the jokes, but she finds the fact that nobody else does either to be immensely funny.
-   Sejanus, attendant to the eponymous _The Queen's Thief_ novel _King of Attolia_, hates the man he works for and takes every opportunity to make him look like an idiot. He always laughs at the outcome, whether the joke lands on him or the king.
-   _Roys Bedoys_: Mr. Sprinkles laughs a lot for no apparent reason.
-   _Slapshots_: Cal Tonelli will go into hysterics over any joke, even if it’s lame and/or is making fun of Cal and his friends.

    -   Also, the kids possessed by the demon Hyenas in The Pack.
-   An episode of _Father Ted_ has a character who laughs so constantly he can never finish a sentence. We meet him recounting an anecdote to a travelling companion about himself and Ted (which turns out to simply be an unremarkable case of someone losing his slippers). Ted asks the companion how long their car journey was together, and the poor man tells him it was four hours with a look of shellshock on his face.
-   There is a recurring Michael McDonald character from _MADtv (1995)_ who laughs at everything especially if he thinks he's going to die.
-   Ashton in the North American _North and South_ series. Humiliated her rival? Laughs. Held at swordpoint by her own sister? Laughs. Surrounded by the smoldering remains of her burning lair, with her demented lover (supposedly) burning to death underneath? Laughs.
-   _Power Rangers_: Rita Repulsa. She lets loose an Evil Laugh in almost all her lines.
-   Johnathan Pearce from _Robot Wars_ has a tendency to break off into Hyena Cackles whenever he can, usually at the sight of destruction. Take from that what you will...
-   From 1968, a segment of _Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In_ presented Ruth Buzzi (as "Miss Snooky Lanson") performing "Holiday For Strings" laughing in tempo with the music.
-   The titular RuPaul of _RuPaul's Drag Race_, to the point that it's one of the show's eyecatches, and according to the contestants judge Michelle Visage's infamous cackle can be heard from anywhere backstage.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: Data remarks that the Holodeck audience for his comedy routine setting is _literally_ programmed to laugh at anything.
-   The '90s _The Untouchables_ series had some petty criminal who was laughing nervously, even as Capone's men beat him up. But that was more hysteria than humor.

    Music 

-   The titular character from the 1920s song "The Laughing Policeman" by Charles Penrose, a 'fat old policeman' who is 'never known to frown' and is the 'happiest man in town'. He is described as constantly laughing at everyone and everything, even on the beat and while arresting someone.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Willow The Wisp even laughs at his own pain, even when it hurts to laugh.
-   Jeckles The Jester is always laughing, by virtue of being a Court Jester. He can't even complete basic sentences sometimes because he can't stop himself from laughing.
-   The booker of Magnificent Championship Wrestling, who has booked you to fail, Nicky Martin, Ra Hah Hah!

    Puppet Shows 

-   Marc-Olivier Fogiel in the French satirical show _Les Guignols de l'Info_. Everything he says is pure jerkassery, and he frequently bursts on laughter after having humiliated someone. Bonus point for having an _actual hyena_ as a pet.
-   On _The Muppet Show_, Rowlf, Miss Piggy, and Janice would turn into this during the Veterinarian's Hospital sketches, laughing hysterically at a Hurricane of Puns.
-   Tim Curry's portrayal of Long John Silver in _Muppet Treasure Island_ is a creepy hyena. At first, his laughs seem to just be the jovial nature of a simple ship's cook. As his true colors start to shine through, it starts to feel more and more menacing each time he starts.
-   Harvey Kneeslapper from _Sesame Street_. The character was eventually dropped because the laugh was destroying Frank Oz's voice. Averted on at least one occasion, when one of his practical jokes backfired on him; his would-be victim ended up laughing at _him_, and he naturally failed to see the humor.
-   The Teletubbies. They just can't seem to stop laughing, from accidents or otherwise. Justified, since they're meant to be toddlers. The baby sun also laughs practically every time she's onscreen.
-   With respect to the Teletubbies, Tilly, Tom, and Tiny from _Tots TV_ and _Rosie & Jim_ also made by the same company also seem to laugh a lot.
-   The _Spitting Image_ special _Down and Out in the White House_ portrays Ed McMahon of _The Tonight Show_ this way. When Johnny Carson mentions that Sylvester Stallone is the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, McMahon bursts into his familiar "Ohohoho!" laugh.
    
    **Carson:** No, I'm serious. That wasn't a joke.  
    **McMahon:** Oh, there's a joke _too?_ Ohohoho! Medic! _(is carried off on a stretcher)_
    

    Radio 

-   Bob & Ray had a recurring character known as "Charles the Poet", who would start out by reading a piece of awful poetry with dead seriousness, but within a few lines would completely lose his composure and break out into helpless laughter. This would get him yanked from the air well before he could get through to the end of the poem.
-   _Car Talk_ hosts Tom and Ray Magliozzi are well known and frequently self-deprecating of their laughter, and listeners have written in to describe things like their laugh being used to draw flocks of sheep.
-   _The Ricky Gervais Show_: Ricky Gervais, usually whenever Karl Pilkington says something ridiculous.
-   As recounted on NPR's Marketplace, the laugh of Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos precedes him down the hall of the corporate headquarters and is well known to everyone who works there. It's also apparently considered a _punishment_ to some employees.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The _Orcs of Thar_ describe "Canis Erectus Hilaris", a Gnoll subspecies known to almost always giggle before attacking.
-   _Exalted_ gives us Adorjan, the Silent Wind, a Yozi who, when she speaks, only does so through laughter. This is partially because of a Charm she has (and her chosen can learn) which allows telepathic communication while forbidding the bearer from vocalizing anything other than laughter, and partially for other reasons.

    Theater 

-   In Shakespeare's _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, some interpretations Puck can certainly be described as such. Particularly in the 1930 version, where he was portrayed by a teenage Mickey Rooney.
-   In _Oklahoma_, Gertie Cummings' defining characteristic is her annoying giggle.

    Video Games 

-   This is the reason one undead minion in _AdventureQuest Worlds_ was given the name of Chuckles.

-   In _Coffee Talk_, Baileys is a minor example; his sprites frequently do a "laughing animation" during conversations, such as during his September 28th conversation with Freya. Lucas in Episode 2 also laughs often with the other patrons.
-   The Jester in _Darkest Dungeon_ laughs quite often, especially when he lands a critical hit. Goes right into Laughing Mad territory when he is under some afflictions.
    
    **Narrator:** He will be laughing still, at the end.
    
-   Trusty Patches\\Patches the Hyena from _Dark Souls_ laughs after every line of dialogue. It's probably because he finds the idea of kicking you down a pit to kill you and take your stuff really funny.
-   Xan from _DragonFable_. Half his lines are manic laughs.

-   Henry from _Fire Emblem: Awakening_. His Sorcerer class victory animations are of him laughing while the enemy dies, and one of his Critical Hit quotes is nothing but gleeful laughter.
-   _Granblue Fantasy_ has an involuntary version with Ludmila; due to eating a strange mushroom, she suffers from uncontrollable laughter.
-   Father Grigori from _Half-Life 2_, who's on your side but nevertheless clearly has a screw loose. Escalated further in _Concerned_, where he laughs about once per speech bubble.
-   The Collector in _Hollow Knight_ cackles through his entire boss fight, with particularly loud laughter when you defeat him.

-   The Jockey from _Left 4 Dead 2_ does literally nothing else but laugh. Out of all the Special Infected, the Jockey will probably become the one you want to kill the most, just to shut it the hell up.
-   In the town of Wimbich in _Zelda's Adventure_, there's a guy in a shop who seems to think that everything up to and including "lighting a shrine" is a laugh riot (6:15 through 7:30 of this Let's Play video).
-   Laughing Octopus of _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ is an Ax-Crazy example. Both of these traits are reactions to mind-raping trauma.
-   _Persona 4_'s Yukiko Amagi regularly has laughing fits that can last for several minutes. The one exception: even _she_ doesn't laugh at Teddie's jokes. (The funny-nose glasses, though, leave her helpless). Chie actually calls her a "Crazy Hyena" at one point. "Yukiko's Laughing Fits" is actually a _card_ in _Weiss Schwarz_.
-   Ringo Ando from _Puyo Puyo_ isn't usually this trope, but her alternate voice in _Puyo Puyo Chronicle_ has her in a constant giggling fit with each of her sound clips.
-   Another Ax-Crazy example is Aran Ryan from _Punch-Out!!_ Wii, who laughs even as you beat the crap out of him. The only thing he _won't_ laugh at is a Star Punch — those actually hurt him.

-   Reika Kirishima from _Time Gal_. No matter how dangerous the situation, she always finds something to laugh at. However, she does stop laughing when things get too dangerous. This only holds true for the Japanese version, however, as she's a lot less giggly in the US version.
-   Warp from _Toonstruck_ never stops laughing, even after one of his pranks backfires and blows his head off he still laughs.
-   _X-Men (1993)_: Mojo, the boss of the fifth stage, laughs constantly throughout his boss fight, especially when he gets hit anywhere but his Weak Point.

    Visual Novels 

-   Various characters in _Higurashi: When They Cry_. This is seldom a good thing.
-   Misha of _Katawa Shoujo_. Her signature "WAHAHA~!" is instantly recognizable by just about every player of the game.
-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_
    -   Laurence "Moe" Curls in _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All_. Bad for his career, as he's a clown, and nobody else finds his jokes funny.
    -   In _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_, Calisto Yew cracks up often, usually at the way Edgeworth talks. This lets you know Shih-na's true identity during her Villainous Breakdown in the final case, as she takes Laughing Mad and crosses it with Slasher Smile.
    -   When he reveals himself as the Big Bad of the second _Investigations_ game, Simon Keyes also enjoys a good laugh at Edgeworth's expense. Appropriately enough, he's dressed as a clown.
-   Chiester410 in _Umineko: When They Cry_ laughs in every scene. Even when things are going badly and her sisters are panicking, she isn't so surprised that she can't chuckle about it.

    Web Animation 

-   Nutty from _Happy Tree Friends_ due to his hyperactivity, he even laughs when he gets beat up or dying.
-   Volume 4 of _RWBY_ introduced Tyrian Callows, one of the Big Bad's Elite Four. A violent psychopath, Tyrian frequently flips between giggling and hysterical laughter whenever the thought or opportunity for violence presents itself to him.

    Webcomics 

-   _Bittersweet Candy Bowl_ has Rachel.
-   The Hyenas in _Foxy Flavored Cookie_ laugh a lot.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   Terezi Pyrope, befitting the only troll who's actually any good at trolling. She loves annoying everyone just a _little_ too much. Her sprite is also always drawn with an open mouth, showing off the fact that trolls have many more teeth than humans. Similarly, her lusus proves to be a much more lighthearted one when it's reincarnated as the Dragonsprite.
    -   Calsprite is an exaggerated version; his dialogue is literally an unending stream of annoying laughter, leading Dave to beg him to "please, just once, shut the hell up".

    Web Original 

-   Cheese, of the _Whateley Universe_. What would you expect from the child of supervillains, who has decided that a really good codename is _Cheese_? In the story "Bad Seeds", he really lets loose.

    Web Videos 

-   One of the defining traits of _ComedyShortsGamer_. According to some of his fans, his laugh can cure depression.
-   _Dream_ laughs at everything whenever he's playing with his friends (who aren't hunting him). See their X-ray challenge video for a good example.
-   Thanks to _Fails of the Weak_, Geoff Ramsey of Rooster Teeth and Achievement Hunter became known for this. And in the gang's Let's Plays videos, you can always count on everyone to break out into hysterical laughter at least once.
-   Bruce Greene of Funhaus laughs so hard, that most of it is just hysterical wheezing. Like Geoff, he occasionally has laughed so hard he'll fart.
-   There isn't much that the _Hobo Bros_ _don't_ find funny. They keep laughing throughout most of their videos, when they're not struggling with a hard game (and even sometimes when they _are_.) In one particular Hobo Theater video, Kevin kept laughing harder and harder until he started crying, and unashamedly admitted it.
-   _hololive_:
    -   Many of the talents are pretty free with their laughter, but of note is Ookami Mio who is pretty famous for her wheezing fits and the extreme ease of getting her there.
    -   Usada Pekora is very easy to get into laughing fits, some of which have lasted for minutes in the most severe cases.
-   In most videos on the _Hydraulic Press Channel_, cackling is often the only thing Anni, the wife of the channel's host, says during the whole video. She's often laughing at her husband's ridiculously deadpan commentary, his English pronunciation, or the results of the presses.
-   Jayuzumi is a variation. _He_ rarely laughs personally, since he uses a soundboard, but many people that get the joke will laugh their heads off.
-   When he's not furious, Michael Jones has a distinctive cackle that can be described as the personification of "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA", and Jack Pattillo has laughed so hard that he'll be reduced to hysterical wheezing or tears.
-   _Outside Xbox_: Ellen is an infamous laughter, and her co-host Luke is a master of deadpan comedy. Any appearance will usually end with Ellen in stitches.
-   Ethan "Behzinga" Payne of the Sidemen laughs so hard and so much that this trope is his defining trait; his logo for several years was even a stylized "Face with Tears of Joy" emoji (😂). Fellow Sideman KSI is not far behind him.
-   _UNHhhh_: Trixie Mattel frequently makes her co-host Katya break into wheezy, death-rattle, smoker laughter. There is a compilation.

-   The Yogscast has many examples:
    -   While Rythian is normally deadpan, there are two moments that really stand out. The first is during the Terminator minigame video — after Turpster has been mocking Duncan Jones' decision to use "Hohoho!" as a laugh, you can hear Rythian having a laughter fit in the background. The second is in a playthrough of _Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine_, when the group discover Sjin is playing as a Frenchwoman; Sjin decides to get into character.
    -   Strippin spends most of his _Deadpool_ playthrough laughing his backside off, and later almost breaks down crying from laughter while playing _DayZ_.
    -   While Sips normally has a deadpan demeanour, whenever he finds something funny enough he will stop laughing and find it difficult to stop, such as in his _Skyrim_ playthrough, when a dragon randomly swoops down, picks his horse up on its back, flies away and drops the steed to its death.
    -   Simon Lane finds it difficult to stop laughing at many points, such as in the _Jaffa Factory_ series, when he goes mad with power and starts hitting Lewis Brindley repeatedly while completely Laughing Mad! Later, during Series 2 of their _Trouble in Terrorist Town_ playthrough, he discovers the delight of jihad bombs and degenerates into helpless laughter upon successfully killing a large group of people with one.
    -   In part due to Drunk on the Dark Side, Turpster does a very long and maniacal Evil Laugh whenever he is the murderer in the Yogscast _Garry's Mod_ series.
    -   When Sips and Strippin are doing a _Saints Row IV_ playthrough, they absolutely lose it upon seeing some ridiculously designed characters appear.

    Western Animation 

-   Genie's Laughter from the _Aladdin: The Series_ episode "The Seven Faces Of Genie" according to him everything's a riot and will go into fits of laughter for often no reason, and he spoke in a British accent for some reason.

    **Joker:** That's not funny... that's not...
    
-   Uhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh, Beavis and Butt-Head like, never stop laughing, _ever_, uhuhuhuhuhuhuh. It's, like, a Verbal Tic or something, uhuhuhuhuh. So much that on those rare occasions when they _do_ stop laughing, it's either because something has just ticked them off or they're confused (well, _more_ confused than they usually are). Then Butt-Head is given laughing gas by the orthodontist because he won't stop squirming.
-   _The Busy World of Richard Scarry_: Harry Hyena, a literal example, but downplays the trope nicely.

-   One of the crooks in _C.O.P.S. (Animated Series)_ is a deadly prankster _called_ Hyena. According to his toy's Action Figure File Card, he used to be a stand-up comedian, but couldn't stop laughing at his own jokes (which, by all accounts, weren't even funny in the first place).

    **Meadow:** What? Never!
    
-   _The Loud House_ has Luan Loud, who is a comedienne and laughs when she says a pun or joke, then says "Get it?". Though she makes an effort to tone it down a bit as the show goes on.

-   In _The Proud Family_, Papi Boulevardez punctuates practically every sentence he says in smooth-sounding Spanish with howling maniacal laughter, mostly because no one understands that he's insulting them to their face.
-   Bubbles from _The Powerpuff Girls_. Her _very first line_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  was a laugh. In fact, this is the reason why she has that name, because of how "bubbly" she is.
-   Octopus Man from _Rick and Morty_. He's onscreen for a grand total of about 90 seconds, and about two thirds of those seconds involve him giggling.
-   In an episode of _Rocko's Modern Life_, a satellite crashes into the kitchen, a state-licensed contractor (an actual hyena) comes in to look at the damage. When Rocko tells him how much he can afford for repairs, the contractor immediately cracks up and proves to be of no help to Rocko.
    -   And gets a Call-Back at the end of the episode, when _another_ satellite lands on top of Bob "Bucky" Taylor.
-   The 1985 special _The Romance of Betty Boop_ has Chuckles, one of Johnny Throat's thugs, as this; he laughs evilly when threatening characters. Then again, Chuckles is an Expy of Tommy Udo from _Kiss of Death_.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Dr. Hibbert laughs at everything, and anything he _doesn't_ find funny is usually the subject of a Take That!. This got lampshaded by "Bleeding Gums" Murphy in his last episode, when he refers to his brother (given up for adoption) that always laughed at inappropriate times. Cue Dr. Hibbert.
        
        **Dr. Hibbert:** That appears to be a Ford urinating on a Chevrolet.  
        **Mrs. Hibbert:** Don't you usually laugh at everything?
