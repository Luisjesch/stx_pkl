Now you're just embarrassing your boss. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

**Cruella De Vil:** What kind of sycophant are you?  
**Frederick:** I, uh... what kind of sycophant would you like me to be?

A worshipful, perfectly willing slave of the Big Bad. Generally he's of only marginal usefulness, due to his incompetence and/or obsessions — or due to his fear of the boss' ire robbing him of all initiative.

An example of Happiness in Slavery; The Igor is a variation of this. If the Big Bad _is_ a vampire and he's "promised" the same fate to his loyal servant, may overlap with Vampire Vannabe and The Renfield. More generally, liable to a Pretender Diss both from those they (hope to) serve and their enemies. See also Dirty Coward (for reasons why someone would become this trope)

Contrast with the Battle Butler and Yes-Man. Sometimes overlaps with Crusty Caretaker and Professional Butt-Kisser, though the latter is in it only in order to look out for his own status while the sycophant has a genuine amount of admiration and adoration for his boss. If the character endures endless abuse at the hands of their master, then they're a Bumbling Sidekick. May overlap with Vile Villain, Laughable Lackey if their boss is a noticeably more serious villain. Just about the polar opposite of The Starscream, although it's not uncommon for The Starscream to _pretend_ to be this trope. See also Transhuman Treachery.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Red Shirt scientist Barnes is one of these to Szilard Quates of _Baccano!_, to the point that he's honored to be assimilated by his master.
-   Jeremiah Gottwald to Lelouch from _Code Geass_, towards the latter half of the second season. Notably, this guy not only joins Lelouch to zealously prove his **LOYALTY**, he joins after he's become far more badass than ever before. And then he tops himself in the finale. This was all brought on by the fans' love of the character.
-   In Part 3 of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_, Vanilla Ice, the Sycophantic Servant of Big Bad Dio, does manage to kill off two of the main cast. Ice was such a sycophant that when Dio asked him if he would kill himself for him, Ice not only IMMEDIATELY did so, but did so by CUTTING OFF HIS OWN HEAD. Dio, averting Bad Boss (somewhat, as he did it because he was amused), rewarded him for his loyalty by turning him into a vampire, which allowed Ice to return to (un)life. His devotion to Dio is so fanatical that merely destroying a _statue_ of Dio sends him into a rage.
-   In _Overlord (2012)_, pretty much all the creatures of Nazarick, especially the Guardians, act like this towards Ainz, treating him like a god, being unquestionably loyal to him, and willing to end their lives for him. Justified, in that Ainz and his former guild members created them as NPCs to serve them back in YGGDRASIL, so when they were all brought to life in the New World they were made automatically utterly loyal to their creators.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_: Ever since his first appearance in the '70s, Ra's al Ghul has a completely loyal hulking manservant named Ubu, who worships the ground he walks on. After a couple of apparent deaths the character is _still_ around, so it is revealed that there's an entire Ubu _clan_, and they all serve Ra's.
-   _New Avengers (2015):_ The Maker has the insect men who make up his organization WHISPER, who pretty much worship him for giving them life. On occasion, they're a little _too_ sycophantic for his tastes, declaring how _proud_ they are to record his enemies on the can for him. That their creation appears to involve the Maker removing peoples' brains might have something to do with this.
-   Mephisto had one of these in his first appearance in _Silver Surfer_. Ironically, Mephisto was himself forced to be this to Thanos during the _The Infinity Gauntlet_.
-   _Superman_: The Lowlies of Apokolips; Darkseid's reign has produced an entire race of bootlicking slaves, who will "die for Darkseid" if requested. In "Secret Six", for example, Scandal Savage employs a nameless Lowlie as a servant. Who gleefully begs for all kinds of abuse, as if torture is as necessary as food for its well-being.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Toad lived down to his name in this manner for Magneto for much of the original 1960s _X-Men_ run. In an alternate future, the Earth's poles shifted, somehow causing Toad and Magneto's powers to be switched. Toad took the opportunity to turn Mags into a slave for his enjoyment as payback for the mountains of abuse he'd suffered at his hand.
    -   Magneto in his earlier days liked these kinds of bootlickers. He also had Peeper in the second Brotherhood/Mutant Force and Amphibius in the Savage Land Mutates.
    -   Also, Nightcrawler encountered an alternate self who served this purpose for Belasco. In an alternate future, it's determined Nightcrawler -becomes- Belasco.

    Fan Works 

-   _Earth and Sky_ has Doctor Insanity and Professor Destiny's Beleaguered Assistant Otto, who sucks up to his bosses constantly until he finally takes too much of their Ax Crazyness and quits.
-   In the _Jackie Chan Adventures_ fanfiction _Queen of All Oni_, Ozeki has fanatic Undying Loyalty to Jade (to the point even she is a little unnerved), that apparently is meant to mirror the relationship between Megatron and Inferno (though he seems to have a bit of Lugnut as well).
-   _Webwork_: Jumper, one of the biker girls that Jade forcibly recruits and transforms to serve as her new Quirky Miniboss Squad, immediately latches onto her new leader. Widow, the former leader of the gang, isn't surprised; she describes Jumper as a "chronic ass-kisser", and admits that it makes perfect sense for her to switch loyalties from Widow to Jade like that, since she apparently did the same thing when Widow took over the gang. It gets to the point where even Jade herself is disturbed at the utter devotion, and wishes that Jumper would show a little more independence.

    Films — Animation 

-   Tabaqui the jackal in the Soviet adaptation of _Adventures of Mowgli_. See the page image.
-   In _The Black Cauldron_, the Sycophantic Servant was the Horned King's goblin sidekick, Creeper and one that had the mannerisms of a true lap-dog if his body language and tongue sticking out is of any merit as a sign. Note that in the book, this character did not exist.
-   Gaston's sidekick, LeFou, in _Beauty and the Beast_ is constantly sucking up and telling Gaston how great he is even when Gaston makes a habit of throwing him around. Then he tells him how great he is at throwing him around.
-   Being a send-up of the traditional Disney model, _Enchanted_ naturally has one of these in Nathaniel, who eventually wises up to the fact that his boss doesn't care about him in the slightest and decides to become his own person.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the 1996 live-action _101 Dalmatians (1996)_, Cruella De Vil has a fair number of people loyal to her, but her PA Frederick takes the cake with the page quote.
-   Eli Turnbull is this to Big Bad and INS agent Seedling in _Coneheads_, however this comes handy when he's left behind in an alien planet and turns into the planet's emperor's new Yes-Man.
-   Peter MacNichol has played two Sycophantic servants: Janosz in _Ghostbusters II_ as a straight example, and Renfield himself in _Dracula: Dead and Loving It_.
-   The only character to come out of _Manos: The Hands of Fate_ with any pop cultural significance at all is Torgo, the villain's acid-crazed satyr janitor of marginal loyalty.
-   Beni from _The Mummy_, although it's more fear and greed that are holding him, not genuine devotion. Baltus Hafez from the sequel is a straighter example.
-   Sgt. Proctor is this to the villains Mauser (movies 2 and 3) and Harris (movies 4 to 6) in the _Police Academy_ franchise. He also has this function but only to Harris in _Police Academy: The Animated Series_.
-   Downplayed with Agent Stone from the live-action _Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)_ movie; while he _is_ entirely devoted to Robotnik and kind of a butt-kisser, his admiration towards the Doctor is genuine and he follows him not out of fear or ambition, but rather out of sheer loyalty.

    Literature 

-   In theory, the Igors of Discworld should be like this, since that's part of the Igor tradition. In practice, most of the ones we've seen are either rebellious, or working for such an _un_\-traditional master that the Code of the Igors doesn't quite count. In particular, Igor in _Carpe Jugulum_ exaggerates his Igorness because he knows it winds up the modernist vampires, while continually muttering against them — the Old Count treated him like dirt, which he approved of, but the new ones treat him like an embarrassment, which is worse.
-   Wormtail in the _Harry Potter_ series. First he latched onto James and his friends because they were some of the most popular boys in school, and later he sought out Voldemort because he was likewise powerful. Unfortunately, the only skill Wormtail has that make him at all valuable is his ability to take abuse.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: When pretending to recognise Eric as Dengel, "Asuna" tailors her speech to appeal to her teacher's vanity and slanders his enemies.
-   _The Mental State_: Paul Sorrell's main tactic for surviving in prison is ingratiating himself with whichever gang-leader happens to be in the most control at the time. This is originally Bones, until Zack usurps him.
-   In the _Sword of Truth_ universe, this is essentially what happens to anyone who gets confessed — they are made completely, unconditionally loyal to their Confessor, to the point where they no longer have any sense of self.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Grand Maester Pycelle. While he is suppose to be loyal to the who ever is the King, he is in league with House Lannister the most. He was the one who allowed Tywin Lannister in so he could sack the city, and gain his good favor. He continues to serve the Lannisters as a toadie lacky much to their annoyance.
-   Damane in _The Wheel of Time_ are forced to become this after some hard core Mind Rape from the Seanchan. There's a scene in the first book where they appear when Nynaeve frees one out of pity, and the damane without missing a beat starts screaming, begging her slaver to put back on her leash. It's a little creepy.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The final season of _Blake's 7_ has Slave, the Master Computer of _Scorpio_, programmed with a cringing servile personality in contrast to the snarky and superior Orac. We do get some hints however that the servility is just an act.
-   _Buffyverse_:
    -   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: The Big Bad Glory evidently has an entire species of Sycophantic Servant demons enthralled.
    -   _Angel_:
        -   Knox is a follower of the ancient demon Illyria before he resurrects her and even more of a slavish follower after her resurrection. Having been dead to that point Illyria had no direct contact with him before her return.
        -   Harmony, who lampshades her efforts when describing herself as "extremely sycophantic" when introduced as Angel\`s new secretary.
-   True to the original, the Sycophantic Servant in _Dark Shadows_ - Willie Loomis - was also an unwilling servant who couldn't quite overcome his master's unnatural charisma.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   When the Sixth Doctor encounters the alien Sil for the second time, it is on his home planet where he also meets Sil's superior, Lord Kiv. The slimy obsequiousness that Sil demonstrates at every opportunity becomes too much even for Kiv at one point.
    -   "New Earth": Chip, Lady Cassandra's specially-grown clone servant, is utterly devoted to her despite her rather apathetically abandoning him at one point in the episode. He cheerfully donates his body as a host for her at the end, even scolding the Doctor for objecting.
-   Another example who's actually named Renfield is Turnbull from _Due South_. However, neither Turnbull nor his boss are villains, although Thatcher is, appropriately, quite intimidating, and Turnbull himself is highly eccentric.
-   Most of the villains' sidekicks in _Electra Woman and Dyna Girl_ were this, fawning adoringly over the main villain. Subverted with the Empress of Evil, where the Empress was actually a robot created by the "sidekick", who was giving her orders as part of her fawning.
-   Colonel Klink of _Hogan's Heroes_ does this to pretty much every officer that walks in the door, General Burkhalter especially. To a man, they find it annoying.
-   The Weasel-like Tim Stamper from _House of Cards (UK)_ is Francis Urquhart's Sycophantic Servant. Subverted in that in the sequel _To Play the King_ he attempts to double-cross his boss after feeling his efforts aren't appreciated. Sadly for Tim, Francis is far and away the more Magnificent Bastard of the two.
-   Every Villain of the Week on _Leverage_ seems to have one. Averted in "The Miracle Job", where the servant's conscience gets to him and he betrays the bad guy.
-   Loyal student servant Frank Lemmer is this to Ms. Russo in _Parker Lewis Can't Lose_, helps that he seems to have a crush on her and he's implied to be not totally human.
-   The Vorta of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ were genetically altered to regard the Founders of the Dominion as living gods. They are well aware of this, and take it in stride. "What's the point of being a god if there's no one to worship you?"
-   In the fifth season, Meg of _Supernatural_ is presented as one to Lucifer. Of course, he's planning to kill her, along with every other demon in existence, once he's done with humanity.
-   A non-villainous example (depending on what your definition of villainy is) are Cory, Trevor, and Jacob Collins in _Trailer Park Boys_ to Ricky and Julian. In seasons 1-7, Cory and Trevor are Those Two Guys who hero worship Ricky, whereas Jacob Collins has a mancrush on Julian to the point where he starts dressing and acting like him. Ricky and Julian, meanwhile, see them as little more than jail cover and goons to do their bidding in their various schemes (though in Ricky's warped perception, he thinks of how he treats Cory and Trevor as how one would a best friend/family, and Julian does care about Jacob). Cory and Jacob eventually become Those Two Guys together from season 8 onward, where Ricky gains more respect for Jacob as he becomes Ricky's son-in-law.
    
    In the season 8 finale, Cory and Jacob are dressed as Ricky and Julian respectively as a diversion. Cory is shot and the two are eventually sent to prison; the two gush that they've earned more of the boys' respect for doing their job well and Cory mentions that being shot and sent to jail "as Ricky" is one of the better moments of his life.
    

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Pat Patterson and Gerald Briscoe to "Mr. MacMahon". What makes them different from most of the other people working closely with Vince was Pat and Gerald legitimately thought Vince was the light of their lives and never aligned themselves with him out of greed, power, or fame. Even Vince's own kids back-stabbed him on occasions, but not the stooges.

    Radio 

-   _Cabin Pressure:_ It's a worrying sign when Douglas, normally the font of perpetual sarcasm, bends over backwards to accommodate Mr. Birling. As it turns out, Mr. Birling gives out ludicrously huge tips, loves being toadied, and pays people quite a lot to do it. When Martin learns about this, he about turns to total obsequiousness himself, though Mr. Birling criticises him on his toadying technique.

    Video Games 

-   Chaos cultists in _Dawn of War_ have _some_ use in combat as invisible detectors, but their all-around weakness, annoying voices, and persistent lickspittling make them this trope.
-   Michael Anders from _Dead Island 2_ is a rare heroic example of this trope. Loyal to Emma up until his death and just can’t help himself but to kiss Emma Jaunt’s ass.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, this tends to be a trait of the members of the Dark Brotherhood, an illegal organization of assassins whose membership mostly takes a sadistic glee in killing and who practice a Religion of Evil dedicated to Sithis, the embodiment of the primeval force of chaos. They are led by the Night Mother, an unholy matron said to be the "wife" of Sithis who communicates targets for assassination to the Listener. In _Skyrim_, Cicero is the Keeper of the Night Mother, to whom he is slavishly devoted. He constantly begs to hear her voice call to him, something that only happens to the Listener (in this case, the Dragonborn). Also, if you decide to spare him, he returns in the end of the questline and becomes this _to you_.
-   In _Fallout: New Vegas_, Yes-Man was this to Benny. He can also be the Courier's after you deal with Benny, as being generally agreeable is in his programming.
-   In _Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes_, Viscount Fenja spends most of her limited screentime sucking up to Duke Aegir, partially out of a genuine desire to help him overthrow Edelgard as emperor, and partially to increase her own status by becoming one of his ministers if his plan succeeds. Fenja only turns against the duke after being defeated and captured on Azure Gleam, but only because she thinks that the Kingdom army will release her if she tells them what she thinks they need to hear.
-   Wheeler from _Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia_ is the short and stumpy Yes-Man to Altru Inc.'s president, Blake Hall. While the others in his circle often utilize high-power Pokemon, Wheeler always attacks with...Bidoof.
-   Ishida Mitsunari from the third game of _Sengoku Basara_ is implied to have been one of these to Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the prequel manga. Unfortunately for anyone who shows the slightest sign of wanting to oppose Hideyoshi, Mitsunari is terrifyingly good at his job.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_:
    -   The Jedi Knight deals with a cult of fanatical Emperor-worshiping Imperials. They're fully onboard with the Emperor's plan to destroy Belsavis and the rest of the galaxy, even though they're not meant to survive it, because he's promised to bring them back afterwards.
    -   All Imperial characters get the droid 2V-R8 as a servant on their ship and as a companion (thought not an especially useful one). Anytime you walk by it will start singing your praises and talking about how great you are.
-   Kael'thas has become this to Kil'Jaeden in _World of Warcraft_ due to a mix of Fel Magic taint and his own hunger for power. His blind, zealous and borderline _loving_ devotion to the Legion Lord is very creepy. Though it might have something to do with the fact that he was brought back from near-death by Kil'jaeden's demons. Before that he seemed quite sane.

    Web Animation 

-   _Hazbin Hotel_: Sir Pentious' Egg Brigade are anthropomorphic eggs serving a demon conqueror — except every other sentence that comes out of their cracks is dedicated to worshiping their boss and begging him to shoot them with his ray gun.
-   In one of _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_'s Q&A sessions, one of the letters asks whether the author could become one of those for the Emperor, who upon hearing this orders a restraint order to be put on the man.

    Web Comics 

    Western Animation 

-   Scratch and Grounder to Dr Robotnik in _Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog_ (Coconuts is even more devoted to Robotnik, though the latter usually disregards him in favour of the other two).
-   Toadie from _Adventures of the Gummi Bears_, true to his name he tried to make up for being tiny for a troll by continually sucking up to his boss the Duke despite the Duke constantly taking his anger out on the little guy. Justified in the sense that while the Duke is a pain, at least associating with him gives him some semblance of authority over the regular ogres who casually abuse him out of fun.
-   Igor in _Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!_, Dr. Gangreen’s assistant, although is possible that his loyalty to Gangreen is out of stupidity and also because he wants to be a news reporter and only if Gangreen’s conquest the world he will.
-   Basil to Rataxes in _Babar_: he is extremely loyal and faithful, to the point of acknowledging that his job is making Rataxes feel good about himself, he let Rataxes take the credit when he does something heroic (like saving Babar's daughter from drowning) and helps Rataxes in all his schemes without questioning. Nevertheless he does have some fun at the expenses of his boss sometimes and Rataxes shows to be extremely depending of him (and he knows it).
-   Shecky the Jester in _The Biskitts_ treats King Max well… like a King, but his loyalty and dependence on Max makes no sense as the kingdom is empty and other than the guardian dogs he’s the only subject.
-   DC Animated Universe:
    -   _Batman: The Animated Series_: Harley Quinn's obsession with The Joker is so bad, that in an episode wherein he is perfectly willing to leave her in the city while he nukes it and she is about to quit, he gets her back in one line. This is completely in character.
    -   Mercy Graves is similar toward Lex Luthor in _Superman: The Animated Series_, although it's somewhat implied that she's in love with him too, her loyalty comes from the fact that he took her out of the streets and that's why she's devoted to him. It's not mutual as the series shows that Luthor doesn't care for her at all.
    -   Both of these examples pale before the relationship between the Ventriloquist has with Scarface (a ventriloquist dummy who harbors an evil personality), laughing at every Stealth Insult the Catchphrase Insult Scarface throws at him. Really depressing.
        
        **Scarface:** Batman's so hot, let's see him swim Gotham Bay in concrete boots.  
        **The Ventriloquist:** A good idea, Mr. Scarface.  
        **Scarface:** Bet your bow tie I'm right, dummy. Say, who dresses you anyway?  
        **The Ventriloquist:** You're such a kidder, Mr. Scarface.
        
-   Toad in _Drak Pack_ the loyal lackey of Big Bad Dr. Dredd and the classical suck-up, albeit completely useless and his screw ups cause many of Dredd's plans to fail.
-   In _The Emperor's New School_ (the television spin-off of _The Emperor's New Groove_), Guaca qualifies as this though Kuzco is the main character and not a villain.
-   Subverted with Owen on _Gargoyles_, as it is revealed that Owen is the magical being Puck, who served Xanatos with absolute loyalty mainly because being a part of his schemes amused him.
-   Smeck, Lucifer's incompetent minor demon sidekick in _God, the Devil and Bob_.
-   _Green Lantern: The Animated Series_: Zox is this to Atrocitus, his capabilities as a Red Lantern tend to vary on episodes.
-   Zim of _Invader Zim_. _Everything_ he does is for the Tallest, and he goes to ridiculous lengths to try to impress them. It never works, since they originally sent him out in space so he would die and never return to Planet Irk, which he's oblivious to, for the better.
-   On _Jimmy Two-Shoes_, all of Lucius' Minotaurs are like this, to the point where they willingly sacrifice themselves to use as bait so Lucius can fish.
-   _Looney Tunes_ has Chester who was very much a fawning, drooling lackey to Spike despite being used as a punching-bag by him. He encouraged his hero to beat up a cat to cheer him up. By the end, things get to be a little different... The fact that Spike pays for his bullying ways by getting the snot beaten out of him by an escaped panther and ends up a Nervous Wreck and sucking up to Chester the same way that Chester was a sycophant who was abused by Spike makes for some hilariously ironic Laser-Guided Karma.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_: Sabrina is more like this and less like a Beta Bitch to Chloe. The latter bullies the former into doing all her hard labor, from her homework to the dirty work of her schemes to bully others. The poor girl is literally at Chloe’s beck and call, and yet is completely enamored, almost to the point where you start feeling sorry for her.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "Inspiration Manifestation", the Inspiration Manifestation spell only works so long as Spike acts as this for Rarity.
-   Smee in _Peter Pan & the Pirates_, although Smee is like this in all versions. His loyalty is probably the reason why he is second-in-command (with no other merits on his own).
-   The Pigs in _The Raccoons_ are devoted to Cyril Sneer. A key difference though is that they are formally his employees, but their faithfulness and how they ignore his mistreatments go beyond any normal or healthy boss-employee relationship.
-   Dudley the hammerhead shark to the Sea Witch Hedwig in _Saban's Adventures of the Little Mermaid_ follows his mistress loyally even though (as most examples of this trope) he is the victim of constant abuse.
-   In _SilverHawks_, Big Bad Mon\*Star has this in Yes Man, a Snake man who has a combo Verbal Tic and Sssssnake Talk of always muttering "yesss yessss".
-   In _The Simpsons_, Smithers fulfills this role. In the Dracula Halloween episode, he was even dressed literally as Renfield (played by Tom Waits!) in Francis Ford Coppola's _Bram Stoker's Dracula_ movie.
    
    **Mr. Burns:** Is it wrong to cheat in order to win a million-dollar bet?  
    **Smithers:** Yes, sir.  
    **Mr. Burns:** Let me rephrase that. Is it wrong if _I_ cheat in order to win a million-dollar bet?  
    **Smithers:** No, sir. Who would you like killed?
    
-   Snively ironically started off as one in early _Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)_, before evolving into a vengeful Starscream thanks to Robotnik's treatment of him.
-   Gems loyal to Homeworld in _Steven Universe_ are all created with the express purpose of serving the Diamonds, or at least the Diamond they were created for. When in their presence, they have a habit of showering them with compliments and praise. While they endure it every time, it is pretty clear that Blue and Yellow Diamond have heard it all before.
    
    **Holly Blue Agate:** My Diamond. My gracious, wondrous, luminous, lustrous, Diamond _\[Holly Blue Agate notices that Yellow Diamond is there too\]_ ...s! Ah! Oh my! It's truly an honor to bask in your radiance...s.  
    **Yellow Diamond:** Get to the point, Agate.
    
-   _Transformers: Animated_:
    -   Lugnut is a borderline case, though it's more fanaticism than slavishness: in some episodes he seems to practically worship Megatron... and in others, there's no "practically" about it. He's also more badass than most Sycophantic Servants, ever ready to use his hundreds of missiles, his warhammer, and The Punch of Kill Everything to level Autobots (and the entire city block they happen to be in) in the name of **the grand and glorious MEGATRON!**
        
        **Lugnut:** I WILL NOT HIDE! I WILL STAND PROUDLY AND **SHOUT MEGATRON'S NAME TO THE HEAVENS!**
        
    -   Starscream is stated to have put on a sycophantic act prior to betraying Megatron. Later, one of his clones (who each represent different aspect of his character), Sunstorm, embodies this trait, being both outwardly sycophantic but not-so-secretly untrustworthy.
-   In G1 _The Transformers_:
    -   Cyclonus is Galvatron's Sycophantic Servant. His exact level of competence is plot-reliant, but generally he's described as quite powerful and skilled—he could even lead the Decepticons if he weren't so devoted to Galvatron.
    -   Ditto for Shockwave's relationship to Megatron, before The Movie (of course this is somewhat in contrast to his role in the comics).
    -   In another _Transformers_ example, there's Inferno from _Beast Wars_, who could probably give Lugnut a run for his money in the obsession department. Perhaps a semi-subversion, as his competence level varies throughout the series (due to being an Ax-Crazy pyromaniac who thinks he's an actual fire ant), but his loyalty never does. Inferno doesn't seem to have a choice in the matter either. It's implied that his ant mode's instincts overpower his programming, leading to his delusion of thinking he's an actual fire ant and his absolute loyalty to Megatron as Queen of the colony.
-   On the animated series _Visionaries_, Mordred played the Sycophantic Servant role to Darkstorm, leader of the show's villains.
-   Muttley bounces between this and Chronic Backstabbing Disorder on _Wacky Races_ and _Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines_, first biting Dick Dastardly's hand, then kissing it after insulting him.
