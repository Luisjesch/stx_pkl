_"Okay, look. We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret. But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster."_

A Stock Phrase often directed towards a Big Bad or other particularly evil character. If a character is saying this, it's a good indication that whoever the statement is directed towards has either crossed the Moral Event Horizon in the character's eyes or just so happened to press their Berserk Button.

See You're Insane! for when a character is calling another crazy rather than evil. This can also lead to an Insult Backfire if a particularly wicked villain takes pride in this label.

This trope can also be used to point out how powerful the addressee is. A monster that doesn't have the capacity to do harm isn't much of a monster, after all, so calling someone a monster incorporates an admission that they're a force to be reckoned with. If the addressee is a tragic character, being powerful may be all it takes for them to be called a monster no matter how kind and pacifistic they are.

In dramatic situations, this carries the same weight as the Japanese This Is Unforgivable!. Unrelated to You Bastard!, but there may be overlap if the work's being fairly Anvilicious. May be the cause or effect (but mostly cause) of a Villainous Breakdown.

This often shows up in What Measure Is a Non-Human? scenarios, often targeted at a character who either is or is trying to be human.

Villains who use this can invoke Even Evil Has Standards, especially when someone does an evil act that they consider more atrocious.

Compare Complete Monster, in which the audience feels that the character is irredeemable. This phrase is quite effective when directed towards a Complete Monster. Also compare Cowardice Callout, which is when someone is called out on their shortcomings related to a lack of courage, What the Hell, Hero? when a protagonist rather than a villain is called out for un-heroic behavior, and Beyond Redemption, for when someone feels that another person has committed a heinous crime that made them give up on trying to redeem them (and may also lead them to call them a monster). Contrast with You Rebel Scum!, where the general populace in-story has been convinced that the protagonists are evil. See also I Am a Monster when they consider _themselves_ to be evil or inhuman. Note that this trope is not meant to call out someone who betrayed the heroes. That would be Et Tu, Brute?

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Attack on Titan_:
    -   A very interesting (and complicated) example when Eren confronts Reiner and Bertolt concerning their crimes. As enemy agents, they've been responsible for the majority of death and destruction in the series, by destroying the Walls and providing information for Annie's attack on the 57th Expedition. Ironically, Eren's rant specifically condemns them for expressing remorse over their actions, calling them inhuman monsters that have no right to even feel guilt after learning that Reiner's crushing guilt over his actions has caused him to begin blocking out his true memories in order to continue functioning. Ymir immediately calls Eren out as well, making it clear that his overly-simple worldview makes him unreliable and unable to grasp the bigger picture. Considering one of the major themes of the series is He Who Fights Monsters, accusations about exactly who is a monster are common and rarely simple.
    -   Armin attempts to trick Bertolt by falsely claiming Annie is being tortured. Bertolt loses his temper and calls Armin a Devil-Spawn before lunging at him, dropping his guard long enough for Erwin to rescue Eren.
-   _Black Lagoon_. Janet Bhai is running away from gangsters, while Sister Eda is driving next to her in a car.
    
    **Sister Eda**: Do you want us to save you? Think hard. If you don't want to hand over the plates, I guess we don't have a choice. You'd better run to a mosque next time. What do you think? \[snip\]  
    **Janet Bhai**: 30,000 dollars!  
    **Sister Eda**: Rock, it's almost my bedtime. I'm going back to the church.  
    **Janet Bhai**: You monster! 100,000!
    
-   _Bleach_: Gremmy calls Kenpachi a monster when the latter casually unveils his Shikai and cuts the meteor Gremmy was trying to destroy the Seireitei with.
-   Turned upside-down and rammed in the nearest bin in _Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan_: Sakura takes off the halo of his would-be angelic assassin Sabato-chan (who has tried ash him with lightning on several occasions), and gets 'SAKURA-KUN YOU MONSTER!!!' — on the basis that this'll give her uber-explosive diarrhea. All the funnier for the fact that previously she, with obvious glee, explained to Sakura that it's what he did to the titular protagonist — who turned up to save him from Sabato.
-   _Claymore_: Teresa and the recently awakened Rosemary have this exchange:
    
    **Rosemary**: You...damned...monster.  
    **Teresa**: Monster... That makes two of us.
    
-   _Darker than Black_: The line shows up several times, but it's usually as much due to Fantastic Racism as to actually evil behavior. Though given the nature of supers in this show, there's some intersect there.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   In the _original series_, during the King Piccolo Saga, the titular villain calls Goku a monster when he starts noticing Goku's incredible strength. Unflappably, Goku replies the same goes for Piccolo.
        
        **King Piccolo:** You... You're a monster!  
        **Son Goku:** That makes two of us!
        
    -   Possibly the most often-quoted dialogue exchange in _Dragon Ball Z_ comes from the eighth movie, _Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan_, though it is more of a variation. The titular villain is completely curbstomping the heroes and has just roughed up Gohan, when Piccolo shows up. The dialogue is usually translated along these lines:
        
        **Broly**: So, another little bug has come to die!  
        **Piccolo**: Hmph. Do as you like, you monster.  
        **Broly**: A monster? No, you're wrong, I'm THE DEVIL!
        
    -   _Dragon Ball Z Kai_ has Goku say this after Krillin's death and Frieza's subsequent threat:
        
        **Frieza**: \*laughs\* I think the brat should go next.  
        **Goku**: Y-You ruthless... heartless... **BASTARD! I WILL... MAKE YOU... SUFFER!**
        
    -   Android 18 yells this before attacking Cell and being absorbed.
    -   In an ironic twist of fate, _Cell_, who has killed more than 600,000 people, ends up calling _Gohan_ a monster, after Gohan has turned into a sadistic Super Saiyan 2.
    -   In _Dragon Ball Super_, Goku yells this after Goku Black tells him that after swapping bodies with Goku in another timeline, he murdered Goku in front of Chi-Chi and Goten and then killed them as well.
-   _Fist of the North Star_: In response to a demand for his name from one of the early bad guys, Kenshiro replies "I don't give my name to monsters." Said early bad guy had just forced a villager to try to shoot a can off the head of his little boy who was tied to a stake, William Tell style.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, Greed calls his sadistic brother Pride a beast, and shortly before that, tells human allies that even he (a Humanoid Abomination) considers Pride (more of an Eldritch Abomination) a monster.
    -   When an amnesiac Greed kills his friend Bido, unlocking his memories, an enraged Ling calls him a monster for abandoning his friend.
    -   Upon seeing Scar and hearing from Ed that he killed her parents, Winry undergoes a breakdown on the spot, questions why he would do such a thing after they saved his life and uses this quote before she picks up a gun dropped by a soldier.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_. Cyborg assassin Triela calls Badass Normal terrorist Pinocchio this during their Final Battle, because he doesn't just keel over and die like all her other targets. After Pinocchio throws her out a window, only to have Triela smash through another plate-glass window after him, Pinocchio can only comment dryly, "Who's the monster now?"
-   In the TV series of _Hellsing_, there's this exchange:
    
    **Alexander Anderson**: You monster.  
    **Alucard**: I get that a lot.
    
    -   Also happens quite a lot in Hellsing Ultimate.
        
        **Alucard:** Come on, get up! Attack me! You've only suffered the loss of your legs. Summon up your familiars, transform your body, heal your severed legs and stand! The evening is still so young. Come on! Hurry, Hurry! HURRY!!! Pull yourself together, the fun has just begun. Come on, HURRY!  
        **Luke Valentine:** MONSTER!!!
        
        **SWAT member:** No! You're a monster!  
        **Alucard:** Yes, people keep telling me that. And what does that make you who would stand against me, Soldier? A man? A dog? A monster?
        
-   Variation in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood_. Robert. E. O. Speedwagon doesn't tell Dio Brando that he's a monster so much as he lets Jonathan Joestar know just how vile Dio is.
    
    **Speedwagon:**"I like you, Jonathan, so I'm gonna offer up this little tidbit pro bono: living in the gutter, you learn to spot lowlifes pretty quick if you want to see tomorrow. I've trained my nose to sort out the bad ones from the good just from a sniff. This fellow reeks of brimstone and blood worse than anyone I've ever laid eyes on!"
    
-   _Kill la Kill_: Ryuko Matoi is blown away by the sudden info in Episode 11 when she learns that Nui Harime is the one who killed her father. After giving it a minute to sink in, she flies into a terrifying rage, punctuated by the furious scream of "YOU BITCH!" directed towards the murderer.
-   _Kirby: Right Back at Ya!_: "Anyone who abandons his reason, and lives only by hatred, is a monster!" Interestingly, in the Japanese version, the kanji characters for "Demon" and "Beast" are used to describe someone who is consumed by hatred. And, in fact, anyone who has been so not only is considered a monster, it's also possible for that someone to turn into one.
-   Deconstructed in _Kotoura-san_; Haruka Kotoura was called a "monster" as a child and the memory of it is enough to cause either Wide Eyes and Shrunken Irises and/or Dull Eyes of Unhappiness as she reverts into her pessimistic and broken persona. She's normally a good person; however, her always-on Telepathy often makes her look like an Innocently Insensitive mental invader towards others, hence the accusation.
-   In the manga adaptation of _The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games_, Link hits Onox with this in outrage after Onox kills Pyoko.
-   Nanoha from _Lyrical Nanoha_ gets this a lot.
    -   In the second season, it's the "villains" who refer to the eponymous heroine as a devil (after she shrugs off enough magical punishment to kill a lesser being 20 times over, no less). Her reaction?
    -   In the third season _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_, Dieci wonders if Nanoha is human after being quickly defeated and seeing the amount of power Nanoha had at the start of the battle — ironic, seeing how she is one of the few mages of her level who actually _are_.
    -   Signum also comments "Good grief, you monster. I thought I was going to die back there." to Nanoha in the last chapter of the _StrikerS_ manga after their mock battle concludes in a draw. Kind of hypocritical of her, as she probably came closer to killing Nanoha with her fiery explosions.
-   In the season finale of _Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury_, after Suletta splatters a terrorist in front of Miorine, all Miorine can do is call Suletta a murderer.
-   In _Naruto_, Sakura refers to Sasori as a monster due to his lack of empathy towards others, on account on him having a puppet body and all and being a member of the Akatsuki.
-   _Rave Master_: "Grrrrrrrr — you monster!"
-   _Spriggan_. Played for laughs in "Forest of No Return", when Yu Ominae and Yoshino Somei capture a mook fleeing the Monster of the Week.
    
    **Yoshino:** We just have a few questions for you. What exactly, are the things you're fighting?  
    **Mook:** M-Monsters!  
    **Yoshino:** _(punches him)_ Hey! We're no monsters!  
    **Mook:** No, monsters! Monsters are coming!
    
-   From the first episode of _Tenchi Muyo!_, during the title character's fight with Ryoko:
    
    **Tenchi:** If I had my way, I wouldn't be fighting a monster like you!  
    **Ryoko:** _Monster?_ Tell me, just exactly what makes you call a pretty young lady like me _A MONSTER?!_  
    **Tenchi:** Oh, come on! You walk through fire, you walk through walls, you rip holes in the roof and you can even fly!  
    **Ryoko:** Very good reasons, but not good enough!
    
-   _Trigun_: Vash the Stampede gets this periodically, even for just his skills and reputation. When things about his... special body come out this trope gets cranked up, such as the shooting-a-hole-in-the-moon thing. The single saddest example is when he saves a town in the _Maximum_ manga shortly after being forcibly introduced to just how flexible he is, and winds up reflexively catching a bullet with a 'feather' from his arm. The townspeople _stone him_.
    -   On the other hand, if you try this on his Evil Twin he'll just smile.
    -   Wolfwood got this at least once, too. Although no one was harder on Wolfwood than Wolfwood, except maybe Lazlo and Master C.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   Played with. When Ghost Kaiba's true identity is revealed Yami Yugi tells them he won't call them a monster, since that would be an insult to the game's monster cards.
    -   The _real_ Kaiba said it to Pegasus several episodes later, however. Of course, given what Pegasus had done to Mokuba, this was not a time to make jokes.

    Comic Books 

-   _Joker's Asylum_: The Penguin's one-shot has Violet call the Penguin a monster after discovering his habit of murdering, maiming or ruining the lives of the people who have slighted him when she became suspicious of his hand in the suicide of a chef who appeared to be laughing in Cobblepot's direction.
-   Used in a _Samurai Jack_ story from the 17th issue of _Cartoon Network Action Block_. An Animal Wrongs Group deceives Jack into setting free a bunch of large and vicious predators, telling him that the beasts are being unfairly imprisoned when their true intention is to allow the creatures to kill everyone in the city that their imprisonment was protecting. After Jack kills all the beasts to save the city and has the trio of insane animal rights activists locked up in the cage that once held the creatures, one of the activists laments the demises of "those poor beautiful monsters".

Reactron replies she does not know one man when she sees one, prompting Lois to reply she definitely _does_, and Reactron is no man at all.
    
    **Lois Lane:** **Monster!**  
    **Reactron:** Monster? Your **problem**, lady, is that you don't know a **real** man when you meet one.  
    **Lois:** Sure I **do** \[Karate chop to the neck\]  
    **Reactron:** **AAAHHH!**  
    **Lois:** —You're just **NOT** him!

    -   In issue 64, Superman calls Brainiac a monster after he seemngly drops Terry McGinnis to his doom upon possessing his Batsuit.
-   Prowl deservedly gets one of these from Springer in _The Transformers: Sins of the Wreckers_ for having Kup's brain suborned while he was being repaired after the events of Spotlight: Kup, so that if desired he could take over Kup's brain and use the much-respected veteran as a literal mouthpiece for his ideas to Optimus or the Autobots at large, banking on their respect for him to make them accept an idea where it would be otherwise rejected coming from Prowl himself. Prowl responds in the most Prowl way imaginable.

    **Prowl:** Noted.

-   In _Batman: Melody for a Mockingbird_, this trope is a combination of Berserk Button and Trauma Button for the Big Bad, Tommy Elliot, because they were the last words his mother said to him before he killed her. Not that he doesn't tick every single box on a monster criteria list.
-   _Wisdom and Courage_: During a "The Reason You Suck" Speech in chapter 33, Zelda declares that, for all of her claims of wanting to avenge her ancestors, it's clear that all Veran really is, is a power-hungry witch who steals whatever power sources she can find, just so she can cause destruction and chaos for her own amusement, outright telling Veran that she isn't the Queen of Shadows as she claims to be, but "a monster that crawled forth from them."

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Shrek_, the Gingerbread Man calls Lord Farquaad this in the form of "You're a monster!" A half-comedic example, Farquaad is still doing something pretty horrific at the time. When called this, Faarquad responds in kind.

        **Silas:** I...I didn't think that you were ready to...  
        **Victor:** To what? For them to see the monster?

Curiously enough, it may have something to do with your teeth. Diastema, they call it. Comes from sucking your thumb when you're a child. Yes. I expect that's what the psychologists will say when they get you into the lunatic asylum. "Ogre's teeth." Being bullied at school and so on. Extraordinary the effect it has on a child. Then Nazism helped to fan the flames and then came the crack on your ugly head. The crack you engineered yourself. I expect that settled it. From then on you were really mad. Same sort of thing as people who think they're God. Extraordinary what tenacity they have. Absolute fanatics. You're almost a genius. Lombroso would have been delighted with you. As it is you're just a mad dog that'll have to be shot. Or else you'll commit suicide. Paranoiacs generally do. Too bad. Sad business. And now let's get on with this farce, you great hairy-faced lunatic.

When Sheridan lets it sink in, he assumes the same mood if not the same words. He sums up his sentiment in a terse log entry seen in the beginning of the next episode:

    -   _Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII_: Sephiroth, Angeal, and Genesis are all described by themselves and others as monsters. Sephiroth is the only one of the three who truly fits this trope.

    -   _Final Fantasy XIII_ has Snow say this when Dysley slaughters every human in the room (that being everyone excluding the party and himself).

-   In _The Reconstruction_, this is Dehl's response to learning that Havan tortured Donz to death.
-   In _Dark Souls_, Eingyi will call you a monster if you kill his mistress the Daughter of Chaos. Since she's one of the most kind-hearted and sympathetic characters in the game and is totally defenseless and non-hostile, it's hard to disagree.
-   In _Legacy of Kain_, Kain gets called this by Vorador after he kills Umah in cold blood. Kain responds (possibly correctly) that Vorador would have done the same in his place, but the incident is still shocking because it was starting to look as if Kain might have found a Morality Pet.
-   Bishop Doplin of _Legaia II: Duel Saga_ gets called "garbage" and a "truly evil person". After you defeat Elliot and Marienne for the final time, the party confronts Doplin in order to obtain the Pyrolith.

    **Maya**: I used to think that there was no such thing as a truly evil person, but... I guess I was wrong.  
    **Kazan**: I've never met anyone as rotten to the core... This is not a man, he's garbage.
    
-   In _Furi_, the last jailer is the least experienced of the bunch and she tells you the others told her that you, the Stranger, are a monster. As you chase her down to kill her so you can escape, she can confirm you really ARE a monster. Considering you're a Walking Wasteland sent to scout the planet for assimilation, she's right.
-   Done in _NieR_ during the New Game Plus; now that you understand what the shades are saying and considering you are cutting down children and innocent shades it isn't entirely un-justified.
-   _Tsukihime_: near the end of Arcueid's route, _Roa_ says this to Shiki after he shows him how to kill things.
-   _Shadowverse_: In the English translation, Isabelle blurted this variation of this trope to Rowen when she discovered that the dragon that killed Kyle was Rowen. Averted in the Japanese script.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_: You'll hear a lot of this when you choose dark side options. And the whole Sith Warrior storyline is essentially written for these moments.
    -   Inverted fairly early on in the Sith Warrior storyline: the player has been sent by their new master to ensure that a shipment of goods that are delivered safely. Naturally two teams of enemies show up and in the ensuing conversation, the player eventually comes to the option where they can a) Convince the opponents to attack each other and wipe themselves out, b) Attack them both at once, or c) chose the option entitled simply "I'm a monster." Choosing this gives you a scene with your Sith Warrior ranting about how he is going to slaughter and _eat_ them involving such gems as threatening to drink their marrow, which causes the enemies to flee in terror.
-   Upon defeating Tiberius in _Hard Corps: Uprising_: "Go to hell, you monster!"
-   Shi-Long Lang to Big Bad Quercus Alba in the final case of _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_, after uncovering his crimes, including a serious blow to Lang's home country's economy through the use of counterfeit currency:

-   _Bionic Commando_ for the original NES had the Narm Charm\-ingly appropriate "Your number's up! Monster!" directed to the game's final boss Master-D AKA Hitler, after he hijacks the scheme from Killt. Right before Hitler's head explodes. Given who it is, it's an unusual instance where calling them a monster is probably an understatement.
-   At the end of _The Last of Us_, when Joel kills the surgeon about to operate on Ellie, one of the surgeon's assistants calls him a "fucking animal". You're given the option to kill her for this.

-   In _Time Crisis 5_, Keith says, "Gah, you monster!" to Robert when Robert's robot goes One-Winged Angel.
-   A surprising amount of _Undertale_. The Genocide path is the obvious example. At the end, Asgore even says "Howdy! Erm... What kind of monster are you...? Sorry, I cannot tell.". But even in the True Pacifist path it's revealed that the whole mess was "your" fault to begin with. The original Fallen Child, who the player is naming at the start (the canonical name is Chara), killed themself and manipulated Asriel into bringing their body to the surface. In fact, if their plan had fully succeeded, Asriel-as-possessed-by-Chara would have killed all the humans on the surface and used their SOULs to destroy everything. The current situation is only because Asriel resisted, took back control, and returned underground to die from the wounds the humans inflicted.
-   Pretty much the remark that Dredgen Yor's Ghost had for him in Destiny...and possibly Jaren Ward's Ghost too.
-   In _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II_, the members of Class VII refer to Duke Cayenne variously as "monster" and "scum," first for using the Crown Prince Cedric to awaken the Vermillion Apocalypse, and then, when it's defeated, holding a sword to Prince Cedric's neck and trying to use him as a shield hostage to get away.

-   In the _Azure Striker Gunvolt_ series, Straw Character Acura (Copen in the English versions) indiscriminately calls all adepts<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  "bakemono", which is essentially how one says "(You) monster(s)." in Japanese. In _Luminous Avenger iX_ he especially refers to Asimov as this after learning he killed Gunvolt and Joule and manipulated several more adepts to take over the world, which is of note because by then he Took A Love In Kindness.
-   At the end of _Sin and Punishment: Star Successor_:
    
    **Deko**: How can this be? You've defied the will of the creators! Your allegiance to that monster will destroy this entire universe!  
    **Isa**: There's only one monster here... And that's _you_, Deko!

-   In _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_, this exact phrase is used by Noah when N taunts that Mio won't be reborn if she dies as part of her Homecoming. All while confining the party in jail until the day of said Homecoming approaches and giving them full view of the moon so they can see the time ticking towards that day. You monster, indeed.
