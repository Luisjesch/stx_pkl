Don't worry, I won't bite... unless you want me to.

_"My throbbing vampire dick is a fan-based parody. Its shaft, balls, and scrotum are a property of me, Jan Valentine, and whatever bitch I happen to be giving it to at the time. Please support my dick by helping with its official release! You know you want to..."_

One of the most common traits of vampires is that they tend to have a lot of sex appeal. It may be because Beauty Is Bad, but not all vampires are evil, so maybe it's because they're bad boys or sultry Femme Fatales. The bloodsucking may be a great fetish source, something about a quick sting of pain followed by pleasure. Or maybe they just figure hundreds of years of practice at lovemaking makes them really, really good at it. Whatever the reason is, people find vampires arousing, and writers use that to please the fans, and sometimes themselves.

This goes back pretty far, since vampirism has long been a metaphor for sexual activity, sexual predators, and/or sexual transmitted diseases in legends. The very term "vamp" is an evolution of this metaphor. Vampires' thirst and consumption of bodily fluids makes them animalistic predators; therefore, their sexual needs are more basic and rougher, which can be a Fetish for some people, hence the expression "necking". The other part of the Trope goes to the Victorian ideals of womanhood: pale, frail, and bloodless, which was the effect of tuberculosis, aka "consumption", on women, which is part of where the vampire myth originated. Certainly, a lot of vampires have Raven Hair, Ivory Skin.

The question of how vampires can be sexually active despite being clinically _dead_ (in most settings),<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and what it says about the people attracted to them anyway, tends to be hand waved or played for squicky laughs. Other Undead (except possibly death knights, if they—like this sort of vampire—fall into the pale, looks-almost-alive variety) such as Zombies usually tended not to get this treatment as they are almost always less human-looking and more obviously dead. However, this trend seems to be changing: other types of undead beings, like zombies and mummies, are nowadays increasingly being portrayed as humanlike and physically attractive. It's rare in a Fur Against Fang scenario, or Vampire-Werewolf Love Triangle, for Werewolves to get the same treatment, as sipping from your vein is easier to make sexy than being mauled and eaten, but some go ahead anyway to portray that bestial power as alluring.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Call of the Night_, vampires instinctively become more alluring upon turning. This is stated to be a survival trait meant to help them preserve their numbers: in order for a vampire to turn a normal human into a vampire, their would-be offspring must first fall in love with them; therefore, coming off as more attractive facilitates their reproduction by helping them attract more humans. Nazuna appears to be the sole exception, if only because she's a bit asocial compared to most vampires and has no interest in creating offspring. That being said, even Yamori finds her attractive from time to time, much to his own surprise.
-   _Diabolik Lovers_ is probably famous for this trope. More than for its actual storyline, Diabolik Lovers is known for being very obscene. Why would you bite the heroine in her neck when you can suck blood from her inner thighs? Not only do we get a ton of sadistic vampires, multiple of them seem to be sexual deviants as well.
-   In _Digimon Ghost Game_, the vampire Digimon Myotismon manages to blend into human society perfectly enough to become a Pretty Boy Corrupt Corporate Executive who easily manages to invite female Internet influencers to his Evil Tower of Ominousness and turn them into his thralls with little to no resistance on their part.
-   Carmilla from the 2018 anime iteration of _Gegege No Kitaro_ is a well-endowed vampire with a deep voice and a penchant for young girls, including Neko Musume, she also likes to take blood baths.
-   Both deBloodeaus, father and son, in _Ghost Sweeper Mikami_. But it's mostly Played for Laughs.
-   _Hellsing_:
    -   Seras is the local Ms. Fanservice.
    -   Alucard is somewhat of an example, but his sexuality is presented as far more violent; see his Curb-Stomp Battle of Rip Van Winkle being shot like a rape scene.
    -   Pip Bernadotte mentions this trope after he witnessed Alucard hypnotizing a bellboy, wondering if the vampire used magic or if it's just his erotic charisma.
-   _Interspecies Reviewers_ explains why vampires are the most palatable of the undead to bed: they preserve their mortal beauty (and often improve on it due to certain vampiric traits), pair it with long-lived experience/skill, and do not have the coldness, the stench of death, or the lack of skin and flesh other undead have to deal with. The Count Call Girlula keeps some undead, including his faithful vampire bride Soufu, in a harem that is allowed to operate as the brothel Necrowife during his downtime sleeping in a coffin; as he spends long years resting, he cannot keep mortal women in his harem as they would get bored.
-   Seraphim and Sarasvasti from _Is This A Zombie?_. Especially Sera — she just stepped on to the stage and was instantly ranked number 7.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_: Dio Brando is so good Even the Guys Want Him, and he's got four sons from four different mothers.
-   The titular character of _Karin_. Once it's found out that Karin is the chosen vessel of life that is capable of repopulating the vampire race, she is abducted by other vampires for this very reason.
-   _Midnight Secretary_ takes this one step further. Rather than just being inherently appealing, it is stated that vampires actually prefer to have sex with their prey before they feed, since arousal improves the taste of blood (in a blatant denial of HoYay/LesYay, vampires in this universe can't feed on humans of the same sex). This is a major plot point, since it is part of what fuels the ensuing romance between the male and female leads.
-   Played around with in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ by Evangeline. The Magic World knows her as an evil, sexy vampire with an adult body to die for, etc. etc... which is just an oft-used illusion of hers to hide that she has the body of a 10-year old brat. Yet she still manages to be memetically sexy anyway.
-   Shido from _Nightwalker_ has a definite Kiss of the Vampire situation going on with Yayoi, the most frequent client of his vampire detective agency.
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_ invokes this when the Ouran boys dress for Halloween. It was part of their host club's theme.
-   Moka of _Rosario + Vampire_ looks the part,<small>◊</small> but is The Ditz and about as "sensual" and "vampish" as a cardboard box. Inner Moka, on the other hand,<small>◊</small> is very much more sensual and vampish than a cardboard box.
-   _Seraph of the End_: Vampire nobles, and even regular vampires, tend to be sexy Bishōnen or Bishoujo with plenty of mention of their looks. Of the male vampires, Crowley, Ferid, and Mika are Mr. Fanservice and Crowley and Mika fall into Even the Guys Want Him as well.
-   In _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_, vampires are exceedingly Bishōnen. Then again, it's CLAMP; deranged hobos are probably bishie there.
-   _Negima's_ sequel series _UQ Holder!_ has Touta Konoe, who has the double advantage of being a vampire and coming from a family of Chick Magnets.
-   _Vassalord_ is based on this trope, being a Ho Yay\-drenched manga about a pair of extremely sexy male vampires who spend a lot of their pagetime having not-quite-sex-but-it-sure-does-look-it with each other.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: The vampires of the _Innistrad_ block, rather than being true undead, are ageless immortals who happen to share some vampiric traits like bloodthirst and aversion to sunlight. This fools some humans, who eagerly wish to become vampires themselves. Vampires outside of Innistrad avert this, being undead abominations and looking the part.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Vampire Vamp certainly plays up the image of, well, The Vamp. Her effect, which equips an opposing monster to herself, suggests she's a Femme Fatale who enchants and seduces the opposing monster with her looks. In face, the Konami article "PRIO Preview: A Vampiric Revamp," this is also supported by describing its effect as "mesmerizing any opposing monster".

    Comic Books 

-   Josie from Chester Brown's underground comic _Ed the Happy Clown_ was created specifically to take advantage of this trope.
-   Vampirella and her alias, Vampi. It's not just her amazonian looks or skimpy costume either; she actually has a supernatural effect on most men from her presence alone and can make them do what she wants.
-   The vamps in the comic adaptations of the _Anita Blake_ novels are _very_ pretty, as befits the bloodline.
-   In _The Tomb of Dracula_, the Count assaults attractive women in every issue, and the act of biting is often described in sexual terms.
-   _Lenore the Cute Little Dead Girl_ is not quite clear on this with Ragamuffin, as all the characters are caricatures. Lenore is mentioned to be extremely cute, in spite of her quite grotesque, morbid traits, implying that both Lenore and Ragamuffin would be beautiful if they were realistically portrayed.
-   Vampires in _Life Sucks_ aren't necessarily any better-looking than humans, but with the ability to cloud the minds of others comes the potential to force others to fall in love with them. The protagonist describes it as glorified date rape.
-   In _The Unwritten_, after Richie Savoy gets turned into a vampire, he apparently has lots of sex with gothy vampire groupies. (Helped along by the fact that he's outed himself as a vampire in a bestselling book.)
-   Zig-Zagging Trope in _Requiem Vampire Knight_: a great number of them are butt-ugly such as Mortis, Cryptos and Black Sabbath, and those that aren't have tattoos carved into their faces that makes them very fearsome. With that said, some prominent vampires such as Requiem, Claudia and Nero are heavily sexualized regardless and even Dracula, who looks like a 9-foot winged titan with fangs as large as sabretooth has a _massive_ harem of brides.
-   Durham Red from _Strontium Dog_ is an interesting example in that she's actually a mutant with a condition resembling vampirism. She still tends to be played up as an Action Girl Ms. Fanservice character, with an appearance similar to the main character in _BloodRayne_.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Many female vampires from the Chaos! Comics verse fit the bill, with Purgatori as probably the most obvious example. She's basically a demon-vampire hybrid, hence her red-skinned Horned Winged Humanoid appearance, but she needs blood to survive. When she was human she was the favorite consort of the Pharaoh, so you do the math.
-   _Raptors_ centers around a vampiric brother and sister, Drago and Camilla, who have sworn to annihilate the fallen members of their own race who have chosen to become part of the masquerade. They're both portrayed as stunningly attractive and temptuous, as well as sensual lovers (including, incidentally, to each other).

    Fan Works 

-   _NGE: Bloodlust_ has Rei becoming a vampire. It makes her a borderline nymphomaniac and Maya gets herself off by being fed on by a vamp.
-   Discussed in _Imperfect Metamorphosis_, where part of Yukari's dismissal of Remilia involves mocking how often people and vampires themselves believe this trope, when most of the time vampires are just arrogant blowhards. (In Remilia's defense, having the body of a ten-year-old is not really conducive to a sexy persona.)
-   Looking like prepubescent girls does not save the vampiric Scarlet sisters from the huge shipping community in the _Touhou Project_ fandom. In fact, they receive more shipping attention than most characters, be it with their employees, friends or each other.
-   In _Promstuck_, Vriska assumes Kanaya must be filled with uncontrollable lust because she's a Rainbow Drinker (vampire). This leads to Aren't You Going to Ravish Me? moment when Vriska seems to be wanting Kanaya to take sexual liberties with her. Kanaya is not amused by this groundless sterotyping.
-   Twilight Sparkle attempts to invoke this in the _Friendship is Witchcraft_ episode "Lunar Slander":
    
    **Princess "Luna" Molestia:** I do not see how these scary teeth will make me more sexy.  
    **Twilight:** Because... vampire!
    
-   Played for Laughs in _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_.
    -   As she's being cornered by Anderson, Seras briefly considers seducing him to try an get away. She quickly crushes the idea upon remembering that she isn't "an eight year old boy".
    -   When Rip Van Winkle accuses Alucard of being cis-gendered (amongst other things), Alucard retorts that there's no one alive who can comprehend his sexual preference. Considering all the things he gets off to...
    -   Despite providing the page quote, Jan Valentine is in no way this. He just _talks_ about sex a lot (most notably when describing how he's going to rape Integra's mutilated corpse).
-   Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way of My Immortal is an example, as every male character seems to be banging her.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Dracula:
    -   The original _Dracula (1931)_ made Bela Lugosi a sex symbol.
    -   Christopher Lee didn't do too badly with the character either in _Horror of Dracula_.
    -   The 1979 film with Frank Langella was really the first attempt to _deliberately_ present Dracula as a romantic and attractive figure. When the film was being made it was mentioned that Dracula being attractive was to make him more terrifying in a way; it effectively hides the monster underneath and at the time was quite novel, to mislead the audience.
    -   _Bram Stoker's Dracula_: The bloodsucking is played very erotically, Dracula's brides pleasuring Jonathan like a threesome. Lucy's death ends in a parallel to The Immodest Orgasm, and vampire!Lucy tries to seduce Arthur.
    -   Parodied and deconstructed in _Renfield_. Nicolas Cage's take on Dracula portrays him as a creepy domestic abuser, something reflected in him initially looking fairly handsome (and uncannily like the above-mentioned Bela Lugosi version) but becoming increasingly ugly and inhuman looking by the present day. Furthermore, when the idea is specifically brought up by Renfield asking Dracula if he'd like to feed on female virgins specifically, the Count is visibly grossed out by the question and uncomfortable with the whole concept, asking that Renfield not make him eating people into some weird psychosexual thing.

-   Selene and Erika of _Underworld (2003)_. Selene doesn't actually have _that_ many partners, being part of an Official Couple with Michael Corvin, but her Spy Catsuit is still her most well-known trait to casual viewers.
-   The Big Bad in _Lifeforce (1985)_ is a naked, female space vampire who seduces her victims before devouring their life energy.

-   Chris Sarandon in _Fright Night (1985)_. For _both_ sexes. Colin Farrell in the remake. And later, Amanda Bearse and Imogen Poots. Plus Jaime Murray in a Blood Bath in the sequel to the remake.
-   Lampshaded furiously in _Vampire in Brooklyn_ with a newly turned vampire spending more than a minute expressing amazement at... he notices he's got a bigger dick than before.
-   _Van Helsing_ has Dracula, as well as the three lovely ladies who keep him company.
-   _John Carpenter's Vampires_ has the Big Bad Jan Valek bite the Damsel in Distress on the inner thigh while the camera focuses on her face in what seems to be orgasmic bliss. He then looks up from her crotch with blood on his face and asks her if it feels beautiful.
-   _The Lair of the White Worm_ is a Lesbian Vampire flick about a giant snake threatening England, which was directed by Ken Russell, who liked this sort of thing.
-   Every female vampire in _Dracula: Dead and Loving It_:
-   Dracula and his three vampire brides in _Dracula 2000_. One of the brides, Solina, lampshades this trope by drawing a connection between vampires and lovers. Even the tagline for the movie was "The most seductive evil of all time has now been unleashed in ours."
-   In the movie adaptation _Queen of the Damned_, vampires Lestat and Akasha are shown to be sensual lovers. This is also exploited by the vampires, as Lestat uses his "sex god" rock persona to lure in victims as dimwitted groupies literally throw themselves at him, only to be bled dry by Lestat.

-   In _Embrace of the Vampire (1995)_, the vampire serves as a dark and tempting contrast to the heroine's mortal boyfriend. The vampire believes her to be the reincarnation of his lover when he was a mortal and attempts to rekindle their relationship in the present. He tries to seduce her through dreams, an effort made easier by the fact that just about everyone around her is trying to convince her to be more hedonistic. At the climax, the vampire has put her in a trance and is about to bite her so they can share Eternal Love but then she whispers her boyfriend's name. The vampire tries to convince her to forget him, but she whispers his name again. Stricken, the vampire realizes he has no chance with her and releases her. He then commits Suicide by Sunlight.
-   _Freaks of Nature_: Petra is very attractive, and so is her sire Milan, who is Tall, Dark, and Handsome as befitting a parody of Edward Cullen. Lorelei also qualifies after being turned into a vampire (helps that she's played by Vanessa Hudgens), even remarking that her boobs grew in size.
-   While not _technically_ a vampire, Mrs. Bathory in _Hostel Part II_ evokes this trope when she kills Lorna, stripping naked and bathing in Lorna's blood after slitting her throat.
-   Exploited Trope in _From Dusk Till Dawn_. Santanico Pandemonium and the rest of the female vampires pose as strippers at the Titty Twister Bar to lure in victims. When they drop the act and adopt their Game Face, they're not so appealing anymore...

    Folklore 

-   Early legends of vampires often depicted them as lustful beings.
    -   The Slavic belief that female vampires can live a normal life and marry, where they would exhaust their husbands with their sexual demands.
    -   The Yugoslavian belief that a male vampire will eventually kill his widow with sexual attentions. The probable explanation, according to _Vampires, Burial and Death: Folklore and Reality_ by Paul Barber has to do with exhumed men's corpses having the appearance of erections due to the gases of decomposition puffing out the genitalia as well as other parts of the body.

    Literature 

-   _A Dowry of Blood_: Dracula is a handsome vampire, who is described in various erotic manners and is noted to be a great seducer of both genders.
-   Vampires from _The Twilight Saga_ never get tired, never have to eat, never have to go to the bathroom, and (apparently) lack a refractory period, since they never stop. That doesn't mean they can't get people pregnant, of course… But only the men. Female vampires can't ever get pregnant.
    -   The attractiveness factor is touched on in the books, saying they use their beauty as a way to lure people in to feed on them.
-   _Dracula_ never presented Drac as sexy, described as having a big, beak-like nose, a unibrow, and hairy palms. Him being thought of as a sex god comes from him being a metaphor for sex, at a time when sex was viewed as completely repulsive and subversively fascinating at the same time. There's still something irresistible about him and his three "brides", but it's probably supernatural mind powers. He does tend to target attractive women though, so the brides and his other victims are an example.
    -   The female vampires play this trope dead straight, however - the male protagonists are shown to be irresistibly attracted to Dracula's brides and to Lucy's vampire incarnation. Van Helsing even struggles to destroy them, only succeeding when Mina's cries for help awaken him from his trance.

-   Every vampire from _The Vampire Chronicles_. Every one. Including Claudia. Ironic, considering that Rice's vampires were unable to copulate at all upon being turned. The drinking of blood did become a bit of a metaphor for sex, though. In _Interview with the Vampire_, however, Louis and Claudia meet vampires in Eastern Europe, who are basically rotting, animated corpses.
-   Sanguini, a vampire party guest in _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_, seems to attract a number of girls, and he leers back at them.
-   The vampires in _Night World_, by L. J. Smith. As well as the vampires in _The Vampire Diaries_, of the same author.
-   _President's Vampire_ plays with this in case of Nathaniel Cade. Muggle Zach notes that while Cade is psychically attractive, he has an "aura" that makes people terrified when alone with him. Tania, a fellow vampiress, says that Cade is sexy as hell. And Cade himself...
    
    **Cade**: Humans are our food. Do you want to have sex with a cow?
    
    -   Interestingly enough, he and Tania do have sex at one point, although its apparently no better than human.
-   An entire bloodline of vampires are this in _Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter_, up to the point that they are (in-story) the inspiration for Succubi and Incubi myths. It's implied, though, that everyone except the "good guys" aren't above just grabbing some random person and draining them dry every night. Apparently, "hiding kills from the authorities" is a bloodline power of every line but Belle Morte's.
-   Rhage of _Black Dagger Brotherhood_.
-   _Vampire Kisses_: Alexander Sterling. Alternatively, his cousin Claude. You know, the one that hits on all the girls, single or not.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   To quote Otto in _The Truth_, "Vell, let's just say, zey don't _alvays_ scream."
    -   This is pretty much a rule on the Disc. In _Thud!_, it is commented that female vampires look stunning in just about anything, and that, unlike males, they can't reform their clothing when changing back to their human form, 'probably due to all that underwired nightdress business.'
    -   Subverted for laughs in _Reaper Man_ with a pair of overweight, middle-aged, Morporkian vampires who'd certainly _like_ to be sexy and elegant. And the Countess isn't even a vampire proper—she's just pretending because her husband inherited vampirism with the title, well past the point where biting the missus was likely to happen.
    -   Lady Margalotta is described as a reasonably attractive middle-aged woman, who dresses in fuzzy pink sweaters.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   A near literal example with the White Court House of Raith, who feed off of lust. Poor Thomas can't even hold a job slinging burgers, because the women on staff keep trying to molest him in the break room!
    -   The Red Court vampires get a dose of this. Suave, sophisticated, and more than a little drop dead gorgeous—and on top of that, their saliva serves as a potent narcotic with euphoric properties. Mind you, the sexiness is quite literally only skin deep...
    -   Completely averted with the Black Court vampires, however. They're the most classic of the vampires, having all the Stoker-esque powers and weaknesses, but each and every one presented in the series is described as a foul-smelling corpse. Older ones appear to be more withered husks, but recently created Black Court are specifically noted to be more than a little leaky from decay.
-   The male vampires in novels by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro are dead below the belt, and compensate by being cunning linguists.
-   _Bloodsucking Fiends_ by Christopher Moore. Tommy's response to discovering that his new girlfriend is a bloodsucker? "That's the coolest thing I've ever heard. Let's do it with our socks off."
-   From book to book, P.N. Elrod can't seem to remember if her male vampires are able to engage in conventional intercourse or not, which is kind of embarrassing. Her female vampires definitely can, however, and in books where the males are impotent, a little neck-nibbling and heavy petting usually gets the job done. Potent or not, Jack and Bobbi can barely refrain from getting it on for five minutes at a stretch whenever they're alone.
-   The protagonist of S. P. Somtow's _Vampire Junction_ often feeds himself by picking up horny men in the red-light districts... and he looks ten years old. (Guess if you gotta kill _somebody_...) Similarly, all the vampires we see in the short story "Venus and Mars" (besides one mook) are beautiful young girls, all mostly ex-child prostitutes. They have a fairly successful racket going on.
-   Depicted in an interesting way in Barb Hendee's series, starting with _Blood Memories._ Vampires project a hypnotic aura that varies depending on the personality type they had in life. Someone who was naturally sexy and appealing will be able to easily attract human prey, whereas someone who came across as intimidating or creepy in life can paralyze victims with fear. Other vampires in the series give off an "innocent and helpless" vibe that draws in people who want to take care of them or take advantage of them, or an aura of charm that makes that vampire seem naturally charismatic and likable.
-   Larry Niven plays with this trope in the _Known Space_ universe. There is a group of Human Aliens called Vampires living on the Ringworld which drink blood as their primary means of sustenance. They emit a pheromone capable of seducing any humans or other Human Aliens that they encounter and then drink them dry during sex (luckily, our hero has befriended a tiger-like alien who cannot be harmed by the pheromones). However, the Vampires are also non-sentient, possessing about the same intelligence level as a monkey. Some perverted Human Aliens use defanged vampires for sex.
-   Ivy and Kisten from _The Hollows_—much is made about both characters' sexual prowess throughout the series.
-   This seems to be a universal rule for vampires in the _Night Huntress_ series. Their venom acts as an aphrodisiac and they have centuries of experience to back it up with. Though only two vampires (Bones, with his experience as a former gigolo, and Annette, whose visits to gigolos in the eighteenth century indicate a general horny nature) have ever been commented on in this manner. Also, the implications of having sex with undead people were joked about once or twice (in the scene where Cat's boss and her team are pointing out that her relationship with Bones makes her a necrophiliac, and she points out that a number of them have expressed interest in screwing her, and since she is a Dhampyr, that means they are all necrophiliacs too).
-   _Necroscope_ goes interesting directions with this trope. Its vampires have impressive shapeshifting capabilities, which, though unpleasant to look at, can greatly enhance sex. Then, when it's time to feed...
-   Discussed and averted in _The Mortal Instruments_, as Jace makes clear to Simon:
    
    **Jace:** There’s no such thing as vampire mojo.
    
-   Subverted in the _Coldfire Trilogy_. Vampire Villain Protagonist Gerald Tarrant is ridiculously handsome, something that _everybody_ who meets him regardless of orientation is prone to remarking on. Unfortunately for any would-be partners, his vampirism itself renders him both impotent and asexual.
-   In _Tentyrian Legacy_, the character of Maximos has had 3,000 years to practice his romantic and sexual skills. Sadly, the Dark Coven's members are the only ones who are inclined to romance humans and they're all pretty sociopaths.
-   Averted hard in _The Strain_, where a rock star in the process of becoming a vampire finds struggling with impotence. After trying and failing to have sex with a groupie, he gets up to use the bathroom... and his penis falls off. Vampires don't reproduce sexually, so they have no need for the associated body parts.
-   The vampires in The United States of Monsters and especially _Straight Outta Fangton_ are capable of delivering an incredibly sexual bite that is like a minute long orgasm according to many. They also are capable of changing their appearance over time so most become ridiculously beautiful. The Old Ones tend to have huge harems and spend much of their time having sex.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The Countess, Donovan, and Ramona Royale of _American Horror Story_ are this. Elizabeth and Donovan also mark their first appearance in the show by luring a human couple into having sex with them during the pilot episode. As one might imagine, the humans aren't exactly aware what they bargained for...
-   _Buffyverse_:
    -   Angel, Spike, Drusilla, and Darla (a successful prostitute in her human life), whose sexual energy is remarked upon by many, including main characters. Oddly they are all "descended" from the Master, who Looks Like Orlok.
    -   Mocked when Spike's inability to feed after getting the chip installed is a metaphor for impotence.
    -   Vampire Willow is the only one who integrates sex with her feeding and Cold-Blooded Torture sessions. Like playing sex games with Angel by slowly burning him alive.
    -   Seen in the opening two-parter—Alpha Bitch Cordelia won't give Jesse the time of day until he becomes a vampire, whereupon he suddenly becomes more assertive, darker, and sexier.
    -   According to Andrew, one of Dracula's abilities, next to hypnosis and shapeshifting, is "romantic undertones". He seduces his victims, likes to make a connection with them before he feeds from them, and only sires them when they beg for it. A lot of characters mention his "dark, penetrating eyes" and good looks, to the point that even lesbians comment on his sexiness.
-   One _Castle_ Halloween Episode deals with a murder in a vampire LARP community, complete with the team interviewing an attractive woman playing the head vampire who insists that all their blood-play is Safe, Sane, and Consensual. Ryan comments he once dated a woman who was into the lifestyle but broke up with her.
    
    **Esposito:** What happened, did the relationship suck?  
    **Ryan:** Deal-breaker for me? She wanted to have sex in a coffin. I'm... open-minded, I'm not _that_ open-minded.
    
-   In _Community_ episode "Epidemiology", Troy tries to invoke this when he changes out of his Power Loader costume into a "sexy Dracula" costume, hoping he'll attract more girls that way.
-   Parodied in the _Doctor Who_ episode "The Vampires of Venice", where they're Actually Not a Vampire and not remotely sexy, with a bunch of fish aliens using Perception Filters to disguise themselves as attractive humans, except for their teeth. In the next season, the Doctor refers to them somewhat mockingly as "sexy fish vampires".
-   _Dracula (2013)_: Dracula wastes little time seducing Lady Jayne, and from her enthused reactions when they have sex, he's _very_ good.
-   Subverted in _Forever Knight_. It's not like Nick Knight isn't attractive to women, but for vampires the excitement is in the blood-drinking. Even if he just wanted to have sex, there's always the risk that he'd vamp out and kill them. The popular version of this trope is lampshaded when a woman on a talk show claims her boyfriend is a vampire (he's not) and the sex is great. A psychiatrist on the show then says such relationships are based on fantasy and abuse, while the sex is actually non-existent. Both Natalie (who has Ship Tease with Nick) and Tracy (who has Ship Tease with Vachon) are listening to the show, and this strikes an uncomfortable chord.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: The sex Louis de Pointe du Lac had with human men pales in comparison to the sex he experienced with the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt. Louis describes the pleasure he received from Their First Time as being 1.586 billion <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  times better than the high one gets from black tar heroin. 112 years onwards, Louis reminisces about Lestat's seduction like it's the best sex he's ever had in his 144-year existence. The following exchange is from "In Throes of Increasing Wonder...".
    
    **Louis**: When you were using drugs, Mr. Molloy, do you remember the best you ever had?  
    **Daniel**: Berkeley, 1978. Some Mexican black tar \[heroin\] that Carly and Pedro were slinging.  
    **Louis**: So imagine that flowing inside your veins again. Now multiply it by miles, to the rings of Saturn and back.
    
-   Parodied in the _Key & Peele_ sketch "Sexy Vampires", where the vampire clan's newest member Tyrell finds it ridiculous; he only became a vampire so that he could live forever and see future cars. The other vampires actually agree with him, noticing that their tight leather pants are uncomfortable, that they don't actually like the gothic music playing, and that some of the "lesbian" vampires actually have boyfriends, and think that their leader Cyrus is more desperate than anything. They proceed to anoint Tyrell their new leader and let him give their clan a more ghetto-fabulous makeover.
-   Mick St. John of _Moonlight_. See also Josef, Coraline, and Lola.
-   Rory in _My Babysitter's a Vampire_ subverts this; he has even worse luck with the ladies than Ethan and Benny, and that's saying a lot (although he is good-looking enough for the audience to admire). Played straight with Erica and Jesse though. And while Sarah _is_ sexy, she doesn't _quite_ qualify as a full vampire.
-   _Sherlock Holmes_. In "The Last Vampyre", John Stockton's alluring effect on women is one of the things that make people suspect he's a vampire. It's ambiguous whether he really does have this effect or people are just imagining it.
-   Parodied in _Supernatural_ when Dean, while hunting vampires, runs across a teenager who wears fake vampire fangs to pick up girls. Also exploited in the same episode by _actual_ vampires who use the _Twilight_ craze as a... recruiting tactic.
-   _True Blood_:
    -   Bill Compton. Eric and Pam are also sexy, particularly given they run a club for Vampire Fan Boys and Fan Girls.
    -   The number of hot vampires grows with the appearances of Jessica, Godric, Lorena, Franklin, and Talbot.
    -   Lampshaded and justified In-Universe. Vampire blood is prized for its healing powers and is often used as a recreational drug... with the side effect that it gives you vivid and intense sex dreams about the vampire it came from.
    -   Also, in this universe, being bitten by a vampire can be literally pleasurable and/or arousing.
-   _The Vampire Diaries_:
    -   It's implied when a vampire friend tells Stefan that if he wants Elena to love him, he should just give her a taste of "awesome vampire sex." Stefan admits he wants to, but refrains because he wants her to "have a choice." Thus, it is implied that not only is he a supernatural sex god, he's also a genuine romantic.
    -   Katherine, Vicki, Caroline, Rose, Klaus, Elijah, Damon, Rebekah … Basically every vampire on the show.
-   _The X-Files_: Agent Scully repeats many times in "Bad Blood" that she doesn't believe in vampires, yet she admits they're supposed to be extremely charming and seductive creatures. She's completely dazzled by Sheriff Hartwell, who happens to be a real vampire.
-   _Young Dracula_: The only unattractive vampires that have been seen are Count Dracula's parents-in-law the Westenras.

    Pinballs 

-   In _Bram Stoker's Dracula_, one of the animated displays has Dracula seducing and biting a woman, to which she moans in pleasure.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   This trope was accidentally invoked by CMLL when they created the Vampiro Canadiense gimmick. The bookers thought the wrestler was funny looking and thus deserved a funny gimmick, the lady fans disagreed.
-   The "sex god" archetype was played to the hilt by Gangrel and Edge (yes, _that_ Edge), who were hot blond studs who also just happened to be vampires. Though Edge later said that he and Christian were "pseudo vampires".
-   Ariel, the tarot playing attendant of wrestling vampires Kevin Thorn, the aforementioned Gangrel and Billy Blade, who would sometimes attempt to seduce their opponents.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Atmosfear_: With her breathy voice, seductive comments, and vampiric traits, Countess Bathory starts as very attractive. She then subverts it by becoming grotesque during the climax.
-   _Bleak World_: The Dracul and Mods fit this trope to a T, being inhumanly beautiful and gaining significant bonuses to seduction. For some reason that is often chalked up to animal magnetism, Wendigo also receive these bonuses. Primal Vampires do not get the bonuses, but have a strong aversion to wearing shirts and are quite ripped. Female Primal avert this however, being completely hairless with about the same body type as the men. And nobody is attracted to Nosferatu.
-   _Warhammer_: The Lahmian bloodline of vampires consists entirely of gorgeous Femme Fatales. This stands them in marked contrast to the Necrarch and Strigoi bloodlines, who appear to be withered corpses and feral Bat People, respectively. The Blood Dragon lineage can go either way. While the Von Carsteins don't quite have the same reputation as the Lahmians, they are still intensely charismatic aristocrats and more or less uniformly attractive. Later lore establishes that many of the Von Carsteins are only members politically, and many of them were technically male Lahmians.
-   _The World of Darkness_:
    -   _Vampire: The Masquerade_ has the Toreador, Anne Rice-style vampires who stick close to humanity (especially its artists). It helps that they have powers that make them the center of attention. Their weakness is Creative Sterility, more so than any other vampire clan. It should be noted that in _Masquerade_, vampires do not generally enjoy sex unless they're feeding during it. Earlier editions treat this as vampires not getting physical gratification, but more getting off intellectually on the idea that they know how to please their partners; however, 5th edition has it so that high Humanity vampires can naturally enjoy sex, whereas low Humanity vampires can't get it up even if they spend blood to mimic human biological functions (a trait backported from _Requiem_).
    -   _Vampire: The Requiem_ features the Daeva, spiritual heirs to the Toreador who are often called "Succubi" by other vampires for obvious reasons. (Indeed, Toreador are still in the game, but as a Bloodline of the Daeva.) This is basically the "vampire archetype" that their clan is meant to embody, and so they carry on the tradition of powers that can make everyone in the room fall in love with them. Their splat has stories of them being descended from Inanna/Ishtar, a sex goddess of conflict, so, at the very least, they're children of a sex goddess. Even their weakness furthers the standard of the trope; in 1e, Daeva suffer from having to indulge their Vices at every opportunity or take a hit to their will (most often Lust or Gluttony, but a Daeva with Wrath as their Vice is... something to run away from), whilst in 2e, Daeva are prone to becoming obsessed with someone that they feed on more than once. As their Humanity wanes, their affectations become increasingly artificial, their beauty more and more plasticine and mechancial - they devolve into sex objects rather than people.

    Theater 

-   Invoked in the theater skit "Les Branleurs" (literally, "the wankers"; here with a figurative meaning like "the lazy coarse fools") from Les Inconnus, three beaufs are discussing their sexual life, then decide to talk about something else. Cue an awkward silence, followed by this:
    
    I rented the _Bram Stoker's Dracula_ videotape yesterday evening, it was very good. Especially the scene where the vampire bangs the chick! Wow, just for this, I would like to become a vampire!
    
-   In _Tanz Der Vampire_ Graf von Krolock is a seductive and mysterious vampire lord (also getting played by a variety of handsome musical actors certainly helps). Von Krolock's son Herbert is (usually) a sexy beast too. As is Magda. (And quite a few other vampires, in a rotting, creepy way.)

    Video Games 

-   Zig-Zagged by Astarion in _Baldur's Gate III_. He's a campy, flamboyant Lovable Rogue vampire who Really Gets Around, but at the same time hates being seen as a sex object due to the abuse he suffered from the vampire who sired him. In Part II the party encounters a dark elf with a vampire fetish, and he's creeped out by the entire situation as he begs the Player Character to remove him from it. He ends up being a Deconstructed Character Archetype of this trope and The Casanova as after a century of serving as a honeypot to lure in his master's victims he doesn't really remember his original personality and is terrified of emotional intimacy.
-   _Bloodrayne_ was featured in Playboy, if the games didn't provide enough of a hint.
-   Vivi from _Brain Dead 13_. She has an Impossible Hourglass Figure, is a Statuesque Stunner, talks in a completely flirtatious and teasing manner, and all this despite having blue skin and a hairdo that looks like the Bride of Frankenstein.
-   Dracula in the _Castlevania_ series has tons of sex appeal, whether he's drawn in his mid 20s or early 40s. Carmilla says as much in _Castlevania: Judgment_, and she's the Lesbian Vampire Trope Codifier! Interestingly, human incantations of either Dracula or Alucard share the same aspects. The few instances we see of Dracula as human or reincarnated as human doesn't seem to lack in sex appeal, Alucard as Genya had the description of being "very cold but inhumanly attractive", Soma is pretty easy on the eyes, and the previous mortal incarnation of Dracula, the supposed Mathias Conquist, was pretty bishonen by most standards.
-   Sylea in _Champions of Norrath_ is a gorgeous and alluring Dark Elf vampire maiden adorned in jewelry and nothing more. Despite looking seductively evil (in contrast to her master Vanahorst who Looks Like Orlok), she is actually a good person who helps the player character in their quest.
-   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_: While it doesn't involve actual vampires, Celeste planned to use the money Monokuma provided as a motive for murder in addition to her own considerable savings to purchase a Big Fancy Castle to live in, as well as hire dozens of attractive male servants who she would make dress up like sexy vampires. At least, that's what she said she was going to do.
-   _Darkstalkers_: Demitri Maximoff resides in an elegant (albeit otherworldly) castle and has an outrageously huge harem of female servants to do his bidding. In the _Night Warriors_/_Vampire Hunter_ OVA, he manages to eventually sway _**Morrigan**_ with his charm.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   The vast majority of the time, the series averts this. Vampires are diseased/cursed monsters to be slain and aren't treated as being remotely sexy. Additionally, Dibella, the Aedric Divine Goddess of Beauty who has a particular association with the carnal and sexual aspects of love, commands that her followers are not to associate with vampires, believing them to be "impure spirits". However, some exceptions do exist.
    -   In _Skyrim_'s _Dawnguard_ DLC, there is a race of "pureblood" vampires. They look much less ugly, and the women wear seductive robes with cleavage (which is quite unusual in the setting). Serana in particular is downright gorgeous.
    -   In the series' backstory, the Tsaesci are said to be a race of "snake vampires'' hailing from the continent of Akavir, far to the east of Tamriel. They invaded Tamriel late in the 1st Era but were defeated and incorporated into the Reman Dynasty empire. They are said to have left behind children with the Tamriellic races, who are stated to be "beautiful, if frightening". Though there are conflicting sources, some sources state that the Tsaesci have fully serpentine lower bodies.
-   _Fate/Grand Order_ has Carmilla, whose final ascension art portrays her as a dominatrix - although Elizabeth Bathory, her younger version, averts this.
-   Nitara from _Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance_.
-   The Dark Master from _Quest for Glory IV_ is a powerful vampire mage who knows how to play up their sex appeal for all it's worth.
-   In _The Tomb of Sammun-Mak_, Nefertiti the mole girl finds Jurgen irresistible. Admittedly, even _before_ he becomes a vampire, but even moreso after that. Jurgen lampshades this.
-   Raphael from _SoulCalibur_. How else did he get maid henchmen...?
-   _Suikoden_: Sierra is a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire who becomes attracted to one of the main characters, much to his bashful grief.
-   _Twisted Wonderland_: Vil Schoenheit is a human, but his vampire Halloween costume is meant to evoke this image, with dapper clothing and thick makeup. His card art even has him hold an umbrella between his legs as if pole dancing.
-   The Toreador clan of _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_ (and its other associated media) are the embodiment of this trope (see Tabletop Games). In-game, you can utilize seduction as a tool to get blood from humans and as a form of persuasion during quests. It _can_ be used by most playable clans in the game with the right allocation of your exp points, but will come easiest for Toreadore players.
    -   Generally speaking, most of the Vampires in the game (PCs included) are pretty good-looking. The only real exception to this is the Nosferatu, the Tzimisce, the Sabbat-aligned Gangrel mooks (likely due to their very low humanity), and whatever LaCroix's Sheriff is supposed to be. Even the flesh-eating vampire you can find running amuck in an abandoned hospital is eerily beautiful.
    -   For some very specific examples, Jeanette Voermann, a Malkavian in a schoolgirl outfit who has a line of lovers out the door (including mortals, much to the disgust of her sister, Therese) and Velvet Velour, a Toreador who runs a strip club in Hollywood.
-   Serena of _Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption_. In the modern day, have Lily feed from Christof, then select Christof and look at Lily in first person view.
-   A variation in _The Witcher_. For the most part, vampires are generic monsters to kill, but there's one particularly intelligent vampire who is the madam of a high-class brothel. (And, like so many other women in the game, Geralt can sleep with her.) Subverted in that they're actually quite innocent (she and her fellow vampiresses are high vampires that don't need to drink blood, they just drink it because it provides an alcohol-like buzz), and are one of the most successful brothels in the city. This doesn't stop a group of knights from a monster-slaying order from storming the place to try and rescue another knight's sister, who had not only come there of her own accord, but also came to escape the marriage that her brother had arranged (with an old, ugly man that apparently has massive hemorrhoids and he's apparently been the scourge of her existence all her life).
-   In _Darkest Dungeon_, this manifests in the form of the Countess. Her outward appearance is as a "bewitching predator" who is incredibly beautiful and seductive... until the the light of the moon reveals that she is a nightmarish tick-like monster. For the most part, however, the vampires are something of a mockery of this trope, for while many of the Courtesans' and the Countess's attacks bear names laden with sexual innuendo, they are all monstrous bloodsucking insects hiding beneath a gossamer-thin veil of civility and long-discarded humanity.
-   Parodied in _Grabbed by the Ghoulies_: vampire girls wear strapless purple dresses and are very buxom... but are also quite on the plump side of things. They even have a risque attack in which they grab Cooper and drag him in their coffin, which then closes and rocks as Cooper's health diminishes and little hearts emerge from the coffin.

    Webcomics 

-   Subverted by Miss. Addison Constance Loveworth in _IronGate_ having been raised in a proper 19th century upper class New England family has left her with no interest in any such tawdry activity.
-   Deconstructed by Susan in this _El Goonish Shive_ strip.
    
    "The real life equivalent would be a handsome man seducing you while you're drunk and stealing your wallet to buy a sandwich."
    
    -   Also, Vampires in-universe are textbook psychopaths due to the side-effects of their magical augmentations. They don't need blood or sex - they just really, really want to take these things by force.
-   Used in _Sluggy Freelance_:
    
    **Torg:** _Wow!_ When you become a vampire, men become broad-shouldered and muscle-bound and women become tall and thin! You ever think of selling this on QVC?  
    **Lysinda:** Foolish mortal ... Do you really think humanity would give up its immortal soul forever just to look good? _Beat_ Sylvia...  
    **Sylvia:** "Infomercials next quarter," _check_.
    
-   Being the Secret-Keeper of the _Vampire Cheerleaders_ has its advantages.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   An in-universe example; Kanaya's introduction mentions that she likes reading romance novels about 'rainbow drinkers' (the troll equivalent of vampires). She eventually turns into one, cheating death and becoming even more badass in the process. Her dancestor, Porrim, is much the same way.
    -   Vriska also believes this; before Kanaya became a rainbow drinker, her relationship with Kanaya was platonic and slightly antagonistic. Afterwards, though, she got a crush on her.
        -   Of course, Kanaya became a rainbow drinker around the same time as when she kicked a Monster Clown in the crotch, punched Vriska so hard she reeled backwards, and chainsawed her murderer in half. Knowing Vriska, it's understandable.
-   _Sam & Fuzzy_: One of the many different mental illnesses that plague vampires is outbreaks of hypersexual behaviour, commonly referred to as 'Vamp Vamps'. This causes the vampire to become comically oversexualized and become a Living Aphrodisiac (though it can't override someone's orientation). Vampires with this disorder are treated somewhat like alcoholics or someone with a drug problem by the vampire community, as they go out of control, seduce and bite someone, and then wake up the next evening not remembering what they did last night.

    Web Original 

-   Obligatory _Cracked_ example: "Why Everyone Wants to Have Sex with Vampires."

    Web Videos 

-   _Carmilla the Series_ plays with this.
    -   Carm is certainly drop-dead gorgeous and Laura thinks she uses it to seduce her victims, but the vampire and sexy parts are unrelated; much to Laura's surprise Carmilla is genuinely interested in her, and not as a meal.
    -   Season 2 adds Sophia Walker as Matska "Mattie" Belmonde, Carmilla's elegant, urbane, sophisticated older sister.

    Western Animation 

-   _Castlevania (2017)_:
    -   Subverted with Alucard: He has the good looks and the long hair and the husky voice, and he's introduced with an extended shirtless scene in which he kicks Trevor's ass (which was clearly intended to come across in a slightly Ho Yay way), but he never actually tries to seduce anyone. And when he finally has a sex scene in season 3, _Alucard_ is presented as the shy ingenue in a long white nightshirt and the humans are doing the somewhat aggressive seducing. In fact, he comes across as so passive and out of his depth during this scene that one could conclude that he'd been a virgin up till this point. Which would be a justified writing decision, since it had been implied earlier that he's really a teenager in an adult man's body, due to physically growing up faster than a human would, and his human mother had still only looked middle-aged when she died a year or two earlier in the story.
    -   Purposely invoked by Lenore. She seduces Hector, has sex with him, and has him fall in love with her to have him become her "pet", including putting a magic slave ring on him that enforces his obedience. However, the next season shows them having a genuine relationship with no sexual abuse of him so much as implied and Hector even being comfortable trading innuendos.
-   _The Legend of Vox Machina_: This trope was intentionally invoked with Sylas and Delilah Briarwood (only Sylas is actually a vampire, but Delilah has the look as well) in order to make them more interesting and somewhat rootable villains, despite all the genuinely psychopathic shit they pull. As a result, a common audience reaction is: "I know they're evil as all Hell, but... they could get it." And in-universe, Vax's first reaction to them is also "Gosh, you're a handsome couple. Lost my train of thought..." Though it's left unclear if he actually meant it or if he was only pretending to be Distracted by the Sexy in an attempt to distract _them_.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Interestingly, these characters' sex appeal is largely just based on the voice-acting and the utterly adoring way they treat each other, since neither ever tries to seduce anyone else and they're fully dressed at all times.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Though of course it also doesn't hurt that the artists based their character designs on Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham in their Halloween cosplay interpretation of these characters.<small>◊</small>
