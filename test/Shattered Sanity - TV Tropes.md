A person's mind is something that can be quite fragile, particularly if the person happens to be a cutie in a Crapsack World. The iconic fragile thing in fiction seems to be glass - very shiny and very fragile. This leads to it and its shattering being used as a metaphor for an individual's broken sanity.

A popular variant of this is the House of Broken Mirrors.
